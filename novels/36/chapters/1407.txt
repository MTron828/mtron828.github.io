Very quickly, Chen Xiang found out about the man’s background, because what happened today also caused quite a commotion.

"The young master of the Sword Divine Palace, the great-grandson of the Sword Divine Palace’s hall master. I heard that he inherited some kind of sword soul legacy, so he was able to control a holy sword at such a young age. Xiao Xiang, do you know why the Heavenly Core in your body is related to him?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Sword Soul... It might be that thing, and I don’t even know what the Sword Soul is. " Mu Qianxiang frowned.

"The great-grandson of the Sword Divine Palace’s master is named Ding Xingyao, and is known to be unparalleled under the Immortal Monarch. Didn’t this Sword Divine Palace have enmity with the Divine Sword Palace?! Now that the Divine Sword Palace hasn’t gone to look for Ding Xingyao, he has actually gone to search for me everywhere." Chen Xiang said angrily: "Indeed, people with status can ignore the rules."

"In that case, are we still going to participate in the Immortal Sword Conference? I’m worried that I will bring you trouble." Mu Qianxiang said.

"Go, why not? I’ve already found out where the Flower Emperor is. At that time, as long as you join the Hundreds of Flowers Immortal Country, the Sword Divine Palace won’t dare to provoke you either." Chen Xiang patted her shoulder. "There’s nothing to worry about, take out your wild name. If that guy dares to come again, you can come and fight with me."

Mu Qianxiang revealed a smile: "No problem, beat him up together, give him some face and he will be quiet. We siblings are not that easy to mess with."

"That’s more like it." Chen Xiang laughed: "Don’t worry, I will definitely help you get a good sword."

... ....

Ding Xingyao stood at the side of a middle aged man and said softly: "Grandfather, I did not strike out recklessly, I feel that woman has something stronger than my sword spirit, the Sword Qi is extremely weak, but it is the same as the Sword Qi of the divine sword in the middle of Divine Sword Immortal Palace, I wonder what is in her body."

"If your great-grandfather were to come, he should be able to find out what it is. I’ve already sent someone to send him a message, so we’ll soon be able to confirm what it is." He was the Great Clan Elder of the Sword Divine Palace, his status was extremely high, and his strength was also at the intermediate Immortal King Stage. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

At this moment, someone came in and handed over a letter. Ding Tianghui opened it and the words on it immediately disappeared. Ding Tianghui also knew the contents of the letter.

"I didn’t expect it to be that one." Ding Tianhui held the blank piece of paper tightly, his hands were actually trembling, and he looked extremely excited: "Your great-grandfather will arrive soon."

Ding Xingyao said in a shocked voice, "What exactly is it that made this great grandfather, who has never left the Sword Divine Palace for ten thousand years, come personally? The thing on that woman’s body is so much more powerful than my sword spirit."

Your sword spirit is just a strand of the Thousand Myriad Tao Divine Sword’s soul that is hidden on the divine sword, and the thing that the woman has, is the Sword Emperor’s true inheritance. I don’t know why it would appear on a woman, but after the Sword Emperor and the Dan Emperor entered the Night Devil Hell, there was no news about it. Ding Tian Hui’s eyes were filled with abnormality: "If we can obtain this woman, the strength of our Sword Divine Palace will definitely lose out to that Divine Sword Palace very quickly."

Ding Xingyao gritted his teeth: "If I had known earlier, I would have taken that woman down without a care, blaming me for being too worried about the Divine Sword Palace."

"It’s alright, they haven’t left the Divine Sword Immortal Palace yet. Your great grandfather will be here soon, and at that time, there should be a way to find that woman." Ding Tian Hui took a deep breath, "From your description, the female follower seems to be very powerful."

"When he made his move, Innate Qi was only at the intermediate stage of the Worldly Immortal Stage. It wasn’t that powerful." Ding Xingyao said, "Great Grandfather is sure that the woman has the Sword Emperor’s legacy. How did he confirm it?"

"Those who have absorbed the Sword Soul will be able to sense it. Obtaining the Sword Emperor’s inheritance means that they will be able to gain the Sword Soul’s approval. They can easily control the divine sword, unlike us who need to expend a great deal of energy to use it." Ding Tianhui said.

"It all depends on great-grandfather." Ding Xingyao clenched his fist and said.

Chen Xiang and Mu Qianxiang did not go out. Instead, they sent someone to pass a message to Wang Weiquan, leaving behind an address. He wanted to see Liu Zongyu.

The one who came was not Liu Zongyu, but Liu Meng’er.

"Elder Sister Meng’er, why are you here?" Chen Xiang was a little shocked, but he secretly rejoiced in his heart, because he finally had the chance to be alone with Liu Meng’er.

Liu Meng’er wore a light green long dress. She was dressed in a very simple manner, unlike the Queen’s temperament when she was at the Divine Arms Mill, but she still gave off a peerless and noble feeling.

"Xiao Xiang, Elder Sister Meng’er and I have something we need to talk about alone. Wait here for a while." Chen Xiang did not care about Mu Qianxiang’s surprised expression, she grabbed onto Liu Meng’er’s soft jade hands and quickly walked into the room.

Previously, when they were eating the barbecue meat together, Mu Qianxiang had thought that their relationship was not that good, but now, she was shocked. She did not expect Chen Xiang and Liu Meng’er to have this kind of relationship, it was just that she covered it up at that time.

"Would Sister Xianxian not know about this? I am so bad, master and disciple ..." Mu Qianxiang looked at the tightly shut door and couldn’t help but let his imagination run wild.

Chen Xiang and Liu Meng’er sat on the side of the bed as Chen Xiang held her extremely beautiful jade face and stared at her beautiful eyes that contained boundless gentleness.

"Elder Sister Meng’er, I missed you so much." Chen Xiang gently caressed her cheeks.

"Me too. It’s just that we’re not suitable right now." Liu Meng’er let out a faint sigh, and leaned into Chen Xiang’s embrace. "Little Scoundrel, all these years, you’ve been the only one who has made others worry. Only the little girl Xianxian is completely confident in you."

Chen Xiang lowered his head and kissed her lips. Liu Meng’er looked at her with a gaze as gentle as water, then closed his eyes and started to kiss Chen Xiang.

"Hmm ..." In the midst of kissing, Liu Meng’er suddenly felt a big hand reaching into his clothes, and couldn’t help but exclaim: "Scoundrel, your new recognized sister is still outside."

Chen Xiang reluctantly retracted his hand and wrapped his arm around Liu Meng’er’s waist, greedily sucking on her tongue. Very quickly, the two of them fell into an ungrateful kiss.

"Enough, your sister will definitely laugh if we go out." Her cheeks were slightly red, making them even more enchanting, causing Chen Xiang to be unable to resist kissing her jade-like smooth cheeks.

Liu Meng’er straightened his clothes, then walked out of his room. After opening the door, he saw Mu Qianxiang staring at them with a pair of big eyes that were filled with curiosity. He wanted to ask, but he didn’t dare to.

"We’re just going to talk in private." Chen Xiang covered up.

"I don’t believe it." Mu Qianxiang stuck out his tongue: "Bro, you’re actually a playboy too."

"Well, it’s just as you think. You mustn’t talk nonsense." Chen Xiang led the shy Liu Meng’er and sat at the table.

"Xiao Xiang, he and I have been together for a long time. Xianxian knows this as well, so don’t spout nonsense. Liu Meng’er smiled slightly, causing him to look at her in a daze.

"I know about Elder Sister Meng’er, I understand that. Can you tell me how many women this Brother Scoundrel is related to?" Mu Qianxiang suddenly became curious, and chuckled as he asked.

Liu Meng’er glanced at Chen Xiang, then chuckled: "I’ll tell you later. Let’s talk about the Sword Soul first, the person who cut off that person’s arm should be that little scoundrel, right?"
