As the Great Clan Elder of the Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect, he definitely had a lot of understanding about Dragon Demons. Dragon Demons were a big threat now, and Chen Xiang was very concerned about them, if he could get a clear understanding of Dragon Demons now, he could deal with them a little more easily in the future.

"This time, the dragon demon is different!" When Chen Xiang mentioned the Dragon Demon, the Great Clan Elder’s expression became serious, and he was worried.

Chen Xiang was also aware of this point. The Dragon Demon has the same ability as the Evil Soul, which can take over a human’s body and sneak into a human’s body.

"Is it because the Dragon Demons and Evil Soul are very similar?" Chen Xiang said, "Where exactly did the Dragon Demons come from? There are a lot of them! "

When Chen Xiang and Bat Super Venerable entered the Dragon Devil Dead Land, they had witnessed how the Dragon Demons were born.

"You have entered the Dragon Devil Dead Land before, right? Did you go in with Bat Super Venerable? What did you see inside? " Great Clan Elder asked: "Let’s go, I will bring you to Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect and talk to me on the way. Up until now, none of us have entered the Dragon Devil Dead Land, so we know nothing about it."

It could be said that Chen Xiang and Bat Super Venerable were the two people who entered the deepest part of the Dragon Devil Dead Land after the Dragon Devil Dead Land’s barrier disappeared.

"Alright!"

Chen Xiang boarded the flying disc that the Great Clan Elder used to talk about everything he saw in the Dragon Devil Dead Land in detail. The Great Clan Elder’s face was filled with fear when he heard it.

"This is too scary. These Dragon Demons have already reached such a stage of growth. This time, we’re in deep trouble!" Sigh, the Heavenly Alchemy Venerable Ancestor s of our Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect died in vain back then. " The Great Elder shook his head and sighed, his face filled with frustration.

"What does that mean? "What on earth is so scary about that pit?" Chen Xiang asked, he knew that there was something powerful down there, but he did not know what it was.

"The Dragon Devil Emperor Venerable is down there! This guy actually did not die. Back then, the Four Great Divine Sects’s Ancestor was this guy who was fighting, but I never expected him to not be completely killed, and now, he is actually alive again. " The Great Elder replied, "It’s alright to be alive, but to evolve to such a terrifying state, the Dragon Demons that he condensed are as powerful as the Evil Soul. This time, we’ll have trouble!"

"We only thought that the Dragon Demons that appeared now were the ones that weren’t killed and sealed. We never thought that they were all new breeds bred by the Dragon Devil Emperor Venerable."

Dragon Devil Emperor Venerable!

Chen Xiang’s heart skipped a beat. The person he had previously met with Bat Super Venerable was very likely to be the same person as his Dragon Devil Emperor Venerable, the guy who was surrounded and killed by the four powerful ancestors!

It could be said that he and Bat Super Venerable were truly lucky to be able to return alive!

Right now, the Great Clan Elder was looking at Chen Xiang with this kind of expression, as if saying, "You’re really lucky"!

"Are they fast enough for Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect? Great Clan Elder, do you have any revered ancestor level fellows in your Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect? If we don’t, then aren’t we done for? " Chen Xiang said.

"Of course! After so many years had passed, the Four Great Divine Sects would always have a senior presiding over them, and there would be more than one of them! However, the current ancestor’s strength could not compare to the Heavenly Alchemy Venerable Ancestor back then ... But with a lot of numbers, it should be enough to suppress that Dragon Devil Emperor Venerable! " The Great Clan Elder said, "In the first place, the Flying Dragon Pagoda was created by suppressing the Dragon Devil Emperor Venerable. The people who refined the Flying Dragon Pagoda thought that the Flying Dragon Pagoda could only suppress the Dragon Devil Emperor Venerable for a short period of time, which was why they left such a huge and vast amount of resources in the Flying Dragon Pagoda."

"In this way, it would attract a large number of humans, and with the limitless resources inside becoming more and more powerful, they would be able to suppress the Dragon Devil Emperor Venerable."

To think that the Flying Dragon Pagoda had such a goal, Chen Xiang did not expect it at all. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"The person who refined the Flying Dragon Pagoda is really powerful! But can he not kill Dragon Devil Emperor Venerable even though he was able to refine such a thing? " Chen Xiang was very curious about this.

"I don’t know about that. In short, I found out about it from the Heavenly Alchemy Venerable Ancestor’s mouth. As for who was the one that refined the Flying Dragon Pagoda, we don’t even know ... However, I do know that the Flying Dragon Pagoda and the Flying Dragon Pagoda were created by the same person, and our Four Great Divine Sects participated in the construction. " The Great Clan Elder replied, "At that time, I was still a child and my elders were all involved in the construction. However, they kept a tight mouth and did not tell me much about the details.

Chen Xiang was very excited to hear such a secret message from the Great Clan Elder.

"The Four Great Divine Sects participated in the construction of the Myriad Tao Mausoleum, but they wanted to enter the Myriad Tao Mausoleum to look for treasures. This sounds rather strange." Chen Xiang laughed.

"It is indeed... The main reason is that the people who will be participating in the construction of the Myriad Tao Mausoleum will be the seniors in our current group, and most of them are already dead. The Great Elder sighed helplessly. "I don’t know if this will harm or benefit the descendants. After all, many people have obtained many good things from it."

Every time the Myriad Tao Mausoleum opened it, many people would die inside, and only those with good luck and strength would be able to come out alive. It was said that as long as they could go in and survive successfully, their future life would be extremely comfortable.

Of course, this was only rumoured to be true, as Chen Xiang had seen a few people from the Myriad Tao Mausoleum who did not have a good life, such as Lin Jitian!

"Great Clan Elder, you have entered the Myriad Tao Mausoleum before, what kind of treasures did you get from there?" Chen Xiang was very curious.

"Heh heh, I’ve been in there three times already, and I’ve been able to come out alive every time! I’ve picked up a lot of Heavenly Alchemy rule Beads s, around a hundred of them. " The Great Elder said.

"What, it’s so easy to pick up!" Chen Xiang found it hard to believe, the heaven refined rules were so precious, but this Great Clan Elder could pick up over a hundred of them.

In short, you think that those very precious Law beads are like stones in the Myriad Tao Mausoleum, and can easily come across them. Therefore, this is also the reason why many people would want to enter. " The Great Clan Elder laughed, "That depends on your luck. However, those who enter will be able to see some of them!" Actually, most of those who died in there died fighting over it. "

"Only the unlucky kind will trigger the mechanism inside, and then die a horrible death inside, or be trapped inside and devoured by the Evil Soul."

What Chen Xiang knew was that Lin Jitian had fought because of the fight, and it was mainly because of the strange six divine sticks that Lin Jitian had obtained.

While they were chatting, time unknowingly passed. The speed of the Frisbee was also very fast. They had already entered a desolate land filled with sand.

"Is Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect in here?" Chen Xiang looked around, the atmosphere was lifeless and lifeless, moreover, it was extremely hot. Occasionally, a few poisonous creatures would crawl out from the desert.
