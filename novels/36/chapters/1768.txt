Originally, it should have benefited the Nine Heaven World. However, right now, it has been coveted by the divine halls, and if it is taken over by those powerful forces and their control over the dragon veins, the rest of the Nine Heaven World will not benefit from it. "

Chen Xiang floated in front of the dragon’s head, patiently waiting for the next change in the dragon’s vein, while thinking about the formation of the dragon’s vein.

He felt that the reason why dragon veins kept appearing was definitely not a coincidence. It must have been arranged by the Nine Divine Kings back then, and they had long since set it up here.

In the past, Qi Shi also obtained a dragon vein, but it was destroyed later on, and an even more powerful one developed. Other than this, there was another dragon vein that was occupied by Feng Yujie.

Feng Yujie knew that the place had dragon veins, obviously he had heard it from the Nine Divine Kings.

"What will happen next? According to my intuition, I should be able to fuse with this dragon fountain." Chen Xiang thought like this. The energy contained in this dragon vein was extremely strong, and he felt that he might not even be able to eat it, so when he thought about it, he felt that it was somewhat impossible.

Just as Chen Xiang was thinking about the matter regarding the dragon fountain, he suddenly heard a voice from inside the Divine Sense Sea.

"Of course you can’t fuse with me with your current power. Even Empyrean Gods might not be able to subdue me."

This voice was somewhat tender, just like a youth’s. Although Chen Xiang was shocked by what he heard, he immediately understood that it was the voice of the dragon vein.

The dragon vein had actually opened its spirit and gained its own consciousness. In other words, the dragon vein was no longer just like a stone. Soon, the purple monkey would turn into a living creature that could soar through the nine heavens.

"You are the dragon fountain." Chen Xiang asked in shock.

"That’s right, you should have been my master originally. You should have merged me before I was even growing up so that I could make you stronger. I have been waiting for you for many years, but you just arrived now. I don’t know why, but I am getting stronger and stronger now, and I don’t want you to fuse with me." The dragon vein said.

Chen Xiang said: Don’t worry, I won’t force you, after all, you have helped us become strong for a period of time, I will remember this favor, as long as you do not fall into an evil trap, you were born from the Ninth Heaven, with your current strength, you should be the guardian of this place.

"I have nine fathers, and the consciousness they sent me was the same as well. However, they did not directly ask me to protect them, and instead wanted me to help a human that I approved of become stronger." Dragon Mai said, "But it seems like I can’t do it now. I’ve violated them."

Chen Xiang knew how complicated the Dragon Bloodline was in his heart now that it had grown to this point. It was normal for it to have its own thoughts, and adding the yearning it had for the outside world, he would be able to understand it.

"As long as you can protect the Nine Heaven World, it doesn’t count as going against them. This is your nine fathers final goal, it doesn’t matter what the method is, as long as you can do it." Chen Xiang continued to instruct the young dragon.

"I understand now, thank you for understanding me. You are the first human I’ve seen since I’ve awakened. Before, when I was still sleeping, I vaguely recognized you. I’m not mistaken, why don’t you give me a name?"

Chen Xiang thought for a moment, then said: "You can be considered a dragon now, that surname is Long, it’s called Nine Heavens, hmm, I’ll call it Dragon Nine Heavens."

If Long Xueyi was here, he would definitely argue with Chen Xiang because of the name.

"I know your name is Chen Xiang. A lot of people were shouting and shouting about you just now." Long Jiu smiled. "Although I can’t merge with you, I can still help you become a little stronger. I’ll have to separate from the earth later. At that time, the earth’s core will spew out a power that can make your body stronger."

Chen Xiang’s current physical body was not strong enough, only at the level of the purple-gold bone, but his goal was the jade bone. To have such a chance, it would be best if he could, if he wanted to become a True God, he would need to cultivate the jade bone.

"Alright." Chen Xiang nodded.

He had just agreed when Long Jiu suddenly roared and rushed into the clouds.

The entire body of the dragon suddenly shot out, and the deep hole spewed out a strong surge of heat, accompanied by a burst of intense flames.

Chen Xiang who was at the side, was immediately sucked in by the heat.

"The earth’s core is repairing itself and absorbing the energy that is gushing out. Before entering the earth’s core, you must hurry up and come up, otherwise, it will be very dangerous for you to go to the earth’s core." Long Jiu’s voice came from above.

It wasn’t that Chen Xiang had never gone to the Core of the Earth before, it was just that the Core of the Earth was much weaker than the Core of the Earth now. The reason why Di Tian had become so strong now was mainly because the Core of the Earth was becoming stronger and stronger.

Therefore, right now, he was not sure if the profoundwu diamond armour on his body could still allow him to be like a fish in water in the heart of the earth.

"The Fire Dragon Sword was also created by the Nine Divine Kings in the past. No wonder when I was in the earth’s core that year, after I took out the Fire Dragon Sword, all of the magma in the earth’s core retreated. I wonder if it is still effective now."

Chen Xiang wanted to give it a try. Right now, the earth’s core was also very mysterious to him. The last time he went to the earth’s core, he killed a Earth tree.

"Alright, let’s go to the Core." Chen Xiang was slowly being pulled down by a strong suction force inside the tunnel, and a strange kind of scorching energy was being continuously absorbed by his body.

"What’s with this heat? Although it’s very painful, but it also has a bit of a pain-relieving power."

Chen Xiang couldn’t tell if he was in pain or not, he just felt a little numb in his body. Suddenly, he felt pain, but the pain quickly disappeared as it quickly changed places again.

A moment later, Long Jiu’s urgent shout came from the sky, "Hurry up."

"I want to go to the Earth’s core to have a look. It’ll be fine, go take a look for now, if you can find someone called Huang Jintian, let him teach you something, he’s my master." Chen Xiang said.

"The earth’s core is very dangerous and very scary. If you stay below, you will die." Long Jiu was extremely worried, and Chen Xiang could also feel the energy undulations from his body. He was actually going to use that powerful force to pull him up.

"Don’t worry, I have magical equipment to protect myself. I’ve been to the earth’s core before." Chen Xiang said anxiously, he was afraid that he would miss this chance, if not, he would have to go to the center of the earth.

"Alright, I will look for Huang Jintian now." After Long Jiu finished speaking, he disappeared.

When the dragon veins left the ground, they created a huge sky ditch, and Chen Xiang also went into the center of the earth from the sky ditch.

When the Geocentric Eclipse closed the hole, a large amount of lava surged out, filling up the entire pit. There was even a large amount of fire that was multi-colored, even black and gold, that enveloped the entire Holy City.

If Chen Xiang saw this, he would definitely find this very familiar, because this was a Earth’s Core Fire Realm.
