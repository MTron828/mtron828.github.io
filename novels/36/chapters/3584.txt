Little White Fox was a strange beast bred by Supreme Mantra and she was very interested in these incantations as well. Therefore, when Xiao Xianglin taught the Legendary mantra, he only needed to engrave them into a piece of crystal so that Little White Fox could see and understand them for himself. If there was anything she didn’t understand, she would ask Xiao Xianglin.

Xiao Xianglin had also gotten the Supreme Mantra from Little White Fox. What made her surprised was that Little White Fox had actually mastered two types of Supreme Mantra.

Little White Fox had also killed a Paternoster beast before. She had eaten the other party’s crystal core, so she had obtained the Paternoster beast’s Supreme Mantra.

"Master, what kind of use does the Supreme Mantra Junior Sister gave you?" Chen Xiang asked curiously, Little White Fox had already entered the Time array to learn.

"She didn’t tell me. Right now, I will let my two clones temporarily stop learning Legendary mantra s and go learn these two Supreme Mantra s first! Learning Supreme Mantra should be a lot faster, so I can help you create World Defying Dan grain sooner. " Xiao Xianglin said.

Afterwards, she let the two clones start learning Supreme Mantra s, while her original body started to familiarize herself with the Time Incantation, the Rebirth Incantation and the derived incantation. These three incantations were extremely difficult to learn, and even though she had learnt it, she was not very familiar with it yet.

Xiao Xianglin entered the You Yao Mountain Villa and used the Six Realms mirrors s’ Time Formation. Feng Ke’er also entered to learn the Tao-creation’s incantation.

Chen Xiang didn’t do nothing when he was outside alone. He asked He Fengyuan to come out and see if the strange flowers and herbs that Little White Fox grew had any great uses.

Little White Fox had said before that he could eat anything she grew here as long as it didn’t kill him.

Chen Xiang had a taste too and they were all very tasty.

"They are all medicinal herbs, but most of them are middle grade Tao-creation Divine Medicines. Because they are for eating, the medicinal herbs are not suitable for refining pills." He Fengyuan was also eating a fruit.

Chen Xiang also understood that if the medicinal herbs could be used for pill refining, it would not be so easy to break it with one’s teeth! Some of the medicinal materials used for alchemy were even tougher than divine weapons.

"Junior definitely knows that there are high grade Tao-creation Divine Medicines, I will ask her about it when she comes out." Chen Xiang said, he took the opportunity to enter the Six Realms mirrors’s Time Formation, there were only Xiao Xianglin and Feng Ke’er, coincidentally three people inside.

If there were one or two more people, the Time Formation would become very unstable, so it was best for it to not exceed three.

"Master, teach me the Tao-creation’s incantation." Chen Xiang hugged onto Xiao Xianglin’s soft arm, and chuckled. "You’re not really too busy right?"

"Alright, alright, I’ll teach you now!" Xiao Xianglin tapped his forehead with his finger, then began to instruct Chen Xiang on how to learn the Tao-creation’s Incantation.

Chen Xiang did not even learn the Space mantra well, but under Xiao Xianglin’s guidance, he actually mastered it quickly.

Now that Xiao Xianglin had mastered all of the Tao-creation’s incantations and also learned a Legendary mantra, she could be said to be a grandmaster in the field of incantations. This caused her to have a deeper understanding of the various incantations, which was why when she guided others in learning, she was always able to enlighten them, and very smoothly and quickly inscribe the Tao-creation’s incantations.

Unknowingly, Chen Xiang had learnt the seventh stage of the Tao-creation’s Incantation, which was also known as the Time Incantation.

He had learned all the Flying mantra, Space mantra s, sonic wave incantations and Fusion spell s in front of him, and could completely inscribe them.

"With teacher’s guidance, not only will you learn quickly, you won’t feel bored and time will pass." Chen Xiang looked at Xiao Xianglin’s beautiful face and laughed.

"Little Scoundrel, be serious." Xiao Xianglin rolled her eyes at Chen Xiang. Long ago, Chen Xiang had suddenly kissed her lips, so she had always been on her guard against him.

"Master, you’re so beautiful. The more I look at you, the more beautiful you look." Chen Xiang laughed.

Xiao Xianglin walked over, and grabbed onto the flesh on his waist, and said coquettishly: "Be a little more honest, do you believe that I won’t ask You You to come out and discipline you?"

"It hurts!" Chen Xiang pretended to be in pain and hugged Xiao Xianglin’s waist, bringing her closer.

Xiao Xianglin was not as strong as him, even if he struggled, it was useless. However, he was still hugged by Chen Xiang.

"Little Scoundrel, I’m not done with you." Xiao Xianglin randomly pinched the flesh on Chen Xiang’s body: "You You You, save me."

When Chen Xiang saw Xiao Xianglin calling out to Bai Youyou, he immediately let go of his hands and said with a twitch of his mouth: "I was just messing around with you!"

Xiao Xianglin snorted angrily as he pinched the flesh off of Chen Xiang’s body, "This time, I’ll let you go. If there’s a next time, I’ll definitely let You You and Meiyao teach you a lesson."

Chen Xiang was also a little afraid, so he immediately became more honest. He really only wanted to play with Xiao Xianglin just now.

The Time Formation had already been inside for a thousand years, while the outside had only been for ten days. Chen Xiang was inside learning the Tao-creation’s incantation, and he did not feel that time had passed, furthermore, he had the beautiful master Xiao Xianglin accompanying him.

"Alright, I’ve already grasped those two Supreme Mantra." Xiao Xianglin replied: "It’s really hard to learn."

Under Xiao Xianglin’s guidance, Chen Xiang had already mastered all of the Tao-creation’s incantations. He was secretly glad that Xiao Xianglin was a Heavenly Incantation Master, if not he would not know how long he would have to learn it.

After grasping the Tao-creation’s incantation well, it would be even easier for him to learn the World Defying Dan grain. Even if there was a Supreme Mantra among the World Defying Dan grain, it would not hinder him in the slightest.

When Chen Xiang came out of the Time Formation, his cave had a little change. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

"Has it turned cold? It has only been less than ten days! " Chen Xiang said with a frown, then he told Little White Fox who was inside the Time array.

It was not easy for Little White Fox to learn Legendary mantra, as she did not have Xiao Xianglin’s talent, so her learning speed was much slower. Fortunately, with Xiao Xianglin’s guidance, she could master it after learning for a while.

"Danger!" The moment Little White Fox came out, her expression changed immediately. "We need to leave this place as soon as possible."

"What’s the danger?" Chen Xiang anxiously asked, as Little White Fox began to clean up the strange flowers and herbs that she grew.

Chen Xiang called He Fengyuan and Mei Jing Sisters out to help her pack. There were a lot of strange plants here, and it would take her a long time to pack them all.

Little White Fox also didn’t have the time to ask who these three beautiful women were.

He Fengyuan had often come into contact with medicinal ingredients when he was with the Mei Jing Sisters, so they were very familiar with digging through strange flowers and herbs. Seeing this, Little White Fox became more at ease.

"Senior Brother, who are they? Why did it suddenly appear? " Little White Fox could not resist asking.

"My friends, they are usually in my Divine Sense Sea World. They are extremely proficient in growing these strange flowers and herbs." Chen Xiang said. In order to increase his speed, Xiao Xianglin asked Xiang’er and Yu’er to come out. The two of them were both his maids, and the moment they appeared, Chen Xiang would introduce them to Little White Fox.

"Junior Sister, what danger is outside?" Chen Xiang originally wanted to go out and take a look, but Little White Fox refused to let him.
