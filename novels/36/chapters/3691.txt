was most surprised that the people of the Thunder-creation Sacred Race could grasp such a large number of Legendary mantra.

"The Supreme Mantra in the east region are nothing to worry about, but the large barrier that covers the entire Villa is formed from the mixture of over a dozen Supreme Mantra and two Legendary mantra," Xiao Xianglin said. I can sense a little bit of it, so let’s determine the location. "

"There are more than ten of them!" Feng Ke’er said.

Then the two of them took out a piece of paper and drew a map.

Han Xiaoying exclaimed: "They are truly powerful, but they are so clear about this place."

Chen Xiang laughed: "It’s all thanks to them, I can only be safe these past few years!"

After Xiao Xianglin and Feng Ke’er confirmed the killing array, Chen Xiang also saw a clear path.

"It’s dark tonight, so I’ll go and try." Chen Xiang’s mysterious body suddenly saw someone coming, and anxiously said: "Someone is coming, is this guy a middle-aged man, the grandson of the Emperor?"

"That’s right!" Han Xiaoying nodded his head, "Let’s get out of here quickly."

Feng Ke’er and Xiao Xianglin anxiously entered the You Yao Mountain Villa, Han Xiaoying brought Chen Xiang out of the room and went outside.

Chen Xiang followed behind Han Xiaoying and strolled in the courtyard. At the same time, they told Chen Xiang about some things related to the Emperor.

The clan emperor’s grandson was called Lin Tianshuo, and was also at the peak of the World Defying Stage Legendary Rank. He was extremely sinister and ruthless, had countless women, and was also a very brutal person. It was said that he had to kill at least one person every day, and was happy without any blood.

No wonder Han Xiaoying was so depressed before, and even had thoughts of suicide.

With a kick, Lin Tianshuo smashed the door of the house, then walked in fiercely. Especially when he looked at Chen Xiang, his killing intent surged, and he almost wanted to tear Chen Xiang into shreds.

"Lin Tianshuo, what’s wrong with you today?" Han Xiaoying really hated Lin Tianshuo.

"What is the purpose of your father’s dog follower coming here?" Lin Tianshuo looked at Chen Xiang. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

When Lin Tianshuo entered, his gaze did not leave Chen Xiang, which made Chen Xiang’s hair stand on end. Lin Tianshuo was already middle-aged. Although his looks were not bad, he was too ferocious, causing him to look very scary.

"My father only arranged for Shen Fei to come because he wanted to repay the kindness of his friends." Han Xiaoying’s tone of voice was indifferent, and it was far from the kind and gentle tone he had when conversing with Chen Xiang.

"I won’t allow it!" Lin Tianshuo said angrily: "If it’s a woman, then forget it, but how is it proper for a man to be a man? You are a woman that you want to marry to Lin Tianshuo, yet you are with a male follower! He doesn’t look like much, but I’m worried about him. "

Chen Xiang had only changed to a very ordinary appearance. If he had revealed his true handsome appearance, this Lin Tianshuo would have definitely charged over the moment he entered the door.

"Am I not even free to do that?" Han Xiaoying bellowed, her eyebrows knitted.

"He can stay here, but I’ll castrate him myself." Lin Tianshuo laughed coldly, and had already taken out a blade: "For your sake, I’ll give him three paths! The first path, if you scram to the edge of Divine Thunder Mountain Villa, I guarantee that you will be able to save your little life and get out! "

"The second way, I will castrate him. I have a special method that guarantees that he will have his roots cut off forever."

Lin Tianshuo’s words made Han Xiaoying both embarrassed and angry, but at the same time, made him feel disgusted.

"He won’t choose either path, I want him to stay by my side." When Han Xiaoying released his aura, the peak Legendary gas felt chilled to the bone, causing Chen Xiang’s entire body to turn cold.

"Humph!" Can you beat me? " Lin Tianshuo laughed coldly.

"Wait, I have a third option!" Chen Xiang suddenly shouted: "I guarantee that I can satisfy everyone!"

"Speak. If I am not satisfied, I will crush your head." Lin Tianshuo bellowed.

Chen Xiang took out a silver dagger that was as white as ice, while his two clones suddenly flashed out, surrounding Lin Tianshuo.

"Doppelgänger mantra, Legendary mantra!" Lin Tianshuo was shocked. He wanted to roar, but was suddenly restricted by three pressure, making it hard for him to move at all.

Lin Tianshuo’s power was very strong and violent, it was worthy of being the descendant of the clan emperor. Chen Xiang felt that his pressure wall could only seal Lin Tianshuo for a few moments.

But these few moments were more than enough!

He rushed forward, the white dagger in his hand releasing cold Qi, he thrusted out a few times, causing Lin Tianshuo’s entire body to be pierced, the place that was stabbed did not bleed, but was covered in black Qi.

This only happened after being pierced by the Chuangyuan key!

"Chuangyuan key!" Lin Tianshuo shouted with a trembling voice.

"If I kill you on this path, you will definitely be satisfied to become a dead man!" Chen Xiang smiled.

There was no way for a dead person to not be satisfied!

Han Xiaoying was stunned, the descendants of the royal family were killed just like that! Furthermore, it was inside the Divine Thunder Mountain Villa! This time, Thunder-creation Sacred Race would definitely go crazy, she knew that Ice-creation Sacred Race would not be able to withstand Thunder-creation Sacred Race’s anger.

"Xiaoying, I’ll bring you with me right now. You can enter my Divine Sense Sea World." Chen Xiang said.

Han Xiaoying regained her senses, she could not care about anything else, she could only listen to Chen Xiang’s arrangements and enter Chen Xiang’s You Yao Mountain Villa.

Chen Xiang ordered one of his clones to cast an Invisibility Spell and scout ahead. He followed the route on the map and avoided the hidden killing array.

His original body followed behind him. If his avatar was fine, then he would be fine.

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!

Suddenly, thunder rumbled in the sky above Divine Thunder Mountain Villa. Lightning filled the sky, and soon after, lightning spread across the entire Divine Thunder Holy City!

After Lin Tianshuo died, the life orb cracked open. This was immediately known to Thunder-creation Sacred Race, who knew that the clan emperor who was hiding in the middle region was currently filled with raging thunder, as if the entire Most Ancient Era was trembling due to his anger.

"I have to leave quickly!" Chen Xiang increased his pace, and quickly penetrated through many enchantments.

After a while, he finally broke through the last barrier of the Divine Thunder Mountain Villa and arrived outside the streets. He then took out the Six Realms mirrors that Xiao Xianglin had refined and quickly flew up on it.

Not long after he left Divine Thunder Holy City, a gigantic lightning barrier covered the entire city, which had already been sealed.

"We finally made it out!" Chen Xiang let out a sigh, then said: "Master, check if there is anything that is being followed within Xiaoying’s body."

"I’ve already seen it before. You can rest assured that it doesn’t exist." Xiao Xianglin said: "Leave Divine Thunder Holy City for now! One of my clones will enter the Time array with Xiaoying and help her remove the seal. "

Only after Han Xiaoying’s seal is broken, will her blood be useful, and at that time, Han Xiaoying would have the power to defy the heavens and suppress all the other Creation Race s in the world.

Han Xiaoying, who was with Xiao Xianglin, was still in a state of shock. She had difficulty understanding, for people like Chen Xiang and Xiao Xianglin, whose cultivation was not high, to have such a strong power, to be able to retreat from the Divine Thunder Mountain Villa safely even after killing Lin Tianshuo. If she did not personally experience this, she would never believe that it was true.
