"Why do you want to go to Long Tian?" Chen Xiang was preparing to go to Long Tian for the Evil Emperor.

"My parents said that they were invited, but we don’t know who it is, there will be a lot of people going, and Imperial Dragon Clan will also go." Liu Meng’er said, "Are you going to Long Tian as well?"

Chen Xiang nodded his head, "But I don’t know who exactly invited your parents and why you guys are going there."

"Then what’s the purpose of you, Long Tian? We’re going to look for the refining materials. Long Tian has a place with a lot of them." Xue Xianxian asked.

"The Heavenly evil sword guided me there. I don’t know the specifics, so I wanted to take a look." Chen Xiang replied truthfully.

"Heavenly evil sword." Liu Meng’er and Xue Xianxian were both a little surprised. They looked at each other, puzzled.

"Yes, there should be something left behind by the Evil Emperor at that place." Chen Xiang sent sound transmissions to them, and his tone was very serious.

"I wonder if it was from the same place that invited my parents to Long Tian. The people who came from the Sacred Source Ancient Realm, are spread throughout the nine heavens, and they were mainly searching for various kinds of refining materials. They found a place in Long Tian’s more dangerous location, and there is a high chance that there are a large amount of refining materials there."

"They seem to have invited quite a few people as well. In short, my father and mother said that there wouldn’t be any danger there, which was why they brought Xianxian and I along." Liu Meng’er said.

"In other words, they’re not in the same place." Chen Xiang muttered to himself.

"Hopefully, it’s not a good thing to be in the same place." Liu Meng’er said.

"Exactly, in the same place, the good stuff will definitely be taken away by you." Xue Xianxian laughed.

"I have obtained good materials for refining, but I’m not giving them to you yet." Last time, Chen Xiang entrusted Hua Xiangyue to bring Liu Meng’er and the others a lot of refining materials, they were all gathered by him.

Chen Xiang laughed: "I’m leaving, can you let me hug you guys?"

"No." Liu Meng’er’s jade face slightly flushed. Looking at how Chen Xiang opened his arms, he seemed to want to hug them at the same time.

Although she said it like that, Chen Xiang had already embraced them all with a laugh, causing the two girls to pout non-stop and lightly beat Chen Xiang’s chest.

"How about I stay here for the night?" Chen Xiang laughed sinisterly.

"No." Xue Xianxian spat with a red face. She knew what Chen Xiang was thinking.

"Hurry up, this is still Divine Sword Palace’s place." Liu Meng’er’s jade face flushed red as she urged him.

Chen Xiang laughed: "It’s not convenient here, if there’s a chance in the future ...."

Before he finished speaking, Chen Xiang was blasted out of the hall by Xue Xianxian and Liu Meng’er. Chen Xiang left their residence and walked out of the Divine Sword Palace by himself.

The somewhat disappointed Chen Xiang walked out of the Divine Sword Palace. The moment he walked out, a few people suddenly surrounded him. Their strengths were not weak, they were all in the Late period of human immortal. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

It was obviously easy for Chen Xiang to get rid of them, but he wanted to see who exactly had caught him.

After entering the luxurious carriage, Chen Xiang saw a handsome youth seated on a luxurious chair. This man was Luo Yitao, who had an engagement with Liu Meng’er.

"What do you want to talk to Liu Meng’er about, quickly say it." Luo Yitao bellowed, his face was extremely serious, and it could be seen that he cared a lot about Liu Meng’er, although he had said those words to Liu Meng’er previously.

"Your relationship with her isn’t ordinary, right? I saw that she was angry and wanted to hit me, hmph."

Although Luo Yitao was arrogant, she was not an idiot. Previously, when she had angered Liu Meng’er in the living room, she had felt an even greater rage coming from his body. It was just that Chen Xiang had concealed it extremely well, but he had still been able to see through it.

"You want to know." Chen Xiang asked coldly.

"Oh, looks like you’re quite amazing. Don’t tell me you want to resist me here." Luo Yitao laughed coldly: "Quickly, tell me, what is your relationship with Liu Meng’er? Why are you sneaking around to find her?"

"Ask your ancestor." Chen Xiang roared out, his body trembling, he released a powerful shockwave, causing the Late period of human immortal beside him to scream out in pain, and fly out of the carriage.

"Bastard, it’s not like I’ve offended you. Why did you grab me when you had nothing to do, and you still want to torture me?" Chen Xiang shouted angrily, he had already disappeared, and suddenly appeared in front of Luo Yitao.

Luo Yitao was still firmly seated on that luxurious chair, a cold smile plastered all over his face. He was not surprised at all, as if he had predicted that Chen Xiang would have such a reaction.

Chen Xiang raised his palm and slapped it fiercely towards Luo Yitao. Luo Yitao snorted, and a very strong Qi barrier appeared on his body. When Chen Xiang’s palm landed on the Qi barrier, the angry and violent power instantly disappeared without a trace, as it was completely absorbed by the Qi barrier.

"Hmph, at most, you only have the strength of Late period of human immortal, even if you are a Immortal Monarch, you still won’t be able to shake my defense, I am half a step into the Immortal King realm, you are just a relatively rough little thing."

Luo Yitao’s face was filled with disdain, he had extremely strong armor, adding on that he was from a famous clan, his talent was outstanding, he cultivated in all kinds of powerful cultivation techniques, and when he saw that Chen Xiang’s palm attack could not harm him, he looked down on Chen Xiang even more.

The carriage had already been destroyed, and the bystanders were all shocked to see someone attacking in the street, especially at the entrance of Divine Sword Palace.

"I’ll give you one more chance. If you still don’t answer me, I’ll break your arms, take off all your clothes, and hang them on my carriage as I circle around Divine Sword Palace ten times." Luo Yitao’s face turned gloomy, he was not afraid of Divine Sword Palace at all.

Chen Xiang took a deep breath, and raged in his heart: Little Naughty Dragon, lend me your strength, I will strangle this bastard to death.

After Long Xueyi felt Chen Xiang’s anger, he had already mentally prepared himself and she had been waiting this whole time.

Both Liu Meng’er and Xue Xianxian could hear that roar from inside. They immediately guessed that Chen Xiang must have clashed with someone, and it was very likely that it belonged to Luo Yitao.

Liu Meng’er and Xue Xianxian, the elders that followed the Divine Sword Palace anxiously ran out, and immediately saw the furious Chen Xiang standing on the dilapidated carriage, clenching his fists.

On the other hand, Luo Yitao was proudly sitting in a luxurious chair, looking at Chen Xiang with disdain.

"Luo Yitao, what are you doing?" Liu Meng’er was furious, she knew that Chen Xiang would not provoke Luo Yitao for no reason.

Luo Yitao replied indifferently: "I just want to know why he came to find you. You and I have an engagement, I want to know your every move, but this guy has a tough mouth and bad temper."

She had already reached the limit of her endurance and Xue Xianxian was already prepared to take action.

Chen Xiang had already poured in a large amount of Dragon Power s into his arm, and they were all channeled over by Long Xueyi. The muscles on his face twitched slightly, and he roared: "Hey Luo, let me tell you, my fists are tougher."

After saying that, Chen Xiang threw out a punch, but Luo Yitao’s face was filled with a cold smile, he did not place this punch in his eyes at all.
