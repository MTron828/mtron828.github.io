Chen Xiang wanted to try kissing the two beauty at the same time. However, he dared not propose it. After all, if angered them into leaving him, he would lose lot more than he could gain.

And who to kiss first was also a problem. Chen Xiang, gazing at their stunning faces, wondered in his mind who to kiss first.

“Hurry up!” Su Meiyao urged Chen Xiang. She could not stand his fervent gaze.

Is there a difference as to who I kissed? Chen Xiang, gazing a Su Meiyao, broke into mischievous laughter as he said, “Sister Meiyao, we have kissed once already, as such you have some experience in it. Let’s demonstrate before Sister Youyou once, so that she won’t be so nervous.”

Hearing this, a tint of red immediately appeared on Bai Youyou’s face as she rolled her eyes at Chen Xiang.

“Watching you and that master and apprentice duo kissing so many times, I and Senior Sister have already grown numb!” Su Meiyao said, giggling. She was quite open about this. She was rather familiar with Chen Xiang. Furthermore, she also liked Chen Xiang a bit.

Seeing Chen Xiang getting closer, Su Meiyao’s heart also started racing. A tint of red appeared on her face, adding much to her charm. She slowly closed her pretty eyes, only to feel Chen Xiang’s arm getting around her waist.

Chen Xiang said with a chuckle, “Sister Meiyao, it’s been a long while!” He took a long whiff out of the sweet fragrance wafting off Su Meiyao’s body as he pressed his lips against hers and pried open her lips with his tongue.

Su Meiyao also went along with Chen Xiang, allowing her tongue to intwine around Chen Xiang’s. Immediately a bizarre numbing sensation coursed through her entire body, giving rise to an inexplicable euphoria. She could not help but tightly hug Chen Xiang, pressing her tender body against Chen Xiang’s robust body tightly. She could not wait to become one with Chen Xiang.

Watching Su Meiyao getting aroused, the nearby Bai Youyou also found it unbelievable. However, imagining herself acting like the same with Chen Xiang, she felt very tensed and afraid, but there was a bit of anticipation as well. She felt extremely conflicted. Her heart was gripped with complex emotions.

A stunner like Su Meiyao had evoked the most primitive desire of Chen Xiang’s. However, he also knew that he couldn’t go too far, for Su Meiyao was a peerless expert; she was aloof!

Chen Xiang could not cross the line, otherwise, there would be awkwardness between them in the future.

At present, he found it quite sufficient already. Although they were just kissing, he felt incomparably satisfied. What made him unusually excited was the fact that Bai Youyou was watching them.

The tightly embracing Chen Xiang and Su Meiyao were totally engrossed in the wonderful pleasure of kissing. Having tasted the sweetness last time, she had always hoping to try it again. However, it was rather difficult to voice out her opinion. And later, when she saw Chen Xiang passionately kissing Xue Xianxian often, she felt jealous.

The two finally parted, God knows after how long. Chen Xiang, watching Su Meiyao with deep love, this ravishing beauty, he felt inexplicably satisfied.

A drunk look filled Su Meiyao’s eyes, glittering with complex emotions. She licked her lips as she tenderly snorted. “Little Rascal, just now, you couldn’t wait to eat this Elder Sister completely, so dangerous!”

Chen Xiang pursed his lips into a mischevious smile as he touched Su Meiyao’s face. “Sister Meiyao, it felt good, right!”

Su Meiyao smacked Chen Xiang’s arm away immediately as she let out a harrumph before returning back to the ring.

Bai Youyou, on the other hand, was standing in a daze. At this moment, she felt like a deer, tensed and panic-stricken. After all, it would the first time for her to do such intimate things with a man. Because of this, the iceberg temperament of her had disappeared suddenly. Although her face still bore the ice-cold look, in Chen Xiang’s eyes, she was a naive and inexperienced girl.

Chen Xiang started walking towards Bai Youyou. In fact, he was more nervous that Bai Youyou, a bit terrified too. He was afraid that Bai Youyou would suddenly return, leaving his lips to kiss the empty air only; which he would regret his entire life.

“Sister Youyou...if you don’t want to do it with me, I won’t force you! And don’t worry, I will never blame you,” Chen Xiang said, as gently as possible. His eyes, filled with deep love, were staring at Bai Youyou.

Bai Youyou pursed her lips ever so lightly. Of course, she knew what was going on in Chen Xiang’s mind. Although he was saying this, it was quite evident that he wanted to kiss her very much

“Sister Youyou, you are a saintess in my eyes, I...” Chen Xiang had yet to finish his sentence before Bai Youyou raised her head. Those ice cold eyes of her had already melted away. As she looked at Chen Xiang, all that left in her eyes were tender feelings. Much to Chen Xiang’s surprise, she took the initiative and stood on her toes before pressing her lips against his and then, wrapping her arms around Chen Xiang’s robust body ever so tightly.

In that very moment, Chen Xiang’s mind went completely blank. The same was true for Bai Youyou. However, Chen Xiang pushed his tongue out unconsciously, leading along that inexperienced tongue of Bai Youyou, teasing her so that she won’t be so rough and shy.

It may have been the first time for Bai Youyou to kiss a man, she had done sufficient preparations already. She knew what to do. At this point, she also actively took part in it. She let her soft and fragrant tongue intwine with Chen Xiang’s. The two hugged each tightly, kissing each other unwittingly. The two wanted to melt the other and then fuse into one.

Chen Xiang was sucking Bai Youyou’s tongue quite vigorously. Although what Bai Youyou cultivated was freezing cold True Qi, her tender tongue was unusually warm. Chen Xiang liked it very much. Because of this, the pleasure was greatly amplified, giving him a rush of extreme euphoria.

Only know Bai Youyou came to know why every time Su Meiyao and Chen Xiang’s kissed, her face would be flushed completely red. She also came to realize as to why every time, Xue Xianxian and Liu Menger kissed Chen Xiang, they looked so intoxicated. It was all because of that kind of indescribably marvelous feeling which made her sunk into depravity.

Chen Xiang and Bai Youyou kissed for a long time because Chen Xiang knew that it would be very difficult for him to kiss her again. He very much wanted to keep hugging this beauty until sea ran dry and rocks crumbled.

Unknowingly, the two separated from each other on their own. On that beautiful face of hers which always bore an icy look, a warm and intoxicated flush had emerged. It was very charming. This was also the first time Chen Xiang had seen such a look on her.

Bai Youyou, hanging her head slightly, said gently, “Chen Xiang, thank you very much for letting me experience this kind of happiness!”

Having said that, she transformed into a streak of light as she entered the ring.

Chen Xiang heaved a sigh of lament in his heart. At this moment, he felt as if he had lost his entire world.

“Hmph, the harder it is to get, the more you want it! Little Rascal, you are pretty lewd!” Su Meiyao tenderly snorted. She could clearly see the kind of feelings that Chen Xiang had for Bai Youyou.

Of course, knowing what a philanderer Chen Xiang was, Su Meiyao knew Chen Xiang had desires for her as well. Just a moment ago, when they were closely hugging each other, she could feel that thing growing madly on top of her abdomen as he got aroused.

Recalling this point, Su Meiyao’s face once again flushed red because that thing was pressed against her for a very long time.

At this point, Chen Xiang was lying on the bed, staring at the ceiling in a daze, savoring the taste of kissing the two ravishing beauties. When he was kissing Su Meiyao, he was burning with an evil desire to conquer her. However, when he kissed Bai Youyou, he didn’t have any kind of such thoughts.

He had no idea what Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou had experienced, but he knew that they had extremely powerful enemies. More importantly, they had currently lost their strength. In order to guard the two goddesses, he had to become stronger!
