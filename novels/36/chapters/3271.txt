Chen Xiang stood at the side and waited for the inspection to end, when he suddenly saw a big carriage passing by, this carriage was extremely luxurious, as though it was made of gold, what made him shocked was that the carriage’s four wheels were actually refined using Myriad Tao Divine Soil Crystals, and the rest of the carriage used a large amount of Myriad Tao Divine Soil s, so with one look, he could tell that it was a very valuable Divine Equipment.

"The person who killed the Wild thunder tiger is inside. We must find that bastard and show him to the public." It was a man.

"If we don’t find that person, we’ll seal the city!" Following that, someone in the car added.

The caravan left the city, but left quite a few experts behind.

After checking for a few days, everyone had been inspected. At this moment, everyone began to complain, because they were trapped here, and it was just because a young master’s arrogant wild beast was killed!

Although everyone could continue to move about in the city, they could not leave!

Chen Xiang was finally out of danger, and just could not leave.

"What should we do now?" Chen Xiang then came to the place where he had buried the Wild thunder tiger again. He carefully dug out the Wild thunder tiger. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Shuang had already exited the You Yao Mountain Villa, she had heard about the caravan from Chen Xiang, she frowned: "I never thought it would be someone of this level!"

"Awesome?" Chen Xiang said: "That carriage is very powerful, it was made using the Myriad Tao Divine Soil’s Crystals."

"This person is very powerful, those who have this kind of carriage are all the people at the top of the Soul River Divine Race, it should be the clan leader’s family." Qin Shuang said: "We have to think of a way to leave this place quickly! If we continue to stay here, we will be discovered sooner or later. "

Chen Xiang told Feng Ke’er to come out from You Yao Mountain Villa.

When Qin Shuang saw Chen Xiang suddenly release such a cute little girl, he was also curious: "Is this your pill spirit?"

"Of course not, but she’s about the same as a pill spirit." Chen Xiang placed his hand on Feng Ke’er’s little head and giggled.

Feng Ke’er stuck out his tongue at him, then moved his hand away, saying: "The great formation that shrouds this city is not easy to break."

Hearing Feng Ke’er’s words, Qin Shuang said in shock: "Are you saying that you want her to break through the formation?"

As his granddaughter, Qin Shuang might not be good in terms of pill refining, but she did understand a little bit about it. For example, in terms of array formations, she knew very well that this kind of array was extremely difficult to break.

"I’m fine with it." Feng Ke’er said with complete confidence: "Though it’s a little difficult."

Chen Xiang said: "You have to hurry, if we get caught, we will be in big trouble!"

Feng Ke’er laughed: "Don’t worry about me! However... It’s just that when the time comes, this great formation will completely destroy the city and cause quite a commotion. "

"Whatever. When the time comes, we just need to escape while breaking the formation." Chen Xiang looked at the city walls. They had to get to the top of the city walls first, this was too easy for Chen Xiang.

Deep in the night, Chen Xiang and the other two were at the bottom of the city walls. It was very quiet here, only the walls had people!

Feng Ke’er made Chen Xiang take out the Six Realms mirrors, and then said in a low voice: "The Great City Barrier Formation needs to be maintained by adding energy sources every so often, and when exchanging it for energy sources, it’s the weakest. At that time, I’ll be able to break through the formation easily! Chen Xiang, bring us to the city wall first! "

Chen Xiang used the Counter Power to make both Feng Ke’er and her invisible body, and then quietly climbed up the city walls with them. Although there were guards on top of them, they were quickly taken care of by Qin Shuang.

As long as the formation was broken, they could jump off the city walls and escape from the city!

Deep in the night, Feng Ke’er sent a sound transmission to Chen Xiang and Qin Shuang: "Are you guys ready yet, I’m preparing to begin!"

"Alright!" Qin Shuang replied.

Feng Ke’er immediately started, not long later, Qin Shuang and Chen Xiang sensed that the big formation that enveloped the city had disappeared, and also produced a very powerful energy wave.

Soon after, a series of loud bell chimes rang out from all directions of the city. The great formation had been broken, and this was a huge matter!

Chen Xiang placed Feng Ke’er inside the You Yao Mountain Villa and continued using the Counter Power to make him and Qin Shuang hide. After that, he jumped down the city wall and arrived outside the city.

"Let’s go, they’re coming!" Qin Shuang dragged Chen Xiang and quickly ran.

As he was running frantically, Chen Xiang looked behind him and saw the light. He quickly sent a sound transmission to Qin Shuang: "It’s that big caravan ... Damn it, how can this thing be so fast! "

The speed of the caravan was extremely fast. In this world where flying was extremely difficult, this kind of speed was extremely terrifying. Moreover, it didn’t require a person to expend any strength.

"We’ll definitely be caught." Chen Xiang saw the carriage approaching, he was very nervous, but Qin Shuang had already used all his power to run.

Qin Shuang was even more nervous than Chen Xiang now, because she knew just how strong the guy in the carriage was. If they caught up to him now, the consequences would be unthinkable.

"Got it!" Chen Xiang was still holding onto the Six Realms mirrors. He made it bigger, like a wheel, and then said to Qin Shuang: "We will enter the Six Realms mirrors!"

Qin Shuang’s eyes lit up. He immediately agreed and then pulled her into the Six Realms mirrors.

There was a very large space inside the Six Realms mirrors, and there were also quite a few of them. Some of them were for Chen Xiang to seal humans or beasts, while some were for him to store some things.

Right now, he was in a room. He could see the situation outside from all sides of the room.

The Six Realms mirrors had already become a wheel, spinning quickly on the ground. Under Chen Xiang’s control, it spun extremely quickly, gradually pulling apart from the caravan behind them.

"Hahaha, that caravan is too big, its speed is definitely not faster than mine." Chen Xiang said, while taking out some things, they were all round stones.

"What is this?" Qin Shuang asked.

"This is called an explosive pill, beng!" Chen Xiang threw a few of them out, and calculated the time so that the exploding pills would explode.

Qin Shuang was in her room. Through the wall, she could see the gorgeous RV chasing after her. When she saw the explosion, she couldn’t help but laugh because the RV was sent flying and almost flipped over.

Soon, the distance between them and the caravan became wider and wider.

Qin Shuang suddenly felt that even without her, with all these methods, Chen Xiang would still be able to survive.

"I didn’t think that Six Realms mirrors could be used like this." If Chen Xiang did not see the rolling wheels on the carriage, he would not have been able to think of this method. The Six Realms mirrors was refined with six Crystal emperor, he felt that it was worth it.

"I think we have completely angered a young master of the Soul River Divine Race." Qin Shuang said, but she was not too worried, rather she felt that it was a bit exciting.

"If I had the strength, I would have killed that guy." Chen Xiang curled his lips, he was not afraid of some Young Master.
