Xiao Baifeng immediately went to Imperial Concubine Lian to discuss this matter and arrange for Chen Xiang to meet with her.

Chen Xiang entered the secret room and instantly refined a portion of the medicinal ingredients into six Bone level Dan s. After that, he walked out of the room and found Huang Yantian and Huang Jintian roasting meat in the courtyard.

Huang Jintian really liked eating barbecue, so he had good cooking skills. At this moment, Chen Xiang smelled the fragrance of the barbecue and started to salivate.

"Bake more!" When Chen Xiang arrived at the courtyard, he immediately saw two piles of charcoal. Huang Jintian and Huang Yantian were roasting two whole cows each, and the cows were so big that they had no choice but to float.

Yang Tianyi laughed: "It’s good that I’m together with them, it’s good that it tastes good all day!"

Chen Xiang looked at Yue’er. Yue’er was currently staring with wide eyes at the two bullies, he never thought that this little thing would actually like to eat this kind of meat.

"This is the secret recipe for the Undead Divine Race’s barbecue. I never thought that the two seniors have mastered it!" Yue’er giggled, "I didn’t think that I would be able to eat this kind of roast meat for so long."

"How fragrant!" Xiao Baifeng praised when she returned, with a warm smile on her face, as if she had gradually liked this kind of liveliness, and smiled at others more.

Chen Xiang asked: "How’s the situation with the Imperial Concubine Lian?"

Xiao Baifeng picked Yue’er up, nodded, and said, "It’s already been arranged, it’s still early, after we finish eating, I’ll bring you to find her!"

At this time, it was almost dusk. After Chen Xiang and Chen Xiang ate their fill, they went to find Imperial Concubine Lian.

The Imperial Concubine Lian’s house was not big, but the inside was exquisite and elegant. Chen Xiang heard from Xiao Baifeng that the house originally belonged to the Ming Prince, but the Ming Prince wanted a big house, so the Imperial Concubine Lian had exchanged places with him.

As Chen Xiang sat in the hall, he was a little nervous. After all, he was the one who had severely injured his son.

Imperial Concubine Lian walked out, as did her daughter, Xiao Jin’er!

Xiao Jin’er was as tall as the Imperial Concubine Lian, and wore the same red dress. Both of them had the same charming phoenix eyes, and looked very much like twin sisters!

Previously, Huang Jintian and the others had said that this Undead Heaven Spirit could form his own Spirit Embryo. After the Spirit Embryo grew, it would look very similar to that of the Undead Heaven Spirit.

The one walking in front was the Imperial Concubine Lian. Chen Xiang could tell with a glance, that the Imperial Concubine Lian’s charming and seductive face was filled with an ice-cold expression.

The Xiao Jin’er behind her was very different from her. Even though she also had a charming face, she was actually very shy, and slightly lowered her head, not daring to look at Chen Xiang. When she raised her head to look at Chen Xiang, she discovered that Chen Xiang was looking at her.

"My son is dead. You should be happy now!" Imperial Concubine Lian said coldly after he sat down.

"This... I’m so sorry! " Chen Xiang never thought that the Ming Prince would actually die, this caught him off guard, he had initially thought of how to converse with him, to resolve this conflict.

At the same time, he felt that this matter was rather suspicious. Although his attacks were heavy, the Ming Prince was not a mortal either. At most, he would only be bedridden for three to five years.

"Imperial Concubine Lian, is this true? "Why haven’t I heard of it?" Xiao Baifeng also did not expect this.

"He died not long after you came to find me." Imperial Concubine Lian snorted, "Looks like the enmity between us can no longer be resolved!"

Chen Xiang suddenly understood that this Imperial Concubine Lian must have tried to kill him after he found her! Although Imperial Concubine Lian was cold and his face was filled with anger, he was not sad at all, not like his dead son at all. But he couldn’t understand why the Imperial Concubine Lian would do such a thing. Could it be that they didn’t want to settle the dispute with him?

Even if the enmity between us cannot be resolved, the gift that I have prepared will still be given to the Imperial Concubine Lian. Chen Xiang took out a jade box and handed it over to Imperial Concubine Lian. Imperial Concubine Lian did not take it, but placed it beside her table.

"Elder Sister Bai Feng, let’s go!" Chen Xiang saw that there was no room for discussion, and did not plan to waste time.

"Wait a minute, you killed my son, are you planning to end it like this?" Imperial Concubine Lian stood up, his eyes full of killing intent.

"Then what do you want?" Xiao Baifeng asked coldly, she was extremely protective of Chen Xiang.

"I want him to compensate a son of mine!" Imperial Concubine Lian sneered: "If you can’t compensate, then become my son!"

"Wishful thinking!" Xiao Baifeng pulled Chen Xiang along: "Let’s go!"

Imperial Concubine Lian immediately stopped them, "What? Didn’t you say earlier that you wanted to dissolve the hatred between us? Now I will give you a chance. Just be my son and you will be cured! Of course, you won’t lose out. I’m just letting you marry my daughter. "

"Mother ..." Xiao Jin’er was shocked, her face turning even redder.

Xiao Baifeng and Chen Xiang were shocked again, they never thought that Imperial Concubine Lian would have such a good plan. Previously, when she said that her son died, it caught Chen Xiang and Xiao Baifeng off guard, and even made them hate Chen Xiang, but now, she wanted Chen Xiang to take her daughter as compensation.

"Jin’er, don’t talk!" Imperial Concubine Lian scolded her lightly.

"Are you willing? That way, I will be your mother-in-law, and all the hatred between us will be gone as well! " Imperial Concubine Lian’s ice-cold face had already disappeared, what came next was a charming smile: "You really aren’t losing anything, my daughter is not bad at all!"

"I already have a wife, and there’s more than one. If your daughter wants to be my woman, she’ll probably be ranked very far away. Are you willing to let her suffer this injustice?" Chen Xiang also wore a smile on his face, because this Imperial Concubine Lian didn’t intend to turn hostile with him. He merely wanted to rope him in as much as possible.

Xiao Baifeng had heard a lot about Chen Xiang from Huang Jintian not long ago, but when she thought about it, she felt that it was normal. In this kind of environment, for Chen Xiang, this kind of terrifying Alchemist, to have many women was nothing strange.

"I’m fine with it, but you just need to take care of Jin’er in the future. You can’t let her suffer even the slightest bit." Imperial Concubine Lian directly said without even thinking.

"Mother ... "I don’t agree!" Xiao Jin’er immediately shook his head: "I don’t like him!"

Chen Xiang looked at the charming Xiao Jin’er, and laughed: "Don’t worry, I’m not sure if I want you or not! However, your mother did it for your own good. I hope that you will have a good home to return to! "

"Imperial Concubine Lian, don’t worry, I don’t need to marry your Jin’er. I have a lot of women by my side, I don’t need one of them! I promised to take care of her. " Chen Xiang felt that there was no pressure, he just threw her into the Hundreds of Flowers Village and passed her to Lv Qilian and the others. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

"Imperial Concubine Lian, why are you so anxious to shake your daughter off? What’s going to happen?" Xiao Baifeng asked, she could tell this.
