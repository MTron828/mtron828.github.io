The fact that Chen Xiang had defeated the Heaven Thunder Devil Lord was right in front of them, and before anyone could even discuss about it, a few rays of purple light flashed across the sky, and with a glance, one could tell that it was the people from the Purple Moon Imperial Land, and they were all experts. Chen Xiang had killed their Leader and the Son of Heaven, so the Purple Moon Imperial Land was definitely going to take down Chen Xiang in order to protect his reputation.

"You want to touch my disciple? No way!" Huang Jintian shouted in anger, only to see a black light suddenly chasing after the few experts of Purple Moon Imperial Land.

The black light turned into two giant palms, emitting a mysterious and terrifying aura, as if it was about to tear apart the sky.

The pair of big hands made a gesture as if it was ripping something apart, when the sky suddenly cracked open, and a terrifying force flew out, striking the Purple Moon Imperial Land Warriors.

"Sky Spill Hand!" He instantly arrived beside Chen Xiang, grabbed Chen Xiang and immediately disappeared. Although there were many people staring at Chen Xiang, no one could see his figure, they all assumed that Chen Xiang used some kind of secret technique to make himself disappear!

"Huang Jintian, you covered up Chen Xiang, what do you mean by this?" Chen Xiang had already run away, and what’s more, it was a once in a lifetime opportunity just now. If it wasn’t for Huang Jintian stopping them, they might have been able to attack Chen Xiang from afar.

"He’s my disciple, how can I watch him being bullied by all of you!? You bunch of bastards. Do you really think I’m afraid of you? " Huang Jintian was really not afraid, his move just now had shocked many people.

With Three Realms Talk at the brink of destruction, the people of the Purple Moon Imperial Land did not want to stand against him. They knew that if they angered the Super Martial School, it was equivalent to becoming enemies with the entire Chen Martial Continent, and the Chen Martial Continent had allied themselves with the Peach Blossom Imperial Land, it was said that the Devil-subduing College was also standing on the side of the Chen Martial Continent. Thus, the Purple Moon Imperial Land could only grit their teeth and endure. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In a small hut far away from Heavenly Thunder Chen, Chen Xiang had already recovered a lot, but his current physique was extremely strong, it was not something that a Relive Dan could completely recover.

Chen Xiang slept soundly. After waking up, he walked out of his room and saw the White Tiger sitting at a wooden table, reading a book.

"Strange, why would the Killing-god heart be inside the Heaven Thunder Purgatory?" When the White Tiger saw Chen Xiang coming out, it asked curiously.

Chen Xiang never thought that the White Tiger would come out on its own. Looking at this middle-aged man who looked so normal, he suddenly felt fear in his heart, even though he had already obtained the complete White Tiger Divine Weapon.

"At that time, I also felt very surprised, Senior did say that the other half of the White Tiger Divine Weapon was in the Emperor’s Tomb!" Initially, he had felt that the Emperor’s Tomb was not within the Ten Heavenly Sacred Mountain. However, the White Tiger had said that the Emperor’s Tomb was within the Ten Heavenly Sacred Mountain and half of the White Tiger was within.

Chen Xiang now understood why the White Tiger said that the Killing-god heart would be in Emperor’s Tomb. It was because this was also the heart of the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord.

"That’s why I said it’s strange! Looks like I don’t really understand some things regarding Qi Shi. Emperor’s Tomb might not be in the Ten Heavenly Sacred Mountain, or ... Emperor’s Tomb can move! " The White Tiger was very mysterious.

White Tiger’s face suddenly darkened. "You brat, why did you use my appearance to trick me earlier? What else have you done with my appearance? "

Chen Xiang laughed and said, "About that ... I only used it once, and then I stopped using it! "

"That’s right, what happened to Sister Blue and Yanran?"

"Fortunately, their potential is great. I will do my best to stimulate their potential!" The White Tiger did not pursue the matter of Chen Xiang pretending to be him and asked curiously, "How did you defeat the Heaven Thunder Devil Lord? Although this fellow has been struggling until now, his strength is not worth it at all! "

Chen Xiang laughed, then told the story to the White Tiger.

After hearing it, the White Tiger let out a sigh, "In that case, this Heaven Thunder Devil Lord is asking for trouble. However, you have used too much Heavenly Alchemy!"

"Too much?" Chen Xiang told the White Tiger what happened because he wanted to see how much the White Tiger knew about the Heavenly Alchemy.

The White Tiger’s tone suddenly became very strict, "Back then... It was because Qi Shi had used the Heavenly Alchemy excessively, that was why such a thing happened. You have to use it at your discretion. This is not a joke, because you are equivalent to stealing a lot of heaven’s power! This is also why the Robbery power was especially strong when crossing Nirvana Doom! "

"It’s fine if you refine some beasts, but if you refine the ocean, the mountain, the sky, and the stars ..." If you go too far, you will be in deep trouble, and at that time, I won’t be able to help you.

Chen Xiang could hear the words of a god. He had already sensed that there was an existence in the world that could actually make a Divine Beast of the same level as Bai Hu become much stronger than him. If even the White Tiger seemed so powerless in front of them, then what about him? Wouldn’t that be even smaller!

"Senior, I have a friend who came out from a dimensional door inside the Heaven Thunder Purgatory, but he ..."

White Tiger immediately understood what was going on and shook his head. "I have no other choice after entering the chaotic space. It’s very difficult to find him in the chaotic space. The chaotic space there can instantly rush him to who knows where."

Duan Chong was not weak, he could only pray that Duan Chong could survive so he could think of a way to leave this chaotic space.

"I still need to stroll around. I will be in Pill City in a while. At that time, you should be able to find me." The White Tiger said.

"At that time, you don’t have to go to Pill City, you can go to Dragon Subduing City!" Chen Xiang said.

After that, he slowly walked out of the small courtyard and disappeared into the forest. However, Chen Xiang had changed his appearance a bit and immediately went to the Heaven Thunder City.

Without Luotian Gate, Chen Xiang could not cross the space immediately, and could only step on the Shrinking step to travel.

On the way, Chen Xiang asked Long Xueyi: "Little Naughty Dragon, are you better now?"

Long Xueyi said in high spirits: "It’s fine now, I just ate something and I’ll be fine!"

"Did you eat something?" Chen Xiang curled his lips, in his mind, he could already see the big suckling dragon shaking its chest and sitting on the ground, wolfing down a large amount of spirit fruits.

"Yeah, I can fight another three hundred rounds now!" Long Xueyi laughed.

"Are you going to strip naked and fight me?" Chen Xiang teased.

"Hmph, even if it is, you won’t be able to win! Little Scoundrel, I’ll tell you solemnly, you’re just my god, don’t be too proud! Even if you truly obtain my body, it would be difficult for you to obtain my heart. Long Xueyi said seriously.

Chen Xiang gave a long "Oh" before asking, "How do I get your heart?"

Long Xueyi thought for a while, then said: "Give me a lot of delicious things, after a while, I might be able to fall for you!"

Chen Xiang laughed, this little gluttonous dragon already couldn’t leave him, because he had many good things that he couldn’t eat.
