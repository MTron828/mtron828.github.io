Xiao Xianglin tossed a set of clothes to Chen Xiang, also a set of black tight clothing.

"Hurry up and change, then we’ll set off!" Xiao Xianglin said: "We do not know what you are doing in seclusion. If we disturb your good fortune, wouldn’t we be scolded to death by you then?"

Chen Xiang threw the set of black clothes back to Xiao Xianglin, and laughed: "I don’t need to change!"

"Why? After changing clothes, we can move around in the night. It’s more convenient. " Xiao Xianglin said.

Chen Xiang’s heart stirred as he used the Transformation Art, causing his clothes to immediately turn black. "Look, didn’t I already change?"

"Fine, you actually mastered this kind of evil technique, consider yourself powerful!" Xiao Xianglin put away that set of clothes, turned around and walked out of the room: "We need to hurry up and set off."

Chen Xiang also didn’t have the time to figure out what was going on, as he had already started sprinting, he could only follow behind Xiao Xianglin and run out of the Dragon-Elephant School.

After arriving outside of the Dragon-Elephant School, Xiao Xianglin released two large dragon elephants. They were no longer the mighty dragon elephant she had previously.

After Chen Xiang entered the carriage, "Why didn’t your parents give you the dragon and elephant?"

"Because they went to that place too. Dragons and elephants are what they must fight for." Xiao Xianglin said: "Usually when they are in Dragon-Elephant School, they can lend it to me and let me pull the carriage."

"Aren’t you their precious daughter? How could they bear to let you go like this? " Chen Xiang felt the carriage being dragged in the air, and started to move quickly.

"I sneaked out, don’t worry about me." Xiao Xianglin said: "I definitely have to go there."

"What is it, you haven’t told me yet!" Chen Xiang curled his lips and said. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Xiao Xianglin looked at Xiang’er, gesturing for her to speak.

"Chen Xiang, have you heard of Legendary mantra?" Xiang’er asked.

"I’ve never heard of it. I know very little about the Tao-creation’s incantations." Chen Xiang shook his head.

"Then you must have heard of Luo Jiuyang!" Xiang’er said again.

When Luo Jiuyang was mentioned, Qin Shuang, who was inside the You Yao Mountain Villa, was shocked. Because Luo Jiuyang was her grandfather, Super Yang Old Ancestor!

"I’ve heard of it!" Chen Xiang’s face became serious: What’s wrong?

"Luo Jiuyang suddenly appeared!" "His relationship with Elder Gu Tong is very good, he suddenly appeared in Dragon-Elephant School and told Elder Gu Tong that he found a Legendary mantra, and told Elder Gu Tong to go with him."

Chen Xiang took a deep breath. Luo Jiuyang had actually appeared, and was even saying that it was some kind of legendary Tao-creation Incantation.

"What exactly is a Legendary mantra?" Chen Xiang asked.

"It’s a very powerful Tao-creation Incantation ... Normally, there are only nine types of Tao-creation Incantations, and all nine of them are at the ninth stage. However, Legendary mantra is not one of the nine, and they are only at the first stage of the Tao-creation Incantation, but they are extremely powerful. Xiang’er said.

"So the Tao-creation’s Incantation still has so much knowledge." Chen Xiang nodded, he was more concerned about Luo Jiuyang now, because Qin Shuang was extremely anxious about this matter, he did not know if he would be able to see Luo Jiuyang again.

"It’s quite far from here. They have already set off for two months, and the other sects have also found out about this, so they have all set out with all their might." Xiao Xianglin said: "We are the last."

"Alright, it’s all because of me. I’m sorry!" Chen Xiang also blamed himself, if he had come out earlier, he might have been able to keep up with the group and meet Luo Jiuyang.

"Too slow!" Xiao Xianglin continued to complain.

"If I had your parents’ Eight Dragons Elephant, would I have borrowed it faster?" Chen Xiang asked.

"That won’t happen. The dragon and elephant are larger in size, and they aren’t beasts that can move very fast." Xiao Xianglin shook his head: "If there were Dragon Controlling Palace s, we might not have come here too late."

"Really?" Chen Xiang’s brows twitched, he actually had a Dragon horse.

"Black dragon horse have the blood of a Black Wind Dragon and a Lightning Horse. Naturally, their speed is extremely fast." Xiao Xianglin said: "It’s a pity that this kind of thing is unique to Dragon Controlling Palace."

"It’s not unique to Dragon Controlling Palace. I have two of them!" Xiao Xianglin and the others, as master and servant, knew many secrets about him, such as the Azure Dragon, Ground-suppressing immortal elephant, and pill refining skills. As such, they were not afraid of being found out that he had a Black dragon horse.

After all, Xiao Xianglin was Chen Xiang’s master. Even though they hadn’t known each other for long and the two of them would often bicker with each other, they had a similar relationship.

Chen Xiang let out the two Black dragon horse s out.

"This is the Dragon Controlling Palace’s Black dragon horse, where did you get it from?" Xiao Xianglin cried out in alarm, while Xiang’er and Yu’er were dumbstruck.

"It’s not from the Dragon Controlling Palace. As for where I got it from, you don’t need to worry about it. Do you dare to use it now?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Liar, there’s clearly the Dragon Controlling Palace’s mark on it." Xiao Xianglin pointed to the place on the horse’s neck that had a finger size "O" mark. Chen Xiang had not noticed it before.

"Alright, it’s from Dragon Controlling Palace." Chen Xiang curled his lips: "I killed two of the weaker Dragon Controlling Gods and tamed their Black dragon horse, you guys better not talk about it anywhere!"

Xiao Xianglin frowned: "You really are reckless. You actually dare to kill the people from Dragon Controlling Palace, you are truly bold!"

"I have even touched a Black dragon horse at such a close distance!" Xiang’er had already walked up, and was stroking the Black dragon horse.

"Don’t you guys go around blabbering." Chen Xiang warned once again.

"We’re not idiots, of course we wouldn’t talk nonsense." Xiao Xianglin said: "But for you, don’t show off normally!"

Xiang’er said: "Is there any way to change the color of these two Dragon horse? If we use them, and the Dragon Controlling Palace discovers us, it would be troublesome."

Xiao Xianglin pinched Xiang’er’s face: "Idiot, we can’t use this Black dragon horse, just in case, if Dragon Controlling Palace finds out, the consequences will be dire."

Chen Xiang thought for a while, then said: "Alright, how about this?"

He used Counter Power on the two Black dragon horse, causing them to become invisible. This way, no one could see the Black dragon horse anymore, but the Black dragon horse still existed.

Chen Xiang also wanted to quickly go to that place so that he could meet Luo Jiuyang sooner. That was why he was the fastest to use Black dragon horse.

Xiao Xianglin had long been no longer surprised by Chen Xiang’s methods. She herself had the same thoughts as Chen Xiang, and had no choice but to agree.

Right now, it was Chen Xiang and Yu’er who were riding on the same Black dragon horse, Xiao Xianglin and Xiang’er who were on the same side. When Chen Xiang suggested to ride the same horse as her, she knew what Chen Xiang was planning.
