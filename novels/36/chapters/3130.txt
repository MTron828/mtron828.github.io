Chen Xiang didn’t actually know that Chen Cai had such a background. He had thought that the Heaven Old Orcs was naturally birthed.

"Looks like Heaven Old Divine Race is a bit more of a bastard." Chen Xiang said.

"That’s not it either... However, the Heaven Old Orcs is nothing, and I am a combination of both sides, so I am just a weirdo. " Chen Cai helplessly drank a cup of wine and continued: "Our two races were both born in Myriad Tao, and above Myriad Tao is an extremely bizarre world. The energy above can be said to be inexhaustible, and it is inexhaustible, but there is a lack of life above. It’s different from the Myriad Tao, unlike this place where there is such a stable life, where people just kill each other everyday. "

"Aren’t there people that can go up? Do they often? " Chen Xiang thought about the dead Myriad Tao Dan God.

No wonder Chen Cai was so relaxed after coming to this place. He had a very good understanding of the world above Myriad Tao.

"But why are the Heaven Old Orcs and the Heaven Old Divine Race here now? I don’t know what their main goal is, but it won’t be anything good either. Right now, they are all fighting to go to one place. " Chen Cai said in a low voice: "To some Natural Law World or something ... I heard that you are from the Natural Law World, so their main target is you. Because there are your friends inside. "

"This might just be a cover!" Chen Xiang frowned: "Natural Law World, what’s attracting them ... I don’t believe that they would go to the Natural Law World for me! Natural Law World has a barrier, and if someone who’s very strong wants to go to Natural Law World, it will not be easy, so the price they have to pay is not small. "

Chen Xiang felt the same way before, but now, he felt more and more that Heaven Old Divine Race and Heaven Old Orcs had other reasons for going to the Natural Law World.

"I don’t know about that. I can tell you some things about the Heaven Old Divine Race now, but even the Heaven Old Orcs doesn’t know much about these things." Chen Cai said: "This is the Heaven Old Divine Race’s secret."

"Alright!" Chen Xiang said: "I need to understand their strength!"

"They are very strong, and the way they obtain their power is the same as the Heaven Old Orcs. They both come from the heart." Chen Cai touched his own heart, "And the heart is also their fatal weakness. If you clash with them, you just need to hit their heart and destroy it, and you will be able to kill them."

Chen Xiang nodded his head: "That means they must have a very strong defense where their heart is."

Chen Cai laughed: "Of course, but your Heavenly magic sword can be broken easily."

The Heavenly magic sword was something that Chen Cai had refined. He felt that it was the best for this powerful divine sword, because it was something that he had refined.

"Their power originates from the heart, but their heart is different from Heaven Old Orcs’s. Heaven Old Orcs’s is the heart of a beast, while their heart is black." As Chen Cai said that, he took out a black stone that looked like a heart.

"This is the heart of the Heaven Old Divine Race!" Chen Cai said: "Look, there’s still a strong life force ahead!"

Chen Xiang never thought that this was a real heart. He took it and looked at it, and actually felt a very weak heartbeat, and that heart was even emitting an ice-cold Qi.

He took a closer look and discovered that there was only a thick layer of black crystal wrapped around the surface of the heart. There was also a large lump of something inside the heart, and it should be the energy source.

"It’s very sturdy!" Chen Xiang pinched it, then took out the Heavenly magic sword, wanting to see if he could cut it open.

"Stop!" Chen Cai immediately shouted, and suddenly snatched the heart away: "You’re crazy, do you know who the heart belongs to?"

"It couldn’t be your father’s, could it?" Chen Xiang said, as Chen Cai had previously said that his father was from the Heaven Old Divine Race.

"Of course not, this is mine!" Chen Cai snorted, then hid the heart well, afraid that it would be cut open by Chen Xiang.

Feng Ke’er and Chen Xiang were both stunned, the heart was actually Chen Cai’s own, he actually took out his own heart to shake around, it was truly a weirdo.

"Is that all right with you? How could he casually take out the heart ... Even the Heaven Old Divine Race can do it? " Chen Xiang asked: "If you hide your heart like this, how will I be able to kill Heaven Old Divine Race in the future when I encounter such a situation?"

"Of course the Heaven Old Divine Race cannot casually take out a heart like me." Chen Cai laughed complacently: "This heart belongs to me. If the one I have now is damaged, I can immediately replace it."

"That’s fine too!" Feng Ke’er asked: "Didn’t you say that your heart was destroyed and you died? How could I give you time to replace your heart? "

"Because the soul is also in the heart. If the heart finds destruction, the most important soul and life source will be gone. How can one not die?" Chen Cai said: "And my soul is hidden in the black heart, the beast heart only has energy! Of course, there’s also energy in my heart of darkness. "

It was evident how much trust Chen Cai had in him since he was able to tell Chen Xiang all of this without holding back.

"Chen Xiang, if you have the chance in the future, you can just dig out the hearts of those fellows in Heaven Old Divine Race and give them to me. Chen Cai said.

"Alright!" Chen Xiang said: "Is there anything else that’s powerful that I should be wary of in Heaven Old Divine Race?"

"They are very powerful in terms of formations and equipment forging. They were arranged to be here and their strongest power is only at the peak of World Defying Stage. The only difference is, they can also use World Defying Stage Fierce Power." Chen Cai said: "I want to test their hearts. I want to see if I can retrieve the World Defying Stage Fierce Power s from within, I also want to cultivate this kind of power."

"It would be fine if it was above Myriad Tao, but there are no World Defying Stage Fierce Power s here. If it cannot be absorbed, then we can only extract it from Heaven Old Divine Race and Heaven Old Orcs." Chen Cai said.

Chen Xiang’s Divine Sense Sea had an Invigorated Meridian, which allowed him to absorb World Defying Stage Fierce Power s. It was just that he had never tried it before, because his body was not strong enough previously, he was unable to succeed, but now his body was strong enough.

"Okay, but how do we find the Heaven Old Divine Race now? I want to see them. " Chen Xiang said. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

"Isn’t that easy? Aren’t they recruiting fighters now? I’ll go register with you. They won’t recognize us. " Chen Cai laughed: "Let’s sneak in with them and find some fun!"

Chen Xiang thought about it, and felt that this idea was not bad, and agreed. After eating, he followed Chen Cai and set off.
