Chen Xiang and Bai Youyou were completely stunned. Not only did Xia Bailing ride the centipede to play, he even jumped around on top of a few big furry spiders and treated a venomous bird as a horse. www.xstxt.org

Xia Bailing also knew that he had to keep this place quiet, so he created a spatial enchantment to prevent her voice from coming over. Chen Xiang and Bai Youyou looked at each other and laughed helplessly.

"Chen Xiang, I need your help!" Xu Youqing suddenly opened his eyes, his expression was gloomy.

"Alright, how can I help?" Chen Xiang asked anxiously.

"Can your Soul Absorbing Devil Spell absorb souls, or is it a power hidden within the soul?" Xu Youqing asked.

"Yes, you want me to use the Soul Absorbing Devil Spell?" Chen Xiang asked.

Right now, I have already dispersed the power of the Heavenly Dao Incantation that is imprisoning the soul of the Elder Sister Xiao Ling, and have separated it from the soul of the Elder Sister Xiao Ling. However, that power is too much, and it fills the entire Divine Sense Sea.

"If we do not take them away, the Elder Sister Xiao Ling will be in a terrible state, and she herself will not be able to resist this power. She will have to rely on external force."

Chen Xiang looked at Bai Youyou, and then asked: "Sister You You You also understand Soul Absorbing Devil Spell, can the two of us go together?" 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

"Of course you can. That would be for the best, and would allow you to quickly remove the power of the Curse Decree." Xu Youqing said: "You just need to sense the Divine Sense Sea s. I have already agreed to allow your powers into her Divine Sense Sea s."

Bai Youyou nodded at Chen Xiang: "I’m already prepared!"

"Our divine soul will enter, and we will immediately use the Soul Absorbing Devil Spell inside, this way we can more quickly absorb the energy." Chen Xiang said: "Let me ask Elder Sister Xiao Ling, can we directly enter with our divine soul!"

"She said she could, but she must be careful when she goes in, because the Heavenly Energy is very tyrannical inside, and it is not controlled by Elder Sister Xiao Ling. My divine soul must be very careful inside, and Elder Sister Xiao Ling’s divine soul is also hiding right now." Xu Youqing said.

Chen Xiang and Bai Youyou pressed their palms against Du Xiaoling’s back, then said their farewells to Bai Ziqian and Xia Bailing, telling them to protect their backs well and not to be disturbed.

Xia Bailing also quieted down at this time, and came beside Chen Xiang and the others.

Chen Xiang and Bai Youyou’s divine soul had already entered Du Xiaoling’s Divine Sense Sea World, and it was a mess inside!

However, Chen Xiang could still roughly see that Du Xiaoling’s Divine Sense Sea World was in a very simple and beautiful world. There were blue skies and green hills, and there would occasionally be some flowers.

But now, there were many dark gray clouds drifting around in the blue sky. It was still raining heavily, and the rain was very dirty. The green grass was dyed a dark gray after being watered by the rain.

After the rain stopped, a strong wind blew, bringing with it a gray dust cloud. Amidst the strong wind, there was also a clump of sand!

"Are all these heaven’s law charms?" At this time, Chen Xiang and Bai Youyou were holding hands and flying around due to the strong winds, and it was impossible for them to stop.

"Yes, the Heavenly Energy Curse is extremely tyrannical, and the Heavenly Energy Curse accounts for too much grievance. Now that it has separated from the Elder Sister Xiao Ling’s soul, it wants to pollute the world of the Elder Sister Xiao Ling." Xu Youqing said.

"Sister You You, let’s begin!" Chen Xiang said as he operated the Soul Absorbing Devil Spell.

Chen Xiang and Bai Youyou felt the murky soul power inside, so they operated the Soul Absorbing Devil Spell together. They quickly absorbed it and discharged it from their bodies.

Chen Xiang took out the Chuangshi god furnace, and poured all of the turbid Heavenly Energy he released into the Chuangshi god furnace, burning it and refining it.

"So many!"

Chen Xiang couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise after he continuously absorbed for more than two hours, because even though there wasn’t much reduction in the absorption process, he still went ahead and absorbed as much as he could without decreasing in the slightest.

"It seems this will take a long time." Xu Youqing sighed: "I didn’t think it would be so much!"

"Looks like there’s only one way." Chen Xiang said: "Sister You You You, you can leave first. Leave this to me."

"Don’t act recklessly!" Bai Youyou was a little worried that Chen Xiang would use a dangerous method.

"It’s fine, there’s no danger." Chen Xiang laughed: "If I use my method, I can quickly settle it."

"Alright!" Bai Youyou left Du Xiaoling’s Divine Sense Sea.

Xu Youqing asked: "Husband, what method do you plan to use? Is it dangerous? "

"It’s not that dangerous. It’s just that I let my second Divine Sense Sea out here, so you can let him work with me. I’m worried that he’ll reject the power of my second Divine Sense Sea." Chen Xiang said. Du Xiaoling’s divine soul simply could not flow inside, so he could not directly talk to her.

"Alright!" Only Xu Youqing was able to talk to Du Xiaoling.

"I’m ready to begin!" Chen Xiang said.

"You can begin!" Xu Youqing had already told Du Xiaoling before.

Chen Xiang took a deep breath, then released his second Divine Sense Sea.

His second Divine Sense Sea was extremely special and mysterious as well. However, Xu Youqing knew that his second Divine Sense Sea was extremely terrifying, and that was also a power that Chen Xiang normally did not use.

After Chen Xiang’s Second Divine Sense Sea appeared, waves of dragon roars could be heard, a huge dragon covered in green scales roared and soared into the blue sky, with green light flashing from its scales, it was actually a Qin dragon.

Afterwards, the Vermillion Bird’s Cry, White Tiger, Black Tortoise, Qilin and Ground-suppressing immortal elephant all roared out, shaking Du Xiaoling’s Divine Sense Sea.

Six extremely large Heavenly beast s that seemed to cover the sky appeared in Du Xiaoling’s Divine Sense Sea.

"Soul Absorbing Devil Spell!" Chen Xiang passed through the six Heavenly beast s and activated Soul Absorbing Devil Spell. Six gigantic whirlpools suddenly appeared in the air.

The six gigantic divine beasts opened their mouths wide, devouring the Heavenly Energy Curse!

A large amount of Heavenly Energy was sucked into the six gigantic vortexes like six giant pillars. In a short moment, a large expanse of blue sky had already appeared among Du Xiaoling’s Divine Sense Sea.

"So fast!" Xu Youqing exclaimed.

The second Divine Sense Sea was Chen Xiang’s true strength, and this power was usually in deep sleep. Unless absolutely necessary, Chen Xiang would never use it, because if he used it, he did not know if he could control this strong Heavenly Energy.

Of course, if it was only used in the Divine Sense Sea s, there wouldn’t be any problems. But if these six Heavenly beast were to be released outside, according to the special power of the Heavenly Dao Pill and Dao Po realm, the Heavenly beast would borrow the power of Natural Law Principles.

These six Heavenly beast must be extremely powerful when they borrow Natural Law Principles, he was worried that they might break out of his control then.
