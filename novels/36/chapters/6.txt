Chapter 007 - Dragon Saliva Exercise

“This is.......wait, stop! Don’t burn down my Spirit Dan Hall!” An old man started shouting, it seemed that he appeared out of thin air.

The flame in Chen Xiang’s hands started to dissipate. The people in the Spirit Dan Hall slowly recovered from their shock. They could all feel the fury that had been contained within Chen Xiang’s flame.

“Chen Zhenhua, don’t tell me you afraid of the flames made by a ‘waste’? Then what does it make you? An even bigger waste?” Chen Xiang spoke, openly sneering.

Chen Zhenhua’s complexion became extremely ugly. No one in their right mind would try to take on those flames. The mouth of the governor’s daughter was wide open in shock. She looked at Chen Xiang in surprise. She could feel the power behind those flames. She lowered her head because she had been treating him like dog-shit on the side of the road. Who knows why Chen Xiang decided to hide his strength instead of showing it off, like anyone else that was his age would do.

“Hall Master........This brat.” One middle-aged fellow, wearing a short white robe, came out from behind Chen Xiang.

That old man just kept on staring at Chen Xiang, his face contorted in a look of disbelief, shock, and joy, all at the same time.

This old man was the Spirit Dan Hall’s Master. He is a very famous alchemist and had a history of scruples with Chen Xiang’s grandfather.

“Little brother, do you want to become my apprentice?” the old man asked, which made all the people within Spirit Dan Hall gasp.

The hall master was even willing to take him as an apprentice!

Everybody knew that many aristocratic families had wanted their children to be taken on as his apprentice. But even if their parents personally came to ask the Spirit Dan Hall’s Master, they would be rejected without even a second look.

Everyone froze in place. Chen Xiang’s potential shocked every single one of them. Having no spiritual vein, but still being able to release a True Qi flame and, not to mention the fact that, the Spirit Dan Hall’s Master had seen that Chen Xiang is a good seed.

Chen Xiang scratched his head and spoke dismissively: “Although I would like to, you and my grandfather are enemies, so I cannot take you as my teacher!”

Then, Chen Xiang turned away casually, without the slightest expression of regret or sorrow. No one could believe that Chen Xiang had actually refused! They suspected that he might have misunderstood what the Spirit Dan Hall’s Master said. Only after hearing the sound of the Spirit Dan Hall’s Master sighing did they believe that there are some people who would actually refuse to become a Spirit Dan Hall’s Master’s apprentice.

Everyone agreed that Chen Xiang was a fool. Because of a private grudge between his grandfather and the Spirit Dan Hall’s Master, he gave up such a good opportunity.

Chen Zhenhua’s heart was filled with jealousy. A moment ago,he had ruthlessly humiliated Chen Xiang, and everyone’s gaze had been fixated on Chen Xiang, their gazes filled with disdain. But now many people looked at him with contemptuous expressions. In the eyes of these people, a genius alchemist was much more formidable than any other type of genius.

He was able to refine dans. Furthermore, even though he was lacking a spiritual vein, he was able to become a fierce martial artist!

Of course, not only did Chen Xiang have Divine Veins, he could also become an alchemist! He could now plant herbs and release True Qi flames. These were the two conditions he needed to start refining dans. Although alchemy needed certain experience and higher understanding, he is sure that he will able to successfully refine those dans.

Chen Xiang already knew that Spirit Dan Hall’s Master was his grandfather’s rival, moreover, his grandfather had been very good to him. From time to time, his grandfather would give him some dans, which ultimately allowed him to reach the 3rd level of the Mortal Martial Realm.

After returning to the Chen family resident, Chen Xiang found his father and told him about what had happened at the Spirit Dan Hall.

“Well done! That old man of the Spirit Dan Hall treats our Chen Family poorly. He sells those dans to us at exorbitant prices. Since you have a True Qi flame, it will not be difficult for you to become an alchemist! From now on, I’ll fully support you.” Chen Tianhu, in his heart, was very excited. Now that his son can release True Qi flames, it can be said he will have a promising future, even better than martial artists with high-grade spiritual veins.

Chen Xiang retired to his own small courtyard and started planting those spirit herbs seedlings. In the evening, he sat cross-legged on his bed, sensing the rich Spirit Qi of heaven and earth. He started then using the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] along with the [Dragon Saliva Exercise], and quickly absorbed the Spirit Qi.

After using the [Dragon Saliva Exercise], it will leave behind a special essence on his tongue. As long as he uses this essence to water those spirit herbs, the time it will take them to mature will significantly decrease.

In the morning, Chen Xiang stretched out his tongue and found an azure colored dewdrop. This drop was ‘Dragon Saliva’!

Seeing this, Chen Xiang started rejoicing, he did not expect to be successful in making the ‘Dragon Saliva’ on his first try, he quickly put that azure dewdrop into a bucket full of water. The bucket started exhibiting a light azure aura.

Using the bucket of glowing water, Chen Xiang started carefully watering the seedlings.

Azure Spirit Grass, Blood Element Grass, Profound Bright Flower, and Spirit Leaf Grass. These four spirit herbs were only low-grade Mortal herbs, but it normally took them 3 years to mature.

However, after Chen Xiang used the ‘Dragon Saliva’ to accelerate their growth, it only took a month for them to fully mature!

“The azure colored grass, which is the one exhibiting a fierce spirit Qi, is the ‘Azure Spirit Grass’. The one which is as red as blood and the size of a fist was the ‘Blood Element Flower’. The one which is white as snow and emitted a bright aura was the ‘Profound Bright Flower’. The one that looked like leaf bladed grass was the ‘Spirit Leaf Grass’.”

Chen Tianhu looked around the small courtyard with surprise. While staring at the spirit herbs, he clearly remembered that a month ago they were nothing more than seedlings.

“Son, about this ability of yours.........refrain from showing it to others, no matter what! Only you and I will ever know about this. Just as one should not boast about his treasures in public, you should not let anyone else know about this ability of yours.” Chen Tianhu spoke with a serious face and did not inquire about how his son got this ability.

Chen Xiang nodded his head. This courtyard was in Chen Tianhu’s domain, so nobody would dare to come in here without his permission and, therefore, Chen Xiang was not worried about people discovering this.

“Alchemy is not simple. Although you have the ability to become an alchemist. Self-teaching is a hard thing to do, especially with alchemy. You should try to build your foundation first. Even if you take a wrong step we can go and look for an alchemist when needed.” Chen Tianhu said this, then removed a bucket sized alchemical furnace from his storage pouch.

[TLN: Alchemy furnace looks something like this]

Chen Tianhu said, ”Although this alchemical furnace is not that good, it is the best one which I can afford. Wait for me to ask the elders for some money, and we will buy a better one later.”

For alchemy, an alchemical furnace was one of the most essential things, second only to the herbs. Chen Xiang was quite satisfied with the black furnace, laughing and nodding his head, he said, “Thank you dad. You will be the first to taste my refined dans.”

Chen Tianhu walked out laughing.

During this month, except for looking after the seedlings, Chen Xiang spent most of his time asking Su Meiyao about the main points of alchemy. That seductive girl explained all the difficulties of alchemy carefully, making sure Chen Xiang knew what he was getting into.

As Chen Xiang learned about alchemy, he encountered many issues. For example, controlling the flames, pouring the True Qi continuously, and solidifying the dan, which required a very accurate control and application of spiritual power.

“Sister Meiyao, at what time should I start the preparation to refine these dans?” Chen Xiang used spirit power to exchange words with Su Meiyao, inside the ring, while picking the matured herbs. Only after some processing would they be qualified to be used for alchemy.

The steps of processing required certain skills, but for Chen Xiang, those didn’t actually matter, because Su Meiyao has already taught him those things.

Su Meiyao with a sweet voice said, ”The soonest you will be able to begin is, around, a year and a half.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“What? I only have one more month before the competition with that Yao family genius.” Chen replied, shocked.

Bai Youyou spoke coldly, “What an idiot. Why do you want to compete with him in alchemy? With your strength, you can easily slaughter him.”

The corner of Chen Xiang’s mouth twitched slightly. If he slaughtered the Yao family genius, then the Yao family and the Chen family will certainly go to war. Requiring his father, or even the family elders, to step in. It would be very troublesome.

He starts to process the spirit herbs, and then placed them inside the furnace. After this, each and every step must be performed extremely precisely.

The basic steps of alchemy include: pouring the True Qi inside the alchemical furnace, baking the spirit herbs, waiting for the spirit herbs to start emitting unique spirit Qis, controlling those various spirit Qis and mixing them with dried up spirit herbs, gathering them together in one place, and then congealing them into a dan.

Chen Xiang placed both his hands on the two separate mouths of the furnace and then poured his flames inside it, while, at the same time, inspecting the internal situation of the furnace with his spiritual power.
