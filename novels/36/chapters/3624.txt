Chen Xiang had already thought about the consequences the Legendary god Dan would cause once it was made public, which was why he decided to auction it outside the Fighting Glorious City. ] -79-

"Dammit, even the Ice Jade Sect has come." Zhou Xingzhi cursed, he could sense powerful Qi coming from all directions, heading towards Chen Xiang’s direction.

"It seems like we’re under a lot of pressure this time!" Chen Xiang took a deep breath.

"If it really isn’t possible, then let’s go." Bai Youyou said: "Of course, we can’t just leave like that, we have to make them bleed, we can’t let them come here for nothing."

Xiao Xianglin had already worked hard inside the Time array s and refined many divine tools. He had both defensive and offensive divine tools that could allow Bai Youyou and the others’ overall strength to be even stronger.

The strongest was at the late stage of World Defying Stage Legendary Rank, was an old man in his late years. The last time Mu Yijing, who was in the middle stage of World Defying Stage Legendary Rank, had been killed, so they would definitely send someone stronger this time around.

Then came the Paternoster Race and Flame Mountain Sect.

These four strong forces had all come, in Chen Xiang’s eyes, they were shameless hooligans.

At the entrance was Yang Genming and Lie Dao.

"Everyone, the auction is in progress. We can’t enter right now, please wait a moment." Yang Genming said with a smile. When he saw this group of people, he had already made his decision. If this group of people made a move against Chen Xiang, he would definitely help them.

"What are you?" An old man from the Flame Mountain Sect shouted coldly. He released his aura, he was a late stage World Defying Stage Legendary Rank.

"I am a human, I am not a thing! Of course, you must be something! "Yes, an old thing." Yang Genming laughed, clenching his fists tightly, he would not show any sign of weakness.

He had been a City Lord for a long time, and had long complained about the Seven Great Sects. Previously, he had only held it in, but now, he looked down on him in such a way.

"You’re courting death!" The old man from the Flame Mountain Sect was instantly enraged and immediately released a strong pressure. Yang Genming endured the pressure with a smile on his face, and pushed him back.

Chen Xiang and Xiao Xianglin were both behind him, so together, Xiao Xianglin and Little White Fox secretly used the Pressure mantra and released a wave of pressure that destroyed the old man’s pressure in an instant, forcing him to take a few steps back.

"This is my shop. If you want to enter, you have to go through me." Chen Xiang said coldly: "You guys have stayed in Tao-creation Ancient Place for so many years, don’t just sit there and watch the scene, you guys are too conceited."

"Pressure mantra!" An old man from the Paternoster Race said in a low voice: "These are new incantations, the strong ones."

"Chen Xiang, you killed Elder Mu Yijing of my Wood Mountain Sect. We came here for revenge. The old man from the Wood Mountain Sect revealed his killing intent, "I want to force you to go back to the Wood Mountain Sect to receive your punishment."

"Alright!" Chen Xiang smiled, looked at the people from the Ice Jade Sect and asked: "You should be from the Ice Jade Sect, are you here to watch a show?" Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Here, it seemed that only the Ice Jade Sect did not have any reason to attack Chen Xiang.

"Not really, we are here to capture you! Your Legendary god Dan was stolen from my Ice Jade Sect ... My Ice Jade Sect had a burglary before ... "

The old man had not finished speaking when Chen Xiang smacked the old man hard in the face.

"What a shameless thing." Chen Xiang laughed coldly: "Your face should have been smashed to pieces."

Chen Xiang actually dared to beat him up!

"I will destroy you!" The old man from the Ice Jade Sect roared. The surroundings became as cold as frost and the entire tower was covered in ice as an extremely strong wave of Icy cold power shot towards Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang immediately brandished his Six Realms mirrors and blocked the power of the man from the Wood Mountain Sect.

The people of Wood Mountain Sect had originally planned to wait and see, and then watch the situation unfold, but they did not expect such a force to suddenly attack.

The old man from the Ice Jade Sect was the Late period of World Defying magic realm, and this wave of Icy cold power was created in a fit of anger. After being bounced back by Chen Xiang’s Six Realms mirrors, it was strengthened by the mirrored Increase spell. In just an instant, the entire Wood Mountain Sect was frozen.

Xiao Xianglin and Little White Fox saw that after releasing two clones each, they had activated the Pressure mantra together with their clones and released an extremely strong pressure. Then, they merged the pressure of their six clones together using the Fusion spell and charged towards the people of Wood Mountain Sect.

When this pressure exploded out, even those in the later stages of World Defying Stage Legendary Rank were moved in fear. The few Wood Mountain Sect s who were frozen immobile were instantly torn to shreds by this pressure.

The Wood Mountain Sect was finished just like that, he was a late stage World Defying Stage Legendary Rank and a few mid stage World Defying Stage Legendary Rank s!

The Ice Jade Sect’s old man was also stunned, his cold power was very strong, even people with a similar cultivation level as him would not be able to break through the ice, and because of that, his body’s defensive power would be weakened, hence he would be torn to shreds by the pressure.

"That is... Those are Legendary mantra, these two women have control over Legendary mantra. " The people from the Paternoster Race shouted in shock, "We must capture them."

Yang Genming and the others secretly took a deep breath, no wonder the clone could pass through the Legendary mantra, no wonder it was so powerful.

The old man from the Ice Jade Sect wanted to attack again, but the people from the Flame Mountain Sect and the Paternoster Race had already rushed forward. Chen Xiang was holding onto the Legendary god Dan’s medicinal formula, and Little White Fox and Xiao Xianglin were holding onto the Legendary mantra.

"Junior Sister and Master!" Chen Xiang anxiously shouted.

Xiao Xianglin and Little White Fox were already prepared a long time ago, and after that, they released the berserk pressure that they had been storing for a long time, hitting Chen Xiang.

When the pressure was sent towards Chen Xiang, he immediately used his Six Realms mirrors to block it!

Everyone immediately understood that this was to bounce back using the Six Realms mirrors, and to make the pressure stronger.

When the ten odd people from Flame Mountain Sect and Paternoster Race saw this, they were shocked and dispersed. They knew very well how terrifying the pressure was.

What no one expected was, Chen Xiang’s target wasn’t them, but the Ice Jade Sect behind them!

Originally, everyone thought that they were going to attack Yan Shan and the Paternoster Race. No one expected that after they dodged, Chen Xiang would use the force of time to slow down, and then hurriedly change the angle of the Six Realms mirrors, pushing the extremely strong pressure towards the few people from the Ice Jade Sect.

The pressure swept out, other than the Ice Jade Sect’s late stage World Defying Stage Legendary Rank’s elder who was able to block it, the other middle stage World Defying Stage Legendary Rank s were all crushed into dust, and turned into ashes.

Even if it was the late stage World Defying Stage Legendary Rank, he would still be severely injured if he was able to withstand this power. Bai Youyou and Feng Lanyi who were both hidden immediately came up to the old man, and used the Tao-creation Divine Weapon that Xiao Xianglin refined, to hack the old man into eight pieces.
