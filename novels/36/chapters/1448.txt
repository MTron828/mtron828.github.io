They had successfully saved Liu Meng’er, but everyone was in a bad situation. They had offended several strong powers, and Chen Xiang had angered the Fire Emperor.

"Don’t worry about Fire Emperor. Ice Dragon Race isn’t someone to be trifled with." Long Huishan smiled and patted Chen Xiang’s shoulder. She was very proud that her brother was able to save her from Fire Emperor.

Everyone had already left the Heaven Sword City and returned to the Frozen Dragon Asgard. At this moment, they were celebrating in the great hall of the Long family.

As they ate and chatted merrily, a few hours passed. At daybreak, everyone left one after another.

Huang Jintian brought Gu Dongchen and Wu Kaiming along, and did not say where he was going. He only said that he was going to bring them to wander the Heaven Realm, and Duan Ming and the others continued to bring the young people around Yun Xiaodao to train them, because during this mission, Yun Xiaodao and the others were all injured and did not have enough strength.

Chen Xiang bade farewell to everyone, sending them off while he stayed behind in the Long family’s residence.

In a small courtyard in the Long family’s residence, Chen Xiang, Liu Meng’er and the other girls were present.

"Elder Sister Meng’er, where are your parents? Will they be alright?" Seeing Liu Meng’er’s worry, Chen Xiang asked softly.

"They will be fine, they should have left the Divine Artisan Mountain Villa. At that time, disagreements appeared within the Divine Artisan Mountain Villa regarding my matter, my parents’ master was against exchanging with me, but he was not a match for the masses, so he could only bring my parents away, worried that my parents would do something stupid." Liu Meng’er sighed softly, "He said that he would come and save me. Perhaps because he saw you all make a move, he didn’t make a move."

"Master, are you going to look for them now? You should stop running around and avoid the limelight." Leng Youlan said with a face full of mirth: "I’m already very powerful right now, I might be able to beat Master and Big Sister."

Liu Meng’er chuckled as he caressed her silky white hair affectionately and said: "You Lan, thank you for coming to save me."

"Don’t be so polite with me. You can be considered my brother’s wife and my master. Of course I want to go." Leng Youlan laughed and even pushed Liu Meng’er over to her, causing her to blush.

Seeing that, Hua Xiangyue laughed: I still have some things to do, I’ll go get busy.

Long Huishan had also followed Hua Xiangyue and left. She also knew that Hua Xiangyue and Chen Xiang had that kind of relationship, and it was very deep as well. The last time Hua Xiangyue and Chen Xiang had lived in the Long family for a period of time, they had been sleeping together every night at that time ... Seeing Long Huishan and Hua Xiangyue walking out of the small courtyard, she casually found an excuse and followed Hua Xiangyue and the others.

Xue Xianxian was also present, and the atmosphere was a little awkward. Just as she wanted to leave, Liu Meng’er pulled her back.

"Xianxian... "Don’t go, or else this little scoundrel will bully me." Liu Meng’er said with a rosy face.

Xue Xianxian laughed. "Elder Sister Meng’er, then you mean for me to bully this little scoundrel together with you."

Chen Xiang took a deep breath. Looking at the situation, he knew that he would have a hard time tonight.

"How about I call the little girl, Xiang Yue? She’s my slave, so she can serve us." Chen Xiang laughed as he rubbed his hands.

Xue Xianxian laughed mischievously: "Should we also call You Lan over?"

"This... "Of course." Chen Xiang laughed.

"What are you guys doing?" Liu Meng’er asked with furrowed brows. She had a bad premonition, she knew that although Xue Xianxian looked as gentle as water, he would become very mischievous when he was with Leng Youlan all day, not to mention Chen Xiang’s wife, this little scoundrel.

"Heh heh." Chen Xiang smiled mischievously as he opened his arms and embraced Liu Meng’er and Xue Xianxian, then walked into the house.

Inside the bathroom, mist swirled around and within the bath, a man and a woman could be seen. Chen Xiang and Liu Meng’er were soaking in the bath.

Xue Xianxian wasn’t together at all, she was just feeling a little awkward because of the atmosphere. After all, this was the first time for Liu Meng’er, and she was so shy.

"Elder Sister Meng’er, do you remember the first time we met?" Inside the bathing pool, Chen Xiang was in the warm water. Pavilion Master Liu Meng’er’s snow-white body, felt the lubrication and gentleness of her body, and used one of her hands to caress the most impressive and wonderful part of her body.

"Of course I remember. At that time, you were still a little ghost. You were only that big. At that time, I never would have thought that my man would be such a person." Liu Meng’er kept on shouting as she squeezed Chen Xiang’s chest softly.

"Were you looking down on me back then?" Chen Xiang laughed sinisterly, and wrapped her arms around Liu Meng’er’s waist to let her flawless jade body be completely exposed. At the moment, it was dripping with water, and her moist yet beautiful snow-white body looked even more captivating.

"Stinky brat, what are you doing?" Liu Meng’er screamed as she kicked her slender legs, making it even harder for Chen Xiang to control her.

"I want to eat you." Chen Xiang laughed sinisterly, his eyes greedily looking at the beauty that was in his embrace, the endless evil flames in his eyes, as though he wanted to melt this beauty and fuse her with him. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Liu Meng’er knew that this would happen sooner or later. She felt that this kind of situation was very complicated in her heart, and she felt fear in her heart, but there was also anticipation, and when she felt that Chen Xiang’s breathing had become hurried, she could not help but reach out her jade hands and gently stroke Chen Xiang’s chest. She wanted to calm his restless heart, but her heart was beating at a pace not slower than Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang placed Liu Meng’er onto the bed, and the two of them looked at each other in deep love, their lips unknowingly moving closer, then touching together.

The moment Chen Xiang stuck out her tongue, she felt Liu Meng’er’s tongue tremble a little. She was clearly a little excited, and unlike before, she became very proactive. Her soft and fragrant tongue seemed to want to tightly wrap around Chen Xiang, becoming wild and excited.

During the kiss, Chen Xiang was actually suppressed by the other party, and was completely in a passive position. However, he also felt extremely satisfied with it, and turning around, he allowed Liu Meng’er to lie on his body. A big hand slowly slid down from his back to his waist, and placed on that abundant * * *, pinching gently.

Following the continuous teasing of Chen Xiang’s hands, Liu Meng’er’s breasts were completely hooked, and her breathing became hurried. Just when she felt that her body was burning from emotions, a tearing pain suddenly came, causing her to scream out in pain.

"Elder Sister Meng’er, leave it to me." Chen Xiang whispered into her ear.

"Un, be more gentle. I’m afraid of pain ..." Liu Meng’er was a little afraid of the pain she felt just now, but she knew that in that moment, she had become Chen Xiang’s woman.

After that, the room was filled with one charming spring scene after another, accompanied by beautiful, soft moans ...
