The main way to tame Fury beast was to feed them.

In this Heavenly River Mountain Range, Fury beast would have to take risks to kill other Fury beast. They could only become stronger after eating other Fury beast.

Normally, only large powers could afford to raise Fury beast. This was because Fury beast’s appetite was extremely astonishing, especially when they first had to tame it, they would need to give them food all day.

"We only have Tiger King and that Black ape, we don’t know if it’s enough!" Du Rouke was a little worried. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

"It should be enough, you have to know, that Black ape is much stronger than Tiger King. If Chen Xiang didn’t have a powerful godly weapon that could easily cut off the head of the Black ape, we would not have been able to succeed." Old Man Qin said, they have all experienced the thick skin of Black ape.

Chen Xiang took out the Tianchuang furnace, but the Tianchuang furnace’s lid was tightly closed, so Chen Xiang did not dare open it. Otherwise, the monkey inside would run out, and he could only use the storage method to put in the Tiger King’s corpse.

The three Poison monkey were already very irritable to begin with, so they jumped up and down from the inside. It wasn’t until Chen Xiang threw Tiger King inside that the monkeys calmed down.

"Will it work?" asked. Previously, he had also tried to tame the Fury beast but failed.

"I don’t know. Let’s hope it succeeds." Chen Xiang did not have any confidence now. He had just put Tiger King’s corpse in and not long ago, the corpse was already reduced by half. Even though the three monkeys were very small, their eating speed was extremely fast.

"They have already eaten all their bodies, not even their bones are left. Right now, only the Fury beast core is left uneaten." Chen Xiang said: "He is surrounding the Fury beast core, he should be absorbing the Fury beast’s power inside."

"The appetite of these Fury beast s are very big. I had previously wanted to subdue a leopard, but to no avail. I also lost several Madness soul and wild boar." Song Tianchuan said: "It’s really like stealing a chicken but not eating it."

Song Tianchuan and the others did not care about the losses of Tiger King and Black ape at the moment. They only hoped that Chen Xiang could succeed so that they could kill the Five-tiger from Fierce Saber Race here.

"With a big appetite, you can eat as fast as you want! I really don’t know how long these three rascals had been hungry, like reincarnations of hungry ghosts, and all of a sudden, they ate up Tiger King’s flesh and bones. Even the Beast core were completely absorbed by them. "

Hearing Chen Xiang’s description, Du Rouke couldn’t help but exclaim: "It’s only been less than an hour, their digesting ability is really strong, hurry up and feed the black panther too!"

Chen Xiang shook his head and said: "Black Panther is indeed much stronger than Tiger King, but I estimate that it won’t last more than two hours before these three monkeys eat it.

"What method?" Song Tianchuan was extremely curious;

"I am a Alchemist, I still have some pills on hand, I don’t know if these monkeys are interested or not." Chen Xiang grinned: "If it’s successful, it’s much better than feeding the Fury beast. It’s not easy to hunt the Fury beast."

Chen Xiang was actually a Alchemist. Everyone was shocked, Chen Xiang’s strength was not weak, and he even had several good divine tools.

Chen Xiang took out a few Myriad Tao Divine Soil Pills and threw them into the Tianchuang furnace s. These pills were all condensed out by them before, and there were still a lot of them, so even Mei Jing Sisters wouldn’t be able to use them right now.

The Myriad Tao Divine Soil pills condensed by the pill spirit were of excellent quality and were relatively rare on the market.

What surprised Chen Xiang the most was that the three Poison monkey seemed to like the Myriad Tao Divine Soil Pellet a lot. After eating it, they kept licking their little claws and he added more of them.

After letting it go three times, he put in three more Aohun holy Dan and ate them. After that, the three monkeys chirped excitedly.

"If the three of you are willing to submit to me, then I have these pills in the future." Chen Xiang’s voice sounded from within the Tianchuang furnace. He did not know if these monkeys could understand.

Just now, Song Tianchuan had also said that if it was successful, the Fury beast would release three soul threads on its own. As long as these three soul strands were kept, the Fury beast would be able to subdue them.

Chen Xiang waited for a while. When he was a little impatient, he suddenly saw that a light red thread had appeared on top of each of the three Poison monkey’s heads.

Very quickly, he established a connection with the three monkeys.

"Haha, it’s a success!" Chen Xiang suddenly laughed happily.

Song Tianchuan was the most shocked. Because he himself had once tried to tame Fury beast, he knew how difficult this was.

"This... Is this true? "Great!" Song Tianchuan still found it hard to believe.

Chen Xiang opened the cover of the Tianchuang furnace, allowing the three monkeys to come out.

Everyone jumped back when they saw the monkey, worried that they would be caught, because the monkey’s claws were highly toxic, they saw the monkey obediently squatting there. They heaved a sigh of relief and revealed a look of joy, Chen Xiang had really succeeded.

"Let’s go find Five-tiger from Fierce Saber Race." Chen Xiang laughed: "Now, we have much more confidence to deal with these five guys."

The strength of the three Poison monkey were not very strong, but they were extremely fast. Furthermore, their concealing ability was extremely strong, their claws were extremely sharp, and they even carried poison.

Chen Xiang let the three monkeys stay inside the Six Realms mirrors, then he returned back the way they came from and went to find the Five-tiger from Fierce Saber Race. In order to find them quickly, he even released the Heaven devouring rat.

"We found them, but they haven’t found us yet." Chen Xiang suddenly said softly. Through the Heaven devouring rat, he saw Five-tiger from Fierce Saber Race resting under a big tree. The moment they stepped out of the forest, they would be able to see the big tree in front of them.

"Make a plan." Song Tianchuan said.

Everyone was looking at him, because he was the captain and had a lot of experience.

"The four of us will leave first, Chen Xiang will stay here!" Song Tianchuan said: "If there is a conflict, Chen Xiang, immediately release the monkey and let the monkey scratch the five black tigers. After catching them, tell the monkey to retreat.

Chen Xiang’s mission was difficult, because the key to success or failure lay with the three Poison monkey!

"Alright!" Chen Xiang nodded.

"Yi Lan, you’re the fastest, do you think you can lure away the two Raging Blade Masters and let me deal with the strongest one! Rou Ke and Old Man Qin will take on one each. " Song Tianchuan said: "As long as we can hold on for a moment, if Chen Xiang does not succeed, we will have to use all our power to retreat."
