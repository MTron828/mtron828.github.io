Du Yanyao and Chen Xiang couldn’t help but recall what happened that day. This made the atmosphere extremely awkward, especially for Du Yanyao. That was an extremely embarrassing thing to her, and she clearly remembered her embarrassed state that day, and when she thought back to it, she really wanted to erase this memory.

"Young Master Shen, I’m actually very curious why you didn’t do anything to me back then. Under those circumstances, I can’t blame you at all." She knew that only by returning to her original self would she be able to calm her inexplicably restless heart. Otherwise, she would be extremely embarrassed in front of Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang did not expect Du Yanyao to ask such a question.

Du Yanyao stared at her and asked: "Is it because I’m not attractive enough?"

Chen Xiang laughed and said: "Of course not, to be honest, I had many bad thoughts that day, but I thought about how I am a man with a family, so I endured it!"

Seeing Chen Xiang saying that he had a family, Du Yanyao’s heart suddenly throbbed with pain. It was an unspeakable pain, but she maintained her composure and said: "Young Master Shen, the Sacred Dan School is holding a sacred pill competition, are you going to participate? is that the young Alchemist are competing on alchemy! "

"Oh? When does it start? Of course I want to join! " was happy and asked anxiously. Participating in this Pill Refining Competition would allow him to level up even faster, so if he could find the Devil-suppressing blood quickly, he planned to refine the Earth Grade Low Rank Dan here before going back.

"In a month, it will be held in Sacred Dan Realm, so the head disciple of Sacred Dan School will come to participate! I’ll join them when the time comes. " Du Yanyao was slightly happy, because she had the chance to fight against Chen Xiang.

Suddenly, Chen Xiang felt a strong Qi approaching him, and he fell to the ground with Arrogant Morale, when he heard a voice: "Yanyao, I’m coming, why don’t you welcome me?"

Du Yanyao’s face darkened, and said in a low voice: "This annoying guy is here, I’ll go out and deal with him!"

Just as Du Yanyao stood up, a figure suddenly flashed, and Chen Xiang saw a man dressed in white with disheveled hair who looked to be extremely proud and unruly appear.

He coldly swept his gaze across Chen Xiang, and saw that Du Yanyao had personally brewed some tea at the side. His eyes actually flashed a hint of killing intent, and he could tell that was extremely important to him, and other men were not allowed to approach Du Yanyao.

"Do you still need me to pick it up?" Du Yanyao said coldly.

"Yanyao, I came here this time to talk about our marriage with you, so we should set it as soon as possible!" The man said, and he completely ignored Chen Xiang. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Du Yanyao sneered: "This time, there should be at least ten women who came with you, yet you actually have the time to come here to discuss marriage matters?"

The man replied, "As long as you agree to marry me, I can make those women disappear immediately. I can never let them appear before you again."

"Hmph, then in the future when you meet a woman who is better than me, in order to obtain that woman, will you also promise her that you will make me disappear? Xie Donghao, don’t count on me marrying you. With your attitude towards women, even if all the men in the world are dead and only you are left, I will definitely not consider you. " Du Yanyao’s attitude was extremely resolute.

As if Xie Donghao was accustomed to Du Yanyao, he could tell that it wasn’t the first time Du Yanyao had rejected him in such a manner. He let out a long sigh, then looked towards Chen Xiang. "I don’t know who you are, but if you don’t want to be my enemy, you’d better stay far away from Yanyao!"

"Xie Donghao, don’t threaten my friend!" This made Xie Donghao hate Chen Xiang even more, because he understood Du Yanyao extremely well. He knew that there were not many people who could be considered Du Yanyao’s friend.

Xie Donghao did not take Du Yanyao’s words to heart, he continued to threaten Chen Xiang and said: "You better be tactful, otherwise you will become the enemy of the entire Sacred Dan School. If you do not disappear from the Sacred Dan City within an hour, you better wait and see!"

Just as she was about to speak up, Chen Xiang said with a cold smile: "You can only bring out Sacred Dan School to threaten someone else. Without Sacred Dan School, without your grandfather and father, you are just a fart! But in my eyes, it’s just a little bit better than farts! "

Xie Donghao was startled, he never thought that there would be someone who would dare speak to him like that, his brows knitted slightly, as he was trying to guess Chen Xiang’s identity, but he did not have a clue.

Seeing Chen Xiang fighting against Xie Donghao so recklessly, when Du Yanyao was worried about him, he couldn’t help but admire Chen Xiang’s boldness. In Sacred Dan City, there were also a few people more talented than Xie Donghao, but in front of Xie Donghao, they could only be meek.

"You have guts. I hope your ability can take responsibility for the things you’ve said to me!" Xie Donghao said angrily, his voice carried killing intent as he left in large strides.

"I’m sorry to have caused you trouble. Don’t worry, I will take care of it." Du Yanyao said with a face full of guilt.

"It’s not your fault. My words have truly angered him!" Chen Xiang laughed, and did not mind it in the slightest.

"Young Master Shen, you must not underestimate him. In order to achieve his goal, he must not hesitate to do anything." Du Yanyao said: "I have always hated him, but I can’t do anything to him. Furthermore, he keeps pestering me to marry him."

Du Yanyao frowned, you could see that she was worried about something.

"City Lord Du..."

"Call me Yanyao, we are already friends!" Du Yanyao said softly.

Chen Xiang laughed: "Yanyao, there is something I want to ask you, has your grandfather disappeared?"

Du Yanyao’s body trembled as she nodded her head, "He’s been missing for a long time. Our entire Du Family has been searching for him for many years, but there isn’t a single trace of him!"

"Also, Sacred Dan School already knows about this matter. Without my grandfather, our Du Family’s strength would have been greatly reduced. Sacred Dan School has always been eyeing our Du Family, wanting to annex us ... I’m worried that Sacred Dan School will forcefully arrange for my marriage with Xie Donghao at that time. "

Du Yanyao was worried about this. Although she was a City Lord of the Sacred Dan City, her strength was limited.

"Did you leave any clues behind when your grandfather left? Looks like I have to find your grandfather first. I have some things that I would like to ask him! " Chen Xiang asked.

"There are clues, but we don’t know what they are!" When Grandfather went missing, he said that he would go to the most dangerous place in Sacred Dan Realm and that there would be remnants of the Devil-suppressing Heavenly Venerable there. "

In the remnants of the Devil-suppressing Heavenly Venerable, Chen Xiang’s heart fiercely jumped!

Where is the most dangerous place in Sacred Dan Realm? Chen Xiang quickly thought of the Immortal-poisoning Devil Forest, and Du Yanyao immediately gave him the answer.

"The most dangerous place in the Sacred Dan Realm is the Immortal-poisoning Devil Forest. Grandfather is a Dan Immortal, and as long as there’s a way to go deeper in, only a small number of people in the Sacred Dan Realm would dare to go in!"
