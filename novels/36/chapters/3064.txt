"Go look for Well-informed Ghost first!" Using the Six Realms Time and Space Door, Chen Xiang actually came to the Myriad Tao Mausoleum once again.

The Well-informed Ghost had always been inside the Myriad Tao Mausoleum, and the seal on the young master of the He Clan had already been removed, but the Myriad Tao Mausoleum was already in a dilapidated state, on the verge of collapsing.

"Well-informed Ghost!" Chen Xiang came to the outside of a mountain and sent a sound transmission to the Well-informed Ghost inside.

Well-informed Ghost ran out hastily and told him what had happened in World Defying Stage Clan, as well as what had happened in Myriad Tao Mausoleum previously. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

"Show me around here. I want to see if I can collect some memories." Well-informed Ghost had the innate ability to absorb the remnants of memories in the world.

Chen Xiang rode on his Six Realms mirrors and flew around the place a few times with Well-informed Ghost. Because they had killed that kind of black clothed slave before, even though the black clothed slave’s soul had already dispersed, it was still scattered all over the place.

This was also the reason why Chen Xiang came to Well-informed Ghost, to see if Well-informed Ghost had any way of gathering any news about him.

One day passed, and Well-informed Ghost was pretty much done collecting.

"How is it?" Chen Xiang asked.

"My memories are very messy ... I never thought that the World Defying Stage Clan s would actually be so terrifying, but it’s just that the servants are so powerful. " Well-informed Ghost had already obtained a portion of the black clothed slave’s memories.

"Tell me about it!" Chen Xiang was also very curious.

"There are a total of six World Defying Stage Clan s, but the Mu Rong family and the He Clan are the two strongest, while the other four are relatively weak, so the relationship between the four World Defying Stage Clan s is quite good."

"Among them, the He Clan is the strongest, thus the young master of the He Clan was the first to come here, but the young master has never fought on his own, very few people have seen him do it, he only used the servants by his side, namely the black clothed servant and the gold clothed servant."

Chen Xiang nodded, he had seen this before!

"Where is the World Defying Stage Clan? Do you know? " Chen Xiang asked.

"They are also in the Divine Wasteland but they also have their own independent space. It would be difficult to find them." Well-informed Ghost sighed: "We can only wait for them to come out!"

"Anything else useful?" Chen Xiang asked again, "Is there anything about that He Clan’s young master?"

"That guy seems to be one of the geniuses in the He Clan. In fact, all of the geniuses in the He Clan are geniuses! I don’t know about anything else, because these black clothed slaves don’t often stay by his side, but only ask for it from the family when he needs it. "

"The black clothed slaves were raised by secret techniques. They are a group of people without feelings, so they don’t care about these things."

This made Chen Xiang a little disappointed, because his understanding of the World Defying Stage Clan s were still not good enough.

"Do you have any memories related to Murong Honglian?" Chen Xiang asked again.

"No!" Well-informed Ghost shook his head.

Seeing Chen Xiang’s disappointed look, the Well-informed Ghost continued, "Although there is no information that you need, these black clothed slaves all have a place in their minds. They are often sent to this place to find something, and this place is right in Divine Wasteland!"

"Do you know how to get there?" Chen Xiang’s eyes lit up.

"I know!" "According to the black clothed slaves’ memories, that place is very important to them, so they often go there, sometimes to search, sometimes to protect something, or to do something there. In short, they have all kinds of memories, but their memories are too messy and they are lacking a lot." The Well-informed Ghost said.

"Alright, let’s go now." Chen Xiang immediately brought Well-informed Ghost out of the Myriad Tao Mausoleum, then rode on the Six Realms mirrors and flew in the direction indicated by the Well-informed Ghost.

... ....

A woman in a white dress appeared in the air. She was hiding within the clouds and did not reveal any of her aura.

"This guy actually dared to come back. If I didn’t see it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t be able to be sure!" Murong Honglian had left her own Time and space power in the Myriad Tao Mausoleum before. Although it was very weak, it allowed her to sense some of the things that were happening inside.

At first, she didn’t believe it, but the feeling was too strong, and she had no choice but to personally rush over to take a look. She did not expect that Chen Xiang, who had escaped from the encirclement of the He Clan’s young master, would actually come back.

"Now, World Defying Stage Clan thinks that I have obtained a World Defying Green dragon! I clearly didn’t get it, but they didn’t believe what I said, and even said that I was trying to keep a low profile and deliberately hid it. " Murong Honglian was helpless in such a situation, even the people from the Mu Rong family thought that she had obtained the World Defying Green dragon.

"Looks like I can’t keep a low profile anymore!" Murong Honglian chased after him and secretly followed Chen Xiang. "This guy already noticed that I was following him last time, I definitely cannot let him find out this time."

Chen Xiang didn’t know that Murong Honglian was following behind him, and he also didn’t think that Murong Honglian would return either. Thus, he was extremely at ease as he flew with Well-informed Ghost to the place where the black clothed slaves frequently went.

His speed was very fast, and he used Time and space power to teleport a large distance away from time to time, but Murong Honglian had to struggle to keep up with him, if not for her grasping the Time and space power, she would have lost him long ago.

"If that fellow from He Clan came to follow him, he would have definitely lost him not long after. In the past, I worked so hard to learn the Time and space power, and it wasn’t in vain. " Murong Honglian could not help but reveal a sweet smile.

A few days later, Chen Xiang got closer and closer to that place.

"It’s a stone forest!" From high up in the sky, Chen Xiang had already seen many gigantic rocks in front of him. When these rocks fell onto the ground, the largest was at least three thousand meters tall, and looked like a mountain of various sizes.

However, these were not mountains. They were all broken boulders and there were even rocks that were straight like big trees. Therefore, they looked like a forest made of rocks.

"He actually wants to go here!" When Murong Honglian saw the boundless stone forest in the distance, she couldn’t help but be shocked. In the instant she was shocked, she accidentally leaked a bit of her aura.

"Someone is nearby!" Chen Xiang immediately sensed it and looked towards a white cloud in the sky. Then, using the Dao heart Eye, he saw a ball of soft red light, but that ball of red light quickly disappeared.

"Murong Honglian!" Chen Xiang shouted, "You tramp, hurry up and come out, I’ve already discovered you!"

Murong Honglian immediately teleported in front of Chen Xiang. Although Chen Xiang had said that she was a follower, she was not angry, and said with a smile: "You really have some skills, to be able to find me again."

"Why are you following me?" Although Chen Xiang was calm, he was very surprised in his heart. This woman actually knew that he was returning to the Myriad Tao Mausoleum and was following him secretly, which was extremely dangerous.

"Curious!" Murong Honglian curled his lips: "What are you doing in this place?"

"You know this place?" Chen Xiang looked at the stone forest in front of him.

"Of course I know! is right in front of us, it will be very dangerous to go in. " Murong Honglian said: "None of us World Defying Stage Clan s are allowed to enter!"
