Chapter 497 Assistance From Outside the Heaven

In order to solidify his foundation, Chen Xiang needed to stay at the early phase of Spiritual Martial Realm for a period of time. When he felt that it was about the proper time, he could immediately level up.

He gathered a large amount of power of creation liquid and passed it to Su Meiyao, allowing her and Bai Youyou to create a large amount of Pure Essence fruit and leaves in the ring.

After a few days, Chen Xiang already had a large amount of medicinal ingredients to refine the Pure Essence Golden Dan. Right now, he was continuously refining Dan, one reason of which was to help him consolidate the foundation for refining the middle grade Profound Rank Dan, and the other was to obtain a large amount of Pure Essence Golden Dan. Either he took it or sold to others, he would definitely benefit a lot from it.

Straightly, Chen Xiang had already refined the Pure Essence Golden Dan for more than two months, and he had even locked himself in the secret room while laid down a barrier to isolate the sound from the outside, allowing him to refine Dan in peace, because he wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to refine the Pure Essence Golden Dan to familiarize himself with the technique of “slowing down” time.

This was not only useful for refining pills, but also brought great benefits during battles, especially when he met those who made quick moves.

“A thousand Pure Essence Golden Dan should be enough for a very long time!” Chen Xiang looked at the baskets of golden pills, his eyes stinging from the golden light. Only a prodigy like him would be able to refine the precious Dan in baskets after baskets.

“You do have made a great progress. It seems that you have already gotten used to and mastered higher level Dan refining techniques, especially observing those high-speed changes.” Su Meiyao said. Chen Xiang’s rapid progress made her gasp in amazement, but she was already used to it.

Chen Xiang stretched lazily and said with a smile, “Sister Meiyao, I’m really tired right now, why don’t you help me wash up?"

“No way, don’t even think about it." Su Meiyao coquettishly said.

He took a hot bath and flirted with Su Meiyao before lying on the soft bed and having a good sleep.

The next day, Chen Xiang who was having a beautiful dream suddenly heard someone call out to him.

“Chen Xiang ...Chen Xiang ...”

Chen Xiang immediately opened his eyes, because this was Wu Qianqian’s voice. Her return did make him happy. After all, she was very beautiful. Even without the noble postures like that of Liu Menger or Hua Xiangyue, her looking and body were pretty attractive.

“Qianqian, I missed you so much!” Chen Xiang grinned as he opened the door.

Wu Qianqian giggled as a sweet smile appeared on her beautiful face, “you really miss me?”

Chen Xiang welcomed Wu Qianqian into the living room and asked, “Qianqian, where have you been? I can’t even find you!”

“I have gone into a closed-door training. It was Elder Dan who arranged it. However, no matter how hard I try, I will not be able to catch up with you! Sigh ...” Wu Qianqian sighed. She was such a competitive woman.

Even though Wu Qianqian said so, Chen Xiang felt that it was not easy for her. She was now a Stage Nine Warrior of the True Martial Realm. Chen Xiang wanted to know what methods Elder Dan had used to make her grow up so quickly!

"Do you have any business with me? Or you really miss me? "

Wu Qianqian smiled sweetly with her eyes squeezed. She was originally a prideful woman, but after Chen Xiang lectured her, she completely changed. Right now, the white dress she wore was very old, but it was very clean. Although she didn’t have any gorgeous clothes, her bright and sweet smile, beautiful face, and mature charm made her seem like a carefree person.

“Yes, both of them!” As Chen Xiang spoke, he took out a few storage pouches, "These are all True Essence Dan, White Jade Powder, Foundation Building Dan, Bone Cleansing Dan, and Five Elements True Essence Dan. I don’t remember how much there are. Just take and refine them!”

Wu Qianqian already knew that Chen Xiang was very generous, but before this, she had only given him some gradients of True Essence Dan. Now, he even had Foundation Establishment Dan and Five Elements True Essence Dan, which were all low grade Profound Rank Dan and extremely precious.

“You better hurry up and learn how to refine it. Don’t waste too many medicinal herbs! If Elder Dan asks about it, just say that I gave it to you! According to the previous agreement, once you have successfully refined one portion, you take one of your own, and give me everything left.” Chen Xiang said. He had a lot of these herbs, but he was too lazy to waste time on them.

This was a great opportunity, so Wu Qianqian certainly wouldn’t refuse. She smiled sweetly and said, “You are so generous. How should I repay you?”

“What about a night with me?” Chen Xiang said in a bad smile, which made Wu Qianqian blush slightly.

“Aren’t you afraid that your little fairy wife will be jealous?” Wu Qianqian’s smile was very enchanting and her seductive demeanor was extremely seductive. Chen Xiang’s heart rippled as he watched.

“Hehe, I was just joking!” As Chen Xiang spoke, he couldn’t help but look at Wu Qianqian’s chest. It was actually a lot bigger, making him feel that women were ever-changing.

After Wu Qianqian put away the bags of holding, she said, “I came back this time because I wanted to go to the Demon Subduing Academy to learn some abilities, but I couldn’t meet the requirements. They only recruit those who have reached the Extreme Realm.”

“The Demon Subduing Academy? What is it?” Chen Xiang asked in a query. He hadn’t come out for just two months, but something like this suddenly popped up. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You don’t know about it?” Wu Qianqian said in surprise, “both of your fairy wife and white-haired sister are inside it! How could you not know about it?”

Out of his expectation, both Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan went to that so-called Demon Subduing Academy. Chen Xiang was even more puzzled. However, he was happy that Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan both stepped into the Extreme Realm. Wu Qianqian had said earlier that only the Extreme Realm martial artists could enter.

“Tell me about it. I’ve been here too long.” Chen Xiang hurriedly asked.

"You better ask the Headmaster. He might be able to speak in more details. I am leaving first. The next time we meet, I’ll definitely be able to bring back a lot of Dan for you. " Wu Qianqian smiled at Chen Xiang before turning around to leave.

Chen Xiang quickly found Gu Dongchen.

“Junior master, I yelled till my throat broke, but you didn’t even come out to see me. Now you know the consequences of not seeing me, don’t you?” Gu Dongchen crossed his arms in front of his chest and said with a smile.

Chen Xiang grunted as he took out a Pure Essence Golden Dan and threw it over, “I’m making this. Hurry up and tell me. After that, I’ll make a deal with you.”

After receiving the Pure Essence Golden Dan, Gu Dongchen immediately recognized it. He shouted excitedly, “It’s really a gift to me. This is good stuff!”

However, when he thought of making a deal with Chen Xiang, Gu Dongchen’s heart couldn’t help but hurt. He knew that Chen Xiang would definitely benefit a lot from him.

“The Demon Subduing Academy appears out of nowhere a month ago. Just like the Fire God Shrine, it was from other worlds. However, unlike the Fire God Shrine, the Demon Subduing Academy does not aim to monopolizing the entire Mortal Martial Realm.”

As Gu Dongchen spoke, he carefully looked at the golden pellet in his hand. He was sure that this was a Pure Essence Golden Dan, a middle grade Profound Rank Dan, which could help a man quickly obtain a large amount of True Qi. It was very useful, especially for warriors at Stage Eight and Nine of the True Martial Realm.

“The goal of this Demon Subduing Academy ...is to impart some martial arts techniques that can deal with fiendish demons to young martial artists with great potential and outstanding strength in this Mortal Martial Realm. It also recruits young martial artists from other worlds who are all geniuses of this region.”

Gu Dongchen returned the Pure Essence Gold Dan to Chen Xiang and said, “I suggest you go inside to learn some martial arts techniques to deal with fiendish demons, as well as some knowledge of the fiendish Demon Realm.”
