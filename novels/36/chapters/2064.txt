"Lingling, you have become stronger. Chen Xiang rubbed her head and looked at her mature and beautiful face. In the past, when she was still very young, Chen Xiang would often be busy outside, and she would also undergo closed door cultivation all day. It had been many years since they last met.

The Shen Lingling after growing up had a very charming face, but although she was charming, she was not like the enchantress Su Meiyao, Hua Xiangyue, and Yan Yanran. With every frown and smile, her every action was extremely charming, captivating people’s hearts, Shen Lingling was different from the rest.

"It’s been so long since we last met, Lingling has also become a little beauty." She nodded towards Long Huishan. Back then, she had also helped Long Huishan to manage his business for a period of time, so the two of them were very familiar with each other.

"Damn brat, you are always running all over the place. Why aren’t you coming back to see me and your little sisters?" Long Huishan mercilessly hit Chen Xiang’s head. "You, Lingling, are already so old, but I’ve never seen you do it a few times. All you know is that you’ve been stuffed in my place."

Yan Yanran walked to Shen Lingling’s side, caressed her face and smiled seductively: "Lingling is a beauty that can seduce all living things now, and her strength seems to be not bad either."

Lan Lan was a little envious. She pouted and said, "Why can’t I grow up? Back then, Lingling was only slightly taller than me.

As Shen Lingling and Yan Yanran stood together, and wore the same bright red cheongsam, it made them seem even more charming and gorgeous. Walking on the street just like that, it must have been very eye-catching, especially under circumstances where they were equally charming, but gave off a completely different feeling to others, it was even more eye-catching.

"Sister Lan Lan, this is also very good." Shen Lingling was naive and innocent, but she had a charming face that could bring calamity to a nation. She always felt that this would be more eye-catching, and she did not like it.

"Hui Shan, have you decided to stay with us?" Lv Qilian asked: "You Lan and the others should have told you guys before."

After all, Youlan and the others are all there. However, the Ice Dragon Ancestor needed some time to teach me the things he could teach. When Long Huishan sat down, he leaned forward and grabbed a fruit by the side and began to eat, "Frozen Dragon Ancestor originally planned to go to Super God Realm, but when he heard that Chen Xiang had returned, he did not go as well. He had mentioned to me earlier that Heavenly Divine Lord’s Great Divine Lord was summoning him."

Back then, the ice dragon had received Chen Xiang’s great help to awaken its memories, allowing it to shake off the God of Fortune’s bondage. Thus, when he found out that Shen Lingling and Long Huishan were sisters that had been sworn brothers of Chen Xiang, they took special care of them and gave them everything they had.

"We are going to the City Lord’s Mansion for a meeting later, Chen Xiang, you and Hui Shan will follow me, you guys stay here, the Fu Tian School will also participate." Lv Qilian said: "Lingling, you can return to the Hundreds of Flowers Village with Purple Orchid first and familiarize yourself with the environment inside. The battles here aren’t suitable for you."

Shen Lingling nodded, she stood up on her tiptoes and kissed Chen Xiang on the cheek, then followed Yan Zilan and left.

"Truly a good little sister. You Lan and Qianxiang, these two wild girls, think of defeating me everyday." Chen Xiang touched the place where Shen Lingling kissed, and laughed.

"Yanran, Lan Lan, you guys will be in charge of collecting information related to the Fu Tian School. A large group of people will be coming here, so it’s impossible for them to all go to the City Lord’s Mansion for meetings. Lv Qilian warned them, "You must be careful of them. If anything goes wrong, run back to the Hundred Flowers Pavilion.

Yan Yanran had experienced Yan Yanran’s and his concealed abilities before, but she herself was unable to see through it. Furthermore, the few big shots of Nine Heaven School had also tested it, but it still wasn’t working, and only Chen Xiang was able to do it.

"Now let’s go, Hui Shan. I will tell you some important things on the way, so that you can understand the situation." Lv Qilian felt that the Fu Tian School had other purposes. If their current Leader was really the one that Yan Yanran and Lan Lan met, then the Fu Tian School would definitely not be a good person.

Lv Qilian brought Chen Xiang and the others and walked onto a caravan. This carriage did not have a horse to drag, but it could move by itself, its speed could also be fast, and it could even fly outside.

"This car is so nice, and it has such a big bed." After Chen Xiang climbed up, the room was very big. There was a bed and a low table, the floor was covered with a snow-white soft fur, the decorations were very beautiful, and Chen Xiang was rolling around on top of it. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This carriage was about the same size as the carriage, but its interior was about the size of a hall. It was arranged using spatial runes.

"Brat, be more honest. This is Qilian’s chariot, it’s not a dog’s nest." When Long Huishan saw Chen Xiang rolling around impolitely to lie on Lv Qilian’s bed, she felt that he must be enduring his anger.

Chen Xiang laughed, "She will not mind, right Sister Qilian."

Of course, she wouldn’t mind. She and Chen Xiang had already passed many sweet dreams, and her heart had long been conquered by Chen Xiang. If Long Huishan wasn’t here, she would have been sweet and intimate with him.

"Big Sister Hui Shan, don’t you feel that you’re a bit in the way here?" Chen Xiang snorted, his face filled with a dubious expression.

Lv Qilian glared at Chen Xiang, her face turning slightly red. Only now did Long Huishan finally understand, she did not expect Lv Qilian to be so close to Chen Xiang.

"Brat, alright, you’ve even taken care of Qilian, you’re amazing." Long Huishan praised her wholeheartedly, but she also knew about Chen Xiang’s playfulness.

"How is it amazing? If I can deal with Big Sister Hui Shan, that would be amazing." Chen Xiang laughed sinisterly.

Long Huishan laughed and said to Lv Qilian: "Qilian, aren’t you going to do something now? Your man is teasing me."

Chen Xiang laughed and said: "Originally, I wanted to do something with me, but since you are here ... "Cough, cough."

"You can completely ignore me. You don’t have to care about what I feel. You can do whatever you want with me." Just as Long Huishan finished speaking, she regretted it. She did not expect Chen Xiang to suddenly flash and appear by his side.

The moment Lv Qilian saw Chen Xiang coming over, she threw herself onto the soft carpet, and her sandalwood mouth was violently blocked by Chen Xiang. Although her body was struggling, for some reason, her power had started to gradually weaken, and after that she had obeyed Chen Xiang and kissed him in front of Long Huishan.

Long Huishan scoffed, "This little bastard is getting more and more presumptuous. If there’s a chance, I’ll teach him a lesson." She had seen a big scene before, but she had never seen this scene of a man and woman kissing passionately before.
