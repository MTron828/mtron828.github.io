Chen Xiang sighed, and said: "You are my most useless master!"

Xiao Xianglin was unconvinced: "What do you mean? I don’t have the ability? Do you still have a lot of masters before this? "

Chen Xiang did indeed have several masters.

"Master, you brought your disciple out to gain experience, how can you be so sneaky? If you don’t feel aggrieved, even I, as your disciple, feel very aggrieved! You are now a person who has a disciple, and not a spoiled brat like before. You must show your tyranny as a teacher! " Chen Xiang said snappily: "That day when you were riding on your eight dragon elephants, how domineering were you? What happened to your power and influence on the tenth floor? Where did they all go? Did you feed the dogs!? "

Being scolded by Chen Xiang, although Xiao Xianglin was furious, she could not say anything. She was not afraid of anything, but she was afraid of her parents.

Chen Xiang hugged his chest and curled his lips: "I’m already so much more domineering than you, I’m not afraid by that much."

Xiao Xianglin patted Chen Xiang’s chest and shouted: "Alright, then what do you think we should do?"

"How? "Of course it’s to release your two great dragon elephants and drag your huge carriage inside. Who would dare to be cocky in front of you? You can just scold them." Chen Xiang replied: "Using the most arrogant words to reply to those who come to block our path, no matter who it is." "Please get to 800 after reading the latest chapter in this book."

With that, Chen Xiang anxiously said: "No, I should let Yu’er or Xiang’er speak arrogantly. Master does not speak, and only let the female servant by my side speak arrogantly, that way I can act even more arrogantly."

Xiao Xianglin thought for a while, in order to not let her disciple look down on her, she could only bite the bullet and do it. She snorted, then said to the two beautiful female slaves: "You two little girls should have heard it already, when that time comes, no matter how arrogant you are, just pull as much as you can!"

"Got it!" Liu’er and Xiang’er said in unison. It was rare that their big sister had such a domineering attitude. Fiction)

Xiao Xianglin released his two dragon elephants and sighed. "These two girls’ dragon elephants are too small, and I only have two dragon elephants, so I don’t have enough momentum.

Chen Xiang thought for a while, before releasing a dozen Heaven devouring rat s, and said: "Let’s use this thing."

Just as Xiao Xianglin wanted to say "this is it", he saw that the dozens of Heaven devouring rat had suddenly grown big and looked exactly like her dragon elephant.

"It just can’t fly!" Chen Xiang laughed: "Do you have any ideas?"

"I told my dragon elephant to release a flying domain. As long as it’s something within the domain, it can float. These rats ..." "It’s just a show." Xiao Xianglin touched the dragon elephants that the Heaven devouring rat had turned into and laughed, "They look pretty good!"

Heaven devouring rat s could increase along with Chen Xiang’s strength. Currently, Heaven devouring rat s were all at the Peak of World Defying crazy realm or the early stages of Aoshi Holy Stage, so they were not too weak.

"Chen Xiang, you really have all sorts of methods!" The mischievous Liu’er had already jumped onto the back of the Heaven devouring rat dragon elephant and felt that she was no different from a real dragon elephant.

Just like this, Xiao Xianglin used the 16 dragon elephants to pull the carriage and flew in the air.

"Sixteen dragon elephants pulling a carriage, it seems like there has never been one before!" Xiang’er stood in front of the carriage house door and looked at the sixteen mighty dragon and elephant, which were like small hills, and laughed.

"Only two are real!" Xiao Xianglin said.

"Enough, just scare them. Who doesn’t know that we are from the Dragon Elephant Sect?" Could it be that they really dare to go up? " Yu’er said.

The disciples of the ten great sects usually only had a little conflict, there had never been any kind of violent conflict before. The Dragon Elephant Sect itself was an alliance with the Tao-creation, so Gu Tong had always been inside the Dragon Elephant Gate.

"Elder Gu Tong often comes to our Dragon Elephant Sect. Elder Gu Tong also has a very high position in the Tao-creation, even the Leader has to be respectful to him. No one dares to bully our Dragon Elephant Sect." Xiao Xianglin nodded his head, "I don’t know why, but not long after he arrived at our Dragon Elephant’s Gate, Luo Jiuyang arrived!"

"Could it be that they made an agreement?" Chen Xiang said: "Your Dragon Elephant Clan has mastered unique Fusion spell. It is very clear that Gu Tong frequently comes to this series of doors for the sake of the Fusion spell."

"That’s possible! However, Elder Gu Tong is a good person, and will often guide our Dragon Elephant Sect’s disciples in refining. " Xiao Xianglin said.

The reason why Chen Xiang went to the Tao-creation’s Door was to see Gu Tong, but he didn’t think that he would be able to see Gu Tong in the Dragon and Elephant’s Door. He was currently Xiao Xianglin’s disciple, so he might be able to see Gu Tong more often.

... ....

At the bottom of the Headless Mountain Range, there were a few Dragon and Elephant Scouts hiding in the trees. When they saw a large black mass flying over from the sky, they took a careful look and could not help but take deep breaths.

"What’s going on? Was that the dragon elephant I saw just now? Sixteen Dragon Elephants! "

"You’re not wrong, it’s just 16 dragon elephants. Although they have restrained their aura, you can still feel the aura of a dragon elephant!"

"That car looks very familiar. It’s ..."

"It’s from Senior Sister Xiao Xianglin, why does she have sixteen dragon elephants? That’s impossible! Her parents are both elders and the main force of the army this time. They have their dragon and elephant with them, so it’s impossible for them to lend them to her.

"Right, didn’t the elders say so? This Senior Sister Xiao has come. She wants to immediately inform him and then block Senior Sister Xiao from entering into the depths of the mountain. "

It was not only the Dragon Elephant Door’s spies that saw it. The spies from the other sects, families, Dragon Controlling Palace and other forces also saw the domineering sixteen Dragon Elephants pulling the caravan in the sky.

They were not spies from the Dragon Elephant Door and were not familiar with Xiao Xianglin’s caravan. They only thought that the old geezers from the Dragon Elephant Door had arrived, and sent messages back to him.

The spies of the Dragon Elephant’s Door did not know what was going on, but the higher-ups had given the order, so they could only go and stop them.

A few spies released their own dragon elephant and then rode it into the sky.

"Senior Sister Xiao, is that you? Junior Martial Brother Wu Zhong, you are ordered to receive Senior Martial Sister Xiao here. " A black clothed man said.

"On whose orders?" Xiang’er asked coldly.

"Senior sister Xiao’s father, Elder Xiao!" Wu Zhong hurriedly said. He could tell that it was Xiang’er’s voice, who among the male disciples inside the dragon and elephant gate did not know that Xiao Xianglin was always accompanied by Xiang’er and Yu’er, these two beautiful female slaves.

After all, she was a disciple of his clan. Xiao Xianglin sent a sound transmission to Xiang’er, telling her not to be so arrogant, so that she wouldn’t meet him in the future and act normal.

"Understood. Thank you for receiving us. We need to hurry to the depths of the mountain range." Xiang’er said.

At this time, Wu Zhong received a reply from Xiao Xianglin’s father, Elder Xiao: "Let them through!"

Wu Zhong did not know what had happened, so he moved aside, but after he did, he saw that there were a few people approaching from the distance, who were stepping on divine swords. Chen Xiang could already see that there was someone he was extremely familiar with inside: the white clothed man who had been slashed apart by him.
