Just as the He Clan elder flew over, he sensed that someone was following behind him. He was greatly alarmed, as if he had thought of something, but it was already too late!

Chen Xiang had already made his move, when the Heavenly magic sword appeared, it instantly flashed with a cold light, the old man’s head that was just about to turn, had already landed on the ground! When everyone saw this sudden scene, they could not help but be dumbstruck.

The incomparably powerful old man from the He Clan was killed just like that, and the person who made a move easily chopped off that head.

"You ... Who exactly are you? " The He Clan Elder looked at the indifferent Chen Xiang. He remembered that the person in front of him was also recruited by them.

"If you kill me, aren’t you afraid of getting the antidote pill?" Although the old man’s head was chopped off, he did not lose it. His body was already being stepped on by Chen Cai as he searched through the items.

"Just who are you!" The He Clan elder could not help but be alarmed, the person in front of him was clearly not an ordinary person, why would such a capable guy sneak in, he must have a reason.

"You want to know? I’m not going to tell you. Chen Xiang kicked the head away and released a Heaven Blasting Palm and a World Defying god fire. The head exploded into dust.

After exterminating the old man from the He Clan, Chen Xiang looked at the astonished crowd and laughed: "I’m a Alchemist, you don’t have to worry about the matter of the Antidote Pill, I can refine enough antidote pills for you guys."

"Brother, is this true? I thought we’d be like this for the rest of our lives! " The youth from before shouted excitedly.

"Your antidote pills can last for two more days, can’t you?" Chen Xiang said: "Wait for two days, I should be able to help you guys get it over and over with."

After that, Chen Xiang and Chen Cai brought this group of people to a place to hide and helped them refine the antidote. Chen Xiang first concocted antidote temporarily, so it wouldn’t take him too long to concoct a lot of antidote in a short period of time.

This took him a full ten days to complete. At this moment, everyone’s poison had been dispelled, and they were all overjoyed.

In order to settle them down, Chen Xiang contacted the Heavenly Dragon City, had the Heavenly Dragon City send people over, and then led the group of people to various places in the Natural Law World to settle down.

"I haven’t met any Tiangu beast yet!" Chen Cai laughed: "He Clan would definitely ache over losing such an old fellow, haha, what a great pleasure."

"We need to find the Tiangu beast. We need to get rid of them as soon as possible." Chen Xiang was currently not in a good mood. He was the one in charge of managing this Natural Law World, and now, someone was messing around in his world, releasing a large number of Tiangu beast to harm this world. This made him very angry.

"Heaven Old Divine Race, the one who bullied me was not strong enough, just you wait." Chen Xiang closed his eyes and searched through the entire Natural Law World, quickly locating a few Tiangu beast.

"There are more than a hundred of them, and a Tiangu beast is approaching a city." Chen Xiang clenched his fists. Although it had been more than ten days, these Tiangu beast had not started their destruction and were just wandering around.

"Let’s go!" Chen Xiang brought Chen Cai and quickly teleported to the Tiangu beast that was approaching the city.

In the blink of an eye, Chen Xiang and Chen Cai arrived at the Tiangu beast’s location.

This Tiangu beast was like a crocodile, but it was extremely huge. Its body was hundreds of meters long, and its entire body was covered with dense black spikes.

"This is the Tiangu beast!" Chen Cai said: "Those spikes are their beast fur, they have extremely strong defensive power, ordinary Divine Weapons would not be able to break through their defenses."

"Try this one and you’ll know." Chen Xiang took out the Heavenly magic sword, then teleported over.

Just in case, he had released the black long whip in the past and had this black long whip tie the Tiangu beast up.

Chen Cai originally wanted to go and help, but seeing that Chen Xiang had released a very powerful black whip to tie the Tiangu beast up, he felt that there was no need to go over there.

"This whip is really powerful!" Chen Xiang had thought that the Tiangu beast would break free, but the Tiangu beast only roared and rolled on the ground, its spiky fur constantly trembling.

"Bastard, prepare to die!" Chen Xiang landed, and the Heavenly magic sword easily stabbed into the Tiangu beast’s head. Under his control, the Heavenly magic sword entered the inner part of the Tiangu beast’s head and started hacking inside, and in that short period of time, the Tiangu beast was killed.

"This big guy is really big, he has quite a lot of fur on him." When Chen Cai arrived at the bottom of the Tiangu beast’s corpse, he felt as if he was at the bottom of a small mountain. He walked over and pulled out a sharp thorn.

"Is there really a Myriad Tao Divine Soil here?" Chen Xiang asked: "I’ll leave this corpse to you. If I refine the Myriad Tao Divine Soil, I will give you some." VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

"Sure!" Chen Cai laughed: "That whip of yours is not bad, can you let me have a look?"

Chen Xiang passed the whip over. After Chen Cai received it and examined it, he exclaimed: "This is made using the Myriad Tao Divine Soil s, and the number of Myriad Tao Divine Soil s used is not any less than yours. It’s just that, due to the different effects, it wasn’t refined into a sharp weapon."

This whip seemed to be able to extend its length infinitely, if not Chen Xiang would not have been able to bind this mountainous Tiangu beast just now.

"Is it really the Myriad Tao Divine Soil? "No wonder he’s so powerful!" Chen Xiang had been bound before, so he couldn’t struggle free at all.

"Hehe, you really have a lot of good stuff! "It seems like I don’t need to help you hunt the beasts. I will just follow behind you and collect the corpses." Chen Cai laughed.

Because Chen Xiang was in charge of the Natural Law World, when he closed his eyes, he could see the entire world. The size of the Tiangu beast wasn’t small, and it was very easy for him to find them.

In just a short three days, all hundred Tiangu beast had been killed by him and the Natural Law World had temporarily escaped calamity!

"They will come back!" Chen Cai said: "Your Natural Law World space is too weak, you need strengthening!"

"How?" Chen Xiang didn’t understand this.

"Well... I don’t know either, but the strength of this world is closely related to your own strength. Try and see if you can use your own strength to strengthen this world. " Chen Cai thought for a while, then said: "But before that, let’s go kill the World Defying Stage Clan and the people of Heaven Old Divine Race, it’s not good to have them here."
