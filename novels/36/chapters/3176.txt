With the pill spirit as a reward, if he had obtained it, Chen Xiang wouldn’t have to work so hard to refine it. It had to be known that this was a middle ranked Berserk Pill Spirit, even Yue Yiran had difficulty refining it.

The current Chen Xiang did not have the strength to refine a middle stage arrogant pill spirit. Even if he had that power, it would be extremely difficult.

Seeing how confident Chen Xiang was, Yue Yiran was also looking forward to it. If Chen Xiang could defeat the spirit of the Heavenly Dan Landlord, then it would become a legend.

Here, most of the Heaven Old Divine Race looked down upon humans, and in the pill refining domain, humans were looked down upon even more, so if Chen Xiang could defeat other Heaven Old Divine Race people and still have a pill spirit in pill refining, who knew what the proud Heaven Old Divine Race people would think.

At this time, the other Heaven Old Divine Race s were all discussing with the elders of the clan. Those elders had also temporarily transferred some knowledge to them.

Big now? If the abcxs haven’t been set up yet, it would definitely be very beneficial to that Fierce-transformation Dan Spirit.

"Everyone is ready. I will announce the rules now." The Heavenly Dan Landlord said loudly: "The rules are simple, the battle this time is only one round and it determines the outcome."

"All you need to do is refine the Huakuan Dan within two hours, and the evaluation criteria will be who can refine the most pellets, and who will obtain the final victory."

It was actually refining a Huakuan Dan!

The Fierce-transformation Dan Spirit herself could condense Huakuan Dan, she did not need any medicinal ingredients, so no one could see how fair this competition was.

Heavenly Dan Landlord was not nervous at all after hearing everyone’s complaints. He laughed and said that if he were to condense himself, everyone would be able to see it. "

"If the Fierce-transformation Dan Spirit were to refine his own Huakuan Dan, he would be able to condense two pellets in two hours. It is very fast." Yue Yiran told Chen Xiang that he understood and in short, this Heavenly Dan Landlord coming up with such a rule would definitely benefit them greatly. "

"Under normal circumstances, how many pellets can a Huakuan Dan refine in two hours?" Chen Xiang asked.

"If it’s an old guy like us, we can only make three pills in two hours. We need to guarantee the quality. If we can’t guarantee the quality, four or five pills shouldn’t be a problem. We can even make six or seven." Yue Yiran said: "As for you youngsters, if you can refine two pellets in two hours, you would be considered a genius. If you can refine three pellets, you would be considered a genius amongst geniuses."

"I’ve never tried!" Chen Xiang laughed bitterly, "I know, I was doing other things before!"

Of course, Yue Yiran knew that Chen Xiang had been refining pills and was close to success. Compared to refining Huakuan Dan, Chen Xiang’s achievements were huge.

"It doesn’t matter. Even if it fails, it’s fine. Just treat it as an opportunity to train yourself." Yue Yiran laughed.

Now that Chen Xiang could refine a pill spirit, this kind of pill technique was extremely powerful. Furthermore, Yue Yiran had the time to refine it now, he felt that he would definitely be able to succeed.

"I heard that the prince of Heaven Old Imperial Family was able to refine three Huakuan Dan in two hours.

"Maybe he can beat that pill spirit! Didn’t the Heaven Old Imperial Family send out the news last time? The three Huakuan Dan s that this prince refined in two hours were all of pretty good quality. "

"This competition does not have any requirements, so there is no pressure. Who knows, I might be able to refine four or five pills in two hours."

"This time, a genius disciple from a large clan is not an ordinary person. Refining Huakuan Dan s shouldn’t be too difficult for them. What’s more, how can they refine even more?"

"No, no, that’s not right. The guy from Yue Clan’s store is a human, even though this guy can defeat Zhen Minghui, he’s just a human after all."

"That’s right, and it’s so weak!"

"Yue Yiran will be blamed by the Yue Clan this time."

Chen Xiang heard the people around talking about him and couldn’t help but to shake his head and laugh.

"Boss, I didn’t expect that the shop belonged to your Yue Clan." Only now did Chen Xiang know that there was actually a family behind Yue Yiran.

"Yes, we have a lot of shops here. I’m the one in charge of managing that shop ..." However, your presence here does not represent our Yue Clan. It is merely representing my shop, that’s all. "

Heavenly Dan Landlord was making everyone prepare for the competition, and when the news of the pill spirit as a reward spread, the entire city was shocked.

Originally, many people did not know about the matter of the pill spirit. However, a few days ago, when the Heavenly Dan Landlord spread this matter, it was already known by many people and they were extremely envious of it.

Therefore, it could be said that the Heavenly Dan Landlord was rewarded with a pill spirit, which was very generous.

"Second Brother, do you have the confidence to win!?" An old man suddenly walked over and looked at Chen Xiang with disdain.

Behind the old man were a few young people. These young people all had haughty looks, and looked at Chen Xiang with seemingly arrogant eyes. They did not look down on him at all.

"Yes!" When Yue Yiran saw this old man, his face revealed a look of disgust.

"Hmph, someone like him can actually win?" The young man behind the old man sneered.

That old man was a member of the Yue Clan,’s cousin. His name was Yue Yan, and he was also an alchemist, though his alchemy skills were not as good as Yue Yiran’s.

Right now, he was in charge of most of the pill shops in the Yue Clan, so Yue Yiran only stayed alone.

However, many people still treated him as a part of the Yue Clan’s shop.

"The victory has nothing to do with you guys, he is not here to represent the Yue family." Yue Yiran looked coldly at the young man, and thought: What do you know! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Yue Yiran knew very well that Chen Xiang could refine a pill spirit. Amongst the young Alchemist, Chen Xiang could now look down on all the heroes and even the older Alchemist s.

"Since all of you look down on him so much, why have you come here?" Yue Yiran said in a displeased tone, his expression ice-cold.

"We only came here to tell you not to let this guy represent the Yue Clan in the competition. We can’t afford to lose face." After Yue Yan finished speaking, he snorted and left with his men.
