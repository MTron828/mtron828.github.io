Chapter 525 Seizing the Soul (Part Two)

Liao Shaoyun fell into a berserk state. He was constantly erupting the energy in his body, making him stronger. Even with the protection of Black Tortoise Armament Armor, Chen Xiang’s blood was still surging from the violent thunder.

“Let’s leave now. We still have chances in the future, I cannot hold on much longer!” Long Xueyi hurriedly urged Chen Xiang to leave. Because it was a fusion process, she wouldn’t give all her power to Chen Xiang, partly for herself and to protect Chen Xiang.

“Let’s go!” Bai Youyou coldly shouted. She did not want Chen Xiang to put himself in danger. Now that Chen Xiang had achieved his goal of making Liao Shaoyun seriously injured and obtaining his Thunder Soul.

Chen Xiang was reluctant to leave. He snorted and started running fast. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared from this messy place. There was indeed a chance for him to kill Liao Shaoyun, and that was a very rare opportunity. However, if he failed to hit Liao Shaoyun, then his strength would be depleted, and at that time, Liao Shaoyun would launch a counterattack and killed him.

Therefore, Long Xueyi and Bai Youyou couldn’t let him take the risk!

“Chen Xiang, I will do whatever it takes to make you beg for death!” Liao Shaoyun’s hair was disheveled and his eyes were red. He raised his head and laughed harshly. That vicious voice spread for hundreds of miles, and almost everyone in the Demon Subduing Academy could hear it.

As long as one was not deaf, he or she could tell that Liao Shaoyun was infuriated by Chen Xiang. This caused everyone to be confused, because Chen Xiang’s strength was only at a level that he could not force Liao Shaoyun to make such an oath.

Chen Xiang hid far away and coldly snorted, “what did he do to me back then? I haven’t gotten it back yet!”

The moment Long Xueyi’s power left Chen Xiang’s body, he immediately felt a sharp pain. Even so, he still had to endure it because there was a Thunder Soul that could explode at any time in his body. Right now, he needed to quickly find Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan.

Chen Xiang was worried that Liao Shaoyun would try to kill the two ladies. Previously, Liao Shaoyun might have some misgivings, but now that he was enraged, he would do anything to deal with him.

With Long Xueyi’s help, Chen Xiang quickly found out where the two girls were located. Enduring the pain, he started to run for them.

Both Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan seemed serious in a forest. When they heard Liao Shaoyun’s furious voice, they couldn’t help but worry about Chen Xiang. At this moment, they really wanted to find out what had happened. There was a great battle between experts in the Demon Subduing Academy, and Liao Shaoyun was enraged by Chen Xiang. They could not help but linking the two things together.

When Chen Xiang entered the forest, Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan immediately jumped down from the tree. When they saw Chen Xiang arriving with a pale face, they hurriedly flew over and supported him. The two ladies felt sad of his situation.

“Brother, what exactly happened?” Leng Youlan frowned as she wiped the sweat off Chen Xiang’s forehead.

Chen Xiang hurriedly grabbed the hands of the two ladies and solemnly said, “let’s leave this place first. For now, there’s nothing for us to do.”

Liao Shaoyun went into a frenzy for a while before regaining his senses and chasing after the aura left behind by Chen Xiang. Only now did he realize that Chen Xiang did not take the opportunity to kill him because he did not have the ability to.

“He’s coming! Although this guy is injured, the True Qi in his body is very thick!” Long Xueyi shouted in surprise.

Chen Xiang, who was originally pulling the two ladies, immediately stopped running. He took out the Luotian Gate and activated it, opening up a spatial gate.

Seeing the spatial gate, Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan didn’t have the chance to be surprised before they were pulled by Chen Xiang into it. The spatial gate disappeared as they entered, leaving no target for Liao Shaoyun who had arrived later.

Chen Xiang’s aura suddenly disappeared, which caused Liao Shaoyun to roar out again! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“It’s safe!” Chen Xiang looked at the boundless sea in front of him and let out a long sigh. At this moment, he was already exhausted. The Thunder Soul that was suppressed in his body also gradually became violent.

Chen Xiang passed through the Luotian Gate and arrived at a small island that was quite far away from the King’s Continent.

Even though Leng Youlan and Xue Xian had many questions in their hearts, they didn’t ask out. Instead, they placed the powerless Chen Xiang in a more comfortable place.

“Brother, how could you go for Liao Shaoyun? It’s too risky.” Even the usually bustle Leng Youlan knew that Chen Xiang should not do this.

“That’s right. You scared me to death!” Xue Xianxian was indeed frightened by Chen Xiang’s appearance to the point that her face turned pale.

Chen Xiang grabbed Xue Xianxian’s jade-like hand and faintly smiled, “I’m fine now. No matter what happens later, don’t worry. That’s a very normal thing!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Chen Xiang’s eyebrows tightly knitted together. He knew that he could not suppress the Thunder Soul any longer. At that time, he would need to fuse with it!

He already possessed the Heaven and Earth Fire Soul, while he wasn’t sure what rank the Thunder Soul was, but it was very strong. Thinking about the pain of fusing with this martial spirit caused Chen Xiang to feel endless fear.

“What’s going to happen?” Leng Youlan’s face was filled with anxiety. This was the first time she had seen Chen Xiang like this, which made her extremely worried.

"I am going to fuse with a Thunder Soul! The process will be very painful, but I already get experience, so you don’t have to worry about me. " Chen Xiang said. He had fused with martial spirits twice and was very experienced. Thus, he believed that he would definitely be able to succeed in doing so.

Hearing that he was going to fuse with a Thunder Soul, Xue Xianxian was quite frightened. Chen Xiang once told her that fusing with the Fire Soul was extremely painful. Even her master, Liu Menger, couldn’t bear it.

However, it was not the time to worry. Xue Xianxian must calm down. Her delicate eyebrows creased, as she stood up and looked around, then discovered a large mountain and a small forest on this island.

“Youlan, take Xiang into the forest first. We’ll work together to make a cave in that mountain. He cannot be disturbed while fusing with the Thunder Soul.” Xue Xianxian calmly said.

Leng Youlan also had a lot of experience, so she quickly calmed down. The most important thing was to get Chen Xiang out of this predicament. Right now, they had no one to rely on but themselves.

At this moment, Chen Xiang’s entire body was powerless as he let out a helpless sigh.

Leng Youlan picked him up and giggled, “big brother, I didn’t image I would pick you up like this!"

“Youlan, you go first. I will erase all traces of us here!” Xue Xianxian was extremely cautious. She walked behind Leng Youlan and used some special methods to eliminate off their smell and footprints.

After that was the opening of the cave. The two girls used their Demon Subduing Force and their thick True Qi to quickly create a cave. At this moment, Chen Xiang was groaning in pain and his body was surrounded by a layer of electricity.

Xue Xianxian kissed Chen Xiang’s lips, her eyes full of worry. She softly said, “dear Xiang, you must hold on!"

After Leng Youlan carried Chen Xiang into the cave, Xue Xianxian cleaned up all the traces left behind by them. Then, she set up an illusory magic array at the cave entrance to conceal the entrance and the sound inside.
