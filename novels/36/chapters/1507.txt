After Chen Xiang finished taking care of the remnants of the Magical corruption gas, he and Little Lizhi quickly left the place. Regarding the matters of the Magical corruption gas, Chen Xiang had always been cautious, otherwise he would be in even more trouble in the future.

They arrived at a large mountain, found a naturally formed cave, and entered it to reform it. Only then did they feel at ease and begin to heal their injuries.

"How did you get your Magical corruption gas? This poison is not easy to deal with, you seem to have a lot." Lv Qilian asked. She was also an expert in the use of poisons, but she rarely used them because she was strong enough.

"I did it when I was in Di Tian. That place has something to do with your dad." Chen Xiang said. The place where he had obtained the Magical corruption gas was the place where the Devil-suppressing Heavenly Venerable had suppressed the Poisonous Beast Devil God.

"Looks like you still have some secrets on you ..." If I am not wrong about your armor, it should be one of the Four Symbols Divine Weapons’s profoundwu diamond armour. " Chen Xiang said, his heart filled with jealousy. Chen Xiang himself already had the divine blade called the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword, and now he also had the divine armor. He had both offense and defense, so he would definitely be a strong figure in the future.

Little Lizhi said: "I heard that Liu Meng’er has Suzaku Divine Weapon with him. Right now, there is still one more White Tiger Divine Weapon that has yet to leave."

The White Tiger Divine Weapon was very special, but it was already in Chen Xiang’s hands.

"Don’t you guys go around talking nonsense, it’s not good to spread this around." Chen Xiang said, "Especially regarding the Magical corruption gas."

"I know, how could we possibly speak of such nonsense?" Lv Qilian took out a Drunk god flower and muttered: "I really want to give a mother. She was looking everywhere before, Qinlian is also really looking forward to it."

Chen Xiang chuckled: "I’ve already given quite a few to your sister. Not only that Drunk god magical poison, I’ve also given her some of her defenses, but she probably won’t need them."

Hearing Chen Xiang’s words, Lv Qilian immediately looked at him vigilantly. "You probably won’t give it to her for no reason at all. What you did to her, did you do anything to her before?" ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Chen Xiang looked innocent and said unhappily: "I only exchanged a few things with her, she gave me two Holy Lotus Seeds, and we are good friends. I have always called her Big Sister, and we have helped each other many times, don’t tell me I look like that kind of person."

"Hmph. No matter how I look at it, you don’t look like a good person." Lv Qilian did not believe what Chen Xiang was saying. Chen Xiang even dared to scheme against her, what’s more, although Lv Qinlian was not related to her in blood, in her heart, he was her own sister.

Chen Xiang curled his lips, and muttered in a low voice: "If I wasn’t a good person, the two of you would have already been my people."

After saying that, Little Lizhi and Lu Qi immediately glared at him with a faint killing intent.

Chen Xiang immediately laughed dryly, "Little Lizhi, I have already saved you many times, don’t you have any objections?"

Lv Qilian was worried that Little Lizhi would harm him and she quickly replied, "You saved Little Lizhi, and I will help her repay you. You don’t have to worry about that."

"Are you going to give your life for her?" Chen Xiang laughed out loud, but when he saw Lv Qilian’s ice-cold gaze, he restrained himself.

Lv Qilian glared at him: "You better not let me find a chance to beat you up. You bastard, you really deserve a beating."

"How fearsome, no wonder you’ve been single for so many years, Little Lizhi is still the best, and she’s so cute and lovely. Although she’s a bit naughty, I still like her a lot." Chen Xiang came to Little Lizhi’s side and shamelessly said.

"Put the Wild Lion Emperor’s corpse into this thing." Lv Qilian tossed over a big square chest to Chen Xiang. It should be a storage artifact that had a lot of space inside.

Chen Xiang used his divine power to check it out, and said in shock, "There are so many Spiritual crystal, and it’s so big."

"Don’t just take it." Lv Qilian said.

Chen Xiang moved Wild Lion Emperor’s corpse into the big box. The inside of the box was indeed very large, and could fit a hundred Wild Lion Emperor inside without any problem. One must know that the Wild Lion Emperor’s body was as big as a mountain.

"Do you still have this kind of box? Where did you buy it from?" Chen Xiang returned the chest back to Lv Qilian and asked.

"Let your wife refine it. As long as you have the materials, she should be able to refine it." Lv Qilian said.

Chen Xiang said in a low voice: "You’re so stingy, can’t you give me one?"

Lv Qilian said in a tender voice: "You have even more things stored within that divine cauldron of yours, and you still want mine. You’re truly greedy."

The one with the most severe injuries was Chen Xiang, but the one who talked the most was him.

"Sit down and take off your clothes." Lv Qilian could not bear to see him covered in wounds, so he teased them with a mischievous smile.

"What are you doing?" Chen Xiang looked shocked: "You want to help me wash my body?"

"So long-winded." Lv Qilian frowned, she reached out her hand and grabbed Chen Xiang’s shirt, using her strength to pull on it, causing it to disintegrate, revealing Chen Xiang’s upper body.

Chen Xiang shouted in shock, "What are you doing?"

"I’ll help you heal your injuries, stop talking nonsense."

Lv Qilian’s jade-like hand had already pressed on Chen Xiang’s lower abdomen, channeling a warm and comfortable power into Chen Xiang’s body, causing him to let out an extremely silvery egg’s groan.

"Little Lizhi, come closer. I’ll help you heal your injuries too." Lv Qilian smiled at her.

Little Lizhi was right beside Chen Xiang. She approached him, lifted up her clothes, and revealed her slim waist that had a bit of muscle on it.

Lv Qilian pressed his hand on Little Lizhi’s abdomen, channeling a kind of strange energy into Little Lizhi’s body, helping her to recuperate her injuries.

"Mistress, are you not going to heal yourself? If you help us heal our wounds, it will slow down your recovery." Little Lizhi asked softly, looking at Lv Qilian with a concerned gaze. He could tell that their relationship was extremely good, like sisters.

"It’s fine, I’m recovering very quickly right now. Even if I don’t heal, I’ll be able to recover completely in two days or so." After Lv Qilian finished, he glanced at Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang laughed: "This is all because of my kissing you, why don’t we kiss again, maybe you will recover immediately."

Little Lizhi looked at Little Lizhi with a face full of helplessness. Little Lizhi was the same, they were not the kind of people who could casually make jokes, so they could only ignore him.

Three days later, the three of them had completely recovered from their injuries. Lv Qilian used the method in the Alive Slain Method to treat them, and the effects were so great that Chen Xiang was envious of them and wanted to obtain the Alive Slain Method even more.

"We’re going back. What about you? Do you have any plans? You should come back with us." Lv Qilian asked.

Chen Xiang looked at the luminous pearl at the top of the stone room and thought for a while before saying, "I still need to stay here for a period of time. This is the Heaven Realm, it contains a lot of treasures and precious herbs."

"Then you have to be careful." Lv Qilian pinched his face tightly, her voice was filled with gentleness and gentleness.

Little Lizhi winked at him and smiled mischievously: "Don’t die, if you lose a little demon like you in the Nine Heavens, you will become lifeless and lifeless."

"In order to see Little Lizhi and your Mistress, I will definitely live." Chen Xiang laughed. "You guys must be careful on the way back."

Lv Qilian and Little Lizhi had already left. They had already realized the terror of this Heaven Realm.
