Chen Xiang suddenly understood why Yue Yiran had returned to the Heaven Old Super Realm. It was because there were many such abnormal things in there.

"As a Alchemist, if I can’t refine a pill spirit, I won’t even be able to raise my head." Yue Yiran said: "If you meet some of the more vicious Alchemist, they will capture you and feed you to their core spirits. This way, their core spirits will become even stronger, and if they can successfully swallow your soul, then their core spirits will be able to obtain your memories and can refine even more pills."

Yue Yiran’s words moved even Chen Xiang’s heart, even though he did not have enough power to refine it, he wanted to try and see if he could continue refining the Strong strength Dan.

"Boss, then what are the problems you have? Are you about to succeed? " Chen Xiang thought about it and asked.

"Yes, I’m about to succeed. The problem I’m facing right now is that I can’t condense the pill at the last moment!" Yue Yiran sighed and continued, "When you refine pills, you should know that condensing a pill is very crucial. Furthermore, the higher the quality of the pill, the harder it is to condense it during the refining process, because it requires a very strong compression of energy."

Chen Xiang nodded, "Yes!"

"This is exactly the difficulty." Yue Yiran said: "It’s not that my strength is insufficient, but that I have not found a solution! When I was above Myriad Tao, the Alchemist that I met earlier were weaker than me, so they wouldn’t be able to beat me in a fight. But they were able to refine a pill spirit.

There was actually such a thing, a pill spirit could be even stronger than its master.

"Do you want to try the sealing method?" Chen Xiang said: "At the very last moment, he used a very strong sealing power to seal that power, preventing it from exploding out, the only problem is that the power of the seal is very, very strong."

"This is a good idea. Have you used it? Did it work? " Yue Yiran asked, he had not expected this before.

Chen Xiang used it frequently. Before he met Feng Ke’er, he used Six Realms mirrors as support, and it was very successful.

"If I succeed, I will often concoct a pill that surpasses what I am capable of." Chen Xiang said: "And I am using an array disc. I will place the array disc at the bottom of the pill furnace, when necessary, I will control the array disc to open up and release the seal’s power."

After Yue Yiran heard this, he frowned and started to ponder.

"This is a good idea!" Yue Yiran thought as he nodded.

If you are close to success, then the ’medicine’ crystal you need to condense will definitely be very terrifying. The array disc you need will also not be an ordinary array disc. Chen Xiang said: "According to my experience, the sealing power that can be released by controlling the array discs is also very crucial."

"Alright, I can give it a try!" Yue Yiran said: "Right now, I’m finally seeing the light. Before, I didn’t even know what to do, I’ve already failed many times."

Yue Yiran was actually close to success, which made Chen Xiang feel that he was very powerful. If he really succeeded, Yue Yiran might be able to share some of his experience with him, which was also very important to him.

"Boss, are you going to start trying now?" Chen Xiang asked: "What pill did you refine?"

"It’s an Intermediate Level Primordial Pill!" Yue Yiran laughed. He and Chen Xiang had chatted for so long, the two of them had already become very familiar with each other.

"If it really succeeds, can I take a look when the time comes?" Chen Xiang said.

"Of course not." Yue Yiran said: "I will bring you to participate in the Heavenly Pill Assembly later on, and I will get a friend of mine to help me create an array disc, this type of array disc must be good, and the ingredients must use the Myriad Tao Divine Soil."

The array discs used by the Myriad Tao Divine Soil were not bad! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

"Heavenly Pill Assembly?" Chen Xiang didn’t really understand this.

"It’s a Alchemist Great Assembly. You should know the meaning of this Great Assembly." Yue Yiran said.

"Yeah, there’s usually some competition or something." Chen Xiang had participated in it many times.

"At that time, you can represent our store and not allow you to get first place. As long as you can get first place, then that’s fine, because there will be a lot of geniuses participating. If you want to fight for first place, then there will be a lot of pressure." Yue Yiran patted Chen Xiang’s shoulder, and then handed over two jade boxes to him. "These are two commonly used types of arrogant pills, both of them are medicinal ingredients, take them back and try to see if they can be refined yourself. If you encounter any difficulties, then come and find me."

"One of them is Beginner’s and the other one is Intermediate."

Chen Xiang immediately thanked her after she received it.

After Chen Xiang obtained these ingredients, he returned to his hut in great excitement. He never thought that the owner of the shop would actually be such a good person.

"Chen Xiang, if you can refine a pill spirit, wouldn’t that mean that you’re the same as me?" Feng Ke’er laughed.

Feng Ke’er was a spirit that was sealed and nurtured, so when Chen Xiang refined a pill spirit, it was the same as hers.

"Let’s wait until I refine it first." Chen Xiang said.

"I have a suggestion that might be able to be refined by you right now." Feng Ke’er said.

Feng Ke’er had always been helping Chen Xiang with the concocting of pills during this long period of time. But as an extremely competent child in the field of alchemy, he had given Chen Xiang a great help and lightened many of Chen Xiang’s burdens.

"Tell me about it." Chen Xiang said.

"You can start refining the Strong strength Dan now and just keep using the derivation method. Don’t use the Crash method." Feng Ke’er said: "The Crash method is not easy to control, you should be clear about this."

"That’s a good idea." Chen Xiang was currently thinking, he really wanted to refine a pill spirit quickly, this could increase his strength.

"After you give birth to the ’medicine’ crystal, I’ll help you fuse it. My sealing power is very strong." Feng Ke’er laughed: "I have cultivated a World Defying mad source bead now, I can use the World Defying Stage Fierce Power."

"Yes, I can try." Chen Xiang looked at the two jade boxes, he needed to concoct the same pill now, but after thinking about it, he decided to try the method Feng Ke’er suggested.

The sealing power of Feng Ke’er was very strong, so he was quite confident in her.

"If I can’t do it by then, you just have to find a way to provide me with World Defying Stage Fierce Power. When I release the sealing power, it will consume a lot of energy. Feng Ke’er said again. Seeing that Chen Xiang was moved, she secretly looked forward to it in her heart.
