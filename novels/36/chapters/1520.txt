The strength of this Super Old Sacred City had allowed Chen Xiang to have a deeper understanding of the Saint Realm.

"It’s been a long time since I’ve seen him, the change isn’t too great." Ji Ling’er brought Chen Xiang along as they walked along the busy street, buying a lot of snacks to eat. Although there were a lot of strong warriors, there were still a lot of weak ones.

Ji Ling’er was very familiar with this place. Along the way, she had passed by many shops that she was very familiar with, and they were all food sellers. Those things were all not ordinary, and required Holy stone s to buy them.

"Hurry up and tell me what you need to do to quickly increase your strength." Chen Xiang didn’t have the time to stroll around here with her.

"Let’s have fun again. I’ve been in charge of supervising the mine for almost a hundred years, so of course I’ll enjoy myself now." Ji Ling’er had two million kilograms of Holy stone, so she could buy some things that she previously couldn’t.

Chen Xiang took this opportunity to take advantage of her, using the reason of helping his wife buy things as a reason to get her to help buy more than ten sets of clothes that weren’t bad for women. Those were for Su Meiyao and, as well as some jewelry and such.

In order to curry favor with Chen Xiang, Ji Ling’er was extremely generous. As long as she met someone Chen Xiang liked, she would pay.

"Little Ling’er, do you have any pills to sell here?" Chen Xiang asked. He had followed Ji Ling’er around for the majority of the day, but he had never seen a shop that sold medicinal pellets.

Of course I do, but I can’t help you buy it. It’s rather expensive, and the reason why I brought you here is because there are a lot of medicinal pills for sale. If you use the one million catties of Holy stone here, you should be able to break through quickly. Ji Ling’er muttered: "My Holy stone also wants to buy pills for myself, I also need to increase my strength."

"Then why didn’t I see those pill shops?" Chen Xiang looked around. It was just like a normal market.

"The Super Old Sacred City is divided into many districts, and right now, this district specializes in the sale of clothes, and then there is the Sacred Transformation Sector, where people from the Immortal-becoming realm are mainly gathered. The medicinal ingredients and weapons sold there are also specially provided for people of this rank, and there is also the Heaven Sacred District, where people with my strength go to."

Ji Ling’er smelled a bunch of fresh flowers that she had just bought, and smelled that flower’s fragrance. She closed her eyes and enjoyed that beauty, and then passed it in front of Chen Xiang, letting him feel the strange fragrance of that bunch of flowers.

Chen Xiang pushed the bouquet of flowers away and asked: "I don’t have the power of the Immortal-becoming realm yet, where should I go?"

"There is no special area here for you. Hehe, because it’s not good enough." Even though Ji Ling’er said this, she did not have the slightest intention of ridiculing him. In her eyes, Chen Xiang was still rather powerful: "Go to the area of the Immortal-becoming realm, there are immortal pills for sale there, it’s useful for you."

The sky in the Sky Region was so vast, Chen Xiang reckoned that it should be as big as the Heaven Realm, and it was even better developed than the Nine Heaven World.

Holy stone could be directly used to absorb the Holy Spirit Qi inside, but if there was a high level immortal pill working together, that would be for the best. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

"Even if I eat immortal pills, my cultivation speed will be the same. I won’t be that fast." Although Chen Xiang had not stepped into the Immortal-becoming realm, he still understood it well.

"You should still be in the Immortal King Stage right? Let’s talk about this after you enter the Immortal King Stage Late Phase."

Ji Ling’er brought Chen Xiang into the Sacred Transformation Sector. Upon arriving, Chen Xiang immediately discovered that this place was very different from the previously chaotic regions. There were less people here, but all of them belonged to the Immortal-becoming realm.

Chen Xiang secretly sighed with emotion. Nine Heaven World must have been very strong back then, and the number of people in the Immortal-becoming realm should have been no less.

"Are you familiar with this place?" After Chen Xiang entered the Sacred Transformation Sector, he had a very special purpose.

"Of course I’m familiar with it. This was where I passed the time when I was using the Immortal-becoming realm."

Ji Ling’er had indeed stayed here before, and had even left behind a good mansion.

"Are you not afraid of Ji Clan finding out if you live here?" Chen Xiang anxiously pulled Ji Ling’er back.

"What’s there to be afraid of? Back then, when I was in trouble, I was always hiding here." Ji Ling’er shook off Chen Xiang’s hand, took out a jade tablet and opened the door to the residence. After pulling Chen Xiang in, he opened up some formation enchantments.

Ji Ling’er stood in the courtyard and laughed: "This place is not bad right? Back then, I spent a lot of effort to get this place."

Although the yard had been left unattended for many years and had grown some weeds, it still looked pretty good. There were some strange bamboo and the houses were also elegantly built.

Ji Ling’er and Chen Xiang spent less than an hour to finish up the house. At this time, Chen Xiang really wanted to go over to the pill shops to take a look, he was the best at concocting pills, he wanted to see what the Alchemist here looked like.

"Little Ling’er, are you not going to the Heaven Sacred District?" Chen Xiang did not want to be with Ji Ling’er right now. He wanted to go out and walk around by himself.

"No, I only see Grade Eight and above elixirs, but even in Heaven Sacred District s there are very few. I might as well use the Holy stone to cultivate, so I will stay here to accompany you in your cultivation and protect you." Ji Ling’er played with his hair, and laughed: "You want to get rid of me?"

"Of course not, I just want to take a walk by myself." Chen Xiang shook his head.

"If you go out and do bad things by yourself, then I want to be with you even more. Doing bad things in Super Old Sacred City and getting caught is very troublesome." Ji Ling’er revealed a sly smile. Seems like she had already done a lot of bad things here.

Ever since he saw that Ji Ling’er wanted to keep the three million kilogram Holy stone for himself, Chen Xiang knew that she wasn’t a good bird.

"Okay, I’ll take you, but you have to listen to me." Chen Xiang said with an commanding tone.

"Yes, Ling’er." Ji Ling’er laughed mischievously.

Chen Xiang walked to the door and immediately opened it. After walking out of the house, she obediently followed beside Chen Xiang, making him feel that she was an outstanding female slave.

"Little Ling’er, is there any Alchemist here that can refine a Holy Pellet?" Chen Xiang felt that the Sky Region’s refining level should be higher than the Nine Heaven World’s.

"Of course there are. However, there are only a few of them and it’s very difficult to find them. You have to eat the Holy Elixir." Ji Ling’er asked.

"Of course not, I’m not afraid to tell you, I am also a Alchemist." Chen Xiang smiled and said: "If possible, I’m more inclined to eat by myself."

"Really?" Ji Ling’er had a face full of disbelief, as he looked at Chen Xiang from head to toe, as if looking at him in a new light.

Chen Xiang laughed: "Whether you believe it or not is up to you."
