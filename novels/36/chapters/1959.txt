The elderly people in Supreme Hall often saw Chen Xiang and Feng Yujie together. He originally thought that Chen Xiang and Feng Yujie was a pair, but now, Chen Xiang had actually brought a woman back.

Shui Bingyan smiled at the old man, seeing her innocent and sweet appearance, the old man secretly cursed Chen Xiang in his heart, to actually trick such an innocent girl.

"You didn’t go looking for that stone." Although the old man looked a little disappointed on the surface, he was still very happy in his heart. If Chen Xiang went to that place, even if he came back and let Luo Tianjun know about this, he would definitely be scolded.

Chen Xiang laughed: "Of course I went, I’m back now. Clan Elder, are you able to help me get her inside?"

The old man did not expect Chen Xiang to return so quickly and safe, and even brought a beauty back with him. He said in a low voice, "You must not tell Old Camel that I told you to go there. If you promise to help me, I will help you get her in."

"Alright, it’s a deal." Chen Xiang immediately nodded in agreement.

The old man brought Chen Xiang, who was the best, into the door. The old man made an identity plate for Shui Bingyan, which was a disciple of Dan Hall, with the tenth hall written on it.

Just as Chen Xiang had guessed, this old man held a lot of power in the Supreme Divine Palace.

Upon entering the gate, Shui Bingyan saw the majestic buildings inside the Supreme Divine Palace, and couldn’t help but to widely open his eyes and look around.

Chen Xiang held her small hand, worried that she would run around in too much excitement, or randomly release his frightening power of the laws of ice and water.

Shui Bingyan was a god, even if she was stunned, if he angered her, she would kill him in the blink of an eye.

Back then, Chen Xiang had told her to conceal the strong power of the Ancient Code in her body and not expose it. Shui Bingyan had done well now, even the old man had not discovered it.

"Elder, is the stone you’re talking about this type of stone?" Chen Xiang took out an original bead. This was the Dao heart stone.

The old man who was walking in front was stunned at first, but when he turned his head, Chen Xiang had already thrown the Dao heart stone over.

The old man recognised the Dao heart stone, and he had not explained the use of the Dao heart stone to Chen Xiang previously because he was afraid that Chen Xiang would use it carelessly after finding it.

"This ..." The old man came back to reality and hastily kept the Dao heart stone s. He increased his pace and led Chen Xiang to turn left and right before entering a large manor.

"This is my residence. I’ll go call that person over." The old man ran off in a hurry as Chen Xiang sat in the hall with his legs crossed.

Shui Bingyan and Yue’er, on the other hand, were playing in a garden outside the hall. Seeing that there were so many beautiful flowers inside, Shui Bingyan was extremely excited, jumping around like a cheerful bunny. Smelling the fragrance released by the flowers, she started to chase after them like a child when she saw the beautiful butterflies flying towards them.

"It’s great to be satisfied so easily." lamented. Back then, when he was young, he was also easily satisfied.

Soon enough, the elder walked in with a burly old man wearing a purple robe.

"Chen Xiang." The moment the old man came in, he started to size Chen Xiang up, then patted Chen Xiang’s shoulders and laughed loudly: "Good kid, you’re not bad. I heard from Xiao Chou that you’re even his master."

This old man was one of the Supreme Gods of the Giant God Clan, the commander of the entire Soul Hall. He was an elder with a high position and power in the Supreme Divine Palace, his name was Zhu Xiangyuan.

"Junior will be forever grateful to senior for taking so much care of Xiao Chou." Chen Xiang also said with a smile.

"I originally thought that no one had completed my mission for many years, and I was just trying it out myself. I didn’t think that someone would deliver the item I was looking for so quickly, and a little kid at that, haha ..." Zhu Xiangyuan laughed brazenly: "This is a ten million Shen Yuan stone for you. I’ll give you that good divine soul in a few days."

Chen Xiang received a Storage bag. Ten million Shen Yuan stone was received just like that, which was relatively easier for him.

"Senior, I think it’s best not to spread this matter." Chen Xiang really wanted to keep a low profile.

"I understand. When I’m free, I often come to the First Soul Hall, and Xiao Chou is really a little brat. He has been back for so long, yet he didn’t bring you, his master, to visit the Soul Hall." Zhu Xiangyuan happily left the old man’s courtyard.

After the old man saw him leave, he then said: "Brat, if you knew what that was, you wouldn’t have given it to him so casually. Honestly speaking, his ten million Shen Yuan stone s and divine soul combined are not even as good as that little stone’s.

Chen Xiang smiled and said, "Of course I know. That’s called Dao heart stone, right?"

The old man was shocked, Chen Xiang actually knew about this.

"Elder, this is for you ... ... The Shen Yuan stone that I owe you, just write them off. These past few days, I have been very grateful to you for taking care of me and my senior sister. " Chen Xiang gave a Dao heart stone to the old man, he had a hundred or so of them, and gave one to the old man. In the future, when he meets with danger in the Supreme Divine Palace, the old man would not sit idly by and do nothing.

The old man stared blankly for a moment before taking a deep breath. "It seems like you have not only found one."

He accepted the Dao heart stone because to him, this Dao heart stone was a very rare treasure that could strengthen his strength. Forget about Chen Xiang owing him 4 million Shen Yuan stone s, even if it was owing him 40 million, he would still not accept it.

"Hehe, then I’ll accept it. Come and find me if you need anything in the future." The old man was overjoyed. He had originally wanted to express his gratitude, but he felt that Chen Xiang should not be lacking anything now. The reason Chen Xiang did this was to build a good relationship with him.

Chen Xiang walked out of the hall, and brought Yue’er and Shui Bingyan back to his tenth hall.

Yue’er would also tell Shui Bingyan about many of the rules of the human world. Shui Bingyan remembered all of those things in his heart, because she didn’t plan to return to the boring and tedious ocean.

Chen Xiang left for a month, and upon his return, he actually brought back a woman.

Three Gu Brothers frowned. Chen Xiang had actually brought the woman back so blatantly, they felt that Chen Xiang should have taken Feng Yujie’s feelings into consideration.

"Kid, which hall is she from?" oldest Gu asked.

"She’s from our Tenth Dan Hall, but she doesn’t know how to refine pills. You have to keep this a secret." Chen Xiang said in a low voice: "I let her join our hall to give us some face, right?"

Three Gu Brothers nodded.

Second Brother Gu said: "Indeed, our tenth hall has two great beauties. The other Dan Hall must not be jealous to death, haha ... ..." ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Gu Lao San asked, "Where does she live? Don’t tell me she lives in the same room as you?"

Shui Bingyan was obviously a little shy as he sat there quietly, stroking the smooth fur on Yue’er’s body while listening to their conversation with a sweet smile.
