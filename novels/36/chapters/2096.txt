Dongfang Xinyue put down the work at hand and walked over to Chen Xiang’s side. He picked up the drink Chen Xiang had made and drank a little, then said: "Aren’t you very strong now?

"But the ones sent out by the Hell Devil Emperor might be from there." Chen Xiang said: "If it’s really Divine Nations, with our little strength, we will definitely lose." L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Liu Meng’er said, "There are of course array formations that can reverse time, but the current Nine Heaven World’s space is different from before. In the past, when Nine Heaven World was still very weak, the Time Formation he used was a very high level one, so it could easily reverse time. But now it’s different."

Time and space were intertwined to a certain extent, and Chen Xiang was fairly clear about this.

"How much energy will I need to gain more time?" Chen Xiang asked: "Is this dragon vein not enough?"

"The formation has been in operation for twenty days, which will allow you to obtain at least two hundred days. However, the consumption of energy from the dragon fountain is very great. If you want to obtain twenty years, I reckon ten days will be enough time for the dragon fountain to enter a very weak state." Xue Xianxian said as he took out an array disc, and saw that it was square.

Liu Meng’er, Dongfang Jing and Dongfang Xinyue also took out a square formation plate.

"This was originally created by us, and can be overlapped four times. If we use one alone, it will be a month. If we keep one in, it will be a month. If we add one in, it will be a year." Xue Xianxian gave the square formation plate to Chen Xiang.

Liu Meng’er and the others handed it over as well. Chen Xiang hurriedly took the four array discs and said, "If I were to stack them all together and use them, then two hundred years of time would have only passed twenty years for me inside."

"Yes, but you need to find a place with sufficient energy to use it. We refined this array disc based on the records of the Heavenly Divine Lord’s Nine Heavens Treasured Artifact, and it can absorb energy to maintain the array formation." Liu Meng’er said: "I can’t use it on the dragon’s vein. It will drain the energy in the dragon’s vein."

Chen Xiang thought for a while, then said: "Seems like we can only go to the old place. Oh right, how many people can enter at once?"

"It’s best if it’s just one. With one more living being inside, the amount of energy required will increase by several times." Liu Meng’er sighed lightly, "If it was in that kind of lower level world in the past, then Time Formation would be everywhere and the amount of energy needed would not be much. At that time, many powers would use the Time Formation to grow medicinal herbs."

It was indeed different now. Space was strong on one side, but changing time was also very difficult. It required a very large amount of energy to do so.

"What’s the old place you were talking about? Is it dangerous?" Xue Xianxian asked.

"The earth’s core, that place isn’t dangerous for me." Chen Xiang laughed: "Don’t worry, it’s very safe there."

Dongfang Jing said: "Brother, now that the Nine Heaven World is growing stronger, the core of the earth is becoming stronger and stronger. It’s not like in the past, you have to be careful."

"Got it." Chen Xiang caressed it and said: "I will go look for Yu Jie and get some divine medicine from her."

"There’s a pill furnace here, you can keep it for now." Dongfang Xinyue passed a very small pill furnace to Chen Xiang. "After recognizing the master, you can enlarge it."

Chen Xiang accepted the pill furnace, and after bidding farewell to the girls, he went to find Feng Yujie.

Feng Yujie was not concocting pills at the moment, but he had found Lv Qinlian in the Hundreds of Flowers Village and asked her to send a message to him on an urgent matter.

Feng Yujie hurried back after learning that Chen Xiang had important matters to discuss with her.

"I was planning to go to Heavenly Divine Palace to have a look. There’s something important I need to do." When Feng Yujie saw Chen Xiang’s smiling face, she scoffed.

"I really have something urgent to do. Give me some Bone level Dan’s medicinal herbs, I want a hundred sets like this." Chen Xiang said, he wanted to stay in the Time Formation for a while, at that time he would try to condense Bones.

"I have it here. It was originally meant for Great Divine Lord and the rest to refine, but if you need it, I’ll give it to you." Feng Yujie passed Chen Xiang a Storage bag: "What are you planning to do with it?"

"I need to go into closed-door training for a period of time. At that time, I plan to try condensing another Bones." Chen Xiang said: "Of course, what I need more is a pill that can condense Divine Deity after consuming it."

"If you don’t have this kind of pill formula, you can think of creating one. At that time, it will definitely be very easy to sell." Feng Yujie laughed: "If that was the case, I wouldn’t have to work so hard to condense my Divine Deity throughout the day."

Chen Xiang laughed heartily, "There will be one sooner or later. He took the opportunity when Feng Yujie wasn’t paying attention to kiss her on the lips, then flew out of the room.

"I wonder if the You Ming Deep Abyss is still here." When Chen Xiang arrived at the City Lord’s Mansion, Wu Kaiming was also there. He asked Wu Kaiming to show him how to get to the You Ming Deep Abyss.

Wu Kaiming took out a guide for him, inside it were many cities and dangerous places.

"That You Ming Deep Abyss is very scary now. That place is very dangerous, you have to be careful." Wu Kaiming said.

Chen Xiang nodded and then was teleported to the city closest to You Ming Deep Abyss. After walking out of the city, he used the Space wind and quickly arrived beside the You Ming Deep Abyss.

"It has indeed become very frightening." Chen Xiang never thought that the You Ming Deep Abyss would actually turn into a steaming abyss, and that he could even see the scene below it.

"The same place. I’m here." Chen Xiang jumped down and immediately felt the scorching heat coming from below. When he reached the bottom, he was already somewhat unable to endure it, so he had no choice but to use the Ice and Snow Constellation to resist the heat.

Arriving at the bottom, he found it strange that the stones below had evolved to withstand such a high temperature.

"The core’s heat has been leaked. It must have come from that tunnel." When Chen Xiang took out the Fire Dragon Sword, all the heat in the place disappeared, causing him to be secretly pleasantly surprised. Although the Fire Dragon Sword was not at the Divine Artifact level, it had this kind of ability, allowing him to walk around in the earth’s core with ease.

"This is the passage." Chen Xiang saw that the hole on the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword had been destroyed and it could no longer be opened. But that was fine, because he could use spatial travel to go through the door.

He teleported to the passage. The passage was covered in a fiery red mist and was filled with a strange fire energy. It was so dense that tiny particles could be formed and floated inside the passage, causing the passage to be covered in red.

"In a place like the Core, there’s no doubt that it can give birth to living creatures, or even powerful beasts." He had been to the earth’s core a few times, so he was well aware of how terrifying the energy of the earth’s core was. This was the energy source that maintained the flow of the entire Nine Heaven World.
