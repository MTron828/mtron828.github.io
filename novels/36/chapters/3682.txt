Chen Xiang got a few array discs from the patriarchs, which could help him open the gate to Thunder City. After he opened the gate, he asked Xia Changdong to arrange arrangements for him to bring the people inside.

There were also Chen Xiang’s friends in the Thunder City, Yang Genming was inside!

After Jing Yun’er entered, as long as she found out that the Creation Race s’ strengths were all in the World Defying Stage Legendary Rank s, they would all be killed by her. Even the people from the Seven Great Sects were not spared.

Chen Xiang and Jing Yun’er had already taken over the City of Thunder, they found a large formation plate inside the City Lord’s Mansion, this formation plate was very ancient, and had existed for a long time.

"This is the Transmission array Plate that leads to the Most Ancient Era. However, there is a certain limit, and only people with the Creation Race bloodline can pass through." After Xiao Xianglin came out, he quickly saw what kind of array disc this was.

Other than that, they also found a pearl at the top of a tall tower in City Lord’s Mansion. They guessed that this pearl was the reason why the beasts could not attack this place.

Just as Chen Xiang and the others were surrounding the Transmission array plate to study it, the array disc suddenly shook.

"Someone’s coming!" Xiao Xianglin anxiously shouted.

"Don’t be afraid, I’m here!" Jing Yun’er was overjoyed to know that someone had come.

After the formation plate lit up, an old man appeared.

The old man’s gaze was like a wolf’s, his face dark, and his body releasing waves after waves of terrifying Legendary gas. He was a peak World Defying Stage Legendary Rank, and seemed to be much stronger than Young Master Fang.

"How did Fang Tian Qiang die?" I am his master! " The moment the old man arrived, he coldly asked. He even released an extremely strong pressure, wanting to intimidate the people around him.

Fang Tianqiang was that Young Master Fang. His master had thought that the people here were all Fang Tianqiang’s subordinates.

"He died like this!" Jing Yun’er quickly dodged the Heavenly magic sword in Chen Xiang’s hands, and stabbed his sword into the old man’s chest: "Old Turtle, are you satisfied with my answer? "Haha ..."

The old man really did not expect that, at first, he thought that the people around him were just there to welcome him, that they were all people’s subordinates of Fang Tian Qiang. He thought that the patriarchs of the Creation Race would not die, but now, it seemed that they were all dead.

"You ... "You!" The old man looked at Jing Yun’er who was covered in evil Qi, he was in pain but at the same time, he was also shocked: "Killing the Evil beast!"

"Old Turtle, you’re still alive!" After Jing Yun’er pulled out the sword, he pierced it fiercely a few times, "Don’t worry, when I get to the Most Ancient Era, I will kill all of you bastards and make you abandon me and throw me away, I will definitely make you die a horrible death."

"It’s you... Jing Yun’er! " The old man had been stabbed a few times, but he still hadn’t fallen. At this moment, the shock in his heart was greater than the pain. Because he was very clear what kind of existence Jing Yun’er was.

"Old Turtle, you know about me? Hurry up and tell me what’s going on! " Jing Yun’er really wanted to stab her a few more times, but he stopped.

In the end, the old man still died. He was burned by the Chuangyuan key’s power and released layers of black Qi.

Bai Youyou suddenly came out from the You Yao Mountain Villa, and quickly absorbed some of the remnant soul’s memories within the dissipating black aura.

"Sister You You, did you get anything?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Yes, but not much!" Bai Youyou said.

"Hurry up and tell me!" Jing Yun’er came to Bai Youyou’s side like a little girl and shook his arm.

"I just learned from that old man’s memories that you are the daughter of the Tao-creation Evil Ancestor!" Bai Youyou’s words had both Chen Xiang and Jing Yun’er extremely shocked.

"How is this possible?" Jing Yun’er shouted in shock: "I had met Tao-creation Evil Ancestor before, but he did not recognize me."

"I don’t know. There must be some secret." Bai Youyou shook his head: "I can only go to the Most Ancient Era to find out!" Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

"If I am the daughter of Tao-creation Evil Ancestor, then I am also a member of Creation Race. Jing Yun’er pointed to the Transmission array plate and looked at Xiao Xianglin. She knew Xiao Xianglin was extremely familiar with these.

"Big sister Yun, that place must be Thunder-creation Sacred Race’s territory, it will be very dangerous for you to go there." Xiao Xianglin advised.

"Don’t worry, I’ll be fine." Jing Yun’er laughed: "I can’t beat them, I can run! As you can see, the old man who just came was extremely powerful, but wasn’t he still killed by me? "

"Big Sister Yun, how about I lend you this sword for now!" Chen Xiang looked at the Heavenly magic sword and said.

"I don’t need it. This Old Evil used his life in exchange for yours. You must take good care of it." Jing Yun’er said: "Alright, hurry up and teleport me over. I will definitely give you guys more Tao-creation Holy Crystals in the future."

Both Xiao Xianglin and Chen Xiang had no choice but to agree, or Jing Yun’er would definitely continue to pester him.

This Transmission array Plate already had an energy source inside, so Xiao Xianglin could quickly activate it and teleport Jing Yun’er over.

After passing through, he didn’t know what happened to the formation plate but it suddenly cracked open.

"This is troublesome. Big Sis Yun won’t be able to come back, right?" Chen Xiang frowned.

"She never thought of coming back! In my opinion, she must have destroyed the Transmission array plate over there after she came over, which is why it broke. " Xiao Xianglin said: "We also need to hurry to Most Ancient Era."

Xiao Xianglin had already finished refining the array disc and even transferred the refining method of the Transmission array plate to Xue Xianxian and the others once. The refining speed was a little slow on their side, so they needed to wait a while.

After the Transmission array plate was destroyed, it was no longer possible for the people of the Most Ancient Era to come over. Chen Xiang guessed that the array disc was initially in the hands of the Thunder-creation Race.

In this way, this Thunder City was extremely safe.

The Thunder City had been taken over by Yang Genming and he had let many people in. In order to accommodate more people, he built many tall buildings here.

Two months later, Xiao Xianglin excitedly told Chen Xiang that Xue Xianxian and the others had finished refining the Transmission array plate.

"They don’t have any energy sources on their side, so when the time comes they’ll consume all of our energy. I wonder just how much energy they’ll need to transfer to us." Xiao Xianglin said: "We have over a hundred Tao-creation’s Divine Beads in our hands, I’m not sure if it’s enough."

"Try it!" We already have a lot of Tao-creation God Orbs at our disposal, if they still aren’t enough, then there’s nothing we can do about it. " Chen Xiang sighed, "Let’s start the teleportation now."

"Alright!" Xiao Xianglin nodded, then stood with Chen Xiang on the Transmission array Plate, opened by him.

After Xiao Xianglin activated the array disc, it shook a little and released a white light. Then, they sucked a burst of fragrance.

This fragrance was familiar to Chen Xiang, it belonged to Xue Xianxian and the others!

"It’s a success!" Xue Xianxian laughed.

Xiao Xianglin was also relieved. She smiled at Liu Meng’er and the others, she had finally seen these women with her own eyes.
