This woman is very insidious, she actually wants to get close to Xianxian and the others. If Xianxian and You Lan were to land in her hands, it would be troublesome. Chen Xiang’s heart was filled with anger, he had to go and talk with Ji Meixian, or take Ji Meixian down, or else with Ji Meixian being such a powerful woman, he would lose out sooner or later.

"Luckily your wife and sister were smart. Not only were they not successful, they even took away her one hundred billion Spar! Ahhh, isn’t it way too easy for them to earn Spar s? Zhu Rong’s face was filled with jealousy. They had been running around the forest for months just for the Spar s.

"You want the Spar? "Why didn’t you say so earlier? If you follow me, I can let you guys make a huge profit." Wu Qianqian’s eyes turned as he smiled.

"Big Sister, is what you said true? We do not need too many, just enough to allow us to return to the Super Martial School comfortably. The last time we came, we almost died in there. " Yun Xiaodao thought back to the past, his face filled with bitterness.

Yun Xiaodao, Zhu Rong and the others had already returned all the Spar back to Chen Xiang, while Chen Xiang kept them all with a grin.

"I need some demonic beasts and elixirs to concoct my pill. You guys have to help me get them. In just a year or two, you guys will be able to collect the transportation fees." Wu Qianqian calculated and said.

Since Wu Qianqian was able to see her as his successor, naturally she was good. Now, Chen Xiang did not know how much her alchemy skills improved, but seeing how confident she was in bringing Yun Xiaodao and the others to earn a lot of money, he knew that she was not bad.

"So you’re saying that you will be staying in the Pill City for a period of time?" Chen Xiang asked. He suddenly had something he needed to do and could not enter the city together with Yun Xiaodao and the others.

"Yes, of course we have to do it in Pill City." Wu Qianqian replied with a question: "Do you have something important to do?"

Chen Xiang nodded his head: "You guys enter the city, I will look for you guys when I have something good to do."

Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan were not in Pill City, he was in no hurry to go there. After parting with Zhu Rong and the others, he ran towards the aura he sensed.

On top of a tall mountain, Ji Meixian stood atop a huge boulder, looked at the sea of clouds, and felt a natural change in expression. The white mist floated past her body, and her snow-white dress fluttered in the wind, her soft black hair danced in the wind, as though her entire body had merged with nature.

Chen Xiang was standing behind her right now. He did not enter the city with Yun Xiaodao and the others because he wanted to come and see Ji Meixian.

"We need to talk." Ji Meixian said as she turned around, her beautiful eyes looking forward as she spoke lightly.

"We don’t have anything to talk about. Let me warn you, if you still dare to have any ideas about Xianxian or You Lan, even if I have to risk my life, I won’t let you go."

Chen Xiang’s voice was calm, but the intangible fury had turned into killing intent that filled the sky. The dense killing intent set off a strong wind, and all the white clouds around them dispersed, causing waves of black clouds and thunder to appear.

The murderous aura on the peak of the mountain was extremely oppressive. The black clouds churned as a murderous aura shrouded Ji Meixian.

Ji Meixian’s beautiful eyes glistened as her white dress and black hair danced wildly. She shouted softly, her clear and beautiful voice accompanied by the golden light that was emitted from her body flickered, and a holy aura swept in all directions, dispersing the killing intent. The ink cloud on the mountain peak dissipated, and transformed into a golden cloud that shot out bursts of red light, forming a strong holy energy that trapped Chen Xiang.

"You really do cultivate in the Heaven Earth Killing Method. The method I cultivate in is evolved from the Ground killing, but it is not as authentic as the Ground killing! Amongst the Four-phase Magic Kungfu you cultivate, the White Tiger Divine Technique’s Killing heart can allow you to easily control a large amount of killing aura, which is why you are able to learn the Heaven Earth Killing Method. Ji Meixian’s voice was light as she stared at Chen Xiang. She had thought that her words would cause Chen Xiang to be shocked.

But Chen Xiang only replied casually: "You’re right!"

He had long known about Ji Meixian’s identity. She was a Ranker on the side of the Heaven Realm, a Yu Yi Immortal Fairy. Although she was very mysterious in the Heaven Realm, she had chased after Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou all year round, causing Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao to know quite a bit about her background.

So even if she was able to see through some of Chen Xiang’s secrets, Chen Xiang was not surprised.

"They are so strong and cunning, I can’t do anything to them. If you ask your wife to return that 100 billion, I promise I won’t cause trouble for them in the future." Ji Meixian said, that hundred billion was also very important to her. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Chen Xiang said: "This is what you used as a guarantee for them back then, you can’t go back on your words, so it’s impossible for that hundred billion to return to you! Besides, I don’t trust you. Your promise is like farting to me. "

His arm shook, and he summoned the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword out.

"You want to kill me?" Ji Meixian laughed coldly, but she was secretly furious in her heart. Chen Xiang’s strength had increased a lot, so she did not have the confidence to win against him.

"I admit that it’s very difficult to kill you, but it’s very easy to catch you! Only by taking you down can I be at ease with Xianxian and You Lan not being harassed by you. " Chen Xiang felt that it was time to capture Ji Meixian.

Ji Meixian raised his head and laughed, "Are you afraid of me? The other Heavenly Sons are nothing in your eyes, but you are afraid of me! "

Chen Xiang said seriously: "I have never been afraid of you!"

The divine blade shook, the Dragon Power surged, the dragon cry resonated, a green light flashed, forming a crescent moon like arc, striking horizontally towards Ji Meixian.

"I don’t have time to fight with you!" Ji Meixian slapped her palms, shattered the force, and jumped into the sea of clouds.

"Don’t you want your apron back? Aren’t you afraid that the image crystal will be revealed to the public? I’m not afraid of you talking about my Li Renshan, but you’re afraid that I’ll release the Image Crystal, right? " Chen Xiang stood at the peak of the mountain and lightly said.

Just as he finished speaking, Ji Meixian appeared behind him with a face full of frost!

"I don’t want that 100 billion, and I won’t have any plans on dealing with your woman in the future either. This is between you and me, so try not to involve others!" As soon as Ji Meixian finished speaking, Chen Xiang chopped at her.

The torrential Dragon Power shattered all the huge rocks on the mountain peak and all of them tumbled down. The berserk blade Qi cut out and created a gust of wind, blowing away all the white clouds.

Ji Meixian waved her long sleeves, using her immortal robe to block Chen Xiang’s divine blade attack, releasing a ray of white light that struck Chen Xiang’s blade Qi.

"Boom!" The two divine weapons released a force that collided with each other. The mountain peak immediately crumbled as rubble of different sizes tumbled down one after another.

Chen Xiang and Ji Meixian floated in the air, their eyes locked, brimming with killing intent.

"We won’t get any results if we continue fighting. I’m waiting for you here because I want to have a good talk with you!" Ji Meixian was forced to use the Image Crystal to threaten her, causing her to be filled with anger. However, she still had to suppress her anger, because she knew that Chen Xiang was very angry right now.
