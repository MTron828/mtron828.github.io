Chen Xiang never thought that the more he entered, the safer he would be. Even though the surroundings were filled with dense fog, it was very rare to find peace in this place.

"What the hell is going on?" Chen Xiang continued to fly, but he could not see anything, nor could he sense any Qi.

He had originally thought that there would be many Tiangu beast that would fly out to attack him, but now, there wasn’t even a single hair on their body.

"Don’t you have the Message Jade Token? Take it out and see if you can contact Zheng profound and the others. " Feng Ke’er suddenly said.

"Yeah, why didn’t I think of that?"

Chen Xiang took it out and sent a message to them.

After a while, Chen Xiang saw that the communication jade talisman was trembling, and was agitated.

"Chen Xiang, you’re already here? "You entered the Ancient Forbidden Land?" The one who asked was Song Yichen.

"Yes, where are you? I’m surrounded by fog. " Chen Xiang said: "When did you come in?"

Once they entered, it would be very difficult for them to leave, and he had no idea what they were doing here.

"Make some arrangements." Song Yichen said: "After we found enough Myriad Tao Sources, we came in. It’s just that many of the Heaven Old Super Beast King s here are in the process of fusing with the Myriad Tao Origin, and it will take a while for us to succeed. We are also waiting for your arrival."

It was because Chen Xiang had promised them before that he would come here to take a look, which was why they dared to take the risk and enter.

"Now I’ll see if I can get to where you are." Chen Xiang took out the Six Realms mirrors, and thought about Song Yichen’s appearance. Song Yichen then appeared on the mirror and sat on top of a huge tree, on top of a huge tree branch.

was very surprised to see such a huge tree inside. "I’ve already seen you, you should be able to get directly to your position."

Chen Xiang immediately used teleportation and appeared by Song Yichen’s side!

Seeing that Chen Xiang had arrived so quickly, Song Yichen could not help but exclaim: "Chen Xiang, you’re too powerful!"

"That’s right!" Chen Xiang laughed: "What exactly is this place? Is this also in the Ancient Desolation Forbidden Land? "

Chen Xiang admired the beautiful scenery in front of them. He and Song Yichen sat atop a huge tree branch and looked at the beautiful lake in front of them. In the middle of the lake was a small island full of jade-green trees.

"Earlier, you were still lost in the fog. If you had gone through the fog, then you would have been able to enter this ancient forbidden area. This place was sealed long ago, and very few people dared to come here afterwards." Song Yichen said.

"I thought things were very bad here." Chen Xiang laughed: "I never thought that it would be so beautiful, I can cultivate here for a few days."

"Oh right, Chen Xiang, what have you been through outside?" Song Yichen was extremely curious.

"I’ve been through a lot." Chen Xiang sighed: "It’s a long story!"

After that, Chen Xiang slowly told Song Yichen what had happened, shocking him greatly.

"My god, you actually killed a Heaven Old Prince right away!" Song Yichen was very ’agitated’, because today, their entire clan was bestowed upon them by the Heaven Old Imperial Family. They truly hated the Heaven Old Imperial Family to the bones.

Therefore, Chen Xiang vented his anger greatly by getting rid of the prince of Heaven Old Imperial Family.

"Heaven Old Imperial Family is indeed powerful. I am far from being their match right now, so I need to go into closed door cultivation here." Chen Xiang said: "I want to become stronger even faster."

Chen Xiang was oppressed by the Heaven Old Imperial Family, and he was even made an enemy of him.

"Just make a ’hole’ here. When you need it, I will bring you to find the Myriad Tao Divine Soil. There are a lot of them here." Song Yichen chuckled: "Myriad Tao Divine Soil should be very useful to you."

Chen Xiang nodded his head. Myriad Tao Divine Soil was indeed very useful to him.

"Are we going to start closed-door training now?" Song Yichen asked.

"The sooner the better." Chen Xiang walked towards the tree trunk, and after that, he dug a "hole" in the tree as he asked. "Where’s Big Brother Zheng?"

"He went out to play. I’ll help you." Song Yichen also helped Chen Xiang to create a ’hole’ in the tree. The two of them worked together and completed the task very quickly.

Chen Xiang entered the tree cave and ’created’ a few formations so that he would not be disturbed by the outside world. Then, he took out the pill spirit refined by the Huakuan Dan.

"I wonder if I can eat it directly..." Chen Xiang looked at the fist-sized crystal and could not help but laugh: "It’s better not to eat it. Once I produce a pill spirit, I will have a lot of Huakuan Dan, and I don’t need to refine it myself."

Huakuan Dan were still very useful, not to mention allowing people to quickly step into the World Defying crazy realm, after stepping into the World Defying crazy realm, they could also obtain more World Defying Stage Fierce Power s from consuming these pills, and increase their own cultivation.

Chen Xiang started to bleed, and the exquisite crystal was quickly dyed red by his blood, until Chen Xiang’s blood could no longer be poured in, only then did he stop.

"So much blood." Chen Xiang’s face had turned pale. The speed at which this crystal was sucking blood was too fast, he was unable to keep up with the speed at which he was recovering his blood.

"Beautiful, Sijing, how is the Strong strength Dan spirit inside?" Chen Xiang asked.

"The baby inside is about to mature. It seems like it’s about to awaken." Jiang Sijing laughed: "This is a little girl! I had thought that Pill Spirit would be a man! "

"Is it a girl?" "The pill spirit that I saw growing up was a man!" Chen Xiang found it extremely interesting.

"Alright, now I have another pill spirit. I’ll hand it over to you." Chen Xiang placed the Fierce-transformation Dan Spirit inside and ’handed’ it over to the two sisters.

Chen Xiang had only been in the cave for three days, but it had already started to become quiet outside.

"Chen Xiang, something’s wrong, there’s trouble!" Song Yichen who was outside suddenly shouted.

"What trouble?" Chen Xiang immediately ran out. He didn’t even need Song Yichen to reply to him because he knew what kind of trouble had come. Several huge crocodiles had appeared on the lake in front.

"What attracted them here?" Chen Xiang’s heart skipped a beat. He suspected that the aura that the pill spirit had released had attracted these things. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"Are these guys all Tiangu beast s?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Of course, but they weren’t transformed by a human. They were originally found in this area, and are quite powerful." Song Yichen said: "Let’s leave this place!"

Chen Xiang nodded his head. Killing these Tiangu beast s was extremely tiring, and it would be better to go somewhere else.
