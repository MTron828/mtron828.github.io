No matter what, Chen Xiang had to meet the Ao Shi Sheng. The World Defying holy dragon seemed to have met with something inside the lake, and the lake was also very strange, as if it was shrouded in a strong and mysterious energy.

"There’s a barrier!" Feng Ke’er suddenly came out from You Yao Mountain Villa.

Suddenly, a cute little girl with a carved jade face appeared. Song Tianchuan and the others were shocked, but after being surprised, Du Rouke smiled and touched Feng Ke’er’s little face.

"Is this little girl your daughter?" Du Rouke laughed.

"No, my friend!" Chen Xiang pinched Feng Ke’er’s face and said: "Xiao Ke’er, tell me, what kind of barrier is it? Is it formed naturally, or is it man-made? "

Everyone was only curious about Feng Ke’er, but did not ask much. Chen Xiang had a lot of strange things in his hands, it was not strange for a girl to suddenly appear.

Feng Ke’er asked Chen Xiang to control the Six Realms mirrors and let her check the situation around the lake.

This is a formation array formation that was naturally formed, and was later improved and strengthened by others. This itself is a mountain and river array, surrounded by mountains, and a circular lake formed naturally in the middle, which is the best formation base. The mountains that surround the lake, after tens of thousands of years of cultivation, can absorb the power of the World Defying Stage Soul River, and comprehend the dao halo Spirit grain by themselves.

"Perhaps it was later discovered by someone, and after being modified, it became a Spirit Formation that could be controlled by humans. The island in the middle of the lake is the center of the Spirit Formation protection and it is very difficult to approach it." Feng Ke’er said.

Song Tianchuan and the others now understood that this girl was a array master, otherwise, they wouldn’t have discovered this matter.

"If I destroy the mountain, would I be able to break the formation?" The Old Man Qin was more interested in these.

Mountain is very difficult to destroy. This kind of mountain that has been cultivating for tens of thousands of years, the energy it releases is comparable to a Aoshi Holy Stage. Furthermore, there are many other mountains here, and all of them are one. Feng Ke’er said: "Look at the caves they are digging, they are not very deep, and that is because they cannot continue, otherwise they will anger the mountains."

"This Spirit Formation is almost perfect and difficult to break through." Feng Ke’er praised.

Just now, Chen Xiang had caused the Six Realms mirrors to move constantly, but he did not know if it had copied this barrier or not. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"How do I get in?" Chen Xiang thought of his own spatial energy and anxiously used the Sound Transmission Technique, but Feng Ke’er shook his head.

Just as Chen Xiang and the rest were at their wit’s end, the water in the lake suddenly fluctuated, and the eight elders who were seated cross-legged at the entrance of the cave suddenly opened their eyes.

"There’s movement!" Chen Xiang shouted in shock, and everyone held their breath.

"You eight old fellows, sitting here waiting for death, you sure are patient." A voice suddenly came from the center of the island. It sounded like the voice of an old woman.

Soon after, a faint red figure flew out from the clouds in the middle of the island. It was a white-haired, healthy old woman dressed in a fiery red robe.

"This is the World Defying holy dragon!" Chen Xiang was a little surprised. He looked at the dragon scale in his hand, which was currently flickering.

He did not expect that after the World Defying holy dragon took human form, it would actually be an old woman. It could be seen that the World Defying holy dragon itself had a certain age.

"World Defying holy dragon, as long as you don’t die, we will not leave this place." The old man from the World Defying Stage Soul River sneered: "You killed two of our comrades, so you must pay for it with your blood."

"You shameless bunch of old men, it was you who wanted to snatch my Tao-creation’s Holy Crystal first, you’re not allowing me to retaliate, are you? If you steal something and let me kill you, then you deserve it. The World Defying holy dragon bellowed.

"Evil creature like you, the Tao-creation Divine Crystals are at least wasted on you, why don’t you obediently hand them over to us?"

"Being in your hands is a waste. Since the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystals haven’t fallen into your hands, it’s just that you don’t have any interest in trash like things." The World Defying holy dragon became even more so.

After Song Tianchuan and the others heard the conversation, they were shocked speechless. The World Defying holy dragon actually had the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystal, a treasure rarer than the Tao-creation’s Holy stone.

"They are all late stage Aoshi Holy Stage, right?" Chen Xiang said.

"It’s close!" Song Tianchuan said: "Their strength is very strong, and is not something that the leader of Five-tiger from Fierce Saber Race can compare to."

Everyone could see that the elders of the Fierce Saber Race and the Soul River Divine Race were only enraging the World Defying holy dragon, allowing it to rush out of the barrier.

The World Defying holy dragon let out a furious roar and turned into a streak of red light, charging out.

"Damn brat, quickly come in!" The moment the World Defying holy dragon came out, it roared towards Chen Xiang and released eight huge flame dragons, attacking the eight elders, and wrapping them up.

When he was near to the lake, he teleported into the lake. At the same time, the World Defying holy dragon retreated back into the lake and grabbed onto the Six Realms mirrors with one hand. Then, it flew up and floated towards the small island in the middle of the lake.

The fact that the World Defying holy dragon could fly made the eight elders extremely jealous. They were shocked in their hearts, from the tone of the World Defying holy dragon, they could tell that there was someone beside them, but they did not realize it.

The World Defying holy dragon had not made any movements for so many years, and now that it suddenly made a move, it was actually to bring in a person, who exactly was this person?

Chen Xiang’s Six Realms mirrors was brought by the World Defying holy dragon to the small island. Chen Xiang brought Song Tianchuan and the others out from the Six Realms mirrors.

"Where’s Qin Shuang?" The World Defying holy dragon asked.

"With her grandmother." Chen Xiang looked at the small island. On the small island was a small forest, a house, and an empty and flat plaza. The scenery was extremely beautiful.

"Greetings, Senior Holy Dragon." Song Tianchuan and the others were a little nervous and immediately bowed.

World Defying holy dragon trusted Chen Xiang very much, so she didn’t doubt his friends.

"That’s fine too, her grandmother seems to be quite strong, she is someone with a huge burden even in the Ancient Fire Divine Sect." The World Defying holy dragon sighed.

"Senior Sheng Long, I didn’t expect you to be like this after you took human form." Chen Xiang laughed.

"My name is Long Zhiyu, just call me Grandma Long." Long Zhiyu smiled benevolently.

Chen Xiang nodded with a smile, "Grandma Long, I’m so worried about you. I knew that they had sent you to the World Defying Stage Soul River and I know their intentions."

"I never thought that the Ancient Fire Divine Sect would do this for my own good and give me the chance to enter the World Defying Stage Soul River. I never thought that they would actually be this kind of people." Long Zhiyu snorted in anger: "It’s a good thing I’m here, otherwise it would really be a bit dangerous."
