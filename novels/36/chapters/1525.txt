Chen Xiang smiled and nodded: "Let’s try one pellet and see if it is made delicious by those famous masters."

Ji Ling’er immediately took out one pellet and placed it into her mouth. She gently stirred it and swallowed it before praising: "The quality is very high, this is probably the Yuxian Dan with the highest quality that I have eaten. How did you make it?"

"It’s concocted like this, didn’t you see it earlier?" Chen Xiang chuckled: "The progress is much more smooth than I thought."

Now that Ji Ling’er saw him in a new light, she knew that not only was Chen Xiang’s cultivation mysterious, he was also very good at refining pills. She said, "You still have a thousand sets of ingredients left in your possession, that means you can refine five thousand Yuxian Dan s, which is only one thousand kilograms."

"If we buy one thousand more for refinement, we will have ten thousand Yuxian Dan, and we will be able to sell them for one hundred thousand Jin, but the cost is only six thousand Jin. It seems like we will have to earn a cramp."

He knew that Chen Xiang was not ordinary, and their relationship did not develop by much either. Right now, in her eyes, Chen Xiang was just a rooster who knew how to kill Holy stone.

"I will go and buy a large number of Grade Two Immortal Yuling bamboo shoots now. We will have five million kilograms of Holy stone very soon ... Even a hundred million kilograms. " Ji Ling’er was extremely excited and was about to leave the secret room.

Chen Xiang anxiously pulled her along: "Little Ling’er, the reason why I’m refining Yuxian Dan is to increase my strength. Once I become stronger, I can start concocting pills faster and reach a higher level.

"Also, with so many pills, it won’t be easy to get rid of them. You are also being chased by the Ji Clan, so it’s best to keep a low profile right now."

Ji Ling’er took a few deep breaths and calmed herself down. She was truly too agitated before.

"After your strength has increased, you won’t run away right?" Ji Ling’er was a little worried. In her eyes, Chen Xiang was a treasure, not only could he teach her the Changing Technique, he could also use such a brilliant method to quickly earn a large amount of Holy stone.

"When that time comes, of course, I will leave this place. However, before I leave, I will earn a sum of money before leaving. At that time, you will have benefits." Chen Xiang smiled and pinched her cute nose: "You stay by my side, I’m not so bored while concocting pills."

Ji Ling’er laughed. "If you need me, I can accompany you for a lifetime."

Chen Xiang sat down and prepared to continue concocting pills. He also felt that with his pill refining abilities, he could earn a large amount of Holy stone and when the time came, he could buy some medicinal ingredients before returning.

"Ling’er, if I had a lot of Holy stone, would I be able to meet the Pill Saint here?" Chen Xiang asked. There were people here who knew how to refine Holy Pellets, then there would be Pill Saints.

"You want to eat the Holy Elixir?" Ji Ling’er asked: "I’m not too sure either, but if you need to see, you can try."

"No, I have a friend who is injured. He needs a Holy Elixir to cure him." Chen Xiang said.

"Oh, what kind of injury is that?" Ji Ling’er asked curiously: "Even if I’m wounded in the eyes, I probably won’t need a Holy Pellet."

Chen Xiang was also not clear about Su Meiyao’s and Bai Youyou’s injuries. Their abilities were only at the mid to late stage Immortal King, and they did not need any Holy Pellets, but Su Meiyao had never mentioned that kind of injury. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

"I’ll go out, I’ll show her." Su Meiyao suddenly said.

"sister Meiyao, you’re coming out." Chen Xiang was very surprised.

"It’s alright, there are no enemies in this Heaven Realm. My enemies should be in the Nine Heaven World, so there’s no need to be afraid. She’s not bad to you, and she’s very strong, so you don’t need to worry about me." Su Meiyao chuckled: "But she might be scared when she sees me suddenly appear."

"I’ll go out and get some fresh air as well." Bai Youyou also said: "She has passed the Nine Revolutions Saint, maybe she has a way to make us better."

"Fine." Chen Xiang said. Even if he did not agree, Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou could freely go in and out.

Ji Ling’er was waiting for Chen Xiang to answer, but suddenly, two rays of light flashed out. Sensing that there was someone else’s aura, Ji Ling’er immediately became vigilant.

"They’re the ones who got hurt."

As Chen Xiang looked at the two women who had suddenly appeared, and saw Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou’s absolutely beautiful appearance, an unexplainable emotion surged in his heart. He remembered the first time he saw them, and all these things that happened over the years.

Su Meiyao was charming and gentle, her charm was alluring and alluring, wearing a purple dress, it gave her a noble and beautiful temperament.

looked the same as before, but Chen Xiang knew that her heart was different from the geniuses from the past. He could see it from the softness in her eyes.

She admitted that Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou were indeed a rare pair of exceptional beauties. Now, she sort of understood why Chen Xiang could resist her temptation.

"Big Sister Ling’er, can you help look at our injuries?" Su Meiyao smiled sweetly: "This little girl’s name is Su Meiyao, this is my senior sister Bai Youyou, she doesn’t like to talk, please forgive her."

"Hello." Bai Youyou revealed a rare smile as he greeted Ji Ling’er.

Ji Ling’er laughed, "You guys are much more polite than this guy."

Afterwards, she held Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou’s hands and led them to the bedside to let them sit.

"Relax, I’m going to check your bodies." Ji Ling’er placed his hands on top of Bai Youyou’s and Su Meiyao’s abdomen.

A moment later, Ji Ling’er exclaimed and could not help but say: "You guys are still virgins, aren’t you the brat’s wives?"

Su Meiyao chuckled, "That little scoundrel met us when he was still a child. We were already heavily injured at that time."

Then she blushed and said, "I can be considered his wife now. This little scoundrel is quite good."

"Did you see anything?" Chen Xiang asked.

"It’s a very strange injury. They all have a strange power inside their bodies and it has been devouring the energy inside their dantian all this time. As long as their dantian can condense that power, it will be devoured." Ji Ling’er said as his brows furrowed, "The energy within their dantian has been dispersed, but their foundation is still considered stable."

"They really need a type of sacred pill to recover their original strength."

Ji Ling’er frowned: "However, if we don’t expel that strange power from their bodies, even if they took the Holy Pellet, they would quickly return to their original state."

Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou seemed to know it too.

"Big Sister Ling’er, can you help us get rid of that strange power?" Bai Youyou asked.

Ji Ling’er laughed and said: "Of course I can, but I need some time. But as repayment, you all have to tell me some interesting things about this brat."

Su Meiyao looked at Chen Xiang and chuckled: "No problem, some of his matters aren’t secret either."
