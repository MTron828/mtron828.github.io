After leaving the City Lord Palace. As the sky grew dark, Chen Xiang found an inn to stay at and started to think of a plan. Right now, he was going to search for Devil-suppressing blood in the Sacred Dan Realm, but he did not have a single clue, and did not know where to start searching.

"The Devil-suppressing Heavenly Venerable is a person, all of us here respect him a lot. If he had really come to the Sacred Dan Realm, this old bastard in the Sacred Dan Realm would definitely know of some things about him. If he could come into contact with those old bastards, he would have a solution." Long Xueyi said.

The last time Chen Xiang came, he had met some people from the Nirvana Stage walking on the streets, but he did not encounter any of them since he came today. Long Xueyi said that there was a possibility of him meeting immortals in the Sacred Dan City, but immortals might not necessarily be those old bastards, and it would be extremely difficult to find those old fellows who were familiar with the affairs of the Devil-suppressing Heavenly Venerable.

"Isn’t Du Yanyao’s grandfather a Dan Immortal? To be able to become a Dan Immortal, you must have lived for a very long time. " Su Meiyao said: "Based on a woman’s intuition, I feel that this Du Yanyao does not hate you, and might even want to befriend you."

Chen Xiang smiled slightly: "Looks like I have to go meet her tonight. Since she’s a Alchemist, it’s a lot easier."

Let me help you pack a Nature fruit, and give it to her, it shouldn’t be a problem. Even if the Sacred Dan Realm has these things, it won’t be too much, so giving it to her won’t be a problem. Su Meiyao said. Chen Xiang could get a lot of these things, giving them to him in exchange for information about the Devil-suppressing blood. It was nothing.

Even entering the City Lord Palace would be extremely difficult, unless one were to exit from the entrance. In the darkness of the night, Chen Xiang turned into a black butterfly and easily snuck into the City Lord’s Palace.

"Little Naughty Dragon, quickly find that woman!" Chen Xiang said.

"Are you in a hurry to peek at her taking a shower or changing clothes or something?" Long Xueyi teased: "Let’s go and see, I also like to see beautiful women naked."

"Little pervert, you’re so much worse than me! I’m only thinking about it, but you dare to do it!" Chen Xiang scolded.

’s growth was partly because Chen Xiang had become stronger, and was also because she could eat so many rare and precious spirit fruits and pills all day long. She felt that even in the Heaven Realm, she would not be able to eat so many things, so she did not regret her decision to follow Chen Xiang at all.

I’m sorry to disappoint you, but this woman did not take a bath. She seemed to be walking towards the entrance of the City Lord Palace. Long Xueyi asked doubtfully.

Very quickly, Chen Xiang saw Du Yanyao, but he did not dare move at this moment. He, who had turned into a butterfly, laid quietly on a tree.

Only after Du Yanyao left the City Lord Palace did Chen Xiang secretly follow her. With Long Xueyi following her using the Heaven tour method, he was not worried about losing her.

"She quickened her pace. Is she leaving the city?" Long Xueyi said.

"Just follow him and you’ll know!" Chen Xiang turned into a bird and quickly flew away.

An hour later, Chen Xiang looked behind from high up in the sky. He only saw the lights of the Sacred Dan City s and from afar, it was actually a beautiful scene, yet he was still closely following Du Yanyao.

"Damn, this is my second time following this woman." Chen Xiang thought, this time Du Yanyao did not use someone to pull the carriage, but walked slowly.

Suddenly, Long Xueyi saw a person standing on top of a wasteland in front of her: "It’s a man, his strength is only at the early stage of the Hundred refining realm, his cultivation is fire attributed Innate Qi, he looks like a Alchemist!"

"This female City Lord really did come out to look for a man."

Chen Xiang also saw the man on the grassland, it was a very tall but very skinny man, with a considerably handsome appearance. He was dressed extremely well, which made people feel very comfortable.

"Eldest Miss, it’s been half a year since we last met, you look even more beautiful now!" Although he called Du Yanyao young miss, but he seemed to be good friends with Du Yanyao.

"Du Peng, when are you going back to the city to continue being one of the three City Lord? Gong Senliang is already dead, if I had to manage the Sacred Dan City by myself, I won’t be able to take it. " Du Yanyao’s tone of voice had actually become much gentler, but it still sounded as if it was a thousand miles away, ice-cold to the bone.

"Eldest Miss, I heard that the famous Little Flame Immortal from the Qian Family asked for your hand in marriage. Did you not accept?" Du Peng asked.

"Cut the crap, quickly bring me to look for that Purple dragon flower." Du Yanyao’s face sank, and her voice became much colder than before.

"Alright, but that place is a bit dangerous. That place is filled with poisonous miasma. I think the eldest miss should know about that poison as well." Du Peng shook his head and sighed, "I did not return to the city during this past year because I wanted to expel the poison. Eldest Miss, your grandfather has been missing for so many years ... "

"Don’t mention my grandpa’s disappearance!" Du Yanyao hollered in vain as she glared at Du Peng. "Are you worried that I won’t be able to cure you even if I get poisoned?"

Du Peng immediately sweated profusely, and said: "Yes, the poison over there is even stronger, I only saw the Purple dragon flower from afar and walked out hastily, if not, if I was any slower, I would have died inside."

Chen Xiang was secretly surprised in his heart. The legendary Dan Immortal of the Du Family had actually disappeared for many years, and the Du Family had always kept this a secret. It was to prevent other forces from infiltrating.

Of course, what made Chen Xiang even more surprised, was that Du Peng had actually found a Purple dragon flower, it was a type of immortal medicine, a flower of the Immortal Grade.

"Looks like I don’t need to waste any Nature fruit. This woman’s grandfather is missing, but it’s still okay. I think I’ll be able to get the Purple dragon flower soon." Chen Xiang said excitedly. That was a flower that could refine immortal pills, and he was from impenetrable. It would be as easy as flipping his palm if he wanted to enter that place.

"Immortal-poisoning Devil Forest? This forest was indeed very dangerous, but it was only in this kind of place that Purple dragon flower could grow! If you dare to enter deeper in, you must have some guts. However, being able to survive is a miracle. " Du Yanyao said in shock. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Long Xueyi shouted at this time: "I know about this Immortal-poisoning Devil Forest, because during the Primordial Era, a Sky Poison Dragon died there. Its highly toxic body melted and contaminated a large part of the forest, but because of the unique vitality contained within the body of the Poison Dragon, not only did those flowers and trees not die, they instead grew very well!"

Now, Chen Xiang understood why Du Yanyao said that the Purple dragon flower could only grow there!
