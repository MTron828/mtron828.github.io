Chen Xiang quickly found the deep pit that the World Defying holy dragon brought them out of last time, and then entered this deep pit. They quickly found a tunnel beneath it. "..."

"World Defying holy dragon s often run here and there, and they’ve always been able to open up many paths for us." Chen Xiang laughed and then controlled the Six Realms mirrors to roll, as he entered the pathway.

There were many tunnels below, and Chen Xiang could only go through them based on his memories from the last time he came out. Fortunately, his memories were very strong, and he was able to remember the way.

"We’ll be here soon. Let’s get out!" Qin Shuang said. They could feel a wave of heat coming from within the Six Realms mirrors. It was the aura of the blood fire in front.

"Alright!"

When they walked out of the Six Realms mirrors, Qin Shuang took out the array disc that could resist the blood fire. Chen Xiang also activated the Six Realms mirrors, releasing a light barrier to wrap him up.

"The energy aura released by the array disc is almost the same. Your Six Realms mirrors has copied it pretty well." Qin Shuang said.

"The array disc doesn’t absorb that much World Defying Stage Fierce Power, it can let us stay inside for a long time." Chen Xiang laughed: "I’ll try it out first!"

The giant tunnels below them were all very dark, and after walking for a while and reaching a bend, they saw a red light flashing in front of them, and right below them was the Blood Wind Fire Sea.

"Do you feel the heat?" Qin Shuang asked.

"It’s not too hot. It’s working." Chen Xiang said: "Before, when we were above, as long as we were near the Blood Wind Fire Sea, we would be able to feel the heat, and the flames underground were even more ferocious. But now, we are already near the flames, but we did not feel the heat, it should be the effect of the array disc’s power."

"En!" Qin Shuang nodded, then the two of them increased their pace and entered the blood flames.

After entering, Chen Xiang and Qin Shuang were a little nervous, they were worried that the array disc would be useless.

"Let’s not go into the depths yet." Qin Shuang saw Chen Xiang continuing to walk forward and anxiously shouted: "The Blood Fire’s special characteristic is that it becomes hotter and hotter, like an intelligent being, using warm water to boil the frog, so we will have to wait at the edge of the formation plate, even if the power of the formation plate cannot resist, we can quickly escape."

The last time she saw Chen Xiang’s Six Realms mirrors being transformed by the blood flames, she knew how terrifying the blood flames were. If not for the sudden appearance of the World Defying holy dragon that time, they would have turned to dust long ago.

Three days later, after Qin Shuang confirmed the formation plate’s ability to withstand flames, he finally dared to follow Chen Xiang inside.

"Xiao Shuangshuang, do you think there’s a Tao-creation Holy stone down there?" Along the way, Chen Xiang was surrounded by red flames, making it difficult to see anything. He also did not know how to find the Tao-creation’s Holy stone. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

"It’s hard for us to find the Tao-creation’s Holy stone in these tunnels ... Don’t you see the reason why World Defying holy dragon is digging underground? " Qin Shuang said.

"This guy drilled down there to find the Tao-creation’s Holy stone!" It was only now that Chen Xiang thought of it.

"Yes, or else he wouldn’t have the time to wander around below." Qin Shuang nodded his head: "If we want to find the Tao-creation’s Holy stone, we should first try going up."

When they entered, they saw that there were many complex and huge passages below, all made by World Defying holy dragon. Previously, Chen Xiang thought it was strange, but now he finally understood.

World Defying holy dragon also needed Tao-creation Holy stone, which was why they kept on searching below!

"Looks like the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystal that the World Defying holy dragon obtained was found below this." Chen Xiang said: "I wonder how long he took to find it!"

Chen Xiang only hoped that he would be able to find the Tao-creation’s Holy stone, and didn’t even need to think to find the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystal.

"I don’t know. How about we go find the World Defying holy dragon right now and ask if he has the trick to find the Tao-creation’s Holy stone." Qin Shuang said: "Otherwise, if we were to blindly search like this, without any direction, it would be extremely difficult to find."

"Alright, let’s go now!"

Very quickly, they arrived at the surface of the Blood Wind Fire Sea. Although it was covered by an intense blood flame, it was extremely calm, and when Chen Xiang and Qin Shuang passed through, they did not feel the terrifying burning pain from before.

They ran frantically for an entire day before finally arriving at Bloody Wind Island.

The World Defying holy dragon was currently circling above the Bloody Wind Island, no one knew what it was doing.

"It’s you guys, how did you get in?" The World Defying holy dragon had already sensed that someone’s aura was approaching, which was why he immediately flew into the air, wanting to see who it was.

"We entered by relying on a formation plate." Chen Xiang laughed: "Senior Holy Dragon, we are here at the Tao-creation."

"Senior Holy Dragon, how did you find the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystal before?" Qin Shuang asked: "Right now, we are able to walk safely within the Blood Wind Fire Sea. We want to go find the Tao-creation’s Holy stone, but we don’t know how to do so."

"I didn’t expect you to find a way to withstand the blood fire ..." Alright, I’ll tell you all about the characteristics of the Tao-creation’s Holy stone. " The World Defying holy dragon said: "To be honest, I have only seen Tao-creation’s Holy stone twice in this place!"

"So you’re saying, Senior, other than possessing the Tao-creation’s Sacred Crystals, there are also quite a few other Tao-creation’s Holy stone!" Chen Xiang laughed.

"No, although I have seen Tao-creation’s Holy stone, I have not been able to capture them. Tao-creation’s Holy stone are very cunning, they would run around everywhere, all the Tao-creation Holy stone I have seen are very small, in my eyes, they are just like grains of sand. It’s not easy for me to catch such a small thing, so I failed twice." The World Defying holy dragon said.

"Tao-creation’s Holy stone and Tao-creation’s Divine Crystals are just like fairies here, although they can’t speak, they can fly everywhere and even crawl into the ground easily, catching them would be extremely difficult." The World Defying holy dragon said: "You guys should have seen the tunnels underground. Some of them were made by me to catch Tao-creation Holy stone."

"Then how can I find the Tao-creation’s Holy stone?" asked. Even though World Defying holy dragon had been here for so long, they had only seen Tao-creation Holy stone twice and they had even escaped.

Chen Xiang and Qin Shuang suddenly felt that it was extremely difficult to obtain the Tao-creation Holy stone!

"Generally speaking, they would gather at the hottest place, so the Tao-creation Holy stone and the other little Fairies also knew that it was time to evolve. They could convert the intense heat into energy to strengthen themselves, and after a long period of time, they could make themselves even hotter, attracting other Tao-creation Holy stone over." The World Defying holy dragon said: "Once the other Tao-creation Holy stone pass by, they would be devoured by the hottest Tao-creation Holy stone."

"If I swallow more, it will become the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystal?" Qin Shuang said.

"Yes, that’s why the Tao-creation Divine Crystals are here, but it’s very difficult to find them." The World Defying holy dragon swirled in the air and said: "The Blood Wind Fire Sea is very vast, and there are strong flames below as well. The Tao-creation’s Holy stone and the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals can hide in many places."

Now, Chen Xiang and Qin Shuang understood even more clearly that it was not easy to obtain Tao-creation’s Holy stone and Tao-creation’s sacred crystals!
