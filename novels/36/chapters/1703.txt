"She is Bai Youyou’s older sister, Devil Scorpion Princess Bai Ziqian. You all should know her, right?" Long Xueyi laughed: "This Devil Scorpion Princess and Little Scoundrel’s relationship isn’t bad, of course she’s polite to you guys. Little Scoundrel helped her a few times, and gave her some Super Old poison s."

"No wonder she joined the Hundreds of Flowers Palace. It turns out it was all because of Little Scoundrel." Xue Xianxian scoffed, "It seems like the majority of the women who have good relations with the little scoundrel are now the four sisters Zi Lan, Yao Shumei, her mother, and Yu Xuelian, the Lotus Goblin ... And little sister Mu Qianxiang is also Boss Hua’s disciple. "

Long Xueyi chuckled: "Big Sister Little Fairy, then in the future, you should be mentally prepared. This little scoundrel’s hands will stretch out really long."

Liu Meng’er scoffed softly, "Also, the little scoundrel has saved Xue Ying before, and she has always kept him on her lips."

Leng Youlan laughed out loud: "Big bro is so awesome, I have everything. In the future, there will be more beautiful big sisters fighting with me."

Just as Leng Youlan finished speaking, he was pinched on his face by Xianxian as he rolled his eyes at her, causing all the girls present to laugh.

"Come, come, come. Let’s eat something good before we start our work. This is Holy Snow Pear, a very tasty and sweet sacred fruit."

Long Xueyi very generously took out these holy fruits, and then took out a set of tools, and began to make these Golden jade fish s. Other than that, there were also some extremely delicious, sweet, and high-grade immortal fruits that squeezed out the juice.

"It’s such a pity that Little Sister Qianxiang isn’t here. These things are way too extravagant." Leng Youlan’s eyes shone as he looked at the precious Holy Fruit and Immortal Fruits on the stone table.

"No wonder you were able to stay in this place for so long. It’s so delicious." Xue Xianxian took a light bite of the Holy Snow Pear.

Liu Meng’er and Dongfang Jing also savored the taste, with Leng Youlan being the only big and tall one, finishing one in two or three bites.

Dongfang Xinyue, Pearl and Kong Bailing had been here for a few days already, so they had already tasted it.

"Jing Jing, this is the inheritance fruit from the Vermilion Bird Ancestor. Eat it now, and cultivate well here. Only by obtaining the Vermilion Bird Ancestor’s inheritance will you become stronger, and only then will you be able to help your brother." Dongfang Xinyue gave Dongfang Jing a fiery-red fruit.

Dongfang Jing nodded, and she listened to Dongfang Xinyue’s words very carefully: "Aunt, it’s been hard on you, I’ll definitely make good use of it."

"Jingjing, hurry up and become stronger. This way, I won’t always win against you in fights in the future." Leng Youlan laughed. "In the future, we can go and kill the Night Devil together."

After Dongfang Jing ate it, he entered a secret room and went into closed door cultivation. There were instructions for him on what to do next.

Chen Xiang gave some Blood Pills to the girls, but they did not eat them now, as they still had urgent matters to attend to.

"There are no crafting furnaces here, so it shouldn’t be a problem for you." Long Xueyi asked.

"The effect isn’t too big. We are mainly cultivating the Divine Path. Although we don’t have a soul yet, we can already use our soul consciousness and our Saint Force to forge artifacts in the void. It shouldn’t be a problem for us to work together." Liu Meng’er said. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Liu Meng’er and Xue Xianxian had already turned into saints, although they were only at the Divine Immortal level, their foundation was very stable, and they had very high attainments in artifact forging.

Long Xueyi said: "How about this, I will use my divine power to create a cauldron for you guys, when the time comes I will cooperate with you, this will save you some energy."

"You guys don’t have a soul, this isn’t good. Once I’ve done this, I’ll have the little scoundrel think of a way to get a soul for each of you." Long Xueyi said.

"I don’t need it." Leng Youlan laughed, "It existed when my White Dragon Vein awakened."

"I don’t need it. I obtained it through the Vermillion Bird Legacy Fruit." Dongfang Xinyue said.

Chen Xiang didn’t hear the conversation of the few women inside. He was currently approaching the dark area continuously, he was only approaching it first, and wouldn’t enter it for the time being unless he was forced to.

Now that he had brought a few of his beloved women with him, he didn’t want to risk his life with them. Thus, he had to be even more careful.

As Chen Xiang travelled, he suddenly felt a very weak change in the temperature of his surroundings. This was because his Divine Deity was a little special, so he was very sensitive to everything around him.

There is an aura that is different from the aura of the Divine Fire Forest’s flames. Although it seems to be close, and it means that something is approaching, Xue Yi, help me look at what is approaching. It seems to be a fire beast, but its aura shouldn’t be like this. Chen Xiang said.

Hearing Chen Xiang’s voice, other than Long Xueyi, Dongfang Xinyue and the others, Xue Xianxian, who just entered the Youyao Ring, became anxious. They knew that Chen Xiang’s situation was similar to what it had been for many years, but they had never experienced it with Chen Xiang personally, so they could not help but be anxious. However, this helped them understand more about how difficult it was for Chen Xiang to be outside, and it was not like they imagined it would happen.

Long Xueyi’s detection abilities were a little stronger than Chen Xiang’s, but because she was in the Serene Jade Ring, her senses were not as sharp as Chen Xiang’s.

"The aura of this flame is very special, and it has a hint of the odour of hell. It’s just like the Arrogant Wolf God, but it’s not the kind of extremely evil power that the Arrogant Wolf God possesses." Long Xueyi frowned, "Could it be the Hell Suppressing Guardians of the Infernal Realm? I heard that the flames these things emit are extremely harmful to the demons of the Infernal Realm.

Chen Xiang immediately increased his speed, raising it to the limit. He was also traveling through space a lot of distance, and the guy chasing him now also came from hell, he looked to be about as strong as the Arrogant Wolf God.

"These prison guards aren’t real gods, but their strengths are very strong. They should be specially used in the Infernal Realm to deal with some of the weaker little devils, but if they can obtain Divine Deity, then they can become real gods. Therefore, Divine Deity is a great temptation for them." Long Xueyi said.

In this Divine Fire Forest, the power that the Hell Suppressing Guardians unleashed was far stronger than that of the Arrogant Wolf God. In order to kill him, the Hell Devil Emperor had spent a lot of effort and used all kinds of power from hell to give him this treatment. In the ten days ago, Great Yan Jing did not have this kind of treatment.

"Could it be that she’s about to force her way into the darkness? I don’t know what’s inside, but the Vermillion Bird didn’t remind me. Could it be that even she didn’t truly enter into the darkness?" Chen Xiang looked ahead. Although he did not see the dark area, he felt that they were approaching.
