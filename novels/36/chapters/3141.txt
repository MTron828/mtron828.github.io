After the third brother had been injured, the other two had become extremely angry. This was because it had already implicated them, so when something like this happened to them, they would become the most furious.

Chen Xiang could see the anger on their faces, as if they wanted to kill Ol ’Three right now.

"These guys are really ruthless, are all Heaven Old Divine Race people like this?" Chen Xiang thought back to what happened to Chen Cai. Originally, Chen Cai had been hunted down and killed by the people of Heaven Old Divine Race, and the main reason was that he possessed the bloodline of the Heaven Old Orcs.

"It’s time to make a move!" Chen Xiang quietly went over to Old Third’s side.

Ol ’Three was quickly healing himself, and he even took out a bottle of pills. He poured out two of them.

"What pill is this?" It looks pretty good! " Chen Xiang smelled the fragrance of the elegant pill and couldn’t help but to become spirited. The quality of the pill was very high, its refining methods were also very different, he could tell at a glance.

"Mine!" Chen Xiang laughed, he had already rushed to the back of the third brother, and the Heavenly magic sword instantly pierced through the third brother’s back and stabbed into his heart.

"Dead!"

Chen Xiang immediately threw Old Third’s body into the Tianchuang furnace. He had already gotten the bottle of pills.

At this moment, the Tianchuang furnace was trembling non-stop, because there was a World Defying mad source bead inside recklessly making its way forward. Chen Xiang immediately ordered Feng Ke’er to release the sealing power to suppress it.

"Have they found out?" Chen Xiang immediately hid himself.

The reason he had been so easy to get his hands on was mainly because the third brother was already heavily injured and they weren’t very defensive. This place was already a very intense battlefield, and he felt that no one would come here, so he was so relaxed.

"Ol ’Three is gone!" A Heaven Old Divine Race man suddenly shouted.

When Chen Xiang heard it, he had already teleported.

"Has Ol ’Three run away?" They didn’t know that their third brother had been killed by Chen Xiang.

They could not split their attention either, it would be very difficult for the two of them to deal with Heaven Old Super Beast King, but now that Ol ’Three suddenly ran away, it made them feel even more pressured, and they had already decided to give up.

"Let’s go!"

Just as that person finished shouting, Chen Xiang had already quickly flew over, stabbed him in the chest, and then threw him into the Tianchuang furnace.

"Fourth Bro!" The remaining one should be number two. Seeing his comrade pierced, he immediately understood that number three must have also been killed in this way.

After the second brother let out a scream, Heaven Old Super Beast King’s palm had already struck over, striking his head, causing it to explode. In the moment of shock, the second brother had accidentally let his guard down, and was attacked by Heaven Old Super Beast King.

Chen Xiang immediately chased after him, he teleported extremely quickly, arriving in front of the second brother, he slashed at the chest, and after the heart was destroyed, he anxiously threw the corpse into the Tianchuang furnace.

"I’ve finally settled it. It was surprisingly easy." Chen Xiang did not expect himself to be able to kill three Heaven Old Divine Race people in such a short time.

The main reason was because they were standing and fighting with the Heaven Old Super Beast King s, and did not expect Chen Xiang to be here. Even more so, they did not expect Chen Xiang’s strength to be so strong that they could hide and not be discovered. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Chen Xiang told Feng Ke’er to seal the three World Defying mad source bead inside so they wouldn’t collide with each other inside, otherwise his Tianchuang furnace would be destroyed.

"This guy seems to be able to sense me." Chen Xiang was still invisible, but Heaven Old Super Beast King was looking at him.

"He’s very strong, you’d better forget about it." Feng Ke’er warned them: "Let’s go and find the one that is still in Heaven Old Divine Race. That guy is the boss, he’s the strongest one there, focus on dealing with him."

"En!" Chen Xiang really wanted to fight with the Heaven Old Super Beast King, but he did not have the confidence. Earlier, the three Heaven Old Divine Race people did their best to not take him down, so he definitely could not as well.

"Goodbye!" Just as Chen Xiang teleported away, he was only able to enter the spatial tunnel, but he was caught by a force, which shocked him greatly.

"What’s going on?" After Chen Xiang was pulled out, he fell hard onto the ground, and saw the gorilla like Heaven Old Super Beast King.

"What’s going on? After Feng Ke’er asked this, he also saw the situation outside.

"Human, why are you helping me?" Heaven Old Super Beast King actually spoke. His voice was very hoarse, but everyone could hear him clearly.

"I... They were my enemies in the first place, and I just took this opportunity to kill them. " Chen Xiang said honestly: "I didn’t provoke you, let me go!"

"Where are you going?" Heaven Old Super Beast King asked: "You have the ability to travel through space, can you bring me out of this space? "Before, this place was still very weak. At that time, I could still leave this place myself, but now, I can’t."

"This... Where are you going? " Chen Xiang asked.

"I just need to leave this place. I don’t have any direction to stay here, so I can’t find the place I need to go." Heaven Old Super Beast King’s eyes were filled with confusion.

"Oh? Where are you going? " Chen Xiang suddenly became curious: "I heard from them that you are from the Heaven Old Super Realm, right?"

"Yes, that’s not a good place. You want to go?" Heaven Old Super Beast King asked.

"I don’t want to go. I have another enemy here. I’m going to destroy him." Chen Xiang shook his head, he never thought that the Heaven Old Super Beast King would actually have such a human nature, and did not have any enmity towards him.

"If I leave, can you help me?" The Heaven Old Super Beast King said again.

"Alright!" Chen Xiang thought about it, and finally decided to take this Heaven Old Super Beast King away and help him.

After Chen Xiang accepted him into the Six Realms mirrors, he came to Divine Wasteland. After he released the Heaven Old Super Beast King, the Heaven Old Super Beast King was very excited, he said that this was the place he was going to and was very grateful to Chen Xiang.

"I will definitely repay you in the future. Goodbye!" After Heaven Old Super Beast King finished speaking, he quickly ran away and disappeared.

Chen Xiang shook his head, he then returned to the Natural Law World, there were still many Tiangu beast here, but he did not need to worry about them, if the many experts joined hands, they could still force them to retreat.

It’s just that the Heaven Old Divine Race was not easy to deal with, not to mention he was the strongest one among the five.

"This guy is still hunting Tiangu beast." Chen Xiang closed his eyes, and quickly locked onto the location of the Heaven Old Divine Race.

After finding it, he immediately teleported over.

But just as he went over, the Heaven Old Divine Race person disappeared!

"Let’s go!" Chen Xiang felt a trace of Qi remaining, and was shocked, the other party seemed to suddenly come over and immediately ran away.
