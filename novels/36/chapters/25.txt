Chapter 26: Real stage

Chen Xiang nodded and said: “Understood, Sister Youyou sister, when will you teach me those devil skills?”

Bai Youyou looked at him coldly out of the corner of her eye, and said: “You haven’t even completely grasped junior sister’s [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] yet, so don’t even think about learning the devil skills. You still have a long way to go.”

Chen Xiang was currently able to use only a portion of the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise] and the [Vermillion Bird Divine Exercise], while the [White Tiger Divine Exercise] and the [Black Tortoise Divine Exercise] were exceptionally difficult to practice, and also had some special requirements to practice them.

[Azure Dragon Claw] and [Azure Dragon Roar] from the [Azure Dragon Divine Exercise] were relatively easy to learn, and [Vermillion Bird Profound Fire] and [Vermillion Bird Fire Wing] were also the same. Although the [Divine Exercise of Four Symbols] consisted of many powerful martial techniques, they required a certain amount of strength to be able to start practicing them, otherwise Qigong deviation would occur.

[TLN: Qigong deviation is simply imbalance in Qi.]

Late at night, hidden deep below the ground, inside a private room, a ‘peng peng’ sound was being transmitted intermittently. This was caused by Chen Xiang practising his martial skills. Just looking at his bare-chest, one could see incomparably strong muscles, that turned to a shade of dark red due to the slightly surging out hot Qi, while he was standing steadily in a horse stance and was hitting the iron wall not far away from him. At this time, hot Qi waves were bursting out of his fists, combined with an invisible fist strength and were striking the iron wall, due to which the land shook and trembled.

“Not bad, within a day’s time, you were able to grasp the [Fire King Fists], which is a basic attack skill of the [Vermillion Bird Divine Exercise]. However it gets more difficult as you advance, you can now rest up.” Su Meiyao was also a little bored and tired as she had been sitting there watching as Chen Xiang practised for the whole day.

Chen Xiang looked at that mature and ample bosom of Su Meiyao, and with a smile said, “Sister Meiyao, I need to take a shower, would you like to join?”

Su Meiyao with her gentle and enchanting voice, and eyes full of charm said, “I have to call senior sister to join us. I fear you will not be honest at that time.”

Speaking of Bai Youyou, Chen Xiang’s complexion suddenly froze: “Forget about it.”

Su Meiyao, while laughing loudly, entered the invisible ring on Chen Xiang’s finger. Inside the ring, there was a small room, where all the daily necessities were present. Inside the ring, the two girls’ lives were also very relaxed.

The next day, Chen Xiang woke up and spat out the ‘Dragon Saliva’ present inside his mouth in a small bottle, but he did not immediately go out and pour it on some herbs. He was currently saving and leaving it for the future.

Chen Xiang wanted to look for Chen Luzhong to talk about alchemy, but did not expect that Chen Luzhong had already departed to purchase the spirit herbs. Moreover he also left behind spirit herbs required to refine dans.

These were already matured spirit herbs, Chen Xiang was also very happy to use them for refining dans, which could also help increase his alchemical experience.

One day, two days, after three days had passed, Chen Xiang finished all the spirit herbs left behind by Chen Luzhong. Because most of these spirit herbs were of the low-grade mortal level, the dans refined were also of same level. At this time the Chen Family also had enough dans to cope for some time.

These days, many of the Chen Family juniors gathered around Chen Xiang. Chen Xiang would often go to martial arts field and exchange pointers with the Chen Family youths, and would sometimes also give them advice, which was very helpful for them.

“Xiang Er, can you attend the King City’s martial art tournament and obtain the first place reward of the High-Grade Spirit Level True Elemental Dan?” Chen Tianhu suddenly came to the martial arts field.

Chen Xiang, after giving it some thought, said, “I want to go to other cities to purchase some spirit herbs. At that time, along the way if it is convenient I will participate!”

At this time, one of the Chen Family children said, “Chen Xiang please participate. If we go it will definitely be hopeless, but I heard that in the King City’s martial arts tournament many talented people will be participating. Some even have the strength at the 7th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm.”

One girl while nodding also said, “I also heard that many people who returned from martial arts sects will also be participating.”

Chen Xiang heard all the information which can be summarized as such. King City’s martial arts tournament was held once every ten years. The participants must be below the age of twenty, and it was conducted by the largest city of Southern Martial Empire, King City. The present area of King City was previously the location of four different cities, but as the cities developed more and more and more people started to settle in, the four cities expanded and got well interconnected which later resulted in them combining to form a single major city.That was King City

King City was also the royal capital of the Southern Martial Empire. The Yao Family and the imperial palace were also situated there. Many of the formidable families of the Southern Martial Empire were also established there, which led to many experts gathering there.

Chen Tianhu also nodded and said, “King City’s martial arts tournament also has one more purpose which is to select some excellent practitioners to enter those martial arts sects. You should already know that the whole Southern Martial Empire is affiliated with those martial arts sects!”

Martial arts families were required to pay taxes each year as a tribute to the imperial palace, while the Southern Martial Empire offered them to martial arts sects. Obviously these martial arts sects were formidable enough to dominate all the major families of the whole kingdom. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Do not think that these taxes are handed over in vain, you should know that these martial arts sects are necessary to maintain our safety. Otherwise this place will most likely encounter a group of demon beasts, demons or devils and will be easily slaughtered.” Chen Tianhu was looking up at the sky as he said in an imposing tone.

All the Chen family juniors suddenly went into an uproar. Previously they thought that these big sects were some kind of legendary existences, but now that they came to know that these legendary sects maintained such close relations with the mortal world, they were surprised.

The Southern Martial Empire could be considered to be very big with a population of some dozen hundred millions, but still there weren’t many truly powerful martial practitioners and as for alchemists, they were as rare as finding the feathers of a phoenix and horns of a unicorn. However, with such a huge population, there were bound to be some good martial practitioners, so these martial arts sect would sometimes come here to recruit such practitioners. The fastest and the most effective way to select them was to gather all of these formidable and strong youngsters in a place and make them fight and the strongest from them all would attain the qualifications to enter these martial arts sects.

[TLN: feathers of phoenix and horns of unicorn, Chinese idiom meaning extremely rare]

Chen Xiang arrived at the library with Chen Tianhu. Along the way Chen Xiang noticed that Chen Tianhu must have had something important to say, because Chen Tianhu’s complexion had been very serious since earlier.

Once they were inside the library, Chen Tianhu said, “Xiang Er, your granduncle Chen Luzhong has already gone to King City! Our Chen family in the eyes of many people is considered to be a formidable martial arts aristocratic family, but we are still unable to enter the King City. We cannot be regarded as an unconditionally strong and prosperous family, so our Chen Family’s next target is King City.”

Chen Xiang also heard some information, such as the Yao Family also had some relations with those martial arts sects and also that the Yao Family doesn’t pay taxes to the imperial palace but rather directly offers them to these sects.

“The Xue Family is also migrating to King City now! Because of Xue Xianxian, the Xue Family was able to establish themselves due to their relations with a strong martial arts sect! But if we want to strive there and open a path for the Chen Family, we can only rely on you and your granduncle.” Chen Tianhu’s hands were pressing on Chen Xiang’s shoulder as he sincerely said.

Chen Xiang while frowning asked, “What do I need to do? Join a martial arts sect?”

Chen Tianhu shook his head and said, “No, even if you are able to join a martial arts sect, the Chen Family still will not be able to get the support of those big sects. Now the only way is to get our Chen Family noticed by those big sects, and then make them look for us on their own initiative! The only way to do this is to show off your talent in alchemy.”

Chen Xiang’s gaze turned fierce, a bright flash flickered in his eyes, and he was grinning with a smile as he said, “I know what to do. I will pick some things up and then go to King City and meet up with granduncle.”

Chen Tianhu patted Chen Xiang’s shoulder, and with a smile on his face, said, “Xiang Er, your stage is not here in this mortal world, but rather at those martial arts sects where strong practitioners are as numerous as trees in a forest!”
