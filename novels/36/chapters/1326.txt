Chen Xiang didn’t know where the Five Snake Mountain was, but after asking around, he knew that it was not too far away from the main palace’s center, and there was a mountain there that looked like five snakes coiling together.

It was only dark now, but Chen Xiang had already arrived at Five Snake Mountain, waiting for the Elder Uncle Li to arrive. Before he came, he had already asked about the Elder Uncle Li and only knew that the Elder Uncle Li had suddenly appeared, without any background and without any strength, but his pill refining skills were extremely brilliant. Even though he was just staying at the third floor to help the people concoct the Ground level pills, many people thought that he was a Dan Immortal.

He had been in that Myriad Dan Building for more than ten years, and during this period of time, many great powers had tried to rope him in, but none of them succeeded.

Late at night, the silver moonlight shone down onto the Five Snake Mountain’s summit. Chen Xiang was lying on a flat rock, bathing in the moonlight as he admired the dazzling stars in the sky. The stars here were exactly the same as the one he saw when he was at Di Tian’s place.

"Dragon Subduing School, I’m guessing you’re very early." ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

These words caused Chen Xiang to jump in fright, but at the same time, caused him to become cautious.

"You know me." Chen Xiang’s face was filled with caution as his entire body tensed up as if he was about to face a great enemy.

If I had any ill intentions towards you, I would not have arranged to meet you here. However, we should be considered to be on the same side, and my disciple is living a good life in your Dragon Subduing School. The Elder Uncle Li laughed.

Chen Xiang was startled, then exclaimed: "You are Li Tianjun."

Back then, when he was still in Mortal Martial Realm,’s name was very resounding, and Li Baojun was his disciple. However, later on, he heard that Li Tianjun lost to an old granny and had nothing left to lose.

"How did you recognize me? I managed to deceive many powerful people." Chen Xiang was still wary.

"I don’t know what that feeling is, but it’s because of the experience I gained from refining pills. As long as you get near, I will feel that wonderful feeling, and it’s hard to say for sure. I heard my disciple talk about you, so I guessed that it was very possible that it was you." When Li Tianjun mentioned this matter, his face was also at a loss, he himself did not know what was going on.

"Maybe it’s because the alchemy dao you walked in was different from mine, but your goal is the same, so I have this feeling."

"When did the Elder Li tell you about me?" Chen Xiang asked: "Are you still able to contact him?"

The information here is very difficult to transmit. At that time, he had mentioned to me about your unique method of refining pills, so the last time you were refining the Relive Dan, I already knew that it was you. "" What method? Li Tianjun said.

Now that Chen Xiang saw his old appearance, of course it was not his original appearance.

"I’m just curious as to why you are not staying in the palace at all. Weren’t you staying in the sixth shop very well in the beginning, then why did you come out again? I even heard that you came from the Devil-killing Summit." Li Tianjun asked curiously.

"That Sixth Prince is not a good person, so I ran away." Chen Xiang sighed: "Now that he is the King, I have to be more careful."

Li Tianjun obviously did not know about the other things he had done here.

"Senior Li, why are you here as well? I heard that you lost to a fellow called Bi Xia Dan Immortal." Chen Xiang asked, not afraid of the pain of stabbing Li Tianjun, because Li Baojun had said that he, his master, was very easy to get along with.

Li Tianjun shook his head and laughed: "There’s nothing I can do, I’m also a human. There will always be a time when I lose, I have to say that Bi Xia Dan Immortal is really powerful, I was too arrogant back then, but it was a good thing for me, I grew up a lot."

"It’s good to meet someone I know here, even though it’s our first time meeting." Li Tianjun patted Chen Xiang’s shoulder and laughed.

"Senior Li, to be honest, I have to thank you. Although I’ve never met you before, the medicinal fields you left behind are of great help to me." Chen Xiang said with a solemn face.

"You’re welcome. The things I left behind are useless to me." Li Tianjun looked at the busy city in the distance: "It’s just that I never thought that a guy like you would actually have such great abilities, and walk a different path."

"I can teach you that pill refining technique." Chen Xiang immediately said.

"There’s no need. I also want to try and see if I can break through that rigid rule and walk my own path. That will give me a bit more of a sense of accomplishment." Li Tianjun smiled in relief.

This made Chen Xiang admire him even more.

"Before long, Bi Xia Dan Immortal will come here. At that time, we might be able to fight against her again." Li Tianjun sighed softly.

"Oh, could it be that this is a competition organized by the new King? When the time comes, I will also be participating." Chen Xiang said: "I’m going to take the prize. This new king shouldn’t be too stingy."

Li Tianjun laughed: "He Peiqing has always been generous with his rewards, the prizes will definitely be good stuff, but at that time, the ones who can last until the end will all be at Dan Immortal’s level, and the specifics will depend on the competition rules."

"Isn’t this competition supposed to be a show of power for all Alchemist?" Chen Xiang frowned.

"That’s true, but anyone can participate. When the time comes, all the Alchemist s will be allowed to participate, but the pill refining level of the Dan Immortal will definitely be much higher than the other Alchemist s. In the layers of the competition, I’m afraid only the Alchemist would be able to stand out." Li Tianjun said: "But if it’s you, then maybe you can break out of this situation."

Furthermore, this Li Tianjun would also want to participate. Although he had used the Heavenly Alchemy to walk on a different path of pill dao, he was still too young.

It can be said that it’s a contest between Alchemist s and Alchemist s of the entire Myriad Dan Immortal Country. However, at that time, I won’t be able to represent Myriad Dan Immortal Country, and would be able to defeat both Sacred Dan Realm s in one fell swoop. That would be more interesting. " Li Tianjun smiled, his eyes full of ambition as he looked into the distance.

Chen Xiang slightly clenched his fists, and laughed: "If I could defeat a large group of Dan Immortal, it would be even more interesting."

Li Tianjun looked at Chen Xiang and laughed: "I look forward to it."

But come to think of it, you don’t need to take first place, as long as you can make it to the last place, it will be enough to slap those Dan Immortal’s face. But you have to be careful, don’t expose your identity. Li Tianjun’s face became serious.
