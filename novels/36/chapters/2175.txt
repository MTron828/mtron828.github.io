Chen Xiang climbed out of the water, released some hot air to dry his clothes, and then laughed: "You two demon spirits, you two sure get along well! Did you miss me? "

Su Meiyao chuckled: "Who would miss a little scoundrel like you?"

Chen Xiang pinched her face and asked: Where’s Qianqian? "She’s concocting pills?"

"No, she said she wanted to go out for a walk with Youlan and the others." Hua Xiangyue charmingly laid on Chen Xiang’s left shoulder and stuck to Chen Xiang: "Little Scoundrel, we haven’t met for so long, shouldn’t you do something?"

Chen Xiang laughed sinisterly: "You said it yourself!" Then, he looked at Su Meiyao. Su Meiyao had come into contact with his gaze that was filled with possession, and even though his face was red, he was not willing to be outdone, "You damned brat, watch how I’ll take care of you."

Chen Xiang laughed loudly as he carried Hua Xiangyue on his shoulder. After that, he embraced Su Meiyao and quickly entered a room.

... ....

Afterwards, Chen Xiang laid on the bed happily, while Su Meiyao and Hua Xiangyue, these two beauties, also lied on his two sides, hugging his body.

"Little Scoundrel, what happened in Divine Nations this time?" She had long given her all to Chen Xiang, and she really wanted to give her everything as well. She wanted to give everything to Chen Xiang as soon as possible, so that she could finally get what she wanted.

"A lot of things have happened! I have also learned how to refine Shangpin dan and brought back quite a few divine medicines. Next, I will pass on to you the refining experience of Shangpin dan. " Chen Xiang hugged two beautiful girls, but his expression was extremely stern: "The Divine Nations is in a mess right now, they can’t do anything to us, but once they calm down, they might join hands to fight against us, so we have to hurry and become stronger."

The sky had already brightened up, and they had been in a frenzy for an entire night. Su Meiyao finished dressing himself, and said with a chuckle: "You can start now, we don’t want to become your burden!"

Hua Xiangyue laughed tenderly: "I’ll call Qianqian back right now. Our pill refining team had been in closed door cultivation all day, and we only rested during this period of time."

After Hua Xiangyue took out the Communication jade Symbol paper, she slowly put on her clothes. She purposely dressed slowly because Chen Xiang was really staring at her.

"Not even dual cultivating?" Hua Xiangyue laughed, "If you don’t dual cultivate, you can’t condense those purple pearls to duplicate!"

Chen Xiang smirked: "I actually train together with you guys, but none of you are very free! Furthermore, that kind of purple pearl reproducing Shangpin medicine s is not very effective, you guys should let Big Sis Qilian think of a way to see if there are any breakthroughs in the Alive Slain Method. In short, I haven’t cultivated for a long time! "

"Oh right, who is your pill refining team?" 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"Du Yanyao, Ji Ling’er, Hong Xia, Qianqian, the two of us, as well as Sister Feng, are the big sisters." Su Meiyao said: "We have used decades of time and have finally cultivated to the state where our hearts and minds are one. This way, when we are refining pills together, we will be able to achieve twice the results with half the effort."

Hua Xiangyue laughed: "Just like Meng’er and the rest who are working together to refine, we now have a very big pill furnace. The few of us can control it together, and even if it is more difficult to refine a pill, we can handle it."

"Compared to me, you guys are still far behind. Don’t be complacent!" Chen Xiang laughed, he had improved a lot after coming back from the Divine Cauldron Nation.

"I don’t believe you, you just went to the Divine Cauldron Nation a few days ago, but several decades have passed here. We have improved a lot in these few years, how can we not be able to beat you?" Su Meiyao pouted. "Don’t intentionally brag to trick us, we aren’t stupid."

Su Meiyao felt that this was also reasonable, because they had spent a lot more time than Chen Xiang. After a trip to the Divine Cauldron Nation, they had all entered the Supreme God Realm.

With regards to his beloved women, Chen Xiang didn’t need to hide much from them. He giggled and took out a set of Bone level Dan’s divine medicine.

"Do you know what this is?" Chen Xiang sat on the bed and asked with a smile.

"Of course I know of the Divine Flower of Bloodbone, the Seven Emotions and the Heavenly Muscle Grass! They were all low rank divine medicines used to refine Xiaping bone level Dan! Forget about this Xiaping bone level Dan, we had already refined Zhongpin bone level Dan s. Basically, all of us have one Bones and Sister Qilian and the others have even more. Su Meiyao stuck out his tongue: "What, do you think you’re very strong just because you refined the Bone level Dan?"

Chen Xiang pinched Su Meiyao’s charming jade face, and laughed: How many pills can you guys refine in one furnace?

"Six pills!" Hua Xiangyue gave a bland and charming smile, "You seem to also have six pellets right! Our team can already have six pills now. Although you have imparted the Heavenly Alchemy to us, it doesn’t mean that we can’t surpass you. We will now learn the ’Seven Souls Refinement’ from the Heavenly Alchemy, which is also the integration of seven souls into our team. "

Just now, Chen Xiang had already known that the women’s pill refining teams were respectively Feng Yujie, Su Meiyao, Wu Qianqian, Wu Qianqian, Hong Xia and Ji Ling’er!

Red Cloud and Ji Ling’er had only started to learn later on. At that time, they had acknowledged Feng Yujie as their mother and learned a lot. Her grandfather was also a very strong Alchemist. Now in the Nine Heaven School, and his disciple were the Nine Heaven School’s Pill God.

Feng Yujie had obtained one of the Nine Divine Kings’s inheritance of pill refining and had mastered many pill formulas, so now that the seven of them had become one, she became extremely formidable.

"Oh? If there’s a chance, I’ll have to see your seven souls refine it! " Chen Xiang grinned and said: "Do you want to see me refine six Bone level Dan?"

"Let’s just watch and see. I really want to see how much stronger you are compared to us." Hua Xiangyue was a little unwilling, because they had worked hard these past few years. The reason the village could improve so much was because of their pill refining, they felt that they would not lose to Chen Xiang, although they knew of Chen Xiang’s pill refining abilities.

Just as Chen Xiang was about to start training, Feng Yujie’s tender laughter came from outside, "The three of you have been playing for an entire night, are you still unwilling to come out?"

When Su Meiyao and Hua Xiangyue heard it, they couldn’t help but blush slightly and walk out of the bed, opening the door.

The door was wide open, and Chen Xiang was not wearing any clothes, so he was still holding onto the Bone level Dan’s divine medicine.

Chen Xiang opened the door wide and saw Wu Qianqian, and beside Wu Qianqian was a noble and mature beautiful woman, she was cold and looked extremely handsome, as if she was the kind of woman who had a strong and explosive personality.

"Yanyao!" Chen Xiang could not help but shout out, "Long time no see!"

When Du Yanyao saw this, he could not help but burst out laughing, because Chen Xiang had not put on his clothes yet. After becoming sworn sisters with Yan Zilan, she had become more and more cheerful. However, when she wasn’t laughing, she was still quite domineering.
