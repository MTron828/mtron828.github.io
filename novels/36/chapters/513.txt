Inside the cave, there was only a dark and damp stone room. Although there were seats and chairs, they were all made of stone, but they were still quite clean.

“Zhong Quan, Liao Shaoyun, I will kill both of you with my own hands!” Chen Xiang swallowed another piece of Hell Ganoderma and circulated the medicinal energy in his body to heal his wounds.

“If you choose a place devoid of people, you would have a 50% chance to get rid of Zhong Quan with your Demon Arts and Xueyi’s power. As for Liao Shaoyun, it would be very difficult! He is a person who is about to enter the Nirvana Realm. Your strength is far inferior to his.” Bai Youyou said. She hadn’t been together with Chen Xiang for a day or two, so she could feel the fury in Chen Xiang’s heart.

Chen Xiang said, “I must kill Zhong Quan in front of so many people in the Demon Subduing Academy. Otherwise, it will be difficult for me to vent the anger in my heart!”

After his shoot his words, he opened the book of Demon Subduing Force and began to recite the chant.

Seeing that Chen Xiang was so determined, Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou did not disturb him. When Chen Xiang recited the chant, they also silently memorized it. They also felt that this Demon Subduing Force was very hard to learn, even though the two of them had a deep foundation in martial arts. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, the two of them had never learned the Tai Chi Dragon Subduing Technique or the Evil Suppressing Divine Technique. Thus the Demon Subduing Force was much more simple for Chen Xiang.

He only used four hours to memorize the mantra of the Demon Force Force and then started to practice it. He chanted the mnemonic chant while controlling the flow of True Qi and circulating it a few times in his body to generate a powerful force.

With a “pump" sound, Chen Xiang threw a punch. However, the force did not shoot out, but exploded on his fist, causing his fist to be in extreme pain.

“I didn’t control my power well, and I was in too much of a hurry.” Chen Xiang quickly understood what was wrong with him and started from the beginning. When he first condensed the Demon Subduing Force, it was very slow and would take a period of time. However, when he became familiar with it, he would be able to instantly release it.

Seeing that Chen Xiang had only studied it for a short period but already managed to master half of the technique, Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou were both a little surprised. They felt that if it was them, it would take at least a long time to learn the first level.

“The Demon Subduing Force should come from the Heavenly Realm. Such kind of martial arts can be considered very powerful even in the Heavenly Realm, especially when used to deal with demons and goblins.” Su Meiyao said. Although they didn’t have much power at the moment, they still had a certain amount of True Qi in their bodies, so they could also learn it.

Bai You nodded, “the Demon Subduing Power can restrain demon essence. Once a demon gets struck by it, the demon essence in its body will certainly shatter."

Chen Xiang did not know why, but the Demon Subduing Force seemed to be very simple for him. He could understand it just by thinking consciously about it. Furthermore, it was not difficult to practice it and he could do as he wished. However, he was still not very familiar with it.

“Maybe this is because of the Devil Suppression Divine Technique, which is also a very powerful divine art. The Demon Subduing Force is very likely created from the Devil Suppression Divine Technique!” Su Meiyao could only explain in this way. Chen Xiang had already mastered the Devil Suppression Divine Technique, so any martial arts related to the Demon Suppression Divine Technique would become very simple in his eyes.

“Hmph!” Chen Xiang grunted and threw out a punch. With a “pa la” sound, it was as if a bolt of lightning had struck down. However, the sound was rather soft.

An invisible force hit a rock on the table and turned it into dust. He only tried twice before succeeding, but he was still not very familiar with it.

"It is indeed powerful. I only used a small amount of True Qi a moment ago, but it was already able to create such a huge impact!” Chen Xiang said with an astonishment. Under normal circumstances, he would at most shatter the rock with that amount of True Qi, not able to shatter it into dust.

“If I learn to the tenth level, I could definitely defeat Zhong Quan!” Chen Xiang said with excitement and continued practicing. After he familiarized himself with the first level, he would be able to learn the second level.

If others were to find out, they would definitely look at him like a monster, because many people had been learning for a long time, or even a few years, but he could already make the first sound with his Demon Subduing Force in just a few hours, and there would be ten rings if he reached the tenth level!

A day had passed. Chen Xiang’s palms danced wildly as thunderous explosions rang out. He was now able to instantly release his Demon Subduing Force, but only of the first level!

“Brother...Which cave are you in?”

“Dear Xiang, quickly come out!”

Suddenly, Leng Youlan and Xue Xianxian’s voice came from outside. Chen Xiang hurriedly walked out of the stone room and came to the entrance of the cave. He shouted down, “I’m here. Don’t worry about me. I’ll be able to leave in a month!”

Seeing Chen Xiang being locked in such a cave, Leng Youlan was filled with rage, “brother, I’ll go chop that bastard Lu Xiong into pieces. How could him make you be locked here! And Zhong Quan as well, I’ve always wanted to kill him.”

After Leng Youlan and the Xue Xianxian found out that Chen Xiang had been locked up, they immediately inquired about the situation. After they found out what had happened, they were infuriated. It was very clearly that Chen Xiang was set up by Liao Shaoyun with his private power.

“Xianxian, look after her. Don’t let her mess around. I can solve this myself!” Chen Xiang lightly said. Xue Xianxian sighed and nodded.

Seeing Chen Xiang so confident, Xue Xianxian didn’t say anything more.

"Don’t worry, I’ll keep an eye on her. Are you used to live in this place?” Xue Xianxian asked.

“It’s nothing. I’ve stayed in places worse than this, and it’s even been a year or two.” Chen Xiang smiled. The time he spent with Huang Jintian was something he would never be able to forget for the rest of his life.

“After you guys go back, you need to learn the Demon Subduing Force consciously. I believe you guys should be able to learn the first level very soon.” Chen Xiang enjoined. He had already master the first level and knew how powerful it was.

Leng Youlan snorted and said, “brother, after you come out, do you want to find Zhong Quan by yourself? If you cooperate with me, we’ll definitely be able to get rid of him with ease!”

"Youlan, listen up. Later on, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to fight alongside your brother. Right now, you have to learn those martial arts well. At the time of the Great War of the Three Realms, I will kill all the demons and goblins with you.” Chen Xiang comforted her.

Leng Youlan nodded, then she asked Chen Xiang a few more questions with concern, and left with Xue Xianxian.

If it wasn’t for Xue Xianxian’s accompany, Leng Youlan would have already gone to find Zhong Quan. Therefore, Chen Xiang was completely at ease.

"Now, I am going to learn the second level! I must learn to the tenth level within a month. " Currently, Chen Xiang was also looking forward to the strength of the tenth level. He was already impatient to see just how powerful the tenth level Demon Subduing Force would be.

Even though Chen Xiang was locked up, he was able to heavily injure and stun a person on the Demon Subduing Board. Such kind of valiant strength gave people goosebumps because Chen Xiang was a person who had just entered the Extreme Realm.

Of course, Zhong Quan’s strength was the most amazing. He was only 17 years old, but he was already called the world’s number one young martial expert!
