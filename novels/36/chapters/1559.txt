He looked at Lv Qilian, and his expression became serious: "Then what do we do? If you don’t leave my Divine Sense Sea, I won’t be in the mood to do my thing, and I will even delay you."

"Think of it slowly, but I can’t do it that way." Lv Qilian’s attitude was extremely firm. Even though it was only a union of the soul, she definitely could not tolerate it, even though she did not hate Chen Xiang very much.

Chen Xiang took a light breath, as if he had decided on something, and said to Lv Qilian: "Even if I can’t, I can’t tolerate you."

"If you want to be strong, come at me." Lv Qilian immediately jumped up and distanced himself from Chen Xiang: "Chen Xiang, there were some contradictions between you and I in the past, but didn’t we resolve it later on? Furthermore, we get along well now, I have long regarded you as my good friend and you are also my savior. In the future, I will continue to repay you."

When Lv Qilian said these words, it proved that she was terrified. She didn’t want her own soul to be violated by Chen Xiang.

"Forget it, then let’s just wait like this." Chen Xiang sighed, laid on the ground, and looked up at the sky.

Lv Qilian heaved a sigh of relief, she had almost been scared to death by Chen Xiang, because in here, she had no way of resisting.

"The Gods join method that you mentioned, can only be kissed, right?" After Lv Qilian asked this question, his face was slightly red.

"I think we can, let’s give it a try. Anyway, we’ve already truly kissed on the body." Chen Xiang suddenly became spirited, causing him to curse a few times in his heart.

Thinking back to that previous feeling, Lv Qilian still cherished it a little. This time, it was she who walked closer to Chen Xiang, whispering: "Only engaged ones, don’t act recklessly, don’t be so rough."

Having just finished speaking, Chen Xiang pulled her into his embrace. Looking at her beautiful face, he lightly touched it, then lowered his head and grabbed her sweet, fragrant lips.

The last time Lv Qilian had kissed her, she wasn’t as immature as before. Under Chen Xiang’s guidance, she became extremely proficient, her sweet tongue pandering to Chen Xiang’s teasing, as she wriggled her lips and sucked ...

After a while, Lv Qilian wanted to struggle free, because Chen Xiang was not training at all, but taking advantage of her. What made her afraid was, she did not know why, but she had that desire.

"We can’t continue." Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lv Qilian suddenly felt his body heating up. It was the same for Chen Xiang, it was a little hotter than her.

"Brat, let me go." Lv Qilian’s clothes had already disappeared. Under the control of Chen Xiang’s mind, her soul turned into the original state.

"It’s over."

Lv Qilian felt her body being petted greedily by Chen Xiang and knew that Chen Xiang had already fallen into the abyss of evil desire. She did not know why, but her heart was also filled with desire and she suspected that it was because she was in Chen Xiang’s Divine Sense Sea and was affected by Chen Xiang’s strong evil will.

"I’ll kill you." Lv Qilian clenched his teeth and said, then cried out in pain, although it was his soul, but the feeling was extremely real.

Chen Xiang and Lv Qilian laid on the beach, entangled together. The waves that kept on crashing into her body gradually weakened, their souls merged with each other and in a very wonderful state, their minds were relaxed, causing the two of them to sink into the sea.

Chen Xiang started to revolve the Gods join method, because in this state, it was best to do so.

Ten days passed just like that, but Chen Xiang and Lv Qilian felt like two hours had passed. That kind of wonderful feeling made them forget about time.

Chen Xiang looked at the dried up Divine Sense Sea, covered his head and said. "I never thought that I would lose so much divine power in one go."

Divine Sense Sea had become very shallow, and at first glance, he could see a dry, cracked ground. The blue sky had already been covered by a layer of filth, and the mountain peaks on the island were originally green, but now they were completely barren.

Lv Qilian’s face was rosy, her entire body was filled with spirit energy and surrounded by holy light. At this moment, she could release her clothes by herself, and she was no longer under the control of Chen Xiang’s divine will. She did not expect the Gods join method to be so powerful.

"Your foundation has not wavered. You just need to absorb some Saint Force and you will be fine." At this moment, her relationship with Chen Xiang had become very subtle.

Chen Xiang chuckled: "You should be able to leave now, right?"

Lv Qilian nodded, her current appearance was as though something had never happened between her and Chen Xiang. After that, she turned into a ray of white light and disappeared within Chen Xiang’s Divine Sense Sea.

Inside the valley, the water flowed, birds cried, and the fragrance of flowers wafted. Lv Qilian finally came out from Chen Xiang’s Divine Sense Sea.

Looking at the real world, she couldn’t help but think of the illusory world inside Chen Xiang’s Divine Sense Sea. However, the things that happened inside were incomparably real, especially the bone-eating infatuation she had with Chen Xiang when she was at the seaside, which made her feel like she was experiencing it firsthand.

"Didn’t you say to kill me?" Chen Xiang said smilingly when he saw the intoxicated red on Lv Qilian’s face, as if he had seen through her thoughts.

"Hmph." Lv Qilian said crisply, then took out a Stage Four Immortal Yuxian Dan: "Quickly eat it, you are extremely weak right now."

Chen Xiang laughed and opened his mouth, indicating that Lv Qilian should feed him.

"Damned brat, I truly want to kill you." Lv Qilian cursed as she placed the Yuxian Dan into his mouth.

"As expected of the Hundred Flowers Emperor, he was almost squeezed dry by you." Chen Xiang swallowed the pellet, smiled, and said: "You probably can’t bear to kill me now, right? Let’s do it a few more times, with your cultivation speed, your soul will quickly catch up to mine."

Lv Qilian turned his head, turned his face towards Chen Xiang, and said faintly: "Is this really no harm to you?" That kind of increasing speed made Lv Qilian worry for Chen Xiang.

"No, if our souls are equal, then it will be beneficial to both of us, and we will need to train with the two souls to be able to unleash the Gods join method, if one side has too much of a difference, the stronger side will quickly help him make up for it." Back then, after Long Xueyi had cultivated with him a few times, Long Xueyi would occasionally look for him.

Lv Qilian did not say much.

"Let’s go back." She brought Chen Xiang up to a Transmission array, then activated it and returned to the secret room in Hundreds of Flowers Palace.

After Chen Xiang ate that piece of Yuxian Dan, the Divine Sense Sea seemed to have gotten better and became more spirited.

"You’re in a hurry to get back. You need my help." Lv Qilian asked.

"No need, your Hundreds of Flowers Palace better not be involved in this matter too much. I don’t want you and your Ten Heavens Supreme Lord to be targeted by some powerful people." Chen Xiang caressed her face and laughed: "I can handle my own matters."

Lv Qilian slapped his hand away and said in a low voice: "Then when you use poison, you should be careful. Right now, the Sky Region are already involved.
