Chen Xiang’s Red fire dragon also did not look like an ordinary Fire Dragon, because it had wings, thick dragon scales, and huge claws, making it look even more mighty and tyrannical. It was only because Chen Xiang’s cultivation was not enough, if Chen Xiang were to increase in cultivation, the Red fire dragon he released would definitely be much stronger than the World Defying holy dragon. Access:.

"I had a fortuitous encounter in the past and obtained a mysterious thing that could turn my World Defying Green dragon into a Red fire dragon." Chen Xiang said: "Anyway, releasing the Red fire dragon would consume a lot of energy."

"That’s true. After all, that thing is very strong!" When Qin Shuang thought about Red fire dragon s at this time, he still felt extremely shocked.

"I’ll try and see if I can merge the Berserk Sword Soul into my sword first." Chen Xiang said: "I want to enter the Time Domain.

Qin Shuang nodded his head: "If you use it successfully, your strength will definitely become even stronger."

Chen Xiang entered the You Yao Mountain Villa and released the Time Domain to envelop him within. He then began to follow Qin Shuang’s instructions and used the Berserker Sword Soul to release its power to refine the Heavenly magic sword.

When Chen Xiang’s Berserker Sword Soul saw the Heavenly magic sword, it felt extremely excited and excited, as if it was a little spirit. It happily went around the Heavenly magic sword in a circle, and at the same time, absorbed a large amount of Chen Xiang’s World Defying Stage Fierce Power, and then released a unique energy that poured into the Heavenly magic sword. Top

The time needed to refine it was very long. Only after successfully refining it, the Berserk Sword Soul would be able to fuse with the Heavenly magic sword, and when Chen Xiang uses the Heavenly magic sword again, he would be able to become even stronger.

It had taken Chen Xiang several years to complete the refinement process. Fortunately, he had used the second stage of Time Domain, so he was able to save a lot of time while it only lasted for two or three days outside.

"Success?" Qin Shuang was surprised to see Chen Xiang coming out so quickly, even though she already knew that Chen Xiang had used the power of time.

"Yes!" Chen Xiang held the Heavenly magic sword in his hand and laughed: "Do you feel any changes?"

Qin Shuang had fought with Chen Xiang before, so she shook her head: "I don’t feel anything, but have you really succeeded? No, you haven’t even released your power yet! " Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"That’s true!" Chen Xiang took a deep breath, and then activated the Frenzy sword method. The Heavenly magic sword suddenly trembled, and a wave of berserk Qi gushed out, causing Qin Shuang to hurriedly retreat.

"So powerful!" Qin Shuang shouted in shock: "Enough, don’t disturb the World Defying holy dragon!"

Chen Xiang immediately stopped, he did not feel anything from Qin Shuang’s expression, he knew that after the Berserker Sword Soul merged with the Heavenly magic sword, it would allow him to become even more powerful when he used his sword techniques.

"Next, I’ll slowly let the Raging Dragon Soul merge with the World Defying Green dragon." Chen Xiang felt that it was not too hard, and now he realised that the arrogant dragon soul had already entered into the World Defying Green dragon’s body and was fusing with the World Defying Green dragon, it was only a matter of time.

"In the future, you should keep a low profile. Don’t act so easily, don’t expose your own strength." Qin Shuang said: "Once your Raging Sword Soul and Raging Dragon Soul are exposed, it will definitely cause others to be shocked and it will also be very easy for those old fellows to see through it."

"I know, I’m just a pill refiner, fighting is just my side occupation." Chen Xiang laughed, "Actually, I’m more proficient at using other methods."

Qin Shuang only wished for Chen Xiang to become stronger quickly so that she wouldn’t feel too pressured.

"We need to wait for World Defying holy dragon to wake up before we can leave this place." Qin Shuang said: "It’s impossible for us to leave this place!"

"Not necessarily." Chen Xiang laughed: "Once I release the World Defying Green dragon, I can fly out."

"That won’t do, your World Defying Green dragon are not as strong as the World Defying holy dragon, if you encounter a sudden situation, it will be troublesome." Qin Shuang said: "Look at your Six Realms mirrors, it has been burnt and deformed by the blood and fire inside."

Chen Xiang took out the Six Realms mirrors and looked at it, then curled his lips: "These flames are really too evil!"

Actually, Chen Xiang really wanted to go inside to search for the Tao-creation Holy stone, because the Tao-creation Holy stone was not afraid of the flames here.

"Your grandfather is a Super Yang Old Ancestor, he definitely has a way to withstand the flames here. Didn’t he tell you?" Chen Xiang asked.

"This... They didn’t tell me, but there’s a place where they should be hiding some sort of secret scripture to defend against the flames here. " Qin Shuang shook his head: "I just heard him say that he would enter here and use the flames here to refine Crystal emperor."

"Where is the secret manual hidden?" Let’s go find them! " Chen Xiang said: "There are Tao-creation’s Holy stone and Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals inside the Blood Wind Fire Sea. We have to look around here. If we add a little of the Tao-creation’s Holy stone into our divine equipment, that would be great! "

"The secret scripture is in the Purple Yang Divine Palace ... It’s not a good time to go to Purple Yang Divine Palace now. " Qin Shuang shook his head: "The Purple Yang Divine Palace is inside the Heaven Old Super Realm, and you can’t go there now!"

"Who said I can’t? Don’t I have two World Defying Stage Fierce Fighting Soul s? And I still have the World Defying beast. I can go back. " Chen Xiang suddenly remembered that when Qin Shuang said that he could not go back for the time being, it was because his strength was not sufficient.

Qin Shuang was previously at the middle stage of the World Defying crazy realm, and she also had two World Defying Stage Fierce Fighting Soul s, but she could return to Heaven Old Super Realm from here.

"I can give it a try!" Qin Shuang also wanted to find the Tao-creation’s Holy stone here, so she could only go back to Heaven Old Super Realm. Moreover, she also wanted to go back to Purple Yang Divine Palace.

They had to wait for the World Defying holy dragon to wake up, and they didn’t know how long it would take, so Chen Xiang entered the Time Domain, allowing the Raging Dragon Soul and World Defying Green dragon to fuse.

What he did not expect was that after the Raging Dragon Soul had fused with the World Defying Green dragon, an earth-shattering roar had burst out from inside the sword, and it was also because of this roar that the sleeping World Defying holy dragon had been awakened!

The awakened World Defying holy dragon immediately flew high into the sky, and then shouted with a voice like thunder: "Chen Xiang, did you let your World Defying Green dragon fuse with the Raging Dragon Soul?"

"Yes... How do you know that? " Chen Xiang was also surprised by the roar that suddenly came out just now.

"I can feel that the World Defying Green dragon in your body is getting stronger. I hope that you can control it in the future!" The World Defying holy dragon said: "Otherwise, you will be in great danger."

"What do you mean?" Chen Xiang’s heart jumped as he asked.

"If the World Defying Green dragon in your body is so much stronger than you and is able to continuously grow stronger, if your strength greatly surpasses yours, then it is very possible that it will break out of your control." The World Defying holy dragon said: "You don’t have to worry too much. As long as there’s nothing wrong with you, the difference in strength between you and the World Defying Green dragon will not be too big."

Chen Xiang heaved a sigh of relief.

"However, something like this has happened before. How did the few World Defying beast I met get rid of their masters?" His words caused Chen Xiang to worry. He thought that the World Defying holy dragon was just scaring him, but to think that such a thing would actually happen.
