This time, Chen Xiang completed a round of cultivation for himself. Previously, it was Ji Xingyuan who brought him here, but now he can come here by himself.

Ji Xingyuan had already went towards the cave to investigate and see if there were any fewer people there. Chen Xiang had asked him a few times, he knew that Chen Xiang was anxious, so he decided to quickly bring Chen Xiang there.

After Chen Xiang finished cultivating for a round, he did not see Ji Xingyuan, nor did he know how to contact him. Under such circumstances, he could only go to the dark regions by himself to hunt Dark beast.

This time, he came by himself, he already had many of those stones. Previously, by killing that huge bear, he was able to obtain a lot of Dark beast blood, and after soaking a lot of normal stones in Dark beast blood, he would be able to turn the stone into a green stone.

"Not bad, I can control a hundred of them!" After Chen Xiang completed a very long round of cultivation, the cultivation level of Pathless Origin also increased by a lot. Controlling this stone required a certain amount of cultivation, and now that he was able to control so many Li, it proved that he had improved a lot.

He controlled the rocks to investigate the dark area, as it would allow him to find the Dark beast.

He didn’t dare to enter the depths by himself, and could only wander around outside.

As long as it was a small-scale Dark beast, its strength would not be very strong, and he could easily deal with it himself.

After entering for a few days, he had hunted several wild boars.

"They’re all big wild boars, it’s about time, take it back and eat it." Chen Xiang left the dark area and quickly returned to Ji Xingyuan’s little house by the river.

Ji Xingyuan still had not returned. He could only slaughter the wild boar and roast it himself, before continuing with his cultivation.

In about ten days, he had completed another round of cultivation. He could clearly feel that his body had improved greatly, and he was no longer as weak as when he first entered.

"It’s only been a little more than a month, but I already have such an obvious improvement!" Chen Xiang still couldn’t believe it, he didn’t know what was going on either, he didn’t consume any pills, he just cultivated according to Ji Xingyuan’s instructions, and progressed so quickly.

When he returned to the small house, he saw that Ji Xingyuan was back.

"Uncle, I think I’m a lot stronger than before, don’t you think?" Chen Xiang still could not believe his own improvement. After seeing Ji Xingyuan, he immediately asked.

Ji Xingyuan pinched Chen Xiang’s shoulder, and laughed: "Not bad ... Although my cultivation is difficult, the effect is very significant! "You have never cultivated the immoral path before, so it is not strange that you can improve so quickly."

"Uncle, is there any news about that cave?" Chen Xiang asked.

"I’ve arrived. There are fewer people, but there are still some." Ji Xingyuan said: "If you are anxious, you can go take a look now!"

"Alright, let’s go take a look now!" Chen Xiang wanted to see if there was anything hidden in the cave.

Ji Xingyuan brought Chen Xiang on a journey. It was a long distance away, no wonder Ji Xingyuan had been there for so long.

"Let me tell you in advance, that cave is not easy to enter. You might not be able to enter, so don’t count on too much." Ji Xingyuan brought Chen Xiang and ran for a few days, until they reached the top of a tall mountain, looking at the swamp, and then after going through it, they reached a forest, in which there were a few hundred meters large short mountains, and the cave was right inside.

"Un, I understand!" Chen Xiang felt that he should have a way to go in, he had a better understanding of Half-ghost Old Man’s methods.

After Ji Xingyuan brought Chen Xiang through the swamp, they entered the forest.

"What a terrifying aura!" Chen Xiang was immediately shocked when he entered the forest, it could be said that all the strong warriors had gathered here, all of them were strong warriors like Ji Xingyuan, and these strong warriors did not know how to keep a low profile, letting their own Qi leak out, it was obvious that they were trying to scare people.

"Yes, it’s still alright for you to come now. If you had come here a while ago, you would have known how terrifying it truly is. There are only a few people left now." Ji Xingyuan patted Chen Xiang’s shoulders: "But you don’t have to worry, as long as you don’t provoke them, they won’t do anything."

Chen Xiang nodded and followed Ji Xingyuan as she carefully made her way through the forest.

Ji Xingyuan had also become extremely cautious. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

"Uncle, are all the people here here for that cave?" Chen Xiang asked softly, he never thought that the cave left behind by the Half-ghost Old Man would attract so many experts.

Yes, Old Wang is still a legendary being, after all. He only came to the No Tao Place for a short period of time, and was able to cultivate a power that surpasses the Myriad Tao. Many experts here are unable to breakthrough, so they are extremely curious about the secret inside the cave. Ji Xingyuan said, "Currently, those fellows who are stuck in a dead end are people who are unable to break through no matter how hard they try. The cave cave left behind by Old Wang is also their only hope, although it’s extremely slim."

As Ji Xingyuan said that, his expression suddenly changed, and he anxiously pulled Chen Xiang to hide behind a big tree.

"Someone’s coming. I don’t want to run into them." Ji Xingyuan said to Chen Xiang in a low voice.

Chen Xiang did not sense anyone, but Ji Xingyuan knew that this made him feel that if he had come here himself, then it would be extremely dangerous. Even though he could not use his divine sense or the Space Domain, he felt that he was blind and could not discover anything.

"Ji Xingyuan, I know you’re here. Come out." The voice of one of the elders contained a trace of ridicule, "You are the same as before, you have not improved at all!"

When Ji Xingyuan was discovered, he could only sigh helplessly and brought Chen Xiang out.

"Everyone is the same." Ji Xingyuan looked at the old man: "You still have the nerve to laugh at me, didn’t you also stagnate your cultivation for many years? You’ve been stuck for years. "

The old man wore a light green robe and he looked a little sloppy. His hair was a mess, but his eyes were very bright. He was a very energetic old man.

"Who is this kid?" The old man focused his attention on Chen Xiang, because Chen Xiang was looking at him earlier.

"My friend." Ji Xingyuan said: "You are still quite low-key, you did not emit any Qi, I almost did not sense you."

"You too... This friend of yours is a little weak! Would a guy like you be willing to make friends like that? " The green robed elder arrived behind Chen Xiang in the blink of an eye, scaring Chen Xiang to the point that he was covered in cold sweat.

Ji Xingyuan laughed, "At first, Old Wang was also very weak, but what happened next? So don’t underestimate anyone. "

The green robed elder laughed, "You said that this little demon will be like Old Wang? I think that’s impossible. Old Wang is the one and only guy, there’s no second one. "

Ji Xingyuan did not speak further, and said: "Did you reap anything this time?"

The green robed old man saw that Chen Xiang was so weak, he did not care anymore and shook his head: "If I had any gains, would I bullsh * t with you here? What are you doing here this time? Don’t you know those guys are still here? "
