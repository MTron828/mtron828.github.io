When the First Beast-creation Ancestor saw that Chen Xiang and the rest were prepared to go up, and even used a sealing method, he said: "You won’t be able to use the Sealing Imprint Method! None of these beasts will be affected by the seal, and it’s not like they won’t be able to kill them. If you use your power and instantly kill them all, they won’t be able to regenerate if you don’t leave any blood on them. "Crap."

Chen Xiang and the others had also noticed just now, that the body of the First Beast-creation Ancestor that was injured had regenerated from its flesh wounds. If it could really release a strong power and instantly kill those ferocious beasts until nothing was left, then there would not be a situation of regeneration.

"I’ll take the wolves!" Chen Xiang said that he had three clones and the power of Red fire dragon. It was more suitable for him to fight this kind of beast.

"Alright, leave the rest to us!" Jing Yun’er said.

"I’ll go up and challenge the wolves first."

When Chen Xiang approached the altar, he controlled the Heavenly magic sword to fly over and cut a black evil wolf in half. The evil wolf, after being cut in half, did not die, only seeing the evil wolf nibbling at the latter half of its body, which quickly grew into the latter half, completely fine.

The evil wolf was very angry, it howled towards the sky and rushed forward bringing its wolf pack with it. They had seen Chen Xiang and Jing Yun’er earlier, but they did not care because Chen Xiang and the others were not here, and as long as it did not affect them, they were too lazy to go over.

The dozens of evil wolves were as strong as cows, and their strength was as strong as the Killing Evil Tiger that Chen Xiang had met outside.

When the pack of wolves rushed over, the sound was extremely loud, the evil aura that soared to the sky covered Chen Xiang like a gigantic invisible claw that grabbed him.

"These beasts are pretty strong!" Chen Xiang immediately summoned his two clones, and the two clones used the power of Red fire dragon s, and rushed up together.

The fists of Chen Xiang and the two clones were like a mighty dragon head that was burning with flames. The moment the scorching hot aura of the flames appeared, it slowed down the wolves that were charging over, as if they were afraid of the strength of the Red fire dragon.

When the First Beast-creation Ancestor sensed Chen Xiang’s Red fire dragon’s aura, his brows furrowed tightly and surprise filled his eyes. He seemed to be extremely interested in Chen Xiang’s Red fire dragon.

Chen Xiang and his two doppelgangers ran into the pack of wolves as both of their fists struck out fiercely. Each of their punches contained hundreds of violent Red fire dragon punches, and the heaven shaking dragon’s roar rang out continuously as they struck the body of the giant wolf. Scarlet flames burned out and in just a few moments, Chen Xiang’s domain was like a purgatory of hell, filled with the wails of wolves.

RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU...!

Chen Xiang’s Red fire dragon punches carried the power of the Pressure mantra, and with every punch, it gave off a strong pressure. The strength of his punches was like the descent of a mountain of the same level, and it even brought about a strong flame. In an instant, hundreds of punches landed on the body of an evil wolf, and under such strong fire pressure, the evil wolf was instantly killed into ashes.

Chen Xiang locked the pack of wolves into his Pressure Field, preventing them from running out. He rotated his fists with his two clones and violently punched the giant wolves that were brimming with an evil aura.

Jing Yun’er and Han Xiaoying also rushed to the altar, the two of them working together to fight against a black panther. Jing Yun’er herself had cultivated and killed the Evil Phoenix, so using the terrifying power of killing the Evil Phoenix would make her stronger. And the Ice Creation Sacred Body that Han Xiaoying possessed also gave her a very strong power.

When Han Xiaoying was rushing over, she sealed the black leopard in ice. Jing Yun’er merged with her body and flapped her black phoenix wings, immediately flying over, her black phoenix wings suddenly became big, and slapped down towards the black leopard that had been turned into an ice sculpture. She slapped the black leopard until it turned into ice crystals, and the evil aura she brought smashed onto the ground causing the earth to become as turbulent as the sea’s surface.

"Let’s continue!" Jing Yun’er shouted, before continuing to attack the horde of beasts with Han Xiaoying.

Chen Xiang’s side had already finished their battle, and the group of evil wolves had turned into black dust that was blown away by the fierce battle.

The altar was like a bottomless pit, with endless Evil beast s inside. Just as he killed the pack of evil wolves, another group of giant black crocodiles appeared, and all sorts of Evil beast seemed to be awakened by the noise outside, running out from a door behind the altar.

Chen Xiang and the others were extremely shocked. After all these years, the First Beast-creation Ancestor’s body had actually fed them with so many powerful Evil beast!

"Although these Evil beast are strong, they don’t have much intelligence. It’s easy to deal with them. I just don’t know if there will be any stronger Evil beast." The Killing Evil Tiger that Chen Xiang had met before could transform into a human, but compared to these Evil beast, he was much stronger.

Chen Xiang and his two clones used Red fire dragon punches, continuously attacking the incoming Evil beast s. The explosive fist roared furiously, releasing waves of dragon roars, sweeping past everything, and as long as they were struck, they would immediately turn into black smoke.

In just a short moment, a black mist floated out from the surroundings. Those Evil beast were all killed by Chen Xiang, but Jing Yun’er and Jing Yun’er were working together, Han Xiaoying was in charge of sealing the Evil beast, and Jing Yun’er used his pair of wings that contained a terrifying evil aura to slap the frozen Evil beast into ice crystals.

Less than an hour later, the sky and earth were filled with black mist, all of them were the ashes of Evil beast s killed by Chen Xiang, and Chen Xiang and the rest had already reached the bottom of the altar.

"You guys are amazing!" First Beast-creation Ancestor couldn’t help but exclaim in admiration. He thought that Chen Xiang and the others would be pushed back by the Evil beast.

"Next?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Come up, there are nine holes around here. These nine holes will form a circle around me, and as long as you insert the Chuangyuan key into those holes, you can leave the rest to me." The First Beast-creation Ancestor said.

"Alright!"

Chen Xiang immediately went to the top of the altar, and just as he was taking a few steps, First Beast-creation Ancestor’s face suddenly changed.

"Stop!" He was the type to be extremely calm before this, but now that there was such an abnormal change, Chen Xiang and the others were extremely shocked.

"What’s wrong?" Jing Yun’er asked.

"I can sense a weak spatial ripple. Someone is coming." First Beast-creation Ancestor shouted anxiously, "Leave quickly!"

First Beast-creation Ancestor’s face was currently filled with seriousness, he shouted at Chen Xiang and the others with a stern voice: "Hurry and go, if you’re any slower, it’ll be too late!"

Seeing the First Beast-creation Ancestor’s expression, Chen Xiang did not say anything further and turned to leave with Jing Yun’er and the others. But at this time, the space suddenly trembled, and a ray of light shot out from the void, landing in front of Chen Xiang and the others, stimulating a strong wave of energy that sent them flying.

"Don’t even think about leaving!" They saw a young man in glittering golden armor holding a folding fan. He waved it in the air, and a golden barrier of light appeared, covering the surrounding area.
