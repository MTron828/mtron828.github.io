Translated and edited by:Ash

Chen Xiang still continue to practice at night, he took out four Baptizing marrow dan and swallowed them all together, while simultaneously operating Tai chi divine exercise to digest their potency, at the break of dawn he left for Danxiang herbal manor to buy another twenty sets of Astral spirit dan’s herbs.

Chen Xiang basically used up all his spirit coins after buying the spirit herbs, he had already previously invested most of his spirit coins in the store so he was short on spirit coins, but as soon as Dan king hall starts doing business, he will earn all his spending’s along with a hefty profit.

During the day, Chen Xiang stayed in his room and refined Aura Qi dan, for him refining have been too easy now, moreover each time six pills are being congealed out, in just half an hour he refined two sets of herbs, five hour he had already refined all twenty sets of herbs that he had previously bought, a grand total of one hundred twenty pills!If just selling them at the minimum market price of five thousand spirit coins, he would earn six hundred thousand spirit coins, but he spent only hundred thousand spirit coins to purchase those herbs, even a fool can see, how profitable refining pills is.

Meng Bo didn’t know about the furnace that it was possible for it to recognize master after bleeding on it, so he wasn’t able to utilise the true power of Flame dragon brilliant furnace, if he would have known, Chen Xiang wouldn’t even be able have a look at it, thinking about this he felt slightly guilty, therefore he quietly gave one Metal spirit fruit and a small piece of Hell spirit grass to Meng Bo, only after this did he felt relieved.

At night, Chen Xiang took some Aura Qi dans that he had previously refined and left for forest in outskirts of the city, in the forest he swallowed as many as ten pills in one deep breath, just like eating candies, if other came to know about it, they will be shocked till their jaws were touching the ground.

Chen Xiang operated the Tai Chi divine exercise and starts refining their potencies, gradually at some point a strange spirit Qi gushed out from the pills, he felt the trace of aura Qi being released from the Aura Qi dan.......

Every night Chen Xiang would unceasingly eat ten pills and cultivate his True Qi, while during the day practiced the Azure Dragon and Zhu Que divine exercise from Divine exercise of four symbols, as for White Tiger divine exercise, a special environment with dense slaughter Qi was required to practice, while Black Tortoise divine exercise required an environment full of water, moreover both of them required his strength to be above 9th level of mortal martial realm, so he kept them at the back of his mind.

In blink of an eye, only three days were left for the King city martial art tournament to start.

At night moonlight is shining and limitless stars are twinkling in the sky, while Chen Xiang as always was busy absorbing large amount of spirit Qi inside the forest, at the same time taking a few Aura Qi dans, these days he has already consumed a large amount of pills, this also made up for the insufficient spirit Qi present in the atmosphere.

A layer of white fog starts swirling around Chen Xiang’s body, emitting a kind of strange energy, any leaves around him instantly transforms into tiny particles as they grazed this white fog.

This white fog is none other than the’Aura Qi’, only now did he grasped the essentials to transform his true Qi into aura, but in turn he has to spend a large amount of true Qi, only someone with vigorous true Qi will be able to continuously attack with’True aura’.

Early in the morning inside the forest, a bare chested robust teenager with just his fist blasted a boulder into pieces, wind whirred around his fists, waves of Qi bursting out from him, any boulder they touch ceases to exist, ’Peng Peng Peng’, a sturdy stone wrapped around in his true aura broke into several pieces like a mud ball gradually falling apart.

"This is 7th level of mortal martial realm strength, now with just one thought I can transform my true Qi into true aura!"Chen Xiang clinched his fists, as he vigorously stamped his foot, all the broken stones on the ground suddenly split up, frightening aura Qi emanated from his body and immediately grinding them into powder.

Chen Xiang thought, his current strength compared to 6th level of mortal martial is much more formidable!But this level of power was still nothing in those big sects, only those with strength above 9th level of mortal martial can establish themselves in the sects, which is also why he is never arrogant, he knows no matter how good you thinks you are, there is always someone out there that is better.

Meng Bo, the dan king of Southern martial empire joined Dan king hall caused an uproar in the whole King city, immediately bolstering Dan king hall fame, despite not yet opened, many people are looking forward to it, every day store entrance will be crowded and many people unceasingly came to ask about the store’s grand opening.Of course, since Meng Bo joined Dan king hall, Yao family felt a tremendous pressure, because they feared Chen family’s Dan king hall catching up with their position in Southern martial empire.

Although Danxiang herbal manor sold pills, but compare to the herbs they still falls behind, as they are mainly in selling spirit herbs business, so Dan king hall had a little effect on them, moreover both parties have already established a co-operative relation.

After dressing up Chen Xiang started walking towards the King city, on his way he is thinking about the opening of Dan king hall.

While on his way, he suddenly noticed that there was something amiss, he felt someone was hiding inside the forest.

"Come out, no need to hide now!"Chen Xiang’s voice was extremely cold, full of killing intent, since he and Yao family are enemies, he has always been wary, he already knew sooner or later Yao family will send someone to assassinate him.

His voice just died down, a’Xiu’sound came, and Chen Xiang like a lightning bolt stretched his hand and caught an arrow shot towards him, and then quickly moved his body, with both flexibility and agility shuttling in the forest, only a flicker of him was visible.

Chen Xiang appeared near a tree and operated his aura Qi, ’Boom’, his fist struck a tree and blasted it into smithereens, and immediately after a scream came from behind the tree, whoever was hiding behind the tree, had already been killed by the explosion from Chen Xiang’s overbearing fist strength.

Chen Xiang’s brow wrinkled, he is able to sense all the changes happening around him, after entering into 7th level of mortal martial realm his divine sense has been more acute, at this moment he clearly felt numerous arrows raining towards him.

Suddenly from his palm an azure aura Qi surge out and formed a wall of aura in front of him, that rainstorm like arrows were entirely shunned by this aura wall.

"Three hundred arrows, three hundred individuals!It seems you cannot wait to kill me!"Chen Xiang whole face turned cold, a monstrous killing intent surge in his heart.

"Since you want to kill me, then do not blame me."As his sound transmitted, a wave of slaughter Qi like a cold wind swept around the whole forest.

White tiger is a god of slaughtering, after practicing White tiger divine exercise the practitioner will have a very strong slaughter Qi, which is capable of deterring the opposite party, while simultaneously enhancing their own strength, now Chen Xiang cast out most basic of White tiger divine exercise-----’Slaughtering heart’, unless he comprehends this exercise well, he will never be able to practice other martial skills of White tiger divine exercise, this’Slaughtering heart’exercise is also the best and quickest way of slaughtering!

Chen Xiang released his formidable divine sense, and quickly arrived near a big tree, and he sensed many people hiding in there, although they hid well but they were still discovered by Chen Xiang.

"Humph, you think with quantity you will be able to kill me!”Chen Xiang coldly spoke, body like mirage, leaped up in the forest, he was simply too quick, it was impossible to get a hold of his location by the archers hiding inside the tree, even if they occasionally hit him, it was always blocked by the aura Qi covering his body.

Azure aura surge from Chen Xiang’s fist, while lightning was flashing above them, he jumped to a nearby tree, and struck towards the trunk of the tree.

Boom Boom Boom........

Azure lighting ran through the entire tree, as the trunk exploded into pieces, flame and lightning aura burst out from within, the treetop entirely charred like it was burnt by the flames, soon after six charred bodies gradually fell from above.
