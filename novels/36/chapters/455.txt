There was an arbor inside the herb garden. Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue were sitting here. They were drinking a sweet and fragrance tea as they wait for Li Baojun to come up with the method for competing.

Chen Xiang was caressing Hua Xiangyue’s straight and long hair, yet Hua Xiangyue didn’t object. She only used her charming eyes to look at him. In her eyes, Chen Xiang was a like a kid, but sometimes, he was very manly as well.

“Little Rascal, after I return, I will be going into a closed-door training for some time. If you are troubled with something in the future, you should go and look for Meng’er!” said Hua Xiangyue.

As Chen Xiang wanted to give Hua Xiangyue a few sets of Resurrection Dan herbs and a Fruit of Fortune, he asked, “How long are you going to train in seclusion? What should I do if I come across a serious matter and wanted to look for you?”

“Go straight to Danxiang Taoyuan and look for me in the restricted area directly. Only those who have my permission can enter it!” Hua Xiangyue took out a white pearl and handed it to Chen Xiang.

“When you reach there, take this pearl out and you will be able to enter safely! Also, after coming in, please don’t yell, I will know when someone comes in immediately,” Hua Xiangyue continued.

Chen Xiang nodded as he took that pearl and started playing with it.

“Senior Li, as the protector of this herb garden, you must have gotten many spirit herbs, right?” Chen Xiang shouted towards a nearby pond, where Li Baojun was sitting, ruminating.

Li Baojun answered, “Of course, I am familiar with many herbs. But I can only pick herbs after I have planted them first. However, most of these are low-level spirit herbs.”

“Kid, stop bothering me! Just adjust your state while you still have the time!”

Chen Xiang pursed his lips and continued to play with Hua Xiangyue’s silky black hair, for there was a sweet aroma coming from them.

“Sister Xiangyue, why do you smell so nice? Is it natural?” Chen Xiang broke into laughter and continued, “You blood also smelled very sweet.”

Hua Xiangyue gave a twist to Chen Xiang’s arm. “Don’t mention that matter again.”

Recalling the shameful scene of Chen Xiang lying on her chest, sucking her blood, her cheeks turned charming red as she looked at the mischievously smiling Chen Xiang.

“You truly smells so good, if I sleep while hugging you, I will get a sound sleep for good.” While Chen Xiang was making blind and disorderly conjectures, he got a knock on his head by Hua Xiangyue, once again.

Li Baojun didn’t look over. However, with both of them flirting around him, he was simply unable to calm himself down. What he found it incomprehensible was as to why a beautiful and charming girl like Hua Xiangyue was with a little rascal like Chen Xiang.

“Quiet down a bit, will you!” said Li Baojun.

“Thinking of just one method for so long, how boring!” Chen Xiang blurted out in a low voice. And this made Li Baojun feel disgusted by Chen Xiang secretly. He decided that he would not show mercy and teach Chen Xiang, this little rascal a ruthless lesson.

When Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue had waited for two or some hours, Li Baojun shouted aloud, “I have finished thinking, come here!”

When Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue had come over, Li Baojun continued, “Brat, since all you could refine is low-grade profound-level dans, I had to use every cell of my brain.”

“I have only come up with two methods. If after these two rounds, there is still a need for the third round, I will think of something again.”

Chen Xiang said in contempt, “After thinking for so long, you can only come up with two games?”

“It’s best two out of three games. If I won two games in a row, then, I will win. I won’t have to come up with the third game,” said Li Baojun.

“You are really good!” Chen Xiang was rendered speechless.

Li Baojun continued, “The concept of the game is not complicated, it’s very simple! The first round consists of refining a low-grade profound-level dan. We will see whose speed of refining and grade of dan refined is better. This will show us the alchemy level of an alchemist for a dan.

“We will compete in refining the Five Elements True Elemental Dan. I have a lot of its herbs here. Furthermore, it is comparatively difficult to refine dan among the low-grade profound-level dans! However, this is disadvantageous to you because I am a high-level alchemist. Therefore, it would be better for this girl to compete with me. Anyway, it for you to decide.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Li Baojun believed that competing with Chen Xiang would be an utmost insult to him. Noticing the disdainful look in Li Baojun’s eyes, Chen Xiang secretly swore that he would definitely beat this old man, who doesn’t know how high the sky is and how deep the earth goes, to the ground.

“I have forty set of Five Element True Elemental Dan’s herbs here, all of which will be placed here. The first round will continue until all the herbs are completely refined.

“We will use the forty set of herbs at the same time. That is to say, if you are slower than me, then, you will definitely get fewer herbs than me. In other words, if I am faster than you, I can refine thirty sets, thirty-five sets,” explained Li Baojun.

Upon hearing this, Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue were secretly laughing in their heart. As soon as they heard the rules of the first round, they knew their victory was set in stone. At the same time, they also came to despise Li Baojun. If it had been a competition between alchemists of the same level, it sure would have been extremely fair.

However, when it was a competition between a high-level alchemist and a low-level alchemist, the high-level alchemist had a huge advantage, for he was faster, and as such, he would be able to refine far more than the low-level alchemist.

Of course, Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue understood very clearly that Li Baojun was doing this so that he could compete with Hua Xiangyue.

“Do you any problem with this?” asked Li Baojun.

“Not at all!” Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue answered at the same time. If they had a problem, it would be even stranger. Had it been other low-level alchemist, he would lose for sure. However, Chen Xiang was different, even Hua Xiangyue believed that she herself wasn’t Chen Xiang’s match.

“What about the second round?” asked Hua Xiangyue.

“In the second round, we will refine three common low-grade profound-level dans. And we will judge from a comprehensive perspective, for instance, the grade of dans, the speed of refining, the number of dans refined. We, alchemists, can judge these points ourselves. At that time, we ourselves will know who is the winner and who is the loser,” Li Baojun said. “Do you have any problem with this?”

Chen Xiang and Hua Xiangyue shook their heads. In their heart, they were having a good laugh because Chen Xiang had a fair good chance of winning the two rounds.

“Old man, you lose!” said Chen Xiang in his heart.

Li Baojun immediately took out the forty sets of Five Elements True Elemental Dan herbs and placed them in a single basket. They were all placed randomly. If one wanted to take the herbs, he would have to pick them himself. More importantly, there were many herbs of poor quality as well.

“Now, we will pick a set from them, and then, begin refining at the same time! So, have you decided who is going to compete with me?” Li Baojun asked.

“I will!” said Chen Xiang.

Hearing this, Li Baojun’s brow was lined with deep frowns. He looked at Hua Xiangyue, only to see no objection coming from Hua Xiangyue, none at all.

“Sigh, it isn’t good for the younglings to be too competitive!” Li Baojun shook his head as he said, disappointed.

Chen Xiang very much wanted to say, “It isn’t good for the oldies to despise everyone.”

Very soon, Li Baojun and Chen Xiang began to pick herbs from the basket. First, they, both were picking all the good herbs. If they could refine faster, they could choose the better ones, leaving the bad herbs for the slower one.

After having picked their herbs, both of them began checking the alchemical furnace of the other.

“We can start now! Kid, you better give your best!” Li Baojun said, smiling disdainfully. He looked down on Chen Xiang very much.

Nonetheless, Chen Xiang didn’t take it seriously and began organizing the herbs.
