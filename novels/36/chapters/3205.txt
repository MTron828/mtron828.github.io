"Did the Heaven Old Orcs do something big?" Chen Xiang asked, and then found a collapsed stone chair to sit on in the damp mountain cave. Access:.

Chen Cai shook his head and sighed: "It’s not really a big movement, it’s just an internal movement ... They didn’t have the time to fight with humans right now, as a huge problem had arisen within them. You know what? The guy who came looking for me, is the Heaven Old Orc Emperor. "

Chen Xiang frowned: "The one who tried to kill me? I haven’t settled the score with him yet! "

"Besides this bastard, no one in the Heaven Old Orcs can make me look so ’miserable’." Chen Cai was very angry, "Not only does this guy want me to help him with the artifact forging, he also wants to control me so that when he needs me to, he can immediately let me do the artifact forging."

"Go, go destroy him!" Chen Xiang was very strong, he didn’t care about a mere Heaven Old Orc Emperor.

"Yo, you look so awesome." Chen Cai laughed. Of course he knew the grudge between Chen Xiang and the Heaven Old Orc Emperor.

"Of course. Do you know where I just came from?" Chen Xiang smiled mysteriously.

"Where?" Although Chen Cai asked, he seemed to have guessed something, "Could it be the Heaven Old Super Realm?!"

"This is the place." Chen Xiang laughed: "Let’s go find that guy and eliminate him. Then, I’ll bring you to the Heaven Old Super Realm."

Chen Cai was a talent, and was born with a good Inherent Skill. He had inherited the memories, and his cultivation was just a little lacking now. If he were to raise his cultivation, he would definitely become a powerful Refiner.

"Really? That’s great, I’m tired of staying in this damned place, I want to go to Heaven Old Super Realm. " Chen Cai was extremely agitated: "We don’t need to look for the Beast King right now, as long as I run out of this cave and release the aura on my body, he will know where I am and then immediately rush over."

"That’s great!" Chen Xiang said as he punched the mountain.

Chen Cai had only just stepped out and wanted to walk out of the cave, but he had already made his move.

"You don’t need to be so cocky in front of me when you become stronger, right?" Chen Cai laughed and scolded: "This mountain cave was set up by me with great difficulty. I’m afraid I have to stay behind as a souvenir or something like that.

Chen Cai had set up many enchantments in Shandong in order to avoid being tracked by the Heaven Old Orc Emperor, and now that it had been destroyed by Chen Xiang’s fist, his heart ached for her.

"Old dog, come and ’kill’ me!" Chen Cai roared, and released his Qi.

After Chen Cai shouted a few times, Chen Xiang sensed a familiar aura approaching. Back then, he had almost been killed by this Heaven Old Orc Emperor.

"I don’t know if he remembers me." Chen Xiang was now standing behind Chen Cai.

When Chen Cai saw that the Heaven Old Orc Emperor had arrived, he immediately ran to Chen Xiang’s back and whispered to him, "He’s already here.

Heaven Old Orc Emperor was an old man. When he saw Chen Xiang, he sneered: "No wonder you are so bold, so it turns out that you found a helper. You do have some power, but in the end, you would only be eaten by me.

Chen Xiang shook his head, because the Heaven Old Orc Emperor had already forgotten about him.

"Chen Cai, I suddenly don’t want to fight anymore." Chen Xiang said.

Chen Cai was startled, and was a little confused: "You’re not joking right? This guy is very dangerous!"

"If I kill this old dog, my hands will get dirty. How do you want me to wash them?" Chen Xiang laughed bitterly, as if he was in a difficult situation: "Even if he wanted me to kill him, I didn’t want to.

Chen Cai was stunned yet again. Heaven Old Orc Emperor was also stunned, this young man in front of him was actually this arrogant!

He had seen such an arrogant youth before, but those were all people from the Heaven Old Divine Race, and the person in front of him was just a human.

"Chen Cai, the human you found is only this strong, you are so arrogant." Heaven Old Orc Emperor laughed out loud. "You should just follow me back to the refining world."

Chen Cai did not care about him, and said to Chen Xiang: "Wouldn’t it be fine if you used your foot to kill him? "That way you won’t dirty your hands."

and Chen Xiang actually looked down on him that much, he was a dignified Heaven Old Orc Emperor!

Chen Xiang shook his head, then said to Heaven Old Orc Emperor: "You should kill yourself, this will be better for both you and me!"

When the Heaven Old Orc Emperor heard him, he immediately roared out, and grabbed towards Chen Xiang, and bellowed: "Human, don’t be so arrogant!"

When Chen Xiang saw him coming over, he stuck out his tongue and made a face at him. Meanwhile, Heaven Old Orc Emperor’s claws had already turned into a soft and furry beast claw, grabbing towards Chen Xiang’s head.

Chen Xiang saw that the beast was closing in, the Heavenly magic sword in his hand suddenly flew out, and quickly cut off the gigantic hand.

Heaven Old Orc Emperor and Chen Cai did not see Chen Xiang making his move, Chen Xiang also stood there motionlessly, suddenly flying out with a sword, very quickly cutting off Heaven Old Orc Emperor’s arm.

"Ahh ..." Heaven Old Orc Emperor took a few steps back as he looked at the smiling Chen Xiang.

The instant Chen Xiang attacked just now, he felt a trace of aura that caused him to feel extreme fear; that was the aura of the World Defying Stage Fierce Soul.

Those who possessed World Defying Stage Fierce Soul s, were all people who had stepped into it!

The Heaven Old Orc Emperor was currently only at the peak of the World Defying Stage. No matter how strong he was, it was impossible for him to defeat the World Defying crazy realm.

"How could a human from the World Defying crazy realm appear here!?" Ever since Heaven Old Orc Emperor came here, he had always looked down on humans. Humans were extremely weak in his eyes, and he could easily kill a large group of them.

But, the Chen Xiang in front of him, was actually this frightening?

The weak humans in his eyes were now so much stronger than him, he found it hard to accept.

"Why is it impossible? If a guy like you can claim supremacy here, then why can’t I come here?"

The World Defying Stage Fierce Power that was released by the World Defying Stage Fierce Soul was extremely terrifying. After being poured into the Heavenly magic sword and added with the fact that the Heavenly magic sword was refined by the Myriad Tao Divine Soil, it easily broke through the Heaven Old Orc Emperor’s armor and cut her body into several pieces.

"It was done just like that?" Chen Cai found it hard to believe, he took a deep breath and rushed forward, releasing a few balls of flame, and burned the corpse, then took the World Defying mad source bead.

"You don’t lack this, but I do." Chen Cai laughed, the enemy that was chasing him had been killed, and he would be able to quickly head to Heaven Old Super Realm soon, so he was currently in a great mood.
