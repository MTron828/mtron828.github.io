Now that he only had two pills, he gave these two pills to the Mei Jing Sisters. If they were to improve, the cultivation of World Defying heaven fruit would speed up even more in the future. During their cultivation, Chen Xiang and Feng Ke’er continued to refine World Defying heavenly Dan s together.

They needed more than two years to refine a single World Defying heavenly Dan, roughly thirty months. To the outside, only one month had passed.

"Xiao Ke’er, I want to try refining the World Defying heavenly Dan on my own." Chen Xiang said: "You only need to help me destroy the Spirit grain’s outer appearance."

"Alright!" Feng Ke’er nodded.

This was the first time Chen Xiang had refined a World Defying heavenly Dan by himself, and the process was extremely difficult. If he had teamed up with Feng Ke’er, he would only need thirty months to complete one pellet.

"Not bad. Without me being able to refine it, I thought you would be unable to do it by yourself." Feng Ke’er laughed.

"Right now, I have cultivated the Primordial Divine Body, alright? Refining it out is quite easy." Chen Xiang snorted, he just did not have Feng Ke’er’s powerful sealing power, he felt that if he were to use his own Six Realms mirrors, it would be able to increase his speed.

He took out another World Defying heaven fruit and was about to start refining it, when he suddenly felt a weak vibration.

Now, he was hiding in the depths of the earth, and these vibrations meant that the ground was shaking. I. Ben. Read. He might even be that kind of powerful Heaven Old Orcs.

"I wonder if the Heaven Old Orcs is fighting on top, I am a little worried that it will affect me." Chen Xiang looked up. At the moment, he was in a stone room, he had been here for a while, but there had never been such a commotion.

"Go up and take a look, you’ll see that your current strength is not weak, even if you meet a Heaven Old Orcs like last time, you can still run away." Feng Ke’er said.

"That’s true!" Chen Xiang kept his Tianchuang furnace and prepared to take a breather.

However, just as he was about to take action, his stone chamber violently shook. With a bang, something broke through the stone chamber’s wall and a person tumbled inside.

Chen Xiang never thought that someone would find her way to this place. Feng Ke’er felt that it was even more unbelievable, because she had used so many layers of sealing powers to hide this place. Logically, it was impossible for people to find this place.

"You ... "Who are you!" Chen Xiang anxiously asked, he had already summoned the Heavenly magic sword.

"Young man, calm down!" The man stood up, and anxiously patted the dust off his body, it was a middle-aged man who was dressed in reminiscence, with two whiskers on his face, his appearance was extremely ordinary, but his two whiskers were especially eye-catching, he saw Chen Xiang looking at his whiskers, he laughed and touched them.

"You are the Heaven Old Orcs!" felt the Qi on his body and shouted, as though he was facing a powerful enemy, the Heaven Old Orcs was extremely powerful, even though he had already cultivated the Primordial Divine Body, he still had to be extremely careful when facing against such a strong Heaven Old Orcs.

"You actually know our nickname?" The middle-aged man was also surprised, but he smiled and said, "Don’t be afraid of me, I am just an extremely weak Heaven Old Orcs."

"Really? But you can come here! " Chen Xiang did not believe his lies. He knew clearly about Feng Ke’er’s seal, the three layers of enchantments and the seals that surrounded the stone room, but he had still found it. Furthermore, he had even crawled in.

"Do you think I look strong?" The middle-aged man laughed: "My name is Chen Cai, you can just call me Ah Cai."

"Hey, I’m very familiar with you!" Chen Xiang saw the middle aged man laugh and try to get close to him, so when he was about to pat his shoulder, he quickly took a few steps back.

"I really have no ill intentions! I know that our Heaven Old Orcs has a bad reputation, but I am a good Heaven Old Orcs. Chen Cai laughed: "If I really had any ill intentions, I would have already hit you."

"You even said that you’re very weak, yet you can actually beat me." Chen Xiang scoffed, "I’m not very familiar with you, and I don’t want to get to know you. I don’t blame you for breaking this place. "

"So that’s how it is. I’ll help you settle it!" Chen Cai saw that the hole had been smashed open by him, and nodded his head. He waved his hand, releasing a burst of grey mist, and after the mist blocked the hole, he sucked in the stone soil that had fallen to the ground. In the blink of an eye, the hole was blocked by him.

"You ... I told you to leave this place. " Chen Xiang pointed his sword at Chen Cai.

"Young man, don’t be agitated ..." Your sword is so powerful, I think it has Myriad Tao Divine Soil painted on it, right? " Chen Cai looked carefully at the Heavenly magic sword in Chen Xiang’s hand and was suddenly shocked.

"Yes!" Chen Xiang nodded and said: "Quickly go, I am very worried about you staying here."

"It would be such a waste for a Myriad Tao Divine Soil like you to be smeared on it. If you let me control it, I can make your sword even more powerful." Chen Cai said: "What a waste of Myriad Tao Divine Soil!"

Chen Cai shook his head and sighed at the same time, as if his flesh was cut off.

When Feng Ke’er, who was in You Yao Mountain Villa, heard this, he immediately felt very unhappy, he ran out and snorted: "Who the hell are you with these two sideburns? Myriad Tao Divine Soil is just something I applied to my sword, isn’t that the best way to use it? Myriad Tao Divine Soil does not need to be smelted, adding on that his sword is already damaged, I am only applying it to repair it. "

"So it was you who did it, little girl. No wonder, no wonder ..." "You can forgive me." Chen Cai laughed, he wanted to reach out to pinch Feng Ke’er’s cute little face, but was slapped away by Feng Ke’er.

"I’m not very familiar with you, so don’t even think about pinching me." Feng Ke’er immediately hid behind Chen Xiang, and due to her anger, she quickly flapped her beautiful transparent wings.

"If it was you, what would you do?" Feng Ke’er only felt that the other party’s tone was a little inappropriate, but if this Chen Cai was truly strong in refining, she could still learn from him.

Chen Xiang still had not figured out his purpose for coming here!

"Why are you here? How did you find this place? " Chen Xiang asked.

"There’s a very strong Spirit grain’s aura here, I was born to be able to sense it, so I came here. I originally thought that there was some kind of treasure hidden here, but I didn’t expect to see you here after entering, you are also very brave, there are so many Heaven Old Orcs outside, you actually dare to hide here." Chen Cai laughed: "But don’t worry, even though I am a Heaven Old Orcs, I am a good Beastman."

Chen Xiang also did not know how strong this Chen Cai was, because he did not sense Chen Cai’s Qi, but he could sense that special feeling the other party had from the Heaven Old Orcs.

A violent vibration came over, causing Chen Xiang to frown: "Is the battle at the top?"
