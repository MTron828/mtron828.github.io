When Liu Meng’er came here, he had already guessed this matter.

"Yes, that guy stopped us and did not let us go. It’s even more baffling, if we don’t teach him a lesson, I wouldn’t be Dragon Subduing School anymore." Chen Xiang coldly snorted.

"My parents couldn’t come because they had something to do, so they asked me to come." Liu Meng’er looked at Mu Qianxiang. She knew that this matter had arisen because of Mu Qianxiang: "That Ding Xingyao has a very high position in the Sword Divine Palace. Even though he is normally a little overbearing, he won’t try to rob people in the streets.

Mu Qianxiang hesitated for a moment, and then, Liu Meng’er said again: "Little Sister Xiao Xiang, what are you worried about? Don’t you know about the matter between me and this little scoundrel?"

"Go ahead, but you have to keep this a secret for her, Elder Sister Meng’er." Chen Xiang said.

"Of course." Liu Meng’er nodded.

Then, Mu Qianxiang told her about the Heaven Pellet in her body, because when Ding Xingyao got close, she had that strange feeling.

"I never thought that you, little scoundrel, would actually go to one of the legendary Sacred Grounds in the Night Devil Hell." Liu Meng’er frowned slightly. He had already told her earlier that she had followed Chen Xiang out of the forbidden grounds.

"What is a Sword Soul?" Chen Xiang asked.

Over time, it will be condensed within the divine sword, and only those who are fated with the sword will be able to receive a sword soul. With a sword soul, it is equivalent to the Sword Emperor having a little bit of insight into the way of the sword, which is why he has made outstanding achievements in the way of the sword. "

"When Ding Xingyao was ten years old, he absorbed a strand of sword spirit, and now, he is already a hundred years old. He claims that no one under the Immortal Monarch is able to defeat him." Liu Meng’er explained.

"As for the Heaven Pill in your body, Xiao Xiang ... I’m not too sure, but when I came here with my parents, I heard from an elder in the Divine Sword Palace about the Sword Emperor. Back then, the Sword Emperor entered the Night Devil Hell with the Dan Emperor, but there was no news about it after that.

"Oh, that’s right. The Sword Emperor is a woman." Liu Meng’er added.

Back then, Chen Xiang was certain that the Heaven Pellet was not from the Dan Emperor. Now, it was actually from the Sword Emperor’s Heavenly Pellet, if that was the case, the Sword Emperor had already died.

"The Sword Emperor is dead." Chen Xiang was in disbelief.

"I don’t know. Perhaps that was an inheritance left behind by the Sword Emperor. It shouldn’t be too difficult for experts to accomplish that." Liu Meng’er held Mu Qianxiang’s hand and said solemnly: "Xiao Xiang, if that really is the Sword Emperor’s item, you must be careful in the future. The value of that item is no different than the divine blade that Little Scoundrel has."

"Elder Sister Meng’er, I want to go to Hundreds of Flowers Immortal Country. I heard that Flower Emperor is here, can you help me introduce her? You should know someone from Hundreds of Flowers Immortal Country." Mu Qianxiang said: "I need a safe place to activate the power of the Heaven Pellet, I feel that there are still many things hidden inside the Heaven Pellet waiting for me to explore."

Now, Chen Xiang understood why Mu Qianxiang said that he needed a good sword to display her power. The Heaven Pellet was indeed closely related to the Sword Emperor.

Liu Meng’er laughed lightly: "This little scoundrel has people inside the Hundreds of Flowers Immortal Country. It would be best if you went there."

"Who? How come I don’t know?" Chen Xiang thought about it and confirmed that he was not acquainted with anyone in Hundreds of Flowers Immortal Country.

"Xiangyue and Qianqian, the two of them are studying alchemy there. Your junior apprentice sister recommended it." Liu Meng’er rolled her eyes at him.

"Is it Hua Xiangyue and Wu Qianqian? Brother told me about them before ... ... Hua Xiangyue is his junior nephew, he was once in the same sect as him, and furthermore, he received Hua Xiangyue’s inheritance. " Seeing Liu Meng’er’s current expression, Mu Qianxiang suddenly understood something and looked at Chen Xiang with contempt.

"Could it be... "They too..." Mu Qianxiang said in a low voice.

"Xiangyue is his slave, Qianqian ... "I’m not too sure, but it should be hard for me to escape from this little scoundrel’s clutches. I saw Qianqian last time, she hasn’t been destroyed by this little scoundrel yet." Liu Meng’er looked at Chen Xiang and snorted lightly.

Liu Meng’er held Mu Qianxiang’s hand and said: "Let’s go, I will bring you to look for Hundreds of Flowers Immortal Country’s people. With your current talent, it will be easy for you to join Hundreds of Flowers Immortal Country, even if Sword Divine Palace wants to capture you, they will not dare.

Mu Qianxiang was immediately overjoyed, she laughed and said: "On the way here, let’s talk about my brother’s things."

"Then what about me, I also want to go. I want to see Flower Emperor." Chen Xiang anxiously said.

"You better not go. I heard from Xiang Yue that Flower Emperor doesn’t have a good impression of you." Liu Meng’er anxiously said.

"How is that possible? I didn’t offend her." Chen Xiang was completely puzzled.

"Maybe because you have mastered the Heaven Earth Killing Method, Flower Emperor does not like to kill, and moreover, respects life. You can be considered a killing demon in Di Tian, maybe because of this, and your killing intent is very famous." Liu Meng’er said: "Leave her to me, I will make arrangements. She is also my younger sister."

Liu Meng’er smiled at Mu Qianxiang, and Mu Qianxiang also laughed back, the relationship between the two of them had already become very good.

"Mm, I got a good sword, so I’ll let you give it to her." Chen Xiang sighed helplessly.

After Mu Qianxiang said his goodbyes to Chen Xiang, he left with Liu Meng’er. Before he left, Chen Xiang gave her a jade token that allowed her to participate in the Immortal Sword Conference. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"Flower Emperor respects life so much, could it be that she has mastered Alive Slain Method?" Long Xueyi said.

"I am investigating the Alive Slain Method now, but that is only your guess." Chen Xiang said. He had already obtained the Beast Slain Method, but he had not gone to study it yet.

"Unless I can see her, she should appear during the Immortal Sword Conference."

It would be the Immortal Sword Conference tomorrow, and at dusk, an extremely shocking piece of news came. The Hall Master, who had not left the Sword Divine Palace for ten thousand years, actually came to the Divine Sword Immortal Palace.

Even the Divine Sword Immortal Palace’s Palace Master was shocked by this news, because the Immortal Sword Conference would not bring out such an old artifact. It could be seen that he had other intentions for coming here.

"Could it be that the Heavenly Pellet in that wild girl’s body attracted him? Luckily the Elder Sister Meng’er already took her away, with the protection of the Flower Emperor, she should be fine. If it was me, it would be hard to say." Chen Xiang secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

Because Ding Wuzhong’s arrival, even if it was late at night, not many people would fall asleep.

Ding Wuzhong was a very powerful being, and he had a divine sword in his hand. In the Nine Heavens, his power was also at the peak, and although he had not established a Immortal Country, his overall power was very strong. Only Divine Sword Immortal Palace, who had the same kind of power as him, would dare to oppose him.
