Seeing Long Yue’s reaction, the Smoke Charming became even more pleased and laughed: "Xiao Yue, it seems that you care about him a lot. "..."

"Shut up!" Long Yue snorted, he had already grabbed Chen Xiang and was about to pull him away.

"Wait ..." Aren’t you here to talk business? " Smoke Charming walked up to Long Yue and held his hand with a bitter face: "I have something important to discuss with you, don’t go!"

Chen Xiang couldn’t help but feel weird when he saw the look the Smoke Charming was giving him.

"What business? If you don’t give the Hell star back to me, there’s nothing much to talk about. " Long Yue coldly snorted, and then continued to drag Chen Xiang away.

Smoke Charming anxiously hugged onto Long Yue’s arm, and said tenderly: "There must be some secret inside the Hell star, why don’t we explore it together? I’m also very curious! "

"I’m not going with you. You stole a Hell star the other time." Long Yue wanted to double open Smoke Charming’s arms, but was held tightly by Smoke Charming.

"Last time, I gave a lot of effort, okay? This Hell star is something I should have obtained." Smoke Charming scoffed, "If you don’t believe me this time, you can make a blood oath. As long as you bring me there, I won’t take anything.

"Really?" Long Yue thought about it carefully. If Smoke Charming did not want anything and only went there out of curiosity, it would be good. After all, Smoke Charming was still very strong.

"I can swear a blood oath now!" The Smoke Charming said.

"Alright!" Long Yue also agreed.

After Smoke Charming swore a blood oath, Long Yue was also relieved.

"What exactly is the secret behind the Hell star? You can tell me now! " The Smoke Charming had guessed that the Hell star could guide the owner to a certain place.

Long Yue took out the Hell star and helped Smoke Charming test it out, allowing him to see the mystical door inside the Hell star.

"Where is this gate? Is it inside the Hell star? " Smoke Charming was very curious.

"I don’t know, give me your Hell star to try." Long Yue said. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Chen Xiang suddenly felt that he did not exist at all. The two girls in front of him had become allies just like that, it was so fast, even he did not expect that it would happen.

Smoke Charming gave his Hell star to Long Yue.

Long Yue put the two Hell star together and the two Hell star emitted a white glow.

"The door is open!" Long Yue now closed his eyes and probed the Hell star.

"And then?" Smoke Charming asked anxiously.

When the door opened, I saw a mountain .... After Long Yue finished speaking, the two Hell star suddenly fused together.

After the fusion, it turned into a very small white key.

The white key floated in the air and pointed in a direction.

"This key will guide us to that place." Long Yue said.

"This direction... Could it be where we obtained the Hell star? It’s very dangerous there. " The Smoke Charming shouted, "Are we going to do it again?"

"It’s fine if you don’t want to go." Long Yue snorted lightly.

"Of course I do." Smoke Charming stuck out his tongue, then looked towards Chen Xiang. "What about him? Will you take him? "

"Since it’s dangerous, then I won’t be going. You guys can go. I still have something important to do." Chen Xiang had already obtained a lot of ingredients and Shenyuan crystal ginseng s. Once He Fengyuan concocted the pill formulas, he would start refining the pills.

"Once the blood rain stops, we’ll leave immediately. If you don’t go, then stay here and wait for us to return." Long Yue said.

"Xiao Yue, is this kid even your man?" The Smoke Charming laughed as she caressed Chen Xiang’s handsome face. Her beautiful eyes were filled with lovely tenderness.

"No!" Long Yue finally admitted it.

"That’s great. Can I do something to him? "He’s incredible at pill forging, and his looks are not bad either. I really like him!" Smoke Charming flirted with Chen Xiang, spitting out an orchid beside his ear, laughing.

"Go away!" Long Yue did not know why but he quickly pulled Smoke Charming apart. He looked angry.

"Aiya, are you jealous? Didn’t you say that there were a lot of women around him? You are a high and mighty Beast-creation Race Emperor, so you definitely cannot tolerate this kind of thing, but I can! " Smoke Charming laughed as she got closer to Chen Xiang. This time, she hugged Chen Xiang and stuck close to him with her soft body.

Chen Xiang did not say anything. After all, this was something that the Smoke Charming had stuck to him and he would not lose out if he was taken advantage of by this kind of spirit demon.

Long Yue looked on with a face full of frost and grinded his teeth.

"Miss Long Yue, this is my private matter, you don’t need to meddle in it ... Big Sister Smoke Charming, let’s go into the room and discuss pill techniques. " Chen Xiang laughed.

"Alright, please advise me." Smoke Charming laid in Chen Xiang’s embrace and spoke in a soft and charming voice.

Long Yue pulled Chen Xiang closer and said sternly: "Don’t be tricked, this woman is so straightforward in agreeing to be with you, there must be something wrong!"

"Forget it, forget it. In any case, I won’t be able to accomplish this. What a pity!" Smoke Charming straightened his clothes, then came to Long Yue’s side and held Long Yue’s arm: "I’ve already given you my Hell star, don’t quietly run away, I need to pay attention!"

Chen Xiang only smiled faintly. He was still very cautious towards Smoke Charming, he was just joking around.

Until now, he still could not see clearly what the Smoke Charming was doing.

"I’m actually worried that you’ll be eaten by this demon now." Seeing how close Smoke Charming and Long Yue were, Chen Xiang couldn’t help but feel secretly jealous of him.

"She’s not my match yet, don’t worry!" Long Yue rolled his eyes at Smoke Charming, filled with disdain.

"Xiao Yue is mine now, hehe!" Smoke Charming laughed mischievously as he even reached out his hand to touch Long Yue’s cold and beautiful face. Just as he touched her, his hand was opened.

"You guys can get intimate. I’m going to start concocting pills." Chen Xiang curled his lips and then left on his own. He had originally thought that Long Yue would follow him, but Long Yue had chosen to stay at the Smoke Charming Restaurant.

Chen Xiang returned to the Yellow Sky Tower and asked about He Fengyuan’s progress. Knowing that it was almost done, he felt a lot more at ease.

"Long Yue must be concealing some things from the Smoke Charming. Her relationship with the Smoke Charming is extraordinary." Xiao Xianglin suddenly said: "This is my intuition."

"I think so too. It’s not that they hate each other, it’s just that they have a conflict with each other." Chen Xiang snorted: "Seems like we have a good relationship."

"I have to say, that Smoke Charming is truly a demoness. Even I am a little tempted." Xiao Xianglin laughed: "But think about it, Meiyao is still the best. I like her more!"

"Master, you’re also very good. I’ve always been very interested in you." Chen Xiang laughed.

"Damn brat, do you believe that I won’t let Xianxian beat you up?" Xiao Xianglin had other thoughts for her the entire time, how could she not know about it?

Xiao Xianglin came out from the You Yao Mountain Villa, took out a set of black armor, and gave it to Chen Xiang: "This was refined using Long Yue’s scales and was mixed with many Tao-creation’s sacred crystals and various ingredients. Its defensive capabilities should be similar to Long Yue’s Dragon Armor, try it yourself!"
