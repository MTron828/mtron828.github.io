Chen Xiang’s current situation was not as serious as Feng Yujie had imagined. As long as the seal did not work on Chen Xiang, he could use the Spirit Lock Technique inside the Heavenly Alchemy to easily stabilize his mind and not be affected by her faintly discernable charm power.

It was just that Feng Yujie did not have such a strong Soul-Lock technique like Chen Xiang did, which was why she had mistaken Chen Xiang’s situation as very bad. Thinking back to it now, she felt that she had gone too far, and felt extremely guilty.

"Aunt Feng, you seem to understand the matters above Gods Realm very well. Have you ever stayed up there before?" Chen Xiang had already suspected this a long time ago, but what made him even more suspicious was that Feng Yujie was probably a Ranker who could have entered the Gods Realm a long time ago.

"I won’t tell you." Seeing that she avoided the question, Chen Xiang was sure that this Feng Yujie came down from Gods Realm, moreover, he had come down here a long time ago.

Chen Xiang curled his lips and said: "So petty."

Feng Yujie suddenly pulled Chen Xiang along, and flew him to a direction, where there was a large piece of Ancient Forest.

Along the way, Chen Xiang asked a few questions, but Feng Yujie didn’t even answer them.

They continued to fly for more than two hours before finally stopping. At this moment, they were at the bottom of a mountain in the depths of the forest.

"What did you bring me here for?" Chen Xiang looked around at the towering mountains. The mountains here were all Chaotic Mountain s and he had been to this forest before.

"Didn’t you want to know something about me? I brought you here and told you." Feng Yujie said.

"Can’t you just send me a sound transmission?" Chen Xiang laughed: "There’s no need to come to this kind of place, there’s no need to be alone ... ..."

Feng Yujie scoffed, and her expression became serious: "That’s because I have something that I want to show you, and that thing cannot be seen by others."

She extended her jade-like palm with a transparent pearl on it. It didn’t seem to be some kind of mysterious object.

"What is this thing? There’s nothing special about it." Just as Chen Xiang finished speaking, the transparent pearl started to shine, and there was a silvery-white glow inside. In the center of the pearl, there was even a sliver of flickering silver flames.

"Do you feel that it’s a little familiar?" Feng Yujie said in a low voice: "Now you know what this is."

The silver light that the pearl emitted became brighter and brighter, and Chen Xiang also felt a very strange burning sensation. This burning sensation was not because his body was being burned, but because of his soul.

Just being struck by this silver light made one feel as though their soul was being roasted.

"This is a Chuangzao fire." Chen Xiang also opened his palm, releasing a small silver flame that looked exactly like the one inside the pearl.

It was just that the flames Chen Xiang released trembled for a few moments, then immediately extinguished.

Back then, a large portion of the lives and energies of Nine Heaven World and the Endless Heaven Realm were burned out by this flame. As for mine, this is the Primal Chaos Fire Soul, which is also my life’s Fire Soul. " Feng Yujie put away the pearl, and said in a low voice: "That pearl from earlier, was my life’s Divine Deity."

"What?" Chen Xiang said in surprise. Feng Yujie could actually casually take out his own Divine Deity.

"Why would I lie to you? Do you know how powerful I am now?" Feng Yujie saw Chen Xiang’s surprised expression and chuckled: "Don’t think about bullying me."

Chen Xiang said snappily: "I’ve always been bullied by you, but I’ve never said anything, and I’ve always let you go. Also, right now, you haven’t told me where you’re from."

Feng Yujie lightly tapped Chen Xiang’s head, and laughed: "You idiot, you still can’t guess my identity, it’s already very obvious."

Chen Xiang thought about it, then shook his head, he really could not figure out where Feng Yujie came from.

"The fact that I possess the Primal Chaos Fire Soul shows that I am extremely skilled in controlling this type of flame." Feng Yujie chuckled: "I’ve given you a hint now, you should be able to guess it." Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

With this hint, Chen Xiang thought for a bit, then her face became startled as she looked at Feng Yujie who was giggling.

"One of the creators of the Nine Heaven World." Chen Xiang was stunned for a long time before shouting in shock. This was something he had never thought of before, and if it was really so, then what kind of identity did the Mei Emperor have?

Feng Yujie stuck out her tongue, and laughed: "Did I get scared? Actually, I am not really one of the creators, I was just a little girl in Nine Heaven Divine Palace back then."

Chen Xiang said: "Then what about Mei Emperor, didn’t you say that she came to this world together with you?"

"That’s right, we weren’t born in a normal way. I’ve told you before that I was born in the same crystal ball as you. It’s just that she was born in a black crystal ball and the ones that created us are the Nine Heavens Divine Palace."

Feng Yujie sighed: "Meiming Yan Jing and I are not finished products, we are just existences that were discovered, but that group of gods treated us very well, and treated us like disciples, and trained us, and when we possessed decent strength, they would bring us to create this world, and at that time, I would have already grasped the Chuangzao fire and would have helped a lot."

It was only then that we realized that I had heavily injured her, causing her to sleep for a very long time. However, when she woke up, she had caught up to the incident at Ten Heavens Supreme Lord, and because of some things, I was unable to stop her, and that caused the destruction of Di Tian. At that time, my master’s and the others’ plan failed, so I never thought that Di Tian would be reborn, and that it would be so perfect.

Recalling the past, Feng Yujie’s expression was complicated, the emotions of happiness, sadness, longing and loneliness all suddenly surfaced in his heart.

Chen Xiang still did not believe him, and shook his head: "Didn’t that group of Gods all die inside the Nine Heaven Devil Palace?"

"That’s right." Feng Yujie lamented: "Only I survived. Even to this day, I still don’t understand why before they died, they used all their power to send me out of the Nine Heaven Devil Palace."

"They exhausted the last of their strength and sent me out. However, I also had a hidden disease at that time, and I’m much better now."

Chen Xiang stared at Feng Yujie. If what Feng Yujie said was true, then Feng Yujie was a genuine and powerful goddess.

"I can’t believe it, doesn’t that mean the Mei Emperor is very powerful?" Chen Xiang suddenly started to worry, there was such a powerful woman causing trouble in the Nine Heaven World, this was a disaster.
