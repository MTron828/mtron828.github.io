Huo Lin’s words made Chen Xiang extremely worried, he used to be the only one in the Nine Heaven World who had Earthly beast, but from the looks of it, the Earthly beast in the Super God Realm was very powerful, if not Huo Lin would not have said such words.

"Huo Lin, do you need help?" Chen Xiang placed his hand on Huo Lin’s shoulder, and asked seriously. Since Huo Lin called him big brother, he would definitely help Huo Lin repel the enemy if he had the strength now.

"Of course not, I’m not afraid of that guy, I can defeat him, and this is also one of Earth’s Core Divine Spirit’s tests. Big Brother, you don’t have to worry about me." Huo Lin smiled at Chen Xiang, his heart moved because he was too weak back then. If Chen Xiang had not helped him, he would have died in that fire liquid.

Therefore, he had always been training very seriously to increase his own strength.

"Then you better be careful. If it doesn’t work, use this jade tablet to contact them. If you say you’re Huo Lin, then there’s someone to help you." Chen Xiang gave her a message talisman that allowed her to practice on Lv Qilian. Lv Qilian’s current strength was very strong, comparable to a Third Rank Divine King.

Huo Lin nodded, and then sent them off with his eyes.

After returning to the Hundreds of Flowers Village, all the girls in the ring had come out. Seeing that they had become so strong, Chen Xiang was a lot more at ease.

"We have already forged a Dark Jade Ring and a Transmission array Plate that has entered the center of the earth." Xue Xianxian laughed. In the future, we can also go to the Earth’s Core and use the Time Formation to cultivate.

Chen Xiang nodded. Although there was only one set of Time Formation, Chen Xiang had copied them all using his Six Realms mirrors and he would be able to activate the Time Formation through the Six Realms mirrors in the future.

"The Nine Heaven World and the Nine Heaven World are preparing to merge. The space is currently very weak, I think I can directly teleport to the Super God Realm myself." Chen Xiang looked to the sky. "Back then, I promised Xiao Yulan that I would return the Six Realms Ding to her.

Xiao Baifeng said: "I want to go with you as well."

Originally, Chen Xiang wanted to let Xiao Baifeng go with him, but he shook his head.

"No need for now. It’s better if you stay here for the time being." Chen Xiang said: "Yue’er and I will go. I just need to give her the Six Realms Ding, then her strength will greatly increase, and I don’t need your help either. And since you are in the Hundreds of Flowers Village, your strength is considered relatively strong, so you need to stay here."

"Alright, if anything happens, come back and tell me." Xiao Baifeng sighed, she knew the situation of the Hundreds of Flowers Village as well. If the Nine Heaven World fused with the Super God Realm, then there was a possibility that there would be a conflict with the powers in the upper echelons of the Super God Realm.

Therefore, the Hundreds of Flowers Village needed powerful warriors to watch over them. Xiao Baifeng was the stronger one amongst the wargod squads, so it would be safer for her to stay here.

"Then I will leave first. I should be back soon ..." Or it could be said that the Nine Heaven World has already fused with the Super God Realm, so it would be more convenient to travel back and forth. " Chen Xiang said.

After bidding farewell to the girls, Chen Xiang teleported out of the Hundreds of Flowers Village and went directly to the outside of the Heavenly Divine Palace.

Now, he realised that Chen Xiang had become very strong, and was extremely shocked, because the last time he had seen Chen Xiang, it was only recently.

Chen Xiang followed Jiu Canghai into a secret room.

"Did he use the Time Formation?" Jiu Canghai asked. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Yes, this Time Formation was also left behind by your father." Chen Xiang laughed, "I didn’t expect you to see through it so easily, Big Brother Canghai."

"You’re pretty amazing, to be able to use that kind of Time Formation here, you need a lot of energy to maintain it, did you enter the earth’s core?" Jiu Canghai understood all of this very well, he could understand it just by thinking about it.

"Yes." Chen Xiang nodded, and then took out the Heavenly magic sword that had its sword tip cut off. "Big Brother Canghai, is this sword the one that belongs to Heavenly Divine Lord?"

When Jiu Canghai saw this broken Heavenly magic sword, he lamented and then received it with trembling hands. "This is the Heavenly magic sword ... "Those girls are truly amazing. They actually discovered this secret, and even reorganized it."

"Back then, my royal father had separated this place and forged a few different kinds of divine weapons. He also did not want this Heavenly magic sword to appear again, because this Heavenly magic sword meant that he had fallen."

Jiu Canghai returned the Heavenly magic sword to Chen Xiang: "This has long been yours, you don’t need to return it to me. Even though royal father doesn’t want this sword to see the light of day again, I still hope that you can repair it."

Chen Xiang nodded his head, and said: "Even though the tip of the sword has been broken, this sword is still very powerful. "It’s hard to imagine."

When the time comes, there will be a bloody storm. Fortunately, all my friends in Nine Heaven School are working very hard, so I think that I will definitely be able to rebuild the Nine Heavens Divine Nations. " Jiu Canghai was already full of confidence now. He smiled slightly: "You aren’t the only one who has the Time Formation, the things that my royal father created back then are very powerful."

Chen Xiang smiled and said, "Big Brother Canghai, it seems like you no longer need my help."

Jiu Canghai laughed openly, it was obvious that he had made his preparations, because the Divine Nations was currently in a civil war, when the time came, it would also be his chance.

... ....

Chen Xiang left the Heavenly Divine Palace, and then went to the Nine Heaven School to find Gu Dongchen. He came to this place to find Huang Jintian and, but he found out that they had already left a long time ago.

"They probably went to the Super God Realm. These two old fellows must be thinking about the treasures in the Divine Nations." Chen Xiang laughed, then used a strong power of space to open a passage to the Super God Realm.

"a lad, do you want to come with me for a walk?" Chen Xiang asked with a smile.

"I’m not going. It won’t be long before we merge. I think it’s better for me to stay here. This place has more time, so I have more time to prepare." Gu Dongchen laughed, "Young senior uncle, have a safe trip."

Chen Xiang nodded and entered the spatial passageway to arrive at Super God Realm.

"Xue Yi, Qi Shi and the four Guardian Divine Beasts are here ... They must also have their own plans, so for the time being, I don’t want to look for them. That’s what’s important. "

Chen Xiang looked at the blue sky, took out his Six Realms mirrors and stood on top of it.

"Yue Er, do you remember the direction?" The last time he went to the Divine Cauldron Nation, he rode on Huang Yantian’s flying divine tool, and didn’t remember the way either. On his way back, he asked for Huang Jintian and the others to open a spatial tunnel.

"Of course I remember, but if the two of us work together, we can teleport to the Divine Cauldron Star." Yue Er flew out from the ring and said.

"That would be for the best. How should we do it?" Chen Xiang did not know the location of the Divine Cauldron Star.
