Chen Xiang saw the fear on all of their faces and laughed out loud: "Come and capture me if you have the ability, I want to see if you dare to run around in this place with me."

With that, Chen Xiang turned and ran, and disappeared.

Chen Xiang was also on tenterhooks right now, he couldn’t leave this region now, and there seemed to be something terrifying inside, so he didn’t want to fight against that group of people right now. He needed to conserve his strength to survive.

After Chen Xiang brought over a dozen people from the Paternoster Race, over a dozen youths appeared in this place. Zhou Xingzhi was one of them.

"The leader and the others have been sucked in!"

"What should we do?"

"I’ve already sent a sound transmission to the clan’s elders!"

"The leader and the others are finished. Where did that suction force come from?"

"It was released by the person we were chasing. After he was forced into a corner, he also dragged the leader and the others inside."

Zhou Xingzhi was also very worried. Chen Xiang had actually gone in just like that, and even brought over ten of their Paternoster Race s with him. Right now, he was sure that their Paternoster Race hunters were dead for sure.

"That was our Paternoster Race’s hunter, but he died just like that!"

"It’s a good thing that it wasn’t us ..."

Hearing that, everyone’s heart had lingering fear, if they surrounded and killed Chen Xiang, and were to get caught, they would be in an even worse situation. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

who was running, suddenly felt that the Qi behind him had scattered, the ten over people did not come to chase after him.

"They should have been together when they entered this place. Why should they be separated?" Chen Xiang was unable to understand.

"It’s very likely that there are other souls here ... Don’t they have Soul hound s? This Soul hound might have sensed a lot of souls, and could not even tell if it was you, so it took them everywhere to run, or if it was the Soul hound that scattered out of fear. " Bai Youyou warned repeatedly, "You must be careful. Let’s get rid of those fellows first, then think of a way to get out of here."

Chen Xiang didn’t know whether or not he could leave. After entering for so long, although he did not encounter any danger, he felt that this place was very scary.

Chen Xiang was currently at the top of a tall mountain. He wanted to fly, but he was unable to, whether it be through the Six Realms mirrors or using the great power of the Red fire dragon.

"I’ll use the illusion to take a look." When Chen Xiang released his spirit body, he discovered that the spirit body could freely enter and leave this area. Previously, he had let the spirit body in, and he had even seen some bones.

"What exactly is hidden inside?" Chen Xiang was extremely curious, and he didn’t know if he could find it.

Just like this, he stood alone on the peak of the mountain, controlling the illusion to fly around and investigate. Two days had passed, and he was safe and sound, but the illusion actually saw two white bones.

"One person and one Soul hound!" Chen Xiang was shocked. The powerful middle-aged man who was chasing him down before had now turned into a pile of bones, causing him to tremble in fear.

"There must be some kind of terrifying power hidden inside." Chen Xiang didn’t dare to run around randomly, he only wanted the spirit body to search everywhere, and now he had the spirit body to search around the body’s surroundings.

"We have to find out what’s in here." Chen Xiang was also wary of his surroundings. Although he would not run around randomly, something dangerous might find him.

The illusion flew to the top of the tree and he could see very far ahead. Through the illusion, he suddenly heard the crazy barking of Soul hound and immediately let the illusion pass through.

After getting close, he saw that the Soul hound and a middle aged man were wrapped in green light, their bodies quickly withering, and in a short moment, the middle stage World Defying Stage Legendary Rank middle aged man had turned into a dried corpse on the ground, and the terrifying thing was that the skin around the dried corpse had also quickly disappeared.

The middle-aged man turned into a pile of white bones, and the green light that engulfed him turned into a mass of light that floated in the air.

"It’s precisely this kind of thing, it’s too terrifying!" Chen Xiang now saw with his own eyes how the Soul hound and the people turned into bones.

"They can’t devour the power of the white bones. The bones also contain a very strong energy." Chen Xiang was suspicious, and immediately told Bai Youyou about it.

"I don’t know, maybe this thing can’t absorb the energy from the bones." Bai Youyou said, because the Devouring magic kungfu that she trained in was very similar to this.

Chen Xiang immediately let the illusion come back, he did not plan to run around anymore. He guessed that there must have been many types of green orbs of light in this area, and if they were touched by the green orbs of light, their bodies would not be able to move, and then be devoured.

In these few days, Chen Xiang asked Xiao Xianglin and Feng Ke’er to come out and look at the situation here. There was a strong barrier here that they were unable to break through, and they still needed to carefully analyze the various inscriptions on the barrier. They felt that they could only weaken the barrier and make the barrier weak, in order to leave.

It would take time to do that.

"I should be safe now." Chen Xiang had been staying at the top of the mountain for quite a few days already, and he had not come across that kind of green ball of light.

He actually saw a few new bones with his illusion.

"This group of fellows, if it wasn’t for them chasing after me, would I have brought them in? Haha, right now, all of you are going to die. " Chen Xiang was secretly amused, his face full of smiles.

But when he saw the green light in front of him, he couldn’t laugh.

"Motherf * cker." Chen Xiang saw the green light and immediately started running, quickly rushing down. He was already floating in the air, if there was a green light ball floating over, he would definitely be able to discover it, and this green light ball that suddenly appeared caught him off guard.

Soon enough, he understood why this green ball of light hadn’t been discovered by his illusion. It had come out of the ground.

The green ball of light that had been pursuing him suddenly appeared from the ground after it drilled into the ground, and quickly dashed towards him.

In a moment of desperation, Chen Xiang took out his Six Realms mirrors and blocked the green light that was shining towards him. He had observed this before, if this green light shone upon him from a short distance, he would not be able to move.

The Six Realms mirrors could only block the green light for now. As Chen Xiang was thinking about how to escape, he suddenly realised that green light was flying from all directions.

However, after he entered the Six Realms mirrors, the green light had also caught up to it.

Five green blobs of light came in, surrounding Chen Xiang, but what made Chen Xiang worried did not happen. These green lights did not cause him to be unable to move.

"Hey? "What’s going on?" Chen Xiang’s heart jumped, seeing the five balls of green light moving up and down, he found it hard to understand, and after walking out of the Six Realms mirrors, the green light ball followed him out.

After he left, the green blob of light released a very strong light, but it did not succeed in stopping him, much less absorbing his strength.

"You bastards, haha ..." You can’t do anything to laozi now, right? " Chen Xiang swung the Six Realms mirrors, using the mirror to ruthlessly attack the green blobs of light that almost scared him witless.
