Chen Xiang was currently the equivalent of a manager of the Natural Law World, but he truly did not know much about the Natural Law World. He shook his head, "I don’t know yet, but I might need to do some things to investigate the Natural Law World."

"If you are able to discover something from the Natural Law World, you must tell us as soon as possible so that we can make a plan in time, and then head to the Natural Law World to stop them." Lv Qilian replied, "Natural Law World isn’t a big place. I’ve been looking around for a long time now, but I still haven’t found a place to hide anything." Long Huishan said. She possessed the Ice Dragon Blood Veins, and had even been to the Core of the Earth many times.

"I’m not sure either. I just sensed that the Heaven Old Divine Race would not go to the Natural Law World because of this sort of thing. But right now, only the Heaven Old Divine Race has the ability to open a passage and head to the Natural Law World." Chen Xiang said: "Let’s talk about this after I investigate more about it. I need to find a friend and ask him about some things related to the Heaven Old Divine Race."

"Alright, then let’s continue discussing our matters and wait for your news." Long Jiuxiao said.

"Don’t break the bridge between Dan God Mysterious Land and us. We might have to go back in the future." After Chen Xiang finished speaking, he quickly teleported away.

Heavenly Dragon City and Hundreds of Flowers Village had already been moved to the Dan God Mysterious Land and he heaved a sigh of relief.

"Do you want to go see Natural Law World yourself?" Feng Ke’er said: "Don’t you only need to close your eyes to see what’s inside Natural Law World?"

"That’s right, that’s not bad, but I can’t see it clearly, and my perception of Qi isn’t very clear either. I plan to make a trip to Natural Law World!" Chen Xiang had already arrived at the Divine Wasteland.

The Dan God Mysterious Land was hidden in an independent space. This space was built by the Myriad Tao Dan God, it was not easy to enter, and it would be extremely difficult to destroy it.

After Chen Xiang took out the Six Realms mirrors, through the special ability of the square boulder, he immediately saw Chen Cai.

At this time, Chen Cai was on the main street holding a skewer in his hand. He was eating it while smiling mischievously, looking like he was extremely happy.

"A twirl of a beard!" Chen Xiang shouted, he did not expect this fellow to still be so relaxed.

"Shen ... Chen Xiang! " When Chen Cai heard Chen Xiang’s voice resounding in his mind, he was extremely shocked: "I thought you had died!"

"I have a tough life. Even if you die ten times, I still won’t die once. I’ll go find you right now!" After Chen Xiang confirmed Chen Cai’s location with the Six Realms mirrors, he quietly teleported to the city that Chen Cai was in before running to his side.

His Six Realms mirrors could only lock onto the location of his acquaintances. If he could communicate with his acquaintances, it would be useless against strangers or even his enemies. He did not know why.

It was too easy for Chen Xiang to find him. Even if he could teleport, he had to at least ascertain his position no matter what.

"You, where have you been dying these past few years?" I’ve been looking for you! " Chen Cai took out a few skewers of meat and gave it to Chen Xiang, saying: "Eat, I just bought it not long ago, it’s still warm."

Chen Xiang finished it in a few bites, and praised again and again: "What meat is this? Not bad! "

"Of course, the meat of a savage beast from ancient times isn’t bad. It’s expensive." Chen Cai laughed: "Come, I will bring you to drink alone."

"You actually learned how to drink!" Chen Xiang laughed with some surprise: "You’re acting more and more like a human now, your days aren’t bad!"

"Of course, I’m not as stupid as those guys." Chen Cai was referring to the Heaven Old Orcs, he felt that if the Heaven Old Orcs didn’t come to the human world to enjoy, it would be a waste of his life.

Chen Cai brought Chen Xiang to a hotel and asked for a private room. From the private room, they saw a river and the scenery was pretty good.

"Have you heard of No Tao Place?" Chen Xiang asked.

"No Tao Place? I didn’t hear of it. Is this the place you’ve been going to for the past few years? " Chen Cai looked at Chen Xiang, and then pinched Chen Xiang’s shoulder, and immediately became shocked: "You have become so powerful!"

Chen Xiang’s improvement was only an increase in his physical body. If he did not go and touch it, it was simply impossible to know that he would have such a huge breakthrough.

"Yes, I have cultivated for many years." Chen Xiang chuckled, and then explained the No Tao Place to Chen Cai, shocking him quite a bit.

"What an eye-opener! There’s actually such a strange place?" Chen Cai sighed: "Doesn’t this mean that your body is very strong?"

"It should be. At least right now, if we meet with Heaven Old Orc Emperor, we won’t be as bedraggled as before." Chen Xiang drank a cup of wine, then asked seriously, "You should have a very good understanding of Heaven Old Divine Race, right?"

When he mentioned the Heaven Old Divine Race, Chen Cai’s expression couldn’t help but change, becoming serious as he sighed.

"I didn’t want to say this, but who told you to be my only friend? I’ll tell you! " After Chen Cai finished speaking, his serious face revealed a smile again: "Correction, I should have two friends, and Xiao Ke’er this little girl!"

Feng Ke’er immediately came out from the You Yao Mountain Villa and laughed: "You twerp, I thought you had forgotten about me!"

Feng Ke’er was also eating the dishes on the table. Even though she was just a little girl, she had a lot of food and could not stop.

"What is the background of the Heaven Old Divine Race?" Chen Xiang asked: "This seems to be related to your secret!"

"Do you know why I am an oddity of the Heaven Old Orcs?" Chen Cai asked.

"How would I know that you’re a weirdo?" Chen Xiang curled his lips: "Hurry up and say it, don’t keep me guessing!"

Chen Xiang was extremely curious!

"This is mainly because I am a descendant of the Heaven Old Divine Race and the Heaven Old Orcs." Chen Cai said: "This has also caused me to be mocked since I was young!"

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" I thought Heaven Old Orcs was born from a Heaven Old Divine Race or an ancient beast. " Feng Ke’er said: "Looks like I guessed wrong."

"Little girl ..." This kind of thing is also possible. Let’s not talk about this for now! " Chen Cai sighed: "My mother is Heaven Old Orcs, my father is Heaven Old Divine Race! In a situation like mine, not only will Heaven Old Divine Race not accept it, they will even kill me. In their eyes, I have tarnished the existence of their Heaven Old Divine Race bloodline, because that’s why my parents were killed. "

"Truly pitiful... "Then which side killed them?" Feng Ke’er said.

"I was killed by Heaven Old Divine Race. Actually, Heaven Old Orcs doesn’t care about this, which is why I grew up together with him." Chen Cai said, "Fortunately, I still have a bit of skill and inherited a bit of my father’s memories, so I am able to have a good understanding of artifact forging."Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
