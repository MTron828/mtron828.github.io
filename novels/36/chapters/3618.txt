When Zhou Xingzhi heard Chen Xiang’s voice, he was even more shocked than him. Chen Xiang actually came near to their Paternoster Race! He had previously informed Chen Xiang about this so that he could avoid the two people who came to kill him. This was to ensure Chen Xiang’s safety.

But now, Chen Xiang had ran over to their Paternoster Race’s side. Moreover, there were many Eight ancestor contract map here, so it was very dangerous.

"I should be the one asking you that!" Zhou Xingzhi immediately responded, "You’d better leave this place immediately. If they find you, that would be really troublesome."

"What’s there to be afraid of? They’re just a bunch of pigs. They can’t find me." Chen Xiang laughed.

"In other words, I’m a pig too?" Zhou Xingzhi snorted, if not for the sound transmission from Chen Xiang, he definitely would not have known of Chen Xiang’s presence.

"If you think so yourself, I can’t help it!" Chen Xiang laughed: "I never expected myself to come to your Paternoster Race’s territory by chance."

"How did you get here? Our Paternoster Race is very well-hidden, you can even run here. " Zhou Xingzhi was puzzled, only Paternoster beast would normally come to this place, if someone came, they would mostly be from the Fire Mountain School, and the others would rarely come to this kind of place.

"Isn’t it to hide? I didn’t expect to find such a place. " Chen Xiang sighed, he could not let Zhou Xingzhi feel that he was here for the Paternoster Race.

"Then hurry up and leave. This place is truly dangerous. Not only is there our [Curse] Clan, there are also other things." Zhou Xingzhi said: "Oh right, the two fellows that went to deal with you the last time actually died!"

"Really? "How did he die?" Chen Xiang asked.

"He died without a complete corpse... I don’t know who killed him, nor do I know where he died to. Right now, the entire Paternoster Race is discussing about this matter, and all of the clan’s upper echelons jumped up and down, saying that they need to investigate this matter thoroughly. " Zhou Xingzhi sighed: "No matter what, they will blame this on you, so you should still be careful."

"Yes, I will leave now." Chen Xiang nodded, but he had already dispelled the idea of sneaking into the Paternoster Race, as the inside of the Paternoster Race must be extremely tight, and he had originally wanted Zhou Xingzhi to bring him in, but seeing Zhou Xingzhi’s reaction, it was impossible.

Just as Chen Xiang was about to leave, he suddenly heard something like a dog barking, only that the sound was louder and louder, sounding like a huge dog barking.

"Let’s go, they found you." Zhou Xingzhi anxiously transmitted to Chen Xiang: "That is a Soul hound that our Paternoster Race reared, as long as there is a living person’s soul aura fluctuation nearby, this dog will be able to sense it."

"Then I’ll take my leave." Chen Xiang started to run frantically.

"Zhou Xingzhi, you almost died just now. Did you know? Patriarch arranging such a trash like you to come here is truly a burden to us. " The middle-aged man with the hunting dog cursed and started to run away on his black hound that was as big as a horse.

While Chen Xiang was running, he heard barks from all directions, many of these Soul hound exist in the Paternoster Race.

"Damn it, these guys are truly not to be trifled with." Chen Xiang was even more afraid to enter the Paternoster Race now. He was only outside the walls of the Paternoster Race, but he was being chased to death by this group of people.

The Soul hound came from all directions, and the hunting dogs were not strong, but the people riding on the Soul hound were powerful, and were all in the middle stage of World Defying Stage Legendary Rank.

"There’s a total of ten. These are definitely not the people from before, they must have called us here from the Paternoster Race." Chen Xiang immediately activated his Time and space power, wanting to leave the area. However, he discovered that space and time had been sealed.

"It seems like they’re very experienced with this kind of thing."

Chen Xiang had no choice but to hide in this area frantically. At the same time, he also had to avoid those who had Eight ancestor contract map s. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After a few hours, Chen Xiang would be very annoyed by their chase, he didn’t know how to escape either. Those Soul hound were too powerful, no matter how he tried to conceal himself, he would definitely be discovered.

When the Soul hound sensed Chen Xiang, it would immediately run away at a very fast speed.

Suddenly, a black shadow pounced over. Chen Xiang was finally caught up to by the Soul hound.

The middle-aged man who was riding on top was extremely powerful. The moment the Soul hound pounced, it released its power to attack Chen Xiang at the same time.

Fortunately, Chen Xiang was able to avoid the fist, otherwise, he might have been shattered by the force. The middle-aged man’s fist might have shattered the hundreds of trees in the forest.

"You won’t be able to escape, hahaha ..." The middle aged man started to recklessly attack Chen Xiang.

"I won’t be captured even if I die." Chen Xiang looked in one direction, then angrily rushed over.

At this time, the people of the other Paternoster Race rode on Soul hound s and chased after them. They knew the direction of the beasts, and there were more than ten Eight ancestor contract map in the forest over there.

The more Eight ancestor contract map there were, the more dangerous the area would be, and the area that Chen Xiang was rushing towards, was exactly the most dangerous place. The people from the Paternoster Race were still real, as there were thousands of mountains that were covered in the area, and some of their Paternoster Race s had also gone in, but none of them came out, and all of them died inside.

The bones that Chen Xiang had seen before were the people of the Paternoster Race.

"Leader, he went in!" The people of Paternoster Race were standing beside a big tree, looking ahead. On the trunk of the big tree was a huge Eight ancestor contract map.

"If we go in, we’ll die. Let’s go back ..." The leader gritted his teeth and cursed: "Why do you have to bother with this bastard? "It’s good for us to yield obediently. We might spare his life, so why do we need to go in and throw away our lives?"

When Chen Xiang went deeper in, he felt that something was amiss. He had already entered into a barrier and felt that it was difficult to remove.

Hearing the leader’s words, he became furious and immediately took out his Six Realms mirrors, "Don’t even think about going back, just stay with me!"

Chen Xiang placed a large amount of Tao-creation Holy Crystals into the Six Realms mirrors and activated a large devouring array for the Six Realms mirrors, allowing the large array to instantly produce an extremely strong suction force.

The group of people who had just returned didn’t have any reaction at all when the strong suction force came. They were pulled over by the suction force. In addition, over ten thousand trees were also sucked into the suction force.

Chen Xiang had used up almost all of the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals, but fortunately, Xiao Xianglin still had enough for her to refine.

The more than ten people from the Paternoster Race and more than ten Soul hound were pressed down by the huge trees.

"Haha, you bunch of idiots. Now, do you know how powerful I am! If it wasn’t for you chasing after me, your dog lives might have been very long. But now ... You guys entered this damn place just like me. " Chen Xiang looked at them and laughed out loud.

"Bastard, you’re the one who brought us in. I want to cut your flesh off piece by piece." The leader’s eyes were bloodshot. After being in the vicinity of this place for so many years, he knew how terrifying this place was. Entering it was equivalent to death.
