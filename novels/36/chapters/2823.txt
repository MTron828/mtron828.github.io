The bat is too respectful, but there is no such thing as sinking. He looked at the Emperor's Seal in the hands of Shen Xiang. Shaking his head: "You are not an artifact of heaven. There is no heaven and spirit. Your heavenly artifact."

The body of Shen Xiang is the artifact of heaven. But he still does not intend to tell the bat too respect.

"I am not an artifact of heaven. I just think that if it is a fusion of the gods, it will become stronger. How did you use the gods of the day?" Shen Xiang asked.

"Injecting the power of the road. It will enable the gods of the gods to have a strong spirit of heaven and earth. It will produce a stronger power of destruction." The bat said too much: "I admit. I really can't play the best of the gods." Powerful. This is really not for me. If it is really suitable for you. I can consider giving it to you."

Shen Xiang remembers that Master Wang said. This bat was too respectful because it was because the **** of heaven in the hands of the **** of the gods was suitable for him. Then I grabbed it and grabbed it. Have not returned so far...

"Okay. Then how do you know that I am suitable to use this day to refine the gods." Shen Xiang asked.

"If you can make this day's refining of the gods, you will release a strong refinement. If you surpass me, then I will give you the seal of heaven." The bat said too much: "But you have to promise me. Get it." After the refining of the gods, I am not allowed to run."

"I promise you." Shen Xiang nodded immediately.

"No. You have to get a **** contract. After all, you and I are not very familiar." The bat too respected immediately got a **** deed.

Shen Xiang also felt a little unbelievable at this time. He and the bat are too unfamiliar. But the bat is too respectable but intends to give him the **** of heaven.

After the blood contract is signed. Shen Xiang and Bat Taizun are very relieved.

"Give. You give it a try." The bat too respected the **** of heaven and made it to Shen Xiang.

Shen Xiang took it... I looked carefully. On this day, there is a "refining" on the printed side of the refining of the gods. There is a mysterious deity in it. When you look closely, you will feel a huge **** power constantly coming. It is daunting.

"Awesome things." Shen Xiang said. It runs darkly. At the same time, I urged my own gods. Then blend into the power. Fill in this day of refining the gods.

It just didn't take long. There was a sudden burst of golden light in the refining of the gods. at the same time. A majestic day of refining power rushed out.

At this time, Shen Xiang can feel that Tianshen Shenyin is sharply enhancing its strength. It is also very fast to absorb his power.

"It's so strong." The bat is too respectable next to Shen Xiang. The induction is the clearest. I saw that the ground was cracking at this time. A burst of golden light emerged from those cracks.

Tianlian Shenwei has penetrated into the ground. Tear the ground. The hill where the dragon bat had been tossing before suddenly exploded.

"Tianjin Shenyin is yours." Bat Taizun said to Shen Xiang. Fly away from the dragon bat immediately. Rush into the cracked hill. Just in the blink of an eye he flew back again. I saw him holding a golden fan in his hand.

"It is another artifact of heaven." Shen Xiang exclaimed: "It looks very strong."

The bat is too nodded and nodded: "Which is not strong in the heavenly refining artifact. Don't worry about it. You now have two pieces of heavenly artifacts."

Shen Xiang printed the **** of heaven. Smiled: "Of course I have no memory. The **** of the gods is already strong enough."

"This thing is powerful. But it is not as good as my heavenly refining. For this fan, I will give it to the gods. It is a compensation for them."

The bat too respected the fan. Asked: "What is your name? You guy is so powerful. It should be a famous guy."

"Shen Xiang. You?" asked Shen Xiang.

"Shen Xiang. You are Shen Xiang. Just got the artifact of Tianlian. And the soul of the refining instrument is integrated into the body... Good guy. You are a **** of heaven itself. No matter what kind of heavenly artifact you use. Can play out The strongest power comes." Bats are too uncomfortable.

"Hey. If you think I am pitting you. I will return this day to you." Shen Xiang took out the goddess of heaven.

"No. I am talking." The bat shook his head too shook his head: "You guys are also daring. I am a dragon temple. And you and the Dragon Hall have hatred."

"What a big hatred." Shen Xiang guessed what it was.

"You have stolen the only eternal meaning of the Dragon Hall. You said it is a big hatred." The bat was too respectful to take off the mask. Showing a handsome teenage face. It looks like only twelve or three years old. Very green.

"Then will you catch me for the Dragon Hall?" Shen Xiang stood on the dragon bat at this time...

"I am not interested. Although I am the Dragon Hall. But I have never done anything for the Dragon Hall. I hate the broken place of the Dragon Hall." The bat screamed too much: "You really are not afraid of me."Discover ùíèew chapters at novelbiùíè(.)coùíé

"It‚Äôs not that easy to catch me." Shen Xiang said: "Yes. How much do you know about the death of the dragon? Now you have to continue inside."

"Of course, I have to go in. This dragon is not only a good thing, but it is really dangerous. My Afu is inside. The slower it is. Mainly because he concentrates half of the power. On the defense. Slow down the flight speed." Bat bat said.

Shen Xiang now understands why this guy is running so slow. It turned out to be the reason.

"Let's go through together. Go in and see." The bat said too much: "You have only six early days. But your hiding power is very high. You can save your life if you are in danger."

"Good. Let's go in and see..." Shen Xiang said: "I want to ride this stuff."

"Of course. Flying in the air. This speed will be faster. It is much better than on the ground. My Afu is still very powerful." Bat said too.

"Not good. Your Afford is too big. The flight speed is too slow. It is easy to be the target of attack. And the breath does not converge. There is something in the dragon's death. No one knows." Shen Xiang said. I took out six mirrors. Then let the six mirrors grow a lot.

"Use my artifact. It will be much faster." Shen Xiang said: "The defense is enough."

Shen Xiang let the six mirrors release a protective cover. The bat is too respected to see. Nodded. Then jumped on the six mirrors of Shen Xiang. And the dragon bat is included in a space artifact.

The six mirrors fly very fast. This has to be attributed to the flight path of Shen Xiang and his full open mysterious door.

"Hurry. You have a lot of tricks. The bat is too respectable: "If I use the flight path directly. It‚Äôs just faster than you. ‚Äù

Shen Xiang rode a six-day mirror and flew for a long time. I talked a lot with the bats along the way. It is all about the Dragon Hall. He did not expect this bat to be very special in the Dragon Hall.
