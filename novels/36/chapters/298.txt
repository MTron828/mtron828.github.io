Chapter 299 - Complete Divine Blade

------------

After the stone was broken, an even fiercer spiritual attack wave invaded their conscious. Instantly, both Liu Menger and Chen Xiang uttered a sharp scream at the same time, but very soon it came to pass.

“Sister Menger, force the Dragon Soul into the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade with your divine sense!” It was Long Xueyi imitating Chen Xiang’s voice, for he was still half dazed at the moment.

Liu Menger soon recovered and immediately followed Long Xueyi’s instructions. With her divine sense, she pressed upon that azure fire like thing winding around the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade, but was met with a very intense resistance.

"Is this really okay?" Liu Menger hesitated because the resistance of the Dragon Soul was very strong, making it difficult for her to suppress it.

"Use your Vermillion Bird Tender Thread, not only can it not wrap and suppress material things, it can do the same to the soul!" Long Xueyi imitated Chen Xiang’s voice once more and explained what to do.

Liu Menger suddenly felt Chen Xiang had the atmosphere of an expert, he unexpectedly knew so many things, all of which she had no idea of! It should be remembered that she was the most powerful refiner in the entire Chenwu Mainland.

At this moment, a transparent ribbon appeared on Liu Menger’s jade-like palm. With her control and manipulation, this transparent ribbon transformed into countless very fine transparent threads, which then on nimbly entwined around the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade, and soon completely covered the blade.

At this point, Liu Menger felt the process was a lot easier, moreover, she could also sense the Dragon Soul drilling bit by bit into the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade.

The stabbing pain in Chen Xiang’s mind had disappeared by this point, his complexion was still a little pale. At this moment, Liu Menger was looking at him like she was looking at a monster, she was now even more curious about Chen Xiang.

"Little rascal, you have a lot of confidential secrets!" Liu Menger smiled, before she extended her hand and stroked Chen Xiang’s pale handsome face.

Chen Xiang reached out his hand in return and pressed upon the back of her hand, making her tender hand glue closely to his cheek. With a look of enjoyment, he said, "Sister Menger, there are some things which I can’t tell you, please do forgive me."

"Of course I know that, I’m not stupid." Liu Menger lightly sighed and replied. She then looked at the Vermillion Bird Tender Thread entwined around the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade.

Suddenly, the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade started shaking. Liu Menger quickly withdrew the Vermillion Bird Tender Thread, before the dense spirit patterns on the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade started shimmering in azure light.

"Fused! But with my current strength, I still can’t unleash the true might of the Dragon Soul and the blade." Chen Xiang said with some regret, before the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade turned into an azure light, and flashed into his body, before appearing in his hands.

The Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade slowly turned smaller until it resembled a dagger, a very small dagger. Now it could truly be said that Chen Xiang could control the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade.

"When this blade was being refined, a section was left for the weapon’s soul, that’s why it can so perfectly fuse with the Dragon Soul! It seems I better research more regarding a weapon’s soul. Even though it can make the weapon and its user fuse together, it is only possible with the support of a ton of spirit patterns." Liu Menger said in a low voice, as thoughts surfaced and started racing in her mind.

Chen Xiang looked at the Liu Menger’s pondering appearance and was enthralled. He could not help but reach out and stroke her beautiful face, which made her lightly spit in response.

"Thanks a lot Sister Menger for helping me buy such an expensive thing, I’ll definitely pay you back!" Chen Xiang slightly smiled and said. At this moment, the two of them were very close to one another.

As Chen Xiang deeply inhaled the sweet fragrance wafting off of Liu Menger’s body. Meanwhile, Liu Menger could feel a heat emanating from Chen Xiang. Both of them could not help but stare into each other’s eyes. Slowly, they unconsciously moved in closer before both of their lips came in contact and sealed each other’s lips. Before long, their tongues were intertwined, embracing the other tightly as they began passionately kissing...

After their kiss, both of them remained closely embraced, enjoying the wonderful lingering sensation. Liu Menger’s face was slightly flushed, last time she said this would never happen again, yet she was here. Thinking of this point, she lightly pinched Chen Xiang’s arm.

"Remember to pay me back! Although I don’t really care about it, I do care about your future. In the future you might not need to rely on me, you are going to become even more stronger!" Liu Menger’s gently said as she lied in Chen Xiang’s embrace.

"En!" Even though Chen Xiang’s response seemed light hearted, he knew it was very heavy. Liu Menger was not asking him to repay, but rather take responsibility!

Besides the Nine Elemental Flower and the Resurrection Grass, there were two other main ingredients for the Resurrection Dan, which were the White Jade Lotus Seed and the Hell Spirit Grass, but Liu Menger did not ask for those two things. Obviously she was thinking for his sake.

"Sister Menger, give me the Nine Elemental Flower!" Chen Xiang released Liu Menger from his embrace, and gently said while stroking her cheek, gently.

Liu Menger nodded her head, she didn’t ask the reason, and simply handed over the Nine Elemental Flower to Chen Xiang, "Don’t lose."

Chen Xiang kissed her cheek, and said with a laugh, "I’m going to look for Dean... and make him angry."

Liu Menger dispelled the barrier, allowing Chen Xiang to leave. Thinking of what just happened a moment ago, her complexion turned incomparably complex, before she let out a helpless sigh.

Chen Xiang was now in possession of all the main herbs of the Resurrection Dan, even though it was only one set, it was enough. With just one set, he could grow and multiply it into a vast amount, it was just that he currently didn’t have the strength to refine it.

That was a High-Grade Earth Level Dan! Chen Xiang was still far off from being able to refine that level of dan.

Gu Dongchen and Wu Kaiming were living in a small yet a very beautiful residence, this residence didn’t have any formation, so Chen Xiang directly leapt over the wall. Just as he stepped inside, a handsome and suave main appeared in front of him, it was Gu Dongchen.

"Young martial uncle, what are you sneaking about for?" Gu Dongchen was just a step away from slapping the intruder, before noticing who it was.

At this point Wu Kaiming also arrived, while Chen Xiang’s complexion turned completely serious.

"I have a very important matter to tell you." Chen Xiang said with very solemn look.

Gu Dongchen quickly entered a room with Chen Xiang. Although his young martial uncle was far worse than him in strength, he definitely had a lot of means. Moreover, he was a very ruthless person, which was why Gu Dongchen and Wu Kaiming both held deep admiration towards him.

"Young martial uncle, quickly speak!" Wu Kaiming urged.

Suddenly, a bright smile appeared on Chen Xiang’s face. He sipped a bit of tea before stating, "Eldest martial nephew, the ten Building Foundation Dans you bought in the auction was refined by your martial uncle! You’re truly generous, buying just ten dans for twenty million! From what I remember, you paid me the same amount for forty dans last time, that’s all!"

As expected, after hearing Chen Xiang’s words, Gu Dongchen’s face immediately turned green. Although he was a little angry in his heart, he knew the future would be tragic. He had believed Chen Xiang had not gone to the auction. But now that he knew the price of a Building Foundation Dan, a higher price needed to be paid later if he still wanted to buy them from him.

"Elder martial nephew, you’re truly formidable. During the bidding battle, even though you were being suppressed by Liu Menger and Lian Yingxiao, you still had a lot of wealth! You even managed to fight with them until the very end!" Chen Xiang came next to Gu Dongchen and patted his shoulder.

Gu Dongchen’s face was deathly pale, Chen Xiang now knew he was a plutocrat. The next time Chen Xiang would sell things to Gu Dongchen, he would definitely swindle his money back and then some.

Wu Kaiming was laughing on the side, Gu Dongchen had always been feigning poverty, it was precisely to make Chen Xiang sell the dans cheaply to him. However, during the auction, he had basically revealed his hidden abundant fortune.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
