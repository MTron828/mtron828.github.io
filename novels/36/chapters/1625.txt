"Bai Ziqian is Bai Youyou’s big sister. She told me." Chen Xiang did not want to reveal anything related to them yet.

Like the Ten Heavens Supreme Lord back then, she had roped all the heroes of the realm and helped him achieve his goals. It was just that Lv Qilian only took in females, if she really became one in the future, she would definitely have a lot of power and influence in the new generation of emperors.

There was another reason why Chen Xiang and Lv Qilian had mentioned the Mei Emperor. It was because he wanted to find the Mei Emperor and bring the head and soul of the Mei Emperor before Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou.

"Where are you in the Mei Emperor? She was heavily injured back then, but she definitely wasn’t dead." Chen Xiang said: "If this woman revives, I dare say that she will definitely be your number one opponent in the future."

Lv Qilian frowned: "Mei Emperor used her unrivalled charm to confuse many strong warriors, and even Great Yan Jing found a great number of rare treasures and various powerful techniques. Even if she was severely injured, she must have recovered in these few hundred thousand years, and her strength was even stronger."

Chen Xiang chuckled: "So you better get your father’s attention, Mei Emperor is specifically focused on this kind of strong and difficult to subdue man."

Lv Qilian sneered: "The one who should be careful is you, and you still have the nerve to talk about others."

"There are a lot of women around me, but they definitely aren’t the ones who attract me. They are the ones who establish a relationship of trust between me and them. I don’t believe that if you strip right now, I won’t even touch you." Chen Xiang said with complete confidence: "A woman who can seduce me has yet to be born."

Lv Qilian disapproved and continued to sneer: "That’s where you’re wrong, Mei Emperor isn’t strong not because of her attractive appearance, but because of her unique charm, she eats both genders, and there were many women who were defeated by her at that time."

Chen Xiang was immediately furious: "This woman truly deserves to die, I am already a woman, and am hurting so many women. How good is it for me, I must kill her." FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Lv Qilian said seriously: "Even if you are not affected by her, you have to guarantee that your friends in the Dragon Subduing School are not bewitching. Also, those women by your side, in the eyes of the Mei Emperor, are all good prey."

"That’s why I wanted to bring them to you so that you could train their resistance to this." Chen Xiang sighed, he was truly worried about this, Mei Emperor definitely already knew about Di Tian, maybe he had already successfully bewitched a large group of people to help her.

Lv Qilian said: "Don’t worry, I am not an ordinary person. I have done my research on the Mei Emperor very thoroughly, and all I can do is to be stronger than her."

Chen Xiang and Lv Qilian were discussing secrets while concocting spirit liquid. Although they always acted as if water and fire were not compatible, they could still chat for a few days when chatting.

"Chen Xiang, I will definitely become a Flower Emperor in the future. What about you? Your current strength should be very close to the Emperor Level. Lv Qilian asked.

"My next goal is to concoct pills, I have mastered all of the Celestial Slain Method, but right now I am mainly training in Alive Slain Method, you should know that the Heaven Earth Killing Method is extremely flexible, and different people can use different effects, so I might use it differently from you in the future." Chen Xiang smiled faintly. He had already decided on a direction in his heart.

"With your talent in alchemy, this direction is the right one. Back then, the person who obtained the title of Ancestor was the Dan Emperor, you might become an Ancestor in the future," Lv Qilian agreed with Chen Xiang’s direction very much and thought very highly of him.

Chen Xiang laughed, "It’s only the Ancestor."

Lv Qilian smiled, "Then what else do you want? Is the Venerable Emperor not enough?"

"How can you not be a god? You should have heard about the matters of the Hell Devil Emperor, right? That fellow is a god, the god of hell, no matter what kind of emperor you are, you have to kneel in front of these gods." Chen Xiang said indifferently. The Ancestor was indeed a bit too shabby for him who had the Divine Deity.

Lv Qilian sighed: "Gods Realm ... My father gave up everything for the sake of becoming a god back then, but in the end, he was still unable to enter the world of gods and was unable to pass the gods’ examination. Most importantly, he was unable to condense his Divine Deity. "

"A god is also evolved from a mortal, so don’t lose your confidence. No matter how difficult it is when the time comes, if you walk in that direction, no matter what the result is, at least you won’t regret it." Chen Xiang said.

Lv Qilian nodded. Thinking back to when she was still a weak girl, she had never expected herself to have the kind of strength she did today.

Chen Xiang was already able to condense five drops of spirit liquid within two hours.

"Let’s try out the effects of the twenty drops of liquid each." Chen Xiang said: "I will continue with the large amount of high level medicinal ingredients. I want to breakthrough to the Holy Pellet."

This was also what Lv Qilian needed the most. If Chen Xiang could succeed, if she wanted Chen Xiang to help her concoct the Holy Pellet, Chen Xiang would definitely not reject her request.

"Then let me leave my side for now. I will help you condense more spirit liquids." Lv Qilian took a deep breath, "Don’t waste it recklessly."

Chen Xiang smiled and nodded: "Definitely not."

Lv Qilian poured twenty drops of spirit liquid into a jade bowl and then poured ten more of her spirit liquid into it. Forty drops of spirit liquid merged together into a single drop in an instant, it was extremely mystical.

"Even if it’s two big bowls, they might melt into a single drop." Chen Xiang exclaimed: "If the compression is that high, the quality must be very high."

Lv Qilian nodded: "This drop, should be enough to fill half of the Holy level’s spirit medicine."

Chen Xiang anxiously took out a silver heart, this was a Sacred Heart fruit, Long Xueyi had always wanted to taste it.

"Try this." Chen Xiang gasped in surprise as he handed the Sacred Heart fruit over to Lv Qilian.

"Where did you get it?" Lv Qilian was a little reluctant to cut it in half.

"Jiang Sheng gave this to me, it’s a Divine Craftsman." Chen Xiang urged, "Hurry up and cut it out. If you can duplicate it, I will give you one."

"Alright." Lv Qilian took out a sharp dagger and cut open the jumping Sacred Heart fruit. To have this kind of Sacred Heart fruit, in the future, when he gave her time, she would be able to duplicate a large amount of it.

Lv Qilian dropped down her and Chen Xiang’s spirit liquid from the cut on half of the Sacred Heart fruit, and the other half quickly grew back.

"It’s a success, but there’s one more side." Chen Xiang took out the remaining twenty drops of spirit liquid and handed them over to Lv Qilian. "Looks like we need to use forty drops of spirit liquid to be able to make a copy of the Holy level’s ingredients."
