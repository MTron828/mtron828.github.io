Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou were both at the Divine Feather Holy Nations. They had separated for a long time and missed Chen Xiang very much. They had originally planned to go to the Hundreds of Flowers Palace immediately after leaving, but Feng Yujie told them to return to the Divine Feather School first. This way, they would be safer.

It was because five thousand years after Chen Xiang had disappeared, he had returned once again. Furthermore, the Hell Devil Emperor had also received news that the bounty order was still valid.

However, they also knew that it would be hard to kill Chen Xiang after five thousand years, so they did not immediately seek him out. There were many strong warriors who were killed by Chen Xiang back then, including the Strong of Lord Stage. If Chen Xiang could kill them five thousand years ago, there was no need to even mention five thousand years later.

Chen Xiang came to the Divine Feather Holy Nations and rushed straight to the Imperial Palace!

Thinking that he had to face such a mysterious and powerful woman like Feng Yujie again, Chen Xiang suddenly felt a huge pressure in his heart. Especially since Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou had always been following her, he was worried that they would be affected by Feng Yujie.

Other than Bai Youyou and his wife, Hong Xia and Ji Ling’er were also present. Originally, Chen Xiang had wanted to make Hong Xia and Ji Ling’er learn alchemy from him, but who knew that they would become his disciples later on? Chen Xiang felt that they would most likely follow him in the future.

When Chen Xiang came here, he directly reported his name, but he did not change his appearance, because he felt that Feng Yujie was very strong, and was not afraid of trouble.

Very quickly, Chen Xiang was invited into the dazzling palace. He arrived at a garden and found Feng Yujie sitting on a stone chair in the pavilion, pouring some tea.

Chen Xiang walked over quickly, sat on his butt, and directly sat in front of Feng Yujie. Then, he fearlessly looked at Feng Yujie’s ordinary appearance;

"Where’s sister Meiyao and elder sister You You You?" Chen Xiang looked around, but did not see the two girls, and asked anxiously.

"Five thousand years? Do you not miss me?" Feng Yujie laughed and gave Chen Xiang a cup of fragrant tea: "I am their godmother, if you want to see my daughter, of course I have to check!"

Chen Xiang drank the cup of tea in one gulp, curled his lips, and said, "You are their godmother, how can I miss you? I say, Aunt Feng, let them come out and see me! "

"That won’t do. I want to see how much you’ve improved in the past five thousand years!" Feng Yujie played with the ends of her hair, a pair of lively eyes flickering with a mischievous gaze.

Chen Xiang was very gloomy. Every time he met someone he knew, he would have to explain that it had only been a year or two, and he himself did not know where the five thousand years had gone to.

"I only spent a year or two in that place. I’ve already explained it to a lot of people." Chen Xiang explained everything that had happened to him in the Divine Prison with the fastest speed of speech.

"Thus, you don’t have to test me anymore. Quickly, let me see them. Otherwise, I’ll look for them myself!" Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The beauty that he had not seen for many years was here, and she was one of the two women that were most important to him. Chen Xiang was extremely anxious at this moment.

Feng Yujie, on the other hand, was not in a hurry at all. He continued to whet Chen Xiang’s appetite and laughed: "Meiyao is already one of your people, what are you in a hurry for? Once you’ve arrived, you don’t need to ask me about my matters. You always need to find them urgently, so I’ll be very sad and very disappointed. "

"This... Aunt Feng, you are their godmother, I can’t get too close to you! This is not good! " Chen Xiang said in a low voice: "Stop messing around, alright!"

The first time Chen Xiang had met this Feng Yujie, she was this mischievous.

"Why? I am just their godmother, and I am not related by blood... So what if we’re closer? Besides, you have so many women by your side, and none of them are jealous. Feng Yujie continued to incite Chen Xiang, causing him to wish that he could strip her of her clothes and punish her severely, letting her know how anxious he was right now.

"Do you think I’m too old?" Feng Yujie saw that Chen Xiang did not speak and continued to laugh. Of course she did not know that she had been stripped naked in Chen Xiang’s mind.

"That’s right!" You’re too old, and I’m not interested in you! "Of course, since you’re interested in me, I will take care of it and satisfy the emptiness in your heart!" Chen Xiang slowly said. He could already tell that Feng Yujie was doing this on purpose.

The more Feng Yujie wanted to play tricks on him, the more he couldn’t let him succeed.

"Aunt Feng, you have never slept with a man before!" Chen Xiang calmed down and started retaliating.

"That’s right!" Feng Yujie smiled slightly and said: "What, you’re beginning to be interested in me?"

"Of course not, I have so many women by my side, no matter what, I will not be interested in you." Chen Xiang laughed.

When Feng Yujie saw that Chen Xiang had started to talk nonsense with her, he originally wanted to tease her a little.

"Meiyao and You You are both very powerful now! With my help, they have already condensed their Divine Deity and cultivated Emperor soul s. The bones in their bodies are also crystal bones! I treat them like my own daughters, and they plan to follow you in the future. I’ve painstakingly nurtured these two beautiful daughters of mine, and I feel very sad to follow you like this. " Feng Yujie purposely pouted, his face filled with resentment.

"Why don’t you follow me as well! In that case, you can stay with them. My Dark Dragon Ring is very large, so even if there are ten more of you, you won’t be a problem." Chen Xiang chuckled, but in his heart, he was actually very grateful to Feng Yujie. Not only did he help Su Meiyao and her to treat the injuries she had suffered for so many years, he had also helped to make them so powerful.

"Humph!" I’m talking business with you right now. " Feng Yujie scoffed, "You’re not allowed to talk nonsense!"

"I was talking business with you too! Seeing you alone, I was suddenly interested in you. " Chen Xiang purposely revealed a sinister smile.

Feng Yujie clenched her jade teeth, and silently cursed Chen Xiang. She was really discussing serious matters with Chen Xiang right now, but who knew that Chen Xiang would actually take the initiative and tease her.

"Aren’t you afraid that I’ll beat you up? How powerful I have become in the past five thousand years, you can’t imagine! Yet you have lost five thousand years of your lifespan. If I want to take you down, it will be as easy as flipping my hand. " Feng Yujie suddenly became serious.

"That’s right, but you are still a loser under my hand. Back then when we competed to refine pills, you did indeed lose to me." Chen Xiang laughed: "How about we compete again, and play something bigger this time?"

"Great!" Although I, Feng Yujie, do not focus on refining pills, I can still beat you brat. Last time, it was only because I was too careless and did not understand you, and because I was a Pill Saint, I deliberately did not use my highest level, so do not think that I really lost to you. "

Feng Yujie was also a very strong woman, and when she heard Chen Xiang mention the matter of her last crushing defeat, it was even more true.

Back then, you could only concoct Immortal pills, and you even lost five thousand years there. I was already a pill saint, and during the past five thousand years, even if I didn’t really progress in the Dao of alchemy, my progress was enormous.

Even though Feng Yujie had said that, in the past five thousand years, she had worked hard on refining pills. It was only because she lost to Chen Xiang that she had to win it back.

"So you have a lot of confidence?" Chen Xiang said while beaming: "Since that’s the case, let’s play a little! If you are familiar with my affairs, you should know that I have two female slaves by my side. "

"I know, one of them is called Hua Xiangyue. She had come here before and learned some Alchemy from me. And there’s also Wu Qianqian, she’s also a good sapling, she seems to have been harmed by you, you little bastard. " Feng Yujie said: "Why are you bringing up your female slaves?"

"Since we’re competing, then we have to be heroic and heroic. There’s no need to gamble our lives, we don’t even like gambling on Holy stone s, so it’s more fun for me to gamble on them. If you lose, then you are mine! If I lose, I’ll be yours. " Chen Xiang laughed: "Do you dare to come?"

"This is not fair! What do I want you to do? However, your words are extremely useful! It’s not that I don’t dare, it’s just that the conditions are not equal. " Feng Yujie snorted. She didn’t think that this little bastard Chen Xiang would actually want to take her as a female slave. She felt that she had still underestimated Chen Xiang’s guts.

Chen Xiang said: "Then forget it, it’s not fun at all! Anyway, you’ve already lost to me! Alright, quickly let me see sister Meiyao and Sister You You! "

"No, I have to compete again!" Feng Yujie said resolutely, "We can discuss the aspect of the wager."

Chen Xiang said very casually: "My request is not big, I only want you to ... If that doesn’t work, you can stay in the same secret room as me and then, within two hours, no matter what I do to you, you can’t resist at all. "

As he finished speaking, Chen Xiang smiled evilly.

"Little Scoundrel!" Feng Yujie gritted his teeth and snorted, "I am Meiyao and the quiet mother, aren’t you afraid that they will find out?"

Chen Xiang laughed: "Didn’t you say it earlier? You aren’t related to them by blood, so it’s fine even if you get closer! "

"Forget it, I have plenty of time anyway. It’s impossible for sister Meiyao and Sister You You You You to be stared at to death by you for your entire life, I will have a chance to meet them one day! After I return, I have a lot of things to do, so I’ll be leaving first. "

After Chen Xiang stood up, he anxiously shouted out: "What are you anxious about? It’s not like I said no! "

"Alright, let’s talk about the wager now! "I can agree to your dirty conditions ..."

Chen Xiang interrupted her and laughed: "What condition do you have to agree to my request?"

"That’s right... "After you win, I’ll give you two hours of time. It doesn’t matter what you do to me ..." Feng Yujie lightly bit her lips, stared at Chen Xiang, and said.

"This isn’t a joke, is it!" Chen Xiang was a little surprised.

"I’m serious! However, this matter cannot be known to Meiyao and You You You, because once they find out, they will definitely stop your vulgar actions. " Feng Yujie said with a serious face. It looked like he was not joking

"But, if you lose to me! Then you will have to be my servant for a hundred thousand years! "
