Seeing the appearance of the four Slave in Purple Costume s, Chen Xiang was a little anxious. In the distance, there was a very large flying discs in the sky, where the young master of the He Clan, He Huang, was currently standing, smiling as he watched the besieged Murong Honglian.

"Murong Honglian, don’t you have a very powerful dragon? Quickly release it, don’t hide it anymore! " He Huang laughed: "I want to see how strong your dragon is!"

"Your He Clan is truly shameless! How many times have I said that the dragon had nothing to do with me? " Murong Honglian shouted in anger.

"It has nothing to do with you? It was clearly you who released it last time? If it’s not yours, then whose is it? " He Huang chuckled, and at this time, the four Slave in Purple Costume s were still attacking Murong Honglian with great ferocity.

"I’m too lazy to explain." Murong Honglian also did not say that it was her, and for some reason, she decided to hide this matter for Chen Xiang.

Murong Honglian wanted to teleport away, but this time He Huang took out an even stronger spatial sealing divine tool. Murong Honglian and the four Slave in Purple Costume s were inside the light barrier, so she couldn’t leave the light barrier.

"He Huang right? "Don’t be complacent, I will kill you sooner or later!" Chen Xiang saw that there were still three elders on He Huang’s flying discs. The strength of these elders were unknown, so Chen Xiang did not dare to rashly release the World Defying Green dragon, otherwise, he would be severely injured.

"Let me try and see if I can get this daughter of mine over here!"

Chen Xiang immediately left the Myriad Tao Forest, because he could not enter the Ten Thousand Dao Forest.

After he left the Myriad Tao Forest, he took out the Six Realms mirrors and saw that Murong Honglian was still barely dodging. He Huang, who was watching from the distant flying disc was a little anxious, "Three Ancestors, please make your move quickly. If you didn’t force her into a corner, she wouldn’t have released the World Defying Green dragon."

"Alright, I’ll go in now!" After a white robed old man finished speaking, he turned into a white light and shot into the huge golden light barrier.

"It’s over!" Seeing the old man come in, Murong Honglian felt despair in his heart.

"This old guy is very strong!" Chen Xiang immediately used the Six Realms mirrors to sense Murong Honglian’s aura. Then, with a thought, the Six Realms mirrors flashed and began to hover in the air. Then, Murong Honglian fell out.

Murong Honglian had originally thought that he should not be caught, but he did not expect that he would actually appear in a desolate mountain.

"Although I’ve saved you, you can rest assured that I won’t let you repay me with your body." Chen Xiang laughed.

"This is all your fault!" Murong Honglian rolled her eyes at Chen Xiang in anger. She needed to be thankful to Chen Xiang to be able to escape this calamity.

"Alright, there’s nothing else. You can go back to the Mu Rong family now." Chen Xiang said.

"You will go back with me. This is the only way to explain it!" Murong Honglian said: "My family will not ignore He Clan’s actions against me."

Chen Xiang shook his head: "You are too naive, letting me go with you to the Mu Rong family? You will definitely be eaten by the old fellows in your clan to the point where not even bones will remain. "

"Absolutely not, I promise." Murong Honglian said: "I am quite prestigious in the clan."

"I will not go." Chen Xiang said: "Don’t worry, I will use other methods to help you clarify things, as long as they know that the World Defying Green dragon is still in my hands, it’s fine, right?"

"But... But I’m worried that the elders of my family still won’t believe me. " Murong Honglian replied: "How about this, I won’t let you follow me back to the Murong Sacred Grounds, as long as you follow me outside, I will invite the elders out."

Chen Xiang thought for a moment, nodded his head, and said: "Alright, I promise you, if they attack me, you have to protect me, I am very afraid of death."

"Hmph, are you afraid of death? "No matter how I look at it, it doesn’t look like it. He seems like someone who would rather die!" Murong Honglian scoffed, then forcefully pinched Chen Xiang’s shoulder and began to teleport.

After teleporting several times, Chen Xiang finally arrived outside the so-called Sacred Ground of their family with Murong Honglian.

"Wait a minute, they will be coming out soon. I’ve already informed them." Murong Honglian said, then led Chen Xiang into a forest. There was a lake in the forest, and beside it was a pavilion.

Murong Honglian made Chen Xiang sit on the stone chair in the pavilion and wait.

"Did you find anything when you entered the Myriad Tao Forest? There’s nothing wrong with you inside! " Murong Honglian was very surprised.

"That’s just because you don’t know enough about it." Chen Xiang laughed: "You think it’s scary inside, you must have heard about it. In fact, it’s very safe inside, you World Defying Stage Clan can’t go in and capture me."

"That’s true!" Murong Honglian scoffed slightly, "How did you manage to get the World Defying Green dragon back last time?"

"They are all a piece of stone ..." Chen Xiang told Murong Honglian about the stone, but he definitely could not let World Defying Stage Clan know about him hiding the power of his other five beasts, otherwise they would definitely come to snatch it away like madmen.

"So strange!" Murong Honglian was also incredulous, she naturally believed in Chen Xiang’s words a lot, because this was something that she had personally experienced.

"You ... Was it because of that stone that made that powerful big fire dragon? " As long as Murong Honglian closed her eyes, the Red fire dragon would reappear in her mind. She would never forget the scene of how powerful the Red fire dragon was.

"Yes!" Chen Xiang nodded. "I can’t succeed on my own."

Suddenly, a spatial ripple came out, Chen Xiang was immediately on guard, it was definitely an elder from the Mu Rong family.

A middle-aged man and a dozen young men did not have that sort of extremely powerful old man.

"Greetings, Uncle-Master. Greetings, Seniors." Murong Honglian immediately bowed to them.

"This is Chen Xiang?" The white robed middle aged man looked at Chen Xiang, Chen Xiang had the Myriad Tao treasure in his hands, even without the World Defying Green dragon, the Myriad Tao treasure was still an extremely precious treasure.

"Yes, the World Defying Green dragon is still on him. Last time, because the red lotus was surrounded and attacked by the He Clan, he used a secret technique to release the World Defying Green dragon to help me escape. When the He Clan came to besiege me earlier, there were still three strong elders.

Murong Honglian formed the image of the old man from the He Clan. When the middle aged man saw him, he frowned: "He Clan and these guys are getting more and more excessive, they don’t even put us in their eyes!"

"Chen Xiang, is the Myriad Tao Divine Soil in your hands? This sort of thing is of no use to you, and you probably don’t know how to use it, so leave it to us. " A blue-clothed man said, his tone very rude and unreasonable.

"Murong Run, what are you talking about?" Murong Honglian was instantly enraged as he looked at Murong Run with killing intent.

"Things like the World Defying Green dragon and Myriad Tao Divine Soil were originally a waste on him." Murong Run sneered: "Teacher, don’t you think so?"

The middle aged man did not speak. He could tell with a glance that Murong Honglian was very concerned about Chen Xiang, if not he would not have been so angry.

Chen Xiang watched quietly, if it was only the attitude of the younger generation, he would not care, but if the middle-aged man and the other elders were the same, then he would have to be wary of the Mu Rong family in the future.
