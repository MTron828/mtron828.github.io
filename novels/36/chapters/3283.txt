Qin Shuang anxiously said: "Don’t worry, although the World Defying holy dragon is injured, it is powerful and will not lose that easily. Let’s quickly go over and take a look!"

"The sound is coming from the opposite side of the crevice. We can’t fly, how do we cross the crevice?" Chen Xiang came out from the Six Realms mirrors and asked with a frown: "Can I jump over there?"

"I can!" As Qin Shuang said this, he grabbed Chen Xiang and leaped with all his might towards that wide crack in the ground.

After they entered the Six Realms mirrors, they quickly flew towards the direction where the dragon’s roar came from. Cotton candy dancing e-book. More recent chapter access: ww.

When they approached, Chen Xiang came out from the Six Realms mirrors. The aura here was extremely tyrannical, making it easier for them to hide!

"Which carriage belongs to He Yancong and He Yancong?" Chen Xiang searched for the caravan enveloped by the black colored sandstorm. He could vaguely make out a little shadow, but he was unable to find it quickly.

With He Yancong’s and Zhu Haiprofound’s current strength, they were completely unable to enter the battlefield, so they had to be hiding inside the caravan to watch the show. This was a good opportunity to make a move against them.

"Their caravan is very strong, so it’s not easy for us to get in." She hated Zhu Haiprofound the most, because Zhu Haiprofound’s dirty thoughts about her always made her feel disgusted. Furthermore, Zhu Haiprofound’s strength had been greatly reduced after losing an arm, so if she and Chen Xiang were to work together, she would definitely be able to beat him.

"Don’t worry, I’ll use my sword to break it." Chen Xiang said: "I may have to use the World Defying beast’s power later!"

"En!" Qin Shuang knew that it was Chen Xiang’s secret strength, and she knew very clearly what would happen if the matter of Chen Xiang possessing a World Defying beast were to be exposed, it would definitely attract the attention of the upper echelons of the various races, and they would definitely want to snatch it away.

Approaching the carriage, Feng Ke’er suddenly said: "Do as I say, I guarantee that you will be able to destroy this carriage with a slash of your sword!"

Killing Zhu Haiprofound was the most important thing, because all of Ji Xingyuan’s deaths were caused by him, so he had to take revenge!

Feng Ke’er told Chen Xiang a spot. After memorizing it, Chen Xiang used enough strength to slash down at the spot slightly beside the side of the caravan. At this time, he was still using the Counter Power to conceal himself, but his Qi had been exposed. [Previous Chapter] [Table of Contents]

With a boom, the RV was split into two by Chen Xiang, causing the energy inside to gush out of the RV and create a series of intense explosions.

Qin Shuang also jumped over, holding onto his Purple Yang Excalibur, he leapt over like a ray of purple light. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Bitch, it’s you!" He never thought that Qin Shuang would actually appear here. He believed that Qin Shuang had followed them all the way here, and only took advantage of the departure of the old man in the convoy to make a move.

He Yancong’s caravan was nearby, but with such a large commotion happening on Zhu Haiprofound’s side, He Yancong was sure to realize something, he just got off the carriage, and immediately saw Qin Shuang’s figure. He anxiously went over, but was immediately enveloped by the Six Realms mirrors that Chen Xiang had released.

After Chen Xiang destroyed Zhu Haiprofound’s carriage, although he revealed his own Qi, Qin Shuang’s appearance caused Zhu Haiprofound to ignore Chen Xiang’s existence, and took the chance to hide in the vicinity of He Yancong’s carriage, waiting for He Yancong to come out.

Just as he expected, He Yancong saw Qin Shuang from the window of the carriage and was instantly furious. Because Qin Shuang had ’killed’ his Wild thunder tiger, he hurriedly got off the carriage and thought that Qin Shuang had followed him all the way here.

After He Yancong got off the car, he immediately thought of the fact that Qin Shuang still had other comrades, but it was already too late. Chen Xiang’s Six Realms mirrors had already enveloped him!

"Who the hell are you?" He Yancong finally saw Chen Xiang’s true face, to think that he was actually a human, which was unexpected, because in his eyes, no matter how strong humans were, their power was still limited, and most of the powerful humans were all Alchemist.

"I am the one who killed your Wild thunder tiger." Chen Xiang laughed coldly: "But I have to tell you, Wild thunder tiger attacked me first, you didn’t take care of the pets, and went around ’randomly’ biting people. After being killed, you harbored hatred in your heart, and didn’t reflect on your own mistakes.

"A lowly human like you is actually the one who killed my beloved pet ..." He Yancong was furious, he wanted to struggle free from the seal released by Chen Xiang the Six Realms mirrors, but he was unable to succeed.

"Lowly?" Chen Xiang laughed, and in a flash, the Heavenly magic sword appeared in his hands. He stabbed his sword into He Yancong’s chest: "I am a lowly person, but you died in my hands. It seems like you are not even comparable to me, a lowly person, so just die!"

He Yancong never thought that Chen Xiang would actually dare to make a move, "You ... You are a human, do you know who you are killing? I am a Soul River Divine Race ... "

"Pfft!" Chen Xiang fiercely poured the Sun madness fire s into He Yancong’s body, burning He Yancong into ashes from the inside.

He Yancong died, and even the one-armed Zhu Haiprofound saw from afar. He Yancong was slightly stronger than him, but he was actually killed.

Zhu Haiprofound had never felt such fear before. Although Wang Dao had attacked him and almost killed him, he did not have such fear.

But now, the strong had gone to deal with the World Defying holy dragon!

Qin Shuang also never thought that by relying on Six Realms mirrors, Chen Xiang would be able to easily kill off a powerful Fierce Fighting God like him. However, she thought that since Chen Xiang had cultivated a World Defying beast, his own strength was not weak, so killing He Yancong was not a big deal.

Just now, Chen Xiang had secretly used a lot of World Defying beast’s power. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to use the Six Realms mirrors to trap He Yancong, and he would have been run out by He Yancong.

When he had destroyed He Yancong, it had seemed very easy, but in reality, more than half of his power had been used up.

"Father, quickly save me." Zhu Haiprofound suddenly roared out involuntarily, while Chen Xiang had already used his Counter Power and disappeared, causing Zhu Haiprofound to be even more afraid, because he was fighting with the World Defying holy dragon in the distance, a wave of tyrannical Qi rippled out, making him unable to sense where Chen Xiang was.

When Zhu Haiprofound roared, Qin Shuang’s Purple Yang Excalibur had already stabbed into his abdomen, causing Zhu Haiprofound to scream in pain. Then, he was kicked twice by Qin Shuang, causing him to be extremely furious.

"An aura is approaching!" Qin Shuang anxiously used the Sound Transmission Technique, and Chen Xiang suddenly appeared behind Zhu Haiprofound. His arm seemed to be wrapped in a faint Red fire dragon image, it was spewing flames.

"Uncle, I’ve avenged you!" Chen Xiang’s fist that was wrapped around the Red fire dragon burst out, containing a berserk Sun madness fire that penetrated Zhu Haiprofound’s chest in an instant, a powerful flame energy exploded out, exploding and rampaging within Zhu Haiprofound’s body.

Zhu Haiprofound screamed miserably, as Ji Xingyuan’s figure also appeared in his mind. Because, back then, Ji Xingyuan was also a person, he knew this person, knew this name. At that time, he only thought that it was okay to kill him, he never thought that there would be someone who would take revenge for Ji Xingyuan.

But now, he died because of it. This kind of death was so sudden, so sudden that he was completely unprepared, the kind of nostalgia towards the world before he died made him feel extremely unreconciled. He talked about the son of a great clan’s elder, his status was honorable, above tens of thousands of people, but now he was going to die!

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!

Zhu Haiprofound’s body was engulfed by the flames and turned into ashes and scattered. Chen Xiang brought Qin Shuang into the Six Realms mirrors and hid himself.
