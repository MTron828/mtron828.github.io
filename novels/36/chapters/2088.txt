Zhu Rong was extremely calm as he walked up the stage. Through Yun Xiaodao’s battle just now, Zhu Rong knew that he had to guard against Chen Xiang, but he was still a little worried. This was because Chen Xiang had analyzed Yun Xiaodao’s tactics to him.

Chen Xiang only had four Divine Deity, so Zhu Rong had two more than him. Therefore, Zhu Rong felt that he had a great advantage in this area, and due to Chen Xiang’s lack of Divine Deity, it was very difficult for him to make up for it with other aspects. At least, he had met opponents with fewer Divine Deity before, who were basically all killed by him in an instant. Therefore, he naturally believed that Chen Xiang definitely did not have much power to deal with him.

"I wonder what will happen. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen Chen Xiang, can he still create such a shocking miracle like back then?" Devil-killing Heavenly God said: "He’s the only one who can comprehend my Seven devil-slain kungfu."

"Zhu Rong is also quite strong. Don’t just look at his glib tongue, he is also very fierce in battle." Gu Dongchen laughed: "Of course, since Chen Xiang is so calm now, he shouldn’t be too weak."

Zhu Rong said: "Chen Xiang, you cannot play any tricks, this is a fair and square battle." He felt that if Chen Xiang tried to play tricks, he wouldn’t have much of a chance of winning.

Chen Xiang laughed: "Never play tricks."

"Begin!" an old man below the stage suddenly shouted.

Zhu Rong was the first to make a move. The moment his feet moved, a water vine suddenly appeared and wrapped around his feet! But Zhu Rong’s reaction was extremely fast, with a loud roar, he channeled some energy into his legs, and instantly shattered the water vines Chen Xiang had released.

At the same time, Chen Xiang came over to Zhu Rong’s side and kicked at Zhu Rong’s bulging stomach!

Although Zhu Rong was fat, he was still a fatty who was unbelievably fast. When Chen Xiang kicked him out, he quickly turned his body to the side and shrunk his stomach, and after dodging Chen Xiang’s kick, his fist shone with an azure light. He turned into a dragon head of fist force and roared as he rushed towards Chen Xiang.

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!

The fist force had not even reached Chen Xiang when it suddenly exploded, producing a burst of astral lightning that engulfed Chen Xiang. Chen Xiang did not expect that he would suddenly explode just as he was about to dodge the fist force, the sudden gale that enveloped him caused him to feel a bit of pain all around him that was green in color.

"Haha ..." Zhu Rong suddenly laughed out loud, and rushed towards Chen Xiang with both of his fists dragging a green rainbow in the air, releasing a very terrifying Profound Spirit Qi, the Mysterious power that kept on bursting out from his fists, was like a dragon’s roar, with an imposing manner that was extremely terrifying.

At this time, Zhu Rong’s entire body was bursting with violent energy, while he was running, he stomped on the ground, causing it to shake greatly, and even the floor that had protection from the array formation was destroyed by him.

Very quickly, he arrived in front of Chen Xiang, who was entangled by the gale and gale, and rammed his two fists onto Chen Xiang’s face and chest.

"Don’t be complacent."

Both of Chen Xiang’s hands swung out and lightly slapped onto Zhu Rong’s fists. With a "pa la" sound, lightning struck in succession, and when his fists collided with Zhu Rong’s fists, a burst of piercing purple light shone out, while Zhu Rong was also pushed back by his strength.

Zhu Rong’s previous two moves had already exceeded his estimate of Chen Xiang’s strength, but just as he was about to attack, he realized that Chen Xiang was not in his grasp. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"It’s here!" Chen Xiang’s laughter came over, Zhu Rong anxiously looked to the left, at the same time throwing out a palm attack, the palm image that was accompanied by a berserk green astral wind enveloped over.

However, Chen Xiang was not in that direction, but was behind him. Chen Xiang’s palm had slapped onto Zhu Rong’s back, and this palm seemed to not be too painful or itchy, causing everyone to feel that Chen Xiang had missed a good opportunity.

But after Zhu Rong was gently hit by the palm, he felt that his upper body was a bit stiff, as if his Bones was frozen solid.

Zhu Rong scolded in his heart. He had always thought that since Chen Xiang was refining pills, his usage of the cold energy must be very weak. He never thought that it would actually be so powerful.

Chen Xiang had used a Bones technique, the Cold Moon Divine Power that Yue’er had taught him!

Zhu Rong now clearly understood that even though Chen Xiang had four Divine Deity, the power he was displaying was extremely terrifying, and he was even much stronger than him. He was already starting to panic, and anxiously turned around, wanting to fiercely retaliate, but he realized that he had become much more slow.

Zhu Rong sighed in his heart, his movements had already become much slower, but it was fatal for him, and no one knew why the sensitive Zhu Rong had suddenly slowed down!

"Old Pig, is that all you’ve got?" While Chen Xiang was speaking, a fist had already struck towards Zhu Rong’s fat face.

Chen Xiang’s fist had just arrived but he could already feel that terrifying scorching energy. Just now, Chen Xiang was still using the Icy cold power, and in just a blink of an eye, he was already using the heat of the flames. Wasn’t this switch a little too quickly?

This was the Meteor immortal power that Chen Xiang had learned. He channeled the six divine powers, and like a meteor, fiercely crashed into the inside of his Bones, releasing a scorching, explosive force.

The fist landed on Zhu Rong’s face!

Bang! With a loud explosion, Zhu Rong’s face also lit up with a burst of flame, after that, he flew out of the ground, and in the blink of an eye, flew towards the stage, colliding into the stone wall at the side of the plaza that released the news, creating a huge hole.

The loud explosion from that fist just now was still reverberating far away in the sky when Chen Xiang’s fist turned red and emitted a bit of heat.

"This... Is this an old pig that I know!? " He was already stupefied by the large hole in the stone wall that Yun Xiaodao had made in the distance. Chen Xiang seemed to be extremely relaxed as he knocked down Zhu Rong, who was the strongest in their group, just like that.

Zhu Rong crawled up from the pile of rubble. His face was swollen and red, like half of a pig head. He himself did not know what had happened, but he felt that after feeling the frightening power of Chen Xiang’s fist, his mind had turned blank.

Wu Kaiming took a deep breath and asked Devil-killing Heavenly God beside him: "What was that punch Chen Xiang threw just now? Is that power something the Four Divine Deity possess? "

Devil-killing Heavenly God was also unable to answer and he was also very shocked: "I don’t know, but it can be seen that his fist strike earlier used his left hand. If I’m not mistaken, it should be a part of his body that possesses Bones."

Chen Xiang’s left arm possessed two Divine Deity s and an extremely terrifying divine beast’s divine soul. Adding to that sea of six divine powers, the power he produced was not a joke.

"Chen Xiang wins!"

Chen Xiang walked down from the arena and walked to the left side with a smile. Zhu Rong was still sitting on the ground in a daze.
