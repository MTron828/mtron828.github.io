"If you don’t fuse with mine, how many drops would you need?" Chen Xiang asked anxiously.

"Over a thousand drops. What about you?" Lv Qilian asked, because it was rare for both of them to be able to condense such a miraculous liquid, and even fuse together.

"I don’t remember. In short, I need at least a month." Chen Xiang said: "What is yours is the genuine one, so it is much faster than me. You can make more than a thousand drops and finish it in a few days.

"It will be completed in three days." Lv Qilian said.

took in a deep breath. Now that he knew how many medicinal ingredients Lv Qilian had, it was no wonder why her Hundreds of Flowers Palace was so powerful.

"But now, I can complete it in two hours. The spirit liquid you condensed must have something special about it. It’s not as different as before I fused it with you, but after I fused it it it’s shortened by so much." Lv Qilian said.

Chen Xiang thought for a while, then said: "It might be related to my physique, this is my secret, I cannot say more."

Then, Chen Xiang laughed: "These are all things that we condensed from our mouths, don’t you think it’s the equivalent of us kissing indirectly?"

When Lv Qilian heard this, her jade face suddenly flushed red, and she snorted lightly: "If your mouth isn’t that cheap, then you’re not a bad person."

Little Lizhi didn’t know why, but she suddenly had the urge to laugh, but she didn’t laugh, so she couldn’t hide the smile on her face.

"We’ll work together to get more Drunk god magical poison. That Wild Lion Emperor, it’s precisely because he drank a big bowl of this stuff that he’s softer than cotton." Chen Xiang chuckled.

"Leave everything to me." Lv Qilian said.

Chen Xiang gave his own creation divine liquid to Lv Qilian, but he didn’t have much left either. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Go ahead, Little Lizhi and I still have other things to do." Chen Xiang said.

"What are you doing?" Little Lizhi asked.

"Help me pick out these Heavenly Beast Pills and place them in a pile." Chen Xiang took out a huge pile of Heaven Beast Pills, all of which he had accumulated for many years.

There were a total of hundreds of them, causing Lv Qilian and Little Lizhi to be secretly speechless. Especially those Heaven Pills, which required one to kill a few Immortal Kings to obtain. There were even some even more powerful Beast Pills.

"What are you doing?" Lv Qilian saw Chen Xiang taking out all these things, and asked in shock: "You want to use these to increase your strength, that’s not good, right?"

Chen Xiang said: "Of course not, using these things to raise my strength is definitely not good. I am a Alchemist, so of course I use pills to increase my strength. I want to use these Beast Pills to create a terrifying object, just in case."

He took out the beast core from the Wild Lion Emperor inside the divine cauldron and said to Little Lizhi: "Let’s start to pick."

"What are you refining?" Lv Qilian was very curious.

"The Destruction Heavenly Pill is the kind of pill that would explode if thrown out, but if one is too weak, I want more of them to fuse together. Only then would the power be great, and the compression would be very small. While the other party isn’t paying attention, I’ll stuff them into their mouths, haha." Seeing Chen Xiang’s mischievous smile, Little Lizhi and Lv Qilian could not help but shiver.

When self-destructing, it was usually just self-detonating heavenly pills. The power of these pills was great, after fusing together, they would be compressed to a small degree to raise the quality of the energy and then thrown into someone else’s mouth. Just thinking about it would be terrifying.

The refining process sounded simple, but it was extremely difficult. Little Lizhi and Lv Qilian were also very clear that the energy within the Heaven Pellet Beast Pill was already very violent, and had mutually repelled each other. If they were to fuse multiple pellets and compress them, it could be said to be extremely difficult.

"Their abilities are quite easy to fuse together."

Chen Xiang seemed to be very experienced, he picked out a pile of the things and threw them into the divine cauldron, while he placed the Wild Lion Emperor’s corpse inside the ring, giving it to Long Xueyi to deal with. That was the corpse of a Holy Beast, other than its flesh and blood being poisoned, the bones and the Holy Armor outside were all extremely valuable and useless.

"This pile is the weaker one." Little Lizhi said.

"There’s actually so many of them, and quite a few of them are immortal kings. How disappointing. The immortal king only has a tiny bit of power left." Chen Xiang grabbed one of them, which was very small, and discovered that there were more than a hundred of them in the pile.

Lv Qilian and Little Lizhi immediately suspected that Chen Xiang’s Sky Pellet was definitely very strong, there might even be more than one. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so powerful.

Chen Xiang placed all those Heaven Pills into the divine furnace. Even if it exploded inside the divine furnace, there would not be much reaction.

If it was anyone else, it would be very difficult to obtain, but he had mastered Heavenly Alchemy, so refining this kind of thing was like a normal occurrence for him, he had refined countless mountains and swallowed a large amount of land to refine pills.

It was not the White Tiger that warned him not to continue. It was likely that many continents had been refined by him, so he would definitely be punished by the heavens.

The treasure in Chen Xiang’s hands also made Lv Qilian jealous, especially the divine cauldron, it could be used for defense, attacking, refining medicinal pills for Divine Weapons, and it could also be used to store things. If necessary, it could even capture powerful beasts or seal people inside it.

"Do you want to take it away?" Chen Xiang, who was seriously refining the Destroying Sky Pill, suddenly turned his head and smiled at Lv Qilian.

"Yes." Lv Qilian said: "But it’s not easy."

Chen Xiang laughed: "Of course, whoever steals from me, I will fight with their life on the line. I can still remember the matter of the Thunder Tao Double Venerables, they stole my Leihun fruit."

"I’m really sorry about that." Lv Qilian said softly, "I didn’t think that it would affect your friends."

"Forget it, I just hope that Thunder Tao Double Venerables is still alive and going back. I want to hide back my Leihun fruit with my own hands." Chen Xiang said.

"The Leihun fruit has already been merged by Zheng Rong." Lv Qilian said: "You should still have more."

When he thought about how Chen Xiang could possess a large number of Leihun fruit, Lv Qilian’s heart trembled again. The hidden potential of Chen Xiang was truly terrifying.

"It doesn’t matter, I have a way to get it back." Chen Xiang opened the lid of the divine furnace and took out a small golden ball.

Little Lizhi had seen Chen Xiang draw Fire Soul before, she had no doubts about it, but she had never mentioned these things to Lv Qilian, because she had promised Chen Xiang.

With just a glance, it was obvious that he often did this sort of thing. Lv Qilian and Little Lizhi were both thinking about just how many times Chen Xiang had used this kind of Heaven Decimating Pellet on other people.
