After Du Xiaoling finished crying, her eyes were slightly red. Seeing a man crying like that made Du Xiaoling a little shy. She slightly lowered her head and wiped her tears away.

"You must be joking!" Du Xiaoling said in a low voice.

"It’s fine, I can understand it. It’s fine as long as you’ve cried!" Chen Xiang laughed: "I will leave Sister Bai Ling with you right now, I will bring my wife here, and let her see if she can help you remove your control over the heavens."

"Mn, Ziqian is back, I will make her wait for you here, I will take good care of Bai Ling." Du Xiaoling hurriedly nodded, looking just like a cute little girl.

Chen Xiang left the Beast Wasteland and returned to the Hundreds of Flowers Village.

"Heaven Poison Divine Spirit is not a thing, he actually called a girl like that Old Man." Chen Xiang despised Natural Law Divine Spirit very much.

Now, he felt that the Heaven Poison Divine Spirit was extremely pitiful. She herself was a kind-hearted person, but being forced to do evil things and kill people, no matter how he looked at it, this was just like a kind curse.

Du Xiaoling could not commit suicide either. She could not even die here, and just thinking about it made Chen Xiang feel extremely sad. At the same time, he felt that the Heavenly Dao was extremely heartless.

Chen Xiang returned to the Hundreds of Flowers Village very quickly. At the moment, Xu Youqing was discussing with Liu Meng’er and the others how to set up the Cursed Slaughtering Formation.

"Even the Little Naughty Dragon, this lazy guy, is so excited to train. How rare!" Chen Xiang was currently in a garden, Yue’er and Shui Bingyan were also there.

Shui Bingyan and Xiao Jin’er were currently stepping on nectar in the flowers. Even though the two girls had very charming and charming appearances, they were kind of pure girls that were as beautiful as water.

"Jin’er, you are the undying god of war in the Undead Divine Race, do you have any thoughts of fighting?" Chen Xiang looked at Xiao Jin’er’s charming and beautiful face and could not help but touch it.

Xiao Jin’er shook his head and said: "No, my mother asked me too, but I don’t know why I’m fighting, but I feel a surge of power. My mother brought me to see Yue’er’s grandmother, she taught me how to use this power."

Yue’er’s grandmother was currently the patriarch of Heavenly Dragon City, and Yue’er had mentioned to her that her grandmother was currently thinking of a way to deal with that Undead Divine Race who had fallen into depravity.

Although he had a strong power, he did not need to do things that he did not like to do, unlike Du Xiaoling, the Heaven Poison Divine Spirit.

"Jin’er, what’s your mother doing now?" Xiao Jin’er asked. Xiao Jin’er’s mother was a Imperial Concubine Lian, and she was born and bred using the Undead Divine Race’s special ability, so her background was very special.

"She and Sister Yu Lan are together. They are all part of the wargod team right now, so I rarely see them." Xiao Jin’er picked the flowers as she spoke.

Xiao Yulan, Xiao Hongque, Imperial Concubine Lian, and the others were originally together.

Chen Xiang started to think about Xiao Baifeng and Little Lizhi. The two of them had the same personality and the same looks as them, he only wanted to tease them, he felt that this kind of woman was especially fun to tease.

Shui Bingyan and Xiao Jin’er would pinch their faces from time to time, they too felt that this was a sign of concern. In their eyes, Chen Xiang was their very dear brother.

"Little Scoundrel, what business do you have with me?" Xu Youqing had finished busying herself, she knew that Chen Xiang was here, she had heard Chen Xiang and Shui Bingyan’s laughter from far away.

"Are you going to be busy next?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Is it important?" Xu Youqing said: "Not too busy!"

"Then come with me for a few days!" Chen Xiang wanted to bring Xu Youqing to find Du Xiaoling.

"Alright!" Xu Youqing walked over, smiled at Shui Bingyan and the others, and then patted their faces. "Remember to leave a portion for me when making the fruit juice for the snacks, don’t let those gluttons finish it."

"Got it, Sister Yuqing!" Xiao Jin’er hurriedly nodded and smiled sweetly at Xu Youqing.

Long Xueyi and Mu Qianxiang were both very edible eaters, upon hearing Xu Youqing’s words, Chen Xiang immediately thought of these two weirdos.

... ....

Xu Youqing entered the You Yao Mountain Villa and saw Bai Youyou there. He could not help but be shocked.

"You You, you’re here too!" Xu Youqing smiled at Bai Youyou. She had stayed in Hundreds of Flowers Village for such a long time, so she naturally knew how important Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao were to her.

However, later on, she heard rumors that Bai Youyou and Chen Xiang were very rarely together. It had been a long time, and they had not gotten into that kind of intimate relationship, but she had heard Su Meiyao say that he would kiss Bai Youyou on the mouth.

"Yeah, I originally wanted him to help me find my sister, but now that I’ve almost found her, something happened and I need your help." Bai Youyou said, and she revealed a cold and beautiful smile to Xu Youqing.

After that, Bai Youyou told Xu Youqing about Du Xiaoling.

"I have to go and find out whether or not I can help her. I hope so. What a pitiful woman." After Xu Youqing came to understand the situation, he also sympathized with her.

"You You, your sister seems to be more solitary than you. No wonder you are so worried about her all day." Xu Youqing said.

Although Sister Qinlian is also using poison, but Sister Qinlian’s poison is contained, and her poison can easily leak out, that’s why she stayed away from us, worried that she would harm us. "Su Yun said in a low voice. Bai Youyou sighed lightly: "The reason she is following Heaven Poison Divine Spirit in cultivation now, should be because she wants to change this situation."

"Even so, I have always treated her as a good sister. She will forever be a member of our Hundreds of Flowers Village." Xu Youqing laughed.

"Mm, thank you!" Bai Youyou had gotten along well with the girls in the Hundreds of Flowers Village, and now that they had met, Chen Xiang could tell.

"You You, your Big Sister Ziqian doesn’t like this little scoundrel, right? When I asked Ziqian about the little scoundrel last time, she was very responsive. " Xu Youqing asked. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

"Of course not, my sister is on good terms with that little scoundrel!" Bai Youyou laughed sinisterly: "Many of the women in Hundreds of Flowers Village may not know, but even if they do, they will not say much. Because my sister has a weird temper, I am worried that I will anger her."

"What?" Ziqian actually has a very good relationship with that little scoundrel! " Xu Youqing did not know about this matter, she had even thought that she knew a lot about the things in Hundreds of Flowers Village.

However, she did know that the relationship between Lv Qinlian and Yue’er was very good, and Yue’er had said so because the poison in Lv Qinlian’s body was extremely effective on Chen Xiang.

Although they were chatting at You Yao Mountain Villa, they had sealed themselves so that Chen Xiang wouldn’t be able to hear them. That was why Chen Xiang didn’t know about the two girls talking about him.

Chen Xiang had already arrived at Du Xiaoling’s residence.
