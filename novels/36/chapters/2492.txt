Chen Xiang faintly felt that Xia Bailing and the others, as the three Dao Sovereigns from the book, had been punished by some kind of power on purpose.

"Sister Bai Ling, could this be done by the Heavenly Dao?" Chen Xiang asked.

"I don’t know. The Heavenly Dao is a very mysterious existence ..." I don’t think he did it, but it’s very likely that the rules he set worked! Or perhaps the law of the heavens has mutated, which is why our city is punished. "YBdu." Xia Bailing said: "I had frequently discussed this matter with the Azure Sky Sun in the past, but I did not get any results. I have not mentioned it ever since."

Chen Xiang allowed the Six Realms mirrors to fly a little higher. Although this place was filled with terrifying death poison, Chen Xiang was still cautious about what was hidden inside.

"Is your father really up here?" Xia Bailing asked.

"It should be!" Chen Xiang sighed, because the situation on the island was not looking good, and danger was everywhere.

"You don’t have to worry too much. I also survived in this kind of environment." Xia Bailing laughed. She also felt like she had lost her family, so she was also comforting Chen Xiang right now.

"En!" Chen Xiang nodded, he did not know how to start searching this place, this place was so huge, it was equivalent to a huge continent.

But no matter how big it was, as long as he did not have any news on Shen Tianhu, he would not leave this place.

"Sister Bai Ling, how did the two Dao Sovereigns Qing Yang and Xu Kong survive in such an environment all those years ago?" Chen Xiang asked: "Perhaps we can look for my father using their methods."

Xia Bailing had the power of space, she could protect herself, and could even isolate herself from space.

"Void said that he survived by hiding underground because he had a special ability, which was to make himself appear hollow and then drill into the ground. He said that there were no effects on the underground." Xia Bailing said: "Yet Qingyang was hiding inside a clock, not corroded by the death poison."

When Xia Bailing talked about going underground, Chen Xiang’s eyes lit up. This was indeed a better idea, he immediately controlled the Six Realms mirrors to fly faster and wander in the air. At the same time, he used the Dao heart Eye to check the ground to see if he could find anything.

This island could be considered an independent world, and he felt that there would definitely be something similar to a core. Otherwise, it would be impossible to maintain the existence of this island.

After half a day, Chen Xiang saw a place that emitted traces of a red mist, it was extremely thin, but this was the only energy that he had seen up till now. It seemed to be of the fire attribute, and could only be seen after careful observation using the Dao heart Eye.

"I saw something. Why is there a fire attribute aura coming out of that place?" Chen Xiang immediately flew over, this would allow him to sense things more carefully.

"What is it?" Xia Bailing could not see anything, and she did not know that Chen Xiang had an extremely mystical Dao heart Eye.

"It is the fire attribute aura that has emerged from the ground. Did this happen after your previous city was struck by the poison?" Chen Xiang asked.

"No, after encountering the poison, there wouldn’t even be spiritual energy. This deadly poison absorbs spiritual energy from the heaven and earth to continuously spread the poison. The rate at which it devours spiritual energy is extremely terrifying!" As long as a person is touched by a small dot, he or she will be immediately devoured to death, and that drop of venom will become a lot more numerous as well, then turn into mist and dissipate. As long as someone touches something, they will immediately be devoured. "

"How terrifying!" Chen Xiang exclaimed: "In that case, if there was even a tiny bit that leaked out, wouldn’t that mean that many living creatures would die?"

"Mm, that’s for sure, so when you go out, you can’t bring any!" Xia Bailing said: "So this kind of poison punishment is very mysterious, the places it appears in will always be wrapped up by a very powerful barrier, and won’t let the death poison inside leak out."

"How terrifying!" Chen Xiang could imagine that if a single drop of it were to flow out and come into contact with any rocks, flowers, trees or the like, it would turn into even more deadly poison aura, and then spread outwards. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Chen Xiang was now even more shocked by his own body. He couldn’t understand why he could resist such a dreadful death poison, since his impenetrable was cultivated a long time ago and at that time, he could only resist the poison in his world.

That kind of poison was nothing to the current Octoterra’s body, so he didn’t think that his impenetrable would have much of an effect. After all, the poison in the Octoterra was a lot more terrifying than the ones he had seen in the past. But he never thought that he would still have the same impenetrable as before.

When Chen Xiang approached the place where the fire attribute Qi leaked out, he realized that there was a lot of fire attribute energy that kept coming out from below, but because the dead poison’s devouring ability was strong, the energy that leaked out was extremely sparse. If not for Chen Xiang’s careful observation earlier, he wouldn’t have been able to notice it.

Chen Xiang immediately used the God’s Eye Dao mark and allowed the God’s Eye Dao mark to work with the White Tiger’s Dao mark. He could see a lot of things through the air, he followed the ground that was releasing the fire type Qi and went down, discovering that there was an extremely dense fire type energy flowing out from there.

As he went deeper, he discovered that there was a river in the depths. However, this river was filled with Flame Essence!

"The earth’s core, there really is a earth’s core here!" Chen Xiang was overjoyed, this meant that his father was probably underneath there many times.

He immediately used teleportation to arrive at the flow of the lava!

This Flame Essence was rather special. It wasn’t very viscous, but it was indeed fiery red in color. Moreover, it was relatively light, as if the Flame Essence had fused with some other special liquid.

"Where to?" Chen Xiang didn’t move at all at this moment. Whose fire essence was flowing with him at a fast speed.

"Is it hot?" Xia Bailing asked: "I also want to go down and take a breather!"

"It’s just a little hot, you’d better not come down. It’ll be very dangerous if the deadly poison comes out of nowhere." Chen Xiang laughed.

Chen Xiang had been to the Core of the Earth before, so he was relatively experienced in this area. Right now, he had already dived into the Fire River to prevent other creatures from seeing him.

More than two hours later, he suddenly heard a sound. It was someone speaking!

"Hurry up and catch the fire beasts. If we can’t, we’ll be beaten up again when we go back." A person said.

"We really have a bitter life. We just didn’t make any mistakes. Isn’t it just because we looked at that young master?" "He was actually caught and turned into a slave."

"Let’s not talk about it anymore. If the supervisors hear it, there will definitely be a flogging!"

Chen Xiang could even hear the "ding ding dang dang" sound of iron chains clanging against each other. There were a lot of people by the side of the river, they were all tied up with iron chains.

Chen Xiang immediately turned into a strand of faint mist and floated in the air. He did not expect that the Fire River of Fire would have already brought him to an underground world.

It was very bright here, but unlike the sunlight on the ground, the river of fire was very wide. On both sides were trees with a strong fire attribute aura, and on the shore, there were over a hundred people chained together.
