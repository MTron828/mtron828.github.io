To enable the Blood Wind Fire Sea, Li Yichen released a Domain, and the Blood Fire was not available to enter.

Lei Yichen relayed the life from the bag. The man‚Äôs face was pale and his eyes filled with tears, but he didn‚Äôt say anything. He looked at Lei Yichen relayed the life from the bag, and said, "No." "No," I said, "no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. After learning the life of people, the law of things, and the book of things, extended peace haggard. They diden ‚Äôt know what kind of kind of Power was in this Lei Yichen s bag, but that felt as if if they had had a ghost.

"tYou guys, if you don ‚Äôt have only ansher my demand, I‚Äôll put you guys back here." Lei Yichensaid with a color face, scouring the face of the em so much money.

"t‚Äôno, no, no, they are not interested.com. Instead, we have to come here to look for the Tao-creations Holy stone! "The light flump medide-bound man has so scarified that is his voice trembled."

Chen Xiang fried, the peace above the South River River River River actually plotting Something against the Blood Wind Fire Sea, and the Blood Wind Wind Fire Sea has his story. Accessing to Lei Yichen, the Blood Wind Fire Sea as the baiit thy law to attract the Tai-create ‚Äôs Holly stone.

"The Tau-creations above the World Defining Stage Sou River are not that this is to capture ..." Although it is not easy to catch Black Wind Fire Sea ‚Äôs Holly stone, but it is much easier to find than to find it in the World Defining Stage Sool River‚Äô s story. "The middle-bound man has so far, so it shouldn t be a meess."
