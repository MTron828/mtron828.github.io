Shen Xiang grabbed a large number of Violent Soul from the World Defying Soul River. The Violent World Defying Soul on the first floor was the most easily crawled. He just grabbed a hand and made thousands of them. Then he Eat the next Violent Transformation Divine Pill and keep your spirit in the World Defying Soul River.

“Shen Xiang, don’t worry, ten thousand Violent World Defying Soul is so easy to get? Even if our Soul River God Clan’s real body goes to World Defying Soul River, it takes 10 million Violent World Defying Soul Some time, you eat Violent Transformation Divine Pill here, let the spirit enter the World Defying Soul River, and want to catch 10,000 Violent Soul? It’s crazy to dream, whimsical.”

“Don’t waste our time, even if you can get 10,000 Violent Soul, that’s a lot of years!”

Feeling that these people are coming back, Shen Xiang opens his eyes, said with a sneer: “Let you wait!”

After that, he had a stretch of arms and saw countless spots suddenly appeared!

Countless spots are suspended in the lobby, flying like fireflies, and people familiar with Violent World Defying Soul can recognize them at a glance!

Although it is only a layer of Violent World Defying Soul, it is enough to refine the soul of the Holy Land!

Violent Soul is a lot of small light points, everyone does not count, even if only a few thousand Violent Soul, it is very good.

“Now you see it, this is the Violent World Defying Soul I caught with the secret method!” Shen Xiang said: “My Soul Defying Saint Pill is made with Violent World Defying Soul.”

Ancient Fire God Sect’s elder stunned, and they now know that Violent World Defying Soul is not easy to catch, and I don’t know why, but Shen Xiang can release tens of thousands of times.

What surprised them the most is that Shen Xiang can really make Soul Defying Saint Pill!

The quality of Soul Defying Saint Pill is indeed higher than that of Soul Defying. If Shen Xiang can provide them with Soul Defying Saint Pill every day, their Ancient Fire God Sect will not have any concerns in the future.

“This…this must be where you got it, and you can only fool us for a while.” The old man of Violent Blade Clan looked at Dean of Ancient Fire God Sect and said, “Don’t listen to him. Shen Xiang This guy is scheming. Now he just wants to get out and show some tricks! Everyone who is sitting is the late stage of World Defying Sacred Realm and even the expert of the peak. You can ask yourself, you can get so many so easily. Violent World Defying Soul?”

“That’s why neither Violent Blade Clan nor Soul River God Clan! Not to mention Shen Xiang, the little rascal of Violent World Defying Realm, his words are not credible!”

Lei Yichen absolutely believes Shen Xiang, he loudly said: “Dean, Shen Xiang is the discipline of Ancient Fire God Sect, I am the elder of Ancient Fire God Sect, don’t you even believe in yourself, but believe in outsiders?”

Dean of Ancient Fire God Sect thought about it and said, “Shen Xiang, you really can’t prove that you have the ability to refine Soul Defying Saint Pill!”

“Well, Ancient Fire God Sect really disappoints me! If Gu Tong Old Ancestor is there, he will never say these words, and only your stupid pigs will be so easy to believe in Violent Blade Clan and Soul River God Clan. “Shen Xiang’s voice is cold and full of ridicule.

He proved himself twice and twice, just to help Ancient Fire God Sect get through the storm, but now, Dean and other elders are so pedantic, he feels that he is really passionate.

Lei Yichen heard Shen Xiang’s words and knew Shen Xiang’s meaning!

“Okay, catch Shen Xiang!” An elder slam of Violent Blade Clan rushed up.

“Master, you dragged this group of old fellows!” Shen Xiang’s face suddenly became gloomy and cold, giving Lei Yichen sound transmission.

Lei Yichen saw several Violent Blade Clan and Soul River God Clan’s old man rushing up and summoning a long knife, said solemnly: “I am fighting with you!”

Several old men know that Lei Yichen is difficult to deal with, so they plan to win Lei Yichen first.

Ancient Fire God Sect is not a fight, they have already said it before, so only Violent Blade Clan and Soul River God Clan people fight.

“Little people, you should catch Shen Xiang, don’t be afraid of him. He is just Violent World Defying Realm. The strongest World Defying Sacred Realm initial stage among you, most of them is the peak of World Defying Sacred Realm. It is only a breeze to win him. Said Elder of a Violent Blade Clan.

Lei Yichen waved a long knife and spurred Saint World Defying force, causing his long knife to vibrate, several old men to surround him, and they also released a strong Saint World Defying force, wanting to ban the maddening Yi Yichen.

Shen Xiang here, more than a dozen powerful young people rushed toward him, they have a disdainful smile on their faces, they also feel that it is very easy to take Shen Xiang. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“To be honest, hand over the crystal emperor!” A man said with a sneer, they surrounded Shen Xiang in the middle, when Shen Xiang was unable to fly.

Shen Xiang looked at all around and said, “You want crystal emperor, right? I will give you that’s it!”

The juniors were happy, but Shen Xiang was not so honest.

They only saw Shen Xiang take out a round thing that looks like a bronze. This is the Divine Mirror of Six Paths that Shen Xiang has transformed Lei Yichen.

“Open!” Shen Xiang controls the Divine Mirror of Six Paths, releasing a banned formation that shackles all the juniors around him.

The Divine Mirror of Six Paths floated over the top of Shen Xiang’s, with the mirror facing down, releasing a touch of golden light, and the Divine Mirror of Six Paths also became larger.

Seeing this bronze, the Old Lady suddenly in front of Qin Shuang opened his eyes and was surprised: “Gu Tong’s World Defying divine tool !”

The Dean of Ancient Fire God Sect and the other elders of Ancient Fire God Sect are also shocked. The breath of Shen Xiang’s Divine Mirror of Six Paths has been shaped, and it looks like Gu Tong’s own refining World. Defying divine tool !

Shen Xiang released Divine Mirror of Six Paths After the juniors were banned, the Dean and Elder of Ancient Fire God Sect had a bad feeling, and they didn’t know what Shen Xiang’s Divine Mirror of Six Paths had.

And the next moment, they know what Shen Xiang is doing!

After those juniors couldn’t move, Shen Xiang called Nine Firmaments Divine Sword. Like a mowing, a sword killed all the juniors around, and then let Divine Mirror of Six Paths release a violent flame and burn the body!

All of this happened in the moment of electro-optical sparks, which made it difficult to react, because no one expected that Shen Xiang would release Divine Mirror of Six Paths, and then kill all the juniors in the next moment!

When Shen Xiang came out of the sword, the release of Saint World Defying was very violent, and everyone suddenly realized that Shen Xiang had stepped into World Defying Sacred Realm!

The young World Defying Sacred Realm, knowing alchemy, mastering the crystal emperor, has a lot of Violent Soul… This is a promising young man. The Dean suddenly of Ancient Fire God Sect has some regrets, he thinks it should be Keep Shen Xiang’s.

“Shen Xiang… kill him!” Violent Blade Clan’s elder eyes red, and Lee Yichen didn’t want to, immediately rushed to Shen Xiang, but he was also cut by Lei Yichen.

Lei Yichen did not expect that Shen Xiang unexpectedly was so brave that all the juniors of Soul River God Clan and Violent Blade Clan were killed.
