CHAPTER 399 – FRIGHTENING THE KINGS

Having witnessed Chen Xiang giving true effort, Wu Kaiming started to frown. He had long guessed that it would be difficult for Chen Xiang to hide his true strength. At such a critical juncture, of course, he was happy, however, he was also a little worried that Chen Xiang would start ruthlessly and would cripple the middle-aged man, by then it would forge a hatred with the Kings’ Mainland.

A dazzling azure aura appeared around Chen Xiang’s fist as lightning which was as thick as a snake shot out from within, whereupon, dazzling flashes of lightning radiated in every direction before covering the entire martial stage in an azure light.

At this instant, Chen Xiang had unleashed the strongest Azure Dragon True Qi which contained a very overbearing lightning energy that gathered around Chen Xiang’s fists.

The middle-aged man himself was a user of lightning power. He could see that the lightning power unleashed by Chen Xiang was a lot stronger than his. Before he took the stage, Wang Quan had told him that Chen Xiang was just a little devil who had recently stepped into the Extreme State, and there was no need to be afraid of him, he could beat him as he wished without any worry.

However, now, the middle-aged was secretly cursing Wang Quan. Where was Chen Xiang just a little devil, he was simply a devil god! Take the Slaughter Qi released by Chen Xiang for instance, it already made him feel afraid.

The middle-aged man was someone who had entered the Extreme State, he was also not someone who could be trifled with easily. Although he was momentarily afraid, he could only unleash his strongest power and compete with Chen Xiang.

Step by step, Chen Xiang gradually walked over, whereas, the middle-aged man let out a roar as electric aura once again surged out from his giant fists. However, it was far inferior as compared to that of Chen Xiang.

The middle-aged man sent a very fast punch, so fast that it seemed that a lightning was piercing through the air. When the punch with this kind of speed and power suddenly clashed with air, it burst forth with a sonic boom as it rumbled towards Chen Xiang’s nose.

The punch was fast as well as unleashed with a very rich True Qi which gave burst to a tremendously strong power. Chen Xiang was competing with someone who was in Extreme State just like him for the first time, which made him very excited. He admitted that the opponent was very strong, if he had not entered the Extreme State and encountered such a person, perhaps he was doomed to be miserably defeated.

“It’s a bit slow!”

Chen Xiang extended his hand as he grabbed the middle-aged man’s fist before he vigorously squeezed as a peal of thunder reverberated the entire field which was followed by howls of the middle-aged man as Chen Xiang sent a punch while he was wrapped in a thick Lightning True Qi that suddenly transformed into a dragon head and his arm transformed into that of a dragon before that menacing punch struck the middle-aged man’s chin.

In this moment, everyone saw as though a small dragon that had lightning wrapped around its entire body charging towards the middle-aged man. Witnessing this kind of power, Gu Dongchen and the others could not help but shudder. If he was so powerful in the Extreme State, when he would step into the Nirvana Realm, perhaps they would be unable to win against Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang had a very rich battle experience. In the sinkhole at the forbidden area, he had to deal with various kinds of attack of Huang Jintian often, whereas, Huang Jintian in his youth had challenged everyone everywhere, moreover, he also had Five Elements True Qi, thereby he could simulate many battle styles according to his memory to fight with Chen Xiang.

When Chen Xiang fought with Huang Jintian, the attack he had to face was a lot, lot faster. Therefore, the middle-aged man’s speed appeared to be a lot slower in his eyes. He was already accustomed to Huang Jintian’s high-speed attack. And although he often had been able to dodge, at the end of the day, he would still be beaten by an even faster attack.

Just a punch from Chen Xiang had made the middle-aged man retreat several steps, while his head was cocked to the other side and blood was flowing from the corner of his mouth! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

What made everyone feel odd was that the middle-aged man had azure lightning crackling all over his body. To everyone’s dismay, Chen Xiang’s lightning power was crackling over the middle-aged man’s body. It was quite clear that Chen Xiang’s punch was infused with a lot of lightning power, which, in the blink of an eye, was blasted into the middle-aged man’s body.

The middle-aged man had been hit on the head with that kind of power, one could imagine what kind of damage he had suffered!

“You can’t even withstand a punch?” Chen Xiang sneered. Whereas, the middle-aged man was incessantly furious. He struggled to twist his head back, but all he saw was a sudden azure flash approaching.

Once again, Chen Xiang attacked as his dragon head-like punch smashed into the middle-aged man’s mouth. The lightning power released this time was stronger than before, when he punched, it burst out with a dazzling azure light, meanwhile, the entire ground slightly shook.

Shocking Heaven Palm! Although he had used his fist to cast the technique, the subsequent shockwave secretly shocked Gu Dongchen and Wu Kaiming. They were sure that the middle-aged man already lost.

Sure enough, after Chen Xiang had punched, the middle-aged man was battered out of his wits, and in that very moment, another lightning-fast punch smashed into him. Both his fists alternatively struck the middle-aged man at fast speed. In the blink of an eye, tens of punches ruthlessly greeted the middle-aged man’s face. Each punch burst forth with a dazzling brilliance. If had it been the night, the subsequent azure flashes would have been a spectacular and astonishing sight.

“Stop!” Wang Quan shouted. However, in just the short moment when he shouted “stop”, Chen Xiang had already punched hundreds of times. Chen Xiang had unleashed the strongest might of Azure Dragon True Qi for his each and every punch, moreover, he had cast the Shocking Heaven Palm along with the punch.

Chen Xiang obediently stopped. Meanwhile, the middle-aged man still stood at his place. Whenever Chen Xiang battered his face, he would release a kind of suction, therefore, no matter how strong his punches were, the middle-aged man would not fly away. Which made the middle-aged man’s head glued to his fists, allowing Chen Xiang to frantically bombard his face. The subsequent damage he had suffered was most terrifying.

“You have passed the test!” Wang Quan was somewhat furious because Chen Xiang was clearly displaying his dominance. And of course, he knew that Chen Xiang had already shown mercy, if he had fused the Five Elements True Qi into the Universe True Qi, the middle-aged man would have long been crippled.

The middle-aged man was after all an Extreme State martial artist. Under this kind of maddening bombardment, he had not fainted at all, but his head had already been seriously injured. When the others came to help him, the middle-aged man coughed a bit as he spewed out many broken teeth.

When Wang Quan saw the middle-aged man spew teeth along with the blood, he tightly clenched his fist, for he recalled the time when Huang Jintian had knocked out his entire teeth and then bragged about it everywhere, which made him lose face.

Chen Xiang wasn’t too much concerned regarding the martial artists of Kings’ Mainland, as long as no one died, everything was fine; he could torture them as he wished because the martial artists of Kings’ Mainland had done the same to the martial artists of other mainlands.

As early as half a year ago, Chen Xiang’s had heard that the martial artists of Kings’ Mainland started viciously; many people had been crippled and rendered unable to practice martial arts ever again, for which he was also furious. And now, he wanted to give them the dose of their own medicine; let those proud and arrogant martial artists of Kings’ Mainland experience how being beaten to a cripple felt like.

Chen Xiang just calmly swept a glance at the several proud young men standing behind Wang Quan and asked, “Who’s next? Let me tell you in advance, kicks and punches have no eyes, if you get crippled during the fight, then don’t put the blame on me! Previously, you, martial artists of Kings’ Mainland had done the same, so I’ll not show any mercy to you. If you are afraid, it’s better for you to throw in the towel at the start of the fight!”

“And also, I don’t like anyone stopping me when I am happily beating people up! The fight is between him and me, not with others, others don’t have the qualifications to stop the fight, this seems to be a rule a long time ago.”

Chen Xiang had his fist clenched, his voice carried anger. Had it not for Wang Quan shouting to stop, the man definitely would have been crippled by him a moment ago.
