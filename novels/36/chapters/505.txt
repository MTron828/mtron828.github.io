Chapter 506 Demon Subduing Stones

Suddenly, Chen Xiang’s eyes flashed with light. The Stellar Transposition Realm could solve his worry. He must refine an Earth Rank Dan to compete with Elder Dan within three years, but he felt that he would not make it in time, especially given the lack of gradients of Dan and limited strength.

“Just like the Water Moon Profound Realm in the Frozen Wind Valley, in which the time spent is always longer than outside on the fifteenth day of each month. One day inside there equals to several months outside!” Leng Youlan said. That’s why she didn’t care about how powerful that Stellar Transposition Realm was.

Now Chen Xiang understood why Leng Youlan and Xue Xianxian’s strength increased so fast, because the place they cultivated in isolation was different from the outside.

“It takes the thousands of Demon Subduing Stones per day to enter the Stellar Transposition Realm. The Demon Subduing Stones are specially made to encourage students to improve themselves, and it’s very hard to get one. I only managed to get 500 of them after such a time I spend here.” Xue Xianxian saw Chen Xiang’s expressions. She knew exactly what he was thinking.

Leng Youlan continued, “sister Xianxian and I earned those five hundred stones from gambling with others. We can only gamble for at most ten stones each time, and now many people don’t dare to fight with us anymore, so it will become harder and harder to get those stones."

“Xianxian, what is the Demon Subduing Board that you mentioned earlier?” Chen Xiang thought for a moment before asking. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“That’s a group of very powerful guys! As long as we get one thousand Demon Subduing Stones, we can challenge them. If we lose, we have to give them our Demon Subduing Stones. If we win, we can get two thousands stones from the Academy.” Xue Xianxian said.

“There are a total of 100 people, and even the guy at the bottom is also at the peak of the Spirit Martial Realm. He’s the one who challenged me today.” Leng Youlan said angrily, “that guy is definitely not as good as me. I can definitely win over him."

Chen Xiang touched her cheeks and hugged the two girls tighter, ”how is the ranking decided?”

"The top 80 were carefully selected from other worlds, and they are all very powerful. Many of them are in the Hundred Cultivation Realm. The last 20 are from the Mortal Martial Realm. They were selected by the Principal of the Demon Subduing Academy when they first checked in, so their rankings can’t be considered strict.” Xue Xianxian immediately pinched Chen Xiang as she saw him intending to take advantage of Leng Youlan.

Xue Xianxian did not put on her underwear, neither as Leng Youlan. Chen Xiang felt very comfortable being rubbed against their round and soft breasts. However, he also felt very uncomfortable in a certain part of his body.

“Did sister Menger teach you the Frost Wind Divine Technique?” Chen Xiang asked.

“Yes.” The two women replied at the same time.

“I will teach you another martial art now. It might be helpful for you to learn those martial arts.” Chen Xiang said.

“What martial arts?” Leng Youlan immediately became excited. She was a warlike person. In order to have greater power, she needed stronger martial arts.

“Is it the Tai Chi Dragon Subduing Technique?” Xue Xianxian was also extremely happy. Although she knew that Chen Xiang had divine techniques, without the consent of her sect, he could not teach them to anyone, not even to his own wife.

"No, you can’t learn that! However, divine technique I am going to teach you was adapted from the Tai Chi Dragon Subduing Technique. It is also a divine technique called the Tai Chi Divine Technique. It is suitable for you guys to learn. " Su Meiyao had given him a permission, which was why Chen Xiang could teach the technique to them.

The Tai Chi Divine Technique contained a lot of contents. Chen Xiang didn’t know how to use his divine sense to transmit the information directly to the two girls. He could only dictate it, so the process was extremely boring.

The two girls couldn’t remember everything either, so Chen Xiang planned to divide the process to a couple of days and teach them only a short lesson at each time. Very quickly, the three of them felt sleepy and hugged together as they fell asleep.

The next morning, just as dawn was about to break, Chen Xiang was pulled up by Leng Youlan who was wearing her armor. Although she was very casual when she slept, that she might even be naked, she always wore heavy armor when she went out. She had not changed the habit for all the times.

Chen Xiang promised her that he would have a good fight with her. He didn’t know much about Leng Youlan’s strength, except that she had stepped into the first stage of the Extreme Realm, the Spiritual Martial Realm. In addition, he also knew that she possessed the Frost Wind Divine Technique, but he did not think that it would pose much of a threat to him because he possessed the Heaven and Earth Flames that could withstand the cold.

Xue Xianxian also got up very early. It was a fight between Leng Youlan and Chen Xiang, so she must come to watch it. She was very clear about Leng Youlan’s strength, but she had little knowledge about Chen Xiang. For all the times she only heard some stories of his strength. Although she once saw Chen Xiang’s battle before, that was when Chen Xiang was in the True Martial Realm.

“Brother, do not worry too much when you attack me! I won’t blame you if I lose, and you cannot give any mercy in order to make me stronger!” Leng Youlan said seriously.

Xue Xianxian laughed softly, “dear Xiang, you don’t have to worry about her. She lost to me a few times, but she never ignored me.”

Leng Youlan stuck out her tongue. “Sister Xianxian has also lost to me.”

Originally, Chen Xiang wanted to hide some of his strength, but after hearing Leng Youlan’s request, he could only change his plans and fight her with all his force. At the same time, he wanted to know how strong his little sister really was. This way he could also get aware of the strength of Xue Xianxian, because theirs were almost in the same level.

"After I’m done fighting with you, I still need to go for Xiao Chou the little bastard, sigh ...It is really demanding to be an older brother and a master. " Chen Xiang suddenly wanted to send Xiao Chou to Huang Jintian to rub his spirit so that he wouldn’t always show off in front of him in the future.

“The kid lost to me not because he showed mercy, but because he was too weak! He’ll definitely tell you that he lost because he can’t use his full strength! Hmph, I know it. If I had the chance, I would make him lose without a word to say.” Leng Youlan was a little angry. She hated people who denied her strength the most.

“He’s from the Great Strength Clan!” Chen Xiang said. He did have some doubts about this.

“Big brother, aren’t you human as well? You also beat him twice, don’t you? So what if I beat him once? How you dare to underestimate me? I won’t be any merciful in a moment.” Leng Youlan aggressively said. Her body exuded a domineering aura. Before she even reached the martial field, the battle blood in her body had already been ignited.

Long Xueyi said with a snort, “she has the bloodline of the White Dragon. Don’t underestimate our White Dragon Family. If her bloodline is awakened, she could easily defeat tens of guys of the Great Strength Clan, not to mention only a kid. At that time, you wouldn’t have the confidence to defeat her.”

Xue Xianxian also snorted, “dear Xiang, don’t underestimate our women. Now I also want to have a fight with you to show you my strength!”

Chen Xiang swallowed his saliva. His surrounding and his body were filled with women. He couldn’t afford to offend them.

“I didn’t mean that. Let’s go to the martial arts field now. I can’t wait any longer.” Chen Xiang hurriedly changed the topic.
