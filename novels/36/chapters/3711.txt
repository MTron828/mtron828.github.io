The Medicine God was listening by the side. After Ice-creation Race Emperor went to the secret room, he opened his mouth and asked: "Chen Xiang, what are your plans for the upcoming battle? The strength of the Beast-creation Race was extremely terrifying. More recent chapter access: ww. "

Beast-creation Race was not restricted by the power of the Chuangyuan key because they were all beasts and the power they could grasp was far stronger than humans!

"I don’t know! Back then I had a friend who was also from Beast-creation Race, if only I could see him again. " Chen Xiang really hoped to see Chu Jinfeng and ask him about the situation.

Chen Xiang and the Medicine God walked out of the Herb Mountain.

"I have a lot of spies. If there’s any commotion, I’ll definitely find out as soon as possible." The medicine god said.

"Okay, I’ll be back every once in a while."

Chen Xiang did not plan to stay in Medicine God Villa, because he needed to secretly meddle with many things, and he did not want too many people to discover it.

He was hiding in a forest outside the city.

"Master, are there any results?" Chen Xiang asked, at the same time, he was studying a blueprint of the Chuangshen key.

"My clone is already refining the array disc, it won’t be long before he can refine the Transmission array disk." Xiao Xianglin said: "At that time, we will be able to teleport to that place through the Transmission array Plate. It’s very possible that it’s the very mysterious Initial God-creation Realm!"

"Alright!" Chen Xiang was secretly excited. Although he did not know what use they had, to be able to go to the Initial God-creation Realm was truly a pleasant surprise for Chen Xiang.

"Right now, we don’t have the Tao-creation’s Divine Bead as our energy source, but we have the Source Spirit Stone. Xiao Xianglin laughed tenderly, "This Origin Creation Spirit Stone can allow us to teleport back and forth many times."

Chen Xiang had already decided to go to Initial God-creation Realm to take a look!

Aside from the Initial Thunder-creation Realm, all of the other areas within the Domain of Creation were lifeless. Only the Beast-creation Race that were hidden in one area of the Domain of Creation were not harmed.

During this time, Chen Xiang had been refining the Extreme Heaven Pill to allow Xiao Xianglin, Feng Ke’er and the others to break through to the peak of the legendary realm.

After a month, he came to Medicine God Manor. He wanted to see if the scouts of Medicine God had brought back any news.

"Chen Xiang, a very fierce woman is looking for you! This woman is very strong, and her entire body is filled with hostility. Did you do something to let me down? Why were you so careless? You offended such a woman! "Young man, be careful!" After the Medicine God found out that he had stepped into Medicine God Villa, he immediately rushed over to find Chen Xiang.

"This woman is really looking for me?" Chen Xiang’s eyes turned as he tried to figure out who it was. The inside of the Hundred Flowers Village was more ferocious, the one with the most violent aura could be Leng Youlan ... Maybe it was Little Lizhi, but there was no reason at all. Even though they were usually cold, they would never reveal their fierce side.

"He already said aside from your real name, I don’t know how she knew you were related to the Medicine God’s Villa." The Medicine God whispered, "If you want to fight, you must not fight in here!"

"I know!" Chen Xiang nodded, then followed the medicine god into a luxurious hall.

Along the way, Medicine God’s face was filled with worry because he was a very observant person. He could feel that the aura of that woman was very strong and fierce. She must be the kind of person that would beat people up easily.

Chen Xiang came to the living room. Seeing that charming and elegant face as well as that luxurious golden colored clothes, he knew who it was.

Tao-creation’s Crystal Mother, Jing Yun’er!

"Big Sister Yun!" He had always been very worried that something would happen to Jing Yun’er, and he had also wanted to look for Jing Yun’er. He did not expect that Jing Yun’er would actually come looking for him.

"You damned brat!" Jing Yun’er looked at Chen Xiang and frowned. In the blink of an eye, he had already arrived at Chen Xiang’s place.

"What happened to me?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Still talking! See what your Divine Thunder Mountain Villa has done? " Jing Yun’er placed both of her hands on her waist, propping her head up, she said while looking at Chen Xiang with resentment.

"This... Your relationship with Divine Thunder Mountain Villa is very good? " Chen Xiang did not know either why Jing Yun’er had asked that.

"Bullshit!" When I fell into the Divine Thunder Mountain Villa, I was tortured like crazy! If it were not for the fact that there was a problem with my teleportation, the Divine Thunder Mountain Villa would have been flattened by me long ago.

"I was still waiting for my injuries to heal and I personally pushed Divine Thunder Mountain Villa to the ground. Hmph! Hmph!"

Jing Yun’er s puffed up his face as he lightly snorted, his eyes filled with a faint grievance.

Chen Xiang didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

"Since what has happened has already happened, there’s nothing I can do about it!" Chen Xiang spread out his hands helplessly.

"No, you have to find the God-creation Race’s lair, I have to go flatten them." Jing Yun’er pinched Chen Xiang’s face.

The Medicine God was speechless. He had thought that Chen Xiang would be angry because of what he had done to Jing Yun’er. However, he was extremely curious about Jing Yun’er’s identity;

"Big Sister Yun, I’ve been worried about you these past few days. Did you come over from the Transmission array back then? Injured? " Chen Xiang asked anxiously: "Have you recovered from your injuries? "I can refine a type of pill that is useful in healing injuries!"

"I also don’t know what’s wrong with that broken Transmission array, it directly teleported me into a tyrannical space and time place. If it wasn’t for me being extremely powerful and forcefully escaping out of there, I would have definitely died inside! In the end, I fell into a trap array in Divine Thunder Mountain Villa and was tormented to the point that I couldn’t bear it. It took a lot of effort for me to escape. "

"I’m really sorry, I shouldn’t have let you come." Chen Xiang felt extremely guilty.

Jing Yun’er lightly patted Chen Xiang’s handsome face and laughed: "Anyway, this sister is fine now, don’t apologize, I was the one who wanted to come over back then!"

"Come, Most Ancient Era is elder sister’s homeland. Jing Yun’er pulled Chen Xiang and quickly ran out of Divine Power City.

After Jing Yun’er brought Chen Xiang and left the Divine Power City, he asked: "Brat, have you kept all nine Chuangyuan key s? According to my inquiries, you have already acquired the Ice key! "

"It’s all gathered, but I don’t know what its use is!" Chen Xiang nodded.

"It’s quite useful!" Jing Yun’er’s beautiful eyes shone, she was very happy.

"Big sister Yun, my master ’obtained’ a blueprint from the Chuangshen key and is currently refining it into an array disc. We might even be able to go to Initial God-creation Realm." Chen Xiang said.

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!" Initial God-creation Realm! This is a very mysterious place, I didn’t know too much about it before, but I heard from the Tao-creation Divine Lord that this place is quite dangerous. " Jing Yun’er said: "Not now, use the nine Chuangyuan key s first!"

"How do I use it?" Chen Xiang had always been curious about this, and even the Ice-creation Race Emperor didn’t know how to use it.

"We need to go somewhere before we can use it! "Come, I’ll take you there now." Jing Yun’er said, and let Chen Xiang take out the Six Realms mirrors, then enter the Six Realms mirrors to guide Chen Xiang.
