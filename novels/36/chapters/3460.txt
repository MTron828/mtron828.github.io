Chen Xiang remembered that this fellow was from one of the top ten sects of the Mortal Life Cavern. Now that he had suddenly appeared, it was clear that he was a spy, so he must definitely recognize Xiao Xianglin’s carriage.

"Is that Xiao Xianglin inside the carriage?" The white clothed man asked coldly, because he already knew that the person who destroyed his divine sword and became Xiao Xianglin’s disciple, made him extremely angry.

Initially, he had felt that Xiao Xianglin’s relationship with him was not bad, but he had accepted his enemy as his disciple very clearly to protect Chen Xiang. That was why when he saw Xiao Xianglin’s big carriage, he immediately brought his people over.

"Dai Haiyi, what business do you have? Quickly tell me!" The one who spoke was Liu’er, because Chen Xiang had said before that Master would not speak, and that was the most arrogant.

"Let Xiao Xianglin speak." Although he was a little afraid and confused, he felt that Xiao Xianglin would not do anything to him. He and Xiao Xianglin were both core disciples in the sect, and if Xiao Xianglin were to kill him, it would cause a huge conflict between the sects.

"Just tell me what you want." Liu’er said again.

It was obvious that he looked down on Xiao Xianglin for letting a female slave talk to him, but he couldn’t do anything either. Xiao Xianglin couldn’t do anything to him, and similarly, he couldn’t do anything to Xiao Xianglin.

"Xiao Xianglin, why did you take that guy as your disciple!" His divine sword had been destroyed by Chen Xiang, but he had received a heavy punishment. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be here as a spy now.

Wu Zhong and the others were just watching from the side. They were spies and knew a lot of things, and they were very clear about the matter of Dai Haiyi’s Divine Sword being chopped into pieces. Furthermore, that person was Chen Xiang, who was recruited by Xiao Xianglin into the Dragon Elephant Gate.

"This is my master’s matter, it has nothing to do with you. If there is nothing else, please step aside, and don’t hinder us from doing important things." Yu’er said.

After all, Chen Xiang was the disciple of the Celestial Sect of Dragon and Elephants. To be able to do such a thing would only bring about more glory to the Celestial Sect of Dragon and Elephants.

The dragon elephant roared and was about to fly out. Although Dai Hai Yi was furious, he didn’t dare to stop it. He could only let the dragon elephant fly over.

Xiao Xianglin’s Sixteen Dragon Elephants were still very scary, especially when they roared together. Dai Haiyi and a few others who were floating in front of them turned green.

"This Chen Xiang brat, sooner or later, I will let you have a good look." His grandfather and parents were also Elders of the Mortal Life Sect, but he did not look as good as Xiao Xianglin on the outside.

Just Xiao Xianglin’s dozen or so dragon and elephant were enough to make the spies feel inferior.

Chen Xiang laid on a chair and said: "Dai Hai Yi’s future isn’t too good ... Master, do you think the Mortal Life Sect will pursue the matter of me splitting that divine sword to pieces? "

"No!" This is a grudge between you and Dai Hai Yi, and it will not affect the clan level. " Xiao Xianglin said: "This guy is really something, it’s none of his business if I take in a disciple. Every time I go to the Divine Weapon Tower, this guy would act all day and always ridicule others. I wanted to teach him a lesson a long time ago."

"Yu’er, your performance just now wasn’t too good." Chen Xiang laughed.

"Then the next time I let you say it, I’m not that kind of arrogant person!" Yu’er felt very wronged as she pouted and said, "Anyway, you’re Big Sister’s disciple, so it’s alright for you to speak up for Master."

"Alright, let me do it next time. If you cause too much trouble, Big Sister, you have to support me." Chen Xiang laughed.

"You, when the time comes, just speak to anyone, don’t be so arrogant to anyone." Xiao Xianglin was rather ’worried’ about Chen Xiang, because she had experienced Chen Xiang’s kind of invisible arrogance.

"Elder sister, those dragon elephants shouldn’t be able to fool the elders, right?" Xiang’er said: "How about if I get recognized?" Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

"Don’t be afraid, just tell them that I purposely ’made’ them scared." Xiao Xianglin laughed: "I want to see how they will react!"

"Damn it, I forgot to ask where big brother Wu Zhong is." Xiao Xianglin patted his leg and said.

"Look ahead..." Xiang’er anxiously shouted.

Xiao Xianglin and Chen Xiang stuck their heads out of the carriage, and saw a strange cloud appearing in the high skies far away. This cloud covered the sky in the distance, and released a sparkling and translucent multicolored light.

"Could that place be in the clouds?" Wu’er said in surprise.

"It’s not a cloud... It’s just a barrier, in the clouds there is a huge formation plate, and the release barrier covers the area below, and below the clouds, should be the area where the Legendary mantra appeared. " Xiao Xianglin frowned, and immediately saw through it.

Feng Ke’er said the same thing inside the You Yao Mountain Villa. She could feel the power of the barrier and seal.

The large carriage flew for quite a while before a dragon elephant suddenly flew up. It was a delicate and pretty man. "Follow me!"

Without much words, Xiao Xianglin controlled his Dragon Elephant and followed, before landing on a huge headless mountain. After this mountain had been flattened, there was a vast expanse of flat ground, where the large team of Dragon and Elephant have set up camp.

When he was in the air, Chen Xiang saw that there were many people camping on the flat ground at the top of the mountains not far away.

The sixteen dragon elephants pulling the carriage landed on the flat ground in a vast and surging manner. The scene attracted many Dragon Elephant Sect disciples to come and watch, and their first reaction was to be very shocked, who would pull the chariots for so many Dragon Elephant Xiao Xianglin ...

However, if one took a closer look, the overall aura of these dragons and elephants looked extremely weak!

"Father!" "Mother!" Xiao Xianglin alighted from the carriage and jogged towards the two middle-aged men and women. Normally, she was a wild and wild lady, but after seeing her parents, she was like a lamb.

After Chen Xiang got off the car, he walked behind Xiao Xianglin and bowed to her parents: "Disciple Chen Xiang greets the two elders!"

Xiao Xianglin had accepted a disciple, her parents knew about it immediately, but they did not go to take a look. Now that they saw Chen Xiang, they were very satisfied.

"Stupid girl, what’s going on with these dragon elephants?" A middle-aged beautiful woman pinched Xiao Xianglin’s face and said somewhat angrily: "I thought that your grandfather had lent it to you, but who would have thought that ... But it doesn’t look like it is at all! "

Xiao Xianglin anxiously looked towards Chen Xiang, giving him a look, letting him explain.

"Elder, this is just a trick from me." After Chen Xiang finished speaking, he waved his hand and the Heaven devouring rat returned to its original form.

When the disciples of the ’Sect of Dragon and Elephants’ saw this, they inwardly cursed. It was actually fake. It had really frightened them.
