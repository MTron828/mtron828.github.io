Jiang Simei took Chen Xiang’s Gumai Dan and sold it everywhere, while Jiang Sijing was still here.

"Chen Xiang, selling those Gumai Dan would definitely earn us another fortune, but I didn’t help in any way, taking so many of your Dao crystal with me, I don’t need them this time. " Jiang Sijing said with a face full of guilt.

"Don’t bother with me. Your sister already said that she’s good buddies with me. You are her sister, so I also treat you as my sister." Chen Xiang laughed.

"My cultivation is higher than yours. I feel that I should be your elder sister." Jiang Sijing smiled sweetly, looking extremely beautiful.

"If I hadn’t spent all my time studying alchemy techniques, my current cultivation would definitely be higher than yours, so I would be older than you." Chen Xiang pinched her face and laughed.

"What about my sister? She and I are twins born at the same time. If she treats you as her big brother, then I will be the same. " Jiang Sijing mischievously stuck out his tongue.

"She asked me to call her ’Beautiful Beauty’. She has already accepted me as her big brother." Chen Xiang said, to be honest, although his cultivation was low, but in terms of age, he was already an old man that had lived for ten thousand years.

Jiang Simei and the two sisters grew up here. Because of the environment, their cultivation rose quickly, and they were much younger than Chen Xiang.

"Elder Brother Shen, is it ready?!" Jiang Sijing chuckled.

"Un, it’s done!" Chen Xiang caressed her face.

Jiang Sijing promptly poured Chen Xiang a cup of tea and said: "Elder Brother Shen, have you lived all these years by yourself? I heard that there are many people in Alchemist who have lived their lives alone, especially someone like you, who has great alchemy skills.

Chen Xiang took a sip of tea and laughed sinisterly: "Even if you are not, my woman ... "Heh heh."

"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

Jiang Sijing was very surprised, she never thought that Chen Xiang was actually a romantic, but after thinking about it, she understood that for Alchemist with such a high alchemy skills like Chen Xiang, it was normal for there to be many women around, and even a tyrannical woman like her would admire Chen Xiang so much, let alone others.

"They didn’t follow you to the Myriad Tao City?" Jiang Sijing asked.

"No, they’re not in the Divine Wasteland." Chen Xiang sighed: "It won’t be easy for me to meet them in the future!"

"So you are from the lower realms!" Jiang Sijing said in shock, "No wonder... Those who are able to come from the lower realms are all extremely outstanding. "

"That’s right. In my original world, I was an expert that ruled over a region. However, since I’ve come here, I’m just a useless person." Chen Xiang laughed bitterly.

"Where? Elder Brother Shen, your pill techniques are so powerful. You are very popular everywhere you go!" "It might be because you don’t want to rely on your own powers and want to travel alone, that’s why you are acting like this. Otherwise, if you go to any random power, there will be a lot of people who will try to rope you in." Jiang Sijing said.

"Oh right, what kind of powers does Myriad Tao City have?" Chen Xiang asked.

There are ten great powers, and three of them are weaker than the rest. They are respectively the Heavenly Dao Sect, Sword Dao Sect, and Fire Dao Sect. None of the three powers are able to manage the Myriad Tao Divine Stele, and the other seven are the Four Great Villa. Jiang Sijing said, "My parents were once part of one of the villas. They died while hunting Dragon beast."

Big sister and I were raised by grandma, grandma knows a little about alchemy, and I learned it from grandma. Originally, grandma wanted to recommend us to go to Eastern Dragon Mountain Villa, but big sister refused to go.

"Eastern Dragon Mountain Villa? What about the other six villas? " Chen Xiang asked.

"Eastern Dragon, Western Tiger, Southern Sparrow, and Northern Wu, these are the villas named by the four divine beasts, then the Qilin Villa, Phoenix Mountain Villa, and Divine Elephant Villa. These seven great villas and the three great sects are not in the Myriad Tao City, they are all in the ten better positions in the Dragon beast forest."

Chen Xiang knew that there were powerful forces here, but he did not know of any of them.

"Oh, so it’s like that. It seems quite complicated. I thought that the three doors outside were already very strong." Chen Xiang did not expect this.

"The people from the seven great villas were once part of the three great doors outside, and because everyone was rushing towards the Myriad Tao Mausoleum, over time, everyone gathered here, and gradually developed into a force that built the Myriad Tao City. So after leaving this place, it is true that the three great villas are the strongest, but here, the strength of the seven great villas is stronger than the three great doors."

"After so many years of development, the Three Gates are now pretty good. It can be said that they came from behind and after a while, they might be able to get the authority to manage the Myriad Tao’s Divine Stele."

"A small fry like us, if we go to the Eastern Dragon Mountain Villa, we would also be bullied. Maybe there will be a worse result, in places with power and battles, there will be unspoken rules. We don’t have enough strength, so we won’t be able to control ourselves."

"That’s why elder sister didn’t go."

Chen Xiang nodded his head: "Indeed, there may be more battles coming up."

The three doors here had called in the experts from the other three sects. They must be preparing to take action to increase their strength.

"I’m really useless. I can’t be like elder sister who knows how to refine pills or do business." Jiang Sijing sighed.

"Of course not, your speed of ripening medicinal herbs is extremely fast!" I have a batch of saplings here to mature you. " Chen Xiang took out more than ten small sapling. These were all saplings that would need the same kind of red fruit to refine Gumai Dan.

"Great, I was just worrying about nothing to do!" Jiang Sijing felt that he hadn’t done anything, but wanted Chen Xiang’s Dao crystal instead, so he couldn’t help but feel apologetic in his heart.

"I will plant it in my Divine Sense Sea World." Jiang Sijing was suddenly very happy, her face had a sweet smile.

Right at this time, Jiang Simei returned.

"It’s sold out?" Chen Xiang asked. He had not gone out for long.

"Yes, I went to the center of the city to sell them. I got them very quickly, I originally wanted to sell them for 500 pills, but I added 700 pills!" Selling a total of almost fifty Myriad Tao Crystals, that’s f * cking great! " Jiang Simei laughed.

He was also very satisfied with Chen Xiang giving him thirty Myriad Tao Crystals. At this rate, he would quickly earn enough Dao crystal to buy a hundred of them. That would take a million.

bang bang bang *

Suddenly, there was a knock on the door.

Jiang Simei was just about to open the door, when he heard a "boom" sound. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

"It’s this woman!" A fiendish looking middle-aged man said.

"That’s right, he’s the one who went to our territory to sell that Gumai Dan." There were many people behind the middle-aged man, and one of them said.

"Smash it!" The middle-aged man shouted angrily.

A group of people immediately rushed in and with a few crackling sounds, they smashed everything inside the shop. Jiang Sijing was also scared and hid behind Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang clenched his fists tightly, he really wanted to make a move, but realised that these people were all from the Tai Dao realm, especially the middle-aged leader, whose power was unfathomable.

"Take out the Ten Myriad Tao Crystals, and you will be spared from the pain of skin and flesh." A middle-aged man sneered.
