Chapter 54: Sister

Edited By: Sietse

“Don’t ask me why. Just take it and go to the Extreme Martial Sect. If they don’t let you join, give them the Metal Spirit Fruit in exchange for an assessment. Through this method, you can enter into the sect, as I believe that you hold all the qualifications needed to pass their examination.” Chen Xiang instructed.

Leng Youlan was shocked, for her, it was very hard to believe that Chen Xiang would help her in such a way.

“Youlan, your father, Great General Leng, was killed in battle a few years ago. It was you who has had it hard these past few years. How about we become sworn brother and sister? After I also enter the Extreme Martial Sect, I will take care of you!” Chen Xiang’s heart was moved when he remembered Leng Youlan’s life experience. Watching her, anyone would feel pity and compassion towards her, as they couldn’t help but have such feelings.

Leng Youlan also became startled. She nibbled her lips as her eyes suddenly became moist. Yet, she faced Chen Xiang, smiled and said: “Little sister greets elder brother!”

Chen Xiang grinned: “Youlan, you have the Fire and Ice Veins, after you enter the Martial Art Sect, your future prospects are boundless! I’ll help you in any way I can.”

Before, Leng Youlan was a little wary about Chen Xiang, but any of her suspicions and other thoughts had vanished in a puff of smoke. She now knew that, with Chen Xiang’s current status, he could get any girl he wished for. It would be very idiotic of him to tarnish his reputation just because of a matter between a man and a woman.

Although Chen Xiang and Leng Youlan had just recently met, they were concerned about each other, almost as if they had known each other for a long time! And Today, they had met and recognized each other as equals!

Chen Xiang was helping her, and essentially showering her with love. She was extremely moved, as this was the first time that someone had shown such care for her after her father’s death. They had only met each other for the first time, yet she had already received so much help. Therefore, Leng Youlan was very happy to become Chen Xiang’s sister. From the moment she had heard about him, she was impressed by Chen Xiang’s strength, almost to the point of secretly worshipping him!

“Brother, I’ll always remember your kindness today! I’ll be on my way, my body situation is slightly complicated at the moment. I don’t want to delay any longer, remember to teach that ruthless Song Nanming a lesson he won’t forget.” Leng Youlan said, as she smiled at Chen Xiang.

“Youlan, hold on. Be sure to be careful on the way!” Chen Xiang then passed her a small jade bottle. Inside of it were several very good pills, solidifying Leng Youlan’s feelings of gratitude.

Leng Youlan’s father was killed three years ago in battle. For all these years she had been living alone. It was very difficult for her, however, trying to elevate her strength alone showed that she was a very strong girl.

Leng Youlan’s eyes once again moistened up, she nodded and said, “Please accept Youlan’s salute.”

Chen Xiang immediately went to hug her, laughingly saying “My dear sister, I forbid you to do such things! Be careful on your way to the Martial Sect!”

“I’ll become a lot stronger. Brother, you must remember to look for me!” Leng Youlan wiped her tears away, as the feelings of receiving somebody’s love and concern had made her feel very moved once again.

“En, I’ll certainly come!” Chen Xiang stroked her silky white hair.

“Brother, what if I don’t go just yet? I know there is some hatred between you and the Yao Family. Perhaps I can be of help!” Leng Youlan restored her previous cold and proud demeanor, her whole body full of vigor. With her war-like intentions soaring, she resembled a valkyrie. But watching Chen Xiang, her expression was soft.

Chen Xiang shook his head, smiled and said: “No, my Chen Family can easily deal with it. Your health is more important.”

Leng Youlan bit her lips, firmly saying: “Brother, later I’ll fight side by side with you. I won’t drag you down!”

Chen Xiang was very pleased with her reply, he nodded his head and asked: “You know the way?”

“I know. I have been gathering information about all of the sects long ago. Although the route is somewhat dangerous, I can handle it, there is no need for you to worry.” Leng Youlan said.

Chen Xiang accompanied Leng Youlan out of the city. Here, he sat down and watched, as she rode away on a horse...

In the afternoon, it was Chen Xiang’s turn to compete. But when he went to the tournament stage, he was told his competitor had abstained, which made him feel somewhat weird.

After the display of Chen Xiang’s strength, in addition to the bloody display he had made yesterday when he had killed Yao Chong, everyone was afraid of Chen Xiang’s strength and the fear was still lingering in their minds.

In the finals, Chen Xiang was going to be facing the Crown Prince, Song Nanming. The audience was extremely looking forwards towards this match. For many people, the Crown Prince’s strength was unfathomable, because of how he had defeated Leng Youlan. Additionally, he was, after all, the Crown Prince of the Southern Martial Empire, as such, he had a gigantic number of resources and could learn various powerful martial skills.

But Chen Xiang knew that Song Nanming’s strength was inferior to Leng Youlan, it was only because of his dirty tricks that he had won. Chen Xiang had already decided, that as long as the Crown Prince used Ice Needles against him, he would act mercilessly.

The Dan King Hall had already been opened for a few days. It was also very popular, stealing away a lot of the Yao Family’s business. Chen Xiang was concerned about the Chen Family Elder, Chen Furong. He hadn’t taken any action yet, even though Chen Xiang had just killed one of the important Yao Family’s Juniors yesterday. Taking into account Chen Furong’s previous actions, he should be looking to cause trouble for the Dan King Hall. Chen Xiang was sure he was up to no good. He also received a message from his father, that the majority of the Chen Family’s experts were on their way to the King City, furthermore they were coming secretly.

Late at night, Chen Xiang was cultivating in a private room, when he suddenly sensed the breathing of several people at the 8th level of the mortal martial realms appearing inside the Dan King Hall. He was awakened by this and quickly left his private room, heading towards the source of the breaths.

“Dad!” Chen Xiang was surprised as he looked at the other people present. In the group, there were two middle aged men, the other three being rather old.

“Uncle Yihan, Great Uncle Haohai, Great Elder, 2nd Elder, and 3rd Elder!” Chen Xiang was shocked in his heart, as he quickly saluted these elders. Excluding Chen Haohai, Elder Chen Yihan, the other three were at the 7th level of the mortal martial realm. Yet now, they had already entered the 8th level of the mortal martial realm.

[TLN: I don’t know about other, but in my translation great elder, great uncle, great brother as such means eldest brother, uncle and such.]

“Smelly brat! You certainly put my [Thousand Year Old Blood Spirit Grass] to good use!” Chen Haohai laughed merrily. He was quite sorrowful on the day that he had lost that herb. But now, when he saw that the Dan King Hall had flourished to such a degree, he felt surprised and delighted.

Chen Yihan smiled, his smile was somewhat gentle while at same time somewhat sinister, as he said: “I didn’t expect that you could establish a dan shop in such a short amount of time. Moreover, drawing in the Dan King, our Chen family will certainly be able to become one of the strongest families in the Southern Martial Empire.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The other three elders also praised him abundantly.

One bald old-man said: “The Yao Family was greatly resisting and blocking our Chen Family’s entry into King City, among them was Chen Furong!”

“Great Elder is correct, fortunately for us, we made contact with an ancestor of our Chen family. He helped us breakthrough to the 8th level of the mortal martial realm using spirit level dans! He cannot meddle in secular worldly matters, so he let us clean out the house and handle Chen Furong...” The 2nd Elder made a killing gesture.

Chen Xiang frowned, asking: “How strong is Chen Furong? How many Chen family members have come?”

Chen Tianhu answered: “We brought three hundred elite disciples, who are all above the 4th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, while we few old men also came to help.”

Chen Tianhua was also at the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, and now there are six Chen Family Martial Artists who were at the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, counting in Chen Xiang that number was raised to seven! According to the structures of power in the Southern Martial Empire, their strength was quite astonishing.

“Chen Furong is estimated to be at the 9th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Thus, six of us together may just barely be able to balance it out.” The Great Elder said with a somewhat serious expression.

Chen Xiang smiled slightly: “If our Chen Family and the Yao Family go to war, you just have to handle the Yao Family, leave Chen Furong to me!”

Chen Tianhu suddenly stood there blankly, as the jaws of the three elders were almost touching the ground.

“My dear son... Have you entered the 9th level of Mortal Martial Realm?” Chen Tianhu asked, he was astonished and it was clearly visible on his face.

Chen Xiang slightly pursed his lips, saying: “I’m just at the 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm, but I think I’ll be able to hold Chen Furong for quite a while. That way, you elders, with your overwhelming strength, will be able to completely decimate the Yao Family.

Chen Tianhu let loose a long breath, if Chen Xiang had entered into the 9th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm at his age, then he himself, as well as the other old men, should just go die in a hand full of water. Thankfully, Chen Xiang had only entered into the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, which still gave them a big surprise! They also knew that his strength couldn’t be defined by common norms. After all, when Chen Xiang was merely in the 5th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, he was already able to defeat Chen Yihan, who was in the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm! Remembering this fact, the Chen Family Experts all shuddered.

Chen Tianhu and the others soon left, they still had to secretly lead the three hundred elites to the Yao Family’s tournament field tomorrow. Meanwhile, Chen Xiang was still adjusting himself to get to his most optimum state, so that he was prepared to cope with various situations that could occur tomorrow.
