Chen Xiang had already left the village and returned to the Original Tao’s Door. Right now, he had revealed that he had the Heavenly Alchemy Dao line and the Heavenly Alchemy soul, he felt that only by returning to the Original Tao’s Door would it be much safer. Access:.

"I wonder if Uncle Lin has come out from closed-door cultivation yet!" Chen Xiang flew in the air stealthily, and at this moment, he was extremely vigilant.

Flying Dragon Palace was not weak, and now that he had confirmed that the Heavenly Alchemy art had been snatched away by him, he would definitely not be let off.

Chen Xiang now felt that the Flying Dragon Palace seemed to appear at any time. Previously, when he was competing in pill refining, he did not see the Flying Dragon Envoy, so he suspected that the Flying Dragon Envoy would go back and tell the Flying Dragon Palace that everything that happened here was just a matter of time.

Just as Chen Xiang’s mind was in a state of turmoil, a large group of different types of lights suddenly appeared in front of him and flew towards him!

"Dragon?" Chen Xiang could only see that the dragons were glowing with a bright light. There were not a few of them, but a large group of them!

A large group of dragons, in all colors, flew at high speed like a crazy wave crashing through the air. When they saw this scene, they couldn’t help but be shocked!

Before he could even react, the group of dragons had already charged over!

But the weird thing was that even though these dragons had arrived, they did not have any presence. Furthermore, they could even penetrate his body!

"This isn’t a real dragon, it’s just an illusion. What is going on?" Chen Xiang looked at the flying dragons in the distance, his heart filled with curiosity. He was probably not the only one who saw this sudden phenomenon, many people definitely saw it as well.

"There should be many people who have seen it flying towards that village. I want to follow and see where these dragon shadows are going!" Chen Xiang immediately chased after him with a speed that told the Master Wang what he saw just now.

Master Wang had been here for many years, although he did not go out for a long time, he definitely knew a lot of things.

"Soaring Dragon Blood Bathing Elephant!" After the Master Wang heard this, he hurriedly said, "You’re sure you didn’t see wrong, this isn’t a good thing!"

"I am definitely not mistaken!" Otherwise, how can I describe such a scene? " Chen Xiang said: "What does the Flying Dragon look like when it was bathed in blood? Why is that not a good thing? Elder Wang, quickly tell me! "

"The group of dragons you see are all the pagoda dragon souls of the dead Flying Dragon Pagoda. Although these dragon souls do not have much power, they can still sense the danger and get closer. The dragon souls are currently flying everywhere, and it is clear that they are telling everyone that a great danger is about to befall them." The Master Wang said.

"This Flying Dragon Pagoda’s Thousand Floors actually has something dangerous? What could it be? " Chen Xiang followed the group of dragons and flew past the village where the Heavenly Refining Convention was being held. He also saw many people ending up with their dragon souls, which were like monstrous waves.

"Why is there no danger in the thousand floors of Flying Dragon Pagoda? This kind of thing happened a long time ago, but it’s unknown. Master Wang sighed: "You should return to the Original Tao Sect quickly! For such a thing to occur, it would normally be dealt with by the Four Great Divine Sects. "

Chen Xiang was extremely curious about this kind of thing. If he could not become invisible or use the power of teleportation, he might not be able to join the excitement, but right now, he had to go and take a look.

Very quickly, they saw familiar people. The Great Clan Elder of the Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect, as well as the other elders of the Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect, were flying fast in the air. Their faces were all solemn.

Chen Xiang’s flying speed was much slower than theirs. If he did not rely on teleportation, it would be impossible for him to catch up to these old fellows.

After following the Dragon Soul for a day and a night, Chen Xiang suddenly saw that the sky in front of him was entirely covered with gray clouds.

"What is this place?" Chen Xiang told Master Wang what he saw.

"Could it be the Dragon Devil Dead Land? That’s right, it must be the Dragon Devil Dead Land, if you are guided here by the Dragon Soul, it can only mean that a crisis will occur here. " Master Wang’s voice was filled with fear, "I never thought that this place would actually be so dangerous!"

"What kind of place is the Dragon Devil Dead Land?" Chen Xiang asked anxiously, his speed was relatively fast, when he arrived, he saw the group of elders from Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect hovering in the air, their faces were filled with fear.

This made Chen Xiang even more curious! The elders of the Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect were all Grand Elder cultivators, but at this moment, they seemed as if they were facing the threat of death.

"Let’s go back and report!" The Great Elder hastily said, then continued to shout, "Let’s go, let’s go ..." Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He was issuing a warning to those who were rushing over here. His voice was far away and anyone could hear the endless fear in his voice.

Chen Xiang was also shocked by the Great Clan Elder’s reaction! He quickly told Master Wang about the Great Clan Elder’s reaction.

"What exactly is going on with the Dragon Devil Dead Land? Why is he so afraid! " Chen Xiang asked again, but Master Wang did not answer him.

"Dragon Devil Dead Land is Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect’s nightmare! Back then, Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect’s strongest Heavenly Alchemy Venerable Ancestor died here! " The Master Wang sighed: "I only heard about this secret by chance! When Flying Dragon Pagoda first appeared, he was already here. At that time, the environment here was very bad, because of all kinds of strange powers, and the birth of all kinds of terrifying beasts! "

"And Dragon beast is considered more gentle! In the past, the most terrifying thing was the Dragon Demon. I don’t know what the Dragon Demon is either, all I know is that Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect used to bring along Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect’s Hundred Great Honored Warriors and died in battle here! " Master Wang said: "Of course, the other three Divine Sects s also suffered from countless deaths, and only at the end did they exterminate the Dragon Demons ... But now, it seems like the Dragon Demon was only suppressed! "

"Heavenly Alchemy Venerable Ancestor? Is he the founder of the Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect? " Chen Xiang asked.

"He can be considered the number one person in the Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect, as for the founder, I am not too sure either, I only know that he had trained the complete Heavenly Alchemy, and that he had used it on an extremely high level of alchemy! The Venerable ancestor realm is above the Tai Zun realm, and within the thousand layers, there are very few people who have this kind of strength. " Master Wang let out a long sigh.

This was the first time Chen Xiang had heard of the existence of this realm.

"Hurry up and go back, this place is really dangerous." The Master Wang advised.

"Un, I’ll head back now!" Chen Xiang immediately distanced himself from this place. After all, he had never experienced that era before, so he could not understand the fear of the Great Clan Elder and the others in the Heavenly Alchemy Divine Sect.
