The people around him would rush over. Chen Xiang had already expected this.

A few big blades slashed down, but they missed, because they only hit an illusion. Chen Xiang used his water mirror technique to dodge and hid in the air.

"Up there!" Gong Senliang shouted loudly, but as soon as he said that, a gigantic golden palm pressed down like a small mountain, bringing with it a huge amount of pressure as it smashed down. The wave of air crushed the stone tiles on the ground into powder, and the few big men couldn’t help but fall to the ground as though they were enduring the pressure of millions of kilograms of strength.

With a rumbling sound, the ground trembled. Before those few big guys could even scream, they were crushed into meat paste by that palm made from golden Zhen Qi, sinking deep into the ground.

"I don’t usually let people who want to kill me live!" Chen Xiang waved his hand, and the ground was set ablaze, burning all the corpses.

"Hmph, don’t think that just because you have some strength, you can brag about it. Let me tell you, this is the City Lord Palace, you can’t even escape now!" Gong Senliang only looked to be in a sorry state, but he was not injured.

Saying that, he took a step in front of Chen Xiang, his fists and palms flying, the wind brought with it electricity, and in a moment, countless of shadows of fists and palms appeared, releasing blazing flames and raging thunder and lightning energy, smashing towards Chen Xiang from all directions.

Gong Senliang used all his strength, the sudden attack was like a wave of thunder and fire, instantly rushing towards Chen Xiang. Chen Xiang did not expect Gong Senliang’s attack to be so tyrannical, his reaction was just a bit slower, but his upper body still got hit by a dozen of fists.

The powerful force pierced through Chen Xiang’s body and struck the stone wall behind him, shattering it. And the aura and disturbance that was emitted from the stone wall, in the quiet City Lord Palace, was extremely big, it was impossible to not alert others.

"Everyone stop!" An ice-cold shout came out, this was Du Yanyao’s voice.

However, Gong Senliang acted as if he did not hear it, his fist was intertwined with traces of electric light, flames surged out wildly and one of his arms slightly expanded, a large amount of Innate Qi gathering on his arm.

Gong Senliang bellowed, he shot towards Chen Xiang like an arrow, the powerful force behind the punch struck the air, causing a true explosion, as though space itself was about to split apart.

When the fist arrived in front of his eyes, Chen Xiang extended his hand and grabbed, the Genuine qi of universe coiled around the surface of the tiger’s fist, releasing a large amount of power. When he tried to squeeze Gong Senliang’s fist tightly, he deflected the berserk power, but Chen Xiang was still pushed back dozens of steps by the fist.

Gong Senliang’s expression immediately changed. He did not expect Chen Xiang to be so powerful, to be able to block his powerful punch with just a grab. If it was a warrior that had the same cultivation as him, he would at least be heavily injured.

"Go to hell!" Chen Xiang’s face darkened, killing intent flashed past his eyes, he used his strength to crush Gong Senliang’s fist.

Gong Senliang let out a miserable scream: "Save me!"

"No one can save you!" Chen Xiang shouted angrily, the Dragon Power immediately appeared, his palm that was surrounded by a vigorous Dragon Power, shook the air and suddenly smashed onto Gong Senliang’s chest. At the same time that the vibrating power surged, there was the sound of "Pa Pa Pa Pa". Ten crisp sounds pierced through the clouds.

The Heaven Blasting Palm activated by the Dragon Power turned into a tenth layer of Devil-suppressing power, its power was terrifying, upon hitting Gong Senliang’s body, Gong Senliang’s back suddenly split open, blood mist gushed out.

"Please show mercy!" Seeing that it was Chen Xiang, Du Yanyao anxiously shouted.

However, Chen Xiang completely ignored him and continued to strike out at the heavily injured and half-dead Gong Senliang. His palms continued to produce berserk shockwaves and sky-shattering sounds as they mercilessly smashed onto Gong Senliang’s body. In the blink of an eye, Gong Senliang’s body had already turned into a pile of mud.

It had been a very short time, but it made the people who had just arrived feel their scalps go numb, shocked and fearful. In their eyes, this arrogant and tyrannical Second City Lord had died just like that, and in such a miserable manner!

Because Du Yanyao was here, the others were all silently waiting for her order to capture Chen Xiang. However, they didn’t want to fight with this mysterious and terrifying man in front of them, so they didn’t want to die as miserably as Gong Senliang.

Du Yanyao floated down gently and stood in front of Chen Xiang. She was still wearing her black dress, making her body emit a strange beauty, but at the same time, it made her exude a noble aura. She had a goose egg-shaped face, and was mature and beautiful, but her beautiful face looked like it was born not knowing how to laugh.

"What’s going on?" Du Yanyao indifferently swept a glance at the unorthodox Gong Senliang. Although the person who died was Second City Lord, in her eyes, he was no different than an ant. It could be seen how unimportant Gong Senliang was in her eyes.

The moment Du Yanyao appeared, Chen Xiang stared at her, unrestrainedly looking at that ice-cold and mesmerizing oval face. In the past, whenever he looked at a woman’s face, he would more or less glance at her figure, estimating her size, but this Du Yanyao’s face was extremely captivating, making him unable to help himself from looking at her a few more times.

"He invited me here to kill me, so I had to retaliate in order to protect myself." Chen Xiang answered honestly. Right now, the Innate Qi was gathering in his four limbs, preparing to attack at any time. He wouldn’t let down his guard just because the opponent was a charming woman.

Du Yanyao had also been staring at Chen Xiang’s face the entire time, the two of them just stared at each other without saying a word, but their bodies were releasing an invisible aura, causing no one to dare come close.

"Who the hell are you?" Du Yanyao’s tone became slightly more gentle as she asked this.

"I’m just tired of staying in the deep mountains. I didn’t expect that I would encounter so many unpleasantness when I came out for a walk. Sigh!" Chen Xiang shook his head and sighed: "If you want to capture me, then do it, but I’m telling you, it’s not easy to capture me."

"You can go!" After Du Yanyao finished speaking, she said to a big sized man: "Send him out. There is no need for anyone else to interfere in the conflict between him and I, or else we will be fighting against me, Du Yanyao!"

It was filled with power and voice, intimidating those who wanted to take Du Yanyao’s good impression by attacking him in private. Hearing these words, they wouldn’t dare to attack Chen Xiang in the future, since they didn’t have the strength to do so either, otherwise, their fates would be the same as Gong Senliang’s.

Chen Xiang walked out of the City Lord Palace and heaved a sigh of relief. That Du Yanyao was even harder to deal with than he had imagined, last time it looked like she was surrounded, but Chen Xiang had not seen her true strength. Furthermore, her demeanor just now was as if everyone around was an ant. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

"This woman’s background is too noble, determining her character. Moreover, she lacks discipline. If she were to lose a bit of spirit and not reveal her edge, it would definitely be good!" Su Meiyao laughed, "You little scoundrel, are you interested in me now?"

Chen Xiang curled his lips and said: "Compared to her esteemed status, sister Meiyao and Sister You You are only on ten streets in a second, what does she count as? What’s more, I have the noble royal dragon of Little Naughty Dragon as my friend, isn’t it just a granddaughter of a Dan Immortal? This old one will also become a Dan Immortal sooner or later. "

"That’s right, sister Meiyao has been taken away by a little scoundrel like you, and you have the empress Liu Meng’er and a beautiful little fairy like Xue Xianxian by your side ... This Dan Immortal’s granddaughter is nothing. " Long Xueyi was elated when she heard Chen Xiang praising her.
