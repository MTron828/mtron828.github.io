Chapter 52 - Beauty Departs

Chen Xiang returned to Dan King Hall, he instantly ran to practice within his private room. This time, Su Meiyao was going to teach him some underhanded methods to prevent poisoning. Otherwise, if he encountered a situation like this again, he may not be as lucky as he was today.

“Little devil, you should have enraged that old man today and made him come out and fight you. Now you’ve allowed him to prepare, you’re too tender.” Bai Youyou said. She was wearing a black dress, both hands hugging her chest as she leaned on the wall. Her clear as ice eyes displayed an unrestrained killing intent.

Su Meiyao gently laughed and said “Senior sister, I remember that you once said how you are very satisfied with how this brat handles things. What changed...?”

Bai Youyou snorts “Humph. He doesn’t have enough hatred. Not decisive enough regarding killing.”

“Sister Youyou, are you not tired of always wearing the same clothes? How about I buy you some newer and prettier outfits.” Chen Xiang laughed and said. In order to please both beauties, Chen Xiang simply resorted to the best method he knew. That was to suggest beautiful clothes as woman liked this the most. Regarding this method, he has received rather good results from it.

Bai Youyou’s elegant face turned slightly crimson and her tone also became somewhat gentler. “For now, that is not required.”

Su Meiyao covered her mouth with her soft hands and started laughing. She pouted her small lips and complained “You little brat, what kind of potion did my senior sister fed you? She has more clothes than me, and I’ve always been so good to you as well. Yet my things are so few, you are completely biased.” Chen Xiang stuck his tongue out, taking a deep breath to inhale the delicate fragrance released from Su Meiyao’s body. He deliberately made a bitter face and said “If I don’t do this, how else can I make Sister Bai Youyou feel superior?”

“Humph, becoming a little more clever are we?” Bai Youyou snorts and says.

“Senior sister, since you’re unwilling, why not give these clothes to me!” Su Meiyao teasingly said.

“You’re actually asking me to give them to you? We usually share our clothes with each other.” Bai Youyou gave her a contemptuous look.

Chen Xiang knew that both beauties resided all day within a small house inside the ring. No doubt, they were bored so he often ordered a lot of beautiful clothes and got small things for them so they don’t feel too down. He did all of this so that the two beauties would feel happy. Although they were once peerless experts, they had now lost all their strength and were just ordinary girls. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao both knew how to deal with colorless and odorless poisonous gases. They soon taught Chen Xiang what they knew, it was mainly the method of how to guard his meridians using True Qi. After leaving the private room, Chen Xiang came to arbor in the backyard. Meng Bo and Chen Luzhong were also here, both discussing alchemy techniques. Chen Xiang joined in on their conversation and all three proceeded to exchange their experiences, which benefited all of them.

“Brat, today you’ve once again stirred up trouble! At such a young age, it’s already hard to understand you. How come you have such a knack for trouble?” Chen Luzhong shook his head and laughed.

Meng Bo laughed brightly, said, “This brat is truly not ordinary. Otherwise how could I have been defeated by him? It seems like a war between your Chen Family and the Yao Family is inevitable.”

Chen Xiang skimmed his lips and replied, “The Yao Family asked for it, I think I simply did the right thing.”

“Young Master Chen, Manager, Senior Dan King, I did not think you were all together!” A tender, sweet and soft voice drifted over as Chen Xiang’s heart jumped up. This was definitely Hua Yueyun’s voice. About the matter between Chen Xiang and Hua Yueyun, these two old men had guessed a few things. Otherwise, how come the Dangxiang Herbal Manor was willing to sell spirit herbs to the Dan King Hall at such a cheap price.

The two old men silently left on their own as Chen Xiang’s heart turned bitter.

Hua Yueyun’s dress was very tight today. Her beautiful jade like body was wrapped in a long white skirt. She looked like a fairy that enchanted people’s mind with elegance. She had a unique flavor. Looking at her, Chen Xiang could not help but secretly praise her again and again, but at the same time he looked somewhat distressed.

Seeing Chen Xiang looking depressed, Hua Yueyun angrily said, “I know you hate me.”

Chen Xiang hurriedly explained, “No, it’s just that Elder Sister Yueyun, you are too....tempting, that it could almost be considered a crime!”

Hua Yueyun suddenly became happy, as she tenderly laughed and said “Are you worried about me? Relax, as long as you enter the Danxiang Taoyuan, and become an excellent alchemist, I’m yours.”

Chen Xiang shook his head and said, “ No. I have already said that I want to enter the Extreme Martial Sect.”

Hua Yueyun snorts softly and said, “Little sweetheart, are you thinking about other people now?”

Chen Xiang quickly replied “Did not, I did not. Yueyun sister you’re really pretty, but as you know, I’m engaged to Xianxian. So if I want to have concubines, I need to get her approval as well.”

Hua Yueyun softly sighed, then stuck her tongue out towards Chen Xiang. Making fun of him, she said “I do not want to be your mistress, I want to be your maidservant.”

“Right, I’m going back to the Danxiang Taoyuan today. Why don’t you come with me?” Hua Yueyun asked, her face was full of anticipation.

Chen Xiang was surprised and replied, “Danxiang Taoyuan? I’ve already decided to go the Extreme Martial Sect. Thanks for your consideration, but I’ll have to decline.”

“Do not be surprised, but each Manor lord is called Hua Yueyun, I’ve managed the Danxiang Herbal Manor for two years. Now I must go back, I must tell you that my real name is not Hua Yueyun!” Hua Yueyun said, her complexion immediately became one full of disappointment, now that she had to walk away from Chen Xiang.

“I’m really sorry, but if I have the opportunity, I’ll go to the Danxiang Taoyuan and find you.” Chen Xiang sighed.

Hua Yueyun said with a perfect smile, “Do not worry about the Danxiang Herbal Manor selling herbs to the Dan King Hall. Even after I’m gone, the Danxiang Herbal Manor will keep cooperating with the Dan King Hall, and the prices will also not increase.”

Chen Xiang was confused about why this girl wanted to be his maidservant, nonetheless he was extremely grateful to her, “Thank you. You do not need to be my maidservant, we’re friends! In the future, I’ll go to the Danxiang Taoyuan and look for you.”

Hua Yueyun laughed, said, “You do not want me as your girl, you’ll certainly regret it later! Remember, you must come to the Danxiang Taoyuan and find me. For now I won’t tell you my name, I don’t want you finding me so easily after all!”

As soon as she finished speaking, she quickly went over to Chen Xiang and kissed him. Then ran away laughing, leaving Chen Xiang petrified like a stone statue.

“What... What’s the matter with this woman?” Chen Xiang licked his lips that still had some remaining fragrance, making him feel inexplicably wonderful.

Su Meiyao laughed softly and said, “This little Yaojing decided to eat you, I’m still not clear how you are so fortunate. Before it was Xue Xianxian, and now this Yaojing has taken a liking to you.”

Chen Xiang snorts and said in a low voice and in a very cocky way, “Humph, That’s because of my charm! You will understand why in the future!”

These days, although Chen Xiang wasn’t refining pills, he had been accumulating Dragon Saliva for growing herbs. He also started preparations for refining High-Grade Mortal Level Dans, and Low-Grade Spirit Level Dans. This was a new challenge for him, now that his strength was at the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm.

The very next morning, Chen Xiang arrived at the entrance of the Yao Family field. Today was the match between Leng Youlan and Song Nanming. One was the Crown Prince, while the other was the daughter of a great general. Both of their strength were at the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, this sort of things made others very much look forward to their match.
