When Qin Shuang heard this, he also felt that it was a very strange thing for someone to create an ancient Transmission array to reach the Bloody Wind Island.

"Maybe this guy got himself a Transmission array just so he could come here and search for the Tao-creation’s Holy stone?" Qin Shuang said.

"No!" Bloody Wind Island existed even longer and was not burnt by the blood and fire. This was a very strange thing to do in the first place. " Chen Xiang said: "So, Bloody Wind Island existed before the blood flames appeared, and Bloody Wind Island might have had a Transmission array, it’s just that the World Defying holy dragon did not discover it."

Qin Shuang thought for a while, then said with his head raised, "Continue!"

"The blood fire only appeared after the appearance of the Bloody Wind Island ... The Bright Blood Fire was deliberately brought here by someone, in order to hide something. " Chen Xiang had seen this kind of thing too many times over the years. There were many secrets hidden in many dangerous areas, which was why it had become such a dangerous place.

"The blood flames appeared later on, and the Tao-creation Holy stone and the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals also appeared later on. So I think that man did not build the Transmission array to come here and search for the Tao-creation’s Holy stone." Chen Xiang said: "I need to go back and see what their goal is."

"Alright, you have to be more careful." When Qin Shuang heard this, he also became suspicious. The appearance of the Blood Wind Fire Sea was already very mysterious.

"The ancient bronze gong that we picked up might have something to do with this." said. The World Defying holy dragon were not clear about this either, this kind of thing happened a long time ago.

They were already close to the Bloody Wind Island, about three hundred meters away from it. Because of the thick bloody flames that constantly shrouded the place, the entire Bloody Wind Island was surrounded by a thick wall of fire.

Chen Xiang told Qin Shuang to stay here, and then he used the Counter Power to conceal himself. Walking out of the sea of blood colored flames, he arrived at the top of the Bloody Wind Island.

"There’s more and more people!" Before, Chen Xiang did not have that many people, and there were only a few tens of them. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He saw that there were a lot of stones on the Bloody Wind Island, and a stone mountain had disappeared as well. Those rocks must have come from the destroyed mountain, and at the place where the stone mountain was destroyed, a formation had appeared!

"The Transmission array, Bloody Wind Island is indeed hiding the Transmission array." This was something that Chen Xiang had expected, but he didn’t think that it would be hidden here.

"This World Defying holy dragon, she actually didn’t properly search for the Bloody Wind Island, or else she wouldn’t have let these guys come here." Feng Ke’er said.

Those who had come here were all busy with building cities and a spirit formation created by the formation masters. It would appear that they were planning to stay here for a long period of time.

The Bloody Wind Island was surrounded by blood flames, and the blood flame would occasionally release a burst of blood wind that blew across the entire Bloody Wind Island, accompanied by a burst of Qi that was able to cover up the weak Qi that Chen Xiang was releasing. This way, even those with strong senses would find it difficult to sense his arrival.

Chen Xiang was even more at ease as he entered the center of the Bloody Wind Island, he continued to advance carefully, reaching the center area. The people here were all powerful, because they were setting up large enchantments on top of them.

"I never thought that the legend was true, that there would be an ancient palace hidden within the Blood Wind Fire Sea." An old man said.

"I heard that this Ancient Palace was originally a sect called Ancient Fire Divine Sect, and that Gu Tong came from there. For some reason, the Ancient Fire Divine Sect disappeared without a trace, and when I heard it later on, it was covered up by the Blood Wind Fire Sea, and there are many secrets hidden inside."

Gu Tong was an impressive Refiner, and the ancient bronze gong Chen Xiang and Qin Shuang picked up was created by Gu Tong himself. Now that he heard that Gu Tong’s Ancient Fire Divine Sect was inside, he couldn’t help but be shocked.

"Was there a war here?" Chen Xiang thought, the reason he had such a thought was because he saw the damaged ancient bronze gong.

The Ancient Fire Divine Sect was right here, as for what was happening now, no one knew, but with the Transmission array leading to this place, it was clear that someone had been in and out of here before.

To Chen Xiang, this was a major discovery as he continued to eavesdrop on their conversation.

"Blood Wind Fire Sea is so big, it’s not easy to find him, and there aren’t many people who can enter the Blood Wind Fire Sea. The blood and fire inside the Blood Wind Fire Sea is too scary, only people at the middle stage of Aoshi Holy Stage can resist this kind of fire."

"That’s why we have to capture the World Defying holy dragon first, conquer them, and let this fellow bring us here to search for the Ancient Fire Divine Sect."

Chen Xiang suddenly felt that it was very wise for World Defying holy dragon to hide.

Suddenly, a strong aura surged over, Chen Xiang immediately looked in the direction of the Transmission array, and the people there were a few middle aged people and two old men. They were all very strong, making Chen Xiang feel as if they were facing World Defying holy dragon.

"Hurry up and leave!"

Chen Xiang was worried that he would be discovered by the strong suddenly, and quickly left back into the Blood Wind Fire Sea.

Qin Shuang was very worried about Chen Xiang, she only heaved a sigh of relief when she saw that Chen Xiang had returned safely.

"How is it?" Qin Shuang asked quickly.

"Come on, I’ll tell you on the way!" We have to quickly go and find Senior Holy Dragon. " Chen Xiang hastily ran in the direction of the World Defying holy dragon.

Qin Shuang followed behind.

"Shuang Shuang, have you heard of Ancient Fire Divine Sect?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Of course I have. My grandfather is from the Ancient Fire Divine Sect!" Qin Shuang said in surprise, "How exactly did you know about this Ancient Fire Divine Sect? Even my grandfather wasn’t willing to talk to me about it."

Super Yang Old Ancestor also uses fire experts, so his Sun madness fire is very special. It can become a Legacy and even threaten many strong races, and he is actually related to the mysterious Ancient Fire Divine Sect.

"Ancient Fire Divine Sect is here ... Gu Tong is also a disciple of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect. " Chen Xiang said, then told everything he overheard to Qin Shuang.

"We have to find the Ancient Fire Divine Sect. I feel that my grandfather’s disappearance has a lot to do with this Ancient Fire Divine Sect." Qin Shuang had been searching for her grandfather for many years, but he didn’t find any clues.

"Oh yeah, did the books you saw in the Purple Yang Divine Palace have anything to do with the Ancient Fire Divine Sect?" Chen Xiang asked.

"No, those books were all about his grandpa collecting some information." Qin Shuang shook his head: "Ancient Fire Divine Sect is very mysterious, he won’t tell me much, and will only occasionally mention it."

Hearing Qin Shuang’s words, Chen Xiang became even more curious, "We must find the Ancient Fire Divine Sect quickly, and not let those guys find us."
