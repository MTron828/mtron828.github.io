Chapter 501 Challenge of a Female Overlord

The Bloody Saber-Teethed Tiger was indeed very strong. After receiving so many attacks from Chen Xiang, it was still able to stand up. However, because Chen Xiang had the White Tiger Divine Weapon, the Bloody Saber-Teethed Tiger did not have any strength to retaliate. It was scared.

Just like that, Chen Xiang followed the long bearded old man and left the colosseum which had been a ruin, then came to a huge mountain-like building.

They were inside a huge hall.

"This is the medallion of the Demon Subduing Academy. Once you bring it with you, you can enter and leave at your will! I am Zhao Tao, the chancellor of the Academy. I am in charge of a lot of issues here. " Zhao Tao said.

After Chen Xiang received the medallion, he asked, “what do students mainly study in the Demon Subduing Academy? I am very curious as to why you are willing to give so much and expend so much resources to build an academy.”

Zhao Tao sighed, "we are selfless. We have to do that to prevent so many Mortal Realms from being destroyed. Although these Mortal Realms are in different spaces from the Heavenly Realm, they are more or less related to each other! 100,000 years ago, many of the Mortal Realms were occupied by demons. At that time, the Heavenly Realm was greatly affected.”

“Right now, many of the Mortal Realms have yet to recover from the previous Great War Between the Three Realms. If we don’t do that, there will be more Mortal Realms being destroyed. By then, the tunnels among the Three Realms will probably keep opened!”

“Does the Fire God Shrine think the same way?” Chen Xiang frowned and asked.

"No, the Fire God Shrine wants to inflict wealth on the dead, but they are too naive. They think that they alone are enough to defeat the demons. This is wishful thinking! Demons and humans are different. Demons have innate and special powers. They are much stronger in terms of physical body and vitality than humans. "

Chen Xiang was secretly shocked. The reason why the Fire God Shrine came to the Mortal Martial Realm was exactly as the same he guessed.

“Is the Fire God Shrine really an evil power that specializes in stealing fire spirits?” Chen Xiang asked in a deep voice.

Zhao Tao was stunned for a moment. He nodded with a serious expression on his face. “Yes. However, they have not left any evidence behind to prove that they have done such a thing! Nor do we have any evidence to prove that they have committed such acts. Now that we’re here, they won’t dare to act rashly.”

Chen Xiang nodded his head in relief.

“You can stay here. There will be courses arranged every day, which will allow you to gain a deeper understanding of the demon world. Then, you will learn martial skills, a few martial skills that are specialized in suppressing demons! It’s just extremely difficult to learn. It’s already good enough if three hundreds out of three thousand students could master these skills!”

As for learning martial arts, Chen Xiang didn’t have anything to worry about. He was already proficient in many martial arts and could use his own experience to learn other martial arts.

“What kind of fantasy residence do you want to live?” Zhao Tao asked.

Chen Xiang scratched his head and embarrassedly said, “my wife is here too. Can I live with her?”

Zhao Tao chuckled, “of course you could! If that’s the case, I don’t need to talk too much about the things that are important in the Academy. I’ll just let her tell you.”

The old man’s gaze made Chen Xiang blush.

After learning the location of Xue Xianxian’s residence from Zhao Tao, Chen Xiang left the huge stone skyscraper and quickly walked towards a small hill. Over there were the student’s living quarters, all built by themselves.

When Chen Xiang passed by a huge circular house, he suddenly heard a string of curses coming from inside the door, “bastard, why did someone at the peak of the Spiritual Martial Realm come here to join in the fun? You’re so much stronger than me, even if you win against me, you won’t be proud.”

“Miss Leng, you possess the Frost Wind Divine Technique and a powerful treasure. You are at a great advantage, at most I won’t use my weapon!” A man’s voice sounded again.

Hearing Leng Youlan’s voice, Chen Xiang immediately stopped his footsteps and walked towards the huge circular building. After entering the gate, he saw many square fighting stages that were twenty to thirty feet wide.

“What a powerful formation! The forces of the Heavenly Realm are truly powerful!” Chen Xiang was secretly shocked. Even though he saw the array foundation, he could use the special energy released by the formation to determine the quality of a formation.

Leng Youlan was standing on top of a martial stage with a huge white sword in her hand. Chen Xiang could tell with a glance that the sword was made of the White Jade Dragon Bone. It was the same for the weapons of Liu Menger and Xue Xianxian. It was an extraordinary weapon in the Mortal Realm.

Leng Youlan had a head of beautiful white hair that was scattered all over her back, making her very eye-catching. Hence, many people were paying attention to her. Her beautiful and cold face, her fiery red armor, and her huge white sword made her appear extremely domineering. With just a glance, one was able to tell that she was a woman that was not to be trifled with, but also a woman who stimulated men’s desire to conquer.

At this moment, Leng Youlan was looking at the man in front of her with a cold and murderous gaze. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“What do you think, do you want to compete?” The rather good-looking man smiled as a crafty glint flashed in his eyes.

Leng Youlan frowned and shew an angry expression. Just as she was about to speak, Chen Xiang shouted from afar, “Youlan!”

After the opening of the Demon Subduing Academy, Leng Youlan and Xue Xianxian had entered very early, so she was very famous there, especially her way of doing things and her valiant character, which left a deep impression on other people. In a place for students to compete martial artists, she always shew up in her ruthless fighting style!

But now, this woman shew a gentle look in her eyes as she looked into the distance, then she flew over to the direction.

“Brother!” Leng Youlan shouted. Her gentle and sweet voice made many people think that they had heard wrongly.

Leng Youlan hadn’t seen Chen Xiang for a long time. Now that Chen Xiang had arrived, she was extremely happy and hurriedly flew into Chen Xiang’s embrace.

“Little girl, you still want to fight so much!”

Chen Xiang gently stroked Leng Youlan’s soft white hair. Long Xueyi once said that Leng Youlan had the bloodline of the White Dragon and was born from the union of a human and a dragon. Thus, the power hidden in her body was very strong.

Hearing the discussion of the men behind her, Leng Youlan turned her head abruptly and glared viciously at them, causing many to shut their mouths immediately. They couldn’t afford to offend a tyrant like Leng Youlan.

“I have something on today, so I can’t compete anymore! But I will definitely wrinkle you up some day else!” Leng Youlan shouted to the man on the stage and suddenly left while holding Chen Xiang’s arm.

Chen Xiang laughed, “Youlan, am I delaying you?”

Leng Youlan stuck out her tongue, “of course. I know you’re in a hurry to see Sister Xianxian, so I have to bring you there immediately! To make up for it, brother, you have to fight with me. I’ve been waiting it for a long time!”

Chen Xiang sighed helplessly. Just as Liu Menger said, every day Leng Youlan would think of defeating him. He bitterly smiled and said, “alright, when the time comes, just don’t cry for being kicked by me!”
