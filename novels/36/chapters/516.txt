Chapter 517 Completely Enraged

Both Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan had already mastered the Tai Chi Divine Technique. Right now, even without Chen Xiang’s guidance, they could still cultivate the Demon Subduing Force on their own.

In order to calm himself down to cultivate quietly and keep comprehending some of the suspicious parts of the Demon Subduing Force, Chen Xiang did not sleep with the two girls.

“The Demon Subduing Force doesn’t seem to be that simple!” Chen Xiang kept flipping through the book and reading the profound mantra incantations.

Su Meiyao said after a long while, “that’s right. There’s still an eleventh level of the Demon Subduing Force. I think that’s the perfect state of this technique!”

“I tried combining the mantra from the first to tenth level, and I seemed to feel something.” Chen Xiang closed his eyes as many mantra of the Demon Subduing Force appeared in his mind and conducted all sorts of arrangement...

He tried for the entire night. When dawn arrived, he opened his eyes with a joyous expression on his face. “There is indeed an eleventh level, but it is very hard to cultivate. I have not yet grasped the essence of it. It will take some time.”

In the following period of time, he immersed himself in studying the eleventh level of the Demon Subduing Force. He knew that it was the most powerful part of the technique, but he did not know what would happen after he reached that level.

“Brother, I have something to talk to you! Hurry up, open the door!” Leng Youlan slightly knocked the door. A few days ago, Chen Xiang had told her and Xue Xianxian that he was about to cultivate and should not be disturbed. Now that there must be something emergent happened for Leng Youlan to come for him in such a hurry.

After Chen Xiang opened the door, Leng Youlan somewhat sadly say, “brother, that guy called Qian Liguang died. I remember that he was in the same college as you, and he had a good relationship with the brat Xiao Chou. It was him who told my sister Xianxian about what happened to you in the classroom last time!”

Chen Xiang frowned. Qian Liguang was a good person. He didn’t submit to evil forces, and he was the only person in the Academy who dared to make friends with Chen Xiang, while Chen Xiang had already taken him as a friend, but he died.

"Zhong Quan killed him! In the Ranking Tournament! " Xue Xianxian walked over and lightly sighed. “He died a terrible way!”

Qian Liguang was in the late stage of Spiritual Martial Realm and was in the same group with Zhong Quan. So it was normal for them to encounter in the tournament. However, Chen Xiang knew that people couldn’t impose heavy attacks in the Ranking Tournament!

Chen Xiang closed his eyes and sucked in a deep breath of air. With a trembling voice, he said, “Zhong Quan, I promise you will not get any rankings in the tournament!”

“Brother, where are you going? I’ll go with you!” Leng Youlan could feel Chen Xiang’s anger. She knew what he was going to do.

Chen Xiang stopped his footsteps and calmly said, “Youlan, maybe after today, I won’t be able to stay at the Demon Subduing Academy. You should listen to Xianxian and study hard on martial arts that deal with demons and goblins!”

Even though Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan were very close to Chen Xiang, their master was Liu Menger. Moreover, they didn’t have any grudges against others, so Chen Xiang wouldn’t be worried about dragging them down.

Leng Youlan really wanted to go with Chen Xiang, but she knew that she should not bother him right now, so she could only sigh.

Xue Xianxian didn’t say anything. She knew that Chen Xiang would have a fight Zhong Quan soon or later, but she didn’t think that it would come so early.

After Chen Xiang left the house, he asked Long Xueyi to use her Spirit Traveling in the Nine Heavens Technique to search for Zhong Quan. At this moment, the sky was already dark, so he guessed that Zhong Quan should be in his house.

“You don’t have much time. You have to finish off Zhong Quan before those old fellows from the Academy arrive!” Su Meiyao said.

Chen Xiang’s cultivation was far inferior to that of Zhong Quan, but his divine techniques and divine weapons were enough for him to fight against him.

“He is in the martial field!” It did not take long for Long Xueyi to find Zhong Quan.

“It can’t be better!” Chen Xiang ran towards the martial field while Leng Youlan and Xue Xianxian secretly followed behind him.

There were a lot of people in the martial filed, but only the formation of the largest circular field in the middle opened up. Zhong Quan was standing right on top of it. There were a lot of blood stains on the stage, as well as some pieces of flesh that stuck to the ground. All of them looked new, which indicated how heavy Zhong Quan’s attack was.

Zhong Quan was wearing a set of white clothes and crossed his hands behind his back. He was arrogantly standing in the middle of the martial stage. His pair of white boots were full of blood stains, making him very eye-catching.

“Hmph, no one dares to come up? I didn’t expect that the guys in the same group as me are all cowards. Wasn’t it just because I stomp on a guy to death that scare you guys like this?! A bunch of trash!” Zhong Quan’s eyes were filled with disdain as he swept his gaze across those who wanted to come up but didn’t dare to.

Chen Xiang lightly said, “I’ll do it!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

When the people heard this voice that was filled with endless killing intent, everyone couldn’t help but tremble. They looked towards the direction the voice came from and saw Chen Xiang walking over. He looked extremely calm, but it gave people a feeling that his heart was filled with raging killing intent.

As Chen Xiang walked towards the stage, the oppressive atmosphere became more and more intense. With every step Chen Xiang took, killing intent raised up, causing people to feel cold and afraid.

“Chen Xiang, you are not a participant of the Ranking Tournament. You can’t go up.” An old man with white hair suddenly walked over and stopped Chen Xiang.

"I’m challenging him. Is that not allowed?” Chen Xiang’s eyes were filled with killing intent as he turned his head and eyed on the old man. Two freezing waves of killing intent caused the old man to uncontrollably retreat a few steps.

Zhong Quan coldly smiled and said, “Chen Xiang, you really have the guts to come and die! I have slaughtered the only person in the academy who dares to be your friend, and his flesh was still stuck onto my boots! Haha .... A guy who overestimates himself was actually attempting to stand up for you!”

Chen Xiang’s body trembled as the muscles on his face violently twitched. He clenched his fists tightly as his nails dug into the flesh of his palm, causing blood to flow out. This showed how terrifying the rage he was currently enduring.

“Today’s part of the Ranking Tournament is over. They can do whatever they want!” A lazy but ice-cold voice came from the distance. It was Yu Baixiang. He just felt a strong killing intent and rushed over.

Chen Xiang was already on the martial field as he coldly stared at Zhong Quan. His eyes were filled with lethal lights. A dense killing intent was continuously emitted from his body and rose up into the air above the martial field.

Zhong Quan disdainfully snorted, “the aura is a bullshit. You must get strong fists!"

“Zhong Quan, I am here to challenge you. It will be a battle of life and death!” Chen Xiang took a deep breath and said in a low voice.

“I can’t wish for anything better. Brother Liao has been wishing for you to die for a long time now.” Zhong Quan did not take Chen Xiang serious at all. Last time he kicked Chen Xiang to vomit blood just in one go, so Chen Xiang was only an ant in his eyes. Beside, he killed Qian Liguang merely to enrage Chen Xiang.

Just like what Chen Xiang thought, Zhong Quan and Liao Shaoyun were on good terms!

This time, Chen Xiang came prepared. He had already released his Black Tortoise Armament Armor and concealed it under his skin. On his fists were a pair of White Tiger Gloves. He wanted to use the Hands of God of Slaughter to strengthen him force, and if necessary, he would use the Azure Dragon Subduing Demon Slayer.

Whatever the price, he wanted to kill Zhong Quan anyway!
