Chen Xiang did not have the patience to wait for a year or two. He took out a jade vat and placed some water inside, then picked up Beast-creation Race Emperor and threw him into the jade vat.

"Bastard, what are you doing?" Beast-creation Race Emperor was furious, she was the one that was stuffed into the jade vat.

"Your armor is too much of a hindrance. Take it off!" Chen Xiang said in a cold voice: "I want to only let you get injured, and bring me to a safe place."

If it was anyone else, he was not afraid, but outside there were all sorts of things conjured up by the Golden Fire Arrogant Lord, and the Beast-creation Race Emperor seemed to have a deep understanding of the Golden Fire Arrogant Lord, so he needed the Beast-creation Race Emperor to bring him.

"No!" The Beast-creation Race Emperor shouted in anger.

Even though she said it like that, Chen Xiang was still trying his best to pull off the armor on her body!

"Bastard, I will chop off your hand!" Beast-creation Race Emperor shouted.

"I want you to take a bath and recover quickly. I, Chen Xiang do not care about a girl like you." Chen Xiang sneered, he was still trying to pull off Beast-creation Race Emperor’s armor, and it was difficult for him to do so.

Beast-creation Race Emperor couldn’t stand Chen Xiang taking her armor like that either. She snorted, closed her eyes, and controlled the armor to enter her body.

"If you dare do anything to me, I guarantee you will regret it!" Beast-creation Race Emperor’s voice was full of threat.

Chen Xiang only curled his lips, and poured a large barrel of Rebirth powder into the jade vat.

"Take out your Time array." Chen Xiang said.

Beast-creation Race Emperor also felt that the Rebirth powder had a strong recovery ability, which surprised her.

She took out the Time array, and then, Chen Xiang opened it and enveloped her within. This way, it wouldn’t be long before she recovered.

Chen Xiang patiently waited outside.

Three days later, Beast-creation Race Emperor closed her Time array. She looked much better, much more energetic, and the icy cold murderous intent in her eyes became even stronger. Especially when she looked at Chen Xiang.

"You said you wouldn’t kill me." Chen Xiang was shocked.

"Yes, but I never said I wouldn’t dig out your eyes and keep your hands." Beast-creation Race Emperor laughed sinisterly.

Chen Xiang was very unhappy: "If I had known this would happen, I would have thrown you here!"

"You can leave now." Beast-creation Race Emperor’s beautiful eyes were filled with a cold smile.

Chen Xiang’s fantasy body could see that the sky was filled with giant golden birds. He did not dare to recklessly try it right now, as the Golden Fire Arrogant Lord knew how to use the Time and space power.

"Okay, then dig out my eyes." Chen Xiang curled his lips.

"If you dare to disrespect me again, I’ll definitely dig out your eyes." Beast-creation Race Emperor released an imposing aura that enveloped Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang cursed in his heart, this Beast-creation Race Emperor was only trying to scare him.

A burst of white mist came out of Beast-creation Race Emperor’s body, then walked out of the tree hole. Looking at Chen Xiang who was inside, he shouted coldly, "Why aren’t you following me? "Remember, you must stay in my mist!"

Chen Xiang immediately followed along, running full speed with the Beast-creation Race Emperor.

"What’s your name?" Chen Xiang suddenly asked, the Beast-creation Race Emperor did not look that brutal.

"Long Yue! My true body is a Killing evil dragon! "

It was actually a Killing evil dragon. Chen Xiang was a little surprised, because he did not sense any of the Killing evil dragon’s aura from her body.

"Is this true? Why can’t I sense the Killing evil dragon’s aura from your body? " Chen Xiang could be said to have an incomparable understanding towards Killing evil dragon.

"Why would I lie to you!" "I have a secret technique to conceal my aura. If I do not release it, no one will be able to detect me." Long Yue said.

Right now, they could only run at full speed. Long Yue didn’t want to face Golden Fire Arrogant Lord for the moment, but he was furious.

Chen Xiang really wanted to ask Long Yue who her mother was. The Evil Saint Body and Killing evil dragon in Long Yue’s body inherited from the First Beast-creation Ancestor, and her mother’s power was definitely inherited as well.

Long Yue’s mother was killed by the First Beast-creation Ancestor, so he did not ask, in order to not enrage Long Yue.

"Where are we going now?" Chen Xiang asked.

"To hell!" Long Yue’s words caused Chen Xiang to shiver.

"Where is hell?" Chen Xiang asked again.

You’ll know once you get there. It’s a world down there, where the Golden Fire Arrogant Lord’s Golden Fire Bird won’t be able to go there. Long Yue said.

Long Yue had been running with Chen Xiang for more than a month, and they had finally reached a desert.

There were many golden giant birds produced by the Golden Fire Arrogant Lord’s Divine Qi. Even when they came to this desert, they could be seen flying everywhere.

There was a very thin crack in the desert, and the bottom of the crack was very, very deep. Long Yue and Chen Xiang stood beside the crack.

"Jump down!" After Long Yue finished speaking, he grabbed Chen Xiang and jumped down. The white mist that she had released enveloped the two of them and slowly allowed them to descend. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"Miss Long Yue, is this the path to hell?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Why ask when you already know the answer!" Long Yue coldly snorted and said, "You’ll understand once we get there. I’ve been there for a long time, and there’s also a path that leads to the Essence Creation Fire Domain. I used to travel from there to the Infernal Realm often."

"Miss Long Yue, do you know Chu Jinfeng?" Chen Xiang asked.

"I don’t know him, but I’ve heard of him! Many years after he was taken away by the Tao-creation Divine Lord, he returned and awakened the blood in his body. Previously, he was caught by an elder for betraying him, and later on, he was turned into a beast slave by you. " Long Yue said coldly: "Just based on this matter, I should have killed you!"

"Chu Jinfeng is my friend, of course I want to save him! Furthermore, he seems to know quite a few things about the Beast-creation Race. From what he knows, there are beasts in the Beast-creation Race that want to become kings and overlords. " Chen Xiang chuckled, "Seems like your Beast-creation Race isn’t completely under your control either!"

"What’s that?" The Most Ancient Era was created by the ancestors of the Tao-creation Divine Lord, can he control it? " Long Yue disapproved: "Unless I have super strong strength, otherwise, in a huge super power, there is no such thing as an absolute hegemon. There is no such thing as absolute control over the whole thing, I just need to control the situation properly."

Chen Xiang had already seen that Long Yue was secretly angry, because she had already known from Chen Xiang’s words just now that there was an elder hiding what he was doing from her.

"You can guarantee that I won’t die, so you brought me along to hide in that mysterious hell?" Chen Xiang looked at the bottomless darkness below him and asked.

"Yes, hiding in that place until Golden Fire Arrogant Lord gives up searching for us before coming out." Long Yue said.

"What?" Then when will he give up? " Chen Xiang did not have that kind of patience.

"Ten thousand years. Fifty thousand years. A hundred thousand years. A million years. That’s possible." Long Yue laughed coldly: "Especially you, even Golden Fire Arrogant Lord’s grandson dares to abuse you, I was wondering why this guy would personally come here, so it turns out that his grandson has been captured for a long time."

"I can’t wait that long!" Chen Xiang frowned.

"Then what can you do?" Long Yue laughed disdainfully: "Could it be that you plan to cultivate behind closed doors in hell and go back up after your strength increases? Dream on! "
