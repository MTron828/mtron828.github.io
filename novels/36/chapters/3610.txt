"Should I destroy it?" Chen Xiang wanted to try and burn this medicine that looked like it was carved from crystal with Little White Fox.

He Fengyuan said: "It’s best if you don’t want it. This medicinal pattern should be able to raise the quality of the pill, I think it’s best if it is not destroyed! I suggest that you refine the other two supplementary ingredients right now. "

"Then use those two supplementary medicinal ingredients as the main body of the Core Formation stage. Finally, compress the medicinal pattern to a very small size and insert it into the half completed version of the Yuangang Divine Xu Grass and the Violet Spirit Fruit."

Chen Xiang took a deep breath. To refine this medicine into a very small mark seemed to be extremely difficult, and later on, he would have to inscribe the Huajing Dan grain as well.

"I can only try it now." Chen Xiang felt that with Little White Fox’s help, this shouldn’t be too difficult.

He took out the Divine Stainless Grass and the Violet Spirit Fruit and began to refine them himself. He was afraid that these two medicinal ingredients were not strong enough and would be crushed by Little White Fox’s pressure.

Chen Xiang used the legendary dragon fire to burn it, and used half a day to refine it, condensing it into a crystal before pushing it against itself and creating it. It made the quality stronger, and allowed Little White Fox to reduce the pressure in the end.

When it was almost time, Chen Xiang put this to the side and started refining the medicine markings.

"If you press it directly on you, it might shatter. Senior-apprentice Brother, use the fire to soften it first." Little White Fox said.

"I think so too." Chen Xiang released the legendary dragon fire to burn. After burning it for an entire day, the medicine markings became a bit more flexible. Afterwards, Little White Fox released the pressure on the markings, carefully removing them from Xiaoyao’s body to ensure that they wouldn’t deform.

This process required a lot of care and attention. If there was any mistake, the medicine mark would be wasted.

Chen Xiang also had to be extremely precise in controlling the flames to burn, even if the flames were too strong and too weak.

"If I was the only one, I wouldn’t have been able to succeed." Chen Xiang sighed, Little White Fox had exerted a lot of power.

"We are martial brothers and sisters, it is great to be able to refine pills together. Without senior brother, I simply do not know how to do it." Little White Fox laughed: "I should be like a supplementary medicine when refining pills."

Chen Xiang smiled and patted Little White Fox’s head: "Junior Sister is too modest."

Little White Fox spent an entire month to get the medicine markings to become extremely small, and it was extremely smooth and perfectly engraved on the pellet.

In the end, after the Zaoyuan purple bamboo, the Divine Stomp Grass and the Violet Spirit Fruit were refined and fused together in a strange state, this was the first time Chen Xiang had done such a thing.

"The quality of this pill is already very high." Chen Xiang could clearly feel that it was not over yet, he had only completed half of it, the other half was to inscribe Huajing Dan grain.

Huajing Dan grain were extremely important, they could raise the quality of a pill by several times.

"This might require a lot of Tao-creation’s Divine Crystals." Chen Xiang had this premonition.

Su Meiyao had previously refined quite a few Peak dan s and they were all created while she was playing with them. Hua Liqing had sold a total of 400 of them, and after giving Yang Genming back the twenty thousand, he still had twenty thousand Tao-creation Divine Crystals on his hands.

"It should be enough." Chen Xiang looked at the Tao-creation Divine Crystal that he had and thought.

Then, he began to inscribe the Huajing Dan grain.

In the past, after successfully inscribing the Huajing Dan grain, one would still need to inject a large amount of life force into it. However, after Xiao Xianglin improved the Huajing Dan grain, all he needed to do was to place the Tao-creation Divine Crystal inside the Tianchuang furnace.

The process of carving the Huajing Dan grain was completed very quickly.

"Begin inserting the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystal." Chen Xiang put in a thousand Tao-creation Divine Crystals and then looked at the number of Tao-creation Divine Crystals together with Little White Fox.

After the energy inside the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystal is drained, it will slowly decrease in size and eventually dissipate.

It was just that not long after, there weren’t many Holy Crystals of the Tao-creation left.

"So fast!" Little White Fox exclaimed.

A day later, all the thousand Tao-creation Sacred Crystals had disappeared. Chen Xiang was already mentally prepared, and knew that the energy this pellet required was extremely large, but he was still shocked; over a thousand Tao-creation Sacred Crystals were used up in a single day.

Chen Xiang continued to insert one thousand Tao-creation Holy Crystals.

In another day’s time, Chen Xiang finished absorbing all the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals. Actually, Chen Xiang was very happy when he saw how fast this pellet was absorbing the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals, which meant this pellet was very strong.

Five days had passed and he had used up five thousand Tao-creation’s Divine Crystals. The pellet began to tremble and the Huajing Dan grain turned red as it continuously flickered.

"It’s a success!" Little White Fox shouted in shock. She and Chen Xiang had refined many Peak dan before, so she knew what would happen after she succeeded. Because she was also involved in refining pills, she had a sense of accomplishment.

Chen Xiang smiled and nodded.

"Senior brother, quickly try and see what effects it has." Little White Fox said: "Also, what is the name of this pill?"

"It depends on the effects when you name it. I’ll give it a try first. When the time comes, I’ll let you name it." Chen Xiang said as he took out the pellet from the furnace. Holding it in his hand, he felt the weight of the pellet was extremely heavy.

Little White Fox was very much looking forward to the results, and then, he was also thinking about the name.

After Chen Xiang ate the pellet, he felt a heavy feeling in his stomach, making him feel uncomfortable. However, the pellet soon had an effect as it was able to stay suspended in his dantian, then it started to spin very quickly, releasing a large amount of red energy that spread to all parts of his body.

Little White Fox could see at this moment that Chen Xiang’s entire face was flushed red, and following that, his entire body’s skin turned very red. Even the whites of his eyes were red, making him look somewhat terrifying.

"Senior Brother... Are you all right? " Little White Fox was a little worried.

"I’m fine. It’s very comfortable." Chen Xiang laughed: "This may take a very long time to refine."

"Mm, it’s alright. I’ll accompany you." Little White Fox said.

"No need to accompany me. Go find Master or play with Xueyi for a few days, the energy that I feel is too strong." Even Chen Xiang himself was afraid.

"Yes." Little White Fox listened to Chen Xiang very well and immediately walked out of the Time Formation.

Chen Xiang continued to refine the energy in the pellet. A hundred years had passed and the pellet was still revolving in his dantian, releasing the blood red energy.

But at this moment, there was suddenly a change. What came out wasn’t the mist, but the blood-red liquid.

"It’s blood!" Chen Xiang’s heart trembled, a large amount of blood poured into his body, fusing with his own blood and permeating everywhere.

A lot of blood gushed out of the pellet, continuously fusing with the blood in his body, seeping into his muscles and bones, rapidly increasing the strength of his body. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

"What a terrifying pill. Feng Yuan is right, the Divine Sturgeon Grass and the Violet Spirit Fruit have a huge reaction with the Zaoyuan purple bamboo." Chen Xiang sighed in his heart.

Just like this, that pellet gushed with blood for over a hundred years. After a hundred years of tempering his body with this blood, it had become much stronger.

"The pill has turned purple. It’s not over yet." Chen Xiang didn’t know when this pellet’s energy would be used up. This pellet was simply too frightening, no wonder it could absorb five thousand Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals.
