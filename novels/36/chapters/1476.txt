Even though that group of Evil beast were stupid, they seemed to know that someone was going to take away the main Star core, so they rushed towards the short mountain without a care for their own safety.

When the beasts were chasing after Little Lizhi, they had already trampled many big trees in the forest. At this moment, they could clearly see the short mountain from afar.

"What is this guy doing? Hurry up and get it." Little Lizhi initially thought that Chen Xiang was as straightforward as before, but now, he dragged his feet and stood there.

Little Lizhi had killed dozens of Evil beast and had some of them fight back against her.

"The Evil beast have returned." Long Xueyi said: "The one thousand that is rushing in the front is the strongest, I’m afraid you cannot handle it, so quickly settle it."

Seeing that the group of Evil beast was about to return, Chen Xiang clenched his teeth and threw the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword high into the sky. Then, he used his mind to control the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword and made it become as large as a thirty thousand meter tall mountain.

"I’ll just have to wait and see." Chen Xiang released more than half of his sacred and divine power from his body into the divine blade, and then let the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword fall down.

Not far away, Little Lizhi saw the gigantic and shocking divine blade, as well as the engraved gigantic green dragon. She knew immediately that this was the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword, she was extremely shocked and immediately thought of many things, including the fact that the Hundreds of Flowers Heavenly Emperor was actually Chen Xiang.

The Green dragon demon-slain broadsword s had now become extremely huge, and in front of the gigantic blade, the short mountain was like a small steamed bun, fiercely thrusting down the divine blade, the heavy divine blade caused a very strong force when it fell down, and when the tip of the blade touched the mountain, it created a burst of cyan colored strong light, causing a shockwave that flattened the surroundings, and the Evil beast that were rushing over were also blown away by the remnant waves of the divine power.

Chen Xiang relied on his own strength and was only blown a few steps back.

Boom.

The short mountain exploded, a large piece of solid rock flew out in all directions following the shock wave. Some of the Evil beast were struck by the rocks, and even their bodies were smashed into pieces. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Chen Xiang was already prepared, and immediately jumped into the middle. Long Xueyi had already used her divine power to find that piece of Star core, which was only as big as a fist, but the energy it contained made Chen Xiang feel fear.

Chen Xiang withdrew his Green dragon demon-slain broadsword and released his Holy Devil-suppressing seal, allowing it to float in the air in front of him. The moment he saw the Evil beast, he controlled it to smash onto the ground.

"Come here." Releasing his divine power, Chen Xiang made a grasping motion with his palm, causing several hundred Evil beast s to fly over and be caught by him. At this moment, he had also arrived beside the astonished Little Lizhi.

"Let’s go."

Chen Xiang withdrew his Holy Devil-suppressing seal, grabbed Little Lizhi, stepped on the Shrinking step, traveled through space, and quickly got rid of those thousands of crazy Evil beast. Those were all Immortal-becoming realm s, and they were not easy to deal with.

Very soon, Chen Xiang brought Little Lizhi to a peaceful place. Little Lizhi frowned and snorted, "You really are Chen Xiang."

Previously, Lv Qilian had thought that he was Chen Xiang, but later on, something had changed her mind.

"That’s right, the third condition that you agree to give me away now is that you are not to tell your Asgard Mistress about me being Chen Xiang." Chen Xiang threw a small bag to Little Lizhi. Inside it, there were a few Evil beast s, there were more than 200 of them.

"This is for you." Chen Xiang laughed.

"Bastard, why did you harm the Palace Master?" Little Lizhi expressed his confusion.

"I have a little conflict with her. I just want to disgust her a little." Chen Xiang laughed: "You must remember to fulfill the third agreement, if not ..."

"Otherwise what?" said in a cold voice. She actually wanted to tell Lv Qilian about Chen Xiang’s identity, but she couldn’t go back on her words. She really didn’t want to see her own Asgard Mistress being played by Chen Xiang in the middle of the applause.

"It doesn’t matter. In short, I won’t trust you in the future. If you don’t fulfill your promise, then in my eyes, you are an ungrateful vile character." Chen Xiang sighed, to deal with someone like Little Lizhi who had strong principles, this was the best way.

She felt that Chen Xiang was just competing in intelligence with Lv Qilian. In this aspect, Lv Qilian had indeed lost, and he had lost very miserably, so even now, he still did not know.

"I don’t understand, the palace masters and the experts of the Devil-suppressing Divine Palace were watching you closely, but you were able to escape to Xie Tian to eliminate the Xie Clan, and later on you attacked the branches of the Devil-suppressing Divine Palace and the Devil-suppressing Divine Palace." Little Lizhi said: "You were in the hotel all day."

Little Lizhi suddenly realized that when Chen Xiang was fighting with her, she had kept a lot of power hidden. She did it so that she would not reveal her true strength, but she was still very powerful, especially with her powerful body.

"I didn’t do that. Rumor has it that I have a friend from the White Dragon. This isn’t a rumor, it’s true." Chen Xiang laughed: "I don’t have any hatred towards your Asgard Mistress, I’m just playing around with her. I won’t hurt her, so you can’t tell her and you don’t have to feel guilty."

"Hmph." She had long heard of Chen Xiang’s achievements, so she knew that he was very cunning and powerful. Now that she had finally experienced it, if it wasn’t for the situation today, she would probably never know that she had experienced such things in her entire life.

"Don’t be angry. You call me a bastard all day long. I’m always smiling at you, but you’re always scowling at me." Chen Xiang laughed.

"Because you’re a bastard." Little Lizhi glared at him.

"Although you’re a bit rough, I really want to marry you. Little Lizhi, you’re supposed to be eating this anyway, I don’t know if you’re sweet or not." Chen Xiang laughed.

"Don’t even think about it, I won’t marry you even if I die." Little Lizhi coldly snorted.

"Since that’s the case, then I feel excited just thinking about marrying your Palace Master, a generation’s Flower Emperor." Chen Xiang laughed sinisterly.

"If you keep talking, I’ll kill you." Little Lizhi immediately shouted out in anger.

"Hey, if you don’t agree to my marriage, won’t you allow me to marry your Palace Mistress? Don’t tell me you like her?" Chen Xiang seemed to have discovered a big secret as he smiled wickedly.

Little Lizhi gritted his teeth as he looked at him, "It’s best if you don’t spout nonsense. Who wants to be your scoundrel’s woman?"

Chen Xiang took out the treasure web, and sighed: "Although I’m a bastard, I still have a woman, I’m just joking, don’t take it seriously, your palace is mainly my woman, I don’t think much of her, I actually quite wish for her to be my female slave."

Just as he finished speaking, Little Lizhi’s sword was already at his throat.

"Watch your mouth." Little Lizhi kept his sword, his face full of anger. If it was anyone else, they would have been sliced into pieces by her already.
