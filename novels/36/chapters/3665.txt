Chen Xiang ran really fast this time, so he did not feel anyone approaching him. He was not like the last time, where he was almost smashed into smithereens.

"The mine this time is bigger, maybe a lot bigger than the previous ones!" It just depends on how lucky you are. " Jing Yun’er said, she had to stay inside the seal all day, causing her to be in a bad mood, and she did not smile.

"Depends on my luck? "What do you mean?" Chen Xiang was rushing to the mine. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

"You were unlucky last time and ended up encountering that large purple bat. If your luck is equally bad this time, you might end up encountering something even more powerful! If our luck is good, then maybe we won’t encounter anything. " Jing Yun’er scoffed, "If I didn’t have to hide, I would have been able to find a better mine for you."

Every time she came out, it would take her a long time to sense it. Therefore, she could only use a limited amount of time to search for the largest mine. This was indeed a great limitation for her.

"There’s nothing we can do about it. Those guys all have something in their hands that can sense you." Chen Xiang sighed.

"Isn’t it all because of those bastards in the First Tao-creation Ancestor? I will definitely find them in my lifetime!" When this matter was brought up, Jing Yun’er was immediately angered. She had been tired of it all these years, and the whole thing required her to do something that was too repetitive, so she couldn’t return to her hometown.

Now that all the ancestors had gone back and left her here to die, this only made her angrier.

"So what if you find them?" Chen Xiang was very clear about Jing Yun’er’s strength. If she was really strong, then she wouldn’t have been hunted down and forced to hide everywhere.

"You brat, don’t underestimate me!" I don’t have much strength right now, but that doesn’t mean I won’t be strong in the future! Just you wait, I will definitely change my current state, and won’t be the useless trash who gave birth to the Tao-creation’s sacred crystal anymore. " Jing Yun’er was very angry at Chen Xiang’s contempt.

Chen Xiang approached the mine. He did not find anything, but he still released three spirit bodies to investigate.

After some investigation, he found that there was someone inside this huge mine, and he was not weak at all!

"This mine was discovered long ago!" Chen Xiang said: "I just don’t know who they are yet, I will find out after I enter the cave."

Chen Xiang controlled the spirit body to enter the cave and carefully floated in, trying to not make any sound, so as to not alert the people inside.

"My time is too short, and I can’t sense it too precisely. You should understand me." Jing Yun’er said: "If they aren’t strong, then let’s kill them! If you can’t beat her, I’ll help you find another one. Don’t let anything happen to you, my life is in your hands, and my future is in your hands. "

"I know, I’m also very afraid of death." Chen Xiang laughed.

After the three beasts entered the cave, they quickly discovered that there were only three people inside. To Chen Xiang’s surprise, these three people had a very familiar aura on their bodies, they were actually from the God-creation Race.

"It’s from God-creation Race!" Chen Xiang frowned: "I never thought that they would also have methods to find the huge mine, and even sent three strong warriors to guard here!"

"After all, he’s a descendant of the Tao-creation Divine Lord, of course he has some ability! What cultivation do they have? Can you defeat them? " Jing Yun’er asked.

"They are all late stage World Defying Stage Legendary Rank, I think there should be no problem!" Chen Xiang had Chuangxie key, it was very effective against Creation Race who had a higher cultivation level than him.

Moreover, he himself was at the middle stage of World Defying Stage Legendary Rank. Adding the power of the Red fire dragon in his body, dealing with late-stage was not impossible.

"Then let’s give it a try. As long as you can’t win and save your life, don’t think running away is a shameful thing. If I had the ability to run away, I would have died long ago." Although Jing Yun’er was bold and unruly, she could tell that Chen Xiang had a very promising future.

"Got it!"

Chen Xiang approached the cave quietly, he was thinking about how to deal with the people from the God-creation Race.

The 3 bodies were within the cave, staring at the 3 old men.

"Once Initial Thunder-creation Realm opens, we will immediately move this mountain away. This is definitely not a problem for the three of us."

"The Thunder-creation Race actually agreed to let us enter the Initial Thunder-creation Realm, they are really generous, humph!"

"Actually, they are just timid. They don’t know what’s inside Initial Thunder-creation Realm, and the reason they want us to join them is to make us their henchmen."

"This group of fools, they actually warned us not to let Chen Xiang into the Initial Thunder-creation Realm, and now Chen Xiang is even running away! If we let Chen Xiang in, it will be even easier for us to capture Chen Xiang, control his Killing evil dragon, and force him to hand over the pill formulas.

"Those fellows are short-sighted, after all."

Three of the elders were chatting casually when they suddenly talked about Chen Xiang. This made Chen Xiang feel that it was extremely funny, these people were actually trying to trick him.

"Who would’ve thought that I would be so important in their eyes." Chen Xiang laughed in his heart, and then quietly released two clones.

Both clones had Red fire dragon s in them, and under his control, the clones were brewing with power. After condensing the strong legendary dragon fire and pressure, the clones immediately released the power.

Chen Xiang himself was also gathering energy, the energy released by his two clones instantly fused together. After being strengthened by various incantations, it turned into a huge fire dragon.

The Fire Dragon brought a strong pressure with it as it charged into the cave. When it entered the cave, the strong pressure tore the cave apart. This huge mine was also shaking crazily.

BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!

The fire dragon suddenly sped up, bringing with it raging flames and pressure. After charging into the cave, it instantly charged through the huge mountain and charged out from the other side.

The three old men who were talking inside suddenly felt a wave of pressure and scorching Qi approaching them. As soon as they walked into the tunnel, they were hit by the pressure and then pierced through the huge mountain.

After the fire dragon passed through the giant mountain, its power did not weaken at all. It continued to roar and tear the earth apart, leaving behind a charred, charred ravine that emitted waves of scorching flames.

Chen Xiang found the three old men, they were at the end of the ravine and their bodies were no longer complete. When they were attacked by the powerful fire dragons, they were torn apart, then burned by the dragon flames, their bodies burned in darkness, but they did not die.

They laid on the ground, gasping for breath with their eyes half opened. Looking at Chen Xiang’s look of disdain, the fear in their hearts increased to a few points. The person they were talking about just a moment ago, had actually attacked them!

"You must be from the God-creation Race, you’re really weak!" Chen Xiang took out a Chuangxie key and stabbed it down at one of them.
