"We have nothing to talk about. You want to kill me, and I want to kill you too. Do you think there’s a need to talk about it?"

As Chen Xiang spoke, he slashed out tens of times, and the blade lights that filled the sky surged like a tsunami as they rushed towards Ji Meixian, clenching her teeth tightly. She knew that if Chen Xiang did not finish today with her, she would not let this matter rest.

The anger in her heart could not be suppressed. It turned into energy that surged into her limbs and bones, causing her entire body to shine with holy light. She was like a goddess as she floated high in the air.

This was the true strength of her soul awakening. At this moment, her celestial clothes appeared, initially white, but now holy golden. Her clothes fluttered in the wind, emitting bursts of holy light, just like a goddess!

This was simply not an Immortal Robe at all, Chen Xiang was sure that this was his Divine Robe that was as powerful as a profoundwu diamond armour!

A golden dragon that was as thick as an arm suddenly appeared above his head. The golden dragon circled around his body, gradually forming a set of golden armor that resembled dragon scales. This was the armor his martial soul had transformed into.

Ji Meixian frowned. Chen Xiang’s current appearance of wearing the Dragon Scale Golden Armor was also very imposing. Although it was not as powerful as her Divine Armor, it was not weak either.

Chen Xiang did not reveal his profoundwu diamond armour, otherwise Ji Meixian would have ran away without turning back!

"When I was fighting with your sister in the day, I showed her some mercy. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to beat me! You have obtained the Heaven Earth Killing Method, have a divine weapon like the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword, and also have the potential to cultivate the Taiji Dragon-suppressed kungfu. You will definitely become an overlord in the future, and even if you are able to shake the entire Heaven Realm, your hatred and I can still be resolved right now! "

At that moment, she thought about many things. She knew that it was very difficult to kill Chen Xiang as a person and if she were to be targeted by him in the future, she would definitely be killed by him one day.

If Ji Meixian had not chased after and killed Su Meiyao, perhaps there would still be room for negotiation. But now that Chen Xiang had already made up his mind to take Ji Meixian down, to prevent future trouble, who knew when Ji Meixian would recover his strength. When she regained the kind of strength that could shake Heaven Realm, it would be too late for regret.

"The hatred between us can be dissolved, but it is definitely not a way to be calm and negotiate!"

Chen Xiang did not believe that Ji Meixian could not pursue the matter from before.

"You won’t be able to kill me." Ji Meixian’s expression was stern, her beautiful eyes flashed, and said: "How about this, let’s fight a bit, I don’t need my divine clothes, and you don’t need your divine blade! If I lose, it’s up to you! "But you lost. First, you have to return the Image Crystal to me. Then, you have to help me find my apron before you die!"

Ji Meixian was extremely confident. If Chen Xiang didn’t have that terrifying divine blade, it was equivalent to losing an arm. She felt that it would be very easy to take Chen Xiang down.

Chen Xiang sneered in his heart. This Ji Meixian’s understanding of him was limited to the rumors, at most he only knew that he possessed the Four-phase Magic Kungfu.

"That’s not bad, but I don’t believe you. You don’t believe me either. A verbal agreement is nothing." How about we form a Heavenly Blood Contract? " Chen Xiang took out a piece of beast skin. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"That would be for the best!" Ji Meixian agreed. She couldn’t trust Chen Xiang either.

Chen Xiang laughed sinisterly: "If you lose, you are my slave and will have me as your slave for the rest of your life. These are all written down in the Heavenly Blood Contract.

Chen Xiang was a little bit angry. Chen Xiang had actually always wanted to take her in as a female slave. She was a famous Yu Yi Immortal Fairy in the entire Heaven Realm, but she was actually looked down upon by a little mortal kid.

"You are truly knowledgeable. You actually understand things like the Heaven Blood Contract!" Ji Meixian was truly shocked.

Chen Xiang had seen it on that divine book, and the blood contract was also a type of Spirit grain formation.

"Okay then, if you lose, you have to fulfill what I said before, and then give me the Taiji Dragon-suppressed kungfu and the Yanlong furnace, and that will be enough!" When Ji Meixian found out that he had lost and was going to be a female slave, he added another two.

"You’re not bad either, you actually saw through the stuff of my pill furnace!" As you wish, if you lose, your entire body will be mine, so adding on these two things will be fine. " Chen Xiang was also very confident.

At this moment, the two of them were calmly playing with the blood pact. The blood pact was still very complicated. First, they cut out a piece of good beast skin, then they fused their blood together and injected a wisp of their soul into it.

"Your blood is actually golden. Where exactly do you come from?" When Chen Xiang saw that Ji Meixian’s current blood was like molten gold, he could not help but be shocked. When he previously injured Ji Meixian, the blood was red.

Ji Meixian did not answer. When she saw Chen Xiang blood dripping and felt the terrifying power contained in the blood, she was so shocked that her expression changed drastically, especially when her golden blood was mixed with Chen Xiang’s blood.

"Are you afraid?" Chen Xiang sneered.

"No. In order to get a good night’s sleep, I’ll have to make a decision no matter what." Ji Meixian’s firm confidence suddenly wavered, she could not see through Chen Xiang’s blood, and with her spirit sense, she could not feel what kind of energy it was, but it was strong enough.

The Heavenly Blood Contract was made jointly by Chen Xiang and Ji Meixian. Ji Meixian also understood how to make the Heavenly Blood Contract.

After drawing up the contract and writing down the oath, the two of them entered the spirit blood essence again. Ji Meixian wanted to condense a Master-servant Contract onto the Heavenly Blood Contract, once she lost, she would immediately sign a contract with Chen Xiang, allowing him to dictate life and death.

The Heavenly Blood Contract was completed, and it was in Chen Xiang’s custody. If he won, Ji Meixian would be his female slave. If he lost, he would have to follow the rules of the contract. If he violated the contract, he would suffer a pain worse than death, a torture that came from the soul.

"I’m very curious, why don’t you add the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword and Heaven Earth Killing Method?!" Chen Xiang suddenly felt relaxed, and calmed down right where he was.

Ji Meixian regained her confidence, she could not use the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword, no matter how strong she was, she was just a little kid, her cultivation was higher than Chen Xiang’s, and her fighting experience was also richer than Chen Xiang’s, she believed that she would definitely not lose.

"You and the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword have become one, even if you die, I can only obtain a useless blade. I can’t learn the Heaven Earth Killing Method, maybe it will force me onto a dead end, useless to me."

Ji Meixian was still very familiar with these things, she was also adjusting her condition and preparing to fight with Chen Xiang!
