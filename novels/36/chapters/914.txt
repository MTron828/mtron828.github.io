Chen Xiang followed Bai Zhan to a giant tree that was as thick as a mountain. This tree had a few holes, he guessed that there were people staying inside.

"When did these big white cats turn into monkeys? They all live on trees. " Long Xueyi was completely puzzled.

Chen Xiang carefully looked at the giant tree in front of him, whose trunk was like a pillar of the sky and whose crown covered the sky. At this moment, he could clearly feel the powerful vitality of this tree.

"The White Tiger Fighting Race has really changed a lot!" Chen Xiang and the bench under the tree were waiting for Bai Zhan to call Bai Zhenzhen out.

After a while, Chen Xiang saw a very large leaf floating down from the sky. This leaf was as big as a bed, and gently floated down.

The big leaf had a white shadow on it, it was actually a four or five-year-old girl, holding a fruit with many small bite marks on it. She hugged Chen Xiang, and with her young and cute voice, she shouted, "Master, Zhenzhen misses you!"

Chen Xiang put the cute little girl down and looked at her carefully.

Bai Zhenzhen had changed into her human form, but she was still too young. She was actually a little girl around four years old, wearing a set of exquisite white clothes.

Chen Xiang caressed her little face and laughed: "You want to eat my fruits right?"

Bai Zhenzhen stuck out his tongue and laughed: "No way, I really do miss you. When I’m together with you, I can eat good things everyday.

"So you’re saying that you’re really hungry, and that you’ve been infected by that little dragon." Chen Xiang laughed and took out some Spirit Fruits and some Spirit Beast Pills, making the girl dance with joy.

"Don’t call me master, you and I will get rid of the Master-servant Contract. If you call me that, your parents will beat me up." Chen Xiang was very worried that this little girl’s parents were really strong.

Bai Zhenzhen rolled her eyes, pouted her small mouth, and smirked: "Give me some more food, and I won’t call you master! "You will be my big brother from now on."

"Alright, for the sake of not getting beaten up by your parents, for the sake of becoming your little girl’s brother, take it." Chen Xiang pinched her cheeks and took out some Spirit Fruits, these were not considered high leveled, but they were not bad either, at least Bai Zhenzhen liked them, Chen Xiang had never lacked these things.

"Brother, are you going to look for the Prophet? I’ll bring you there, come up! " Bai Zhenzhen hopped onto the large leaf that could fly.

was very happy that such a cute little girl had called him Big Brother. He muttered in his heart: "It’s all little girls, why is it that there’s such a huge gap between us when comparing a certain dragon and someone else? "You are gluttonous, impolite, and happy to brag so much every day. You are also very lustful!"

"You’re not talking about me, are you?" Long Xueyi was suddenly very unhappy.

"I never thought that you would have such self-awareness. I’m talking about you, Little Naughty Dragon!" Chen Xiang laughed.

"Humph!" I, as a dignified Heavenly Dragon Supreme Lord, disdained to compete with this little white cat. " Long Xueyi snorted.

"Oh yeah, where’s Sister Long? I miss her! " Bai Zhenzhen controlled the big leaf to glide around the big tree with Chen Xiang. It allowed Chen Xiang to clearly feel the beautiful scenery here, and absorbed the rich plant essence.

"Little Zhenzhen, big sister misses you too!" Long Xueyi suddenly ran out and allowed the big leaf to descend. After stabilizing the leaf, Bai Zhenzhen pounced on Long Xueyi’s body and rubbed his chest.

"The culprit!" Chen Xiang glanced at Long Xueyi’s chest, and mumbled to himself. He felt that this was the thing that could make the big leaves fly very slowly.

"Little Zhenzhen, do you want to drink grandma?" Long Xueyi saw that Bai Zhenzhen had buried his head in her chest and laughed softly: "Don’t teach bad kids!" Chen Xiang said with a stern face.

"You are jealous of Little Zhenzhen!" Long Xueyi’s small and beautiful oval face was full of pride.

"I only eat fruits and not milk. But if Sister Long has any, I also want to try some dragon milk!" Bai Zhenzhen laughed mischievously.

Long Xueyi actually laughed tenderly as she opened her shirt, revealing half of her jade breasts. Then, she hurriedly covered up her clothes, causing Chen Xiang to continuously curse in his heart.

"Elder sister doesn’t want to see that big white cat. I’ll be leaving first. Next time, I’ll let you drink my milk." Long Xueyi caressed Bai Zhenzhen’s little face, gave her some fruits, and then entered his ring.

"Little pervert, you only know how to teach bad people!" Chen Xiang snorted.

put Chen Xiang down the tree and then left. She did not dare to casually enter the White Tiger’s house, but Chen Xiang could, because Chen Xiang received the White Tiger’s acknowledgement.

"You’re finally here!" The White Tiger emerged from the tree hole.

Chen Xiang saw this ordinary looking young man once again. He looked ordinary with not a hint of presence, but he was the reincarnated White Tiger.

"Senior ... Have you been waiting for me for a long time? " Chen Xiang asked.

"Hmm, I know a little about the matters outside. I think you should have come earlier." The White Tiger laughed.

He brought Chen Xiang into a small living room and poured some water for Chen Xiang, shocking him.

At this time, Chen Xiang suddenly wanted to invite the White Tiger out to bring it to the Three Realms Talk. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

"Why is senior waiting for me? "Why would you think I would come?" Chen Xiang felt that it was very strange.

"You have obtained a Heaven Earth Killing Method, it should be a Ground killing!" The White Tiger said, "You have been to the Lion Mountain before!"

Ten Heavens Supreme Lord is a lion, maybe this White Tiger really has something to do with Ten Heavens Supreme Lord!

Chen Xiang nodded her head: "When I first stepped onto Lion Mountain, Slaughter God’s Hand made me release a very strong killing intent."

"That’s right. Actually, Slaughter God’s Hand is not a complete White Tiger Divine Weapon, only half of it. " was stunned by the White Tiger’s words.

This Slaughter God’s Hand was actually only half of the White Tiger Divine Weapon, and he was already so strong. When he didn’t use the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword, this White Tiger Divine Weapon gave him a very powerful strength, making his hands even stronger.

Chen Xiang suddenly thought of something bad, he took a deep breath and said: "The other half shouldn’t be at Ten Heavens Supreme Lord’s place right?"

The White Tiger laughed, "You guessed it right. When you stepped into the Lion Mountain, you resonated with the other half, which is why there was such a reaction."

"Why is he at Ten Heavens Supreme Lord’s place?" Since Chen Xiang already knew that there was another half, he had to go and find the other half. Otherwise, he would feel extremely uncomfortable.

"I lent it to that bastard. It’s a pity that he didn’t return it to me and even brought it to my grave. It would be very difficult for me to enter that damned place." The White Tiger sighed.

"What?" This Ten Heavens Supreme Lord is really a bastard. " Chen Xiang looked at the White Tiger Fist Gloves on his hands and muttered: "How can you casually lend this kind of thing to others?"

"He isn’t just anyone. He is a member of my White Tiger Fighting Race, and can be considered my head disciple." The White Tiger said.

Chen Xiang almost sat down on his seat. The legendary Ten Heavens Supreme Lord was actually the head of the White Tiger, this White Tiger was really an antique!

"Actually, I feel somewhat guilty about this matter. Because you have defeated me, you should have obtained a complete White Tiger Divine Weapon. That’s why I’m considering how I can make up for it." The White Tiger said.

Make up to me? Chen Xiang secretly laughed in his heart. No matter what, he would have to make a trip to the Emperor’s Tomb in the future, and he would definitely be able to find the other half of the White Tiger Divine Weapon.

Seeing Chen Xiang’s gloomy smile, the White Tiger had a bad premonition!
