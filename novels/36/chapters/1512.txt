Chen Xiang had a rough understanding of the Heavenly Realm. On that day, all of them were human beings and they were very strong, often hunting the strong beasts here. Even the Holy Beasts were very afraid of those humans.

They followed the cat into the lush green mountain forest and entered a cave. The cat lived there, and in order to rope in the powerful cat, Chen Xiang had spent all his capital and would give him some Sacred animal fruit s from time to time.

His Sacred animal fruit s were too low leveled, but cats liked to eat them. Only high leveled Sacred animal fruit s were useful to cats.

"This is where I live. I’m considered half a vegetarian beast. Since I can’t find a vegetarian food to satisfy my hunger, I also eat meat." Mao’er was extremely grateful that Chen Xiang had given him Sacred animal fruit s to eat, so he treated Chen Xiang and Huang Jintian very well.

Huang Jintian said: "Little Brother Cat, is that Holy stone useful to you?"

Mao’er immediately replied: "It’s useful. If I can obtain a large number of Holy stone, I can become stronger."

"You’ve lived here for so long, you should know that there are these kinds of Holy stone. Can you bring us there as long as you take us there?" Chen Xiang said.

Mao’er frowned. "That is the territory of the Heaven Man. They controlled many powerful Saint Beasts. The ones protecting that place are all very strong. You guys are courting death. You guys can’t even beat me."

Chen Xiang laughed: "You don’t have to worry about that, we are not going to fight, we are just going to secretly grab a bit of it and leave. If we can get it, we will give you one of it."

Mao’er thought about it, he felt that both Chen Xiang and Huang Jintian were not simple. Even though they were very weak, they were able to come to this place from the ninth day, and the humans in Sky City, if they were weak, would not even dare to leave Sky Capital.

"Okay, but I want to go with you. I don’t want you to die, maybe I can help you when the time comes." The cat thought for a moment and said,

Chen Xiang had already decided that he would go and face some terrifying Rankers and Holy Beasts. He had to make sufficient preparations and let Mao’er create a secret room for him in order to refine even more Drunk god powder.

Ten days later, they set out,

"Cat, are there goats?" Huang Jintian suddenly thought of the goat footprints he had been following before.

"Yes, but it’s very weak, but it was very strong in groups. If these goats were alone, they would basically become food, I heard that most of the goats were captured by the gods, they should be used to dig Holy stone." The cat said, "The beasts here call the people of the heavens the humans of the heavens."

The humans here were simply too powerful. If they wanted to steal the Holy stone, they had to first observe them, and if they did not have absolute confidence, they would not throw their lives away.

A clear and melodious cry suddenly sounded in the air. They had travelled for more than ten days and were finally about to arrive. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

"Black Hawks with Saint Claw, their claws are very powerful. Right now, they’re patrolling the area, so if they accidentally hide and get discovered, they’ll immediately attack. Many Saint Beasts get attacked when they get near this place." The cat brought Chen Xiang and the others and quickly entered a big tree.

This large forest was filled with many trees, but in front of them, there was a piece of bare land. Dozens of gigantic mountains were covered with dug marks, and the trees on top were all destroyed.

"There’s no formation." Chen Xiang said in a low voice.

"It’s very troublesome to set up the formation, so they let some of the eagles patrol. They have plenty of these eagles themselves, so they can also catch some of them." Cat replied, "Saint Beasts are just too ordinary here. Only the Saint Beast Emperor can contend against the humans in Tiandu, but it’s very rare. Even if they are used, they won’t become enemies with the gods."

"Are there any dragons here?" Chen Xiang asked, asking this question on behalf of Long Xueyi,

"There are, very few. I’ve never seen them, but I’ve heard of them before. They don’t appear once every ten thousand years, but they are very powerful. They should be our Beast King." Cat looked at the black hawk in the sky and said in a low voice, "The black hawk has left. Let’s continue."

Seeing how familiar the cat was with this place, Chen Xiang suspected that he had been here before, and not only that, he had come quite a few times.

When they were near the Holy stone mine, Mao’er brought Chen Xiang and into a deep crevice. There was a cave inside, and within the cave, there were a few vines that could go all the way to the top of the mountain.

"I once wanted to steal a Holy stone, but I didn’t do it in the end because I’ve been here for more than ten years and have seen too many Saint Beasts being killed." And the cat said,

They climbed along the vines and arrived at a stone room near the summit. There were a few holes here where they could observe the Holy stone’s mining area.

"Why don’t we dig a tunnel in from the bottom? There’s no formation here." Chen Xiang said. At this time, he had a panoramic view of the Holy stone mine area, and there were actually some exquisite houses built inside. He did not see anyone, but he did see many goats jumping around in the barren hills inside.

If you are discovered, you will definitely die. You may not have seen the power of those fellows, but after staying here for a few years, you will definitely be able to see how they kill Saint Beasts. "Jian Chen smiled." And the cat said,

Chen Xiang told Long Xueyi to be more careful in order to not get discovered. Long Xueyi had also made quite a bit of progress, and wouldn’t be like the last time when he was discovered by Lv Qilian.

Through the caves in the stone room, Chen Xiang and Huang Jintian overlooked the Holy stone mine area. They had to first observe and then prepare their plan of action.

"There are ten of them, and I’ve already killed one of them. As for Heaven Man, I don’t know. They are hiding inside, and it’s hard to guard against them." The cat whispered, "They mainly use some low level beasts to dig up and find those Holy stone s. They are very lazy themselves."

Chen Xiang asked: "If you were besieged by nine black eagles, how long would you be able to hold them off for?"

The cat thought for a moment. "I’m not sure, but it’s fine if I don’t die. Maybe I can kill a few of them. The Black Hawks aren’t a threat, mainly because of the people inside."

Long Xueyi had not investigated them thoroughly yet, and he did not know how many of those powerful Heaven Realm beings were inside.

After a few hours, Long Xueyi finally came to a conclusion. It could be seen that she was extremely careful.

"There are a total of six of them, but they are all very strong. These guys are all people that have surpassed the Nine Emperors and Five Venerables, and with their powerful Saint Armors, they are probably even stronger. No wonder these little Saint Beasts are so afraid of them." Long Xueyi was also very surprised. "It seems that a lot of the experts in Nine Heaven World are probably in these Heaven Regions."
