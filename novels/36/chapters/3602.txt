After the death of the Wood Mountain Sect’s Mu Yijing, the Wood Mountain Sect had completely disappeared from the Fighting Glorious City. In the past, the Wood Mountain Sect still had shops on the top of the Fighting Glorious City, but now, they were all closed.

Now that Chen Xiang’s shop was selling Peak dan, it caused a huge sensation in the entire city. There were already many powers who were secretly expressing their goodwill to Hua Liqing, and all of them came to give him gifts. Although there were only ten Peak dan, their effects were quickly confirmed.

Yang Genming didn’t think it was strange when he heard that Hua Liqing had sold one pellet of Tao-creation Sacred Crystals, because it was already worth that price.

Chen Xiang stayed in the Time Formation for a day, passing through a hundred years, continuously refining a hundred Peak dan with Little White Fox in one breath.

Ever since the day of the Peak dan s’ sale, other cities had all rushed over, some of them using the Transmission array.

Hua Liqing very quickly sold out all the hundred Peak dan today, but many people could not buy them. Unfortunately, Hua Liqing told them that this kind of pellet would be sold for three consecutive days.

Peak dan s were high class pills in the eyes of many people. To be able to sell them for three days in a row was extremely rare. One had to know that there were many precious pills in shops that were used for auctions. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Since Chen Xiang could refine a lot, he would naturally sell it for a lot more.

Chen Xiang had Little White Fox’s help, otherwise, how could he possibly act like that by himself? After being quickly refined, Little White Fox could not only release a large amount of power of regeneration to activate the Huajing Dan grain, but he could also release a large amount of pressure to compress it during the process of condensing the core.

Although the consumption rate was huge, the absorption speed was very fast, so it could increase the speed of the condensing of the core.

Su Meiyao herself had learned how to refine Peak dan in the You Yao Mountain Villa. With the help of Feng Ke’er and Mei Jing Sisters, she was also able to do it, but the difficult part was mastering Huajing Dan grain s. She was not able to master World Defying Dan grain s as easily as Chen Xiang, and luckily she had always been refining pills using the Heavenly Alchemy.

Using the Heavenly Alchemy to refine pills was already enough to increase her talent. Although learning the World Defying Dan grain was slow, she could learn it, but it would take her a while to do so.

Chen Xiang refined three hundred Peak dan in a row, and after feeling extremely tired, he handed the final batch of Peak dan he refined to Hua Liqing, and fell into a deep sleep.

Little White Fox, on the other hand, was extremely relaxed, as if nothing had happened.

When Chen Xiang woke up, he came out of the Time Formation and handed over all the earned Tao-creation Holy Crystals to him. There were forty five thousand Tao-creation Holy Crystals, and he immediately went to find Yang Genming.

"Boss Shen, when the time comes, it would be best for you to use a fake name to attend the auction." Yang Genming lent Chen Xiang 25,000 Tao-creation Holy Crystals.

"Alright, where will it be held?" Chen Xiang asked. He had seventy thousand Tao-creation Holy Crystals, he felt that it should be enough.

"I’ll take you there!" Yang Genming said.

Yang Genming brought Chen Xiang to the top of a tall building, there were only a hundred people there, if they wanted to enter, they would need to prepare at least thirty thousand Tao-creation Holy Crystals for everyone to inspect, if not they would not have the qualifications, so few people had the qualifications to enter, and as the City Lord, Yang Genming was naturally able to enter, he was only there to spectate the show.

There was only one thing being auctioned today, and that was the Blood extended spell!

After Chen Xiang came in, after waiting for more than two hours, it had finally started.

The person in charge brought up a light golden crystal core. Seeing this crystal core, Chen Xiang immediately knew that it came from a Paternoster beast, which meant that it was very easy to control the Supreme Mantra s that were being sold. All he needed to do was eat the crystal core. This also meant that the price would be very high.

"The person selling this crystal core definitely doesn’t need this Supreme Mantra, he actually took it out to sell." It was said that during the trade, the seller would swear a blood oath to ensure the authenticity of the Supreme Mantra.

The auction started, and the first person to bid shouted out 10,000 Tao-creation’s Divine Crystals.

Each increment must not be less than one thousand Tao-creation Divine Crystals.

Soon after, everyone in the auction hall raised the bid by 1000, and not too long after, the bid had reached 40,000.

At this time, the number of people bidding gradually lessened, and only Chen Xiang and the few elders continued.

40,000 Tao-creation Holy Crystals was not expensive at all to Chen Xiang, because if this Blood extended spell could successfully merge into the Huajing Dan grain, then he would be able to refine pills much faster and more convenient in the future.

Chen Xiang had already used his Huajing Dan grain to refine a few hundred pills, but he still couldn’t refine them by himself. If he had the Blood extended spell, he could do it even without Little White Fox’s help.

"47,000!" Chen Xiang shouted.

"48,000!"

"Fifty thousand!"

"Fifty-one thousand!"

"..."

Right now, there were only three people increasing the bid, Chen Xiang and the two old men.

Those who did not bid, were mostly the ones who did not have enough Tao-creation Divine Crystals, so they could only helplessly watch as others competed.

"Sixty-six thousand!" An old man hesitated and spoke slowly.

"67,000!" Chen Xiang’s voice was calm as he shouted. Only he and the old man were competing.

In the next moment, the entire stadium went silent.

"No one has bid yet?" The auctioneer shouted.

No one bid after that, and in the end Chen Xiang obtained Blood extended spell, causing him to heave a sigh of relief.

He only had a little more than seventy thousand Tao-creation Divine Crystals, if he continued to fight, he could only give up.

The people who came here had all disguised themselves, so no one knew each other.

Chen Xiang went into a secret room to conduct the final transaction. He saw the seller, who was wearing a mask and a large black robe.

Congratulations, you have obtained a Blood extended spell. This is a very good Tao-creation Incantation, you have used so many Tao-creation Sacred Crystals to purchase it, it means that you are a knowledgeable person. The masked man said in a low voice, and then he swore a blood oath to ensure that the Blood extended spell was real.

Chen Xiang gave him sixty-seven thousand Tao-creation Holy Crystals, for him to count.

The masked man quickly confirmed that the Tao-creation Divine Crystals were real and there were enough of them. He nodded.

Chen Xiang did not ask anything, nor would he say anything, in short, the other party was extremely mysterious.

This would allow her to quickly master the Blood extended spell. Chen Xiang had already eaten one before, and grasped the Illusory Body Incantation so that he wouldn’t be able to eat it again for a fixed amount of time.

The masked man gave Chen Xiang a very strange feeling, he couldn’t explain how he felt about this feeling. After the transaction was successful, the masked man gave the’s Divine Crystals to the auction, then left.

"That guy seems to be a Paternoster beast." Little White Fox said, "I was not sure at first, but when I intentionally released a bit of my aura earlier, he reacted after sensing my aura. How can he also come out of Tao-creation Ancient Place? "

"The Paternoster beast is here to sell the crystal core?" Chen Xiang now understood why he felt that the other party was not a human.
