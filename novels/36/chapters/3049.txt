Feng Ke’er gave them some Myriad Tao Divine Soil s, telling them to use these Myriad Tao Divine Soil s in a suitable place.

They had tried it before, and knew how powerful the Myriad Tao Divine Soil was, but there were too few Myriad Tao Divine Soil s.

"Alright, Xiao Ke’er and I will refine pills!" Chen Xiang said: "We have to quickly become stronger, and at that time, we can fight against the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain above!"

Chen Xiang brought Feng Ke’er inside the Dan God Mysterious Land.

"There are already Heaven and Earth infinite Dan being refined in the Pill Fragrance Garden, there will definitely be more coming from there. At this rate, there will be a large number of World Defying Stage coming out soon." Feng Ke’er said: "At that time, even if World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect and the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain join forces and attack, they wouldn’t be able to do anything to us."

"Of course, this is the power of pill forging!" Chen Xiang laughed.

Chen Xiang was going to refine twenty Tianyuan holy body Dan pills, so that both Hundreds of Flowers Village and Heavenly Dragon City would have ten World Defying Stage s each. This way, he wouldn’t have to worry about the safety of this place.

One pill a day, plus rest time, he would be able to complete this task in a month. This was all completed with the assistance of his Time Laws!

As this place was very close to the Hundreds of Flowers Village, even if he had been refining pills for a long time, he wouldn’t feel bored. When he felt bored, he went to the Hundreds of Flowers Village to find those beauties to relax, chat, brag, and play with them.

"I have to start concocting pills for myself now!" Chen Xiang planned to take advantage of this more stable period to cultivate to the peak of the World Defying Stage’s Holy-rank.

He refined ten Tianyuan holy body Dan and ate them. He thought that he would be able to cultivate to his peak condition, but he couldn’t even reach the large success stage of the Sacred Body!

"To think that reaching the Large Success of the Saint Body would be so difficult. I’ve truly underestimated it." Chen Xiang felt that he still needed to eat another ten pills, so he refined another ten pills.

Just as they were about to eat it, Little Lizhi and Xiao Baifeng arrived. They were Lv Qilian’s right-hand men and were two women with similar characters, whom Chen Xiang admired a lot.

"I haven’t seen you in a long time! "You guys look more and more like each other. Quickly, give me a hug!" When Chen Xiang saw that they had all stepped into World Defying Stage, he was very happy as well. He did not care if they agreed, and walked over to pick them up, and started massaging them.

"Be serious!" Little Lizhi snorted and used a bit of strength to struggle free from Chen Xiang’s Demon Claw.

These two women were both the type that pampered Xiao Linglong, and looked easy to bully.

"What’s the matter?" Chen Xiang also became serious, but he still looked at the two girls while grinning.

"News from the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain! Qilian told us to come here to tell you that the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain has appeared again, and at this time, she has gone to the Heavenly Dragon City to discuss this matter with Long Jiuxiao. " Xiao Baifeng said.

"She also said that you don’t need to do anything this time, otherwise your situation here will be exposed! She felt that we should not let the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain know about you returning to the Natural Law World. " Little Lizhi opened up Chen Xiang’s hands and pouted, staring at Chen Xiang.

"Un, I understand!" I also plan to go to Divine Wasteland to walk around and attract their attention so that they won’t suspect anything. " Chen Xiang said.

He understood Lv Qilian’s intention, because the strength of the Hundreds of Flowers Village and Heavenly Dragon City had already increased enough to go toe to toe with the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain, and not expose him. This was to prevent the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain from sending out his strongest power in the future, making it hard for them to guard against him.

Little Lizhi and Xiao Baifeng wanted to leave after they passed the information to Chen Xiang, but they couldn’t leave that easily. In the end, they couldn’t just take Lv Qilian out to suppress him, or else he would eat a lot of their tofu.

After Chen Xiang saw that they had left, he licked his tongue. He had known Little Lizhi and Xiao Baifeng for a long time, he liked these two beautiful girls that were like Xiao Linglong.

"Little Scoundrel is indeed not framing you." Feng Ke’er flew behind Chen Xiang and snorted: "I’ve finally seen the way you treat others badly."

"I’m called reminiscing about old times. It’s indeed been a long time since we’ve seen each other. You little girl who has cultivated to a high level don’t understand the feelings between us humans." Chen Xiang said in all seriousness.

"Don’t try to fool me, I know you humans very well already." Feng Ke’er said in disdain, "Big Sister Xueyi told me a lot of things about you."

Chen Xiang did not bother with her, and said: "I am going to rush to the peak of the realm now, and after that, I will go to the Divine Wasteland. I want to see if I can communicate with the Myriad Tao Dan God from there."

Chen Xiang wanted to ask Myriad Tao Dan God something, because he felt that Myriad Tao Divine Soil was something that Myriad Tao Dan God got from above. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have run over to the Heavenly Cauldron Altar.

"Alright, but you must remember, when you have time in the future, you have to refine more Myriad Tao Divine Soil s. This thing is very important to you and me." Feng Ke’er said. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

"Got it!"

Chen Xiang entered the secret room and started his closed door cultivation. He needed some time to eat those ten Tianyuan holy body Dan s and refine them.

Feng Ke’er then went to find Xue Xianxian and the others. They were all from the World Defying Stage, and were able to use the World Defying god fire s to refine equipment.

With the help of the Heaven and Earth infinite Dan, the overall strength of the Hundreds of Flowers Village and the were raised quickly. They were able to fight against the World Defying Stage Heavenly Sect and the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain here, which made it a lot easier for Chen Xiang, as he was not as nervous as before.

Chen Xiang spent about ten days to refine the Tianyuan holy body Dan and was finally able to reach the large success stage of World Defying Holy Body.

"It’s not easy to cultivate World Defying Holy Body. If I want to cultivate to its peak, I’ll need at least a hundred Tianyuan holy body Dan!" Chen Xiang secretly calculated. Although there were many, it was not a problem for him.

"I need a bit more time. I’ll do this for now, I’ll go to Divine Wasteland to find the Daofathers and Dragon Ancestors and ask them about the situation of Myriad Tao Divine Mountain."

After Chen Xiang broke through, he brought Feng Ke’er to the great ocean around Divine Wasteland.

When he took out the Communication jade Symbol paper to send a message, he did not get a reply immediately. He then tried to send a message to Tang Zhongjie, but he still did not receive a reply.

"They’re not here!" Chen Xiang calculated, it had already been a few days since he last contacted Luo Tianjun, according to the situation here, many things should have happened in the past few days.

Chen Xiang immediately used the Six Realms Time and Space Door to lock onto Tang Zhongjie’s location, and arrived inside the Myriad Tao Mausoleum in an instant!

If Luo Tianjun had a conflict with the Myriad Tao Divine Mountain, then the only place he would go would be to the Myriad Tao Mausoleum.

"Daofather, are you here?" Chen Xiang took out the Communication jade Symbol paper to send a message.

"Yes, can you find us? If that’s not possible, then we’ll go out and fetch you! " Luo Tianjun replied: "Myriad Tao Mausoleum is also very dangerous, we are being chased by a Divine Level expert from the World Defying Stage!"
