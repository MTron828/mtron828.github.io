Chapter 002: Yin and Yang Divine Veins

The two absolutely gorgeous girls did not move, yet he felt a monstrous killing intent coming from them. Their perfect eyes were squinting, due to anger, but, for some reason, they were not able to turn their heads.

“Sisters, aren’t....aren’t you... cold? Why aren’t you wearing any clothes? I’m feeling cold just standing here.” Chen Xiang did not know what to say, so he asked a random question.

At this time, the coldly elegant girl, with an ice cold face, said, “You take one more step and I will let you experience the pain of your bones corroding. You might as well just wish for death.”

Although the girl sounded crisp and ethereal and would’ve been perfect but for one thing, her voice didn’t contain any emotion. The girl’s looks and temperament were just like her voice. Her presence would cause anyone, who saw her, to feel cold. Her eyes were filled with a cold aura, revealing a deep hostility in them.

“Brat, if you dare come closer, I’ll make sure you regret ever being born into this world.” The other girl spoke in a low voice. Her voice was pleasing to the ear, coming from all sides and captivating one’s soul. Her beauty was that of a seductress, a stunning masterpiece to all those who saw her.

.

Having two stunning beauties standing in front of him greatly tempted Chen Xiang. Though he would never call himself a gentleman, he was not a deceitful person. At present, though the two girls were unable to move, he did not take advantage of them.

Chen Xiang calmed down and then spoke politely, “Ladies, this.....is not intentional. I was trying to harvest some herbs above the cliff, but the cliff started to shake and then I fell. I’m lucky to be alive.”

While talking, Chen Xiang removed two gowns, from his pack, and walked towards the girls. He could see that the two girls weren’t able to move and, in order to not let them feel any more embarrassed, he decided to cover their bare bodies.

Chen Xiang was now much closer to the girls and could not help but let his eyes feast on their exquisite bodies. The elegant beautiful girl could only close her eyes and endure the fiery hot gaze of Chen Xiang, as he looked at her body! She trembled while emitting a cold slaughter Qi, which chilled to the bone, making Chen Xiang tremble.

Chen Xiang’s whole body was covered in cold sweat, and he felt a bit of trepidation while trying to cover the cold girl’s body.

Ahem!

This allowed the girl to become somewhat appreciative of Chen Xiang, and her complexion improved a bit. She was no longer releasing any slaughter Qi.

Chen Xiang arrived at the seductive girl’s side and saw that she was giving him a small smile, which made Chen Xiang’s face slightly red. He took a deep breath and calmed himself down. Only then did he put the gown over her.

This act made the two girls feel a bit of gratefulness in their hearts. They also felt somewhat guilty, as they had just threatened him. Moreover, they were responsible for the shaking of the cliff. If not for Chen Xiang’s luck, perhaps he would have died.

The two girls relaxed a little. Chen Xiang did not do anything dirty to them, and this mindset of his made the girls appreciative. They were very clear on how strong a man’s temptation could be, especially with bodies like theirs.

“Ladies, have you been here for a long time? Can you tell me how to get out? I cannot stay here for a lifetime, I have some very important business to attend to!” Chen Xiang spoke with frustration.

The seductive girl, with a faint smile, spoke softly and said, “Little brother, I have noticed that you don’t have a spiritual vein, and, in this life, you will never be able to become a strong Cultivator! However.....I can gift you an extreme Yang Divine Vein, furthermore, I can teach you some formidable divine exercises and also teach you alchemy, so that you can refine pills. All of this could help you become a formidable Cultivator, but I will only under one condition.”

The seductive girl threw a coquettish wink towards Chen Xiang, which made Chen Xiang’s desire increase a little, yet these words made him slightly startled. However he felt somewhat uncertain, he could see that these two girls were very strong, but since they were currently injured and could not even move, how would they be able to help others?

The beautiful cold girl’s eyes lit up. “Brat, I will also grant you an extreme Yin Divine Vein and teach you how to practice devil exercises! My devil exercises are not any different than my junior sister’s divine exercises!” She looked into his eyes, “Neither of us would lie to you. It is beneath us.”

Chen Xiang’s body shook, only geniuses were born with high-grade spiritual veins. But above High-Grade Spiritual Veins were Profound Veins. After Profound Veins there were Heavenly Veins, above that there were Divine Veins. Having Divine Veins was almost like going against heaven’s will.

“Did you injure your head somewhere from the fall? Don’t make fun of me. I may not have skills, but I’m not an idiot.” Although they were far above Chen Xiang in power, he did not believe them.

“If you obtain these, becoming a formidable Cultivator will not be difficult at all! However, later on, you have to help us restore our strength.” the seductive girl said, shaking Chen Xiang to the core.

The cold girl spoke, “We were attacked by a personal enemy and were severely wounded. We are now unable to move and we even lost our previous strength. Moreover, formidable demon beasts lurk around here, so we have to leave quickly.”

Their meridians, bones, dantian, and internal organs had been hit hard. It can be said that they were completely destroyed, and this was due to the battle with a personal nemesis, which also shook the earth and mountains. This made Chen Xiang shudder.

The arrival of Chen Xiang was undoubtedly a good opportunity for them to leave this place. They knew that this place was frequently haunted by demon beasts and, as they were defenceless, they could end up as a meal, for these demon beasts, at any time.

“You must believe us now, otherwise, you will never be able to climb out of here in your lifetime.” the seductive girl said seriously.

Chen Xiang had a difficult time accepting what the two had said. Receiving Yin and Yang Divine Veins and also getting devil and divine skills for free was a ridiculous idea. But, after considering everything, he could only choose to believe what they said.

Chen Xiang, with a bitter sigh, said, “I do hope that you are not playing me... This young one is named Chen Xiang, how should I address my two elder sisters?”

The cold beauty said, “Bai Youyou.”[2]

The seductive girl with a charming smile said, “Su Meiyao.”[3]

Chen Xiang smilingly said, “Those names really fit you! Alright, what is our next step?”

Su Meiyao said, “We must first enact a blood deed, which ensures that both parties won’t betray each other. We will do this because we will have to live together for a very long time. Transferring our Divine Veins to you is a very easy thing for us. Senior sister and I have dual Divine Veins. Giving you one of them will not affect us.”

Dual Divine Veins. Moreover, they both had them! Chen Xiang’s mouth was twitching. This made it all the more difficult to believe. However, at the same time, his heart was also somewhat excited, because these two formidable girls will live together with him for a very long time, and, for any man, that would be a dream come true, but they still had to rely on him to restore their strength.

Bai Youyou said, “We don’t understand what the other is like, and to prevent that from causing disastrous events, a blood deed is a must.”

Su Meiyao explained the common things about the blood deed and then explained the steps of a blood deed in detail.

The blood deed was simple: first, soak a beast skin in their blood, and then draw the blood deed totem on it, thereafter, write down the contract’s content on the blood deed, then have the three bleed onto the blood deed and the process would be complete. The blood deed will form a contract with the soul, this will allow one to see the contract with their soul.

The blood deed filled Chen Xiang with shock, only at this time did he believe what these two said was real! His heart was also filled with excitement, because, from now on, he will live with these beauties for a very long time. Moreover, this rotted salted fish can, not only, stand up from failure, but also can overturn Tianshan.[4]

After that, the two girls, with celestial appearances, and Chen Xiang formed a contract.

“Sisters, you can’t move because your bones and meridians have received quite severe wounds, right?” Chen Xiang asked, as he just picked up the “Hell Spirit Grass”. This “Hell Spirit Grass” was known to re-grow flesh and bones, and it aided recovering from an injury.

Bai Youyou, while nodding, said, “Our enemy was very strong, but that slut couldn’t kill us directly, due to a blood deed, therefore she destroyed our powers, and then let us sit here to wait for our deaths.”

Chen Xiang’s arrival had, undoubtedly, saved them. Thus, they were willing to transfer their unnecessary Divine Veins to Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang was wrought with fear, these two mysterious girls, with dual Divine Veins, were already very formidable, but their enemy was even stronger than them and had put them in their current states.

“I picked up this ‘Hell Spirit Grass’ on the cliff above. Will this allow you to recover from your injuries?” Chen Xiang asked. Since he would soon have two Divine Veins, the Hell Spirit Grass didn’t matter anymore.

Su Meiyao’s face filled with joy, and said, “Yes, of course, with this we’ll be able to move.”

Chen Xiang grinned, with a simple and honest smile on his face, as he took out one-half of the “Hell Spirit Grass” he divided it into two pieces and fed the two women, feeding the two beauties made Chen Xiang quite happy..........

Although the ‘Hell Spirit Grass’ couldn’t fully restore the injuries of the two, it would, at least, allow their bones to recover without any internal disruption, making it so that they could walk freely, but they still would not be able to recover their strength.

“Sisters, what is your background, and who is your formidable enemy?” This is also what Chen Xiang was most curious about.

Bai Youyou coldly shot him a look with one eye: “On the contract, there was nothing saying we had to tell you about this, I do not have to reply to you!”

Su Meiyao, reorganizing her hair, softly said, “These are things you should not ask, as it will involve you too broadly. You are still young, satisfying your curiosity will only bring fatal disaster to you, which is not good for any of us. Now, let’s transfer the Divine Veins.”
