The dragon did not attack, but had turned into a human instead. Long Yan shouted angrily and pointed at Chen Xiang.

"Brat, what tricks are you trying to pull this time?! Every single time, you just have to come for a short period of time before leaving.

The corner of Chen Xiang’s mouth twitched, this was the third time he had entered, and every time he had not been caught by the dragon, he never expected that the dragon would be filled with grievances right now, and was currently scratching prison.

"Big brother, this isn’t your home. It’s also a very important place. Every time I come, I have to avoid you. I feel helpless too!" Chen Xiang laughed bitterly.

Seeing the thing in Dongfang Xinyue’s hands, the dragon said: "Is this thing used to deal with me?"

Dongfang Xinyue and Liu Meng’er were also stunned, they never thought that Chen Xiang would actually be able to speak calmly to this angry dragon. They both wanted to laugh, Chen Xiang, this annoying brat, was even unable to endure a dragon.

"That’s right. If you don’t attack us, I don’t want to use it either." Dongfang Xinyue said. Although the dragon had turned into a single person and had no intention of attacking, she and Liu Meng’er were still on guard.

In order to make this dragon fear him, Chen Xiang deliberately released the Dragon Power.

"Yo, Dragon Power!" The middle-aged man was slightly shocked, and what surprised him was not only the Dragon Power, but also a strange aura, "Dragon Slaying Qi!"

Dragon Slaying Qi? Chen Xiang was a little puzzled. Long Xueyi said: "After killing the dragon, and then by absorbing the dragon’s pearl, this kind of aura will be condensed."

"Whatever you guys want, just don’t disturb my cultivation." The dragon shook its head and leapt into the air, transforming into a blue dragon that flew into the forest.

Chen Xiang stuck out his tongue: "I didn’t expect him to get scared from me."

"This is a profound Realm, and it’s very big." Dongfang Xinyue immediately took out the map and looked for the direction with Liu Meng’er.

Chen Xiang actually wanted to find the dragon and talk to it, to see if he could take it, but that was a little unrealistic. He was currently very weak, and felt that he had to win against the dragon.

"It’s very dangerous inside here, there are some places even I don’t dare to go to." From the forest came the voice of the dragon.

"We’re already here, let’s go take a look first. If we really can’t handle the danger, we can come back later." Dongfang Xinyue said, and Liu Meng’er nodded.

"You guys have to watch over me. I’m not as powerful as you guys!" Chen Xiang spread his hands.

"Don’t be modest. Without you, we wouldn’t have been able to get here so smoothly." Liu Meng’er laughed and walked in front with Dongfang Xinyue.

"A beauty’s trouble. Boy, don’t be killed by these two women. Your future is limitless!" Although the sound was not loud, Chen Xiang and the rest could hear it.

"It’s worth dying with them, hehe ..." Chen Xiang laughed, he was not too worried.

After leaving the ruins, Chen Xiang and the two girls found out that they were originally at the top of a huge mountain. Originally, Liu Meng’er wanted to take out the Jade Lotus Frisbee, but there was a strange power in the air that forcefully suppressed the flying Jade Lotus Frisbee.

Chen Xiang lightly jumped up into the air. After jumping up into the air, he also felt the sudden pressure, and then, as if he had been ruthlessly smashed by a huge hammer, he fell heavily onto the ground.

Now, he knew how impressive that dragon was to be able to fly around. Even Liu Meng’er, Dongfang Xinyue and the others could easily fly around.

"Let’s just obediently walk over." Chen Xiang also looked at the map. The place was still very far away and this was a very big profound Realm. It was also at the center of the Continent of the King.

However, he suddenly recalled his promise with Elder Dan. If he was unable to make it on time, he would definitely be despised to death by Elder Dan. He hurriedly took out the Luotian Gate, but after trying, he was unable to open the spatial door.

"Not a small one!" Dongfang Xinyue looked at the sky.

"That’s right, there are many powerful formations that cover this profound Realm!" Liu Meng’er praised. To be able to create such a huge array, not only would all the powerful array masters work together, they would also be set up by a very powerful individual.

"Hurry up, I still have a date. If I can’t make it, I will die." Chen Xiang anxiously shouted.

"What date?" Liu Meng’er asked curiously. Chen Xiang rarely had such a worried expression.

"Anyway, I missed it. I will be very miserable." Chen Xiang knew that the Elder Dan had a bad temper.

Liu Meng’er thought of Huang Jintian and did not ask anymore. That old madman truly scared people.

The three of them increased their pace and started running on the ground. However, Chen Xiang was pulled by two women because he was too slow.

Fortunately, his physical body was very strong, and was able to withstand the pressure of such a fast sprint.

Climbing over many mountains, passing through a large forest, and leaping over a marsh filled with foul air, he was chased by a few groups of demon beasts on the way and finally arrived at his destination. It was a huge lake that was dried up.

"The map showed that this place was originally made of water!" Liu Meng’er brought Chen Xiang to the bottom of the dried up lake, and looked at the map, looking for some markings.

Soon, they found a box that looked like it was made of mud at the bottom of the lake! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

"There really is a treasure!" Chen Xiang shouted excitedly. It had been many years since someone last came here, and this was something that had existed since the Primordial Era.

Dongfang Xinyue walked over and gently caressed the box that was covered with the weathered soil. The soil outside immediately cracked and a box that looked like it was made of green jade appeared, releasing a faint green light.

Dongfang Xinyue used both hands to carry it, it looked very light, so she walked towards Chen Xiang and Liu Meng’er.

"Let’s open it and see what’s inside!" Dongfang Xinyue’s face was full of excited smiles, causing her jade face to turn red, making her look extremely enchanting.

Just as Liu Meng’er extended his hand out, he was grabbed by Chen Xiang: "Let me do it!"

Chen Xiang’s impenetrable, if there was extremely poison inside, these two beauties definitely wouldn’t be able to endure it, but he wasn’t afraid. Whether it was the poisonous blood of the poisonous dragon or the strange poisonous Magical corruption gas, they had no effect on him.

Seeing Chen Xiang’s eyes filled with worry, Liu Meng’er felt a warm feeling in his heart and nodded.

When Chen Xiang opened the cover, there was a thick book inside. There was no poison aura, but an extremely oppressive cold qi had suddenly attacked them, and the dried up lake had suddenly turned into a world of ice and snow, the surroundings were filled with gigantic ice mountains, it was as if they had been teleported to another place, a world of ice and snow filled with cold!

"This is an illusory magic array?" Liu Meng’er looked around, feeling the bone-piercing cold wind that was so real it was hard for her to confirm.
