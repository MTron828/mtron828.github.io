"Can the World Defying Stage Clan really not enter?" Chen Xiang had heard from the Well-informed Ghost that the black clothed slaves had frequently entered the room.

"Yes, we will be punished if we enter! Of course, I’m not sure about what will happen if other people enter, but they’re probably not much better. " Murong Honglian was smiling a while ago, but when she mentioned this matter, she was serious.

Chen Xiang could even see a hint of fear in her eyes. Murong Honglian possessed such a powerful cultivation level, but she still felt that it was scary inside.

"But before I ... I’ve seen some guys go in. " Chen Xiang was also really curious to know what was inside. Now he somewhat understood that He Clan could not enter, so he let the black-clothed slave go.

Looks like what Murong Honglian said was true, there was definitely danger inside, but Murong Honglian himself was not clear about it, so he could not tell Chen Xiang too much.

"Who went in?" Murong Honglian asked, she knew that no one had ever gone in, even if they had, they would never be able to come out, and it was an extremely dangerous and mysterious place for World Defying Stage Clan like her.

"Black clothed slave." Chen Xiang said: "Didn’t I kill the black clothed slave before? I found their memories of entering this Myriad Tao Forest from the fragments of their memories. " Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

"As for why they want to go in, I don’t know! Do you know? " Chen Xiang looked at Murong Honglian who was deep in thought. Murong Honglian was very surprised when he heard Chen Xiang say that the black clothed slave would go in, and then fell into deep thought.

After a while, Murong Honglian shook his head: "I don’t know! He Clan often does some mysterious things, I can only ask the elders of the Mu Rong family! Those black clothed slaves have no emotions, and would not be afraid if they go in. But, you must not go in, and will die inside. "

"Those black clothed slaves are fine even if they enter, what will happen to me?" Chen Xiang laughed: "Don’t be so concerned about me, it’s easy to make me think that I’m sentimental."

"Humph!" Murong Honglian stuck his tongue out at Chen Xiang, then snorted: "This is all for your own good! You possess the World Defying Green dragon, so I want to see how much you will grow in the end, so you can’t go in, and I don’t want you to die inside. "

"You’re not my wife. If you say you won’t let me in, then so be it." Chen Xiang snickered, and then, he flew in on his Six Realms mirrors.

Just as his Six Realms mirrors had begun to move, red light suddenly appeared all around him. In the blink of an eye, he was enveloped by a red domain.

This was Murong Honglian’s Red Lotus Time Domain!

"If I say I won’t let you in, then I won’t let you in. You have to listen to me." Murong Honglian said in a tender voice, "If you promise me, I will let you leave my domain. Otherwise, you can escape from my domain as long as you defeat me!"

Chen Xiang looked at his surroundings and sighed. Then, he placed Well-informed Ghost into the Six Realms mirrors and put it away.

The moment Chen Xiang said this, he wanted to teleport over, but he did not succeed!

Murong Honglian’s spatial and temporal domain had already restricted others’ Time and space power, so he could not use it. Unless his Time and space power was much stronger than Murong Honglian’s, he would not be able to break through the restrictions imposed on him by this domain.

Murong Honglian chuckled: "Now do you know how powerful I am!"

"There’s nothing to be proud of. You’re just a little stronger than me!" Chen Xiang curled his lips and then flew over. He wanted to attack Murong Honglian, but Murong Honglian was like a fish in water within his spatial domain, easily dodging the attack.

Chen Xiang could not use Time and space power s to teleport right now. Murong Honglian was just like a mischievous little bird in front of him, it was difficult for him to catch her.

"Don’t force me to be serious!" Chen Xiang’s expression became serious: "If you still don’t remove this domain, I’ll be angry!"

"I just want to see how much money you have when you’re serious." Murong Honglian gently stroked her hair and mischievously laughed.

"Alright then!" Chen Xiang took out the Heavenly Alchemy Emperor seal and said: "I want to see how strong this domain of yours is!"

Soon after, his Heavenly Alchemy Emperor seal suddenly grew in size, and even released a blinding green light!

Seeing this, Murong Honglian was shocked. This was actually the power of a World Defying Green dragon, and after feeling that powerful and unparalleled Dragon Power, it made her feel no small amount of pressure.

"Don’t even think about succeeding!" Murong Honglian knew that Chen Xiang wanted to use the power of the World Defying Green dragon, so she became more serious.

However, the Heavenly Alchemy Emperor seal continued to shake and grow bigger!

Roar!

Following the sound of a dragon’s roar, the Heavenly Alchemy Emperor seal suddenly expanded by several times, becoming like a huge mountain. The red silk cloth wrapped around it also began to dissipate, and the Red Lotus Time Domain instantly disintegrated as well.

The Heavenly Alchemy Emperor seal was like a huge mountain floating in the air, covering the sky as it shimmered with azure light. The scariest thing was that there was a gigantic green dragon coiled above the Heavenly Alchemy Emperor seal, it’s gigantic dragon head was majestic and solemn. Looking down from the sky, it looked down at the world with disdain, causing Murong Honglian’s beautiful face to turn pale from fright.

At this time, Chen Xiang also deeply felt the World Defying beast’s terror. After the World Defying Green dragon cultivated to large success stage, it had actually become so terrifying!

Right at the moment when Murong Honglian’s domain was broken, Chen Xiang anxiously teleported to him, releasing Six Realms mirrors behind her, releasing a powerful sealing force that sealed Murong Honglian, preventing her from moving.

"You ... Let me go! " Murong Honglian was shocked, she never thought that there would be a seal that could seal her.

This seal was released by Feng Ke’er, of course he could seal her!

"Hehe!" Chen Xiang smiled in thanks, and then, he carried her from the back. He still had one hand on her abdomen, and then, the arm slowly slid upwards.

"Bastard ..." I’m not done with you! " She did not expect Chen Xiang to be so shameless. What made her even more surprised was that Chen Xiang had hugged her from the back and even blew air into her ears, kissing her earlobe.

Although Murong Honglian was not a breathtakingly beautiful woman, her delicateness was still extremely valuable. It gave her a very warm and gentle feeling, and Chen Xiang could not let go of her at this moment.

"What a special woman you are!" Chen Xiang sucked in the fragrance on her body and laughed wickedly. However, his hands still lingered around Murong Honglian’s abdomen without moving up.

Murong Honglian had been gritting his teeth the entire time as he scolded Chen Xiang. Chen Xiang rubbed her face and chuckled, "Forget it, I’m just giving you a lesson!"

Afterwards, he removed the seal on Murong Honglian’s body, causing her to heave a sigh of relief. The moment she broke the seal, she wanted to retaliate, but after thinking for a while, she decided not to, Chen Xiang only kissed her on her earlobe and face, hugging her for a bit wasn’t much of a loss.
