Chen Xiang looked at the World Defying holy dragon in the sky. The World Defying holy dragon was a fire dragon, so he could clearly feel where it was hottest. says the vertex, and then says, "Well, let’s just say that the vertex says," says the vertex of the vertex and says, "I mean, we’re going to say, we’re going to say, we’re not going to say, we’re not going to say, you’re not going to say," we’re not going to say, you’re not going to say,

Chen Xiang tried to float up a bit, but he was only thirty meters or so away before he was pressed down by a pressure.

"How do I fly?" Chen Xiang sighed, then his Red fire dragon could fly in the air: "Could it be that only World Defying beast can fly?"

"That’s not true either. Humans can also fly, but they need some special power ..." Of course, if you were to obtain the Tao-creation Holy stone and refine it into your artifact when you forge it, your divine artifact would be able to fly, and wouldn’t be restricted by the pressure of flying. " The World Defying holy dragon said.

Chen Xiang wanted to try and see if he could get Red fire dragon to attach itself to his body. Even though he could somehow succeed, but he was still unable to fly, and could only receive a very strong pressure.

"When you enter the Blood Wind Fire Sea, you must always pay attention to the changes in temperature. The higher the temperature, the more likely you will encounter the Tao-creation’s Holy stone." The World Defying holy dragon said.

Chen Xiang and Qin Shuang looked at each other and couldn’t help but laugh bitterly because after using the formation plate, they were unable to sense the temperature outside at all.

"Alright, let’s give it a try first!" Chen Xiang said: "Let’s try our luck."

Right now, they had no good ideas, so they could only enter the Blood Wind Fire Sea to look around.

After Qin Shuang and Chen Xiang left the Bloody Wind Island, the World Defying holy dragon also flew into the Blood Wind Fire Sea to search for the Tao-creation’s Holy stone.

"I wonder what World Defying holy dragon want with so many of them?" Chen Xiang was extremely curious when he saw the World Defying holy dragon flying in the sky.

"He might want to use it to forge an extremely powerful divine artifact." Qin Shuang said: "For such a powerful World Defying beast like him, as long as he reaches a certain realm, he would be able to condense his own Life Divine Weapon. If he uses either the Tao-creation’s Holy stone or the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals, he can refine even more powerful ones."

Feng Ke’er only had one needle refined from a Tao-creation Holy stone, it was very powerful, and could easily pierce many things.

Other than blood and fire, the had also gone through this in the past. There was nothing dangerous about it, as long as they could resist the fire inside, they would be safe here.

Qin Shuang and Chen Xiang wandered around aimlessly in the Blood Wind Fire Sea. Although the array disc could protect them, it could also isolate them from the outside temperature. To find the Tao-creation Holy stone, one needed to be familiar with the environment.

"Think of a way." Qin Shuang said: "This won’t work if this goes on, I don’t know what kind of year we have to find."

"If only there was something that could sense the treasures around us." Chen Xiang only thought about it, he knew that this treasure was very rare, even if there was one, it would not immediately appear.

"Chen Xiang, that needle of mine might be useful!" Feng Ke’er suddenly said: "I don’t know what my needle is for, but from the looks of it, it is definitely not a divine tool, because it cannot grow larger, and only has one needle, what can it be used for?"

"Then what is the purpose of this needle being refined?" Chen Xiang had always been curious about this matter.

"It might even be a treasured finger needle!" Feng Ke’er laughed, "Take it out and try it!"

Qin Shuang heard their conversation and was extremely confused, because she did not know what the needle in Feng Ke’er’s mouth was.

After Chen Xiang held it in his hand, he moved his head closer to the needle and asked: "What is so mystical about this needle?"

"Hehe, do you believe that I can use this needle to easily pierce through your Purple Yang Excalibur and destroy it?" Chen Xiang laughed: "Do you want to try?!"

"Please don’t... My array was created by the Tao-creation’s Holy stone. " Feng Ke’er immediately shouted out: "Chen Xiang, don’t you dare act recklessly, the Purple Yang Excalibur is not the strongest sword, but it is extremely rare, don’t you dare destroy it!"

Feng Ke’er was also a refiner and extremely treasured good things.

Qin Shuang looked at that needle, and was stunned, unable to believe that this little girl Feng Ke’er actually possessed such a powerful weapon.

Chen Xiang controlled the golden needle to float in the air, and frowned: "There’s no reaction!"

"Should I release them?" Feng Ke’er said.

"It would be dangerous if I let it out. What if something suddenly appears and snatches the needle away?" Chen Xiang said.

"Don’t worry, this needle has fused with me. With a thought, I can fly it back to my hand." Feng Ke’er moved: "Let’s go out and try it. You are currently enveloped by the power of the array disc, the gold needle in your hand can’t even feel the thing outside."

"Alright, I’ll try!" Chen Xiang controlled the golden needles to float outside.

The golden needle had just left. After sensing the flames, it slowly rotated. The tip of the needle pointed to the side and there was indeed a reaction.

"It’s really useful!" Chen Xiang was pleasantly surprised.

"En!" Qin Shuang also felt very surprised.

"We’ll see after we find the Tao-creation’s Holy stone, it’s still uncertain, but you guys should be more careful when you go over there. The World Defying holy dragon will also be there, and the places where the Tao-creation’s Holy stone and the Tao-creation’s sacred crystal appeared are very hot and dangerous." Feng Ke’er reminded them.

"Alright, we will pay attention." Qin Shuang said.

They immediately ran in the direction indicated by the golden needles.

At this moment, they were all looking forward to it! They were looking forward to the golden needles guiding them to the Tao-creation’s Holy stone ...

For the past three days, they had been following the direction of the golden needles. The golden needles’ directions were extremely uncertain, and sometimes, it was east or sometimes, it was south, so Chen Xiang had to keep the golden needles floating beside him at all times. Once he changed his direction, they could immediately change their direction.

"Could it be that we’ve really discovered Tao-creation’s Holy stone?" Chen Xiang frowned when he saw the change in the golden needles.

"The World Defying holy dragon will pass, and the Tao-creation will run around. This should be true." Qin Shuang said: "But you don’t have to worry that we won’t be able to catch it. The Tao-creation’s Holy stone is probably searching for an energy source, once we find it, it will definitely absorb it. We need to have patience."

After resting, they continued to run through the Blood Wind Fire Sea according to the direction of the golden needles.

At night, the sky above Blood Wind Fire Sea was dyed red with light.

Chen Xiang and Qin Shuang suddenly felt that the red light in front of them was even brighter, and they couldn’t help but become nervous, because there was a very high possibility that Tao-creation Holy stone or Tao-creation Divine Crystals had appeared.

"They’re here. We need to be more careful, don’t let the Tao-creation Holy stone escape." Chen Xiang asked: "Do you have any way to capture the Tao-creation Holy stone?" ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

"I actually used the power of ice and fire to form an ice and fire domain. Within this domain, I can teleport!" Qin Shuang continued: "But because I’m in the Blood Wind Fire Sea, I won’t be able to sustain this for long!"

"What about you?" Qin Shuang also wanted to hear Chen Xiang’s idea.

"I’ll use the Six Realms mirrors! Even though the flames in the Blood Wind Fire Sea are scary, the Six Realms mirrors could still endure it in the beginning. " Chen Xiang said, as long as they were not continuously being burned, the Six Realms mirrors would not melt.
