Chapter 201 - Lu Family’s Secret

Although Chen Xiang resided in the Extreme Dan King Courtyard, he was still given some place to reside in here. When he saw a lovely and sweet girl along with a girl with a mature charm in the courtyard, he could not help but be secretly surprised.

"Rourou, how come you’re here?" Zhu Rong hastily asked. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

"Elder sister, this seems to be the residence of men, you girls can’t just come in here!" Yun Xiaodao’s complexion turned horrid as he took occasional glances at Zhu Rourou.

Yun Suyi replied in a warm and enchanting voice, "Don’t worry, I accompanied Rourou to see you."

Chen Xiang prodded Zhu Rong’s waist and asked in a low voice, "What the hell is going on here? What is the relation between your younger sister and Xiaodao?"

"Well... I never wanted to recognize little rascal Yun as my brother-in-law, sigh, I can’t do anything anyway; I need to make a confession to you." Zhu Rong, with a helpless look, replied. Meanwhile, Yun Xiaodao also heaved a long sigh.

Chen Xiang had a sudden urge to laugh, however, he still held himself back, "So they were already booked, then why did you introduce your sister to me?"

"Ha ha... If you took a liking to Rourou, then she could not marry little rascal Yun, how do I say this... You are a lot stronger than little rascal Yun." Zhu Rong shamefully replied in a low voice.

Chen Xiang chuckled, "Xiaodao, your wife is not bad, why would you become dejected and despondent!"

"She is good, but just thinking about calling this pig as my brother-in-law makes me feel sick!" Yun Xiaodao said in a dejected voice.

"Little rascal Yun, you need to call me brother respectfully!" Zhu Rong also felt uncomfortable, "I gave my sister to you, and you cheaply got her! How dare you call me pig!"

"Father can marry your sister is your good fortune!" Yun Xiaodao shouted back.

"You look like a monkey, don’t flatter yourself. My sister married you out of kindness." Zhu Rong also started shouting.

Soon, they began to quarrel again.

"Cough Cough!"

From a distance, Zhu Rourou’s light coughs came over, "Xiaodao, what did you promise me?"

Her tone was carrying a subtle hint of strictness, making Yun Xiaodao shut up immediately.

Chen Xiang suddenly discovered that although Zhu Rourou was called Rourou, she was not gentle at all. Everyday, he would hear Yun Xiaodao complaining about how fierce and strict his wife was, and thinking of this, Chen Xiang once again had wide grin on his face

[TLN: Rourou 柔柔, 柔 means gentle.]

Chen Xiang shot a palm on Yun Xiaodao’s back and said while laughing, "You actually got married, yet you didn’t invite me, you’re truly lacking a sense of brotherhood!"

"He especially didn’t invite you, this idiot actually intends to hide it from you forever, ha ha ha..." Zhu Rong started laughing, "Younger brother Chen, your information is out of date, you didn’t even knew the wedding between Zhu Family and Yun Family."

Zhu Rourou and Yun Suyi came over, and Chen Xiang, for once, intently looked at them. Zhu Rourou looked gentle and sweet; she had a striking contrast over Yun Suyi’s mature charm and hot figure.

"Elder brother Chen, hello! I often hear Xiaodao mention you, however, he always said you are very busy, that’s why he can’t take me to see you!" Zhu Rourou said with a light smile.

Chen Xiang laughed as he took out two Building Foundation Dans. He gave one to Xiaodao and the other to Zhu Rourou before speaking, "At the time of your wedding, I was indeed preoccupied with something, and I couldn’t come. Consider this as your wedding gift."

Zhu Rong’s eyes suddenly shone as she exclaimed, "Younger brother Chen, you are truly kind!" While talking, he extended his hands to grab Zhu Rourou’s Building Foundation Dan, however, before he could even take it, his hand was slapped by Yun Xiaodao.

Yun Suyi had heard from Yun Xiaodao ’Elder brother Chen is very generous person’, yet she didn’t expect him to actually be so generous. In one shot, he took out two Building Foundation Dans, and he also had a ’does not matter’ look on his face. She remembered at the time of Yun Xiaodao’s wedding, the most precious gift they received was a few hundred thousands crystal stones. She suddenly understood why Yun Xiaodao would make her think of ways to get married to Chen Xiang.

Both Yun Xiaodao and Zhu Rourou were very surprised, they knew Chen Xiang had only obtained just three Building Foundation Dans from the Lu Family, and there was no need for him to be so generous!

Zhu Rong asked, "When I get married can I also have this gift?"

Chen Xiang laughed and replied, "Of course!"

"Ha ha, well then, I just have to get married multiple times." Zhu Rong had just finished speaking when he was suddenly kicked by Yun Xiaodao.

What made Chen Xiang feel even more interested was that, after Xu Weilong entered, he neither spoke nor took a look at Yun Suyi. Meanwhile, from time to time, Yun Suyi would also have strange light in her eyes as she stole glances at Xu Weilong.

"We’ll take our leave!" Yun Suyi grabbed Zhu Rourou and left, and only after they left did the atmosphere toned down a little.

"Everything turns chaotic when there’s a woman in here. Sigh, we even need to be cautious with the words we are speaking." Yun Xiaodao heaved yet another sigh as he spoke.

Zhu Rong laughed evilly and spoke, "Hey, didn’t you notice? Little rascal Yun’s older sister actually took glances at squinted dragon, ha ha ha..."

Xu Weilong glared at Zhu Rong once before speaking dismissively, "This is my charm, don’t just think I’m hated by everyone, I’m also loved by someone!"

This made Chen Xiang and others broke into laughter till they have to hold their bellies!

"Humph, don’t talk about women anymore, we have to talk about our great plan first!" Yun Xiaodao, when he thought of himself calling Xu Weilong as brother-in-law, he felt uncomfortable once again. He had been married to Zhu Rourou for so long, yet he had never called Zhu Rong as his own brother-in-law. Although he didn’t call him as such, there was still a shadow in his heart.

"Little rascal Yun, before I had promised you to help keep your secret from younger brother Chen, but now that younger brother Chen himself came to know about it, I don’t have to help you keep your secret anymore." Zhu Rong proudly smiled and spoke. Chen Xiang realized that Yun Xiaodao, in order to make Zhu Rong and Xu Weilong guard his secret, had to pay a hefty price.

"Isn’t that going too far? Your wife is not a bit rude and unreasonable, moreover, she is Zhu Lao’s younger sister." Chen Xiang laughed and said.

"Exactly because she is Zhu Lao’s younger sister that I’m feeling unwell." Yun Xiaodao shut the door, and the four of them once again began to talk about building their own force.

At this point, Zhu Rong also turned serious, "I looked into the Lu Family and discovered some astonishing things. I think the Extreme Martial Sect should also know it, however, there was nothing in it for them."

"Lu Family’s most powerful is not Lu Shang, but a guy who had entered a devil path sect. Because this was an ignominious matter to the Lu Family, they declared that their most powerful person was Lu Shang. However, now that Lu Shang has been killed by younger brother Chen."

Chen Xiang frowned and said, "Last time during my duel against Lu Zhengnan, Lu Zhengnan had used a very evil martial technique. Was it taught by this devil path disciple of the Lu Family?"

"It is possible that the Lu Family and that devil path disciple still have dealings, however, this does not constitute a threat to the Extreme Martial Sect. Also, the Extreme Martial Sect don’t have any evidence yet to prove that the Lu Family and the devil path sect have some relations." Xu Weilong said.

Colluding with the devil path sect, it was highly intolerable by the righteous sects.

"I’m going to the Herb King Mountain to investigate, I’m not finished with the Lu Family!" Chen Xiang clenched his fists and coldly said.

"I can only temporarily find five good 10th level Mortal Martial Realm martial artists from my investigation, these five men appeared to be very honest, but they are usually quiet and impoverished. They are often despised by some disciples of noble birth. However, their behavior is very good, and even their strength is also okay. In fact, they can be considered as among the best in the 10th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Prior to new reforms, they were all in the 200th Martial Courtyard." Xu Weilong said.

Chen Xiang nodded his head, "We are looking for such people. However, we should first solicit them into coming here, and we will observe them for sometime. If they are trustworthy, then we’ll vigorously nurture them."
