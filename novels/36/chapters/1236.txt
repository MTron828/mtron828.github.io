Pan Yunlan had also sensed the aura and her expression suddenly changed. She shouted in despair, "Don’t kill him ..."

However, Pan Yunlan’s words were unable to stop the person who was determined to kill. A blood-red sword had already pierced Chen Xiang’s body, and fresh blood dripped onto the ground.

Hmph, this guy knows too much, he must be dead, and you are already a member of the Divine Devil Cult. If it wasn’t for the fact that you still have some use, I would have killed those two little girls long ago, and let them truly die. You better listen carefully, you got lucky, and are still able to live.

The person who suddenly appeared was a big bearded man, dressed in all white, with a normal appearance, he pulled out the sword that had pierced into Chen Xiang’s Dantian, causing Chen Xiang to fall on the ground and ruthlessly trample on Chen Xiang’s abdomen, causing a large piece of flesh to splash out.

"If you’re lucky enough to survive, don’t count on dying so easily. Even if you die, you will still be the ghost of the Divine Devil Cult ..."

Just as he said the word "ghost", the big sized man’s Dantian was suddenly pierced through from behind. Pan Yunlan, who was facing the big sized man, saw a dagger in his hand, coming out from the big sized man’s abdomen. That dagger, was precisely in Chen Xiang’s hand.

However, she had personally seen Chen Xiang’s Dantian being pierced through by a sword. After losing his power, Chen Xiang was ruthlessly stomped into mincemeat by the big sized man.

"Since you said it like that, I’ll let you have a taste of what it is like to be the ghost of a Divine Devil Cult, it’s hard to send you off." Chen Xiang’s other hand was already condensed with a strong flame power. It merged with the powerful Dragon Power and Body of Heavenly Sage and struck towards the back of the big sized man.

A slight tremor caused the iceberg to shake, causing a lot of snow to fall, and the big man’s body was also turned to dust by the palm.

"Just what does this guy look like? He was killed by me before even seeing him. Maybe he is the guy I mentioned before." Chen Xiang blew at the dust on his hands, and the transformed body on the ground slowly disappeared.

"You ..." Pan Yunlan slumped on the chair: "I should have long guessed who you are. As expected, the seal that can suppress the Immortal King can’t even trap you."

She could be said to be extremely familiar with Chen Xiang, but she had never seen him before. Furthermore, she knew that Liu Meng’er had an extraordinary attitude towards him, even though it was concealed well, she had watched over Liu Meng’er as he grew up, so she couldn’t hide it from her.

Even if Xue Xianxian and the others did not mention it, the entire New Imperial Heaven World would still be covered in it. Previously, Xue Xianxian and Leng Youlan had promised her that he would help her ask for some high levelled medicinal pellets to extend her life, but now, Chen Xiang had personally sent them over.

Pan Yunlan had met this legendary man before, and he had lived up to his name. A disciple with pretty good strength in the Divine Devil Cult was killed by Chen Xiang just like that, but Chen Xiang’s cultivation was only at the Nirvana Tribulation level.

"Are you training in the Divine Path as well? The technique you used just now should be one of the divine abilities of the Divine Path." Pan Yunlan sighed and asked.

Chen Xiang did not answer. This was one of his big secrets, so he asked: "You can talk about your relationship with Divine Devil Cult now. If necessary, I will eradicate Divine Devil Cult from existence."

"I have already been branded with the Divine Devil Cult’s spirit mark. If I say it out loud, I will die. If you really want to know, then I will say it out loud. Pan Yunlan looked at Chen Xiang with a pair of lifeless eyes. It seemed that she really wanted to die.

"Was it because he was controlled by the Divine Devil Cult?" Chen Xiang asked.

Pan Yunlan nodded his head: "This is not my original intention, there are some things that I cannot decide. If this goes on, even if no one kills me, I will kill myself, if not I will definitely do something that would let down those two little girls."

"The reason why I can live to this day is all because Meng’er’s mother took me in back then, and told me to stay in the Icy Wind Valley ..."

Without waiting for her to finish speaking, Chen Xiang extended his hand and pressed it on her head, and at the same time, poured a vast amount of divine power into it.

"Don’t resist, I’ll see if I can help you get that thing away." Chen Xiang said.

"Please do not do this, if this spirit mark is no longer there, the Divine Devil Cult’s experts will immediately come over." Pan Yunlan immediately used his mind to stop Chen Xiang’s God Power from entering her sea of consciousness.

"It’s good that they came. I’ll go look for them when I can." Chen Xiang frowned: "If you continue to resist, don’t blame me for being impolite."

"Forget it." Pan Yunlan sighed, his entire body relaxed.

As expected, Chen Xiang found a spirit mark in her sea of consciousness, but that spirit mark was on the body of a five or six-year-old girl.

In Pan Yunlan’s sea of consciousness, she already had divine soul and had even grown up to look like she was a few years old. The mind brand was right between her eyebrows, and it looked like a very, very small palm image.

"Little Naughty Dragon, is there any way to get rid of that thing?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Yes, but I’ll have to control your divine power. Leave it to me." Long Xueyi was also spying on Pan Yunlan’s sea of consciousness, she understood divine soul very well.

Long Xueyi also released his extremely strong divine power and fused it with Chen Xiang’s, enveloping the divine soul in Pan Yunlan’s sea of consciousness.

"Ahh ..." Pan Yunlan suddenly screamed, but was tied up by the Water Vine.

"Endure it, as long as you can endure through it, you will be free from the Divine Devil Cult, and I will take care of the rest." Chen Xiang bellowed, causing Pan Yunlan’s entire body to twitch and scream in pain as a burst of energy surged out from his body, resisting the pain.

The duration was not very long, it only took two hours to complete, the spirit brand had already been separated and destroyed by Long Xueyi, and Pan Yunlan had already fainted.

"This Divine Devil Cult really does have some skill, and this divine soul should have been created by the Divine Devil Cult herself, and the Innate Qi in her body is gradually nurturing devil energy. It looks like it won’t be long before she can truly step into the path of the gods and demons, becoming a true disciple of the Divine Devil Cult. When the gods and demons fuse, she will become extremely powerful." Long Xueyi said.

"It seems that I have to capture that fellow who helped her nurture divine soul. If I can obtain this method of giving birth to her soul, hehe." Chen Xiang laughed.

Pan Yunlan, who had just fainted not long ago, suddenly opened his eyes and used all of his strength to grab onto Chen Xiang’s wrist. "The fellow from Divine Devil Cult will definitely rush here, quickly bring me into the stone room, where I can recover a little faster."

Chen Xiang carried Pan Yunlan and carried her into the stone room, letting her lie on an incomparably cold stone bed.

"You can leave. I’m going to take off my clothes." As Pan Yunlan said that, she had already taken off her outer clothes, revealing her alluring shoulders.

Chen Xiang anxiously ran out, cursing in his heart: "You’re already so old, and you still want to scheme about me, a little kid. You want to eat the old cow’s tender grass?"
