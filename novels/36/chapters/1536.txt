"Is the Three Suns Holy Maiden like that as well?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Right now, it seems that they should be, otherwise they wouldn’t need to be so busy. Those things were originally unsuitable for them to do, but they were forcefully given to them. If they truly have status, they should be cultivating in a very good environment right now." When Ji Ling’er thought about how these three Holy Maiden were similar to her, his heart inexplicably felt much better. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Chen Xiang could tell that Hong Xia was dissatisfied with her current situation, so he wanted to rope her in. He only had that thought, and didn’t know what he should do exactly.

In just three months, Chen Xiang had completely digested all twenty thousand Yuxian Dan. This was all thanks to Ji Ling’er’s help, as he constantly released his energy at all times to help him cultivate. This made Chen Xiang secretly feel grateful.

Ji Ling’er stood at the side, adjusting his breathing and recovering. However, Chen Xiang was still sitting there, compressing the energy in his dantian. The several tens of thousands of kilograms of Holy stone beside him had already turned into ordinary white stones, and all of the holy spirit energy had been absorbed by him.

When Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou came out from the ring, they saw that Chen Xiang was on the verge of a breakthrough.

Previously, when Chen Xiang ate the five thousand Yuxian Dan, he had already stepped into the intermediate stage of the Immortal King Stage. After eating all the Yuxian Dan, he had a lot of promotions, adding the large amount of Holy Spirit Qi he absorbed, he already had the conditions to break through to the late stage of the Immortal King Stage.

Chen Xiang was currently enveloped by a silver-white mist, and his body continued to emit waves after waves of extremely rich Holy Spirit Qi. Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou who were at the side had absorbed the scorching aura, and they both immediately felt a warm flow of air circulating inside their bodies, which was of great benefit to them.

"His situation is very complicated, and his cultivation is very different from normal. If it was any ordinary person, and with my help, they would have eaten so many Grade Two Immortal Yuxian Dan, he should not be far from the Immortal-becoming realm. But right now, he is only preparing to break through to the late Immortal King Stage." Ji Ling’er recovered quite a bit of his vitality as he looked at Chen Xiang with furrowed brows. Previously, Chen Xiang had told her that he had cultivated five Heaven Pellets in his body.

The spirit power that was absorbed into it had entered into the beast type Heavenly Pellets, making them even more powerful. They rolled around actively in the inner parts of the Heavenly Pellets, causing the five beast type Heavenly Pellets to look like clouds that were emitting multicolored light. When the mist merged together, it formed a silver white energy that overflowed from Chen Xiang’s body.

Just as Chen Xiang was running his cultivation technique to cultivate, while carefully observing the beast-shaped Heavenly Pills, he suddenly saw a shocking scene. The five small, exquisite Beast statue opened their eyes.

This kind of eye was like a living beast’s eye, it had a bit of Spirit Qi, and the eyes before was just the kind of eyes that belonged to statues. This really scared Chen Xiang, he did not expect that his five beast type Heaven Pills would actually give birth to his own Spirit Qi.

At this time, the aura around Chen Xiang’s body became more and more berserk, like a ferocious beast that was surrounding him, as if it was going to grab and break him to pieces.

"What happened? It wasn’t like this when I broke through." Ji Ling’er said in shock: "Could it be that he is about to enter the Immortal-becoming realm, that is impossible."

No matter how they looked at it, it did not seem to be a good thing. They clearly knew that Chen Xiang’s cultivation method was indeed different from that of an ordinary person, and they had no idea what would happen if they were to continue walking forward. There were simply no instances that could be used as reference.

"He’s absorbing a huge amount of Holy Spirit Qi." Ji Ling’er sensed that the Holy Spirit Qi in his surroundings had become extremely thin, and a large amount of it was sucked out by Chen Xiang in an instant.

Seeing that, Ji Ling’er anxiously took out many Holy stone s and stacked them beside Chen Xiang.

Not long after the Holy stone was taken out, five illusions appeared on Chen Xiang’s body. Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermillion Bird, Black Tortoise and a gigantic beast covered in red scales. These illusions released five different colored light.

"What on earth is in his body?" When Ji Ling’er saw the five Divine Martial Holy Beasts appearing from Chen Xiang’s body, he could not help but shout out in alarm. The Spirit Qi inside the Holy stone was dissipating extremely quickly.

Bai Youyou frowned: "Originally that should be an elephant, but now it seems to be evolving ... "Don’t tell me he’s going to turn into a Qilin?"

Su Meiyao nodded his head: "That’s right, it looks like a Qilin. Over the years, he has mainly focused on fire, and never would have thought that he would turn the divine elephant that is guarding the great earth into a Fire unicorn."

Chen Xiang was also very shocked by the quick change in his body. This change happened all of a sudden, and in the beginning, it was still the beast type Heaven Pills that opened their eyes, but in the end they left his body and ran out. He was completely unable to guess what would happen next.

What made him at ease was that his current situation was quite stable, and the rate at which he absorbed the Holy Spirit Qi had become extremely fast. As long as he continued to operate multiple divine arts, this situation would continue.

Seeing that Chen Xiang had gradually stabilized himself, Ji Ling’er heaved a sigh of relief and said: "Looks like he has really triggered an opportunity. The reason he could directly enter the Immortal-becoming realm might be due to the Holy Spirit Qi that he had converted in his body before.

"Ling’er, don’t worry. He’ll return those Holy stone to you in the future. Right now, take them out and let him get past this first." Su Meiyao said.

"Do I look like such a petty person?" Ji Ling’er giggled. In this past year, her relationship with Su Meiyao had become very good.

"It seems he still needs a long time to train." Bai Youyou said: "Ling’er, you must continue to suffer."

The secret room was not very big, but Chen Xiang needed a lot of Holy stone. Ji Ling’er was responsible for providing the Holy stone to Chen Xiang to absorb, so she took out a huge pile of Holy stone and arranged the Holy stone neatly in a few circles around Chen Xiang.

At this time, Chen Xiang had already completely lost contact with the outside world. He realized that the Divine Sense Sea had already lost control of himself and was rolling around non-stop, while his dantian that was covered by the grayish-black mist seemed to be slowly entering the Divine Sense Sea’s body.

Seeing such a thing happening, Chen Xiang was wild with joy, because this was the sign of the fusion of the Holy Spirit and Divine Spirit Realm. He did not expect himself to enter this stage before advancing into the late stage of the Immortal King Realm.

"Looks like I’ll have to move my dantian into the Divine Sense Sea from now on, but I’ll have to continue cultivating my body. My divine soul and body are both equally strong." Chen Xiang thought:
