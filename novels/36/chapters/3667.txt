During this period of time, Chen Xiang had been waiting inside the Evil-creation Race. [How nice]. The updates were quick.

The Old Evil had sent many people to investigate the situation and when the big ’door’ of the Thunder Dominion would close.

A few months later, the Old Evil brought Chen Xiang good news.

"They’ve finally ’gone’! There should be no one left in Tao-creation Place now. " Old Evil laughed: "We can go now!"

Just then, Jing Yun’er, who was inside the Six Realms mirrors, said: "Don’t go yet, take away all the Tao-creation’s sacred crystals here! Since those fellows are gone, they won’t be able to sense me anymore. The Tao-creation’s sacred crystals are all yours! "

Chen Xiang’s eyes lit up. There were still many Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals here, and they were not so fast to destroy either.

"The Yuan Lightning Territory is most likely safe. Otherwise, they would not have closed that ’door’." Chen Xiang smiled and said to the Old Evil: "Old Evil, I have the Tao-creation’s Crystal Mother with me. I want her to ’make’ me a little more Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals."

"This... Good, you guys hurry up, you guys better refine the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystal into the Tao-creation’s Divine Bead, this will make it easier to store readings. " Old Evil said, then he gave Chen Xiang many of his Evil Beads.

"Why do you have so many Evil Orbs of the Tao-creation?" Chen Xiang counted, and there were more than 100 of them.

"Our Evil Beads aren’t as hard to refine as the Tao-creation’s God Orbs. We have a lot!" Then, he urged Chen Xiang to hurry up to find the Tao-creation’s Holy Crystal.

Jing Yun’er didn’t need to be sealed, the moment he came out, he felt that there were many large Tao-creation Holy Crystal mines. Then, Chen Xiang brought her along to go inside, and along the way, most of the huge cities that were devoid of people were all destroyed by Jing Yun’er while laughing.

In the next two months, Jing Yun’er destroyed many cities and huge mountains. Cotton candy novel, p. 325. p. 105; anhuatang, anhuatang, anhuatang, anhuatang, anhuatang, anhuatang, anhuatang.

Chen Xiang also felt that it was funny, those cities were newly built and abandoned just like that.

With Jing Yun’er’s help, Chen Xiang found many of the Tao-creation’s sacred crystal mines and refined them into the Tao-creation’s divine beads. There were already more than a hundred of them.

"The large Tao-creation’s Holy Crystal mine has basically been found out. Although there are still a lot of Tao-creation’s Holy Crystals here, they are scattered all over the place. It will take you a lot of time to find them one by one." Jing Yun’er said: "The Tao-creation Place is not weak right now, it won’t be able to sustain us for long, it’s good for us too, we won’t consume too much energy when we activate the formation plate."

When Chen Xiang returned to the Evil-creation Race, there were a lot of people waiting for him.

Xiao Xianglin brought out the array disc. Chen Xiang used the Chuangxie key to activate it, but there was finally movement this time!

The array disc started to tremble, and a black door formed from mist appeared in front of the array disc.

"It’s open!" Old Evil was very excited, he had long since arranged for who to go in first.

The Old Evil ordered thousands of people to go in first, and then send people out to report after entering. As long as the Space and Time Gate was still open, they could travel back and forth.

"Chief, the situation inside is still safe. We can’t find any other dangerous places. The environment inside is not bad either. It’s just that there’s a dead silence inside." Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

"Alright, got it. The second batch will be in now." The Old Evil continued to command.

After entering a few batches in succession, the report came out that there were no problems within.

Then, the Old Evil went in, and Chen Xiang stood on the array disc at the end, controlling the array disc to teleport him and the array disc in.

"This is the Initial Evil-creation Realm?" When Jing Yun’er came out of the Six Realms mirrors, he said in a normal tone, "It’s just a desolate place!"

This place was filled with an evil and deathly aura. Although there was a bright sunlight in the sky, it made people feel a sense of coldness. At a glance, it was desolate and deathly still. There were no plants, and it was lifeless.

"At least it’s better than the Tao-creation Place, that place is about to be destroyed, and there is a lot of energy here!" Jing Yun’er could feel an energy that many people could not.

"Will it allow you to give birth to the Tao-creation’s Divine Crystal?" Chen Xiang asked anxiously.

"Of course you can!" Jing Yun’er was much more relaxed now, because she was finally free from worry, "It’s just that the energy here is dense with evil energy, I might be able to cultivate Killing evil dragon here!"

"Little brat, it’s a pleasure to work with you!" Jing Yun’er was very happy, and happily laughed as he left. After he walked far away, he heard her reply: "If fate wills it, we’ll meet again!"

"She originally came from the hometown of the people from First Tao-creation Ancestor. She might be able to find a way back here."

"That’s possible! What are your plans? " Chen Xiang asked.

"We don’t have any plans at the moment, although this place is desolate, we can absorb a lot of evil energy." Old Evil laughed out loud: "This has always been our paradise, we feel ’pretty good’ here."

"I’ll stay here for a while!" Chen Xiang was not very familiar with this place, but he had something important to do right now.

Xiao Xianglin took out a Transmission array plate. This was the formation plate that had been contacted with Xue Xianxian and the others: "I wonder if I can still use this place!"

Chen Xiang was also a little worried, because if he lost contact with Xue Xianxian and the others, it would be hard for him to find them.

The Old Evil commanded the people to build some residences, Chen Xiang and Xiao Xianglin came over to a quieter place.

Xiao Xianglin placed the Tao-creation’s Divine Bead into the Transmission array Plate, then opened it.

"There’s a reaction!" Xiao Xianglin said in surprise.

After the array disc slightly trembled, they heard Xue Xianxian’s voice.

"How are things on your side?" I’ve made some discoveries here. " Xue Xianxian said: "According to our speculations, the Tao-creation Place should be about about to collapse!"

"We have already left the Tao-creation Place." Xiao Xianglin said, and then told the matter to Xue Xianxian and the others.

"Great!" Xue Xianxian also let out a sigh of relief, "We have integrated into another era, and our name is Most Ancient Era! The ancestors who created the era of the Myriad Tao have all come here. It is said that this is the earliest era. "

"Motherf * cker, they ran over themselves, but didn’t bring us along." Chen Xiang snorted, he had helped the Tao-creation Divine Lord before.

"Right now, there are some forces in the Most Ancient Era that are trying to take over our territory. Luckily, we hid them before them, so they didn’t discover us! However, they do know of our existence. Our previous fame was too great. " Xue Xianxian laughed tenderly: "We are also being targeted here."

"Xianxian, have you comprehended the Time and Space Laws of the Most Ancient Era?" Xiao Xianglin asked.

"I have comprehended a little bit, let’s learn a bit of incantation from it!" It is very similar to the Tao-creation’s incantation. After all, the Myriad Tao era was created using this Most Ancient Era as a reference. " Xue Xianxian said: "You all must be prepared, open the Transmission array to its maximum, and we will teleport some things to you."

"Alright!" Xiao Xianglin said.

The Transmission array suddenly started to tremble violently, a few large crystals appeared, and curses were imprinted onto the interior of the crystals.

"We got it!" Xiao Xianglin quickly picked up the crystal.

The Transmission array Plate had been destroyed just now, and Xiao Xianglin had to refine another one.
