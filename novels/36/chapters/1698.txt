Lv Zhen’s words were extremely important to them, especially Qi Shi and Jiang Sheng. Even though they were the peak experts of the Primordial Era, they did not understand anything about it.

"Senior Lu, this means that you must have Divine Deity." Chen Xiang laughed: "I didn’t expect that after disappearing for so many years, you have so many experiences."

Lv Zhen only laughed, and agreed!

With his own strength, he could suppress the Hell Prince for so long, so he must be very strong. The current Qi Shi and Jiang Sheng both didn’t have his strength.

"The reason why I have such a deep understanding of Divine Deity is because I have stayed in the Devil-killing Summit for a period of time. As long as I work hard, I will be able to obtain a lot of benefits. Lv Zhen said: "I suggest that you all make a trip to Devil-killing Summit before the Devil-killing Summit’s Gods leave."

Qi Shi and Jiang Sheng nodded. They had tried to condense Divine Deity many times over the years, but to no avail. They knew that only the gods of Gods Realm could help them condense Divine Deity.

At night, Qi Shi and Jiang Sheng returned back to their rooms to rest. During today’s battle, they had expended a lot of energy and were a little tired, so they had no choice but to rest.

The boat was currently invisible, so it flew towards the Divine Fire Forest at a relatively fast speed. Jiang Sheng who was resting would split some of his divine power to control the boat.

Chen Xiang had not refined the spirit that was devouring him yet, so he ate the pills that were refined using the Saint realm expert. At the moment, he was extremely spirited, and Long Xueyi had already gone back to rest inside the ring long ago.

Lv Zhen was also very spirited at this moment, and was looking out of the window in the hall.

"Senior Lu, how is Sister Qilian now?" Chen Xiang asked: "I haven’t seen her for a long time, I wonder what level she has risen to after breaking through the bottleneck."

Lv Zhen knew that Chen Xiang had been of great help to him, and he was extremely grateful to Chen Xiang in his heart.

"I’m not too sure either. In short, after I gave her a set of Divine Deity, she had been in closed door cultivation the entire time. This child’s comprehension ability is very high, if she were to come out, I think she would be worthy of the title ’Hundred Blossom Emperor’!" Lv Zhen sighed, "For all these years, I have never done my duty to her. I hope that the Divine Deity that I gave her can be repaid."

It was normal for his father to send his daughter a set of Divine Deity. Chen Xiang was just curious how Lv Zhen had managed to get such a set of Divine Deity.

"Senior, where did you get your Divine Deity?" Chen Xiang asked with a smile.

"This... I’m not afraid to tell you, but you’d better not learn from me now. I almost couldn’t come back in the past! " Lv Zhen lowered his voice and said, "I snuck into the most powerful place in Hell and killed two Hell Demons."

"I was originally going to give a girl to my wife, but she had a stubborn temper and insisted on refining it herself. In the end, I gave a girl to Qinlian, who is currently in closed-door training with her sister."

"Hell demon god? Are these guys very strong? "What sort of status do you have in the Infernal Realm?" Chen Xiang’s heart moved. He also wanted to go to hell to take a look, hunt a few Hell Demons and get some Divine Deity. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lv Zhen shook his head: "Not many, the Hell Demon Gods are also Gods, they cannot be ordered by the Hell Demon, Yan Jing, they are only sent from above to supervise the Hell Devil Emperor, but that’s just for show, so killing them is not a big deal."

"If you can cultivate a Emperor soul and get rid of the Hell Devil Emperor’s Tracing mantra, then you can head to hell to take a look. With good luck, you should be able to obtain Divine Deity. If you get those Divine Deity, you must use your heart to purify the consciousness inside so that you can give them to others, otherwise you will harm others. "

Lv Zhen smiled slightly: "As long as you understand how to use the Devil-suppressing magic power, coupled with your ability to refine pills, I believe that after you go to hell, you will also have a good harvest."

Chen Xiang nodded and asked again, "If those Hell Demon Gods were killed, wouldn’t Gods Realm investigate? Will they still be sent back? "

"I’m not sure about that, but I know that there are no lack of small deities in the Gods Realm that possess Divine Deity. Those who are sent to the Infernal Realm are usually those who have been caught in violation of the rules in the Gods Realm, which is equivalent to being sent there."

Chen Xiang suddenly thought of something, and anxiously asked: "Senior, have you ever heard about the Mei Emperor?"

When Lv Zhen heard the two words "Mei Emperor", he immediately frowned, and nodded: "I have heard of it. Back then, when I was in Devil-killing Summit, I had also been warned by the elders there that after leaving, you must be careful of a woman called Mei Emperor. It’s just that I have never met her before.

"Is there any way to guard against her?" Hearing Lv Zhen’s words, Chen Xiang’s heart immediately became heavy, because this Mei Emperor was obviously very capable, to even warn the deities in the Devil-killing Summit like that.

"I once asked a god in the Devil-killing Summit. He said that the Mei Emperor’s Charm was innate, and with the enhancement from the acquired cultivation, it is very powerful! Her charm came from the Gods Realm, and it is said that she trained the same as the charm gods in the Gods Realm. "

The Mei Emperor is actually related to the Gods Realm! Feng Yujie and the Mei Emperor were clearly closely linked, and Feng Yujie also possessed that kind of innate charm power, that was even stronger than the Mei Emperor himself. He suspected that the birth of Feng Yujie and the Mei Emperor was most likely related to the Gods Realm itself.

"Because the cultivation technique the Mei Emperor cultivates comes from, and is a rather powerful one, so in the Devil-killing Summit, we will often receive training to resist the charm, but it isn’t of much use. In the end, after I left the Devil-killing Summit, I created my own Demon Subduing Heart Formula!"

Lv Zhen laughed faintly: "The Mei Emperor’s Charm is mainly directed at males. It is able to arouse the demonic desires in the depths of the males’ hearts, making it infinitely large, and even the strong can’t resist it! In the end, the Mei Emperor will use his own body to satisfy the evil desires of the strong. When the other party was venting his vile desires, the moment at the peak would also be the moment where his mind would be the most negligent. He would control her mind and plant her spirit seed. "

"Only someone with strong willpower will be able to escape. If you can’t, you will become her slave, no matter how strong you are!"

Chen Xiang was very serious when he heard it. Lv Zhen was not lying.

"As for the Demon Subduing Heart Art, it is mainly used to suppress the strong lust that is aroused in one’s heart. At the same time, it also eliminates all distracting thoughts in one’s heart, not only can it deal with the power of charm, it is also used when one is training. First, use this cultivation technique to remove all distracting thoughts in one’s heart, then practice other cultivation techniques would have a better effect."

Chen Xiang said somewhat excitedly: "Senior, you’re really awesome! Can you pass this technique to me? "
