Chapter 170 - The Vermilion Bird Divine Weapon

Chen Xiang felt the Black Tortoise Adamantyl Armor integrating into his body, as if it was becoming a part of him, merging into his skin. As long as he wished, he could release the Black Tortoise Adamantyl Armor at anytime!

The Black Tortoise Adamantyl Armor had disappeared, Chen Xiang’s body had also returned to its original appearance. As he opened his eyes, he started laughing madly. Accompanied with his laughter was a golden aura that broke out from his body. A scale armor dress glittering in golden light was revealed on his body. It was a complete set of clothes, along with a pair of boots, it looked very mighty and domineering!

“This is the Black Tortoise Adamantyl Armor!” Chen Xiang said in ecstasy and glanced at the domineering armor on his body. At this point, it seemed his body was coruscating in a strange atmosphere, similar to a heavenly god disdaining the whole world. This made Liu Menger unable to take her eyes off of Chen Xiang, for the very first time, she felt attracted to this man. This newfound feeling was strangely wonderful...

Now, Chen Xiang not only possessed the Black Tortoise Adamantyl Armor, but he was also able to use his True Qi! This made him feel like he was invincible inside the Black Tortoise Mysterious Realm, like he was the ruler, the god of this realm!

With a single thought, this mighty and domineering golden full body armor suddenly disappeared from Chen Xiang. While the dazed Liu Menger also quickly regained her sense and a tint of red appeared on her haggard, pale yet still pretty face. Her heart was pounding quickly, this kind of feeling just now, made her nervous, shy, and somewhat helpless. Various kinds of feelings had come flooding into her mind, making her somewhat at a loss.

“Sister Menger, how are your injuries?” Chen Xiang asked with a mischievous smile. At the moment, he was feeling very good. Originally, he had decided that after obtaining the Black Tortoise Adamantyl Armor, he would leave the Black Tortoise Mysterious Realm. However, now that he found himself able to use True Qi, he wanted to kill some demon beasts in here.

Liu Menger was still a strong martial artist ruling an empire, so she quickly quelled her fretting feelings and dismissively said, “Much better! Congratulations, you were able to get this divine armor!”

Liu Menger only felt jealous and envy now. Chen Xiang now possessed two peerless divine equipments!

Chen Xiang sat down on the ground. With a mischievous smile, he stared at the extra small box. Inside it, there was really a dan! He didn’t know what type of dan it was, so he directly gave it to Su Meiyao for studying. Afterwards, he opened that beast skin.

“[Black Tortoise External Strength Technique]!” Chen Xiang read with a frown, “The cultivator of the [Black Tortoise External Strength Technique] has to be psychologically prepared. The process is very rough, however the cultivator will gain a great deal of benefits...”

“This is what we discovered together, Sister Menger, do you want it? I’ll make a copy for you.” Chen Xiang said.

"No need, it’s not for me!" Liu Menger refused.

Chen Xiang took out the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade, smiled and said, "Now that there is the opportunity, I’ll let you take a look at my Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade, and you let me take a look at your Vermilion Bird Divine Weapon!"

He set the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade on the ground, the blade’s body looked very coarse. However, upon a closer inspection, one could see numerous small Spirit Veins above it. Liu Menger looked at it with rapt attention, when she reached her hand out to grab it, she could not help but frown because she was unable to move it. Before, she had been injured by the crystal case, and had not yet fully recovered.

Chen Xiang also didn’t speak. From the side calmly looked at this haggard beauty which would make others feel pity.

Liu Menger seriously observed t the Spirit Veins on the blade body. Unconsciously, an hour passed, the Hell Spirit Grass efficacy was very good, and Liu Menger had recovered a lot in this hour. She was now able to pick up the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade, and just as Chen Xiang had said, it was very heavy. She estimated it currently weighed a good tens of thousands of jin.

Liu Menger took out a square crystal, and slightly smiled towards Chen Xiang, "I will now record these Spirit Veins on this crystal above, may I?"

"As you wish!" Chen Xiang laughed and said. Currently, he was in very good mood. Not to mention, he and Liu Menger had gone through fire and water together. Although there was a difference of heaven and earth between the strengths of two, there were not any hard feelings.

With the square crystal, Liu Menger skimmed over the two sides of the blade. Looking at that crystal glittering in a white light, an excited look covered her face. Afterwards, she returned the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade to Chen Xiang.

"Sister Menger, let me take a look at your Vermilion Bird Divine weapon now!" Chen Xiang retrieved the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade and hurriedly said. He was just curious, that’s all.

However, he saw Liu Menger’s face was slightly red and seemed to be thinking about something. Her pretty face was getting more and more red more with time, she was getting very shy, but there was a different kind of charm in it.

“If it’s inconvenient, never mind!” Upon Seeing Liu Menger was somewhat embarrassed, Chen Xiang could not help but imagine things. This made him even more curious about the Vermillion Bird Divine Weapon. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Liu Menger nibbled on her lips. After thinking for a good while, she faintly said, “During my childhood, my parents came back after a long trip from the outside and handed me the Vermillion Bird Divine Weapon. At that time, they didn’t know what it was, they just knew it was a very powerful divine weapon and held some relations with the Vermillion Bird. They also didn’t tell me where they obtained it from. Besides, right after they returned, they went into closed-door training for a very long time, it seemed they were very seriously injured.”

Chen Xiang listened very carefully. It was very important to him because there could very well be the details which could give him a clue about the very last Divine Weapon of the Four Symbols.

“This weapon was a very, very long ribbon. We didn’t know it’s use, but once... I.... I wrapped it around my body. Afterwards, a transformation occurred and it changed into a transparent ribbon. Since then, it has wrapped around my body and it’s hard to take it off. Ever since, it’s been on my body. Although this happened, it didn’t effect me negatively, on the contrary, it helped me greatly and saved my life many times.” Liu Menger said with a slightly red face.

Chen Xiang now understood why Liu Menger was embarrassed. After all the Vermillion Bird Divine Weapon was on her body. Thinking about this point, Chen Xiang’s heart was slightly moved, a transparent ribbon was wrapped around her body, that seemed extremely tempting.

Chen Xiang stared at Liu Menger and that impressive chest, he mischievously laughed and said, "It’s been bridled but can still grow so big..."

Liu Menger uttered a snort and said, "Although it is wrapped around my body, I do not feel its existence! When it touches water, it would disappear, as if it was very afraid of water."

Chen Xiang replied, "No wonder, the Vermillion Bird is fire while the Black Tortoise is water. That’s probably why when you touched the Black Tortoise Adamantyl Armor you received such a big backlash."

Liu Menger also nodded her head in agreement, "Now you understand, it is very inconvenient to allow you to take a look. However, I will not take advantage of you. But you must promise me, you can not speak about this matter!"

Chen Xiang’s heart was suddenly jolted. He had an astonished look on his face, if the Vermillion Bird Divine Weapon was wrapped around Liu Menger’s body, if she let him take a look, wouldn’t this...

Thinking till there, Chen Xiang fiercely swallowed his saliva. This made Liu Menger’s face red, she scolded in a low voice, “I’ll only let you take a look at my back, don’t even think of looking at the front!”

"Can I touch? After all, you had touched my Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade for long!" Chen Xiang said with a nasty laugh, in his heart, he was elated.

With tightly knit elegant eyebrows, Liu Menger stared at Chen Xiang. Her face was filled with resentment, she didn’t know why there was such a change in Chen Xiang’s attitude. If it was before, she wouldn’t even glance at him. However, now she felt less conflicted about Chen Xiang. Unconsciously, a complex emotion once again surged in her heart.

She slightly nodded her head, "You can not touch for a long time!"

Chen Xiang was startled, originally, he was just kidding! He had not expected Liu Menger to actually agree. He nodded his head and smiled, "Maybe I have a way to wake up the Vermillion Bird Divine Weapon!"

Chen Xiang guessed that Liu Menger had no Vermillion Bird True Qi and thus was unable to awaken the Vermillion Bird Divine Weapon. However, it seemed that the Vermillion Bird Divine Weapon had already recognized Liu Menger as its master, so it would still follow her.

Liu Menger was also slightly anticipating this, she knew that Chen Xiang had been able to control the Azure Dragon Slaughtering Devil Blade and the Black Tortoise Adamantyl Armor!
