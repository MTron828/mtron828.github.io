Chen Xiang immediately wanted to ask Long Xueyi about the whereabouts of the White Dragon Sword and Tianlong sword. However, he was currently looking at the few women chattering about how to imitate these holy swords, and he knew that these swords had some special properties that he couldn’t see through before.

Instead, they were able to learn quite a few things. In just a day’s time, Liu Meng’er and the others had already analyzed the many difficulty in refining the Azure Dragon Sword, drawing a relatively simple blueprint. What was next was to enrich the blueprint a little, then after completing it, they would go to collect the refining materials, and then start to refine it.

Analyzing this kind of complex Sacred Sword was a very tiring task. In their minds, they had to calculate a large number of Spirit grain to coordinate with it. After going on for an entire day, they all felt very tired.

Only now did they remember that Chen Xiang was just beside them, and he even seemed to have fed them a lot of fruit. It was just that they were too serious, and ignored Chen Xiang.

Dongfang Jing and Shen Lingling had already returned to their room, they were sleeping together. Dongfang Xinyue glanced at Chen Xiang with her charming eyes, and also returned to her own room.

When Xue Xianxian and Liu Meng’er saw Chen Xiang’s expression, they knew what Chen Xiang wanted to do.

"Let’s go together." Chen Xiang laughed sinisterly. Although Xue Xianxian and Liu Meng’er were already his people, they had yet to sleep together with him. When he thought about being together with this pair of beautiful master and disciple, Chen Xiang’s blood boiled.

"No." Although Liu Meng’er and Xue Xianxian had been sleeping together the entire time and the two of them were extremely close to each other, the guide still felt a little shy.

didn’t care about them at all. He opened his arms and forcefully carried them into the bathroom. Even though Xue Xianxian and Liu Meng’er were slightly unwilling, they had already known that such a thing would happen.

"Ahh ..." Chen Xiang hugged the two girls, and placed his hands on the soft spots on their bodies. He sighed in admiration, this pair of beautiful girls resisted for a long time inside the bath just now.

Liu Meng’er’s face was slightly flushed. She used to bathe together with Xue Xianxian and the other girls often, and had long gotten used to it. It’s just that this time, there was another Chen Xiang and his hands were very dishonest.

"I wonder how that lass Xiangyue is doing now. I heard that she and Qianqian are in Hundreds of Flowers Palace." Chen Xiang chuckled: "If little girl Xiangyue was here too, that would be interesting."

"Little Scoundrel." Liu Meng’er and Xue Xianxian snorted lightly, and at the same time, used their power to pinch the flesh on his body.

"The one in the bowl is still thinking about the one in the pot." Although she felt a little embarrassed at the moment, she was still very happy to be able to accompany Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang laughed sinisterly: "I haven’t eaten yet, Elder Sister Meng’er, are you in such a hurry for me to eat you?"

Xue Xianxian carried Chen Xiang, her jade-like hands lightly patted the surface of the water and made a few splashes. "Little Scoundrel, after you finish eating us, I guarantee that you won’t have the strength to eat other people."

Chen Xiang laughed out loud, then forcefully carried the two girls out of the bath and towards the large bed. At the same time, he released a warm wave of heat to dry off the water droplets on their bodies.

Not long after, the shy moans and curses of the two girls echoed in the charming room with occasional moans ...

Chen Xiang was very strong, and Xue Xianxian and Liu Meng’er didn’t really know what to think of him before either. But after training with Chen Xiang for a short period of time, they finally understood that Chen Xiang was much stronger than they imagined.

Chen Xiang caressed the two women’s cheeks. Looking at their beautiful faces, he couldn’t help but sigh tenderly. Then, he kissed on their foreheads, put on some clothes, and got off the bed.

Walking out of the room, Chen Xiang saw Dongfang Xinyue sitting in the hall wearing a black night attire. When she saw Chen Xiang, she made a "Shh" gesture.

"What are you doing out here in the middle of the night?" Dongfang Xinyue asked in a low voice.

"Isn’t it because you’re here? What are you doing here?" Chen Xiang chuckled: "Big sister Warm Moon, we seem to rarely have this kind of chance to be together alone."

When Dongfang Xinyue saw Chen Xiang’s glowing face and the smell of Xue Xianxian’s body, as well as an extremely ambiguous atmosphere, her face couldn’t help but turn red. Of course she knew what Chen Xiang and the beautiful master and disciple were doing.

"Scoundrel Master, why are you not enjoying the two beauties inside? What are you planning on doing with me?" Dongfang Xinyue spat out. In her hand was a stack of paper, which was filled with drawings of Spirit grain s.

"Warm Moon, do you spend more time with Xiang Yue? You are becoming more and more similar to her." Chen Xiang carried her and sat on her chair, then placed her on his lap. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

"I’m your female slave. I haven’t served you for many years, so I’m very ashamed. I want to make it up to you. You won’t blame me, right?" Dongfang Xinyue’s beautiful eyes were filled with seductiveness and she slightly squinted.

"Of course not, you just need to stay with Xianxian and the others, what’s more, you’re Jingjing’s aunt, and she’s my recognized sister." Chen Xiang laughed as he touched her beautiful oval face.

"Then I’m your aunt too." Dongfang Xinyue chuckled, her delicate hands caressing Chen Xiang’s handsome face, a sense of warmth and love suddenly welled up in her heart.

"Call me auntie." Dongfang Xinyue laughed.

"Aunty." Chen Xiang chuckled.

"Good girl, my little master." Dongfang Xinyue laughed, then jumped away from Chen Xiang’s embrace and placed the stack of papers on the table.

Dongfang Xinyue unfurled the papers, and his expression became serious: "I couldn’t fall asleep, so I recalled the contents of the five swords in the Seven Dragons Sword, and the Spirit grain above were very similar to those in the divine book. I suspect that the refining method of the Seven Dragons Sword was also from that divine book."

"Then why are you wearing these clothes?" Chen Xiang couldn’t help but take a few more glances at her black, tight clothes. Dongfang Xinyue’s figure was still quite attractive.

"Other than that, although there are only five Seven Dragons Sword, those Spirit grain were able to combine together. After careful analysis, I managed to obtain an incomplete map."

Dongfang Xinyue took out three pieces of paper and put them together. On them were many complex and complicated Spirit grain s, but inside each piece of paper, there was a thick piece of paper that could be linked together with the thicker portions of other papers.

"Then how can you be sure that this is a map? Do you know where this place is? There isn’t any indication of where it is. Why don’t you find Meng Er and the others to discuss it?" Chen Xiang said.

"Earlier, you were enjoying yourselves, so I didn’t want to disturb you. But now, let’s go and have a look. I know which direction to go. That place isn’t dangerous, it’s just within the boundaries of a force." Dongfang Xinyue laughed.
