Chen Xiang secretly pondered whether or not there were any Fusion spell in the nine groups of Tao-creation’s incantations inside his Tao-creation’s Divine Crystal. If there was, he would earn a lot, and at that time, he would not have to humbly apply.

"Even though our dragon and elephant fusion is very good, it’s not a perfect fusion." Yu’er pouted and said, "The Head Dragon and Elephant that you saw earlier only fused sixty percent of them. They haven’t been fully integrated."

"Master, you said that applying to learn more Fusion spell should be easier, why would they reject you?" Chen Xiang asked.

"There are a total of thirty-six elders in Dragon-Elephant School, so the relationship between these thirty-six elders is not very good. Elder sister’s parents and a portion of the elders did not get along, and there are also some who are selfish. If you want to learn other Fusion spell, you will need the consent of at least thirty elders before Leader can hand over the Fusion spell. " Xiang’er explained.

"Wouldn’t it be fine if we just give each of them one Crystal emperor?" Chen Xiang curled his lips: "This shouldn’t be difficult, right?"

"A piece of Crystal emperor, send it to someone who needs it for food!" Liu’er stuck out her tongue: "Those elders want Tao-creation Holy stone, and they want high-grade Tao-creation Holy stone, they need at least twenty pieces!"

Chen Xiang shook his head and sighed, "By doing this, these elders are hindering the development of the sect. In this way, no disciples will be able to learn even more Fusion spell, wouldn’t the sect disciples become weaker and weaker? How can you compete with other sects? "

"That’s not it, because every once in a while, there will be a competition or something like that. Through competition, the top ten in strength will be able to learn a Fusion spell." Xiao Xianglin said: "It’s just that I missed it quite a few times ... My parents didn’t even let me go, saying it was too dangerous. "

"In that case, wouldn’t you be a lot younger than your peers?" Chen Xiang thought back to the bewitching girls that Xiao Xianglin had mocked and ridiculed previously. Those were all Palace Main Disciples s, and were all able to participate in the competition.

"Yes, among our peers, there are already quite a few who have mastered the fourth stage of Fusion spell, but I am still at the third stage. When using the power of the dragon elephant in battle, I will be weaker than them, but I will absolutely not lose to them." When Xiao Xianglin mentioned this matter, he was brooding over it, but he also felt very helpless.

Because in every competition, she was always stopped by her parents, which led to her missing out. Her parents were more powerful and thought they could protect their daughter, so they stopped her from taking the risk.

Chen Xiang finally understood why there were eight dragon elephants protecting Xiao Xianglin when she went out.

"Then teach me the Fusion spell now." Chen Xiang said: "I have the foundation to learn the Tao-creation’s incantations, I should be able to grasp it quickly!"

"I don’t know you. In short, my sister and I studied for dozens of years before we mastered the first one." Xiang’er said: "It took me one or two hundred years to learn all three of them."

"Big Sister’s learning speed is the fastest. She’s done in three years." Yu’er said.

Chen Xiang felt that by relying on the Time Domain, he could probably learn one in a day.

"Actually, Fusion spell are very useful, they should be able to help you refine pills! In short, it would be of great help to me when refining and setting up the formation ... You should learn very quickly, because these two girls did not learn the basics of the Tao-creation Incantation, so they took a long time to master it. " Xiao Xianglin said.

Chen Xiang nodded.

After that, Xiao Xianglin turned into three Tao-creation’s incantations and said: "These are three Fusion spell. You should be able to tell, the simplest is a first stage Fusion spell."

Even the simplest Fusion spell had six strokes. The second stage Increase spell that Chen Xiang had learned before only had two strokes at most.

Chen Xiang looked through the Tao-creation’s Incantation inside the Six Realms mirrors and found the nine six strokes Tao-creation’s Incantation. The first three simple incantations were exactly the same as the three inscriptions that Xiao Xianglin drew.

In other words, he had a whole set of Fusion spell s inside, all level one to nine. This made him very happy!

"The fourth stage is the Flying mantra and the fifth stage is the Sound Wave Incantation. The Sound Wave Incantation is at the fifth stage and should be very strong. You must learn it well when you have time."

After Xiao Xianglin drew three Fusion spell, he took out three transparent water Spar slabs. Inside, there were three carved Fusion spell s, and said: "Take them back, and learn according to this! As for how you want to learn it, I don’t think I need to teach you. " Xiao Xianglin patted Chen Xiang’s head and laughed, "My good disciple, you will definitely not disappoint me."

"I should be able to learn it soon." Chen Xiang said.

"Once you have mastered the Fusion spell, I will teach you how to use it and allow you to fuse the two souls of the dragon and elephant."

Xiao Xianglin went close to Chen Xiang’s ear and whispered: "Good disciple, if you perform well, Master can give these two girls to you. In any case, we are now family."

When Xiang’er and Yu’er heard it, their faces flushed red and they whispered.

"No, if it’s you, Master, then I definitely won’t refuse." Chen Xiang evilly smiled, and then quickly kissed Xiao Xianglin’s beautiful cherry lips. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Xiao Xianglin had already moved her head next to Chen Xiang. She really did not expect Chen Xiang to be so bold as to actually kiss her little mouth.

When Xiang’er and Yu’er saw it, although they were surprised, they were gloating in their hearts, because their big sister’s first kiss had been snatched away by one of her disciples.

"I... I will beat you to death! " Xiao Xianglin waved his palm and shouted loudly, but he did not continue the attack.

"Master, beat me to death!" Chen Xiang looked indifferent.

Xiao Xianglin was so angry that his face was flushed red.

After that, Chen Xiang let out a scream that sounded like a pig being butchered, and angrily left with the two beautiful female slaves.

"Xiao Ke’er, when you have time, help me refine a soft armor that can protect your waist." Chen Xiang touched the area that was in pain, and said: "I wonder how many more times I’ll need to be pinched by her."

"You asked for it!" Feng Ke’er swung his sword in the You Yao Mountain Villa and played with Long Xueyi very happily.

"A heartless little girl." Chen Xiang said as his mouth twitched. He then released the Time Domain to learn the Fusion spell.

Chen Xiang looked at the six strokes Fusion spell and felt a bit of pain. The Space mantra that Feng Ke’er had directly learned three strokes back then must definitely be in the same mood as him.

The Tao-creation’s Incantation he had previously learnt only had two strokes, but he had also learned it very painstakingly, let alone the fact that he had to learn a few strokes of the Tao-creation’s Incantation.

"Would it be easier to learn the six strokes of the Tao-creation’s curse after going back to the previous one?" Chen Xiang thought to himself. Right now, he could only bite the bullet and go learn.
