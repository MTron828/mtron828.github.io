Returning to the old house, Chen Xiang calmed the anger in his heart and prepared to refine the Qiyuan Dan s. He had gotten a lot of purple pearls from the Hundreds of Flowers Village.

"Hongqing, does the Fang family have any big enemies?" Chen Xiang asked: "How is his enemy’s strength?"

"Let me think... There is one who is also a very strong power. Not only is he a great enemy of the Fang family, his relationship with the Fire Reverent School is also very bad. Chu Hongqing said: "You want to cooperate with this power."

"I do have this thought. Only by doing this can the Fang family and the Fire Reverent School vomit even more blood." Chen Xiang was still very weak right now, so it would be difficult for him to fight the Fire Reverent School and Fang Family alone.

"That might be difficult. Not everyone can work with them, and they don’t intend to work with anyone." Chu Hongqing said: "Because they are not human, they can be considered demons ... They all grew up from beasts, plants, stones and so on. "

"Are they considered to be one of the stronger forces in this region?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Of course. Many powers only have deals with them, but their relationship can’t be said to be very good. On the other hand, the Fire Reverent School and the Fang family are different. I’ve heard that they’ve once captured their Little Demons." Chu Hongqing said: "But you can try, since you have many tricks up your sleeve."

"We’ll talk about it after I refine more Qiyuan Dan. At least on this aspect, I can give the Fang family a huge blow." Chen Xiang said.

He used the Dawan refining method to refine a hundred Qiyuan Dan every day, and over the course of one month, he managed to refine three thousand of them.

Furthermore, he had heard that the Fang family only provided a thousand Qiyuan Dan every month, and he was three times more than the Fang family.

"I still can’t sell it. I’ll go find that demon clan first." Chen Xiang said: "Let’s see if we can cooperate with them first."

Under Chu Hongqing’s guidance, Chen Xiang left Divine Void City and arrived in a forest.

The trees in this forest were all extremely tall and lofty. Every single tree was as tall as the heavens, and the demons of the demonic clan were all living in caves on top of the trees.

"This place is called Demon Forest, there are many humans here too." Chu Hongqing said: "The powerful demonic beast that manages this place, is located in the biggest tree in the middle."

Chen Xiang walked for a good half a day before finally reaching the center. He saw a big tree, but it was not a tree that anyone could casually enter.

"I heard that the strongest in this Demon Forest is a group of Treants. Although they are powerful, they are very easy to talk to. First, ask the guards if they can meet the Treant Emperor." Chu Hongqing said.

Chen Xiang walked closer to the big tree, towards a big tree cave.

"Is something the matter?" One of the guards asked, his tone and attitude very good.

"I have a big deal to talk about with you guys. I am a Alchemist and have some pills to sell in ... This is the Qiyuan Dan. " Chen Xiang said in a low voice.

"Oh, that’s true." the guard asked.

"Of course it’s true. I’m not so bored as to tease you." Chen Xiang laughed.

Demons also needed to eat pills, and there were Alchemist amongst them. However, they weren’t as proficient in pills as humans, so they were still dependent on pills.

Qiyuan Dan could help raise Daoyuan immortal power s, and if you eat more, it could also help you increase your realm quickly. There were a lot of Dao Yuan realm s here.

If it was a high level Qiyuan Dan, cultivators of a higher realm would also be in great need, which was why the Fang family had such a status.

Chen Xiang was invited to enter. After entering the big tree, he felt very cool and was arranged to stay in a small hall.

Not long after, a benevolent looking old man came to meet him. It seemed that his strength was quite good, but he was not born with that sort of power, so he didn’t give people any pressure.

"Hello, Senior." Chen Xiang bowed politely.

"No need to be polite, you said that you have Qiyuan Dan to sell, that’s all." The old man chuckled and asked.

"A thousand." Chen Xiang said.

"Oh, are you a member of the Fang family?" The old man’s narrowed eyes opened slightly.

"No." Chen Xiang laughed: "I am an enemy of the Fang family."

"Looks like you are Chen Xiang. To be able to refine a Qiyuan Dan and also be the Fang family’s enemy, you should be the only one." The old man laughed.

Chen Xiang turned his face back, revealing his original appearance.

The old man chuckled, "So it’s like that. You came to find us because you want to fight against the Fang family, right?"

"That’s right, we’re not going to fight against the Fang family, but rather, we’re going to suppress the Fang family’s Qiyuan Dan." Chen Xiang said: "I can refine quite a few Qiyuan Dan and I don’t have any sales channels. You Monster race must have many channels in this area in the human world over the years, so I feel that it’s better to form an alliance with you."

"Of course, I’m here for your protection as well."

The old man nodded his head, "It’s already been pretty good for you to refine a thousand Qiyuan Dan from the day of the Heavenly Law Auction. However, I’m very curious, where did you get so many medicinal ingredients? Only the Fang family has such ingredients."

"I stole it from the Fang family." Chen Xiang laughed, because in order to discredit him, the Fang family had spread the news of him stealing the Fang family’s Qiyuan Dan s’ medicinal ingredients.

"In the future, you don’t need to take the risk of stealing the Fang family’s medicinal ingredients. We have them." The old man thought for a moment, then said: "Right now, all one thousand of your Qiyuan Dan are of low-grade Heaven-ranked. We will buy them with one thousand Jade money each."

"After that, you help us refine another Qiyuan Dan. We’ll give you the medicinal ingredients. If you refine one, we’ll give you four hundred Jade money as compensation. What do you think?" Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He didn’t need to buy the ingredients himself, so it was definitely a worthwhile and worthwhile task.

And for the Spirit Demon Race to be so generous, they must have obtained a lot of Qiyuan Dan’s medicinal ingredients.

"What if I can only refine one pellet of each medicinal ingredient? Will you give me the reward of four hundred Jade money as well?" Chen Xiang asked.

"That’s right, if you fail, we won’t pursue this matter any further. Regarding your matter, we also know that you can refine five pellets in one furnace, at least three, and we have a large amount of Qiyuan Dan’s medicinal ingredients." The old man said, "If we can refine it quickly, we can suppress the Fang family even faster."

They were treemen, so they definitely knew how to quickly grow the herbs, so they had planted a lot of Qiyuan Dan’s herbs, but no matter what, they could not refine them.

Now that Chen Xiang had come, he could just as well refine a large amount of medicinal ingredients that they had accumulated into pills. With the rewards that they had given Chen Xiang four hundred Jade money s and with him selling another eight hundred or even seven hundred, it would be worth it.

"Alright." Chen Xiang agreed, which was a good thing for him.
