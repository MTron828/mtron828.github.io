Chapter 57 - Skies Beyond Skies

Chen Xiang walked towards the old man who was presiding over the tournament, and asked “I am the winner of this tournament, now may I receive the rewards?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

There was a perfectly visible expression of helplessness on the old man’s face. He said “I’m just presiding over the tournament, the reward is not distributed by me. The True Elemental Dan is given out by the sects. You will get it once you pass through their assessment.”

A sliver of a smile flashed on Chen Xiang’s face. Although it seemed very charming, that old man felt unbased fear and could not help but shudder. It seemed that just a moment earlier, an overwhelming Slaughter Qi had secretly burrowed deep into his body and soul, making him feel like death was nigh.

Actually, just a moment ago, Chen Xiang was extremely angry and had inadvertently released frightening amount of Slaughter Qi. From the very start of this tournament, to it’s current end, he knew that it was manipulated by others. Even the final winner would find it very difficult to get that True Elemental Dan.

Chen Furong arrived, although he was one of the Chen Family Seniors, due to wanting to curry favor with the Yao Family members in the martial sect, he wanted to prevent the development of his own family, even resorted into attacking his own family patriarch!

Previously, when Chen Furong wounded Chen Tianhu, the entire Chen Family, whether their position was high or low, no longer accepted Chen Furong as one of their own.

Chen Furong was followed by a beautiful, delicate, and fair skinned man. He looked very elegant and bewitching, his whole body excluding a very pure True Qi. From this alone, one could tell that this martial artist’s True Qi was astonishingly vibrant and pure.

“Chen Xiang... I did not think you would successfully open the Dan King Hall... Moreover, you also harmed my new apprentice...”

Yao Chong’s master was actually Chen Furong!

“Shut up, you traitor of the family! You are not part of our Chen Family, what I want to do is my own business and none of yours! Why would my dan shop have to get your, an old dog’s, approval!? Who do you think you are!? You’re just an old dog who has a speciality in licking other people’s shoes.” Chen Xiang loudly shouted, his voice vibrating throughout the whole field. Every single one of the hidden Chen Family Members heard it, and their hearts relaxed.

“You...,YOU FUCKING BRAT! YOU SEEK DEATH!” Chen Furong had a very red face due to his anger, and wanted nothing more than to personally come out and fight Chen Xiang. But before he could do anything, he was stopped by the man behind him.

“Let me and this ‘Southern Martial Empire’s Strongest Teenager’ exchange blows. I would like to see with what ability he want to take away the True Elemental Dan.” That man coldly said. His complexion was filled with disdain, making one feel as if he thought he was the strongest in the entire world.

Chen Xiang replied back with a curt and cold tone. “You both are part of sects and belong to their world. You are to only participate in those matters, yet you violate your sect rules and regulations... especially this old fart.”

“If you win, this True Elemental Dan is yours. If you lose, you have to die.” The man coldly said.

“Why would I have to die if I lose?” Chen Xiang sneered.

“Because no one has ever lived after a martial art contest against me, Zhang Long.” Zhang Long said with a proud look.

Chen Xiang burst into laughter, as if he had just heard the world’s most funniest joke: “Aren’t you just at 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm? In the eyes of those inner sect disciples, you’re similar to dog feces. Do not think that after coming out of the sect’s world, you would be my king. Do not attempt to abuse your power here. After all, from the looks of it, you do not even have enough capability to do so!”

Zhang Long was furious as cold Qi started to rise and emanate throughout his whole body. His eyes were filled to the brim with murderous intentions, “You’re definitely going to die today.”

Chen Xiang did not know how Chen Furong found such an opinionated guy. It seemed that in his eyes, people who were not in a sect were just ants.

At this time, the crowd had all retreated. A battle with an expert in the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, would have a very large backlash, but at the same time they were also very excited about the upcoming match. This was because, if what they heard is true, then to get the rewards Chen Xiang had to defeat the Martial Art Sect’s disciple! Just viewing their battle could be considered very fortunate, after all this was a Martial Art Sect’s Disciple! No doubt, this match would give many benefits to the observing martial artists.

The ground was covered with splinters of wood, which was all due to Chen Xiang’s previous stomp that had destroyed the entire tournament stage. Chen Furong retreated back, he was very confident in Zhang Long. Chen Furong thought that Chen Xiang would definitely die this time, and then the Chen Family would be completely annexed by the Yao Family. This would lead to his relations with that Yao Family Member in the Martial Arts Sect to become much better.

“It looks like you’re older than me, do you think winning against me right now could be considered glorious? I’m only sixteen years old!” Chen Xiang said with a smile, but this expression seemed like he was smiling yet not, creating a considerable paradox.

If he hadn’t spoke, everyone here really would have forgotten about his age. Thinking about this, everyone sighed in their hearts. Only at sixteen years of age, he already had such accomplishments. This was definitely one very prestigious and powerful teenager.

“Fine, I’ll allow you to have one move. I will stand here unmoving, but after that I’ll act with no mercy.” Zhan Long had just arrived and Chen Furong had told him that Chen Xiang was only in the 7th level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Because Zhong Long was in the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm, he was very disdainful of the fact that the other party was an alchemist and most certainly not focused on the martial path, so of course he is quite weak.

In the regular world, anyone in the 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm was already considered to be one of the top martial artists. But the disciples from the Martial Art Sects could also absorb richer Spirit Qi, as well as eat spirit grade food and dan. Their True Qi exercises were also very good, with all of these factors combined, the people in the regular world could not hope to match the sect’s level of martial skill.

“You’ll let me have a single move?”

Chen Xiang’s voice was emotionless, but he was secretly delighted in his heart. An 8th level of the Mortal Martial Realm Expert was about to be struck by his fist with no retaliation. Not to mention Zhong Long, even if it was someone in 9th level of Mortal Martial Realm would definitely not feel fine afterwards.

Zhang Long sneered and said, “You must have to squeeze out all your power in this one attack, because it’ll be the last one of your life! Afterwards, you are dead.”

“I’m going to attack!” Chen Xiang retreated a few steps. Inside his heart he was secretly very pleased, he did not think that there would be such an arrogant idiot in this world.

Zhang Long smiled disdainfully, his whole body shook a bit as a pure white mist was emitted from his body, subsequently transforming into a strong Qi aura. It formed a Qi cover that enveloped his whole body. The whole crowd could feel the Qi aura shield and even see how sturdy it is. This was because when the Qi shield was formed, the broken pieces of wood bordering it had instantaneously turned into powder.

“You sure enough have some means, but it’s merely at this level. You have let me down!” Chen Xiang thought in his heart, while operating the [Tai Chi Divine Exercise] and mobilizing the five elements of True Qi in his body.

Last time, when he was in 5th level of Mortal Martial Realm, he defeated Chen Yihan using the very same five elements True Qi, fusing and transforming them into the Universal Force. This was a chaotic ancient force that has existed since the beginning of time. It was the power that formed heaven and earth, it’s true might was unfathomable. However, Chen Xiang’s Universal Force was only in embryonic stages.

Yet it was still extremely terrifying. The last time he casted it, his entire body went through unbearable pain, but now it was a completely different matter. He was now in the 8th level of Mortal Martial Realm, moreover his body had gone through refinement in the Immortal and Devil Pool, slowly transforming his body into an immortal and devil body. Now, his body was entirely capable of withstanding this ancient Universal Force.

This could be said to be his ace in the hole, his strongest card which he rarely used. When he saw that the opposing party in front of him was an idiot who wanted to die, he would certainly not refuse and definitely comply with the other party’s wishes! When his opponent died, he would let them know and feel with there body what was called people beyond people, skies beyond skies.

[TLN: Basically means ‘‘No matter how good you think you are, there is always someone out there that is better’. In the raws it was only half of the original idiom ‘Skies beyond skies’, but I added it all, the full idiom gives a better and more complete message.]

The Five Elements True Qis soon fused together within Chen Xiang, transforming itself into the Universal Force. It surged into his arms, yet did not reveal a trace of it’s existence. At this moment, Chen Xiang leapt and rushed towards Zhang Long!
