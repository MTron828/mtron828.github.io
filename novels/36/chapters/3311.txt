The last time Chen Xiang came, he was beaten into a pulp by Huang Longsheng, and if not for the elder stopping him, he would have been beaten to a pulp. At that time, everyone could tell that Chen Xiang was very weak, far weaker than Huang Longsheng, but now, Chen Xiang had actually punched Huang Longsheng until he laid on the ground. (iv),

No one knew what exactly happened or what happened to him. In short, to be able to make such a strong person like Huang Longsheng fall to the ground and not be able to stand up, he must be severely injured.

Chen Xiang quickly returned to his own courtyard. When he returned to his room, he was a little excited, because the power of the fist was extremely strong, even he himself felt that it was inconceivable.

After Chen Xiang walked for a long while, Huang Longsheng’s henchmen finally ran over and carried him away for treatment.

"Huang Longsheng should be done for, to be knocked unconscious with a single punch, what kind of terrifying power is this, that fellow called Chen Xiang is so terrifying, he just entered the outer sect of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect, and he already possesses such power ..."

"Don’t you find it strange? When we came here to retrieve pills last month, Chen Xiang’s strength wasn’t that strong! "

"This isn’t anything strange, although Chen Xiang was weak last time, he was able to last for a few moves. He should have broken through this month, Huang Longsheng is unlucky and met a guy who was preparing to break through."

"Chen Xiang is a new little overlord, I wonder how his temper is ... What should we do now? "

This group of people regularly provided Huang Longsheng with pills, and now that Huang Longsheng had lost to them and was even heavily injured, if they were to receive the pills next month, they would not be able to see Huang Longsheng, nor would they know who to give the pills to.

"Let’s just wait and see. In short, people like us who don’t have enough strength and strength can only regularly provide their confession to those little overlords."

The outer sect’s situation had suddenly changed, leaving the crowd at a loss as to how to react. No one had expected the overweeningly small overlord to be suddenly defeated.

At this moment, news of this incident was spreading like wildfire. The other little tyrants were also eyeing Chen Xiang covetously, and were quite wary of his strength. After all, Chen Xiang could defeat Huang Longsheng in an instant.

... ....

"Huang Longsheng this guy’s Divine Sense Sea is going to collapse because of me, he won’t be able to recover well for a period of time." Chen Xiang took out the Soul body madness Dan he had just received.

Last time, after eating it ten times, he discovered that the effects of the Soul body madness Dan were much better than the Myriad Tao Divine Soil Pellet, so he really wanted to refine a few more Soul body madness Dan and then give them to the Young girl Danling to eat, allowing them to evolve.

"This kind of pill is definitely very easy to refine. I just don’t know what kind of ingredients to use. If I can get the ingredients, I’ll be able to help them evolve very quickly." Chen Xiang ate ten pieces of Soul body madness Dan and then began to cultivate.

"The reason they are able to distribute so many Soul body madness Dan every month is very likely because they possess a large number of elixirs!" Feng Ke’er said: "This is a Ancient Fire Divine Sect, so there will be many powerful Alchemist."

"It’s very possible!" Chen Xiang nodded his head: "Maybe they have specially produced a batch of pill spirits to use in refining the Soul body madness Dan. They do not need to consume any medicinal herbs, nor do they need the Alchemist to refine them."

"Why does the Ancient Fire Divine Sect cultivate so many experts? They seem to be training the strong for free. " Feng Ke’er said.

"I don’t know, but what I am sure of is that in that case, the Ancient Fire Divine Sect will be very powerful and will be able to survive above the Myriad Tao. Even the Fierce Saber Race and the other experts will be cultivating inside." Chen Xiang said: "I don’t think that’s good. It’s not a good thing for Ancient Fire Divine Sect to have such a disciple."

Chen Xiang needed to continuously improve his own strength and enter the inner sect as soon as possible. Only then would he know more about the matters of the Ancient Fire Divine Sect.

"I wonder how the World Defying holy dragon is doing now." Chen Xiang really wanted to go find World Defying holy dragon, but he couldn’t enter the inner disciple’s territory right now.

After refining the ten Soul body madness Dan s, Chen Xiang walked out of the secret room, and saw a few people sitting in the hall of his residence. One of them was an old man, and the others were all middle-aged.

, you’re in trouble. Last time, when Du Gang saw Chen Xiang defeat Huang Longsheng, he knew that he was not mistaken. As expected, Chen Xiang shocked him. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Seeing that Chen Xiang had come out, the few middle aged men stood up and caught him.

"What are you guys doing?" Chen Xiang frowned and shouted.

"You injured fellow disciples and destroyed all of Divine Sense Sea. People like you must be punished." The old man said angrily. He seemed to be an old man who was in charge of this sort of thing.

"Hmph, Huang Longsheng almost crippled us, why don’t you guys care?" Chen Xiang was also very angry.

"We will deal with him when the time comes." The old man sneered, "You are so ruthless. When you become strong in the future, you will definitely kill people. We will seal you right now."

"Pfft!" Chen Xiang was even more furious, this elder was obviously targeting him, Huang Longsheng had injured so many people before, and for no reason at all, so many people had attacked him, and he did not receive any punishment, but now, he had only retaliated, and was about to be captured and sealed!

This elder was clearly partial towards Huang Longsheng. Now that Huang Longsheng was heavily injured by him, he harbored hatred in his heart, which was why he was acting this way towards him.

"Chen Xiang, you don’t need to be at ease, your strength is so powerful and your talent is also not bad, but you are only temporarily sealed right now. If this news were to spread to the inner sect elders and they find out that you are an inner sect disciple, they would definitely release you." Du Gang sent a sound transmission to Chen Xiang, telling him to calm down so that he wouldn’t have to do something in a while.

Chen Xiang was escorted by four middle-aged men, all four of them belonged to the Aoshi Holy Stage, and the old man was one of them as well. Chen Xiang’s strength was definitely inferior to them, and now it was impossible for him to escape, even if he resisted, he would definitely be captured in the end.

"Humph!" Chen Xiang just snorted and did not say anything else. Right now he was only sealed, and Feng Ke’er was able to break the seal, so he was not too worried.

"Just you wait." Chen Xiang clenched his teeth and said to the old man.

"Don’t even think about coming out. Don’t think that just because your aptitude is good there will be an inner court elder who would like you. Dream on, haha ..." The old man smiled sinisterly.

Chen Xiang didn’t know the relationship between this old man and Huang Longsheng, but in short, he was already his enemy. As long as he broke the seal on the old man, he would definitely exterminate him.

"May I know the elder’s name?" Chen Xiang suddenly calmed down and asked the old man for his name.
