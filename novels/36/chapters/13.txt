Chapter 14: Immortal and Devil Pool

Inside the field, Chen Tianhu arrived at the side of the injured Chen Haohai and Chen Yihan. Facing them he said “You and I were all competing for the Patriarch’s position. I did not hope to end it such a way! We are Chen Family members and we should all be united. If you refuse to accept me as your Patriarch, you can take your followers and leave the Chen Family.

Chen Haohai and Chen Yihan both glanced at each other before looking towards Chen Xiang and heaving heavy sighs. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Chen Haohai firmly grasped Chen Tianhu’s arm. With a heavy tone he said, “I hope you can lead the Chen Family. I, Chen Haohai, have lived as a Chen Family member and even after death I will become a Chen Family ghost! I, Chen Haohai, am sincerely convinced by the new Patriarch!”

Chen Haohai and Chen Yihan were not fools. They had gained insight on how frightening Chen Xiang’s potential is. If he is cultivated well, soon he will have very good chances to become a fierce alchemist. If you could build a good relation now, you can reap the benefits later. It is not wise to offend a top-level alchemist, plus, Chen Tianhu was now letting go of all the past enmities, which is good thing for them.

“Two seniors, for the previous offences please forgive me. For our Chen Family to survive in these lands for many years, we must not have internal strife.” Chen Xiang gave his apologies after arriving in front of Chen Haohai and Chen Yihan.

Chen Xiang’s statements and actions caused many Chen Family children and elders to secretly nod in approval. Although at such a young age he had already defeated a formidable Elder, he was not proud, but actually very modest. This kind of subtlety is quite rare among many of the Chen Family juniors.

The Chen brothers were also somewhat ashamed.

“My dear nephew, first go and recuperate! Dragging the injuries for a long time can be detrimental to future cultivation.” Chen Yihan said, while passing some of his healing dans.

For the the Elder Competition to reach such a conclusion, made the other Elders quite satisfied.

An Elder with a clear and resonant voice said “Ladies and Gentlemen, the banquet will take place after ten days, but I also request for everyone to stay after as well. By that time, many other families will have sent someone to participate. At that point, it would be a good opportunity for you to make friends with the other families.”

Chen Xian returned to his room. While looking at his scarred body, he could not help but let loose a deep breath. Just before, his fight with Chen Yihan was very dangerous. Yet at this moment, his mind was excited because at the 5th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm, he has the strength to defeat someone at the 7th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm!

After giving his all in the previous fight, he also felt like his power level had somewhat increased. He had gained a lot of experience in utilizing Qi. No wonder he had heard that in order to become a powerful martial artist, one needed to go through numerous battles.

Just as Chen Xiang was about to take the healing pills, two auras reflected onto his eyes. He blinked, only to see Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao with straight faces standing right in front of him.

“You brat! Just a moment ago, you were too rash, what would we do if you had died? We have poured too much effort into your body!” shouted Bai Youyou with a cold expression. Chen Xiang felt a cold chill running down his spine.

Su Meiyao stuck her tongue out and said “After considering the circumstance, devilish brat, you were somewhat courageous. This time, we will let you off the hook! However, next time you must be cautious! Take off your clothes, I will help you apply the ointments.

During Chen Xiang and Chen Yihan’s battle, his body was covered in many cuts due to the Icy True Aura. His body was covered in numerous bloodstains. If it was not specially treated, it would be harder to heal.

Thus, Chen Xiang was now lying on his bed enjoying the soft and tender hands of Su Meiyao applying some ointments, which made him feel very comfortable...

In accordance with custom, the other families were invited to celebrate the newly elected Chen Family Patriarch. However, it takes quite some time for the other families to arrive, so the actual celebration is held sometime later.

But at this banquet, everyone’s attention was on the expected alchemy competition between Chen Xiang and the Yao Family genius! Everyone was discussing this coming alchemy competition, so at this time, many people were coming to the banquet. Many came to see the Chen Family get humiliated. The Chen Family’s security was very tight so news of Chen Xiang’s recent achievements did not spread.

In the morning, a drop of azure essence was spat out by Chen Xiang. This dewdrop was congealed from his use of the “Dragon Saliva Exercise”. He wants to grasp more alchemy techniques in the upcoming ten days and wants to try refining a Mortal Level Middle Grade Pill.

At his age, to congeal a Mortal Level Middle Grade “Quenching Body Dan” was enough to be compared with legendary genius alchemists, and even transcend many of them!

“You want to refine mortal level middle-grade in this short time? It is somewhat difficult, but I Su Meiyao like to do these kind of challenging things.” Su Meiyao’s gentle voice transmitted through Chen Xiang’s mind.

Chen Xiang while laughing said: “Sister Meiyao, then quickly teach me!”

Su Meiyao with a soft smile said “Don’t grin that happily! This will come with a price. Although you are quite skilled in refining Mortal Level Low Grade Dans, and even have a bit of experience in refining Middle Grade Dans, your spiritual power is not enough! You need to be at the 7th Level of the Mortal Martial Realm. Then, with divine sense, you will become able to accurately manipulate the flames, and with enough control, instantly congeal the dans!”

Chen Xiang, while nodding his head, said “Well on the side, I will accelerate the growth of the Mortal Level Middle Grade Spirit Herb, while elevating my power level. I hope to catch up before the day of the alchemy competition!”

Su Meiyao said “In order to practice Divine Sense, you need a large amount of True Qi and Spiritual Power to successfully fuse together into Divine Sense. There is a certain level of difficulty, but since you practice the Tai Chi Divine Exercise, this process should be a lot fast. Still, doing it in ten days is doubtful!

Chen Xiang let loose a small sigh, he has been too impatient and this was a big taboo!

“Well... there is still a way to quickly elevate your strength.” Su Meiyao said with a mysterious smile said.

“How?” Chen Xiang asked quickly.

Suddenly Bai Youyou transmits with her ice cold voice “Immortal and Devil Pool.”

At this moment, Chen Xiang remembered that below the ‘Immortal and devil cliff’ there was a strange pool. When he had fallen down there, he was able to breathe inside it. Moreover, the pool was also shining. But besides that, he did not discover anything special about it.

“Is that the weird pool at the bottom of the cliff?” Chen Xiang asked with uncertainty.

“Yes, you should know we were forced by our personal enemy into that pool” Su Meiyao words made Chen Xiang somewhat curious. It turned out, these two peerless martial arts girls were dropped there.

“In the end, how is that place mystical?” The more Chen Xiang thought about it the more suspicious he got. This was because that ‘Immortal and devil cliff’ was perennially filled with Death Qi, yet for some reason there was no trace of Death Qi near that pool.

After Chen Xiang learned that the ‘Immortal and devil pool’ is out of the ordinary, he immediately mixed ‘Dragon saliva’ into the water, then poured in various spirit herbs and flowers. Following that, he greeted his father, and quietly left the Chen family villa, taking a trip to the Immortal and Devil cliff.

On the way, he listened to Su Meiyao describing things about the ‘Immortal and devil cliff’.

“That place is called the Immortal and Devil Cliff because that place was where immortals and devils are buried. That pool was transformed from the pure energy that was emitted from their corpses. Someone intentionally created that pool, and the Death Qi near its surroundings are also caused due to the overflow from the Immortals and Devils corpses.” Su Meiyao said.

Chen Xiang was horrified. Immortals and Devil are legendary beings and he completely did not expect their corpses to lie there! This also made him incomparably excited, if that pool truly is made up of pure energy and he managed to obtain it...
