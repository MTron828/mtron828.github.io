All the Rankers in Earth Spirit World were killed by Chen Xiang, so Chen Xiang was not too worried that Shen Tianhu and the rest were in danger. If everything went well, the people in the Earth Spirit World would be able to see the sun that they haven’t seen for a long time.

"Good, I just talked to your father and told him to prepare to move to the surface." The Island Spirit said.

"Senior, do you think that the poisonous rain will return again?" When Chen Xiang asked about this, he was extremely worried, and if he came back again, he would have to return to the Earth Spirit World. If no one reminded him that the poison rain had suddenly come, then many people would definitely die.

"I won’t come again. If I can survive this trial, the Heavenly Dao will no longer punish me. Even if I do, I will grow a lot by then. I won’t be like before, sitting and waiting for death." Island Spirit said, "Believe me, when the time comes, I will definitely be able to protect the life on this island."

Island Spirit knew that Chen Xiang was extremely worried about his father, and now that the Island Spirit saw Chen Xiang as his benefactor, he naturally had to take care of Chen Xiang’s father.

After experiencing the poison rain, Island Spirit also realized that he was too weak. He would definitely work hard to raise his own strength in the future to prevent the poison rain from coming again.

Chen Xiang nodded, then sat on the ground and leaned against a rock. He was currently very tired, and after several months of not resting, he had continuously released flames to burn the death poison on the island. Now, he could finally have a beautiful sleep.

Chen Xiang had slept for three days and three nights, but the moment he woke up, he smelt a faint fragrance from the flowers. He suddenly woke up and looked around him.

"How long have I been asleep?" Chen Xiang asked quickly.

"It’s only been three days." Xia Bailing laughed, she had actually already left the You Yao Mountain Villa.

"It’s only been three days." Chen Xiang immediately flew up to the sky and surveyed his surroundings from above. In the distance, there was a large river flowing in a zigzag fashion on this island.

Three days ago, the place had been scorched black. But now, there were mountains and rivers, blue skies and white clouds, and a hundred beautiful flowers competing against each other.

Chen Xiang was shocked that he could recover to his current state so quickly. He had originally planned to rest on his own before using the Creation God’s Spring to help recover, but Island Spirit did it so quickly.

"Quite a surprise." The Island Spirit’s voice appeared in Chen Xiang’s mind. His voice was no longer as aged as it was before, and it was filled with joy.

"Mm, this is too fast." Chen Xiang took a deep breath, the fresh air had an intoxicating fragrance to it.

"This might be the reason why I’m being punished. This is simply a violation of the laws of nature." The Island Spirit sighed.

It would truly be heaven defying to be able to make this island grow large amounts of flowers, plants and trees so quickly. If those medicinal herbs could also grow like this, Chen Xiang would feel afraid just thinking about it.

"Your father and the others will arrive soon." The Island Spirit chuckled, "Next up, I will help him increase his strength, so that he can become a Dao Sovereign faster, or even stronger."

Chen Xiang felt that this Island Spirit was as strong as the Dao Sovereign, and Xia Bailing had mentioned before that this Island Spirit was very strong.

"Alright, then I’ll leave it to you. I have a lot of things to do outside, so I can’t stay here for too long." Chen Xiang said: "Moreover, it’s not easy to come here once."

"Indeed, once I’m strong enough, I won’t be able to stabilize myself like I’m now jumping around." Island Spirit also knew about the chaos occurring on the island. Other than that, there was an extremely powerful barrier sealing them.

"Alright, my father has already taken over the Earth Spirit World from the new position, right?" Chen Xiang asked.

"Yes, they have all stabilized now, and I have also recovered my strength. If there were other outsiders like before, I could have stopped them from doing anything rash." The Island Spirit said.

"Then you can help me say goodbye to my father. I’m leaving." Chen Xiang said. He also didn’t really want to say his goodbyes to Shen Tianhu in front of him.

The Island Spirit seemed to understand this human nature, and sighed: "I got it, you have to be careful outside, you have so many miracles on you, it’s hard to avoid people noticing you. If you encounter any danger, come in here, I will protect you no matter what."

"Alright, farewell." After Chen Xiang finished speaking, he used the White Tiger to jump and left the island. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After entering the Wasteland, he looked around and saw that the island had disappeared. Although the trace of the island was a bit strange, it was still a good place to go.

"Sister Bai Ling, what are your plans? Do you want to continue playing in the Hundreds of Flowers Village or go back there?" Chen Xiang said: "I’m going to the Three Money Divine City now."

"I’ll go back to the White Spirit City first to take a look. It’ll be an easy task wherever I go anyway." Xia Bailing came out from You Yao Mountain Villa.

When he first went to the island and saw the death poison, it made Xia Bailing feel like he was back in the days when he was poisoned to death by the death poison. But when he recovered that island, it also eliminated the shadow that had been etched in her heart for many years.

"Alright, I will go to Hundreds of Flowers Village to play from time to time. That is my second home." Xia Bailing giggled at Chen Xiang and pinched Chen Xiang’s face: "I’m going, even if you’re free, you should come to White Spirit City to play with me."

"Definitely." Chen Xiang laughed.

Xia Bailing hummed to the small tune that Yang Xiangyin played frequently, jumping and jumping, and slowly disappeared from Chen Xiang’s line of sight.

"If I had known, I would have let her take me back first." Chen Xiang curled his lips and then could only head towards the Three Money Divine City himself.

As long as they could find a city with three great native bank s, they could be teleported to the Three Money Divine City through those native bank s. This was very convenient.

If he were to build three great native bank s in the future, it would be much easier for him to return to the Heavenly Dragon City from the Three Money Divine City.

After finding his own father, Chen Xiang could finally put down the burden in his heart.

... ....

Inside the Three Money Divine City, Chen Xiang had returned to his villa. Before he left, he had told Huang Jintian to help him spread the news of the Shengdao Dan.

"Master, you didn’t eat the Shengdao Dan, right?" Chen Xiang immediately asked when he saw Huang Jintian.

"Of course not, do I look like that kind of person." Huang Jintian chuckled: "Your Shengdao Dan is very famous in this city now."

"Oh, how did you do it?" Chen Xiang asked anxiously.

"On one hand, it’s Jiang Xian this brat helping to spread the news. On the other hand, it’s the Jiang Clan helping, and then there’s ... And Xie Qiaoyan, no matter what you need me to do for you, I have pretty much done it now. " Huang Jintian said.
