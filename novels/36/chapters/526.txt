Chapter 527 A Naive White-Haired Beauty

Even though the cave was simple and crude, it was full of love and romance. The sounds of chastity and gasps echoed throughout the cave, while a woman’s groan the a man’s gasps could be heard ...

Chen Xiang and Xue Xianxian were wrapped around each other as if they were the only two people in this world. They were completely immersed in the joy of love and ecstasy, as if they were a unity. Deeply diving in the pleasure, they forgot everything else in the world.

Leng Youlan sat by the entrance and used a stone to draw a picture on the ground with her small mouth slightly pursed. She couldn’t understand why Xue Xianxian and Chen Xiang would be so happy, but for her, it was very boring and embarrassing.

If she was an ordinary woman, she would be so shy that she would want to find a hole to burrow into, but Leng Youlan didn’t think so. In her eyes, this was just something she had never seen before, and she observed it now, thus the novelty lapsed very soon.

It was precisely because of this that Xue Xianxian was not worried about Leng Youlan at all. She knew her very well, so it would not be a big deal even if Leng Youlan were to take a look.

However, the two girls in Chen Xiang’s ring, as well as Long Xueyi the little dragon girl, were different. They were quietly humming, especially Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou whose faces were so red like they were bleeding. Although they had lived for a long time, they had not gotten any sexual experience before, nor did they know what it felt like, but they knew how comfortable it was.

“Sister ...This little scoundrel will come frequently in the future. There will be a second time one he does it once. It is truly a torture for us!” Su Meiyao coquettishly snorted.

Bai Youyou suddenly gave an ambiguous smile. “Sister, do you want to try it out with him? He’s good, at least not disgusting! "

Su Meiyao’s eyes were wide open, “sister, you’ve changed too much!”

Bai Youyou gathered her beautiful hair and gave a gentle smile on her ice-cold face. “Can you promise not to be taken advantage of by this little scoundrel in the future?”

“Who knows what will happen in the future? Anyway, I know this little rascal must want to take advantage of us. He is always that bad.” Su Meiyao snorted. When she thought about the time when Chen Xiang watched her and Bai Youyou’s bare body, her face would heat up.

“To be honest, I still feel so good kissing last time.” A sweet smile appeared on Bai Youyou’s face. After being together with Bai Youyou for so long, this was the first time Su Meiyao saw such a cold and noble beauty with such a seductive expression.

Chen Xiang didn’t know how long he spent with Xue Xianxian. He only felt an incomparably comfort and pleasure assaulting his heart, making him feel extremely comfortable.

At this moment, both of them were very tired. They tightly hugged each other and fell asleep. Both of them had experienced a sharp pain, but after that, they enjoyed the wonderful and intoxicating joy of the peak, which caused the lovers to throw away all their worries and sleep nicely.

Seeing that Chen Xiang was fine, Leng Youlan let out a sigh of relief. She secretly said in her heart, “could it be that sister Xianxian not allowing me to sleep with brother naked because she was afraid of us doing something like this?" Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Men are really strange. They would be very different as they see beautiful women. Last time when big brother saw me naked, he appeared to be eager to throw me down. Big brother is indeed a rascal. No wonder the master called him that every day... Master is a great beauty. Could it be that brother has done something do her?”

The bored Leng Youlan couldn’t help but to let her imagination run wild ...

A night passed. Chen Xiang had unconsciously fused with the Thunder Soul, which surprised Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou a lot. They never imagined that under such circumstances, Chen Xiang would be drugged and easily fuse with the Thunder Soul.

When Chen Xiang and Xue Xianxian woke up, they saw Leng Youlan sitting at the side with her eyes wide open and curiously looking at them in an embrace.

Originally, Chen Xiang wanted to linger with Xue Xianxian for some while, but he was merging with his Thunder Soul, while Leng Youlan was here, which made him extremely embarrassed.

When Xue Xianxian saw Leng Youlan looking at them with a curious gaze, she felt bashful but at the same time found it funny.

“Huh? Which one of you is injured?!” Leng Youlan shouted as she looked at the bloodstained white blanket.

This caused Xue Xianxian to be embarrassed. In the meanwhile, Chen Xiang released some water to rinse off the liquid left behind after the love between the two of them.

Chen Xiang couldn’t help blushing while Leng Youlan stared at his balls.

"Brother, what is it? Why don’t I have it? " Leng Youlan asked curiously.

Her query caused Xue Xianxian to laugh involuntarily. She knew that Leng Youlan didn’t know anything, so she didn’t have any scruples.

After joining with Chen Xiang, Xue Xianxian finally felt that she was Chen Xiang’s wife. Moreover, she wasn’t as conservative as before. She pinched Chen Xiang’s waist and said with a sweet smile, “your sister asked what those two things are? Answer her!”

Chen Xiang hurriedly wrapped a piece of cloth around himself. He was worried that Leng Youlan would reach out to grab it. As he cleaned Xue Xianxian’s jade-like body, the evil flame in his body rose once again, then a small tent appeared in his upper part, caused Xue Xianxian to snort.

"That’s my secrete weapon ...” Chen Xiang gave a vague answer. He could not understand that Leng Youlan knew nothing of men and women after staying such a long time with Xue Xianxian. Beside, her breasts were slightly bigger than that of Xue Xianxian.

Leng Youlan’s eyes immediately lit up. “Brother, you have two of them. Can you give me one to play with?”

“Haha ...” Xue Xianxian laughed out loud. Her “snow rabbits” were shaking, while Bai Youyou and Su Meiyao in the ring also giggled.

Chen Xiang was completely speechless. He rubbed Xue Xianxian’s sparkling chest before hastily putting on his clothes, after which he solemnly said, "Youlan, you can’t take them. They are the root of my life! I was born with them. I didn’t know how you grew up. How could you be so naive? Normally, you look so domineering, but now ....”

“Why don’t I have them?” Leng Youlan said gloomily as she scratched her white-haired head.

“Don’t you know what the dick or balls are when you scold people?” Chen Xiang suddenly felt the need to teach his innocent little sister a lesson so that she wouldn’t be tricked by others in the future.

Xue Xianxian chuckled, “Youlan, those two things are bad. Men do bad things on women because they have them.”

“How should I know? I don’t have them, neither do sister Xianxian, nor did master teach me! The next time I see master, I will ask her about this.” Leng Youlan stuck out her tongue. “I’m not stupid, but no one has taught me.”

Chen Xiang rubbed his chin and laughed, “that’s right. The next time you meet big sister Menger, you must let her teach you about this until you understand everything.”

His words made Xue Xianxian want to ruthlessly step on him.

After Xue Xianxian dressed up, she let Leng Youlan comb her hair, while she asked, “dear Xiang, how did you manage to escape from the dungeon? What happened to the Demon Subduing Academy?”
