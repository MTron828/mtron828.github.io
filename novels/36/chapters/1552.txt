Chen Xiang waited for half a day before Ji Ling’er and Red Cloud came out. When they saw Chen Xiang sitting in the hall and leisurely drinking tea, they knew that he had already refined all of the Jasper gourd into Biyuan Dan.

On the small table beside Chen Xiang, two Storage bag were placed.

"I won’t be going this time. You guys should be able to settle it, right?" Chen Xiang looked at the two Storage bag s on the table.

Because Chen Xiang was about to leave, they did not expect him to refine so many Jasper gourd. The time it took for this to happen was so fast, they had thought it would take even longer than the last time.

The two ladies did not say anything, picked up the two Storage bag s and quickly left.

Chen Xiang waited for more than two hours before they returned. They handed over a Storage bag to Chen Xiang, inside it were thirty million kilograms of Holy stone.

"Are you leaving today?" Ji Ling’er’s face was filled with reluctance.

"En, the faster the better. What Transmission array do you have here that can teleport me to the outermost realm?" Chen Xiang nodded and pulled Ji Ling’er into his embrace, "We will meet again in the future."

The red clouds also came over and hugged Chen Xiang. "Take care."

"The same goes for all of you." Chen Xiang laughed.

Hong Xia told him that there was a Transmission array inside the Divine Feather School that could be teleported to the border regions of Tiandu. After Chen Xiang bid the two girls farewell, he rushed to the Divine Feather School.

He had originally planned to greet Su Meiyao and the others, but he did not go. He felt that it wouldn’t be long before he would return.

The relationship between Chen Xiang and Divine Feather School was not bad. Feng Yujie, the Leader, had also told him to treat them well, so he came to the Transmission array very easily.

"This is a one-way transfer, so you should think about it properly. At that time, with your current strength, coming here will not be easy." Luo Qi laughed. He already knew that Chen Xiang was someone from the Nine Heaven World.

"Let’s begin. If I want to come back in the future, there’s nothing that can stop me." Chen Xiang cupped his fists towards Luo Qi.

"Take care." When Luo Qi activated the Transmission array, a flash passed Chen Xiang’s eyes and he felt his body quickly falling. He actually appeared high in the sky, but he could already see the faint golden screen of light.

Back then, Chen Xiang had passed through a layer of and arrived here, then he had encountered those Holy armoured lion.

After arriving on the surface of the ground, Chen Xiang immediately rushed towards the light screen, and followed the light screen to search for the Transmission array. After finding it, he teleported to the other side, where the light curtain covered the light golden light. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

"He’s coming." Chen Xiang followed his memories and ran towards the teleportation station that only he could use.

There wasn’t much change in this place, the teleportation station was still standing, enveloped by a powerful barrier. He took out the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword, only then was he able to step into the barrier that protected the teleportation station.

Just as he was about to go back, he suddenly saw a stone tablet next to the barrier. There were a few words on it, he took a look and silently cursed, because this was the message that Huang Jintian had given him.

"This old lunatic, looks like he couldn’t make it back in time. He’s trapped here. He can only go back when I show up." Chen Xiang threw the stone tablet to the ground and sat on the teleportation platform, waiting helplessly for Huang Jintian. He guessed that Huang Jintian would come here every so often to take a look.

Long Xueyi laughed: "In the two hundred years that he’s trapped here, he might be able to fish up a lot of good stuff. This old lunatic is just like you, cunning and scheming."

"My patience is limited. If I can’t wait, I’ll let him stay here temporarily. After all, there are less Nine Heaven World here, so he won’t mind." Chen Xiang said in annoyance.

Just as he was about to go back, he saw Huang Jintian’s message, making him have no choice but to wait here. It was as though he was about to piss off when he was suddenly stopped.

Chen Xiang was bored, he could only take out the pill furnace to concoct the pills, and at the same time, condense more creation divine liquid s. He had some Immortal Grade Four medicinal ingredients, but not many of them, and he did not know when he would return, so he had to look for Lv Qilian to retrieve her spirit liquid and duplicate some Level Four Immortal Medicinal Herbs.

He waited for a month, and finally, Huang Jintian.

Huang Jintian was very spirited, when he saw Chen Xiang sitting on the high teleportation altar, he started to laugh maniacally even from far away.

"It’s been more than two hundred years. I thought a little kid like you had died." Huang Jintian stood outside the barrier and laughed out loud: "Not only are you not dead, you’ve even become very powerful, and entered the Immortal-becoming realm."

Chen Xiang looked at him in annoyance, "Master, aren’t you dead yet? How have you been all these years?"

Huang Jintian laughed: "I am together with Mao’er. With the help of this little cat, I can barely survive."

Chen Xiang snorted, "You must have ordered him to help you kill Holy Beasts all day long, right?

"Let’s not talk about this anymore. Hurry up and bring me in." Huang Jintian shouted, "I originally came here every few months, and every few years, it just so happened that you ran into me at the time I came back. Otherwise, you would have waited for a few more years."

Chen Xiang walked down the teleportation platform, curled his lips, and said, "Don’t worry, I’ll only wait two months at most and then leave. Who has the patience to wait here for so many years?"

"Damn brat, I’m your master." Huang Jintian really wanted to ruthlessly hit Chen Xiang on the head, but he was helpless as there was a powerful barrier separating them.

Chen Xiang walked out of the barrier and took out his divine tripod. He said, "This is the only way to get you out of here.

Huang Jintian knew that Chen Xiang, this divine cauldron, was specially used to store corpses and so on. His expression became a little unnatural.

"That’s decent enough. It’ll only take an hour at most." Chen Xiang said: "Hurry up, if I wasn’t in a rush to return to the Nine Heaven World, I would have continued to stay in Tiandu."

"What? You’re actually in Tiandu City? You brat, you’ve been living there for over two hundred years. I’m being chased and beaten up by Saint Beasts all day. There are many times where I almost died. This is too unfair." Huang Jintian scolded as he jumped into the divine furnace.

Chen Xiang shrunk the Spirit Cauldron and walked into the enchantment. He climbed onto the teleportation platform and pierced the Green dragon demon-slain broadsword through the hole, opening Transmission array and returned to the stone room at the bottom of the Meteor Mountain Range.

After coming to the surface, Chen Xiang looked around, and did not feel any changes. The only difference was that the flowers and plants here had increased, so he released Huang Jintian.

"Master, is there any big change in the Nine Heaven World? Why do I have a bad feeling about it?" Chen Xiang looked around him and felt an indescribable pressure in his heart.

Huang Jintian pinched his fingers, as if he was calculating something, and his face became extremely serious.

"I didn’t expect it to be so fast. Di Tian has already returned to his position. Dammit, we teacher and disciple have missed that day." Huang Jintian scolded: "I wonder what kind of bird it is now."
