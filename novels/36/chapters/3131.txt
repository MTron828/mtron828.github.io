Chen Cai brought Chen Xiang and quickly walked through the city, quickly arriving outside a large mansion.

"Residence of He?" When Chen Xiang saw this word, he asked softly. "Don’t tell me he’s from He Clan?"

"It’s from He Clan!" Chen Cai laughed.

After Chen Xiang cultivated for a long time, he was already able to conceal the aura of his own World Defying Green dragon and was no longer able to track it. In the past, it was very easy for the World Defying Stage Clan to trace the aura of a World Defying Green dragon on his body.

"Is the He Clan in charge of this city?" Chen Xiang followed Chen Cai over.

"Yes!" After Chen Cai entered, he saw many people standing in the same courtyard, waiting for the assessment.

"Do you need Dao crystal or something?" Chen Xiang asked, he had seen many things in the past where big powers needed to recruit people, and most of them needed to collect a certain number of Dao crystal.

"No need, as long as you can pass. Moreover, there will be very good treatment. I had intended to sneak in and take a look." Chen Cai brought Chen Xiang to line up, and said in a low voice: "When the time comes, we just need to perform a little more normally, so as to not attract too much attention."

Chen Xiang had already changed his appearance on the way here, and he also looked relatively ordinary. As long as they did not reveal their true strength, there would not be any problems.

When they were lining up, Chen Xiang saw that quite a few people had passed the exam.

"Old Zhao, have you passed the assessment?" An old man shouted to another old man.

"Of course I passed, but I don’t really want to go because it’s too dangerous and I’m afraid I won’t be able to come back." Old Zhao sighed, "If you’re afraid of death, then don’t queue up now."

"What is the danger?" the old man asked.

"I don’t know. In short, it looked extremely complicated. I only found out about it during the exam." After saying this, the old man hurriedly left the Residence of He.

That was why even if they knew, they would continue to queue up, because once they came back, they would receive a lot of rewards. Legend has it that there was still a pill that could help them enter the World Defying Stage, that was the most attractive thing.

Chen Cai entered a house, and just after a while, he came out with a wooden board in his hands. He came to Chen Xiang’s side and smiled: "It’s easy to pass, don’t be nervous, I’ll be waiting for you in the backyard."

After Chen Cai finished speaking, he passed through a fake mountain and left.

After that, it was Chen Xiang’s turn. After entering the house, he saw a very big stone, this stone was black, with many sharp thorns on the surface, it was like a short sword.

"What’s your name?" The elder in charge of the assessment asked.

"Shen Fei." Chen Xiang said a fake name.

"Okay, now pull a needle from this rock," the old man said.

Chen Xiang nodded, then walked over and pinched the spike on the rock, and then pulled it out with force.

"Your strength isn’t bad. You have passed. I will carve a wooden tablet for you." The old man took the spikes Chen Xiang had pulled out, and said: "If you go to Natural Law World, you will encounter this kind of thing there. At that time, all you need to do is to pull the spikes off from the top and hand them over to us, if you can get a lot of these spikes, you can obtain our highest rewards."

"What’s the highest reward?" Chen Xiang looked at the thorn in his hand, he did not know what it was.

"To obtain a divine pill that can allow you to enter the World Defying Stage, it’s just that you need to be very outstanding." The old man had already finished making the wooden tablet, and handed it over to Chen Xiang, then kept the sharp thorn.

"Take them and go to the backyard of the He manor. We will arrange for you to stay in the Residence of He. When the time comes, we will bring you guys to the Natural Law World." The old man said, "Don’t ask about anything else, you don’t need to know! You only need to know that this trip is extremely dangerous and that there is a high possibility that you will not be able to return. "

Chen Xiang nodded, took the wooden tablet and left the small hut, and then quickly headed towards the backyard.

"Xiao Ke’er, did you see those thorns just now? Do you know what that is? " Chen Xiang asked.

"I don’t know. However, I am certain that the rock where the spike is located on is not a rock. It is a type of animal skin. It shouldn’t be a spike either, but rather a type of beast hair." Feng Ke’er said. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

"Really?" Chen Xiang was completely shocked by Feng Ke’er’s words. If beast fur alone was so scary, then what if it was a whole day beast?

When he arrived at the backyard, Chen Cai was already there waiting for him. Chen Cai hurriedly brought him into a room.

"There are two beds in this room. We’ll stay here for the time being." After Chen Cai finished speaking, his expression became serious and continued to speak: "Just now, during your assessment, did you want to pull out a single thing?"

Chen Xiang nodded: "Yes." He also wanted to discuss this matter with Chen Cai.

"It’s a type of beast hair!" Chen Cai said in a low voice: "Moreover, it’s an extremely terrifying beast. Heaven Old Divine Race and World Defying Stage Clan are actually going to hunt and kill this beast, and it’s even inside Natural Law World!"

"What kind of beast is it? Why would it appear in the Natural Law World? " Chen Xiang asked anxiously, it was just as Feng Ke’er said, it was indeed a type of fur, and it was extremely useful.

"The name of this beast is Tiangu beast, it is a very foolish type of beast, but it is unusually strong, and its body is extremely strong. Even if it’s someone at the peak of World Defying Stage, it would be difficult to kill them all at once." Chen Cai said: "Only the Myriad Tao have such things, and there shouldn’t be many of them."

"But from the looks of it, a lot of Natural Law World will appear!" Chen Xiang said: "Otherwise, Heaven Old Divine Race and World Defying Stage Clan would not have recruited this many people."

"Tiangu beast are stupid and strong, especially their fur. When they are dense, they look like countless swords, which is why they are also called sword beasts." Chen Cai said: "Legend has it that this fellow’s fur that has a surface like a sword even contains Myriad Tao Divine Soil, now do you understand why they want to collect these fur?"

The Myriad Tao Divine Soil was very useful, Chen Xiang had already sensed it, he had his own ways of gathering the Myriad Tao Divine Soil s, it was just that it would take him a little time and a lot of effort.

But, the World Defying Stage Clan and the World Defying Stage Clan were different. They did not have a method like Chen Xiang’s, but they also needed the Myriad Tao Divine Soil very badly, so they could only use this method.

"Seems like this is an opportunity for us to obtain a large number of Myriad Tao Divine Soil s." Chen Cai laughed: "When the time comes, we must go take a look."
