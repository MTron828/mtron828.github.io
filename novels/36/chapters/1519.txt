Ji Ling’er looked at Chen Xiang’s back figure, snorted lightly, and chased after him.

"She’s catching up." Long Xueyi shouted in shock: "This woman should really want to learn the Seventy-two changes."

"Of course I know, but I don’t want to teach her." Chen Xiang did not run far before he was stopped by Ji Ling’er.

Chen Xiang sighed: "Don’t tell me you want to kill me."

Ji Ling’er looked at him in annoyance and stuck out her tongue, "I want to kill you. Are you still able to stand here and speak?

She could already tell that Chen Xiang had poisoned the fifteen people.

"Follow me for a while, at least get familiar with this place. With me here, no one will dare to bully you." Ji Ling’er smiled sweetly. "That way, we can get familiar with each other, and then you can see if I have the conditions to learn your transformation techniques."

Although Ji Ling’er had disguised herself before, her current smile was still very sweet and gentle. Chen Xiang understood Ji Ling’er’s strength, although she was under the control of the elders in the Ji Clan, but compared to him, her strength was still very strong.

"The best way to get used to it is to take off all our clothes and sleep in the same bed." muttered in a low voice. He had already planned to stay with Ji Ling’er in Tiandu City for a period of time.

Ji Ling’er giggled: "I would like to use my body to exchange for your transformation technique, but I’m afraid that you won’t be able to take it, with your body, in a few moments you’ll be sucked dry by me."

"Are all the women in Tiandu so open-minded?" Chen Xiang was startled and asked.

"Of course not. It’s just that I feel that you’re quite good and have grasped so many powerful things. If your strength is on par with mine, then I’ll be determined to deal with you for the rest of my life." Ji Ling’er laughed, "Do you wish you could become stronger now?"

Previously, Su Meiyao and Bai Youyou had told Chen Xiang that when strong women and men combined, if the man wasn’t strong enough and couldn’t suppress the woman, he would be devoured by the woman.

Conversely, when a man was stronger than a woman, their combination would benefit the woman, because the man would channel his power into the woman’s body ...

Thinking up to here, Chen Xiang could only sigh helplessly in his heart.

No way, when I was in Nine Heaven World, the women around me were no worse than you, no matter what kind of woman I wanted, I didn’t care about you.

Chen Xiang’s face was full of indifference. What he said was the truth, he had two unparalleled beauties in his Serene Jade Ring along with Long Xueyi, this beautiful dragon.

"How about this, I’ll help you increase your strength. When you feel that’s about right, teach me that transformation technique, okay?" Ji Ling’er shook Chen Xiang’s arm and asked.

"Just how far can you help me? How long will that take? I can’t possibly wait for hundreds of thousands of years, right?" Chen Xiang said.

"A thousand years at the fastest. Even if you can’t reach my level, you can still possess my body." Ji Ling’er smiled charmingly, with a deeper meaning behind it.

Chen Xiang gulped down his saliva. He had never met such a woman, only he had been able to make her have good feelings towards him. But now, this woman actually wanted him to have enough power to kill her.

"Could it be that there’s no man today?" Chen Xiang subconsciously asked, "Is it worth it for the sake of that transformation technique?"

"Of course it’s worth it, that’s a sacred art, and you also have a Green dragon demon-slain broadsword on you, you are someone who was recognized by the God’s Saber, you must have some great achievements in the future, and you are already very powerful, otherwise how could you help me get so many Holy stone." Ji Ling’er laughed tenderly: "Of the women around you, there aren’t many that are stronger than me. Don’t worry, I won’t bully them in the future."

Chen Xiang was speechless: "Is there something wrong with your head? Forget it, you can help me quickly become stronger, I will definitely teach you the Changing Technique."

However, Chen Xiang thought that if he could bring Ji Ling’er back and let her teach him a lesson, who he thought was very powerful, it would be great.

Ji Ling’er held Chen Xiang’s arm: "I will definitely make you stronger, but I need to leave this place first, I want to bring you to a place."

Chen Xiang didn’t know what Ji Ling’er was planning, but he thought that Ji Ling’er was definitely not that simple. He must have some other purpose.

Ji Ling’er brought Chen Xiang into the small town, and asked around. There were no Transmission array here, only the closest city had one.

"Where are you going?" Chen Xiang asked.

"A very safe place."

Ji Ling’er did not tell Chen Xiang in detail that she had bought a Black Hawk mount. Instead, she sat on it with Chen Xiang and flew away from the town.

After flying for half a day, they arrived at a city. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

There were very few people in the city, and it looked very lifeless, but there was a Transmission array.

Ji Ling’er brought Chen Xiang into the Transmission array, and after paying the teleportation fee, said in a low voice: "I’ll take you to the most bustling place in the Sky Capital, that place is the safest place."

After he finished speaking, the Transmission array flashed, and a ray of light flashed past Chen Xiang’s eyes as he was teleported to another place. He saw countless large Transmission array s lined up neatly in a row, with many of them flashing.

Suddenly, a shadow attacked. Raising his head, he saw an incomparably large ship flying through the skies. In the distance, there were also many large and small ships.

At this moment, his eyes were wide open as he looked around. Looking at the numerous giant towers that rose from the ground, as well as the giant holy beasts and ships that flew past from time to time in the sky, he was extremely shocked.

"He must be scared. This is the Super Old Sacred City, he has existed for a long time." Ji Ling’er chuckled: "Let’s go, it’s very safe here. Even though Ji Clan is a huge clan, they don’t dare to cause trouble here, and they can’t just randomly capture people."

Walking on the road, Chen Xiang understood why the strong Holy Beasts were being pressured so badly by the humans of heaven. The people here were truly powerful, of course, there were humans like him, but they were all existences at the bottom.

"Do you not want to go back?" Ji Ling’er saw that Chen Xiang was looking left and right, her eyes filled with shock, and laughed.

"Don’t worry, I heard my father say that the Super Old Sacred City seems to be plotting something, that this city is going to descend to the top of the Nine Heaven World."

Ji Ling’er secretly pulled Chen Xiang out of the wide teleportation area, and walked towards the bustling scene in the distance.

"That’s not a good thing for me." Chen Xiang frowned.

"But if you become strong, that’s good news for you." Ji Ling’er’s beautiful eyes sparkled as she said meaningfully.
