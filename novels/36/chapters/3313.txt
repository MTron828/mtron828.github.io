The red stone brick allowed Chen Xiang to see the ball of golden energy below it. Chen Xiang looked at it carefully for a moment, then muttered: "Could this be the Soul Swallowing Mountain’s energy source?"

Chen Xiang placed his palm on the only red stone brick and fed a large amount of World Defying Stage Fierce Power to the stone brick. Then, he smoothly passed through the stone brick and was absorbed by the yellow energy below.

"As expected, this red brick should be able to transmit energy. If the energy ball below is not enough, it can be sent through here." After Chen Xiang confirmed his thoughts, he frowned: "What exactly is the use of that ball of energy? Could it be that the seal was maintained? Or should I maintain the Soul Swallowing Mountain’s Soul Devouring Flame? "

"Do you know that soon enough?" Feng Ke’er said.

"Don’t absorb it, I can only channel the energy inside, it can’t be absorbed." Chen Xiang wanted to absorb it from within, but to no avail. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He took out the Heavenly magic sword to try and see if he could pierce through it, but he did not succeed. Not only was he unable to pierce through the red stone bricks, the ordinary stone bricks by his side were also unable to pierce through them.

"Try it with my golden needle." Feng Ke’er gave the golden needle to Chen Xiang.

Chen Xiang received it, and used the golden needle to pierce into the stone bricks, easily piercing out a small ’hole’.

"The things refined by the Tao-creation Holy stone are really powerful." That rock was very thick, and the golden needle was too short. However, Feng Ke’er could control the golden needle to become longer.

In the end, Chen Xiang succeeded in piercing through a small hole, and then, he let his own spirit enter the hole.

"What is this?" It gives me a very familiar feeling! " Chen Xiang’s heart trembled: "The golden thing below, is the World Defying Stage Fierce Soul .... And it’s the kind that’s very strong! "

"What kind of World Defying Stage Fierce Soul would it be?" Feng Ke’er asked anxiously: "What World Defying Stage Fierce Soul is so big!"

"I don’t know. Let me see if I can deduct some of it now." "800), Chen Xiang can ’pull out’ a small ball, and this ball of World Defying Stage Fierce Soul’s power is very easy to control, it does not produce any rejection, so I can just send it to Feng Ke’er for him to study.

At that time, he took out another large lump of World Defying Stage Fierce Soul, and placed it into his own Divine Sense Sea.

"What exactly is this thing?" Chen Xiang was very curious about this matter. He knew that there was an extremely mysterious World Defying Stage Fierce Soul in his Divine Sense Sea and now there was another one.

"Let me see if I can fuse them!" Chen Xiang tried it, but did not succeed. "Could it be because my body is too weak, and I am still unable to fuse with the Fourth World Defying Stage Fierce Soul?"

After fusing with the Fourth World Defying Stage Fierce Soul, he would have the cultivation of the Peak of World Defying crazy realm, and would then be able to advance towards the Aoshi Holy Stage.

"Xiao Ke’er, do you know what kind of World Defying Stage Fierce Soul is this? It’s actually such a big lump, and it can even be split apart! " Chen Xiang asked.

"For the time being, I am not sure, but I can say with certainty that this is definitely the World Defying Stage Fierce Soul of fire ... I just don’t know what’s so special about it. " Feng Ke’er said: "It should be something good. I’ll try to see if I can fuse it."

"Alright, since there’s nothing wrong with me staying here, I’ll take the chance to cultivate and eat more Myriad Tao Divine Soil Pills." Chen Xiang’s You Yao Mountain Villa had two young female Dan Souls. They were able to condense a large number of Myriad Tao Divine Soil Pills, which was more than enough for him to consume.

... ....

After all, he had crippled a little Overlord, something that hadn’t happened for many years. Furthermore, he was sealed in the Soul Swallowing Mountain at the end.

"Huang Ziyun, you’re going too far." A white robed middle aged man looked at the burning red flames on the Soul Swallowing Mountain and spoke with a voice filled with anger: "You have destroyed a good seedling."

"Lei Yichen, you must ’understand’ that he was the one who crippled Huang Longsheng first." Huang Ziyun shouted in fury.

"Hmph, Huang Longsheng crippled so many disciples, why haven’t you punished them yet? Yet, you actually dared to make a move on this disciple called Chen Xiang. " When Lei Yichen heard about Chen Xiang, his heart ached for someone who loved money as much as his life.

"Huang Longsheng crippled disciples before? Why didn’t I know? If someone comes to report to me, I will deal with it. " Huang Ziyun sneered.

"Alright, I won’t waste any more time talking to you. Now, I’ll let you release Chen Xiang." Lei Yichen said in a heavy voice.

You should know that I do not have the authority. Once the big ’door’ of the Soul Swallowing Mountain closes, it will require the Leader to open it. Huang Ziyun laughed sinisterly: "Most likely, Chen Xiang’s World Defying Stage Fierce Soul has already been devoured, and you want this kind of thing as well?"

"Even if the World Defying Stage Fierce Soul is being devoured, it’s still better than that broken grandson of yours from the Divine Sense Sea. That grandson of yours is completely crippled, but Chen Xiang cannot, haha ..." Lei Yichen laughed loudly: "When you first made your move, you should have been a bit more ruthless towards Chen Xiang. You should have wanted to destroy Chen Xiang’s’ flesh ’; As long as his body is fine, given him time, and allowed him to merge with the new World Defying Stage Fierce Soul, he will still be very strong. "

"I will go and find the Leader to open the door now. Farewell!" Lei Yichen saw that the wrinkles on Huang Ziyun’s old face were twitching and he was very happy. He laughed loudly and left.

Huang Ziyun glared at the big door, and at the moment, he wanted to immediately open the big door to beat Chen Xiang up, but he himself was unable to do so. He thought that if he sealed Chen Xiang up in the Soul Swallowing Mountain and his World Defying Stage Fierce Soul was devoured, no one would covet Chen Xiang.

Now, he was even going to look for the Leader. If he could ’get’ Chen Xiang out, it would be easy to cultivate him, but in the future, Chen Xiang would definitely be able to recover his strength.

"We must not let Lei Yichen succeed." Huang Ziyun felt resentment in his heart, and then, he hurriedly left. He wanted to use all of his strength, and make Chen Xiang fall into his hands.

Qin Shuang had only just found out about this matter, but she had no other choice. There was a little overlord over there for the male disciples, and there was also an overlord over for their female disciples.

Although Qin Shuang’s personality was tough and unyielding, she was unlike Chen Xiang. Therefore, when she came here, she was able to get along well with many female disciples. To her, it was only a monthly loss of one or two Soul body madness Dan s.

Lei Yichen has already gone to find the Leader, and the Leader will still need more than half a year to come out. At that time, it would be too late for the outer sect disciples to fight over the Ancient fire madness, even if that Chen Xiang fellow comes out, they would definitely miss him.

"But I have to say, Chen Xiang, a new disciple, actually dared to provoke and cripple a little Overlord. Just thinking about it, I feel that he’s very cool, but unfortunately, he didn’t see it with his own eyes."

As Qin Shuang listened to these ’women’ chit-chat, he could tell how much these ’women’ worshiped Chen Xiang from the bottom of their hearts. Because they were also bullied and humiliated by the overlords here, they only thought about it and had no power to do it.

"This Chen Xiang guy only knows how to ’mess’ all day!" Qin Shuang was very worried for Chen Xiang right now, and it was hard for her to calm down and cultivate.
