Omg!

It's actually a king-level beast!

Qin Feng was surprised and happy in his heart.

He finally encountered a king-level beast!

Mutated beasts are one level stronger than ordinary beasts.

And the king-level vicious beast is one level stronger than the mutant level.

Similarly, the explosion rate of mutant-level beasts is ten times that of ordinary beasts.

And the king-level vicious beast is ten times more than the mutant-level vicious beast.

The explosion rate of this bear king has reached 60%.

Kill it, and there is a high probability that the treasure chest will explode!

The more Qin Feng thought about it, the more excited he became.

I can't wait to rush over immediately and kill the bear king.

However, he quickly suppressed his excitement.

This bear king cannot be underestimated!

Its combat evaluation reached 12 stars.

At the same time, it also mastered two E-level talents and one skill.

In this way, the overall strength is stronger!

And Qin Feng's combat evaluation is only 10 stars.

However, he has more talent and ability, but he is not afraid.

Thinking of this, he took a deep breath and walked out of the hiding place slowly.

His move immediately startled the three giant bears.

roar~! roar~!

The two Kaishan bears quickly stood up, looked at Qin Feng vigilantly, and let out a deafening roar.

The bear king was also alarmed, and slowly opened his eyes.

When it saw clearly that Qin Feng was only a 4th-level human, the vigilance in his eyes disappeared instantly, and he closed his eyes lazily.

It's just a small level 4 human, just let its two subordinates solve it, and it doesn't need to worry about it at all.

At this time, the two Kaishan bears also discovered that Qin Feng was only a level 4 human.

The eyes of the two beasts suddenly showed contempt.

A small 4th-level human dares to enter the king's territory, even if an 8th-level human comes, there will be no return!

As it happened, they tore the human to pieces to make up for the king.

roar~! roar~!

A roar!

Two giant bears came to Qin Feng to kill.

Whoa~la~la!

Bang~! Bang~! Bang~!

Suddenly, there was the sound of a tree breaking down and the sound of heavy bear feet landing in the mountain.

Two giant bears are like two giant tanks!

In the blink of an eye, two hill-like bodies were killed in front of Qin Feng.

Whoo~! Whoo~!

Huge bear paws, photographed on the head, cover the sky...

Swish~! Swah~!

Qin Feng dodged twice in a row and easily avoided the attack of the two giant bears.

Bang~! Bang~!

The giant bear shot in the air continuously, and suddenly the ground was cracked, and the gravel was in the air.

At this time, Qin Feng jumped into the air with a single step, and reached the top of one of the giant bears.

The giant bear was startled, and as soon as he turned his head, he opened his mouth and swallowed it.

Qin Feng held the knife in both hands and slashed with all his might!

Knife light flashed!

Kacha~!

Blood splashes!

The huge bear head was cut off!

Poof~!

Columns of blood spurted wildly from the neck.

The huge bear body, staggered two steps back, and fell to the ground.

Boom~!

The beast fell to the ground!

The ground trembled slightly!

Qin Feng also just landed on both feet!

roar~!

Another giant bear roared in fright, turned and ran away...

Swish~!

But before it escaped a few steps, Qin Feng chased after it.

Kacha~!

The sword light flashed, and another huge bear head rolled down.

Om~! Om~!

Two consecutive white lights of energy flew from the bear corpse and poured into Qin Feng's body...

A warm and comfortable feeling washes over the body...

It's so cool!

Killed two more level 6 beasts!

Suddenly increased 420 points of energy.

Qin Feng felt dark in his heart.

Before he could be happy, the bear king's roar sounded in the field.

roar~!

A roar, conveyed several miles away.

The whole mountain was shaking violently.

The leaves rustled.

At this moment, the bear king looked at the bear corpse on the ground, his eyes were red.

Its two capable subordinates met a few times and were killed by the humans in front of them.

This made it extremely angry and extremely shocked.

The human beings in front of them are very powerful and must not be underestimated!

The bear king slowly stood up, reaching a height of five feet, as tall as a three- or four-story building, and his momentum was earth-shattering.

At this moment, Qin Feng was a little surprised.

His thin body, in front of the bear king, looked very small like a mouse in front of a lion.

The bear king stared at Qin Feng coldly, his eyes full of solemnity.

roar~!

Suddenly, it roared!

In the next second, its huge beast body swelled in a circle at a speed visible to the naked eye, the hair on its whole body turned blood red, and its violent aura was doubled.

Qin Feng was shocked, and the Eye of True Sight scanned it away...

Qin Feng quickly dodged.

Bang~!

Kacha~!

The bear king shot in the air, the ground cracked, and countless rubble flew across!

Swish~!

Qin Feng took the opportunity to slash horizontally!

The sharp blade slashed firmly on the bear's arm.
