After a while, zero-degree space.

Inside Qiyue's wooden house.

Qin Feng met Qiyue.

The little girl was very happy to see him.

"Master, congratulations on getting Tayue Town! Now, everyone is very happy, and many people want to move to Tayue Town to live!"

Qiyue described excitedly.

The resources around Tayue Town are better than the headquarters of Longyuan Village.

There are naturally many people who want to come.

In this world full of killing, everyone is fighting for their own chance.

Only by making yourself stronger can you have a greater chance to survive.

"Tell everyone! After Longyuan Village has been upgraded to a level 4 village, we will consider the matter of migration. I will make my own arrangements at that time."

"Well, I'm going to tell everyone now, let them redouble their efforts, and strive to upgrade Longyuan Village to level 4 earlier."

"Go! By the way, you have to work harder on the recent acquisition of the golden treasure chest!"

Qin Feng only needed a golden treasure chest to close the purple diamond treasure chest.

Therefore, his need for the golden treasure chest is a little urgent.

"Master, Yue'er will go now!"

At the moment, Qiyue happily went to the room of the pet egg.

When she is free, she likes to be with the pet greasy.

Because she found that the recent mental fluctuations of the pet are getting stronger and stronger, and it seems that it is about to break out of the shell.

This made her very concerned.

As soon as the pet egg breaks its shell, she will inform the owner as soon as possible.

The owner is waiting for the birth of the pet, and he has long been eager to see it.

She also saw it in her eyes, anxious in her heart.

Therefore, she is now dealing with the tasks given by the master while observing the movements of the pet eggs.

After Qin Feng explained the trivial matters, he entered his room and began to take stock of the gains this time.

At this moment, he sat cross-legged on the floor, opened the panel, and checked his latest progress.

good! good!

His combat power has reached 563 stars!

This time, the level, vocation, and title have been upgraded successively, which has greatly improved his combat power.

Even better, he still has 2730 stats left to add.

Thinking of this, he started to add points.

0

After a while, the attribute points were added, and his combat power soared to 614 stars, a big step forward from the goal of 700 stars.

As long as he reaches 700 star combat power, he can pass the divine grade qualification review and participate in the divine grade foundation building assessment.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng's heart was hot.

Godly build foundation!

That was his only foundation-building goal.

The higher the foundation building rank, the greater the possibility of breaking through to the heavenly realm in the future.

Generally speaking, the success rate of low-grade foundation building breakthroughs to the heaven-level realm is less than 1%.

As for the God Grade Foundation Establishment to break through to the Heaven-level realm, the success rate is 100%.

"I don't want this, let's deal with the waste pill first."

Thinking of this, Qin Feng took out all the more than 1,000 waste pills he had obtained before, and began to extract and purify...

Time flies!

In a blink of an eye, an hour passed by the outside world.

In the wooden house, under the action of Qiyue's time force field, 3 hours have passed.

In the past three hours, Qin Feng has dealt with all the thousand or so waste pills.

At this moment, the house is full of Danxiang.

The floor is full of various elixir, there are as many as a thousand, both first- and second-order.

There is not even a single spiritual pill above the third rank.

"Finally it's all done!"

Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief and felt happy.

Next, he should enjoy these elixir.

I don't know how much my strength will increase after this time?

Thinking of this, Qin Feng began to classify the medicinal herbs.

At this moment, Qi Yue's excited voice sounded in his ears.

"Master! Come and see! Your pet is about to break out of its shell!"

Qin Feng was overjoyed.

He has waited so long for the pet of war, and finally there is movement.

At the moment, he hurriedly put away all the elixir and hurried over.

Chapter 218 Super pet

After a while, Qin Feng entered the next room.

The battle pet egg was placed in the center of the room, and the whole body exuded a dazzling red light, illuminating the entire room.

There are already many fine cracks on the bluish-white eggshell.

At this moment, Qiyue squatted aside, nervously watching the expansion of those cracks.

As soon as Qin Feng came in, she was shocked.

"Master, come quickly! Your pet is about to be born!"

The little girl greeted excitedly.

Qin Feng also walked over excitedly and watched.

Click ~ click ~ click ~!

As soon as he got close, he heard the light cracking of the eggshells coming from the eggshells.

The cracks on it have also become deeper and more and more.

Inside the eggshell, the little guy's mental fluctuations continued to be heard, and he seemed extremely happy.

really!

His pet is about to be born.

"After waiting for so long, I finally waited for this little guy to be born. I don't know what foundation-building grade this little guy will be?"

Qin Feng murmured, feeling both anticipation and nervousness in his heart.

He naturally hopes that his pet can get a high-grade foundation, but this probability is too small.

However, the worst of the sixth-order pets is the mid-level foundation building.

"Master, your pet's breeding time is longer than that of ordinary sixth-order pets. The longer the pet's breeding time, the better the talent. Your pet is likely to be a top-grade foundation building!"

Qi Yue said confidently.

Qin Feng smiled: "It's hard to say, it depends on luck. I naturally hope that this little guy has as much potential as possible."

"In addition, looking at its potential, not only 08 is based on the rank of foundation building, but also its talent. I don't know what level of talent it will awaken?"

Qiyue: "Master, your pet is a descendant of the divine beast Suzaku. It will at least awaken a powerful fire talent. Generally speaking, the talent level of a sixth-order pet is at least B-level or above!"

Qin Feng: "I hope so! If its talent can reach A-level, that's fine. By the way, Yue'er, I feel that you seem to have a kind of talent fluctuation in you."

Qiyue looked proud: "Master, you have completed the second stage of the task of the village of the God Realm before, and all the villagers' talents below the A level have been raised to a level."

"My time talent is A-level, and I can't improve it. Heavenly Dao assisted me in awakening a new talent, which is the B-level talent, the profound meaning of wood, and I also awakened the wood-based skill rejuvenation!"

Qin Feng's eyes lit up, he quickly looked at Qiyue, and checked her talent with the eyes of insight.

Sure enough, her talent column has changed.

[Talent]: Time Control (Class A), Profound Truth of Wood (Class B), Bloodline Talent (Class C, Qilin Bloodline)

good! good!

This girl's talent is getting stronger and stronger, she is already a triple talent, and her potential is getting bigger and bigger.

Qin Feng nodded in relief: "Very good! You have awakened the B-level wood talent and mastered the rejuvenation technique. I am afraid that no one at the same level is your opponent."

Hearing this, the little girl was even happier: "Master, Yue'er also wants to become stronger, and doesn't want to be a drag on you. However, in terms of potential, I should not be as good as your pet!"

Qin Feng smiled and shook his head: "You don't have to belittle yourself! If this pet does not reach the top-grade foundation building, its future potential may not be comparable to yours. As for whether it can reach the high-grade foundation building, it depends on luck, but luck is a matter of luck. ...Huh! That's right!"

Speaking of this, Qin Feng seemed to think of something, so he took out a golden card from the storage ring and put five halos outside.

"Wow! It's the fifth-order **** Kaye! Master, what type of **** card is this?"

Qiyue recognized the rank of the divine card at a glance, and was greatly surprised.

Because the fifth-order **** card will emit five halos, the fourth-order **** card is four halos, and so on.

"This is the fifth-order **** card - the luck card!"

Qin Feng explained casually and checked the effect of the Qi Luck Card.

[Luck Card: A fifth-order **** card blessed by heaven. After using this card, the user's luck will increase a hundredfold within one minute. 】

[Reminder: To use this card, you need to activate it with blood essence. 】

Qin Feng's eyes lit up.

A hundredfold increase in luck!

In that one minute, luck is invincible!

good! good!

"Master, what effect does this **** card have?"

"After using it, you can increase your luck by a hundred times within a minute."

Qi Yue was pleasantly surprised: "Master, then use the luck card against the pet egg to increase its luck by a hundred times."
