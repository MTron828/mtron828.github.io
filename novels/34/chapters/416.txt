Boom~Long~!

A loud bang!

Xing Kun's body burst into pieces!

Then, those remnants shattered inch by inch and turned into starlight!

A stalwart figure stood in the endless starlight.

It is Qin Feng!

The next second, among the countless stars, a dazzling white light flew into Qin Feng's body...

[Successfully kills the level 61 Sky Survey Star Kun (Emperor level), you will get +21 million energy points. 】

[The first kill of the 61-level Sky Survey Star Kun (Emperor-level) is successful, you get +15 reputation points. 】

[Successfully killed the 61-level Sky Survey Star Kun (Emperor-level), and the Lingtian Pass (Lingtian Temple) was released. 】

The next second, Qin Feng's body lit up again with an upgraded white light

【Your level has been promoted to level 30! 】

【Your strength index increases by 40 points! 】

【Your agility index increases by 40 points! 】

【Your BMI increases by 40 points! 】

【Your energy index increases by 40 points! 】

【You get 20 free attributes! 】

good! good!

Level up again!

Qin Feng is very satisfied!

Having said that, this time he beheaded Xing Kun, and he gained another 15 reputation.

Then his reputation has reached 806 points, just breaking 800 points!

Ha ha!

In this way, the 100,000 attribute reward is in hand, and the prestige challenge is over.

Thinking of this, he was in a good mood and stepped forward to pick up the pass.

It was a golden pass with forty-nine mysterious Dao patterns engraved on it, with an extraordinary aura.

With this order, you can enter the Lingtian Temple and participate in the joint assessment.

However, that requires a level of forty.

Qin Feng is still ten levels worse.

No matter all that, it's time for him to go back and awaken his seventh sense.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng put away the pass and turned to return to the star gate.

In the next second, he passed through the star gate and returned to the sky above the Temple of Vientiane.

Having said that, he was very curious, what exactly was on those three moon stars?

Judging from the situation, life exists on the three moon stars.

Unfortunately, he was pressed for time and had no time to explore those.

"By the way, my reputation has reached 806 points, so I can buy another dark treasure chest!"

Qin Feng suddenly thought of this, and hurriedly flew towards the Divine Treasure Hall below.

The ninth level, the Hall of Gods!

Once the reputation reaches 500 points, only one purchase is allowed.

When you reach 650 points, you can only purchase the second time.

When you reach 800 points, you can only purchase the third time.

Qin Feng just reached the third purchase authority.

In just a moment, Qin Feng entered the Hall of Gods Treasure.

After another quarter of an hour, he walked out of the temple with a happy face.

This time, he bought another hidden treasure chest.

At this point, he has four purple diamond treasure chests and four dark treasure chests in his hands. He is only one dark treasure chest away from synthesizing an epic treasure chest.

Once the epic treasure chest is synthesized, he can use the helicopter card to upgrade it to a mythical treasure chest, and then use the luck card to open the treasure chest.

A ninth-order treasure is in hand.

This is one of the benefits of prestige!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng flew towards the eighth **** card hall, and he wanted to continue to buy the available **** cards.

Prestige increased!

The purchase authority of each temple has also been increased, how could he miss it?

There are still many treasures in these temples.

In this way, Qin Feng searched all the way.

Time flies fast!

In the blink of an eye, there was only one hour left before the prestige challenge ended.

Longyuan Town is getting more and more nervous.

Everyone's discussion about Qin Feng's reputation has become more and more intense.

Everyone's hearts are full of expectations, but also a little uneasy.

At the same moment, the headquarter of the Zhi Clan, in a wooden house.

Both the Mirage clone and the Moon Spirit clone are closing their eyes and meditating.

At this moment, the space next to the two avatars changed, and Qin Feng appeared out of thin air.

That was Qin Feng's reverse summoning with space and rushed back.

At this moment, his face was full of joy.

This time he scoured the temple, and he received a lot of money, which made him very satisfied.

Even the Super Synthetic Card, I bought two more.

This return, he entered the zero degree of space.

No one in Long Yuan knew about his return.

A quarter of an hour later, in zero-degree space, inside the room.

Qin Feng took out a red spirit fruit from the storage.

The whole body of the Lingguo is like jade, translucent, exuding strange spiritual power fluctuations.

As soon as it appeared, it released a golden light wheel, and there was a purple glow outside the light wheel.

Within the glow of the glow, the illusion of the disillusionment of the stars and the ups and downs of all beings appeared.

[Sacred Soul Fruit: The seventh-order spiritual fruit, after taking it, can automatically awaken the seventh consciousness - Mana consciousness. 】

[Reminder: To eat this spiritual fruit, you need the soul strength to reach the first level of heaven. 】

Qin Feng took a deep breath.

His soul strength has reached the sixth heaven level, and he can take it completely.

Now is the time to awaken the seventh sense!

Having said that, the prestige challenge is over in an hour.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

And one hour outside, ten hours in zero-degree space, enough for him to refine the sacred fruit of the soul.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng sat cross-legged, ready to take Lingguo

Chapter 356 Yaotian visits and awakens the seventh sense!

Just when Qin Feng was about to take Lingguo, a monstrous wind suddenly came from a certain direction.

Qin Feng quickly looked in that direction.

That is the direction of Qiyue retreat.

Is the moon out?

As soon as Qin Feng thought of this, Qi Yue's excited voice sounded in his ears.

"Master, Yue'er has finished refining the Qilin blood essence! This time, I have obtained the talent of the Thunder Element!"

Qin Feng was overjoyed and quickly thought about it.

The next second, the space in front of him changed, and a pretty figure appeared in front of him.

Qiyue was summoned by him.

Then, Qin Feng looked at Qiyue.

I saw that after leaving the customs, the little girl's temperament became more and more otherworldly, and her whole face was radiant and more beautiful than before.

This is the transformation after the strength is improved!

He looked at it again, and found that the little girl's bloodline talent finally reached A-level, and her talent also had a B-level thunder mystery.

What's even more gratifying is that its basic combat power has reached 2000 stars. If the 500-star best foundation building power is added, the comprehensive strength has reached 2500 stars, which is a proper first-level strength.

In this way, he finally has two heaven-level powerhouses under his command.

One is Xiao Luan'er, who has reached the third level of heaven.

One is Qiyue, who has reached the first level of heaven.

If you count his avatars, it's even more.

At least he has three avatars, he has released the distance constraints, and he can go out to block one side alone, which is equivalent to three extremely powerful helpers.

And his avatar strength, all of them have reached the peak of the fourth level of heaven.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng felt at ease.

Next, it is time for all the subordinates to complete the Holy Martial Exam as soon as possible, so as to create a large number of prefecture-level powerhouses.

If Longyuan Town wants to dominate the world, it is not enough to rely on just a few of them. It also needs many subordinates to manage the world.

"Owner!"

When Qiyue saw Qin Feng, her beautiful eyes lit up, and her eyes were full of joy.

"Yue'er, you have made a lot of progress this time!"

Qin Feng smiled and praised.

Qiyue said gratefully, "If it wasn't for a group of mid-grade kylin blood essence from the master, Yue'er wouldn't have made such a big improvement. That mid-grade divine beast's blood essence has really improved his strength a lot!"

Having said this, Qi Yue couldn't help but sigh.

Qin Feng smiled without saying a word.

Having said that, as long as he awakens his seventh sense, he will be able to refine the ninth-order remnant seal—the seal of the beast god.

After refining the beast **** seal, he can refine any type of divine beast blood essence except the thunder-type divine beast blood essence.

And he has six groups of mid-grade divine beast blood essence in his hands, namely mid-grade Kunpeng blood essence, mid-grade Zhuyan blood essence, mid-grade Teng Snake blood essence, mid-grade White Tiger blood essence, mid-grade Jinwu blood essence, mid-grade Moon blood essence Black blood.

If he refines the blood essence of the six regiments, his strength will definitely improve tremendously.

Of course, all this can only be refined after he has awakened his seventh sense.

In addition, he also has a group of high-grade true dragon blood essence.

"By the way, Master, how is your divine grade assessment this time?"
