Lord Qin Feng has lost after all!

In fact, Qin Feng's blood energy has indeed reached its limit and can no longer be pushed.

However, that was when the bloodline talent was not activated.

If he activates the bloodline talent, the blood energy level will continue to increase!

At this moment, Qin Feng's heart is different from everyone else.

He was amazed and delighted!

Without activating the bloodline talent, Nayashi's blood energy only rose to level 24.

Under the same circumstances, he rose to level 28.

This shows that his blood energy foundation is much stronger than Yehi.

He had already awakened the blood dao talent, and naturally he was stronger than the same rank in blood energy.

If there is another bloodline talent blessing, the blood energy intensity will be even more terrifying!

This test!

He won!

With this in mind, Qin Feng began to stimulate his bloodline talent...

At the same time, Yexi and his party also looked at the monument nervously.

The group finally breathed a sigh of relief when they saw the value on the tablet and stuck at level 28.

Sakya smiled proudly: "Young master, this kid's blood energy is stuck at level 28 for seven seconds! It seems that he has reached the limit!"

Yexi smiled and nodded: "Yes! It should be the limit! If he wants to improve, he can only stimulate the bloodline talent, and he must be the bloodline talent above S rank!"

Sakya sneered: "Young master, don't worry! This kid definitely doesn't have the bloodline talent above S rank!"

The voice just fell, and the mutation suddenly occurred!

Boom~Long~Long~!

Suddenly, Qin Feng's body roared constantly!

His skin was gradually reddening, his muscles had soared, and his blood was soaring!

what! This is?

Yoshidon feels bad!

The whole audience was shocked!

Ow~!

At this moment, a shocking beast roar resounded through the heavens and the earth!

Behind Qin Feng, a phantom shadow suddenly appeared, covering the sky and the ground.

Looking closely, it was actually a giant ape with a height of ten thousand feet, with cyan hair all over its body and four huge fangs, extremely hideous!

Seeing this, there was an exclamation from the crowd!

"That's the divine beast Zhu Yan!"

"It turns out that Lord Qin Feng also has blood talent!"

"Has this bloodline talent reached S rank?"

Om~!

As soon as those words fell, the stele immediately vibrated, and the golden light was released!

The test value on it jumped a bit!

[Blood Energy Strength: Level 29‚Ä¶]

[Score statistics: 66 points...]

Boom~!

This time, the audience is boiling!

So exciting!

Lord Qin Feng's bloodline talent has also reached the S level!

Ye Xi's face darkened instantly!

Saga was even more dumbfounded!

No way?

Did he crow again?

As soon as he opened his mouth, this kid activated an S-rank bloodline talent, as if to oppose him.

Afterwards, he sneered: "Young Master, don't worry! That Zhu Yan is just an inferior divine beast with very limited potential. This kid's bloodline talent is at the early stage of S rank. His blood can reach rank 29, which is already the limit. It's gone!"

As soon as these words fell, the mutation regenerated!

Boom~Long~Long~!

Behind Qin Feng, a giant beast phantom appeared again!

It was a blood-red bat with golden eyes and wingspan!

"Hey! It's the blood monster bat!"

"My God! Lord Qin Feng actually has two kinds of divine beasts' blood in his body!"

Everyone was shocked!

At the same time, Qin Feng's bloodline talent has been upgraded to the mid-S level.

The test values ‚Äã‚Äãon the tablet have also changed!

[Blood Energy Strength: Level 30‚Ä¶]

Saga is stunned!

He never imagined that Qin Feng actually had two kinds of divine beast bloodlines in his body.

He didn't even know that there were more than two kinds of divine beast bloodlines in Qin Feng's body! .

"There are actually two kinds of bloodline talents! Damn it!"

Jessie was furious!

Qin Feng's blood energy level has reached level 30, only 3 levels worse than him!

This gave him a sense of crisis!

At this time, Sakya also came back to his senses!

His heart is also extremely angry!

Why was Qin Feng slapped in the face every time he finished speaking!

He doesn't believe it!

He is a crow's mouth!

Besides, a person can have two kinds of bloodline talents at the same time, that is the limit.

This time, it should be impossible for Qin Feng to have the third type - bloodline talent.

With this in mind, he glanced coldly at Qin Feng's back and muttered to Yexi again.

"Young Master, whether it is Zhu Yan or the blood demon bat, they are all low-level divine beasts with extremely limited potential! This kid's bloodline talent cannot be higher."

"According to common sense, a person can only have two kinds of bloodline talents at most, this kid can't have a third kind..."

Boom~Long~Long~!

Before the words were finished, two phantoms of divine beasts appeared behind Qin Feng at the same time!

A mythical beast with a height of ten thousand feet, a snow-white body, and the shape of an elk!

It is the divine beast‚ÄîFu Zhu!

One is 10,000 zhang long, with a yellow body and feathered wings on its back, and looks like a wild python!

It is the mythical beast - the snake!

Om~!

The next second, Qin Feng's bloodline talent was born again, and he was promoted to the peak of S-level!

His blood energy also reached level 31!

This time, the audience is completely fried!

Four!

Lord Qin Feng has four kinds of bloodline talents in his body!

Saga was completely dumbfounded!

His mouth is wide open!

Jessie was furious!

Immediately, he thought of something and looked at Saga angrily!

Couldn't it be caused by this crow's mouth again?

Sakya was so frightened that his throat rolled and he swallowed, half speechless!

But without waiting for them to think about it, the changes in the field continued!

Boom~Long~Long~!

I saw behind Qin Feng, the phantoms of divine beasts appeared again and again!

Kunpeng phantom! Chaos phantom! Gluttonous phantom! Moon Crow Phantom! Three-legged Golden Crow phantom!

The beast that appeared!

One is stronger than the other!

The momentum is more terrifying than the last!

Of course, Qin Feng's bloodline talent will be upgraded by the presence of a phantom of a mythical beast.

Sometimes, when two or three phantoms of divine beasts appear at the same time, his bloodline talent will rise to a higher level!

In the blink of an eye, behind Qin Feng, more than a dozen gods and beasts appeared, and the momentum covered the sky!

The audience was stunned!

"My God! Thirteen kinds of bloodline talents! Lord Qin Feng has thirteen kinds of bloodline talents!"REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

"Gold, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, thunder, light, and darkness, all nine elements are complete! How did Master Qin Feng do it?"

"No... I don't know! This is too amazing!"

This time, everyone was completely shocked!

Qin Feng's bloodline breath has reached the peak of SS level!

Om~!

The monument vibrated violently, illuminating the sky with golden light!

The test values ‚Äã‚Äãon it have also undergone tremendous changes!
