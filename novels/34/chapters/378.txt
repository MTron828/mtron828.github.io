But what if it was discovered?

It's a big deal, do it right!

He is not afraid of this heavenly threshold boy!

Boom~!

Thinking of this, Xiao Yun rose into the sky, and his momentum instantly overwhelmed the audience.

This time, the audience was shocked, and they looked over in astonishment one by one.

Chapter 330 Space Talent! Time and space call!

"That is…"

"Someone!"

Liu Yuan and the others looked at Xiao Yun in astonishment.

There was a commotion all over the place!

Everyone in Long Yuan did not expect that there was still a person hiding near this battlefield.

It seems that the momentum of the person is actually a heaven-level powerhouse!

This time, everyone in Long Yuan was a little panicked.

Every Heaven-level powerhouse is an extremely terrifying existence!

Those prisoners of war were also horrified in their hearts, but they didn't dare to look up at the fear they had before, they only dared to eavesdrop.

In the field, the only-phantom avatar was calm.

He had already discovered - Xiao Yun's existence.

Because of this, he did not immediately extract Miyamoto Lang's body.

To prevent him from being attacked by Xiao Yun when he was extracting.

Xiao Yun also looked at the Mirage clone, and didn't take Liu Yuan and others seriously.

In his eyes, only the Mirage clone is the opponent, and the rest are all ants.

"Little friend's six senses are very strong! I discovered the existence of this old man so quickly!"

Xiaoyun said, while spying on the details of the phantom avatar.

But the phantom avatar had already used secret techniques to cover up his information.

Xiao Yun naturally found nothing.

Even Xiao Yun didn't see it, the young man in front of him was just a clone.

At the same moment, the phantom avatar also activated the eye of peeping, and peeped towards Xiaoyun...

【Human】: Guardian

[realm]: heaven level

[Level]: Level 58

[Talent]: Law of Darkness (Class A), Law of Water (Class A)

【Skill】:? ? ?

[Combat Strength Evaluation]: 1800 stars

[Origin]: The patriarch of the guard force Owl Clan.

what!

This old man is actually the patriarch of the Owl Clan!

If you kill the old man, you can get the title deed card of the Owl Clan's nest.

The Mirage clone's eyes shine!

A title deed card for the guardian force can be exchanged for a lot of points.

In more than ten hours, the points leaderboard will come out.

If you can help the main body get more points, the benefits will be endless.

What's more, killing the heaven-level guardian can allow the main body to obtain a large number of attribute points.

At present, the main body is about to participate in the high-level divine grade assessment, and the certainty is only about 70%.

If you can kill the old man and let the body gain more attribute points, the confidence will be even greater.

At this thought, the Mirage clone's heart became hot.

He is Qin Feng's avatar, an extension of Qin Feng's body.

Between the two, one is prosperous, and the other is lost.

Everything he does is for the sake of being.

I didn't expect it!

There are also benefits that are delivered to your door.

The Mirage clone stared at Xiao Yun, like a hunter staring at his prey.

"Boy, are you Qin Feng?"

Xiao Yun opened his mouth.

The phantom avatar was stunned for a moment: "You actually know the name of my body. It seems that your appearance is not a coincidence!"

As soon as these words came out, Xiao Yun and all the prisoners were a little stunned.

Ontology?

What's the meaning? !

Boom~!

But before they could think about it, the Mirage clone suddenly shot and took the initiative to kill Xiaoyun.

Now that you know that Xiaoyun is the guardian, there is nothing to hesitate.

"court death!"

Xiao Yun was shocked and angry!

Before he could make a move, this kid took the lead.

A kid on the threshold of heaven, dare to be so arrogant.

Whoo~!

Xiao Yun flipped it over and summoned a black long sword.

As soon as the long sword came out, the breath of death suddenly erupted!

Within ten thousand feet, the vegetation will automatically wither!

It was a sixth-order long sword called the Heavenly Sword of Desolation, and its power was extremely extraordinary.

"Quick! Quickly retreat!"

Liu Yuan exclaimed.

Seeing that the situation was not good, everyone in Long Yuan retreated.

In this level of war, they have no qualifications to intervene at all. If they can protect themselves from being affected, it means that they have not delayed the phantom avatar.

In the blink of an eye, the Mirage clone was killed in front of Xiao Yun.

Boom~Long~Long!

Xiao Yun completed the world and the earth in an instant!

Suddenly, the momentum skyrocketed, and in the blink of an eye, it reached a 2800-star horror level.

Facing the attack of the phantom clone, his eyes showed disdain.

A heavenly threshold dare to take the initiative to provoke!

He must teach this humble thief a good lesson!

Swish~!

Xiao Yun stabbed away with a sword.

The long sword lit up with a dazzling sword light, reaching the sky and the ground!

Click~! Click~! Click~!

Wherever the sword's edge passed, every inch of space was shattered!

Ow~!

The Mirage clone also slashed out.

Shocking Dragon Blade issued a shocking dragon roar!

Make the world tremble, and all worlds tremble!

In the blink of an eye, the swords collided!

Boom~!

A loud bang!

Ten thousand feet of void, all exploded!

The terrifying sound of the explosion spread in all directions, and wherever it passed, the grass and trees were broken, the sand and dust were churning, and the heaven and the earth shattered.

Some prisoners near the center of the explosion were also affected, and they all vomited blood and flew out.

In the next second, Xiao Yun groaned, and was hacked to the point of vomiting blood and flew out.

Seeing this scene, Liu Yuan and others cheered.

Ha ha!

The boss is also great!

With just one clone, it severely injured a Heaven-level powerhouse.

Bang~!

Another bang!

Earth shakes!

Xiaoyun was split and fell from the sky, smashing a huge human-shaped pit on the ground.

"damn it!"

In the next second, his eyes were blood red, he rose into the sky with a roar, and slaughtered the phantom clone again.

He couldn't believe it, and couldn't accept it. He couldn't bear a knife from a challenger.

Was it just an illusion?

"die!"

Swish~!

The Mirage clone slashed again.

Xiao Yun quickly blocked with the horizontal sword.

Another groan!

Xiao Yun was hacked again and vomited blood and flew upside down, and his body kept rolling in the air.

His combat power is only 2800 stars.

The combat power of the Mirage clone is 60% of Qin Feng's, reaching 3400 stars.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

In addition, the Mirage clone has more than a dozen kinds of talents and abilities, and Xiao Yun has only two talents.

In such a comparison, a judgment is made!
