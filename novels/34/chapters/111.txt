In the blink of an eye, Qin Feng and his clone rushed to the turtle king at the same time.

Woo~! Woo~! Woo~!

The Turtle King is in a hurry, and the strange calls are repeated.

huh~! huh~! huh~!

The turtles attacked quickly.

Suddenly, hundreds of ice arrows were divided into two groups.

A wave shot towards the phantom clone.

A wave shot towards Qin Feng.

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

Qin Feng's long sword danced wildly.

Knife gas vertical and horizontal!

Earthshaking!

Click~! Click~! Click~!

In the blink of an eye, he shattered hundreds of ice arrows.

Bang~! Bang~! Bang~!

And the rest of the ice arrows, all bombarded him, but he also carried them all down.

Bang~!

On the other side, the phantom clone did not hold it, and was blasted on the spot, turning into countless spots of light.

The Turtle King was overjoyed, and he was about to mobilize the group and launch a second attack.

But before it could move, Qin Feng took the opportunity to kill him.

Swish~!

The turtle king roared, screaming constantly.

This time, it was too late to organize a group attack because Qin Feng was too close to it.

At the critical moment, dozens of giant tortoises rushed towards Qin Feng desperately, trying to resist.

As long as they stop Qin Feng, the Turtle King can successfully organize the second wave of group attacks.

Swish~!

At this moment, Qin Feng was divided into two again.

The phantom clones condensed out again and rushed towards the dozens of giant tortoises.

Although the clone is only half as powerful as Qin Feng, it is far stronger than the giant tortoises.

As soon as he shot, he hacked and killed several in a row.

At the same time, Qin Feng continued to kill the Turtle King.

Without the obstruction of the giant tortoises, in just one breath, he killed the tortoise king.

The Turtle King was terrified and wanted to turn around and run away, but it was too late.

At the critical moment, it opened its mouth and spewed out a large cloud of blue mist.

Click~! Click~! Click~!

In an instant, the water within a radius of 100 meters solidified into ice.

Qin Feng was also instantly frozen in it.

The Turtle King was overjoyed and wanted to take the opportunity to escape.FOlloow ùíèewest stories at nùíê(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Click~! Bang~!

But at this moment, there was a shocking explosion!

The 100-meter ice block burst instantly!

Qin Feng broke out of the seal and instantly killed the turtle king.

He has already mastered the true meaning of ice.

How could the freezing technique trap him!

Swish~!

Underwater knife light flashes!

Kacha~!

A crisp sound!

Blood spurted out, dyeing the lake red.

The Turtle King didn't even have time to let out a scream, and was split into two halves.

A silver treasure chest was also revealed.

Qin Feng was overjoyed.

Boom~!

As soon as the turtle king died, the entire turtle group lost its backbone, and the fighting spirit collapsed in an instant.

Suddenly, all the turtles scurried around, and no one organized a counterattack.

This time, it wasn't just the Turtle King who died.

Even the two Turtle Generals in the group died early.

Qin Feng was overjoyed, secretly thinking that the opportunity to harvest had come.

At the moment, he and the phantom clone separated and rushed to the turtle group.

Those giant tortoises did not have the will to resist, and they were immediately killed to the uttermost, turning into a one-sided slaughter.

In this way, one person and one clone, madly killing the Quartet...

Suddenly, his energy value was soaring all the way, and it was not far from the upgrade in just a moment.

He was in a good mood, and he harvested the turtles happily.

A killing feast continues...

At the same time, on the Bone Wasteland.

Liu Xuan is fighting fiercely with three level 10 beasts.

I saw twenty steel knives whistling around him, among them blood wolf knives.

These twenty-one weapons formed a knife array. Under the control of his magnetic talent, he was so powerful that he killed three level 10 beasts.

In just a moment, he beheaded a fierce beast, and his momentum suddenly increased.

A few minutes later, the other two beasts also died under the chaos of the sword.

"My strength is getting stronger and stronger! With one enemy against three, in less than a quarter of an hour, I killed three level 10 beasts!"

Liu Xuan smiled with satisfaction.

He was very satisfied with his results.

At this rate, he will soon be able to rise to level 9.

Having said that, this upgrade is getting harder and harder!
