In the next breath, the Book of Existence flew out of his body!

Boom~Long~Long~!

Immediately afterwards, the "Book of the World" slowly opened, and a dazzling golden light bloomed, covering the entire sea area, making it extremely sacred!

Afterwards, it created a monstrous suction force on the entire sea area!

huh~! huh~! huh~!

In the next breath, the white light clusters left behind by the blasted blood gods were quickly sucked into the Book of the World, and disappeared...

At the same moment, in Qin Feng's sea of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge, a reminder of the Tao of Heaven sounded.

[Your "Book of the Present World" successfully absorbed the true spirit of the Blood God Son, Destiny Value +1]

[Your "Book of the Present World" successfully absorbed the true spirit of the Blood God Son, Destiny Value +1]

[Your "Book of the Present World" successfully absorbed the true spirit of the Blood God Son, Destiny Value +1]

Qin Feng's eyes lit up with ecstasy!

Ha ha!

Everything is as he expected!

After the blood gods were exploded, the light clusters left behind were the true spirits of the blood gods.

And all things such as true spirits, soul fragments, karma, etc., can be converted into Destiny Points.

In this way, he can not only reduce the number of blood godsons, but also increase the destiny value of "Book of the World" to advance!

It really kills two birds with one stone!

Before Qin Feng could be happy, another white light flew from the blood gods and poured into his body crazily.

[You succeeded in killing the Son of Blood, and obtained +10,000 attributes, +20,000 energy, and +1 golden judgment]

[You succeeded in killing the Son of Blood, and obtained +10,000 attributes, +20,000 energy, and +1 golden judgment]

[You succeeded in killing the Son of Blood, and obtained +10,000 attributes, +20,000 energy, and +1 golden judgment]

what! This is

Qin Feng was stunned!

Immediately, he wanted to understand, and there was ecstasy in his eyes.

It turned out that the "Book of the World" absorbed those true spirits, and the Son of Blood could not be resurrected, which was equivalent to being completely killed by him, and the Tao of Heaven would naturally feed him back.

Suddenly, Qin Feng's attribute points, energy value, and judgment value are skyrocketing wildly all the way!

The Destiny value of the present book is also skyrocketing wildly all the way!

The number of the blood gods finally began to decrease!

This makes Qin Feng in a good mood!

Randomly, with a thought, he intensified the attack of the Shenyu Arrow Formation!

huh~! huh~! huh~!

Suddenly, thousands of feather arrows shot wildly around!

Bang~! Bang~! Bang~!

The blood **** son was killed in pieces!

Their numbers are starting to decrease like crazy!

In the blink of an eye, Qin Feng killed more than 80,000 blood gods!

"Little thief! Stop it!"

At this moment, Styx's shocking roar resounded in the field!

After he was blown away by Qin Feng, he stabilized his figure, and when he saw this scene, he felt extremely distressed.

These blood gods, but he beheaded countless creatures, and then used their remnants to refine the blood gods.

Now, in just a while, Qin Feng has killed tens of thousands of his blood gods.

4.6 That's all his hard work!

As soon as the roar fell, he recklessly killed Qin Feng!

He must stop this nasty little thief!

Boom~Long~Long~!

In the blink of an eye, he slaughtered to the front, only a hundred feet away from Qin Feng!

But at this moment, a mutation occurred!

Om~!

When I saw the sky, the "Book of Existence" suddenly vibrated, and the light that bloomed became more and more dazzling. Its breath is also skyrocketing wildly all the wayF√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

At the same moment, in Qin Feng's sea of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge, a reminder of the Tao of Heaven sounded.

[The Destiny value of your "Book of the Present World" has reached 1/1, which meets the advanced requirements and is being automatically advanced]

„ÄêAdvanced success! Congratulations on your "Book of the Present World", you have been promoted to the ultimate level of high-grade gods]

[The back-feeding combat power of "Book of the Present World" has been increased to 2 stars]

[The Heavenly Dao ability of "Book of the Present World" has been improved, which can strengthen all time skills]

[The authentic ability of "Book of the Present World" has been improved, which can strengthen all space skills]

[The humane ability of "Book of the Present World" has been improved, and the value of its blessings has reached 50 times]

Qin Feng is overjoyed!

His "Book of the Present World" has advanced!

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, his combat power and luck value also began to increase simultaneously.

Chapter 724 Tianzun's calculation! The Book of Earth is here!

In a blink of an eye, Qin Feng's combat power has increased to 1.413 billion stars, and his luck has also increased to 370 times!

But under the blessing of Chaos Power and luck, his comprehensive combat power is comparable to 1.57 billion stars, which is very close to 1.6 billion stars!

This is the feedback brought by the advanced "Book of the World", which made his strength skyrocket!

Qin Feng is very satisfied!

At this moment, Tiandao came to remind again

[Reminder: "Book of the Present World" has advanced to the 'Extreme Divine Rank', and needs to absorb 100,000 points of destiny]

„ÄêCurrent progress: 47/1„Äë

Hearing the prompt, Qin Feng quickly calculated in his heart.

Killing a blood **** child can only gain 1 life value.

With that 100,000 Destiny Points, 10,000 Blood God Sons must be killed!

It seems that he has to speed up the killing speed!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng's wings trembled again and again, and he sped up energy feather arrows!

Bang~! Bang~! Bang~!

Suddenly, one after another, the blood gods were bombarded and turned into blood mists!

The fall of the Blood God Son has become faster!

The "Book of the World" has also become faster at swallowing true spirits!

The white light that poured into Qin Feng's body became more and more!

His attribute points, energy value, and judgment value have been soaring wildly!

This is simply a feast of harvest!

Boom~Long~Long~!

But at this moment, Demon Venerable Styx came to the front again!

"Little thief! Go to hell!"

Boom~!

Ming He punched Qin Feng with all his strength!

His eyes were bursting with anger, and he could not wait to smash Qin Feng into scum with one punch!

It is this little thief who has killed hundreds of thousands of blood gods! 19

Those are his millions of years of hard work!

Click~! Click~! Click~!

That punch came, the world burst into pieces, and the momentum was stronger than before!

"roll!"

Qin Feng slashed directly with a sword!

Boom~!

The corpse puppet on the side also punched the Demon Venerable Styx at the same time!

In the blink of an eye, the two sides attacked and collided!

Bang~~!

Another loud bang!

Styx Demon Venerable was blasted away again!

This time, he was blasted farther and rolled directly out of a hundred thousand feet.

As soon as the Demon Venerable Minghe flew away, Qin Feng seized the time and continued to kill those blood gods!

In the blink of an eye, he killed another 200,000 blood gods and gained a lot of attribute points!

"Book of the World" also absorbed more than 20,000 points of destiny, and the increase was extremely fast!

At this moment, Demon Venerable Styx once again stabilized his figure!

When he stabilized, he quickly raised his head and looked at Qin Feng with a shocked expression.

After a while, the attack power of this little thief increased again, and it was very close to 1.6 billion stars.

If it continues like this, even if this little thief doesn't have the help of the corpse puppet, he can still fight on a par with him!

damn it!

Where the **** did this little thief come from? !

How can it be so strong!

Is he really just a heavenly realm?

Just when Demon Venerable Styx was thinking wildly, Qin Feng killed hundreds of thousands of blood gods in one go!

The Demon Venerable Styx looked at his canthals to pieces!

Those are all his blood!

no!

He has to change the situation quickly!

I can't let this little thief kill any more!

But if he wanted to kill this little thief, he had to get the help of the Sons of Blood.

Otherwise, with his current combat power, there is no possibility of killing this little thief at all!

But what annoyed him was that those blood gods couldn't get close to the little thief at all, and there was no chance to attack the little thief at all!
