It can be so!

In this way, he is not far from an A-level talent!

Now, among his Five Elements talents, both the Wood and Earth elements have reached B rank.

The only difference is that the gold and fire series have not reached the B level.

Ha ha!

Anyway, he finally found a way.

Having said that, the Profound Truth of the Five Elements is also of the Profound Truth level, but its power is comparable to the law level of A-level.

It can be seen that the development potential of the five elements talent is greater than that of the single line talent.

The more Qin Feng thought about it, the more delighted he became.

Then, he stopped thinking about these chores and began to deal with business.

That is the synthetic dark treasure chest.

Thinking of this, he took out five silver treasure chests and a synthetic card.

After a while, the five silver treasure chests and synthetic cards disappeared.

There was a golden treasure chest in his hand.

"It's finally time to start!"

Qin Feng took a deep breath and took out four golden treasure chests and a synthetic card.

With a thought, he activated the synthetic card in his hand.

Om~!

The synthetic card floats in the air, emitting a dazzling white light.

A great formation of five-pointed stars projected from the card.

Woo~! Woo~! Woo~!

Immediately afterwards, the five golden treasure chests slowly floated into the air and automatically flew to the five-pointed star formation, and were distributed to the five formation eye positions.

Om~!

The big array is running, and the strong light is intertwined!

The five treasure chests began to overlap and merge.

After a while, the synthetic card disappeared, and the big formation also disappeared.

A treasure chest with a dark golden radiance and a simple atmosphere was suspended in the air.

[Reminder: The treasure chest has been synthesized, congratulations on getting a dark treasure chest! 】

Ha ha!

done!

Dark treasure chest!

The highest level treasure chest that can be synthesized by synthesis cards!

Qin Feng happily caught the dark treasure chest that fell from the sky.

[Dark treasure chest: 98% chance to open fifth-order items, 2% chance to open sixth-order items. 】

At the moment, he couldn't wait to open the treasure box.

The next second, the white light lit up and the treasure chest disappeared.

There was a long knife with a black handle and a white blade in his hand.

There is an aura of slaughter hidden on it, as if it came from ancient times, unfathomable.

【Treasure box opened successfully! Obtain the fifth-order item - the dark night sword! 】

[Dark Night Sword: Attack Power +300, Strength +100, Attack Speed ​​+130%, Armor Break +100%, Wound Tear +100%, Dark Power Increase +100%. 】

good! good!

This is a Tier 5 weapon!

Qin Feng fondly stroked the blade.

This night sword is best for those who master the power of the night, because it can increase the power of darkness by 100%Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Coincidentally, he has mastered the profound meaning of darkness and can control the power of darkness.

Get this magic knife, like a tiger with wings.

Let's compare the information of Wind Scar's Blade.

[Blade of Wind Scar: Attack Power +100, Attack Speed ​​+100%, Armor Break +30%, Wound Tear +100%. 】

This dark night sword is more than a grade stronger than the blade of wind marks.

Qin Feng replaced the Dark Night Sword with satisfaction, and the comprehensive combat power suddenly skyrocketed.

Then, he put away the blade of wind marks.

The Blade of Wind Mark, a Tier 4 item, can be exchanged for at least one golden treasure chest, and it is also a treasure.

Having said that, he still has a synthetic card and two silver treasure chests in his hand, but it is a pity that he continues to accumulate.

Maybe before the novice assessment is over, he will be able to close a hidden treasure chest.

Qin Feng thought happily.

I don't want to think so much anymore, it's time to kill the Hellfire Demon King.

With this equipment replacement, his strength skyrocketed, making him happy.

After a while, he finished dealing with the scene, then continued to set off and walked towards the depths of Burning Heaven Valley.

Time flies!

In a blink of an eye, half an hour passed.

Qin Feng came to the end of Burning Heaven Valley.

At the end, there was an open-mouthed cave that seemed to lead straight to the belly of the volcano.

Countless fiery red magma continuously flowed out of the cave, forming a huge magma pool at the entrance of the cave, and then overflowing several magma rivers and flowing out of the valley.

At this moment, Qin Feng is standing beside the lava pool.

He smelled a faint floral fragrance.

Looking at the fragrance of the flowers, he saw that inside the cave, in the magma, a fiery red lotus flower actually grew.

The whole body of the lotus is as red as jade, with twelve petals blooming.

isn't it? !

A lotus flower actually grew out of this magma?

Qin Feng almost thought he was wrong.

Immediately, his True Sight scanned away.

【Name】: Fire Red Lotus

[Grade Rank]: 5.4 Fourth-Order Spirit Flower

【Origin】: After the death of Huofeng, part of the essence and blood was transformed.

[Origin]: Huofeng is one of the direct descendants of the divine beast Suzaku, and its body contains a high level of Suzaku divine blood.

【effect】:? ? ?

wow!

This is actually a fourth-order spirit flower!

Qin Feng's eyes lit up.

It is a pity that his Eye of True Sight is too low to detect the effect of the 'flaming red lotus'.

It seems that he has to find an opportunity to improve the rank of the Eye of True Sight.

Having said that, Tier 4 items are equivalent to gold treasure chest items.

This fiery red lotus is definitely a treasure.

He's set!

Qin Feng was excited.

However, he didn't do it.

Because there was a human sitting next to the fiery red lotus.

A red-haired man sitting cross-legged on lava.

With the flow of magma, his figure ups and downs, extremely elegant.

At this moment, he seemed to sense Qin Feng's arrival, slowly raised his head, and looked at Qin Feng

Chapter 124 Demonization! Hundred-star combat power!

Qin Feng also looked at the red-haired man.

At this moment, the two looked at each other with fearful expressions in their eyes.

This man is not afraid of the high temperature of the magma, floating on the magma, it is very strange.

Could it be that this red-haired man is the Demon King of Hell?

Qin Feng's heart moved, and the Eye of True Sight scanned it away.

[Race]: Human (Emperor)

[Level]: Level 18

[Combat Strength Evaluation]: 82 stars

[Characteristics]: Summoning, the undead body in the lava.

【Skill】:? ? ?

【talent】:? ? ?

[Reminder]: Extremely evil

【Origin】: From Zhongqian World, he used to be a breeder of Huofeng chicks. Because of poor feeding, the young Huofeng birds died prematurely and were executed by angry clansmen.

[Origin]: Tiandao resurrected him and became one of the guardians of the No. 1 novice area in the Blue Star Realm, wandering in a thousand novice villages.

【Origin】: He was resurrected from the dead, and he was born with resentment and evil in nature.

hiss~!

This guy is actually an emperor-level existence, one level higher than the Resentful Demon.

Its combat power is 82 stars, which is 11 stars higher than that of the Resentful Demon.

Qin Feng was a little surprised.

However, is he the Demon Lord of Hell?

Looking at the information, it did not suggest that he was the Demon King of Inferno, but only that he was one of the guardians of the No. 1 novice area in the Blue Star Realm.

Weird!

What exactly is this person's 07 class?

By the way, looking at its origin, he used to be a breeder of fire phoenix chicks.

Could it be that the fiery red lotus was conceived by the blood of the fire phoenix chick he raised to death?

Qin Feng has all kinds of guesses in his heart.

He also noticed a problem, that is, this man is from Zhongqian World.

The mummy he encountered at the beginning was also from the Zhongqian World.
