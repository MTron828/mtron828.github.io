The knife stuck to Qin Feng's shoulder and slashed on the street.

Bang~!

A knife fell!

The gravel is flying!

The gravel-paved street was chopped down with knife pits several feet long.

The fat man was stunned.

He was blown away!

But before he could think about it, a cold light flashed in the black fog.

Swish~!

A knife light flashed from the fat man's neck!

puff~!

A splash of blood!

A huge head rolled down from the fat man's neck.

The headless corpse staggered back two steps and fell backwards.

Bang~!

A muffled sound!

The headless corpse fell heavily to the ground, smashed into dust and blood flowed...

In just one face-to-face, Qin Feng instantly killed the resentful spirit messenger.

The next second, a white light flew from the headless corpse and poured into Qin Feng's body...

The four-dimensional attributes have increased by 20 points!

The free attribute also increased by 10 points!

It turns out that after level 10, every time you level up, the attribute points you get are doubled!

Qin Feng is full of surprises

Chapter 84 The Demon Sealing Altar

It turns out that after level 10, every time you level up, the attribute points you get are doubled!

Qin Feng was surprised.

He glanced at his combat strength assessment, and sure enough, it soared to 53 stars.

This level up, directly increased the combat power of 2 stars.

cool!

That's how strength should be improved.

[Killing the 13th-level Wraith Messenger (King-level) successfully, the quest item-dark spar is exploded. 】

Qin Feng hurriedly looked down and saw that the corpse lit up with a burst of white light.

I saw a black spar the size of a ping-pong ball emerging from the corpse.

exploded!

The quest item finally exploded!

He hurried forward to pick it up.

[Dark spar: quest item. After collecting all seven, you can go to the Demon Sealing Table, unlock the seal, and release the Demon of Resentment. 】

The first dark spar has arrived.

The moment Qin Feng picked up the spar, Tiandao issued a reminder to everyone.

[Task reminder: Qin Feng, a novice, got the first dark spar. 】

As soon as the information was announced, the channel cheered.

"Haha! Great! Boss Qin Feng got the first spar so quickly!"

"Powerful! The boss is really powerful!"

"Brothers, Qin Feng is working so hard, we have to work hard to provide him with some support as much as possible!"

"That's right! Boss Qin Feng is still six short, and the challenges ahead may be more difficult. We must help him as much as possible."

"As it should be!"

"Action! Everyone, take action! Kill monsters! Keep killing monsters!"

"I've already started to act!"

"Haha! I'm killing monsters!"

At this moment, everyone united and fought hard.

At the same moment, on that street.

After Qin Feng put away the dark spar, he began to extract Fatty's body.

【Endless extraction success! Once again obtained the C-level talent - the true meaning of power! 】

[The two talents are automatically superimposed and strengthened, and they are evolving independently...]

[Talent evolution is successful! Your strength talent has been promoted to B-level - Strength Mystery. 】

[Strength Profound Truth: Power talent, comprehend the profound meaning of the law of power, and strengthen the power tenfold. 】

Fuck it~!

B-level talent!

He finally has a B-level talent!

Qin Feng was ecstatic.

B-level talent!

It takes about 1 in 10,000 people to awaken.

In other words, only ten novice villages can produce a B-level talent powerhouse.

Although he has SSS-level endless extraction, it is a special talent and has no bonus to combat power.

If you want to improve your strength, you have to rely on combat talents.

This B-level power mystery is the talent of the fighting class.

[Reminder: After your strength talent evolves, the power of the skill 'External Energy' doubles! 】

what!

Skill power is also enhanced.

Qin Feng's eyes lit up and he waved a knife.

Swish~!

Knife gas out of the body!

Bang~!

More than half of a wooden house ten feet away was split and collapsed.

good! good!

The blade range has doubled!

The power is also stronger!

In this way, his overall strength has been enhanced.

This feeling of getting stronger and stronger is really cool.

I'm afraid no one can fight like him and become stronger at the same time.

Because talents above SS level are unique.

Of the tens of billions of people in the world, he is the only one who has endless extraction.

Therefore, he can continuously extract goals, continuously strengthen himself, and grow without limit.

It was at this moment that the ground ahead began to wriggle, engulfing the fat man's body.

After a while, there was only a rusted machete left on the ground!

That's a fat man's weapon!

Qin Feng was curious and picked up the machete.

[Rusty Butcher Knife: Tier 2 item, attack power +20, armor breaking +50%. 】

This is actually a second-order item!

Qin Feng's heart moved, one hand touched the blade, and he started endless extraction.

Om~!

A flash of white light flashed!

The rust on the butcher's knife disappeared at a speed visible to the naked eye, and it became cold and radiant, as if brand new.

【Endless extraction success! You extract the rust and residue from the 'Rusty Butcher's Knife', and the 'Rusty Butcher's Knife' is promoted to a 'Blood Butcher's Knife'. 】

[Blood Butcher Knife: Tier 3 item, attack power +50, armor breaking +100%. 】

good! good!

It was exactly as he expected.

After a while, the second-order item became the third-order item, and its value doubled several times.

Earned it again this time!

Qin Feng happily put away the blood butcher knife and was very satisfied.

The value of a Tier 3 item is comparable to a silver treasure chest.

The harvest this time is even greater than killing the three-headed dog of hell.

Qin Feng was very satisfied.

[Reminder: Seventeen people in the Blue Star Realm have obtained the 'Task Guidance Scroll' (this progress is reminded every ten minutes). 】

Fuck it~!

Seventeen people so soon!

The Blue Star Realm is indeed a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon!

Qin Feng felt anxious.
