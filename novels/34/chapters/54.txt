"Miyamoto-sama, are you ready to hunt the beasts?"

Nobu Takeda asked very respectfully.

"Don't worry! Takeda-kun, take this short knife."

Miyamoto Lang pulled out the short knife from his waist and handed it over with a serious expression.

"Lord Miyamoto, what is this short knife?"

"It's a wrong sword! If I lose this bet, I will cut myself to death on the spot! Takeda-kun, use this short sword to guide me wrong! Please!"

Hearing this, Takeda Shin was in awe.

Miyamoto-sama is indeed a respectable samurai!

"Hay!"

At the moment, Takeda Shin took the Jiecuo knife with both hands, his expression was extremely serious, and he even had a sacred bearing in the ceremony.

But at this moment, a series of amazing announcements resounded throughout the entire No. 5 Village!
