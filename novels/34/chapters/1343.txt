Feeling the breath of the Great Destruction Avenue, Qin Feng felt a little regret!

He has awakened this avenue!

In other words, hitting the divine whip will no longer help him awaken a new innate avenue!

However, of the thirty acquired avenues contained in the whip of the gods, twenty-seven were not awakened by him!

This is another huge gain!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng no longer delays, he directly breaks the blood clotting, and flicks the whip to the god...

Pa~! Pa~! Pa~!

Drop by drop of blood essence fell!

Om~!

It wasn't until Qin Feng flicked into twelve drops of blood essence that the divine whip gradually lit up and made a shocking sound!

One is the beginning of the number, nine is the extreme of the number, and twelve is the consummation!

Other treasures only need a drop of blood essence to recognize the master!

It took twelve drops to hit the divine whip, which was even three more drops than the blood essence consumed by the Fengchan Heavenly Monument!

hum~~!

At this moment, the aura of the divine whip is getting more and more dazzling, and it has already brightened the stars in the sky!

Qin Feng felt the throbbing of his soul, and recognized that the master contract was being concluded...

Tiandao also sent a reminder...

„ÄêRecognize the Lord successfully! The **** whip has recognized you as the master! „Äë

...

Om~! Om~! Om~!

At this moment, Qin Feng's body lit up with twenty-seven colors of aura!

He is awakening the twenty-seven avenues of the day after tomorrow, and his momentum has skyrocketed all the way!

Before the awakening of Dao Dao was over, Tian Dao sent another reminder...

[Succeeded in beating the **** whip to recognize the master! You have obtained the blessing of luck in your own universe, the luck value is +20,000 times]

[Succeeded in beating the **** whip to recognize the master! You have obtained the prestige blessing of your own universe, prestige value +200,000 points]

[Succeeded in beating the **** whip to recognize the master! You get the permanent backfeeding of your own cosmic power, combat power + 200 million stars]

[Succeeded in beating the **** whip to recognize the master! You have obtained the method of refining 'God Whip']

[Reminder: The more people who get Dao-level strange objects to recognize their masters, the more the power of the universe will be multiplied.]

Huh~!

The more Dao-level strange objects that recognize the Lord, the more the power of the universe will be multiplied!

Qin Feng's eyes lit up and he was greatly surprised!

That's quite a find!

It was at this moment that the power of the universe came in and began to feed back...

Boom~Long~Long~!

Suddenly, Qin Feng's momentum skyrocketed wildly at the meeting...

The entire Hongyuan universe also trembled slightly, and some subtle changes began to occur!

The eternal powers who were lurking in every corner of the universe were suddenly shocked, and they stared at the universe starry sky one by one!

They sensed that another Dao-level strange object recognized its master!

Why have strange objects been identified frequently recently?

This seems to be a sign of the impending catastrophe!

Every time Dao-level strange things frequently recognize their masters, it is when the great powers of all parties compete for the control of the universe!

A cosmic catastrophe is unavoidable!

Thinking of this, all the Eternal Powers feel uneasy!

At the same time, in the Temple of Supervision, the secret place where the whip is located...

Qin Feng has already accepted the feedback!

At this moment, he slowly opened his eyes, and his eyes were full of joy!

After this feedback, his luck skyrocketed to 740,000 times, and his reputation reached 5.94 million!

What surprised him even more was that his basic combat power soared to 11.2 trillion stars!

This is not a small improvement!

Qin Feng is very satisfied with this!

Having said that, in addition to obtaining the 'God Beating Whip' to recognize the master this time, he also obtained the method of forging the God Whip!

For other powers, this is equivalent to tasteless!

For Qin Feng, it is very useful!

Other great powers do not have their own universe, but Qin Feng has a universe!

With the method of forging, Qin Feng can then forge the divine whip of Qin Yuan Universe.

As long as he can forge the whip, he can create a pagoda and a temple in the Qin Yuan universe!

At that time, he will have the authority to open Qin Yuan Universe's main **** assessment and star master assessment.

The 100,000 Longyuan disciples are all the true gods of Qin Yuan Universe!

If the disciples of Long Yuan want to be promoted to the main **** and star master, they need to continue in the Qin Yuan universe.

Therefore, forging the divine whip of Qin Yuan Universe will be what Qin Feng must do...

"Finally finished! But my combat power is still far from the goal of 13 trillion!"

Qin Feng muttered in his heart, and became a little worried.

He thought about it, if there is still a chance in this Daluo Tianjing, it is the 240 Taiqing Daojing in the Merit Pavilion!

And in the star master assessment, he obtained 357,000 merit points, enough to exchange!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng's eyes lit up, and he seemed to see a glimmer of hope...

Boom~Long~Long~!

But at this moment, his Fortune Jade Plate was also activated...

[Reminder: It has been detected that the number of avenues recorded by your 'Good Fortune Jade Disc' has reached 1218, which meets the advanced requirements and automatically opens the advanced...]

„ÄêAdvanced success! Your Fortune Jade Plate has been promoted from rank 16 to rank 17! „Äë

[Congratulations for getting the assistance of the 17th-order Fortune Jade Plate, your refining efficiency for Daojing has increased to 17%]

[Congratulations on getting the assistance of the 17th-order Fortune Jade Plate, your comprehension efficiency of the avenue scroll is increased by 17%]

[Congratulations on getting the blessing of the 17th-order Fortune Jade Plate, you have once again obtained the power of the Taoist tool, and permanently increased the combat power of 100 million stars! „Äë

Boom~Long~Long~!

As soon as the reminder came out, Qin Feng's momentum began to soar wildly!

He was overjoyed!

Another gain!

After a long time, the promotion is over!

Qin Feng opened his eyes again, his face full of joy.

With the improvement just now, his combat power has skyrocketed to 11.3 trillion stars!

At this time, Tiandao sent another reminder...

[Reminder: The **** whip has been recognized as the master successfully! This secret place will be permanently closed! You are about to be sent out...]

As soon as the prompt comes out, the void vibrates!

An invisible force descended from the sky and enveloped Qin Feng!

huh~!

In the next second, he turned into a white light and was teleported away...

PS: It is the beginning of the month, and the little author is asking readers for the next monthly pass, thank you! .

Chapter 985 Swept away! Innate sorcery!

When the white light dissipated, Qin Feng returned to the Temple of Supervision!

The hall was empty, and he was still the only one.

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, the top of the hall shook.

Qin Feng looked up quickly, and saw the projection of the whip, which was slowly disappearing...

The starry sky above the hall also disappeared simultaneously!

If the whip has been recognized as the master, the secret realm will be permanently closed, and the projection of the whip will naturally disappear.

It didn't take long for the projection to disappear completely, and the top of the main hall returned to the normal roof...

Tiandao also sent a reminder again...

[Reminder: You have completed the Star Master assessment, and it will be sent back to the Hall of the Hall of Fame in 10 seconds, please be prepared~]

it is finally over!

Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief!

As soon as the test is completed, the contestant will be forcibly sent out - the test room!

This is Tiandao's protection for other players!

It would be unfair to harass the players who are being assessed if the players who cleared the game didn't leave.

After thinking about this, Qin Feng just waited for the transmission of heaven...

Swish~!

But at this moment, the white light flashed!

A figure rushed into the hall.

The person here is Caro!

At this moment, Jia Luo looked ecstatic, and his face was full of pride!

He seems to be proud of his own clearance!

When he came in, he saw Qin Feng.

At the moment, the smile on his face faded, and he looked at Qin Feng...

When he saw that Qin Feng was only in the main **** realm, he couldn't help but frown...
