The audience exclaimed!

Gosh!

Seeing this data, the audience was extremely shocked!

Even those who had seen the Yeshi soul power test were shocked.

"My God! Blood can reach level 24! This is already equal to his soul power!"

"Yeah! It's terrifying! Level 24! That's already the mid-level of a true god!"

"This young master Yehi is too powerful!"

"You said, will the blood power of Young Master Yexi exceed his soul power and reach level 25?"

These words just fell, and the field changed suddenly!

Boom~Long~Long~!

Ye Xi's body roared constantly, his skin gradually turned red, his muscles soared, and his blood soared.

Immediately afterwards, his whole body lit up with golden light, and a huge white light and shadow appeared behind him!

Its tall, human-shaped body has six pairs of white wings on its back, but its facial features cannot be seen clearly, only a pair of silver pupils can be seen, slowly opening, exuding monstrous divine might, contemplating the world!

Seeing this scene, someone immediately exclaimed!

"Oh my god! That...that's the top-level divine beast - the bright angel beast!"

"It's still an angel beast with six pairs of wings!"

"It's the bloodline talent! Master Yexi has activated the bloodline talent! The projection of the six pairs of wings of the angel beasts means that his bloodline talent has reached the early stage of S rank!"

"Unbelievable! Incredible! With the blessing of S-rank bloodline talent, Young Master Yexi's blood energy intensity will increase!"Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

really!

Yexi's blood power is stronger than soul power!

The whole place was a sensation!

"My God! Young Master Yehi's blood power is stronger than soul power!"

"Yeah! No wonder he took the initiative to ask for a blood test!"

"This time, Mr. Qin Feng's situation is not good!"

"Yeah! The old man is very suspicious. Lord Qin Feng is good at soul power, so he is fortunate to win Young Master Yexi. But in this blood energy test, it is hard to say!"

The crowd murmured!

Qin Feng was also surprised!

At this moment, he stared closely at the phantom of the angel beast behind Yexi, and countless thoughts emerged in his heart.

This Jehi must be inextricably linked with God!

The angel beast in the mouths of the people is not the angel mentioned on the blue star!

strangeness!

This angelic beast is clearly in human form, why is it called a divine beast by everyone?

Qin Feng was quite puzzled!

Om~!

At this moment, the mutation regenerates!

The phantom of the angel beast behind Yexi gave birth to a pair of wings again, becoming an angel beast with four pairs of wings!

Boom~Long~Long~!

His qi and blood skyrocketed again!

The crowd exclaimed again!

"Oh my god! Four pairs of wings are unfolded! That's a mid-stage S-rank bloodline talent!"

"Yeah! Young Master Yexi's blood power is going to increase again!"

Om~!

The voice just fell, and a golden light lit up on the monument!

"Yeah! Young Master Yexi's blood energy intensity is on par with Qin Feng's soul energy intensity!"

"So this is the strength of Young Master Yexi!"

"Hey! This time, Lord Qin Feng may lose!"

Everyone was muttering constantly, and many people began to worry about Qin Feng.

In the crowd, the woman in the red dress who had always held Qin Feng's heart changed her face slightly and her eyes showed worry.
