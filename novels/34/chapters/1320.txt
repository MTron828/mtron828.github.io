It is estimated that that is also his last chance to obtain additional rewards!

Thinking of this, Brahma entered the Taishi evil fog with a gloomy face under the gaze of the two of them.

It was not until Brahma walked away that the two of Jia Luo recovered and looked at each other again.

"It's really weird! Fellow Daoist Jia Luo, this person is obviously a half-step Great Perfection powerhouse, why is his grades worse than ours every time?"

Bai Zu was full of doubts.

"Yeah! Every time, he is third! It's really confusing!"

Caro was also puzzled.

They didn't know that Brahma was trapped by Qin Feng twice in a row.

The two of them sighed for a while, then walked to the sea of ​​​​fog together, and started the third level assessment.

Time flies!

In the blink of an eye, more than 7 minutes passed.

The fourth level, Taisu Day!

Qin Feng has reached the end of the level!

At this moment, he has spent 14 minutes and 53 seconds!

As long as 7 seconds later, he will not get the double reward!

Fortunately for Qin Feng, he has seen the square at the end and the entrance to Taiyitian, just 300 million miles away!

Just give him 5 seconds and he'll be there!

The hope of winning double rewards is just around the corner!

But in the next second, a sky-reaching troll appeared at the end, just in front of the entrance light gate.

The breath of the realm exudes from his body, and he has suddenly reached the half-step Great Perfection!

Qin Feng was stunned!

At the same moment, the sky-reaching troll also looked at him!

Chapter 972 The Temple of the Superintendent! Supreme!

That Tongtian troll is the leader of the demons in this examination room!

When it saw Qin Feng, it was also stunned!

But in the next second, a look of horror appeared in its eyes.

It turned out that it sensed that Qin Feng's combat power and momentum suddenly exceeded the limit of half-step Great Perfection!

And its combat power is only 7 trillion stars, and it is only the bottom of the half-step Great Perfection!

The strange troll in front of him is much stronger than it!

its not right!

According to Tiandao's arrangement, it is the strongest guardian of this test area!

Why at this moment, there will be a stronger troll than it?

That day, the demon leader couldn't figure it out!

It seems that it should cross-examine one or two, otherwise.

Boom~Long~Long~!

But without waiting for it to think much, there was an earth-shattering roar from the front!

The leader of the demon was startled, he looked up quickly, and saw that Qin Feng was approaching!

At this time, the two sides are only a million feet apart!

That day, the demon leader suddenly became nervous, and he involuntarily made a state of alert.

At the same moment, Qin Feng was extremely anxious!

He has spent 14 minutes and 57 seconds, and he is only 3 seconds away from missing the double reward.

At this moment, the Heavenly Demon in front of him made an alert gesture, do you want to stop him?

As long as the demon blocks a blow, he is afraid that he will be delayed for 2 seconds, and he will miss the reward!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng became more and more nervous.

At the same time, he did not reduce his speed in the slightest, and still rushed towards the entrance at full speed.

In the blink of an eye, the two sides were far apart!

Qin Feng only has 2 seconds left!

"This, you"

It was at this moment that the leader of the demons spit out words and wanted to stop them.

But before it could finish speaking, Qin Feng spoke first!

"This deity is under the imperial order of heaven! Go to Taiyitian! No guardian can stop it!"

Boom~!

As soon as the voice fell, his whole body burst out again!

Taixu, Taichu, Taishi, Taisu, the power of the four great Dao, rose from him to the sky!

The light of the four 20 major Dao!

Layer upon layer, bright and bright!

When the demon leader saw the four-color Daoguang that day, his eyes were horrified!

According to Tiandao's arrangement, all the demons in the Taixutian examination room have mastered the Taixu Dao!

The demon of the early days has mastered the avenues of the early days!

The demon of Taishitian has mastered the Taishi Avenue!

The demon of Taisutian has mastered the Taisu Dao!

Because of this, those guardians of the demons are not suppressed by the fog!

But the demons in different test areas also master the avenues of the five congenital gods!

Like the one in front of him, one person has mastered the four innate and five great Dao, and it is definitely an existence above them.

It is rumored that the 'Superstar Star-Lord' examination area has mastered many kinds of innate five great Daoists in this way!

Could it be that this guy is really a powerhouse sent by Heavenly Dao?

At this moment, the demon leader that day was shocked!

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, Qin Feng was approaching a thousand feet, and he was about to collide in the next second!

"Step aside!"

Qin Feng has roared anxiously!

He really came!

That day, the demon leader panicked, and subconsciously backed away, leaving a vacancy!

Swish~!

With a flash of rainbow light, Qin Feng passed him instantly!

In the blink of an eye, he arrived at the light gate of Tai Yitian's entrance!

That day, the demon leader looked at his back, opened his mouth, and wanted to inquire.

Qin Feng has stepped out one step and got straight into Taiyitian!

At this point, his figure disappeared at the end!

That day, the demon leader stared blankly at the empty door of light, feeling inexplicably missing something.

At the same time, Taiyitian's starting point square.

At the door of light at the entrance, the door of light flashed, and Qin Feng appeared!

When he appeared, he hurriedly picked up the assessment token and looked inside.
