How is this going?

The way of heaven actually counts the two main bodies as independent existences?

Is it...

Suddenly, a flash of light flashed in the fission body's mind, as if he had figured out something, his eyes were surprised.

At the same time, on the outside square, the very yin body also lit up.

The two souls are connected with each other!

At this moment, the very yin body also figured it out, and his face was actually happy.

Obviously, Tiandao counts the two main bodies as two independent individuals.

In other words, Qin Feng came to the competition alone.

Now he is counted as two independent individuals, which equals to two entries.

Can he occupy two of the top ten awards this time?

Thinking of this, the extremely yin body's eyes lit up, and he felt that it was very feasible!

Isn't the scoring token just to calculate the ranking of points!

Heavenly Dao is separated, it doesn't mean that he can monopolize the two major places, which means that the benefits are doubled!

Thinking of this, the very yin body happily put away the token.

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, the mutation in the field regenerated.

In the center of the square, the earthquake suddenly trembled and the roar continued!

Immediately afterwards, three more black **** monuments emerged from the center of the square and slowly rose!

The audience was shocked, and they all followed the sound to look...

In just a moment, the three black **** monuments have completely risen from the ground, and a door of light lights up next to each other!

Om~! Om~! Om~!

Immediately afterwards, lines of golden divine inscriptions were lit up on the three black divine monuments...

The very yin body hurriedly raised his head and looked at one by one...

[Low-grade special secret realm: only those who need to score more than 1 point have permission to enter]

[Middle-grade special secret realm: only those who need to score more than 2 points have permission to enter]REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

[High-grade special secret realm: only those who need to score more than 5 points have permission to enter]

Boom~!

As soon as this information came out, the audience was in an uproar! .

Chapter 806 Taiqing Daojing! Battle of the Hundreds!

"Hey! There is even a special secret realm! What's going on?"

At this moment, there was a lot of discussion in the audience, and they were amazed!

The very negative body is also very surprising!

At this time, all the players knew the sea, and the reminder of the heavenly way sounded again.

[Holy Land Reminder: The special secret realm has been opened! „Äë

[Those whose points reach the corresponding standard can enter the corresponding special secret realm]

[Reminder: In special secret areas, you can get fortune-level treasures and innate Tao crystals]

[Reminder: The number of treasures in special secrets is limited, the number of acquisitions is unlimited, first come first served]

[Reminder: There is a god-king-level devil hidden in each special secret territory, guarding the biggest treasure~]

Boom~!

"My God! Innate Daojing!"

"There are also fortune-telling treasures!"

The whole place was a sensation!

All the quasi-god kings are excited!

Even the nine kings of the gods have their eyes lit up, and they are extremely excited!

The very negative body is also excited!

Whether it's a fortune-telling treasure or an innate Daojing, it's what he wants most.

Up to now, Qin Feng has learned that the highest level of various resources in the False God area, the True God area, and the Main God area has reached the top-grade **** level.

Although the resources at this level have some uses for him, they are of little use.

According to this progress, the resources in the king-level secret realm area are the highest level of god-level, and the number is limited.

The attraction to Qin Feng is also limited!

Only fortune-telling treasures are attractive enough to him!

There is also the Innate Dao, which is the cornerstone of his becoming the master of the universe and the way of heaven!

Now, he has another chance to master the Innate Dao, how can he miss it?

correct!

Tiandao just reminded that there is no limit to the number of resources to collect in special secret realms, everything is on a first-come, first-served basis!

It seems that he has to go in and collect it as soon as possible, so as not to be preempted by other players!

Thinking of this, the extreme yin body looked up at the nine great gods!

These nine people are his opponents!

Especially the Emperor Qing, Emperor Zi, and Emperor Jin in the middle stage of the God King!

He had to take the first step to collect the resources in the special secret territory before the three great emperors noticed it.

After all, his current strength is not necessarily the opponent of the three great emperors.

With this thought, the extreme yin body has a plan in mind!

At the same time, there was a heated discussion in the square.

"Tsk tsk! Fortune-level fetishes and innate dao crystals! Both are peerless treasures!"

"This special secret realm is too tempting!"

"Yeah! However, the difficulty of entering them is too high! It takes more than 1 point to be eligible to enter the special secret realm of the low-grade, and the middle-grade and high-grade are even more exaggerated!"

"That's right! By the way, how many points can you collect in this king-level secret territory?"

These words just fell, and the reminder of Heavenly Dao sounded again in the sea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãconsciousness of everyone.

[Holy Land Reminder: Information about the chance of this ship is now announced]

[By chance in this round, those who enter the top 100 in points can also get some additional rewards]

[For the chance of this round, there is a certain upper limit for the earning of points in each district]

[False God area, up to 20 points; True God area, up to 40 points, Main God area, up to 60 points; King-level area, up to 1 point]

[Those with full points in each district will be forcibly sent out of the secret realm. Those with full quota can go to higher secret areas to get points and resources]

Boom~!

As soon as the news came out, the audience was in an uproar again!

"It turns out that there is an upper limit for the points in each district!"

"That is to say, we quasi-god kings and **** kings can get a maximum of 1 point. If you want to score more, you can only go to the special secret realm!"

"Those players in the lower realm have more choices. After they are full, they can choose other secret realms!"

"How does the old man feel that this round of opportunity is particularly beneficial to those players who can fight beyond the ranks!"

"That's true! Players who can go higher and higher have the most chances to score points. However, there are very few people in this world who can jump through the ranks! It is estimated that in our safe zone, there are no more than three people who can do it!"

"Haha! That's of course! The higher the realm of cultivation, the more difficult it will be! Don't say three, it would be good to have one!"

"Everyone, don't say more! I'll go to the secret territory to earn points!"

"That's right! However, 1 point is not easy to earn!"

"Even if it's not easy to make money, I will have a better chance to enter the special secret realm than the players below the main **** realm. The players below the main **** can get 60 points, it's not bad!"

As soon as these words fell, everyone saw that the nine gods hurried to the secret territory.

Obviously, these nine gods want to earn 1 point quickly, and then go to the special secret realm of the low-level to earn more points and resources!

Fortune-level treasures and Innate Dao Jing are too tempting for them!

What's more, Tiandao has reminded that the resources in special secrets are limited, first come first served!

Seeing this, the quasi-god kings woke up and followed closely!

Time is points!

They need to be quick to earn 1 point so they can go to the special secret realm!

The opportunity is right in front of them, how can they miss it?

In this way, the very yin body silently pays attention to everything without any action.

And with the stimulation of the special secret realm, those **** kings and quasi **** kings are particularly active!

In just a moment, all the god-kings and quasi-god-kings entered the secret realm.

The entire square was empty, with only the very yin body left.

He breathed a sigh of relief and walked towards the special secret realm of the next grade.

I'm afraid no one would have thought that this round of chance only opened for more than ten minutes, and Qin Feng's two main bodies had more than 1 point.

He has to hurry to the low-grade special secret realm and scrape the resources inside!

Thinking of this, the body of the extreme yin was a little excited, and it also accelerated and walked towards the 'special secret realm'

huh~!

At this moment, in the False God area, at the exit of the Secret Realm of Wood, a white light lit up.

The next second, a little cute baby about three or four years old appeared out of thin air.

The very yin body looked back and smiled.

The person who came out was Jumang!

"dad!"

As soon as Jumang saw the body of the extreme yin, he also ran over with joy.

"Little guy, why did you come out?"

"Dad! I got the full 20 points in this secret territory, and I was forcibly sent out by Heavenly Dao!"

Jumang said proudly.

The very yin body also showed a gratified smile.

At this moment, he had expected it.

This little guy's combat power reached 270 million stars, a proper initial strength of the main god.

What's even better is that he can also "incarnate three thousand" like himself, and pursue multiple targets at the same time.

In this way, his efficiency in harvesting points is naturally much stronger than that of the same rank, even Di Jiang can't compare!

Having said that, Di Jiang has mastered time, space and speed talents, and his combat power has reached 300 million stars. The ability to obtain points is also stronger than that of the same level of strength!

After all, space-time and speed abilities are extremely rare talents, and fighting at the same level naturally has an advantage.

"Little guy, go to the True God area! Try to earn points! Tiandao just reminded me that the points are in the top 100, and there are additional rewards!"
