Winter Wonderland

Go back in time, you can only go back a second.

The cooling time is a few minutes.

Therefore, he determined that the angel of the day was absolutely safe!

Yan Tianshen guessed right, Qin Feng's time was reversed, and the cooling time was three minutes.

However, that doesn't mean he has no means.

With this in mind, Qin Feng is about to take another shot.

But at this moment, there was a loud laughter from the gods in front of him!

"Haha! I'm reborn! I'm reborn again! Little thief! Even if you master 'back in time', you can't kill me! Haha!"

Resurrected again, during the day the **** made his eyes red with excitement.

The laughter is so arrogant!

But at this moment, Qin Feng picked up a seal and activated the skill again!

Time Skill - Time Travel!

Om~!

In just a moment, Qin Feng blessed that skill on the angel of the day.

huh~!

During the day, the angel suddenly disappeared out of thin air!

In the next breath, he appeared again!

Click~! Click~! Click~!

But after this appearance, his body disintegrated rapidly, turning into white mist!

In the blink of an eye, he turned into a sky full of white fog, and even the true spirit no longer existed.

In the void, his screams echoed!

"Master! Ah~~~~!"

During the day, the divine envoy turned into nothingness again!

It turned out that Qin Feng made him shuttle back two seconds ago, that is, the moment he was killed, and let him be wiped out again!

Yan Tian Shen Zun and Hei Tian Shen Envoy were completely dumbfounded!

The two looked at Qin Feng in disbelief!

This little thief not only mastered the ability of time, but also mastered the ability of time and space!

It was at this moment that Qin Feng suddenly discovered that the mourning stick of the god's messenger during the day began to crack inch by inch, turning into a sky full of stars and dissipating away.

Could it be that the mourning stick is an artifact of destiny and will disappear with its owner?

Before Qin Feng could think about it, a dazzling golden light flew out from the starlight and poured into his body.

[You successfully killed the angel of the day (the peak of the main god) and obtained +1.25 billion attributes]

[You successfully killed the angel of the day (the peak of the main god) and obtained +13 trillion energy points]

Immediately afterwards, an upgraded white light lit up on him.

…….

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, white light flashed on Qin Feng's body, and his momentum soared.

He was also amazed!

He did not expect that the harvest would come so quickly!

It seems that the angel of the day is dead!

"Little thief! I'm going to kill you~"!"

At this moment, an earth-shattering roar sounded in the field!

Yan Tian Shenzun was completely enraged!

"Black sky! Bring it here!"

The next breath, he spread his palms.

The Dark Angel immediately understood and threw the Soul Locking Chain directly over.

As soon as Yan Tian Shenzun caught the chain, he came to Qin Feng alone.

At the same time, the God of Darkness sat cross-legged and pinched a strange seal in his hand.

Om~!

In the next second, a faint white light lit up on his body!

Vocational Skill - Combat Power Sacrifice!L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Instant start!

Boom~Long~Long~!

In just a split second, the combat power of the Heitian Divine Envoy plummeted by half, leaving only 400 million stars.

And Yan Tian Shenzun's combat power has skyrocketed by 400 million stars to 1.5 billion stars!VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Qin Feng was stunned!

Combat sacrifice!

This Yan Tian Shen Zun can still be used.

The only flaw is that the sacrifice of combat power has been weakened!

Hei Tian's envoy can only sacrifice 50% of his combat power to him!

But even so, Yan Tian Shenzun's combat power has reached 1.5 billion stars, which can definitely crush Qin Feng.

Boom~Long~Long~!

In the blink of an eye, Yan Tian Shenzun held the soul lock chain, carrying the trend of destroying the sky and destroying the earth, and killed him in front of him!

At this moment, his face is ferocious, his eyes are fierce and fierce, and he just wants to smash Qin Feng into scum!

With his 1.5 billion star terrifying combat power!

He is confident he can do it!

Qin Feng naturally did not dare to touch him!

With such a powerful combat power, he is naturally not an opponent, I am afraid that he will not be able to catch a single blow!

It was at this moment that he saw the Heitian divine envoy sitting cross-legged, and his mind suddenly moved, and he was about to teleport over to destroy the Heitian divine envoy first!

As long as the Heitian Envoy is destroyed, the sacrifice of combat power will be broken!

He is also the Supreme Judge of Judgment, so he naturally knows the flaws of 'combat sacrifice'.

"Bah~!"

At this moment, a violent roar of Yan Tian Shen Zun sounded in the field!

The roar that seemed to come from the depths of Jiuyou actually attacked with soul power, and directly slammed into Qin Feng's sea of ​​consciousness in the form of sound waves!

That is exactly the skill of Yan Tianshen Zun - Shocking Sound!

Qin Feng's soul suddenly trembled and was about to collapse!

His teleportation skills were interrupted.

The soul strength of Yan Tian Shenzun is much stronger than that of the black and white gods, and the effect of attacking Qin Feng's soul body is naturally more obvious.

In just a moment, Qin Feng recovered, just to see Yan Tian Shenzun's eyes showing pride.

Obviously, Yan Tian Shenzun guessed that Qin Feng wanted to use teleportation to attack Heitian God Envoy, and he interrupted Qin Feng's teleportation skills in advance.

And once the teleport skill is interrupted, the equivalent skill fails to be used, and the cooldown time will be passed when it is used again.

In other words, Qin Feng is temporarily unable to perform teleportation.

And Yan Tian Shenzun has also been killed!

Swish~!

At that moment, the soul-locking chain in his hand slammed towards Qin Feng!

Woo~! Woo~! Woo~!

The iron chain was drawn, and it made a whimper like a ghost crying and wolf howling!

Click~! Click~! Click~!

Wherever it passed, the void was shattered, the heaven and earth collapsed, and the momentum was extremely terrifying!

This is Yan Tian Shenzun's full blow!

He is confident that this blow will definitely blow Qin Feng up on the spot!

Swish~!

But at this critical moment, a black light flashed in front of Qin Feng!

A corpse puppet with a height of ten thousand feet and a green light in its eyes suddenly appeared.

That is Qin Feng's corpse puppet - the ancient **** of burning the lamp!

Boom~!

As soon as the ancient **** of burning lamp appeared, the corpse energy in the whole body exploded in an instant, and the momentum was connected to the sky, suddenly reaching 1 billion stars, and actively resisted the attack of the iron chain!

Yan Tian Shenzun was stunned at first!

He didn't expect that Qin Feng still had such a powerful corpse puppet!

But then, he was disdainful!

The corpse puppet with 1 billion star combat power could not resist his attack!

Since Qin Feng released this corpse puppet to resist, then he will blow up this corpse puppet first!

Thinking of this, he slammed into the corpse puppet fiercely!

But at this moment, the mutation regenerates!

Qin Feng's teleport cooldown is not over yet, but he still has other space skills!

I saw him move towards the Heitian Divine Envoy, grabbing the void!

Heaven and Earth move!

huh~!

White light flashes!

In just a split second, the Heitian divine envoy was moved to Qin Feng.

The black angel was suddenly stunned!

But without waiting for him to think about it, Qin Feng just slapped it down!

Bang~!

A loud bang!
