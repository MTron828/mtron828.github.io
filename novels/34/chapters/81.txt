He was able to have such a big harvest because the people in 911 Village were very supportive of him.

Some people exchanged the first-order spirit grass for his ten kilograms of dried meat, which was obviously a loss.

Of course, those people also traded it because they didn't have the Eye of True Sight and didn't know whether the spirit grass was poisonous or not.

Another important reason is that the resources of 911 Village have doubled and become extremely rich.

Although it can't be said that there are spiritual grass everywhere, as long as you look for it carefully, you will gain something.

In this way, the spirit grass becomes less precious.

Of course, this is just an illusion.

Lingcao resources are still extremely precious.

After he becomes the village chief, various life occupations such as pharmacists and blacksmiths will be opened up.

At that time, all kinds of spiritual grass, spiritual fruit, and ore resources will shine.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng is even more looking forward to becoming the village chief.

Becoming the village chief is an important step for him to become stronger, and it is also a key step for making 911 Village stronger.

He even thought about turning 911 Village into a divine realm.

By the way, the 260 points of attributes won have not been added to this win!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng opened the panel and started adding points.

[Attribute addition is complete! Your Strength Index increases by 65 points! 】

[Attribute addition is complete! Your Agility Index increases by 65 points! 】

[Attribute addition is complete! Your BMI increases by 65 points! 】

[Attribute addition is complete! Your energy index increases by 65 points! 】

In just a moment, all 260 attributes have been added...

Majestic energy flows throughout the body.

Qin Feng closed his eyes involuntarily.

He liked the feeling of getting stronger.

It's fantastic!

The next second, the latest data appeared in his mind.

[Occupation]: Level 2 Judge (0/200)

[Reputation]: 52 (novice king)

[Strength]: 463+83 (the true meaning of power, C level)

[Agility]: 461+15 (speed madness, D level)

[Physical constitution]: 462+20 (strengthened constitution, D grade)

[Skills]: Eye of True Sight (Tier 1), Hellfire (Tier 2), Mysterious Crystal Armoring (Tier 2), Outward Energy (Tier 3), Beast Control (Tier 3)

[Combat evaluation]: 47 stars

After a while, Qin Feng opened his eyes with joy.

good! good!

His combat power has reached 47 stars.

The combat power of the Heaven Punisher is more than 100 stars, and the probability is 100 stars.

Qin Feng speculates that when his combat power increases to more than 90 stars, he may have a chance to fight the punisher.

After all, he has many talents, which makes his real strength stronger than the star rating of combat power assessment.

And the Heavenly Punisher arranged by Heavenly Dao for Novice Village should not be too abnormal in talent.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After all, it's just a novice stage at the moment.

Of course, these are just his speculations.

"I don't think so much. Even if I level up with all my strength, I may not be able to raise my combat power to 70 stars, let alone 90 stars, before the end of the novice assessment. If I want to defeat Heaven Punishment, I have some extravagant hopes. !"

Qin Feng muttered in his heart.

He has to quickly find a way to improve his strength.

By the way, equipment can also improve strength!

He still has two golden treasure chests unopened!

[Reminder: Chekovsky from village 575 exchanged the treasure chest synthesis card (tier 2) for your Bear King armor (tier 2). 】

0

what!

Qin Feng's eyes lit up.

Come to whatever you want!

Finally got a synthetic card!

good! good!

He was overjoyed, and quickly opened the trading channel and took out the treasure chest synthesis card.

After a while, he used the synthetic card to synthesize five silver treasure chests into a gold treasure chest.

So far, he has three golden treasure chests in his hand.

"How cool!"

Qin Feng looked at the three golden treasure chests in front of him, and his heart was very comfortable.

When he opens these three treasure chests, he can get three items above the fourth rank.

His equipment can be updated again, and his strength has skyrocketed.

In addition, there are three silver treasure chests in his hand.

Keep these, and when you collect all five, you can get a golden treasure chest.

Now, he has some disdain for the silver treasure chest.

Now it's time to open the treasure chest!

Qin Feng took out the first golden treasure chest and slowly opened it...

Om~!

The treasure chest lit up with a dazzling golden light!

【The golden treasure chest has been opened successfully! Get the fourth-order item - Fengshen boots! 】

[Aeolus Boots: Agility +100, Defense +50, Movement Speed ​​+100%, Fire Resistance +100%, Water Resistance +100%. 】

wow!

These Fengshen boots are much stronger than his second-order shadow boots!

[Shadow Boots: Agility +15, Defense +5, Movement Speed ​​+50%. 】

Such a comparison shows the power of Fengshen boots.

good! good!

Qin Feng is very satisfied.

continue! continue!

There are still two golden treasure chests unopened!

Om~!

The light is on!

[Phantom Necklace: Energy +100, contains the skill - Phantom Clone. 】

[Phantom clone: ​​Tier 3 skills, consume a certain amount of energy, condense a phantom clone, and fight for yourself. Remarks: The strength of the clone is only half of the main body. 】

[Reminder: The phantom clone skill requires the talent of six senses (C-level) to be used. 】

what!

Fuck it~!

This phantom necklace actually has its own skills!

This is definitely the best in Tier 4!

Earned!

Earned this time!

Qin Feng was very happy.

Then he put on the necklace.

There was a burst of energy from the necklace, which merged with his breath, causing his energy to skyrocket.

At the same time, there was also a new skill in the skill bar - Phantom Clone.

The strength has increased a lot!

cool~!

Immediately afterwards, he opened the last golden treasure chest.

Om~!

【The golden treasure chest has been opened successfully! Get the fifth-order item - Huo Luan Battle Pet Egg! 】

[Huoluan Battle Pet Egg: It can hatch an Earth-level battle pet—Huoluan. 】

[Huo Luan: Legend has it that it has the bloodline of the sacred beast Suzaku, and its strength is unparalleled. 】

[Earth-level combat power: The combat power below 100 stars is human-level combat power; above 100 stars is ground-level combat power, and above 1,000 stars is heaven-level combat power. 】

Ha ha!

It's really tier five!

2% probability to open the fifth order.

He actually ran into it again.

Qin Feng is very happy

There is also an introduction to the strength of the pet.
