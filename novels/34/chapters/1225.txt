Thinking of this, Qin Feng waved his hand again, a white light flashed in front of him, and Feng Xi appeared out of thin air.

I saw Feng Xi's graceful and graceful appearance as always, and she was extremely beautiful, but her eyebrows were a little tired!

"Master~"!"

When Feng Xi saw Qin Feng, she was overjoyed and then embarrassed.

At this moment, her pretty face was slightly red, but her beautiful eyes were full of tenderness and a little shyness.

Qin Feng looked at her slightly tired expression and felt a little distressed.

Before, in order to break the curse, he spent thirty hours in one go.

"Xi'er, I've suffered you this time!"

Qin Feng's eyes are soft and his heart is full of emotion.

"Master, it's my honor to be able to help you."

Feng Xi said a little shyly, but she was extremely happy in her heart.

Now, the master's name for her has been changed to "Xi'er", and the relationship between the two is even closer.

"Are you okay? You look tired."

Qin Feng looked at her with a distressed expression.

Feng Xi's heart warmed: "Master, the concubine is just a little tired, as long as you take a rest for a while, you can recover, there is no serious problem!"

"That's good!"

Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief.

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, the sky above the square shook!

The voice of heaven resounded

[Congratulations to the contestant Feng Xi for stepping on the finish line and winning the third place in this round! 10,000 Reputation Points awarded! „Äë

[It is detected that the player has a Holy Land score of 67 points, and can enter the Jiutian Zhen Temple in exchange for the corresponding resources! „Äë

[Reminder: Only players below the True God Realm can enter the Nine Heavens True Temple with a token! „Äë

As the prompt sounded, a beam of prestige reward light fell on Feng Xi.

"Hey! Master! We have reached the final point!"

Feng Xi is full of surprises!

It was only now that she realized that she had reached the end, and the surrounding scene had already changed drastically.

In fact, it's not her fault!Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

All her eyes were on Qin Feng, and she didn't take everything around her at all, so she realized it later.

Qin Feng smiled and waved again, white light flashed in the field

Di Jiang, Jumang, Xiao Luan'er, Yu Xuanji, Qiyue, Zhu Rong, Gonggong, Qingchengzi, Ming He, and Ran Deng appeared in turn!

The reminders of Tiandao also came in sequence, and the ranking was also determined in sequence.

Di Jiang won the fourth place! Jumang fifth!

Xiaoluan'er sixth! Yu Xuanji seventh!

Qiyue eighth! I wish Rong the ninth!

Work tenth! Qingchengzi eleventh!

Styx Twelfth! Burn the thirteenth!

The top thirteen of this round of luck were all taken over by Qin Feng and his party!

Di Jiang and others were overjoyed!

However, starting from fourth place, there is no prestige reward.

In this regard, Di Jiang and others have been extremely satisfied!

"Wow! Dad, we've reached the end!"

"It seems that we are the only group, and no one else is here!"

"Master, you won the first and second place this time, right?"

At this moment, all the subordinates asked excitedly.

Qin Feng nodded with a smile.

"Right! Dad, the rankings are all out. When will Tiandao issue ranking rewards?"

At this time, Xiao Luan'er asked expectantly.

The little girl couldn't wait.

Qin Feng said with a smile: "This ranking reward will not be issued until the current round of opportunities is over. Before that, we still have the opportunity of 'Nine Heavens True God Realm', and we have to get it!"

"Yes!" Xiao Luan patted his head.

With this reminder, she remembered this great opportunity!

Going to the Nine Heavens True Shrine will allow them to be promoted to the True God Realm, which will greatly help them improve their strength!

Thinking of this, she couldn't wait to ask: "Dad, where is the Nine Heavens Temple?"

Qin Feng smiled and raised his head: "Look at the other end of the square, that is the land of the gods. The Nine Heavens Temple is in the depths of the land of the gods. With the order of the true gods, you can get route guidance and find the temple!"

Xiao Luan'er was overjoyed: "Wow! It's so simple! Dad, when are we going to Jiutian Zhen Temple?"

Qin Feng replied: "." Naturally, the sooner the better! There is still more than half a day, and the Holy Land opportunity will end, and we will be forcibly passed out of the Holy Land. Therefore, we must be promoted to the True God Realm in the remaining time. !"

Having said that, as soon as he waved his hand, the seven True God Orders flew to Di Jiang, Jumang, Xiaoluan'er, Fengxi, Yu Xuanji, Qiyue, and Qingchengzi respectively.

As for Zhu Rong, Gong Gong, Ming He, and Ran Deng, they have already reached the realm of true gods. Naturally, there is no need to go to the Nine Heavens Temple.

Everyone was overjoyed when they got the token!

Qin Feng also breathed a sigh of relief: "Okay! The token has been issued to you! You guys should go to the Nine Heavens Temple first!"

Xiao Luan'er was surprised: "Dad, won't you go with us?"

Qin Feng smiled: "I have to deal with some trivial matters, and then I will arrive! After all, time is precious, you all go first, and I can arrive at any time through the space call!"

"Oh~!"

Xiao Luan'er suddenly realized.

Being reminded by this, everyone suddenly felt a sense of urgency, for fear of delaying major events.

"Dad (Master)! Then let's go first!"

"Well! You go!"

Immediately, Xiao Luan'er, Feng Xi and the others said their goodbyes and prepared to go to the land of the gods.

"Hey! Dad, this is the younger brother of Zhu Ronghe Gonggong!"

At this time, Xiao Luan'er suddenly noticed the two little guys.

"It's so good! We have two more brothers!"

Di Jiang and Jumang ran over curiously and touched the heads of the two little guys.

Zhu Rong and Gonggong kept their eyes wide open, watching all this curiously.

These two little guys are still a little ignorant!

However, they could see that the older brothers and sisters seemed to like them.

Qin Feng smiled: "Time is precious now, hurry up! When you have time in the future, you can play together again!"

"Oh!"

"Dad! Let's go!"

At the moment, the group said their goodbyes and left.

After a while, Qin Feng, Zhu Rong, Gonggong, Ming He, and Lantern were left in the field.

"Dad! Where are the brothers and sisters going to play?"

At this moment, Zhu Rong looked at the backs of Xiao Luan'er and others, and wanted to go with him.

Qin Feng fondly touched his little head.

"Brothers and sisters are going to break through the realm, not to play! Little guy, you can retreat in this square with Gonggong!"

"Oh!"

Zhu Rong and Gong Gong all nodded obediently.

Then, Qin Feng looked at Ming He and Ran Deng again.

"This square is a safe area. The two of you are also retreating here. Wait for this opportunity to end! Remember, take care of these two little guys!"

"Yes! Master!"

"This subordinate understands soft!"

Styx and Burning Lanterns have taken the lead!

After instructing all this, Qin Feng dodged and disappeared out of thin air.

There was only one golden light spot the size of a soybean in the field, and that was the space node of the universe.

He has returned to the center of his universe to search for treasures and resources in Lingxiao Temple.

PS: It's the beginning of the month, and the little author asks all readers for a monthly ticket. Thank you in advance! ! ! .

The nine hundred and fifteenth chapter is the ninth level of conferring gods! Dao-level chance!

In the next second, Qin Feng will appear at the center of his universe!

He looked up and saw a continent hanging above the sky in front of him.

That is exactly the continent that the Nine Heavens Restoration Earth has transformed into!

The Lingxiao Temple is on it!

Qin Feng couldn't help but look forward to the ground!

He was very curious, what resources are there in the temple?

However, he did not rush over immediately, but when his mind moved, a mind body appeared in front of him.

Immediately afterwards, with a wave of his hand, the three divine armors flew towards the mind body.

Those three **** armors are the ten-transformation **** armor, the fire **** armor, and the water **** armor!

Now, Qin Feng has awakened the avenue of water and fire, and can condense the armor of the gods!

After the mind body got the three armors, he turned and left.

Qin Feng thought again, and the four mind bodies appeared again.

He also handed over the Heaven Slaughtering Sword, Jue Heaven Sword, Trapping Heaven Sword, Heaven Slaughtering Sword, and four Chaos Qi to those four mind bodies!

After the four mind bodies were obtained, they all left.

At this time, Qin Feng turned his palm over, and there was another golden booklet in his hand - "The Art of Cutting Three Corpses"

[Three Corpse Cuts: God King Great Perfection cultivates this secret technique, which can cut out evil corpses, good corpses, and corpses! „Äë

[Cut out a corpse, that is quasi-half-step eternity! „Äë

[Cut out two corpses, which is half-step Eternal Realm! „Äë

[Cut out three corpses, that is the eternal realm! „Äë

Seeing this, Qin Feng felt emotional!

Yaotai Xuannv has cut out two corpses, but the good corpse among them was not cut enough.

In other words, Yaotai Xuannv is only half a step away from the Eternal Realm.
