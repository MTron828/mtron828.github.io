Winter Wonderland
0.00 / 0.00

It turns out that there are spirit flowers, spirit grasses, and spirit fruits everywhere in this canyon, ranging from high-grade gods to top-grade gods, and it is several times richer than the Valley of Ten Thousand Demons!

In other words, this canyon is a huge treasure trove of resources!

Soon, Qin Feng took back his consciousness and walked forward...

He only took a few steps when he saw a strange blue flower in front of him, which exuded a strange fragrance...

That is a supreme god-level spiritual flower!

Sure enough!

There are so many resources here!

Qin Feng verified the previous detection and was about to use Lingzhi to devour...

roar~!

But at this moment, a roar resembling a man and a beast suddenly came from the front!

Boom~!

Immediately afterwards, a white fog rolled sharply!

From the side of the spirit flower, a translucent humanoid monster suddenly rushed out. Its whole body was composed of white mist, and it lay in front of the spirit flower.

Looking at the aura emanating from his body, he suddenly reached the early stage of the God King!

"Huh! 19 This is..."

Qin Feng was a little surprised, and could not help but spy on him...

[Evil Object]: Canyon Demon

[Boundary]: The initial stage of the God King

[Characteristics]: Guardian of the canyon, resisting the detection of consciousness, space teleportation

[Special Ability]: Absolutely invisible, half-step eternity is also difficult to detect

"I see!"

Qin Feng was stunned.

No wonder, he hadn't spied on it before!

It turns out that this demon can resist the detection of consciousness!

Not only that, it also has a more terrifying ability, that is, absolute stealth!

Om~!

Only when this thought came to mind, a faint white light lit up on the canyon demon.

In the next second, it disappeared out of thin air in front of Qin Feng's eyes at a speed visible to the naked eye, leaving no trace of breath, as if it had never appeared.

That is the absolute stealth of the devil!

Qin Feng couldn't help frowning!

This is definitely not a good thing!

Just as he frowned, the demon hidden in the dark was also quietly looking at him.

After so many years, it finally saw humans again!

It's just that this human is too weak!

How is the False God Realm?

There is some disdain in the eyes of the devil!UpdùíÇted chapters ùíên nùíêvelbin(.)com

It has absolute stealth, and it is best at sneak attack in dense fog, often winning the weak with the weak!

Even, it once attacked and killed a human being in the middle stage of the god-king.

Having said that, this human is the first person to step into this canyon this year, which shows that he is lucky!

Too bad his luck ends here!

He should never have entered this western canyon.

The demons in this valley are all extremely powerful, from the initial stage of the **** king to the great perfection of the **** king, and they can be absolutely invisible.

Since the appearance of the Holy Land, there has never been a human being able to break through this canyon.

Not to mention this human being!

It's just an ant in the False God realm, it will kill it now!

Thinking of this, the demon moved silently behind Qin Feng.

It has always been cautious, even in the face of ants in the False God realm, it has to use sneak attacks from behind.

As soon as it gets behind Qin Feng, it will shoot.

But at this moment, Qin Feng suddenly turned his head and looked at it with a smile!

The demon was stunned for a moment!

Can this human see himself?

It shouldn't be!

The demon hurriedly took two steps to the left!

Everything is silent, there is no movement around!

But Qin Feng's eyes moved to the left following it.

The demon hurriedly took a few steps to the right.

Qin Feng's eyes also moved to the right with it.

The devil was suddenly stunned!

Its absolute stealth invalidated?

That absolute invisibility is the ability bestowed upon them by Heaven, and even half a step of eternity will not be able to discover it!

How could the ants in the False God realm see it?

It did not find that Qin Feng had a smile on his lips, and there was a golden light hidden in the depths of his eyes.

It turns out that Qin Feng can't see through "absolute stealth", but as the master of ultimate destiny, he can see where all the luck lies.

Just now, he was pleasantly surprised to discover that this demon actually carried aura of luck and exuded aura of luck.

Therefore, he can see a group of human-shaped white light of luck, moving to the left at one time and moving to the right at another time.

This is completely different from the monsters outside the canyon!

When he beheaded the demon kings such as Feng Xi, Kui Lang, and Qian Qian, there was no luck in them.

Only when you kill Chenghuang, Dixun and other god-level players can you get some luck.

This makes his luck value increase very slowly.

Now, he has a new chance of luck!

The demons in this canyon have their own luck.

Looking at the brightness of luck, it seems that it is not low!

In other words, the demons at the entrance to the west are not only powerful, but they can also stealthily attack, which is extremely dangerous!

But for Qin Feng, this is a big opportunity!

What's even better is that the absolute stealth that makes all living beings fear was also subtly broken by him!

After all, few people in this world can obtain the title of "Lord of Ultimate Destiny", even half a step into eternity.

In a word, Qin Feng's luck is here!

This thought made his heart burst into flames!

At the same time, the demon had changed more than a dozen positions in a row, but he couldn't get rid of Qin Feng's gaze.

It was finally in a hurry and slaughtered directly at Qin Feng!

Qin Feng flicked his index finger, and a burst of energy shot out, hitting its chest directly!

Bang~!

A muffled sound!

The body of the demon shattered and turned into a white mist that filled the sky, and it was too late to even let out a scream!

With just one finger, Qin Feng will kill it!

huh~!

Immediately afterwards, a white light flew out of the white fog and entered Qin Feng's body...

[You killed a canyon demon (early stage of God King), and obtained +5710 trillion energy points]

[You killed a canyon demon (early stage of God King), and obtained +21,000 gold judgment points]

[You killed a canyon demon (early stage of the **** king), and a clearance **** card exploded]

[Reminder: 1 clearance card can increase the clearance reward of your current chance by 5%]

Huh~! Clear the God Card!

Qin Feng's eyes lit up and he quickly looked forward.

Sure enough, there was a silver **** card suspended there, with a strange **** pattern engraved on it.

This clearance card is kind of interesting!

One can increase the reward by 5%!

If you get 20 cards, it does not mean that the chance has increased by 1%, which is directly doubled.

As soon as Qin Feng waved his hand, he sucked the Shenka into his hand.

After observing it for a while, he was satisfied with the storage ring.

Afterwards, he pinched the seal and launched the devouring of luck...

[Luck swallowed successfully! You devoured all the luck of the canyon demon, the luck value +1 times]

1x luck!

It is equivalent to allowing him to improve the basic combat power of 100 million stars!

This is the invisible increase of strength!

Qin Feng is very satisfied!

Afterwards, he pressed the seal again and activated the spiritual plant to devour...

Boom~!

In just an instant, his devouring power covered the 300 million miles ahead.

But it didn't end, he thought again!

Om~!

In just an instant, his swallowing range expanded from 300 million miles to 600 million miles!

That is the new supernatural power he awakened from the 'Boundless Avenue' - the boundless avenue!

The road is boundless, which can double the range of all magical skills, such as the teleport distance can also be doubled.

This supernatural power and spiritual plant devouring and superimposing are infinitely useful!

After a while, Qin Feng devoured the spiritual plants that were thousands of miles wide and 600 million miles long!

After a while, he skyrocketed 3.1 billion star combat power, and his basic combat power reached 148 billion stars!

The resources in this canyon are indeed extremely rich!

"I don't know how long this canyon is? At least 600 million miles ahead, I don't need to stay any longer! The spiritual plants have been swallowed up by me!"

Qin Feng smiled with satisfaction and was about to set off!

"Hey! This is..."
