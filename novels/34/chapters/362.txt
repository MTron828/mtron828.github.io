Om~!

With a whistle of heaven and earth!

A beam of light descended from the sky and landed on Qin Feng's head...

His attribute points suddenly skyrocketed all the way...

At the same moment, all the people in Longyuan Town also received this information, and immediately gave out earth-shattering cheers.

At the same time, they were also extremely shocked.

The boss actually defeated the beast **** of the fourth level of heaven!

OMG!

If it weren't for the information from Heaven, they would not believe it.

Previously, they only hoped that Qin Feng would return safely, and did not expect the task to be completed at all.

But Qin Feng's every shot is beyond their expectations!

This time, Qin Feng actually completed the perverted B-level mission!

Such a strong contrast!

Make everyone happy!

Suddenly, the entire Longyuan Town boiled up!

At the same time, the Totem Temple, the ninth floor.

Qin Feng was also happy.

Just now, he received 10,000 attribute rewards.

That was his personal bonus.

Ten thousand attributes!

If this is to be added, the combat power will definitely skyrocket.

At this thought, Qin Feng was full of expectations.

However, he has to clear the battlefield first, deal with these trivial matters, and then add some more.

Thinking of this, he walked over to the body of the beast **** and began to collect the spoils.

After a while, he got the ninth-order beast **** seal, three groups of middle-grade **** beast blood, a purple diamond treasure chest, a beast **** core, and a storage ring.

Picking up the storage ring, Qin Feng glanced at it a little, and then showed joy again.

It turned out that in the storage ring, there was also a ball of mid-grade Qilin blood essence, as well as various rare resources, and some miscellaneous notes.

Qin Feng didn't have time to take a closer look.

All of this can only be slowly looked at after he has dealt with trivial matters.

Immediately, he began to extract the body of the beast god...

„ÄêEndless extraction success! You have acquired the seventh-order skill‚Äîspirit creation. „Äë

[Spiritual creation technique: Use animal souls to create all kinds of guardian spirits, you need to awaken the seventh sense in order to fully master it. „Äë

This skill is very useful!

Qin Feng is very satisfied.

However, he has not awakened the seventh sense and cannot fully grasp it.

Another skill that requires the seventh sense.

Judging from all the circumstances, he must complete the foundation building of the gods as soon as possible.

Otherwise, his growth in all aspects will always be stuck on the seventh sense.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng couldn't wait even more for the foundation building.

He then continued to extract‚Ä¶

„ÄêEndless extraction success! You have obtained a mass of True Dragon Blood Essence (Top Grade). „Äë

[Real Dragon Blood Essence (High Grade): A ninth-order item, the high-quality True Dragon Blood Essence contains an incomparably huge real dragon power and can be refined. „Äë

[Reminder: Only those with the talent of true dragon blood can refine the blood of true dragon. Or use the totem technique to temporarily stimulate the power of the true dragon. „Äë

[Reminder: The high-quality real dragon blood essence not only contains an incomparably huge real dragon power, but also contains an extremely huge dragon soul power. „Äë

[Refining this thing requires the strength of the soul body to reach the heaven level, otherwise it will not be able to withstand the impact of the power of the dragon soul. „Äë

Qin Feng looked at the blood of the real dragon floating in front of him in surprise.

I saw that its whole body was bright red, like crystal jade, with its own aura, and it also contained the supreme dragon power.

This is the top-grade real dragon blood essence!

It belongs to the ninth-order item, and its value is inestimable.

The only pity is that he can't refine it yet.

Because after the blood essence of the beast reaches the middle grade or above, it contains the power of the soul, and there is a requirement for the strength of the soul body.

For example, refining the high-grade dragon blood in front of you requires the strength of the soul to reach the heaven level.

"It seems that I can't do it if I don't go to the foundation!"

Qin Feng smiled and muttered.

As long as he completes the foundation of the gods, the strength of his soul body will be comparable to that of heaven, and he will be able to refine the dragon's blood of the highest grade.

In addition, if he wants to refine the beast **** seal, he needs to awaken the seventh sense, which also needs to complete the foundation.

It can be seen that the completion of foundation building has become an urgent matter.

"It's finally done!"

Qin Feng glanced at the corpse of the beast **** and released the psychic fusion.

Guji~! Guji~!

As soon as Xiao Luan'er appeared, she saw the corpse on the ground and cried out excitedly.

"Dad! Daddy! We killed the beast god!"

"Owner!"

At this time, Qi Yue also came over excitedly.

Qin Feng turned his head to look and found that Qiyue was different from before.

She has grown a lot taller, her body has become more slender, her temperament has become more youthful and beautiful, and she has become more and more attractive as a stunning girl, which is eye-catching.

This is the result of Qiyue refining the Qilin blood essence and greatly improving her strength.

He couldn't help but spy on the little girl...

[Servant]: Qiyue (Dark Messenger)

[Level]: Level 16

„ÄêBoundary„Äë: Human level

[Talent]: Time Manipulation (Level A), Law of Darkness (Level A), Mystery of Wood (Level B)

[Blood Talent]: B Grade (Kirin)

[Combat Strength Evaluation]: 740 stars

very good!

The little girl is still at the human level, and her combat power has reached 740 stars.

This time, when he goes to build the foundation, the little girl can also go to build the foundation.T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com

Qin Feng showed a look of relief.

Compared with the Alienation Judge, the messengers of light and darkness under his seat are much better.

"Master, the beast **** is dead, our mission is complete. You can submit the mission items."

Qi Yue reminded with a smile.

As long as you submit quest items, you can get B-level quest rewards.

This is good for the whole town!

Qin Feng smiled slightly: "No hurry! By the way, how long will it be outside before dawn?"

Qi Yue hurriedly said: "It is estimated that it will take about an hour and a half."

Qin Feng nodded slightly: "An hour and a half, it's too late. You and Xiao Luan'er will go back to the Cangzu headquarters first, and gather everyone in Longyuan Town there."

"Master, what are you doing with everyone?"

"Before daybreak, capture the site of the Qi clan! Once the day dawns, and the head of the clan has not returned, the people of the clan will definitely doubt it. At that time, they will contact their guardian forces for help, which will be a little troublesome."

With Qin Feng's current strength, he is naturally not afraid of other guardian forces.

However, he wants to go to the Vientiane Temple next to complete the sacred martial arts assessment.

That's what he needs to accomplish the most!

Before that, he didn't want to have a war with the major guard forces, so as not to delay the assessment.

"Master, I understand!"

Qiyue obediently agreed.

At the moment, Qin Feng put Qiyue, Xiaohuoluan, and the four avatars into the zero-degree space.

After a few people entered the space, they took the teleportation array in the space and went to the Cangzu headquarters to begin to complete Qin Feng's layout.

At the same time, inside the temple.

Qin Feng casually released a ball of golden flames, turning the body of the beast **** into powder.

After doing this, he started adding points to himself.

Soon, after adding 10,000 attributes, his combat power skyrocketed to 4630 stars, and his strength skyrocketed again.

Qin Feng was very satisfied, and with a flash, he rushed to the tenth floor...

The tenth floor is the beast god's lair, and maybe there are treasures, he has to search...

At the same moment, the Seven Killing Valley, another exit, was brightly lit.

At the mouth of the valley, there are more than 20,000 children of the sect.

The Qi clan is different from the Cang clan.

The Qi Clan has only one site, and the population is concentrated together, with a total of more than 27,000 people, nearly twice that of the Cang Clan.

The number of clan-level powerhouses is also nearly seventy.

The reason why the population of the Cang clan is scattered is nothing more than the stronghold of the Cang clan headquarters. The lack of resources around it cannot meet the needs of so many people.

Therefore, the site level of the Cang Clan headquarters is only the worst low-level site.

And the clan is different.

Their site is connected to the Valley of Seven Killings at one end and the Vast Sea Forest at the other end. The surrounding resources are extremely rich and belong to a medium-quality site.

Iron ore, stone, wood, and hunting grounds for beasts of all levels.

This kind of resource advantage, even Tayue Town can't compare at all.

In fact, such sites with rich surrounding resources are rare in this big world, and are generally occupied by powerful guardian forces.

A relatively weak guardian force like the Cang Clan is not qualified to occupy it.

In a word, among the seven major guardian forces in this area, the Qi clan is considered to be of low-medium strength, barely qualified to occupy a medium-sized site.

At this time, at the entrance of the Valley of Seven Kills.

All the disciples of the Qi clan were waiting anxiously.

Patriarch Cockroach entered the valley almost overnight.

No news yet, and I don't know what's going on?
