As soon as he thought of Dijiang, the fission body moved and disappeared out of thin air.

The next second, he appeared in another secret room.

In the center of the secret room, a black spirit egg was suspended in mid-air, exuding a dazzling aura, constantly flashing, and it seemed very active!

That is the Dijiang Spirit Egg!

Qin Feng could sense that Di Jiang was born soon, so the spirit eggs became active.

Beside the spirit egg, Qiyue and Jumang looked at the spirit egg eagerly, their eyes filled with anticipation.

It turned out that Qiyue and Jumang had already finished refining the medicine pill.

The two of them had nothing to do, so they came to the secret room to watch the Dijiang Spirit Egg.

When Qin Feng appeared, two people, one big and one small, immediately noticed.

"Owner!"

When Qiyue saw Qin Feng, her eyes were filled with joy.ViiSiit nùíêvelbùíä/n(.)c/(ùíê)m for lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvels

"Dad! Daddy!"

Xiaojumang ran over happily and hugged Qin Feng's thigh.

Looking at Xiaojumang's speech, it seems to be a little more agile than before.

"brat!"

Qin Feng fondly touched the little guy's head and looked at the little guy.

He looked at him with joy in his eyes.

I saw that Xiaojumang has changed from a baby girl around two years old to a cute baby around three or four years old, and her skin has become more delicate and whiter.

He looked more closely, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the little guy was already level 60, which was obviously the result of eating a lot of energy pills.

Looking at the little guy's combat power, it has reached an astonishing 2 million stars.

This makes Qin Feng very pleased!

2 million star combat power!

You can give him 1.4 million star combat power back.

And Qin Feng's current comprehensive combat power is 16.4 million stars, plus the feedback of this 1.4 million stars, it is 17.8 million star combat power.

"Dad! Dad! I broke through to level 60!"

Jumang raised his face happily, waiting for praise.

Qin Feng smiled: "The little guy did a good job!"

"Master, this Emperor Jiang seems to be born soon!"

At this time, Qi Yue also said happily.

"I sense it!"

Qin Feng smiled and walked towards the egg

When he walked to the spirit egg, he looked at Qiyue and showed a gratified smile again.

I saw that Qiyue had also risen to level 60.

Obviously, the little girl also ate a lot of energy pills.

She and Jumang did this also in order not to be in the rank and hold Qin Feng back.

Of course, Qiyue's rise is not just in grades.

Her combat power has also skyrocketed to 1 million stars, which can give Qin Feng back 700,000 star combat power.

In this calculation, Qin Feng's comprehensive combat power can reach 18.5 million stars.

This is getting closer and closer to the threshold of the middle stage of True God.

The mid-term threshold of True God is 20 million star combat power.

And the comprehensive strength of the ancestors of reincarnation and the old ancestors of the years is more than 20 million stars

"Dad! Dad! When was Di Jiang's brother born?!"

At this time, Xiaojumang grabbed Qin Feng's trouser legs and asked expectantly.

He really hopes to have a younger brother who is about his age to play with him.

Of course, if it wasn't for Xiao Luan's retreat, he wouldn't feel so bored.

Having said that, Xiao Luan'er and Feng Xi have more medicinal pills to refine than Qiyue, and they won't be able to get out of the test for a while.

After all, Qiyue had already started refining pills when Qin Feng was refining pills.

And Jumang can be transformed into three thousand, and the speed of refining medicinal pills is probably faster than Qin Feng, so he is the first to leave the customs.

"Looking at this situation, at most one hour, Di Jiang can be born!"

At this time, Qin Feng looked at the Dijiang Spirit Egg.

Jumang and Qiyue were pleasantly surprised!

"That's great! Dad! I'll have a younger brother soon to play with me."

Qi Yue also smiled and said: "Master, Di Jiang is a mid-grade god-level egg. If it is born, it will be of great help to you!"

Qin Feng nodded with a smile, and his eyes also showed anticipation.

The birth of Di Jiang had a great effect on him.

Not only can it sacrifice combat power to him, but it can also help him condense SSS-level chaos talent, and let the time and space gods recognize the master.

The changes in these three aspects alone can make his strength skyrocket!

what! correct!

He almost forgot about it!

Suddenly, Qin Feng seemed to think of something, and his eyes lit up.

In the next second, he broke his fingers and blood clotted, ready to drip into the spirit egg.

Qi Yue was stunned: "Master, this Emperor Jiang Spirit Egg has absorbed enough energy of blood essence. If you feed it with blood essence, it doesn't seem to have any effect, right?"

Qin Feng took a deep breath and said: "My bloodline talent has just broken through, reaching the peak of the SSS level, and the quality of blood essence has risen to a new level. I want to give it a try. Now, if I feed a drop of blood essence, can I make Di Jiang? Evolve again."

After many experiments, Qin Feng has found that with high-grade essence and blood, the eggs of battle pets can easily evolve.

If he can make Dijiang Spirit Egg evolve again, then he will make a lot of money!

Hearing that, Qi Yue's eyes lit up.

"Hey! Yes! Master, it would be even better if the Dijiang Spirit Egg could evolve again. It's just that it's too late to replenish the blood essence at this time?"

There was concern in the little girl's tone.

She naturally hopes that the Dijiang Spirit Egg can evolve.

As we all know, pets are the easiest to evolve in the state of spirit eggs.

Once hatched, and then feeding the essence and blood, it will have no effect.

Qin Feng is also not sure: "Whether it works or not, try it first and then talk about it!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he pierced his **** and squeezed out a drop of blood that was as red as glass.

"Dad! Your blood is so fragrant!"

As soon as the blood came out, it exuded a refreshing fragrance!

Xiaojumang was surprised!

Snapped!

A soft sound!

The next second, the drop of blood essence fell on the eggshell.

Qin Feng and the three immediately stared at the blood.

But the spirit egg didn't respond.

Di Jiang was in the spirit egg at the moment, and he had entered a state of self-drowsiness.

It is preparing for its final birth.

If it does not absorb blood essence, it will miss the opportunity to evolve again.

"Master, this spirit egg"

Qiyue looked worried.

Silk! Silk! Silk!

But she was only halfway through her words, and the blood essence on the eggshell was slowly absorbed.

Qin Feng's eyes lit up: "absorbed! It seems there is hope!"

Qi Yue was also surprised: "Yes!"

In just a moment, the spirit egg completely absorbed the essence and blood, exuding a more dazzling aura, and the breath became a little stronger, but it was far from the state of evolution.

"Why didn't it evolve? Could it be that the amount of blood essence is not enough?"

Thinking of this, Qin Feng squeezed out another drop of blood essence and dropped it on the egg.

Soon, the spirit egg drained the blood and essence, and still did not evolve.

Qin Feng was not reconciled and dropped a drop again

After a while, the spirit egg drained the blood again!

click! click! click!

Then, there was a burst of light noises on the eggshell!

This time, there is finally a response,

In just a moment, a new innate divine pattern appeared on the black eggshell.

Suddenly, the breath of Dijiang Spirit Egg began to soar.

At the same time, in Qin Feng's sea of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge, a reminder of Heavenly Dao sounded.

[Reminder: Your pet 'Dijiang Spirit Egg' is evolving]

„ÄêSuccessful evolution! Dijiang Spirit Egg has been promoted from the 'middle-grade **** rank' level to the 'mid-grade **** rank peak' level]

Ha ha! !

It worked! !

Qin Feng was overjoyed!

The middle-grade **** rank corresponds to the early and middle stages of the true god.

The pinnacle of the mid-level **** rank corresponds to the pinnacle of the true **** and the limit of the true god.

Di Jiang's evolution has been completed this time, and his potential has been greatly improved, which is also of great help to Qin Feng.

"Master! There is one more innate divine pattern! Dijiang has successfully advanced!"

Qi Yue watched this scene in surprise.

"Wow! Dad, this little brother is amazing!"

Xiaojumang also looked happy.

call!

Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief, and a gratified smile appeared on his face.

Then, he smiled and said, "At the last critical moment, this little guy has advanced. The benefits this brings are naturally huge, but it also brings a trouble!"

Qi Yue was puzzled: "Master, isn't it a good thing that Di Jiang has advanced? Why did it bring about a trouble?"

Qin Feng sighed: "Originally, this Emperor River could hatch within an hour. But at the moment it was about to be born, it evolved again. In this way, its birth time was prolonged."

Qi Yue suddenly said: "So it is! How long does it take for it to hatch?"
