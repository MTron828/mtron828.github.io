The entire Thunder Clan station was shaking violently!

Snapped! Snapped! Snapped! ‚Ä¶

Under that palm, Lei Ming and other three heaven-level powerhouses, and more than 200 earth-level powerhouses were all shot on the spot and turned into meat sauce...

The terrifying lingering power of that palm also shook within ten thousand feet, and thousands of Thunder Clan disciples vomited blood and flew out.

This terrifying scene!

Shocked the entire audience of the Thunder Clan disciples!

One by one, their eyes widened in astonishment!

But before they could think about it, Xiao Luan'er had already taken action.

I saw the little guy waved his hand!

call out! call out! call out!

Suddenly, thousands of flaming feather arrows shot towards the Thunder Clan disciples...

Now, the little guy has used the 'Foundation Promotion Card', and successfully upgraded his foundation-building rank to a medium-level god-level foundation building.

Her combat power also reached 20,000 stars.N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

This shot, the Fire Feather Arrow Formation, is extremely powerful...

boom! boom! boom!

In just an instant, thousands of Thunder Clan disciples were shot through their bodies by rockets and died tragically on the spot...

Suddenly, the shrill screams came one after another!

"My God!"

"Escape! Escape!"

"Don't kill me! Don't kill me! Ah...!"

In a split second, the Thunder Clan disciples collapsed and began to flee!

"Kill!"

At this moment, there was an earth-shattering cry of killing outside the station!

Long Yuan's army also arrived, rushing into the Thunder Clan's children one by one, like chopping melons and vegetables, cutting one after another...

Yueling's clone and Xiao Luan'er shot in the air, and the scene was a one-sided slaughter...

At the same time, the Ze people were stationed.

The ice spirit clone has also arrived.

The Naze Clan was weaker than the Lei Clan. There were only two Heaven-level 1st-level powerhouses and more than 18,000 disciples.

The ice spirit clone immediately killed two heavenly powerhouses.

At this time, he held a seal in his hand and was using Doomsday.

In the radius of thousands of miles, the sky and the earth change color.

Countless thunderbolts, ice arrows, fire rain, and meteorites shot towards the Ze people's disciples...

For a moment, there was mourning in the field, and the children of the Ze tribe were killed on the spot...

At the same time, the five thousand Longyuan children rushed into the Ze tribe's children, like cutting vegetables, killing all of them and screaming...

In just a moment, the field was full of blood!

The children of the Ze clan are not opponents at all, they are completely one-sided slaughter...

In fact, even if the disciples of Long Yuan did not complete the foundation building, they all had prefecture-level combat power, far stronger than the children of the Lei Clan and Ze Clan.

Killing them is as easy as a group of tigers hunting sheep...

At the same time, in zero-degree space.

The wood spirit avatar is doing all the alchemy!

Six hours have passed in the outside world, and two or three days have passed in the zero-degree space.

In the past two or three days, he has refined more than one hundred primary soul essence pills, and he already has more than 200 primary soul essence pills in his hands, excluding those who handed in the quest.

This harvest is extremely rich!

Everything is going in the right direction!

At this time, the wood spirit clone was in a happy mood and took out a material, which is the material for refining the intermediate soul essence pill.

He has already completed the tasks of the primary soul essence pill.

Next, he wants to refine a more advanced intermediate-level soul essence pill.

After refining those mid-level soul essence pills, he must be able to reach the top level in his alchemy technique.

At that time, he will be qualified to refine high-level soul essence pills.

Thinking of this, Mu Ling's clone is ready to open the furnace for alchemy.

hum!

Right at this moment, the sky is shaking!

Nine colors of light suddenly light up!

Filled the entire room!

The Mu Ling clone quickly looked up and saw Qin Feng staring at the air with ecstasy.

In the sky, the seal of the beast is no longer incomplete, it has become flawless, exuding nine-color aura, and the breath is continuous...

At this moment, Tiandao sent a reminder.

„Äêcongratulations! After repairing the seal of the beast, you have obtained a complete ninth-order rare item! „Äë

call!

Finally fixed it!

Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief, and his eyes were full of joy.

But at this moment, white lights flew from the void, and then madly poured into Qin Feng's body...

[Your clone successfully kills the guardian (Tian level 2), you get +2771 attributes, +37.36 million energy points, and +503 points. „Äë

[Your clone successfully killed the guardian (Tier 1), you get +1955 attributes, +27.11 million energy points, and +396 points. „Äë

[Your clone successfully killed the guardian (Tier 1), you get +2013 attributes, +28.34 million energy points, and +417 points. „Äë

It turned out that the two clones were killing the Lei Clan and Ze Clan, which brought him a lot of feedback.

Suddenly, Qin Feng's energy value, attribute points and points are soaring all the way.

He was overjoyed!

What a joyous event!

The four hundred and ninth chapter is the blood essence! The strong enemy is coming!

After a while, those backfeeding ended.

Qin Feng also gained a lot of attribute points and points.

Of course, those points are counted towards the next knockout round and cannot be used this round

However, Qin Feng was already satisfied.

At this time, he thought again.

The beast **** seal in the air turned into a golden light and poured into his body.

In the next second, his whole body lit up with nine-color auras!

[The re-integration of the 'Beast God's Seal' succeeded! You have acquired the ability to refine the blood of thunder-type divine beasts. „Äë

Qin Feng smiled again.

Fusion is complete!

He can finally refine the high-grade unicorn blood essence.

On the other side, Mu Ling's clone also showed a happy smile when he saw this scene.

Then, he opened the pill furnace and began to refine the intermediate soul essence pill.

At the same moment, the Thunder Clan stationed in the sky.

Yueling clone looked down with a smile on her face.

I saw below, Long Yuan's children cheered!

After the battle just now, Longyuan Town won a great victory!

The children of the Thunder Clan were slaughtered, and no one escaped.

After cheering, everyone began to clear the battlefield.

Yueling's clone also descended from the sky, came to Lei Ming's body, and put away the storage ring and land deed card.

Then, he began to extract the body

„ÄêEndless extraction success! You have obtained a mass of ÊéºÊùå essence and blood (medium grade). „Äë

what!

The blood of tau tau!

Yueling's avatar's eyes lit up, shining straight.

Yutu is one of the four beasts!

The strength of the four beasts is close to that of Qinglong, Baihu, Suzaku, and Xuanwu, and they also belong to the category of divine beasts.

Yueling clone did not expect that this Thunder Clan actually possessed the bloodline

In fact, the blood essence is a kind of thunder beast blood essence.

Before that, Qin Feng couldn't refine the blood of the thunder **** beast.

Now it's good, Qin Feng has just repaired the beast **** seal and obtained the ability to refine the blood of the thunder **** beast, and all kinds of thunder **** blood came to his door.

This luck is not ordinary good ah!

Yueling clone is delighted and continues to extract

„ÄêEndless extraction success! You have obtained a mass of ÊéºÊùå essence and blood (medium grade). „Äë

Got another bunch!

continue!

„ÄêEndless extraction success! You have obtained a mass of ÊéºÊùå essence and blood (medium grade). „Äë

This is the third group!

„ÄêEndless extraction failed! The blood of the divine beast in the target body has been absorbed cleanly...]

very good!

This time, I actually got the blood of the three groups of thunder, and they were all mid-grade.

The harvest this time exceeded expectations!

The Moon Spirit clone was very satisfied.

Afterwards, his heart moved, and the three groups of thunder-type divine blood floating in front of him disappeared out of thin air.

The Moon Spirit clone smiled and raised his head, glanced at the Wind Clan station, and continued to clear the battlefield.

On the other side, the Ze people were stationed, and the battle was over.

The Bing Ling clone also descended from the sky with a look of joy, came to the body of the Ze clan patriarch, and put away the storage ring and the deed card.

At this point, the guardian forces in the second area were completely destroyed.

Longyuan Town successfully unified the No. 2 area, and the sphere of influence has covered both areas
