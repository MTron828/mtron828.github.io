As soon as these words fell, the high-level officials nodded slightly.

But then, Liu Xuan smiled bitterly: "Boss, if it is possible, I don't want to give up the Blue Star Realm. We finally conquered this world, and when we were about to unify it, we abandoned it because of the attack of a powerful enemy. In my heart Sorry!"

"Yeah! The old man is also a little reluctant!"

Granny Feng Xi also sighed.

At this moment, not only the two of them sighed, but Feng Xi, Qi Yue and others all showed their dismay.

After all, this is where they were born and raised.

If it is not a last resort, they are reluctant to give up.

Qin Feng sighed: "Yeah! The deity is not willing to give up! I just said in case!"

At this time, Yu Xuanji said: "Master, as far as my concubine knows, the higher the Star-Lord level, the higher the ability to control the planet. If you can get the third-level Star-Lord, you don't need to give up the planet. You can completely control the planet, Travel around the universe."

"In this way, we don't have to abandon the planet, and we can also avoid the attack of powerful enemies!"

Qin Feng's eyes lit up: "Hey! That's a good idea. By the way, aren't the fifth-class star-lord and the fourth-class star-lord both star masters? These two types of star masters can't move the planet?"

Yu Xuanji nodded: "As far as my concubine knows, the star masters of the fifth and fourth-rank star-rankers can control the power of heaven and earth on the planet, but they cannot move the planet. Only the third-rank star-rank and above can do it. arrive."

Qin Feng was stunned: "So it is! It seems that the goal of my future star master assessment is to hit the third-class star-lord. I don't know what kind of strength can I have the chance to get the third-class star-lord?"

Yu Xuanji pondered: "As far as the concubine knows, at least the strength of the middle stage of the main **** is at least 10% possible."

Qin Feng was surprised: "The strength of the Lord God in the middle stage is only 10% possible? It seems that the Star Lord rank assessment, 4.7 is much more difficult than I thought!"

Yu Xuanji sighed: "It's really extremely difficult! Don't say the third-rank Star Lord! In the Star Lord assessment held every thousand years, among the 10,000 Star Lord candidates, very few can get the fifth-rank Star Lord! Master, this is The test for you this time is too great."

As soon as these words fell, everyone nodded.

Today, Qin Feng's comprehensive strength has not even reached the threshold of the Lord God.

With his current strength, it is difficult to win the fourth-rank Star-Lord, let alone the third-rank Star-Lord.

Then, Yu Xuanji said again: "However, Master, as long as you can become a star master, it will be of great benefit to you! Not only will Heavenly Dao give you rich rewards, but it will also give you the means to control the power of the planet."

"The power to control the planet is very powerful. For example, the star master in the early stage of the main **** can control the power of the planet to fight against the power of the main **** in the middle stage. In short, each star master is the strongest in his own lair. "

Qin Feng's eyes lit up, secretly thinking that this method is not bad!

Thinking of this, he looked forward to the Star Master assessment even more.

This also made him even more convinced that he could not escape and the planet could not be lost.

Otherwise, even if he becomes a star master, but loses his old nest, his strength will be greatly reduced!

It seems that he has to get the third-class Star Lord!

He doesn't want to become a star master without a nest

Chapter 650 The Elephant of the Sky! Di Jiang appeared!

After thinking about it, Qin Feng has a goal in mind.

Immediately, he said: "Everyone, the current situation is very clear. My first goal is to obtain the third-class Star Lord. Only by achieving that goal can our Longyuan City be safe!"

As soon as these words fell, the high-level officials nodded.

At this time, Yu Xuanji thought for a while and said, "Master, the concubine counts the time. After six days, the third round of hegemony will end. In another day, it will be the opening day of the Holy Land. According to common sense, the Holy Land will open three times. sky."

"Three days later, the Star Lord assessment will take place. And the Star Lord assessment is also about three days. With this calculation, when you obtain the Star Lord title and return to the Blue Star Realm, that will be thirteen days later."

"But before God died, he said that his body would definitely come for revenge after ten days. Wouldn't it be too late?"

With this reminder, the expressions of the high-level officials changed slightly.

"Yes! Boss, it will be thirteen days after you get the title of Star Lord. Will the body of God come when you go to participate in the Star Lord assessment? If so, it will be a big trouble!"

"If you want to see it, it's not necessarily! After all, after ten days, it's just a word from God's side. Who knows whether it's true or not? He said that it's ten days later. If it's fifteen days later, it's also ten days later!"

"That's right! This time is up for discussion! However, we must first confirm the time. Otherwise, the good or the bad will be unpredictable!"

"Yeah! But we don't know anything about God's essence. When will he come, who can know?"

"Hey! This is really a big trouble!"

This time, everyone was worried, and their brows were furrowed.

Even Qin Feng frowned.

Not knowing when the enemy will attack is indeed a huge hidden danger!

He can't ignore his subordinates and go to participate in the star master assessment by himself. 18

If he comes back after the assessment, the enemy has occupied Blue Star and killed all his men, then the loss will be heavy.

At this time, Qingchengzi seemed to think of something, looked up at Qin Feng,

"City Lord, don't you have "Book of Changes"? This item can predict recent personnel affairs. You can use it to deduce it to see when the enemy will attack?"

Qin Feng's eyes lit up.

right!

In fact, "Book of Changes" has disappeared, but he has a more powerful "Book of the World"!

The "Book of the Present" should be more accurate than the "Book of Changes" for the recent personnel forecast.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng hurriedly took out a quaint book from the storage ring, it was "Book of the Present World"!

As soon as the "Book of the Present World" appeared, it would shine for thousands of miles, exuding an earth-shattering aura that made the whole world tremble slightly!

Yu Xuanji and the others were amazed.

Qingchengzi was even more impressed!

He could tell at a glance that this "Book of the Present World" was a high-grade god-level thing, two grades higher than that "Book of Changes".

After all, "Book of Changes" is a medium-grade god-level thing!

Above the middle-grade **** rank, it is the peak of the middle-grade **** rank.

Going up, it is the top-grade god-level!

In fact, the prediction ability of "Book of the Present World" is indeed stronger than that of "Book of Changes", and even the ability to increase air transport is stronger than that of "Book of Changes".

That "Book of Changes" bonus to luck is ten times!

The Book of the Present World is twenty times that!

After all, after the three pages are merged, the functions will be superimposed.

"Wow~! This is the "Book of the Present World"? It looks really extraordinary!"

"Dad! This item comes with thirteen rays of brilliance. It should be a high-grade god-level item, right?"

At this moment, Xiao Luan'er and the others looked at the Book of the Present World in amazement.

Qin Feng smiled slightly: "It is indeed a high-grade god-level thing, and it belongs to the category of heaven and earth wonders, which is more precious than a high-grade artifact. Unfortunately, I just got it not long ago, and many of its effects are not yet useful, and I need to explore it first. !"

Speaking of this, Qin Feng was a little helpless.

Not long after he got the Book of the Present World, many functions and functions are still unknown.

Before, when he dealt with God, he only used the "Book of the Present World" as an ordinary high-grade artifact.

Its actual function is by no means comparable to high-grade artifacts.

When he is free, he has to study it carefully!

"Dad, let's take a look, can you use this "Book of the World" to predict the arrival time of the enemy?"

Xiao Luan'er couldn't wait.

The subordinates also watched eagerly.

This matter is too important to Longyuan City!

Qin Feng took a deep breath: "I'll try it!"

As soon as the words fell, he pressed the "Book of the Present World" with one hand and tried to urge it!

Om~!

In the next second, the divine book aura was released, and it shook slightly!

Immediately afterwards, a series of hexagrams composed of golden stars slowly rose from the writing and suspended in the air!

The divination results are out!

Qin Feng slowly opened his eyes and looked at the hexagram in front of him thoughtfully.

In fact, he doesn't know how to understand hexagrams, after all, he has never been exposed to hexagram theory.

However, as the owner of the "Book of the Present World", he is also the person who created the hexagrams, and he has telepathy in the dark, which actually made him understand the meaning of the hexagrams.

As the saying goes: the sky hangs the image, see the good and the bad, the sage looks like it!

According to the meaning of the hexagram, the attack of this powerful enemy will be after the fifteenth day.

After fifteen days!Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

He has completed the star master assessment and has returned to the Blue Star Realm.

At this thought, Qin Feng's eyes showed joy.

At the same moment, Xiao Luan'er and the others held their breath and watched nervously.

After a while, Qin Feng slowly retracted his palm.

Those golden hexagrams turned into little stars and slowly disappeared.

"Dad, how is it?"

Xiao Luan asked anxiously.

Everyone also looked at Qin Feng eagerly.

But before Qin Feng could speak, Qingchengzi on the side spoke excitedly.

"City Lord, the hexagram you have created is the Kun hexagram on the top and the Gen hexagram on the bottom. When combined, it is the Dishan Qian hexagram in the sixty-four hexagrams. This hexagram is wonderful!"

Qin Feng's eyes lit up, secretly thinking that Qingchengzi is proficient in hexagram theory and should see something.

Immediately, he said: "I see this hexagram, which means that the strong enemy will attack after fifteen days. What does the Lord of Qing Guan think?"

Qingchengzi stroked his beard and smiled: "City Lord, you are absolutely correct! At this moment, the upper hexagram is Kun, which represents the number 8, and the lower hexagram is Gen, which represents the number 7."

"The addition of 8 and 7 is exactly the number of 15. In other words, if a strong enemy strikes, it will be fifteen days later."

As soon as these words fell, Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that he was not mistaken.

The crowd was even more overjoyed.

"That's great! After the fifteenth day, the boss has completed the star master assessment!"

"Yeah! As long as the boss is there, we are not afraid of strong enemies!"

At this moment, the high-level executives were full of joy.

Qin Feng is the backbone of Long Yuan and the pillar of Long Yuan.

As long as Qin Feng is there, the confidence of the high-level leaders will increase greatly.

Seeing this scene, Qin Feng was in a better mood.

At least the issue of time has been completely resolved.

Then, he looked at Qingchengzi again.

"Qing Guanzhu, do you see any other imagery in this hexagram?"

Qingchengzi hurriedly said: "Return to the city master! The earth and mountains are modest, and the outer diagram is Kun as the earth. The inner diagram is Gen as the mountain. Only by continuously improving our strength can we create auspicious results.‚Äù

"Looking at this hexagram again, there is only the original hexagram, and there is no change. This means that all good and bad things are unknown. We need to see the result of the city owner's efforts before we can start the hexagram again and judge the good and bad."

Qin Feng nodded slightly, feeling that it made sense.

The 'celestial elephant' he got also meant this.

The so-called sky is the meaning of heaven.

Only a person of great luck like Qin Feng can understand the meaning of the hexagram even if he does not understand the logic of the hexagram.
