Secondly, he also wants to give benefits to these subordinates, and he cannot monopolize all the benefits.

Besides, the upgrade of Longyuan Village requires more people to upgrade to level 10.

Otherwise, the village stays at level 0 forever.

How did he get into the top three in the village competition and win the 1000 point attribute reward?

Of course, he wasn't interested in those power stones either.

A power stone only has 100 energy points, which is far less fast than killing a beast of level 10 or higher.

However, he is interested in contributing points.

Liu Yuan and Qi Jie acquired a large number of novice short knives, but it allowed him to earn a lot of contribution points.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng looked at the resource list again.

Tier 1 steel knives have long been sold out.

Nowadays, everyone in Longyuan Village has the means to earn contribution points, and the Tier 1 steel knives he produces are very popular.

At the moment, he exchanged a novice short knife at will, which cost 2 contribution points.

Then, he used endless extraction to transform the short knife into a steel knife, and then donated it, and got 5 contribution points.

Over and over, he earned 3 Contribution Points.

Qin Feng was overjoyed.

The two of Liu Yuan acquired a short knife and could only earn 1 contribution.

His income is three times that of Liu Yuan.Explore new ùíèovels on nùíêvelbiùíè(.)com

Even better, he has no competition.

In the entire area, only he can do it, transform the novice short knife into a tier 1 steel knife.

In theory, he could earn 3 million contribution points.

And Liu Yuan's business will be known to more people sooner or later, and the speed at which they make money and contribute points will be slower and slower.

"Not bad! Not bad! When I'm free, I'll deal with this batch of novice knives!"

At this moment, Qin Feng looked at the resource warehouse with joy in his eyes.

There are more than 3,000 novice knives in that warehouse.

If he handles all of them well, he can earn about 10,000 contribution points, which is more than he kills monsters.

This time, after slaughtering the tree demon and the bee colony, he donated all the corpses and got about 2,000 contribution points.

Today, his contribution points have accumulated to 3872 points.

Having said that, after leveling up two levels in the Valley of Ten Thousand Flowers in a row, he extracted 30 attributes from the three queen bees.

The various talents and abilities of the queen bee are lower than Qin Feng, and there is no value to be extracted. The endless extraction automatically extracts its agility attribute.

Each queen can provide 10 points of agility attributes, three is 30 points.

It can be seen that the attribute points provided by the dead body of a king-level beast are much higher than those of mutant beasts and ordinary beasts.

Qin Feng's combat power has also increased continuously, and now it has reached the limit of 91 stars, which is not far from the threshold of prefecture-level combat power.

He was very satisfied with the result!

According to this progress, he has more and more confidence to face the punisher.

"I don't want so much! I have to go to Hellfire Mountain quickly and complete the task of opening the map as soon as possible!"

Qin Feng murmured in his heart, then dodged and hurried towards Huo Prison Mountain.

He didn't deal with those novice knives.

If you want to finish those novice short knives, it is impossible to complete it in two or three hours.

He can completely wait until he has time to deal with the novice short knife.

For Qin Feng now, time is the most precious.

He must complete the map opening task as soon as possible, so that the people of Longyuan Village can enter the new map and obtain more high-quality resources.

Perhaps, with those high-quality resources, villagers will level up faster.

The upgrade speed of Longyuan Village will also increase.

His hopes of finishing in the top three in the village competition will also be greater.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng hurried to Huoyu Mountain.

Now in the village race, he must race against time...

At the same time, Liu Yuan and Qi Jie started a private chat.

Liu Yuan: "Qi Jie, Qin Feng, the boss, just went to the regional channel to buy synthetic cards. He must have seen the business the two of us are doing."

Qi Jie: "Yeah, but he didn't go to the village to say it. However, this secret cannot be kept, and sooner or later everyone will know it. Let's hurry up! It's good to earn a little bit more, but it's not good if there are more people who know it. I earned it!"

Liu Yuan: "That's right! Now, the chat channel is bursting, and many people are asking why we upgrade so quickly!"

Qi Jie: "Hehe! Ignore them for now!"

At the moment, the two laughed wickedly and accelerated the acquisition of short knives.

At the same time, the chat channel in Longyuan Village was very lively.

"Haha! Brothers, we are only ten level 10 powerhouses away from upgrading Longyuan Village!"

"Not ten, but nine! Boss Qin Feng has already reached level 10 or above."

"Yes! It's up to the nine bosses Liu Xuan, and I hope they can speed up the upgrade."

"I really want our village to be upgraded to level 1 sooner. I wonder if I will be blessed by heaven after I get to level 1?"

"Haha! There must be rewards from heaven. When we set up a level 0 village, we all have 50 attribute rewards. When you reach level 1, the rewards will definitely be more generous!"

"Wow! I'm looking forward to it!"

"Yeah! Pray for Liu Xuan to upgrade quickly!"

"Dude, haven't you looked at the ranking list? It's not Liu Xuan who ranks second now, but Liu Yuan!"

"No way? Damn it! It really is!"

"I'll take a look! Oh, Liu Yuan is really second. Hey! This is... God! Look! Boss Qin Feng is level 14!"

"Let me see! Hes~! It really is!"

"Oh my God! This is too arrogant!

This time, there was a sensation in the chat channel, and everyone was stunned.

At the same time, somewhere in the Bone Wilderness.

Liu Xuan looked at the five beast corpses in front of him with pride.

Just now, he defeated five beasts with one enemy, and after a hard fight, he finally killed these five beasts.

Now, his level progress is 73% at level 9, not far from the goal of level 10.

"It's been such a long time, I don't know what the progress of Boss Qin Feng is? I must have been promoted to level 10 before he was promoted to level 13."

Liu Xuan thought happily in his heart, and then opened the ranking channel.

He has been immersed in killing monsters, and he hasn't looked at the level rankings for a long time.

Soon, he saw the ranking list and was dumbfounded.

I saw Qin Feng, the first place, suddenly rose to level 14!

This is too exaggerated!

He took a closer look and almost vomited blood.

Fuck it~!

When did Liu Yuan surpass him, and he was ranked second.

no!

He must not let Liu Yuan surpass him!

He's going to take back the second place.

This second place is not only an honor, but also a ranking reward during the novice assessment period!

How to do? How to do?

What should he do to win back second place?

Liu Xuan was impatient and opened the trading channel inadvertently.

At this sight, his eyes lit up.

He saw that Qin Feng hung several third-order weapons in the trading channel.

correct!

He can go to Boss Qin Feng for help.

At the moment, Liu Xuan entered the private chat channel and tried to contact Qin Feng...

But on the other hand, Qin Feng was on his way to Huoyu Mountain.

Huoji Mountain is located in the south of Luo Prairie, a little far away.

When he arrives at that place, I'm afraid it will be two or three hours later.

[Reminder: Liu Xuan sent you a private chat request. „Äë

"Hey! Liu Xuan came to me again?"

Qin Feng's heart moved, and he opened the private chat channel. At a glance, he saw Liu Xuan's avatar beating, and he kept sending communication requests to him.

He connected the communication at will, and a message came from there.

Liu Xuan: "Boss, I want to ask you one thing."

Qin Feng: "Speak!"

Liu Xuan: "Boss, I saw that you are on the trading channel, and you have a few Tier 3 weapons. Among them, Tier 3 war knives are very suitable for me. I want to trade with you, but there is no equivalent in my hand."

Liu Xuan: "I humbly beg you to give me the weapon on credit first, and when I win the second place, I will get a silver treasure chest. I will give you that treasure chest. Even if I exchange it for your sword."

Qin Feng's eyes lit up.

The reward for the second place in the novice assessment is a silver treasure chest.

In Qin Feng's eyes, silver treasure chests are more valuable than Tier 3 weapons.

Because he can close the gold treasure chest with the silver treasure chest.

Liu Xuan: "Boss, what do you think?"

Liu Xuan was very anxious.

Qin Feng could see that he was overtaken by Liu Yuan, so he came to the door in such a hurry.

Otherwise, Liu Xuan would not be shameless and come to Qin Feng for credit.

Now that you've come to the door, let's help with this one.

Qin Feng: "Okay! Come to the trading channel!"

Liu Xuan was overjoyed: "Boss, you are so kind! I, Liu Xuan, will always remember this favor in my heart."

Qin Feng: "You're welcome!"

Immediately, the two entered the trading channel and completed the transaction.

When Liu Xuan got the weapon, he was overjoyed and grateful to Qin Feng.

Liu Xuan: "Boss Qin Feng, thank you so much this time. I will definitely work hard and win the second place."

At this moment, he was full of self-confidence, thinking that if he got a Tier 3 weapon, he would kill monsters faster, upgrade faster, and finally win back the second place.

Qin Feng's heart moved, and he sent him a message.

Qin Feng: "Liu Xuan, you're not curious, why is Liu Yuan leveling up so fast? You can go to the regional channel to watch it."
