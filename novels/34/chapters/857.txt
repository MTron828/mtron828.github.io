not good!

At the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, his eyes widened in horror!

Boom~!

Without waiting for him to think, Qin Feng patted him with a palm.

"Forgive...forgive me!~~~ Ah!"

Bang~!

A blast!

Blood splashes!

The shrill screams echoed in the void!

With just one palm, Qin Feng smashed the Yuan Dynasty to death!

The dazzling Heaven Surveying Divine Sword emerged from this.

Qin Feng quickly grabbed the divine sword and sent it directly into the zero-dimensional space, letting its fission body to refine.

Then, he put away the storage ring from the early Yuan Dynasty.

After this treatment, a white light flew from the blood mist and poured into his body.

[You succeeded in killing the Heaven Suppressor at the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty (the early stage of the False God), and you obtained +100 million attributes]

[You succeeded in killing the Heaven Suppressor at the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty (the early stage of the False God), and you obtained +900 million energy points]

[You succeeded in killing the Heaven Suppressor at the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty (the early stage of the False God).

Qin Feng's eyes lit up!

It turned out that the leader of the Heaven Suppressing Force was called the 'Heaven Suppressor'!

The harvest of those who kill the sky is higher than that of those who hide!

For example, at the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, the False God was in the early stage, but the attribute points he gave back to Qin Feng were as many as the False God's ultimate power, as well as the points and energy values!

Even better, he also provided a heaven-suppressing artifact!

The only regret is that the gold points are a little less.

However, Qin Feng is already very satisfied.

In short, once the Yuan Dynasty died, the future troubles of the Blue Star Realm were almost cleaned up.

But the disciples of Long Yuan are facing a huge disaster at this moment.

With this in mind, Qin Feng looked at the Blue Star Realm in the distance.

He is of the same mind as the avatar, and naturally knows the appearance of God.

At this moment, the four clones are frantically attacking the mask of God, but they cannot break through.

If you can't break through the light shield, you can't interrupt the coming of God's holy light.

Then his subordinates and Tiance's children will all become believers of God!

This thought made Qin Feng anxious.

He has to stop!

Fortunately, he is a sky surveyor, and he can perform two consecutive sky surveys within ten minutes.

He wants to rush back, just in a moment.

However, God's combat power has reached 200 million stars, and its defensive power is terrifying to the extreme.

Even if he rushes back, he may not be able to break through the light shield and interrupt the coming of God's holy light.

By the way, he killed several False Gods in a row this time, and the harvest was not small.

He had to quickly improve his combat power and kill him again.

He wants to face God with the strongest fighting power.

Only in that way would he have a silver lining to break through the veil of God.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng took the wreckage of the early Yuan Dynasty into the zero-degree space with a wave of his hand.

He had no time to extract the corpse, so he let the fission body extract it

Then, he opened the data interface

[Free attribute]: 520 million

[Golden Points]: 44 points

„ÄêReputation„Äë: 123 points.

After reading the data, Qin Feng's eyes showed joy.

This time, he and his clones killed Teng Kui ancestors, Ba Snake ancestors, Dan Zhu ancestors, Taishi, Yuanchu, and hundreds of thousands of blue-green troops in succession, and he actually got 520 million attributes.

This harvest is not small!

However, he could no longer waste time.

The light of God has come, and it is about to be done.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng felt a sense of urgency in his heart.

At the moment, he hurriedly started adding points

At the same time, on the other side of the universe starry sky, there is an incomparably huge star field.

There are nearly one million cultivation planets under his command.

This star domain is called 'Bright God's Domain'!

In the center of the light star field, there are nine huge planets, and the volume of each planet is a million times the size of the blue star world.

It can be seen that the nine planets are all terrifyingly large!

And around those nine giant planets, they are surrounded by thousands of moon stars.

The size of each moon star is comparable to that of the Blue Star Realm.

At this time, the nine huge planets were slowly revolving around the three suns.

The three suns, arranged in an equilateral triangle, also revolve around a center.

What is shocking is that the center point surrounded by the three suns is actually a temple larger than a planet.

If you look closely, you can vaguely see some humans flying in and out of the temple.

The scene was so shocking!

In fact, this is the headquarters of the Bright God Domain!

At this moment, on the seventh planet of the nine huge planets, in a huge temple, something is happening.

In that temple, a secret room.

A man with blond hair and blue eyes, wearing a white robe and exuding divine light, slowly opened his eyes.

Afterwards, he looked away in the direction of the Blue Star Realm with a look of joy.

If Qin Feng is here, he will be surprised to find that this man looks exactly like God.

"...I didn't expect it! My avatar woke up at this moment!"

The man smiled and whispered.

It turned out that God was just an incarnation of this man.

Then, as soon as he waved his hand, a white light flashed in front of him, and a man with blond hair and no beard appeared.

As soon as the man appeared, he saluted respectfully.

"Lucy has seen Lord Ye Shen!"

It turns out that God's body is called Yeshen, and it is the existence of God's King Realm.

Above the main **** realm is the **** king realm!

Ye Shen smiled slightly: "Lucy, do you remember that in order to search for the Book of the Three Worlds, we each sent an avatar to a parallel universe, a planet called 'Blue Star'."

"My incarnation is called God Jehovah. And your incarnation is called the fallen angel 'Lucifer'."

Lucius nodded slightly: "Naturally remember! But later, the 'Blue Star' of the parallel universe changed, the spiritual power of heaven and earth was sealed, the door of cultivation was blocked, and the tree of technology was opened."

"Since then, they have gone the other way, the so-called technological development. Your avatars and I were cut off at that point. They should have fallen into a deep sleep."

Ye Shen smiled slightly: "Tell you a happy event! Just now, my avatar woke up. And, I sensed his position."

Lucifer's eyes lit up: "Where is he?"

Ye Shen looked in the direction of the Blue Star Realm.

"He is in the Azure Dragon Star Territory, a cultivation planet called the Blue Star Territory."

"Qinglong Star Territory? That is a declining Star Territory, and its strength is far less than that of our Bright God Territory!"

Lucifer's eyes showed disdain, as if he looked down on the Azure Dragon Star Region.Checkk new ùíèovel chùíÇpters at novùíÜlbin(.)com

"By the way, Lord Yeshen, what about the Blue Star Realm? Is it a first-class cultivation planet?"

Yeshen smiled and shook his head: "The Blue Star Realm doesn't even have a star master, it belongs to the moribund planet without a master, and it's not worth mentioning."

"However, when I came back this time as an incarnation, I still encountered some small troubles. At this moment, he is being besieged by a few small ants."

Lucifer was shocked: "Then your avatar will be fine, right?"

Ye Shen smiled and shook his head: "It will be fine! The strength of my incarnation has recovered to the threshold of the main **** realm. In that blue star realm, there is not even a true true **** extreme powerhouse. How can it threaten my incarnation village? "

Lucifer nodded with a smile: "That's right! It's not bad to have a true **** peak powerhouse on a moribund planet. It's impossible to have a true **** limit powerhouse."

"So, the incarnation of Lord Yeshen will soon be able to return to the Divine Realm of Light and meet you?"

Yeshen smiled: "Yeah! He came back this time, and he brought back what we wanted!"

Lucifer's eyes lit up: "Is that the half page of the future book?"

Yeshen nodded slightly: "Exactly! However, wait! My avatar still has some small troubles, and I will communicate with him when he is finished."

Lucifer smiled: "That's how it should be!"

Right now, the two gods are just waiting for the outcome of the battle in the Blue Star Realm.

Chapter 642 The Supreme Survey! The Book of Gods of the World!

While **** and Lucifer were silently waiting, something was happening over the Blue Star Realm.

At this moment, above the starry sky!

In order to seize the time, Qin Feng was adding points quickly.

It only takes one minute for God to complete the coming of the Holy Light, and he must speed up!

"Finally finished!"

At this moment, Qin Feng muttered, and his eyes showed joy.

At this moment, he finally finished adding points, and the basic combat power soared from 60,000 stars to 70.4 million stars in one fell swoop!

This boost is too powerful!

Qin Feng couldn't believe it!

Then, after a little thought, he was relieved.

He can have such a big improvement because he killed the two Heaven Suppressors, Yuan Chu and Tai Shi!

The attribute points of these two people are more than the ancestors of Danzhu and Bashe, and more than the ancestors of Tengkui.

In short, such a substantial improvement makes Qin Feng extremely satisfied!
