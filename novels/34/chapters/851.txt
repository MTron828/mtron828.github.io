Only after this matter is dealt with, all the people in Long Yuan will be able to kill them together.

This should be this round of hegemony, the last harvest feast, and the last chance for Long Yuan to improve his strength.

He naturally didn't want Feng Xi and others to miss it.

After all, ten times the reward is not something you can get by just touching it.

Otherwise, he would have taken action long ago, which would have caused the two of them to be so noisy at the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty!

It turned out that Qin Feng was thinking about training his subordinates.

After all, his strength is strong enough, and the harvest of killing these people will not be too big.

On the contrary, Jumang, Fengxi and others, as well as the disciples of Long Yuan, need to obtain attribute points from these people...

In a blink of an eye, there were nine announcements from Heaven!

All the sites in the fifth division are collected!

The number of sites in Longyuan City has been increased to 345!

The Moon Spirit clone also breathed a sigh of relief.

His main body is already in the fifth division, and he has begun to summon Feng Xi and others to his main body...

He can do it here too!

Thinking of this, Yueling's clone looked at the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty.

At this time, Yuan Chu and others also came to their senses!

"Damn it!"

Yuan Chu cursed angrily!

Yu Xuanji smiled slightly: "Looking at this situation, there seems to be a change in the fifth division!"

These words fell in the ears of the early Yuan Dynasty, which was particularly harsh!

Immediately, he sneered: "Miss Xuanji, I'm afraid you are too happy! The patriarch of the Wuxiang Nine Clan has long been destroyed, and the territory is occupied at this time, which means nothing. Qin Feng's crisis still exists! Long Yuan The city is just struggling to the death!"

As soon as these words fell, the ancestor Teng Kui agreed.

"Daoist friend at the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, you don't need to talk to this woman! Let's do it!"

"Okay! The three of us join forces to take down this woman first!"

As soon as the words fell, Yuanchu, Taishi, and Tengkui ancestors all looked at Yu Xuanji.

The atmosphere in the field was instantly tense!

The children of both sides are all clenching their weapons!

The war is about to break out!

But at this moment, a mutation occurred!

huh~!

I saw a flash of light and shadow, and Yueling's clone instantly appeared in front of Yuxuan's fuselage.

This made the audience stunned!

Neither side expected such a change.

Boom~! Long~! Long~!

But before everyone could react, there was a huge sound of breaking the air not far away, stirring the sky and shaking.

Everyone was shocked and turned to look.

Even the Moon Spirit clone looked curiously at the sound...

Looking at it, he saw an old man in green robe and an old man in black robe, rushing towards this side.

Looking at the speed and momentum of those two people, it is clear that they are all peak powers of False God, and their strength is extremely strong!

When Yu Xuanji saw the two of them, his expression changed greatly.

Yuan Chu and Tai Shi's eyes lit up, showing joy.

It turned out that the two old men were none other than the people behind the eighth and tenth divisions.

At this moment, they came early!

This time, the Tiance Clan was completely panicked.

The original Yuanchu, Taishi, and Teng Kui's ancestors made them feel unable to cope.

Now there are two more powerful powers, it seems that the heavens are going to kill the Tiance Clan!

When Yueling clone saw those two people, his eyes lit up.

He thought to himself that it was just right!

Just finished it for a pot, leaving no trouble! ¬†‚Ä¶

Chapter 638 Kill with one palm! God's Blade!

"Patriarch! Old Ancestor Ba Snake and Old Ancestor Danzhu are here! This... how can this be good?"

At this moment, Granny Yusang was a little overwhelmed, and her expression was terrified.

Yu Xuanji's heart also sank.

Old Ancestor Ba Snake and Old Ancestor Danzhu are both peak powers of False God, and anyone can easily defeat her!

But next, she has to face the ancestors of Ba Snake, Ancestor Danzhu, and the five illusory gods of Yuanchu, Taishi, and Tengkui alone!

How could she possibly handle it!

Could it be that the Tiance Clan is really going to die in his own hands?

Thinking of this, Yu Xuanji was furious!

At this moment, the two old men had already arrived at the scene.

"Fellow Daoist Bashe, fellow Daoist Danzhu, why did you come here?"

Yuan Chu, Tai Shi, and Teng Kui's ancestors greeted them with smiles.

"Three, long time no see!"

The two old men also smiled and greeted.

When these five people met, it was a chat, and they didn't take Yueling's clone and Tiance Clan seriously.

Yueling's clone looked at it for a while and then figured it out.

The blue-robed old man with eyes like snake eyes is the first strong clan in the eighth division‚Äîthe ancestor of the Ba Snake Clan, known as the Ba Snake Ancestor!

The slightly fat black-robed old man is the first strong clan in the tenth division‚Äîthe ancestor of the Danzhu clan, known as the ancestor of the Danzhu!

At this moment, Yuan Chu said excitedly: "You two, I see that the combined forces of your two divisions are still tens of thousands of miles away. It will take at least an hour or two to arrive here. Unexpectedly, the two of you arrived ahead of schedule. "

Ancestor Danzhu stroked his beard and smiled: "I see that you are approaching the Tiance Clan, and I know that the war will break out ahead of time. The old man and Brother Ba She left the team and came first."

At the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty: "So it is!"

On that map, only the positions of the patriarchs of all parties were displayed, and the positions of the hiders were not displayed.

Therefore, it is normal for Yuanchu and others to not know that the two ancestors will come.

At this moment, the ancestor of Danzhu looked around and said: "Daoist friends in the early Yuan Dynasty, it seems that you are planning to fight. This old man and brother Ba She came at the right time!"

Yuan Chu smiled and said, "It's true!"

At this time, Taishi looked at Yu Xuanji: "Miss Xuanji, Daoyou Bashe and Daoist Danzhu are here too. If you want to know the situation, surrender! As long as you are willing to return to the Suiyue Clan with me, I will protect your life!"

Until this moment, he still wanted to occupy the jade mystery.

Yu Xuanji sneered: "Humph! Taishi, what is your mind, the deity knows very well! Stop dreaming! It is impossible for the deity to surrender!"

"Hey!"

Tai shook his head and sighed.

"Yu Xuanji, you are really stubborn! If that's the case, don't blame me for waiting for the hot hand to destroy it!"

As soon as these words fall, Tai Shi will be furious.

But at this moment, a discordant voice sounded in the field.

"Noisy!"

Everyone was startled, and they followed the sound, and saw that the person who spoke was a black-haired young man, with an extraordinary temperament and a noble appearance.

This young man is naturally a Moon Spirit clone!

But in the next second, everyone found out that the Moon Spirit clone is only at the heaven level!

Seeing him standing in the middle of a group of demigod elders, it was very abrupt.

Tai Shi suddenly frowned.

From the beginning to the end, he did not notice the Moon Spirit clone.

After all, a small heaven-level realm, who would care?

Don't say it was him, Yuan Chu and Teng Kui didn't notice it either.G√©t latest ùíèovel chùíÇpters on nùíêv(e)lbj/n(.)c/ùíêm

The focus of their attention at the beginning was all on the Jade Profound Body.

But what Yueling clone said just now, anyone can hear it, that is, scolding him.

Thinking of this, Tai Shi's anger surged.

"Boy, were you talking about the deity just now?"

Taishi looked at Yueling's clone coldly.

"No~!"

The Moon Spirit clone directly denied it.

"Oh~!"

The corners of Tai Shi's mouth twitched slightly, sneering in his heart.

This little thief is really afraid of himself and dare not admit it in public, what a waste!

Then, he pressed: "Then you said 'who' was noisy?"

Yueling's clone smiled slightly, and pointed at Taishi, Yuanchu, Tengkui ancestors, Danzhu ancestors, and Bashe ancestors.

"My lord is talking about you, you, you, you, and you~! The five of you are all making noise! ‚Äã‚ÄãA group of old dogs, barking non-stop!"

Boom~!

As soon as these words fell, the audience was in an uproar!

Everyone was dumbfounded!

They couldn't believe their ears at all!

But in the next second, five roars sounded in the field!

"Little thief! Looking for death!"

"The old man hacked you!"

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

As soon as the voice fell, the five Taishi all roared violently, and rushed towards Yueling's clone.

Damn little thief!

How dare you insult their five False Gods in public!

It is simply heinous!

They're going to blast it to pieces!

At this moment, Yuanchu, Taishi, Tengkui ancestors, Danzhu ancestors, and Bashe ancestors were all about to explode with rage!

Thinking that they have always been high above, even if they are demigods, they are still in front of them, and they don't even dare to breathe.
