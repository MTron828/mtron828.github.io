That white spirit shield is definitely a good piece of equipment!

As long as this woman is killed, the spiritual shield will be his.

Om~! Om~! Om~!

At this moment, five consecutive white lights poured into his body.

The vocation has been upgraded again!

Qin Feng is in a good mood!

I saw the upgraded white light lit up, his momentum skyrocketed, and his combat power increased to 1235 stars in an instant.

At the same time, Qin Feng continued to chase and kill the woman.

"Master! Save me! Save me!"

Seeing this, the woman screamed in horror, and fled to the inner hall desperately.

But Qin Feng was killed in the blink of an eye, and the long knife fell instantly.

Swish~!

Wherever the blade passes, the space is shattered every inch,

With the trend of severing time and space, he instantly slashed behind the woman's head.

Om~!

A clear sound of heaven and earth!

On that white spiritual shield, the automatic woman flew out of her body and faced the Jinglong Blade.

Bang~!

A muffled sound!

The spirit shield was knocked flying!

The long knife continued to chop down, and it was like a broken bamboo!

This time, without the blocking of the five holy spirits of light, this spiritual shield could not stop Qin Feng's blow at all.

Kacha~!

Blood splashes!

The woman was cut in half with a knife!

A mournful roar echoed in the hall!

puff~!

A muffled sound!

The woman's body fell heavily, and an extremely dazzling white light flew from her body and poured into Qin Feng's body...

[Killing the 50-level light alienation (emperor level) successfully, the sacred sacred object - the light of the gods was exploded. 】

Cool!

Finally killed!

This time, three golden treasure chests exploded, which is very powerful!

Having said that, I killed eight bright beasts just now, and also exploded three golden treasure chests.

In this way, he has two hidden treasure chests, thirteen gold treasure chests, and two gold treasure chests, and he can make a purple diamond treasure chest.

This thought made Qin Feng happy.

However, what made him even more delighted was that the Divine Seal of Light also exploded.

That's what he wants most!

At the moment, Qin Feng walked towards the bright divine seal.

At this moment, an upgraded white light lit up on his body.

After the upgrade is completed, Qin Feng's momentum has soared, and his combat power has once again risen to the limit of 1238 stars...

At this time, Tiandao also sent a reminder.

Qin Feng's eyes lit up.

After completing this task, not only will there be 2000 attribute rewards, but also a hidden treasure chest reward, which is really rich!

This time, he was very satisfied with the harvest!

roar~!

But at this moment, deep in the inner hall, a shocking roar sounded.

The whole hall is shaking!

That roar was full of boundless anger!

In the depths of the temple, the hidden mysterious existence awakened again.

It feels the fall of the bright alienator!

This human killed its most loyal subordinate!

It's going to kill this human!

roar~!

A monstrous roar!

Rolling in from the depths of the inner hall, 3.0!

Qin Feng was shocked and couldn't help but look up into the depths of the inner hall.

There is even a monster hidden in this temple!

By the way, when the Bright Alienator fled for his life just now, he shouted for the master to save his life.

Could it be that what is hidden in the depths of this temple is her master.

Those who can be the masters of light alienators must be extremely powerful beings.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng couldn't help but take a deep breath.

At this moment, Tiandao sent a reminder again.

[Mission reminder: Your appearance awakens the master of the light alienator. It is the evil source of all events. You have triggered 1% of the event change, and the content of the task has begun to change. 】

[Task change content: Kill the source of evil, completely purify the Sunlight Canyon, and lift the Millennium Seal. 】

[Task reminder: The previous rewards will be suspended, and if you complete the final stage task, the rewards will be tripled! 】

Qin Feng was surprised and happy.

He actually triggered the secret plot that only appeared with a 1% probability.

Surprisingly, his reward was not given out.

However, as long as he completes the tasks of the final stage, the reward will be tripled.

Isn't that just 6000 points and three hidden treasure chests!

Chapter 258 The harvest is huge, the evil trial!

roar~!

The hall shakes!

Furious!

After a while, the roar from the depths of the inner hall gradually subsided.

Qin Feng ignored those and started to clear the battlefield.

After a while, he cleaned up and got six golden treasure chests, Tier 5 and Tier 4 equipment, a pass order (Sunlight Canyon), a Divine Seal of Light (Holy Relic), and the white spiritual shield.

As soon as he picked up the white spirit shield, Qin Feng couldn't help but glance at it.

[Light Sacred Shield: Tier 6 equipment, unidentified master, defense +2000, five elements resistance +100%, wind resistance +100%, lightning resistance +100%, darkness resistance +200%, light resistance +200%, Self-contained skill - Guardian of the Light. 】

[Guardian of Light: Automatically defends the Lord, and the size of the shield can be changed arbitrarily. 】

[Reminder: Without the talent of light, it cannot be recognized as the master. 】

good! good!

This is actually a sixth-order equipment, no wonder he was able to hold his own knife before.

Looking at the attributes of this bright holy shield, it is more than twice as strong as his own spinning shield.

With this in mind, Qin Feng quickly summoned the Xuantian Shield and released the blood contract.

After doing this, he broke the blood and dripped the blood to the Holy Shield of Light.

Om~!

In the next second, the Holy Shield of Light turned into a golden light, pouring into Qin Feng's body...

[Reminder: The Holy Shield of Light has successfully recognized the Lord! 】

Qin Feng also had a smile on his face.

10 So far, he has replaced the shotgun on defense, and replaced the fifth-order Rotating Sky Shield with the sixth-order Bright Holy Shield.

Having said that, Xuantian Shield and Dark Night Sabre are all of the best quality, and he wants to leave his pet Xiao Huoluan.

When the little guy reaches level 20, he will be able to transform into a human form, and it is estimated that he will be able to use equipment.

In short, Qin Feng is now a fifth-order and sixth-order equipment, and his momentum is extraordinary.

Even the equipment of the Heaven-level powerhouse is nothing more than that.
