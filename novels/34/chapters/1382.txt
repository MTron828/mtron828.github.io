Now, he has enough treasure chests in his hand, but he lacks the treasure chest synthesis card.

If there is a synthetic card, he can now close a Taoist treasure chest and open a cloud of mysterious yellow energy.

"It seems that the perfection of this "Book of Three Worlds" will have to wait a little longer!"

The mind body muttered regretfully, and put away the "Book of Three Worlds".

According to the rules of the Tao of Heaven, the more Tao-level wonders he acquires in this universe, the more cosmic feedback power he obtains.

He was recognized as the master of the first strange object, the Monument of the God of Fengchan, and received 100 million star power backfeeding from the universe!

He was recognized as the master of the second strange object, the "God Whip", and received a 200 million star power of the universe in return!

I don’t know how much combat power can be fed back if this third strange item, the Book of Three Worlds, is restored to its integrity?

There must be 300 million stars!

Thinking of this, the mind body is quite looking forward to it!

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, the sky above the secret room shook, and Tiandao sent a reminder again.

[Task reminder: congratulations on completing the SS peak-level task - the truth of God's Domain, you can get the following rewards]

[Reward players + 500 million star combat power]

[Reward player + 50,000 reputation points]

[Reward player + 20,000 times the luck value]

[Reward players to randomly awaken 5 acquired avenues]

[It is detected that the player has completed this task, and it has not exceeded three months, and the task reward will be doubled by five times]

[Therefore, the content of the reward has been changed as follows]

[Reward players + 2.5 billion star power]

[Reward player + 250,000 reputation points]

[Reward players + 100,000 times the luck value]

[Reward players to randomly awaken 25 acquired avenues]

Boom~Long~Long~!

As soon as this prompt came out, the void shook!

A golden reward beam of light descended from the sky and landed on the mind body...

In the next second, the prestige, luck, and combat power of the mind body skyrocketed wildly!

He was instantly ecstatic!

After a long time, all rewards will end!

The mind body slowly opened his eyes, and his eyes were full of joy!

The reward for this mission is really generous!

correct!

After this series of rewards, I don't know how the body strength has changed?

With this in mind, the mind body opened the panel and checked it out.

[Full-level Human]: The Heavenly Servant (Advanced)

[Qin Yuan Universe]: Lord of the Universe (Advanced)

[Full-level vocation]: Full-level Hongmeng Supreme

[Air Luck]: 1.23 million times

【Reputation】: 7.29 million points

[Xiantian Avenue]: 39

[Total number of avenues]: 1897

[Basic combat power]: 19.51 trillion stars

After reading it, the mind body showed a satisfied smile.

The combat power has soared to 19.51 trillion, not far from the goal of 20 trillion.

When the main body's combat power exceeds 20 trillion, plus the sacrifices of many subordinates' combat power, it can reach 23 trillion.

At that time, the probability of the ontology acquiring inheritance will reach 50%.

With this thought, the mind body is full of expectations!

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, Tiandao came to remind again

[Task reminder: You have completed the SS pinnacle-level God's Domain Truth quest, and the follow-up quest - SSS-level God's Domain Revenge has been automatically activated]

[The content of the SSS-level "God's Domain Revenge" is as follows]

【one. Obtain the inheritance of Zixiao and control the Zixiao Palace]

【two. Beheading the Great Sacrifice Heaven]

【three. Kill Rahu]

【Four. Find out the real murderer

[Reminder: Each time you complete one of the contents, you can get rich rewards]

[Reminder: After completing all the content, you can give half of the treasures that the mysterious Heaven Servant wants to get]

The mind body's eyes lit up with surprises!

New mission activated!

This is the second SSS-level mission that Ontology has obtained!

The first SSS level mission is to become the master of the universe and be promoted to full level!

This second SSS-level mission is God's Domain Revenge!

Having said that, even if there is no such task, Qin Feng also wants to avenge the Lord of the Judgment Domain.

After all, the Judgment Domain Lord is Qin Feng's bloodline ancestor!

How can we not avenge the revenge of our ancestors? !

Besides, even if he didn't want to take revenge, Da Jitian, Luo Hu, and the real murderer behind the scenes wouldn't necessarily let him go!

Now it's good, with this SSS-level mission activated, he can take revenge naturally!

At the same time, in the process of resurrection, he can also get rich quest rewards, which is also a good thing!

Thinking of this, the mind body raised his head slightly, his eyes penetrated the heavens and the world, saw the outside world, and also saw the main body...

I saw the starry sky square, more and more onlookers.

At this time, no one in the audience paid attention to Qin Feng!

In that corner, Qingdi and Rafi both looked at Qin Feng with astonishment.

I saw Qin Feng was closing his eyes, a faint aura of avenue lit up on his body, and his momentum seemed to be increasing!

The three talents chatted for a while, and Qin Feng's momentum increased again and again, which made the two Qingdi amazed!

Fortunately, Qin Feng has restrained himself and did not let those momentum changes go out!

Otherwise, the audience will be shocked!

After a while, all visions disappeared!

Qin Feng also slowly opened his eyes, with a hint of joy in his eyes.

"Brother Qin Feng, your strength has improved again?"

The Qing Emperor asked quickly, with a concerned look on his face.

Qin Feng laughed without saying a word!

Rafi also asked with concern: "Lord Qin Feng, I don't know how strong you are now? It should be not far from the half-step eternity, right?"

Qin Feng was slightly taken aback!

Not far from half-step eternity? !

Immediately, he wanted to understand, and couldn't help but smile.

It seems that both Qingdi underestimated his strength and thought he had not reached half-step eternity.

At the moment, he smiled and said: "Half-step eternal strength should be there!"

Boom~!

This is an understatement, but it surprised the two of Qingdi.

Oh my God!

Qin Feng is the master of the **** realm!

His strength has reached half-step eternity!

This is far beyond their estimates and beyond the expectations of Tianzun!

At the moment, Qingdi said excitedly: "That's great! Brother Qin Feng, you really didn't let Tianzun down! Tianzun was originally worried that your strength is less than half a step into eternity, and your next inheritance assessment will be Great disadvantage!"

"Even if you are a descendant of the bloodline of the Judgment Domain Lord, and you are biased by the spirit of inheritance in the secret realm, you will not take advantage of it! For this reason, Tianzun is extremely worried! Because before this, Tianzun has deduced it, this time it will be Zixiao. The inheritance is opened for the last time!"

"Whose inheritance will fall? After this year's inheritance assessment, the truth will be revealed. If Brother Qin Feng's strength is less than half a step eternal, I'm afraid there is no chance of even 10%!"

"It's good now! Brother Qin Feng has half a step of eternal strength, so there is a chance of inheriting it. We finally see a glimmer of hope in the trial of God's Domain!"

Rafi was also full of smiles: "Yeah! We thought that this time there might not even be a 10% chance! I didn't expect that Mr. Qin Feng's level of excellence far exceeded my expectations!"

Speaking of which, Raphael was full of emotion!

Qin Feng laughed without saying a word!

Obviously, these two guys still far underestimated his strength!

He is not half-step eternity, but has far surpassed half-step eternity and is above the five absolutes.

It can be said that Qin Feng is now the number one powerhouse under the Eternal Realm!

However, Qin Feng will not say this!

The so-called: things are made secret, and words are leaked!

When the strength has reached the current level, Qin Feng has deeply realized that the heavens are mighty and the avenues are small!

Sometimes a word that is said inadvertently will reveal some secrets!

Therefore, he will not easily reveal his strength, so as not to be spied on the secret in advance

It is not a bad thing to make the two Qingdi misunderstand in this way.

At this time, Emperor Qing said again: "That's right! Brother Qin Feng, Lord Tianzun also asked me to tell you! After entering the Zixiao Palace, you should go to the 'Achievement' assessment first and be promoted to God King!"

"Wait until you are promoted to the Queen of God, and then go to participate in the inheritance assessment, it will be more beneficial to you!"

Rafi echoed: "Yes! Master Qin Feng, you must be promoted to God King first!"

Qin Feng nodded with a smile: "I'm planning to do this! By the way, Brother Qingdi, how long does it usually take for the God King assessment?"

Emperor Qing pondered for a while and said, "This is uncertain! The Divine King assessment is both an examination of aspirations! Nine cauldrons in the world! Nine cauldrons in Dingzhen! The Divine King at the cauldron level has the least difficulty in the assessment and the least benefits!"

"The benefits of a **** king at the second tripod level are doubled, but the difficulty of the assessment is also several times more difficult. By analogy, the **** king at the nine tripod level has the most difficult assessment and gains the most benefits!"

"Actually, 99.9% of the **** kings in this world are the **** kings of the first rank. Only one **** king out of a thousand **** kings can reach the second rank. They are the best among the best!"

"As for the God King at the Sanding level, that is only one out of 10,000 God Kings, and it is even more unimaginable. As for the God King at the Jiuding level, since the entire universe was born, there has not been one!"Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Speaking of which, Qingdi was sighing!

Afterwards, he added: "In short, the challenge is different, the difficulty of the assessment is different, and the time spent is different. Generally speaking, the assessment time is no more than three days at most!"

Qin Feng nodded slightly: "Three days! It is exactly three days from the opening to closing of the entrance of Zixiao Palace. When the entrance of Zixiao Palace closes, it is also the time when the inheritance assessment starts. The time is just in time!"
