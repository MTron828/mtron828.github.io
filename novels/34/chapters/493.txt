Not long after Yao Ji and the others left, a cloud of white mist appeared on the sea surface again.

After a while, the white fog condensed into a human form and turned into an old man with white hair and a white robe.

The mysterious old man looked at the backs of the two of them, hehe smiled, his figure flickered, and he disappeared out of thin air again...

At the same time, there was silence in the Wind Clan residence.

Long Yuan's children have long been transferred away by Qin Feng.

Some went to the Lei Clan station, and some went to the Ze Clan station.

There are more than 8,000 people participating in the Shengwu assessment.

In the entire station, only the Mirage clone stayed behind.

Of course, this was also intentionally arranged by Qin Feng.

He was also worried that the powerful Yao clan came in revenge, and he couldn't take care of the townspeople, so he let them leave first...

In this way, even if he can't deal with a strong enemy, a person can retreat calmly without worries.

But in the center of the station, there is a luxurious two-story wooden building.

That is Qin Feng's wooden house projection.

At this moment, a white light spot the size of a soy bean was floating in the projected wooden house, in a certain secret room.

That is exactly the space node of zero-dimensional space.

The Mirage clone sat cross-legged and watched the chat channel silently while guarding the space node.

As Qin Feng's clone, he can also operate some interface functions.

At this time, the chat channel was very lively.

Everyone is in a very good mood!

"Haha! Brothers, Big Brother Lei Jue just passed the best foundation building!"

"Wow! This is so good!"

"Upstairs, how powerful is Lei Jue?"

"More than 1,700 stars!"

"My God! Boss Lei Jue is too powerful! Only after breaking through to the realm of the prefecture level, he has the strength of the pinnacle of the prefecture level. As long as Boss Lei Jue increases his combat power by 300 stars, he can reach the strength of the first level of heaven. already."

"Yeah! Having said that, Boss Liu Xuan is even more powerful. After he completed the high-grade foundation building, his combat power has reached more than 1,900 stars, and he is closer to the first level of heaven!"

"Elder Qishan is also very powerful! He is now 1,800 stars!"

"And Longshan, Wu Yong, and Liu Yuan, they also all have 1,600-star combat power!"

"Haha! Brother, our Longyuan Town is really getting stronger and stronger. I made a rough calculation. At present, more than 6,000 people have completed the foundation building, and more than 70% are high-grade foundation building. The combat power exceeds 1,000 stars. There are more than 2,000 people!"

"So many! I didn't even dare to think about it before!"

"Haha! Upstairs, after breaking through to the earth-level realm, Shouyuan will be raised to 300 years old. If you are on Blue Star, can you imagine such a thing?"

"It's really unimaginable! According to such a development, it is not impossible for all of our Long Yuan children to have the same longevity as the sky!"

"If that's the case, I can't wait to become a god. We Longyuan are one of the gods. The boss is the king of the gods! Haha!"

The crowd laughed.

One by one, the joy is beyond words.

The Mirage clone watched all this silently, smiling without saying a word.

At this moment, he was quite pleased.

Before you know it, there are more than 2,000 townspeople with a battle strength of 1,000 stars.

Even better, the Lei Clan and Ze Clan's land deed cards were also obtained.

At that time, as long as the body has refined the two land deed cards, it will be able to immediately unlock the 1,000-star combat power feedback.

At that moment, the main body can get 2,000 people's feedback, that is, 600,000 attributes.

This can make the strength of the body increase by leaps and bounds.

Just thinking about it made his heart burn.

Of course, there are definitely more than 2,000 people in Longyuan Town whose combat power has exceeded 1,000 stars.

After everyone has completed the Shengwu assessment, it is estimated that more than 5,000 people who have broken through a thousand stars will be able to reach them.

Naturally, the more the number, the better!

After the 1,000-star feedback is unlocked, the next step is to unlock the 2,000-star permission.

In short, the stronger the townspeople of Longyuan, the more benefits Qin Feng will get, and the stronger he will be...

The Mirage clone is looking forward more and more to the future development.

"Huh! This is?"

Suddenly, he suddenly raised his head and looked in the direction of the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãTen Thousand Tribulations

It turned out that his divine sense had already scanned it, and two figures were flying over the jungle two hundred miles away, flying towards the Chaofeng Clan's station.

Of those two figures, one was a bald man in red, and the other was a middle-aged man with a cold face.

The speed of the two of them is extremely fast, and they have reached the level of the middle stage of the ninth layer!

The phantom avatar's expression changed slightly.

The enemy should be here!

It seemed that the people who came were two mid-ninth-level powerhouses, and they should be the Yaotian Clan Chief and his helpers.

Looking at the situation, they haven't used the 'Suppressing God', so the speed has not exploded to the peak of the ninth level.

The phantom avatar guessed right, and the people who came were Yao Ji and Xue Shura.

"It's finally here!"

The Mirage clone stood up silently and looked up in the direction of the enemy...

I don't know which of the two is the patriarch of the Yaotian clan?Vissit nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for ùíèew ùíèovels

Destroying the Yaotian Clan and capturing the Yaotian Clan's sacred artifact is the mission goal of Longyuan Town!

Now, the mission goal is approaching actively!

This time, he might as well just push the boat directly, kill the Yaotian Clan Chief, take away his "Suppressing Heavenly Artifact", and complete the double A-level mission by the way.

Having said that, what exactly is the 'Suppressing Heavenly Artifact' of the Yaotian Clan?

It seems very mysterious!

The phantom avatar silently looked at the direction of the enemy, and the two Yao Ji were getting closer.

The body can be‚Ä¶

The Mirage clone turned to look at the space node again.

He could sense that in the zero-degree space, the body's refining of the high-grade unicorn blood essence only reached 90%.

When the two of them arrive at the Wind Clan's station, the body will not be able to finish refining!

It seems that he has to go to stop it and delay the main body for a while.

Thinking of this, the Mirage clone will close the chat channel and prepare to go

At this moment, he saw Liu Xuan's head jump.

Liu Xuan: "Brothers, the Lei Clan and Ze Clan have been taken over by our Longyuan Town. Now there seems to be no one in the Wind Clan station, only the boss is staying there. Those who have completed the foundation building, come back to the Wind Clan station with me. stationed."

Seeing this, the Mirage clone hurriedly used Qin Feng's name to issue instructions.

Qin Feng: "Liu Xuan, after you finish the assessment, go back to the Yuan clan station and stand by, don't come to the Feng clan station!"

Liu Xuan: "Boss, what's wrong?"

Qin Feng: "There are two heaven-level ninth-level powerhouses attacking! It is estimated that they are two ninth-level peaks!"

As soon as these words fell, the chat channel was in an uproar!

OMG!

Two ninth-level peak powerhouses!

Long Yuan was shocked up and down!

In their opinion, the strength of the boss should be around the mid-level nine.

Suddenly, two peak ninth-level powerhouses came, will the boss be okay?

Thinking of this, everyone began to worry about Qin Feng.

Mirage clone ignores this

After he left the chat channel, he dodged and left the cabin...

A few minutes later, the Wind Clan station, sixty or seventy miles away, above a jungle

"Brother Shura, where is the Wind Clan station!"

At this moment, Yao Ji pointed to the distance with a look of joy.

From his angle, he could vaguely see the outline of the Wind Clan station.

Blood Shura smiled: "I hope Qin Feng is there! Let's go!"

At the moment, the two continued on their way.

In a blink of an eye, the two had traveled more than 30 miles, and there were only 30 to 40 miles left from the Wind Clan station.

At this moment, they saw a figure flying directly towards them from the direction of the Wind Clan's station.

"Hey! Someone is coming!"

Yao Ji and the two were slightly surprised, they stopped and looked at the people who came.

Now that it's a rest period, won't the guardians and the secretaries be messing around?

In just a moment, the person who came was thousands of feet away.

They also saw clearly that the person who came was a handsome young man with a luxurious temperament.

This person is naturally a mirage clone!

At the moment, Yaoji and both of them probed towards the phantom avatar at the same time.

At the same moment, the Mirage clone also saw the two of them clearly.

He also looked at Yaoji and walked away.
