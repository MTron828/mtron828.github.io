The power of the Dao on Ran Deng's body is looming, and it is not the Dao that Qin Feng is familiar with.

"Back to... master! What Ran Deng felt when he was alive... what I realized was... the Great Dao of Yin and Yang!"

Burning Lamp replied respectfully.

After hearing this, Ji Yang's eyes lit up, and there was a surprise in his eyes.

Yin and Yang Avenue!

That is also one of the innate avenues!

He really didn't see that this ancient **** of burning the lamp was so good before, but he was actually the king of the gods who was based on the congenital avenue!

Among the **** kings, the one who achieves the position of **** king with the innate avenue is the strongest, and can crush the same level.

What makes Jiyang even more happy is that this lantern has mastered the avenue of yin and yang. After the avenue of the lantern is fully restored, he can use the vocation skill 'belief sharing' to perceive this avenue from the lantern!

In this way, he can master another avenue, which is still the innate avenue!

Although the Yin-Yang Avenue is ranked at the bottom of the Innate Avenues, none of the Innate Avenues should be underestimated!

The more you think about the anode body, the more satisfied you are!

Boom~Long~Long~!

But at this moment, the sky suddenly shook, and a beam of light descended from the sky and landed in front of the lamp.

Then, a black token slowly fell along the beam of light...

Seeing this scene, both the anode body and the burning lamp were stunned.

After a while, the token came to the two of them,

Jiyang body subconsciously took the token and probed...

I saw the information in the token is as follows...

„ÄêPlayer„Äë: The Ancient God of Burning Lamp

[Daojing Score]: 0 points

Seeing this, Jiyang Ontology smiled!

It seems that Ran Deng has been recognized by Tiandao as a player.

Before this, Heavenly Dao would not recognize it, after all, corpse puppets are not living creatures.

Otherwise, he would not be able to bring the Ancient God of Burning Lamp into the Holy Land.

Even if it is placed in the chaotic space, it cannot be brought in.

It should be that the burning lamp has awakened some of the power of the Dao, and some changes have taken place in essence before it is recognized by the Dao of Heaven.

In short, he can have one more subordinate to help him earn Daojing...

Chapter 811: Pure White Lotus! The shadow of the lotus!

"Master! This token is"

The ancient **** of burning lamp looked at the token in his hand and was a little puzzled.

"This is Tiandao's recognition of your identity. From now on, you are also a member of the Holy Land."

At the moment, Jiyang Ontology simply explained the rules in the Holy Land once.

After listening to the burning lamp, the slightly green eyes showed joy.

"Lord... man, so... so, can I go to... secret territory to get... resources?"

Ji Yang's body smiled and nodded: "That's right! The realm you show is the main **** realm, then you can choose to go to the main **** area! Maybe, there are spirits that restore soul power in that area!"

The lamp was overjoyed: "Master! I'll go right now!"

With this excitement, he spoke a little more quickly.

Ji Yang's body smiled and said, "Go!"

Immediately, the ancient **** of burning lamp resigned respectfully and walked towards the main **** area.

He chose Space Avenue

Looking at the back of the lamp leaving, Ji Yang's eyes are full of expectations

With the combat power of 4 billion stars, it is not a big problem for players who can sweep the main **** zone to earn the full amount.

Burning the lamp has a harvest, it means that he has a harvest!

With this thought, Jiyang Ontology is even more looking forward to it!

In a blink of an eye, the Ancient God of Burning Lamp entered the secret realm.

Ji Yang's body also turned around and walked towards the special secret realm of the next grade...

At this moment, at the entrance of the low-grade secret realm, a white light lit up, and the very yin body appeared out of thin air.

It turned out that the time limit for the secret realm was up, and the extreme yin body was forcibly teleported out!

The two bodies looked at each other and smiled!

Afterwards, the very yin body went to the special secret realm of the middle grade.

The anode body continues to move towards the special secret realm of low-grade products

In a blink of an eye, Ji Yang's body entered the secret realm of low-grade products.

Just as he entered the secret realm, Tiandao sent a reminder.

[Holy Land Reminder: Players are welcome to enter the low-level special secret realm, you are the second person to step into this secret realm]

[Holy Land Reminder: Only the first person to enter this secret realm can obtain information about the number of guardian beasts]

[Holy Land Reminder: Players stay in this secret territory for no more than 30 minutes]

[Time starts now: 1]

Hearing this prompt, Ji Yang Ontology laughed!

It turned out that only the first person who stepped into the special secret realm had the right to know the number of guardian beasts in the special secret realm.

This is a disguised reward from Heaven to the outstanding!

The interesting thing is that he also knows the information that the body of the extreme yin knows, but the few people who come in later will know nothing!

This is definitely a good thing for Qin Feng!

Thinking of this, Ji Yang's body smiled and flew towards the depths of the secret realm!

His goal is very clear, that is, the land of golden light in the depths of the sea.

The ultimate demon **** in the secret territory of this layer should be hiding in that place.

With the information base of the extremely yin body, he has avoided many detours, and his action efficiency is extremely high.

In the blink of an eye, the figure of Jiyang body disappeared into the sky

It didn't take long for him to arrive near the sea area over there.

At this moment, the outside square, the king-level area, at the entrance of Devouring Avenue, lit up with a white light.

An old man in a golden robe appeared out of thin air!

This man is the Emperor Jin!

As soon as he appeared, he looked around.

I saw that the entire square was empty, and there were no players.

"Sure enough!"

The corners of Jin Di's mouth twitched slightly, revealing a smug smile.

In just half an hour, he earned 1 point.

I'm afraid that none of the players in the No. 2 safety zone can compare with him.

Of course, he was able to do it so fast, but there were 6 subordinates who sacrificed their time and interests to help him earn some points.

With his own strength, he can earn more than 60 points in half an hour.

However, those are not important anymore!

As long as he is the first person to enter the low-grade special secret realm, that's enough!

With this in mind, Emperor Jin strode to the secret realm of the next grade.

In just a moment, he arrived at the entrance to the secret realm.

The low-grade special secret realm is right in front of you!

The treasures inside must be extremely rich!

He is the first player to enter and should get the most benefits.

With this in mind, Emperor Jin stepped into the Gate of Light with excitement!

After a whirl of white light, Emperor Jin became firm on both feet, and his eyes lit up as he entered the secret realm.

Looking around, the secret realm is extremely vast, and there is no end in sight. The aura in the air is extremely rich, almost ten times that of the king-level area!

"The special secret realm is different! The concentration of light aura is ten times that of the king-level area! Presumably, there are more treasures here!"

Emperor Jin murmured in his heart that he was about to disperse his consciousness and explore the secret realm.

At this moment, Tiandao sent a reminder.

[Holy Land Reminder: Players are welcome to enter the low-level special secret realm, you are the third person to step into this secret realm]

[Holy Land Reminder: Players stay in this secret territory for no more than 30 minutes]

[Time starts now: 1]

Boom~!

Hearing the prompt, Emperor Jin was shocked and dumbfounded!

What? !

Is he the third one to enter?

how can that be!

He is a powerful mid-term **** king, and he has six quasi-god king subordinates to assist him. Only in such a short period of time can he obtain the qualification to enter the low-grade secret realm!

With such efficiency, who else can be faster than him? !

Is it the Qing Emperor? !

But even if Emperor Qing came in, he should be the second entrant, not the third!ChùíÜ√™ck out lùíÇtùíÜst ùíèùíêvùíÜlùíî on novùíÜl/bin(.)cùíêm

who? !

Who is the other person? !

Jindi's heart is messed up!

He really couldn't think of anyone other than Qingdi who could come in so quickly.

Is it the Purple Emperor?

impossible!

Zi Di and him are in the same group, and the two have already divided their labor.

His first goal is the low-grade secret realm, and Zidi's first goal is the middle-grade secret realm!

It is absolutely impossible for Emperor Zi to enter at this time?

"Is it one of the six **** kings? Impossible! Those six **** kings are only in the early days of **** kings! Just by their strength, one of them can be faster than this old man!"

Jindi murmured in his heart!

And his residence time in the secret territory has been continuously counting.

Seeing this, Emperor Jin became anxious, and a sense of urgency emerged from his heart!

This secret realm can only stay for half an hour!
