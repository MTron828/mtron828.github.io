The wood spirit clone led seven thousand disciples to attack the eastern region

Yueling clone led seven thousand disciples to attack the western region

The Bing Ling clone led seven thousand disciples to attack the northern area

And there are more than 1,000 people left behind in Longyuan's forces, and the phantom avatars are personally guarded, and they are always ready to help children from all walks of life...

In this way, Longyuan Town vigorously started the battle of power expansion...

At the same time, inside the Holy Land, the No. 73 Safe Zone Square.

All the powerhouses are silently waiting for the opening of the opportunity.

Before I knew it, there were only two minutes left before the opportunity opened.

Feng Xi became anxious.

"Sister Luan'er, isn't the master out yet? There are only two minutes left, and the opportunity is about to open."

Feng Xi's tone was full of anxiety.

"Not yet! Probably soon!"

Xiao Luan'er was also a little restless.

She is Qin Feng's psychic battle pet and Qin Feng's light messenger. The telepathy between the two is extremely strong.

If Qin Feng leaves the customs, she will sense it immediately.

Right now, she can clearly sense that her father hasn't left the customs yet!

But the opportunity is about to open, time is running out, she is naturally anxious.

"Hey! Only 2 minutes left!"

Feng Xi looked around anxiously,

I saw those powerhouses, looking up at the sky from time to time, showing anxiety on their faces.

Obviously, these powerhouses can't wait.

Xiao Luan took a deep breath and was about to say something.

At this moment, she seemed to sense something, her eyes lit up, and her eyes were full of joy...

At the same time, in the zero-degree space, in the secret room of cultivation.

Qin Feng's whole body is lit with red light, and his body is roaring constantly, and his momentum is skyrocketing wildly all the way!

rumbling...

At this moment, his body was roaring violently...

Tiandao also sent a reminder...

[Phoenix blood essence (top grade) refining is complete! Your basic combat power is increased to 201,700 stars. „Äë

[Phoenix blood essence (top grade) refining is complete! Your bloodline attributes of gold, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, thunder, light, and darkness are all complete, reaching the advanced standard...]

[Your bloodline talent is being promoted to SS rank...]

„ÄêSuccessful promotion! Congratulations, your bloodline talent has reached SS level, and your basic combat power has skyrocketed to 230,000 stars. „Äë

[Your bloodline talent has been promoted to SS level, and your whole body has been greatly strengthened...]

[Your bloodline talent has been promoted to SS rank, and the power of the bloodline inheritance skill 'Tongtian Tyrant Body' has been increased by 30 times, and it has been promoted to the ninth-order skill. „Äë

Boom!

For a long time, various visions gradually disappeared, and everything returned to peace!

Qin Feng also slowly opened his eyes, full of joy.

His bloodline talent finally broke through, and his strength skyrocketed a lot!

Since then, he has finally mastered his first SS-level talent.

Chapter 449: Refining Divine Essence! Magical use of time!

good! good!

The basic combat power has skyrocketed to 230,000 stars, plus the power of foundation building is 240,000 stars.

If he reunites with Xiao Luan'er, the Blade Against God, and borrows Qiyue's combat power, the combined combat power can reach about 345,000 stars.

Qin Feng calculated silently and was very satisfied.

In addition, if he has mastered a variety of S-level talents, one SS-level talent, then the comprehensive strength should be infinitely close to the threshold of the middle stage of the demigod.

The initial combat power of the demigods ranges from 200,000 to 400,000 stars.

The mid-term combat power of the demigods ranges from 400,000 to 600,000 stars.

The comprehensive strength is close to the threshold of the mid-term demigod, which means that Qin Feng's strength is close to the best among the powerhouses.

You must know that only 20% of the powerhouses in the square are in the middle stage of demigods, and half of them are at the peak of demigods.

Then 70% are in the early stage of demigods, and half are in the peak of heaven.

Therefore, if the strength reaches the middle stage of the demigod, it belongs to the upper class.

And Qin Feng's current comprehensive strength is infinitely close to the middle stage of the demigod, so it is naturally close to the superior.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng was very satisfied.

"Count the time, it should start soon!"

Qin Feng murmured and turned into a white light that disappeared out of thin air.

The next second, he appeared beside Xiao Luan'er.

"dad!"

Little Luan is happy.

"Master, you finally came out!"

Feng Xi also breathed a sigh of relief, and a smile appeared on her beautiful face, which was particularly seductive.

Qin Feng smiled.

He could feel that Feng Xi really cared about him.

Afterwards, he waved again and summoned Qiyue.

"Master, are you going to start?"

As soon as Qi Yue appeared, she asked curiously.

"Almost!"

Qin Feng muttered and looked at the square.

At this time, the number of people in this safe area is basically complete.

Qin Feng calculated silently.

After a while, he figured out that there were a total of 4,002 players in the field.

If you count 40 players in a star world, there should be 4,000 people.

Now there are two more people, it is precisely because of the four people who came to Longyuan Town.

In other words, Longyuan Town took a big advantage in terms of numbers.

Many forces have only one person, and only a few excellent forces have two people, and the number of Longyuan Town is twice as many as those excellent forces.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng felt overjoyed.

Boom!

At this moment, the sky above the square suddenly shook.

Everyone was surprised and looked up.

The ethereal voice of Tiandao sounded in the sky above the square...

„ÄêThe entrance is closed! The Holy Land opportunity is officially opened! „Äë

[The first round of opportunities is the 'Entry Reward' opportunity, called 'Shen Yuan Refining'. „Äë

[Rule: Players absorb Divine Essence as much as possible, and each refining Divine Essence will bring you huge benefits. „Äë

[Rule: The number of refining divine essences depends entirely on one‚Äôs own ability. No competition for other divine essences is allowed, and no one is allowed to kill each other. Violators are immediately kicked out of the Holy Land. „Äë

[Rule: Refining a Divine Essence can get one point. The game will list the points ranking according to the number of points. There will be additional rewards for entering the top 100. „Äë

[Rules: The ranking of the competition is only based on the players in the safety zone. „Äë

[Rules: The time for this opportunity is 1 hour. „Äë

[Reminder: The points of the game also have a great influence and help on the follow-up opportunities. Please earn points as much as possible. „Äë

[Reminder: All players please be prepared, and start the ‚ÄòShen Yuan Refining‚Äô in three minutes]‚Ä¶

boom!

As soon as the news came out, there was a commotion in the audience, and the powerhouses were talking excitedly.

"It turns out that the first round of opportunity was 'Shen Yuan Refining'! This is a great opportunity!"

"Yeah! That Divine Essence will be of great help to my improvement in strength!"

"Unfortunately! Divine Essence is not so easy to refine. The stronger the strength, the faster it is refined. Like us in the early stage of demigods, I'm afraid that we won't be able to refine one in ten minutes."

"Haha! I waited for the early demigods to be fine. If they are those with heaven-level strength, I'm afraid they won't be able to refine one in half an hour. After an hour, it's not bad to be able to refine two."

"When you say this, this deity remembers the three prefecture-level realms before. With their strength, I'm afraid they won't be able to refine one in an hour. If they can't refine it, it's equal to the first chance, and they will participate in vain. !"

"Haha! That's it!"

"I want the old man to see that it is a waste of opportunity to let the prefecture-level realm come in!"

"Haha! It doesn't matter what I'm waiting for. Wouldn't it be better for them to get nothing? That's how it should be!"

As soon as these words fell, many people looked at Qin Feng intentionally or unintentionally.

Looking at this, many strong people are a little confused.

Isn't it three prefectures?

How did it become four?

"Strange! It's not three prefecture-level, how come it has become four?"

"Hey! It's true! Forget it, it doesn't matter whether they are three or four, these guys are not worthy of attention. It's a reminder from heaven that there will be points for refining Divine Essence, and there are points rankings, which seem to be very beneficial!"

"Of course the benefits are great! However, there will be rewards only if you enter the top 100. This has nothing to do with me!"

"Yeah! There are more than 100 people at the peak of the demigods on the 73rd square! Some of the peak of the demigods have no chance to enter the top 100, so I don't even need to think about it."REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

"Hey! Brother, with this opportunity, is there really no way for a demigod to compete with the peak of a demigod in the early stage?"

"Haha! As far as I know, it takes about 10 minutes to refine a 'divine essence' in the initial stage of a demigod, about 5 minutes in the middle stage of a demigod, and about 2 minutes at the peak of a demigod. Do you think it can be compared?"

"Uh! That's it! It really can't compare to the pinnacle of a demigod!"

"Brother, don't think too much. I'll get ready soon! The chance will start soon!"

"right!"

All the way through the voice, all the strong people sat cross-legged, waiting for the first opportunity to open...

In the corner, Qin Feng and the four saw this scene, and they also sat cross-legged and got ready.

This preparation is complete, Xiao Luan'er muttered.

"Dad, the tone of those guys just now seemed to be talking about us."

Qi Yue said bitterly: "Luan'er, they are talking about us. The four of us are in the field-level realm."

Xiao Luan'er suddenly said annoyed: "These guys are really annoying! Do they look down on us like that? They even said that we can't refine one of them."

Qiyue muttered: "That's right! Don't look at how few of us are at the Earth-level realm, but our strength has reached the heaven-level realm. Even if the refining is slow, it is no problem to refine a Divine Essence within an hour."

Feng Xi also nodded: "That's true! Especially the master, whose strength is comparable to the initial stage of a demigod, and should be able to refine a divine essence within ten minutes."
