He relied on his own strength to shock everyone, not his background strength!

Such people are even more terrifying!

Feeling the awe around him, Yexi raised his chin slightly, and his expression became more and more arrogant.

Soon, he walked to Qin Feng!

"'" friend, it's your turn! "

As soon as these words fell, everyone thought of Qin Feng, and their eyes fell on Qin Feng again.

This kid is destined to lose face!

Everyone shook their heads with a wry smile!

In the crowd, the woman in the red dress sighed deeply!

Without waiting for everyone to think about it, Qin Feng smiled slightly and walked directly to the test monument

Seeing this scene, Ye Xi frowned slightly.

This kid's calmness is somewhat unexpected!

Does this kid really have some trump cards?

But before he could think about it, Elder Sakya brought his subordinates and walked over with a look of joy.

"Congratulations, Young Master! Congrats Young Master! You really won the first place in the Divine Realm of Light in this one! The old man admires it extremely!"

"Yeah! The talent of the young master is beyond my reach!"

All the subordinates are flattering enthusiastically!

Of course, they also sincerely admired Yeshi.

Hearing the flattery made Yehi happy.

He smiled and said, "This is not the time to talk about those things, I'll wait to see the results of that kid first!"

Sakya stroked his beard and said with a smile: "Young Master, how can he compare with the Young Master just because he was born from a pheasant power? Look at it or not! It is destined to lose! The old man has already thought that when he apologizes later The embarrassing appearance!"

As soon as these words fell, several people smiled knowingly.

At this moment, Qin Feng stepped onto the test bench and put his token into the card slot!

The monument was instantly activated, and a faint aura lit up.

Then, Qin Feng pressed the crystal ball on the altar with one hand.
