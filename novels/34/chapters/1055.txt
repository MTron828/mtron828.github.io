Immediately afterwards, the infinite purple gold divine power also poured into the godhead golden wheel, and began to strengthen the godhead golden wheel...

[Double Daozi is being promoted! Your body is being strengthened by divine power]

[Double Daozi is being promoted! Your blood is being strengthened by divine power]

[Double Daozi is being promoted! Your bones are being strengthened by divine power]

[Double Daozi is being promoted! Your soul body is being strengthened by divine power]

[Double Daozi is being promoted! Your godhead golden wheel is being strengthened by divine power]

[You are being continuously strengthened, your combat power has increased by 5.3 million stars]

[You are being continuously strengthened, your combat power has increased by 5.1 million stars]

[You are being continuously strengthened, your combat power has increased by 5.4 million stars]

At this moment, Qin Feng, from the body to the soul, to the godhead, is constantly being strengthened by divine power

The momentum of his whole person is soaring wildly all the way!

The ever-increasing pleasure spread in his heart once again.

At the same time Qin Feng was promoted, the Blue Star Realm was outside the planetary barrier.

The strength of the four avatars also soared simultaneously!

As a result, their slaughter against the God of Lucy has been greatly increased!

The aura of the soul power of the Lucifer God suddenly fell madly!

The mournful wailing echoed in the starry sky!

At this time, his soul power aura was only one-third of the original, and he was not far from a complete collapse.

"Forgive your life! Lord Qin Qinfeng! Forgive your life! Ah~~!"

At this moment, Lucifer was completely panicked!

He desperately howled and begged for mercy!

The four avatars naturally ignored it and continued to bombard wildly!

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

For a time, the blood mist flew and screamed again and again!

Inside the barrier, everyone was dumbfounded!

"Everyone! Master Qin Qinfeng's strength seems to be getting stronger all the time! Does the old man have no dazzling eyes?"

¬∑

A white-haired old man looked ahead with a look of horror.

At this moment, he was so shocked that he was speechless.

The performance of the four avatars is too shocking, and they have been improving their strength.

He couldn't imagine how the four clones did it.

"Fellow Daoist, you have no dazzling eyes! Lord Qin Feng's strength is indeed improving all the time, and it is also improving very fast!"

"It's amazing! The old man thought that the quasi-god king could last for about an hour. Now it seems that he can't even last for twenty minutes!"

"Yeah! Master Qin Feng and his three avatars are too surprising!"

The audience was amazed!

In the crowd, Raphael was also amazed!

Qin Feng's performance is far beyond his imagination!

It seems that he will take action before Qin Feng comes out.

As soon as Lucifer died, it was time for him to take action.

With this in mind, he silently looked at the battlefield ahead and waited quietly.

At the same time, Qin Feng continued to advance in the temple!

Time flies!

In the blink of an eye, a quarter of an hour passed.

At this time, on the starry sky altar!

Qin Feng's whole body shines brightly, and the golden wheel of Godhead behind his head has changed from one to two, exuding an extremely sacred atmosphere, reflecting the entire starry sky.

At this moment, the altar began to stop, and the divine light in the air was slowly dissipating.

Heaven also sent a reminder

Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief and got up slowly.

This breakthrough, his combat power reached 10.7 billion stars, just over the threshold of the king of gods!

Qin Feng is extremely satisfied with such an improvement!

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, Tiandao came to remind again

[The personal special reward of 'Chief Daozi' will be distributed now] Soil.

Chapter 788 Special Rewards! Act for the sky!

Qin Feng raised his head with joy and looked up at the starry sky...Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

Tiandao continues to send reminders...

„ÄêChief Daozi's special rewards are as follows„Äë

[Reward for the new title chance task of 'Chief Daozi' - The Heavenly Servant]

[Those who act for the sky: walk the way for the sky, respect the identity, only second to the way of heaven]

[Reminder: Those who want to become the Tao of Heaven must first become those who replace Heaven]

Boom~!

Hearing this prompt, Qin Feng was surprised and happy.

To become a new heaven is one of his ultimate goals!

Until this moment, he didn't know that to become a new Heavenly Dao, he still needed to obtain the title of Heaven Replacer.

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this time, Tiandao sent another reminder...

[The criteria for promoting the title of 'Heaven' is as follows]

[The first title is promoted to the ultimate preacher]

[The second title is promoted to the ultimate master of destiny]

[After the promotion of the two titles is completed, the two titles can be combined into one, and they will be automatically promoted to the substitute of heaven]

[Detected: The second title of the player has become the master of advanced destiny, and the title task of "Lord of Ultimate Destiny" is automatically awakened]

[Lord of the Ultimate Destiny: The luck value reaches 10,000 times, and you can automatically awaken if you master the Avenue of Destiny and the Avenue of Karma]

[Detected: The first title of the player has become the 'Supreme Protector', and the title task of the 'Junior Evangelist' is automatically awakened]

[Junior evangelist: The combat power reaches 200 million stars, the prestige reaches 100,000 points, and the five avenues are mastered to be promoted]

[Reminder: After being promoted to junior evangelist, the task of intermediate evangelist will be automatically awakened...]

After listening to the prompt, Qin Feng was enlightened for a while.

It seems that he still has a long way to go to become a substitute.

The Lord of Ultimate Destiny, that's okay to say.

He just needs to continue to improve his luck and awaken the Dao of Karma and Dao of Destiny.

It's only a matter of time!

At present, what he needs to improve the most is the first title.

He is still the supreme protector, not even a junior preacher.

In order to promote the 'Supreme Guardian' to a 'Junior Evangelist', he needs to have a combat power of 200 million stars and master five avenues.

The five great ways are not divided into innate and acquired, as long as the number is sufficient.

It seems that he has to continue to improve his combat power and speed up his understanding of the Dao!

It's really not that easy to become the Dao of Heaven!

Qin Feng sighed in his heart!

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this time, Tiandao continued to send reminders...

[Reward the 'Chief Daozi' with 300 million stars for extra combat power]

[Reward 10,000 reputation points for 'Chief Daozi']

[Reward the purchase permission of "Chief Daozi" Tiandao Mall once]

what! There are even rewards!

Qin Feng's eyes lit up!

Om~!

Before he could think about it, a golden beam of light descended from the sky and landed on him...

In the next second, his combat power and prestige skyrocketed wildly all the way!

He closed his eyes involuntarily and accepted the reward comfortably...

After a long time, all the visions dissipated!

Qin Feng also slowly opened his eyes, and his eyes were full of joy.

After this reward, his combat power reached 11 billion stars, and his reputation reached 93,000.
