The white-robed old man smiled confidently: "Mostly not!"

hum!

As soon as those words fell, the '0' score on the standard line lit up!

Exudes a very dazzling red light!

The white-robed old man was suddenly stunned!

actually achieved?

Young Master Yuxu was also a little stunned!

Surrounded by exclamations!

"0 points! This little girl has 0 points!"

"My God! Such a little girl! The combat power has reached 80,000 stars!"

Everyone was surprised!

Young Master Yuxu and the white-robed old man are a little uncomfortable!

They naturally hope that Xiao Luan'er doesn't even get 0 points, but it backfires!

"Elder Bai, didn't you say that this little girl might not even get 0 points?"

"That's the old man's misjudgment! But don't worry, young master, this little girl's combat power has reached this level, and it can't be stronger! At most, she can get 3 points at most, that's a miracle!"

The white-robed old man said with oath.

He also deliberately said that it was 3 points, leaving some room for himself!

hum!

The words just fell, and the 1 point on the battle power scale line lit up.

Immediately afterwards, 2 points, 3 points, 4 points, 5 points, and 6 points lighted up in turn, surpassing the 5 points of Master Yuxu in an instant!

This time, Young Master Yuxu and the white-robed old man were dumbfounded!

Surprised all around!

"My God! 6 points! This exceeds the 5 points of Yuxu's young master!"

"It's too strong! It's too strong!"

"It turns out that this little girl's combat power is 110,000 stars!"

hum!

As soon as those words fell, the monument rang again!

Xiao Luan'er's combat power score continues to soar all the way!

7 points, 8 points, 9 points

In a blink of an eye, the points were on '30'!

It all came to an abrupt end!

boom!

Everyone around was completely dumbfounded!

One by one, they looked like they had seen a ghost, their mouths wide open!

Oh my God!

30 points!

It turns out that this little girl's combat power is 230,000 stars!

This is much stronger than Master Yuxu!

It can even be said that the two are not at the same level at all!

hum!

Another blast of the **** monument!

The golden light flashed on it, and the lines of information appeared again!

„ÄêEnd of this round of testing„Äë

[Player's combat score: 30 points]

[Player qualification score: 41 points]

[Two cumulative scores: 71 points]

[Judgment result: first-class **** product! „Äë

[Congratulations to the contestants who have obtained the qualifications for the first-class gods assessment]

hum! hum! hum!

Immediately afterwards, countless red lights poured out from the monument, pouring into the pass in the card slot, and condensed three peculiar divine patterns on it.

Condensing a **** pattern, representing the qualifications of inferior gods.

Condensing two divine marks, representing the qualification of medium divine grade.

Condensing the three divine marks, representing the qualifications of the superior divine grade.

The test is over!

Xiao Luan'er happily took out the pass!

She finally got the qualification for the first-class divine grade assessment!

At this time, everyone recovered from the shock, and there was an uproar in the field!

"My God! The qualifications for the first-class divine grade assessment!"

"Horrible! It's terrifying!"

"I didn't expect it! This little girl is so strong!"

"Yeah! She is much stronger than Master Yuxu!"

"Of course! Young Master Yuxu is a low-level god, but she is a high-level god! Her points are more than twice that of Yuxu's young master!"

People are talking about it!

Young Master Yuxu was extremely embarrassed to hear this, and the old face turned red and white!

He originally thought that through the results of this time, he would suppress Ji Yang's body and others.

Unexpectedly, he was crushed by Xiao Luan'er instead!

Moreover, the rolling is very thorough!

The inferior gods are two grades worse than the superior gods, and there is no qualification for comparison at all!

At this moment, Young Master Yuxu was a little ashamed!

The white-robed old man on the side was also embarrassed!

He has been fueling the flames beside him, thinking that the young master can crush Ji Yang's body and others, but he didn't expect to be slapped in the face again!

Here, he cannot escape responsibility!

"Dad! I passed!"

At this time, Xiao Luan'er had already held the pass and returned to Ji Yang's body with a happy face.

"Little guy! Well done!"

Ji Yang's body fondly patted Xiao Luan'er's head, in a particularly good mood.

In particular, when he saw the embarrassed expressions of Young Master Yuxu and the white-robed old man, he felt indescribably relieved.

"Master, this time it's my turn!"

Feng Xi said with a smile.

When she saw that Xiao Luan'er passed, she was overjoyed and a little impatient.

Ji Yang's body smiled and nodded: "Go!"

Immediately, Feng Xi walked towards the test bench.

"Look! Another one to test!"

Everyone looked at Feng Xi!

The attention of the audience once again fell on Feng Xi

Young Master Yuxu and the white-robed old man couldn't help but look at Feng Xi.

However, they did not dare to talk much this time.

Both of them had a calm face and watched silently.

"Dad 327, Sister Feng Xi's results this time will definitely be amazing! I'm afraid these people will be terrified for a while!"

Little Luan'er's voice transmission sounded in the ears of Jiyang's main body.

He smiled slightly, showing a playful smile!

He was looking forward to Feng Xi's performance this time!

It was at this moment that a hint of Heavenly Dao came to his mind.

Boom!

A shocking move!

The sea of ‚Äã‚Äãconsciousness of Ji Yang's body is violently tossing, and his combat power is also soaring wildly!

After a while, the feedback was over, and all the visions disappeared!

Only then did he slowly open his eyes, his eyes were full of ecstasy!

He finally completely merged with the divine pupil of God's Punishment and truly possessed the third divine eye!

That is the heaven and earth wonders of the middle-rank god-rank, not the equipment of the middle-rank god-rank!
