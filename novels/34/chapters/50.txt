Small rivers appear out of thin air.

Various minerals, forest trees, exotic flowers, exotic grasses, and spiritual fruits have appeared in multiples.

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

At the same moment, dozens of white lights lit up around the elephant group, and one after another violent mammoth appeared out of thin air.

In the blink of an eye, fifty or so violent mammoths turned into a hundred or so.

The herd has doubled in size.

Qin Feng was suddenly a little confused.

Immediately, a flash of light flashed in his mind, and a sudden color appeared.

It turned out that after the victory of the resource bet, all resources doubled.

Ferocious beasts are a type of resource, and the number has also doubled, so the fifty or so giant elephants have become a hundred or so.

This made him suddenly think that it was the first time he saw an elephant herd, and there were more than 60 giant elephants in total.

I'm afraid that the most primitive group of elephants only has more than 30 elephants. Because they won the bet last time, they have become about 60.

This is tantamount to invisibly increasing the difficulty of the task!

No wonder, he felt that there was a problem with the task prompts and seriously underestimated the difficulty of the task.

It turns out that this is a side effect of betting on victory.

Sure enough, the two phases of good and bad depend on 0.5!

While getting the benefits, the difficulty of the C-level tasks in No. 911 Novice Village has also been greatly improved!

Fortunately, it was only ordinary beasts that doubled in number, and there was no increase in mutant-level and king-level beasts.

Ang~! Ang~! Ang~!

It was at this moment that the roar of the elephant king sounded in the field.

At this moment, the elephant group also calmed down from the panic.

As soon as they heard the roar of the elephant king, they seemed to have received an order and moved to both sides, making way for the elephant king.

Boom~Long~Long!

The next second, the elephant king and the two mammoth guards rushed towards Qin Feng......

Chapter 55 Crazy promotion, Asan wailing! (4 more)

Qin Feng was shocked when he saw the elephant king rushing over.

Although his strength has skyrocketed, he may not be able to deal with the elephant king.

What's more, behind the elephant king, there are two powerful mammoth guards.

There are hundreds of giant elephants all around.

As soon as his mind moved, Qin Feng quickly opened the panel.

This time, he got 70 free attribute points, plus the points he hadn't added before, it had accumulated to 85 points.

Boom~!

In just an instant, a majestic energy rose from Qin Feng's body and quickly flowed through his body, cutting the hair and washing the marrow for him.

Then his aura skyrocketed wildly, spreading out around him.

At the same time, his latest data also appeared in his mind.

Fuck it~!

The combat evaluation has reached 23 stars!

Ha ha!

Qin Feng is ecstatic!

Elephant King's combat evaluation is 25 stars.

The gap between the two sides has narrowed greatly!

Boom~Long~Long!

At this moment, the elephant king rushed over and slammed directly into Qin Feng's chest.

Qin Feng dodged sideways and avoided it easily.

Whoo~!

Howling wind!

The huge ivory of the elephant king was against Qin Feng's side, and it was empty.

Its huge body, under the action of inertia, still rushed forward.

Swish~!

At this moment, the fire flashed.

Qin Feng took action!

The long knife burning with hellfire cut fiercely on the elephant king's crystal armor.

Click~! Click~! Click~!

sigh~!

There was a crisp sound, and the spar collapsed!

That knife actually cut through the defense of the spar armor, and cut a wound on the thick skin of the elephant king.

The fire of **** filled with the power of darkness instantly scorched the skin, leaving wounds several inches deep, exuding bursts of burnt stench.

Ang~!

The elephant king roared in pain and screamed in the sky.

Click~! Click~! Click~!

In the blink of an eye, the crystal armor that was split open by Qin Feng repaired itself perfectly.

But under the translucent armor, the wound left by the hellfire was faintly visible, and it could not be recovered for a long time.

Ha ha! !

Cool!

Qin Feng is ecstatic!

Now, he can finally hurt the elephant king.

What's even better is that the power of darkness in hellfire has the effect of erosion, which makes the elephant king unable to heal his wounds for a while.

You know, it's just a skin injury!

Change it to other fire damage, and the elephant king can recover in a few seconds.

Ang~! Ang~!

Before Qin Feng was happy, the two mammoth guards also killed them and rushed towards Qin Feng.

"roll!"

Qin Feng slashed horizontally, facing the four ivory guards at both ends.

When~! When~! When~!

A burst of gold and iron symphony!

Qin Feng was shocked and took three steps back.

The two mammoth guards were even more shocked by Qi Qi and retreated seven or eight steps.

This time, the giant elephant was shocked.

No way?

Now this human has become so strong!

Ang~!

The elephant king was furious, turned around and killed him, his aura was stronger than the last time.

"Ha ha!!"

Qin Feng laughed loudly, then dodged, avoiding the attack of the elephant king.

In the next second, he turned into a flaming **** of war and rushed towards the group of elephants beside him.

Ang~! Ang~! Ang~!

The elephants panicked and fled everywhere.

Qin Feng took a look at the recent giant elephants and shot them again and again...

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

puff~! puff~! puff~!

Suddenly, the sword light flashed in the field!

The blood was mixed with fire, splashing everywhere!

The screams of the elephants came one after another.

Ang~! Ang~! Ang~!

The elephant king and the two mammoth guards roared furiously and rushed to the rescue.

Qin Feng did not come into direct contact with them, but instead went straight to the giant elephants.
