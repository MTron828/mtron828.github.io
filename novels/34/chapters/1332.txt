At this time, Tiandao came to remind again

[Announcement: The contestant 'Qin Feng' is now announced, this year's assessment results! „Äë

Boom~!

The results are finally announced!

All players open their eyes!

Afterwards, everyone held their breath and waited for the announcement of the Heavenly Dao with all their concentration!

During the Taiyi days, Brahma frowned even more, and was also waiting for the announcement.

At this moment, he is extremely irritable!

He really couldn't figure it out, how could Qin Feng get the first place?

Is he really stronger than Tianzun, Dajiatian, or even Luohu?

Especially that Luo Hu, he is the legendary powerhouse!

The score created by it is 1 hour, 53 minutes and 16 seconds, and no one can shake it so far!

Even the Great Sacrifice to Heaven and Heavenly Venerate are far inferior!

Could Qin Feng be faster than him?

Boom~Long~Long~!

As soon as this thought came to mind, an announcement came from Tiandao.

[Announcement: The results of this year's contestant Qin Feng are: 1 hour, 8 minutes and 12 seconds! „Äë

[First place in the overall list: Qin Feng (Blue Star Realm), 56 minutes and 12 seconds!]

Gosh!

The score is only 56 minutes and 12 seconds?

It took less than half of the time spent by Rahu!

This time, Brahma was completely dumbfounded!

All test areas have become quiet!

Soon, Tiandao sent a reminder again

[Announcement: The time score of the player 'Qin Feng' was detected, which was less than half of that of the second place Luo Hu, and his performance was extremely excellent, so the player 'Qin Feng' was awarded a special reward! „Äë

Even the demons guarding the gate were stunned!

As if time froze at that moment!

Everything has become so quiet!

Chapter 979 The Supreme Star Gate! The challenge is on!

At the same time, the Temple of the Superintendent, the center of the main hall

The ranking **** monument lit up with a dazzling golden light!

The information on it is undergoing some changes

Qin Feng looked curiously

[First-class Star-Lord Record God Monument]

[This year's first-class star-rank rankings are as follows]

After reading this, Qin Feng couldn't help but be delighted

Om~! Om~!

At this moment, two consecutive reward beams fell from the sky, all of which fell on him.

Boom~Long~Long~!

In the next second, his combat power, prestige, luck, and merit all skyrocketed wildly!

At the same time, more than 100 avenues of aura were also lit up on him.

The reward is finally here!

Qin Feng is full of surprises!

Then, he closed his eyes and happily accepted the reward

At the same time, Tai Yitian was in the test area.

Brahma stood there in despair!

He couldn't believe it at this moment, Qin Feng actually won the first place in the overall list!

What made him even more unbelievable was that Qin Feng's grades were only half of Luo Hu's!

Who is Rahu? !

That is the strongest existence in this universe!

Can Qin Feng thief be twice as strong as Luo Hu? !

Is this possible? !

Brahma is really hard to accept!

In fact, don't say that Qin Feng is stronger than Luo Hu, even if he is stronger than Da Jitian and Tianzun, he feels unacceptable!

What's more, Qin Feng is more than twice as strong as Luo Hu!

damn it!

How did the thief do it?

Did he use some weird trick?

Or, because the little thief is a challenger, Tiandao opened a small stove for him? !

no!

He's going to see the finish line!

See how the thief did it? !

Brahma's eyes narrowed, and he finally came back to his senses.

Up to now, he still doesn't believe that Qin Feng won the first place in the overall list with his true ability!

Speaking of which, who would dare to believe that a Lord God Realm would be far stronger than his half-step Great Perfection!

Moreover, he is still the leader in the semi-530-step Great Perfection!

"That's right! That little thief is a challenger! After he gets the reward, he should activate the challenge of the special star-rank and above! If the deity can stop it, it will be a great achievement!"

Brahma's eyes lit up, as if thinking of something.

Boom~!n√äw stùíêries at nùíê/vel/b/i/n(.)coùíé

In the next second, he dodged and rushed towards the finish line!

He wants to destroy Qin Feng's next chance!

"Huh! That is"

Brahma's move immediately startled Jia Luo.

His face suddenly changed slightly!

Boom~!

In the next second, he also flashed, chasing after Brahma!

Although it is impossible for him to win the first place, but the second place is hopeful!

In any case, he couldn't let Brahma take the second place!

The reward for the second place is much richer than the third place!

Just like that, Kalo chased after Brahma.

Seeing this, Bai Zu also recovered from the shock, and hurriedly chased the two of them in front of him.

In this way, the fierce competition in Taiyi Day has started once again!

At the same time, in the early days, the safety zone square.

Abel stared at the air with a lost face.

Until now, he had not recovered from the shock.

He never imagined that Qin Feng had won the first place in the overall ranking this time, and his performance was much better than that of Demon Venerable Luohu!

Gosh!

This little thief is too scary!

No wonder Da Jitian wanted to kill him!

Such a talented little thief must be strangled in the cradle as soon as possible!
