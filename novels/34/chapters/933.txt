After a while, Qin Feng walked to Lingchi and waved to the pool.

huh~!

White light flashes!

A bone ball as white as jade flew into his hand automatically.

If you look closely, the bone beads are like glass, the light is like water, and it has thirteen rays of brilliance...

[Supreme Relic Bone (light and dark): the peak of the high-grade **** rank, refined from the bones of the **** king. „Äë

[Reminder: Refining this relic bone can increase the basic combat power of a thousand stars and increase the luck value tenfold]

[Reminder: Only those who possess both light and dark talents can refine this relic bone]

After reading the information, Qin Feng smiled.

Now, he can understand why this relic bone has not been refined by the **** king.

That Angel God King didn't have the talent of darkness, so naturally he couldn't refine it.

Rumor has it that there are also fellow practitioners of light and darkness in the angel family.

Its angel wings are half black and half white, and they are called fallen angels.

Such angels are in an antagonistic relationship with normal angels.

Qin Feng seriously doubted that this relic bone was made from the fallen angel of the **** king realm.

It is rumored that a corpse of a **** king can only refine two or three relic bones at most.

The existence of the Divine King Realm is all the power of the sky!

Such a powerful existence will also fall, and it has to be embarrassing.

Qin Feng has some emotions in his heart!

In fact, Qin Feng guessed right.

The Angel God King he just killed was only in the early days of the Lord God, and his strength was like an ant in front of the Quasi God King, vulnerable to a single blow.

As for the God King Realm, it is much stronger than the quasi-God King!

In fact, this relic was stolen from a mysterious place by the Angel God King.

He has never been able to refine it, and it has survived to this day.

Later, he inadvertently triggered Tiandao's gatekeeping mission.

The reward for his task is that Tiandao will help him obtain the opportunity of dark talent.

The coexistence of light and darkness is extremely difficult!

Without the help of Heavenly Dao, it would be very difficult for the Angel God King to acquire the dark talent.

It is a pity that the wish of the Angel God King has not been fulfilled, and the supreme relic bone has been lost.

This is also a punishment for failing the mission!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng put away the relics with satisfaction.Aall ùíèùíÜwest chùíÇptùíÜrs on n.o./vùíÜlùíÉi/n/(.)cùíêm

Afterwards, he was going to take away the entire Lingchi...

Om~!

At this time, the sky shook, and a reminder came from Heaven!

[After 3 seconds, the player will be sent back to the main hall. „Äë

[After the player rests for 10 minutes, the second challenge will be opened]

[Reminder: At the end of each level, players have 10 minutes of rest time. „Äë

As soon as he heard the prompt, Qin Feng quickly released the monstrous spiritual power, covering the entire Lingchi!

Boom~Long~Long~!

Suddenly, the earth shook!

The huge spiritual pond slowly rose from the ground and emerged from the ground.

huh~!

Immediately afterwards, with a flash of white light, the entire Lingchi disappeared out of thin air, and was taken into the zero-degree space by Qin Feng.

Later, Qin Feng also disappeared out of thin air.

He was sent back to the assessment hall!

Qin Feng just disappeared for a while, when the Angel God King was reshaped by Heavenly Dao and resurrected.

But the next second, in that space, there was an extremely sad and angry roar from the Angel God King!

All his treasures are gone!

At the same time, in the assessment hall.

Qin Feng's figure appeared out of thin air.

When he appeared, his figure flashed and disappeared again.

In the next second, he appeared in the zero-degree space.

At this moment, in the training room.

Qin Feng summoned the "Book of the World", opened the time force field, and turned the time force field of zero-dimensional space into 30 times that of the outside world again.

"Next, I have to digest this harvest quickly!"

Qin Feng muttered in his heart.

He knew very well that there was an Angel God King with a combat power of 35,000 stars in the first level.

The target that appears in the second level is likely to be a demon **** with a combat power of 40,000 stars, that is, the existence of the main **** in the middle stage.

With his current strength, it is difficult to kill such an existence.

Therefore, he must continue to improve his combat power.

Of course, his goal is not just to complete the second challenge!

He also wanted to get the highest rating for the second level.

As expected, the highest level evaluation of the second level should also be to kill the target within 10 seconds!

This is even more difficult!

Having said that, his current Shenwu points have reached 955 points, and he is one line away from completing the supreme-level evaluation task.

As long as the next level goes well, he will be able to complete the task.

At that time, I wonder if something special will happen?

However, now is not the time for him to think about it.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng's body flashed with white light, and nineteen fission variants were directly separated.

Afterwards, nineteen fission variants sat cross-legged one after another.

The six fission bodies began to refine the 'Daogu Dan'.

The six are refining the 'Shenmai Dan'.

The six are refining the 'source of divine power'.

Another one continues to participate in the study of the Book of the Present World.

After arranging these, Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief.

Then, he opened the panel and started adding points to himself.

After killing the 'Angel God King', he also obtained 200 million attribute points, just in time to increase his strength.

In just a moment, after adding 200 million attributes, his basic combat power skyrocketed to 254 million stars.

Qin Feng was very satisfied.

After doing this, he took out the 'Supreme Relic Bone' and started refining it.

Tiandao gave 10 minutes of rest time, in this zero-degree space, it is five hours.

Qin Feng believes that within five hours, he should be able to refine the relic bones.

In this way, Qin Feng and the fission variants entered a state of retreat...

At the same time, in the Blue Star Realm, in Longyuan City.

Long Yuan was waiting anxiously.

They are waiting, Qin Feng can break through to the demigod realm as soon as possible, so that Long Yuan can be promoted to the 12th level city.

Qin Feng did not break through for a moment, and everyone in Long Yuan was anxious.

At the same time, in the White Tiger Star Region, on a barren planet.

Gabriel, Karu, Uriel, and Kaxiu were still silently waiting beside the teleportation node.

Now, the teleportation node lit up with a faint white light and made a slight vibrating sound.

Obviously, it has already been activated!

It's just that the energy level is insufficient, and the remote transmission cannot be completed.

"Lord Gabriel, the energy upgrade at this node is very fast! It is estimated that in ten hours or so, Kaxiu will pass. This is five or six hours faster than we expected!"

At this moment, Uriel looked at the teleportation node in front of him with a smile on his face.

Gabriel also smiled and nodded: "Yeah! Judas has always been extremely cautious in doing things and never exaggerated. He said that what he said was done in 12 hours is often the slowest time. Sometimes, it can be done in 6 hours."

Wu Lie nodded again and again: "Indeed! In this way, Kaxiu will soon be able to arrive at the Blue Star Realm. As soon as Kaxiu arrives, Qin Feng's child will be dead!"

Karu also smiled and said: "Of course! Qin Feng's child is also the ultimate strength of the true god. Kaxiu's combat power has exceeded 300 million stars. As soon as he makes a move, he will be able to destroy Qin Feng and Longyuan City!"

As soon as these words fell, several people in the field showed knowing smiles, and their faces were full of anticipation.

Kaxiu, who had been silent for a long time, also showed a confident smile.

God's limit!

Nothing in his eyes!

If he shoots, he will be able to kill in seconds!

Regarding Qin Feng's strength as the limit of true God, this is a message from Judas.

Several people had great confidence in Judas' judgment.

Nothing more than Judas's work, has always been steady, and seldom made mistakes.

But these people don't know that Qin Feng's strength has long exceeded the limit of true gods, and his comprehensive strength can kill even the 350 million star angel **** king.

Of course, Qin Feng was not in Longyuan City, only his three avatars stayed behind.

However, as Qin Feng's strength increased, the strength of his clone also increased synchronously.

Now, the strength of the three clones of Yueling, Woodling and Bingling has reached the threshold of the initial stage of the main god.

The three avatars join forces, I am afraid that they will be able to draw a tie with Kaxiu.

What's more, Qin Feng is undergoing an assessment, and his strength has been continuously improving.

When he completes the challenge assessment, he can be promoted to the demigod realm.

At that time, his strength will be greatly improved, and the strength of the three avatars will also increase simultaneously.

At that time, Yueling's three clones join forces, I am afraid that they can crush Kaxiu.

For these things, Gabriel and others are naturally unclear.

"By the way, Mr. Gabriel! Earlier, Judas sent a message that Qin Feng had six or seven Holy Land tokens in his hands, leading to the second floor of the Holy Land."

Uriel remembered something again, and couldn't help but muttered.

When he mentioned the 'Second Floor of the Holy Land', his throat rolled and he couldn't help swallowing.

Obviously, he was extremely tempted by the opportunity on the second floor of the Holy Land.

"Second floor of the Holy Land!"
