It's a pity that I can't make it a master!

Unless you become the master of this universe, you can control this list!

Thinking about it too, this is the position of the true gods who control all the universes in this side, how can ordinary people use it.

With this in mind, Jiyang Ontology continued to look up the list...

I saw more than a dozen pieces of information listed on the list of gods, all of which were astonishing...

[First Layer: There are 4,117 first-grade gods in it, and you need to have a combat power of 10,000 stars to enter. „Äë

[Secondary Heaven: There are 560 second-rank gods in it, and you need to have a combat power of 50,000 stars to enter. „Äë

[Three Heavens: There are 170 third-grade gods in it, and you need to have a combat power of 200 million stars to enter. „Äë

[Fourth Layer: There are 50 fourth-grade gods in it, and you need to have a combat power of 800 million stars to enter. „Äë

[Wuzhongtian: There are 30 fifth-grade gods in it, and you need to have a combat power of 2 billion stars to enter. „Äë

[Sixth Heaven: There are 20 sixth-grade gods in it, and you need to have a combat power of 8 billion stars to enter. „Äë

[Seventh layer of heaven: There are 10 seventh-grade gods in it, and you need to have a combat power of 200 million stars to enter. „Äë

[Eighth Heaven: There are 5 rank eight gods in it, and you need to have a combat power of 800 million stars to enter. „Äë

[Jiuzhongtian: There are 2 ninth-grade gods in it, and you need to have a combat power of 200 million stars to enter. „Äë

[Reminder: The first-grade **** position is the weakest, and the ninth-grade **** position is the strongest. The higher the rank of God, the greater the benefits! „Äë

[Reminder: Each player has only two chances to challenge. All failed, and I can no longer participate in the competition for the divine position within a hundred years! „Äë

Seeing this, Ji Yang's body suddenly realized!

It turns out that the divine position is divided like this.

The rank obtained is different, and the benefits obtained are different.

Obviously, the ninth-rank **** position is the best, but that is not something that anyone can challenge.

Who in this world can reach 200 million stars in the False God realm?

Not to mention 200 million stars, even if it is 2 billion stars, there are not many people!

Therefore, since the birth of this universe, very few people have been able to obtain the **** position above the sixth rank.

As for the ninth-grade **** position, since the birth of the universe, no one has been able to challenge it.Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

Because since the birth of this universe, no one has ever reached a combat power of more than 500 million in the False God realm.

Those people are not even qualified to challenge the eighth-rank **** position, let alone the ninth-rank **** position.

Ji Yang's body also understands why Yu Xuanji said before that there are some special divine positions in this temple that no one has been able to obtain.

Thinking of this, Ji Yang's body showed a smug smile.

Now, the combat power between him and the extreme yin body has reached 343.5 billion stars, and he is fully qualified to obtain the ninth-rank divine position!

Coincidentally, there are exactly two rank nine gods!

That should be the only two gods in this universe!

However, Ji Yang was not in a hurry to go to the Nine Heavens God Realm, but looked at the last few lines of information on the Conferred God List!

[Tianwaitian: There is a Dao-level opportunity inside, which requires False God Realm to enter, and True God Realm is not allowed! „Äë

[Reminder: To enter Tianwaitian, you need to have a basic combat power of more than 400 million stars, and the success rate of obtaining opportunities can reach more than 50%! „Äë

[Reminder: If you fail to enter the Tianwaitian challenge, you will be forcibly passed out of the Nine Heavens Temple, and you will no longer be able to participate in the competition for the divine position within a hundred years! „Äë

Boom~!

After reading this, Ji Yang's body was pleasantly surprised!

He didn't expect that above the ninth-rank **** position, there is actually a higher Dao-level opportunity!

It's just that this opportunity is too difficult, and the basic combat power must reach more than 400 million stars to have a 50% success rate.

It seems that he wants to pass the challenge, it is extremely difficult!

After all, his basic combat power is only 343.5 billion stars!

In this way, it would be good for him to have a 30% pass rate!

What is even more terrifying is that if he fails the challenge, he will not be able to be promoted to the real **** realm within a hundred years.

The price of this failure is enormous!

Thinking of this, Ji Yang's body couldn't help frowning.

This time, is he going to challenge?

If he doesn't challenge and go directly to obtain the ninth-rank **** position, then he will never have the chance to get that Dao-level chance again.

Because that day, only the False God Realm can enter!

If it fails, it will be impossible to be promoted to the true **** realm within a hundred years!

What if he succeeds?

If it is successful, after he goes out, he will be more confident to aim at Venerable Yin!

The benefits that Dao-level chance brought him must be great!

With this thought, the polar yang body and the polar negative body looked at each other and merged into one!

Qin Feng appeared here!

Since he has decided to challenge the Dao-level chance, he will naturally use the state of fit to fight for it!

At this time, Xiao Luan'er, Di Jiang and others also read the information on the Conferred God List.

Everyone was talking excitedly!

"Wow! Dad, it turns out that the gods are divided into nine levels! I now have 1.6 billion star combat power, and I can challenge the fourth-level gods!"

At this moment, Xiao Luan'er was very excited!

"Dad! Dad! I have 2.1 billion combat power! I can challenge the fifth-rank **** position!"

"Dad! Dad! I can also challenge the fifth-rank **** position! I have 2.3 billion combat power!"

Jumang and Dijiang also cheered excitedly.

Feng Xi, Yu Xuanji, Qi Yue, and Qing Chengzi all laughed and said nothing.

The weakest of the four of them, Qingchengzi, has reached 1.2 billion stars in battle, and the strongest Jade Xuanji has reached 1.7 billion stars, and they are all qualified to challenge the fourth-rank god!

Seeing this, Qin Feng said with a gratified expression: "After you have chosen your target, enter the corresponding secret realm to challenge! Presumably this time it is not difficult to obtain the divine position!"

Yu Xuanji also smiled and said: "Master is right! There are 50 fourth-rank gods and 30 fifth-rank gods. There are only seven of us, and there are no competitors at all. In other words, as long as we enter the corresponding secret realm, You can get a **** position!"

Xiao Luan'er was overjoyed: "Wow! That's great! It seems that this is the easiest time for us to advance to the realm. By the way, Sister Xuanji, you said that the fourth-rank **** position is stronger than the worst first-rank **** position. How many?"

Yu Xuanji smiled and said: "This is a good judgment! The threshold of combat power to obtain a first-rank **** is 10,000 combat power, and the threshold of combat power to obtain a fourth-rank **** is 800 million stars. In other words, a fourth-rank **** is required. 80 times stronger than a first-grade god!"

Xiao Luan'er was pleasantly surprised: "Wow! It's so much stronger! So, the benefits of obtaining the fourth-grade **** position will be 80 times that of the first-grade **** position?"

Yu Xuanji nodded: "That's true! In fact, 90% of the true gods in this world are first-rank gods, and very few outstanding ones are second-rank gods. As for third-rank gods, there is not one among a million true gods!"

"Don't think that the gods above the third grade are good, but very few people can get them! I'm afraid that every time the temple opens, it will be good to be able to produce a genius of the third grade god!"

Hearing this, everyone showed a knowing smile!

They are different this time, the worst can get the fourth-rank **** position, which is much stronger than the third-rank **** position.

"Sister Xuanji, according to what you said, the fifth-grade **** position is twice as strong as the first-grade **** position?"

At this time, Di Jiang asked curiously.

Yu Xuanji smiled and nodded: "It is indeed twice as much!"

Di Jiang was delighted: "Wow! The fifth-rank **** is so powerful! By the way, Sister Xuanji, if you want to obtain the highest ninth-rank god, the threshold of combat power is 200 million combat power. In this way, the ninth-rank **** is better than the first-rank god. It's 20,000 times stronger!"

Yu Xuanji took a deep breath: "It is indeed 20,000 times stronger! I'm afraid that since the birth of this universe, no one has been able to obtain that level of divine status! By the way, master, are you going to challenge that level of divine status this time? Is it the Ninth Grade?"

As soon as these words fell, all the subordinates looked at Qin Feng!

Everyone's face was full of anticipation, and even a little nervous.

For Qin Feng's current strength, the girls have long been unable to figure out the details.

After all, when Qin Feng and Yaotai Xuannv fought, they were all in retreat.

The most recent battle they witnessed was the battle with the Demon King Fengxi.

At that time, the master's basic combat power had not yet reached 200 million stars.

Thinking of this, they became a little worried, for fear that Qin Feng would not reach the threshold of obtaining the ninth-grade **** position.

Seeing this, Qin Feng smiled slightly: "That's right! It's the ninth grade!"

Hearing this, the girls breathed a sigh of relief!

"Wow! I knew that Dad would definitely be able to win the ninth rank!"

"Humph! Of course!"

The two little guys, Di Jiang and Jumang, even showed their admiration.

Yu Xuanji breathed a sigh of relief: "Master, that's great! As long as you reach the basic combat power of 200 million, you can enter the Nine Heavens God Realm, and you can definitely obtain the divine position. Coincidentally, the ninth-rank divine position has two!"

Qin Feng laughed without saying a word!

His basic combat power is not just 200 million stars, but 343.5 billion stars.

Afterwards, he said: "Okay! Time is precious! After you have chosen the secret realm, go to get the divine position!"

"Um!"

Everyone complied!

"Right! After you complete the promotion of the true god, go directly to the land of the gods. There are some ancient battlefield opportunities there. If you are lucky, you may be able to get some ancient inheritance..."

At this time, Qin Feng told everyone the secret that the Qing Emperor told everyone.

After everyone heard it, they were surprised again and again!

At the moment, Xiao Luan'er and the others couldn't wait to fly to the Conferred God List...

They want to be promoted to the real **** realm as soon as possible, and then go outside the temple to find opportunities...

Fengshen Hidden Ten Realms!

Every situation is different!

Xiaoluan'er, Fengxi, Yu Xuanji, Qiyue, and Qingchengzi flew to the word "fourth heaven" and were sucked into the list.

Three words one world!

Literally is a secret!

At the same moment, Di Jiang and Jumang were sucked in by the words 'Wuzhongtian'.

In this way, all the subordinates entered the secret realm in the Conferred God Ranking to obtain the divine position.

Seeing this, Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief.

Then, he walked towards the corner of the hall

I saw an altar in the front corner with a transparent crystal ball on it.

That should be the Temple Mall!

Qin Feng wants to go to the mall and exchange the holy land points in his hand for some resources to see if he can improve his strength.

He plans to go to 'Tianwaitian' to challenge the Dao-level chance, but he is worried about the lack of strength!

Therefore, the Temple Mall is an extremely important opportunity for him to improve!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng quickened his pace and walked towards the altar of the mall

Soon, Qin Feng walked to the altar and pressed the crystal ball with one hand.
