Jumang: "I am by a small stream! There are sounds of monsters approaching near me! They may be coming!"

The little guy's consciousness has gradually become a little confused.

Ji Yang's body is in a hurry: "You persist! I'll come over immediately!"

As soon as the voice fell, Ji Yang's body suddenly released his consciousness and peeped around.

Boom~!

In just an instant, his consciousness swept across thousands of miles.

The next second, he scanned a stream.

Just under a big tree by the stream, he saw two weak figures, it was Xiao Luan'er and Jumang.

At this moment, Xiao Luan'er had already fallen asleep.

Jumang sat next to his sister, his little head was like a chicken pecking at rice, and he kept dozing off.

He can't stand it anymore! ….

This detection, Ji Yang's body was full of surprises, and he was also secretly relieved!

Fortunately, the two little guys did not enter the depths of the valley, so he was so easy to find.

Having said that, this Valley of Ten Thousand Demons should be extremely huge, but he can't see the whole picture!

Chapter Eight hundred and seventy-fifth Heaven and Earth Spiritual Roots! Renshui Peach!

"Huh! That is"

Suddenly, Ji Yang's face changed.

His divine sense scanned that a monster with fangs and a human face appeared three hundred miles away near Jumang.

Taking a closer look at the monster, there are two rounds of aura in the back of its head, and it is suddenly a monster in the middle stage of the **** king.

At this moment, the monster sniffed the air, as if smelling a special smell.

The next second, it suddenly raised its head and looked in the direction of Jumang with a look of surprise!

It smelled, and there was a human scent in that direction, and there was more than one!

Swish~!

Thinking of this, the monster dodged and rushed in the direction of Jumang.

Seeing this scene, Ji Yang's body secretly screamed bad!

The distance of 300 miles, at the speed of the middle stage of the God King, can be reached in just a few seconds.

And Jiyang Ontology and Jumang are 7,000 miles apart!

Even if he rushed over at full speed, it would take more than half a minute.

Now, Jumang and Xiaoluan'er are in danger!

Ji Yang's body was instantly in a state of urgency!

what! correct!

Suddenly, a flash of light in his mind instantly turned into white light and disappeared out of thin air!

At the same moment, next to the creek.

Jumang is struggling to hold on!

The mandala pollen was constantly eroding his soul, sealing his six senses, making him extremely sleepy.

But he knew that Dad was coming!

As long as he persists for a while longer, he will be safe!

This thought was his last spiritual support!

Boom~Long~Long~!Fôll0w current novÊls on n/o/(v)/3l/b((in).(co/m)

At this moment, there was a rapid sound of breaking through the air not far away!

The little guy was startled, and he hurriedly tried to fight his spirits. He used his last thoughts to disperse his consciousness, and probed in the direction of the piercing sound.

At this detection, he was horrified to see that a hundred miles away, a monster with a body of a hundred meters in length and a human face and a tiger body was killing him!

The little guy was so frightened that his face changed greatly, thinking that it was not good!

huh~!

At this moment, a white light flashed beside him, and a stalwart figure appeared out of thin air!

"dad!"

As soon as Jumang saw the familiar figure, he suddenly exclaimed.

The person who came is the body of Jiyang!

It turned out that at this critical moment, Ji Yang's body suddenly thought that although this secret realm suppressed his space summoning, within ten thousand miles, he could still use it freely!

Figured this out, he hurriedly used the reverse space summon, and rushed to Jumang's side in an instant.

Seeing that the two little guys were in good condition, Ji Yang's body breathed a sigh of relief.

"Dad! There is... a monster is coming!"

Jumang endured drowsiness and reminded anxiously.

"I know! Little guy, go back to Chaos Space first!"

As soon as Ji Yang's body waved his hand, Jumang and Xiaoluan'er were taken into the chaotic space.

After doing this, he breathed a sigh of relief.

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, the sound of rapidly breaking through the air was constantly approaching here, and the sound became louder and louder!

The body of the polar sun couldn't help but follow the sound

After a while, the monster with the face and the body rushed to the scene!

The two sides are far apart.

Ji Yang's body looked at it for a while and found that the opponent was really a monster in the middle stage of the **** king, and this was the target he wanted to kill!

At this moment, the monster can also see clearly, there is only one person on the scene, Ji Yang, and it is stunned!

Before that, it clearly smelled the breath of two humans, why is there only one person here?

What makes it even more puzzling is that the breath of this human being in front of him is elegant and refined, with an incomparably elegant connotation, which is different from the breath it smelled before!

For some reason, the breath of this human makes it inexplicably awe-inspiring.

But it took a closer look, but found that this human is only a False God!

After this snooping, the monster looked disdainful.

It's just a human being in the False God realm. It's actually in awe, it's really confused!

Immediately, it split its big mouth, exposing its fangs, and looked at Qin Feng covetously.

"Human! You are too weak! The deity thought it was a human from the main **** realm breaking in, but I didn't expect it to be you, a worm in the virtual **** realm. However, that's okay! The deity will eat you now! "! "

As soon as the voice fell, the monster dodged and slaughtered directly at Jiyang's body!

Boom~!

In the blink of an eye, it's culling close!

Afterwards, it suddenly opened its **** mouth, spewing out a monstrous **** aura, revealing the fierce light of choosing people to devour!

It was at this moment that Ji Yang's body shot!

I saw him wave it casually!

Swish~!

A sword light suddenly lit up, cutting through the sky!

Kacha~!

A crisp sound!

The sword light swept across the monster!

But not a drop of blood!

One person and one demon pass by in an instant!

Bang~!

Another dull landing sound!

The monster landed on all fours and stood firm!

But in the next second, a slender red line appeared on its face, extending from the eyebrows to the chin, and then to the whole body.

And in the eyes of the monster, there is an extremely frightened color!

Click~! Click~! Click~!

In the next second, it took the red line as the center, slowly split into two halves, and fell to the left and right!

Bang~! Bang~!

Two muffled beeps!

The corpse fell to the ground!

A monster in the middle stage of the **** king was instantly killed by the sword of Jiyang's body, and he didn't even have time to scream.

At this time, a dazzling white light flew out from the corpse of the monster and poured into the body of Jiyang...

[Your vocation is promoted to Level 83 Judgment Supreme (primary Hongmeng)]

The vocation has been upgraded!

The anode body is very happy!

Killing the monsters in the middle stage of the king of gods is really huge!

Not only did he upgrade his vocation, he also got 1 point and 3 Chaos Treasure Chests (incomplete state).

As a result, his points reached 3117 points, and there were 3 more treasure chests.

Even better, he actually got a map of the Valley of Ten Thousand Demons!

This is an added bonus!

With the map, it is easier for him to kill those monsters, and he can better complete the tasks of the three major swords.

With this in mind, Jiyang body put away the spoils in the field, and finally picked up the map to check it out.

It didn't take long for him to read the information on the map, showing joy.

It turned out that the Valley of Ten Thousand Demons had three god-king peak-level demon kings, dozens of god-king-level monsters, and tens of thousands of monsters from the real **** realm to the main **** realm.

The three demon kings guard two areas!

There is a demon king guarding the eastern area, and there are more than a dozen god-king-level monsters under his command.

There are two demon kings guarding the west area, and there are more than 20 god-king-level monsters under their command.

The current location of the anode body belongs to the eastern region.

What the human-faced tiger leech is following is the Demon King in the eastern region—Youya!

That scorpion is extremely powerful, and a proper god-king peak exists.

"With this map, I can find the three demon kings more easily."
