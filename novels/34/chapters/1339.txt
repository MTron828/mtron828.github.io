At the same time, Daluo Tianjing, inside the Temple of Supervision.

Qin Feng flew forward along the starlight channel.

At this point, he finally reached the end of the passage.

With a flash of white light, he passed through the door of light at the end of the passage and entered a huge secret world.G√™tt the latest chùíÇpters on nùíê/velbin(.)com

Qin Feng looked around and saw a vast sea of ‚Äã‚Äãfog on all sides, boundless.

The sea of ‚Äã‚Äãfog was actually gray, white, black, blue, and gold, and it was composed of the five innate mists.

It contains the power of the innate five Tais, and the suffocation is astonishing!

As soon as Qin Fengcai appeared, the innate power of the five gods that covered the sky and the earth rolled over him mightily.

Poof~! Poof~! Poof~!

In the next second, the power of the innate five Tais collapsed one after another, and it did not affect Qin Feng in the slightest.

Seeing this scene, Qin Feng felt fortunate!

Fortunately, he mastered the avenues of the Innate Fifth Tai, so he was not affected by the power of the Innate Fifth Tai.

Otherwise, in this secret realm, his strength will be greatly suppressed.

Each innate evil fog will suppress 10% of the combat power, and the five evil fogs together will suppress 50% of the combat power!

Unfortunately, it has no effect on Qin Feng!

The corners of Qin Feng's mouth twitched slightly, and he continued to observe the surroundings...

Soon, his eyes fell on the front

There is a divine object that penetrates the sky. Its shape is like a wooden whip. There are 21 sections in total. It is as long as a planet.

Look closely, this fetish seems to be a whip

Qin Feng's heart moved, and he quickly peeped away.

[Playing the God Whip: Dao-level wonders, the only one in the universe, unidentified master! „Äë

[Play the divine whip to control the titles of the heavens! With a single whip, the god-lord fell, the star-lord collapsed, and the god-king could not compete! Only half a step above eternity can resist one or two! „Äë

[Reminder: This item contains 1 innate avenue and 30 acquired avenues]

[Reminder: Only those who have the title of 'Supreme Star Lord' are qualified to be recognized as the Lord! „Äë

Boom~!

After this snooping, Qin Feng was full of surprises!

This is the whiplash!

Finally got to see its body!

He wants to truly control the 'Hongyuan Universe'. In addition to obtaining the inheritance of the Judgment Domain Master, he also has the recognition of the Nine Dao-level strange objects!

Now, he finally saw the second strange object, and he has not yet recognized the master.

Looking at the conditions for its master recognition, it must be a supreme star-lord before it can be recognized as the master.

This seems to be an intentional arrangement!

Supreme Star Lord, only challengers have a chance to get it!

Isn't that what was arranged for him?

Qin Feng laughed!

However, he has not yet completed the challenge, and he is not yet the Supreme Star Lord.

correct!

He has entered the secret realm!

What is the content of the challenge?

Qin Feng looked around again, looking for a target

Om~! Om~! Om~!

At this moment, countless starlights emerged out of thin air, and then gathered into four groups of light.

In the next second, the four light groups turned into four heaven-penetrating devil gods!

Some have the body of a snake, some have the body of a dragon, some have the body of a female leopard, some have the body of a thunderbolt, and they are all imposing and amazing!

Qin Feng hurriedly peeped at one of the demon gods...

[Evil Spirit]: Qiangliang

[Boundary]: Half-step Eternal Great Perfection

[Combat Strength]: 8.2 trillion stars

[Characteristics]: Beat God's Whip Guardian Spirit

[Remarks]: The true spirit is damaged, the spirituality is incomplete

"Hey~! This is Qiangliang?"

Qin Feng's eyes lit up, surprised and happy!

Qiang Liang is one of the twelve ancestor witches!

That was also one of the targets he was looking for, and he didn't expect to appear here.

53 Up to now, Qin Feng already knows that the twelve ancestor witches in Longbi mythology are the twelve emperors of this universe.

Now, he has the weapon of the Great Dao - the Wu Dao Emperor Pearl, and needs to find the reincarnation of the twelve emperors.

As long as they find the reincarnations of the twelve emperors, and then let them fuse the Wudao Emperor Pearl, they can be transformed into the Lord of the Heavenly Witch.

At that time, they will give Qin Feng a great help!

Qin Feng has found eight emperors successively, Di Jiang and other six have hatched, and Zhu Jiuyin and Shebi corpse have not yet hatched.

The remaining Qiangliang, Xizi, Xuanming, and Leishu have not been found before.

Now, Qin Feng has discovered Qiangliang.

Look at its state, delirious!

It is estimated that it will be turned into a spiritual egg like the corpse of the corpse and the nine yin of the candle.

correct!

The remaining three demon gods are

Qin Feng went to the three demon gods in turn.

„ÄêEvil Spirit„Äë: Ziz

[Boundary]: Half-step Eternal Great Perfection

[Combat Strength]: 8.2 trillion stars

[Characteristics]: Beat God's Whip Guardian Spirit

„ÄêEvil Spirit„Äë: ËìêReceive

[Boundary]: Half-step Eternal Great Perfection

[Combat Strength]: 8.1 trillion stars

[Characteristics]: Beat God's Whip Guardian Spirit

[Evil Spirit]: Xuan Ming

[Combat Strength]: 8.3 trillion stars

[Boundary]: Half-step Eternal Great Perfection

[Characteristics]: Beat God's Whip Guardian Spirit

Qin Feng is full of surprises!

The four emperors he was looking for were in front of him!

Among them, Xuan Ming was still a woman.

However, all of them were damaged by their true spirits, with incomplete spiritual intelligence, and were transformed into guardian spirits of the 'God Whip' by the way of heaven.

Then next

Boom~Long~Long~!

Without waiting for Qin Feng to think about it, the mutation in the field regenerated!

Qiangliang, Tingshou, Jizi, and Xuanming took the initiative to gather together and fuse together strangely!

In just a moment, the four major demon gods merged into one, turning into a ferocious demon **** with a height of hundreds of millions of feet, four heads and eight arms, and a dragon scale, and the momentum directly soared to 17 trillion stars!

Qin Feng was a little stunned and wanted to spy

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, the sky shook, and a reminder came from Heaven.

[Challenge reminder: congratulations to the player 'Qin Feng' for stepping into the Five Colors Sky and officially activating the 'Supreme Star Lord' challenge]

PS: It is the beginning of the month, and the little author asks readers for a monthly pass, thank you!

Chapter nine hundred and eighty-third the wonderful use of merit! Dao scourge!

Hearing the prompt, Qin Feng's eyes lit up with joy...

The challenge is finally activated!

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this time, Tiandao continued to send reminders...

[Challenge reminder: The target 'Four Elements God' has appeared! Kill the 'Four Elements God' within ten minutes, you can pass the assessment and get the Supreme Star Lord! „Äë

[Reminder: If you succeed in obtaining the Supreme Star Lord, you can randomly awaken 3 innate avenues and 30 acquired avenues. „Äë

[Reminder: After 20 seconds, start the challenge! Please be prepared for both! „Äë

„ÄêCountdown: 20‚Ä¶19‚Ä¶„Äë

Boom~!

When he heard the prompt, Qin Feng was amazed!

It turned out that as long as he destroyed the Four Elements God in front of him within ten minutes, he could obtain the Supreme Star Lord.

And after obtaining the Supreme Star Lord, you can randomly awaken three innate avenues!

Heaven's Road!

It is related to Qin Fengyu's advancement, and it is also related to his progress in becoming Heavenly Dao, which is one of the things he longs for!

It's just that it is too difficult to awaken the Innate Dao, and he has only awakened 31 of them so far.

However, he can't be too happy too soon!

He has to kill the target within ten minutes, that's not easy!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng spy on the demon **** ahead...

[Evil spirits]: Four-phase gods (Qiangliang, Xizi, Xingshou, Xuanming)

[Realm]: Half-step eternal limit

[Combat Strength]: 17 trillion stars

[Characteristic]: The guardian spirit of the whip...

[Remarks]: After the fusion, the four-phase **** has a wisdom beyond ordinary people...

The basic combat power of 17 trillion stars!

This strength is far stronger than Brahma!

It is not easy to kill it within ten minutes!
