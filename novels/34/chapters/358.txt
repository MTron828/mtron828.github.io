Swish~!

Before the beast **** could recover from his astonishment, behind him, the light of the sword shone through the sky, one after another.

In the next second, the Heavenly Sword Qi slashed straight at him!

"court death!"

The Beast God quickly turned around to resist.

Knives and fists collide!

Sonic shock!

Ten thousand energy swept all directions!

Both sides were shaken back a hundred feet!

This time, the beast **** hurriedly turned around to block it. Ten percent of his combat power was only able to exert ninety percent, and he was evenly matched with Qin Feng!

"Damn!"

Beast God is furious!

Obviously, his combat power is a lot stronger, but he has only fought evenly. What is this?

This is simply a great disgrace to him!

At the moment, he roared and slaughtered Qin Feng again.

The two sides fought together.

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

Bang~! Bang~! Bang~!

Suddenly, the field was so dark that the sun and the moon had no light!

Thousands of miles of soul sea, huge waves!

Endless void, broken inch by inch!

What made the beast unexpected is that in this fight, the two sides actually killed one evenly.

This is Qin Feng's cleverness.

He knew that his combat power was not as good as that of a beast god, so he made full use of the advantage of speed and went back and forth.

Let the beast **** not be able to attack with all his strength, there is a feeling of suffocation with nowhere to go!

In the blink of an eye, the two sides fought for thousands of rounds and fought for a quarter of an hour.

For a time, no one can do anything to anyone!

Qin Feng is satisfied with such a victory.

All he wants is to delay time and wait for Xiao Luan'er to leave the customs.

A quarter of an hour has passed in the outside world, and an hour and a half has passed in the zero-degree space.

Xiao Luan'er has already refined the second group of blood essence, and is currently refining the third group of blood essence.

At the same time, Qiyue was refining the second group of blood essence.

It was at this moment that the battle on the field changed.

A loud bang!

Qin Feng and the Beast God suddenly separated.

Above the vast sea, the two face each other!

At this moment, the Beast God was extremely annoyed and aggrieved.

However, he also coveted Qin Feng's body more and more.

With such a body with all nine elements, if he is allowed to obtain it, then it is hoped that he will acquire the SSS-level bloodline talent.

Thinking of this, the Beast God's heart became hot.

At the moment, he looked at Qin Feng coldly.

"It's time for you to see! The true strength of this deity!"

As soon as the words fell, he turned his palm over, and a golden divine seal slowly rose from the center of his palm...

I saw the golden divine seal, with thousands of ancient seal seals engraved on both sides.

The Dao Dao Divine Runes exude a heavenly light!

Those auras present nine colors, and they contain the nine laws of gold, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, thunder, light, and darkness.

The only pity is that the Divine Seal is cracked in the middle, and the corners are also broken and incomplete.

Qin Feng was surprised and quickly peeped away

[Beast God Seal (broken): ninth-order item (incomplete), because it is broken, its power is damaged. „Äë

[Effect 1: Use this seal to create various totem patterns. Totem Divine Rune can temporarily activate various divine blood powers. „Äë

[Effect 2: Fusion of this seal can refine the essence and blood of all divine beasts for one's own use, thereby continuously strengthening one's own divine blood and reaching the SSS-level bloodline talent. „Äë

Seeing this, Qin Feng's eyes lit up and he was surprised.

As far as he knows, any kind of bloodline talent, the strongest level can only reach SS level, then there is no further progress.

Even the legendary Qinglong, Suzaku, Xuanwu, and Baihu, these four top mythical beasts, their bloodline level can only reach the peak of SS level, which is still a line away from SSS level.

But possessing this seal of the beast can actually break this limit and achieve the legendary SSS-level bloodline talent.

Obviously, this divine seal is to gather the power of the blood essence of the gods and beasts to break through the shackles in one fell swoop and reach the top SSS level.

If he can get this divine seal, then he will have the opportunity to acquire another SSS-level talent.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng's heart is also hot.

However, there are some hints below the seal.

Qin Feng continued to watch...

[Refining conditions: Those who have the talent of the true dragon blood, master the talents of gold, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, thunder, light, and darkness at the same time, and awaken the seventh consciousness, Mana, can perfect refining. „Äë

[Reminder: If the refining is successful, you can absorb any kind of divine beast essence and blood, continuously strengthen your own essence and blood, and finally reach the SSS level bloodline level. „Äë

[Reminder: This divine seal has been damaged and cannot be used for refining. The blood of the thunder-type divine beast needs to be repaired. „Äë

Seeing this, Qin Feng was even more excited.

His conditions were almost exactly matched.

Refining this beast **** seal requires the talent of true dragon blood. I think it is because the dragon is the spirit of all beasts, and its essence and blood can naturally suppress the essence and blood of all beasts.

And Qin Feng has the blood of a real dragon.

At the same time, he also has the talent of the nine elements, which fully meets the refining conditions.

The only thing that doesn't match is that he hasn't awakened his seventh sense.

It seems that after the task here is completed, he has to hurry to complete the foundation of the gods.

As long as the foundation is completed, he can immediately awaken the seventh sense.

At that time, he can completely refine the Divine Seal.

However, the premise of all this is that he can kill the beast **** and take the beast **** mark.

At the same moment, the Beast God looked at the Divine Seal in front of him with a complicated expression.

He does not have the talent of the Nine Elements and cannot completely integrate the Divine Seal.T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com

Therefore, he can only rely on the talent of dragon blood and the law of four poles, and use the secret technique to temporarily integrate the divine seal.

This fusion is time-limited, and it can only be integrated for half an hour at most.

After half an hour has passed, the fusion will automatically disengage.

However, half an hour is enough!

Thinking of this, the beast **** hand pinched a seal.

The divine seal immediately lit up with dazzling golden light, emitting a dazzling nine-color light, and then turned into a nine-color aura that flew into his eyebrows

Boom~Long~Long!

For a moment, the Beast God‚Äôs body roared constantly, the heaven and earth resonated with it, and the laws of the Nine Elements surged!

The momentum was astonishing!

In just a moment, a golden divine pattern condensed between his eyebrows, and a circle of light emerged from the back of his head, which made him extremely sacred.

So far, the Divine Seal has been successfully merged!

The next second, the beast **** waved his hand again, and seven **** of blood essence appeared in front of him.

I saw the blood of the seven divine beasts, all of them exuding aura, and their breath was shocking.

This appearance makes the law of heaven and earth shake!

Qin Feng hurriedly spy on those blood essence

[Suzaku blood essence (middle grade), seventh-order item]

[White tiger blood essence (middle grade), seventh-order item]

[Golden Crow Blood Essence (middle grade), seventh-order item]

[Yuewu blood essence (middle grade), seventh-order item]

[Kunpeng blood essence (middle grade), seventh-order item]

[Zhu Yan blood essence (middle grade), sixth-order item]

[Soaring snake essence and blood (middle grade), sixth-order item]

Seeing this, Qin Feng was a little dumbfounded.

These seven groups of blood essence are actually all the blood essence of the mid-level beasts, which is one level higher than the blood essence of the nine great beast emperors.

The only difference is that there is no real dragon blood essence and unicorn blood essence.

Because of the blood essence of the real dragon, the beast **** can refine it himself.

The Qilin blood essence belongs to the thunder-type beast, and the seal of the beast is broken, so it cannot guide the refining process.

It turned out that the beast **** merged with the seal to temporarily fuse the seven groups of blood essence to enhance his strength.

The blood essence of the seven regiments of the middle grade!

This has to be integrated, and the combat power is only afraid to skyrocket to an extremely terrifying level.

After thinking about this, Qin Feng's face changed slightly, and he felt bad.

Chapter 315 Capture blood essence! Foundation building upgrade!

The blood essence of the seven regiments of the middle grade!

This has to be integrated, and the combat power will soar to an extremely terrifying level.

After thinking about this, Qin Feng's face changed slightly, and he felt bad...

no!

He must stop it!

Boom~!

Qin Feng's figure flashed, and he rushed towards the beast **** in front of him!

He must stop the beast **** from refining those mid-grade blood essence.

Otherwise, once the beast gods are all refined, he will surely die!

At the same moment, the beast **** hand pinched the seal, and tried his best to activate the **** seal.

Boom~Long~Long!

At this moment, the Beast God roared in the body, and the whole body lit up with a dazzling golden light.
