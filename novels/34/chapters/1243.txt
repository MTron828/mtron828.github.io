Xiao Luan'er said worriedly: "Sister Yue'er, the challenge threshold for the ninth-rank **** position, but it requires 200 million combat power!"

Qi Yue comforted: "Luan'er, don't worry! The master has never let us down! This time will be no exception!"

"Well! I hope so!"

Speaking of which, Xiao Luan sighed.

Little girl didn't know that Qin Feng had already won the **** position, and it was a tenth-grade **** position higher than the ninth-grade **** position!

At this time, Xiao Luan'er said again: "Stop talking about that! Sister Yue'er, let's continue to look for opportunities!"

"Um!"

The two withdrew their gazes towards the direction of the temple.

"By the way, Sister Yue'er, my father said that there are some ancient inheritances hidden in this land of the gods. We have turned a lot of places and found nothing!"

Xiao Luan murmured again.

Qiyue smiled and said: "The ancient heritage is extremely rare, how can it be so easy to find?"

Xiao Luan'er nodded: "Yes! It's a pity! The time given by Heaven is too short, only those who have passed the second round of chance assessment will have the opportunity to enter here. I am afraid that many people have passed the assessment, but have no time to come here. explore!"

Qi Yue smiled and said, "Isn't this even better! The fewer people who dabble in this divine relic, the more chance there will be undiscovered, and the greater the chance for us!"

These words just fell, and there was a phoenix cry in the distance!

Boo~~!NnÃªw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

The two girls were shocked, and they quickly followed the sound of 880 to look, and saw that hundreds of thousands of miles away, there was a projection of a holy beast floating in the air!

The projection of the holy beast is as high as hundreds of millions of feet, its body is like a phoenix, with red feathers all over its body, and its whole body is burning with golden flames, and its imposing manner is extremely extraordinary!

When Xiao Luan'er saw the projection of the holy beast, the blood in his whole body suddenly boiled!

"Suzaku! That's Suzaku!"

Xiao Luan shouted excitedly.

Her body is Hongluan, the descendant of the Suzaku holy beast, and she has the bloodline of Suzaku in her body.

So as soon as the Suzaku projection appeared, the Suzaku bloodline in her body was awakened!

At the moment, Qiyue's eyes widened: "That must be the activation of the ancient Vermillion Bird inheritance! Luan'er, your chance has come! Go! Let's go!"

"Um!"

As soon as the voice fell, the two girls were ready to go!

But at this moment, the mutation regenerates!

roar~~!

Another roar of a heaven-shattering beast, like the roar of a dragon!

In the next second, next to the Vermillion Bird projection, another projection of a holy beast appeared, which was also hundreds of millions of feet tall, with an extraordinary momentum!

And when Qi Yue saw the projection of the holy beast, her blood boiled!

I saw the projection of the holy beast, the head of a dragon and the body of a lion and the body of a cow, and the whole body was covered in cyan scales, and its imposing manner was extraordinary!

That is the ancient holy beast - the unicorn!

"Hey! That's the unicorn holy beast! Sister Yue'er, your chance has also appeared!"

Xiao Luan's face was full of excitement.

Qiyue is also very excited!

Their Qi family is the descendant of Qilin, and this inheritance is perfect for her.

"Luan'er, let's go!"

At the moment, the two little girls flashed and rushed towards the direction of the projection of the holy beast.

It didn't take long for the two to arrive at the place where the holy beast was projected!

That's near a huge star!

Look at that star, it's the size of the sun!

At this moment, in the void next to the star, two huge light holes appeared!

The projections of the Vermillion Bird and the Qilin are emitted from the two light holes!

Obviously, the inheritance of Suzaku and Qilin is in those two light caves!

Seeing this, Qiyue and Xiaoluan'er were very excited!

However, the two little girls were not in a hurry to harvest the inheritance, but looked up at the front, and there was still a person standing there.

At this moment, that person also looked at Qiyue and Qiyue with a look of surprise!

The two sides looked at each other for a while, and the man took the initiative to fly over.

"It turned out to be two girls! I don't know where is brother Qin Feng now?"

The visitor takes the initiative to speak.

It turned out that this person is Qingdi!

He recognized at a glance that Qi Yue and Xiao Luan'er were subordinates beside Qin Feng.

He has always been in awe of Qin Feng!

What's more, the two of them are of the same blood, so naturally he is very polite to Qiyue and Qiyue.

When the two of Qiyue first saw Qingdi, they were in awe.

This guy is a powerful man in the middle stage of the God King, and he is the strongest existence in the Holy Land except Qin Feng.

At this time, they saw that Qingdi's attitude was so gentle, and the guard in their hearts was slightly lowered.

Thinking about it, the Qing Emperor and the master seem to be from the same clan.

Shouldn't target them!

The two little girls murmured in their hearts.

They only roughly know the relationship between Qingdi and Qin Feng, and they are not familiar with each other, so they will naturally be wary.

"It turned out to be Lord Qingdi! My master is in the Nine Heavens Temple!"

Qi Yue said something casually.

"That's it! If you go to the Nine Heavens Temple, you won't be able to get out in a while! There are two ancient opportunities here, and Qing still wants him to try it. Now it seems that he may have to miss it!"

Qingdi said anxiously.

Qi Yue's heart moved: "Master Qingdi, did you open the entrance to the inheritance of the 'Vermilion Bird' and 'Kirin'?"

Emperor Qing nodded: "Yeah! I accidentally discovered that there were two space nodes hidden near this star, and I used a secret method to open them. Only after I opened it did I discover that they were actually the inheritance of the Vermillion Bird and the inheritance of the Qilin!"

"This is the top inheritance in the Land of God's Legacy! It is rumored that Suzaku and Qilin were half-step eternal, but their comprehensive strength is infinitely close to the eternal realm!"

Boom~!

Infinitely close to the eternal realm!

Qiyue and Xiaoluan'er were stunned!

They knew that Suzaku and Qilin were strong, but they didn't expect them to be so strong!

At this time, Emperor Qing smiled again and said: "Though these two ancient inheritances are good, unfortunately the requirements are too harsh! The Qilin inheritance needs people who have the Qilin bloodline to go in and inherit. The Vermillion Bird inheritance requires the Vermillion Bird bloodline!"

"Unfortunately! Qing does not have those two bloodlines, even if the inheritance portal is opened, he will not be able to enter!"

Speaking of which, Qingdi looked helpless.

Qiyue and Xiaoluan'er looked at each other, their eyes lit up.

Immediately, Xiao Luan'er couldn't wait to say: "Senior Qingdi, can you inherit the inheritance as long as you have the Vermillion Bird bloodline?"

Qingdi smiled bitterly: "The theory is so! But in this huge land of gods, where can you find people with the blood of the Suzaku? People with the blood of the Suzaku are extremely rare in this world!"

"Besides, this Suzaku heritage entrance is only open for ten minutes. It has been open for seven minutes, and only the last three minutes are left to close! If it is closed, I will not be able to open them again!"

As soon as these words came out, the two little girls became anxious.

They don't want to see the entrance closed!

At that moment, Xiao Luan'er volunteered and said, "Senior Qingdi, I have the blood of the Vermillion Bird! Let me try!"

"Hey! You have the Suzaku bloodline?"

Emperor Qing looked up at Xiao Luan'er with an unexpected look on his face.

But in the next second, he shook his head and smiled bitterly: "Little girl, although you have the Suzaku bloodline, you are truly in the realm of God. With such strength, I'm afraid you won't be able to enter the place of Suzaku's inheritance!"

Xiao Luan'er was surprised: "Why?"

Emperor Qing pointed to the Suzaku inheritance entrance and said, "The door of light at the inheritance entrance has a protective mask! Did you see it?"

"That is the first assessment of entering the inheritance. You need an attack power of 2 billion stars to break through that mask! Otherwise, you will not be able to enter!"

2 billion combat power!

That is the ultimate combat power of the Lord God Realm!

True God Realm is absolutely impossible to achieve!

Therefore, Emperor Qing thought that Xiao Luan'er could not reach it!

But she didn't want to, Xiao Luan'er raised her mouth: "Is it only 2 billion? Then I'll try it!"

As soon as these words came out, Qing Di was slightly taken aback!

What is only 2 billion? !

That's really

Qingdi was speechless!

If he remembered correctly, this little girl was in the False God realm before.

She should have just been promoted to True God Realm!

A little girl who has just stepped into the realm of true gods, it is not bad to have tens of millions of combat power, but it is really speechless to even look down on 2 billion combat power!

Qingdi shook his head again and again in his heart, feeling that Xiao Luan'er was talking a lot.

At this moment, Xiao Luan'er has taken the initiative to fly to the Suzaku inheritance entrance.

There are only 3 minutes left, and the inheritance entrance will be closed, and the little girl doesn't want to miss it.

Soon, she arrived at the entrance light gate

Qingdi looked at her back with a speechless expression, and kept muttering in his heart!

Could it be that this little girl thought that the entrance challenge was useless because of her Suzaku bloodline?

Or does this girl think I'm lying to her?

It seems that she won't believe it if she won't be let down!

Thinking of this, Emperor Qing looked on at his leisure.

At this moment, Xiao Luan'er has already waved her delicate little fist and smashed it hard towards the mask in front of her!

Qingdi still smiles calmly!

He never felt that a True God Realm could smash open a 2 billion energy-level light door without using weapons!

Whoo~!

At this moment, Xiao Luan'er's fist fell!

Bang~!

A loud bang!

The starry sky shakes violently!

Kacha~!

Then, a crisp sound!

The door of light shattered!
