With the flash of white light, Qin Feng passed through the door of light, and his eyes lit up!

He looked around, and he came to a huge square again.

The square was empty, and he was alone.

The square is surrounded by a silvery white mist, which is somewhat different from the gray Taixu mist.

Boom~Long~Long~!

Without waiting for Qin Feng to see more, the sky began to shake, and the voice of Tiandao also came.

[Congratulations to the contestant 'Qin Feng' for entering 'Tianchutian'! You passed the first round of Star Master assessment and received the 'fifth-class Star Lord' reward! 】

[Reminder: Fifth-level Star-Lord reward points: 'personal reward' and 'planet reward'! 】

[Personal rewards are issued in the secret territory; planetary rewards need to be returned to the planet before the planet where they are located will receive heavenly rewards! 】

[Now we will start to distribute the personal rewards of 'Five Star-Lord', the contents are as follows]

[Reward players + 100 million star combat power! 】

[Reward players + 10,000 reputation points! 】

[Reward players + 1x luck value! 】

[Reward players + 2 merit points! 】

[Reward players to randomly awaken an acquired avenue! 】

Qin Feng was slightly taken aback!

The personal reward of this fifth-rank Star-Lord is nothing more than that!

Come to think of it, some of the best in the main **** realm will have the opportunity to obtain the fifth-rank Star Lord, and naturally it will not be very strong!

Om~!

Without waiting for Qin Feng to think about it, a beam of reward light fell from the sky and landed on Qin Feng.

His combat power, prestige, luck, and merit have all increased, and a new avenue of light has also lit up on his body.

In just a moment, the reward is over!

Qin Feng slowly opened his eyes, and the corners of his mouth were slightly raised.

In any case, he still gained something, all kinds of indexes have increased, and a new avenue has been awakened!

In this way, he has mastered 767 avenues!

Boom~Long~Long~!

Before Qin Feng was happy, Tiandao sent another reminder

[It was detected that the player 'Qin Feng' arrived at Taichutian in 11 minutes and received double extra rewards for this round]

【Additional rewards are as follows】

[Reward players with 100 million star combat power! 】

[Reward players + 20,000 reputation points! 】

[Reward the player + 5 times the luck value! 】

[Reward players + 5 merit points! 】

[Reward players to randomly awaken 10 acquired avenues! 】

[After the reward is doubled, the content is changed as follows]

[Reward players with 200 million star combat power! 】

[Reward players + 40,000 reputation points! 】

[Reward players + 10,000 times the luck value! 】

[Reward players + 10,000 merit points! 】

[Reward players to randomly awaken 20 acquired avenues! 】

Boom~!

After listening to the prompt, Qin Feng was shocked and full of surprises!

No way? !

This extra reward is so rich, far beyond the personal reward of the fifth-rank Star-Lord!

As long as you pass 10 trillion miles within 7 hours, you can get the fifth-class Star Lord.

As an extra bonus, it takes 30 minutes to reach the finish line!

The difficulty in the middle is hundreds of times different!

As for the double bonus, it's more difficult.

It is understandable that there will be such a gap in the rewards!

correct!

Wouldn't there be such additional rewards in the next few rounds of assessments?

If so, this time you will make a lot of money!

Qin Feng's eyes lit up, and he seemed to see the hope of breaking through 6 trillion in combat power!

hum~~!

Before he could think about it, a golden reward beam of light fell, covering his body.

Boom~Long~Long~!

Suddenly, his combat power, prestige, luck, and merit value skyrocketed all the way!

He also lit up dozens of avenues of spiritual light...

After a long time, all rewards are over!FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Qin Feng slowly opened his eyes, his face full of ecstasy.

With this reward, his basic combat power has skyrocketed to 4.86 trillion stars, and his strength has increased a lot!

In addition, his luck value has soared to 294,000 times, his reputation has reached 3.34 million points, and the number of avenues has reached 787!

Qin Feng is extremely satisfied with such an improvement!

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, Tiandao came to remind again

[Assessment reminder: it is detected that the contestant has obtained the 'fifth-class star-lord', and you automatically activate the assessment rules of the 'fourth-class star-lord']

[Rule: The player enters the evil spirit of the beginning and keeps going west. At the end of the sea of ​​fog, there is the entrance door to the 'Tai Shi Tian'! 】

[Rule: Players who break into the ‘Tai Shitian’ within 5 hours, that is, pass the second round of assessment, can immediately obtain the personal reward of the ‘Fourth-Class Star Lord’! 】

[Reminder: From here to the entrance of Taishitian, it is about 13 trillion miles! 】like】

【Athletes who arrive at Taishitian within 30 minutes can get additional rewards! Arrive within 15 minutes and get double the bonus! 】

13 trillion miles!

This distance is 3 trillion miles longer than the first round, and it is also 30% more difficult to obtain additional rewards!

Qin Fengxin couldn't help muttering in 517!

Fortunately, he got double the extra reward in the first round, and his strength has improved a lot, and he is still expected to get double the extra reward in the second round!

Having said that, the difficulty of the second round has increased, and it is estimated that the rewards will be more generous!

At this time, Tiandao's prompt continued to come...

[Reminder: Those diabolical mists of Absolute Beginning contain the 'Power of Absolute Beginning', which has a certain restraint on the strength of the players! By mastering the 'Tai Chu Dao', players can be unchecked. 】

[Reminder: There are a large number of extraterrestrial demons hidden in the evil fog of the beginning, and their strengths range from the quasi-god king to the half-step eternal peak, and they are not restrained by the power of the beginning! 】

In the beginning of the fog? !

It should be the silver-white strange fog outside!

Qin Feng looked at the white mist outside the square and showed a smile.

He has mastered the Great Dao of Absolute Beginning, and he is still unaffected by these evil mists!

[Reminder: After the contestant leaves the square, the second round of assessment will be automatically activated]

Om~!

At this time, the star master assessment order in Qin Feng's hand lit up with a faint golden light, and the information in it had been updated.

He thought about it, and hurriedly peeped away.

【Player】: Qin Feng

[Meritory Points]: 12,000 points

[Fifth Star-Lord]: Acquired

[Fourth-Class Star Lord]: To be assessed

Qin Feng smiled and put away the assessment order.

He is not in a hurry to participate in the second round of assessment, it is time to go back and clean up Brahma

Boom~Long~Long~!

As soon as Qin Feng's mind moved, he turned into an extraterritorial demon again, and his momentum was raised to the strongest state again.

This time, his momentum has reached 14 trillion stars, which is a lot stronger than before!

Qin Feng was overjoyed!

Immediately, he turned around and walked towards the entrance light gate of the early days.

After he passed through the gate of light, he returned to the final square of Taixutian.

Qin Feng looked up and looked forward, where there was a thick suffocating suffocation.

"I don't know when Brahma will arrive? He wants to get double the reward. It is estimated that there is only the last minute left?"

Qin Feng muttered in his heart.

Then, with a flash of his figure, he rushed into the mist in front of him.

At the moment when he entered the thick fog, his eyes lit up and he looked forward with surprise.

He sensed that, hundreds of millions of miles away, a figure was rushing towards this side, it should be Brahma!

That guy's strength was suppressed by the power of Taixu, and the speed was slower than Qin Feng expected!

This time, Qin Feng wants to kill Brahma back so that he won't get any additional rewards, let alone get double rewards.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng flashed away and greeted Brahma

Chapter nine hundred and sixty-eight Brahma's plan! Terrible death on the spot!

At the same time, in the depths of the Taixu evil fog.

Brahma is on his way at full speed.

At this moment, his face was already showing joy.

He can sense that there are still 700 million miles before reaching the end.

And the time he spent was only 14 minutes and 17 seconds, and it was only 43 seconds away from 15 minutes!

43 seconds is enough for him!

It's only 700 million miles away, and he can get there in just twenty seconds!

Ha ha!

Double bonus rewards are coming soon!

With this thought in mind, Brahma accelerated towards the finish line!

In a blink of an eye, 10 seconds passed, and he was still 400 million miles away from the finish line!
