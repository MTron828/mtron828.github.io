Level 4 Longyuan Village becomes Level 5 Longyuan Town.

They are about to face the 5th-level Heavenly Punisher!

Level 5 Heavenly Punisher is the pinnacle of the Earth Level!

That is a dominant powerhouse, much stronger than Jiuzhongtian!

Can Boss Qin Feng handle it?

Did he make a mistake?

Thinking of this, the crowd wailed

Chapter two hundred and seventieth punishment comesAall ùíèùíÜwest chùíÇptùíÜrs on n.o./vùíÜlùíÉi/n/(.)cùíêm

"Level 5 punishment! I'm going crazy!"

"Boss, did you make a mistake?"

"Yes! Boss, did you accidentally click a key to upgrade?"

The crowd wailed.

One by one looked at Qin Feng and wanted to cry without tears.

Qin Feng looked down calmly.

"It was me who took the initiative!"

What? !

Everyone was shocked.

The boss actually took the initiative!

Could it be that he is going to challenge the Level 5 Heavenly Punisher?

That is the hegemonic powerhouse at the pinnacle of the prefecture level!

Everyone was stunned and looked at each other face to face.

Qin Feng said calmly: "Don't worry, everyone, since I do this, I naturally have my reasons."

"Yes! The boss has always been calm in his work. He must have his reasons to upgrade the village."

"Yes! I also believe in the boss!"

"But... the boss seems to have the strength of Jiuzhongtian, can he really deal with the peak of the prefecture level?"

"Well... Maybe there is a chance. Otherwise, the boss will not upgrade the village."

"However, I'm still worried!"

"Yeah! We were worried about the 4th-level Heavenly Punisher before. This 5th-level Heavenly Punisher, I'm afraid... It's really disturbing!"

"Don't talk about that much. The punishment will start in a while, and we don't know why the boss has to upgrade!"

"That's right!"

Boom~Long~Long!

Just then, the sky shook.

Om~! Om~! Om~!

One after another, reward beams of light fell from the sky!

The attribute points of the townspeople skyrocketed, each by 1600 points.

Such a majestic reward made everyone elated and began to add points.

At the same time, above the sky.

Xiao Luan'er also received 1600 attribute rewards, which were automatically allocated.

In just an instant, the little guy skyrocketed his 30-star combat power.

Today, its combat power has reached 750 stars. After controlling the power of 937 heaven and earth, it will be 1050 stars, not far from the peak of the earth level.

And Qin Feng got 3,200 attribute rewards, plus 100 points in the novice assessment, a total of 3,300 points.

So many attribute rewards!

If other villages know about it, they must be crazy with envy!

At this time, Qin Feng clicked on the personal interface, and happily added the point...

At the same moment, in the Blue Star Realm, above the Nine-layered Hall of the Vientiane Temple, there were already shadows, and some mysterious figures appeared.

Those are the gods!

At the same time, there were about 30 mysterious figures in the Temple of Vientiane on Tongtian Lake.

As soon as the group appeared, they whispered.

"It's time for us to execute the punishment!"

"The performance of this Blue Star Realm is unsatisfactory! Out of ten million novice villages, only 310,000 have established villages, which is only a 3.1% success rate."

"Haha! After I wait for the divine punishment assessment, I wonder if there are still 200,000 villages that can survive?!"

"If you don't have 200,000 seats, then you don't even have a 2% success rate. This kind of achievement, not to mention compared with the world of Zhongqian and Daqian, even if it is compared with the world of Xiaoqian, it is still at the bottom."

"It seems that this Blue Star Realm is destined to be eliminated! I'm afraid these Blue Star people still don't know the terrifying fate of being eliminated."

"The Blue Star Realm may not be eliminated. A level 5 village has appeared in the Blue Star Realm!"

"Level 5 villages? Even in the Great Thousand Worlds, it's hard to find a few. Could it be that Longyuan Village?"

"That's right! It's Longyuan Village!"

"That Longyuan Village is really a unique tree! Now it seems that it is the only hope for the Blue Star Realm."

"Stop gossip! Act!"

As soon as the voice fell, more than 30 mysterious figures disappeared out of thin air...

At the same moment, over the headquarters of Longyuan Village.

Qin Feng has finished adding points.

After this addition, his combat power has skyrocketed, reaching 1660 stars.

At the same time, those villagers also finished adding points, and their strength skyrocketed.

There are more than 90 people who have broken through 100 stars and reached the peak of human level.

The combat power has broken 50 stars, and there are more than 4,000 people.

Such power has become a scale.

Having said that, this time the subordinates' combat power has increased, but they have not received feedback, nothing more than the number of feedback has reached the limit.

After he has dealt with the Heavenly Punishment assessment, it is time to seize the Cangtu Ministry's stronghold and increase the maximum number of feedback...

As long as he increases the upper limit of the number of people, it will be a large wave of attribute rewards, I am afraid that it is much more than the attribute rewards obtained by upgrading to level 5 villages.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng's heart was hot again, and he was full of expectations for occupying the Cangtu Department.

At this moment, he didn't know yet that the Cang Clan had already dispatched a second wave of troops.

Mo Lao has led 2,000 people on the way.

Of course, Mo Lao has just set off. Even if he arrives at Tayue Town, it will be tomorrow morning...

"Master, my combat power has reached 210 stars."

At this moment, Qi Yue's joyful voice sounded in Qin Feng's ears.

"very good!"

Qin Feng was quite pleased.

According to this progress, Qiyue will soon be able to participate in the Shengwu assessment and be promoted to a prefecture-level powerhouse.

Qiyue: "Master, the punisher is coming soon, you have to be careful."

The little girl's tone was full of worry.

Like everyone else, she was very worried about Qin Feng's challenge to the 5th-level Heavenly Punisher.

The only difference is that she is more worried about Qin Feng's safety.

"Do not worry!"

Qin Feng calmed down.

After the end of the spiritual conversation, Qin Feng summoned the Jinglong Blade and incorporated the Spirit of Gold into it.

The battle is imminent!

He's ready to go!

At the same moment, after the townspeople below finished adding points, they began to whisper again.

"Brothers, there are only 2 minutes left in the countdown, and the punisher is coming soon."

"I don't know how strong Tiandao will send out a 5th-level Heavenly Punisher this time? I hope it's the kind that has just reached the threshold of the prefecture-level peak."

"Yeah! I think so too. If I'm a little stronger, I'm worried that the boss won't be able to beat him."

"If the boss loses, we will be miserable! Not only will the village be lowered from level 5 to level 4, but the attribute point rewards given by Tiandao just now will all be taken back."

"Yes! Everyone, let's pray that Tiandao will send a weaker punishment!"

"Little sister, pray now! God bless, please send a 5th-level Heavenly Punisher who has just reached the threshold of the prefecture-level peak. It must be the kind that can't beat my boss. Bless! Bless!"

At this moment, the crowd murmured constantly, and many people prayed to God...

Everyone's anxiety is evident.

With Qin Feng's hearing, he could hear it clearly.

However, he understands that everyone is worried about gains and losses, and he doesn't care.

Xiao Luan'er was a little unhappy.

These guys also underestimate Dad too much, thinking that Dad can't beat the threshold of the prefecture-level peak.

If the 5th-level Heavenly Punisher only has the strength of the peak threshold, then it does not need Dad to shoot, it can beat it.

Just when Xiao Luan'er was dissatisfied, a reminder came from Tiandao.

[Announcement to the whole world: The countdown is over, and the Heavenly Punishment Assessment has officially begun! „Äë

As soon as the news came out, the tense atmosphere in the field instantly reached its peak.

Everyone raised their heads, looked up at the sky, and waited for the appearance of the Heaven Punisher.

Even Qin Feng held his breath and waited for that moment.

At this moment, above the sky, a burst of space distorted.

Then, a mysterious black-robed man appeared out of thin air.

The punisher has come!

Everyone's heart was in their throats, and they all looked at the punisher.

I saw that the punisher was wearing a gold-trimmed black robe with a pattern of rusted Nine Heavens Crazy Thunder, and a dignified middle-aged man's face was revealed under the loose hood.

His eyes are charged with electricity, his breath is like abyss, and he has a noble bearing, which makes people unable to see the depth.

The townspeople couldn't see his strength at all.

Qin Feng immediately launched the Eye of Insight on the punisher.
