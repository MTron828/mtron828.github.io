Those two boys are really confusing. It is clear that the False God area is safer and has more opportunities to obtain resources, but they have to break into the high-level area, which is really overbearing!

roar~!

Just when the old man was thinking wildly, the giant beast in front of him rushed again.

The old man quickly raised his knife to resist!

huh~!

At this moment, a white light flashed in the field, and a stalwart figure appeared out of thin air!

One person and one beast, everyone is shocked!

The person here is a fission!

"It's you!"

The white-haired old man recognized the fission at a glance!

Isn't this the white-haired boy who doesn't know what to do?

Swish~!

But before he could think about it, the sword light flashed in the field!

Kacha~! Kacha~!

Two consecutive beeps!

Blood light shot again and again!

The old man and the giant beast were all killed in one move!

[You successfully killed the magic bear king (the peak of the main god), and obtained +90 trillion energy points, +430 golden judgment points]

[You successfully killed the Demon 957 Power Bear King (the peak of the Lord God) and obtained a Dao Crystal Fragment (Power)]

[Reminder: You have killed the player ‚ÄòBai Wei‚Äô, and you will get +1 sin value, and the total sin value is 4 points]

[Reminder: Your Heavenly Fate Divine Sword absorbs all the luck of 'Baixu', and your luck value is +11 times]

The fission body smiled slightly!

This time, he not only got a Dao crystal fragment, but also got 11 times the luck value, the harvest is very good!

At the moment, he put away the Dao crystal fragments with a wave of his hand.

After doing this, he dodged away and continued to hunt other players...

These players are already in competition with him, and they are kind to him, so he will not be soft-hearted.

Although a total of 10 sin points will be deducted by 1 point, but this 1 point is nothing in Qin Feng's eyes.

In this way, the fission body began to kill in the secret realm!

At the same time, on the square, at the entrance to the secret realm of power in the main **** area, a white light lit up from time to time.

Then, a main **** player was resurrected!

After those players were resurrected, all of them had strange expressions, full of anger, and incredible expressions!

Then, they returned to the secret realm with complex expressions!

Time is running out!

If they die once, they will be deducted 1 point. They have to hurry up and return to the secret realm to earn points!

They also vaguely felt that after the resurrection, there seemed to be something wrong.N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

Inexplicably, the strength seems to have become weaker!

These players didn't realize that their luck was taken away!

Destiny is intangible and invisible, if it is not the Lord of Fate, it is naturally difficult to detect!

In the square, those quasi-god kings and **** kings also felt strange.

At the entrance to the secret realm of power, the frequency of resurrection is significantly higher than that of other secret realms.

What the **** is going on inside?

Just when the gods and kings were suspicious, the king-level secret realm finally opened...

In front of the square, there was another empty space with no one, and nine gods were slowly raised.

All the quasi-god kings were all excited.

Finally they are reincarnated!

huh~!

At this moment, the main **** area, at the entrance of Devouring Avenue, lit up a white light, and the extreme yin body appeared out of thin air.

His appearance made those quasi-god kings frown slightly.

However, they only glanced at the body of the extreme yin, and then looked away.

At this moment, the attention of the quasi-god kings all fell on the **** monument in the king-level secret realm.

However, it is said that the extreme yin is reflected behind him, and his eyes are full of joy, and he seems to be in a good mood.

It turned out that he had already harvested 60 Dao Crystals in the Devouring Secret.

In addition, his level has risen to level 82, and his vocation has also risen to level 72.

And the 31 drops of ghost water he obtained before have all been refined.

This allowed Qin Feng's soul strength to reach 93.17% in the middle stage of the God King.

And Qin Feng's combat power has also increased to 14.53 billion stars.

In short, the very yin body is extremely satisfied with this harvest!

The only regret is that he did not find the 'Ghost Water' in the Devouring Secret Realm in the main **** zone.

Boom~Long~Long~!

It was at this moment that the nine divine monuments in the king-level secret realm had all risen!

The entrance light door of the secret realm also appeared!

The very yin body looked curiously, and it was still the nine avenues of wood and swallowing.

At the same moment, the quasi-god kings were eager to try.

However, they did not move, but looked at the nine people in the crowd with awe, that is, the nine **** kings.

In this world where strength is respected, only the strong will be respected!

These nine god-kings have not yet made a choice, and they dare not act rashly.

The nine **** kings all looked arrogant!

At this moment, they met and smiled.

Afterwards, the three most powerful mid-term **** kings stepped out of the crowd first.

There were also murmurs in the crowd.

"The three adults, Emperor Qing, Emperor Zi, and Emperor Jin, finally have to choose!"

"Yeah! You said that these three adults will choose which three avenues?"

"I don't know! Take your time!"

Hearing the discussion, Ji Yin was curious, so he followed the discussion and looked at the three of them.

Soon, he judged from the voices of the crowd.

The old man in the golden robe was named Golden Emperor.

The bald old man in the purple robe was named Zi Dijian.

The middle-aged man in the green robe, named Qingdi, had a combat power of nearly 400 million stars.

At this moment, the three **** kings also made a choice.

Emperor Jin walked towards the Secret Realm of Devouring Avenue...

Emperor Zi walked to the secret realm of the Avenue of Power...

Emperor Qing walked to the secret realm of Space Avenue...

When they made a choice, there was another muttering in the field.

"Sure enough! The avenues chosen by the three adults are the top 100 Houtian avenues!"

"Of course! With the strength of the three adults, why choose the ordinary Houtian Avenue?"

"That's right!"

With the muttering of everyone, the three of Qingdi got closer and closer to the entrance of the secret realm.

At this time, the other six god-king early-stage great powers also chose a secret entrance and walked to them...

The secret realms they choose are different!

Obviously, none of the nine god-kings wanted to meet in the secret realm to avoid killing each other.

They came to the secret territory to gain opportunities, not to kill each other, unless it was a last resort!

Seeing that the nine **** kings had made their choices, the more than one hundred quasi **** kings also began to choose, and they followed behind the **** kings and walked to the nine secret realms...

But at this moment, the voice of Heavenly Dao sounded in everyone's consciousness...

[Holy Land Reminder: The first round of secret realms has all been opened, and now we will start to issue scoring tokens and enter the scoring mode‚Ä¶]

Boom~Long~Long~!

As soon as this prompt ends, the sky begins to shake!

Afterwards, beams of light descended from the sky and landed in front of all the players...

Not only in the square, but even those players in the secret territory also heard the prompt, and a corresponding beam of light fell.

At this moment, the very yin body was stunned!

In front of him, a beam of light fell.

But he clearly sensed that in the secret realm of the Avenue of Power, there was a beam of light that fell in front of a polar sun fission body...

Before he could think about it, pieces of scoring tokens fell down the beams of light...

In just a moment, a black token fell in front of the extreme yin body.

This is the scoring token!

Scoring tokens are not the same as Holy Land Passes!

The Holy Land Pass, the moment you enter the Holy Land, disappears automatically and is a consumable item.

Scoring tokens are special tokens that players need to carry all the time in the Holy Land to record their performance at any time.

Thinking of this, the very yin body picked up the token and infiltrated the divine consciousness into the token...

[Player]: Qin Feng (the very negative body)

[Evil Value]: 0

[Daojing Score]: 120 points

Seeing this, the very yin body showed a strange color.

Then, he turned to look in the direction of the secret realm of power.

At the same time, in that secret territory of power.

Somewhere in the sky above the jungle, a polar Yang fission body, holding the Heavenly Fate Divine Sword in one hand, and the scoring token in the other, are also checking the information...

[Player]: Qin Feng (Jiyang body)

[Evil Value]: 37, 3 points deducted in total

[Daojing Score]: 113 points

[Cumulative points]: 110 points

Seeing this, the fission body also looked strange.
