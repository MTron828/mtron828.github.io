At least, their points were used to the best of their ability and nothing was wasted.

The resources in the mall were also exchanged for only 3% left!

After the resources were exchanged, Yu Xuanji and others left the Nine Heavens True Temple and went to the God's Relic Land outside to continue their search for opportunities.

At this point, the hall of the Nine Heavens Temple has become empty!

Qin Feng was the only one left in the field!

"There are still five hours before the Holy Land opportunity will end. I must complete the challenge of the outer world within these five hours and obtain the two ninth-rank divine positions!"

Thinking of this, Qin Feng felt a sense of urgency in his heart.

However, he still did not act immediately!

He still has to wait for the thirteen Taiqing Dao crystals to be refined before starting action!

In this way, his grasp is even greater.

At the same time, something was happening outside the Holy Land.

That Azure Dragon Star Region, within the Blue Star Realm.

The old nest of Longyuan City.

The 100,000 disciples of Longyuan are all suspended above the floating city, looking up at the direction of the exit of the Holy Land.

Now, all the disciples of one hundred thousand Longyuan are in the False God realm, and all of them have extraordinary imposing manners.

Headed by Liu Xuan, Elder Qishan, Granny Feng Qi, Granny Yusang, their fighting power has reached 50,000 stars, a proper True God Realm strength!

Hundreds of elite backbones such as Lei Jue, Liu Yuan, Fengying, Longshan, etc., have also broken through to more than 20,000 stars, and their strength has entered the level of the true god.

Today's Longyuan City, it can be said that everyone is like a dragon.

Qin Feng's original wish has been initially fulfilled.

At this time, everyone in Long Yuan looked at the exit of the Holy Land from afar, their expressions full of anticipation and worry.

In front of the crowd, Liu Xuan, Elder Qishan, and Granny Feng Qi were chatting.

"Mother Feng Qi, do you think the boss's return this time will break through to 500 million star combat power?"

Liu Xuan asked in a low voice.

Granny Feng Qi took a deep breath and said, "I'm afraid it will be very difficult!"

Elder Qishan also nodded slightly: "Yes! 500 million combat power is too difficult!"

Liu Xuan frowned: "If the boss's breakthrough is less than 500 million combat power, then there will be some trouble! Yeah, God is estimated to be coming soon, that guy has a combat power of 700 million stars!"

Granny Feng Qi smiled bitterly: "It is true! This should be our Longyuan City, the biggest crisis in history! If the master can reach 500 million combat power, he may be able to repel Yeshen! If he can't reach it, Longyuan will It's over! Hey!"

At the end, Granny Feng Qi's tone was full of worry.

Elder Qishan also sighed: "Faced with a terrifying existence like Yeshen, we are helpless and can only watch the master. Having said that, now not only are we Long Yuan worried, but many people are watching the show!"

As soon as these words fell, the elder Qishan looked into the distance.

I saw millions of people gathered in the sky thousands of miles away, all of them were heaven-level and earth-level humans.

Those are the leaders of all the guardian forces in the Blue Star Realm.

They all came to hear the news and came to watch.

Because they all know that in five or six hours, Qin Feng will come out of the Holy Land.

God is coming soon!

Most of these people looked worried.

Of course, they only worry about themselves, not Qin Feng!

They were afraid that Yeshen would destroy the entire Blue Star Realm in a rage, and they could not escape death.

As for Qin Feng's warning before he left, most of them don't remember it.

Before Qin Feng left, he said that after he came out of the Holy Land, he would not accept any force that wanted to take refuge in Longyuan City.

Waiting for the fate of those forces, only to be enslaved, or driven out of the Blue Star Realm!

pity!

For such warnings, few forces took it to heart.

Thinking of this, Liu Xuan said indignantly: "Haha! After so long, it's less than 1% of our Longyuan City power. These guys are obviously not optimistic about our boss!"

Hearing this, Elder Qishan looked at everyone in the distance and smiled coldly.

"These guys shouldn't be optimistic about the master! They don't know how many miracles the master has created! Just wait! After the master comes out, they will regret it!"

The tone of Elder Qishan was also somewhat resentful.

He is also quite dissatisfied with the attitude of the guardian forces!

Granny Feng Qi comforted her: "You two, don't be angry with these short-sighted people! When the master returns, they will open their eyes!"

Liu Xuan breathed a sigh of relief: "That's right! I won't say much now, let's wait for the boss to return slowly!"

"As it should be!"

At the moment, Long Yuan continued to wait for Qin Feng's return.

Chapter 919: The Sword of Emperor Xi! Chaos Spirit Egg!

Of course, many Long Yuan disciples are still worried about whether Qin Feng's combat power can reach 500 million stars.

If it doesn't reach 500 million stars, the future of Longyuan City will be worrying!

Thinking of this, everyone in Long Yuan became even more uneasy!

They didn't know that Qin Feng's combat power was approaching 400 million stars.

If Qin Feng wins the two major ninth-rank gods again, I am afraid that it will reach 500 million combat power, which is ten times their expected goal!

Of course, now that Qin Feng is facing the biggest challenge, he has to win the challenge of chance!

If the challenge is successful, his combat power will soar to 500 million stars, which is just around the corner!

But if the challenge fails, if he wants to be promoted to the True God Realm, he can only wait another hundred years.

Therefore, Qin Feng is extremely cautious about the challenge of Tianwaitian!

If there is no certainty, he will not easily shoot

At this moment, within the Holy Land.

In the hall of Jiutianzhen Temple.

Qin Feng is looking up at the Conferred God List in front of him.

"Calculate the time! The thirteen Taiqing Daojing should also be refined!"

Qin Feng muttered in his heart, and his brows were full of anxiety.

There were only four and a half hours left, and he couldn't wait any longer.

Is it going to the outer world like this?

His current basic combat power is only 379.1 billion stars, which is still a bit far from 400 million!

Why! That's it!

Time can't be delayed any longer!

Qin Feng sighed helplessly and was about to act.

Boom~Long~Long~!

But just after this thought came, an earth-shattering roar came from the center of his universe.

Tiandao also sent a reminder

[Your mind body refined Taiqing Daojing (turbid) successfully! You begin to awaken the Dao of the Heavenly Heaven‚Äîthe Dao of Turbidity]

[Your mind body refined Taiqing Daojing (Qing) successfully! You begin to awaken the avenue of the day after tomorrow - the avenue of clearness]

[Your mind body refined Taiqing Daojing (collapse) successfully! You begin to awaken the avenue of the day after tomorrow - the avenue of collapse]

what! Finally refining!

Qin Feng's eyes lit up!

Surprise!

At this moment, his momentum skyrocketed all the way.

It didn't take long for all the thirteen Taiqing Dao Crystals to be refined!

He thus obtained thirteen new avenues!

Qin Feng is very happy!

Boom~Long~Long~!

But before he was happy, an even more earth-shattering roar came from the center of the universe again.

[Your Mind Body refines the World-Destructing Daojing (Xiantian), you get 1% World-destroying Dao Rhyme, and the combat power +300 million stars]

[Congratulations for your epiphany realization of the Innate Avenue - the Destruction Avenue! You have been blessed by the power of the Dao, and the combat power has increased by +400 million stars]

[Your primary universe has successfully merged with the Dao of Destruction, and has been greatly strengthened, and you will permanently receive 400 million star power backfeeding from the universe]

Boom~!

Qin Feng is ecstatic again!

He actually awakened the Great Dao of Destruction when he needed it most!

This awakening is so timely!

The World Destruction Daojing was obtained by completing the task of 'Sword Executioner', which was obtained earlier than the thirteen Taiqing Daojing.

Until this moment, it has been refined!

It can be seen that the refining difficulty of Xiantian Daojing is far greater than that of Taiqing Daojing!

Now, the awakening of the Great Way of Destruction is also an unexpected joy!

The innate avenues he masters have reached fourteen!Ne/w novel chaptùíÜrs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

hum~~!

At this moment, Qin Feng's 'Cosmic Seal' automatically appeared on the center of Qin Feng's eyebrows, and the fourteenth green lotus petals began to condense.

At the same time, the Fortune Jade Plate was also automatically activated!

[Reminder: The Fortune Jade Disc automatically records the 'Road of Turbidity' you perceive, and you have received a permanent feedback of 100 million star combat power! „Äë

[Reminder: The Fortune Jade Disc automatically records the 'Avenue of Purity' you feel, and you have received a permanent feedback of 100 million star combat power! „Äë

Boom~Long~Long~!

Qin Feng's momentum continues to soar!

In the blink of an eye, the Fortune Jade Disc recorded 14 new avenues!

Qin Feng also slowly opened his eyes, his face full of joy!

After this, his basic combat power has soared to 392 billion stars, and he is just one line away from the goal of 400 million.

"It's only a little bit more~"!"

Qin Feng raised his head and looked at the Conferred God List in front of him.

His combat power is infinitely close to 400 million stars, which means that his success rate is infinitely close to 50%!

The odds are worth fighting for!

Besides, the 50% probability of the 400 million combat power is just a hint from the Conferred God Ranking!

What the real situation is, only when he enters Tianwaitian can he know.

With his methods, I am afraid that the probability of success will be higher.

After all, he has mastered 149 avenues, and the means are naturally endless, and it is easy to crush the same level!
