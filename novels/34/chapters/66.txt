In a blink of an eye, more than fifty ant colonies were killed by him, and only a dozen remained, at a terrifyingly fast speed.

His experience points are also raised to level 9 (5170/100000).

The points soared to 467 points!

Sand~! Sand~! Sand~!

But before Qin Feng could breathe a sigh of relief, General Ant Eater arrived with the ant colony army.

Whoo~!

I saw that the ant-devouring general was extremely fast, and with a 'huo', he rushed out of the ant colony and threw himself in front of Qin Feng.

That oversized body is more than two meters long, and the huge ant tongs are shining with cold light, which can cut gold and iron, and bite everything.

I saw General Ant Eater take a big mouth, and went to Qin Feng's neck yao.

"roll!"

Qin Feng slashed with a knife!

Swish~!

With a flash of sword light, the ant's head was beheaded!

General Ant Eater realized a hint of crisis, and his mind moved.

Click~! Click~! Click~!

In just an instant, its whole body condensed a pair of black steel armor.

When~!

A burst of gold and iron symphony!

Qin Feng intuitively felt that his arm was numb.

Fuck it~!

This ant-eater general is such a strong defense!

click~!

Immediately, there was a sound!

The black iron armor was split open with a large crack.

That knife also cut into the ant's head more than seven inches deep!

The next second, the huge body of General Ant Eater was blown away by the knife.

Bang~!

General Ant Eater fell heavily to the ground, knocking down a giant ant.

Sand~! Sand~! Sand~!

At the same time, dozens of soldier ants rushed towards Qin Feng one after another.

Qin Feng hurriedly danced with his long sword and slashed wildly!

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

Kacha~! Kacha~! Kacha~!

Fuck it~!

Personal Points Rewards Doubled!

Ha ha!

Cool!

So cool!

Qin Feng is ecstatic!

Squeak~! Squeak~! Squeak~!

It was at this moment that General Ant Eater staggered to his feet.

It was wounded in the head, but did not die.

The split black iron armor also healed automatically and was completely repaired.

At this moment, it stared at Qin Feng in horror, not daring to come forward and bite again.

Then, it made a strange noise.

As soon as the sound came out, the ant colony changed, and the battlefield situation changed drastically.

I saw a group of giant ants continue to pounce on Qin Feng one after another, entangled in Qin Feng.

Another group of giant ants has built an ant wall around the periphery.

One giant ant stepped on another giant ant, and it was superimposed one by one.

Qin Feng looked puzzled.

In the blink of an eye, a huge ant wall twenty meters high was superimposed.

Squeak~! Squeak~! Squeak~!

At this time, General Ant Devourer made a strange cry.

Boom~!

The ant wall collapsed suddenly and fell directly to Qin Feng.

Fuck it~!

Qin Feng was shocked and swung his long sword in succession.

But in the end, it couldn't stop the rain of ants from the ant wall.

In just a moment, he was engulfed by the ant colony.

The ant-eater general wanted to use ant colony tactics to kill Qin Feng alive.

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

Knife light flashes!

In just a few seconds, Qin Feng killed five or six giant ants in a row.

But in the next second, he realized that something was wrong.

There were too many giant ants that rushed up, and he couldn't kill them at all.

Many giant ants took the opportunity to bite, some on the arms, some on the legs, some on the neck, and some on the waist.

Those giant ants that bit him, tugging in all directions, even if they can't bite through the armor, they will cut him alive.

Of course, these giant ants can't hurt him.

But the giant ants are so powerful that they are pulled one by one, which greatly limits his movement and speed.

What's even more annoying is that these giant ants are not afraid of death.

Many of them are dead, and they still bite Qin Feng firmly.

Some only have a head left, still hanging on Qin Feng's arm, affecting Qin Feng's performance.

In just a moment, Qin Feng was covered with giant ants, both dead and alive, making it difficult for him to move, let alone slaughter the ant colony.

The fighter plane actually reversed at this moment!

Ants kill elephants! Nothing more than that!

Squeak~Squeak~Squeak~!

General Ant Eater is excited!

It screamed a few times and rushed up.

At this moment, Qin Feng can hardly move, it is the best time for it to take revenge.

Whoo~!

Light and shadow flash!

It killed Qin Feng in the blink of an eye.

But at this moment, a mutation suddenly occurred!

Boom~!

Qin Feng's whole body ignited a raging fire, rising into the sky, reaching a height of three feet!

Like a **** of fire!

The black-red flames shone with blue light, carrying the power of burning the sky and destroying the earth!

This is - hellfire!

The hellfire after the true awakening of the C-level flame!

Power surge!

All over the place!

Squeak~! Squeak~! Squeak~!

Suddenly, the giant ants screamed incessantly.F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The giant ants melted in the flames and fell from Qin Feng.

Ha ha!

This is Qin Feng's trump card!

If you don't use Hellfire, it will consume a lot of energy, and you can't use it all the time.

Qin Feng has already used it!

At this moment, he can't take care of that much anymore.

Whoo~!

At this moment, General Ant Eater killed him.

Swish~!

Qin Feng slashed with a knife.

There was a raging fire on that long knife!

Kacha~!

A crisp sound!

That knife split the black iron armor in an instant!

Split the head of General Ant Eater in half!
