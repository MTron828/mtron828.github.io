"Yes! It's probably the reason!"

"So, that kid is lucky!"

"Haha! No matter how good luck is, there is a limit! Could he still hold on for three or five minutes? That's too bad!"

"That's right! The old man doesn't believe it, that kid can really hold on for three or five minutes?

"That's right! Let's wait!"

Many people actually gambled to get angry!

At this moment, a strange phenomenon appeared in the field!

Tens of thousands of players did not go to the assessment, but stayed where they were, looking up at the exit of the nine-story pagoda!

In their opinion, Qin Feng will never last long, and maybe he will die in the next second!

They must watch this great show!

After all, it doesn't take much time!

Just like that, the audience continued to wait...

Time passed by every second!

Qin Feng's figure has not appeared for a long time!

The crowd is getting a little nervous!

In the air, the man in the yellow robe frowned more and more tightly, inexplicably a little unhappy!

In a blink of an eye, 3 minutes passed!

Qin Feng still did not appear!

Everyone vaguely felt that something was wrong.

However, everyone still held back their mood and continued to wait.

Many people are still extravagantly hoping that Qin Feng will die in the next second!

Especially the man in the yellow robe in the sky, he doesn't want Qin Feng to be in the limelight

The later Qin Feng came out, the stronger the limelight!

But things backfired. Five minutes passed after turning 517 eyes, and Qin Feng still did not appear.

This time, the audience can't sit still!

One by one the discussion continues!

I haven't shown up for more than 5 minutes, and I can't explain it with luck!

Is that kid's combat power really 1 trillion?

At this thought, everyone was extremely shocked!

Even the expression of the man in yellow robe became complicated.

time goes on

6 minutes! 7 minutes! 8 minutes!

Qin Feng still didn't show up!

The more people waited, the more shocked they became!

The loud discussion in the field has gradually turned into a whisper!

Every tone has changed!

No one dared to call Qin Feng 'that boy' anymore, but 'that man', even with a trace of respect

In the air, the eyes of the man in yellow robe also changed.

At this moment, he silently looked at the exit of the ninth floor, no longer arrogant.

9 minutes! 10 minutes! 11 minutes!

Qin Feng's figure still did not appear!

This time, the audience was amazed!

"My God! It's been 11 minutes! That...that guy hasn't come out yet!"

"Tsk tsk! 11 minutes! It's definitely not by luck, it can last for so long! It requires strength!"

"Yeah! It seems that we all underestimated that adult before!"

As soon as these words fell, everyone looked at each other with embarrassment.

In the air, the man in yellow robe was even more embarrassed, and his old face was inexplicably red.

At this time, some people started to get anxious.

"Everyone, it's been 11 minutes! It's too late for the assessment I'm waiting for! I can't wait anymore, I'm going to the assessment!"

"Yes! Don't wait! Don't wait! I can only say that the old man didn't have the chance to see that adult come out!"

"Hey! Yes! The assessment is still important!"

At this time, the crowd began to riot, and many people planned to go to the assessment.

After all, you can't afford to waste time!

At the same time, in the ninth floor of the Buddha Tower, in the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãchaotic fog.

Qin Feng is looking at the red fog in front of him with joy

Just now, he beheaded the last extraterrestrial demon!

That is a demon with a basic combat power of 3 trillion stars, and its strength is extremely powerful!

But in this chaotic fog, its strength was greatly suppressed, and it was even more vulnerable in front of Qin Feng!

In just two rounds, it was killed by Qin Feng

At this moment, its demon body disintegrated and turned into a fog demon.

The next second, a dazzling golden light flew out from the scattered red mist and poured into Qin Feng's body

„ÄêYour BMI increases by 100,000 points! „Äë

At this time, Qin Feng's body lit up with the white light of vocation upgrade!

He was amazed!

An extraterritorial demon with a combat power of 3 trillion is not ordinary!

He actually exploded 5 Taiqing Daojing for him at one time!

Having said that, he cut ten demons in a row this time, and accumulated a total of 40 Taiqing Daojing!

Among them, 33 are available, and the other 7 are the avenues that he has learned, which can be used by Long Yuan's children!

In that way, he can cultivate 7 more star field masters.

However, apart from Liu Xuan and other elites, the talents of Long Yuan's children are more ordinary, and there are not many people who have the ability to refine Dao Jing.

If Qin Feng wants to cultivate star masters in large numbers, he needs to promote all subordinates to the real **** realm!

In this way, the subordinates have the ability to refine Dao Jing!

However, that will be discussed later!

He created the 'Fengchan Heavenly Monument', and there is still a dark and yellow aura of heaven and earth.

Originally, he wanted to see if there were any Chaos Treasure Chests for sale in the Gongxun Pavilion mall, but there was none.

This made him a little worried!

Of course, that's all for the future!

The most important thing for him now is to complete the promotion to the main **** realm!

With only this in mind, Qin Feng put away the five Taiqing Daojing in front of him with a wave of his hand and sent them to the center of the small universe.UpdùíÇted chapters ùíên nùíêvelbin(.)com

After a long time, everything calmed down.
