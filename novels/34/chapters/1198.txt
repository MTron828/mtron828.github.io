Feng Xi's tone was a little unsure!

After all, this human being is too mysterious, and every shot changes greatly!

Who can be sure that there will be no changes this time?

However, Feng Xi's words made the demons feel a little more at ease!

After all, the time when Ji Yang's eyes are closed this time is too short, so there should be no change in strength!

But only after this thought came, Ji Yang's body lit up with white light, and his momentum began to soar!

That is Jiyang's body performing "faith sacrifice" to absorb the combat power of burning lamps!

In just an instant, he absorbed 24 billion star power from Ran Deng!

Swish~!

In the next second, Ji Yang's body slashed with all his strength and slashed down!

At that moment, the sword light in his hand suddenly lit up like a scorching sun, reflecting the sky and the earth, extremely dazzling!

That knowing attack is also launched simultaneously, and the attack power is instantly doubled!

"Not good! He shot!"

"Quick! Everyone, control the cloud flag!"

The faces of the demons changed greatly!

In the next breath, all the demons clasped their hands together and controlled the plain-colored cloud world flag together!

"Don't worry! He can't break it!"

At the same time, Long Bo's cry resounded in the demon group!

So far, he still has a bit of luck in his heart!

He didn't believe it, the strength of Ji Yang's body would skyrocket every time he opened his eyes!

If so, that would be terrifying!

sigh~~!

Just when this thought came to mind, there was a sound of void splitting in the air!

The sword of Ji Yang's body cuts through the sky, and wherever the blade passes, the heaven and the earth are annihilated, and the avenue does not exist!

In the blink of an eye, that sword slashed **** the barrier!

Kacha~!

A crisp sound!

Thousands of miles of mask shattered with one sword!

There is no stopping power!

The momentum of that sword reached 3.7 billion stars!

The defense of the plain-colored cloud border flag is naturally unstoppable!

"Wow~!"Exppl√¥re ùíñptodùíÇte stories at no/ùíóel//bin(.)cùíêm

"Pfft~!"

At the moment when the enchantment was broken, all the demons were backlashed, and they were shocked to spurt blood, and their momentum quickly wilted!

huh~!

But before they could breathe a sigh of relief, a white light flashed on the altar, and Ji Yang's body teleported to it!

Swish~!

Immediately after that, Ji Yang's body was swept away with a sword!

Kacha~! Kacha~! Kacha~!

Blood splashed again and again!

Terrible roar!

One after another!

Ji Yang's body slashed the thirteen demon gods into two halves with one sword, and even the demon king Feng Xi was no exception!

In front of him, all the demons have no resistance at all!

In the next second, all the demons cracked inch by inch, turned into starlight, and dissipated everywhere...

Ji Yang's body actually killed thirteen demon gods with one sword, and even his soul body was shattered with one sword. One of them was a demon king at the peak level of a **** king!

Such a terrifying attack, if the world were to know about it, would be absolutely shocking!

In short, the thirteen demon gods all died and disappeared!

What follows is a crazy harvest!

Ji Yang body let out a long sigh of relief and smiled!

huh~! huh~! huh~!

At this moment, thirteen white lights flew from all around, madly pouring into his body...

[You succeeded in killing the Demon King Feng Xi (the pinnacle of the God King), obtaining +46,000 trillion energy points, +160,000 gold judgment points]

[You killed the demon king Feng Xi (the peak of the **** king) and got 3 holy land points...]

[You successfully killed the demon king Feng Xi (the peak of the **** king), and a chaotic treasure chest (complete state) was exploded]

[You succeeded in killing the Demon King Feng Xi (the peak of the God King), and the Sword of Slaughtering the Heavens (fortune-telling level) exploded]

[You succeeded in killing the Demon King Feng Xi (the pinnacle of the God King), and a secret star map was released...]

[You successfully killed the demon **** Longbo (mid-stage **** king)...

...

The feedback from killing the demon gods is coming!

Soon, Ji Yang's main body absorbed the nurturing light, and the points reached 7337 points, which can be exchanged for 7 pieces of the pass of the true temple.

The cathode body has 2736 points, and can be exchanged for 2 pass orders.

Accumulated together, he can exchange for 9 pass orders, which just meets his needs.

Thinking of this, Ji Yang's body showed a satisfied smile!

At this moment, an upgraded white light lit up on him again...

„ÄêYour level is promoted to level 91„Äë

„ÄêYour strength index increases by 20,000 points! „Äë

„ÄêYour agility index increases by 20,000 points! „Äë

„ÄêYour BMI increases by 20,000 points! „Äë

[Your vocation is promoted to level 86 Hongmeng Supreme]

...

Levels and vocations have also been upgraded!

Ji Yang's body smiled and looked around, and all he saw was a treasure chest, a divine sword, a strange token...

It's time for him to clear the battlefield too!

Thinking of this, Ji Yang's body waved his hand and put away the spoils!

In just a moment, he packed up those treasure chests and fused all the ones that should be fused together!

In this way, he has a Taoist treasure chest and a complete chaos treasure chest in his hand!

The second Taoist treasure chest has been synthesized!

Now it's time to open the second avenue artifact again!

Ji Yang's body is very happy!

However, instead of opening the Dao-level treasure chest immediately, he looked at the Heaven-Slaughtering Sword in his hand!

The fourth mission sword is here!

Like the previous Divine Sword, the Heaven Killing Sword also had a cracked gap.

When the palm of Ji Yang's body turned over, there was a fragment of the divine sword in the palm, which was transformed by the Slaughtering Star Sword.

Om~!

As soon as the fragments appeared, the Divine Sword trembled!

In the next second, the fragments of the broken sword flew to the gap of the divine sword and merged into one!

It didn't take long for a complete Slaughtering Sword to appear, bursting with sword energy, filling the world...

Tiandao also came with a reminder...

[Task reminder: Congratulations on finding the complete Killing Heaven Sword! Slaughter Tianjian has taken the initiative to recognize you as the master! „Äë

[Slaying Heaven Sword: Fortune Grade, contains the Dao of Destruction, and can feed back 400 million stars in combat power]

[Congratulations on obtaining the mission reward of this stage: Awakening the Avenue of Destruction! „Äë

[Congratulations on comprehending the 1% Dao Rhyme of Dapo Avenue, your combat power +160 million stars]

[Congratulations on your awakening to the Dao of the Day After Tomorrow - Dao of Destruction! You have been blessed by the power of the avenue, and the combat power has increased by +220 million stars]

[Your chaotic space has successfully integrated the Dao of Destruction and has been greatly strengthened, and you will permanently receive 220 million stars of the power of heaven and earth]

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, the momentum of Jiyang's body began to skyrocket wildly...

But before those are over, there is a reminder from Tiandao...

[It is detected that you have awakened the 'Dao of Destruction', you have mastered four types of Dao of Killing, and your magical power 'Seven Killing Divine Body' is automatically advanced...]

„ÄêAdvanced success! Your Seven Kills Divine Physique has been promoted from 'Intermediate' to 'Advanced']

[Seven Killing Divine Physique (Advanced): Awaken the four killing avenues, you can activate it]

[When the state is turned on, the attack power skyrockets by 50%, and the maintenance time is 2 hours]

[Reminder: This state cannot be superimposed with a knowing strike]

[Reminder: After the Seven Kills Divine Physique is complete, it can be superimposed with the Cognition Strike]

[Reminder: The Fortune Jade Disc automatically records your perception of the 'Road to Destruction', and you have obtained a permanent feedback of 100 million star combat power]

Boom~Long~Long~!

The momentum of the anode body continues to soar!

After a long time, everything calmed down!

Ji Yang's body also slowly opened his eyes, and a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.

After this continuous harvest, he has mastered 62 avenues!

The basic combat power has also been increased to 136.9 billion stars in one fell swoop!

Of course, this is just the basic combat power!

If you count the sacrifice of equipment, luck, and combat power, it can reach about 185 billion!

For such a prompt, the anode body is extremely satisfied!

"."The four swords are finally in hand~"!"

At this moment, Ji Yang originally intended to observe the Heaven Killing Sword in his hand for a while, and then put it in the storage ring.

Then, he looked at a token in his hand!

That's the last loot...

[Star Map Secret Order: Quest Token, which is a follow-up quest item for the Quest of the Sword of Heaven Execution]
