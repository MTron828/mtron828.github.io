0.00 / 0.00

From the beginning to the end, they underestimated Qin Feng's strength, thinking that Qin Feng was just a prefecture-level powerhouse.

"By the way, why is there no news from Hei Lao?"

Another Taishang elder remembered this.

But at this moment, dozens of shrill screams were heard in the distance!

Everyone was shocked and looked at the sound, and suddenly found that the scream was coming from the headquarters, as if it was the direction of transmission.

"not good!"

"Someone invaded!"

The crowd exclaimed.

"Damn!"

Xuan Qiong scolded, his heart was extremely angry.

What the **** is going on this day?

First, the invaders broke into the Valley of Seven Kills from them.

Now someone is invading!

Thinking of this, he dodged and rushed towards the headquarters.

"Patriarch! I'll help you!"

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

The three Supreme Elders followed closely behind.

Below, thousands of Cang clan disciples were surging, and they also wanted to follow.

Xuan Qiong hurriedly stopped: "Don't fall for the trick of turning tigers away from mountains! You hold the exit, I will go check it out alone!"

Everyone was amazed!

right!

The offender this time is likely to be an accomplice of the Seven Killing Valley raider.

The purpose is to transfer them away so that the people in the valley can escape.

At this thought, everyone was certain in their hearts and hurriedly stayed where they were.

Xuan Qiong rushed towards the headquarters alone.

As he went all the way, he heard constant screams in the headquarters.

Today, most of the Cang Clan's troops are guarding the entrance to the Seven Kills Valley, and there are only a few hundred people left in the headquarters, as well as three prefecture-level powerhouses.

In just a moment, Xuan Qiong rushed to the teleportation array square.

There are corpses everywhere.

He was so angry that his eyes were blood red.

"Kill!"Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Kill them all! Don't let one go!"

At this moment, there was a scream of killing from the front.

He couldn't help but look up, and saw a group of top human-level powerhouses, chasing the Cang clan's children wantonly hacking and killing.

The teleportation formation not far away is constantly lit up with white light, and then a large army is coming out of the big formation.

This is no ordinary invasion!

Now the army is invading!

what!

Challenger! Challenger!

All challengers!

At this moment, Xuan Qiong saw the identity of everyone clearly, and was extremely shocked.

There are so many challengers out there, and all of them have peak human-level strength!

Does he have no dazzling eyes? !

You know, today is the first day of the end of the assessment period!

That challenge force is so terrifying!

At this moment, there was another mournful roar from the front!

Xuan Qiong hurriedly looked at it, just in time to see that Liu Xuan was controlling ten long swords and strangling a Cang clan disciple who was at the peak of human level!

"you wanna die!"

Xuan Qiong's eyes were blood red with anger.

That child is his direct descendant!

Boom~!

He slaughtered directly at Liu Xuan.

In the blink of an eye, he killed Liu Xuan.

The monstrous coercion of the pinnacle of the prefecture level instantly radiated out, covering Liu Xuan's whole body, pressing Liu Xuan to the point of immobility.

"not good!"

The disciples of Longyuan all around exclaimed!

Liu Xuan was even more frightened and pale!

Under the terrifying pressure, its sword formation instantly failed, and the long swords fell from the air...

Boom~!

At this moment, Xuan Qiong slapped it with a palm, and his eyes were full of hideousness.

He wanted to turn this human into scum to avenge his subordinates.

Boom~Long~Long!

Where the palm passed, the sky and the earth roared, the space collapsed, and the momentum destroyed the sky and the earth.

There was despair in Liu Xuan's eyes!

In the face of this palm, he absolutely couldn't resist.

But at this extremely critical moment, light and shadow flashed, and a figure instantly stopped in front of him.

The Mirage clone has arrived!

It turned out that before the Mirage clone chased and killed the three stationed local powerhouses.

This was the scene when I rushed back after killing him.

He instantly activated the law of speed and the law of wind, and rushed over at once.

Swish~!

Mirage clone shot!

A shocking dragon roar!

It resounds everywhere!

The shocking dragon blade slashed towards that palm!

The aura of a heavenly powerhouse exploded instantly!

Kacha~!

A crisp sound!

Blood soared!

That knife split the palm in an instant, and also split Xuan Qiong in half!

Terrible roar!

Echoing in the night sky!

At the same time, the entrance to the eighth floor of the Totem Temple.

When Qin Feng entered the eighth floor, he saw a white light flying from the void and pouring into his body.

At the same time, Tiandao also sent a reminder...

Immediately afterwards, Qin Feng's body lit up with an upgraded white light!

He opened his eyes with joy.

He escalated like that, and he didn't do anything.

It turned out that the benefits obtained from killing monsters and guardians in clones will be directly fed back to the main body, without any space and distance restrictions.

This is the power of the law of heaven!

Qin Feng was instantly overjoyed.

After a while, the attributes he obtained had reached 2437 points.

Because the phantom avatar not only killed Xuan Qiong, but also killed three prefecture-level powerhouses, as well as hundreds of Cang clan disciples.

Of course, this is just the beginning!

The clone will slaughter more.

However, Qin Feng ignored those.

He looks around...

But on the other side, on the battlefield.

After the Mirage clone killed Xuan Qiong with one knife, he picked up the land deed card on the ground.

"Boss! Thank you for saving your life!"

Liu Xuan looked grateful.

"keep fighting!"

The Mirage clone dropped these words and rushed towards the entrance of the Valley of Seven Kills...

At the same time, at the entrance of the Seven Kills Valley 0

The audience was shocked!

They heard the screams of the patriarch just now.

No way!

Patriarch killed?

Did they hear it right? !

huh~!

At this moment, a figure flew out from the headquarters and flew directly towards the entrance of Seven Killing Valley.

"Who is coming?!"
