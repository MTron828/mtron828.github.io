After all, the Turtle King he killed before was just a level 14 king-level beast.

How did the tree demon jump one level at this point?

Qin Feng was a little puzzled.

Looking at the characteristics of this tree demon, it is 'immortality', as well as 'manipulation' and 'aging'.

Something special!

Then, Qin Feng's eyes fell on the old dead wood demon again.

I saw that in that direction, more than a thousand ecstasy piranhas actually grew, forming a large sea of ​​colorful flowers.

Seeing this, Qin Feng was immediately excited.

More than a thousand ecstasy piranhas!

That represents more than one hundred green wood cores, and more than 800,000 points of energy.

After he kills these demon flowers, he should be able to rise to level 13.

However, Qin Feng did not act immediately.

He looked up again at the branches of the old dead wood demon, where there were three huge beehives hanging.

Each hive is more than thirty meters long.

The giant bees were two feet long, with yellow and white rings all over their bodies. They entered and exited from the hives, flying over the sea of ​​flowers, collecting the highly poisonous pollen.

With Qin Feng's amazing eyesight, he could clearly see that the tails of those giant bees all had a silvery poisonous needle.

These giant bees are actually level 15 insects, and their attack power is not weak.

Most importantly, there are too many of them.

There are at least a thousand giant bees in every hive.

What's more terrifying is that they are all poisonous.

If they are besieged by them, no matter how strong they are, there will inevitably be flaws in defense, and they will eventually be shot by them.

In today's novice stage, various medicine pill systems have not yet been opened.

What humans fear most is poisoning!

Once poisoned, there is no corresponding medicinal pill to detoxify, and you can only rely on your own body.

In this regard, even Qin Feng is no exception.

However, he did not hesitate.

After seeing the situation clearly, he strode towards the sea of ​​flowers.

When he was only a few hundred meters away from the sea of ​​flowers, the swarms of flowers and bees discovered his existence.

The old dead wood demon also sensed his arrival.

It's been so many years!

Another human has stepped into its restricted area!

The old dead wood demon is a little emotional!

It misses the taste of human blood.

It's a nice thing to have a human being automatically delivered to your door these days.

Then kill this human being and turn it into its nutrients.

Wow~ la~ la!

The demon tree seemed to be very excited, and without wind, it started to sway automatically.

The three beehives hanging on the branches seemed to have received orders.

One giant bee after another quickly flew out of the hive, forming three huge swarms, flying all over the sky.

Whoa~la~la!

Dryad swaying again!

Om~! Om~! hum!Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The three bee colonies immediately surrounded Qin Feng.

There are thousands of bees in each colony, covering a wide area.

The three swarms are more than 3,000 giant bees, covering a radius of several miles.

Wherever the bee colony passed, it was like three piles of dark clouds rolling in, covering the sky and the earth, and the momentum was amazing.

Qin Feng saw that his scalp was numb.

More than 3,000 venomous giant bees!

If he was surrounded by this, he would definitely get a few poisonous needles, or even hundreds of them.

The result is not good!

However, he had already made a plan in his heart to stand still, and he had no intention of running away.

Om~! Om~! Om~!

In the blink of an eye, the swarms of bees came, and they were only a thousand meters away from Qin Feng.

The earth-shattering sound of the wings was like rolling thunder, roaring constantly.

Those giant bees were aggressive, and their eyes were red with excitement, and they wanted to stab Qin Feng into many holes.

In the blink of an eye, the bee colony was approaching again, less than 100 meters away from Qin Feng.

It was at this moment that Qin Feng took action.

Boom~!

I saw him wave his hand, and suddenly, within a radius of ten miles, the situation changed, the world changed color.

In the next second, the dark clouds covered the sky, the cold wind roared, and countless ice arrows and snow blades fell from the sky and shot towards the bee colony.

Tier 4 talent skills - Ice Storm!

Launch it!

huh~! huh~! huh~!

Suddenly, the ice arrows penetrated one giant bee after another!

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~ Team!

Another piece of snow blade, slicing the giant bees into pieces!

puff~! puff~! puff~!

For a time, hundreds of giant bee corpses rolled down from the sky like raindrops.

For a time, hundreds of giant bee corpses rolled down from the sky like raindrops...

At this moment, Qin Feng's energy value is soaring, and the upgrade progress is soaring.

In the blink of an eye, he gained more than 100,000 energy points.

Ha ha!

So cool!

continue!

He's going to keep killing!

Qin Feng was very excited.

Hu~hu~hu~!

The cold wind howls!

Frostbolt and Snowblade!

Qin Feng continued to cast the ice storm and continued to kill the bee colony.

Kacha~! Kacha~! Kacha~!

puff~! puff~! puff~!

The corpses, stumps, and broken wings of countless poisonous bees fell from the air...

Even those piranhas were destroyed by the ice storm.

The petals smashed, the green leaves penetrated, the stalks were cut off, and it was all messed up...

In this way, Qin Feng's energy value soared all the way.

He was so relieved!

Within minutes, he had killed a thousand or so giant bees...

Tiandao also sent a reminder.
