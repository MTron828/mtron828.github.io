What's more, the reinforcements from the Azure Dragon Star Region will soon be able to come.

And the high-level above the **** king of the dark demon domain has been almost killed by Qin Feng with one move, and there is no resistance anymore...

Thinking of this, Qin Feng stepped out and disappeared in place.

In the next second, he appeared over a valley, the forbidden area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Dark Heaven Realm!

At this time, Qin Feng was hanging in the air, overlooking the forbidden area...

He saw at a glance that in the center of the forbidden area, there was a tree that reached the sky, reaching a height of hundreds of millions of feet, exuding a moon-like aura!

On it, there are small yellow flowers like stars, exuding a refreshing fragrance, which is extremely extraordinary!

As soon as Qin Feng's heart moved, he peeped towards the divine tree...

[The Laurel Tree: The peak level of fortune, the spiritual roots of heaven and earth, the master has been recognized]

[This thing contains the power of three avenues: the Avenue of the Moon, the Avenue of Xi, and the Avenue of Brightness]

This is actually a heaven and earth spirit root!

Qin Feng was quite surprised!

Of the three avenues contained in this spirit root, two of which he did not master, just swept over.

However, Qin Feng did not act immediately, but his eyes fell on the ground beside the laurel tree.

I saw that around the laurel tree, a lot of black crystals were born, exuding a faint spiritual light, and a strong power of extreme yin...

Qin Feng spy on those crystal mines...

[Lunar Star Essence: The pinnacle of creation, material! „Äë

Sure enough!

This is the lunar star essence material he wants!

huh~!

Qin Feng took a 227 step and teleported to the laurel tree...

He didn't take out the lunar star essence right away, but went straight to the laurel tree!

He wants to get the laurel tree into his universe!

After all, this is the spiritual root of heaven and earth, and it has a strengthening effect on his small universe!

Although this laurel tree has recognized the owner, Qin Feng has the magical power of 'spiritual root plundering', which can forcefully plunder the spiritual root...

As soon as he got close to the divine tree, he pressed his palm on the trunk!

Om~!

In the next second, a dazzling white light lit up in his palm, and the secret technique was successfully activated!

Boom~Long~Long~!

Suddenly, the laurel tree trembled violently and slowly rose from the ground...

Tiandao also sent a reminder at the same time...

[Successful plundering of spiritual roots! You have forced the 'laurel tree' to recognize you as the master]

[Congratulations, you have gained the insight of the 'Avenue of Xi' from the laurel tree, and you have begun to awaken the Dao of the Day After Tomorrow - the Dao of Xi...]

[Congratulations on getting the insight of the 'Bright Avenue' from the laurel tree, and starting to awaken the Dao of the Day Afterwards - the Avenue of Brightness...]

In just a moment, Qin Feng awakened two avenues and realized that the number of avenues reached 1814!

At this time, the laurel tree has broken out of the ground and is completely floating!

huh~!

As soon as Qin Feng waved his hand, the laurel tree turned into white light and was sent into Qin Yuan Universe.

The next second, there was a roar in the Qin Yuan universe, and the moon hanging tree had taken root in the Qin Yuan universe...

Qin Feng's momentum increased again, and after a while, it reached 18.94 trillion stars, and it has improved again!

But at this moment, in the depths of the forbidden area, there was a thunderous roar!

"Who?! Who took the old man's laurel tree!"

Boom~Long~Long~!

As that roar sounded, the sound of rapid air breaking came from the depths of the forbidden area!

In just a moment, an old man in gray robe arrived at the scene.

He is the guardian of the forbidden land, and the third powerhouse of the Dark Demon Realm!

As soon as the old man arrived, he saw Qin Feng and was immediately furious!

He thought that the intruder was a strong man, but he didn't expect it to be just a main **** realm!

This damned little thief in the main **** realm dared to **** his moon hanging tree, **** it!

Boom~!

Without saying a word, the old man slapped Qin Feng with one palm!

With a wave of Qin Feng's hand, a burst of energy swept out, directly blasting the old man on the spot!

Suddenly, the blood mist flew in the sky!

The mournful roar echoed in the valley!

In the next second, the broken true spirit fragments of the old man automatically condensed 13 Taiqing Dao Crystals!

This old man is also a quasi-half-step eternal powerhouse!

Qin Feng happily put away Daojing, took a short inventory, and found 4 available.

This adds up to the previous 6, that is, there are 10 that can be refined.

Qin Feng put away Daojing with satisfaction, devoured the luck in the field again, and got 9 times the luck value.

So far, his luck value has reached 1.11 million times!

There is no more obstructing force in the forbidden area, so he also mined the lunar star essence.

After a quarter of an hour, Qin Feng finished mining!

He dug out all those lunar stars, and once again made a lot of money

Chapter 104: Zixiao's aspirations! Star Plaza!

It didn't take long for Qin Feng to dig out all the Sun Stars!

At this point, the materials for refining the divine whip have been gathered.

He sent it directly into the small universe and let the mind body refine it

Subsequently, he continued to search for resources in the forbidden area

Time flies!

In a blink of an eye, another half day passed!

The remnants of the Bright God Realm were slaughtered.

Its resources have also been swept away!

The disciples of Long Yuan and Qinglong Xingyu all received a lot of money.

Later, Qin Feng gave the site of the Bright God Domain to the Azure Dragon Domain Master, which made the Qinglong Star Domain grateful.

The Azure Dragon Domain Master also feels more and more that he is with the right person

At this time, the sky above the light heaven.

The disciples of Long Yuan have gathered!

Yu Xuanji took a storage ring and came to Qin Feng happily.

"Master, I harvested seven star crystals this time! We can create a star field teleportation array!"

Qin Feng took a look at the storage ring and showed a satisfied smile.

Knew it!

Materials are ready!

Immediately, he opened the panel, entered the trading channel, traded the materials to the phantom avatar, and asked the avatar to create a star field teleportation array.ùëÖread latest chùíÇpters at n/ùíêv(e)lbiùíè(.)co/m

He just finished dealing with these trivial matters, and the Azure Dragon Domain Master also rushed over.

"Lord Qin Feng, the remnants of the Bright God Domain have been dealt with! What should we do next?"

Qin Feng smiled: "Next, let's rush to Judgment God Realm!"

Having said that, he looked at the starry sky in the distance.

With nine days to go, his "Book of the Three Worlds" mission will be three months away.

He has to speed up the time to get five times the quest reward!

"Sir, let's go!"

The Azure Dragon Domain Master couldn't wait to get up.

Along the way, he witnessed Qin Feng's strength, thinking that with such a backer, his inheritance assessment this time will definitely be rewarded.

"It's time to go!"

At the moment, Qin Feng waved his hand and took the 100,000 Longyuan children into the small universe.

Afterwards, he set off with the Azure Dragon Domain Master.

The territory of the Bright God Domain is left to some Qinglong Star Domain disciples to take care of.

It didn't take long for Qin Feng and the two to fly out of the old nest of the Bright God Realm.

Boom~Long~Long~!

Just after leaving the Bright God Realm, a reminder from Heavenly Dao came from the sea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãknowledge of everyone up and down Long Yuan.
