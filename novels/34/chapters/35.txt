[Successful killing the **** double-headed dog! The fragments of the dark seal burst out! „Äë

Bang~!

Qin Feng landed on his feet and stood firm.

Under the dual protection of the enhanced physique and the Bear King's armor, he was not injured.

Even the hellfire of the dogs failed to leave a scorch mark on his armor.

That is the flame resistance of the Bear King's armor +100%, which has played a role.

Bang~! Bang~!

The two hellhounds that had been kicked away fell heavily to the ground, sending up a cloud of dust.

This time, the dogs were dumbfounded!

Looking at Qin Feng in astonishment, none of them dared to go forward and kill them.

They did not expect that under such a siege, Qin Feng not only was not injured, but also killed one of them.

This human is so scary!

A gust of night wind blew, the placket fluttered, and the cloak fluttered.

Qin Feng is like a **** of war in the wind!

He sneered and killed the dogs.

Woo~! Woo~!

The dogs roared in alarm, and they collapsed with a bang, turning around and running away.

How could Qin Feng let go, and hurriedly chased away...

The fighting spirit of the dogs collapsed, and at this moment they were defeated like a mountain.

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

Ow~ Woo!

Ow~!

Suddenly, in the wilderness, the sound of breaking the air continued.

The screams of the hellhounds are one after another...

In a blink of an eye, Qin Feng killed three heads in a row.

Only four hellhounds were left desperately escaping.

At this moment, they fled near a towering old tree.

Only then did Qin Feng discover that behind the old tree, there was a novice village, which was protected by a huge protective mask.

It's just that in the village, the rows of novice wooden houses are all broken, revealing a strange atmosphere.

At the same time, when the four hellhounds saw the village, their eyes lit up with joy.

Then, one by one, they penetrated the mask and drilled into the village.

In a blink of an eye, only the last one remained, which had not yet passed through the mask.

Qin Feng quickly caught up and slashed with a long knife.

Kacha~!

Knife light flashed!

Blood splattered!

[Successful killing the **** double-headed dog! The fragments of the dark seal burst out! „Äë

Cool!

One more kill!

Get another 1000 energy points!

There are still 15 judgment points!

How cool!

[Successful killing the **** double-headed dog! Bronze treasure chest exploded! „Äë

Fuck it~!

exploded!

The treasure chest finally exploded!

Qin Feng was surprised.

But now it was a race against time, he didn't have time to pick up the treasure chest, and continued to chase and kill the other three hellhounds.

To him, the three hellhounds were a mobile resource library, how could he let them go.

Swah~!

In just a split second, he caught up to the protective mask and passed through it without hesitation...

Bang~!

A loud bang!

Qin Feng's body slammed heavily on the mask, causing the mask to deform slightly.

In the next second, he was bombarded by a huge rebound force.

Bang~!

A muffled sound!

Qin Feng fell to the ground heavily, and the ground trembled.

This unexpected block made him a little confused.

The three hellhounds who were escaping for their lives were also shocked by this sudden scene.

They turned around in panic and saw Qin Feng being ejected.

They suddenly looked surprised and breathed a sigh of relief.

Ha ha! !

This horrible human can't even get in.

They are finally safe.

Then, the three hellhounds turned around and fled to the depths of the village, and disappeared in a blink of an eye.

"Fuck~!"

Qin Feng recovered from the confusion and hurriedly sat up.

When I got up, I could no longer see the Cerberus.

Then, he looked at the mask in front of him again, feeling a little depressed.

This mask actually blocked his entry, but not the Cerberus, it was really weird!

Qin Feng stood up slowly, feeling puzzled in his heart.

It was at this moment that Tiandao's reminder sounded in his mind.

[Reminder: You have found a highly dangerous area - the lost village! „Äë

[Reminder: You need a dark seal to penetrate the protective mask and enter the lost village. „Äë

what!

Lost Village?

Qin Feng's eyes lit up and he was surprised.

It seems that he has found an amazing place!

This is just like when he discovered the mummified corpse before, the process is full of danger, but the harvest is great.

Often dangerous places are resource treasures.

The more Qin Feng thought about it, the more excited he became.V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

It's a pity that to enter this village, you need a dark seal, otherwise he will not be able to pass through the protective mask.

"Looks like I have to get the Dark Seal first..."

Qin Feng muttered in his heart.

never mind!

I don't want so much anymore.

Since he can't get in, he will deal with other things first.

Thinking of this, he looked at the dog corpse at his feet.

At this moment, a bronze treasure chest and a black seal fragment were floating on the dog's corpse.

As soon as he saw the treasure chest, he showed joy and hurried forward to pick it up...

This time, he killed six **** two-headed dogs in a row and got 6000 energy points.

Now his upgrade progress is level 6 (7960/8000), and he is only 40 energy points away from level 7.

He felt cool just thinking about it!

At this time, he picked up the treasure box again, and his mood was even happier.

At this moment, Tiandao sent a reminder.

[Announcement: 2 people in this novice village have reached level 5 or above, and the regional chat channel is automatically activated. „Äë

what!

It should be Liu Xuan who has risen to level 5.

Qin Feng looked at the sky, it was almost dawn.

Liu Xuan's upgrade was faster than expected.

It should be the benefit of doubling resources.

[Reminder: In the regional channel, those below level 5 cannot speak more than three times a day. Level 5 to 9, no more than ten times. Level 10 or above, no more than 30 times. „Äë

[Reminder: Every thousand novice villages are divided into one district, and No. 911 novice village belongs to District 1. „Äë

[Announcement: Starting to connect to Area 1, the regional chat channels are in parallel...]

Fuck it~!

There are a thousand novice villages in one district.

That's 1 million people!

This size is not small!

By the way, the regional chat channel is about to open, which must be very interesting.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng quickly opened the Tiandao light screen and entered the chat channel......

As soon as he entered the chat channel, Qin Feng found that it was very lively.
