Colorful Balloons Take Flight
0.00 / 0.00

Sound waves sweeping everywhere!

The void is bursting!

In the next second, Brahma roared miserably, and was stabbed by an axe to the point of vomiting blood and flew out!

Boom~!

Not far away, Ye Mo and the two were dumbfounded!

Oh my god~!

They thought that human being was already the best in the half-step Great Perfection!

I didn't expect this troll to be more terrifying!

I'm afraid its strength has reached the ceiling of half-step great perfection!

But it was said that after Brahma was smashed by an axe, he rolled and flew a million feet before he stabilized his body!

When he stabilized, his body was already cracked, blood was flowing, and the momentum of the whole person also plummeted!

Almost, he was smashed by the troll!

Oh my god~!

I haven't seen him for twenty minutes, how has this troll's strength improved a lot!

Thinking of this, Brahma suddenly raised his head and looked at Qin Feng in horror!

Up to now, there is no frenzied anger in his eyes, only boundless fear!

He was frightened!

You must know that this time, he used the device of the avenue to exert the strongest combat power!

huh~!

But without waiting for him to think, Qin Feng just teleported, killed him again, and slashed with an axe!

"Damn!"

Brahma roared in shock and had to raise his sword to resist!

This time, he was seriously injured, and his momentum has dropped a lot, how can he resist it!

Can not wait for the two attacks to collide again!

Mutation regeneration in the field!

"Sir! We are here to help you!"

With two shouts, the two demons came to help Qin Feng besiege Brahma together!

"No~~!"

Brahma's desperate roar suddenly sounded in the field!

He was not the opponent of this troll, let alone two half-step Eternal Demons!

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

In the next second, an earth-shattering bombardment sounded in the field!

And Brahma's shrill screams!

At this moment, Qin Feng actually united the two great demons to launch a brutal siege on Brahma!

After a while, Brahma was smashed to pieces by one person and two demons, and his soul body collapsed again!

Qin Feng felt extremely relieved!

This guy is about to miss out on the extra bonus of the second level!

When the blood mist dissipated, Ye Luo respectfully came to Qin Feng and bowed to him!

"The guardian leader of the early days - Ye Luo! Meet the adults!"

Ye Luo's tone was full of respect.

He has regarded Qin Feng as the same kind, and is a more advanced leader!

After Qin Feng took a deep breath, he glanced at him with a complicated look, then nodded slightly to show his respect.

Happy night!

Immediately, he asked curiously: "Sir, with your strength, you should appear in the level of the 'Special Star-Lord' assessment, why did you appear here?"

Hearing this, Qin Feng's heart moved, and a look of surprise flashed across his eyes.

He unexpectedly found a useful piece of information.

It turns out that in the assessment of the 'special star-lord', there is still a demon guard like him!

From this point of view, the special star-lord is not easy to enter!

The assessment above the 'special star-lord' is even more difficult.

At the moment, Qin Feng pondered for a while, then deliberately hoarse his voice.

"This deity is the guardian of the five levels! The task is to freely inspect the five levels for assessment! In addition, the deity has brought you a new task under the order of heaven!"

"New mission? My lord, what is the mission?"

Ye Luo asked curiously.

Qin Feng waved his hand. A screen of light appeared in front of him.

In the light curtain, there was a projection of the portrait of an old man, it was Abel from the Bright God Realm!

"Did you see it? This old man is the focus of Tiandao's care! Tiandao asked you to lead all the demons in this pass to prevent this old man from passing the assessment! If the task is completed, there will be rich rewards!"

Ye Luo's eyes lit up.

It would be too easy if the entire level of demons only dealt with one human being.

But then, he wondered again: "Sir, we are going to deal with this human being, what about other human beings?"

Qin Feng deliberately said hoarsely: "Other humans, let them come and go, you can leave it alone!"

Ye Luo was pleasantly surprised: "My lord! This subordinate understands! I'll notify all the demons in this pass!"

"Um!"

Qin Feng nodded with satisfaction.

At that moment, Ye Luo Er Mo bowed and left in a hurry.

Qin Feng also put away the portrait projection in the air.

Then, he looked at the back of the two demons leaving again, and a wicked smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

Next, Abel will be treated like never before!

He wants to pass the second level, dream!

I am afraid that Abel will not think of how miserable he will be!

Qin Feng smiled smugly, then turned around and rushed back towards Tai Shitian... Yi.

Chapter Nine hundred and seventy-one consecutive breakthroughs! Super devil!

At the same time, in the starting point square of Taichutian!

Brahma is resurrected!

At this moment, he stared blankly at the depths of the sea of ​​​​fog, and his eyes were a little confused!

He was killed again!

damn it!

How did he meet that troll again? !

The troll seemed to be trying to trouble him on purpose!

Now that's it, he won't get the extra reward for the second level again!

Brahma is extremely sad and angry in his heart, but there is nothing he can do!

After a long time, he recovered!

hey~! That's it! That's it!

If you can't get the extra reward of this level, then you can't get it!

He has to get through this quickly.

Thinking of this, Brahma walked into the thick fog with a gloomy expression, and opened the gate again.

Only this time, his expression was much more cautious, and he was still praying in his heart not to encounter that troll again.

He was really scared by that troll!

At the same time, on the other side.

Qin Feng has returned to Taishitian's starting point square.

Boom~Long~Long~!

As soon as he appeared, Tiandao sent a reminder

[Assessment reminder: It is detected that the contestant has obtained the 'Fourth-Class Star Lord'! The 'third-class Star-Lord' assessment is automatically activated, and the assessment rules are now announced...]

[Rule: The contestant enters Taishi's suffocating aura and keeps going westward. At the end of the foggy sea, there is the entrance door to 'Tai Sutian'! 】

[Rule: Players who break into ‘Tai Sutian’ within 5 hours, that is, pass the third round of assessment, can get the personal reward of ‘third-class Star Lord’! 】

[Reminder: From here to the entrance of 'Taisutian', it is about 17 trillion miles! 】

[Players who arrive at Taisutian within 30 minutes can get additional rewards! Arrive within 15 minutes and get double the bonus! 】

This level is 17 trillion miles, which is 4 trillion miles more than the second level!

This difficulty is layered upon layers, and it is getting harder and harder!

Qin Feng took a deep breath and walked to the edge of the square

Soon, he reached the border, and there was a black mist in front of him!

He couldn't help but peep out into the black fog

[Tai Shishawu: The evil mist containing the power of Taishi, one of the special evil mists on the boundary of the universe! 】Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

[Reminder: Taishisha fog has a certain suppressing effect on the strength of the players, but it has no effect on the players who master the ‘Taishi Dao’! 】

[Reminder: There are a large number of extraterrestrial demons hidden in this evil fog, and their strength ranges from the initial stage of the **** king to the half-step peak, and they are not suppressed by the Taishi evil fog! 】

[Reminder: There are three half-step peak-level demons hidden in this test area! 】

The weakest demons in this level are the early God Kings.

Half-step peak-level demons have reached 3!

The guardian power of the demons has increased a lot!

Qin Feng smiled slightly, then rushed into the sea of ​​​​fog and opened the third level of assessment

At this moment, the players are still going through the first test!

Even those quasi-half-step Eternal players are still in the first stage!

Only a few half-step eternal players have passed the first level!

Unconsciously, the performance gap between the players has opened up like this

In this way, the star master assessment has been in full swing.

Time flies!

In a blink of an eye, fourteen minutes passed!

This time, Qin Feng's breakthrough was extremely smooth!

He came all the way, all the demons retreated, no demon dared to stop him!

Finally, when he reached the finish line, he saw three half-step peak demons gathered together!
