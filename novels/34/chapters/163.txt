Majestic Desert Splendor

Everyone was shocked and turned to look.

Just thousands of meters away, a giant wolf weasel with a length of seven feet and a single silver horn was running frantically towards the village.

It is - the mad electric wolf weasel king!

Behind it, there are also six or seven hundred wolves, all as strong as calves.

In fact, wolves are very cunning.

Under the leadership of the wolf weasel king, they quietly touched the vicinity of the village.

Until the distance from the village was only a few thousand meters, the wolf weasel king gave an order, and the beasts swooped towards the village together.

They want to kill all the humans in front of them, eat them all, and avenge their dead kin

Boom~Long~Long!

Suddenly, the herd ran wild, and the earth trembled!

The dust was flying all over the sky, and the momentum was earth-shattering.

In the village, everyone panicked when they saw this scene.

"Oh my God! It's a pack of wolves!"

"And the wolf weasel king!"

"There are six or seven hundred! It's over! It's over! We're finished!"

"Elder! This... what should I do?"

"Don't panic, everyone! Get together! Fight the herd together!"

"Weapons! Everyone, grab your weapons!"

Boom~!

Just when the whole village panicked, Qin Feng suddenly released the wings of the wind, and then flew into the sky to meet the beasts.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

"Huh! That is?"

"My God! It's His Majesty the Emperor!"

"He... he can fly!"

In the blink of an eye, Qin Feng flew over the herd.

At this moment, there was joy in his eyes.

To the Qi clan, this herd is a nightmare, and it is destruction.

But for Qin Feng, this is a lot of energy value, and it is an opportunity to upgrade.

You know, the herd is not so easy to meet.

What's more, this is a herd of beasts above level 20.

At the same time, the wolf weasel king also discovered Qin Feng.

It looked shocked.

This man can fly!

But when it saw clearly that Qin Feng was only level 16, there was disdain in his eyes.

In this killing world, the level often determines the difference in strength.

A level 16 human is far from a level 24 king beast.

This arrogant human dared to fly above its head.

Then it will destroy this human being first!

roar~!

With a low roar, the silver horn on the wolf weasel king's head suddenly shot out a blue lightning, as thick as an arm, and slammed directly towards Qin Feng in the air.

"My God!"

In the distance, there was an exclamation from everyone!

That was a level 24 king beast, the strongest blow it could deliver!

They know that Qin Feng is a novice emperor, but they will also know that Qin Feng is only level 16.

Can a level 16 human resist the attack of a level 24 king beast?

Kacha~!

Lightning strikes!

Earthshaking!

The blue mad electricity, like an electric python dancing wildly in the air, slashed in front of Qin Feng at once.

Lightning strikes, as fast as the speed of light, are generally difficult to avoid.

At that moment, Qin Feng raised his hand and stopped the lightning.

Kacha~!

Lightning slammed into Qin Feng's hands.

In the distance, the exclamations of the crowd sounded again.

There was even more joy in the wolf weasel king's eyes.

This ignorant human dared to pick up its lightning directly with his hands.

Immediately, he would be blackened with electricity and fall out of the sky.

But the next second, the wolf weasel king was stunned.

I saw that after the lightning struck Qin Feng's palm, Yu Dian still strung around him a few times, and then disappeared.

No harm was done to Qin Chuan.

Even Qin Feng didn't even feel the numbness of being hit by lightning.

It turned out that he had mastered the C-level talent - lightning control, how could he be afraid of lightning strikes.

This time, the wolf weasel king was stunned.

The entire herd was stunned.

The thunder and lightning attacks of their kings are extremely powerful, and even their kin who can control thunder and lightning can't resist a single blow.

This human can resist it!

But without waiting for the beasts to think about it, Qin Feng picked up a seal and launched an ice storm.

Whoo~! Whoo~! Whoo~!

Suddenly, the sky and the earth changed color, and countless ice arrows and snow blades shot towards the herd...

At the same time, he activated the A-level talent Five Elements Profound Truth!

The five elements are intertwined!

The power of the ice storm suddenly increased fivefold, covering a range of more than ten miles.

For a time, the sky and the earth are connected by snow!

Frost arrows and snow blades are endless!

One ice arrow after another penetrated the wolf weasel's body.

One after another, snow blades cut through the body of the animal skin.

Bloody sky shoots!

The screams of the wolf weasel are one after another

One wolves corpse after another fell...

In just a moment, more than a hundred wolves were killed.

roar~! roar~! roar~!

The wolf weasel king was frightened and angry, roaring continuously.

The next second, it led the herd to counterattack.

Kacha~! Kacha~! Kacha~!

One after another lightning rushed into the sky and bombarded Qin Feng.

For a while, Qin Feng's body was intertwined with electricity and light, but he was unscathed.

This is the advantage of having many talents, and there is no weakness to attack.

The wolf weasel king was completely dumbfounded.

In such a short time, the wolf weasel group was killed by four or five hundred.

The wolf weasel king immediately realized the danger and turned around and fled.

When it escaped several kilometers away, all the wolves were killed, and only one wolf ferret was left.

Seeing that, the wolf weasel king fled far, and was about to get into the jungle and escape.

Qin Feng made a move, and there was an extra longbow in his hand, which was the Fengling Bow.

Then, he raised the bow and pulled the string, and a light arrow of cyan energy condensed out from his fingertips.

When the bowstring was fully drawn, his fingers loosened.

huh~!

The cyan light arrow shot out, under the blessing of the B-level wind element talent, it was as fast as lightning!

Its speed is dozens of times faster than ordinary arrows.

puff~!

A soft sound!

The arrow hit the back of the wolf weasel king's head, shot it in the opposite direction, and the blood shot out...

This scene made everyone in the distance look dumbfounded!

Chapter 146 Huge surprise! Suddenly!

This scene made everyone in the distance look dumbfounded!

Oh my God!

It's less than three minutes before and after.

His Majesty the Human Sovereign slaughtered the wolf weasel group and killed the wolf weasel king.

If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn't have believed it.

At the same time, above the sky.

Qin Feng put away the Fengling Bow, and checked the level progress by the way. It has reached 71.3% of level 16, and the reputation value has reached 128 points.

This is a very good progress!

He smiled contentedly, then slowly fell from the sky, came to the corpse of the wolf weasel king, and picked up the golden treasure chest.

So far, he has three gold treasure chests, five silver treasure chests, and two synthetic cards.

As long as he has time to close the silver treasure chest, he can turn into four golden treasure chests in no time.
