At the moment of the hit, a look of anticipation appeared in the pupils of the dual-phase god.

It is expecting Qin Feng to be bombed!

But in the next second, Qin Feng just groaned and was shocked back, and there was no sign of being bombed!

The bipolar **** was dumbfounded!

No way?

This kid actually easily blocked its attack!

At this moment, let alone the explosion, there is no sign of injury!

Naturally, the dual-phase **** doesn't know that the Pantian Dao Armor on Qin Feng's body is a device of the Dao.

What's more, he also mastered the Innate Great Dao - Immortality!

That is the avenue of immortality of the flesh, which makes his flesh defense extremely strong.

Qin Feng stabilized his figure only after being shaken back ten thousand feet away!

roar~!

Seeing this, the dual-phase **** was shocked and angry!

It was cut into two sections, and its momentum plummeted a lot.

no!

It has to be restored quickly!

Thinking of this, its body that was cut off in the middle actively gathered together and folded together.

huh~!

But at this moment, a white light flashed behind it, and Qin Feng appeared out of thin air!

Swish~!

Cold light flashes!

Another shocking axe, slashing down!

Ka~cha~!

Blood splashed again!

The two demon bodies that had just overlapped, before they could heal, were split by Qin Feng from top to bottom with an axe!

Suddenly, the corpse of the dual-phase **** changed from two to four!

Blood splattered in the sky!

Painful roars reverberated in the field!

Bang~! Bang~! Bang~!

Immediately afterwards, the corpses of the dual-phase gods all exploded, turning into a blood fog that gathered together.

In the blood fog, the two demon souls controlled the resurrection together, and their resurrection speed was extremely fast!

I saw the blood fog rolling, and in the blink of an eye, the image of a two-headed demon was gathered, and it was about to be resurrected.

Qin Feng's eyebrows suddenly opened, and the pupils of God's Punishment appeared.

huh~! huh~!

In the next breath, two rays of punishment from the sky shot out from his eyebrows, all of which penetrated the blood mist in front of him.

Bang~! Bang~!

After only two muffled sounds, there were two shrill roars from the blood fog!

The blood mist shape of the two-headed Demon Venerable that originally gathered suddenly collapsed.

But the demon soul in the blood fog is still alive, and Qin Feng will not let it go!

huh~! huh~! huh~!

The next second, he frantically blasted Dao light into the blood mist!

Poof~! Poof~!

After a while, there were two soft sounds in the blood mist!

The two soul bodies of the dual-phase gods were all defeated!

The mournful roar resounded again, with endless resentment!

At this moment, a dazzling golden light flew out of the blood mist and poured into Qin Feng's body.

At this moment, Qin Feng's body lit up with an upgraded white light!

The vocation has been upgraded again!

It's not far from full!

Qin Feng quickly glanced at the time!

It took 9 seconds!

He was instantly ecstatic!

Ha ha!

9 seconds! Exactly within 10 seconds!

He finally got the highest quest reward.

It seems his tactics are correct.

Relying on the terrifying defensive power, he adopts the style of perishing together to destroy the bipolar **** in 9 seconds!

Otherwise, he will spend more time, and it is impossible to solve the battle in 10 seconds.

The more Qin Feng thinks about it, the happier he is!

At this moment, the blood mist in front dissipated!

Revealed 5 Chaos Treasure Chests (complete state), half a group of Hongmeng Purple Qi, as well as a gray light group and a black light group

These are his trophies!

As soon as Qin Feng waved his hand, he put away the five chaotic treasure chests.

So far, there are 9 Chaos Treasure Chests in his hand, and there is only one left to synthesize a Tao-level Treasure Chest.

Afterwards, he inhaled the half of the primordial purple energy into his hands.

Half a group of Hongmeng purple energy!

He finally got it!FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm

Qin Feng flipped the palm of his hand, and another half of Hongmeng purple air emerged from the palm of his hand!

Om~! Om~!

The two and a half groups of Hongmeng purple energy appeared, and they were all enlightened!

Then the two half-clumps of purple qi were automatically fused together and turned into a complete clump of purple qi!

Hongmeng Purple Qi is complete!

It can finally be refined!

Qin Feng smiled slightly, and sent the group of Hongmeng Purple Qi into the center of the universe, allowing the mind body to refine it.

After doing this, he looked at the two light groups in front of him.

[True Spirit (Luxury than Corpse): Dao-level, severely incomplete]

[Reminder: To fuse with Dao blood, you can turn it into a spiritual egg and gain a chance of rebirth. „Äë

[True Spirit (Candle Jiuyin): Dao-level, severely incomplete. „Äë

[Reminder: To fuse with Dao blood, you can turn it into a spiritual egg and gain a chance of rebirth. „Äë

"Sure enough!"

Qin Feng was stunned!

Immediately, his eyes lit up again.

According to the prompt, it seems that he can get two more pets.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng quickly broke the blood of his fingers, and bounced a drop to the two groups of true spirits.

Poof~! Poof~!

Two drops of blood essence fell on the real aura, and they were immediately absorbed at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Boom~Long~Long~!

In the next second, the two groups of true spirits released endless suction and began to swallow the blood mist that strayed between the heavens and the earth.

In just a moment, they swallowed the blood mist and turned them into two battle pet eggs.

A whole body gray! A whole body black!

They are all three feet in size, covered with Dao Divine Marks, and exudes an extraordinary breath!

Qin Feng quickly snooped away

[Luxury corpse egg: Chaos level, has automatically recognized 'Qin Feng' as the main]

[Zhu Jiuyin Spirit Egg: Chaos level, has automatically recognized 'Qin Feng' as the main body]

Qin Feng is full of surprises!

He got two more powerful pets.

Having said that, the true spirits of Shebi Zhe and Zhu Jiuyin are both Dao-level, but in the end they turned into Chaos-level pets.

It must be the reason for the damage to the true spirit.

If it is a complete true spirit, it will definitely turn into a Dao-level spirit egg.

Dao-level Spirit Eggs are one level higher than Chaos Spirit Eggs!

However, Qin Feng was already satisfied.

At the moment, with a wave of his hand, he put away the two spirit eggs.

After doing this, he found that there was a lot of luck floating around the void, which was obviously the remnant of the dual-phase god.

Qin Feng hurriedly picked up the seal formula and launched the devouring of luck.

After a while, he gained another 10,000 times the luck value, and his luck value increased to 220,000 times!

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, the void shook!

Heaven sent a reminder
