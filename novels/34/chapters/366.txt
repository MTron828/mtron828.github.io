Suddenly, the sword light flashed, murderous aura!

Kacha~! Kacha~! Kacha~!

Blood splashed again and again!

Screaming one after another!

In just a few seconds, Qin Feng even killed seventeen prefecture-level powerhouses!

[Kill the guardian (prefecture level) successfully, you get +376 attribute points...]

[Kill the guardian (prefecture level) successfully, you get +341 attribute points...]

[Successfully killed the guardian (earth level), you get +387 attribute points...]

¬†‚Ä¶

Boom~!

The remaining prefecture-level powerhouses collapsed and fled in all directions!

Facing such a terrifying killer!

Dozens of them actually collapsed in their fighting spirit and fled for their lives...

At the same moment, the four avatars also arrived!

I saw that they held a seal and launched the doomsday natural disaster at the same time!

Boom~Long~Long!

Suddenly, the world changes color!Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

The four avatars joined forces to launch the four-layer doomsday natural disaster, the power is extremely terrifying!

I saw tens of thousands of miles around, countless thunder, wind, fire, earth, water, crazy riots...

Then, the earth cracked and the volcano erupted!

Countless magma spurted out, instantly engulfing a large swathe of the sect disciples.

There are also countless wild thunders, flames, meteorites, wind blades, ice arrows, and fireballs, falling from the sky and smashing madly at the children of the Qi clan.

Suddenly, in the sky and the ground, there are endless attacks, all killing the children of the sect!

Everything is like the end of the world, and the world is falling apart!

huh~! huh~! huh~!

Bang~! Bang~! Bang~!

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

Under the natural disaster, the children of the Qi clan fell one by one

That battlefield, instantly became a purgatory on earth, blood flowed into rivers, and corpses were scattered everywhere...

Boom~!

"Escape!"

"Everyone run away!"

"Save me! My legs are short! Save me!"

Suddenly, the will of the clan army collapsed and fled in all directions!

There were screams everywhere in the field, and there were sorrows everywhere!

[Kill the guardian (human level) successfully, you will get +140,000 energy value, +3 points.]

[Kill the guardian (human level) successfully, you will get +90,000 energy value, +2 points.]

[Kill the guardian (human level) successfully, you will get +150,000 energy value, +4 points.]

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

In just a moment, the four avatars joined forces to cast the fourth natural disaster, killing more than 7,000 people, and the injured were countless...

At the same time, Qin Feng chased and killed those prefecture-level powerhouses in the air, and killed twelve people in a row...

"Kill!"

"Rush! Everyone, rush!"

"Kill! Kill all the children of the Que clan!"

At this very moment,

"Kill!"

At the same moment, not far away, there was an earth-shattering cry of killing!

Qiyue led Longyuan's army to also kill!

It turned out that when Qin Feng was about to reach the end, he first released Long Yuan's army.

He and the four clones killed them first, followed by the Long Yuan army.

At this moment, the Long Yuan army finally arrived!

For a time, the screams of killing were earth-shattering, causing the entire valley to shake!

"My God! So many people!"

"Quick! Run to the headquarters!"

"Don't! Don't step on me!"

"Save me! Save me!"

The clan army has long since collapsed!

At this moment, when they saw Long Yuan's army attacking, their fighting spirit instantly collapsed and nothing was left!

There was even a stampede in the field!

In just a moment, the army of Long Yuan was killed!

They suddenly swarmed into the flock like a flock of tigers, slaughtering the disciples of the feudal clan, screaming again and again!

That scene was like chopping melons and vegetables, it was a one-sided slaughter...

At the same time, Qin Feng and the four avatars kept shooting.

Under their attack, the human-level disciples of the Qi clan fell in pieces...

Those earth-level powerhouses were also chopped down and rolled down one by one in the air.

Qin Feng can teleport, and has a terrifying speed.

Those Earth-level powerhouses couldn't escape his grasp at all, and only had to be beheaded...

And just like that, under this mad slaughter!

Qin Feng's attribute points, energy points, and points are soaring wildly all the way...

This is a feast of harvest!

After a full quarter of an hour, this feast of harvest is over!

More than 27,000 people from the Qi clan were all beheaded, and no one escaped.

Only more than 300 people in Long Yuan's army were injured, and no one fell!

Another great battle!

So far, the clan has been wiped out!

Long Yuan occupied the Qi clan's territory.

At this moment, Qin Feng's body lit up with two upgraded white lights!

One is his.

The other is Xiao Luan's.

He rose to level 28, and Xiao Luan'er rose to level 20.

"Hoo~! I've finally killed them all!"

In the air, Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief.

After taking down the Gothic clan, one more worry has been removed!

The guardian force is the natural enemy of life and death that challenges the force!

Destroying a guardian force will benefit Longyuan Town without any harm.

What's more, destroying the Qi clan would save him a lot of trouble.

Speaking of which, after this battle, he actually gained more than 20,000 attributes.

Of course, the real gains don't end there.

The Longyuan army is clearing the battlefield.

Many townspeople got a lot of attribute points in the war, but they haven't added them yet.

When these townspeople have finished adding points, there should be some players with a combat power that exceeds 200 stars, and then they can bring a lot of attribute feedback to Qin Feng.

In addition, the four clones are also cleaning up the battlefield.

They will also get some attributes when they extract the corpses of the powerhouses.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng fell from the sky.

As soon as he landed, he released the psychic fusion.

Guji~! Guji~!

"Dad, is the battle over?"

As soon as the little guy appeared, he saw the corpses in the audience and hurriedly asked.

"Well, it's over!"

Guji~! Guji~!

"Hey! Dad, I'm level 20! I can go to retreat and change shape."

At this time, Xiao Luan'er discovered her level change again and called out excitedly.

Qin Feng's eyes lit up.

He had long expected that Xiao Luan'er would be transformed as soon as possible.

It is rumored that after the spirit beast transforms, there will be a lot of transformation and progress in terms of potential and talent.

That is to say, after the little guy completes the transformation, he will become stronger.

In fact, after this battle, the basic combat power of the little guy has been raised to 2160 stars, which is a great improvement.

If the transformation is completed again, the strength of the little guy will be greatly improved.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng said: "Little guy, then go back to the zero-degree space to retreat!"

Guji~! Guji~!

Xiao Luan'er happily agreed.

Qin Feng waved his hand and took Xiao Luan'er into the zero-degree space.

At this moment, the first light of dawn lit up from the sky.

Tiandao also sent a reminder.

[Announcement to the whole world: A new dawn has come again! The 24-hour protection period has expired. From now on, challengers and refugees are allowed to kill each other, but without any benefit. „Äë

As soon as the news came out, the whole world was shocked!

At this moment, Qin Feng raised his head and looked at the dawn of the sky, with joy in his eyes.

Dawn has come!

The Vientiane Temple on Tongtian Lake will also come!

He can go to the Holy Martial Examination
