At this moment, Ji Yang's body is standing at the entrance of the secret realm, and he does not dare to go around.

He had just been killed, and one point was deducted. The situation was very bad, and he was anxious to return to the secret realm to score.

At this moment, in the square not far away, there was another burst of laughter.

"Look! That white-haired boy is dead again!"

"Hey! Really! This time, it's less than 5 minutes!"

"Let's just say it! He is breaking the pot! He is obviously not strong enough, but it is unreasonable to have to run into the secret realm of the true **** realm!"

Hearing these mocking voices, Zong Sheng was slightly taken aback.

These words are obviously mocking the body of Jiyang!

Zong Sheng couldn't help but turn his head to look, and saw several main **** realm players, looking at Ji Yang's body playfully, his eyes were full of ridicule.

Zong Sheng swallowed his saliva, his expression a little complicated.

At this moment, he inexplicably felt that the few main **** realm players seemed to be as stupid and arrogant as him!

Don't look at this white-haired young man who is in the virtual **** realm, but his strength is close to that of a quasi-god king!

If it's not good, those main gods will suffer as much as themselves!

Thinking of this, Zong Sheng suddenly had some expectations, and the few main **** realm players also fell into the pit like himself.

huh~!

At this moment, another white light lit up at the entrance of the Secret Realm of Devouring Avenue in the True God Area.

In the next second, the very negative body also appeared!

At this moment, the eyes of the extreme yin body were full of joy.

This time, in the secret realm, he made a lot of money again.

In addition to getting 40 Dao crystal fragments, I also got a lot of god-level resources,

Among them, the ghost water of the high-grade gods got 31 drops.

This makes him very satisfied!

But at this moment, some jokes sounded in the square.

"Yo! That black-haired boy has also been eliminated!"

"Sure enough, they are brothers! The time of death is almost the same!"

This time, it's obviously mocking the very yin body!

The tone was full of schadenfreude.

As soon as I heard this voice, I knew that it was the other main **** realm players.

Mane Sheng also glanced at the extreme yin body curiously.

He vaguely felt that this young man seemed to be as strong as the white-haired young man, and I was afraid that he was infinitely close to the quasi-god king.

These two brothers are not easy to mess with!

Zong Sheng didn't know until now that the person who killed him before was just a fission variant of Ji Yang's body.

With the comprehensive strength of Jiyang's body, it is comparable to the middle stage of the **** king, far from being comparable to the quasi **** king, let alone close to the quasi **** king.

In fact, the two main bodies also heard those ridicules.

At this moment, Ji Yang's body aimed at the crowd and silently remembered those players in the main **** realm.

He's not such a good talker!

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, in front of the square, there was a sudden and violent tremor.

Everyone was alarmed, and they turned their heads to look, and saw that there were nine more divine monuments, breaking out of the ground!

Immediately afterwards, one after another door of light appeared next to the God Monument!

Lines of golden divine inscriptions also light up on the stele...

[The secret realm of the avenue of wood, contains Dao crystal fragments (wood), players below the main **** realm can enter]

[The secret realm of the Dao of the Underworld, contains Dao crystal fragments (underworld), players below the main **** realm can enter]

The secret realm of the main **** realm has also been opened!

All the commotion!

The players in the main **** realm are all excited!

[The nine secret realms of the main **** realm have been opened, players below the main **** realm are invited to enter the secret realm]

[Reminder: After five minutes, the entrance to the nine secret realms of the king's realm will be opened]

[King realm: a secret realm that both quasi-god kings and **** kings can enter, with more abundant resources]

Hearing this prompt, both the polar yang body and the polar yin body lit up.

It turned out that after the end of the main **** realm, the king realm was opened.

Qin Feng knew very well that Wangjing was the place he finally chose.

There is the place with the most abundant resources, and there may be something special.

And the king's realm is about to open in five minutes. It seems that he has to hurry up.

Thinking of this, Ji Yang's body went to the secret realm of the 'Avenue of Power' in the main **** area...

The extremely yin body walked towards the secret realm of Devouring Avenue...

In a blink of an eye, the two main bodies took the lead and entered the secret realm.

The audience was stunned again!

"Hey! Why did those two boys enter the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe main **** realm again?"

"Haha! Those two boys are really crazy!"

"It's really disgusting! If the deity wants to meet them in the secret territory, he will definitely kill them!"

"The old man also thinks this way!"

Many main **** realm players, as if feeling humiliated, actually said that they wanted to kill the extreme yang body and the extreme yin body!

In their opinion, False God realm players are not worthy of sharing the same secret realm with them.

Hearing those people's words, Zong Sheng's face showed a strange color.

He swallowed a bit, thinking to himself who didn't know who killed whom!

In the next second, the thousands of main **** players rushed to the secret realm...

Mane Sheng also turned around and entered the secret realm, disappearing at the entrance...

Chapter 804 Vengeance must be avenged! Harvest luck!

It didn't take long for thousands of main **** realm players to enter the secret realm.

In the entire square, there were only more than a hundred quasi-god kings and nine god-kings left.

The field has become empty!

The atmosphere was also much quieter.

There were only a few quasi-god kings muttering somewhere.

"Those two False God realm boys can really toss!"

"Just two jumping clowns!"

The voices of several quasi-god kings revealed dissatisfaction!

Two False God realm players, scurrying around in the secret realm of high realm, is equivalent to robbing high realm players for resources.

After all, within the secret realm, resources are limited!

The dissatisfaction of the players with the two main bodies stems from the selfishness of human nature.

Who would be willing to have one more person to divide their interests?

The weak should have the consciousness of the weak!

At the same time, on the other side, the two main bodies are already frantically harvesting resources!

At this time, the main **** area, the secret territory of the avenue of power.

A polar yang fission body is shuttled over a jungle.

At this moment, his eyes were full of excitement.

The resources in this main **** realm area are indeed more than those in the true **** realm.

As soon as Ji Yang's body came in, he found dozens of resource points, of which there were seven or eight places that reached the high-grade **** rank, which was obviously twice as many as the true **** zone.

As for the number of guardian beasts in the secret realm, it has actually decreased.N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

However, the guardian beast is stronger, the explosion rate is higher, and the efficiency of obtaining Dao crystal fragments is higher.

In these three minutes, Jiyang's main body has harvested 31 Dao crystal fragments, which is much faster than that of the True God area.

Compared with various resources, Qin Feng is more concerned about the acquisition of Dao crystal fragments.

This chance!

The most precious is the Dao crystal fragments, each of which is equivalent to the same high-grade god-level treasure!

What's more, the more Dao Crystal fragments obtained, the higher the points, which has a great impact on the follow-up chances!

Before long, he reached the top of a valley and saw his target.

It was a monster with a length of 100 meters, a dark body, and a tauren body.

[Evil Object]: Powerful Bull Demon King

[Boundary]: The limit of the Lord God

[Explosion Rate]: After killing, there is a 23% chance of exploding Dao Crystal Shards (Power)

[Characteristics]: The guardian beast of the secret realm, mastering the rhythm of power

23% explosion rate!

very good!

The fission body smiled with satisfaction!

This guardian beast of the main **** area, the realm ranges from the initial stage of the main **** to the limit of the main god.

For many players in the early stage of the main god, this secret realm is full of dangers!

If they encounter guardian beasts from the middle stage of the main god, they only have the chance to escape. When they encounter the limit of the main god, they don't even have the chance to escape.

But to Qin Feng, guardian beasts of these levels are not worth mentioning at all.

This opportunity is too favorable for him!

This is simply a paradise for Qin Feng!

He can easily scrape a lot of resources!

Thinking of this, the fission body flashed light, and there was an extra giant axe.

At this moment, a gust of breeze blew past, bringing with it a sullen aura, which was emanating from the Demon King Dali Bull below.

It was at this moment that the Bull Demon King, who was taking a nap, seemed to sense something and opened his eyes slightly.

As soon as it opened, it saw the fission body and was shocked!

Swish~!

Cold light flashes!

Heavenly Axe Light! Cross the sky!

Kacha~!
