Qin Feng nodded slightly.

He also felt that it was more appropriate to arrange the Qi family here.

"Since you have made a decision, then I will build your novice wooden house here. You arrange for the clan to clean up this place, and the original house will be demolished."

Qishan was overjoyed: "Master, this old man will do it now!"

At the moment, Qishan called on the whole family to start cleaning up the village.

When the clansmen heard that Qin Feng was going to give them permission to open a novice cabin, they were immediately excited.

After some exploration just now, they already knew the functions and permissions of the novice wooden house, and they had long been eager for it.

At the moment, there is no need to urge Qishan, and everyone actively cleans up the village.

After a quarter of an hour, the site was clean and all the old houses were demolished and removed.

There was a lot of empty space on the spot.

At the moment, Qin Feng opened the operation interface of the village chief and opened the log house permission for new villagers such as Qishan.

With this opening, the laws of heaven flow.

Boom~Long~Long!

Then, the earth shook.

One after another novice cabins rose from the ground.

In just a moment, all the wooden houses were built. A total of 273 grade 0 wooden houses were neatly formed and formed a large circle. Only the entrance of the village was left with a passage of several feet wide.

As soon as these wooden houses were built, Heavenly Dao sent a reminder.

[Longyuan Village Announcement: Village Chief Qin Feng has established a village branch point in the east of Sangqi Forest, and named it 'Shangqi Village'. „Äë

As soon as the news came out, the crowd cheered.

This means that they have initially integrated into Longyuan Village and become part of the master's forces.

However, it didn't end there.

Qin Feng opened the resource channel again and checked it out.

Looking at it, he was pleasantly surprised to find that only a quarter of an hour had passed, and there were 4 units of fine wood in the resource pool.

Just two teleportation arrays can be built.

He quickly exchanged the fine wood and began to build the teleportation array.

A moment later, the headquarters of Longyuan Village, which was hundreds of miles away, suddenly shook the mountain, and the entire village shook violently.

Some villagers residing in the village were shocked.

They also sensed that the source of the earthquake came from the square at the head of the village.

At the moment, they hurriedly ran to the square to check.

As soon as they arrived at the square, they saw a formation altar with a width of five feet, slowly rising from the ground, exuding faint spiritual power fluctuations.

The villagers were terrified and did not know what happened.

At this moment, Tiandao sent a reminder.

[Longyuan Village Announcement: The village chief Qin Feng successfully built the 'Teleportation Array (Elementary)', and the address is located in the headquarters of Longyuan Village. „Äë

The villagers were amazed!F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

It turned out that the altar in front was the legendary teleportation formation!

When did the boss master the authority to build a teleportation array?

Just when everyone was surprised, something happened in the village of Sangqi, which was hundreds of miles away.

At this moment, in the center of the village, the earth began to vibrate.

After a while, a teleportation formation slowly rose from the ground.

[Announcement from Longyuan Village: The village chief Qin Feng successfully built the 'Teleportation Array (Elementary)', and the address is located in the village of Sangqi. „Äë

[Reminder: Every time you use the teleportation array, you need to consume 1 energy stone. „Äë

As soon as the news came out, there was a cheer in the village of Sangqi.

This means that they have truly integrated into Longyuan Village.

Because there are two teleportation arrays connected, Longyuan Village and Sangqi Village can communicate with each other at any time.

"Hoo~! It's finally done!"

Qin Feng also breathed a sigh of relief and felt satisfied.

He connected the headquarters of Longyuan Village and the Sangqi Village, which is equivalent to extending his power to the Sangqi Forest.

According to this progress, it won't be long before the entire wounded Qi Forest will be included in the sphere of influence of Longyuan Village.

This feeling of constant expansion of power gave him an alternative sense of gain.

At this moment, Tiandao sent a reminder again.

[Reminder: The village chief builds the corresponding public buildings and can obtain the corresponding Heavenly Dao rewards]

[Reminder: You have successfully built the first 'Teleportation Array' in Longyuan Village, congratulations on being blessed by the Tao of Heaven and getting 200 attribute rewards. „Äë

[Reminder: You have successfully built the second 'Teleportation Array' in Longyuan Village, congratulations on being blessed by the Tao of Heaven and getting 200 attribute rewards. „Äë

Qin Feng was taken aback.

Is this possible? !

Immediately, he was ecstatic.

There are so many benefits to being a village chief!

There are rewards for building public buildings.

Just then, the sky started shaking.

Two beams of light fell on Qin Feng one after another.

Boom~Long~Long!

In just a moment, his attribute 3.1 points skyrocketed twice, a total of 400 points.

How cool!

Qin Feng was a little unfinished.

By the way, since he builds a teleportation array and can get rewards from Heaven, then he can build a few more!

Only when this thought came up, a reminder came from Tiandao.

[Reminder: Level 1 villages can only build two teleportation arrays. If you need to increase the number of teleportation arrays, you need to increase the village level. „Äë

Qin Feng felt regretful.

It seems that he has to complete the village upgrade first.

However, he is very satisfied with the current harvest.

Having said that, things are almost done here.

It's time for him to go to the Temple of Vientiane

Chapter 149: Time Talent

Thinking of this, Qin Feng wanted to leave early.

He wanted to get to the Vientiane Temple as soon as possible, not to solve the population problem, nor for the Shengwu assessment.

He wanted to find a way to enter other Dragon Country Novice Villages earlier.

It is now the fourth day of the novice assessment, and there is not much time left for the newcomers.

There are also many compatriots in the Dragon Country Novice Village, whose level is only level 5, and even a few are only level 4.

This kind of progress is basically waiting for death.

He can't die without help!

The sooner you pull these compatriots into Longyuan Village, the more hope you have to save them.

If it is another day or two at night, even if Longyuan Village has abundant resources, it may not be able to save them.

Of course, Qin Feng also has his own considerations.

Increasing the population is only good for him, not bad.

But if he wants to recruit subordinates, he will definitely recruit compatriots from the Dragon Kingdom, and he will never recruit Western white-skinned pigs, nor will he recruit Asan, Sakurajima, and Nanbang.

However, of the thousand novice villages in the No. 1 area, the Dragon Country villages accounted for very little, only seventeen villages.

If he doesn't cherish it, he will let those compatriots fend for themselves.

When the novice period is over, I am afraid that there are not many living people to recruit.

Of course, he can also go to other areas to recruit compatriots.

But this world map is too big, and it takes a lot of time to recruit across regions, which is not conducive to the early development of Longyuan Village, nor is it conducive to the improvement of his personal strength in the early stage.

Under various considerations, he decided to speed up the recruitment of compatriots.

Thinking of this, he bid farewell to Qishan and others.

When 07 knew that Qin Feng was leaving, Qishan and others came to see him off.

"Master, did you go to the Vientiane Temple to participate in the Shengwu assessment?"

Qishan asked with concern.

Qin Feng nodded slightly: "I have this intention! By the way, do you know anything about the Shengwu assessment?"

"Master, about the Shengwu assessment, the little old man does know some information. It was passed down by word of mouth from the ancestors. I don't know if it is accurate or not."

Qin Feng's eyes lit up: "Come and listen!"

Qishan hurriedly said: "Master, the ancestors of our clan once said that the grades of Shengwu assessment are roughly divided into five grades, namely: low grade, middle grade, high grade, excellent grade, and divine grade."

"If you get an evaluation of that level, you can get that level of foundation building. In fact, 99.9% of people get low-level foundation building."

Hearing this, Qin Feng nodded slightly.

Thinking about that Flood Dragon Corpse Puppet, no matter what, it has the blood of the dragon, and it is a second-class dragon, but it is only a low-grade foundation.

Qishan continued: "As for the mid-level foundation builders, only 0.1% of them can achieve it, that is, one in a thousand."

As soon as these words fell, everyone was amazed.

Oh my God!

It is so difficult to build a middle grade foundation!

It was the first time they heard about it, and they couldn't help but be amazed.

"What about high-grade foundation building?" Qin Feng asked curiously.

This matter is related to his vital interests, and he is naturally very concerned.

"Top-grade foundation building! That's one in 100,000,000."

Having said this, Qishan was also full of emotion.

The people around were even more embarrassed.

Qin Feng's heart moved.

He knew that Qishan said 1/100,000,000, and that was only for the Middle Thousand World. Converted to the Small Thousand World, it was 1/1000,000.00.

Qishan continued: "At that time, 1 billion people from my Qixing Realm came to this place, and there were less than ten people who reached the top-grade foundation. Among them, several of them were awarded the title of Novice Human Sovereign during the novice assessment period. You can get a top-grade foundation."

As soon as these words came out, everyone's color changed slightly.

Qi Yue was even more worried: "Grandpa, do you mean that it is more difficult to obtain a high-grade foundation than to obtain a novice emperor?"

Qishan smiled bitterly: "That's true! However, before the novice assessment is over, the master has already obtained the title of novice emperor, and his strength is definitely stronger than that of ordinary novice emperors. It should not be difficult to obtain a high-grade foundation."

As soon as these words fell, everyone nodded slightly.
