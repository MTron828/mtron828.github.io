Having said that, only the land where the title deed card is generated is qualified to build the guardian altar.

Qin Feng has already created the guardian altar at the Cang Clan Headquarters and the Qi Clan Headquarters, and has received a total of 1,000 attribute rewards.

Only the Blue Wind Department stronghold, he hadn't set up the guardian altar yet, because the time was really short, and he didn't have time to go there.

In short, Longyuan Town can build strongholds to guard the altar, namely: Longyuan Headquarters, Tayue Town, Cang Clan Headquarters, Qi Clan Headquarters, Cangtu Ministry, and Blue Wind Ministry.

Near these strongholds, there are abundant strategic resources, and the strategic position is very important.

As for the rest of the stronghold, it can only be regarded as an extension of the power, and its importance is one level lower.

"Master, shall we go to the Vientiane Temple now?"

Qi Yue asked excitedly.

At this moment, her mood was a little impatient and a little uneasy.

Qin Feng looked at her.

The little girl has a huge harvest this time!

First of all, the mission of the Totem Temple gave Qiyue 5,000 attribute rewards.

Secondly, in the process of slaughtering the Clan, Qiyue killed hundreds of people and obtained a large number of energy points and attribute points.

As a result, Qiyue's combat power has reached 860 stars, and the level has been upgraded to level 18.

"Yue'er, seeing that your combat power has reached 860 stars, if you go further, you are expected to challenge the gods to build a foundation. Otherwise, you will wait until your combat power breaks 900 stars before you go to build a foundation?"

Qin Feng said 10 times with concern.

Qiyue smiled bitterly: "Master, you know it. 900 stars can pass the inferior god-grade foundation, which is just our speculation at the time. After all, this kind of test depends not only on combat power, but also on talent."

"My talent is far less than that of the master. If the master's 900-star level can surpass the low-level god-level foundation, I need at least 1,200-star combat power. And my current combat power is only 870-star, which is worse than 1,200 stars. a lot."

Hearing this, Qin Feng nodded slightly.

What Qiyue said was true.

He has a variety of powerful talents, and with the same combat power, he can easily crush the same level.

Obviously, it is obviously inaccurate to use the combat power to measure the Shengwu assessment.

If you use comprehensive strength to judge, you will be more prepared.

At the moment, Qin Feng said: "You are only level 18 now, and the assessment period is level 40. Before level 40, you still have a chance to improve."

Qiyue shook her head: "Master, you can't wait any longer. You know, the difficulty of this foundation building assessment will increase with the level. Take Master as an example, before level 20, your combat power reached 900 stars. , it is expected to pass the inferior divine grade assessment."

"But if you exceed level 20, the difficulty of the assessment will increase by 20%. If you exceed level 25, the difficulty will increase by 20%. If you exceed level 30, the difficulty will increase by 20%. And so on, every 5 levels, the difficulty will increase by 20%."

"I am now at level 18. If I take the assessment now, I will face the least difficult assessment. If I wait for the assessment at level 21, the difficulty will increase by 20%."

"With 1200 combat power as the standard, if the difficulty is increased by 20%, the combat power needs to be around 1450 stars. But I have upgraded from level 18 to level 21, and the increase in combat power brought by the upgrade will probably be less than 5 stars."

"If you could improve your 100-star combat power if you were to test your chances, that would be extremely terrifying. But such an increase in combat power will not keep up with the increase in the difficulty of the assessment! It would be worth the loss. Since that's the case, I might as well go to the assessment now. "

"In short, the earlier the test of the Holy Martial Arts, the better. If it is too late, it will be more difficult to pass. Therefore, when we were in the Holy Martial Hall, we saw that many people took the test before level 20."

Qin Feng nodded slightly.

Qiyue's analysis is very reasonable.

Afterwards, he sighed: "It seems that when the trivial matters are finished, let Liu Xuan and the others go to take the assessment early. Don't wait for the assessment after level 20. It will increase the difficulty, which may not be a good thing."

Qiyue smiled and said: "Yes! Unless that person is very lucky, and after level 20, he has a great chance. Or, that person can be as good as the master. The higher the level, the faster the promotion."

"By the way, Master, you are now level 28. According to this line of thinking, the difficulty of the assessment you are facing has increased by 40%."

"According to the 900-star combat power you calculated earlier, you need to reach around 1,300 stars in order to pass the low-level god-level assessment. Then the middle-level god-level test and the high-level god-level test should be higher."

Qin Feng nodded and said, "That's true! Maybe, the difficulty of the middle-level god-level assessment is twice that of the low-level **** level."

Qi Yue was surprised: "Master, wouldn't it be so exaggerated? I think it's three times harder at most!"

Qin Feng smiled and shook his head: "It's not an exaggeration! Think about it! The power of building a base of a low-level **** is 1,000 stars, the power of a medium-level **** is 2,000 stars, and the power of a high-level **** is 4,000 stars. class."

"This foundation building power is doubled again and again, so the difficulty of the assessment will naturally double, and it may even be higher."

Qi Yue was surprised: "Master, in this calculation, you have to pass the high-level divine grade assessment, and at least have a combat power of 5,200 stars or more before you are expected to pass!"

Qin Feng said with emotion: "Yeah! It may even be more. I'm still a little short of 5,200 stars. However, I still have methods that I haven't used."

"Oh!"

This discussion made Qi Yue a little uneasy.

She is very much looking forward to the master being able to pass the first-class divine examination.

Knew it!

Not everyone can obtain the foundation of the gods.

It's like she doesn't have that ability.

As for the foundation of the first-class gods, it is even more difficult to imagine.

I'm afraid that the gods and goddesses of the gods, few people can do it!

Even the master is in danger of failing the challenge.

"Little girl, are you sure, are you going to the assessment now?"

Qin Feng asked again.

"Um!"

Qiyue nodded firmly.

She is not the master, and she has no confidence to rise above level 20, which will make herself stronger.

And Qin Feng had such confidence at the beginning, but also because of the endless extraction of SSS level, which is a super talent that keeps him growing.

The longer the time, the better for him.

Therefore, Qin Feng is completely different from others.

"Little girl, it's settled, let's go to the assessment!"

At the moment, Qin Feng waved his hand and took Qiyue into the zero-degree space.

Then, he released another clone.

After doing this, he also returned to the zero-degree space.

At the moment, only a space node the size of a soybean is left in place.

The clone opened his mouth and took a breath, and swallowed the space node into his belly.

Then, he flew towards Tongtian Lake.

Now, Qin Feng's time is extremely precious, and the trivial matters of the journey are arranged for the clone

A few minutes later, in the zero-degree space, in the room.

Qin Feng opened the personal panel to check the gain of attribute points this time.

[Free attribute]: 30740 points

good! good!

The attribute points harvested have once again accumulated to more than 30,000 points.

He is going to participate in the Shengwu assessment now, and he needs to improve his strength!

Thinking of this, he quickly added some more.

After a while, the attribute points were added, and he hurriedly checked his latest data.

[Level]: Level 28 (human level)

[Occupation]: Level 18 (Judge)

[Reputation]: 556 points (novice supreme)

[Combat Strength]: 5700 stars

"Hoo~!"

After reading this, Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief and smiled.

5700 stars!

Exceeded his estimate of 5,200 stars.

There is great hope for the foundation of the first-class gods!

Of course, all of this is still his speculation, and the specifics will only be known after an assessment.

After all, the first-class god-level assessment is already the highest level in the world. How could it be so easy for the Dao of Heaven to make achievements?

There will inevitably be some difficulties!

However, if he succeeds in establishing a foundation with a high-grade god, then he will be able to obtain a 4,000-star foundation-building power, which is exciting just thinking about it!

At that time, his comprehensive combat power will probably break through ten thousand stars!

If it breaks the ten thousand stars, it is the threshold of the heaven-level fifth-layer powerhouse.

The Heaven-level triple combat power range is 4000 to 6000 stars.

The sky-level quadruple battle 287 force range is 6000 to 9000 stars.

The five-level combat power category of the heaven level is 9,000 to 15,000 stars.

At this thought, Qin Feng's heart was hot.

Then, his eyes fell on the prestige column again.

His reputation has reached 556 points, which is 44 points away from the goal of 600 points.

There are still about 11 hours before the end of the prestige challenge.

He also had to find a way to increase his reputation to 600 points.

As long as he reaches 600 points, he will get another 60,000 attribute rewards in the prestige challenge.

If it doesn't reach 600 points, there will only be 40,000 attribute rewards.

The difference between the two is 20,000 points!Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

"By the way, the Nine-layered Hall of Vientiane. For the first time entering each floor, there will be 5 reputation rewards. There will also be reputation rewards for killing guardian spirit beasts."

Thinking of this, Qin Feng laughed.

It seems that going to the Temple of Vientiane this time is really killing two birds with one stone!

At the same time, at the distant Yuanzu headquarters.

Yuan Kong glanced at the bed, and among the messy quilts lay a curvaceous figure.

He smiled smugly, tidied up his clothes again, and walked out of the bedroom with ease.

Haven't been so relaxed in a long time!

He is now physically and mentally healthy and in a good mood.

The reason why he was in a good mood was because of the prestige challenge, there were only eleven hours left to end.

As long as the challenge is over, he can get the positions of those challenging forces.

At that time, he will be able to reap the points.

When he thought of a lot of points, his heart was surging, like last night's madness, intense and excited.

As for, is there any challenger's reputation that can break 200 points?

In his view, that is impossible!

They are just a group of human beings from a small world, and they can't make any big waves.

The success of the Yaotian family made him see an example.

He didn't know that Qin Feng's reputation was not far from 600 points, let alone 200 points.
