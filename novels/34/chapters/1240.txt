That is Hongmeng Avenue!

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, the voice of Tiandao sounded in the sky above the secret realm!

[Challenge reminder: Player Qin Feng (Jiyang Ontology) has stepped into the secret realm of Jiuzhongtian, and automatically activated the challenge of the ninth-rank divine position! „Äë

[Challenge reminder: Player Qin Feng (the body of the extreme yin) has stepped into the secret realm of the Nine Heavens, and the challenge of the ninth-rank divine position has been automatically activated! „Äë

[Challenge reminder: It is detected that two players are the masters of the 'Fengchan Heavenly Monument', and the divine position challenge is automatically upgraded]

Om~! Om~!

As soon as the prompt came out, the two lotus platforms in front of the gods suddenly burst into golden light!

Click~! Click~! click~!

Immediately afterwards, the two lotus pedestals of the gods gave birth to four petals each at a speed visible to the naked eye, turning into forty petals!

The aura of the two lotus altars has skyrocketed, and the glow on them is even more dazzling!

The anode body hurriedly snooped away...

[Tenth Grade Divine Rank (Xuanhuang): contains the 'Road of Kings', the 'Road of Emperor' Xuanhuang Avenue (Xiantian)]

[Ten-Rank Divine Throne (Hongmeng): contains the 'Road of Kings', the 'Road of Emperor' Hongmeng Avenue (Xiantian)]

Seeing this, the eyes of the polar body are shining!

The benefits of recognizing the master of the Fengchan Heaven Monument are here, and the two major gods have advanced!

They have reached an unprecedented tenth-grade **** position!

At this time, Tiandao sent another reminder

[God rank advancement completed! Challenge opens automatically]

[Challenge content: After the contestant selects a certain divine position, within a thousand feet of the altar, the 'guardian spirit of the divine position' will be automatically activated! „Äë

[A player who kills the guardian spirit of the gods within an hour is a successful challenge. Failure to kill within the timeout period, or being killed, is regarded as a failure of the challenge! „Äë

[Reminder: If you kill the guardian spirit within 10 seconds, you can get a special reward! „Äë

[Reminder: The tenth-grade guardian spirit is extremely powerful. It is recommended that players have a combat power of 500 million stars, and the challenge success rate can reach 50%! „Äë

After listening to the prompt, the two main bodies all smiled.

500 million star combat power, the success rate is only 50%!

The difficulty of the tenth-grade **** position is indeed greater than that of the ninth-grade **** position!

The challenge threshold for the ninth-rank **** position is 200 million combat power, and the success rate is 50%.

When he reached the tenth-rank **** position, it suddenly soared to 500 million!

And Qin Feng's basic combat power is 557 billion stars, which has passed the reference standard!

Of course, the goal of the two main bodies is not to challenge, but to kill the guardian spirit within 10 seconds!

According to Tiandao's prompt, kill the guardian spirit within 10 seconds, and there are special rewards!

At this thought, Ji Yang's body was greatly moved!

Then, he called out the Pantian Dao Axe!

Om~!

As soon as the axe came out, the aura was released!

In just a split second, he completed the integration of human and machine, and his momentum instantly soared to 657 billion stars!

"Calculate the time, the cooldown of the critical strike has expired, it should be able to be used again~"!"

Ji Yang took a look at the giant axe in his hand, and walked forward confidently.

Although he couldn't use the Seven Killing Divine Body and the Dharma Phase Golden Body, but with the help of the Pantian Dao Axe and a knowing strike, he was confident that he could kill the target within 10 seconds.

In this way, the polar body walked towards the altar on the left.

The very yin body stayed in place, watching silently!

Soon, the body of Jiyang walked to the vicinity of the altar and stepped within a thousand feet!

hum~~!

Suddenly, the starlight gathered in front, and a snake-headed human body, a demon **** with yellow scales, condensed out of thin air!

The anode body hurriedly peeped towards it

[Evil spirit]: Xuanling

[Boundary]: Quasi-half-step eternity

[Combat Strength]: 500 million stars

[Characteristics]: Guardian Spirit of God

At the same moment, Xuan Ling also stared at Ji Yang's body with a cold expression on his face, with a hint of consternation in his eyes!

It is the guardian spirit of the tenth-grade god!

Unexpectedly, it was awakened!

Could it be that the human being in front of him has become the owner of the 'Fengchan Heavenly Monument'?

Only the owner of the Fengchan Heaven Monument can activate the tenth-grade divine position challenge!

Without waiting for it to think about it, the voice of Tiandao came again

[Challenge timing starts:]

Boom~!

As soon as the timer started, Ji Yang's body flashed and instantly killed Xuan Ling!

"court death!"

Boom~!

Xuan Ling took the initiative to attack, and grabbed it towards Ji Yang's chest with one claw.

sigh~ la~!

This shot, the sharp claws glowing with cold light, with a sharp claw wind, cut through the void, leaving a long claw mark!

In the blink of an eye, Xuan Ling's claw was close to the front, and he was about to catch Qin Feng's heart!

At this moment, its eyes are full of bloodthirsty excitement!

It wants to pierce the human's chest with one claw, pull out his heart, and crush it to pieces!

Humph~!

It's not that easy to get past it!

At least, it must be within a hundred strokes, so that this human cannot win!

Phew~~!

Thinking of this, the speed of Xuan Ling's claw increased by one point!

At this moment, the polar body also shot!

He slashed at it with an axe with all his might!

Swish~!

The axe was slashed, and the body of the axe lit up with the light of the heavens!

A knowing strike also activates instantly!

The Taoist skills and the critical strike are superimposed!

The power of that axe instantly reached 1.97 trillion stars!

"Hey! This is"

Xuan Ling's face changed greatly!

It sensed in an instant that the axe's momentum was infinitely close to 2 trillion stars, and it was not something it could resist!

But all this is too late!

Swish~!

Axe light passed!

Kacha~!

A crisp sound!

The polar body was split into two halves with one axe!

That Xuanling didn't even have time to scream, and it burst into pieces, turning into a yellow fog that filled the sky and dissipated everywhere!

In the next second, a dazzling white light flew out of the yellow mist and poured into the body of Ji Yang.

[You successfully killed Xuan Ling (quasi-half-step eternity), and obtained +420,000 trillion energy points]

[You successfully killed Xuan Ling (quasi-half-step eternity) and obtained +1.8 million gold judgment points]

[You successfully killed Xuan Ling (quasi half-step eternity) and gained +30,000 reputation]

[You successfully killed Xuan Ling (quasi-half-step eternity), and 3 chaotic treasure chests (complete state) exploded]

[Congratulations on completing the tenth-rank **** position challenge! Please go to the altar and integrate the tenth-grade **** position (xuanhuang) independently! „Äë

[Detected players completed the challenge within 10 seconds! Players get special rewards! This reward is issued after the fusion of the gods! „Äë

Soon, the yellow fog will all dissipate!

There is no real spirit left in the field, nor any luck left in the residual spirit, there are only 3 treasure chests!

Obviously, this divine guardian spirit is somewhat different.

They should revive indefinitely, so nothing more remains!

Jiyang body put away the treasure box!

In fact, he is already very satisfied with these!

After beheading this mysterious spirit, he gained a lot of energy and judgment points, as well as 30,000 reputation points!

As a result, his reputation value reached 620,000 points!

In addition, his special rewards will not be issued until after the fusion of the gods.

Then, it's time for him to fuse the divine position!

Thinking of this, Jiyang body strode to the altar

Soon, he walked up to the altar and came to the lotus pedestal.

Looking at the lotus platform in front of him, he felt a little excited.

When he refines this lotus platform, he can be promoted to the real **** realm, and his strength will be greatly improved.

At that time, he will have more confidence in dealing with Venerable Puyin!

With this in mind, as soon as the extreme yang body waved his hand, the Pantian Dao Axe automatically flew towards the extreme yin body.

Afterwards, he stepped onto the lotus pedestal, closed his eyes and meditated, and began to merge with the gods.

At the same moment, the very yin body casually caught the Pantian Dao Axe and completed the integration of human and machine!

After doing this, he went to the altar on the right

Soon, he also activated the guardian spirit!Th.√™ most uptodatùìÆ nùíêvels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

It was a demon **** with a dragon head and a body with red scales. Its name was Hongling!

The extremely yin body is no nonsense, and when he jumped up, he slashed it with an axe, and the process was extremely smooth!

At this moment, a white light flew out from the red mist that Hongling turned into and poured into the body of the extreme yin body.

[You successfully killed Hongling (quasi-half-step eternity) and obtained +420,000 trillion energy points]

[You successfully killed Hongling (quasi-half-step eternity) and obtained +1.8 million gold judgment points]
