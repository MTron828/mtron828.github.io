She couldn't understand why the master liked to do that in this hall?

Is it a special hobby?

However, since it is what the master needs, she will also

Before she knew it, she had given up on Qin Feng.

In just a moment, Qin Feng walked in front of her.

That incomparably handsome face suddenly got closer to her, Yu Xuanji's little heart was beating wildly, and her breathing was a little short.

"Close your eyes!"

"Oh!"

Yu Xuanji obediently closed his eyes, raised his chin slightly, and became more and more nervous, even holding his breath.

She knew that the master was going to attack her.

really! The next moment, a warm finger pressed against her eyebrows.

Before she could think about it, a strange energy poured into her eyebrows along the warm fingertips.

At the same time, in Qin Feng's sea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãknowledge, there was a reminder of the Tao of Heaven.

[Reminder: You are recruiting Yu Xuanji as a 'human messenger']

[The trial solicitation was successful! Yu Xuanji has become your 'human messenger! „Äë

[Congratulations on your vocation skill 'One Prison Suppression' is automatically promoted to 'Two Prison Suppression'! „Äë

Whoo~!

This time it was done successfully!

Finally another messenger!

Qin Feng put down his fingers and breathed a sigh of relief!

It turned out that he just wanted to recruit Yu Xuanji as a messenger! pill.

Chapter 649: The Third-Class Star Lord! Planet roaming!

Last time, Qin Feng wanted to develop Qingchengzi into a 'human messenger', but Qingchengzi had the blood of an S-level true dragon and could not be recruited.

This time, he finally succeeded in recruiting.

As a result, his messengers reached six.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng looked at Yu Xuanji with joy.

He was extremely satisfied with Yu Xuanji's strength and talent.

This woman's combat power is one line away from the peak of the False God, stronger than Feng Xi, Xiao Luan'er, and Qi Yue, and has reached 3.9 million stars.

In this way, Yu Xuanji can give him a combat power of around 2.7 million stars.

This is not a small amount!

What's even better is that with the addition of Yu Xuanji, he finally opened the Second Prison Suppression, and his comprehensive strength has skyrocketed!

At this moment, Yu Xuanji also opened his eyes.

At this moment, she blushed in embarrassment.

She already knew that she had misunderstood her master again.

It turned out that the master just wanted to recruit her as a messenger, and didn't want to mess things up.

"It's over here! Let's go out!"

Qin Feng smiled lightly and walked outside the hall.

Yu Xuanji hurriedly followed.

"Right! I almost forgot about it!"

Qin Feng stopped again and looked at Yu Xuanji.

"Master, what's wrong?"

Yu Xuanji was puzzled.

Qin Feng didn't say much, and pressed another finger to Yu Xuanji's eyebrows.

Yu Xuanji obediently closed his eyes.

Om~!

In the next second, a black and white two-color divine mark appeared on Qin Feng's fingertips, which slowly melted into the depths of Yu Xuanji's eyebrows.

After doing this, Qin Feng put down his fingers and showed a satisfied smile.

"Master, what was it just now?"

Yu Xuanji asked curiously.

Qin Feng smiled slightly: "I planted a reincarnation seal for you!"

"Reincarnation Seal? What is that?"

"That's my vocation skill! After planting the seal of reincarnation for you, even if you fall, I can resurrect you an unlimited number of times. Simply put, if I don't die, you won't die!"

Yu Xuanji exclaimed: "My God! The seal of reincarnation has such a wonderful effect! To a certain extent, if I have an immortal body. After all, it is rare to see people who can hurt their master!"

The more Yu Xuanji spoke, the more excited he became.

The previous embarrassment was also virtually eliminated.

Qin Feng smiled, "There are days outside the sky, and there are people outside people. There are many people in this world who are stronger than me. I can't wait too optimistically."

Yu Xuanji said: "My concubine understands! In short, I am grateful to the master for the divine seal!"

"You don't have to be so polite! You are already my messenger, and you will be one of my closest confidants in the future, so don't be so polite."

Hearing this, Yu Xuanji was elated.

This is the master's highest recognition to her.

At this moment, she inexplicably felt that Qin Feng was very kind, and the previous embarrassment was gone.

The master recognized her so.

Then she is willing to give her own perfection to the master, and there is nothing to be ashamed of.

Qin Feng looked at her happy look and showed a relieved smile.

Unconsciously, the relationship between the two became more intimate.

Qin Feng naturally knew what Yu Xuanji was thinking.

After all, this woman has said it before.

In this way, you don't have to cover up, and you will get along more openly.

In other words, if Qin Feng has that kind of demand for Yu Xuanji, he doesn't need to go around the corner, just pick it up.

"Let's go! Let's go and see what's going on outside!"

"Um!"

Yu Xuanji happily left with Qin Feng

After a while, the two returned to the station square.

Under the handling of the hundred thousand children, the battlefield has been cleaned up almost.

As soon as Qin Feng appeared, all the high-level officials came forward with joy and greeted him one after another.

"Master, this battlefield is almost cleaned up!"

"Dad, everyone has gained a lot this time! Now, my Long Yuan's children have reached the demigod realm or above, and there are more than 700 people."

Feng Xi and Xiao Luan said excitedly.

Hearing this, Qin Feng nodded in relief.

The combat power reaches the demigod realm or above, that is, the combat power exceeds 200,000 stars.

The number of more than 700 people is extremely impressive!

At the moment, Qin Feng looked around again and showed a happy smile again.

He found that none of the veteran Long Yuan disciples had a combat power lower than 140,000 stars.

The disciples of the Tiance clan who joined later did not have a combat power lower than 80,000 stars.

In short, Longyuan City is very powerful now!

"Boss, what are we going to do next?"

Liu Xuan took the initiative to ask.

Granny Feng Qi smiled and said, "Of course it is to clear the remnants of the red and green camps and end this round of hegemony as soon as possible!"

Elder Qishan also agreed: "Yeah! When this round of hegemony is over, Tiandao should issue rewards to the victorious camp. By the way, the points mall will also be opened. This time, we will usher in another game in Longyuan City. Great harvest!"

As soon as these words fell, everyone smiled happily.

Liu Xuan even said happily: "You two, after you say this, I can't wait to clear the remnants, so that this round of hegemony can end as soon as possible!"

"Hee hee! I'm looking forward to it too!"

Xiao Luan'er also happily agreed.

But at this moment, Yu Xuanji's voice sounded in the field.

"Everyone, I have a very serious question that I would like to share with you."

As soon as these words fell, everyone looked at her.

Even Qin Feng looked at her curiously.

Yu Xuanji took a deep breath and looked at Qin Feng.

"Master, do you remember that 'God' said it before he fell. His body is the existence of the king of the gods. His body will come here in ten days to avenge him!"

Boom~!

As soon as these words fell, the audience was shocked!

Before, when Qin Feng killed God, everyone in Long Yuan was in the zero-dimensional space, and they did not witness it with their own eyes, only the Tiance people saw it.

At this time, Granny Yusang also agreed: "Yeah! I heard that sentence, and I don't know if what God said is true or false."

Qin Feng also said: "God's words are true and false, but one sentence is true. He is really just an incarnation!"

Boom~!

As soon as these words fell, the high-level officials changed their colors again.

Afterwards, Liu Xuan exclaimed: "My God! God is so strong, it's actually just an incarnation! If it is the body, how strong should it be? Boss, if the body of God is really a **** king, then it will be troublesome!"G√©t latest ùíèovel chùíÇpters on nùíêv(e)lbj/n(.)c/ùíêm

Granny Feng Qi agreed: "Yes! If our Blue Star Realm is targeted by a god-king, it will be more fortunate than good luck!"

Qin Feng nodded slightly: "I have thought about this issue before. To be able to be as powerful as a god, its body is a **** king. With my talent and strength, if I want to withstand the attack of the **** king, at least The strength of a quasi-god king."

As soon as these words fall, all the high-level faces will look at each other!

Quasi-God King!

That is the peerless power of easily crushing the Lord God!

Today, the master has not even reached the strength of the main **** threshold, and he wants to have the strength of a quasi **** king, I am afraid that it is too late!

Thinking of this, the high-level executives became a little nervous and uneasy.

They worry about running out of time!

Qin Feng also saw everyone's worries.

He then said: "If I want to achieve the strength of a quasi-god king in a short period of time, there are some opportunities such as the rewards after the end of this hegemony competition, the points mall, and the chance of the second level of the Holy Land, the Shenwu assessment, and the star master. examination."

"These are all big opportunities! If you can grasp it well, your strength will inevitably skyrocket. It may not be impossible to reach the strength of a quasi-god king before God's body arrives."

"Only when my strength is reached, can we in the Blue Star Realm be safe. Of course, if it is not achieved, we may have to escape from the Blue Star Realm ahead of schedule and avoid the confrontation with God's body."
