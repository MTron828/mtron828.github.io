And those black spar, embedded in a large ore deposit, seems to be born from the ore deposit.

Is it another mine?

Qin Feng hurriedly detected the black spar...

[Dark Shining Stone: Tier 5 resource, one of the essential materials needed to upgrade the 8th-level wooden house. „Äë

Seeing this, Qin Feng's eyes showed joy.

It's really a mine!

Where there is a shining stone, there is a dark shining stone!

Shining Stone is a must-have material for level 7 wooden houses.

Dark Shining Stone is a necessary material to upgrade the 8th level wooden house.

This is a mine of Dark Shining Stone.

Looking at this world, the stars are everywhere, and there are millions of dark Yaoshi!

Qin Feng is in a good mood.

Having said that, this trip to the Totem Temple is so worth it.

In light of resource mines, several places have been discovered.

At present, Longyuan Town has all the strategic resources needed from the 1st-level wooden house to the 9th-level wooden house.

This is very beneficial to the future development of Longyuan Town!

The premise of all this is that he can kill the beast **** and completely seize the totem temple.

Of course, what he has to do now is to kill the beast emperor on the eighth floor.

Thinking of this, he looked forward.

In that direction, there is a towering ancient tree with a height of 10,000 zhang.

Qin Feng could not help but detect it.

[Moon Flower Tree: The eighth-order heaven and earth spirit tree, a kind of spirit tree nurtured by the power of the extreme yin of the heavens and the earth. It has no spiritual thoughts, but has its own S-level talent - the law of extreme yin. „Äë

[Reminder: Those who have A-level dark laws often sit under this tree to comprehend. „Äë

Qin Feng was surprised.

This tree is actually an eighth-order spiritual creature!

This is the highest level thing he has ever seen.

However, this laurel tree is also really magical.

As long as you sit under this tree and comprehend, you will have the opportunity to obtain the S-rank - the law of extreme yin!

The Law of Extreme Yin is an advanced version of the Law of Darkness.

The light and the dark are somewhat special.

The law of light can be promoted to the S-level extreme sun law in a straight line.Checkk new ùíèovel chùíÇpters at novùíÜlbin(.)com

The law of darkness can be promoted to the S-level extreme yin law in a straight line.

The combination of the extreme cathode and the extreme Yang can also obtain the SS-level Taiji Law.

Seeing this, Qin Feng was moved.

He wanted to get this laurel tree into zero-dimensional space.

However, this laurel tree has an owner.

Qin Feng raised his head and looked at the branches on the side of Laurel.

There was a huge crow squatting on it. It was several meters long, and its whole body was silver. The whole body exuded a bright silver light, forming a white halo around it.

From a distance, the white halo is like a bright moon, hanging above the treetops, illuminating this dark world, and setting off that Yinwu is extremely sacred.

Qin Feng hurriedly peeped towards Yinwu...

[Ferocious Beast]: Dark Night Silver Crow (Emperor Grade)

[Level]: Level 58

[Realm]: Heaven-level realm (low-grade combined Dao)

[Combat Strength]: 2300 stars

[Talent]: Extreme Yin Law (S-level, not fully grasped, in the process of comprehending), Dark Law (A-level), B-level bloodline talent (Yuewu)

„ÄêSkill„Äë:? ? ? ?

[Features]: Guardian of the Jedi, brutal, bloodthirsty, associated.

[Status]: Controlled

[Origin]: One of the nine beast emperors under the throne of the beast god.

"This dark night Yinwu is really strong!"

Qin Feng muttered in his heart.

Seeing that its basic combat power has reached 2300 stars, it is a full 400 stars more than Xiezhi.

If combined with the power of the Tao, its combat power can reach 3300 stars, which is already the second level of heaven.

It seemed that he had underestimated the strength of these beast emperors before.

You must know that his combat power is only 3400 stars, so he has no advantage in front of this silver black.

What's more, Yinwu has also mastered some S-level extreme yin laws, and his comprehensive strength must be extremely strong.

If this is the case, the two sides will have to fight hard!

I don't want to do so much, let's kill this guy first.

As long as he kills this Silver Crow, he can get the eighth-order Moonflower Tree.

With the help of this spiritual tree, he will sooner or later realize the S-level extreme yin law.

At the same time, Qiyue also has the opportunity to obtain the S-level Extreme Yin Law.

Because both of them have A-level dark laws and have the prerequisites for perception.

As for extracting the extreme yin talent from Yinye Yinwu, there is a high probability that it will fail.

Because Yinwu himself has not fully grasped it, it cannot be extracted.

While thinking wildly, Qin Feng quietly walked towards Yuehuashu.

At this moment, Dark Night Yinwu is closing his eyes.

It is in a state of perception.

Not long after, Qin Feng was only three thousand feet away from the Moon Flower Tree.

At this moment, the white light that came out of thin air gradually became less and less, and finally stopped abruptly.

Qin Feng knew that the battle on the Mirage clone was over.

As soon as his heart moved, he opened the panel to check the gains from the attribute points.

[Free attribute points]: 20147 points

A full 20,000 points!

Qin Feng was surprised.

This time the harvest is too rich!

By the way, this dark night Yinwu is not weak!

He might as well add attribute points first, improve his strength, and then kill Yinye Yinwu.

If it can be done with a single strike of thunder, it will be the best to kill this silver black with one blow.

Lest this Yinwu escape to the ninth floor and join forces with the ninth floor beast emperor, it would be a big trouble.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng quickly added some...

At the same moment, the entrance to the Valley of Seven Kills.

The war is over!

At this moment, Taniguchi was full of corpses, blood flowing into rivers.

There was a thick smell of blood in the air.

The Longyuan army is clearing the battlefield.

The Mirage clone is also extracting the bodies of the Earth-level powerhouses.

In this battle, Longyuan Town won a great victory, slaughtering all the children of the Cang Clan.

In Longyuan Town, only 740 people were injured and no one died.

Afterwards, those injured were healed by wood-type talents.

As for the ground-level powerhouses of the Cang clan, they were all killed by the Mirage clones, and no one escaped.

At the speed of the phantom avatar, the local powerhouses who escaped were caught up one by one and killed in despair...

Anyway, this fight is over.

Qin Feng and Long Yuan received a lot of money.

Longyuan Zhenguang's total points have exceeded 10,000 points.

Qin Feng alone has more than 7,000 points.

This big gain of points makes everyone happy.

Everyone is also looking forward to what benefits they can get after the rules of points are announced.

It was at this moment that the Mirage clone extracted all the bodies of the powerhouses at the prefecture level and stood up satisfied.

The storage rings of the earth-level powerhouses have also fallen into his hands, and the harvest can be said to be huge.

"Liu Xuan!"

"Subordinates are here!"

In the crowd, Liu Xuan hurriedly came to the Mirage clone.

At this moment, his face was full of joy.

After this battle, he has risen to level 16, and his combat power has also broken through 200 stars, which is equivalent to reaching the threshold of the prefecture level.

"Liu Xuan, there are still eight tribes left in the Cang clan. However, the personnel of those eight tribes have basically been transferred here, which means they have been taken out of time."

"Judging from the current information, the Cang clan's ground-level powerhouses are all dead. There are no ground-level powerhouses in the eight divisions, and there are only hundreds of people in each division."

"Tonight, you will lead the army and destroy them one by one, forever!"

Liu Xuan was overjoyed: "Don't worry, boss! With the teleportation formation, my subordinates will be able to slaughter the eight clans of the Guangcang clan before dawn, without any future troubles!"

"Okay! I'll leave it to you here!"

Leaving this sentence behind, the Mirage clone hurried towards the teleportation array.

He wants to return to the zero-degree space, ready to support the main body at any time...

At the same moment, the Totem Temple, the eighth floor space.

More than 20,000 attributes!

Qin Feng finally finished adding it.

His combat power skyrocketed to 3770 stars in one fell swoop.

Such strength made him very satisfied, and his confidence in killing Yinwu increased by one point.

Immediately, he closed the panel and walked towards Yinwu

Chapter 304 Fusion! Final form!

In just a moment, Qin Feng quietly walked to the vicinity of the Moon Flower Tree, which was only a hundred feet away from Yinwu.
