Majestic Desert Splendor

Qin Feng suddenly realized.

He clearly remembered that a fragment of the seal exploded from each of the Hell's Double-Headed Dogs.

In this way, he killed six hellhounds, which is six fragments, isn't it enough!

Qin Feng happily put away the seal fragments.

"Oh~oh~!"

At this moment, in the village behind him, the crowing of a rooster actually sounded.

The voice was very loud and penetrated the night sky.

Are there chickens in the village?

Qin Feng couldn't help but look back, and saw that with the sound of the **** crowing, the dawn of dawn came at this moment, shrouded in the sky over the whole village.

Immediately afterwards, the mysterious village gradually became transparent, gradually looming, and seemed to disappear...

Qin Feng was startled and could not help but go forward to check.

As he approached, the entire village disappeared without a trace, and in front of him became a barren land, only the towering old tree stood alone in the wind.

The village has disappeared!

Qin Feng was stunned.

It was at this moment that a reminder of Heavenly Dao sounded in his mind.

[Reminder: The lost village connects thousands of novice villages. It falls in the dark and disappears before dawn. 】

So this is ah!

Qin Feng was stunned.

It turned out that the 'lost village' connected thousands of novice villages, and only appeared in the dark night.

That is to say, as long as there is a dark seal, tens of billions of people around the world have the opportunity to enter it.

At this thought, Qin Feng became anxious.

He was worried that other novice villagers would take the lead and take away the treasures in this lost village.

fine!

This world of killing the heavens has only been opened for a day. There should be few people like him who directly broke into the level 10 fierce beast area and discovered this 'village' by chance.

In any case, he has to explore this village early and get the treasures in it first.

He didn't want to be cheap to others.

Tonight, he will come again!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng looked at the dog's corpse at his feet, where he was still lying quietly.

He breathed a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, the dog corpses are all there, and they did not disappear with the village.

At the moment, he hurried forward to extract...

【Endless extraction success! Get the E-level talent - Dark Enhancement! 】

Got a new talent!

good! good!

Qin Feng was very happy.

[Reminder: Your vocation judge upgrade progress has reached level 1 (100/100), and you still need to realize the D-level talent - dark manipulation before you can be promoted to level 2. 】

It turns out that his vocation has reached level 1 (100/100)!

However, its promotion has talent requirements.

This job is not easy!

It seems that this prompt is triggered only after acquiring the E-level dark enhancement talent.

I don't know what the benefits will be after the upgrade?

Thinking of this, Qin Feng is full of expectations for the upgrade of his vocation.

Then, he continued to harvest the spoils.

Soon, he found the second canine corpse, got another seal fragment, and then went forward to extract it...

【Endless extraction success! Obtained the E-level talent again - Dark Enhancement! 】

[The two talents are automatically superimposed and strengthened, and they are evolving independently...]

[Talent evolution failed... Your dark talent is still at E-level. 】

Forehead!

It failed this time!

Qin Feng felt a little regretful.

He continued to search in the same way, and soon found the third canine corpse, collected the third seal fragment, and then extracted...

【Endless extraction success! Obtained the E-level talent again - Dark Enhancement! 】

[The two talents are automatically superimposed and strengthened, and they are evolving independently...]

[Talent evolution is successful! Your Dark Talent has been promoted to D Rank - Dark Manipulation. 】

[It is detected that you have the D-level talent flame control and D-level talent dark control, and you can awaken the talent skill - Hellfire! 】

[Hellfire: The second-order skill, its power is related to the strength of fire, dark, and energy. 】

Awakening new skills!

It's still a second-order skill!

So cool!

Qin Feng was surprised!

[Your dark talent has been promoted to D rank and has reached the conditions for promotion of vocation. 】

【You have been promoted to level 2 judge successfully! 】

【Your strength index increases by 20 points! 】

【Your agility index increases by 20 points! 】

【Your BMI increases by 20 points! 】

【Your energy index increases by 20 points! 】

Om~!

At this moment, Qin Feng's body lit up with a dazzling white light!

The warm feeling spread all over his body, extremely comfortable...Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After a while, the light disappeared.

He opened his eyes with joy.

Upgraded!

The vocation has finally been upgraded!

Upgrading one level of vocation can actually increase the attribute by 80 points, which is actually a lot stronger than ordinary upgrades!

It's cool to think about!

Qin Feng is ecstatic!

He believes that among the tens of billions of people in the world, few have a vocation.

After all, the vocation is one in a billion people.

And the world of slaughter of the heavens has only opened for a day, and it will not be full so soon.

Having said that, this vocation upgrade was too timely.

After a while of resource gambling, he has a greater chance of winning.

That Amir was an ascetic monk from A Sanguo. He was already level 7, and his progress in leveling up was actually one step faster than his.

He didn't dare to underestimate it.

So, he has to go all out.

At the moment, he continued to search for the dog corpse, and soon found the fourth one.

This time, the endless extraction failed.

He could only extract the same beast species three times indefinitely.

Mutated beasts are no exception.

Qin Feng continued to search.

In a blink of an eye, he found all six dog corpses, and obtained a total of six seal fragments.

Then, he reassembled five of the fragments into a complete 'dark seal'.

At this time, the dawn of dawn has illuminated the entire wasteland.

In the morning breeze, Qin Feng looked at the seal in his hand and was overjoyed.

It was a pentagon-shaped black seal with a strange rune engraved on the front and a head of a demon **** on the back.

"I finally got the Dark Seal. Tonight, I can enter the lost village. I don't know what good treasure is in it? Hehe!"

The more Qin Feng thought about it, the more he looked forward to it.

He couldn't put it down and watched the seal for a while, then put it into the storage ring.

Then, he took out the bronze treasure chest and prepared to open it...

[Emergency Announcement: No. 446 Novice Village has activated the gambling order, forcibly connected to No. 911 Novice Village, and open resources for gambling! 】

[Resource gambling: For the losing party, all resources are halved, and everyone weakens their attributes by 20. For the victorious side, all resources are doubled, and everyone increases their attributes by 20. 】

[Content of this competition: The first novice village to emerge from a level 8 powerhouse will win this bet. 】

[Reminder: Be the first to upgrade to level 8 and win this game, and you will be rewarded with an additional 50 attributes and a silver treasure chest. 】

[Reminder: The chat channels of the two novice areas have begun to connect in parallel...]

[Reminder: During the betting period, the ranking channels of the two major novice villages are temporarily blocked...]

The people of the Three Kingdoms finally launched!

PS: Dear readers, the collection of this book is very disturbing. The little author is begging for V collection, and begging for data!

Chapter 40 Shadow boots, the speed is skyrocketing!

The people of the Three Kingdoms finally launched!

The resource betting has begun...

Qin Feng felt a sense of urgency in his heart.

Then, he took a deep breath and opened the bronze treasure chest.

A burst of white light lit up, the treasure chest disappeared, and he had an extra pair of boots in his hand.

The boots have black bottom and purple surface, gilded dragon pattern, and the style is very domineering.

【Treasure box opened successfully! Get the second-order item - Shadow Boots! 】

[Shadow Boots: Agility +15, Defense +5, Movement Speed ​​+50%. 】

Wow~!

The boots actually have a movement speed +50%.

Wear it and run like the wind!
