He just said that if there is another False God realm that can enter the top 100, his name will be read upside down!

Unexpectedly, the voice fell, and I was slapped in the face!

This face is too fast!

"My God! Fellow Daoist Bai Ni, another False God has entered the top 100! It's still number 17!"

At this moment, the exclamation of the gray-robed old man sounded beside him.

Bai Ni swallowed his saliva and looked even more embarrassed.

And at this moment, the audience is completely boiling!

The 17th False God Realm!

This year's False God realm players are too terrifying!G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

All the players couldn't believe their eyes!

At this time, the golden light lit up again on the stele, and the ranking continued...

16th with 92 points‚Ä¶

15th with 92 points‚Ä¶

14th with 93 points‚Ä¶

In the corner, everyone in Long Yuan became nervous.

Especially Di Jiang!

At this moment, the little guy has already clenched his fists and his breathing has become rapid.

His points are 94 points!

Now 14th is 93 points.

This time, whether he can enter the top ten is very hard to say!

So, the little guy is very nervous!

Don't say it's Dijiang, even Jiyang's body shows a touch of nervousness!

Like Xiao Luan'er, Yu Xuanji and others, they are also nervous about Di Jiang.

This little guy is an expectation in everyone's heart!

Om~!

At this moment, a line of golden light lit up on the monument...

The new rankings are here again...

[Long Bo (God King Realm)...13th place...94 points]

Boom~!

As soon as this information came out, the audience was instantly fried!

"What?! Uncle Long was the 13th person?"

"Yeah! He is the great power of the early God King!"

"This... how is this possible? There are only 9 **** kings in the whole game! Could it be that some of them can't make it into the top ten?"

At this moment, the whole place was in chaos.

In their knowledge of you, the nine gods will definitely be in the top ten.

Now that it is ranked 13th, there is a **** king who has been eliminated in the early stage.

This is completely beyond their cognition!

Don't talk about them, those **** kings are also moved.

Especially an old man with white hair and beard was even more stunned on the spot!

He is the 13th ranked Long Bo!

He never thought that his dignified king would not be able to enter the top ten!

At the same time, everyone in Long Yuan became even more nervous.

Now the 13th place is 94 points, which is the same as Dijiang's points!

Looking at it like this, it seems that Dijiang has little hope of entering the top 100!

Maybe the 12th place is Dijiang!

Ranking continues...

[The female ugly (God King Realm)...12th place...94 points]

Boom~!

Another 94 points!

Not Dijiang!

Everyone in Long Yuan held their breath and felt even more tense!

They seem to see a glimmer of hope!

And on the square, it has been completely fried!

Gosh!

Another great god-king has been eliminated!

Two of the nine **** kings were eliminated!

At this time, the golden stele lit up again...

"The eleventh is about to appear!"

"This is the most important ranking!"

"Yeah! This ranking is a dividing line, and it is about who can enter the top ten!"

As soon as these words fell, the atmosphere in the audience was tense to the highest point!

Everyone held their breath and stared at the monument with great tension!

Even the **** kings are staring at the **** monument, and they don't dare to breathe!

In the corner, Di Jiang was so nervous that his palms were sweating!

Om~!

At this time, the golden light on the monument passed by!

A line of information slowly emerges‚Ä¶

[Boudou (God King Realm)...11th place...94 points]

Boom~!

Explosion all over the place!

Another **** king was eliminated!

However, everyone in Long Yuan's eyes lit up, and they all showed surprises.

Di Jiang was even more ecstatic!

The little guy was blushing with excitement!

If the 11th place is not him, then he will be in the top ten!

The rich and multiple rewards have been stabilized!

At this moment, the crowd was already in a commotion!

The Emperor Jin and Emperor Zi were also whispering.

"Brother Zi, three **** kings have been eliminated! As a result, four of the top ten are not **** kings! Do you think any of them are the successors of the Judgment God Realm?"

Jin Di murmured softly.

Emperor Zi frowned: "According to the meaning of the great sacrifice to the sky, the successor has the strength of the king of the gods. The old man always thought that the successor should be in the realm of the king of gods. Could it be... that's it! If you keep reading, you will know the situation!"

Emperor Jin nodded slightly and said no more.

At this moment, a golden light lit up on the monument again...

The audience was nervous and excited again!

"Everyone, the tenth place is about to appear!"

As soon as these words fell, the gods and kings in the field all showed nervousness.

Even Emperor Qing, Emperor Zi, and Emperor Jin were no exception.

Enter the top ten!

Every time there is a difference in the ranking, the reward will be much worse.

These powers who can enter the top ten are naturally very concerned about their rankings.

Om~!

Soon, the golden light on the monument passed by!

The information of the tenth place slowly emerges...

[Dijiang (False God Realm)...10th...94 points]

Boom~!

At this moment, the audience's eyes widened!

Everyone's eyeballs are about to fall!

Gosh!

A False God Realm actually entered the top ten!

They thought that even if they were not God Kings, they should be in the Main God Realm, but they didn't expect it to be a False God Realm!

This time, everyone was completely dumbfounded!

The field became dead silent!

It was as if the air had frozen at this moment!

In the corner, everyone in Long Yuan was very excited.

Ji Yang's body also breathed a sigh of relief, and a gratified smile appeared on his face.

3.8 The more benefits Di Jiang gets, the greater the benefits to him.

Soon, everyone recovered from the shock.

The crowd began to mutter!

"I really didn't expect it! The False God realm in this contest is so strong!"

"Yeah! Six are in the top 100, and one is in the top ten!"

"If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it!"

The people are in awe!

In the corner, Bai Ni said nothing, his face was very ugly.

Di Jiang's entry into the top ten made him jealous, but he was helpless.

At this time, golden light appeared on the monument...

The top ten places continue to show‚Ä¶

ninth, eighth...

Every time a ranking appeared, the audience was amazed, and there was envy and awe in his tone.

No one of the powers that can enter the top ten is weak.

In this world where strength is respected, only the strong will be respected.
