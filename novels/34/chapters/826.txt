Xiaojumang raised her cute little face and looked at the fission body.

"Dad, I feel like a brother too!"

Xiao Luan'er also said excitedly.

The fission body smiled and nodded.

There are some special inductions between pets.

Since both Jumang and Xiaoluaner said so, it should be right.

At this time, Feng Xi smiled and said, "Master, you have achieved a big harvest this time! A god-level spiritual egg, even if it is a low-level god-level, is more valuable than a middle-level artifact!"

The fission body smiled and nodded.

"By the way, master, it seems that this spiritual egg has not been fed with blood!"

Soon, Feng Xi discovered this special place.

"Hey! Really! The ancestor of Beiming didn't feed this spirit egg with blood!"

Qiyue also found out.

This time, Feng Xi, Qi Yue, and Xiao Luan'er all lit up with surprises.

Immediately, Xiao Luan'er said excitedly: "Dad, this is great! Spirit eggs that have not been fed with essence and blood have not yet recognized their masters. Then you can let them recognize you as masters smoothly! I was worried just now. Will the little guy recognize you as the master!"

Generally speaking, spirit eggs that have been fed with blood essence and blood will automatically recognize the master.

This kind of spirit egg that recognizes the Lord is extremely loyal.

The more essence and blood you feed and absorb, the more loyal you will be until death.

If it was fed a drop or two of blood essence in the early days, there is still a glimmer of hope, and it should be changed to other people.

Of course, the success rate of this change of identity is extremely low!

What makes Qin Feng and others happy is that this Gonggong egg has not been fed with blood essence, so the previous worry is no longer worry.

At the moment, the fission body muttered: "I am also surprised! Such a rare spirit egg, why did the ancestor of Beiming not drop his blood to recognize the master? This is cheap for me!"

Feng Xi smiled: "Master, this may be due to your luck! Or, Beiming's ancestor just got the spiritual egg, and he hasn't had time to drop his blood to recognize the master!"

The fission body shook his head slightly: "If something goes wrong, there must be a demon! I'm afraid it is"

As soon as the voice fell, the fission body took out the storage ring of the ancestor of Beiming, and continued to look.

After a while, he happily took out a red elixir and a drop of divine blood from the storage ring.

Feng Xi and the others were curious and looked at the elixir and blood essence.

[Blood Awakening Pill (Water Element): Demigod Rank]

[Refining this pill has a 30% chance of awakening the bloodline of a water-type divine beast. „Äë

[Reminder: You need to take a kind of water-type divine blood first, and then refine this pill in order to obtain the bloodline talent of that divine beast]

[Blood of the gods (middle grade): low grade **** rank, water attribute]

"Hey! It's actually a bloodline awakening pill, or a demigod. This divine pill is quite rare!"

"There is also the blood of the gods! The gods are water beasts! This drop of **** blood has reached the level of a low-rank god!"

Feng Xi's three daughters were overjoyed again.

The fission body is also full of joy.

That Bloodline Awakening Pill was useless to him.

But the blood of the gods was of great use to him!

That is the blood of the low-grade gods!

At the moment, he said with a smile: "I finally understand when I see these two treasures, why the ancestor of Beiming didn't rush to drop blood to recognize the master."

"Dad, why?"

Xiaojumang's face was full of curiosity.

The fission body smiled and said, "Battle pet spirit eggs have extremely high requirements on the quality of blood essence! Feeding them with high-quality essence and blood can make them evolve. Feeding with low-quality essence and blood will make them degenerate."

Feng Xi's eyes lit up: "My concubine understands! Although Old Ancestor Beiming is a true **** in the early stage, his blood essence is at the most low-level god-level."

"Using his blood essence to feed the Gonggong Spiritual Egg, there is a certain chance that the Gonggong Spiritual Egg will degenerate from the peak of the low-grade **** rank to the low-grade **** rank."

"Ancestor Beiming was worried that such a thing would happen, so he tried to improve the quality of his blood essence. The fastest way to improve his blood essence is to acquire a bloodline talent."

"That's why he prepared this Bloodline Awakening Pill and this drop of the blood of the gods! It's a pity that he died before he could improve the quality of his blood essence."

As soon as these words came out, Qi Yue suddenly realized.

"So this is ah!"

"Hee hee! This just happens to be cheap, Dad!"

Afterwards, Xiao Luan'er said happily: "Dad, you have awakened the SSS-level bloodline talent. The quality of blood essence is much higher than that of the true god, and it is comparable to the level of the main god. You feed this Gonggong spirit egg, you will definitely make it Evolution!"

Qiyue also said: "Yes! Master, hurry up and recognize the master! This little guy will definitely evolve immediately. Under your feeding, Di Jiang has evolved to the peak of the mid-grade god-level."

The fission body smiled: "I have this plan!"

As soon as the voice fell, he was divided into two, and he became two fission variants again.

Then, one of the fission bodies picked up the blood of the gods to refine it.

The remaining fission body began to break the fingers and blood.

In the next second, a drop of fragrant blood essence condensed out of the fingertips.

Feng Xi's three daughters and Xiao Jumang couldn't help holding their breaths, watching nervously.

Snapped!

That fiery red blood essence dripped on the eggshell!

In the next second, the spirit egg sucked out the blood essence at a speed visible to the naked eye.

hum!

Immediately afterwards, the spirit egg emitted a dazzling white light and released a joyful mental wave.

At that moment, there was telepathy between the fission body and the spirit egg, as if a soul contract had been signed.

At the same time, Tiandao also sent a reminder

„ÄêCongratulations on your successful recognition of the Lord! The Gonggong Spirit Egg has recognized you as the master! „Äë

call! It worked!

The fission body breathed a sigh of relief, and was quite happy in his heart.

With this spirit egg, he will have another powerful subordinate!

"Dad! Dad! Did you succeed in recognizing the Lord?"

Xiaojumang asked impatiently.

The fission body smiled and nodded: "I succeeded in recognizing the master!"

"Dad, why didn't this spiritual egg evolve?"

Xiaojumang was a little anxious.

He naturally hopes that his future younger brother is as strong as himself.

"Yes! Master, why hasn't this spirit egg evolved?"

Feng Xi looked puzzled.

Xiaoluan'er and Qiyue frowned slightly.

hum! hum! hum!

At this moment, the spirit egg made a vibrating sound again, as well as strong mental fluctuations, as if it was longing for something.

The fission body instantly understood its thoughts.

It turns out that the little guy needs blood!

One drop is not enough!

At the moment, he squeezed out a drop of blood essence again and dripped it into the spirit egg.

Snapped!

Another soft sound!

The fragrant blood essence dripped onto the white eggshell of Gonggongling's egg.

Silk! Silk! Silk!

Soon, the egg will completely absorb the second drop of blood essence.

But it still shows no signs of evolution!G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

This time, even the fission body frowned slightly, feeling puzzled.

With the quality of his blood essence, even Dijiang Spirit Eggs can be cultivated to the pinnacle of the mid-grade **** rank.

Why has the Gonggong Spirit Egg absorbed two drops in a row, yet there is no change?

hum! hum! hum!

Before waiting for the fission body to think about it, the spirit egg rang again eagerly, sending out the spiritual thought of thirst for blood essence, which seemed very urgent.

The fission body did not hesitate, and squeezed out a drop again

Snapped!

The third drop of blood essence dripped onto the spirit egg.

Silk! Silk! Silk!

Soon, the third drop of blood essence was also absorbed.

hum!

The spirit egg finally gave out a joyful and satisfying roar, no longer thirsting for blood and essence

click! click! click!

Immediately afterwards, there were bursts of light noises on the eggshell!

A brand-new innate divine pattern slowly appeared on it, exuding an astonishing breath!

At the same time, its breath began to soar

Tiandao also came with a prompt.

[Reminder: Your pet 'Gonggong Spirit Egg' is evolving]

„ÄêSuccessful evolution! The Gonggong Spirit Egg has been promoted from the 'low-grade god-rank peak' level to the "middle-grade god-rank" level. „Äë

call!

Finally evolved!

The fission body let out a long sigh of relief and showed a relieved smile.

"Wow! Dad! Dad! My brother has finally evolved successfully!"

Xiaojumang cheered happily.

Feng Xi's three daughters also smiled.

But before they are happy, the mutation will regenerate!

click! click! click!

I saw that on the eggshell, just after the formation of an innate divine pattern, a second innate divine pattern began to be formed.

The breath of the spirit egg also soared wildly again!

[Reminder: Your pet 'Gonggong Spirit Egg' is evolving]

„ÄêSuccessful evolution! The Gonggong Spirit Egg has been promoted from the 'middle-grade **** rank' level to the 'mid-grade **** rank peak' level. „Äë

what!
