Afterwards, I saw half a mysterious purple air slowly falling down the beam of light.

Qin Feng couldn't help but look at that Ziqi!

In the next second, a look of astonishment appeared in his eyes!

That half of the mysterious purple qi was exactly the half-cluster of Hongmeng purple qi he wanted!

hum~~!

In just a moment, that half of the primordial purple energy merged into the body of the dual-phase **** at a speed visible to the naked eye!

The dual-phase supernatural powers released purple light, and the momentum soared again. In a blink of an eye, it reached 5 trillion stars, which has completely surpassed Qin Feng's basic combat power, which is extremely terrifying!

Seeing this scene, Qin Feng's heart was also suddenly shocked!

Before, he thought that in the chance treasure box (Dao level), in addition to the Dao level chance order, another hidden Tao level treasure was the half-clump of Hongmeng Purple Qi.

Now it seems that it is something else!

When this was understood, Qin Feng's eyes lit up, not surprised but delighted.

That is to say, in addition to harvesting half a group of Hongmeng purple energy, he can also obtain another Dao-level treasure!

However, the basic combat power of this dual-phase **** has reached 5 trillion stars!

It is extremely difficult to kill it within 1 minute!

If you want to kill it within 10 seconds, the possibility is even more slim!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng couldn't help but take a deep breath.

No matter whether it works or not, he has to fight with all his strength, which is in line with his character!

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, the voice of heaven echoed in the void!

[Challenge reminder: The full state of the "bipolar god" has appeared! The goal of the contestants is to destroy the 'bi-phase god'! „Äë

[After 10 seconds, start the challenge! Please be prepared for both! „Äë

„ÄêCountdown: 19„Äë

Hearing the countdown, Qin Feng didn't dare to neglect, and quickly sacrificed two pieces of the avenue.

Chapter 961 Challenge to break the level! Supreme title!

Click~! Click~! Click~!

In just a split second, Qin Feng put on the Pantian Dao Armor and held the Pantian Dao Axe in his hand!

In an instant, the integration of human and machine was completed, and the momentum skyrocketed to 3.37 trillion stars!

Boom~!

Immediately after that, his whole body was full of golden light, and his killing intent rose to the sky!

Seven Killing Divine Body! Instant explosion!

Qin Feng's momentum once again soared to 6.74 trillion stars!

In the next second, 210,000 times the power of luck is superimposed, and the momentum soars to 6.95 trillion stars again!

At this point, Qin Feng's preparations are over!

For the current combat power, he is already very satisfied!

You know, this is not his strongest state!

If Dijiang, Jumang, Houtu and others sacrificed their combat power, he would be able to increase his combat power by another 600 million stars!

At the same time, he can also use supernatural powers - Six Prisons to Suppress the Heavens!Alll ùíçùíÇtest novùíÜlùíî on novelbùíän/(.)cùíêm

It's a pity that he can't find help for such a task challenge!

What's more, Di Jiang, Jumang and others are also participating in the main **** assessment.

Can't use 'Six Prisons to Suppress the Sky', Qin Feng's attack power will be greatly reduced!

He wants to kill the biphasic **** within 10 seconds, it will be very difficult!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng raised his head and looked at the dual-phase god

At this time, the dual-phase **** is also looking at him, and the two sides are facing each other!

At this moment, in the four pupils of the dual-phase god, there is a cold and wise light flashing!

After this fusion is completed, its intelligence has obviously become extremely high

At this moment, it is looking at Qin Feng coldly, and there is also fear in the depths of its eyes!

The aura of this human has increased to 69,500 in just two seconds, which is 1.95 trillion more combat power than it!

This is indeed an extremely formidable opponent!

However, its mission goal is to stick to 1 minute!

It is absolutely impossible to destroy it in 1 minute with a combat power that is only 1.95 trillion higher than it!

Don't say 1 minute, even 10 minutes can't do it!

It seems that this round of guardianship challenge, it is destined to win!

At this thought, the four eyes of the dual-phase **** all showed a look of pride!

It thought it had won!

It doesn't know that Qin Feng's goal is not to kill it within 1 minute, but to kill it within 10 seconds!

At this moment, Tiandao sent a reminder.

„ÄêCountdown is over! The challenge is on! start the timer:„Äë

Boom~!

As soon as the prompt came out, Qin Feng suddenly broke out and went straight to the biphasic god.

In the blink of an eye, he killed the biphasic god!

But without waiting for him to make a move, the dual-phase **** slammed into the shot!

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

The dual-phase **** four fists blasted out at the same time, and the monstrous weather broke out instantly!

The momentum of that punch has reached 15 trillion stars, which is three times its basic combat power, far stronger than those extraterrestrial demons!

Obviously, there is no chaotic fog on the tenth floor, and there is no suppression of the attack on the dual-phase god!

What is even more terrifying is that the biphasic **** has two heads and four arms!

Four fists attacked at the same time, and the momentum was linked together!

Its power is superimposed layer by layer, and it is comparable to a 17 trillion star strike, which is extremely terrifying!

Click~! Click~! Click~!

In the blink of an eye, four punches are approaching!

Wherever his fist style passes, the void boundary wall is broken, and the Dao Law collapses!

Qin Fengtong's eyes narrowed, and he suddenly shot!

Swish~!

Holding the handle of the axe in both hands, he slammed the axe and slashed forward!

Om~!

At that moment, Pan Tian Dao Axe and Pan Tian Dao Armor all lit up with dazzling Dao light!

The two great weapon skills were launched, and the attack increase soared by 150%!

A critical strike was also launched at the same time, and the attack was increased to 25% again!

The axe's attack momentum instantly reached about 24.3 trillion stars, and its power was terrifying to the extreme!

Biphasic eyes are horrified!

The attack of this human being is so strong!

However, it soon calmed down!

Even if this human attack is stronger, it is 7 trillion stars higher than it, and there is no absolute advantage!

It is absolutely impossible to kill it in 1 minute!

With this thought in mind, it went all out to meet Qin Feng's attack and hit it head-to-head.

It's also about to fight!

Boom~Long~Long~!

At that moment, the double-phase god's attack speed accelerated, and the monstrous fist wind rumbled!

Seeing that the two sides attacked to collide!

Qin Feng's wrist slanted, avoiding the attack of the four punches, and slashing the waist of the dual-phase god!

As a result, his chest was exposed, and he directly faced the terrifying four punches!

Such a change made the bi-phase **** stunned!

Immediately, it wants to understand!

This human is so crazy!

He actually gave up the defense and wanted to have an injury swap with it!

This is a kind of quick-fight, quick-decision, and perishing style of play!

The sudden change caught the bipolar **** by surprise.

However, it quickly calmed down.

Although the attack of this human being is extremely strong, the defense is not necessarily strong!

After all, the momentum he had erupted before was less than 7 trillion, and there is a 90% probability that it can't stop its four punches!

Since it is going to perish together, it will accompany it!

The big deal is to compete for resurrection ability!

What's more, it has two soul bodies, and its resurrection ability is extremely strong!

Boom~Long~Long~!

Thinking of this, the dual-phase god's eyes were ferocious, and the four fists slammed into Qin Feng with great ferocity...

It's going to blast this human being!

It wants him to know what a foolish choice it is to choose to die with it!

Swah~~!

At the same moment, Qin Feng's axe light also swept across the sky, slashing down frantically!

He wants to solve the battle in 10 seconds, but he can only use this kind of perishing style of play.

Otherwise, he has no hope of solving the battle within 10 seconds!

In the blink of an eye, both attacks fell at the same time!

Kacha~!

Bang~! Bang~! Bang~! Bang~!

A crisp sound!

Mixed with four muffled sounds!

Qin Feng cut off the dual-phase **** with one axe!

There was blood in the field!

At the same moment, he was also hit in the chest by those four punches.
