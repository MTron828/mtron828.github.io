At this moment, the voice of the ancestor of Beiming resounded in the field!

"Reincarnation Daoist friend! This old man is here to help you!"

boom!

In the next second, he entered the battle circle!

His addition made Qin Feng, who was already at a disadvantage, even more precarious.

Seeing the change in this scene, the old lady Baihe and the others lit up, as if they saw hope again!

The ancestors of reincarnation are also full of surprises, secretly thinking that there is hope to kill Qin Feng!

In this way, Old Ancestor Samsara and Old Ancestor Beiming joined forces again and attacked Qin Feng frantically.

This time, Qin Feng is completely below, and the situation is getting worse and worse

0

It's just that everyone in the field didn't know that there was a change in another place.

That's zero-degree space!

At this moment, in the zero-degree space, the cultivation secret room.

Xiao Luan'er has taken the lead in adding points, and her combat power has skyrocketed to 1.7 million stars.

Immediately afterwards, Feng Xi also finished adding points, and her combat power skyrocketed to 1.9 million stars!Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

After Jumang finished adding points, his combat power soared to 3 million stars!

In addition, Qiyue has been retreating in the zero-degree space for this period of time.

In order to prevent her from losing her combat power, Qin Feng rewarded her with a large number of eighth-order and ninth-order elixir.

In the storage rings of the old monsters, such as the ancestors of the white devil and the ancestors of Baili, some medicinal pills that Qin Feng could not use were all given to Qiyue!

As a result, Qiyue's combat power has also increased to 1.4 million stars!

Now, the combined combat power of the four is 8 million stars, which can sacrifice 5.6 million star combat power to Qin Feng.

In addition, the Mirage, Wood Spirit, and Ice Spirit clones are also ready for sneak attacks!

Boom!

At this moment, the fission body finally finished adding points.

After adding 140 million attribute points, Qin Feng's combat power has skyrocketed by 2.8 million stars, and his strength has greatly increased again!

"Finally finished!"

The fission body finally breathed a sigh of relief!

Then, he looked at Feng Xi's third daughter and Jumang, and was about to speak.

At this moment, Tiandao sent a reminder.

[Longyuan Announcement: Liu Xuan (the lord) recruited Qingchengzi into Longyuan City and the Longyuan population increased by +1]

[Longyuan Announcement: Grandma Fengqi (Human Lord) recruited Wang Keng into Longyuan City, and the population of Longyuan increased by +1]

[Longyuan Announcement: Qishan is dirty (Holy Lord) will recruit Li Ming into Longyuan City, and the population of Longyuan will increase by +1]

what! This is

This sudden change made the fission body stunned.

Feng Xi and the others were also stunned for a while.

Immediately, several people responded.

Feng Xi said in surprise: "Master, Liu Xuan and the others are recruiting Qingchengzi and others. The Wuzhuangguan should be merged into our Longyuan City!"

Xiao Luan'er was overjoyed: "Wow! This is great! The integration of Wuzhuangguan into our Longyuan City will increase our population by 10,000 people. This will be of great help to our later upgrades!"

The fission body also smiled: "Yeah! If we want to upgrade Longyuan City to Longyuan Sanctuary in the future, we need to upgrade to level 13 Longyuan City first."

"But the more you upgrade, the more population you need. I'm worrying about how to increase the population. Liu Xuan and the others have solved a problem for me! I don't know how they persuaded Qingchengzi to join us?"

Feng Xi smiled and said: "No matter what the reason is, it is definitely a good thing that Wuzhuangguan agreed to be merged with us!"

"By the way, Dad! Our Longyuan will be promoted to level 11 soon. There are only 5 titles left now. When are you going to award five more titles, then you can level up!"

Xiao Luan'er suddenly remembered the promotion of the town and hurriedly reminded.

The fission body nodded slightly: "We'll talk about this later! Right now, the battle situation outside is critical! The four of you hurry up and prepare, I'm going to fight back soon!"

"Oh!"

Xiao Luan'er responded and hurriedly sat cross-legged, ready to sacrifice her combat power.

Feng Xi and Qi Yue did not dare to neglect, they all made preparations

Jumang followed suit, learning to sit cross-legged.

It was the first time he offered sacrifices, and he was a little unfamiliar!

In this way, in the zero-degree space, everything has been prepared.

At the same time, the battle in the outside world has undergone tremendous changes.

However, he said that the reincarnation ancestor and the Beiming ancestor joined forces, and they had the absolute upper hand, killing Qin Feng.

Who would have thought that Qin Feng's combat power suddenly soared, increasing by 2.8 million stars in an instant.

As a result, Qin Feng's comprehensive combat power has reached 30.9 million stars, just reaching the threshold of the true god's peak.

Such a huge change surprised the two of Samsara!

They simply can't understand!

Only in this way, Qin Feng is no longer as embarrassed as before, and has a tendency to return to light!

This makes the reincarnation ancestor in a hurry!

If this goes on, how can he kill Qin Feng?

Old Ancestor Beiming was also anxious.

Suddenly, he seemed to have made up his mind and roared!

"Little thief! So far, this old man will let you see, the old man's trump card!"

As soon as the voice fell, the ancestor of Beiming took out a faint blue spirit bead from the storage ring.

Qin Feng was stunned!

He was about to strike back with a jedi, a thunderous strike!

Unexpectedly, the ancestor of Beiming had to use his trump card first.

Chapter 619 Kill Beiming! The door of reincarnation!

However, as soon as the ancestor of Beiming took out the blue spirit bead, he immediately pinched the seal.

hum!

After a while, the spirit bead roared, and the rays of light shined!

Immediately afterwards, an incomparably mysterious golden rune appeared in the Lingzhu, exuding the power of the supreme Lord God!

What's even more amazing is that the golden rune comes with thirteen rays of brilliance!

"Hey! This is"

Seeing this scene, the reincarnation ancestor was very surprised!

Qin Feng was also terrified, thinking that it was not good.

It turned out that the divine artifact with its eleven brilliance was a low-grade god, corresponding to the virtual **** realm.

The twelve brilliance are of the middle grade **** level, corresponding to the true **** realm!

The thirteen brilliance is the high-grade **** level, which corresponds to the main **** realm!

The golden rune in this blue spirit bead exudes thirteen rays of brilliance, and it is clearly a high-grade god-level treasure!

Top-grade god-level things!

The power is enormous!

Qin Feng suddenly felt bad!

"Little thief! Go to hell!"

It was at this moment that the ancestor of Beiming threw the Lingzhu at Qin Feng.

call out!

In the blink of an eye, the Spirit Orb arrived in front of you!

Qin Feng was frightened and had to avoid it!

But at this moment, the ancestor of Beiming had a thought and controlled the spirit bead.

click! click! click!

A little noise!

Lingzhu automatically cracks!

Suddenly, the rune in the bead released a lot of spiritual light, and the monstrous cold air burst out in an instant!

click! click! click!

As soon as the cold air came out, it emitted an invisible force field, imprisoning it for a hundred miles!

Qin Feng sensed in an instant that the surrounding space was imprisoned and could not be teleported.

In this way, he can't avoid that Spirit Orb!

This made him anxious!

Bang!

At this moment, the Spirit Orb burst into pieces, revealing the golden runes inside!

hum!

The golden rune, the aura skyrocketed, and was rapidly dissolving!

It's releasing monstrous energy!

At that moment, the power of the cold air increased tenfold!

click! click! click!

Wherever the cold air passes, all time and space, soul, and Dao laws are frozen!

That energy seems to be able to freeze everything!

Seeing this scene, the ancestor of Beiming was extremely excited.

But seeing the golden runes that were melting, he felt a little pain in the flesh again!

It turned out that a high-grade god-level skill was sealed in the blue spirit bead‚Äîabsolutely frozen!

When the golden runes are melted, it is time to release the skills!

This is a one-time consumable, the value is extremely expensive, comparable to a low-quality artifact.

Once used, it means that a low-grade artifact is gone.

How could the ancestor of Beiming not be hurt? !

But in order to deal with Qin Feng, he had to reluctantly use it.

click! click! click!

At that moment, the power of ice came to Qin Feng, covering the sky and the sun, and there was no way to avoid it!

Qin Feng sensed in horror that the frozen power was extremely terrifying!

If he is infected, he will definitely be frozen in an instant, and even his soul will be frozen!
