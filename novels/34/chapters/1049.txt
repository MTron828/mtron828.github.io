Urban Oasis

He hurriedly looked around and found that he had entered a huge shrine with a wall of hundreds of millions of feet.

And he stood in the center of the hall, like an ant, appearing above the human hall, looking extraordinarily small.

Qin Feng couldn't help but take a deep breath, looked up and looked forward...

There are thirteen giant altars there!

The altar in the center is dedicated to an axe that lifts the sky. It is tens of thousands of meters long, and the whole body is full of rays of light.

Qin Feng felt a shocking sense of oppression just by looking at it.

Looking at both sides of the central altar, there are six altars each.

On each altar, there is a giant divine armor with a height of one million zhang, with different colors and extraordinary imposing manners.

Qin Feng was amazed!

These twelve armors and the divine axe should be the treasures in this treasure house!

Immediately, he peeped towards the divine axe in the center...

[Pantian Divine Axe: Innate Divine Artifact, Peak Fortune Level]

[You need to master the 'Creation Avenue' and the 'Open Heaven Avenue' to refine it]

[Reminder: After refining, you can get 2 billion star power back! „Äë

Boom~!

After reading the prompt, Qin Feng was shocked!

Oh my God!

The divine power of 2 billion stars is fed back!

This is too exaggerated!

No wonder, this divine axe is the existence of the pinnacle of creation!

At this thought, Qin Feng was excited, and the eyes looking at the "Pantian Divine Axe" became extremely hot!

If he can get this divine axe, he will be able to fight against the threshold of the divine king right away!

However, the Pantian Divine Axe is not easy to refine!

It actually needs to master the 'Creation Avenue' and the 'Opening Avenue' before it can be refined!

Creation Avenue, one of the innate avenues!

Qin Feng already has the 'Road of Creation' scroll, and his mind body has been comprehending.

Kaitian Avenue, one of the Houtian Avenues, was derived from the S-level Kaitian Law.

The power of the acquired avenue is far inferior to the innate avenue.

However, the 'Open Heaven Avenue' ranks in the top 100 of the 2,950 Acquired Avenues!

The Houtian Dao that can enter the top 100 is equivalent to half of the Innate Dao, much stronger than other acquired Dao, and it is much more difficult to comprehend the Dao.

Qin Feng didn't grasp this 'Open Heaven Avenue' either.

However, none of this matters!

As long as he gets the 'Pantian Divine Axe', he can slowly understand the Dao in the future!

Besides, he already owns the 'Avenue of Creation' scroll, and it is only a matter of time before he realizes the Dao of Creation.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng looked to the left again, the first altar next to the 'Pantian Divine Axe'.

On it is a black divine armor, which is as high as a million feet, with divine light and extraordinary aura!

[Shitian Divine Armor: Innate Divine Artifact, Good Fortune Grade]

[It is necessary to master the 'Avenue of Time' before refining it]

[Reminder: After refining, you can get 200 million star divine power back! „Äë

hiss~!

Qin Feng couldn't help but take a deep breath!

This is also a god-level armor of good fortune!

However, it needs to master the avenue of time before it can be refined.

Time Avenue, that is also one of the top 100 Houtian Avenues.

Qin Feng did not grasp it either.

Then, he looked to the right, the first altar next to the 'Pantian Divine Axe'

On it is a white divine armor, which is as high as a million zhang, with a whole body of divine light and an extraordinary breath!

[Sky God Armor: Innate Artifact, Creation Grade]

[You need to master the 'Space Avenue' to refine it]

[Reminder: After refining, you can get 200 million star divine power back! „Äë

Another good fortune-level divine armor!

But you need to master the 'Space Avenue' in order to refine it.

'Space Avenue' is also the top 100 Houtian Avenue.

Qin Feng continued to watch...

Wind **** armor, thunder **** armor, fire **** armor, water **** armor, earth **** armor, wood **** armor, golden **** armor, cold sky **** armor, Mingtian **** armor, destiny **** armor.

The remaining ten divine armors are all innate artifacts of the fortune-class level. After refining, they can feed back 200 million star-level divine powers, all of which are extraordinary!

However, they all need to master an acquired avenue before they can be refined!

Qin Feng is more and more moved!

Any treasure here, if he can get it, it will make a lot of money!

So far, he still does not have a fortune-level innate artifact!

That 'Cause God Monument' is a divine object, not an artifact!

At this moment, the sky above the hall suddenly changed.

I saw that space, shaking strangely!

Then, a huge human-shaped light and shadow slowly emerged!

The light and shadow are ten thousand feet tall, and the whole body is white light, as if there is no entity, just a group of rays of light gathered together!

Looking at his eyes again, there is a dim green light, and he is staring at Qin Feng, looking very cold!

And the aura he exudes is also extremely extraordinary!

Qin Feng was startled, and hurriedly peeped towards the humanoid light and shadow...

[Evil Object]: The Spirit of Guarding the Temple

[Combat Strength]: 2 billion stars

[Characteristics]: Control the artifact of good fortune, absolutely guard

"It turned out to be the spirit of guarding the temple!"

Qin Feng was stunned!

At the same time, the spirit of guarding the temple was also looking at Qin Feng.

After a while, green light flashed in its eyes, showing disdain.

Qin Feng was stunned!

This guy doesn't look better than him!

Even if his spiritual power is sealed, he still has a 2.1 billion star combat power!

Why is this guy so arrogant?

Before Qin Feng could think about it, the spirit of guarding the temple waved to the twelve gods below!

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

Suddenly, the twelve innate **** armors rose to 3.5 in the sky, and took the initiative to gather together and begin to merge...

Click~! Click~! Click~!

In just a moment, the twelve innate **** armors merged into one, and turned into a majestic super **** armor, which was as high as ten million feet, exuding a shocking aura!

Qin Feng was stunned and quickly peeped...ùëÖread latest chùíÇpters at n/ùíêv(e)lbiùíè(.)co/m

[Pantian Divine Armor: Innate Divine Artifact, Peak Fortune Grade]

[It is necessary to master the twelve acquired avenues of time, space, wind, and thunder before refining them]

[Reminder: After refining, you can get 2.4 billion star power back! „Äë

Boom~!

Qin Feng was shocked and shocked!

hiss~!

Another artifact at the pinnacle of fortune!

It turns out that after the fusion of the twelve innate **** armors, you can get a **** armor of the pinnacle of fortune!

The divine power of its feedback has reached 2.4 billion stars, which is even stronger than the Pantian God Axe!

Qin Feng is more and more moved!

At this moment, the spirit of guarding the temple beckoned again, and the Pantian Divine Armor and Pantian Divine Axe took the initiative to fly towards it...

Click~! Click~! Click~!

In just an instant, the spirit guarding the temple put on divine armor and a divine axe.

Its momentum has soared wildly, and it has reached 6.4 billion stars in a blink of an eye!

That monstrous divine might instantly filled the entire temple, and also enveloped Qin Feng...

Qin Feng suddenly felt bad!

At this moment, Tiandao sent a reminder...

Chapter 784: The Shocking Challenge! One hit kill!

Qin Feng suddenly felt bad!

At this moment, Tiandao sent a reminder...

[Welcome player Qin Feng to the treasure house of Shenjia, you have activated the chance challenge]

[Challenge content: Kill the spirit of guarding the temple! After the kill is successful, you can get all the treasures in the treasury]

[Reminder: Your residence time in the treasury is 3 seconds, that is, the time between you and the spirit of guarding the temple should not exceed 3 seconds]

[Reminder: If you fail to kill the spirit of the temple within the timeout period, it will be regarded as a failure of the challenge and you will lose the qualification to obtain the treasure]

[Reminder: The thirteen artifacts in this treasure house are all unique in the universe. If the player successfully obtains the treasure, this treasure house opportunity will no longer appear]

„ÄêChallenge is about to start, countdown: 5‚Ä¶ „Äë

Qin Feng was surprised and delighted!

This kind of opportunity, in the universe, is the only one!

He must seize the opportunity!

However, the battle power of this guardian spirit has reached 6.4 billion stars. How can this be killed?

On the other hand, after the spirit of guarding the temple and the divine weapon are united, their confidence is greatly increased!

At this moment, it looked at Qin Feng with contempt and excitement.

It's been so many years!

It finally waited for a human.
