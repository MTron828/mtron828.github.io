A crisp sound!

Blood splashes!

Before the Bull Demon King could react, the fission body split his axe into two halves, and he didn't even have time to let out a scream!

In the next second, a white light flew from the corpse of the cow and poured into the body of the fission body...

[You successfully killed the Great Bull Demon King (Lord God Limit), and obtained +120 trillion energy points]

[You successfully killed the Great Bull Demon King (Lord God Limit) and obtained +430 Golden Judgment Points]

[You successfully killed the Great Bull Demon King (Lord God Limit), and a Dao Crystal Fragment (Power) exploded]

Another Dao Crystal Shard is in hand!

It's so easy!

This is the most precious resource in the secret realm!

As soon as the fission body waved its hand, it happily took the Dao Crystal fragment into its hand...

Om~!

At this moment, the upgraded white light lit up on him again...

[Your vocation is promoted to Level 71 Judgment Supreme (Advanced)]

The vocation has been upgraded again!

Fission is very satisfied!

In the big world outside, he can't get judgment points, but in these secret realms, he can provide a lot of judgment points!

This is a rare opportunity!

The fission body satisfactorily put away the Dao crystal fragments, and is ready to find a new target...

"Huh~! That's '"‚Ä¶"

Suddenly, his heart moved, and he raised his eyes to look somewhere.

His divine sense scanned it, and in that direction, two early-stage master **** players were searching for resources while on their way.

One of them was the most active one who mocked him before!

What a coincidence!

Since he met him, he couldn't let it go!

The fission body smiled coldly, the light flashed in his hand, the giant axe disappeared, and it was replaced by a divine sword, which was the divine sword of fate!

Heavenly Fate Divine Sword, killing targets above the main **** realm can **** all their luck!

Qin Feng not only wanted to kill those ignorant guys, but also let them leave some precious things and teach them a painful lesson.

Thinking of this, the fission body flashed and quietly rushed over...

At the same time, in a jungle.

The two players from the early stage of the main **** were on their way while nervously guarding their surroundings.

In this main **** zone, with the strength of their main **** in the early stage, it can be said that there are dangers.

After all, the weakest guardian beast of the secret realm here has reached the initial stage of the main god.

To this end, these two have to work together!

With only one person's strength, they can't kill the guardian beast!

Not to mention killing guardian beasts, even killing resource beasts would be very difficult.

It turns out that many resource places are also guarded by fierce beasts, and their strengths range from the real **** realm to the main **** realm.

Just now, the two discovered a resource point for a mid-grade god-level spiritual fruit, and they encountered a resource beast with the limit of a true god.

The two killed the resource beast, and each got three spiritual fruits.

It can be seen that there are many resources in constipation, and it is not so easy to obtain.

The more precious the resource, the stronger the resource beast it guards.

Of course, there are occasionally some resource points, and there are no beasts guarding them, so it all depends on luck.

"Brother Meow, the spiritual fruit I harvested just now is pretty good!"

The one who spoke was the white-faced man among the two!

He was wearing a purple robe and had an extraordinary temperament.

This white-faced man was named Zi Xuan, and he was one of the people who mocked Ji Yang's body before.

This time, the fission body spied on him and came directly.

It's just that this guy doesn't know yet, the crisis is quietly approaching!

"Yeah! That dragon force fruit can strengthen the physical body, trap the body and cultivate vitality. It is indeed a good mid-grade god-level spiritual fruit."

The other player nodded again and again with a satisfied smile on his face.

This player is an old man named Wei You, who has ridiculed Ji Yang's body before.

At this time, Zi Xuan sighed again: "This secret realm of the main **** zone is really rich in resources! You and I found a resource point in less than five minutes. The only regret is that the guardian beasts of the secret realm here are too strong. "

"The two guardian beasts we encountered in a row were all in the middle stage of the Lord God! If we hadn't escaped quickly, the situation would have been critical!"

Meanyou nodded slightly: "Indeed! There are many dangers here! We must be careful and look for the guardian beast in the early days of the main god, so that we can get a chance to get a Dao crystal fragment."

Zixuan said again: "It is rumored that these guardian beasts in the secret realm, the lower the realm, the lower the explosion rate. I don't know how many guardian beasts we have to kill in the early days of the main **** to earn enough points!"

Meanyou also sighed: "Yeah! Everyone must earn more than 3 points to avoid being eliminated! Although this opportunity is good, it is too difficult to earn points! However, we have five hours, It should be in time!"

Zi Xuan nodded: "." That's true! By the way, I suddenly remembered the white-haired boy from before! With his mere False God realm cultivation, he even dared to break into the main **** zone. Isn't this courting death?"

Meanyou also sneered: "That's just a clown! The resource beasts in the main **** zone are the weakest and have the strength of the initial stage of the true gods. With that kid's strength, if you encounter resource beasts, you will die, let alone encounter guardian beasts! "

Zi Xuan smiled gleefully: "So, he came here for nothing!"

Mean You also smiled and said, "That's what he asked for!"

But these words only fell, a light and shadow flashed in front, and a figure appeared out of thin air, blocking the way of the two!

"It's you!"

The two hurriedly looked at the person coming, and suddenly exclaimed!

The person here is none other than a fission!

In the next second, the two of Meanyou reacted and immediately became excited.

"Haha! Boy! The deity was thinking just now, did you die, but I didn't expect you to be alive. In this case, the deity will let you die..."

As soon as the voice fell, Zi Xuan wanted to do something to the fission body.

"Haha! And the old man!"

With a wicked laugh, you also want to make a move together!

Swish~!

But at this moment, the cold light flashed!

Kacha~! Kacha~!

Two consecutive beeps!

Blood splashes!

Two huge heads soared into the sky!

With just one sword, the fission body made Zixuan and Zixuan's heads in different places!

Before dying, the heads of the two Zi Xuan were still spinning in the air!

They only felt that the world was spinning, and their eyes were full of fear!

They couldn't believe until they died that a False God player had such terrifying strength!

The sword was so fast that they couldn't even react!

What is even more terrifying is that the power of that sword not only cut off their heads, but also shattered their souls!

Bang~! Bang~!

In the next second, their eyes went black, their heads shattered, and they were completely dead!

Om~!

At this moment, the divine sword of luck in the hands of the fission body lit up with a faint aura...

[Reminder: You killed the player ‚ÄòZi Xuan‚Äô and got +1 sin value]

[Reminder: You killed the player 'Meanyou' and got +1 sin value]

[Reminder: Your Heavenly Fate Divine Sword absorbs all the luck of 'Zixuan', and your luck value is +6 times]

[Reminder: Your Heavenly Fate Divine Sword absorbs all the luck of 'Wangyou', and your luck value is +7 times]

Huh~!

Really!

The fission body's eyes lit up and there were many surprises!

Before that, he didn't know whether it was possible to absorb the luck of killing the main **** realm players in this secret realm.

After all, the players who died in the secret realm will be resurrected by Tiandao!

Now it seems that this resurrection is not perfect!

Although people are resurrected, their luck is gone!

That invisible loss is huge!

Fission body rejoice!R√™Ad latùôöSt chapters at n√¥(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He seems to have found a way to improve his luck.

Thinking of this, he looked up in another direction.

In that direction, there was a white-haired old man fighting against the guardian beast.

The old man also mocked the two main bodies before.

He smiled coldly and rushed over quietly...

Chapter 805 Special secret realm! unexpected surprise!

At the same moment, over a certain valley.

A white-haired old man is fighting fiercely in the air with a giant beast.

The giant beast bear-headed body, brown hair all over the body, has reached the peak of the main god.

The white-haired old man is also the pinnacle of the Lord God!

The two sides killed in the sky in the dark, the sun and the moon were dark.

For a time, neither of the two sides can do anything about the other!

Why are the guardian beasts in this secret territory so strong? !

It is a waste of effort to entangle with this giant beast.

It seemed that he had to give up the giant beast and find a weaker guardian beast.

Or find some companions and join forces with everyone.

Thinking of this, the white-haired old man somewhat retreated.

It would be nice if he had permission to enter the True God Zone, or the False God Zone.

Where the guardian beast is weaker, it is easier to obtain points.

Thinking of this, the old man was envious of low-level players.

At the same time, the extremely positive body and the extremely negative body appeared in his mind.
