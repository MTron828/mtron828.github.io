Before the words were finished, there was a burst of exclamations from the crowd!

"Hey! Look! What is that adult doing?!"

Everyone was alarmed and looked up, and saw Qin Feng stepped out and reached the entrance of the tenth pagoda!

Everyone was stunned!

The next second, the crowd is a commotion!

"Everyone! What is this lord going to do? Is he going to the tenth floor?!"

"Impossible! If you want to enter the tenth floor, you must first pass through the ninth floor! This adult has only been on the ninth floor for more than ten minutes, how can he enter the tenth floor?!"

Someone speaks out!

Everyone nodded their heads!

These guys all think that Qin Feng can't enter the tenth floor.

But at this moment, Qin Feng stepped forward!

huh~!

In the next second, his figure flashed, and he passed through the door of light and entered the tenth floor in full view!

Boom~!

This time, the audience was dumbfounded!

Everyone's mouth is open!

The field has become extremely quiet!

It was as if the air had frozen at that moment!

I don't know how long it took before everyone calmed down.

They looked at each other face to face, unable to speak for a while

At the same moment, inside the tenth floor of the Buddha.

Qin Feng looked around, and saw the vast sea of ‚Äã‚Äãclouds in front of him, and the fairy spirit curled up!

The sky is full of rays of light, boundless and incomparably sacred!

There is no chaotic fog in this tenth floor, but it is more like a fairyland!

Then, he looked up at the front

There is a white jade altar, no more than three feet high, on top of which is a black mysterious treasure chest.

As soon as Qin Feng's heart moved, he peeped towards the treasure chest.

[Chance Treasure Box (Dao Level): It contains a Tao-level chance order and a mysterious Tao-level treasure! „Äë

[Reminder: You need to complete the corresponding challenge before you can get this treasure chest! „Äë

Huh~!

There are actually two Taoist treasures hidden in this treasure chest!

Qin Feng's eyes suddenly lit up, and his heart was hot!

Such a treasure chest, he naturally wanted it!

However, the treasure chest was protected by the transparent mask held up by the altar, and it was not something you could get if you wanted to.

Tiandao also reminded that you need to complete the corresponding challenge to get it!

What is the challenge this time?

Boom~Long~Long~!

Just when this thought came to mind, a reminder came from Tiandao.

[Opportunity reminder: It was detected that the player 'Qin Feng' stepped into the tenth floor of the Buddha Tower, and successfully activated the challenge task on this floor! „Äë

[Challenge content: Kill the guardian spirit on this floor! „Äë

[Kill the target within one minute, you can get the chance treasure box (Dao level), and 20,000 merit points! „Äë

[Kill the target within 10 seconds, you can get the chance treasure box (Dao level), and 40,000 merit points, the player's 'Lord God's Rank Order' is promoted from Dao level to no superior! „Äë

[The Lord God's title order (no superior): The highest-rank Lord God's title in the Hongyuan universe is the only one in the universe and cannot be reproduced! „Äë

[Reminder: For the title of Lord God of rank five and above, when you are promoted to the title, you can get the Dao Awakening reward! „Äë

[The title of the fifth-rank master **** can awaken an acquired avenue! „Äë

[The title of the fourth-rank master **** can awaken 2 acquired avenues! „Äë

[Three-rank master **** title can awaken 3 acquired avenues! „Äë

[Second-rank master **** title, can awaken 4 acquired avenues! „Äë

[The title of the first-rank master **** can awaken 5 acquired avenues! „Äë

[The best master **** title can awaken 7 acquired avenues! „Äë

[The title of the Lord of Dao Pin, can awaken 10 acquired avenues and 1 innate avenue! „Äë

[Supreme Lord God's title can awaken 20 acquired avenues and 2 innate avenues! „Äë

Boom~!

After listening to the prompt, Qin Feng's eyes lit up!

Killing the mission target within 10 seconds has so many benefits!

Especially the 'Supreme Sovereign', which can awaken two innate avenues.

Looking at the reward content, I'm afraid that the increase in combat power obtained after being promoted to the main **** is twice as strong as that of the Taoist title!

No wonder the title of Supreme Lord is the only one in the universe and cannot be reproduced.

How could he miss such an opportunity? !

Qin Feng was completely moved.

This time, he must go all out to win this big opportunity!

Not to mention anything else, just kill the target within 10 seconds and get 40,000 merit points as a reward.

He killed all the extraterrestrial demons on the ninth floor, and the accumulated merit points were only 30,000 points!

"I don't know what the strength of this guardian spirit is?"

Qin Feng took a deep breath and looked around.

he is looking for a target

At this moment, near the altar in front, countless stars emerged out of thin air.

Then, those starlights converged into two groups!

After a while, a group transformed into an evil demon **** with a height of ten thousand feet, a snake-headed human body, and a corpse aura!

Another group also transformed into a towering demon **** with a height of ten thousand feet, a dragon-headed body, and a black mist rolling all over his body!

The momentum of the two demon gods is extremely terrifying

Qin Feng's heart moved, and he hurriedly spy on the demon **** with the snake head and the human body.

„ÄêEvil Spirit„Äë: Luxurious Corpse

[realm]: half-step eternal peak

[Combat Strength]: 3.7 trillion stars

[Characteristic]: Guardian Spirit on the tenth floor of the Buddha Tower

[Remarks]: The true spirit is damaged and its spirituality is incomplete. It was resurrected by the Heavenly Dao and is responsible for guarding the tenth floor of the Buddha Pagoda.

"Hey! It's actually a luxury than a corpse!"

After reading this, Qin Feng was a little stunned!

In the mythology of Longbi, the twelve ancestor witches are Dijiang, Jumang, Houtu, Tianwu, Gonggong, Zhurong, Qiangliang, Xizi, Xuanming, Jushou, Zhu Jiuyin, and Shebi corpse!

This luxury corpse is one of the twelve ancestor witches!

However, the above actually hints that his true spirit is damaged and his intelligence is incomplete!

Qin Feng's heart moved, and he looked at the eyes of the corpse. He saw that the green eyes were sometimes clear and bright, and sometimes confused.

This is the characteristic of the loss of intelligence!

Qin Feng feels a little weird!

However, even if this extravagant corpse's intelligence is damaged, its 3.7 trillion combat power should not be underestimated!

It's definitely not easy to kill it within 10 seconds!

After Qin Feng took a deep breath, he looked at the dragon-headed demon again.

[Evil Spirit]: Candle Jiuyin

[realm]: half-step eternal peak

[Combat Strength]: 3.9 trillion stars

[Characteristic]: Guardian Spirit on the tenth floor of the Buddha Tower

[Remarks]: The true spirit is damaged and its spirituality is incomplete. It was resurrected by the Heavenly Dao and is responsible for guarding the tenth floor of the Buddha Pagoda.

"Hey! It's Zhu Jiuyin! Another one appeared!"

Qin Feng was surprised again!

This is another Twelve Ancestral Witch!Alll ùíçùíÇtest novùíÜlùíî on novelbùíän/(.)cùíêm

The true spirit is also damaged, but the strength is stronger!

Of course, whether the extravagant corpse and Zhu Jiuyin in this world have anything to do with the Twelve Ancestral Witches in the myth of Longbi has always been a mystery in Qin Feng's heart!

But it is undeniable that the two must be related!

Long Bi is the blood descendant of the lord of this universe!

The Twelve Ancestors are also the blood ancestors of Longbi.

From this point of view, the Twelve Ancestral Witch and the Lord of the Universe must have a great relationship!

Then the Dijiang, Jumang, Houtu, Tianwu, Zhurong, and Gonggong that he accepted, would they be related to the two in front of him?

Countless thoughts flashed through Qin Feng's mind, and at the same time he looked up at Zhu Jiuyin.

I saw that his dark red eyes were sometimes clear and bright, and sometimes confused, which was also detrimental to his intelligence!

"Could it be that my challenge target is these two guardian spirits with damaged spiritual intelligence?"

Qin Feng just had this idea, and the field changed suddenly!

I saw that the corpse and Zhu Jiuyin suddenly gathered together, and they merged strangely!

Boom~Long~Long~!

In just a moment, the two two demon gods merged into one, turning into a ferocious demon **** with a height of one million feet, two heads and four arms, and a dragon scale body, and the momentum has soared a lot!

Qin Feng hurriedly spy on him

[Evil Spirit]: Bi-phase God

[realm]: half-step eternal peak

[Combat Strength]: 4.8 trillion stars

[Characteristic]: Guardian Spirit on the tenth floor of the Buddha Tower

[Remarks]: After Zhu Jiuyin and Shebi Corpse merged into a biphasic god, their intelligence reached a normal level.

Qin Feng was stunned!

Is that okay? !

Om~!

Before he could think about it, another white beam of light fell in the air, directly shrouding the dual-phase god.
