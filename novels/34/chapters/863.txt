In the crowd, Yu Xuanji was staring closely, and the half-page of the gods in Qin Feng's hands showed a look of astonishment!

"Patriarch, Lord Qin Feng actually killed the great power of the main **** realm!"

At this moment, behind Yu Xuanji, Granny Yusang's exclamation sounded.

Yu Xuanji did not respond.

Her attention was all attracted by the half page of the gods.

"Hey! Patriarch, what's wrong with you?"

Granny Yusang quickly discovered the abnormality.

At this time, Yu Xuanji came back to his senses and turned to look at Granny Yusang.

"Mother-in-law, have you seen it? The half of the **** page that Master Qin Feng got is exactly the same as the half of the **** page left by the ancestor!"

"what?!"

Granny Yusang was very surprised.

Then, she whispered: "Patriarch, the half of the **** page left by the ancestor, only the patriarchs of the past dynasties can know what it looks like, and the old body is not clear. Are you sure it is the same?"

Yu Xuanji took a deep breath and said, "I'm sure! The portrait of the **** page left by the ancestor is exactly the same as the **** page in the hands of Lord Qin Feng. As for whether the real thing is the same thing, it is not clear."

"After all, even I can't open the secret box left by the ancestor. According to the ancestor's legacy, only those who are in possession of the five directions of heaven can open it. I don't know Mr. Qin Feng...„ÄÖ"."

Halfway through the sentence, Yu Xuanji stopped.

It turned out that the Tiance Clan also treasured half of the divine page, which is very similar to the half of the divine page in Qin Feng's hands.

That was left by the ancestors of Tian Ce!

It has been hidden in a secret box and is under the control of the patriarchs of all dynasties.

Through the portraits, the patriarchs of all dynasties knew the appearance of the God Page, but they had never seen the real thing, because they could not open the secret box.

According to the legacy of the ancestors of Tiance, only those with special luck can open the secret box.G√©t latest ùíèovel chùíÇpters on nùíêv(e)lbj/n(.)c/ùíêm

At this time, Granny Yusang's eyes lit up: "Patriarch, do you want Lord Qin Feng to open that secret box?"

Yu Xuanji nodded slightly: "It's not impossible!"

Granny Yusang also nodded slightly.

But then, she worried again: "Patriarch, Lord Qin Feng's talent and strength are extremely strong, but he does not necessarily have the great luck of the Wufang Tiandao! The luck is illusory, it is obtained by chance, and it is not necessarily linked to strength!"

Yu Xuanji nodded slightly: "That's right! However, you have to give it a try! Maybe, Lord Qin Feng is the kind of person who has great luck? If he needs Xuanwu blood, I am also willing to help him!"

At the end, Yu Xuanji blushed inexplicably.

Granny Yusang was stunned for a moment, and there was a hint of surprise in her eyes.

But then, she also showed a knowing smile.

She understood that the patriarch really liked Lord Qin Feng, and even the most precious things a woman was willing to donate!

Just then, there was a commotion in the crowd.

"Look! City Lord Qin Feng is here!"

Hearing this, Yu Xuanji and the two quickly raised their heads and saw that Qin Feng had put away the half of the divine page and was walking towards this side.

Seeing this, everyone in Tiance looked nervous, and their expressions were a little uneasy, and their expressions were like seeing a big man!

Even Yu Xuanji took a deep breath with respect.

In this world of killing the heavens, the more powerful you are, the more respected you will be.

Qin Feng can kill even the powerhouse at the threshold level of the main god, how can they not be in awe of it!

Of course, Qin Feng killed God because he found God's weakness, and it was a bit of a trick.

But even so, Qin Feng's record is extremely amazing.

At least in this barren Blue Star Realm, no one has ever been able to reach half of him.

After a while, Qin Feng came to the square.

"My concubine has seen City Lord Qin!"

Yu Xuanji greeted him respectfully.

"I've been waiting to see the Qin City Lord!"

Tiance everyone also respectfully saluted.

"You are welcome!"

Qin Feng smiled slightly and looked at Yu Xuanji.

"Patriarch Jade, the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty and the beginning of the Taishi era have been wiped out. Our red camp is considered to have won this round of hegemony."

Yu Xuanji smiled and nodded: "That's true! Now, there are only some remnants of the eighth and tenth divisions left. By the way, City Lord Qin, what happened to the ancestors of the years and the ancestors of reincarnation?"

Yu Xuanji suddenly thought of this.

At the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, it was mentioned that the ancestors of the years and the ancestors of the reincarnation went after Qin Feng, but I don't know what happened.

Tiandao did not make any announcements either.

As soon as these words came out, everyone in the Tiance Clan showed concern.

Qin Feng smiled slightly: "The ancestors of the years and the ancestors of reincarnation have all been killed by me!"

As soon as these words fell, everyone breathed a sigh of relief, and they all showed joy.

Many more people muttered.

"Great! The ancestors of the years and the reincarnation have fallen, so we have no worries!"

"Yeah! If those two old monsters don't die, they will always be a big hidden danger!"

"Master Qin Feng is really strong! He can even kill the old ancestors of the years and the ancestors of reincarnation. The strength of those two people is stronger than that of ordinary true gods in the middle stage!"

"Nonsense! Lord Qin Feng has killed even the master of the **** realm. Isn't it easy to kill the two old ancestors?"

As soon as these words came out, everyone agreed, and they looked at Qin Feng with more respect!

At this time, Yu Xuanji also took a deep breath and said, "City Lord Qin, as soon as the old ancestors of the years and the ancestors of reincarnation die, we will have no hidden dangers."

"Next, we will destroy the remnants of the eighth and tenth divisions, and we will be able to completely win this round of hegemony!"

Qin Feng nodded with a smile: "Indeed! Next, I will arrange for the Long Yuan army and your Tiance clan to encircle and suppress those remnants together!"

Encircle the remnants!

For the ordinary children of the two races, it is a great opportunity!

Ten times the chance of reward, this is the only one left.

Yu Xuanji smiled: ".„ÄÉCity Lord Qin, before encircling the rest of the world, there is something I need to discuss with you about my concubine."

"What's the matter? Please tell me!"

"City Lord Qin, the concubine mentioned it to your avatar before. My clan will support you because of the prophecy left by the ancestors of our clan."

Qin Feng nodded slightly.

He was also quite curious about the prophecies of the ancestors of Tian Ce.

That's quite like the method in the pages of Future Books.

Yu Xuanji continued: "Actually, my ancestors still have a prophecy, that is, let all the children of the Tiance clan recognize you as the master. I wonder if Sir Qin Feng is willing to take us in?"

Qin Feng was surprised: "The noble ancestor still has this legacy?"

Yu Xuanji nodded: "It's true! I'm afraid Lord Qin Feng will not look down on our children!"

Speaking of this, Yu Xuanji's tone was a little uneasy.

The children of the Tiance clan were also anxious, for fear that Qin Feng would not be willing to take them in.

If it was before that, they would be somewhat resistant to recognizing Qin Feng as the master.

But now, they have been completely conquered by Qin Feng's strength, and they are willing to accept Qin Feng as the master.

Qin Feng smiled slightly: "As long as you are willing, I am willing to accept you!"

As soon as these words fell, the Tiance Clan all rejoiced.

Yu Xuanji was also overjoyed: "Lord Qin Feng, I am willing to wait. Please use your means and let me recognize you as the master!"

"Okay! If you recognize me as the master, your Heavenly Policy will be merged into my Longyuan City, and it will no longer be a separate strength."

"It's natural!"

"it is good!"

Qin Feng was also overjoyed.

If he wants to upgrade Longyuan City into Longyuan Sanctuary, he also needs a large number of excellent population.

The children of Tiance are all excellent!

Before, everyone's strength was above the eighth heaven level.

After the battle to destroy the blue-green army, everyone's strength has increased greatly, and now everyone is above the ninth level of heaven.

Qin Feng is very satisfied with them.

At the moment, he is no longer long-winded, and directly splits into two, turning into a very negative body and a very positive body.

Subsequently, the two main bodies fissioned more than 2,000 fission bodies each, for a total of more than 4,000 fission bodies.

Since the rapid increase in strength, Qin Feng's soul body strength has reached the middle stage of True God, and the upper limit of the number of fission bodies has reached 4096 patrols.

At the moment, more than 4,000 fission variants began to sign contracts with 50,000 Tiance disciples.

Three minutes later, the contract was all signed.

At this point, the Tiance Clan merged into Longyuan City.

The population of Longyuan has reached 100,000, the number of sites has increased to 346, and the overall strength has skyrocketed again.

Both parties are happy!

Yu Xuanji said: "Master, the concubine has a secret box, which was left by the ancestors of our family. I would like to invite you to take a look at the concubine. I wonder if the master has time?"

At this moment, Yu Xuanji revealed the secret of the clan.

Granny Yusang on the side showed a knowing smile

Chapter 647 Five-party luck! God bless!

Hearing this, Qin Feng was surprised: "The secret box left by your ancestors?"

Yu Xuanji smiled and nodded: "Exactly!"

Then, she added: "Master, until now, the concubine has not concealed it. The prophecy of my ancestors, the reason why it is so accurate, is to use the benefits of that treasure."

Qin Feng's eyes lit up, and he suddenly became interested.

He always felt that the prophecy method of the ancestors of Tiance was related to the middle page of the "Book of the Future".

Could it be that there is another half of the middle page hidden in the secret box?

If so, great!

Immediately, he smiled and said, "Then let's go and see!"

Yu Xuanji rejoiced: "Master, that secret box is hidden in the forbidden area of ‚Äã‚Äãour clan, please come with your concubine!"

"it is good!"

At the moment, Qin Feng waved his hand and released all fifty thousand Longyuan disciples from the zero-degree space.

Afterwards, he explained to Feng Xi and others, and followed Yu Xuanji to the forbidden area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Tiance Clan.

After Qin Feng and the others left, the disciples of Long Yuan and Tian Ce began to know each other.

The two sides get along very well and the atmosphere is very active!

From then on, everyone is from Longyuan City, and naturally they want to get to know each other.

After getting familiar with it, everyone starts to clean up the battlefield!
