Chapter 703 Supreme Evaluation! Thief God Armor!

At this moment, Tiandao came to remind again

[Reminder: It is detected that your Shenwu points have reached 1655 points, and the time consumption is less than 9 hours. Congratulations, you have reached the advanced and supreme evaluation standard! „Äë

[It is detected that you have obtained the title of 'Supreme Guardian of the Way', and your Shenwu points have broken 1 point. Congratulations on activating the opportunity for higher evaluation. „Äë

[New evaluation machine ~ the fate is as follows]

[No superior evaluation: The Shenwu score reaches 5 points or more, which is subject to the completion of the False God realm assessment]

[Does the player choose to accept the opportunity? „Äë

[Reminder: The Supreme Evaluation Challenge, since the birth of this universe, no one has been able to successfully obtain it, it is extremely difficult! „Äë

[Reminder: This chance challenge fails, no penalty! Players can still get high-level supreme evaluation! „Äë

[Reminder: This chance challenge has no time limit! „Äë

5 Shenwu points!

This is too high!

Qin Feng was shocked!

However, there is no superior evaluation. Since the birth of this universe, no one has been able to obtain it, and it is naturally extremely difficult.

You must know that the number of star fields in this universe is conservatively estimated to be in the trillions.

In so many star fields, no one can get the no-superior evaluation, which shows how difficult it is.

correct!

If he can obtain the supreme evaluation, it does not mean that he is the number one rookie powerhouse in this universe!

At least, his foundation and background will be the strongest existence in this universe.

That will have infinite benefits for his future development!

At this thought, Qin Feng's heart burst into flames!

However, 5 points!

Can he reach it?

This evaluation task is calculated after the completion of the False God realm assessment, and he may not be able to do it.

No matter what, he should give it a try, there is no penalty for failure anyway!

Qin Feng pondered for a while, and chose the challenge without hesitation.

Tiandao immediately sent a reminder

[Congratulations to the contestants for accepting the 'No Superior' chance challenge! „Äë

[Your current round of challenge assessment is automatically promoted to 'No Superior', and the content of the challenge has been changed accordingly! „Äë

„ÄêThe contents are changed as follows„Äë

[Challenge level 3 changed to challenge level 5! „Äë

[The upper limit of the strength of the Demon God of Zhenguan has been raised to the peak level of the Lord God! „Äë

hiss~!

Hearing Tiandao's prompt, Qin Feng couldn't help taking a breath of cold air.

When he challenged at the supreme level, the strongest strength of the guardian demon **** was the middle stage of the main god.

No superior has become the pinnacle of the main god, and has directly crossed a realm!

The further in this practice, the greater the strength gap between each small realm, and the greater the difficulty of the challenge.

From the middle stage of the main **** to the peak of the main god, it is more than ten times more difficult!

It seems that he has to quickly digest the reward he got before.

At this time, Tiandao sent another reminder!

[After 3 seconds, the player will be sent back to the main hall]

[After the player rests for 10 minutes, the third challenge will be opened (no superior)]

[Reminder: At the end of each level, players have a 10-minute rest time]

As soon as he heard the prompt, Qin Feng quickly looked around to see if there were any treasures.

Seeing this, he breathed a sigh of relief.

He has been plucked by his wild goose for a long time, no grass grows, and no treasures are left behind!

Soon, three seconds are up!

Qin Feng disappeared out of thin air and was sent back to the assessment hall!

Not long after he disappeared, the ghost car was resurrected and reborn!

As soon as it was resurrected, it saw a bare world, and even the body of its master was not seen.

The ghost car was dumbfounded!

It accepts the task of Heavenly Dao and guards the last level of the supreme level, the purpose is to revive the master.

Now it's better, it even lost the owner's body.

The next second, in that world, the endless roar of the ghost car was heard!

"Master! Return my master!"

"Little human thief! I don't share the sky with you! Ah~~~!"

At this moment, the ghost car is about to explode!

At the same time, Qin Feng had returned to the assessment hall.

As soon as he appeared, his figure flashed and entered the zero-degree space directly.

At this moment, in the zero-degree space, the cultivation secret room.

Qin Feng has activated the time force field!

"The next challenge without superiors, there are still three levels, and there will be a demon **** at the peak of the main god. I have to improve my strength quickly!"

Qin Feng muttered.

When he thought of the existence of the Lord God's peak level, he felt a big head.

The main god's peak combat power range is 700 million to 1.2 billion stars.LùíÇaTest novùíÜls on (n)ùíêvelbi/ùíè(.)coùíé

His current basic combat power is only 350 million stars, and his highest comprehensive combat power is only about 460 million stars.

This is too different from the peak of the Lord God!

If he does not improve his strength, he will not be able to pass even the challenge assessment of the demigod realm.

Of course, if he can refine the corpse puppet, he should be able to easily face the next situation.

But the refining of corpse puppets is not an overnight thing, I'm afraid it's too late!

In short, he couldn't waste any more time.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng felt a sense of urgency in his heart.

Afterwards, white light flashed on his body, releasing dozens of fission bodies.

Those fission bodies sat cross-legged and began to refine the treasures obtained this time.

The sixteen fission bodies began to refine the 'Dao Bone Pill'.

Sixteen are refining the 'Shenmai Dan'.

The eight are refining the 'source of divine power'.

The eight are refining the 'source of soul power'.

There is also a fission variant, which took out the 'Sacred Lotus of Mind' just obtained, ready to devour

After Qin Feng arranged these, he opened the panel and started adding points.

Killing the ghost car, he got 300 million attribute points!

This is also a huge gain! .

In just a moment, after adding 300 million attributes, Qin Feng's basic combat power skyrocketed to 356 million stars.

Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief and smiled with satisfaction.

The strength has increased a lot!

Then, he dodged and disappeared into place out of thin air.

The next second, he appeared in another secret room.

In the center of the secret room, lay a huge black coffin.

Above the giant coffin, there is a lantern floating.

It was the corpse coffin and the soul lamp.

Qin Feng took a deep breath and walked over slowly.

He wants to study how to refine this ancient god's corpse into a corpse puppet that obeys his orders.

After a while, he walked to the giant coffin, stroked the coffin lid with his hands, and exerted his strength secretly.

Click~! Click~! Click~!

The huge coffin lid was slowly pushed open by him, revealing the headless giant corpse inside.

Qin Feng looked at the giant corpse carefully

what! This armor

Soon, he was attracted by the black armor on the giant corpse.

After a while, surprise appeared in his eyes.

Then, he removed the black divine armor from the headless giant corpse.

In the next second, the divine armor floats in the air, and the aura is released!

The momentum is extraordinary!

[Thief God Armor: The Peak of High-Grade God Rank]

[After refining, it can feed back 10,000 star combat power]

[Reminder: You need to master the laws of time and space at the same time before refining]

This is actually a top-grade god-level **** armor!

What an unexpected surprise!

Qin Feng was overjoyed.

He only paid attention to the ancient **** corpse before, and didn't notice this **** armor.

If he refines this divine armor, his comprehensive strength will be greatly increased.

Having said that, this thief **** armor is a set of armor that covers the whole body, including shoulder armor, wrist armor, combat boots, etc.

After refining the thief **** armor, those space-time **** armor, ice field boots, thunder gloves, etc., can be directly replaced.

In this way, his whole body is equipped with high-grade god-level equipment, which can be described as a shotgun for a cannon.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng's body flashed white light, and a fission body was separated.

Afterwards, the fission body picked up the 'thief **** armor' and disappeared out of thin air with a look of joy.

He went to refine the Thief God Armor.

Qin Feng felt comfortable at the beginning of the game.

Later, he continued to study the matter of refining corpse puppets
