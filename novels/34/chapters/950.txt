At the broken head, blood spurted wildly!

But in the next second, the huge faucet glowed red and automatically flew towards the broken head.

Jin Ao is about to be resurrected!Alll ùíçùíÇtest novùíÜlùíî on novelbùíän/(.)cùíêm

It is a demon **** at the pinnacle of the main god!

Just cut off its head, it is impossible to kill it!

In the blink of an eye, the head flew to the broken head!

Seeing, it will automatically continue...

But at this moment, the mutation regenerates!

I saw Qin Feng pick up a seal and activate the middle page of the Book of the Future again.

Om~!

A holy beam of light descended from the sky and landed on the dragon head again.

The blood-red eyes of the dragon's head once again showed a confused look, and they were fixed in place.

At this moment, Qin Feng's eyebrows suddenly opened, and the **** of punishment appeared!

huh~!

A red-golden light of divine punishment shot out, penetrated directly into the fracture of the dragon's head, and blasted into its sea of ‚Äã‚Äãconsciousness!

Bang~!

A huge explosion!

Brain shot!

Blood splashes!

The invisible sea of ‚Äã‚Äãconsciousness was also broken!

The soul body in the sea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãknowledge was wiped out by one blow!

roar~!

Terrible dragon roar!

resounding through the world!

The whole world is shaking!

Click~! Click~! Click~!

In the next second, the dragon head began to crack inch by inch, turning into a blood mist in the sky!

The headless turtle **** on the side was also disintegrating inch by inch, turning into blood mist, and the blood mist turned into starlight, slowly dissipating!

Whoo~!

Finally killed it!

Seeing this scene, Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief!

He did a little calculation, it was about 14 and a half seconds, and it was only 15 seconds away.

If it takes 15 seconds, the outside time will reach 1 second, then he will not be able to get the evaluation he wants.

All this is really scary!

With this in mind, Qin Feng is quite fortunate!

huh~!

At this moment, a dazzling golden light flew out from the scattered starlight and poured into Qin Feng's body...

[You successfully killed Jin Ao (the peak of the main god) and obtained +1.2 billion attributes]

[You successfully killed Jin Ao (the peak of the main god) and obtained +10 trillion energy points]

[You successfully killed Jin Ao (the peak of the main god) and obtained +13 gold judgment points]

At this moment, Qin Feng's attribute points, energy value, and golden judgment value are skyrocketing all the way...

He felt comfortable!

Immediately afterwards, an upgraded white light lit up on him...

„ÄêYour level has been promoted to level 75! „Äë

...

[Your vocation is promoted to Level 60 Judgment Supreme (Elementary)! „Äë

...

[Successful advancement of vocation! You are automatically promoted to Intermediate Judgment Supreme]

[Congratulations on becoming the Intermediate Judge Supreme, Strength Index +50,000 points]

[Congratulations on becoming the Supreme Intermediate Judge, Agility Index +50,000 points]

[Congratulations on becoming the Supreme Intermediate Judge, BMI +50,000 points]

[Congratulations on becoming the Supreme Intermediate Judge, Energy Index +50,000 points]

[Congratulations on becoming the Intermediate Judgment Supreme, you have automatically acquired the vocation skill - Gate of Reincarnation (primary)]

[The door of reincarnation (primary): It can revive those who have just died. The time of death is more than one hour and cannot be resurrected]

[Reminder: For the primary door of reincarnation, the number of resurrections for the same target is only once]

Boom~Long~Long~!

Soon, Qin Feng's body lit up with the golden light of vocation advancement!

His momentum began to rise!

Qin Feng couldn't help but close his eyes and enjoy it comfortably.

When the vision disappeared, Qin Feng slowly opened his eyes, his face full of joy.

Just one vocation advancement has increased his four-dimensional attributes by 20,000 points, which is equivalent to an increase of 400,000 star combat power, which is not a small gain.

He is even more delighted that he has obtained another vocation skill - the door of reincarnation (primary).

This also let him know that the original reincarnation ancestor was an intermediate judge supreme.

Because of this, the ancestor of reincarnation only used the "gate of reincarnation" to resurrect the ancestor of Beiming once, and could not be resurrected a second time.

After figuring out this, Qin Feng remembered the SS-level peak task he received - the trial of the truth of God's Domain.

One of the tasks is to promote the vocation to Judgment Hongmeng Supreme.

Judgment Hongmeng Supreme, promoted from high-level Judgment Supreme.

Now, he has been promoted to the Intermediate Judgment Supreme.

The progress of this task has finally made progress.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng was in a good mood.

Om~!

At this moment, the Heavenly Fate Divine Sword in his hand lit up with a dazzling golden light...

Immediately afterwards, an invisible force poured into his body along the hilt of the sword, making his whole body warm and extremely comfortable...

[The luck absorption is successful! Your Heavenly Fate Sword has swallowed all the luck of Jin Ao! Congratulations on getting 16x luck! „Äë

[Detected, your own air transport value has reached 206 times]

[Congratulations on completing a **** condition for promotion to 'Lord of Destiny']

[The condition you have not yet met is: the basic combat power reaches 700 million stars]

Hearing the prompt, Qin Feng's eyes lit up and once again showed a satisfied smile.

His luck has improved again, and his comprehensive strength has increased invisibly!

Now, he is only one step away from being promoted to the title of 'Lord of Destiny', and his basic combat power has reached 700 million stars.

And his current basic combat power is about 555 million stars, which should be close to 700 million stars.

Because he also gained 1.2 billion attribute points this time, and the reward for passing the level has not been issued yet!

Perhaps after consuming those gains, his basic combat power will be close to 700 million stars.

Boom~Long~Long~!

Qin Feng just remembered those thoughts, and Tiandao sent another reminder...

[Congratulations to the player Qin Feng, who successfully killed Jin Ao (no superior demon god), it took less than 1 second]

[The performance of the players exceeds the highest rating set by the main hall]

[This level gives the player Qin Feng a unique super evaluation reward]

Qin Feng showed a satisfied smile!

Everything is as he expected!

He got another super rating!

At this time, Tiandao sent another reminder...

[Super evaluation rewards are as follows]

[Reward player Qin Feng, Shenwu points 12 points! „Äë

[Reward player Qin Feng, eight times the reward for passing the level]

„ÄêThe rewards for this level are as follows„Äë

[Reward players with 3 times the luck value! „Äë

[Reward players with 3 Daogu Dan (middle-grade god-level)]

[Reward players with 3 Shenmai Pills (middle-grade god-level)]

[Reward the source of the divine power of the 2 groups of players (the peak of the middle-grade divine order)]

[Reward the source of soul power of the 2nd team (the peak of the middle-grade god-level)]

[Reward players with 1 drop of golden dragon blood (high-grade god-level)]

‚Ä¶

[After the super evaluation has been doubled by eight times, the changes are as follows...]

[Reward players with 24 times the luck value]

[Reward the contestant with 24 Daogu Dan (middle grade god-level)]

[Reward players with 24 Shenmai Pills (middle-grade gods)]

[Reward players 16 groups of sources of divine power (the peak of the middle-level gods)]

[Reward the source of soul power of 16 groups of players (the peak of the middle-level god-level)]

[8 drops of golden dragon blood (high-grade **** rank) for players to be rewarded]

Qin Feng is full of surprises!

Among the rewards this time, there was a golden dragon blood of the high-rank **** rank, and eight drops were also rewarded at a time.

With these eight drops of divine blood, perhaps his bloodline talent can be promoted to a small realm.

At that time, he can use his blood essence to promote the three spiritual eggs of Houtu, Gonggong, and Zhurong to the peak level of the high-grade **** rank.

correct! Heavenly Wu Ling egg!

Thinking of Tian Wu Ling Egg, Qin Feng couldn't help but look at the place where Jin Ao fell.

I saw that Jin Ao's body had turned into countless stars and dispersed, leaving behind the huge tortoise shell, which was miraculously suspended in the air.

At this moment, the huge tortoise shell has turned into an island, which is thousands of miles long and suspended in the air.

The spiritual flowers and plants, the spiritual fruit and the spiritual tree on it have all appeared.

On the east side of the island, the altar is still there!
