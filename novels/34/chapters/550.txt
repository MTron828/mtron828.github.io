Boom!

As soon as the voice fell, the center of the square shook violently.

A white jade stele broke out of the ground and slowly rose from the ground...

Everyone was startled and turned to look.

At the top of the stele, there is a line of golden divine inscriptions, complex in structure and full of rhythm...

Many people do not know which line of characters.

The weird thing is that everyone can understand the meaning of the words only by looking at one line...

„ÄêArea 73 Points Ranking List„Äë

boom!

Suddenly, there was an uproar in the audience!

"Hey! It's the scoreboard!"T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

"The rankings are coming out!"

"Yeah! I wonder how many places I can rank?"

"I don't know how much I can rank?"

"I'm more concerned about who made it into the top 100! I wonder how many people in our Mercury world can make it into?"

"Just wait and see! We'll find out soon!"

At this moment, everyone looked at the monument with excitement, and their eyes were full of concern.

"Dad, the rankings are coming out!"

"Master, can you make the top 100 this time?!"

Qin Feng smiled: "you watch it! You will know soon!"

Hearing this, the three girls were very curious and looked at the monument with anticipation on their faces.

The 451st chapter points first! Shocked the audience!

Just as everyone was eagerly looking forward to it, a line of golden light lit up at the bottom of the monument...

At the moment, someone in the crowd muttered.

"It seems that the first one to appear is the last one."

"You said, who will be the last?"

"Do you still need to guess? Isn't it the ones from the Blue Star Realm!"

The sound was not loud, but many people heard it.

Some people looked at Qin Feng and the others with a half-smile, with a gloating look on their faces.

In their opinion, Qin Feng's four prefecture-level realms must be at the bottom of the ranking.

And those players from the Blue Star Realm all frowned and looked gloomy.

In their opinion, the Blue Star Realm will be disgraced in a while.

It's all the fault of Qin Feng and the others.

Why! Really!

How did their Blue Star Realm get into the four Earth-level realms?

This time, the Blue Star Realm is destined to be laughed at!

It makes me angry to think about it!

Those Blue Star Realm players are getting more and more annoyed the more they think about it!

hum!

At this moment, the golden light on the monument dissipated, and a row of ranking information appeared.

Everyone quickly opened their eyes and looked.

[No. 4002, Min Xingjie, floating, 1 point]

"Hey! The last one is from Min Xingjie!"

"Strange! Why is he not from the Blue Star Realm!"

"So, those four people from the Blue Star Realm have more than 1 point!"

"No way? People at the prefecture level can also get 1 point!"

Everyone was a little surprised, and they turned to look at Qin Feng and the others, all with disbelief in their expressions...

It seems normal that Qin Feng and the four of them get 0 points in advance.

Qin Feng had a panoramic view of the expressions of these people, and a meaningful smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

At this moment, Xiao Luan's muttering sounded in his ears.

"Dad, what expressions do those guys have! It seems that we are not the last one, very surprised!"

Qiyue was also dissatisfied: "That's right! These guys really look down on people, thinking that if the realm is higher, they can overwhelm us, so they look down on people like this?!"

Qin Feng smiled and said, "Don't be angry, the two of you! The good show is yet to come! After a while, they will know how shallow they are!"

Feng Xi also smiled and said, "That's right! When they find out that our points are higher than many of them, let's see their expressions!"

Xiao Luan'er's eyes lit up: "Yes! It would be even more exciting if Dad entered the top 100 again and received additional rewards in front of 18 people!"

Qiyue rejoiced: "If that's the case, it will be fun!"

All the way, the three girls looked at each other with joy in their eyes.

Qin Feng also smiled without saying a word.

He is also looking forward to that scene...

hum! hum! hum!

It was at this moment that the spiritual light flashed on the stele, and the ranking information appeared one after another.

Everyone's attention returned to the monument again...

[No. 4001, Dongxingjie, Dongping, 1 point]

[No. 4000, Scarlet Star Realm, Glazed Wind, 1 point]

[No. 3999, Gray Star Realm, Ai Yun, 1 point]

...

Just like that, one name after another emerged.

In the blink of an eye, dozens of rankings appeared, but there was not a single list of Blue Star Realm players.

This surprised everyone more and more!

what happened?

Didn't the Blue Star Realm come from four Earth-level realms!

How come there is no one at the bottom of the ranking!

In the crowd, those Blue Star players were also a little surprised.

They thought that the Blue Star Realm was going to lose face, but from the current situation, there is no sign of shame!

It's all so weird!

[No. 3713, Blue Star Realm, Tao Lun, 3 points]

At number 3713, a person from the Blue Star Realm finally appeared.

The field suddenly fell below!

"Tsk tsk! 3 points! I didn't expect that among the four prefecture-level Blue Star players, someone could get 3 points!"

"Yeah! It's incredible!"

The crowd whispered!

Many people also looked at Qin Feng and the others, and their expressions changed a little.

Compared with before, there is less contempt.

In this world of slaughter, everything is respected by strength.

As long as you have strength, you will be respected!

However, see the expressions of those people.

Qin Feng felt a little funny.

These people were too self-righteous, thinking that the Blue Star player named 'Tao Lun' was one of the four of them.

To put it bluntly, I still despised them.

I thought the four of them were the worst four in the Blue Star Realm!

In the crowd, only a middle-aged man looked at Qin Feng and the four with a complicated expression.

There was a hint of bitterness in his expression.

Because he is that Tao Lun, the one with the worst grades in the Blue Star Realm...

However, under the restriction of heaven, no one can spy on the target's name, so no one knows the truth.

hum! hum! hum!

Ranking information continues to be displayed...

[No. 3697, Blue Star Realm, Fei Liu, 3 points]

[No. 3311, Blue Star Realm, Mulong, 4 points]

[No. 3297, Blue Star Realm, Chun Lin, 4 points]

In a blink of an eye, the four worst results in the Blue Star Realm all came out...

A sigh once again in the field!

"I really didn't expect it! For those four prefecture-level realms, two people got 4 points, and two people got 3 points!"

"Yeah! This result is already very good for the Earth-level realm! It has surpassed the vast majority of heaven-level powerhouses."

"It seems that the four of them can enter this place, they are really capable, don't underestimate it!"

"It's okay! The four of them may be refining Divine Essence, some special secret techniques. Otherwise, how could they be more powerful than Heavenly Powerhouses!"

"Let me see! Their highlights will end here. The prefecture level is the prefecture level after all! The big opportunities in the back are not so easy to win!"

The crowd is talking!

Some people's tone, and some sour.

Qin Feng wanted to laugh when he heard it!

These guys are as self-righteous as ever!

They actually put the four worst results in the Blue Star Realm on Qin Feng's four.

This self-righteousness comes from the underestimation of Qin Feng and the others.

Of course, there are a few people in the crowd who understand.

In other words, the four worst performers in the Blue Star Realm!

Because they know that the four worst grades are them, not Qin Feng...

hum! hum! hum!

The golden light flashes on the stele, and the rankings are announced continuously...

In a blink of an eye, the ranking has reached more than 100.

The atmosphere in the field is getting more and more tense, because the top 100 is coming soon...
