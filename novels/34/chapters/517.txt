He wants to build Longyuan Town into a realm of gods, and naturally he needs a few super powerhouses who can stand alone.

From the current point of view, apart from Xiao Luan'er, the only subordinates who are suitable for training are Qiyue.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng put away the three divine cards with satisfaction.

hum!

Immediately afterwards, the fourth beam of light fell, and another drop of divine blood slowly fell along the beam of light. From a distance, it was as crystal clear as red colored glass, with its own purple glow.

[True Dragon Blood Essence (Top Grade), Ninth-Order Middle Grade. 】

The best true dragon blood!

If refining, the benefits are unimaginable!

Qin Feng happily accepted the blood of God.

At this point, the reward is over!

He put away the reward with satisfaction, overlooking the audience, and seeing that everyone opened the panel, they were all excitedly adding points.

Qin Feng smiled slightly and opened the panel to check the latest data...

[Level]: Level 37 13.21%

[Reputation]: 1656 points (God-defying)

[Combat Strength]: 127,000 stars

[Free attribute]: 250,000 points

[Personal points]: 413,100 points

[Longyuan Points]: 471,700 points

very good!

Long Yuan's points have reached 471,700 points, and he is one step closer to the goal of 2 million points.

In the next round of competition, Qin Feng's goal is naturally to be the first in the double list!

2 million points is his minimum goal.

Now that the game has not started, he has scored 471,700 points, which is a good start.

There is also the 250,000 attributes of the Heavenly Dao reward, which is also very impressive. It is time to add some more...

At the moment, he also happily added his starting point...

At the same time, on the border of Area 2, somewhere above the jungle.

Qiyue is leading nearly a thousand disciples of Longyuan and is rushing to the third area...

Cao Yuan and Wei Tao followed behind her.

Originally, the two of Cao Yuan could not fly in the sky.

Qiyue used the power of heaven and earth to assist the two of them, so that they could also fly in the air.

The rest of the nearly 1,000 Longyuan disciples, all of them at the Earth-level realm, can naturally fly in the sky...

At this moment, the two of Cao Yuan were very excited, chatting along the way.

It turned out that not long after they joined Longyuan Town, they changed their status from refugees to town residents, and they also had the authority to rebuild the novice wooden house.

With the help of Qiyue, the two's wooden house soared directly from level 0 to level 6.

This made the combat power of the two soar from two to three hundred stars to more than five hundred stars.

As a result, the two were extremely excited and full of gratitude to Qiyue.

"Miss Qiyue, thank you so much this time!"

"Yeah! Without Miss Qiyue's help, we still don't know what year and month would we be able to have such combat power?"

Cao Yuan and the two were deeply moved.

Qiyue smiled slightly: "You don't have to thank me! The one you should thank most is my master!"

Wei Tao sighed with emotion: "Yeah! If there is no boss Qin Feng to take in, the two of us are afraid that our lives will be lost."

Cao Yuan was a little embarrassed and said, "Miss Qiyue, what I'm worried about now is whether Wei Tao and I are too weak? This is a bit of a drag on everyone!"

Speaking of which, he looked around at the disciples of Long Yuan, and none of them had a combat power lower than 900 stars.

Compared with the disciples of Long Yuan, they were far worse.

Thinking of this, they are inevitably a little embarrassed.

Qi Yue comforted: "You two don't need to belittle yourself. In fact, your talent level is not weak, and your foundation is very good."

"After dealing with the trivial matters of the Phoenix clan, you will go to participate in the Shengwu assessment. It is no problem to get a mid-level foundation building. By that time, your comprehensive combat power can reach about 700 stars."

Hearing this, Cao Yuan looked forward with anticipation: "I hope so! However, I heard that the Shengwu test is extremely difficult, and many people can't even pass the low-level foundation building. I don't know if the two of us can pass the middle-level foundation building test?"

Wei Tao also said: "Yeah! That William is considered to be extremely talented and strong, and he only took a low-rank foundation to build a foundation."

"Only low-grade foundation building?"

Qiyue shook her head slightly, somewhat disdainful.

Afterwards, she said again: "Don't worry, both of you! With my master here, it will be easy for you to pass the mid-level foundation examination."

Cao Yuan was apprehensive: "Really? After all, Qin Feng's boss is really powerful! It's so powerful that we can't even imagine it!"

Wei Tao was also amazed: "Yeah! If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes today, I would never have believed that a challenger could be so powerful. I really don't understand, how did Boss Qin Feng do it?"

Speaking of which, the two were full of emotion.

Actually, they have another idea.

That is the challenge force and the people of Longguo, why can the people of Longyuan Town progress so rapidly?

Is this also related to Boss Qin Feng?

As if seeing what the two were thinking, Qi Yue smiled slightly.

"You two, my master's magical powers, you will gradually see it in the future."

As soon as these words fell, the surrounding Longyuan disciples also laughed and echoed.

"Cao Yuan, Wei Tao, as long as you follow Boss Qin Feng, you will be sure to open your eyes!"

"Hey! We in Longyuan Town can achieve today's achievements, relying on the boss Qin Feng!"

Hearing this, Cao Yuan and the two were even more surprised.

Cao Yuan was even more curious: "Really? How did he do it?"

Boom!

As soon as these words fell, the sky suddenly shook.

Everyone was shocked and looked up...

Tiandao also sent a reminder...

[Task Announcement: Qin Feng, the mayor, completed the fourth stage of the god-level village (double A-level difficulty) task completed! 】

[Quest reward: To reward all the townspeople of Longyuan, any talent will be automatically promoted to one level, limited to talents below A level. 】

[Quest reward: Those who already have A-level talent and cannot improve it can get 50,000 attribute points as compensation. 】

[Quest reward: In addition, all the townspeople of Longyuan will be rewarded with 20,000 attribute points. 】

In the next second, hundreds of reward beams of light fell from the sky and fell on everyone...

After a while, the surprise cheers of Cao Yuan and the two of them sounded in the field!

"My God! Wei Tao, my talent has been promoted from B level to A level!"

"Look! Our attribute points have increased by 20,000!"

"Haha! That's awesome! It's awesome!"

"It's Boss Qin Feng! Just now, Tiandao reminded that it was Boss Qin Feng who completed the task and let us get the reward!"

"Understood! I finally understand what you mean now!"

At this moment, Cao Yuan and the two were very excited, and their worship and gratitude to Qin Feng reached an incomparable level.

Seeing this, everyone in Long Yuan showed a knowing smile.

Only by getting along with Qin Feng, can we better understand the power of the boss.

What these two guys have seen is just the beginning.

At this moment, Qi Yue was also excited.

She got 70,000 attribute rewards this time.

Seeing how excited Cao Yuan and the two of them were, she was even happier.

At the moment, she smiled and said, "Do you understand now?"

"Understood! I really understand!"

The two of Cao Yuan nodded again and again, their faces full of joy.

Then, a group of people started adding points.

In just a moment, the points were added, and the combat power of everyone in Long Yuan reached more than 1,000 stars.

Even Cao Yuan and the two have reached 800 stars.

This made the two even more excited and grateful to Qin Feng.

"Miss Qiyue, our current combat power has reached 800 stars. Now we know why Longyuan Town is so strong, it turns out that it is because of the boss Qin Feng!"

Cao Yuan was deeply moved.

Qi Yue smiled and said: "It's good to understand! By the way, with your A-level talents, plus combat power. You are now expected to challenge the high-grade foundation building. If the high-grade foundation building is successful, the strength of the two of you will catch up, no It's going to be a drag."

Cao Yuan was delighted: "We also have this idea. After we finish dealing with the Feng Clan, we will go to participate in the Shengwu assessment."

Wei Tao also said: "By the way, Miss Qiyue, can you give William to us after we catch him? We want to kill him with our own hands and avenge the village chief and compatriots who died before."

Qiyue nodded: "This is a small matter! When the time comes, the master clone is also there, and he should promise you."

Cao Yuan was delighted: "That's great! With our current strength, we should be able to easily kill that William!"

When it comes to William, both of them are full of hatred.

"Let's go! Let's go to Area 3! The master's clone is still waiting for us!"

"Yes!"

At the moment, a group of people set off to Area 3 in a happy mood...

At the same time, the Yao people were stationed in the sky.

Qin Feng also added 250,000 attributes, and the basic combat power soared to 132,000 stars in one fell swoop.

He is very satisfied!

Later, when he looked down at the audience, he found that the strength of everyone had improved a lot.

With a combat power of over 2,000 stars, it suddenly reached more than 70 people.

This means that Longyuan Town has more than 70 heaven-level first-level combat power.

Among them, Liu Xuan, Lei Jue, and Qi Shan have even broken through the 3,000-star combat power and reached the second level of Heaven.

Xiao Luan'er's combat power has also soared a lot, and has been promoted to the middle stage of the eighth level of heaven.

In a word, the disciples of Long Yuan are getting stronger and stronger, and they are no longer under the disciples of the mysterious forces.

This made Qin Feng very happy.

At this moment, Tiandao sent another reminder...
