This monster is definitely not simple!

However, its explosion rate also reached 10%.

Killing this monster will definitely gain a lot!

Qin Feng slowly pulled out the blade of wind marks.

Woo~!

At this moment, a low growl rang out from the Cerberus' throat.T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

In the dark night, the low voice was low and long.

Sand~! Sha~! Sha~!

Immediately afterwards, there were various sounds of running from all directions.

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

In just a few seconds, one shadow after another arrived at the scene.

It turned out to be one **** after another two-headed dog.

In just a moment, the two-headed dogs of **** surrounded Qin Feng.

A total of nine **** two-headed dogs!

That is, nine level 10 mutant evil creatures!

The strength of this combination will be extremely terrifying.

Qin Feng took a deep breath and his expression became solemn.

At this moment, he didn't know whether he was lucky or unlucky.

Nine mutant monsters with an explosion rate of 10%, all killed, can definitely explode the treasure chest.

But when the nine teamed up, he wasn't sure he could win.

Woo~! Woo~!

Those **** double-headed dogs stared at Qin Feng coldly, with contempt and disdain in the depths of their eyes.

A little level 6 human!

How dare you break into the level 10 vicious beast area, how arrogant!

Not to mention level 6 humans, even if level 10 humans step into this place, they will be instantly torn to shreds by them.

Having said that, they hadn't seen a living person for many years, and they almost forgot the warm taste of human blood.

Woo~!

Suddenly, there was a low cry!

Swish~!

One of the hellhounds suddenly pounced on Qin Feng.

not good!

These guys got their hands on it.

Qin Feng was startled.

But in the next second, he discovered that the other eight remained motionless, all watching with a calm expression on their faces.

It turned out that these hellhounds didn't take him seriously at all, thinking that one could easily kill him.

Whoo~!

The fishy wind is coming!

In the blink of an eye, the hellhound rushed forward and bit Qin Feng's neck with a large caliber of blood.

Qin Feng's figure slanted slightly, and he easily avoided the pounce, and at the same time the sword light flashed in his hand.

Swish~!

Kacha~!

Blood splashes!

That knife split the Cerberus in half.

Blood and guts spilled all over the place!

That hellhound was killed in seconds!

The other eight were dumbfounded!

The next second, a dazzling white light flew from the dog's corpse and poured into Qin Feng's body...

[Successfully killed the level 10 **** double-headed dog (mutation level), and obtained +1000 energy points. „Äë

1000 energy points!

[Successfully kills the 10th-level Hell Double-Headed Dog (mutation level), and obtains +15 Judgment Points. „Äë

what!

And judgement!

Cool!

[You killed the 10th-level Hell Double-Headed Dog (mutant level) for the first time, and gained 2 reputation. „Äë

good!

2 more reputation points!

At this moment, Qin Feng was pleasantly surprised.

[Successful killing the **** double-headed dog! The fragments of the dark seal burst out! „Äë

Items exploded!

Qin Feng looked down and saw the dog's corpse lit up with white light, and a fragment of the seal emerged.

roar~! roar~!

But before he could pick up the seal fragments, the dogs roared one after another, their eyes red.

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

In the next second, black flames erupted from their whole bodies, blazing roaringly, and their momentum skyrocketed.

Qin Feng's True Sight quickly scanned away, and was surprised to find that the combat power of the eight Cerberus had soared to 16 stars.

It turned out that they cast a skill - hellfire.

That is, the black flames ignited on them!

roar~! roar~! roar~!

Immediately afterwards, the dogs roared wildly and spewed out a large cloud of black mist.

Those black mists formed one piece, covering a radius of 100 meters.

Qin Feng was shrouded in it.

He was shocked and quickly held his breath.

But as soon as those black mists stained his skin, like thousands of invisible filaments, they quickly penetrated into his body, forming a strange cold energy.

Wherever the energy went, his body became numb and stiff, and his strength continued to decline...

[Urgent reminder: Your body is being eroded by the power of darkness! „Äë

[Urgent reminder: You have been eroded, and your combat power has fallen to 16 stars. „Äë

Fuck it~!

Hit!

Qin Feng was shocked.

The dark erosion skills of these hellhounds are so powerful!

His combat power has fallen to the same level as these hellhounds.

But he has only one person, but the other party has eight.

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

But without waiting for Qin Feng to think about it, the eight hellhounds were culled at the same time.

Chapter 37 The Mysterious Land

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

In the blink of an eye, eight hellhounds were slaughtered.

The siege is unstoppable!

Qin Feng has a talent for speed and has an extremely fast response.

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

I saw his figure flashing repeatedly, and in the blink of an eye, he avoided the culling of the three-headed hellhounds.

But the attack of the other five heads could no longer be avoided, so he had to slash in front of the sword.

When~! When~! When~!

A burst of gold and iron symphony!

That knife blocked the three steel-like claws and shook the three-headed hellhound backwards.

Bang~! Bang~!

Then, there were two more muffled sounds!

Qin Feng was blasted out.

But it was the last two hellhounds, their claws slammed heavily on Qin Feng's chest, blowing Qin Feng away...

Immediately afterwards, the three-headed hellhounds who attacked first chased away.

Before Qin Feng fell from the air, the three giant dogs had already killed them, and they all opened their mouths to bite.

I saw one biting Qin Feng's chest, the other biting Qin Feng's right leg, and the other biting Qin Feng's neck.

At this moment, Qin Feng was in the air, and it was difficult to control his body shape. He couldn't avoid it at all. The situation was very unfavorable.

At that critical moment, he kicked with both feet and swung his long knife at the same time...

Bang~! Bang~!

Two muffled beeps!

Those feet are in the middle of the two dog heads!

The two giant dogs were kicked out.

Kacha~!

Immediately afterwards, a blade light lit up in the dark night!

The last giant dog was split in half and blood splashed...
