The corpses, stumps, and broken wings of countless poisonous bees continued to fall from the air...

A feast of harvesting energy continues frantically...

In a blink of an eye, fifteen minutes passed.

The whole valley has changed a lot!

A ten-mile radius was covered with thick snow and ice, turning it into a world of ice and snow.

Countless broken corpses of poisonous bees were half buried in the snow.

The more than 1,000 piranhas were also buried in the snow.

Even the dead wood demon was covered with a thick layer of snow, like a Christmas tree in winter.

There were also three beehives hanging under the branches, which were also devastated and damaged, lying quietly on the snow like that.

It's quiet in the field!

There were sporadic snowflakes in the air, and a faint smell of blood.

Whoo~!

Qin Feng let out a long breath.

It's finally over!

More than 3,000 poisonous bees, all of them were slaughtered, and not one remained!

The energy value harvest is extremely gratifying.

Today, his level progression is level 13 (1673500/2000000).

Such progress is not far from reaching level 14!

Qin Feng was so happy!

Then, he raised his hand again and wiped the fine beads of sweat oozing from his forehead.

Continuing to cast 'Ice Storm' consumes a lot of energy.

Even if he was as strong as him, after fifteen minutes of continuous use, he felt quite exhausted.

fortunately!

Fifteen minutes later, the bee colony was wiped out.

Ice Storm is indeed a Tier 4 skill, its power is so terrifying!

"It's time to solve this tree demon!"

Qin Feng looked up at the towering ancient tree in the distance.

The next second, he stepped into the snow and walked towards the tree demon.

The tree demon has long been frightened!

At this moment, when it saw Qin Feng coming, it suddenly woke up.

Whoa~la~la!

The demon tree moved automatically without wind, shaking off the snow and ice all over its body, making a strange and restless noise.

Ka~! Ka~! Ka~!

In the next second, a strange sound was heard under the snow.

Qin Feng couldn't help but stop.

Bang~! Bang~! Bang~!

Immediately afterwards, one after another piranha flower broke out of the snow.

They are broken limbs and reborn!

However, their state is a little sluggish, and their momentum has also dropped a lot.

The previous ice storm, although it could not destroy them, brought them a lot of damage.

Click~! Click~! Click~!

At this moment, the thousands of man-eating flowers rose from the ground one by one, and then under the control of the tree demon, they scrambled to kill Qin Feng.

Whoa~la~la!

The tree demon swayed and launched the horn of war.

It doesn't believe it, it can't kill Qin Feng!

These piranhas are not afraid of ice storms!

With more and less, sooner or later, this human being will be consumed.

In a blink of an eye, thousands of piranhas moved their roots and surrounded them.

"Just in time!"

Boom~!

Qin Feng's whole body burst into flames.

Hellfire - Activate!

Even the long sword was on fire.

In the next second, he waved the flame sword and rushed into the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãflowers.

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

Kacha~! Kacha~! Kacha~!

Squeak~! Squeak~! Squeak~!

Suddenly, the demon flowers screamed incessantly!

¬†‚Ä¶

Those piranhas can't resist the flames of hell!

Under Qin Feng's attack, he was destroyed like a rotten tree, and fell into pieces, some turned into ashes, some turned into coke...

Qin Feng's energy value is soaring all the way again!

He was so happy!

Whoa~la~la!

The tree demon screamed incessantly!

It did not expect this result!

Not only the bee colony can't resist Qin Feng, but even the piranhas can't deal with Qin Feng.Th√™ sourcùó≤ of this content n/o/v/(ùíÜl)bi((n))

This human has mastered two very different talents, ice and fire!

How can there be such an existence in the world?

Do not!

It can't sit still!

Whoa~la~la!

The tree swayed and made a strange sound again.

Pa~! Pa~! Pa~!

In the snow, three beehives burst one after another, and three giant bees more than two meters long flew out.

Qin Feng is killing the Quartet.

He heard some movement, and turned his head to look, only to see the three golden giant bees.

[Ferocious Beast]: Golden Queen Bee (King Level)

[Level]: Level 15

[Combat evaluation]: 47 stars

[Characteristics]: Poisonous, violent, guardian.

„Äêtalent„Äë:? ? ?

„ÄêSkill„Äë:? ? ? ?

[Explosion rate]: 100%

[Status]: Controlled

Fuck it~!

It's a level 15 queen bee!

Still three!

Qin Feng was a little surprised.

This dead wood old demon is a bit arrogant!

It was able to control three level 15 queen bees to guard it.

No wonder, it is obviously an ancient tree, it looks like it has no attack power, but it can be ranked second among the five demon kings.

It's manipulative ability is too strong!

It can control both piranha swarms and bee swarms.

This level is more difficult than the previous level.

Om~! Om~! Om~!

As soon as the three golden queen bees appeared, they went straight to Qin Feng.

At this time, Qin Feng had killed more than 300 piranhas, but he was still besieged.

As soon as the three queen bees arrived, they fell from the air, and the poisonous stingers on their tails went straight to Qin Feng's head.

Those three poisonous needles were gleaming with golden light, and their poison was ten times more than that of ordinary poisonous bees.

Swish~!

But at this moment, Qin Feng suddenly split into two and released a phantom clone.

The three queen bees are a little confused, and they can't tell which one is the real body for a while.

Qin Feng took the opportunity to shoot, as fast as lightning.

Swish~!

Cold light flashes!

A blade more than ten feet long pierced through the sky!

puff~! puff~! puff~!

Three consecutive beeps!

Insect liquid shot!

Screams again and again!
