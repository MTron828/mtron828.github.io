Spiritual water rose into the sky and rushed towards the divine book.

In just a moment, the book of the present world has absorbed tens of thousands of drops of divine water.

As soon as Qin Feng waved his hand, he put away the divine book and stopped absorbing it.

At the same moment, he closed his eyes and sensed the change of the soul in the book.

The next second, he opened his eyes with surprise.

He sensed that the ancient spirit body hidden in the book of this world was actively absorbing the holy water of light and slowly repairing itself...

In fact, the Book of the Present World also has the function of restoring the soul.

The combination of these two actually caused the broken soul to self-repair.

Qin Feng is overjoyed!

As long as the ancient god's soul body is repaired to more than 50%, he can refine a corpse puppet!

This is all going in a good direction!

Qin Feng happily put away the "Book of the Present World"

He also did not expect that the holy water of light that he had inadvertently obtained had such a wonderful effect!

Boom~Long~Long~!

It was at this moment that his sea of ‚Äã‚Äãconsciousness suddenly vibrated continuously...

Tiandao also came with a reminder...

[Reminder: Your 'Sacred Lotus of Mind' has swallowed an unowned sacred lotus of consciousness and is automatically advancing...]

„ÄêAdvanced success! Your 'Sacred Lotus of Mind' has bloomed ten petals! „Äë

what!

Ten petals open?

Qin Feng is overjoyed!

Then, he dodged and disappeared in place.

In the next second, he returned to the secret cultivation room.

I saw that in the secret room, one of his fission bodies was looking up at the sky with joy.

In that sky, a holy and jade-like white lotus has opened ten petals, exuding a faint fragrance.

That is Qin Feng's 'Sacred Lotus of Mind', which has one more petal than before.

Having said that, the holy lotus of the mind can generally only be condensed in the realm above the quasi-god king.

Qin Feng encountered many adventures, and before he reached the demigod realm, he already possessed the sacred lotus of consciousness.

The holy lotus of consciousness condensed by the quasi-god king is generally a flower bud.

The sacred lotus of consciousness in the realm of the gods has nine petals, and a few have ten petals.

This time, Qin Feng devoured another unowned 'Sacred Lotus of Mind', which has reached ten petals.

This is his advantage!

At this moment, when the fission variant saw Qin Feng, he stepped out, teleported directly to Qin Feng's side, and then took the initiative to integrate into Qin Feng's body.

Qin Feng waved his hand again, and the "Sacred Lotus of Mind" in the air turned into a white light, flew into his eyebrows, and disappeared.

Boom~Long~Long~!

Immediately afterwards, he felt a tumult in the sea, and the spirit power of the whole person soared all the way...

[Your 'Sacred Lotus of Mind' has bloomed ten petals and is feeding you huge spiritual energy...]

[Backfeeding is over! Congratulations, your soul body strength has been upgraded to the initial level of the main **** in one fell swoop, and you have obtained a 30,000-star combat power upgrade]

[Your Divine Punishment Eyes are once again fused with the 'Sacred Lotus of Mind'...]

„ÄêFusion is complete! Your Divine Punishment Eye is advanced to the highest grade God Rank 2 peak level! You have obtained the permanent feedback of 10,000-star combat power]

A shocking move!

At the center of Qin Feng's eyebrows, the vertical red line shot out a faint white light, which looked extremely sacred.

After a while, all the visions disappeared!

He also slowly opened his eyes, his face full of joy.

This time, the Holy Lotus of Consciousness opened ten petals, which made his soul body and God Punishment Eyes advanced, and his combat power also increased by 130,000 stars.

As a result, his basic combat power reached 510 million stars!

510 million!

His current strength has properly reached the mid-level demigod.

This will be very beneficial to his next challenge!

At this moment, Tiandao sent a reminder again...

[It is detected that your combat power has exceeded 500 million stars, and your luck has exceeded 1 times the value]

[Congratulations on activating the second title advanced task - Lord of Destiny]

[The advanced conditions of the title are as follows]

[Basic combat power reaches 700 million stars]

[My own air transport reaches 2 times the value]

Qin Feng's eyes lit up.

The advanced task of the second title has finally been activated!

This title of 'Lord of Destiny' sounds very extraordinary!

Before Qin Feng could think about it, Tiandao sent another reminder...

[One minute later, the third challenge will start, players please get ready! „Äë

A new challenge is about to begin! .

Chapter 705: The Demons Gather! Heavenly Wu Ling egg!

Qin Feng's figure flashed and disappeared into the secret room.

The next second, he returned to the assessment hall.

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

Immediately afterwards, white light flashed on his body.

Thief God Armor, Heaven Suppression God Wing, Heavenly Fate Sword, and "Book of the Present World", these four high-grade divine objects are all in one!

In just an instant, Qin Feng's comprehensive combat power reached about 550 million stars.

He was very satisfied with such combat power.

If you use the law of heaven and earth, plus the law of chaos, and the help of the power of luck.Explore new ùíèovels on nùíêvelbiùíè(.)com

His comprehensive strength is infinitely close to the threshold of the peak of the Lord God.

"I don't know if there will be a demon **** at the peak level of the main **** in this third level?"

Qin Feng muttered, a little worried in his heart.

After all, the challenge now has been upgraded, and it has been promoted to the top.

If there is a demon **** at the peak level of the main **** in the third pass, it would not be surprising.

And Qin Feng's ambition is to also get super evaluation in the third level.

With the help of "Book of the Present World", he has a chance of success.

As long as he kills the gatekeeper demon within 15 seconds, he will get a super rating.

However, if the Demon God Shouguan is at the pinnacle level of the Lord God, the probability of his success will be greatly reduced.

After all, the comprehensive combat power of his strongest state is only infinitely close to the peak of the main god, and has not yet reached the level of the peak of the main god.

If you encounter a demon **** at the peak level of the main god, it will be extremely tricky, and it may even fail to pass the level.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng felt a little uneasy.

Besides, he thought of another thing.

That is the reward for the third level, what will it be?

Wouldn't it still be Daogu Dan and Shenmai Dan? 19

The Dao Bone Pill he refined has accumulated 24 pieces.

There are also 24 Shenmai Pills.

And the refining limit of Daogu Pill and Shenmai Pill is 30 pieces.

If the reward of the third level is still Daogu Dan and Shenmai Dan, his strength improvement will be limited.

Perhaps, there will be new rewards in the third level.

Of course, his demand for Daogu Dan and Shenmai Dan is still enormous.

He can't take it, and he can also use it for Xiao Luan'er and other subordinates.

In particular, Qiyue, Qingchengzi, and Yuxuanji have a low chance of getting a god-level rating.

Even Xiao Luan'er and Feng Xi may not be able to obtain a god-level evaluation.

Only Di Jiang and Jumang are more likely to get a god-level evaluation.

If possible, Qin Feng also wants to earn more Daogu Dan and Shenmai Dan, and give them to these subordinates, so that they can all get god-level evaluation.

After all, Qiyue and the others were also his most important confidants and played an extremely important role in his future development.

Naturally, he has to train with all his strength!

Just when Qin Feng was thinking about it, Tiandao sent a reminder

„ÄêCountdown is over! On to the third level! „Äë

huh~!

I saw a flash of white light, and Qin Feng disappeared into the hall.

In the next second, he appeared in a new world!

It was a huge ocean world.

There is a giant island in the ocean, thousands of miles in radius, like a continent.

At this moment, Qin Feng was staying above the island.

When he looked down, he saw the trees on the island were towering, lush and full of life.

Looking closely at the woods, there are all kinds of exotic flowers and plants, as well as spiritual fruits, and there is a refreshing fragrance in the air.

Among them, there are many spirit flowers and spirit fruits of the demigod level.

Seeing this scene, Qin Feng's eyes lit up.

These exotic flowers and fruits are useless to him, but they are useful to Xiao Luan'er and others, and they are even more useful to ordinary Long Yuan disciples.

If he harvests these exotic flowers and plants, it will definitely be a big harvest!

However, Qin Feng was not in a hurry to harvest.

He vaguely felt that the giant island in front of him, although it looked beautiful, gave people a very dangerous feeling.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng took a deep breath and looked around cautiously.

"Hey! Where is it?"

Soon, his eyes fell on the east side of the island.

Where there is a depression, covered by the jungle.

Above the depression, there was an altar, which was covered by a white protective cover.
