However, he did not dare to linger.

He still has to compete with nearly a hundred people for the top ten spots!

Thinking of this, he ate the spirit fruit in a big mouthful.

The juice is in the throat, sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, salty, and has a variety of tastes, which is full of aftertastes.

The taste is very unique!

Immediately, he ate his mouthfuls and finished the spirit fruit in a few mouthfuls.

It didn't take long for his body to change...

Ha ha!

Qin Feng was very excited.

Even better, except for the bloodline talent, all the other talents are above C rank.

After reading the data, Qin Feng finally had confidence.

Then, he strode to the front altar.

He wants to unleash the evil spirits for the final battle!

Chapter 88 The Great War

Soon, Qin Feng stepped onto the altar.

The altar is full of vicissitudes, its shape is hexagonal, and each corner has a black rune column.

There is also a rune column in the center of the altar.

Exactly seven!

There is a hole at the top of each rune column, the size of a ping pong ball.

"This slot should be filled with dark spar-!"

Qin Feng walked to the nearest rune column.

He brushed off the dust on the slot, took out a dark spar, and put it into the slot.

Click~!

A soft sound!

The dark spar fell into the hole and groove, and it was a perfect fit.

Om~!

In the next second, the rune column trembled slightly, and a faint silver light lit up.

Sure enough!

Qin Feng was delighted and hurried to the second one.

Om~! Om~! Om~!

Just like that, the rune pillars were lit up.

In the blink of an eye, all seven rune columns were lit up.

The entire altar lit up with a dazzling aura, and the power of the seal was rapidly weakening.

roar~! roar~! roar~!

At the same moment, under the altar, the roar of the resentful devil came out, which was earth-shattering.

The whole village was shaking violently.

Bang~!

A loud bang!

The altar exploded.

A troll broke out of the altar.

[Task reminder: Qin Feng, a novice, unleashed a demon of resentment! „Äë

As soon as this prompt came out, the entire chat channel was fried.

Everyone started to get nervous.

They knew that Qin Feng was going to fight the devil to the death.

At the same time, above the square.

Qin Feng looked at the resentful demon in front of him with full attention.

It was a monster with a height of nine feet and the head of a sheep.

It was wearing black-patterned armor, and black smoke billowed all over its body.

[Monster]: Resentful Demon (Emperor Level)

Fuck it~!

The combat power is 71 stars!

This monster's combat power is 15 stars higher than his!

"Huh! Emperor level?!"

Qin Feng also discovered that the information on the resentful demon displayed the emperor level, not the king level.

It turns out that above the king level is the emperor level.

This was the first time he faced an emperor-level monster.

Can he win?

Qin Feng couldn't help clenching the handle of the knife.

roar~!

At this moment, the resentful demon roared in the sky and looked down at Qin Feng.

Those scarlet eyes are full of anger!

It was this human who killed all its men and ruined its hundreds of years of hard work.

It will tear this human to shreds!

roar~!

Another roar.

The magic power of the resentful demon broke out and instantly enveloped the audience.

Boom~!

The next second, it slapped Qin Feng with a palm.

Boom~Long~Long!

In the blink of an eye, the giant palm reached the top of Qin Feng's head, covering the sky with its might.

Qin Feng quickly flashed.

Swish~!

Only an afterimage remained in the field.

Bang~!

The resentful demon slapped the empty palm.

Suddenly, the ground cracked, gravel flew, and the whole village shook.

At the same time as the resentful demon slapped the air, Qin Chuan seized the opportunity and slashed at the demon's arm.

Swish~!

The dazzling knife light lit up in the dark night!

The Demon Eye was shocked.

The speed of this man is too fast.

Not only did it fail to get a shot, but it was also used to counterattack.

And its weakness is its slow speed, which cannot be avoided at this time.

At the moment, it has a thought.

Click~! Click~! Click~!

At that moment, a layer of black crystal profound armor condensed on its magic arm.

Kacha~!

A sound of gold and iron!
