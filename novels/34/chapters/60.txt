This is also the care of heaven for human beings.

Even though the initial strength of human beings is very weak, human talent awakens early and can wear equipment.Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

In the later stage, the human beings can narrow the gap with the beasts.

It can even rely on equipment to overwhelm beasts of the same rank.

At the moment, Qin Feng gladly put on the wrist guards, one on each of his left and right arms.

Suddenly, a strange energy came from the wristband, which improved his physique.

His overall strength has improved a bit!

It feels so comfortable!

After rejoicing, Qin Feng opened the second bronze treasure chest.

Qin Feng quickly put on the dragon elephant bracelet, and the white light suddenly lit up, and a majestic energy came from the bracelet and rushed to his whole body...

The head is a human weakness and must be protected!

Besides, this helmet is silver in its entirety, engraved with divine lines, and covers the face and cheeks. Even the eyes are protected by two brown chips.

It can be described as a 360-degree defense without dead ends!

At the moment, Qin Feng happily put on the battle helmet.

Suddenly, he was armed from top to bottom, it could be said that he was armed to the teeth.

His strength also skyrocketed a lot, which made him feel uneasy.

Qin Feng is overjoyed!

The Dragon Elephant King's armor is silver throughout, with divine patterns all over it, and it is extremely exquisite. It is much more imposing than the Bear King's armor, and it is not comparable at all.

At the moment, Qin Feng took off the Bear King armor and put on the Dragon Elephant King armor.

Suddenly, his temperament changed greatly, and his strength skyrocketed.

At this moment, the Dragon Elephant King Armor, the Dragon Elephant Battle Helmet, the Dragon Elephant Bracers, and the Dragon Elephant Bracelet shone with silver light in the sunlight, as if there was aura flowing.

A breeze blows!

Qin Feng stands in the wind, like a silver armored **** of war, handsome and compelling!

However, it's not over yet.

There is also a silver treasure chest that has not been opened.

Now, he goes on...

When the spiritual liquid enters his throat, it turns into majestic energy, which quickly washes through his whole body and penetrates into every cell of his...

Suddenly, his whole body blood boiled, from the inside to the outside, from the bone marrow to the skin, if it was burned by the flames, the pain would be unbearable!

It really worked!

Finally, there is a talent that reaches C rank!

C-level talent is extremely rare!

Of the 1,000 people in the entire 911 village, Liu Xuan alone had an innate sense of this level of talent.

Qin Feng relies on endless extraction to obtain a variety of talents, but none of them reach the C level.

Now, he finally has a talent that reaches C rank!

[Reminder: It is detected that your fire talent reaches C rank, and the power of the fire you release is doubled]
