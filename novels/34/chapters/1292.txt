At this time, the voice of the Azure Dragon Domain Lord sounded again...

"Brother Qin Feng, when you go to the Daluo Heavenly Realm this time, don't forget to be promoted to the Main God Realm! If you are promoted to the Main God Realm, it is estimated that your comprehensive combat power will be close to half a step of consummation!"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord kindly reminded him.

Qin Feng smiled without saying a word.

After his retreat this time, his strength has soared!

The comprehensive strength is equivalent to the threshold of half-step Great Perfection!

If you break through to the main **** realm again, the comprehensive strength should be able to sweep most of the half-step perfection.

Obviously, the Azure Dragon Domain Master still doesn't understand his progress!

For these, Qin Feng naturally won't say it.

At the moment, Qin Feng said with a smile: "This time, I will go to the Daluo Tianjing and be promoted to the main **** realm. It is also one of my tasks. In fact, not only me, but also some of my subordinates will also go together!"

As soon as the voice fell, Qin Feng waved his hand!

huh~! huh~! huh~!

Suddenly, white light flashed in the field!

Twelve people including Dijiang, Jumang, Zhurong, Gonggong, Houtu, Tianwu, Hongyun, Xiaoluaner, Qiyue, Fengxi, Yuxuanji, Qingchengzi all showed up!

"Dad! Daddy!"

"Owner!"

As soon as Di Jiang and others appeared, they happily greeted Qin Feng.

Seeing this, the kings of gods were a little stunned!

The Azure Dragon Domain Master was also quite surprised, especially when he saw Di Jiang, Jumang and others, all of them were young, only six or seven years old.

The last born Houtu, Tianwu, and Hongyun were only two or three years old.

He was suddenly worried!

Qin Feng went to the Daluo Tianjing assessment this time, but it was going to be a fierce competition.

Now, with so many little babies, he is afraid that he will be dragged down!

With this in mind, the Azure Dragon Domain Master gently reminded him.

"Brother Qin Feng, you children are still young! I'm afraid it will be very difficult to participate in the promotion of the main **** so early. After all, it is extremely difficult to promote from the real **** to the main god. It can be said to be one in a thousand miles!"

"If you want Qing to see, you might as well let them practice for another hundred years and wait for the next assessment before participating in the promotion of the Lord God!"

As soon as these words fell, the kings of gods nodded slightly, feeling all right!

They also felt that Qin Feng was a drag with so many little babies!

Especially those two or three-year-old little dolls, even if they are in the real **** realm, how can their strength be stronger?

I'm afraid that they rely on the resources given by Qin Feng to forcibly upgrade to the real **** realm, and their real strength should be very weak.

Qin Feng naturally heard the meaning of the Azure Dragon Domain Lord!

Not only him, but the little guys such as Di Jiang and Jumang also heard it, and they pouted unwillingly.

This Azure Dragon Domain Master also underestimated them!

At this time, Qin Feng smiled: "Brother Qinglong, don't worry! My children and my subordinates are all good! This time I am promoted to the main **** realm, I shouldn't need to worry about it!"

"Really? But when Qing looked at these little dolls, they looked like they were only two or three years old!"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord couldn't help but look at Houtu, Tianwu, and Hongyun.

These three little dolls are the youngest in the field.

With the means of protection imposed by Qin Feng, the Azure Dragon Domain Lord can't see the depth of the three of them!

Seeing this, Qin Feng smiled slightly.

It seems that if the little guys are not allowed to show it, the Azure Dragon Domain Master will not be relieved.

Immediately, he said to Di Jiang and the others: "Just show it to the few of you! So that Brother Qinglong will be less worried!"

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

Hearing this, Di Jiang and others immediately understood, and they burst out with their own momentum!

At that moment, twelve majestic auras soared into the sky, and all of them reached the level of the king of gods, which was amazing!

Boom~~!

This time, the whole audience was dumbfounded!

Those **** kings are arrogant, and they don't look down on the real **** realm.

But now, Qin Feng's subordinates' momentum has all reached the level of the king of gods.

Even the weakest Tian Wu and Hong Yun have broken 200 million stars!

The strongest Dijiang and Jumang have broken 600 million stars!

Breaking 200 million stars, that is entering the middle stage of the **** king, stronger than many **** kings in the field!

Breaking the 600 million star rating means entering the Great Perfection of the God King, and not yet five people in the audience have reached it!

But among the children of Lord Qin Feng, two of them have broken through 600 million, and their realm is only the real **** realm!

Gosh!

It turns out that Lord Qin Feng's subordinates are all unborn geniuses!

At this moment, the whole place was dead silent!

Everyone stared blankly at Di Jiang and the others, unable to react for a while.

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord was also stunned for a while!

It was at this moment that Di Jiang and others regained their momentum.

Only then did the kings of gods relax, and couldn't help but look at Qin Feng.

At this moment, their eyes became complicated!

Not to mention anything else, just because Qin Feng has so many excellent children, it can be seen that Qin Feng is extremely extraordinary!

It seems that this Lord Qin Feng really has half-step eternal strength!

Thinking of this, the kings of gods looked at Di Jiang and others, and no one dared to underestimate them.

The look in Qin Feng's eyes was full of awe.

At this time, the owner of Qinglong also said a little embarrassedly: "Sorry! Sorry! Brother Qin Feng, Qing is underestimated! This is really a tiger father without a dog! With the strength of your children, you should be able to get a very high rank. The title of Lord God!"

Qin Feng's heart moved: "Brother Qinglong, is this Lord God also divided into grades?"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord smiled slightly: "Of course! The stronger the strength, the higher the rank of the Lord God you will get, and the more benefits you will get. The specific division will be known when you enter the Hall of Honor!"

Boom~Long~Long~!

As soon as those words fell, the sky above the Blue Star Realm shook violently.

Everyone was alarmed, and they all looked up, and saw a huge star gate lit with white light, slowly opening in the starry sky!

Click~! Click~! Click~!

In just a moment, the star gate was fully opened, revealing a white starry sky passage...

Qin Feng was delighted: "Brother Qinglong, the entrance is open! I should go in!"

The master of the Qinglong domain nodded happily: "Brother Qin Feng, Qing congratulates you on your victory!"

At the moment, after the group said goodbye, Qin Feng flew towards the entrance with Di Jiang and others...

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord and the Kings of the Gods are congratulating them from below!

After Qin Feng and his party entered the passage, the star gate was automatically closed...

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord looked at the direction in which Qin Feng and others disappeared, and was full of emotion!

The kings of the gods are also sighed!

For a long time, Venerable Ziyuan murmured: "Lord Domain Lord, do you think that after Lord Qin Feng comes out this time, the basic combat power can exceed 2.5 trillion?"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord pondered for a while and said, "It's a bit difficult! However, it's not hopeless!"

They didn't know that Qin Feng's combat power had already broken 2.5 trillion!

Moreover, Qin Feng's goal this time is to break 4 trillion, which is far beyond their imagination! righteous.

Chapter 956: Treasure Vault of Resources! Taixu Hongmeng!

However, after Qin Feng and his party entered the passage, they followed the passage and flew forward.

That passage is composed of countless white lights, which is very magical!

A quarter of an hour later, Qin Feng and others arrived at the end of the passage.

With a flash of white light, everyone passed through the door of light at the end of the passage and appeared in a temple hall.

This appearance, Qin Feng looked around, and saw the white light flashing around, and one figure after another appeared!FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm

In a blink of an eye, thousands of people appeared in the hall!

These are the players who came to participate in the test

"Dad! Daddy! Here we are!"

At this time, Xiao Luan's excited voice sounded beside Qin Feng.

"Yeah! This should be the Hall of Honor!"

Qin Feng smiled slightly and continued to look at the audience.

Soon, he saw a huge black stele in the center of the hall with golden inscriptions engraved on it.

At this moment, many players walked towards the monument

"Let's go and see!"

As soon as the voice fell, Qin Feng also walked towards the monument.

Di Jiang and others followed closely behind!

After a while, Qin Feng and others went to the bottom of the monument to watch.

At this time, hundreds of players have gathered under the **** monument, all of them are in the real **** realm!

These are all to participate in the promotion of the main **** realm!

It didn't take long for Qin Feng to read the content on the monument, showing a sudden look.

It turns out that there are three main halls in this 'Holy Hall'.

The first is the Hall of Gods, which is the place where the Lord God is promoted. As long as players are in the True God Realm, they can enter!

The second is the Hall of Star Lords, which is the place where the Star Lord will be assessed. Players who need to hold the 'Star Lord Assessment Order' can enter.

The third is the Merit Pavilion, which is where the Temple Mall is located, and where merit points can be exchanged for resources.

There are two ways to get merit points!

One is the main **** assessment, in which some merit points can be obtained.

One is the star master assessment, and you can also get some merit points in the assessment.

Of course, if the assessment fails, the merit value obtained will be reset to zero.

In addition, if a player has a 'Star Master Token' and a 'Domain Master Token', they can also exchange some merit points from the mall.

Seeing this, Qin Feng was quite excited!

He has the Domain Master Token of the Bright Domain Master in his hand, which is a mid-level Domain Master token, which should be able to exchange for a lot of meritorious value!

Domain master tokens are also divided into four grades: primary, intermediate, advanced, and super!

The higher the domain master token obtained, the more resources the star domain will get!

Just like the token of the Azure Dragon Domain Master, it is only a primary level!
