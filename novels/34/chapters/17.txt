【Your energy index increases by 20 points! 】

A white light descended from the sky and landed on Qin Feng's head...

In the next second, he was flooded with white light energy, and his strength, agility, physique, and energy skyrocketed...

After a while, the light dissipated.

Qin Feng opened his eyes in surprise.

Great!

His four-dimensional index has all skyrocketed!

The strength is greatly increased again!

At the moment, he couldn't wait to open his property panel.

【Name】: Qin Feng

[Level]: Level 3 (540/600)

[Occupation]: Level 1 Judge (10/100)

【Reputation】: 1

[Strength]: 60 (power crazy, D level)

[Agility]: 66 (speed enhancement, E level)

[Physical]: 68 (strengthen constitution, E level, anti-poison +100%)

[Energy]: 87 (supervision of vision, E grade; enhanced sense of smell, F grade)

[Born talent]: Endless extraction (SSS level),

[Skill]: Eye of True Sight

[Combat Strength Evaluation]: 6 stars

His combat strength evaluation has soared from 4 stars to 6 stars all at once.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

In terms of overall strength, he should be able to reach 8 stars.

This strength is really cool!

By the way, under the column of his level, there is another [Sacred Job] status column.

He is now a level 1 inquisitor (10/100).

As long as he collects 100 Judgment Points, he can be promoted to a Level 2 Judge, and at that time he can increase the 4D Index, and his strength will increase greatly.

That's the benefit of hidden vocation, and nobody else has it.

The more Qin Feng thinks about it, the more cool it gets!

[Succeeded in beheading mummies (evil things)! Explosive Skill Divine Seal! 】

what!

Fuck it~!

Items exploded again!

Qin Feng was surprised, turned his head to look, and saw a white light on the body of the mummy.

Then, a golden seal appeared.

He hurried forward and picked up the seal

[Skill Divine Seal: If you have the corresponding talent, you can integrate this Divine Seal and get the third-order skill—Beast Control. 】

Wow~!

It's actually a Tier 3 skill!

Qin Feng was overjoyed.

He has only mastered one skill now, that is, the Eye of True Sight, which is only a first-order skill.

Beast Mastery is obviously more powerful.

If he can master this skill, his strength will increase greatly.

At the moment, his mind is immersed in the skill divine seal, and new information emerges...

[Reminder 1: It is necessary to awaken the D-level talent-intention enhancement, and you can initially master this skill, but to truly successfully control the beast, you also need the assistance of the beast-controlling pill. 】

[Reminder 2: If you awaken the C-level talent—the six senses are connected, you can successfully control the beast without the beast control pill. 】

To learn this skill, you must at least awaken a D-level mind-strengthening talent.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng hurriedly walked to the side of the mummified corpse and began to extract...

A burst of white light came on!

【Endless extraction success! Get the D-level talent - Intent Enhancement! 】

Sure enough, there is an intention to strengthen the talent!

Qin Feng was delighted, and hurriedly concentrated his thoughts and began to fuse the skill seal...

Om~!

The skill divine seal turned into a dazzling golden light and flew into his body...

[Skill Divine Seal is successfully integrated, and you have obtained the third-order skill—Beast Control. 】

In Qin Feng's mind, the skill column automatically appeared.

[Skills]: Eye of True Sight (Tier 1), Animal Control (Tier 3).

Finally got another skill!

He was overjoyed.

However, he still needs the Beast Control Pill to successfully control the beast.

That beast control pill should be eaten by the beasts, the purpose is to make the beasts easier to control.

And the first-order spirit grass in this full valley should be the material for refining the Beast Control Pill.

But he can't refine the Beast Control Pill!

Thinking of this, he rummaged through the mummified corpse.

He wanted to find the formula of the Beast Control Pill, or the Beast Control Pill.

After a while, he looked disappointed.

There is no pill formula on the corpse, and there is no animal control pill.

It seemed that there was only one last way for him to really use the animal control technique, and that was to awaken his C-level talent—the six senses connected.

Awakening the six senses is not difficult, as long as all the six sense talents are awakened, they will automatically merge to generate a C-level talent—the six senses are connected.

Now, in his six senses.

Mind has a D-level talent - mind strengthening;

Vision has an E-level talent - visual superlative;

The sense of smell has an F-level talent - enhanced sense of smell.

As long as he awakens the three talents of taste, touch, and hearing, he can automatically obtain a C-level talent—the six senses are connected.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng calmed down and looked forward to the future.

He mastered endless extraction.

It will be a matter of time before the three talents of taste, touch and hearing are acquired.

Thinking about it this way, he can use the spirit grass that fills the valley directly, and he doesn't need to keep it for refining the Beast Control Pill.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng was in a good mood.

However, he did not immediately go to pick the spirit grass.

There are more harvests now, waiting for him to harvest!

I saw him striding towards the bodies of the three beasts and began to extract...

【Endless extraction success! Gain 3 Strength Attributes! 】

【Endless extraction success! Gain 3 Dexterity Attributes! 】

【Endless extraction success! Get 3 points of physical attributes! 】

So cool!

Mutated beasts are different!

Three gave him 9 attributes, which made him feel comfortable.

Afterwards, he walked to Liu Yunchang's body and began to extract...

【Endless extraction success! Get the D-level talent - Fire Manipulation! 】

Another talent in hand!

This is the third D-level talent Qin Feng has obtained.

Resisting the excitement in his heart, he began to extract the white body again...

【Endless extraction success! Get the D-level talent - super speed! 】

[Reminder: Your E-level talent—speed enhancement, is automatically promoted to D-level talent—speed superization. 】

[Super speed: triple the speed! 】

Fuck it~!

It's really not easy for a human being to rise to level 2 in such a short period of time.

What this white man awakened was the D-level speed talent.

The success of this extraction allowed Qin Feng's speed talent to automatically evolve to D-level.

In this way, he has mastered four D-level talents.

They are D-level superpower, D-level speed, D-level idea enhancement, and D-level flame control.

Even though his combat evaluation is still 6 stars, his overall strength has been greatly improved, at least reaching the 8-star limit.

This feeling of soaring strength is really wonderful!

Of course, this time the harvest is more than that.

Thinking of this, he walked towards those spirit grasses again.

Chapter 19 The strength has skyrocketed, the uncrowned king!

Qin Feng looked around, and there were about forty plants in the valley.

He walked to the first spirit grass, and the Eye of True Sight scanned it away...

【Name】: Elderberry

[Grade Rank]: First-Order Spirit Grass

[Efficacy]: It can be used as medicine for alchemy, which can strengthen bones and improve physical fitness.

"It turned out to be a spirit grass that strengthens the direction of physique!"

He murmured something in his heart, then reached out and stroked the elderberry...

After a while, his palm lit up with white light.

The elderberry withered rapidly at a speed visible to the naked eye, and shrank and died in just a few seconds...

At this time, Qin Feng turned his palm over, but there was a small cloud of milky white spiritual fluid in his palm, exuding a faint grassy fragrance.

【Endless extraction success! You have extracted the essence of spirit grass from elderberry! 】
