Longyuan Village has been upgraded to a level 2 village, and victory is in sight.

Immediately, he opened the village chief operation interface to check the conditions for building the guardian altar.

At the same moment, people cheered in every corner of Longyuan Village.

They also received the message of Heavenly Dao.

Even in the village of Sangqi, there were cheers one after another.

Because the Qi clan also know the significance of upgrading the village.

Before they knew it, their interests were tightly bound to Longyuan Village.

At this moment, the entire chat channel was full of cheers, and everyone chatted with great excitement.

"Haha! Achieved! All upgrade conditions have been met!!"

"Yeah! So excited! Now, we are about to build the guardian altar. As long as the altar is built, we can upgrade the village to level 2."

"Everyone, when we upgrade to a level 1 village, each of us gets 50 attribute rewards. When we upgrade to a level 2 village, we can get 100 attribute rewards."

"Upstairs, you made a mistake! Don't you forget that the difficulty of leveling up in our village has doubled, so the reward is also doubled, which means that we are rewarded with 200 points, not 100 points!"

"Yes! It's 200 points! If I get such a reward right away, I'll wake up laughing at night!"

"Haha! I've been so excited for a long time!"

"Brothers, don't get excited! Next, wait for the boss to announce the construction of the guardian altar."

"Yes! I don't know what materials are needed to build the guardian altar?"

"I don't know! Just wait for the boss to announce!"

"When will the boss announce it?! I can't wait!"

"Uuuu! Little sister is also waiting anxiously! Brother village chief, why haven't you come out yet?!"

"Don't rush everyone! The boss must be busy!"

This sentence just fell, and a message popped up at the top of the chat channel.

[Longyuan Village Announcement: List of Construction Conditions for the Guardian Altar]

[100 units of stone (level 0 resources)]

[100 units of wood (level 0 resource)]

[20 units of iron ore (level 0 resource)]

[10 units of the bones of the king and beasts]

As soon as the announcement was made, everyone saw the information and started talking about it.

"It turned out to be these materials! We have both stone and iron ore ready-made, but the wood is far from enough."

"Yeah! There is no wood in the resource bank. As soon as the wood is released, it will be exchanged by everyone."

"At present, the wood resources in our village have not been completely relieved, and everyone will continue to work hard."

"Upstairs, the wood is easy to say. How do you get the bones of the king and beast?"UppTodatùíÜd frùíêm n√¥/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

"In the resource channel, there are five or six corpses of king-level beasts, exchange them, take out their bones, or there will be."

"Yes! However, to build the guardian altar, 10 units of king beast bones are needed. Are five or six corpses enough?"

"I'm afraid it's hard to say! It's too hard to meet king-level beasts. If the bones are not assembled together, I'm afraid our village's upgrade progress will be delayed again."

As soon as these words fell, Qin Feng's voice sounded in the ears of all the villagers.

Qin Feng's voice also sounded in the ears of Qishan, Qiyue and other Qi family members.

Qin Feng: "Everyone, about the materials for the construction of the guardian altar, I have posted it on the top of the chat channel in the form of an announcement, and you can check it at any time."

Qin Feng: "Judging from the current situation, the most in short supply is the 0-order wood. From now on, everyone will suspend the exchange of the wood donated to the resource bank. After the construction of the guardian altar, everyone will exchange it again."

Qin Feng: "At present, the first goal is to build a guardian altar. In addition, the people who hurt Qi Village and the villagers of Longyuan Village, as long as the conditions allow, will go to logging to speed up the collection of wood."

Qin Feng: "As for the bones of the king-level beasts, I will donate a batch of the corpses of the king beasts, and you will deal with them and take the bones. That's how things are arranged, let's work together!"

After this arrangement, Qin Feng quit the permission channel.

When the people received the order, they acted immediately.

In the village of Sangqi, Qishan even mobilized the whole clan.

Men and women, young and old, all go to the woods.

And around their village, there are forest resources everywhere.

As soon as the people from the Sangqi Village joined, the collection speed of the forest resources increased exponentially.

But on the other side, somewhere in the forest.

After Qin Feng arranged the task, he entered the trading channel.

After some operations, white light flashed in front of him, and there were more than twenty corpses, all of which were the corpses of king-level beasts.

Levels vary from level 1 to level 7.

None of the corpses of king beasts above level 8 have been seen.

However, Qin Feng was already satisfied.

So many king beast corpses are enough to provide the king beast bones needed to guard the altar.

Immediately, he stepped forward to extract the corpses of those king beasts.

It turned out that the corpses of the king beasts were purchased by him in the regional channel using energy stone resources.

Under the temptation of the power stone, his business of buying the corpse of the king beast was very popular.

For a period of time, he has not checked it either, relying entirely on others to automatically trade.

Even so, more than 20 pieces have been acquired unknowingly.

Soon, Qin Feng extracted the corpses of those king beasts and obtained more than 80 attributes in total.

The corpses of several kinds of king beasts were all extracted by him.

And his combat power has also been raised to 201 stars unknowingly.

This made Qin Feng very satisfied.

Afterwards, he donated the corpses of those king beasts, and the villagers would take care of the bones.

After doing that, Qin Feng continued to rush to Tongtian Lake.

This time, his strength has skyrocketed, and his speed has doubled and a half.

In less than an hour, Qin Feng arrived near Tongtian Lake.

The Temple of Vientiane is by the Tongtian Lake.

Therefore, he will soon be able to see the Temple of Vientiane.

At this thought, Qin Feng was a little excited, and at the same time a little nervous.

At this moment, Liu Xuan sent a private chat, reminding him that he had enough materials to build the guardian altar.

Qin Feng opened the resource channel and saw that it was true.

He was overjoyed.

Because Longyuan Village will soon be upgraded to a level 2 village

Chapter 151: Long Yuan has been upgraded, and his strength has skyrocketed!

At the moment, Qin Feng began to exchange materials for the construction of the guardian altar.

100 units of stone, 100 units of wood, 20 units of iron ore, and 10 units of bones of the king and beast.

After this exchange, he spent nearly a thousand contribution points.

Today, he still has 2,736 contribution points left.

However, it's all worth it!

The guardian altar is a public building.

For building public buildings, the village chief can get rewards from Heaven, which is fully worthy of the contribution points spent.

It can be said that absolute value for money!

"I don't know if there are too many teleportation arrays for the rewards of heaven given by building guardian altars?"

Qin Feng muttered in his heart.

He was both expectant and nervous.

Then, he pressed a button to build.

At the same moment, in the chat channel, everyone was already anxiously waiting.

Liu Xuan: "Brothers, I have reminded the boss that he will build a guardian altar right away."

"That's great!"

"Hey! Everyone, there is movement in the village! The whole village is shaking!"

"The boss must be building the altar! I'll go back and see!"

"Haha! I'll go take a look too!"

At the moment, in every corner of Longyuan Village, white light flashed continuously.

All the villagers chose to return to the village with one click.

When they returned to Novice Village, everyone felt that the entire Longyuan Village was trembling, and there was a huge roar from the square.

At the moment, everyone rushed to the square.

As soon as they arrived at the square, everyone saw a huge altar with a diameter of more than thirty feet, slowly rising from the ground.

At the same time, there was also a rumbling roar around the village.

Ten 883 three huge rune stone pillars also slowly rose from the ground.

Boom~Long~Long!

Earth shakes!

The village trembles!

All the villagers looked up at the rune stone pillars and were amazed.

In this way, it lasted for a full quarter of an hour before the altar was completely completed, and all the vibrations gradually subsided.

I saw that the guardian altar was as high as three feet, and there was a huge rune stone pillar in the center, which was full of divine patterns, and it was ten feet high.

Looking at the thirteen rune stone pillars around the village, they are all more than ten feet high.

Om~! Om~! Om~!

Immediately afterwards, the guardian altar and the thirteen rune stone pillars were automatically activated, and they all lit up with dazzling aura.

Suddenly, the altar vibrated, and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth resonated at the same time!

Om~!

Finally, a huge protective mask was formed, covering the entire village!

The Guardian Altar is activated!

The protective mask is formed!

Tiandao also sent a reminder.

As soon as the news came out, the square cheered.

At the same time, Qin Feng also received a reminder from Tiandao.
