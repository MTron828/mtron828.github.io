Qin Feng looked at it for a while and had a preliminary understanding of Zixiao Palace.

The Zixiao Palace is connected to the space of the Judgment God Realm, so it can directly reach the Zixiao Palace from the Judgment God Realm.

And Zixiao Palace is divided into: Zitian Palace and Yunxiao Palace!

The Zitian Temple was originally the residence of the Lord of the Hongyuan Universe, and it was also the place where the inheritance of Zixiao was assessed.

The inheritance of Zixiao is one of the inheritances of the Lord of the Universe.V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

The inheritance of the lord of the universe is divided into two parts, namely the inheritance of Zixiao and the inheritance of the Three Realms.

The inheritance of the three realms, namely the inheritance of the heavenly realm, the inheritance of the human realm, and the inheritance of the **** realm, were obtained by Rahu, Tianzun, and Dajitian respectively.

The inheritance of Zixiao is hidden in the Zitian Temple, which is above the inheritance of the Three Realms. So far, no one has the ability to obtain it.

In addition, another area of ‚Äã‚ÄãZixiao Palace is Yunxiao Palace.

Yunxiao Palace is the place where the **** king is promoted in the Hongyuan universe.

If you want to be promoted to God King, you have to participate in the Aspiration Assessment.

Promoted to the False God Realm, you can get the Godhead!

Promoted to the real **** realm, you can get the **** position!

Promoted to the main **** realm, you can get the gods!

To be promoted to the realm of the gods is called aspiring, which is the meaning of asking the peak.

To break through the realm after the God King, you have to rely on your own cultivation and enlightenment.

Those who attain enlightenment can break the shackles and step into half-step eternity!

Those who do not understand will be permanently stuck in the realm of gods and kings, and it will be difficult to rise even an inch!

What Qin Feng has to complete now is the last realm assessment, seeking the best!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng strode towards the Yunxiao Palace

According to the reminder of the **** tablet, only players in the main **** realm and the **** king realm are eligible to enter the Yunxiao Palace.

Above the realm of the gods, you cannot enter!

As long as he entered the Yunxiao Palace, he would not worry about Lu Yadaojun who came later.

When he comes out of the Yunxiao Palace again, he will have the strength to not be afraid of the eternal power.

Of course, these are all Qin Feng's own guesses.

After he was promoted to God King, it remains to be verified whether he can withstand the three consecutive blows of the low-rank Eternal Realm!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng became a little nervous again, and the speed of walking towards Yunxiao Pavilion was also faster.

At the same time, Starry Sky Plaza.

Lu Yadaojun finally arrived.

At this moment, he fell from the sky and landed on the square.

The half-step great powers hurriedly bowed their hands to salute!

"I've been waiting to see Lord Daojun!"

At this moment, all the great masters held their breaths, not even daring to breathe.

Lu Yadaojun looked gloomy and gloomy, glanced at everyone, and finally his eyes fell on the entrance of Zixiao Palace.

At this moment, he was secretly annoyed at Qin Feng, who had just entered, and dared not give him face.

With this in mind, he turned to look at the great powers.

"Who is the young man who just entered?"

As soon as these words fall, everyone can look at each other face to face.

These people don't know Qin Feng, and they also want to know what the strange young man is.

After a moment of silence in the arena, the Taibai Domain Master took a deep breath and stepped forward boldly.

"Master Hui Daojun, that person seems to be a newly promoted Lord of the Sanctuary!"

"The Lord of the Sanctuary?! Hehe! The strength of the Lord of the Sanctuary is generally not strong, and even some God Kings have the opportunity to become the Lord of the Sanctuary. But that kid just now is the Lord of the Holy Land. How did he become the Lord of the Sanctuary? Lord's?"

Lu Yadaojun expressed the doubts in his heart again.

"This... Lord Daojun, that kid's realm is not high. However, Bai has tested his consciousness before, and he should have reached the half-step Great Perfection level, which is stronger than Bai!"

The domain master of Taibai didn't hide anything, and he knew everything about Daojun Lu Ya.

"His consciousness has reached the half-step Great Perfection level? Are you right?"

Daojun Lu Ya was slightly surprised.

The domain master of Taibai smiled bitterly: "Bai does not dare to lie! Therefore, Bai suspects that the guy used some kind of mysterious technique to disguise his half-step Great Perfection as the main **** realm!"

Lu Yadaojun nodded slightly: "Well! It's possible!"

As soon as these words fell, all the great powers agreed.

"I also think that the young man is disguising his realm!"

"That's right! The old man has always felt strange, how can a master **** realm be qualified for the assessment!"

"So, that young man is a grandstanding, and he wants to use such a small trick to attract everyone's attention!"

"Haha! Such behavior! Extremely childish!"

At this moment, all the players felt that Qin Feng was disguising the realm of cultivation.

He was very disdainful of Qin Feng's behavior, and all kinds of ridicule came one after another.

Everyone despised Qin Feng's behavior!

Only the Azure Dragon Domain Lord has a weird expression!

He really knows that Qin Feng is the main **** realm!

These guys are so opinionated!

To put it bluntly, they just underestimated Master Qin Feng, thinking that it is impossible for the main gods to be on an equal footing with them, let alone surpass them.

At the same time, they ridiculed Qin Feng in order to please Lu Yadaojun.

Everyone can see that Lu Yadaojun is very dissatisfied with Qin Feng.

Sure enough, when Lu Yadaojun heard the ridicule from everyone, the corners of his mouth twitched slightly and he was quite satisfied.

Immediately, he sneered: "It doesn't matter if the kid is half-stepped to perfection, the Daoist will go in today to see, why does the boy dare to see the Daoist and not worship?!"

As soon as the voice fell, Daojun Lu Ya walked towards the entrance of Zixiao Palace.

Many players' eyes lit up, secretly thinking that Lu Yadaojun was going to Zixiao Palace to find trouble with that kid.

In the eyes of all the players, there was gloating.

They wished that Daojun Lu Ya could trouble Qin Feng.

That way, they're much safer!

With the strength of Lu Yadaojun's low-grade Eternal Realm, he can make three illegal shots in Zixiao Palace.

If Lu Yadaojun shoots Qin Feng once, then there are two chances left, and they will naturally be safer.

Among the crowd, only the Azure Dragon Domain Lord's face changed slightly, and he was extremely worried!

Soon, Lu Yadaojun stepped into the gate of light, entered the Zixiao Palace, and disappeared from everyone's sight...

Everyone can breathe a sigh of relief!

Without the presence of Daojun Lu Ya, the invisible pressure disappeared.

Afterwards, everyone's faces showed schadenfreude.

"Everyone, Lu Yadaojun went in! It is estimated that it was trouble to find that kid!"

"Yeah! That kid is too arrogant! Daojun came, and he dared not to worship! Thinking that if he pretended to be the main god, Daojun would not care about him?"

"Haha! I guess that kid still doesn't know the character of Lord Lu Ya! Among all Daojuns, Lu Yadaojun has the best face! That little thief dares not to give Daojun face, isn't he courting death!"

"Everyone, there are few gossips! Let's go in and have a look! So as not to be late, we won't be able to see the scene of Daojun killing that kid!"

"That's right!"

As soon as these words fell, all the bigwigs walked towards the door of light.

Suddenly, white light flashes at the entrance light gate!

One big guy after another, entered it.

In just a moment, more than 100 players all entered, including the Azure Dragon Domain Master.

After everyone entered the hall of Zixiao Palace, they saw Lu Yadaojun at a glance, but did not see Qin Feng.

The whole hall was empty and seemed a little quiet!

The big guys were suddenly a little surprised!

No way?

It was only a few seconds apart, and they didn't see Qin Feng when they came in.

Could it be that the kid was killed by Dao Jun?

That speed is too fast!

What is even more puzzling is that there is no **** smell in the air!

Thinking of this, everyone looked at Daojun Lu Ya.

I saw Lu Yadaojun staring blankly at the entrance of Yunxiao Palace with a complicated expression.

Seeing this scene, everyone looked at each other.

After a while, the Taibai Domain Master carefully stepped forward to ask.

"Lord Daojun, where is that kid? Why didn't you see him? Could it be that you have already killed him to scum?"

Hearing this, Lu Yadaojun looked at the Taibai Domain Lord with complicated eyes.

After a while, he sighed: "You may not believe it! The moment Ben Daojun came in, he happened to see that kid enter the Yunxiao Palace!"

What? !

Boom~!

As soon as these words came out, the whole audience was shocked!

Everyone's eyes widened!

Oh my God!

Those who can enter the Yunxiao Palace must be below the God King Realm.

In other words, that kid is really only the main **** realm!

After a long time, everyone recovered from the shock and sighed.

"I really didn't expect that that kid is actually the Lord God Realm!"

"Yeah! It's amazing that even a main **** can have half-step Great Perfection consciousness!"

The crowd was amazed!

Many people's voices are sour.

At this time, Lu Yadaojun also sighed: "I didn't expect that this Daojun could meet a master **** realm player and be eligible to participate in the Zixiao inheritance assessment! It's really a long time to see!"

The domain master of Taibai said a little sourly: "Sir Daojun, the main **** realm is only the main **** realm after all, and it won't be strong! Don't look at that kid's good sense, if the real strength is only limited, maybe it's not accurate. Half-step eternity!"

Hearing this, all the bigwigs nodded slightly, expressing their approval.

In the crowd, only the Azure Dragon Domain Lord pouted, a little disdainful.

These guys just underestimate Mr. Qin Feng!

At this time, Lu Yadaojun didn't take it seriously and said: "Taibai is right! Well, I'll wait here. He will come out of Yunxiao Palace sooner or later! What kind of power is that?!"

Hearing this, the eyes of all the bigwigs lit up, showing schadenfreude.
