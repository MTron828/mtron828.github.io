Chapter 321 The harvest is overwhelming, the situation is laid out!

Thinking of the Shengwu assessment, Qin Feng was full of expectations.

As long as he completes the assessment, he can successfully establish the foundation, and many methods can be learned.

His strength will also skyrocket!

However, before that, he had to clean up the battlefield and deal with the trivial matters in front of him.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng also began to search for the corpses of the ground-level powerhouses for endless extraction.

At the same time, eight villages including Yuelong Village, Dengta Village, Ganges Village, and Cosmic Bangbang Village have begun to come alive.

In the alliance channel of the eight major villages, it is even more fiery.

Miyamoto Lang: "Yo Xi! It's finally dawn! The protection period is finally over! We can kill the people of Longyuan Village! Haha!"

Edward: "Oh! I've been waiting for this day for too long!"

Park Chengxin: "Haha! The thought of killing all the people in Longyuan Village makes me extremely excited! Smecta!"

Amir: "Friends, we have to hurry up! The prestige challenge is over in 11 hours. At the end of this, the locations of our eight villages will be known to the Yuan clan! That would be dangerous!"

Miyamoto Lang: "Yeah! The Yuan clan is a guardian force, and they are much more terrifying than Longyuan Village!"

Edward: "Oh! Of course! There are many prefecture-level powerhouses in those guardian forces, and we are not our opponents. But Longyuan Village is different, they are only a third-level village, and there are far fewer than us! It's not difficult to kill them all! "

Miyamoto Lang: "Suoga! Qin Feng of Longyuan Village should have a reputation of 200 points. After the reputation challenge is over, their village will not be exposed. Therefore, we want to occupy the nest and occupy Longyuan Village! Only then can we Live!"

Amir: "That damned Longyuan villager has been unsettled before, causing many 9th-level people to fall short of success and die in the assessment!"

Miyamoto Lang: "Yes! Many of my compatriots were killed by them! We want to kill them! We want to avenge our compatriots!"

Ruan Fu: "Everyone, we must kill all the people of the Dragon Kingdom and capture the Longyuan Village before the end of the prestige challenge. There are still 11 hours before the end of the challenge, everyone, hurry up and gather!"

Rami Miyamoto: "That's right! All the troops have gathered in Yuelong Village! Our Fuji Village is already in action!"

Gittas: "The army of Xiaowan Village has been assembled and is rushing to Yuelong Village!"

Amir: "The army of Shiva Village has been assembled and is rushing to Yuelong Village!"

Park Chengxin: "The army of Cosmic Bangbang Village has been assembled and is also heading to Yuelong Village."

Edward: "Oh! The army of our Beacon Village is gathering and will soon go to Yuelong Village."

Monessen: "Oh! Our Tuao Village is also gathering!"

John Page: "Our British Village is also gathering!"

At this moment, the eight major villages were all mobilized.

Among them, Fuji Village, Xiaowan Village, Shiva Village, Cosmic Bangbang Village, Dengta Village, Tu'ao Village, and Great Britain Village are all gathering troops and rushing to Yuelong Village.

Because Yuelong Village is the closest to Longyuan headquarters, it is only three or four hours away.

When the army is assembled in Yuelong Village, they will attack Longyuan Headquarters together...

At this moment, the morale of the Hachimura Alliance is extremely high, as if the victory is in hand, one by one excitedly discussing in the channel.

Even the leaders of the eight villages have already begun to discuss how to divide the territory of Longyuan Village after capturing Longyuan Village.

At the same time, in a remote corner of Yuelong Village.

Li Xianhu watched the chat channel silently, sneering in his heart.

These self-righteous guys!

They also thought that Longyuan was just a level 3 village.

Up to now, they still look down on Longyuan Village.

Today, Longyuan Village is a level 5 town with a population of more than 15,000.

The strong are like clouds inside!

This group of stupid pigs is delusional to attack Longyuan Town, which is simply courting death!

Li Xianhu sneered in his heart.

He completely despised this group of western white-skinned and white-skinned lackeys.

These dogs have always liked to belittle the people of the Dragon Kingdom, and they often underestimate the people of the Dragon Kingdom.

As he has Chinese blood, he is also unhappy!

In short, this group of white skins and their lackeys will soon taste the bitter fruit.

Thinking of this, Li Xianhu took out a piece of animal skin, wrote the latest intelligence information, and then traded it to Liu Yuan...

At the same moment, at the headquarters of the scorpion clan, the battlefield had been cleaned up.

At this moment, Qin Feng was standing beside the teleportation array with joy in his eyes.

Just now, he used the title deed card to bring the Qi clan's territory under his command.

He got another piece of land, still a medium-grade site, which allowed him to gain 3,000 points.

At present, his personal total points reached 13,000 points.

The total points of Longyuan Village reached 17,000 points.

Both scores are very good.

This also made him look forward to it even more. Twenty-four hours later, after the points list came out.

What will be the ranking of Longyuan Town?

And what about his personal standings?

In short, once the points list comes out, it will definitely cause many chain reactions and bring many benefits.

The rules of the ten thousand world hegemony will also begin to emerge.

Qin Feng is looking forward to it!

In addition to the gain of points, Qin Feng's other gains are also extremely rich.

The storage rings of more than 70 prefecture-level powerhouses, as well as the attribute points and skills extracted from them, made him a lot of money.

In addition, Long Yuan has also gained a lot from the top and bottom, and everyone has finished adding points.

After this operation, Longyuan Village has 31 more battle strengths and broke the 200-star level.

A 200-star level will feed Qin Feng 100 attributes, and 31 is 3100 points.

It puts him in a good mood!

Next, he should make some arrangements, and then go to the Temple of Vientiane.

"Liu Xuan! Qishan!"

"Subordinates are here!"

"The old man is here!"

Liu Xuan and Qishan stepped forward excitedly.

At this time, Longyuan Town was immersed in the joy after the war.

Everyone's harvest is great.

"The two of you make arrangements, let everyone return to the team, and all major strongholds must be stationed."

"Yes!"

Qishan quickly took orders.

Liu Xuan asked: "Boss, let's analyze it from the power map. This clan faces the border of the Cang clan in the east and the borders of the other major guardian forces in the west. The border of the Cang clan is already our territory, so don't think about it, it's mainly to the west. We have to guard against several major guardian forces."

"That is to say, the boundary of this clan, which is equivalent to the boundary of our Longyuan forces, needs to be guarded by heavy troops."

Qin Feng nodded slightly: "Indeed! Well, you lead 5,000 people to be stationed here. In addition, I arranged for the Moon Spirit clone to be stationed here as well."

Liu Xuan was overjoyed: "With the boss and a clone stationed, we can feel at ease."

Up to now, everyone in Longyuan Town knows that Qin Feng has four avatars.

Each clone has 60% of Qin Feng's strength.

Qin Feng's combat power is more than 5,000 stars, and 60% of his combat power is also 3,000 stars, reaching the threshold of the second level of heaven.

In other words, Qin Feng's four avatars all have the strength of the double threshold of heaven.

Let a heaven-level second-level powerhouse guard this place, naturally not afraid of the harassment of major guardian powers.

Unless it is a three-level powerhouse of the heavenly level!

And the powerhouses of the third level of heaven generally do not appear easily.

After arranging these trivial matters, Qin Feng plans to return to Tayue Town, and then rush to the Vientiane Temple from Tayue Town.

It was at this moment that Liu Yuan hurried over.

"Boss, I just got the news from Li Xianhu. The guys from Miyamoto Lang have already started to move. They are gathering troops in Yuelong Village. It is estimated that they will attack the headquarters of Longyuan Village in five or six hours."

Liu Yuan truthfully reported the military situation.Vissit novelbin(.)c.ùíêm for updates

He had already informed Qin Feng in advance about the secret insertion of Li Xianhu.

Hearing this, Liu Xuan on the side was immediately annoyed.

Immediately, Liu Xuan said: "Boss, those white-skinned pigs, Asan, Island slaves, and sticks are jumping horizontally again. Before we started, they jumped up first. If these dogs are not removed, it is really a big problem. !"

Qin Feng nodded slightly: "It's time to clean up these garbage in one fell swoop, there will be no future troubles!"

Liu Xuan said with joy: "Boss, this time, I'm going to **** them hard! Let them know the true strength of our Dragon Country people! With my temper, I really want to kill them all!"

As soon as these words fell, Qishan on the side became anxious.

"Master, you can't kill it! Now, the strength of our Longyuan Town has grown by leaps and bounds, and few people are willing to quarry, log, and mine. This has greatly delayed the upgrade progress of our Longyuan Town."

"According to the current progress, Longyuan Town will not be able to be promoted to level 6 town yet, so the old man suggested that Western Baipi and their lackeys should all be turned into slaves."

"Let these slaves go mining, logging, quarrying, and collecting various strategic resources for us. This arrangement is the best of both worlds."

Qin Feng smiled: "That's how it should be! Those dogs have no eyes, so let them be slaves for life and work hard for us in Longyuan Town. This is better than killing them to relieve hatred and benefit more."

Today, Qin Feng is very concerned about the upgrade of Longyuan Town.

Because Longyuan Town is upgraded to one level, the strength of all the townspeople will increase by 2.8, which will allow more people to break through to 200 stars.

Because only when the townsman's combat power breaks through to 200 stars can he get attribute feedback...

Immediately, he said: "Let's do it! Liu Yuan, you lead a 5,000-strong army back to the headquarters of Longyuan to garrison. I will arrange for the Mirage clone to follow and wait for the alliance army of their eight villages to come."

Liu Yuan was overjoyed: "Great! With a clone of the boss, we will definitely be able to capture them all!"

Qin Feng smiled without saying a word.

He sent a clone to go, one to capture those white-skinned people, and the other for Miyamoto Lang.

That Miyamoto Lang used to be known as the No. 1 powerhouse in District 1, with A-level space talent.

Qin Feng is determined to acquire this talent.

As long as Miyamoto Lang is killed and the Mirage clone extracts the corpse, he will be able to get the space talent.

In this way, Qin Feng arranged for Liu Xuan to lead 5,000 people to be stationed in the border of the Qi clan, and let Yueling clone guard.

Arrange for Liu Yuan to lead 5,000 people back to Longyuan headquarters, and let the Mirage clone to guard.

For the remaining 5,000 people, let Qishan mobilize them to guard each station.

After arranging these trivial matters, Qin Feng greeted Qiyue and left together in the teleportation formation.

They have to rush to the Vientiane Temple to participate in the Shengwu assessment.

Chapter 322 Shengwu assessment! The effect of the level!

A minute later, the teleportation array lit up on the square of Tayue Town.

The next second, Qin Feng and Qiyue appeared.

Today, Tayue is calm and quiet, the garrisoned army has not returned, only the guardian altar is running silently.
