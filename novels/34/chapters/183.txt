Colorful Balloons Take Flight

…

In this way, Qin Feng's ability value and judgment value skyrocketed again.

It didn't take long for nearly a thousand evil ghosts to be slaughtered by Qin Feng's two clones.

At the same time, Qin Feng chased and killed the ghost king all the way.

The ghost king fled frantically to the outside of the ancient town, and the direction it fled was exactly the direction of Tongtian Lake.

But under the continuous bombardment of thunder, its momentum plummeted all the way, and the speed became slower and slower.

When it escaped to the edge of the ancient town, it finally couldn't hold it anymore, the black smoke all over its body dissipated, and its figure was almost transparent.

Kacha~!

At this moment, another mad thunder fell from the Nine Heavens and smashed into the Ghost King's body.

It roared up to the sky and let out an incomparably mournful roar, then collapsed suddenly and turned into blue smoke in the sky.

The red crystal of a fist rolled down from the blue smoke.

At the same time, a golden treasure chest and a golden card appeared one after another.

[Successfully kills the 33-level ghost king 717 (king level), you get +130000 energy points. 】

[Killing the 33-level ghost king (king level) successfully, you get +10 reputation points. 】

[Killing the 33-level ghost king (king level) successfully, you get +1300 judgment points. 】

[Killing the 33-level ghost king (king level) successfully, the golden treasure chest burst out. 】

[Successfully killed the 33-level ghost king (king level), and the Lingquan Well permission card was released. 】

Finally killed it!

Qin Feng was overjoyed.

roar~!

But at this moment, outside the ancient town, in the direction of Tongtian Lake, there was an extremely angry growl.

It seems like the fall of the ghost king, something mysterious has also been sensed.

What surprised Qin Feng was that the thing was in the direction of Tongtian Lake.

He thought that the thing was hidden in the dark of the ancient town, but he didn't expect it to be so far away.

Having said that, Tayue Town is not far from Tongtian Lake, just over a quarter of an hour away.

Soon, the low roar subsided, and there was no more movement.

Qin Feng didn't pay any attention to it, and he went forward to collect his spoils.

But at this moment, Tiandao sent a reminder.

【You have been promoted to level 7 judge successfully! 】

【Your strength index increases by 20 points! 】

【Your strength index increases by 20 points! 】

【Your agility index increases by 20 points! 】

【Your BMI increases by 20 points! 】

【Your energy index increases by 20 points! 】

Qin Feng was overjoyed and was promoted again.

It seems that so many ghosts and ghost kings have been killed without killing them in vain, and the trial value is full.

At this moment, an upgraded white light lit up on his body, a strong light.

His aura also soared wildly, wave after wave, and his combat power reached 305 stars in a blink of an eye.

Chapter 165 Carry a treasure well with you

The continuous promotion of vocation makes Qin Feng in a good mood.

Now, his combat power has reached 305 stars, and he has challenged the top-grade foundation building assessment, and has stabilized by another point.

Having said that, this ghost king was the second prefecture-level powerhouse he killed.

Of course, if he hadn't had the means to restrain the ghost king, there would have been a **** battle.

After all, the combat power of the two sides is equal, and even Qin Feng is weaker.

However, the ghost king is only a low-grade foundation.

If you encounter a middle-grade foundation building, it will be extremely terrifying.

By the way, what kind of existence is the guy behind this ghost king?

He can control the ghost king, it must be extremely scary, maybe it is the existence of the middle grade foundation.

Qin Feng's heart condensed, and he secretly thought that this place should not stay for a long time.

Now, he has no confidence to build a foundation for the existence of the upper and middle grades.

I don't know if the existence behind the ghost king will come over.

He should leave quickly.

Tayue Town at night was not peaceful.

Thinking of this, he hurried forward to collect his spoils.

After a while, his collection was complete.

A golden treasure chest, a peculiar permission card, and a red crystal the size of a fist.

He glanced at the red crystal.

[Ghost King Soul Crystal: A fourth-order material with special uses. 】

This information made Qin Feng a little unclear.

However, Tier 4 materials are generally valuable treasures.

Qin Feng put it away with satisfaction.

Then, he hurried back to the square.

The scene there is still waiting for him to clean up.

When he returned to the square, he saw ant corpses scattered all over the ground, as well as some red crystals.

Those red crystals were left behind after the ghosts died. They were the size of ping-pong **** and looked a bit like rocks.

He has always been curious what these crystals are.

I confronted the ghosts before, and I have no time to check it.

Immediately, he stepped forward to pick up a red crystal and checked it.

[Soul Stone: A third-order material, which can be used for refining, and can also be used in the construction of various buildings. 】

good! good!

It turns out that these are all Tier 3 materials!

This time the information, even the purpose of the material is listed.

At first glance, it is a material with a wide range of uses, and it is naturally valuable.

At the moment, Qin Feng began to collect them.

In less than a quarter of an hour, he finished collecting, and got a thousand or so soul stones in total.

Qin Feng is very satisfied.

Having said that, he has gained a lot tonight, not only has he harvested a large number of soul stone resources, but his level and prestige have been greatly improved.

Today, his level is 17 and 13.2%, and his reputation is 141 points.

The vocation progress has also reached level 8, 7%.

The combat power has soared to 305 stars.

The overall strength can be said to be improved in all directions.

"The scene is finished! Next, I'll get some more spiritual spring water, and it's time to leave."

Qin Feng murmured in his heart and walked to the Lingquan Well in front of him.

Tayue Town is gloomy at night.

Even though the ghost king and all the ghosts were gone, he was still a little uneasy.

Because he knew that there was a more powerful existence behind the ghost king.

However, that presence doesn't seem to appear during the day.

Qin Feng walked towards Lingquan Well while thinking wildly.

Soon, he arrived at the well, took out his own glass bottle of purified water, and prepared to take all the spring water from Lingquan Well.

Lingquan Wells can only be built at the level 5 villages, that is, the town level.

Like Longyuan Village, there is no permission to build it.

The Lingquan Well absorbs the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and can produce a fixed amount of spiritual spring water every day.

Almost 100 units of spiritual spring water are produced a day.

Nowadays, the Lingquan Well has been neglected all year round, and the water in it has always been full, which is almost 500 units of Lingquan water.

When the water in the Lingquan Well reaches 500 units, it will automatically stop producing Lingquan water, which will not cause the phenomenon of overflowing the well.

500 units of spiritual spring water is not a small amount.

However, although the water purification glass bottle in Qin Feng's hand is small, it can hold the lake and swallow the sea.

Even 100 million units of spiritual spring water can hold it.

At the moment, he will fetch water.

"Hey! By the way, didn't I get a permission card!"Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

At this time, Qin Feng seemed to think of something, and quickly took out a golden card from the storage ring.

It came out after the ghost king died.

[Lingquan Well Permission Card: Tier 3 God Card. Using this card, you can get the right to move the 'Lingquan Well' once, and the moving distance cannot exceed a hundred miles. 】

good! good!

This is actually a permission card that can move the Lingquan Well.

Thinking about it, the ghost king was the mayor of Tayue Town before his death, and he had the authority to control all public buildings in Tayue Town.

Today, the Lingquan Well and a teleportation array are left intact in Tayue Town, and the rest of the public buildings are damaged.

This time, he killed the ghost king and revealed this kind of permission card, which was not unexpected.

By the way, if he uses this permission card to move Lingquan Well to his sphere of influence, wouldn't it become a resource for Longyuan Village!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng's eyes lit up and he felt that it was feasible.

But the next second, he was worried again.

The information on this card indicates that the movement distance cannot exceed 100 miles.

His outermost force was the village of Sangqi.

But the village of Sangqi is hundreds of kilometers away from Tayue Town, and it cannot be moved at all.
