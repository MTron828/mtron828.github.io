Qin Feng couldn't help but take a deep breath!

Fortunately, he is not affected by the Five Taisha mist, and should be able to do it.

If it is replaced by other players, the innate power of the Five Tais will suppress their strength by half, and it is even more impossible to challenge successfully!

With this in mind, Qin Feng will activate the three great weapons!

Boom~Long~Long~!

But at this moment, his Consciousness Sea roared, and Tiandao sent another reminder...

[Opportunity reminder: It is detected that the player has activated the 'Supreme Star Lord' challenge, reaching the standard of activating the 'Dao-level chance'! „Äë

[Dao-level chance: automatically activate the challenge of 'Hongmeng Star Lord'! „Äë

[Hongmeng Star-Lord: A higher-level star-lord title than the Supreme Star-Lord]

[Reminder: Obtaining the 'Hongmeng Star Lord' can randomly awaken 3 Innate Avenues, 50 Acquired Avenues, and a complete Hongmeng Purple Qi! „Äë

[Challenge content: Within three minutes, kill the strengthened four-phase **** to get the Hongmeng Star Lord! „Äë

Boom~!

After listening to the prompt, Qin Feng was both surprised and delighted!

He did not expect that above the Supreme Star-Lord, there is actually a Hongmeng Star-Lord!

The benefits of the Hongmeng Star-Lord's reward are far greater than those of the Supreme Star-Lord!

It's just a reminder from Heaven, what does it mean to kill the strengthened four-phase god?

As soon as this thought started, the sky shook again.

hum~~!

Immediately afterwards, a white beam of light descended from the sky, covering the whole body of the Four Elements God...

In the next second, a group of purple energy exuding Dao light slowly descended along the beam of light...

Seeing the purple air, Qin Feng was surprised!

That is Hongmeng Purple Qi!

In just a moment, the group of Hongmeng purple energy fell, and at a speed visible to the naked eye, it merged into the body of the four-phase god...

Boom~Long~Long~!

Immediately, the four-phase magical power body released purple light, and the momentum soared wildly, and in a blink of an eye, it soared to 19 trillion stars!

It's actually strengthening!

Qin Feng was stunned and couldn't help but take a deep breath!

The power of this devil has soared!

However, the time for him to kill the target was shortened to 3 minutes!

The challenge is more than double the difficulty!

Knew it!

Hongmeng Star Lord is not so easy to obtain!

At this moment, Qin Feng no longer has much confidence.

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this time, the voice of heaven resounded in the void!

[Opportunity reminder: It is detected that the player has activated the challenge of "Hongmeng Star Lord". The content of this challenge has been changed, and the countdown is recalculated! „Äë

[Challenge reminder: The enhanced four-phase **** has appeared! After 10 seconds, start the challenge! Please be prepared for both! „Äë

„ÄêCountdown: 10‚Ä¶9‚Ä¶„Äë

The countdown has started again!

Qin Feng was already prepared!

Before he came in, he had already completed the transformation of the Seven Killing Divine Body!

At this moment, the Pantian Dao Axe in his hand lit up with a faint aura!

At this moment, the four heads of the Four Elements God slowly lifted up and looked at Qin Feng...

I saw that in its eight pupils, the light of wisdom flashed, and it was looking at Qin Feng coldly!

pity! Qin Feng has awakened to too many avenues, and even has the breath of the avenues of cause and effect!

Both the Heavenly Secret Avenue and the Karma Avenue can conceal the secrets and the aura of combat power!

The four-phase **** can only see Qin Feng's realm, but he can't see Qin Feng's fighting power.

It suddenly frowned slightly, feeling unhappy!

But the next second, it showed disdain again.

Although it can't see Qin Feng's fighting power, it can see that Qin Feng is only the main god.

Ha ha! It's just a small main **** realm!

How strong can it be?

It is estimated that this human being has just stepped into the half-step eternal strength, and only by chance did he activate the challenge of ‚ÄòHongmeng Star Lord‚Äô!

With such strength, it is not its opponent at all!

It is a half-step extreme powerhouse!

In this case, it will give this human an unforgettable lesson and let it know how powerful it is!

Thinking of this, the face of the Four Elements God actually showed a playful look.

It thought it had won!

Looking at Qin Feng again, his expression is very serious, as if he is facing a great enemy!

This made the Four Elements God feel more and more that this human being must have sensed its terrifying aura and was afraid of it!

Sorry to be late!

It was at this moment that Tiandao sent a reminder...

„ÄêCountdown is over! The challenge is on! Start timing: 0‚Ä¶]

Boom~!

As soon as the prompt came out, the four-phase **** broke out first and went straight to Qin Feng to kill...

In the blink of an eye, it killed Qin Feng!

In the next breath, its four heads, each controlling two arms, blasted out eight punches at the same time!

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

The eight punches were all imposing, and they suddenly reached 60 trillion stars, which was terrifying to the extreme!

Boom~Long~Long~!

Immediately afterwards, the momentum of the eight fists formed into one piece, completely covering Qin Feng!

The power of their joint strikes is superimposed layer by layer, and the momentum covers the sky and the earth, and it is infinitely close to 70 trillion stars!

Seeing this scene, Qin Feng's face changed slightly!

The attack of these four-phase gods is so terrifying!

I'm afraid this challenge is not easy to pass!

At the same moment, the four-phase **** saw Qin Feng's eyes showing horror, and his heart was even more proud.

In its view, Qin Feng was shocked by it!

Then it will let this human being eliminated as soon as possible!

Thinking of this, the speed of its eight-fist bombardment was also accelerated by one point.

In the blink of an eye, the eight punches are approaching, completely locking Qin Feng's breath, making Qin Feng unavoidable!

At the same moment, the smug look in its eyes became stronger, thinking that Qin Feng was settled!

Om~! Om~! Om~!

At this moment, Qin Feng broke out!

He is full of golden light!

The Seven Killing Divine Physique's aura is released!

The Pantian Dao Axe and the Pantian Divine Armor also all lit up with aura!

In just an instant, his aura soared to 287 trillion stars, which was extremely terrifying!Aall ùíèùíÜwest chùíÇptùíÜrs on n.o./vùíÜlùíÉi/n/(.)cùíêm

"Huh! This is...„ÄÉ"."

The four-phase **** was stunned for a while!

In those eight eyes, all of them showed the color of astonishment!

It did not expect that the basic aura of this human being in the **** realm was stronger than it!

However, after being shocked, its expression quickly calmed down, but its expression became even more hideous!

The basic momentum is strong, but it does not mean that the attack is strong!

It can still crush this kid!

Click~! Click~! Click~!

Thinking of this, the four-phase god's attack became even more vicious!

Where the fist wind passed, the walls of the void world were shattered inch by inch, and the laws of the Great Dao collapsed!

Swah~~!

At this moment, Qin Feng also shot!

He threw an axe with all his might, slashed away wildly, and met the attack of the eight punches!

hum~~!

At the moment when the axe was split, the blade of the axe lit up with a dazzling cold light!

All three weapons are activated!

A critical strike is also activated at the same time!

The axe's attack momentum instantly increased by 30%, soaring to about 84 trillion stars, and its power was terrifying!

"This...this is..."

The four-phase **** is terrified!

It sensed the change in momentum instantly, and its eyes were full of incredible colors!

But everything is changing so fast that it has no time to react!

In the blink of an eye, the two sides attacked and collided!

Bang~~!

A loud bang!

Void burst! The sea of ‚Äã‚Äãfog surges!

The Four Elements God groaned and was smashed by the axe, tumbling and flying hundreds of millions of feet away.

And Qin Feng is still standing still!

In this round, the two sides will judge!

However, the four-phase **** quickly stabilized his figure.

As soon as it stabilized, it looked up at Qin Feng, and its eyes were full of horror!

At the same moment, Qin Feng also looked at it...

I saw that the Four Elements God had no injuries on his body except his face was slightly dim and his breath was a little unstable!
