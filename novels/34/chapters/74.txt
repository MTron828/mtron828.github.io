"Cool! It's so cool!"

"Ha ha!!"

There was cheers in the channel, and everyone was in high spirits!

At the same moment, Qin Feng happily added...

[Attribute addition is complete! Your Agility Index increases by 65 points! „Äë

[Attribute addition is complete! Your BMI increases by 65 points! „Äë

Just a moment, 265 free attributes, all added...

Qin Feng suddenly felt the majestic energy flowing all over his body, and he came to cut the hair and wash the marrow again. It was very comfortable...

He clearly felt that he had become a lot stronger.

That feeling is so wonderful!

At the same time, his latest data appeared in his mind.

[Combat Strength Evaluation]: 35 stars

Wow~!

The combat power has reached 35 stars!

Qin Feng was overjoyed.

This time, his strength has skyrocketed!

Exceeded his expectations!

This is so cool!

By the way, he still has six silver treasure chests, and one gold treasure chest has not been opened!

[Announcement: The countdown is over, and the camp betting begins! „Äë

Fuck it~!

The countdown is over and the time is running out.

At the moment, Qin Feng's figure flashed, and he rushed to the ant nest on the side.

With his current strength, even without opening the treasure chest or changing equipment, he can easily sweep through the ant nest.

Therefore, he is not in a hurry to open the treasure chest.

He's more in a hurry to score!

The more points an individual earns, the higher the reward.

He will get the points first.

This time, his goal is still more than 800 points.

Only in this way can he get the highest reward.

However, this time it was much more difficult than the last.

Because the number of people who can score this time will be several times more than the last time.

In the 911 village alone, more than 100 people can score points.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng suddenly felt a sense of urgency.

Swish~!

At the moment, he dodged a few times and got into the ant's nest.

The ant nest was two meters high and three meters wide, clean and dry.

Ants are very clean creatures, so their nests are very clean.

Of course, the lair is pitch-dark and hard to see.

Those giant ants go in and out, relying on touch and smell, not sight.

However, Qin Feng is gifted with vision, hearing, and smell. In that dark cave, there is no obstacle and he walks like the wind.

Sand~! Sand~! Sand~!

After walking about 100 meters, there was the crawling sound of giant ants at the corner ahead.

He hurried over.

Looking behind the corner, I was surprised.

I saw that the front was densely packed with giant ants, almost filling the passage.

Ha ha!

The opportunity to kill the Quartet has come!

Squeak~! Squeak~! Squeak~!

Sand~! Sand~! Sand~!

Those giant ants also discovered Qin Feng.

They screamed.

Afterwards, the ant colonies came to kill in pieces.

Qin Feng happily went up to the challenge.

For a moment, the two meet.

Swish~!

Qin Feng slashed with a knife!

Knife gas vertical and horizontal!

Several feet long!

Click~! Click~! Click~!

Wherever the sword energy passed, the giant ants were all split into two halves.

Within a few feet, not one survived!

¬†‚Ä¶

Fuck it~!

It's too arrogant to put energy out!

With just one knife, he killed six giant ants!

All of a sudden, I got more than 3,000 energy points and 48 points.

Cool!

So cool!

Sand~! Sand~! Sand~!

At this time, the angry ant colony killed one after another.

Qin Feng laughed and went up to meet him, and the long knife danced wildly.

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

Suddenly, in the cave, the cold light flashed continuously, and the sword energy was vertical and horizontal.

Click~! Click~! Click~!

Every time he stabbed, five or six giant ants died.

And his points also jumped wildly.

Every time it beats, it increases by forty or fifty points.

In this way, he pushed horizontally all the way, invincible.

Five minutes later, a reminder came from Tiandao.

[Reminder: Your personal points have reached 300 points, you can get personal points rewards: 20 attributes, a silver treasure chest! „Äë

Ha ha!

So fast!

Qin Feng is excited!

He continued to push horizontally into the cave, killing the ant colony as if it were smashed, with no resistance.

In just a moment, he smashed into the depth of the nest, killing countless giant ants.

At this time, Tiandao came to remind again.

[Reminder: Your personal points have reached 500 points, you can get personal points rewards: 40 attributes, two silver treasure chests! „Äë

Cool!

kill!

Keep killing!

¬†‚Ä¶

It didn't take long for Qin Feng to enter the deepest part of the lair.

At this time, he saw a giant ant tens of meters long at the bottom of the nest a hundred meters ahead.

It has a dark red head and a round white belly.

Its body size is more than thirty times that of the metal-devouring worker ants.

This is the Queen Ant!

That is, the Queen of Gold Devouring Ants!

Qin Feng looked excited.
