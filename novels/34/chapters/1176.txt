Time is not only a change of time, but also a change of space.

The Avenue of the Years is a powerful avenue, much stronger than the Avenue of Morning Dew and the Avenue of Health!

The anode body is full of surprises!

The '10,000-year-old peach' in front of me is more precious than those of 3,000 years and 1,000 years.

As long as he swallows 2, he will be able to awaken the Dao of Time!

correct!

The little guy in Dijiang has mastered the SS-level time and space laws, and he can also obtain the Avenue of Years!

Looking at the 1,200 peach trees in the inner layer, there are almost more than 2,000 spiritual peaches, which is completely enough.

After Ji Yang was delighted, he turned his eyes again and looked at the peach tree in the center of Taoyuan.

That peach tree is as high as hundreds of millions of feet, its crown is like a canopy that covers the sky, the red light is soaring to the sky, the strange images are dense, and it is extremely extraordinary.

[Ren Shui Pan Peach Tree (Trunk): The pinnacle level of fortune, the spiritual roots of heaven and earth, unidentified master]

[The spiritual roots of this world contain the power of three avenues: Morning Dew Avenue, Health Avenue, and Years Avenue]

[Reminder: Only Dao-level blood, and mastery of one of the Dao of morning dew, health preservation, and time can be recognized as the master]

After reading the information, the eyes of Jiyang's body shine!

This is a mature root of heaven and earth!

What's more gratifying is that it has not yet recognized the master.

Obviously, the bloodline of the demon king has not yet reached the Dao level, so it is impossible to recognize the master!

However, the possession of this piece of Peach Garden is equivalent to taking the spiritual foundation as his own.

At this moment, a muttering sound came from the depths of Taoyuan.

That was the chatter between Qiang and his subordinates.

Hearing the movement, Ji Yang's eyes lit up and he smiled.

Knew it!

Those demon gods are hidden in the depths of Taoyuan!

Target found!

Next, he should also do it!

Thinking of this, Ji Yang's body held his breath and quietly dived to the peach forest

After a while, he dived into the depths of the peach forest and hid behind a peach tree

At this time, the muttering in the park became clearer.

Jiyang body took a deep breath and looked in the direction of the sound

I saw a fairy pond in that direction.

Next to the immortal pond, there are twelve figures standing, one of which is the peak of the **** king, one is the middle stage of the **** king, and the remaining ten are the early **** king.

The demon **** at the pinnacle of the **** king is naturally the demon king.

The gaze of Ji Yang's body looked at the scorpion.

At this moment, Qiang looked at the ten demon gods in the early stage of the **** king in front of him, his brows furrowed, and his expression was depressed!

He originally had thirteen god-king early subordinates, but in the process of withdrawing, three of them fell, apparently killed by Ji Yang's body.

It hurts his flesh!

That intruder is so nasty!

He must kill the intruder and avenge his subordinates!

Having said that, why haven't Da Feng and others arrived yet?

As soon as he thought of the strong wind, he looked towards the west with an anxious look on his face.

Without the help of the two demon kings, he did not have the confidence to stay as the enemy, but after the strong wind left, there was no letter for a long time, and I don't know how the conversation went.

At this time, Chiu Tooth also asked: "Lord Ying, the gale has been gone for a while. It stands to reason that he should have arrived in the western region, right? Why hasn't any information been sent back for a long time?"

Qiang took a deep breath and said, "It is estimated that Da Feng is still talking with those two demon kings!"

Not far away, Ji Yang's body eavesdropped on this, and his heart was stunned.

He understood in an instant that not only did he sense that he was coming, but he also sought the help of the other two demon kings.

Fortunately, he arrived just in time!

If the three devil kings really gather together, he may not be able to complete this mission!

Ji Yang took a deep breath, feeling a little fortunate.

At this time, the sound of chiseling came again.

"Sir, Da Feng hasn't responded to the message. It's really worrying! It's not like the strong enemies are here, but Da Feng and others haven't come yet, are they?"

The chiseled tone was a little worried.

But Qiang said calmly: "Don't worry! The valley is full of dense fog that suppresses consciousness. Even if it is the peak of the **** king, it will take a long time to find this place."

Qiang's tone was very confident.

He didn't know that Ji Yang's body had already sneaked into them.

They just don't know it yet!

At this time, Qian Qian wanted to continue to say something, but a sudden change occurred in the field.

I saw a azure light, blazing from a distance, and heading straight for the scorpion!

Yang Chen felt something, and grabbed the blue light.

Qingguang froze, showing its original appearance, it was actually a jade talisman for communication.UpdùíÇted chapters ùíên nùíêvelbin(.)com

Afterwards, Qiangyu picked up the jade talisman and checked it out.

After a while, he opened his eyes with a happy expression on his face.

Chiseled curious: "Sir, this is"

Qiang smiled and said, "This is the message sent by the wind. The two demon kings have already agreed to take action, and they will come out in full force! The reason why the wind is returning the message so late is because they are recruiting people."

"Now, they have all recruited. Gale sent us a message back."

Chiseled surprise: "Sir, how many people will they come this time?"

Qiang smiled slightly: "Two peak **** kings, five middle **** kings, and twenty early **** kings. If you add the strong wind, it's six **** kings in the middle stage!"

Chiseled overjoyed: "That's great! With so many strong men coming to help, even if the enemy has 600 million combat power, there will be no return!"

Qiang smiled smugly: "It's natural! I'm only worried now, the enemy will detect it in advance, and I will be scared away!"

"Haha! Lord, even if he wants to run, I'm afraid it will be too late. This time, how can I easily let him go!"

As soon as these words fell, both of them smiled knowingly.

Even the ten demon kings at the early stage of the **** king on the side were all smiling.

Not far away, Ji Yang's body eavesdropped on this, and was also horrified.

Two **** kings at their peak, six **** kings in their early stages, and twenty **** kings in their early stages.

The basic combat power of Ji Yang's body has not yet reached the level of the Great Perfection of the God King.

The power range of God King Dzogchen is 800 million to 100 million stars.

What's more terrible is that the task of Jiyang's body is not to defeat the target, but to kill all the demon kings!

Thinking of this, he has a big head!

Fortunately, he has many means, and his strength cannot be judged by common sense, and he rushed to the old nest of Qiang in advance, taking a first-line opportunity!

He didn't want to think so much anymore, he had to take advantage of the arrival of the other two big demon kings, first to destroy the scorpion and others, otherwise the situation would get worse!

With this in mind, Ji Yang's body is about to take action

"Hey! This is"

Suddenly, he found that the immortal pond beside You, was a little special.

He couldn't help but look at the fairy pond

I saw that the fairy pond was filled with milky white spiritual liquid, releasing silky white spiritual energy, forming a rich spiritual mist on the water surface.

As soon as his heart moved, he probed towards Xianchi.

[Qingjie Lingchi: The best god-level, innate blessed land, has recognized the master! „Äë

[This pool can automatically absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and condense the 'worship juice' full of the pool]

[Nectar juice: mid-grade god-level spiritual liquid, 3.8 can be used to cultivate various spiritual things, and can also be drunk directly to enhance strength]

[Reminder: If you fuse this blessed land 'Gorgeous Spirit Pool' with another blessed land 'Jade Liquid Spirit Pool', you can get the fortune-level blessed land 'Yao Chi']

what!

This is actually the Qiongjing Lingchi!

The anode body is full of surprises!

He has the 'Jade Liquid Spirit Pond' in his hand, and if he gets this 'Gorgeous Nectar Spirit Pond' again, he can condense a fortune-level blessed land - Jade Pond!

Fortune-level blessed land!

I don't know what magical changes will happen after the success of the cohesion?

The more I think about the anode body, the more I look forward to it!

However, only by killing the scorpion can he have a way to make the 'Qingjie Lingchi' recognize the master again.

It's time to do it!

Jiyang body took a deep breath and quietly approached the demon gods.

Thirty thousand feet, two thousand feet, ten thousand feet

The distance between the two sides is getting closer and closer!

At this moment, Qiang and the demon gods were still talking and didn't notice.

When Ji Yang's body was only three hundred feet away from the demon gods, the scorpion finally sensed it.

"Hey! This is..."

The brow furrowed slightly, and then suddenly turned to look.

At this sight, he saw a young human being approaching three hundred feet from them!

Shocked!

But before he could exclaim, Ji Yang's body suddenly shot

Chapter 879 Ten billion upgrades! The harvest is overwhelming!

I saw Ji Yang's body flickering, and it was divided into twelve, turning into twelve fission bodies!

The momentum of each fission body suddenly reached 600 million stars!

huh~! huh~! huh~!

Before the demon gods could react, the twelve fission bodies teleported behind the demon gods!

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

In the next breath, the twelve fission variants shot at the same time, slashing down at the backs of the demon gods!

"Damn!"

The scorpion screamed!

Among the demon gods, he was the only one who had time to react, and the other demon gods didn't have time to react at all.

At that moment, the scorpion turned around abruptly!
