Finally killed it!

Jiyang body breathed a sigh of relief!

In the last blow, he also cast back the time before he had a chance to pull back the Emperor River.

Otherwise, there is a real possibility that it will escape!

After all, the eight extreme yin fission variants have all completed their time travel, and their skills are in a cooling state.

Fortunately, his last sword beheading was successful!

In the next second, the polar yang body and the eight polar yin fission variants merged into one.

Emperor River Shizu is dead!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng excitedly looked at the altar not far away.

At this moment, the god-level spirit egg lay quietly in the center of the altar.

hum!

At this time, the sky oscillated, and the five Qi Luck beams fell one after another!

Qin Feng closed his eyes involuntarily, accepted the empowerment of Qi Luck, and enjoyed the wonderful feeling of Qi Luck improvement.

After a while, the Qi Luck empowerment is over!

His luck value has reached 28 times, and he is not far from the goal of 30 times!

At this moment, Tiandao sent a reminder.

Another roar of heaven and earth!

The reward beam falls!

Ten nine-turn Divine Physique Pills, slowly falling along the beam of light

After a while, the Divine Body Pill arrived in front of Qin Feng.

He happily put it away!

In this way, the Divine Body Pill in his hand has accumulated to 20!

After receiving the reward, Qin Feng strode to the front altar, shot directly, and shattered the protective mask of the altar

Afterwards, he jumped onto the altar and walked over to the Dijiang Spirit Egg with joy!

The spirit egg at the peak of the low-grade **** rank!

If you are lucky, there is hope to cultivate into a middle-grade god-level egg!

And the middle grade **** rank corresponds to the true **** realm!

The strength of the general star master level power is the real **** realm!

Qin Feng feels that his luck is really good!

If you pass a level, you can get a low-grade god-level peak spiritual egg, luck is not generally good!

Of course, he was also the only one who passed the seventh level!

Otherwise, this spiritual egg would have been landed first!

He didn't want to think so much, he still quickly let the spirit egg recognize the master!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng broke the blood clotting on his finger and dripped it into the egg.

Snapped!

The fiery red blood essence dripped on the eggshell!

In the next second, the spirit egg sucked out the blood essence at a speed visible to the naked eye.

hum!

Immediately afterwards, the spirit egg emitted a faint silver light and released a joyful mental wave.

At that moment, there was telepathy between Qin Feng and Ling Egg, as if they had signed a soul contract.

【Recognize the Lord successfully! The Dijiang Spirit Egg has recognized you as the master! 】

call! It worked!

Qin Feng breathed a long sigh of relief and was quite happy.

With this spirit egg, he will have another powerful subordinate!

This makes him look forward to it!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng stroked the egg with a smile and comforted the little guy inside.

Soon, the active mental thoughts in the egg gradually calmed down and fell asleep again.

Qin Feng also put away the egg with satisfaction.

At this time, Tiandao sent a reminder

[After 20 minutes of rest, the eighth level will be opened]
