Majestic Desert Splendor

Seeing that the beast **** was about to flee, Qin Feng quickly entangled him.

He couldn't let this guy escape.

His task is to kill the beast **** within the specified time.

If the Beast God escapes back to the tenth floor, who knows if the Beast God has any special means to save his life.

If the beast **** really has that kind of life-saving means and causes him to fail to complete the task within the stipulated time, then he will be in vain.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng stepped up his attack.

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

Bang~! Bang~! Bang~!

After a while, the two sides fought and retreated, still terrifyingly slaughtered.

However, even if Qin Feng has teleportation skills, speed has a big advantage.

But the Beast God's combat power is already stronger.

Regardless of everything, he rampaged all the way, and he just found a way out.

A minute later, the Beast God Battle retreated to the seventh floor.

Three minutes later, the Beast God Battle retreated to the eighth floor.

Five minutes later, the Beast God Battle retreated to the ninth floor.

At this moment, in the ninth floor hall.

The Beast God looked at the entrance of the tenth floor not far away, and his eyes showed a vicious look.

Soon, he will be able to retreat to the tenth floor.

As soon as he stepped into the tenth floor, he would immediately crush and control the jade talisman, which could instantly seal all the space below the tenth floor.

At that time, he will seal Qin Feng in the space below the ninth floor.

And he continued to sleep.

After half a year, his injury should be much better, and his strength will be greatly increased.

At that time, he will break the seal again and kill the kid.

The Beast God thought about his own plan, and felt more and more feasible.

In a blink of an eye, he approached the entrance to the tenth floor.

Qin Feng's combat power is not as strong as his, and he can't stop it, and his heart is more and more anxious.

At this moment, the voice of Qiyue rang in his ear.

"Master, I have finished refining!"

Qin Feng's eyes lit up, and his heart moved quickly.

In the next second, the four avatars and Qiyue appeared at the same time.

However, the four avatars are guarding in front of Qiyue and do their best to protect her.

When the beast **** saw the four avatars, he was extremely angry.

It was these four guys who stole his four groups of mid-grade blood essence.

But when he saw the four avatars posing to guard the Qiyue, he was puzzled.

But without waiting for him to think about it, Qiyue has already used the seal formula and exerted the time skill.

Om~!

In an instant, time accelerated, and it was attached to Qin Feng.

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

Qin Feng's speed soared six times.

He kept using teleportation, jumping back and forth around the beast god.

After the time accelerated, the frequency of his teleportation greatly increased, faster than the reaction speed of the beast god.

Finally, Qin Feng seized a gap and slashed at the back of the beast god.

At that moment, the beast **** had come to dodge, and his forehead was sweating in shock.

Om~!

In the panic, he propped up a protective mask and breathed a sigh of relief.

With his defensive power, he should be able to resist that knife.

In his opinion, his combat power will finally be a lot stronger than Qin Feng, and it is not a big problem to resist that knife.

Om~!

But at this moment, the Shinra Heavenly Blade lit up with golden light, connecting the sky and the ground.

00

The skill attached to the weapon exploded!

Heaven-shattering blow!

Attack power increased by a thousand stars!

Kacha~!

A crisp sound!

That knife cut through the mask!

The beheading trend is still unabated!

The beast **** panicked and dodged sideways, but it was too late.

Kacha~!

A crisp sound!

Blood splashes!

That knife cut off an arm of the beast god, and even took half a shoulder.

He roared and retreated again and again, and his momentum also plummeted.

The next second, he struggled to escape to the tenth-floor entrance a hundred feet away.

But he only took a step, and his face showed a painful color, and the golden divine pattern between his eyebrows distorted and collapsed.

The beast **** seal and the three groups of blood essence were separated from his body.

The Divine Seal Fusion has finally reached its time limit!

His aura suddenly plummeted.

Qin Feng was overjoyed and hurriedly culled away.

Swish~! Swish~! Swah~!

The four clones also slaughtered the past at the same time.

Another blast!

The field was shattered, and the sun and the moon had no light!

Qiyue, who was on the side, was dumbfounded and fearful, thinking that fighting at this level was really terrible.

Kacha~!

Another crisp sound!

A burst of blood splashed!

Finally, Qin Feng split the beast **** in half with one knife...

Terrible scream!

Echoes in the sky above the hall!

In the next second, an extremely dazzling aura flew from the corpse and rushed into Qin Feng's body...

Whoo~!

Finally killed it!

Qin Feng's eyes were full of ecstasy.

After killing this beast god, he gained a lot of energy and judgment.

Xiao Luan'er also gained a lot of energy points, and even Qiyue gained 1.06 million energy points.

This is all very powerful!

What's more powerful is that the beast **** also exploded a purple diamond treasure chest, rewarding 30 reputation.

Of course, what Qin Feng cares about most is the ninth-order residual seal—the beast **** seal, and the three groups of middle-grade blood essence.

Thinking of this, he hurriedly walked towards the mark of the beast god.

It was at this moment that an upgraded light lit up on him...

Qin Feng was surprised!

With these successive upgrades, Qin Feng's strength has naturally improved.

There are many benefits to leveling up. For example, if you want to break through to the Heaven-level realm, the minimum requirement is to reach level 40 to be eligible to participate in the Heaven-level assessment.

At the moment, Qin Feng no longer thought about it, and stepped forward to harvest the spoils.

But at this moment, Tiandao came to remind again.

[Task reminder: You killed the beast **** whose strength exceeded the scope of the B-level task, and obtained an additional personal reward of 10,000 attributes. 】
