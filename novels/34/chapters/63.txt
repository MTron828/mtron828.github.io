really!

Soldier ants are much stronger than worker ants!

The combat power has reached 19 stars!

"Huh! That is?"

At this moment, Qin Feng found a huge ant crawling out of the nest.

Its body is twice the size of a soldier ant, and its body is no longer pure black, but fiery red in the black, and its aura is extremely powerful.

As soon as it appeared, it raised its head proudly and scanned the audience, as if supervising everything in front of it.

Qin Feng quickly looked carefully...

Fuck it~!

This is actually a three-talented mutant beast!

It can be seen that this ant-eater general cannot be underestimated!

Of course, Qin Feng is not afraid!

He took a closer look. There were about 200 worker ants in the valley, more than 40 soldier ants, and only one ant-eater general.

As for how much there is in the lair, it is unknown.

After all, he should act.

With this in mind, he tapped the boulder next to him with one hand.

Bang~! Bang~!

Two beeps!

Instantly spread into the valley!

The ant colony was alarmed, and dozens of soldier ants looked at Taniguchi.

Those worker ants were unmoved, and they were still busy diligently.

And Qin Feng was already prepared and retracted behind the boulder in advance.

The soldier ants looked at it and found nothing.

However, ants have poor eyesight.

If you can't see clearly from a distance, you naturally have to come closer to observe.

Immediately, three gold-devouring soldier ants rushed towards Taniguchi.

Sand~! Sand~! Sand~!

A crawling sound!

The crawling speed of the three soldier ants is very fast, just like the hounds on the earth, which is a bit incredible.

Qin Feng held his breath, hid behind the boulder, clenched the handle of the knife with both hands, and was fully alert.

Before long, the three soldier ants rushed to the boulder.

I saw a flash of light and shadow, and the first soldier ant rushed behind the boulder and found Qin Feng at once.

But before he could react, he saw a flash of sword light!

Swish~!

Kacha~!

A crisp sound!

The soldier ant's ant body as hard as steel was cut off in response, and strange juices flowed down the ground.

But the soldier ant was still alive and alive, and his momentum was not reduced by half. He dragged half of his body, opened his huge ant's tongs, and fiercely attacked Qin Feng.

Fuck it~!

So ferocious!

An ant is a different creature. It's fine if its body is broken. It is much more fierce than ordinary beasts!

Qin Feng swung his hand and it was a knife, slashing on the ant's head.

Kacha~!

The ant head was split in half!

Killed on the spot!

Sand~! Sand~!

It was at this time that the other two soldier ants also arrived one after another.

Swish~! Swish~!

Qin Feng quickly shot and slashed at the ant's head.

Kacha~! Kacha~!

All the ant heads were split open!

All of them were killed on the spot!

good! good!

A 9 points!

All of a sudden I got 27 points.

Qin Feng was delighted and hurried forward to extract the ant corpse...

Squeak~! Squeak~! Squeak~!

It was at this moment that the ant-eater general in the valley noticed something was wrong and hurriedly made a strange and strange cry.

After a while, seven or eight soldier ants, leading more than fifty worker ants, rushed to Taniguchi to check...

Sand~! Sand~! Sand~!

Suddenly, there was a crawling sound in the valley.

Qin Feng's hearing is amazing. He doesn't even need to look to know how many giant ants have been killed.

He knew a great battle was about to begin.

At the moment, he quickly extracted!

„ÄêEndless extraction success! You have acquired an F-rank talent‚ÄîGold Sense! „Äë

Ha ha!

good! good!

Five Elements Talent! Got another one!

Immediately afterwards, he extracted the second ant corpse.

„ÄêEndless extraction success! Once again obtained the F-level talent - gold induction! „Äë

[The two talents are automatically superimposed and strengthened, and they are evolving independently...]

[The evolution of talent failed... Your gold talent is still at the F level. „Äë

Failed this time!

Qin Feng continued to extract‚Ä¶

„ÄêEndless extraction success! Once again obtained the F-level talent - gold induction! „Äë

[The two talents are automatically superimposed and strengthened, and they are evolving independently...]

[Talent evolution is successful! Your gold talent has been promoted to E-level - gold enhancement. „Äë

Ha ha!

It worked!

Evolution succeeded!

Qin Feng was overjoyed.

Sand~! Sand~! Sand~!

It was at this time that the ant colony that probed also arrived.

The first to arrive were seven or eight gold-devouring soldier ants, followed by fifty or sixty giant ants.

Qin Feng quickly shot.

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

Suddenly, the sword light flashed in the field!

Cut the ant's head with a knife!

Kacha~! Kacha~! Kacha~!

Where are those giant ants who are Qin Feng's opponents, they will be instantly killed as soon as they show up

Ha ha!

Cool!

It's so cool!

At this moment, Qin Feng's points and energy values ‚Äã‚Äãare skyrocketing by 3.6!

He was overjoyed!

At the same moment, in the 911 chat channel, everyone was happily discussing.

"It's great! Just now, a 4th-level boss with E-level talent has risen to 5th level, and the number of masters who can score in our village has reached 18."

"Haha! It's so good! It's so good!"

"Fuck~! Something big! Something big!"

"Upstairs, what happened?"
