Colorful Balloons Take Flight
0.00 / 0.00

At that moment, his consciousness swept across the entire Blue Star Realm in an instant.

At that moment, countless creatures in the Blue Star Realm sensed an invisible thought, swept past them!

All sentient beings suddenly felt their hairs stand upside down, fearful in their hearts, and even held their breath at that moment!

At that moment, it seemed that the atmosphere of the entire Blue Star Realm was frozen in an instant, very strange!

At this moment, Qin Feng withdrew his consciousness, and a sneer appeared on the corner of his mouth.

Just at that moment, he spied on the faces of countless people, many of whom were mocking!

As for those who are willing to advance and retreat with Longyuan City, there are even fewer!

Qin Feng smiled coldly and suddenly knew something.

In the next second, his figure flashed, and he got into the entrance light gate of the Holy Land and disappeared.

As soon as Qin Feng entered the Holy Land, the invisible pressure that enveloped the entire planet suddenly disappeared.

All sentient beings also inexplicably breathed a sigh of relief!

At this time, over the hidden valley.

The old men breathed a sigh of relief and looked at each other.

"Everyone, what happened just now? The old man suddenly felt an invisible sense of depression!"

"The old man sensed it too! It seems that the moment Qin Feng turned his head, he sensed it. Could it be him..."

As soon as these words fell, several old people were moved.

But then, another gray-robed old man sneered: "Everyone, I don't have to be afraid of him! It's hard to say whether he can escape the catastrophe of **** in three days!"

"That's right! I'll wait and see! If he can really repel Yeshen, wouldn't it be more reliable for me to rely on him again!"

"Old Yun, Qin Feng said that after the arrival of God, there is no way for us to go to seek refuge!"

"Who knows? He may just say it casually, and I'll beg for it when the time comes! Besides, he will most likely die at the hands of Jesus, and the object of my plea is more likely to be God!"

An old man said self-righteously.

The rest of the people are also convinced!

But on the other side, Qin Feng felt countless golden lights swirl around as soon as he got into the door of light, and countless scenes changed...

That portal teleportation is starting!

Immediately afterwards, the pass in his hand disappeared.

Tiandao also came with a reminder...

[Welcome to the second floor of the Holy Land, you will appear in the No. 2 safe area]

[Reminder: There are only 3 safe areas on the second floor of the Holy Land. In the safe zone, it is forbidden to kill each other]

[Reminder: This Holy Land is only open for 3 days]

Soon, Qin Feng stepped on the ground, and the golden light around him disappeared!

He appeared in a huge square.

Di Jiang and others are beside him.

"Owner!"

"dad!"

When several people saw Qin Feng, they were all determined.

Qin Feng smiled and looked around...

I saw that there were already tens of thousands of people in the square, men and women, young and old, all of them with extraordinary aura!

Seventy percent of them are in the real **** realm, 20 percent are in the main **** realm, and nearly 10 percent are in the virtual **** realm.

The rest is the quasi-god king.

As for the king of gods, the number is extremely rare.

Qin Feng glanced at the False God realm players, all of them with extraordinary aura, their combat power far surpassed the same level, and they were close to the threshold of the True God realm.

Obviously, these are the leaders in the False God realm.

Even if it is in the False God realm, it is the elite of the same rank.

However, compared with Qin Feng and others, these False God players are far behind.

Also in the False God Realm, Yu Xuanji, Feng Xi, Xiaoluan'er, Qiyue, and Qingchengzi's strengths are far beyond the True God Realm.

Even compared with the threshold of the main god, it is similar.

The strength of Di Jiang and Jumang has reached the initial level of the main god.

This is the strongest among the players.

After all, among all the players, less than 30% of the strength is above the main god.

As for Qin Feng, his current comprehensive strength is comparable to the threshold of the middle stage of the God King, and naturally belongs to the top group of people.

With this in mind, Qin Feng looked at the **** king in the crowd.

At first glance, he only saw nine **** kings, all of them hidden, so that people could not see the depth, they were extremely powerful!

At this moment, the appearance of Qin Feng and others attracted everyone's attention.

In the next second, one after another strong consciousness, unscrupulously spied on Qin Feng and others...

When it was discovered that Qin Feng's eight talents were only in the illusory realm, those contestants showed disdain and withdrew their consciousness without interest...

"Dad, those guys seem to look down on us!"

The sentence is full of air.

"Dad, I saw it too!"

Di Jiang's little mouth pouted. .

The two little guys were extremely observant, and they immediately saw the disdain in the eyes of those players.

It makes them very unhappy!

Qin Feng smiled, and it was no surprise that he had long since seen it.

In this world of the heavens where strength is respected, only strong strength will be respected by others.

The realm often represents strength!

When those players see that their realm is not high, they will naturally look down on them.

Of course, this is what the players think they are.

The real strength of Qin Feng and others far exceeded their expectations.

"Don't care about them! We are here to look for opportunities, not for their approval! Let's go, let's find a place, and wait for the first round of opportunities to open!"

Qin Feng fondly touched the heads of the two little guys.

At the moment, under the leadership of Qin Feng, the group came to an inconspicuous corner of the square, sat down cross-legged, and waited for the opportunity to open.

At the same time, white lights lit up from time to time in the square, and new players appeared out of thin air.

Most of the newcomers are in the real **** realm, and a few are in the main **** realm. Occasionally, a quasi-god king will appear.

As soon as they saw the quasi-god king, those players showed awe and did not dare to say more.

As for the False God Realm that appeared, those people were too lazy to even take a look.

However, it was said that Qin Feng's eight people gathered in a corner, which was still a bit conspicuous.

Most of the players who came in were all alone and alone.

It is extremely rare to get together like Qin Feng's eight people.

What is even rarer is that Qin Feng's eight people are all in the False God realm.

This also makes those arrogant players cast strange glances from time to time...

Qin Feng is naturally too lazy to pay attention!

Time flies!

In the blink of an eye, a quarter of an hour passed, and the sky suddenly shook.

Everyone was shocked and looked up at the sky.

I saw the ethereal voice of heaven echoing above the gray sky...

[Holy Land Reminder: The entrance to the Holy Land is closed, please prepare for the first round of opportunities in one minute]

【Countdown: 60…】

Boom~!

As soon as the news came out, the audience was shocked!

All players are excited!

The chance has finally begun!

Several people in Dijiang are also excited!

"Dad! What chance will this first game be?"

Di Jiang asked in a milky voice.

The tone was full of anticipation.

Qin Feng smiled and shook his head: "I don't know either! Yu'er, do you know something?"

Qin Feng looked at Yu Xuanji again.

Yu Xuanji was stunned for a moment, and then his face showed a hint of ruddy.

Feng Xi on the side had a strange look in her eyes.

The master's name for Sister Xuanji has changed!

At this time, Yu Xuanji said: "Returning to the master, as far as the concubine knows, the opportunity of the second floor of this holy land is different every time it is opened, and it depends on the fate."

Qin Feng nodded slightly: "It seems that we can only wait for Tiandao to be announced! Then wait!"

After talking about the most 873, he took a deep breath and looked forward to the next opportunity.

Boom~Long~Long~!

Soon, the countdown ended, and the voice of heaven resounded in the air again
