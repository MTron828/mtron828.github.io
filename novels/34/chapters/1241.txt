Boom~Long~Long~!

As the prompt sounded, a golden light of reward fell from the sky and landed on the body of the extreme yin!

In the beam of light, there is also 50% of the rhythm of Gongde Avenue.

Suddenly, the momentum of the extreme yin body skyrocketed wildly all the way!

After a long time, those rewards are over!

The very yin body slowly opened his eyes, and his eyes were full of joy!

Qing Emperor has reminded that after becoming a high-level Hongmeng Supreme, it is easier to obtain the inheritance of the Judgment Domain Lord!

Now, he has finally reached his goal!

After this promotion, his basic combat power has also reached 577 billion stars, his luck has reached 42,000 times, and his comprehensive strength has been greatly improved!

In addition, he also gained 50% insight into merit and morality!

This is an extremely rare harvest!

Among the many congenital avenues, the top three avenues are extremely difficult to perceive!

Gongde Avenue is the second-ranked Xiantian Avenue!

Qin Feng had obtained the 'Road of Merit Scroll' before, and he has been comprehending it, and the current progress has only reached 19%.

Now, he has suddenly gained 50% Dao Rhythm perception, and the progress of his avenue of merit has increased to 69%!

Having said that, he still has one, karma, origin, and nothingness in his hands, and the four innate avenues are in the process of enlightenment!

The Daojing refining of Yuanyuan Avenue is coming to an end, and it is not far from a complete awakening!

The Dao of Nothingness has refined the 50% Dao Crystal, the progress has reached 80%, and it is not far from awakening.

These two innate avenues, which are already ranked low, are naturally much easier to comprehend.

As for the progress of one, cause and effect, the two avenues are much slower and softer.

In short, Qin Feng is very satisfied with the current progress.

"I don't want so much! It's time for me to merge the **** position!"

Thinking of this, the very yin body walked towards the altar in front

When he integrates the tenth-grade **** position (Hongmeng), then he can get the King's Avenue, the Emperor's Avenue, and the Hongmeng Avenue!

Nahongmeng Avenue is also one of the innate avenues!

In this way, Qin Feng's two main bodies successfully completed the challenge and began to integrate the two tenth-grade gods.

Chapter 924: Ancient Inheritance! Suzaku Kirin!

The higher the **** level, the longer the fusion time.

The tenth-grade **** position will not be integrated for a while.

Just when Qin Feng merged with the gods, Xiaoluan'er, Qiyue, Dijiang and others were searching for ancient opportunities in the land of the gods!

At this moment, two beautiful girls appeared in the sky above a broken planet.

One is Qiyue, and the other is Xiaoluaner.

Today's Qiyue is more youthful and beautiful, a peerless beautiful girl.

Xiao Luan'er is fourteen or fifteen years old, with a well-developed body and a peerless beauty.

"Sister Yue'er, you said, can my father pass the challenge of the ninth-rank divine position?"

At this moment, Xiao Luan'er looked at the direction of Jiutian Zhen Temple, and there was a trace of worry in his eyes.

She was worried that Qin Feng would not be able to get the ninth-rank divine position.

Qiyue also looked at the temple in the distance: "It should be possible!"

Qi Yue's tone was firm.

Her admiration for Qin Feng has long been ingrained.

Xiao Luan'er said worriedly: "Sister Yue'er, the challenge threshold for the ninth-rank **** position, but it requires 200 million combat power!"

Qi Yue comforted: "Luan'er, don't worry! The master has never let us down! This time will be no exception!"

"Well! I hope so!"

Speaking of which, Xiao Luan sighed.

Little girl didn't know that Qin Feng had already won the **** position, and it was a tenth-grade **** position higher than the ninth-grade **** position!

At this time, Xiao Luan'er said again: "Stop talking about that! Sister Yue'er, let's continue to look for opportunities!"

"Um!"

The two withdrew their gazes towards the direction of the temple.

"By the way, Sister Yue'er, my father said that there are some ancient inheritances hidden in this land of the gods. We have turned a lot of places and found nothing!"

Xiao Luan murmured again.

Qiyue smiled and said: "The ancient heritage is extremely rare, how can it be so easy to find?"

Xiao Luan'er nodded: "Yes! It's a pity! The time given by Heaven is too short, only those who have passed the second round of chance assessment will have the opportunity to enter here. I am afraid that many people have passed the assessment, but have no time to come here. explore!"

Qi Yue smiled and said, "Isn't this even better! The fewer people who dabble in this divine relic, the more chance there will be undiscovered, and the greater the chance for us!"

These words just fell, and there was a phoenix cry in the distance!

Boo~~!

The two girls were shocked, and they quickly followed the sound of 880 to look, and saw that hundreds of thousands of miles away, there was a projection of a holy beast floating in the air!

The projection of the holy beast is as high as hundreds of millions of feet, its body is like a phoenix, with red feathers all over its body, and its whole body is burning with golden flames, and its imposing manner is extremely extraordinary!

When Xiao Luan'er saw the projection of the holy beast, the blood in his whole body suddenly boiled!

"Suzaku! That's Suzaku!"

Xiao Luan shouted excitedly.

Her body is Hongluan, the descendant of the Suzaku holy beast, and she has the bloodline of Suzaku in her body.

So as soon as the Suzaku projection appeared, the Suzaku bloodline in her body was awakened!

At the moment, Qiyue's eyes widened: "That must be the activation of the ancient Vermillion Bird inheritance! Luan'er, your chance has come! Go! Let's go!"

"Um!"

As soon as the voice fell, the two girls were ready to go!

But at this moment, the mutation regenerates!

roar~~!

Another roar of a heaven-shattering beast, like the roar of a dragon!

In the next second, next to the Vermillion Bird projection, another projection of a holy beast appeared, which was also hundreds of millions of feet tall, with an extraordinary momentum!

And when Qi Yue saw the projection of the holy beast, her blood boiled!

I saw the projection of the holy beast, the head of a dragon and the body of a lion and the body of a cow, and the whole body was covered in cyan scales, and its imposing manner was extraordinary!

That is the ancient holy beast - the unicorn!

"Hey! That's the unicorn holy beast! Sister Yue'er, your chance has also appeared!"

Xiao Luan's face was full of excitement.

Qiyue is also very excited!

Their Qi family is the descendant of Qilin, and this inheritance is perfect for her.

"Luan'er, let's go!"

At the moment, the two little girls flashed and rushed towards the direction of the projection of the holy beast.

It didn't take long for the two to arrive at the place where the holy beast was projected!

That's near a huge star!

Look at that star, it's the size of the sun!

At this moment, in the void next to the star, two huge light holes appeared!

The projections of the Vermillion Bird and the Qilin are emitted from the two light holes!

Obviously, the inheritance of Suzaku and Qilin is in those two light caves!

Seeing this, Qiyue and Xiaoluan'er were very excited!

However, the two little girls were not in a hurry to harvest the inheritance, but looked up at the front, and there was still a person standing there.

At this moment, that person also looked at Qiyue and Qiyue with a look of surprise!

The two sides looked at each other for a while, and the man took the initiative to fly over.

"It turned out to be two girls! I don't know where is brother Qin Feng now?"

The visitor takes the initiative to speak.

It turned out that this person is Qingdi!

He recognized at a glance that Qi Yue and Xiao Luan'er were subordinates beside Qin Feng.

He has always been in awe of Qin Feng!

What's more, the two of them are of the same blood, so naturally he is very polite to Qiyue and Qiyue.

When the two of Qiyue first saw Qingdi, they were in awe.

This guy is a powerful man in the middle stage of the God King, and he is the strongest existence in the Holy Land except Qin Feng.

At this time, they saw that Qingdi's attitude was so gentle, and the guard in their hearts was slightly lowered.
