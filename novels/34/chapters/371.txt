Accumulated 596 points!

The goal of 600 points is just one line away!

Qin Feng happily picked up the pass and flew to the Shenka Hall not far away.

After a while, he landed on the square, put away the wings of the wind, and walked towards the entrance of the God Card Hall.

After reaching the entrance of the temple, Qin Feng took the pass and stepped into the door of light.

Om~!

A clear sound of heaven and earth!

The pass lit up with golden light, then turned into a light group, pouring into his body...

[Reminder: The pass order (Eighth Layer) has come into effect. From now on, you can freely enter and exit the Eighth Hall, and there will be no guardian spirit beasts to block it. 】

In the next second, Qin Feng crossed the light gate and appeared in a magnificent corridor.

At the same time, a reminder came from Tiandao.

[Announcement from Longyuan Town: Mayor Qin Feng has entered the Eighth Hall of Vientiane - Shenka Hall, becoming the first person to enter the hall in District 1, and has received a +5 reputation reward. 】

[Reminder: Only the top three people in each district who enter the various temples will have prestige rewards. 】

Reputation again!

Accumulated 601 points, just reached the goal of 600 points.

The reward of 60,000 attribute points is coming soon.

All this, waiting for the prestige challenge to end.

Qin Feng laughed!

Feeling very comfortable!

"The ninth floor, I haven't even visited the prestige yet. If I go to the ninth floor again, I can get at least 616 prestige points!"

Qin Feng muttered in his heart.

Counting the time, there are still ten hours before the prestige challenge is over.

In such a long time, I wonder if he has any hope of breaking through to 700 points?

700 reputation points!

If this goal is reached, the reward will skyrocket to 80,000 attribute points.

After the reputation exceeds 500 points, the attribute reward will increase by 20,000 points for every 100 points.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng smiled and shook his head.

Secretly thinking that people are not enough, a snake swallows an elephant!

I'm a little greedy!

Then again, that's unlikely.

What's more, he still has to participate in the Shengwu assessment, so he doesn't have time to gain prestige.

Even if he wants to gain prestige, there is no goal or means.

Prestige is rare and not so easy to get.

It is generally known that killing a king beast can gain prestige.

But this king beast is also a rare beast, and it is not something that can be killed if one wants to.

In short, it's up to people!

His current task is to enter this **** card hall to see if there are any luck **** cards for sale.

Thinking that the luck **** card is a fifth-order **** card, the level is not high, there should be some opportunities, right?

Thinking of this, Qin Feng quickened his pace and walked towards the end of the corridor...

At the same time, in Area 1, somewhere in the jungle.

Turgenev and Xiaoyun were on their way, chatting.

"Friend Nev, how long will it take to arrive?"

"Senior, there are still about three hours or so! When we arrive, it is just when the eight major villages are besieging Longyuan Village. At that time, senior will be able to enjoy a good show."

Xiaoyun smiled but not smiled: "Haha! Interesting! In the past, when the ten thousand world hegemony and challenge forces were very united, they formed an alliance together. I didn't expect that you Blue Star people are so ununited!"

Turgenev was a little embarrassed: "To tell the truth, our Blue Star has never been unified, and all kinds of battles are constant. There is a country here, and it is a big mess."

"that country?"

"Lighthouse country! They claim to be the beacon of freedom and the benchmark of democracy, but they are actually a stinking **** stirrer that stirs **** all day long. Where there are disputes, there are definitely their shadows there!"

Xiao Yun disdainfully said: "In this way, the lighthouse country is a hypocritical country, and it must be extremely double-standard in dealing with things!"

Turgenev praised: "Senior's eyes are like torches! You are right! The lighthouse country has always been hypocritical and double-standard, as disgusting as it is."

Xiaoyun: "By the way, as you mentioned just now, eight villages besieged one Longyuan Village. It seems that you Blue Star people like to bully the weak! That Longyuan Village, I'm afraid it's going to be unlucky!"

Turgenev sighed: "Hey! Yes! This time, the situation in Longyuan Village is not good!"

Turgenev was a little helpless.

His impression of Longyuan Village is not bad, and he is somewhat regretful, but he does not want to be enemies with Miyamoto Lang and others.

In his opinion, Miyamoto Lang's eight village alliances, which are so many people, should be able to overwhelm Longyuan Village.

For this reason, he chose neutrality.

"By the way, senior, where did you get your prestige card?"

Turgenev asked the question he cared about most.

Xiao Yun said lukewarmly: "Little friend Nev, this is a secret, you don't need to ask more. You just need to know that when our cooperation is completed, the six prestige cards will be yours."

Turgenev hit a soft nail and had to smile.

Then, the two continued on their way.

Turgenev was in front, Xiaoyun behind.

At this moment, Xiao Yun looked at Turgenev's back and sneered in his heart.

In order to make Turgenev's heart move and agree to cooperate with them, their family spent a lot of money to get six prestige cards.

Reputation God Card!

Each one is level seven!

This Turgenev really wants to be beautiful, do you really think you can get it?

Xiao Yun showed a playful sneer.

If it weren't for this kind of prestige card, only the challenger could use it, and he would have used it himself.

No matter what, he brought out six precious Prestige God Cards, and naturally he has to bring them back, and one cannot be missing.

Chapter 325 Rare God Card

At the same time, the Yuan clan was stationed in a courtyard full of spiritual flowers.

Yuankong is bathed in the warm sunshine, strolling in the courtyard, and feeling comfortable.

Counting the time, there are only nine and a half hours left, and the prestige challenge will end.

The harvest season of the Yuan family is almost here~.

At this moment, there was a sound of footsteps behind him, and a slender and beautiful woman walked over quickly.

Just walking, it seems to be a little uncomfortable.

Yuan Kong glanced at the beautiful woman, and a smug smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

I was too crazy last night, but it made Ning Mei suffer a little bit.

"How's it going?"

Yuan Kong asked casually.

The beautiful woman Ji Ning hurriedly said: "Patriarch Hui, we have formed ten armies, each with 2,000 people, led by a prefecture-level peak elder. When the prestige challenge is over, the ten armies will go to the challenge force stronghold. ."

Yuan Kong smiled and nodded: "Very good! There are only ten challenge forces left in the No. 1 area, which is a relatively weak area. However, if you can wipe out these ten challenge forces in one fell swoop, the points you will gain are also very impressive!"

The seven major guardian forces in this area are actually surrounded by areas 1 to 10.

The Cang Clan and the Chi Clan are relatively close to Area 1.

Night Clan is relatively close to Districts 3 and 4.

The rest of the geographical conditions have their own pros and cons.

The No. 1 area is not the closest to the Yuan clan, and the Yuan clan chose to start with the No. 1 area because of the information announced by Tiandao.

As soon as the novice assessment is over, there are several challenger villages left in each area, and Tiandao will reveal it to the major guardian forces.

There are only ten challenger villages left in this area, while the other areas have a dozen to twenty.

In such a comparison, it seems that the No. 1 area is a bit weak.

Therefore, Yuan Kong chose to go far, and launched a prestige challenge to all the challenging forces in the No. 1 area.

In his opinion, the weaker the area, the less likely there will be a strong person with more than 200 reputation points.

That prestige challenge order is not easy to get.

He spent such a huge price to launch this challenge, and naturally he only wanted to get benefits, but he didn't want to get punished.

Weigh the pros and cons!

He chose the weakest District 1!

Of course, all of this is Yuankong's self-righteousness.

Tiandao only announced the number of challenger villages in each district, but did not announce the level of the villages.

Although there are only ten villages in District 1, there is Qin Feng's Level 5 Longyuan Town.

The reason why the number of villages in the No. 1 area is small is also related to Qin Feng.

At the beginning, if Miyamoto Lang and others kicked the iron plate and met Qin Feng, I was afraid that the number of villages established in the No. 1 area would reach about fifteen.

"Patriarch, if there is a person with more than 200 reputation points in the No. 1 area, it will be a little troublesome!"

Jining was still a little worried.

Yuan Kong didn't care: "Don't worry! The challenger in this world is from Xiaoqian World, and it is difficult to produce such outstanding talents. Besides, the No. 1 area is the weakest area around here."

"If District No. 1 can produce a powerhouse with a reputation of 200 points, I am afraid that other districts will be able to produce several. Therefore, it is the wisest choice for us to challenge District No. 1."

Yuan Kong is full of confidence.

He never doubted his decision.

Ji Ning breathed a sigh of relief: "I hope this time goes well! After all, such a challenge is a reward and a penalty of ten! If the challenger gets a reward of 10,000 attribute points, we will be deducted 100,000 attribute points. 100,000 attribute points are not A small number!"

Hearing this, Yuan Kong was also slightly moved.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Any challenge is risky!

The penalty of 100,000 attribute points really can't hurt.

If someone in an area code can get 30,000 attribute rewards, they will be deducted 300,000 attributes.

The penalty of 300,000 attribute points is even more terrifying!

However, this is absolutely impossible to happen!

With only those weaklings in Area 1, it is impossible to even reach 200 points. What should he worry about?

With this thought, Yuan Kong was in a relaxed mood again, thinking only in his mind that he would soon be able to reap the beauty of a lot of points.

Little did he know, a nightmare was slowly approaching.

That's more than a penalty of 300,000 attribute points...

At the same moment, the Temple of Vientiane, the eighth floor, on the tall corridor.
