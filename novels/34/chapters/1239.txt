Besides, he has already met the conditions for him to recognize his master!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng broke the blood clot and bounced towards the spirit flag.

Om~!

As soon as the cyan lotus flag absorbed the blood essence, it lit up with the light of the heavens!

In the next second, it turned into a blue light and poured into Qin Feng's body

After doing this, Qin Feng took a deep breath and walked to the Fengchan Heaven Monument excitedly!

This is his greatest achievement!

In more than four hours, the Holy Land opportunity will end.

He can't delay any longer!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng broke the blood again and bounced towards the monument in front of him!

Pa~! Pa~! Pa~!

hum~~!

Qin Feng poured out nine drops of blood essence in a row, and the monument lit up and made a shocking sound!

One is the beginning of the number, nine is the extreme!

Other treasures can be recognized as masters with just a drop of blood essence!

At this time, the aura of the Heaven Monument became more and more dazzling!

Qin Feng's intuition is that his soul is throbbing!

A special soul contract is beginning to be concluded

At the same time, Tiandao also sent a reminder

Om~! Om~! Om~!

At this moment, Qin Feng's body lit up with eight-color aura!

That means he is awakening the eight great avenues!

One of them is the Innate Avenue!

The Fengchan Heavenly Monument contains ten avenues, among which the fairy spirits and the human essence avenues, he has awakened!

The remaining eight avenues, he has not mastered yet, he is awakening at the moment

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, Qin Feng's momentum has skyrocketed wildly!

But before the awakening of Dao Dao was over, Tian Dao sent another reminder.

[Fengchan Tianbei has recognized you as the master! When you are in the **** position, the **** position level will automatically increase by one! 】

Hearing the prompt, Qin Feng was shocked, and he was stunned!

100 million combat power!

This is too exaggerated!

Boom~Long~Long~!

Before he could think about it, the universe trembled slightly!

At this moment, outside the Holy Land!

In the countless corners of the 4.7 universe, all the great powers in the sky are alarmed!

They sensed that the universe has launched some subtle changes!

Suddenly, one after another tyrannical and unparalleled Taoist thoughts rushed out from the major mysterious star fields and swept the universe!

That is an eternal and powerful Taoist thought!

Their Taoist thoughts are colliding, communicating, and annoyed!

who? !

Who is it? !

Who obtained the recognition of a certain 'Dao-level strange object'?

The nine 'Dao-level strange objects' are the key to controlling this universe!

All the eternal powers, all want to get it!

At this moment, they sensed subtle changes in the universe!

I know that there is a first-level strange object that recognizes the master!

This makes them annoyed, jealous, and envious!

Therefore, they want to find out as soon as possible, who succeeded?

In their opinion, it must be some eternal power, and they got it by chance.

They're going to find that lucky guy!

But after some exchanges, everyone can get nothing!

This made them angry and had to withdraw their Taoist thoughts.

Those 'eternal powers' never imagined that the person who obtained the 'Tao-level strange object' recognition is not the eternal realm power, nor the half-step eternity, but a False God realm kid!

That is Qin Feng!

At this moment, in the secret territory of the outer world!Nnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

A bucket-thick purple beam of light descended from the sky and enveloped Qin Feng!

The chance reward has arrived!

At this moment, Qin Feng's prestige, luck, and combat power are skyrocketing wildly.

Chapter 923 Xuan Huang Hongmeng! Ten-grade **** position!

In the next second, Qin Feng's two main bodies appeared in the Jiuzhongtian secret territory.

At this moment, Ji Yang's body looked around.

I saw that there was a sea of ​​clouds all around, boundless, and the rays of light were everywhere!

This scene is very similar to Tianwaitian!

Jiyang's body continued to look forward again, there were two large altars on the left and the right!

Above the two altars, there is a huge golden lotus flower with thirty-six petals, and the whole body exudes an extremely sacred atmosphere!

In fact, those two golden lotus platforms are gods!

Godhead is a golden light wheel!

The divine position is a golden lotus pedestal!

By refining these lotus platforms and integrating them into one's own body, you can be promoted to the realm of true gods!

Having said that, the **** position is divided into nine grades!

The first-grade **** position is a rosette with four petals in bloom!

The second-grade **** seat is a rosette with eight petals blooming!

The third rank is a rosette with twelve petals blooming!

And so on, for every rank higher, four more petals will open!

The ninth-grade **** seat is a lotus seat with thirty-six petals blooming!

In this Jiuzhongtian secret realm, there are only two ninth-grade gods, and they are also the highest gods that have been derived since the birth of this universe!

So far, they have never been obtained!

If you compare carefully, these two gods are not the same!

The **** on the left has a yellow glow in the aura!

The **** seat on the right has a purple glow in the aura!

Ji Yang was curious, and first peeked out to the **** position on the left

[Nine-Rank Divine Statue (Xuanhuang): This Divine Throne contains the 'King's Dao', the 'Xuanhuang Dao' (innate)! 】

[Reminder: Refining this divine position can awaken the 'King's Dao', 'Xuanhuang Dao (Xiantian)'! 】

After reading this, Ji Yang's body was surprised and delighted!

It turns out that the high-grade gods have their own avenues.

By refining it, you can obtain the Dao contained in it, and the benefits are amazing!

What surprised him even more was that among the two avenues contained in the ninth-grade divine position (Xuanhuang), there was actually one of the innate avenues, called the Xuanhuang avenue!

That's exactly what he needs!

Suppressing his excitement, he looked at the ninth-rank **** on the right again.

[Nine-Rank Divine Throne (Hongmeng): This Divine Throne contains the 'Road of Kings', the 'Road of Hongmeng' (Xiantian)! 】

[Reminder: Refining this divine position can awaken the 'King's Dao' and the 'Hongmeng Dao']

Boom~!

The anode body is full of surprises again!

Another opportunity for the innate avenue appeared!
