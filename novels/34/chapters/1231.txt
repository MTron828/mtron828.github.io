The whole world is left with its own pavilion, which is also placed next to the ginseng fruit tree

Strange 19 Strange!

Why is the city lord's palace gone?

Qingchengzi looked up at the sky subconsciously, and saw that above the nine heavens, a new world space appeared!

There is a mainland hanging in the sky, with temples and pavilions on it, a jade pond, and a peach forest in Renshui, just like a fairyland in the sky!

Afterwards, he consciously overlooked the land of nine secluded places, and spied into a dark space, which contained the innate demon land‚Äîthe sea of ‚Äã‚Äãblood!

Boom~!

Seeing this, he finally knew what was going on, and was immediately excited.

"City Lord! You have evolved into the Three Realms?"

Qin Feng nodded with a smile.

Qingchengzi was overjoyed: "City Lord! So, you can recruit the Supreme Being of the Three Realms?"

Qin Feng said with a smile: "This deity called you to come here just for this!"

Qingchengzi hurriedly said: "City Lord! I hope you can give your subordinates a place in the Three Realms!"

Qin Feng smiled: "When I return to the Blue Star Realm, I will migrate the creatures from the Blue Star Realm to this place. They are not suitable for going to the heaven, nor to hell, they are only suitable for staying in this world!"

"So, this deity urgently needs a manager of the human world. I plan to give you a supreme place in the human world. Are you willing?"

Qingchengzi was pleasantly surprised: "My subordinates are willing!"

"Okay! Then the deity starts to recruit!"

As soon as the voice fell, Qin Feng broke the blood and started to slide his fingertips to condense the Supreme Divine Seal in the air.

Looking at the scene, Qingchengzi was excited and nervous.

He's been waiting too long for this day!

He has always hoped that he can become the envoy-level confidant of the city lord like Styx and Burning Lantern.

Now, this wish is about to come true!

Soon, Qin Feng condensed a seal of the supreme messenger of the human world, and pressed his finger to Qingchengzi's eyebrows

Om~!

Suddenly, the seal of the gods rang out, and the aura was released!

As soon as the Divine Seal approaches Qingchengzi's eyebrows, it slowly penetrates into the depths of Qingchengzi's eyebrows at a speed visible to the naked eye.

The supreme soul contract began to be slowly concluded

Tiandao also sent a reminder

[Reminder: You are recruiting 'Qingchengzi' to be the 'Supreme Envoy' of the human world]

„ÄêSuccessful solicitation! 'Qingchengzi' has become the 'Supreme Envoy' of the human world, and he can sacrifice his combat power to you! „Äë

[Supreme Envoy (Human Realm): He has certain management authority over all beings above quasi-gods in the human realm! „Äë

At this point, the solicitation is over!

Qin Feng retracted his finger!

Qingchengzi also slowly opened his eyes, his face full of surprise.

After looking at himself for a while, he saluted Qin Feng very respectfully.

"Thank you master for making it happen!"

Qingchengzi's tone was full of respect.

After becoming the supreme messenger of the human world, he respected Qin Feng even more deeply in his heart, and even changed his name.

Qin Feng is also in a good mood!

The success of recruiting Qingchengzi means that he can sacrifice 2.6 billion more combat power!

Immediately, he smiled and said: "Okay! The recruitment is complete! In the future, you can properly manage these people who are above the quasi-god in the human world!"

"Yes! Master!"

Qingchengzi respectfully took the order.

"By the way, master, the quasi-divine realm of this universe is similar to the loose immortals in our mythology of Longbi. If you say that, is this subordinate's current status the ancestor of the earth immortals in the human world?"

Qingchengzi suddenly had this interesting idea.

Qin Feng smiled without saying a word.

He also thought that there is also an ancestor of the earth immortal in the myth of Longyi, whose name is Zhenyuanzi, and there is also a ginseng fruit tree in his hand, and the established Taoism is also called Wuzhuangguan!

In such a comparison, Qingchengzi is indeed very similar to it!Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

Immediately, he said: "If you want to proclaim yourself the 'Ancestor of Earth Immortals', then the deity will allow you! At least in my universe, you can have such a self-proclaimed title!"

Qingchengzi rejoices!

With Qin Feng's words, he is equivalent to having the decree of heaven, and in the future he will

You can call yourself that.

At the moment, he quickly thanked: "Thank you master!"

Qin Feng smiled and said nothing.

"Hey! Di Jiang and Jumang also came out!"

At this moment, Qin Feng raised his head slightly, his eyes traveled through time and space, and he saw the outside world!

At this moment, he saw Di Jiang and Jumang fly down from the Conferred God List

The two little guys are full of joy, they should be promoted successfully!

"Let's go! Let's go out and see!"

Qin Feng wanted to know what strength did Di Jiang and others have after breaking through to the real **** realm?

The strength of Di Jiang and others has a great influence on him.

He has to deal with Puyin Tianzun, and he has to rely on these confidants.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng waved his hand, and the two disappeared in the center of the universe

The next second, the two returned to the hall of the True Temple!

"Hey! Dad!"

"Owner!"

Feng Xi and the girls are exchanging resources by the altar.

As soon as they saw Qin Feng appear, they stopped the exchange and went up to meet each other.

Qin Feng also smiled and looked at the girls!

Seeing this, he was in a good mood.

I saw that all the women had reached the real **** realm, and their strength had skyrocketed!

Even the weakest Qiyue has a combat power of 2.7 billion stars, which is even stronger than Qingchengzi.

And the strongest Yu Xuanji has a combat power of 3.4 billion stars!

"Dad! We have broken through to the realm of true gods!"

At this moment, Xiao Luan'er said excitedly.

"Well, everyone did a great job!"

Qin Feng nodded with a smile.

"Dad! Dad! We have also been promoted successfully!"

At this time, Di Jiang and Jumang also rushed over.

"Little Emperor, Xiaoju, you finally figured it out!"

Xiao Luan'er happily greeted him.

Qin Feng hurriedly looked at the two little guys.

Seeing this, he was very happy!

I saw that the combat power of Jumang reached 5.3 billion stars, and Dijiang reached 5.5 billion stars!

The improvement of these two little guys far exceeds that of Feng Xi and the other five!

Obviously, the benefits brought by the fifth-grade **** position are much greater than that of the fourth-grade **** position.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng was even more looking forward to the ninth-grade **** position.

"Very good! You two are doing a great job!"

Qin Feng sincerely praised the two little guys.

Di Jiang and Jumang immediately smiled.

"Wow! Xiaodi, Xiaoju, your combat power has exceeded 5 billion! This is comparable to a quasi-god king!"

At this time, Xiao Luan'er saw the progress of the two younger brothers, and was immediately amazed.

Fengxi, Qiyue, Yu Xuanji, and Qingchengzi also showed envy.

Qin Feng sees all this in his eyes and is happy in his heart.

After this realm promotion, the strength of these confidants has soared!

Now the seven people of Dijiang, plus Zhu Rong, Gonggong, Styx, and Lantern, can give him a total of about 800 million combat power!

This is definitely a huge strength boost!

Can play a decisive role at critical moments!

At this moment, Yu Xuanji's voice sounded beside Qin Feng.

"Master, the concubine found that the five of us obtained the fourth-rank **** position, and the increased combat power was about 1.5 billion. The fifth-rank **** position obtained by Di Jiang and Jumang, the increased combat power was about 3 billion, which is almost the same. Twice as many as us!"

With this reminder, Xiao Luan'er's eyes lit up.

"Yes! Sister Xuanji is right! Could it be that every time you increase a **** rank, your combat power will increase by 2 times?"

"If you calculate it like this, the sixth-rank **** position can increase the combat power by about 6 billion, the seventh-rank can increase the combat power by about 12 billion, the eighth-rank can increase the combat power by about 24 billion, and the ninth-rank is about 48 billion!"

"About 48 billion! It's almost 500 million! Dad, you can get two ninth-rank gods, but you can get 100 million combat power!"

The more Xiao Luan'er analyzed, the more shocked!

Everyone was amazed!

They all felt that Xiao Luan'er analyzed it well. If the ninth-rank **** position can really increase the combat power by about 500 million, it would be too terrifying!

Even Qin Feng's heart became hot after listening to it!

Immediately, Yu Xuanji said curiously: "Master, what Xiao Luan'er said is very reasonable! My concubine also thinks that the ninth-rank **** position can only increase the combat power of 500 million stars!"

Qin Feng took a deep breath: "It's hard to say! After all, these are all guesses!"

Yu Xuanji smiled and said: "Master, if there is any, you will know if you go to Jiuzhongtian and try it!"

Qin Feng smiled slightly: "I have other plans, I can't go for the time being! By the way, if you have Holy Land points in your hands, hurry up and go to the mall to exchange resources."

"After exchanging the resources, you can go to the land of the gods and see if you can get some more ancient opportunities!"

"Oh!"

When everyone heard Qin Feng's order, they went to exchange resources.

In fact, Qin Feng didn't plan to tell everyone about the plan to go to Tianwaitian, lest they worry!

Besides, going to the outer world to challenge, you can only challenge alone!

Time flies!

After half an hour, Yu Xuanji and others finished the exchange.

They have all exchanged it, and the most desired artifact equipment has received a lot of money.
