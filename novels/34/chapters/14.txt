Majestic Desert Splendor
0.00 / 0.00

Blood spurted out from the snake's neck like a water column.

The fang-toothed wild boar, saber-toothed rabbit, and mutant black rat who were chasing down were stunned when they saw this scene.

Fuck it~!

This human is too strong!

He actually killed the most powerful venomous ten-ring snake.

Whoo~! Whoo~!

The tusk boar gasped a few times, turned around and fled.

Seeing this, the saber-toothed rabbit and the mutant black rat also turned around and ran away.

The three vicious beasts burrowed back into the cave at once and disappeared...

Qin Feng had a chance to breathe, his eyes were slightly hot, and his eyesight was gradually recovering.

It turned out that his physique had +100% anti-toxicity.

If it is replaced by another level 2 powerhouse, the first time the poisonous mist erodes his eyes, he will be blinded on the spot.

Instead of being like him, he can slowly restore his vision.

At the same time, the ten-ring snake whose head was severed twitched a few times on the ground, then stopped moving, and a white light lit up on its body...

Om~!

In the next second, a dazzling white light flew from its body and poured into Qin Feng's body...

Qin Feng's whole body lit up with a dazzling white light

In the next second, his skin discolored due to poisoning, his eyes with damaged eyesight, and his chest bruised by the tusk boar, were washed away by those energies and recovered rapidly at a speed visible to the naked eye...

After a while, the white light disappeared.

His vision was completely restored, his skin was smooth again, healthy and shiny, and the internal wound on his chest was completely healed, no longer aching.

Even, his whole person became more robust, and even his height increased by one centimeter.

Upgraded!

He has leveled up again!

It turns out that upgrading can not only strengthen the physical body, but also eliminate some negative states.

This time, he escalated too soon.

Now, he is back in his prime.

wrong!

He is now upgraded, and his strength is stronger than before!

[Succeeded in killing the poisonous ten-ring snake! The Black Iron Treasure Chest is Exploded! 】

Fuck it~!

exploded!

1% explosion rate!

It exploded again!

Qin Feng was pleasantly surprised, and turned around quickly to see that the snake corpse lit up with white light, and a black iron treasure chest appeared out of thin air.

He hurried forward to pick up the treasure

PS: Has anyone watched it?

New book for data! Ask for various, evaluations, monthly passes, and rewards.

The data is not going up and down, I am uneasy!

Chapter 16 Huge discovery, unique!

Qin Feng directly opened the treasure chest.

Om~!

A burst of white light came on.

The treasure chest disappeared, and he had a black ring in his hand, which was exquisite and simple.

【Treasure box opened successfully! Get the first-order item - low-level storage ring! 】

[Low-level storage ring: There are ten cubic meters of dimensional space inside, which can be used to store items. 】

Great!

It even opened a storage ring!

This is exactly what you need.

Having said that, although this low-level storage ring is a first-order item, its value and use are comparable to second-order equipment.

Qin Feng was very satisfied.

He happily put on the storage ring, and when he thought about it, he could sense the storage space in the ring.

Then, he took off the package on his back.

There were four exquisite steel knives and four novice short knives in the package.

Immediately, he stuffed all eight knives into the storage ring.

Those knives are resources, and when Tiandao opens the trading system, he can exchange items with others.

Having said that, he has been carrying so many knives on his back, which greatly affects his fighting performance.

Now with the storage ring, all problems are solved.

After doing this, he began to extract the giant snake...

【Endless extraction success! Get 3 energy attributes! 】

Great! Gained 3 more attributes.

The attribute points provided by mutant beasts are higher than ordinary beasts.

Having said that, he has risen to level 3, so his strength should have improved a lot!

Thinking of this, he quickly called up his attribute panel.

【Name】: Qin Feng

[Level]: Level 3 (30/600)

【Reputation】: 1

[Strength]: 40 (power crazy, D level)

[Agility]: 46 (speed enhancement, E level)

[Physical]: 48 (strengthen constitution, E level, anti-poison +100%)

[Energy]: 57 (supervision of vision, E grade; enhanced sense of smell, F grade)

[Born talent]: Endless extraction (SSS level),

[Skill]: Eye of True Sight

[Combat Strength Evaluation]: 4 stars

[Free attribute]: 10

"Not bad! Not bad! The combat evaluation has reached 4 stars!"

Qin Feng was overjoyed.

His combat power assessment is 4 stars, so his overall strength should be able to reach 6 stars.

In addition, he still has 10 free attributes, but he is not in a hurry to add it.

By the way, I have been upgraded, so the level ranking should also be improved, right?

Thinking of this, Qin Feng entered the list channel.

[No. 911 Novice Village Level Ranking]

First place: Liu Xuan, level 3.

Second place: Longshan, level 3.

Third place: Wu Yong, level 3.

Fourth place: Qin Feng, level 3

Fifth place: Gu Ming, level 2

6th place: Yu Wen, Level 2

Seventh place, Lei Jue, level 2

…

Sure enough, he rose to fourth place.

However, Longshan and Wu Yong also rose to level 3, lining up in front of him.

In addition, there are already more than twenty people who have risen to level 2.

It seems that this hour, everyone is working hard to upgrade.

In fact, during this hour, Qin Feng spent most of his time on the road.

At the moment, he exited the Tiandao light screen and looked at the snake corpse at his feet.

At this moment, when his heart moved, he stepped forward to cut the snake's head, and carefully took out the venom gland from it.

Afterwards, he inserted the tip of a knife into the poison gland and stained it with some highly poisonous.

The tip of the blade, which was originally silvery and cold, immediately became blue and bark, exuding a soul-stirring poisonous light.

Then, he carefully wrapped the remaining poison glands with the rags that he had previously wrapped, and then stuffed them into the storage ring, keeping them as spares.

After doing this, Qin Feng took a deep breath, carried the sword, and walked towards the cave.

There are also three mutant beasts, waiting for him to kill!

In his opinion, as long as he kills those three beasts, he should be able to surpass Long Shan and Wu Yong in one fell swoop, and even catch up with Liu Xuan.

After a while, Qin Feng came to the entrance of the cave.

Looking at the dark cave, his face was solemn.

He was not worried that the three mutant beasts would join forces. With his current strength, it would not be difficult to kill the three beasts.

What he was worried about was that there might be some terrifying existence behind these three beasts...

No matter what, he had to go in and see what happened.

Thinking of this, he took a deep breath, clenched the handle of the knife, and walked carefully into the cave...

As soon as you step into the cave, you are greeted by the damp musty smell and the choking **** smell.

Qin Feng held his breath and walked forward carefully.

The cave is very dark.
