Boom~!

The two masters of the Azure Dragon Territory were shocked, and they almost thought they heard it wrong!

The two looked at Qin Feng in disbelief!

From the time they watched the battle to the time they left, Qin Feng has always been at a disadvantage!

How could he lead two people, one to escape, the other to fall? !

After being stunned for a while, the Azure Dragon Domain Master swallowed his saliva and said, "Fellow Daoist Qin Feng, this is no joke!"

Qin Feng smiled!

It seems that this Azure Dragon Domain Lord does not believe it!

"Then look at what this is?"

At the moment, Qin Feng held a hand, and a purple token appeared in the palm of his hand.

The two characters 'Hongyuan' are engraved on the front and the two characters 'Brightness' are engraved on the back, and the whole body exudes an extraordinary atmosphere!

Boom~!

Seeing the token, the Azure Dragon Domain Lord was shocked again!

"Oh my god! That's the domain owner token! It's the token of the bright domain owner!"

Venerable Ziyuan exclaimed loudly!

If you want the domain owner token, you must kill the domain owner to get the token!

At this moment, the two of Qinglong stared at the token, completely dumbfounded!

The atmosphere in the field has also become extremely quiet!

It took a long time for the two of them to recover!

The look in Qin Feng's eyes has completely changed!

Chapter 952 Daluo Tianjing! Venerable Brahma!

After a long time, the master of Qinglong looked at Qin Feng with awe

"It was Qing who underestimated fellow Daoist Qin Feng!"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord is sighing endlessly!

Venerable Ziyuan was even more trembling and dared not look up to Qin Feng!

Lord Qin Feng can kill even a half-step peak, and his strength is so strong that he can't imagine it.

At this time, the Azure Dragon Domain Lord looked at the token in Qin Feng's hand again!

"Fellow Daoist Qin Feng, this 'Domain Master Token' is a rare treasure! It's a pity that you were not born in the Guangxingxingyuan. If you are a member of the Guangxingxingyuan, as long as you have a first-class star-lord, you can succeed as a new one. The Lord of the Light Domain!"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord casually mentioned it.

Qin Feng smiled without saying a word.

He is not very interested in the position of domain master!

The position of the 'Master of the Universe' on this side is his goal!

At the moment, he smiled and said: "It doesn't matter if I become the master of the light domain. I wonder if I destroy this token, will it have some bad influence on the light domain?"

The Azure Dragon Domain Master was stunned!

Immediately, he shook his head and smiled bitterly: "Brother Qin Feng, it is useless for you to destroy it! As long as it is destroyed, this order will be re-condensed in the Daluo Temple of God!"

"Daluo God Hall?! Where is it?"

Qin Feng was quite curious.

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord smiled and said, "The Hall of the Great Luoshen is the place where the title of Star Lord of the entire universe is assessed, and it is also the place where the Lord God Realm is promoted!"

Qin Feng's eyes lit up: "Hey! The promotion place of the main **** realm and the star master assessment place are actually the same place! That's a coincidence!"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord was startled: "Yes! Brother Qin Feng is still in the realm of the real gods, just where he can go to advance to the realm! Having said that, brothers Qin Feng are in the realm of real gods, and they have such terrifying strength. They can be said to be arbitrary and unique in the universe! "

Speaking of this, the Azure Dragon Domain Master was amazed!

Afterwards, he asked again: "Right! Brother Qin Feng, have you obtained the Star Master Assessment Order?"

Qin Feng smiled slightly: "There is exactly one!"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord smiled and said, "That's great! Two days later, it's the time for the Star Lord assessment. This Star Lord assessment is only opened once every thousand years, and the location is in the Da Luotian territory, while the Lord God assessment is only opened once every hundred years. "

"This year's Star Lord assessment and the Lord God Realm assessment have just overlapped at 20! Then the number of players entering the Great Luotian Realm this time will be several times that of the past. The scene will definitely be very lively!"

Hearing this, Qin Feng's eyes showed joy again.

He was still thinking just now, is there any way to bring Dijiang, Houtu and other confidants in, so that they can also be promoted to the main **** realm!

After all, they are also in the real **** realm!

If Di Jiang, Hou Tu and others are also promoted to the main **** realm, their combat power will definitely increase!

At that time, Di Jiang and others can also sacrifice more combat power to him.

This will be of great help to him in the next acquisition of the 'Judgment Domain Master Inheritance'!

"That's right! Qinglong Taoist friend, why are the Star Lord assessment and the Lord God assessment conducted in the Daluo Temple?"

Qin Feng asked curiously.

The master of the Azure Dragon Domain said: "You can get a godhead when you advance to the virtual **** realm! You can get a **** status when you are promoted to the true **** realm! You can get a godly title when you are promoted to the main **** realm! To become a master **** is equivalent to having a title in this universe, and you can receive the grace of heaven!"

"The same reason, becoming a star master is also equivalent to having a title in this universe! Its title is higher than that of the main god, but it is more difficult to obtain!"

"So, the title of Star Lord is also known as Star Lord! It is the same place where the title is granted, so it will naturally be in the same place."

"Actually, when the Lord of the Universe was still alive. He presided over this kind of title award! Now that the Lord of the Universe is vacant, it is held by the God-given Lord, which is the Tao of Heaven!"

Qin Feng nodded slightly: "So it is! By the way, why is the assessment of the Lord God once a hundred years and the assessment of the Star Lord once a thousand years?"

The Azure Dragon Domain Master unlocked: "Once a thousand years, that is to take care of the challenger! Every thousand years, Tiandao will select some people from many small thousand worlds and large thousand worlds to enter this universe, and those people are the challengers. !"

"Tiandao will favor the challengers, so that they can quickly awaken from the brutal killing and become a star master! It is rumored that among the challengers selected every thousand years, there will be a group of bloodlines of the previous master of the universe!"

"Actually, such a challenger selection system is also the last obsession of the Lord of the Universe. It is not easy for Tiandao to miss him, so he started such a selection according to his obsession!"

Hearing this, Qin Feng suddenly felt in his heart!

It turned out that the selection of the challengers was actually the obsession of the previous Lord of the Universe!

Wanting to take office as the lord of the universe, he just wanted to use this method to transfer his inheritance to his bloodline descendants!

And Long Bi is his blood descendant!

Qin Feng is naturally one of them, and it is also the target of key training!

It all seems like a coincidence, but it's not a coincidence!

Taking office as the Lord of the Universe is a painstaking effort!

At this time, the Azure Dragon Domain Lord said again: "It's been a thousand years in the blink of an eye! I wonder if this group of challengers has the bloodline of the Lord of the Universe?"

"Actually, those challengers from outside are very weak! Especially those challengers from Xiaoqian World are even more weak!

"In short, every thousand years, the challengers who can be promoted to become Star Lords are less than five, and they are still the weakest fifth-rank Star Lords! By the way! Brother Qin Feng, are you not a challenger?"

Qin Feng smiled: "What a coincidence! I am really a challenger!"

Boom~!

As soon as these words fell, the Azure Dragon Domain Lord's expression froze, slightly embarrassed!

Venerable Ziyuan was even more shocked!

It was the first time he had seen a challenger with such terrifying strength.

Soon, the Azure Dragon Domain Master recovered from the embarrassment.

"It turns out that Brother Qin Feng is a challenger! It's Qing Mou who is stupid! I didn't expect that Brother Qin Feng could have such strength as a challenger. Qing Mou really admires it!"

"By the way! Brother Qin Feng, since you are a challenger, you can trigger the assessment of the special star-lord!"

Qin Feng was puzzled: "Special Star-Lord? As far as I know, the highest Star-Lord is also the first class. Is the special class higher?"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord smiled and nodded: "That's right! On top of the first-class star-rank, there are also special-rank titles, but they can only be activated by challenging them. No one has been able to trigger it since the beginning of the Li session!"

"After all, to win the first-class star-lord, you need the strength of the god-king's great perfection. According to this deduction, to trigger the special-class star-lord, at least half a step of eternity is required! However, Qin Feng brothers are fully qualified for this!"

Qin Feng's eyes lit up: "It turns out that there is such a thing! I don't know what kind of benefits can I get after getting the characteristic Star Lord?"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord said with a look of longing: "The benefits are naturally great! Let me tell you so! As a challenger, if you get a first-class star lord, you can promote your planet to a first-class sanctuary!"

"It is rumored that the resources of the first-class sanctuary are as rich as a small star field, which is unimaginable. If you obtain a special star, you can be promoted to a special sanctuary, and its resources are comparable to a medium star field!"

Hearing this, Qin Feng's eyes lit up, and he was immediately moved!

If he can obtain a special star-rank and a resource reward comparable to a medium star field, it will be of great help to him!

After being excited, Qin Feng remembered something.

"That's right! Fellow Daoist Qinglong! As far as I know, the stars in this universe are divided into four levels. Small, medium, large, and super. The Bright God Realm can only be regarded as a medium-sized star field!"

"Just a few, such as Judgment God Domain and Peeping God Domain, can be regarded as super star domains. Since for our challengers, the first-class sanctuary corresponds to the small star domain, and the special sanctuary corresponds to the medium star domain!"

"Is there a higher title, corresponding to the large star field and super star field?"

"This", the Azure Dragon Domain Master thought.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After a while, he shook his head with a wry smile: "This is not clear! After all, since the birth of this universe, no one has ever won a special title, and as for whether there is a higher title, no one knows!"

"However, with Brother Qin Feng's means and strength, you should be able to find it. If you look at Qing, it is very likely that it exists! After all, the Lord of the Sanctuary and the Lord of the Star Territory are on the same level, so naturally there will be equal grading. !"

Qin Feng nodded slightly: "I also think that there may be! If there is a higher title above the special class, it will take at least half a step of eternal strength to obtain it."

"If there is one more title that matches the super star field, it will take at least half a step to the peak, or even half a step to complete it!"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord also nodded slightly: "Yeah! If you want to get the title of the super star domain, maybe you really need half a step to complete it before you can hope to get it! After all, the domain owner of the super star domain is basically the existence of the Eternal Realm. !"

Qin Feng's heart froze!

If it takes half a step of eternal perfection to obtain such a title, he is a little dangerous.

With his current comprehensive strength, he will crush the peak of half a step, and he is not a perfect opponent for half a step!

It seems that he has to improve his strength before the Star Master assessment starts!

If he can reach the threshold of half-step Great Perfection, he will have a glimmer of hope!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng said, "Friend Qinglong, when will this planet reach the center of the Qinglong star field?"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord smiled and said, "Two days later, it's almost time for the Star Lord assessment to start! When the time comes, Qing will help you protect this planet, you can go to the assessment with confidence!"

Qin Feng was overjoyed: "Thank you Qinglong Daoist friend! Qin has written down this favor!"

"Brother Qin Feng, you don't need to see the outside world! You are also a child born in the Azure Dragon Star Region, and you have a feeling of the same region!"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord is also in a good mood!

He is determined to befriend Qin Feng, and he is happy to hear Qin Feng say this.

"Anyway, I would like to thank Daoist friends this time! By the way, Brother Qinglong, if I go to the assessment, will the venerable accomplices come to make trouble again?"

Qin Feng expressed his concerns again.

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord smiled slightly: "Although I am not an opponent of the Venerable, but in my own lair, I can use the power of heaven and earth of thousands of planets to achieve the strength of half-step eternal great perfection!"

"At that time, even if I invite the Venerable, it will not be my opponent! In fact, each domain owner is the strongest in his own lair!"

Qin Feng was overjoyed: "In this way, I can rest assured! Brother Qinglong, the star master assessment will be conducted in two days. I will go to retreat again!"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord nodded: "Go! That's right! I almost forgot to tell you one thing, the 'Domain Lord Token' you got can be exchanged for some extremely rich treasures in the Daluo God Hall!"

Qin Feng was surprised: "There is such a thing! Then this token is not wasted!"

The Azure Dragon Domain Lord smiled and said, "It's natural! By the way, if you go to the Daluo Heavenly Realm for assessment this time, the Great Sacrifice Heaven will definitely make you stumped!"

"After all, he has a wide range of connections and many methods, so you have to be careful! Maybe, he has the means to secretly sabotage your Star Master assessment!"

Hearing this, Qin Feng took a deep breath.

He also thinks it is very possible!
