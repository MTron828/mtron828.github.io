"Jie~! Jie~! The old man wants to eat your meat!"

In the blink of an eye, more than a dozen evil ghosts had rushed forward.

Boom~!

At this moment, a monstrous flame erupted from Qin Feng's body.

Tier 4 skills - Hell Heaven!

Instant explosion!

Boom~Long~Long!

Waves of black and purple sky fire spread out to the surrounding, forming a large sea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãfire, sweeping the audience.

Ow~! Ow~! Ow~!

In the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãfire, the ghosts roared miserably.

When the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãfire subsided, the field was scorched, and the air was filled with the smell of burnt.

All the evil spirits were stunned, staring at Qin Feng in shock and anger.

Qin Feng also frowned slightly.

His hellfire still hasn't wiped out the ghosts.

It seems that the power of darkness in the Hellfire is not harmful to the ghosts. Only the power of flame can hurt the ghosts, but it is not enough to kill them.

At this moment, strange noises came from all directions.

Qin Feng looked up and saw that the evil spirits in the entire ancient town were disturbed.

At this moment, thousands of evil ghosts came to this side, each with a gloomy face and a suffocating spirit.

roar~!

At this time, the ghosts in the square roared and rushed towards Qin Feng again.

They were extremely angry.

A small 16th-level human, actually hurt them, this group of 30th-level evil spirits, **** it!

They are going to rush up and eat up the flesh and blood of this human being.

This time, even if this human casts flames again, they will desperately pass through the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãflames, pounce on this human, and kill him alive.

roar~!

In the blink of an eye, the ghosts approached again.

Qin Feng is about to cast Hellfire again.

Suddenly, a light flashed in his mind.

correct!

He has another way!

Om~!

As soon as his mind moved, a dazzling white light lit up his whole body, like a scorching sun in the sky, illuminating thousands of miles.

That was his newly mastered innate ability‚Äîthe bright talent!

Om~!

Suddenly, the sky and the earth are clear, and the light is thousands of miles!

roar~! roar~! roar~!

Wherever the rays of light passed, all the evil spirits melted away, turning into wisps of blue smoke in the tragic roars one after another.

Immediately afterwards, red spar stones fell from the blue smoke.

...

In the blink of an eye, the seventeen ghosts were melted and killed by the power of light, and all turned into blue smoke.

Seventeen red spar stones were also left on the square.

Qin Feng was overjoyed.

The power of light can really easily kill these ghosts!

He found a way to deal with these evil spirits.

At the same moment, the ghosts who came from all directions were dumbfounded when they saw this scene.

This human who is only level 16 has so many methods.

For a while it is the power of gold, for a while it is the power of darkness and fire, and for a while it is the power of light.

The most terrifying thing is that he actually mastered the power of light.

That's one of their nemesis.

The ghosts suddenly stopped, as if they did not dare to surround them.

roar~!

At this moment, a low roar sounded from the depths of the ancient town.

It was like an ancient beast that had been dormant for thousands of years, awakening at this moment.

As if receiving an order, the ghosts retreated into the darkness one after another, and their figures faded and disappeared.

Wow~la~la~!

Immediately afterwards, the lights in the town went out one by one.

In the blink of an eye, all the lights disappeared.

The bustling night market before disappeared in an instant, and it returned to the desolate ancient town, but it was more gloomy than the daytime.

In the air, there is a cold breath, and the atmosphere is very gloomy.

Qin Feng took a deep breath and walked down the teleportation array slowly.

Sand~! Sand~! Sand~!

At this moment, the mutation regenerated, and strange sounds came from all corners of the entire ancient town.

After a while, a surprising scene appeared

Chapter 163 The Earth Level Appears, Darkness and Light!

A moment later, an astonishing scene appeared...

Sand~! Sand~! Sand~!

I saw white ants crawling out of many dilapidated wooden houses, and some broke out of the ground.

Those white ants are about a foot long in size, strong in body, blood-red eyes, and thick front jaws, like two scimitars.

Looking at the number, there are thousands of them, and there are more and more ants coming out of the ground, and the number has been soaring!

Qin Feng couldn't help staring at it.

„ÄêFerocious Beast„Äë: Evil Spirit Termite

[Talent]: The True Meaning of Earth (C-level), Darkness Control (D-level)

„ÄêSkill„Äë:? ? ? ?

It turned out to be a giant termite colony!

Qin Feng suddenly remembered that in the daytime, when he collected fine iron materials in this town, he found that there were traces of termites gnawing everywhere.

Now that I think about it, it turned out to be the underground of this town, hiding a huge colony of termites.

Looking at the state of these evil ants, they are also being manipulated.

Could it be that the existence behind this thinks that ghosts can't deal with him, and that these ant colonies can deal with him?

Or does that person think that the evil spirit is afraid of his power of light, but these ant colonies are not afraid, so they sent these ant colonies to fight?

Sand~! Sand~! Sand~!

Just when Qin Feng was thinking wildly, thousands of evil ants killed them, and rushed forward one after another, not afraid of death.

Qin Feng sneered and held a seal in his hand.

Suddenly, the sky and the earth changed color, and the cold wind suddenly roared!ùí©eew updates ùíÇt nùíêvel/biùíè(.)com

Countless ice arrows and snow blades fell from the sky and shot towards the ant colony.

huh~! huh~! huh~!

Frost arrows penetrated one evil ant after another!

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

Another piece of snow blade, slicing the evil ants one by one!

Poof~! Poof~! Poof~!

Suddenly, the slurry shot up in the field, the limbs were all over the floor, and the air was filled with a sour smell.

Om~! Om~! Om~!

Immediately afterwards, one after another, white light of energy flew up from the ant corpses and poured into Qin Feng's body...

[Successfully kills the level 20 evil spirit termites and obtains +2300 energy points. „Äë

As a result, Qin Feng's upgrade progress has soared!

He was overjoyed.

Ferocious beasts are not easy to meet!

Ha ha!

These ant colonies are here to give him experience.

Since he encountered it, how could he miss it.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng increased the output of the ice storm.

huh~! huh~! huh~!

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

Suddenly, the sky and the earth were the same color as ice and snow, and countless ice arrows and snow blades raged.

The ant colonies were beheaded in pieces!

Just a quarter of an hour later, more than 3,000 evil ants were killed.

Om~!
