When~!

A clear cry!

A soft sound like a symphony of gold and iron!

The bear king's fur is as strong as steel.

The knife only left a white mark on the fur, but it didn't break the defense.

The huge anti-shock force shook Qin Feng's arms to the point of numbness, and the whole person retreated back.

Fuck it~!

In the state of madness, with the addition of physical talent, this bear king's defense has reached an astonishing level.

He couldn't break the defense.

Whoo~!

Before Qin Feng could stabilize his body, the bear king slapped it with another palm, bringing a gust of wind to the sky.

At this moment, Qin Feng's figure was not stable and could not be avoided, so he had to raise his sword!

Bang~!

A loud bang!

That palm sent Qin Feng flying out.

The Bear King just swayed slightly, without the slightest damage.

The huge bear paw did not even leave any white marks.

The bear's paw is the strongest part of the bear's body and has the strongest defense.

roar~!

Another roar!

The bear king chased after the victory and slaughtered again.

"Damn!"

Qin Feng turned over and stood up quickly.

Apart from the churning of blood in his chest, he did not suffer any harm.

Fuck it~!

This bear king's defense is so terrifying!

If you can't break its defenses, you can't kill it!

Seems like that's the only way to go!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng even placed the long knife in front of him, stroked the blade with his left hand, and wiped it slowly...

The next moment, the fire elements between heaven and earth, under the control of his mind, gathered on the blade.

This is his D-level elemental talent - flame manipulation!

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

In just a moment, the blade burned into a raging flame and turned into a long flaming sword.

In this dark night, it is very cool!

[Reminder: Your blood wolf sword is attached with the power of fire, fire damage +10! 】

Great!

It worked!

Qin Feng is overjoyed!Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Whoo~!

At this moment, the iron palm of the bear king struck again, bringing a gust of wind and swaying countless fallen leaves...

Swish~!

Qin Feng dodged and avoided the palm with ease.

At the same time, he swiped with a long knife, and a beautiful arc of fire was drawn in the air, like a red rainbow...

sigh~!

A little noise!

It was the sound of sharp blades cutting flesh, and there was also the smell of burnt flesh.

The knife cut through the body of the giant bear, leaving a wound dozens of centimeters deep, with blood flowing.

There are also burn marks around the wound!

Finally broke the defense!

The blood wolf sword adds fire damage, and finally breaks the defense of the bear king!

Qin Feng decided to pursue the victory.

roar~!

The bear king roared, withdrew his arm like lightning, and another huge palm slapped it...

Qin Feng quickly raised his sword to fight.

At the moment, one person and one beast are fighting.

Swish~! Swish~! Swish~!

In just a few rounds, Qin Feng left seven wounds on the giant bear, all of which were tens of centimeters deep, and blood was flowing...

At this moment, the blood wolf sword's tearing +100% feature came into play.

The wound opened by Qin Feng was difficult to heal, and the blood flowed endlessly, consuming the bear king's vitality bit by bit.

roar~!

The bear king was angry and helpless, desperately fighting Qin Feng.

For a time, the field was shattered, and it was earth-shattering.

The beasts within a radius of several miles were all startled by the movement here, and they all fled away, not daring to approach this battlefield.

In a blink of an eye, ten minutes passed.

Qin Feng left nearly a hundred wounds on the bear king.

The bear king's momentum was greatly sluggish, and the Vietnam War became more and more disadvantaged, and he was extremely anxious...

roar~!

Suddenly, it roared in the sky, revealing endless unwillingness in its voice.

In the next second, its huge beast body began to shrink rapidly, the blood in the hair was also fading, and the momentum also plummeted...

what!

It turns out that the bear king's madness has expired!

Qin Feng was secretly happy.

It was at this moment that the Bear King returned to his previous state of madness, and his combat power fell rapidly. He didn't even have the initial 12-star combat power, and only reached the 11-star limit.

As soon as it returned to its original shape, it turned and ran away!

"Can you escape?!"

Swish~!

In just one dodge, Qin Feng caught up with the bear king.

roar~!

The bear king was cunning, turned around suddenly, and the giant claws quickly digged towards Qin Feng's chest.

It actually came with a look back!

Qin Feng was prepared for a long time, one jumped up, easily avoided the claw, and at the same time slashed in the air, slashing down...

Poof~!

A crisp sound!

Blood shot!

The flaming long knife slashed directly into the Bear King's Heavenly Spirit Cover, submerging more than half of the blade...

roar~!

A mournful roar echoed in the night sky.

The bear king staggered a few steps and fell on his back.

Boom~!

The mountain-like beast body fell heavily.

There's a cloud of dust!

The next second, a very dazzling white light flew from the bear king and poured into Qin Feng's body...

Qin Feng was overjoyed.

[Succeeded in killing the violent bear king (king level)! Bronze treasure chest exploded! 】

I saw the bear corpse lit up with white light again, and a bronze treasure chest emerged...

exploded!

exploded!

It really exploded!

Or a bronze treasure chest!

This harvest is really wave after wave, it's not too cool!

He hurried forward and picked up the treasure chest. ...

Chapter twenty-ninth is fruitful

Soon, Qin Feng picked up the bronze treasure chest.

[Bronze Treasure Chest: 98% chance of opening second-order items, 2% chance of opening third-order items. 】

He didn't think much, and opened the treasure box directly.

A burst of white light came on.

The treasure chest disappeared, and there was a brown leather armor in his hand, which was also attached with a black cloak.

【Treasure box opened successfully! Get the second-order item - Bear King Battle Armor! 】

[Bear King Battle Armor: Defense +25, Fire Resistance +100%, Ice Resistance +100%. 】
