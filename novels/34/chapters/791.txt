The patriarchs of its mysterious forces are all powerful demigods!

Only a small half of the mysterious forces in the first division are demigods.

Behind the ten patriarchs, there are more than 700 people standing in the air, all of them are peak heaven powerhouses.

These are the top leaders of the ten clans such as the White Demon.

Below them, that is, on the square where the White Devils were stationed, more than 800,000 people gathered densely, and they were the children of the ten clans.

At this moment, they looked up at the sky expectantly, waiting for the arrival of Longyuan City

From time to time, there were discussions among the crowd.

"Everyone, Longyuan City is coming! I wonder how many people will come this time?"

"Let me see, at most 100,000 people!"

"Haha! It's only 100,000 people! It's not enough for our 800,000 people!"

"Of course! However, the real decision of the outcome depends on my ancestors."

"Don't worry! My ancestor is the ultimate power of the False God! Don't look at that Qin Feng is the patriarch of the Suppressing Heaven, and his strength may only be like the early days of the False God. Like that Yuanchu and Taishi are also the patriarchs of the Suppressing Heaven. It is also the early stage of the False God!"

"That said, Qin Feng is dead! Haha!"

As soon as the words fell, there was a burst of laughter from the crowd,

These ten clan disciples are full of confidence in the upcoming battle!

At the same time, above the sky.

White Demon Ancestor waited silently after putting his hands together.

Bai Ye was also chatting with the other nine patriarchs.

"Brother Bai Ye, what kind of strength do you think Qin Feng's child is?"

A black-faced man asked with a smile.

This is the patriarch of the Black Fang clan——�/

Bai Ye pondered: "It should have some strength! After all, he has condensed the divine artifact!"

The Black Tooth Race is the second division and the second-ranked mysterious force.

He was very unconvinced that Qin Feng could get the divine artifact.

Bai Ye nodded slightly: "This matter is indeed a bit strange! When Bai thinks about it, he also thinks that many things are unreasonable. In fact, whether Qin Feng is an artifact obtained by his strength will soon be known, because he is coming soon!"

"Yes! Looking at this map, it's a thousand miles away!"

覱馱鋱輣脣muscle./

But his voice fell, and the field changed suddenly!

Boom!

I saw the white demon clan stationed in the sky, suddenly shaking violently!

Everyone was shocked and looked up!

click! click! click!

In the next second, a thousand-zhang-long space crack suddenly burst into the void.

Immediately afterwards, a huge city in the sky slowly drilled out from the crack in the space and lay across the sky above the White Devil's station.

The giant city in the sky has a radius of hundreds of miles, covering the sky and the ground, and it is extremely huge.

As soon as it appeared, it blocked a lot of light in the sky, making the world dark.

"It's Longyuan City!"

"Qin Feng is here!"

The crowd exclaimed.

They saw the big red light spot on the map that marked Longyuan's lair, and jumped to the sky above the White Devil's station.

Obviously, the giant city in the sky in front of you is the old nest of Longyuan.

It turned out that in order to speed up the killing of the enemy, Qin Feng used the space jump of the floating city and arrived one step ahead!

Each time the space jump is cast, it needs to be recharged once.

He will not use it easily.

"Father, Qin Feng is finally here!"

"Senior White Demon! That kid is here!"

As soon as they saw the floating city, Bai Ye and others were excited.

They couldn't wait.

Ancestor White Demon also smiled.

He also waited a long time.

Qin Feng's child finally came to the door.

However, he was not in a hurry.

"Wait a minute, don't be impatient! Let's wait for Qin Feng to come out and see where the holy child is!"

Ancestor White Demon looked calm.

Everyone smiled slightly, and they were all calm, as if they had settled on Qin Feng.

call out!

At this moment, tens of thousands of meters in front of everyone, a white light flashed, and a handsome and extraordinary young man appeared out of thin air!

The person here is Qin Feng!

When he appeared, the little red light that represented him jumped on the map.

Bai Ye and the others immediately recognized his identity!

"He is Qin Feng!"

"So young!"

At first glance, everyone was amazed by Qin Feng's noble temperament.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After learning that the young man was Qin Feng, the group hurriedly looked at Qin Feng.

Even the White Demon Ancestor is no exception!

Soon, there was an exclamation from the crowd.

"How come you are in the realm of heaven!"

"Hey! It's really the realm of heaven!"

"No way?! This kid is the leader of the Heaven Suppression Force! He's actually at the Heaven Realm!"

The patriarchs of all the forces all showed a look of astonishment.

Then, the car was swept away, the badger collapsed, the saddle, the wreckage, and the wreckage of the badger. Relief /

I was stunned. The screen Φ mother porphyry is stunned and will continue to regret. /

Those higher-ups also joined in.

"Yeah! I thought this Qin Feng was very powerful, but I didn't expect it to be so unbearable!"

"Hehe! Heaven-level realm! This old man is also in the heaven-level realm! Just looking at the realm, he is not as good as the patriarchs, and I don't know how he got the heaven-suppressing artifact?"

"Generally speaking, the strength of the heaven-level realm reaches the pinnacle, that is, the peak of the heaven-level. Among us high-level, which one is not the peak of the heaven-level strength? Is there one weaker than him? Haha!"

As soon as these words fell, those people laughed.

In the field, there are more than 700 people who are the peak powerhouses.

At this moment, they felt that their strength was no different from Qin Feng's.

Bai Ye, people who are willing to take care of themselves, and those who are willing to do so.

Demigod realm to deal with heaven realm, it is not easy to capture.

Even the ancestor of the white devil shook his head slightly, with disappointment in his eyes.

He thought Qin Feng would be a master, so he waited for it.

I didn't expect it to be just a heaven-level ant!

In his eyes, no matter how strong the Heaven-level realm is, it is not bad to be able to reach the peak strength of a demigod.

But he is the ultimate power of the False God. He can easily kill even the middle stage of the False God. How can he put the peak of the demigod in his eyes.

At this time, Qin Feng was a little speechless.

He didn't expect that as soon as he appeared, he would be ridiculed by a group of people.

In particular, the more than 700 guys at the peak of the Heavenly Rank laughed happily and seemed to have found a sense of existence.

Qin Feng glanced at the people in front of him lightly, and was about to speak.

Then, I would like to pray to the old man for forgiveness. /

"Qin Feng, Hei thinks that you are only heaven-level. Even you are in such a low realm. You Long Yuan's children are not all in the earth-level realm, right?"

The words fell, and another patriarch quickly echoed.

As soon as the words fell, the patriarch glanced proudly behind him, and there were more than 700 peak heavenly powerhouses there.

Those peak-level powerhouses immediately showed a knowing smile!

call out! call out! call out!

But at this moment, a mutation occurred!

Thousands of Long Yuan disciples flew out of the floating city and came behind Qin Feng.

Hei Yu and others looked at them one after another!

"Why is it all in the realm of heaven!"

"Huh! Really!"

Seeing this, Hei Yu and the others were stunned!

In the blink of an eye, 40,000 Longyuan disciples gathered behind Qin Feng, and they were densely covered in half the sky!

Pure heaven realm!

boom! boom! boom!

In the next second, the momentum of those Long Yuan disciples unfolded, and all of them reached over 100,000 stars.

In other words, Long Yuan's 40,000 people are all above the peak of the sky!

boom!

This time, Hei Yu and the others were completely dumbfounded, their mouths wide open!

Before, they also laughed at Long Yuan as nobody!

They are also proud of their own side, more than 700 people are above the peak of the sky.

Unexpectedly, Long Yuan's 40,000 people are all criminals above the peak of the sky!

Seven hundred to forty thousand!

In this comparison, the Ten White Demon Clan looked very shabby!

At this moment, even the ancestor of the white devil showed a look of astonishment
