Qin Feng has come to the end and entered an incomparably magnificent hall.

The moment he stepped into the hall, he saw the noisy scene inside.

I saw that there were more than 100 people in the hall, and they were all full of emotion.

His arrival immediately alarmed everyone, and they all looked at him.

Soon, doubts appeared in the eyes of everyone.

Because they can't see Qin Feng's realm and level, or even Qin Feng's origin.

It turned out that Qin Feng used a secret technique to cover up some of his information.

This secret technique is extracted from the ruler.

"Strange! This guy's level and realm are actually invisible!"

"It is estimated that some kind of secret technique was used!"

"It should be!"

"To be honest, this young man has a good temperament, and he is very handsome. It makes people feel happy when he looks at it, it can be said to be pleasing to the eye!"

In the crowd, a woman was amazed.

With the improvement of his strength, Qin Feng's temperament has become more and more extraordinary, and he has a noble bearing, which gives him a different kind of charm.

"Haha! What's the use of looking good? In this world of slaughter, strength, money, and prestige are the more important things. The appearance is just a skin!"

"Yeah! Without strength, money and prestige, what's the use of being handsome? Do you want to eat soft rice?"

Some male challengers began to refute, and their tone was a little sour.

With Qin Feng's hearing, he naturally talked about these people and heard them clearly.

He smiled slightly, didn't bother to pay attention, and walked directly to an altar.

What he is most concerned about now is whether there are any luck cards for sale in this God Card Hall?

Having said that, the more than 100 people in this hall are all at the prefecture level.

And those who can enter this hall, the strength has reached the eighth level of the earth.

In such a short period of time, it is truly amazing that so many powerhouses have emerged from the Eighth Heaven.

And these people are just the tip of the iceberg in the world.

Moreover, these people belong to the challenger side.

Those who guard the forces and mysterious forces cannot enter the temple.

It can be seen that he cannot underestimate the heroes of the world.

Qin Feng thought as he walked to the altar in front.

In the hall, discussions continued.

"Brother, can you sell your **** card?"

"Don't sell it! Don't sell it! The **** cards sold by this **** card hall are all rare **** cards. I only have one purchase permission, so I bought such a card. How can I sell it to you?"

"Hey! Yes! The purchase threshold here is too high! It takes 300 reputation points to have the right to purchase. I've come here for nothing!"

"This friend, don't be discouraged, the old man's reputation is not enough, and it's a waste of time!"

"So is the little girl!"

"Haha! I'm afraid that there are more than 100 people in the field, and 90% of them have not reached 300 reputation points! Those who can buy God Cards in this temple are all powerful people!"

As soon as these words fell, the audience immediately resonated.

The crowd sighed with emotion.

When Qin Feng heard this, he was immediately full of expectations.

Someone just said that the **** cards sold in this **** card hall are all rare **** cards.

0

Maybe, there are really lucky cards for sale.

Thinking of this, he quickened his pace, walked to the altar, and pressed the crystal ball on the altar with one hand.

"Look! That guy is going to buy a **** card!"

"I wonder if he can buy a **** card?"

"I guess I can't buy it! There are more than 100 people in the audience, and only a dozen or so God Cards can be bought. This kid is thin and tender, and he is not a very powerful person at first glance. It is estimated that his reputation is not high. He is nine Cheng Jiu can't buy it either."

"You can't say that! You can't look like a person, and the sea can't be measured! Is it because you're handsome that you're not strong? I think you're Chi Guoguo's jealousy!"

"Cut! What's the use of being handsome? I don't care about being handsome, I only care about being strong and prestigious."

Just as everyone was talking about it, the crystal ball lit up with a dazzling white light.

Everyone was silent, and started to pay attention curiously.

At the same time, Qin Feng's mind was connected to the temple through the crystal ball.

In his mind, the voice of the spirit of the temple sounded.

„ÄêIt is detected that your reputation value has reached 601 points, congratulations on your four purchase rights.„Äë

[Reminder: When the prestige value reaches 300 points, you can get 1 purchase permission in the main hall; when it reaches 400 points, you can get 2 purchase permissions, and so on‚Ä¶.]

[Reminder: For each permission, you can only purchase one kind of God Card. „Äë

[Reminder: You can now enter the Temple Mall interface‚Ä¶.]

Hearing the prompt, Qin Feng thought and entered the mall interface.

He quickly clicked on the product list and pulled out a series of **** card lists.

A full list of **** cards!

There are third-order, fourth-order, fifth-order, and sixth-order ones.

And each of them is a rare type of God Card.

However, what he cares most about is the luck card.

At the moment, he browsed carefully.

Soon, he saw the target in the list column.

[Luck God Card: Fifth-Order God Card. „Äë

[Price: 100,000 Contribution Points]

[Reminder: Within a month, only one purchase is allowed. „Äë

Qin Feng is overjoyed, it really does!

However, this is a limited purchase category of God card.

Only one can be purchased in a month.

At the moment, he did not hesitate to tick the card of God of Luck and put it into the pending payment option.

After doing this, he continued to look for the God Card.

He also has three purchase rights.

Not long after, he saw another very useful **** card.

[Infinite Projection Card: Sixth-Order God Card]

[Using this card, you can project your own wooden house on all sites indefinitely, which is equivalent to duplicating a wooden house. The main cabins are upgraded, and these projection cabins are upgraded simultaneously. „Äë

[Price: 200,000 Contribution Points]

Qin Feng's eyes lit up.

This card is very useful for him!

At that time, he will move his wooden house into the zero-degree space.

Then, he used this infinite projection card to project a wooden house at each stagnation point.

This means that on every site with a title deed card, there will be his projected wooden house.

That would make it easier for him to stay there.

It is more convenient for the major clones to stay behind.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng checked it without hesitation.

Then, he continued to look for the **** card.

After a quarter of an hour, he had made his choice.

This time, he picked two super synthetic cards.

He now only has four purple diamond treasure chests in his hand.

He wants to synthesize an epic treasure chest, but he still lacks a purple diamond treasure chest

To synthesize the Purple Diamond Treasure Chest, you need five Dark Treasure Chests and a Super Synthesis Card.

There are super synthetic cards for sale in this mall, and he bought two by the way.

At this point, after all the items are selected, he presses a button to buy

Chapter 326 Above the temple, the gate of the starry sky!

When Qin Feng pressed a button to buy, the sky above the hall shook slightly, and a beam of light fell from the sky...

Immediately afterwards, a divine card slowly fell along the beam of light!

"Hey! The purchase was successful!"

"I can't see it! This guy's reputation has reached 300 points!"

Everyone was a little surprised.

Those who said that Qin Feng could not buy it before were a little embarrassed.

Some of the women in the crowd looked at Qin Feng with a brighter look.

Om~!FiNd ùíñpdùíÇtes on n(ùíê)/vùíÜlùíÉùíän(.)cùíêm

At this moment, the sky shook!

Another beam of light fell from the sky!

The second **** card falls down the beam of light...

There was an uproar!

Two **** cards!

That requires two purchase permissions!

In other words, this person's reputation has reached 400 points.

This time, the audience was shocked!

"Wow~! This person's reputation is 400 points!"

"So strong! Among our group, only two have reached 400 reputation points. This is the third one!"

This is the end, the mutation is reborn!

Om~!

The third beam of light descended from the sky, and another divine card fell.

Boom~!

Everyone was shocked!

Omg~!

This guy's reputation is actually 500 points!

First in the audience!
