Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, the sky and the earth roared over the square.

The ethereal voice of Tiandao reverberated

[Holy Land Reminder: Rest time is over! The point redemption altar is about to open! „Äë

[Holy Land Reminder: In this exchange, players can exchange the Dao Crystal fragments in their hands for points. „Äë

[A Houtian Daojing fragment can be exchanged for 3 points]

[A piece of Xiantian Daojing shard can be exchanged for 10 points]

Boom~!

As soon as this reminder came out, the players were pleasantly surprised.

The Dao Crystal fragments in the hands of many of them are not suitable for their own use.

If it can be exchanged for points, and then exchanged for the Dao crystal fragments that you need, then you will have the best of both worlds.

Qin Feng also smiled.

He has 391 Daojing fragments in his hand, and maybe he can exchange for a few Taiqing Daojing.

PS: It's the beginning of the month, and the little author is asking for the next monthly pass, thank you!

Chapter 852: Taking advantage of the fire! Pissed off the gods!

At this moment, in the square, everyone was also discussing.

"Everyone, the point exchange is finally about to begin!"

"Yeah! I don't know what treasures will be in this exchange?"

At this moment, everyone was muttering!

On the other side, everyone in Long Yuan was also discussing excitedly.

"Dad, the redemption of points is about to begin. You say, what should we redeem?-"

Di Jiang asked curiously.

The little guy is very dependent on Qin Feng.

Qin Feng smiled: "Naturally, it is to exchange resources that can improve your strength! By the way, when you exchange, see if there are any resources that will enable you to master the S-level Extreme Sun Law. If there are, you must exchange them. To-hand!"

As soon as these words fell, Feng Xi's eyes lit up, and they all showed joy.

They understand what Qin Feng means.

As long as they master the S-level Extreme Yang Law, they can refine the Nine Sun Dew and obtain the Avenue of the Sun.

There are still tens of thousands of drops of Jiuyang Shenlu in Qin Feng's hands.

Xiao Luan'er has mastered the Dao of Sun and Dao of Fen, and his strength can be compared with Di Jiang, everyone can see it.

How could Feng Xi and the others not be moved?

Of course, whether they can master the S-level Extreme Yang Law depends on their physique, not everyone can master it...

Boom~Long~Long~!

At this moment, the center of the square suddenly roared continuously, and the earth trembled slightly!

Everyone was alarmed, and they followed the sound to see that ten altars were slowly rising from the ground in the center of the square.

The ten altars are all black, with a transparent crystal ball of light at the top, emitting a soft aura.

Those are the point redemption altars!

"Come out! The altar is out!"

"Ten seats in total!"

"I'm looking forward to this exchange!"

At this moment, the atmosphere in the field became hot.

Everyone watched excitedly.

Boom~Long~Long~!

Another roar!

All ten altars rose from the ground!

Tiandao's reminder also came...

[Holy Land Reminder: The exchange altar has appeared, players can exchange immediately]

[Holy Land Reminder: After 3 minutes, open the channel for Dao Crystal Fragments to exchange points]

[Holy Land Reminder: The exchange time is three hours. After three hours, the points will be cleared]

[Holy Land Reminder: After the exchange time expires, the ultimate opportunity can be opened]

The news is out! There was an uproar!

It turned out that the exchange time was only three hours!

When the time is over, the last round of opportunities will open.

It seems that everyone has to quickly exchange the resources and hurry up to refine them, so no time can be wasted.

But there were more than 31,000 people in the audience, and there were only ten altars.

It will take a lot of time to wait for everyone to redeem!

With this thought, many people are eager to move forward and want to go forward to exchange.

However, they still resisted the urge!

Everyone looked at Qin Feng, Emperor Qing, Emperor Zi, and Emperor Jin in unison.n√äw stùíêries at nùíê/vel/b/i/n(.)coùíé

Now in the eyes of everyone, these four talents are the strongest.

They haven't moved yet, and others dare not move.

In this world where strength is respected, the strong are always in awe.

Even if this is a safe area, no one dares to offend Qin Feng and the others.

Who can guarantee that the four Qin Feng will not be encountered in the next round of opportunities?

If you are offended by this, the next round of chances will not be easy.

In the crowd, Emperor Zi and Emperor Jin saw the awe-inspiring gazes all around, and both of them showed pride.

"Let's go!"

In the next second, Emperor Zi gave an order to several quasi-god kings beside him, and walked to the first altar.

The few quasi-god kings followed closely behind.

Afterwards, Emperor Jin walked to the second altar.

There were also five quasi-god kings behind him.

Qin Feng watched all this silently.

It turned out that in this safe area, there were not only Emperor Zi and Emperor Jin, but also ten quasi-god kings who peeped into the Divine Realm.

Qin Feng silently remembered the appearance of those quasi-god kings in his heart.

At this time, Emperor Qing had already walked towards the third altar.

"Let's go too!"

Qin Feng also muttered and walked to the fourth altar.

Ran Deng and Di Jiang followed closely behind.

Seeing that the four powerhouses have all made their choices, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

Afterwards, the six powerhouses in the early stage of the God King each chose the remaining six altars.

All the players were silently divided into ten groups and lined up!

At the forefront of the major teams are naturally the main **** realm players, then the true **** realm, and finally the virtual **** realm.

Everything is arranged according to strength, which has become an unspoken rule.

No one dared to say anything about Ran Deng, Di Jiang and others following Qin Feng and standing at the front of the queue.

What's more, the previous performances of Ran Deng, Di Jiang and others were extremely good, and no one dared to underestimate them.

The actual strength of God Jiang and several people is not weak even in the main **** realm.

Soon, Qin Feng walked to the fourth altar.

He pressed the crystal ball on the altar with one hand!

Om~!

In the next second, the altar is automatically activated!

The crystal ball lights up white!

Qin Feng's mind was automatically linked to the altar, and a shopping mall interface appeared in his sea of ‚Äã‚Äãconsciousness!

As soon as his mind moved, his mind entered the mall interface...

As soon as he entered, he saw a dazzling array of resources, many of which were at the level of good fortune, more abundant than he imagined!

Qin Feng felt excited and quickly browsed...

Soon, he found an item that was useful to him...

[SSS-level talent card: law of immortality, supreme god-level]

[Using this card, the S-level blood law, the S-level life law, and the SS-level reincarnation law can be merged into the SSS-level law of immortality]

[Price]: 30 points (half price for the Lord of Destiny)

„ÄêInventory„Äë: 1 piece

Seeing this, Qin Feng smiled.

He has already mastered the laws of blood, life, and reincarnation.

In other words, as long as he gets this talent card, he can get the SSS-level law of immortality.

When he masters the law of immortality, he can refine the immortal Dao crystal, which is the innate avenue!

With this in mind, Qin Feng chose to exchange without hesitation...

„ÄêSuccessful exchange! You redeemed an SSS-level talent card, which cost 15 points]

After the exchange was completed, a white light flashed in front of Qin Feng, and a golden divine card appeared.

He happily put it away!

Having said that, this divine card originally required 30 points, but he only used 15 points to redeem it successfully.

It turns out that the treasures in this mall, the Lord of Destiny only needs half price.

He should be the only Lord of Destiny within the Holy Land.

This is simply God's favor for him!

Thinking about it, the Lord of Destiny came into being with the atmosphere, and will naturally be favored by Heaven!

Only in this way, he can exchange for more resources!

correct!

The resources in this mall should be shared by the players in the three safe zones, and he has to quickly exchange the best treasures.

If it is exchanged by others first, it will be a big loss!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng quickly flipped through the mall interface...

Generally speaking, the treasures at the bottom of the press box in the mall will appear on the last page‚Ä¶

Just when Qin Feng flipped the interface, Emperor Qing, Emperor Zi, and Emperor Jin had already flipped to the last page.
