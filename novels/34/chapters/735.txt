And the momentum of the Dijiang Spirit Egg began to soar all the way.

At the same time, Qin Feng's sea of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge also sounded the reminder of the Tao of Heaven.

[Reminder: Your pet 'Dijiang Spirit Egg' is evolving]

„ÄêSuccessful evolution! Dijiang Spirit Egg has been promoted from the 'low-grade god-rank peak' level to the "middle-grade god-rank" level]

what!

Middle Grade God Rank!

Qin Feng's eyes showed ecstasy!

Great!

Dijiang Spirit Egg was promoted to the middle grade **** rank Spirit Egg!

The middle grade **** rank corresponds to the true **** realm!

In other words, this little guy will be able to reach the level of the True God Realm when he grows up in the future.

Really divine realm!

That is the existence of the first-level star master!

It seems that the entire Blue Star Realm has not yet appeared in the True God Realm!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng was full of expectations for the birth of Di Jiang.

"Master, is this Emperor Jiang Ling Egg advanced?"

At this time, Qi Yue also saw the clue and asked with a look of surprise.

Qin Feng nodded with a smile: "That's right! It has advanced to the middle grade **** level!"

boom!

Qiyue's whole body trembled!

"My God! The middle-grade **** rank! In the future, you can easily grow to the real **** realm, which is much stronger than Xiaoju!"

Qiyue was overjoyed.

"By the way, Master, if this Emperor Jiang can be born out of the shell before the third round of hegemony, it will be of great help to your combat strength!"

Qin Feng smiled and nodded: "It's true!"

Qiyue is telling the truth!

If Di Jiang was born, it would be much easier for Qin Feng's combat power to reach 14 million stars.

Having said that, Di Jiang was able to advance smoothly because Qin Feng's bloodline talent advanced.

With higher-quality blood essence feeding, this little guy has also advanced.

hum! hum! hum!

At this time, the Dijiang Spirit Egg advanced!

It exudes a spirit of excitement and expresses joy to Qin Feng.

Qin Feng smiled and reassured him, letting the little guy fall asleep again.

In short, today is a series of happy events!

First, Jumang was born, and then Dijiang Spirit Egg advanced.

This is something that people look forward to very much!

Next, he should also deal with his own chores.

At the moment, Qin Feng ordered some trivial matters to Qiyue and left

In the next second, he appeared above the zero-degree space.

Today's zero-degree space is hundreds of miles in radius, and the scale is not small.

There is a big sun bead in the sky, emitting endless sunshine.

There is a tree of moonlight on the ground, emitting endless moonlight.

The sun and the moon blend together to make the space full of vitality!

At this moment, Qin Feng overlooked the entire space and smiled.

I saw that there were spirit flowers and spirit grass everywhere below, most of which were seventh-order and eighth-order spirit flowers, which filled the entire space, like a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãflowers!

These are the 1.6 Spirit Flowers he looted from the Bee God Space in the eighth level of the Tianwu assessment.

The sea of ‚Äã‚Äãflowers, thousands of miles in radius, was transplanted to zero-degree space, and it was indeed a little crowded.

Before, Qin Feng also extracted a large amount of spirit flower essence, but all of them reached the upper limit of essence absorption, and it is useless to extract any more.

However, if these spirit flowers are refined into medicinal pills, he will take them again.

With so many spirit flowers, he only consumed 3% before!

If the remaining 97% of the spirit flowers were all refined into medicinal pills, it would definitely help him and Long Yuan's disciples to improve their strength.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng's heart suddenly became hot!

This is what he thought of before, and it can also speed up the improvement of strength.

"Hey! By the way, there is this one"

Seeing these flowers, Qin Feng's mind flashed, and he took out a milky white elixir from the storage ring.

As soon as the elixir came out, it exuded a refreshing fragrance that filled the entire space.

[Jade Juice Pill: Low Grade God Rank]

[This elixir is made by the Queen Bee using ninth-order nectar to assist all kinds of heaven and earth treasures. „Äë

[Refining this pill can increase the upper limit of cultivation qualifications]

Seeing this, Qin Feng was overjoyed.

He almost forgot this divine pill!

This is the divine elixir he looted from the queen bee's lair.

A divine pill of a low-grade god!

This is the highest level of divine pill he has ever seen.

Before that, the highest rank of the divine pill he refined was only the demigod rank!

Now it is time to refine this divine pill and see the effect of the pill.

Divine Pill of the Low Grade God Rank!N√™ww ùíÑhapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(ùíÜ)l/bin(.)com

There must be some miracles!

Chapter five hundred and sixty-five wonders of heaven and earth! All parties are coming!

Afterwards, Qin Feng looked at the central area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe space, where there was a peculiar sapling growing, emitting twelve rays of brilliance, its whole body emerald green, and nine leaves were born.

On each leaf surface, the illusion of a world emerges, with mountains, rivers, rivers, flowers, fish, birds and beasts, revealing it.

Nine leaves, holding the nine worlds, are extraordinary!

[World tree (sapling): middle-grade **** rank, heaven and earth wonders. „Äë

[Reminder: After the World Tree matures, it can be promoted to a high-grade god-level thing. „Äë

Looking at the world tree seedling, Qin Feng smiled again.

The seedling grew a lot taller, and it was twice as tall as before.

Sanguang Shenshui is indeed a low-grade fetish, and the effect is really good!

It turned out that after Qin Feng got the World Tree seedling, he planted it in the zero-degree space and irrigated a drop of Sanguang Shenshui.

Today, the World Tree has more than doubled in size before it has completely digested the drop of divine water.

According to this efficiency, when the World Tree has absorbed three drops of Sanguang Divine Water, it will not be far from maturity.

And when the World Tree matures, it is a high-grade god-level thing.

That is of great help to Qin Feng!

However, the World Tree can only function when it matures.

Qin Feng still doesn't know what magical effect it has, so he can only look forward to it slowly.

At the moment, Qin Feng no longer thinks about it, and directly divides it into two.

The very positive body and the very negative body are themselves!

Afterwards, the two main bodies flashed white light and began to fission endlessly, each fissioning 512 fission bodies!

The total is 1024 fission variants!

Afterwards, one of the fission bodies sat cross-legged in the air, took out the jade pulp pill, swallowed it directly, and started refining with closed eyes

At the same time, the 1023 fission variants took out a pill furnace and began to concoct pills in large quantities.

Qin Feng plans to refine those spirit flowers and spirit grasses into medicinal pills in the next few days.

What kind of medicinal herbs can help him can improve his strength a lot!

At the same time, those medicinal pills can also enhance the strength of Fengxi's three daughters and Jumang.

The stronger the four of them, the greater the benefit to Qin Feng.

In addition, the extra medicinal herbs can also enhance the strength of Long Yuan's children!

With the help of those medicinal pills, it is certain that the disciples of Long Yuan will be able to complete the combination of the top grade and above.

This is in line with his ideal, that all the disciples of Long Yuan are like dragons, getting closer and closer.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng started the great cause of alchemy

Time flies!

In a blink of an eye, it was the second day.

The competition in each competition area is intensifying!

Some divisions are fighting to become a mysterious force!

In some competition areas, they are fighting for the power of Cheng Tian!

In the seventh division, as soon as he returned to the Samsara clan at the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, there was a huge movement.

Now, under the leadership of the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, the Samsara clan has attacked all the mysterious forces in the seventh division, forcing them to hand over the sacred artifacts.

Forces that do not agree will be exterminated by them! .

The process of collecting the sacred artifacts was very smooth, and it was somewhat beyond the expectations at the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty.

According to their progress, the reincarnations will soon become the second force to control the sky

Similarly, in the first competition area, Longyuan Town's harvest is also great.

At this time, five Longyuan disciples were chatting in the sky above a certain station in Longyuan Town.

Cao Yuan and Wei Tao were among them.

The two of them joined Longyuan Town at the latest, and their strength was at the bottom of Longyuan Town, so they were arranged to guard the station.

At this moment, Cao Yuan looked down at the empty station below and felt a little emotional.

"Everyone, our Longyuan Town is expanding too fast, and now there are not enough people to guard the station! Only five of us are guarding this huge station, and it feels so empty!"

Wei Tao smiled and said, "Cao Yuan, you don't have to worry about this! According to the chat channel, more than 70,000 prisoners have been captured on the front line. Elder Qishan will soon be dispatched to assist us in guarding the station!"

Cao Yuan's eyes lit up: "I caught so many! Are there any Western Baipi and Asan sticks here?"

Wei Tao shook his head: "That's not true! The captured prisoners are all children of the guardian forces, all of whom are in the human realm. There is not much benefit from killing them. It is better to capture them and help us manage this continent."

Cao Yuan nodded: "That's right! Having said that, the number of sites in our Longyuan Town has now increased to 79. There are many guardian forces that have been eliminated along the way. Why haven't we encountered challenging forces?"

"Also, if our Longyuan Town wants to be upgraded to level 10 Longyuan City, the population will not reach the standard. But for so long, we haven't met the Longbi compatriots. How can we supplement the population? Think about it, just Makes people anxious!"

Wei Tao comforted: "Don't worry! It's only the second day of the competition. With the strength and speed of those compatriots, it will take some time to come and join us."
