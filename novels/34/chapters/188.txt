"Hehe! Master, my wooden house has been upgraded two levels in a row, it is more spacious than before, and the ground 07 is enough for the two of us to rest! After the master is tired from fighting, you can come in and rest at any time!"

Qin Feng responded: "Well!"

Since the private chat permission is opened, the two can freely communicate by voice.

In this way, Qin Feng will not feel lonely in the future.

At least, Qiyue can speak with him at any time.

Qiyue: "And oh, master, I just got rewards in a row, the combat power has reached 40 stars, and the time force field has also expanded to a radius of 200 meters."

Hearing this, Qin Feng's eyes lit up with joy.

Judging from this information, the stronger Qiyue's strength is, the stronger the time force field will be.

If this development continues, will the flow rate of time increase from double to triple?

If so, the benefits are even greater.

Boom~Long~Long!

At this moment, a rumbling roar sounded above the sky.

Qin Feng looked up and saw that the sky was shaking, and a phantom of a towering and sacred temple slowly emerged.

The Temple of Vientiane appeared!

As soon as the temple appeared, the morning sun rose.

A ray of sunshine shone on the lake, and the smoke was vast and sparkling.

Boom~Long~Long…

At this time, the tremors in the air gradually subsided, and the phantom of the temple slowly solidified. Most of the temple body was hidden in the clouds and mist, which looked mysterious and solemn.

Whoa~la~la!

At this moment, another ladder that reached the sky, like huge roots, hung down from the bottom of the temple and landed on the lake, splashing waves of hundreds of feet high.

The temple finally appeared!

Qin Feng no longer hesitated, and with a bang, he released the wings of the wind and flew towards the sky.

As soon as he spread his wings, he soared into the sky, bringing with him a gust of wind.

It didn't take long for him to fly above the sky and reach the bottom of the temple.

When he was close to the temple, he discovered that the temple was extremely huge, hundreds of miles wide, and soaring into the sky.

In front of the temple, he was like a speck of dust, floating in front of the tall buildings.

At this moment, what he saw was a palace wall whose top could not be seen, and the entrance to the palace had not yet been found.

He flew up a ladder to the sky and would never get lost.

The ladder to the sky was originally designed to allow people to climb into the temple along it.

Unconsciously, Qin Feng got into a cloud and mist.

When he passed through the thick fog, and above his head, there was a howl of a monster.

Ow~!

Qin Feng couldn't help looking up, and saw a giant snake with a length of nine feet, a single horn on its head, wings on its back, and blue scales all over its body, staring at him coldly.

That strange snake's eyes were straight, his expression was gloomy, imposing, and his eyes were very bad.

Qin Feng's eye of insight scanned away.

【Ferocious Beast】: Feathered Feather Snake (Variation Level)

[Level]: Level 30

[Combat Strength Evaluation]: 100 stars

[Characteristics]: Brutal, guard.

[Talent]: The True Meaning of the Wind (C rank)

【Skill】:? ? ? ?

[Explosion rate]: 100%

what!

The explosion rate of this snake is actually 100%, which is comparable to a king-level beast.

Qin Feng was a little surprised.

At the same time, Feitian Feather Snake was also looking at Qin Feng.

There was doubt in his eyes.

A human who is only level 17 dares to enter the Temple of Vientiane?

Did he come to die?

If you want to break into the Vientiane Temple, you must have a minimum combat power of 100 stars.

Generally speaking, when a human reaches about level 30, the combat power can reach 100 stars.

If it is a human who comes to Xiaoqian World, I am afraid that only level 40 can achieve 100-star combat power.

The humans of this small world, who are only level 17, came to the Temple of Vientiane.

Does he think that anyone in this temple is qualified to enter?

It serves as the guardian spirit beast of the first palace.

Only after defeating it can the Temple Breaker be eligible to enter the First Heaven.

The loser will be knocked down a thousand feet into the sky and fall on the Tongtian Lake below.

It's life or death, it's up to fate.

It is never kind, and it is never soft!

Could it be that this human being broke in by mistake because he could fly?

Regardless of whether he made a mistake or not, as long as he dared to enter its guarding range, it would be rude.

Ow~!

Another weird howl!

Feitian Feathered Snake spread its wings and fiercely slaughtered towards Qin Feng.

Suddenly there was a great storm, and the clouds and waves were surging into the sky.

In the blink of an eye, Feather Snake rushed to the front, its **** mouth opened wide, revealing sharp fangs, about to bite off Qin Feng's head.

"court death!"

Qin Feng also pointed to a sword, and his fingertips condensed a lightsaber of ten feet, which instantly slashed towards Feather Snake.

Kacha~!

A crisp sound!

Blood shot!

With just one sword, Qin Feng split the Feitian Feather Snake in half.

Click~! Click~! Click~!

Afterwards, the body of the Feathered Feathered Serpent decomposed on its own, and in a blink of an eye it turned into a golden light that disappeared, leaving only a silver token in the field.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

[Successfully kills the level 30 flying feathered snake (mutation level), you get +22000 energy points. 】

[The first kill of level 30 flying feathered snake (mutation level) is successful, you get +3 reputation points. 】

[Killing the level 30 flying feathered snake (mutant level) successfully, the pass order (first heavy day) was released. 】

what!

Pass?

Qin Feng hurried forward and picked up the silver token.

[Passing Order (First Layer): Those who hold this order represent that they can enter the 840 First Layer after passing the assessment of guarding the spirit beasts. 】

[The Temple of Vientiane is divided into nine layers. The first layer of the temple, the first layer of heaven. 】

[The first layer of heaven: also known as the Temple of Heaven, which can accept various tasks. 】

Qin Feng was stunned.

It turns out that the Temple of Vientiane is not something you can break into at will.

It is divided into nine layers, and each layer is guarded by spirit beasts.

The higher the temple, the stronger the guarded spirit beast.

Only by passing the assessment of spirit beasts can one be qualified to enter the corresponding temple.

What Qin Feng just defeated was the guardian spirit beast of the first temple.

Now that he has obtained the token, he can enter the first temple.

"It turns out that the first temple is called Tianji Temple, where did the mission come from! I'll take the mission first!"

Thinking of this, Qin Feng continued to fly up.

Soon, he flew to the end of the ladder, and finally saw a huge square.

In the center of the square, stood a huge stone tablet with the word 'Tianji' written on it.

At the end of the square, there is an entrance to the temple.

Qin Feng flew down on the square and put away the wings of the wind.

He turned his head and looked around, the entire square was surrounded by a sea of ​​clouds, as if in a fairyland.

Looking at the distance, the sea of ​​clouds is endless and endless, and another round of red sun is suspended above the clouds, and the weather is extraordinary.

The scenery in the sky is extraordinary!

At the moment, Qin Feng stopped thinking about it and walked to the temple at the end of the square.

There is the Temple of Heaven! ...

At the same moment, a group of people also appeared by the Tongtian Lake.

Kurago and the others finally arrived

Chapter 170 Step into the secret and cheat!

At the same moment, a group of people also appeared by the Tongtian Lake.

Kurago and the others finally arrived.

At this time, they looked up at the Temple of Vientiane.

I saw clouds and mists lingering, the temple was towering, and the momentum was earth-shattering.

"Second elder, I didn't see that person around Tongtian Lake. Do you think that person went to Tongtian Temple, or didn't arrive?"

The three elders muttered.

People were also puzzled.

The second elder pondered for a while before saying: "Calculate the time, the Vientiane Temple has just arrived, a quarter of an hour at most. It will take at least an hour for that person to climb up the ladder."

"But there is no one on this ladder. It can be seen that most of the person has not arrived yet."

As soon as these words fell, everyone nodded slightly.

Climbing up the sky-high ladder to the height of ten thousand feet is the first test to enter the Temple of Vientiane.

The test of this level will consume a lot of physical strength for many people.

If there are people who are afraid of heights, it will be even worse.

When you climb to the top of the ladder, you will encounter the second test of guarding the spirit beasts.

At the moment, the third elder nodded slightly: "It makes sense! Even if that person has the strength of half a step, if he wants to climb above the clouds, it will take more than half an hour. It seems that we are early."
