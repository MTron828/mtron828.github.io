Because she has been worried about Ji Lao's safety.

But Yuankong asked her to stay, guard the base camp, and arrange other important tasks.

At this moment, footsteps sounded behind her, and an old man in gray robe came over.

"Elder Ji Ning, are you worried about the patriarch?"

The gray-robed old man asked in a low voice.

The old man's name was Yi Yun, and his strength was the same as Ji Ning's.

Ji Ning sighed: "It's an eventful season now! It's inevitable that people will be worried!~"

Yi Yun smiled slightly: "Elder Ji Ning, don't worry! This time, I went to the headquarter of the Qi clan, led by the clan chief and elder Kun, followed by more than 170 prefecture-level powerhouses. Man, that--will be on the winning side too."

"That's true!"

Jining nodded slightly.

The patriarch Yuan Kong is a peak powerhouse at the third level of the sky, and Elder Kun is a fourth-level powerhouse at the sky level.

In addition, there is another Yao Ling, who is also a heaven-level second-level powerhouse.

If these three people go, they can destroy one of the forces.

What's more, they also brought more than 170 prefecture-level powerhouses, as well as an army of 30,000 people.

Ji Ning is still very confident about the strength of Yuankong and others.

However, if the Headquarters of the Qi Clan did not meet anyone from Longyuan Town, things would change again.

"Elder Yi Yun, go and contact the Ye clan chief and the Shi clan chief, and ask them to lead the army to gather in our department. You need to arrive before dawn!"

"Old man, let's do it now!"

At the moment, Yi Yun took the lead and left.

Looking at Yi Yun's back, Ji Ning breathed a sigh of relief.

It turned out that the task that Yuan Kong had arranged for her was to integrate the army of the Night Clan and the Stone Clan.

The three clans are in the same place, and there will be new actions tomorrow.

That night clan and stone clan are the vassal forces of the Yuan clan, so they will naturally obey orders.

After Yuan Kong left, Ji Ning had the final say on the Yuan family.

After arranging the trivial matters, Ji Ning also hurried back to the inner camp to make other arrangements.

At the same time, in the Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãMyriad Tribulations, next to the Jade Broken Beach.

The Owl Clan headquarters was already in a panic.

The result of this prestige challenge was beyond their expectations.

And they also realized a serious problem.

That is, Xiao Yun must have an accident!

At this moment, the senior members of the Xiao Clan looked at Xiao Qi one by one.

"Old Eclipse, looking at this situation, the situation of the patriarch is not good!"

An elder looked worried.

Xiao Qi had a gloomy face: "Yes! The patriarch went this time to use Turgenev to find the bases of the other nine villages. With Turgenev's trust in him, the patriarch should have succeeded."

"In other words, the patriarch should find the location of Longyuan Town. Then, the patriarch lost contact, and the other eight challenge villages were also destroyed."

Speaking of which, he looked at the crowd with a deep meaning.

A middle-aged man hurriedly said: "Old Eclipse, do you mean that Longyuan Town destroyed those eight villages, and also killed our patriarch?"

Xiao Qi sighed: "Although the old man doesn't want to admit it, from various indications, that's it. Qin Feng, the mayor of Longyuan, he has the strength to kill the patriarch!"

Boom~!

As soon as these words fell, the audience was shocked!

Everyone couldn't help but look at each other on the ground.

After a while, everyone showed sadness.

They know that Eclipse's speculation is 90% correct.

That Qin Feng does have the strength to kill the patriarch!

At the moment, another old man said sadly: "Old Eclipse, looking at this situation, the patriarch is 90% poisoned by Qin Feng! If I want to see, then Qin Feng should be a heaven-level third-level powerhouse!"

Xiao Qi sighed: "Yes! In such a short period of time, the reputation can reach 806 points, and it is not surprising that he has the strength of the third level of heaven! The old man even suspects that he may have the strength of the fourth level of heaven."

As soon as these words fell, the audience was amazed.

"Yeah! Only with such strength, can he make our patriarch be murdered!"

"I didn't expect it! There will be such a powerful character in this challenge force! It's hard to imagine his talent!"

"Yeah! That Qin Feng is really terrifying! In terms of his potential, he is definitely a monstrous genius rarely seen in a thousand years!"

"Everyone, do you think Qin Feng's strength can reach the fifth level of heaven?"

As soon as these words fell, the audience shook their heads.

"Impossible! That's absolutely impossible! The fifth level of heaven! Even if we are the strongest in this area, it is only the peak of the third level of heaven. When we say that he has the fourth level of heaven, we already think highly of him. "

"That's right! As far as I can see, that Qin Feng is at most the peak of the third level of the sky. As for the possibility of the fourth level of the sky, it shouldn't be too big!"

"The old man thinks so too!"

At this moment, everyone evaluated Qin Feng's strength.

Obviously, they greatly underestimated Qin Feng's strength.

Don't talk about Qin Feng, just one of Qin Feng's avatars has reached the fifth level of heaven.

And that kind of avatar, Qin Feng has four!

What's even better is that Qin Feng's strength is still improving rapidly.

At this moment, he is refining the beast **** seal.

After he has finished refining the beast **** seal, there will be six more groups of middle-grade **** beast blood essence and one group of high-grade **** beast blood essence and blood that can be refined.

At that time, Qin Feng's strength will have another earth-shattering improvement!

For these, the people of the Owl Race are naturally not clear.

They also didn't know that the one who killed Xiaoyun was just Qin Feng's avatar.

At this moment, the sigh of owl eclipse sounded again in the field.

"Hey! Everyone, let's not discuss Qin Feng's strength now. Right now, our Xiao clan has a major crisis!"

Everyone was stunned and looked at Xiao Qi.

"Old Qi, how do you say this?"

Xiao Qi smiled bitterly: "What do you think! If the patriarch is really poisoned by Qin Feng, then Qin Feng will get the title deed card of our Xiao clan headquarters. With the title deed card, he can know the location of our Xiao clan!"

Boom~!REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

The crowd was shocked!

Everyone's face changed greatly!

Immediately, someone panicked: "Old Qi, what should we do? Qin Feng knows our location, and he will definitely bring people to attack."

Xiao Qi said helplessly: "This is inevitable! Having said that, our Xiao Clan is in the same situation as the Yuan Clan, and the location is known to Qin Feng, but we don't know the location of Longyuan Town."

"Next, they are in the dark, and we are in the light. The situation is very unfavorable for us. Therefore, if we want to solve the current crisis, we must unite all forces to eliminate Longyuan Town and Qin Feng!"

As soon as the voice fell, an old man asked, "Old Qi, how do you say this?"

Xiao Qi: "First of all, we will send someone to join the alliance with the Yuan clan. Yuan Kong must be willing! This time, the Yuan clan has suffered a blood loss on Qin Feng, and they must be eager to take revenge."

"Secondly, send people to the Hui people and ask them to send troops to help. The Hui people are our allies, and they should send troops."

"Finally, the old man will go to Xunyungang in a while, and ask Xunyun ancestors to take action. If you want to kill Qin Feng, without Xunyun ancestors, and relying on Yuankong alone, I'm afraid it won't work!"

The so-called Xunyun Patriarch is the backing of the Xiao Clan and the Huo Clan, a sea monster in the shape of a three-level peak, and has always lived in the nearby Xunyun Port.

Outsiders call him the old monster of Xunyungang.

Both the Xiao Clan and the Hui Clan called him Xunyun Patriarch.

And under the command of Ancestor Xunyun, there are also five beasts of the first level of heaven, and hundreds of thousands of little monsters, and their power should not be underestimated.

This time, in order to deal with Qin Feng, it can be said that Xiao Qi intends to invite as long as he can invite the forces.

As soon as his words fell, he was immediately echoed by the high-level officials.

"Old Qi made a good arrangement! If we Xiaozu want to get rid of hidden dangers, we must get rid of Qin Feng and Longyuan Town!"

"Yeah! Qin Feng will never die! My Xiaozu will never have a peaceful day!"

Xiao Qi hurriedly said: "Everyone, this is the end of the meeting! Everyone, hurry up and act!"

Everyone complied.

A quarter of an hour later, Xiao Qi went to Xunyun Port in person.

At the same time, two people from the clan went to the Yuan clan and the Hui clan respectively.

In fact, the Yuan clan is also contacting the night clan and the stone clan.

A five-ethnic alliance targeting Qin Feng, plus the forces of Xunyungang, is quietly taking shape

At the same time, in the Longyuan Town chat channel, everyone was still chatting excitedly.

"Brothers, the prestige challenge is over! Next, should we destroy the Xiao Clan or the Yuan Clan first. We already know the addresses of these two places!"

"Upstairs, let's wait for these things! It's already dark outside! If you want to act, it will be after dawn."

"By the way, after dawn, the ranking will be announced. I heard that there will be rewards only if you enter the top ten. I wonder if our Longyuan Town will be able to enter the top ten this time?"

"Let's see it tomorrow morning! No one knows what the point ranking rule is!"

"Everyone, don't worry about the rankings. Today, the boss made the Yuan clan so miserable! I'm afraid they will retaliate!"

"By the way, the boss also killed the elders of the Yuan clan today, I'm afraid they have already suspected it here."

"Yes! If they want to retaliate, they may act tonight!"

As soon as these words fell, Longyuan Town became a little nervous.

"Brothers, we can't relax tonight!"

"Yeah! Everyone must cheer up tonight and guard the station of the Zhizu."

"Look at the address, the Yuan clan's lair is to the west of the Qi clan. If they want to come over, they should come from the west! We must focus on defending the western area!"

At the moment, the people in Long Yuan have stepped up their vigilance at the location of the Qi clan...

At the same moment, Qin Feng's projection wooden house.

The phantom avatar has returned to the zero-dimensional space to deal with other trivial matters.

In the wooden house, only Yueling's clone was meditating with his eyes closed.

Although he was meditating with his eyes closed, his consciousness had long since been released.

The radius of more than 30 miles is under his supervision.

Even though it was already dark outside, he could still see clearly

Having said that, he already knew everything that happened in the chat channel.

When the Mirage clone is peeking at the screen, all information is shared.

Qin Feng naturally knew it.

They are all concentric

At this moment, Qin Feng is full of expectations for the ranking.

Of course, he also has some concerns.

That is, the points of Longyuan Town are only more than 29,000 points.
