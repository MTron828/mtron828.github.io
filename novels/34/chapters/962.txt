The divine light of punishment penetrated the light group!

There was a large transparent hole in the center of the light group, and there was a scream of Yan Tian Shenzun!

However, the light group still did not collapse!

In the next breath, it will wriggle and repair itself, and countless ghost mists continue to gather towards it.

The true spirit of Yan Tian Shenzun is much more powerful than the black and white gods, and he is indestructible with a single blow!

You must know that the Holy Light of Heaven's Punishment is the nemesis of all souls and spirits!

Seeing this, Qin Feng was in a hurry.

It was too late for him to send out the second divine light of punishment!

It seems that this time it will take more than 15 seconds, so I won't be able to get a super evaluation!

But this idea came to me, and the corpse was full of anger!

The corpse puppet's palm fell, just above the light group!

Kacha~!

A crisp sound!

The light group shattered instantly and turned into a sky full of starlight!

"This deity is unwilling!"

Yan Tian Shenzun's scream!

Echoing in the void!

So far, Yan Tian Shenzun has been completely destroyed!

Qin Feng looked at the corpse puppet with surprise.

This guy is getting more and more spiritual!

It actually completed the final blow at the critical moment, so that the kill time did not exceed 15 seconds.

In this way, he is expected to get a super rating.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng breathed a sigh of relief, secretly exclaiming fortunate!

Of course, whether he has received a super evaluation or not, he still has to wait for Tiandao's notice.

After all, the time he calculated was just an estimate in his heart, and it was not necessarily accurate.

At this moment, the ghost fog that filled the sky began to turn into starlight and dissipated everywhere!

Even the judge's pen was cracked inch by inch, turned into starlight, and dissipated automatically.

On the contrary, the book of life and death was still suspended in place, without any movement.

Seeing this scene, Qin Feng thought a little.

It seems that the natal artifact will disappear with the fall of the guardian demon.

Just like the mourning stick of the angel of the day, and the chain of the soul of the angel of the black day.

This is also a kind of protection of heaven for them!

After all, they are guarding here to carry out the mission of Heaven.

Even if they fall, Heavenly Dao will resurrect them and will not let them lose everything.

Just like Jin Ao's tortoise shell, Tiandao didn't let Qin Feng move it away.

However, this time the harvest is great!

Thinking of this, Qin Feng's eyes fell on the "Book of Life and Death".

That was one of the treasures he wanted!

huh~!

At this moment, where Yan Tian Shenzun fell, a dazzling golden light flew into his body...

At this moment, Qin Feng's rank and vocation have been simultaneously upgraded again.

He gained another 2 billion attribute points, and his own luck value reached 280 times!

These are huge gains!

Qin Feng showed a satisfied smile.

At this moment, the void shook, and a reminder came from Tiandao...

Hearing the prompt, Qin Feng was full of surprises!

Super rated 3.1 bonus!

Rich as always!

However, he was very curious, what kind of treasure is the spirit of creation at the peak of the high-grade god-level, and it can't be doubled!

Just then, the sky shook!

The beams of light of rewards fell one after another!

Qin Feng happily accepted the reward...

After a while, he received the reward, his own luck value reached 320 times, and the Shenwu points also reached 4255 points.

Qin Feng is extremely satisfied!

He has put away the rest of the rewards!

A white light group was left alone, suspended in front of him, exuding an extraordinary aura...

[The Qi of Creation (primary): the peak of the high-grade gods, the wonders of heaven and earth]

[Reminder: Integrating this qi into high-grade god-level treasures can make it promoted to the peak level of high-grade god-level]

The spirit of creation is amazing!F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Just a rudimentary qi of good fortune can make high-grade god-level treasures advance!

Qin Feng was amazed!

Today, the Book of the World, the Heaven-suppressing Divine Wing, and the three Spirit Eggs in his hands belong to the high-grade **** class and can be used for promotion.

Thinking of this, Qin Feng happily put away his good fortune.

correct!

The book of life and death was transformed from the pages of the past books, why did it reach the peak level of the high-grade gods?

What secrets are hidden here?

Thinking of this, Qin Feng looked at the book of life and death

Chapter 719 Nine Yin Qi! Destiny to return!

Swish~!

The next second, Qin Feng dodged and came to the "Book of Life and Death".

[Book of Life and Death: The Peak of the High-Grade Divine Rank, the Wonders of Heaven and Earth]

[Reminder: This object is transformed from the middle page of "Book of the Past"]

Life and death book!

Now it's his!

Qin Feng picked up the "Book of Life and Death" and flipped through it casually.

"Hey! This is"

As soon as he opened it, he spied some new information

[The evolution progress of "Book of Life and Death: 970/1]

[Reminder: When the Destiny Point obtained from "Book of Life and Death" reaches 1 point, you can automatically advance to the limit level of the high-grade god-level]

Seeing this, Qin Feng's eyes lit up, showing a sudden look.

No wonder the rank of "Book of Life and Death" is so high, it turned out to have absorbed enough Life Points.

His "Book of the Present World" can also be advanced by absorbing destiny.

This should be the characteristic of the Three Worlds Divine Book!

At present, the evolution progress of his "Book of the Present World" has only reached '1/1'.

As long as the "Book of the World" absorbs another 9 points of destiny, it can automatically be promoted to the peak of the high-grade **** rank.

Having said that, Qin Feng is still a little confused about how to increase the Destiny Value, and he doesn't understand it thoroughly enough.

A lot of things, he has to personally practice, to know.

In short, he can figure out why the "Book of Life and Death" is of high grade.

such a pity!

With the "Book of Life and Death" alone and without the judge's pen, it would be difficult for him to display Yan Tianshenzun's humanitarian skills.

Of course, even if he had the judge's pen, he couldn't use it.
