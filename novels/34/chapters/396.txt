噼~li~pa~la!

Kacha~! Kacha~! Kacha~!

There are thousands of mad thunder, slashing towards the beasts!

Immediately after that, countless fireballs, meteorites, wind blades, and ice arrows fell from the sky and smashed into the herd frantically.

Suddenly, in a radius of 10,000 miles, the sky and the ground are falling apart!

The doomsday natural disaster has officially arrived!

huh~! huh~! huh~!

Bang~! Bang~! Bang~!

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

Under the natural disaster, the herd of 100,000 beasts suffered a devastating blow

Terrible roars, one after another!

Every tragic death of a guardian spirit beast will turn into starlight and dissipate in the air.

And among those starlights, another white light flew out, frantically pouring into Qin Feng's body...

[Successfully kills the guardian spirit beast, you get +140,000 energy points, and you get +300 judgment points...]

[Successfully killed the guardian spirit beast, you get +110,000 energy points, and you get +270 judgment points...]

[Successfully killed the guardian spirit beast, you get +160,000 energy points, and you get +330 judgment points...]

 …

In this way, Qin Feng's energy value and judgment value skyrocketed.

A feast of harvesting energy value and judgment value began like this...

Such a large beast group of the order of 100,000 is extremely difficult to meet, and it is luck to meet...

The skyrocketing energy value and judgment value put him in a good mood...

The three emperors were a little dumbfounded when they saw this scene.

They did not expect that Qin Feng would have such a powerful group attacking skill.

Looking at the attributes of this skill, wind, fire, thunder, earth, water, etc., this is a devastating astronomical skill that requires awakening a variety of talents to master!

It is very difficult to learn!

Damn it!

They underestimate the entire human race!

This guy is not only strong, but also has a lot of talents. He is an extremely terrifying existence.

roar~! roar~! roar~!L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The three emperors roared in anger.

Prevent!

This man must be stopped!

At this rate, this human can really kill all the guardian spirit beasts in ten minutes to pass this level.

If they can't keep this level, they will also be punished by Heaven!

anger!

Shock!

tyrannical!

All kinds of complicated emotions flooded into the heart of the three emperors.

Boom~!

In the next second, it rose into the sky and slaughtered towards Qin Feng.

It wants to stop this human being and continue to slaughter its subordinates.

It should try to delay the time to more than ten minutes!

Let this human's assessment fail completely!

In the blink of an eye, the three emperors slaughtered to the front.

At this moment, Qin Feng is holding the seal in one hand, and summoning various natural disasters such as wind and thunder, meteorites, earthquakes, etc.

That momentum, like the devil is slaughtering all living beings, slaughtering the world.

In just a moment, he slaughtered 30,000.

roar~!

Right at this moment, the three emperors attacked him wildly with blood-red eyes.

With three heads and six arms, they attacked three giant claws at once, all of them imposing.

The combined strike of the three giant claws was infinitely close to the threshold of the fourth heavenly level.

Boom~!

"roll!"

Qin Feng greeted him with a punch.

In the blink of an eye, a punch meets three claws!

Bang~!

Another loud bang!

The three-phase emperor screamed 467!

Once again, it was blasted by Qin Feng with a punch and turned into starlight.

Then, a dazzling white light flew from the starlight and poured into Qin Feng's body...

[Successfully kills the three emperors (Emperor Rank) of Guan Shou, you will get +23.11 million energy points. 】

[Successfully kills the three gatekeepers (Emperor-level), you will get +400,000 Judgment Points. 】

After killing the three emperors, Qin Feng launched the "Doomsday Calamity" again, slaughtering all the beasts below...

Suddenly, strong winds, lightning, flames, meteorites, ice arrows, and magma reappeared.

In the valley, it has once again become a doomsday scene of falling apart!

huh~! huh~! huh~!

Bang~! Bang~! Bang~!

Boom~! Boom~! Boom~!

Terrible roars, one after another!

One after another, the guarding spirit beasts turned into stars in the sky

One after another, white light continued to pour into Qin Feng's body

[Successfully kills the guardian spirit beast, you get +130,000 energy points, and you get +290 judgment points...]

[Successfully kills the guardian spirit beast, you get +120,000 energy points, and you get +280 judgment points...]

[Successfully kills the guardian spirit beast, you get +170,000 energy points, and you get +340 judgment points...]

Suddenly, Qin Feng's energy value and judgment value soared upwards again...

A feast of harvest, continue to unfold

In this way, the doomsday natural disaster lasted for a full seven minutes.

Only one hundred thousand spirit beasts were beheaded and killed!

An upgraded white light also lit up on him...

[You have been promoted to a level 19 judge successfully! 】

【Your strength index increases by 40 points! 】

【Your agility index increases by 40 points! 】

【Your BMI increases by 40 points! 】

【Your energy index increases by 40 points! 】

The vocation has finally risen to level 19!

Qin Feng is in a good mood!

At this moment, Tiandao also sent a reminder.

[Successfully killed all targets, congratulations on your C-level rating. 】

[Reminder: Please rest for ten minutes. Ten minutes later, open the fifth level]

One more pass!

Qin Feng smiled.

This level of harvest was not small, it allowed him to gain a lot of energy points, and it even raised his vocation one level.

However, he also raised vigilance in his heart.

Don't look at this level is very easy, but he spent about 8 minutes.

This is a sign of crisis!

At present, each level of assessment requires that the target be cleared within ten minutes, rather than defeating the target.

In other words, even if he has the strength to kill the target, if he can't kill the target within ten minutes, he will be judged to fail...

At this thought, Qin Feng was vigilant, and he didn't dare to be careless about the next assessment...

Chapter 343 S-level light and dark reincarnation!

At this thought, Qin Feng was vigilant, and he didn't dare to be careless about the next assessment...

Having said that, his Shinra Heavenly Blade and Great Sun Spirit Orb are still charging in the zero-degree space, and it will take about half an hour to complete the charging.

Without a weapon in hand, he always felt that it was difficult to exert his strength!

Thinking of this, his mind moved, and the light and shadow flashed in his hand, and there was an extra black long knife, which was the shocking dragon blade.

That is the weapon of the phantom avatar, and I will borrow it for the time being.

Boo~!

It didn't take long for a bird to chirp in the sky!

The sky and the earth also darkened.

Qin Feng looked up quickly and saw a strange bird with a head and a fish body, and its entire body was blue.

Its wings spread far and wide, covering the sky and the ground, covering half of the sky.

The momentum of that appearance was amazing!

Qin Feng quickly probed away

[Evil Object]: Shouguan Qingkun Emperor (Imperial Level)

[Strength]: Four Heavenly Levels

[Talent]: Law of the Wind (A-level), Speed ​​Law (A-level), Space Control (A-level)

【Skill】:? ? ? ?

[Features]: Jedi guard.

"This time I was able to detect talent. Is this a hint of Heaven?"

After reading the information, Qin Feng vaguely felt a little bad.

He and Xiao Luan'er are in a fit state now, and their combat power is around 8500 stars.
