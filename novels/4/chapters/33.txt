Sweat, Strength, Success
0.00 / 0.00

To do so, leveling up was a priority. A shield of 12 wasn’t sufficient.

Taesan entered the next room.

“Krrk.”

[An orc armed with a spear has appeared.]

As if waiting, the orc immediately charged toward Taesan with its spear.

Clang!

The sword and spear collided. The strong pressure told him that the opponent’s stats were quite high.

The orcs had been enhanced once again through the trials of Balthasar.

As he passed through each room, they became stronger, and the orc right in front of him now had the power to easily handle two ordinary orcs.

Of course, it wasn’t difficult.

Taesan’s stats were at values that only players in Easy Mode would barely even reach when entering the lowest levels of the labyrinth.

For him, a difficult enemy would mean that other players couldn’t defeat them at all.

No matter how enhanced the trial was, a mere sixth monster on the path could not possibly pose a threat.

However, he was not winning easily.

The spear spun around as it tried to grab the tip of Taesan’s sword and throw it away.

The pinnacle of technique. If he tried to counter the technique with his own, there would be no chance of winning.

[You have activated Counter. You retaliate against the next attack from your opponent.]

His body moved naturally as his sword pushed the spear away and struck the orc.

“Krrk…”

The orc fell. Counter. A forced retaliation skill. If there was a chance to counter a technique, even if the body didn’t know how to respond, it would retaliate.

The problem was that the process didn’t leave any effects or memory on the body. No matter how much he used it, he couldn’t apply it without activating the skill.

“This is tough.”

Even though his stats were overwhelming against the orcs, he couldn’t win easily because of their spear technique and swordsmanship.

He didn’t know where they learned it from, but all the orcs had considerable skills.

With swordsmanship learned through training and practice, not real combat, they easily deflected Taesan’s sword.

He seemed to slowly understand the importance of systematic skills. The weapon techniques combined with real combat weren’t bad, but the limitations were evident. It would be even more pronounced here, where they were expressed in the form of skills.

So far, he had been responding with skills, but he couldn’t continue to do so forever.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I want to learn.”

But he couldn’t grasp it. He had tried mimicking the actions of the orc, but seeing as it didn’t manifest as a skill, it seemed that the skill only appeared after being taught by someone.

[......]

The ghost didn’t say anything.

Taesan headed to the next room. This time, an orc holding an axe was waiting for him.

“Krrk.”

Taesan drew his sword.

As he passed through each room, the orcs became stronger, and their skills improved, but they couldn’t stop Taesan.

His stats were still superior; even if the opponent’s techniques were superior, he could still cope.

Taesan could reach the boss’s room without much trouble.

“That was fast.”

The God of Victory had turned the maze into a straight path, so all he had to do was run. This brought up a question.

“How do I find the ‘secret rooms’?”

There was at least one secret room on each floor.

But with the maze changed like this, he didn’t know what happened to the secret rooms. The ghost seemed clueless as well.

[Ding.] [Kang Junhyuk (Solo) has invited Lee Taeyeon and Kang Taesan.]

A message came as Taesan was about to enter the boss’s room.

[Kang Taesan (Solo): What's up?] [Kang Junhyuk (Solo): Oh, you replied immediately. What were you doing?] [Kang Taesan (Solo): Was about to go fight the boss.] [Kang Junhyuk (Solo): So you're already heading to the 5th floor... you're really fast.] [Kang Taesan (Solo): So what's the matter?] [Kang Junhyuk (Solo): Well, Taeyon noona and I just cleared the 1st floor. Wanted to let you know.]

Clearing the 1st floor meant that they had finally defeated the Giant Rat. Taeyeon appeared just in time.

[Lee Taeyeon (Solo): Ah, I thought we were done for.] [Kang Junhyuk (Solo): Noona is here too. How's the 2nd floor?] [Lee Taeyeon (Solo): Why are so many monsters popping out? Is this really the 2nd floor?]

After grumbling for a bit, Taeyon noticed Taesan and greeted him.

[Lee Taeyeon (Solo): Hello, Mr. Taesan.] [Kang Taesan (Solo): So how did you do it?]

Taesan asked about how they defeated the Giant Rat.

[Lee Taeyeon (Solo): We just threw oil and Molotov cocktails. Upon closer inspection, it seemed like the boss couldn't leave the room. After holding out for a few minutes, it just died on its own?] [Kang Junhyuk (Solo): I didn't like it either, but we didn't have any other way. So we had to work hard.]

Lee Taeyeon replicated the same approach she used in the past. Throwing fire and then running away to wait. It was a safe method that ensured success without risking her life. Most crises could be resolved this way.

However, Kang Taesan didn’t proceed this way.

[Lee Taeyeon (Solo): But, maybe because it's a trick, there's no reward like the ones you mentioned, Kang Taesan. The level-up rewards were also less than expected.]

Rewards for defeating foes were given when facing them head-on. The level-up rewards were also contingent on what was done during the leveling process; if you simply set fires and ran away, no significant stats would increase.

It was a safe tactic but one that cut into future progress.

[Lee Taeyeon (Solo): But we can't help it because we have no other options. We're lucky to have defeated it at all.] [Kang Taesan (Solo): What skills did you gain?]

Kang Taesan had released information about the skills in the community. It was time to see if that effort had paid off.

[Lee Taeyeon (Solo): Hmm... For now, Breathless and Breathless Attack. Also, Pain Reduction.] [Kang Junhyeok (Solo): Me too. But how do we gain 'Unyielding Will' and 'Endurance'? No matter how I try to fight, it hurts so much that I can't concentrate.]

Kang Taesan was surprised to see Lee Taeyeon’s message.

‘She learned Breathless?’

Kang Taesan had shared about Breathless in the previous world. However, Lee Taeyeon was unable to learn it. She, who was already deep in, had refused, not wanting to take risks.

‘Is it a difference in circumstances?’

Was it the difference between the acclimatization period to the labyrinth being over versus just beginning to adapt?

That difference seemed to have made Lee Taeyeon make her decision.

[Kang Taesan (Solo): How about the others?] [Lee Taeyeon (Solo): ...... Not yet, I'm sorry.]

She seemed apologetic, but Kang Taesan, who had been expecting this, maintained a calm expression.

Whether to die or not to die.

Before standing on such a precipice, they wouldn’t understand the gravity of the situation, as Kang Junhyeok feverishly commented.

[Kang Junhyeok (Solo): Even if we tell them it's good, they refuse to learn.] [Lee Taeyeon (Solo): The Breathless Attack is really great. I never imagined that gaining freedom in my breathing would be this beneficial.] [Kang Taesan (Solo): Do you think I told you to learn it for no reason? 'Unyielding Will' and 'Endurance' are good too, but if you can't master them, it can't be helped.] [Lee Taeyeon (Solo): I felt like I was really going to die while trying... I just couldn't.]

They had finished discussing the basic skills and clearing methods. Taesan began to discuss the second floor, which they had just reached.

[Kang Taesan (Solo): You've seen the second-floor monster. How was it?] [Lee Taeyeon (Solo): ...Is this really something that can be beaten?]

Lee Taeyeon spoke as if it was absurd.

This was a natural reaction if she had seen the second floor. The Big Rat was difficult, but its damage was low, and it usually moved alone. If one was resolved to counter it, it wasn’t impossible.

However, on the second floor, there were four goblins in one room. Each one had a similar strength to Lee Taeyeon, making it incredibly hard to overcome.

[Kang Taesan (Solo): You'll have to figure out the method on your own. You should be able to think of something.] [Lee Taeyeon (Solo): ... Aren't you trusting me too much? I barely managed to get through the first floor using tricks.] [Kang Taesan (Solo): It's a simple fact. You are more than capable.]

Lee Taeyeon had cleared Solo Mode. Even if it was by trickery, her accomplishment was undeniable. After a moment of silence, Lee Taeyeon responded.

[Lee Taeyeon (Solo): Thank you.]

He then gave a rough explanation about the goblins. While he couldn’t reveal the exact answer, he could at least discuss their characteristics.

In the course of the conversation, the topic of the altar came up.

[Kang Taesan (Solo): While wandering around the second floor, you'll find an altar of Lakiratas. It'll probably give you a quest. Don't accept it.] [Lee Taeyeon (Solo): ...It seems dangerous. Okay.] [Kang Junhyeok (Solo): What does it give? I want to take it if possible.]

It was clear from the conversation that the personalities of Kang Junhyeok and Lee Taeyeon were complete opposites.

Lee Taeyeon avoided all places that seemed dangerous. She might have missed out on a lot, but that allowed her to survive.

On the other hand, Kang Junhyeok wanted to try challenging things first. Perhaps because of his young age, he had no fear.

Neither of them could be said to be better than the other. If Kang Junhyeok’s method led to survival, he could gain a lot, so it could be seen as being closer to the right answer.

However, the Altar of Lakiratas did not fall within the right answer.

[Kang Taesan (Solo): Don't do it. If it were a different deity, maybe, but not Lakiratas. If you accept it, you're 100% dead, so filter it out.]

Defeating the Lakiratas’ Servant [Fake] was impossible. Moreover, the opponent was whimsical. He judged that the losses outweighed the gains.

But Kang Junhyeok was wistful to the end.

[Kang Junhyeok (Solo): Hmm... It's tempting... So it can't be done no matter what?] [Kang Taesan (Solo): Lee Taeyeon has a problem because she has too much fear, and you have a problem because you have none. I'll give you a simple example. You couldn't get 'Endurance' because you were scared, right?] [Kang Junhyeok (Solo): Yes. How can I possibly get that?] [Kang Taesan (Solo): You could get it if you accepted, right?] [Kang Junhyeok (Solo): What does that mean... Ah.] [Kang Taesan (Solo): It's either get it or die. Choose one. If you're confident, accept the quest.] [Kang Junhyeok (Solo): ...Okay.]

Finally, he seemed a little disappointed. Taesan grimaced.

‘If I don’t firmly warn him, he’ll cause trouble.’

Having a spirit of challenge was good. But he should know his limits. If he continued like this, Kang Junhyeok had a high probability of dying.

‘I should give him some training.’

[Kang Taesan (Solo): Then struggle on your own. I'm going to clear the rest.] [Lee Taeyeon (Solo): Where are you now?] [Kang Junhyeok (Solo): He was almost at the 5th floor.] [Lee Taeyeon (Solo): ...Wow.]

Taesan closed the Community window. The ghost that was waiting patiently got up.

[Is it over now?]

“Yeah.”

Taesan entered the room. Inside, an orc was waiting for him.

[An Orc Warrior has appeared.]

Warrior. A position that only the chosen ones among the Orcs could reach, and its strength was incomparable to ordinary Orcs.

‘The boss is the same.’

Lee Taeyeon also met a Warrior on the 4th floor. However, it must be much stronger, as it was strengthened by Balthasar’s trial. As Taesan assumed a stance, something caught his eye.

“Euh…”

A woman trembling was nailed to a corner of the wall.

It was a human. Taesan’s eyes flickered. A western woman with long blue hair crouched like a squirrel and clutched her head. The golden robe she wore was striking.

[Oh my. Why is she here?]

“Do you know her?”

[I know her...but... how is she still alive? I thought she would die soon.]

A human known by the hero. Then the probability of her being an NPC was high. The problem was, why was she trembling and cowering in the boss room?

“Uh… Huh?”

The trembling woman nervously looked around, and her eyes met Taesan’s.

“…Adventurer?”

[Hello?]

“…Mr. Hero?”

She suddenly got up and ran towards him. She was holding a wooden staff in one hand.

“Please save me!”

She quickly hid behind Taesan’s back. The ghost chuckled.

[Why are you acting like this here?]

“I, I don’t know. Suddenly the labyrinth changed, and I was chased out. When I came to my senses, there was an orc right next to me. Damn it. What the hell is this?”

The woman murmured while sniffling. Taesan realized.

‘Is this the secret room’s NPC?’

She was chased out forcefully when the labyrinth changed. That seemed to be the identity of the woman.

[You have encountered a miserable person longing for magic.]
