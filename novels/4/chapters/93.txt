Colorful Balloons Take Flight

“It’s a skill only a swordsman can obtain. Whether you surpass the level of a first-rate swordsman or not is determined by the presence or absence of Aura.”

Garante began explaining.

“As you saw earlier, it’s basically a blue flame. It’s said to turn white when it reaches the extreme, but I’ve never seen it.”

“Features?”

“It has an absolute-like cutting power.”

It was able to cut through steel and split rocks. Nothing in nature could block Aura.

The only possible defenses against it were magical defenses and famous swords refined by skilled blacksmiths.

“Can it only be used with a sword?”

“It’s possible with any weapon. However, it’s not free. You can only use it with the weapon form that you have trained with for your entire life.”

Those who trained with a spear could only infuse Aura into a spear, and those who trained with a sword could only infuse Aura into a sword.

There seemed to be some restrictions.

“But… as the level increases, you can use it more freely. You can infuse Aura into a tree branch, create a sword only with Aura, attack from a distance, and use it in various ways.”

“Is it a matter of proficiency?”

Taesan asked another question after hearing the explanation.

“What about power consumption?”

“There is none.”

“None?”

“While the limit of Aura that can be expended is set, you won’t be unable to use it because you’ve been using it for a long time. You’ll just get a little tired because you have to keep using your nerves, but there’s no consumption like mana.”

“Huh.”

There was also no consumption of any particular mana or energy.

‘It seems useful.’

It was not limited to just the sword. If you increase your proficiency, you could use it as a second weapon.

Taesan then brought up the main point.

“How can I learn it?”

The technique obtained beyond the sword. Aura.

Taesan did not know about it until now. The ghost did not know either since it was a technique that did not exist in his world.

Asking the locals would be best. Garante opened his mouth.

“There’s no specific way to learn. It’s the type of power that you naturally come to understand.”

“Understanding?”

“It’s a bit different from that. In my case, two months ago, I entered an unconscious state while training, and since then, I have been able to use it. Not just me; most of those who use Aura awakened in this way.”

A skill suddenly obtained, even unknowingly, by the owner.

At Garante’s not-so-helpful answer, Taesan frowned. Garante’s face suddenly turned pale, and he spoke hurriedly.

“You never know. Those who’ve awakened to Aura, Swordmasters, might know.”

“Swordmaster?”

“We call those who have reached a level of swordsmanship to learn Aura as first-rate swordsmen. When they start learning Aura, they’re called Sword Experts. And those who surpass Experts, not only with swords but perfectly handle Aura, who has reached a higher level of realm, are called Swordmasters. They might know how to obtain Aura.”

Taesan looked down at Garante with a strange gaze.

‘He tells everything even if not asked.’

What he did was only activate his proof of existence skill. Just that made Garante change into this obedient thing.

“Are you done with your questions?”

“For now.”

“Then, please kill me.”

Taesan hesitated. Garante closed his eyes and calmly said,

“Please, no mocking. Grant me rest. Great One.”

Surprised by the attitude of wishing for death, Taesan was taken aback.

‘What?’

He had no intention of letting him live, but the total surrender was a bit disconcerting.

‘What did he feel?’

“Alright.”

Taesan thrust his sword. Relief appeared on Garante’s face.

[Your Soul Ascension is activated. The gap between your soul and the opponent is too great. You did not gain anything from the opponent.]

Soul Ascension was not activated. It was only natural since there was such a significant difference that Taesan could have killed him with the first move if he intended to.

Taesan withdrew his sword, giving the man an uncomfortable gaze.

Garante’s face was filled with serenity.

“This feels eerie.”

After dealing with Garante’s body, Taesan confirmed his proof of existence skill again while waiting for Annetsha to wake up.

[Special Permanent Skill: Self-Proof] [What you have accumulated becomes a phenomenon and circles around you.]

Taesan activated the skill. For a moment, the air seemed to be still. He felt that way, but he couldn’t know. It was a skill that didn’t give the user any sensation.

“Anything different?”

[I don't know. I'm a dead guy. I don't know about strength, but I can't discern Aura.]

“Hmm.”

Taesan knew about the Self-Proof skill. It was a skill that Lee Taeyeon always had activated.

But she stopped at the level of intimidation. While Normal Mode players followed her out of fear, there was no sense of seeing something absolutely commanding when he saw her.

“Something’s different.”

The description said that what you had accumulated became a phenomenon. There was no reason for Lee Taeyeon, who cleared up to the 100th floor, to have a weaker existence. If anything, she should be stronger.

“I’ll have to figure it out later.”

It was not urgent. Taesan turned off his skill.

Time passed.

The sun, which was high in the sky, had set unnoticed, and darkness had come.

And Annetsha woke up.

Annetsha, opening her eyes, sat up. She wobbled out of the cave.

Annetsha stared at the already darkened sky.

Usually, due to tension and fatigue, she would have only slept for an hour. However, she slept for well over ten hours.

“Are you awake?”

“…Hello.”

Taesan poked the campfire as Annetsha blankly watched him.

She was now being protected by a stranger.

It felt like a fledgling bird finding a nest. A sense of relief washed over her, and her body started to relax.

‘No.’

Annetsha abruptly shook her head.

Though Taesan was protecting her, he was still a stranger. He could leave at any moment, so she couldn’t let her guard down.

Her vacant eyes slowly found focus.

What she was thinking was clear, but Taesan didn’t point it out.

It wasn’t a wrong assumption. Once the quest was completed, he would return to the labyrinth.

Taesan brought up the main topic.

“Do you know of a safe place?”

“… There’s no such place.”

Annetsha muttered in despair - Harmon had obsessively tried to erase the evidence of the demon’s presence, so the places that were once the demon’s land had all been trampled and burned.

“Everyone’s trying to kill me.”

“Yeah. I guess they would.”

Move her to a safe place.

It was still hard to know what that meant.

Taesan got up.

“Let’s move for now. There must be a place safer than here, at least.”

Taesan went into the mountain valley with her. She led the way since he didn’t know the geography, and he made the path.

Hunters aiming for Annetsha kept appearing, and Taesan dealt with all of them.

As time went on, what became apparent was that Annetsha was still unable to let go of her faith in the gods.

She prayed to someone every night.

The recipient of her prayers was likely the Demon God.

And three days passed. Taesan swung his fist with an annoyed expression. The fleeing hunter fell right there.

“Where the hell is a safe place?”

Enemies chased them wherever they went. Though getting rid of them didn’t take much time, it was annoying to the point of death.

“I don’t have enough time to train.”

Taesan grumbled and grabbed his sword. He closed his eyes and calmed his mind quietly.

Garante said he suddenly realized the Aura during training. For now, he planned to start training with the sword from the beginning, according to that information.

The current training was the process of refining the sword that the ghost mentioned. The training method controlled the body by disciplining the mind rather than moving the body.

He recalled memories to examine his actions and correct any errors.

[The proficiency of the Storm Scar Sword has increased by 1%.]

He continued training with a small side bonus.

Three hours passed, and Taesan opened his eyes.

“It’s not working yet.”

There were no signs of learning Aura. As Taesan grumbled and got up, he felt a gaze on him.

Annetsha, sitting in front of the cave, was looking at him with sparkling eyes.

“…How long have you been watching?”

“Since two hours ago.”

“Aren’t you sleeping?”

“I’m starting to feel better.”

Annetsha smiled.

For three days, Annetsha slept almost all the time, except when they were moving, as if to release all the accumulated fatigue. Now, her face had regained its vitality.

“I didn’t have a chance to thank you because of the circumstances. Thank you very much.”

Annetsha stood up, making a gesture to hold the hem of her dress, and bowed.

“As the princess of the demons, I, Annetsha Brihite, am truly thankful. Thank you, Mr. Taesan.”

Impressed by her formal and neat manners, Taesan nodded.

“I’m getting paid, so it’s okay.”

“Still, I must express my gratitude.”

She smiled and expressed her thanks.

“Have you finished your training?”

“Yeah.”

At her blank stare, Taesan responded briefly.

He had essentially lived alone - no one had ever watched him train.

The ghost was a dead man, so that was one thing, but this kind of curious gaze was new to him, and it was a bit embarrassing.

“What kind of training are you doing? Ah, if it’s inconvenient, you don’t have to say.”

“It’s not inconvenient. I’m just trying to learn Aura.”

“Excuse me?”

Surprise spread across Annetsha’s face.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“You’re learning aura?”

In her view, Taesan was a monster. He had high-level swordsmanship, not just magic, and she naturally thought that he would have learned Aura.

“I’m from somewhere else.”

Taesan answered her question.

“Somewhere else…?”

She was about to ask with a curious face.

Taesan drew his sword, and Annetsha quickly shut her mouth.

“Did they come again?”

He felt a presence from afar and complained with a weary face.

“What on earth?”

They had been chased continuously for the past three days without a day’s break. Despite Taesan dealing with them all and moving quickly, they were steadily closing in as if they knew their location.

“Probably, a divine mandate has been issued. Harmon wants to erase us.”

“What a persistent guy.”

Taesan clicked his tongue.

“Go inside.”

“Yes.”

Annetsha hid herself inside the cave.

Soon, the presences showed themselves.

“Hmm. Is that where the princess of the demons is?”

“Yes, master.”

An old man with a long beard and wearing a robe spoke. There were many people wearing robes around him.

“Are they mages?”

Interest filled Taesan’s face.

“It would be more interesting than dealing with hunters. There’s also something to gain.”

The old man looked at Taesan and laughed heartily.

“A dog protecting the princess? You have no manners.”

Taesan had killed all who came to him.

The very first hunter he let go kept his mouth shut and returned to his hometown, so no information about him was disclosed.

However, people began to realize when the hunters didn’t return. Someone, a strong one, was protecting the princess. He was killing all the hunters.

“You seem quite useful, but you’re just a lowly swordsman. Make him kneel before the rain of magic.”

In other words, from now on, only those who could handle hunters would come.

“I am a magician of the Malbrei School of the Great Tower, Barmondor. You wretched swordsman, kneel before me.”

The old man raised his staff, and the light of magic began to gather.

“Li-”

A man in a robe who was about to cast a spell screamed in fear. Instead, a sword pierced his chest.

Barmondor gritted his teeth and shouted.

“Everyone, spread out! We will use magic in unison!”

There was no more of his initial arrogance. Only a desperate determination to somehow kill Taesan filled the air.

The magicians conjured magic with their chants.

Small arrows of fire appeared.

Frozen icicles were manifested.

Taesan slashed at the magic with a grave face. The mystic flames and cold struck his mortal flesh and disappeared.

[You have activated Frost Arrow.]

The extreme cold was drawn into the air. Nearby trees couldn’t endure the cold and died off. The breath of the magicians became visible.

The magician was appalled.

“How could he produce a Frost Orb without chanting!”

“So this thing is called a Frost Orb? Quite grandiose.”

Taesan launched the frost arrows. The magicians tried to block them with magical barriers, but they were torn apart effortlessly as if they were trying to block arrows with a thin tent.

“What the hell!”

Barmondor couldn’t believe the reality in front of him. Even he, a magician of the tower, couldn’t access the magic of such a cold intensity!

Taesan stamped his foot. His body flew into the air, and he cut down the person who was forming a chant above the trees.

“Damn!”

The old man swung his staff. Magic arrows cut through the air.

Taesan jumped into the air.

[You have activated Aerial Leap.]

He sprinted into the void. As the magical arrows fruitlessly crossed the empty space, Taesan dealt with another magician.

“Now it’s just you?”

Taesan pointed his sword at Barmondor. Barmondor stepped back with a pale face.

“I’m not going to kill you right away, so don’t worry.”

Taesan stepped on the ground. Barmondor tried to quickly recite a spell, but Taesan grabbed his head and slammed it into the ground before he could even utter the first verse.

After subduing Barmondor, Taesan growled.

“Explain magic to me.”
