Chapter 159: Thirty Fifth Level, Guides Of Sin (1)

[I enjoyed watching. Your battles.]

The woman sitting in the chair showed a smile. It was a smile like one who was happy to see the growth of their own child.

[Although I was slightly disappointed that there was nothing related to me in those battlefields I was still quite satisfied.]

Thats good to hear.

He had borne the nuisance and even went into their territory to fight.

The Demon God, smiling, looked at Taesan and tilted her head.

[You, you've changed.]

What do you mean?

[.]

She leaned forward, narrowing her eyes as she looked at Taesan.

[What's this? Where did you get such a strange thing?]

She spoke in a puzzled tone.

[There's a power directly intervening with your soul. It's dangerous but powerful. Strange. Such a thing isn't easily obtained.]

Dont you know, Demon God?

[I am certainly a great god. I know a lot and can do much. But I am not omnipotent. Even a god can't know everything.]

The Demon God grumbled. Taesan realized something from her words.

The realm of the forgotten goddess.

Even gods could not notice what happened there.

[But it's not bad. Dangerous, but... With that power, you can become stronger. And then my power will also grow.]

What does my getting stronger have to do with you becoming stronger?

Taesan was not an apostle of the Demon God. He was not one of her devout followers.

Despite no apparent connection, the Demon God spoke as if she and Taesan were related.

Instead of answering, the devil subtly changed the topic.

[I'll explain why I came here.]

Before that, about what you just said

[The reason I came here is simple.]

The Demon God cut off Taesans words.

Seeing she had no intention of explaining, Taesan also remained silent.

She then, with a playful expression, began to speak.

[You've become strong.]

Her black pupils shone.

[Too strong. Faster and stronger than I expected.]

She said this with an ambiguous expression.

[It's good, but too fast. I thought you would gain this much power only after more time had passed.]

Even Taesan himself thought his growth was faster than expected. The biggest factor was his victory over the apostle of the forgotten goddess. He gained four levels in one battle and obtained rewards through Soul Ascension as well as the rewards for defeating such a strong opponent.

[So, it seemed unfair, and I advanced it a bit.]

What do you mean?

[When you enter the 35th floor, there will be beings called the 4th Order Guides waiting for you.]

Taesan realized why she had descended.

It was a kind of balance patch. If Taesan continued to grow stronger and reached the 40th floor, he could deal with the 4th Order Guides without any problem.

So before that, she wanted him to fight the Guides at a stage where the fight could still be challenging. That was the Demon Gods judgment.

Taesan nodded his head.

Understood.

It wasnt bad news for Taesan. The sooner he faced them, the more he could gain.

Satisfied with Taesans decisive answer, she chuckled.

[Yes, become that strong. And someday, I hope you come to my side. There's someone waiting for you.]

With a laugh, the presence of the Demon God faded away.

[Then farewell. I hope to see you deeper next time.]

Until we meet again.

Taesan spoke his farewell.

The ghost, quietly observing, murmured.

[It's the first time she has shown such emotion to a human.]

Probably so.

When she first met him, the Demon God had said that she was not interested in what was not hers. She didnt place value on humans.

Thinking about it, that was quite a change.

Once the gods presence completely vanished, Taesan moved. He first found a secret room, bypassed the traps, and gathered rewards.

[Ancient King's Robe]

[Defense +40]

[A robe worn by a great king from an era now only in records. Magical treatments to protect the king are left only as remnants.]

It was a fairly useful robe.

Taesan then headed to the boss. He swung his sword at the charging knight of pitch-black.

Crunch.

The knight blocked Taesans sword but, due to the overwhelming difference in strength, was slammed to the ground. Taesan raised his sword again. The knight hurried to resist, but it was already too late.

Crunch.

Taesans sword swung several times.

[You have defeated the boss of the 34th floor. Basic reward [Ring of Hathuria] obtained.]

[You have discovered the hidden element of the 34th floor. Reward [???] obtained.]

It was a floor clearance reward he hadnt seen in a while. Taesan checked the ring.

[Ring of Hathuria]

[Health +100]

[Mana +10]

[Attack +15]

[Defense +15]

[Strength +10]

[Agility +10]

[Intelligence +10]

[A ring worn by Hathuria in their mortal days, now a vanished god. The resonance of someone who ascended to greatness remains.]

A decent ring that increased all abilities. Taesan replaced a dull-colored ring that added 20 to health.

Im finally taking off this ring.

It was a ring given by Ainzhar when they first met.

Since rings took a long time to change one by one due to the many slots, he has been using them until now.

He felt removing a gift might upset Ainzhar, but he would understand.

[??? used.]

[Belt of the Hidden Snake in the Dwelling obtained.]

[Belt of the Hidden Snake in the Dwelling]

[Defense +40]

[Agility +30]

[Made from the skin of a snake that was beaten to death while hiding in deep places. The snake will remember its own death.]

The description makes one feel uneasy.

Taesan murmured as he put on the belt. Though not exceptionally powerful, belts were hard to come by, making it a decent piece of equipment.

Alright.

Taesan relaxed his shoulders and headed towards the 35th floor.

[35th Floor Quest Started.]

[Defeat the boss of the 35th floor and pass through.]

[Reward: Helmet Filled with Madness.]

[Secret Reward: ???]

As he descended the stairs, the shopkeeper spoke to him.

There are some pests waiting outside.

Ill deal with them soon.

Good. Get rid of them quickly. Theyre annoying.

Taesan passed by the shop.

After drawing his sword, he opened the door. Over ten people were waiting for him.

The first thing he felt was pressure. Their gazes and aura bore down on Taesan.

Not bad.

At this level, adventurers from the 30th floor wouldnt even be able to resist and would kneel.

But to Taesan, they posed no threat.

As Taesan looked at them expressionlessly, the man at the front groaned.

Is the story true?

Hello?F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

[You have activated Reconnaissance.]

[Kaziat]

[Level: 84]

[Health: 6213]

[Equipped Weapon: Sword, Magic]

His level was four higher than Taesans.

However, his health was only about half of Taesans.

Move aside.

A man with a wolf-like demeanor stepped forward from behind them.

Ill go first.

Arban. Hes strong. I understand your feelings, but we must proceed as planned.

Shut up.

The man called Arban growled like a beast.

We reached the 40th floor! And now we have to join forces against an adventurer who has just arrived on the 35th floor? Dont make me laugh!

He roared, his rough voice echoing in the room.

I wont accept this!

[Arban activated the Red Mane Wolf.]

Arban immediately charged at Taesan.

Like a beast, he leaped forward on all fours, baring his teeth.

Quite fast.

Taesan moved his hand and grasped Arbans head.

He did this incredibly calmly, as if he was merely drinking water. They all thought for a moment that they had seen wrong.

Wha, what!

Arban, regaining his senses, roared and swung his claws. The air split with his fierce attack.

But Taesan, without changing his expression, blocked all the attacks.

Are you done?

Taesan swung his sword. Arbans chest was sliced.

[Arban took 1060 damage.]

What?!

The onlookers were astonished.

The damage exceeded their expectations.

Taesan didnt stop.

Seeing a good opportunity, he quickly broke Arbans arm and slammed him to the ground.

Kuh!

[Arban activated the Beast's Howl.]

An emotional roar engulfed Taesan.

Indifferently shaking it off, Taesan thrust his sword into Arbans chest.

This, this cant be

Arban died like that.

[Your level has increased.]

[Your Soul Ascension has been activated.]

Just one down.

Taesan murmured as he got up.

Kaziat was staring at Taesan, his eyes wide open.

Arban died this easily?

Arban was strong. Before entering the labyrinth, he boasted of being the most talented among the powerful Red Wolf clan, known as warriors.

Even stronger now than when he first came to the labyrinth, it was unbelievable that such an Arban died so easily.

We should stick to the plan.

You dont have the luxury to ponder so leisurely.

Taesan smiled.

If he had decided to kill them, he could have done it immediately.

He didnt because waiting for them to prepare would yield more gains.

Theyre truly weak.

They would likely be stuck on the 40th floor for decades, perhaps even a century. This was the end of those who lost their fighting instincts and tension.

Go ahead. What have you prepared?

We are strong.

Kaziat said. It wasnt a lie. They all had power that even emperors of the outside world couldnt dare confront.

But you are stronger than us. Even if we all attack together, we cant beat you.

Kuwoong!

The labyrinth trembled.

A huge magic circle was drawn on the floor of the labyrinth. Kaziats eyes glowed red.

The power from the Guides of Sin flowed out and gathered in Kaziat.

Taesan knew. This was a convergence of power.

Oh, ohh

Kaziat groaned, unable to hide his emotions.

The power of ten 4th Order Guides dwelled in him.

Hoo.

Kaziat exhaled, gathering the power. The Guides who transferred their power to him were all exhausted and collapsed.

Good.

Kaziat gripped his sword.

Die!

Kaziat charged.

His speed was incomparable to Arbans and even difficult for Taesan to follow with his eyes. Taesan quickly drew his sword.

Kagagagak!

Their blades clashed. Kaziat, who had moved behind Taesan, leaped again, aiming for Taesans back.

Tap.

Taesan quickly turned and blocked it.

Kagagak!

Kaziats and Taesans swords collided. In the clash, Taesan was the one pushed back.

Landing on the ground, Taesan recalled the power felt through the sword.

Hes strong.

[The opponent is a formidable enemy.]

You cant beat me. I have the power of them all!

Kaziat, excited, spread his arms.

Around the room, ten Guides of Sin lay collapsed.

The magic circle seemed to focus on one person, transferring all the power to him.

Simply put, Kaziats power surpassed even the forgotten apostle before activating Soul Descension.

But.

Thats all.

Then theres no problem.
