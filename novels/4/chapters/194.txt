Chapter 195: 44th Floor, God Of Despair - Aphrodia (1)

Before heading down to the 44th floor, Taesan first visited Lilis. She greeted him with warmth.

Did you come?

Ive got something to offer.

Taesan presented the artifacts he had acquired while descending the floors to the god of magic.

Would this be enough for intermediate magic?

Uh I dont think so?

How much more do I need to offer to get it?

The gap in power between intermediate and beginner magic was vast. Naturally, acquiring intermediate magic was a priority.

Lilis responded to Taesans question with an uncertain expression.

Youll have to offer very, very, very much more?

Is that so?

The required amount of offerings was so substantial that it was difficult to quantify. Given the potency of intermediate magic, this was to be expected.

Ive received permission, but I havent learned it yet. I must work hard.

She grunted in response.

Her expression was exceedingly bright, perhaps because she had much to learn.

Leaving her behind, Taesan proceeded to the 44th floor.

The monster on the 44th floor was a spirit of despair. To Taesan, it was inconsequential. As Taesan dashed through, the ghost murmured.

[At this rate, you'll finish up to the 50th floor quickly. Or maybe not? It's uncertain how it will react.]

Whats that?

The ghost had suggested that it might be possible to quickly advance through the 40s floors, but there could be obstacles.

[You'll find out soon. If my memory serves right, it should be on the 44th floor.]

Is it going to take a long time?

[Perhaps?]

Then, there was something else to do before proceeding.

Taesan opened the community.

[Kang Jun-hyeok [Solo]: Wow, really?]

[Kim Hwiyeon [Hard]: Yeah. We're a bit surprised too. We had a hunch, but never thought it'd actually happen.]

[Lee Taeyeon [Solo]: Congratulations... I guess?]

[Junggeun [Hard]: Shouldn't we? After all, it's a good thing.]

The community was alive with conversation. Taesan invited Lee Taeyeon, Kang Jun-hyeok, Kim Hwiyeon, and Junggeun among them.

[Kang Jun-hyeok [Solo]: Wow, really?]

[Lee Taeyeon [Solo]: Oh, Mr. Taesan?]

[Kang Jun-hyeok [Solo]: What brings you here?]

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: Just checking in after a long time to see how you're doing.]

It had been a while since he had contacted other players. He intended to find out how far they had progressed and what they were up to, offering advice if possible.

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: What were you talking about?]

[Kim Hwiyeon [Hard]: Well, it's something... Someone has decided to get married.]

Taesan paused.

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: Someone who was originally dating?]

[Kim Hwiyeon [Hard]: No. People who met in the labyrinth. They asked me to officiate their wedding. Really, after all that fighting. Some people are living their lives in solitude.]

Kim Hwiyeon grumbled. Taesan stroked his chin.

People are getting married already?

It wasnt that strange. They were trapped in the labyrinth and had to survive here for a long time. Since most people had died, they struggled with loneliness.

People who were lonely naturally grew fond of each other.

But it took quite a while for that to happen. Initially, everyone was focused on survival, so it was only after three or four years that people started getting married.

However, now less than half of that time has passed.

This meant that people had more leisure time compared to their previous life.

After discussing various things related to the labyrinth, Taesan asked.

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: How far have you gotten now?]

[Lee Taeyeon [Solo]: Floor 15. Junhyeok is probably the same?]

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: That's fast.]

[Kang Jun-hyeok [Solo]: It's all thanks to you, brother. The Ability Sword and black magic... it's unbelievably effective.]

The admiration was so strong that it was hard to hide even in text. Indeed, those were skills that would elicit such a reaction.

[Kang Jun-hyeok [Solo]: Before, even a single monster was a struggle, but not anymore. Mana is a bit scarce, but it's not a big problem. It's all thanks to you, brother.]

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: Good to know.]

On the 15th floor, Taesan paused to consider his next steps before writing,

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: On the 16th floor, there's a blacksmith. If you bring him the materials you've collected so far, he'll make something decent for you. So, make sure to collect them.]

[Kang Junhyeok [Solo]: There's a blacksmith?]

[Lee Taeyeon [Solo]: So that's what we're supposed to do with the materials. Got it. Thank you.]

Then, Taesan shifted the conversation to those tackling the hard mode, inquiring about their progress and any potential issues.

[Kim Hwiyeon [Hard]: We're doing fine.]

[Junggeun [Hard]: Seir's Black Wind? That's been really helpful. Thanks to it, we've been descending more comfortably than before.]

[Kim Hwiyeon [Hard]: There's been a bit of trouble with black magic... but it's nothing big. We're mostly ignoring it.]

Overall, there seemed to be no significant issues.

Having finished his check-in, Taesan closed the community window.

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: Don't die. Come down.]

Taesan resumed his descent through the labyrinth.

At the end of his journey, he discovered what the ghost had mentioned.

[You have discovered the altar of Aphrodia.]

[First discovery bonus. Mana + 50, Intelligence + 30]

The altar was of a metaphysical form, lacking a specific shape.

The power emanating from it was profound and dark, a power that tampered with emotions themselves.

Is this what you were talking about? The thing that consumes time?

[Yes.]

The ghost confirmed.

[Aphrodia. The god of despair. He delights in seeing humans in despair and overcoming it. Thus, his trials are somewhat of a perverse hobby. If you're unlucky, you'll suffer quite a bit.]

The power from the altar began to converge towards Taesan, as if inviting him.

He saw no reason to decline.

Taesan placed his hand on the altar.

[Sub-quest started]

[Aphrodia wants to test you for visiting her altar. If you accept, the trial will come to you. Overcoming it will earn you a reward.]

[Reward: Aphrodia will decide based on your performance.]

I accept.

[Sub-quest accepted.]

[Aphrodia's power manifests. As a price, the interference domain of Aphrodia decreases.]

[Aphrodia makes an appearance using the altar.]

A colossal entity descended here.

[Oh?]

The ghost was taken aback, not expecting a god to descend into the labyrinth.

Although Taesan frequently received favors from a demon god and might not find this remarkable, it was exceedingly rare for a god to directly descend into the labyrinth.

A man with black hair and a cold demeanor appeared through the space.

[Finally meeting the one who's been the talk of the town.]

Taesan bowed.

The other was a god. It would do no good for him to make the god find fault in him.

As Taesan respectfully bowed, Aphrodias expression softened slightly.

[I thought you'd be arrogant because you're favored by others, but it seems that's not the case. I like that.]

May I ask why you have descended?

Like the ghost, Taesan was puzzled. There seemed to be no reason for Aphrodia to descend.

But Aphrodias following words clarified everything.

[Many cherish you. They bestow upon you rewards that we would consider excessive.]

The battlefield of the gods.

The gods who had put Taesan through trials had awarded him.

And many gods had questioned the rewards given to Taesan.

While Taesan had achieved what could be considered significant feats, whether they warranted such rewards was debatable.

Aphrodia seemed to have descended to verify this. From Aphrodias next words, Taesan could tell his guess was spot on.

[So, I will test you. To see if their affection has blinded them, or if you truly possess such value.]

[Aphrodia proposes an enhanced trial to you.]

[Will you accept?]

Taesan nodded.

As Taesan readily accepted, the corners of Aphrodias mouth lifted slightly.

[I'm pleased.]

Power began to envelop the room. Aphrodia spoke.

[Behold your despair. And overcome it. That is my trial.]

[Aphrodia's power manifests. Aphrodia's interference domain decreases.]

Koo-goo-gung.

Power began to engulf the space.

The labyrinth crumbled, giving way to a new space.

This was not merely a transition to another world.

It was a form of materialization.

As the space assembled itself like a puzzle, Aphrodias power intensified. Confusion spread across Aphrodias face.

[Wait.]

Power erupted explosively.

The ghost gasped. In an instant, every being in the labyrinth trembled.

Aphrodia groaned.

[...This.]

[Aphrodia's power manifests.]

[Aphrodia's interference domain greatly decreases.]

Koo-woong!

The space flipped. A familiar world started to overlay the labyrinth. Amidst the disappearing world, Aphrodias laughter could be heard.

[So that's what it was. This is interesting.]

And the labyrinth vanished.

Taesan closed his eyes as the distortion of power washed over him.

What will happen now?

This wasnt a simple spatial shift. The sensation was distinctly different from anything he had experienced before.

It was at that moment, as Taesan was gathering his thoughts.

Brother?

Hearing a familiar voice, Taesans eyes widened.

A massive door appeared. Taesan stared blankly before reaching out his hand.

The sensation of the door transmitted through his hand.

Taesan looked behind him. There lay a devastated plain.

Then he looked up at the sky.

A gigantic hole was visible there.

Brother? Why arent you coming in?

The man, staring blankly at him, spoke. Taesan chuckled at him.

Junggeun?

Yes, its me. Whats the matter? You suddenly

Junggeun came down, flustered. He looked around Taesan and then asked.

What about the guy who ran away?

Taesan remembered having this conversation.

His mouth opened naturally.

Hes dead. The monsters ate all of him.

What?

Junggeun was startled. That face was also in his memory.

That guy was a Hard Mode player, and hes dead already?

Three Grade-A monsters were tearing him apart nicely.

Ah

Junggeuns expression hardened.

Taesan was equally perplexed.

Where? We need to hurry

Ive handled it, so theres no need.

Taesan walked past Junggeun.

Lets head inside for now. My head is killing me.

Ah, okay.

Junggeun closed the door behind them.

Inside, Taesan observed the building.

The half-ruined structures.

People eating potatoes with expressions that he recognized.

He chuckled to himself.

This was Seoul before he traveled back in time.

Just before its destruction.

Whats going on here?

Taesan quickly racked his brain.

Could everything up to now have been a dream? That seemed impossible. The experiences and power he had acquired were still palpable in his body.

Status window.

[Kang Taesan]

[Level: 91]

[Shield: 1899/1899]

[Health: 20920/20920]

[Mana: 2722/2722]

[Magic Energy: 376/376]

[Strength: 4693]

[Intelligence: 4124]

[Agility: 4333]

[Attack Power + 858]

[Defense + 738]

[The subject is in optimal condition.]

The status window confirmed it. He wasnt in Easy Mode; he was navigating Solo Mode.

Could this all be an illusion?

He could feel the firm ground beneath his feet, the cold touch on his cheek, and the ominous aura emanating from the sky.

Even if his senses were misleading, the aura and power were undeniable.

This was no illusion.

Junggeun, who had paused, looked at Taesan curiously.

Brother, arent you going to eat? You must be starving?

Junggeun.

Taesan looked at him for a moment before responding.

Block this.

What?

As Taesan raised his fist, Junggeun, sensing the impending force, raised his arms in shock.

Crack.

Junggeun was sent flying while attempting to block the attack.

Koo-woong!

He sprang up from where he had crashed into the trash cans.

Brother! Why would you do that all of a sudden!

No, just conducting a simple test.

Taesan shook his fist. From the brief encounter, it was clear.

Junggeun possessed the same strength Taesan remembered.

[This is... quite surprising.] Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The ghost murmured, sounding perplexed.

Taesan chuckled, while Junggeun grumbled.

A test is a test, but if I had died from Brothers attack

Mid-sentence, Junggeun realized something odd.

Huh? Brother, you didnt use a skill just now, did you? But you sent me flying?

Its a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding.

A misunderstanding?

Taesan, seeing Junggeuns confused expression, draped his arm around his shoulder.

Lets go eat something.

They made their way to the dining area, where a few people were already eating. They waved at Taesan.

Taesan, youre here?

Taesan greeted them warmly and took a seat.

Junggeun fetched some potatoes. The fluffy texture was apparent as he bit into them.

Taesan chewed on the potatoes, organizing his thoughts.

Its not an illusion.

Everything was real. The potatoes, Junggeun in front of him, and the people greeting him.

This place was truly Earth before he returned to the past.
