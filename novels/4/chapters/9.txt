[Kang Junhyeok［Solo］: Uh, brother. Are we really doing this right?］ [Kang Taesan［Solo］: High risk, high return. You understand, don't you? If the gap becomes too big, we can't catch up. Now is the perfect timing, don't you think?］ [Kang Junhyeok［Solo］: No, that's not the issue. Ah, seriously... I'm sorry, brother. I just can't do this.］ [Kang Taesan［Solo］: Do as you please. I'm not the one at a loss.］ [Lee Taejun［Solo］: Junhyeok, it's not your fault. Except for that guy, nobody could get it.］

Skills could be combined.

When certain skills and situations intersect, new skills can be formed.

Taesan, who had risen from his seat, took a deep breath.

[You have activated Breathless.]

Taesan, who had activated the skill, began to swing the rusted sword.

The ability to hold his breath for twice as long applied only when he was idle. When in action, it was a different story. The whole body demanded oxygen, and his face turned red in no time.

Yet, Taesan did not stop swinging his sword.

He delivered tens of sword strikes.

And when the sword strikes reached a hundred…

[You have attacked countless times in one breath. You obtained the Special Activation Skill [Breathless Rush Attack].] [You have acquired more than ten skills and have reached a stage where you can confidently say you have gained skills.] [You obtained the Title [Skill Player].]

“Huff!”

Taesan gasped heavily for breath.

There was a tempo to attacks, just like how he predicted the movements of Big Rat; humans, too, showed signs before they moved.

The Infinite Breath Attack was a skill that freely altered this tempo.

During a 10-second span of attacking, there was no need to breathe, thus creating room for unpredictable variables. It was a skill he frequently used until he exited the labyrinth.

“Title Window.”

[Title: Skill Player] [You have acquired 10 skills. A bonus is applied to all skill proficiency levels.]]

It was one of the fundamentally better titles one could attain. Not bad at all.

“Status Window.”

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 3] [HP: 120/120] [Mana: 12/12] [Strength: 10] [Intelligence: 12] [Agility: 21] [Attack + 1] [Defense + 2] [The target is tired.]

It was definitely fast. Lee Taeyeon said her agility was around 13 when she passed the first floor. This was a crushing pace.

Just considering agility, it was a stat that even a Hard Mode player could only achieve after reaching the 5th floor. Taesan, who was joyfully looking at his status window, stroked his chin.

“Maybe I should make one.”

He had acquired many skills by this point. Even if a Hard Mode player reached the 3rd floor, they would still be weaker than him right now on the 1st floor. Considering that one’s power increased exponentially with each floor descended, his pace was incredibly fast.

However, he didn’t have a main skill yet.

A main skill had a value beyond ten ordinary skills. A skill that could overcome any gap in stats. These kinds of skills were called main skills.

To give a simple example: Addition, which added to the current attack power.

Multiplication, which squared the current attack power.

Full Recon gave full comprehension of all hidden elements and situations around him.

Attack Nullification, which negated the result of an attack.

Forced Duel, which ensured that no one, except the target, could interfere.

And Mini Time Stop halted time around him, a skill everyone envied.

All of these were main skills. Having even one of them could grant overwhelming power compared to other players at the same level. He once had dozens of main skills.

Taesan planned to create one of them.

Before stepping outside, he drank from the fountain, relieving all his fatigue.

The acquisition conditions for most main skills were quite demanding, perhaps due to their power.

For instance, Full Recon could only be created after Insight evolved a few times.

Considering most players couldn’t even manage to evolve a skill once, these skills were practically unattainable.

However, there was one skill that could be created even on the 1st floor. Rather, it was a skill that was hard to obtain if not made at this moment.

Taesan stood still in the passage and waited.

Not long after, a squeaking sound echoed.

[A Big Rat has appeared.]

The Big Rat glared at Taesan. He took a stance and held up his shield. Instinctively, the Big Rat charged toward his exposed ankle.

[You have taken 4 damage.]

“Squeak, squeal!”

The Big Rat quickly ran away. Taesan didn’t move a muscle.

After scrutinizing him for a moment, the Big Rat charged at him again. Taesan watched it with an unperturbed gaze.

He saw everything since agility was linked to reflexes.

Not only did agility improve reflexes and speed, but it also improved his overall cognitive abilities. With an agility of 21, he could have struck the Big Rat as it came in.

However, he did not move.

[You have taken 3 damage.]

“Squeal.”

The Big Rat, assuming that Taesan couldn’t react, squealed happily. Now, it didn’t even bother to run away, instead just circling around and biting at Taesan’s feet.

The damage window kept appearing.

His health was slowly decreasing, like clothes getting wet in a drizzle of rain.

However, he did not move.

Taesan opened his status window to check his health.

[Health: 23/120]

‘I’ll have to take a few more hits.’

He did not move. The Big Rat continued to attack.

[You have taken 4 damage.]

Remaining health: 19.

[You have taken 3 damage.]

Remaining health: 16.

[You have taken 4 damage.]

Remaining health: 12.

[You have taken 3 damage.] [You are in a near-death state.]

Remaining health: 9.

[You have taken 4 damage.] [You have taken 4 damage.] [You are on the brink of death.] [Proficiency in 'Brink of Death' has increased by 3%.] [Proficiency in 'Cold Judgment' has increased by 2%.]

Only when he was one hit away from death did Taesan move. He swung his shield down.

Thud!

“Squeal!”

The Big Rat, which had been biting merrily, hastily fled. Taesan guarded himself, standing firm like a sturdy wall.

“Squeal!”

The Big Rat was unhappy that a dying man was resisting. It immediately charged again, aiming for an opening. It burrowed under the shield and bit Taesan’s ankle.

Thud!

“Squeal!”

However, the shield moved and blocked the Big Rat’s attack. The Big Rat was startled and backed off.

[You are on the brink of death.] [Proficiency in 'Brink of Death' has increased by 2%.] [Proficiency in 'Cold Judgment' has increased by 2%.] [You have perfectly blocked your opponent's attack. You have acquired the special skill 'Block' that is always activated.]

‘Block.’ A useful skill that nullified damage below a certain threshold.

However, it was not the skill he was looking for. Taesan pushed away the window and stared at the Big Rat again.

“Squeal!”

The Big Rat hesitated, then charged. It aimed for a gap in the shield.

Thud!

But the shield moved and blocked the Big Rat. The Big Rat had no choice but to retreat again.

[You are on the brink of death.] [Proficiency in 'Brink of Death' has increased by 2%.] [Proficiency in 'Cold Judgment' has increased by 2%.]

There was a skill called ‘Endurance.’

It was a skill that nullified all damage leading to death just once. It also eliminated all damage for a certain duration.

Nullification was a remarkably powerful effect.

It allowed him to disregard an unstoppable blow from an opponent and counter and even break through traps that no one could pass even after risking their lives.

Taesan also greatly benefited from this skill, which was worthy of being called a main skill.

Thud.

[You are on the brink of death.] [Proficiency in 'Brink of Death' has increased by 2%.] [Proficiency in 'Cold Judgment' has increased by 2%.]

However, no one else but Taesan has acquired it. Those curious about him asked Taesan how he learned ‘Endurance’ after clearing the labyrinth.

Taesan replied that it was not difficult.

[You are on the brink of death.] [Proficiency in 'Brink of Death' has increased by 2%.] [Proficiency in 'Cold Judgment' has increased by 1%.]

The method of acquiring skills was already determined. The easiest method was to receive it from someone else. This was the case with very basic skills like Herb Identification.

However, the only skills that could be passed on this way were basic skills. Skills useful for clearing labyrinths could not be acquired.

The second was through achievements. If you accomplished what others could not, you were given a skill fitting for that achievement.

[You are on the brink of death.] [Proficiency in 'Brink of Death' has increased by 2%.] [Proficiency in 'Cold Judgment' has increased by 2%.]

And finally, through implementation, something akin to the effect of a skill.

In a broad sense, swordsmanship and shield techniques operated through the same concept.

You gained swordsmanship because you wielded a sword, and shield techniques because you handled a shield.

You gained breathlessness by holding your breath, and a breathless attack by swinging your sword multiple times before exhaling.

So how did you gain ‘Endurance,’ which nullified an attack leading to death?

It was simple.

[You are on the brink of death.] [Proficiency in 'Brink of Death' has increased by 2%.] [Proficiency in 'Cold Judgment' has increased by 2%.]

You just needed to successively block attacks that would lead to death.

[You have blocked several attacks that could kill you. You have acquired the special always-active skill 'Endurance.']

He had acquired the skill. Taesan immediately rushed to the Big Rat. The Big Rat tried to flee in fear, but the shield pressed down on its small body.

“Squeak!”

[You have killed a Big Rat.] [Your Aura of Vitality is activated. Agility permanently increases by 1.] [You've earned a small amount of experience.] [...]

He sheathed his dripping shield and opened the skill window.

[Special Always-Active Skill: Endurance] [Proficiency: 1%] [It nullifies an attack leading to death. Afterward, it ignores all damage for 1 second.]

Taesan laughed.

Upon hearing how Taesan acquired ‘Endurance,’ Lee Taeyeon called him crazy. Junggeun had also looked at him with fear.

But Taesan was the opposite. Imagine being afraid of obtaining a skill that could save your life.

Taesan could not understand why they refused for such a reason.

Yes, a mistake could lead straight to death, but considering the rewards, it was a light gamble. The labyrinth was a place where you would get nothing if you didn’t risk your life.

Taesan simply followed this rule.

After returning to the fountain and recovering his stamina, Taesan began the verification process.

[Special Always-Active Skill: Block] [Proficiency: 1%] [It blocks damage below a certain numerical value. Currently, it can only block damage less than 1.]

‘Block’ was also a good skill that could easily stop dot damage depending on the level of proficiency.

The problem was that it was very difficult to increase its proficiency. There were no people who focused on this skill because it required a lot of time and perseverance.

Taesan did not think of improving his proficiency right away, either. He decided to postpone it.

The proficiencies of ‘Brink of Death’ and ‘Cold Judgment’ were also quite satisfying.

[Special Always-Active Skill: Cold Judgment] [Proficiency: 31%] [A steady mind. Unless something beyond human perception appears, you will not panic. It gives an appropriate correction to judgment.] [Special Always-Active Skill: Brink of Death] [Proficiency: 68%] [It can sense when death is approaching. It is activated in most crises. It also activates when significant damage is received.]

Both texts had changed. ‘Brink of Death’ was especially appealing. It meant that he could detect most traps in advance.

“Are there more skills to obtain?”

There seemed to be a few, but he couldn’t remember. It was hard to recall all of the two hundred skills he once possessed. Taesan wracked his brain.

“There were premonition skills!”

Just then, a loud voice rang out. Taesan instinctively took out his shield.

“Good reaction!”

An old man wearing gold was looking at him with a smile.

Monsters couldn’t enter the Fountain of Life.

This was an NPC.

[You have encountered a Seeker of God.]

“Hello.”

He didn’t let his guard down as he greeted him. Lee Taeyeon said that most NPCs in Solo Mode were nuts. He tried to recall whether she had mentioned anything about an elderly knight in golden armor as he started a conversation.

The knight stroked his white beard and asked,

“Are you an adventurer?”

“Adventurer?”

“That’s what they call those who strive to conquer the labyrinth. Is that correct?”

“Yes, that’s correct.”

As he was speaking, he was racking his brain.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

[There was an old knight when I was resting on the first floor at the Fountain of Life. Was he a holy knight serving a god?]

And then, what did she say?

He remembered. Taesan hurriedly lifted his shield. The holy knight was approaching. Despite the considerable distance, he arrived right in front of him in one step.

The holy knight lifted his fist with a grin.

“Try to block this.”

[Ainzhar has launched a non-lethal attack.] [Ainzhar's attack.]

His fist swooped down on Taesan.
