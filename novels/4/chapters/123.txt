Chapter 124

Taesan and Junggeun looked further into the basement. As a result, they found three more seed packets that were still in good condition.

“We’ve finished what we came for.”

Upon returning to the city hall, Taesan called out to the people.

“Among you, who has experience with farming?”

After a brief moment, a few people tentatively raised their hands. Given that there were about a hundred thousand people, the number was not small.

Most of them were from Easy or Normal Modes.

“Can you cultivate these seeds?”

The individuals who looked over the seeds finally spoke.

“It seems possible. They are old, but they have been stored well.”

“Then cultivate them.”

Upon Taesan’s words, they responded cautiously.

“If we sow them now, it will be a while before we can harvest any food.”

“And with just this amount, it won’t even be enough for a day’s meal. Farming consumes a lot of water, especially in our current situation…”

The implication was that the efficiency would be very low. Hearing the discussion, Kim Hwiyeon approached.

“Have you gotten what you wanted?”

“I was thinking of farming.”

Looking at the seed packets in Taesan’s hand, Kim Hwiyeon’s expression was as puzzled as the others.

“You’re really going to cultivate them?”

“When you acquired skills in the labyrinth, how did you obtain them?”

“When we used something similar to the effect of the skill… Ah.”

Kim Hwiyeon realized. The others, who were fidgeting with the seeds, also seemed to understand.

One obtained a skill when they could replicate its effect.

If they succeeded in cultivation, there was a good chance they could gain a related skill.

“It’s not certain, but isn’t it worth a gamble?”

“Indeed. I hadn’t thought of that.”

Kim Hwiyeon looked at Taesan with admiration.

Of course, it wasn’t something Taesan had realized on his own.

In their previous world, as now, they were concerned about food. Even if they managed to find some, without producers, they were bound to run out.

But their realization came too late. The seeds they could have collected were ruined. Due to the cracks in the sky, it didn’t even rain, causing most plants to rot.

Their range of activity became increasingly limited, which hindered exploration.

In the end, they searched every corner of Korea.

They were barely able to find potatoes that survived in the wild.

While a few seed potatoes were far from enough, they believed self-sufficiency was essential. They cultivated the potatoes and, in the process, learned about makeshift farming.

Only much later did they realize the existence of skills. They hastily looked for things they could cultivate, but it was a fruitless endeavor.

That was why Taesan was prepared in advance.

“Indeed, such a skill would be a great help… Please do your best.”

“Um, well…”

The ones who received the seeds hesitated. Kim Hwiyeon understood what they wanted to say and spoke as if it were a given.

“Of course, there will be benefits for all of you. Once they sprout, you will be rewarded for sure. Just focus on cultivation, and don’t worry.”

With smiles on their faces, they took the seeds away.

Taesan had planted several seeds in the ground.

A few hours later, the people who went out to gather food returned. Kim Hwiyeon’s face brightened when she compared the number of people who didn’t return with the amount of food gathered.

There were no casualties. Since it was their first expedition, the amount of food gathered was more than expected.

“We’ll distribute the food now!”

Although the quantity was small, food was distributed among the people. Of course, there were differences. People from Hard Mode and Solo Mode received the most, followed by those from Normal Mode, and lastly from Easy Mode.

However, there weren’t any significant complaints. Due to previous hardships in Yongin, expectations were already lowered, and the amount of food provided was enough to prevent starvation. The first distribution went smoothly.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

This routine continued: gather food and distribute it. Apart from occasionally competing against each other to maintain their strength, the week passed without incident.

And the seeds they planted were gradually sprouting.

“I thought it would be tough without sunlight, but they’re growing better than expected.”

Green sprouts were emerging from the ground. However, their expressions were somber.

“Still, they probably won’t grow enough to be edible. The environment is too harsh.”

“That doesn’t matter.”

As long as they grew to the point where they could obtain skills, it was sufficient. Taesan had confirmed this in the previous world.

Sprouts were also growing from the seeds Taesan had sown.

Then, the wave began.

［The first wave has started.］

［Rewards for returning to the labyrinth will be distributed based on performance.］

Monsters were everywhere, as far as the eye could see.

“Oh…”

“Why are there so many?”

The faces of the overwhelmed group turned pale. Kim Hwiyeon shouted with determination.

“We can survive this!”

And the battle began. About a hundred thousand people managed to wield weapons and fend off the monsters.

“Huff!”

As Lee Taeyeon was slicing through monsters, Taesan swiftly moved past her. As he passed, monsters were torn apart.

Whoosh.

With a swing of his fist, not only did he destroy the monsters, but the shockwave sent others flying. Utilizing magic and skills, Taesan defeated thousands, if not tens of thousands, of monsters.

A whole day passed, and finally, the last monster fell.

“We won!”

“We survived!”

Everyone cheered joyously. Kim Hwiyeon’s face wasn’t dark either. There were casualties, but the number was significantly low. Most of them would likely survive until the end.

Finding hope, everyone became more enthusiastic. They nurtured seeds, gathered food, and trained harder. Thanks to their efforts, they managed to fend off the second wave a week later without significant loss.

While everyone celebrated, only Taesan looked up at the sky with a mixed expression.

“What’s going on?”

It wasn’t strange that they successfully defended against the wave.

During the second return, the monsters themselves weren’t that strong. They were mostly similar to those from the first return, primarily composed of contractor-level monsters, with a few E-grade monsters.

Current Hard Mode players could easily deal with E-grades using certain attack combinations.

During the second return, the reason for the casualties was the conflict between the Modes and food scarcity, not because of the monsters. Now, with those two problems resolved, thanks to Taesan, it was normal not to have significant issues.

Yet, Taesan’s expression was uneasy.

“How strong do we need to become?”

He felt a power emanating from the rift in the sky.

That power had become about twice as strong compared to when they first returned.

“It’s dangerous.”

Taesan’s expression was grim. Initially, he thought only one monster would appear, and at a C-class level, which Taesan expected he could easily handle.

But at this rate,

“How many will die?”

Taesan looked towards the city hall.

People were celebrating their victory. Even though some were hungry due to the decreasing food supply, no one was in despair.

The players in Easy and Normal Modes were weak.

Although Taesan had said to Seo Jangsan that they were no different from Easy and Normal players, it was just a way to hurt Seo Jangsan’s pride. The difference was clear.

If there were no Hard Mode players in his previous life, the probability of surviving up to now would have been low.

The fact that Taesan was the only Easy Mode player to have survived till the end was proof enough.

Practically, death seemed inevitable for all Easy Mode players. Taesan, having seen the end, knew this.

But even if he knew, there wasn’t a solution. He had informed the community about skills in his previous life, but no one had learned.

To survive, a fundamentally different approach was needed, one that wasn’t just about skills or items.

It had been three weeks since he returned to Earth. There were a total of three waves, and they had managed to resist them all without significant losses.

Except for those who overestimated themselves or got separated from the group, everyone survived.

However, food supplies were dwindling. The time to explore and return was getting longer, and the amount of food brought back was decreasing. Even Taesan brought back a lot of food, but it was nowhere near enough for nearly a hundred thousand people.

“I’m hungry…”

Just when everyone was starving, farming finally showed results.

“Wow!”

The man who was farming corn shouted while looking at something in the air. Similarly, others were also exclaiming with surprised expressions.

Taesan also looked up.

[Special Passive Skill: Simplified Farming]

[Proficiency: 1%]

[All farming gets accelerated. It isn't affected by geothermal conditions. Plants grow better and aren't affected by sunlight. They need less water, and the chances of seeds sprouting increase.]

[You have not acquired the skill since you're outside the labyrinth. "Simplified Farming" has been sealed.]

The method to acquire Simplified Farming was after a certain time had passed since planting and the plant’s growth. On average, it was between three to four weeks.

It was time, and those who had been cultivating plants received their skills. They happily informed Kim Hwiyeon. Hearing the news, she rushed to the farming area.

“What skill did you get?”

“Just like its name.”

Taesan explained to the excited woman. Her face brightened upon hearing it.

“That’s great! We won’t have to worry about food! To what extent?”

“We’ll have to enter the labyrinth and check.”

On Earth, skills couldn’t be acquired. Even if they met the conditions, they had to return to the labyrinth to use them.

Thus, they couldn’t immediately check its effectiveness. Kim Hwiyeon was a bit disappointed but still optimistic.

“It’s still a relief. If we do well, we might not have a food problem.”

Kim Hwiyeon clenched her fist in excitement. Her biggest worry had been the food. Now that it was resolved, she couldn’t be anything but elated.

“We only have a week left! We just have to hold on till then!”

Everyone’s expressions were bright. They had resisted three waves without significant losses and now had a skill that could potentially solve their food problem.

Their faces were filled with hope.

Taesan quietly observed this scene.

Soon, only one day remained until the fourth wave began. As everyone was gearing up, Taesan looked up at the sky.

The energy emanating from the crack in the sky was even more potent than the last time he saw it.

“It’s going to be tough.”

If it became that strong, what kind of monster would appear?

He initially thought it would be just one. And at most, it would be of C-class, so he wasn’t too worried. With his current abilities, Taesan could defeat a C-class opponent.

But considering that power, the monster might not be C-class.

Maybe B-class.

Not the same monster he faced during the second return in his previous life.

“Do they want to kill us that badly?”

Taesan smirked.

The deities who had been defeated by the gods were invading Earth. They were gathering their power to kill Taesan.

“It won’t be that easy.”

Taesan gripped his sword.
