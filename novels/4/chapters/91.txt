Taesan, who was looking at the unconscious girl, realized something belatedly.

“Didn’t you say your world was destroyed by the Demon King?”

The ghost had said that their world was destroyed due to their defeat by the Demon King and that they entered the labyrinth to save their world. The ghost simply affirmed it.

[Unlike the Vekveta, we were a world fighting the demons from the start. We lost after an endless battle.]

“So, you don’t harbor any hatred for the Demon God?”

[Why should I?]

Taesan was slightly surprised by the ghost’s calm and matter-of-fact voice.

“You don’t?”

[Of course not. Why would you think we do?]

“Demons are enemies of humans, aren’t they?”

[Huh?]

The ghost seemed flustered. After a moment of thought, the ghost seemed to have realized something.

[Come to think of it, in your world, only humans exist. Hmm. I guess that perspective exists. Interesting.]

The ghost began to explain.

[It's simple. Suppose a spirit or something like that appears in your world and says that you humans exterminated us, and we want revenge. How do you think you would respond?]

“Is that how it is?”

Taesan realized what the ghost was trying to say.

“So, the demons are just a race.”

[They're just like humans. There are countless of them, with various characteristics. There are worlds where they coexist with the Demon King and others where they oppose him. We were opposing. We might be angry at the Demon King who destroyed us. Still, we don't particularly feel anything towards the Demon God or others.]

“But why the demons?”

[Because they are indeed derived from the Demon God.]

Taesan, who was having this conversation, realized something.

The demons were a race that numbered similar to humans. And they all originated from the Demon God.

“So, what level is the Demon God at?”

[I'm not sure about the individual strength, but considering the gap, they must be very strong. Once you reach that level, it's hard to properly comprehend from our standpoint.]

The feeling was that it was too strong to make an accurate estimate. Taesan understood this point.

“Is Lucifer weaker than the god named Harmon?”

[Definitely not.]

The ghost spoke in a firm tone.

[I'm hearing about this god for the first time, but you said it was a god of light born from the world, right? If it were just a simple god of light, it would have been a significant figure, but the descriptor of being 'born from the world' is attached. That means it's not that strong. It might be much stronger than us, but it does not reach the level of the Demon God.]

“So why just watch and do nothing?”

If Lucifer was so powerful, she could have crushed the enemy directly. The ghost trailed off.

[Well... I have some speculations.]

“What is it?”

[This world is Harmon's territory.]

Taesan recalled a term.

“Indigenous God?”

[Similar. A god becomes infinitely powerful in its own territory. Even if it's the Demon God, it's hard to suppress the god within its own territory. So, you can roughly guess.]

“Ah, I see.”

In the middle of their conversation, the girl moaned. She slowly opened her eyes.

“Are you awake?”

“……!”

The girl, who locked eyes with Taesan, jumped up in surprise. She groped for a sword and took a defensive stance.

“……Who are you?”

“Don’t worry, I have no interest in your bounty.”

The girl’s pupils shook. Taesan leaned against a tree.

“If I say I’m on your side, will you understand?”

The girl belatedly surveyed her surroundings. The hunters who had captured her were now lying around as corpses.

The girl looked at Taesan with confused eyes. Taesan met her gaze and organized his thoughts.

‘Well then.’

Lucifer had told Taesan not to tell this girl that he was sent on the Demon God’s command and that his purpose was to protect her. He was to hide his true identity.

Eventually, Taesan had to mask the information to convince the girl. Feeling annoyed, Taesan opened his mouth.

“Princess of the Demons. What’s your name?”

“…… It’s Annetsha. Who are you?”

“I’m Kang Taesan. In terms of roles, wouldn’t I be your escort?”

“Escort?”

Annetsha still looked confused. Taesan began to tell the story he had prepared in advance.

“A few years ago, a demon came to me. He was dying.”

If the bounty hunter’s words were true, the social system of the demons was not much different from humans. There were positions, ranks, and treasures.

And they said most of them had died. In other words, some might still be alive.

The princess had been pursued alone for eight years.

That was the part he had to aim for.

“He came to me with gold and treasures, asking me to protect you. It was a reasonable amount of jewels, so I accepted.”

Annetsha’s pupils showed mixed emotions.

She asked in a trembling voice.

“Who was… he?”

“I don’t know either. He died as soon as he gave me the job.”

At the light-hearted remark, Annetsha’s face clouded over. She must have been thinking about someone, and the thought of their death was tormenting. Taesan continued his words.

“You ran away quite well. It was hard to find you. I felt sorry for the client and even thought about giving up… but since I found you like this, I should do my job. I will protect you.”

Her eyes, filled with pain, settled down. She looked at Taesan with wavering eyes.

Reading the light within, Taesan gave a slight laugh.

“Do you think I would lie to you? For what purpose?”

The girl’s pupils shook.

The bounty hunters who had chased her were strong. They were people who could face even the top-notch swordsmen if they teamed up.

But Taesan had killed all of them. It was not clear how he had done it, but looking at the locations of the bodies, he hadn’t fought them separately.

That was, he either wielded Aura or he was a high-level magician.

And if he was at that level, he didn’t need to cling to her bounty.

“It seems like you accepted it.”

“Yes.”

Annetsha nodded her head. In an instant, her legs gave way.

“Ah……”

Fatigue overwhelmed her. She hadn’t been able to sleep even two hours this week while being chased by the hunters.

“Sleep for now. We can talk later.”

Her eyes slowly closed.

Taesan took the sleeping girl to a cave.

“Should I have brought something like a blanket or quilt?”

He didn’t expect to receive such a caring quest. He roughly prepared a place with large tree leaves and laid her down.

He looked around to make sure no one was coming, but he didn’t feel any presence.

Two hours later, Annetsha opened her eyes.

She groaned as she propped herself up. Her body still demanded sleep, but her mind was forcibly waking up.

Annetsha gave a bitter smile.

She had only been able to sleep peacefully once in eight years. Six years ago, she had fallen asleep in exhaustion and nearly became morning dew. Since then, she had only been able to doze.

She staggered outside.

Taesan, who was sitting indifferently, saw her and asked.

“Rest more. Why are you awake already?”

Annetsha looked blankly at Taesan.

‘It… wasn’t a dream.’

The mercenary that was left for her by her dead kin.

‘Can… Can I rely on him?’

A sudden thought made her shake her head hastily.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

‘No.’

“Go away.”

Annetsha spoke coldly.

“You shouldn’t be around me.”

She closed her eyes tightly.

She still remembered. Her joyful eighth birthday party. Even in a difficult situation where they couldn’t reach the gods, everyone gathered to celebrate, and the Demon King also showed himself in person.

Numerous smiles and feelings of affection towards her.

All of that became distorted.

The ones who were laughing as the castle was being bombarded got smashed and disappeared. The vibrant and joyful party turned into a bloodbath in an instant due to the invading knights.

So many sacrificed their lives with a smile to help her escape.

She didn’t want to witness such a scene again.

Dying would have been enough if it were just her.

“Sorry, but I can’t do that.”

Taesan spoke as he poked at the campfire.

“The reason I came here is for you.”

“It’s dangerous around me. I know you’re strong, but you will die.”

She opened her mouth with a miserable face.

Taesan chuckled.

“Dangerous?”

“It’s not only the bounty hunters chasing me. Those who have made a name for themselves are also after me.”

Taesan clicked his tongue.

“Like that guy?”

“What?”

Annetsha reflexively looked in the direction Taesan was indicating. There was nothing there.

As she was about to ask what he meant, the bushes parted.

“Ah, Princess. You were here.”

A middle-aged man with a rat-like beard revealed himself with a groan. Annetsha was startled and grabbed her sword.

“Garante…”

“It is an honor to know that the noble princess knows my name.”

Garante eye’s shone as he made a sarcastic remark.

“I heard you were around here, but I didn’t think it would be true…”

Garante, who took a quick look at Annetsha, wore a sardonic smile.

“It’s not like the beautiful princess. Do you want to survive so desperately?”

“You swore allegiance to our father once…”

Annetsha gritted her teeth. When humans and demons lived in peace, Garante had sworn allegiance to the demon king and lived as his knight.

However, as soon as the Demon King disappeared and chaos ensued, Garante quickly hid himself. He was able to escape without any problem, as it was not a time when they could afford to chase a single knight.

“That’s all in the past. Thinking about it now, it was a terrible experience. Swearing allegiance to the likes of demons! I wish I could erase that memory. Really.”

Garante grimaced.

He had run away when chaos ensued due to the silence of the Demon King. He thought he had made a good escape, but those in power knew all about his allegiance to the Demon King. At that time, he was not in a proper position to do anything about it.

“So you should just surrender quietly, Princess.”

But that was all over now. If he captured the last remaining princess of the demons, if he took her with him, they would treat him properly.

Annetsha bit her lip at the sight of Garante’s greed.

Ability and character were not proportional. Garante was a subject worthy of criticism but also a powerful being.

He could use Aura and was a top-class swordsman, surpassing the average. There weren’t many who could claim to have an advantage over him.

Annetsha had never heard the name Taesan. He was strong, but not to the level she had heard.

“…Run away.”

She blocked Taesan’s path. Garante, who had noticed Taesan late, raised the corner of his mouth.

“It seems there are still people who worship her, even though her bloodline is all dead.”

Garante, mistaking Taesan for Annetsha’s escort, who had been following her, made up his mind. He decided to kill Taesan first. Then, he thought, Annetsha, whose will would be broken, would easily submit to him.

As soon as he made the decision, Garante moved. He rushed at a fast pace.

Annetsha quickly moved her sword, but Garante easily dodged it and stabbed his sword toward Taesan.

Clang!

The sound of swords clashing, not the feeling of pierced flesh, resonated. Garante’s pupils dilated.

Taesan calmly moved his fist.

Thump!

“Ugh!”

Garante hastily retreated. Taesan looked amused.

“Not dead?”

Not only that, but he was not seriously injured either.

“Not bad.”

He had shown the entire process of clenching his fist, raising his arm, and moving, but it was still a good move.

Garante rubbed his cold cheek.

It was fast. If he hadn’t reacted reflexively, his face would have flown off. There was that much power in Taesan’s fist.

Garante’s face twisted.

“How dare an unknown ruffian!”

A blue light shone on Garante’s sword. Annetsha was horrified.

Aura Blade.

Despair fell on Annetsha’s face. The moment you learned to control Aura, you possessed a power that diverged from the common swordsman.

A light flashed across Taesan’s face.

“What is that?”

It wasn’t a look of despair but of interest.
