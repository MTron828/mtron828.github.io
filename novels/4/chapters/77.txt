Aldoata fell. He desperately tried to regain his senses, resisting and struggling, but ultimately was trampled by Taesan. Aldoata cried out with a face twisted in fear.

“Wait…”

“I don’t want to hear it.”

A sword pierced through Aldoata’s chest. Blood spilled from his mouth, and life faded from his eyes.

[Your Soul Ascension has been activated. Your Strength permanently increases by 20. Your Agility permanently increases by 18. Your Intelligence permanently increases by 13. Your Vitality permanently increases by 70. Your Mana permanently increases by 20.] [Your Soul Ascension has been activated. You have acquired the basic transformation skill [Werewolf].] [Your level has increased.]

“Phew.”

Taesan whistled. It was indeed a significant increase.

“Is it more profitable to hunt adventurers than monsters?”

[That's because what you have is outrageous.]

Soul Ascension was a skill that plundered strength. It stole all that the opponent had accumulated. Perhaps that was why it was more profitable to defeat adventurers than monsters.

Furthermore, his level had also increased. This was a great value considering that clearing one floor usually increased his level by one or two.

The ghost muttered in a doubtful tone.

[The skills you've gained overall are outrageous... But what is this Soul Ascension? Is that a skill one can acquire?]

After witnessing the nullification of attack and endurance, the ghost was taken aback but had doubts about Soul Ascension. Soul Ascension was an utterly preposterous skill.

Soul Ascension’s effects granted not only stats but also skills.

[Basic Transfer Skill: Werewolf] [Mana Consumption: 10] [Proficiency: 0%] [You transform into a werewolf. You cannot transform yet due to a lack of special blood.]

“What kind of skill is this?”

[You saw it earlier, right? It allows you to transform into a werewolf. It's a skill with both advantages and disadvantages, but you can't use it now, can you?]

“It seems so.”

There was a description saying he lacked special blood. He attempted to use it as a test, but it didn’t activate, as if it was blocked.

[You need the blood of a noble lineage for the transformation skill. You can't get it now. Go down a bit, and you'll be able to use it.]

“What a waste.”

He was curious about what effects this new skill could bring. It might allow him to gain other skills as well.

Licking his lips, Taesan began to check the rewards from the 13th floor that he hadn’t had time to inspect as Aldoata had appeared.

A sharp, small blade was on the outside of a ring, so it could be used as a sort of gauntlet.

[Ring of Severance] [Attack +5] [The artisan believed that wearing ten of these rings would produce the same effect as a gauntlet. But it would be better to wear a gauntlet instead.]

As the description indicated, it was improperly made equipment, but it was the perfect equipment for Taesan, who possessed the Airak Martial Arts.

He wore the ring on each of his ten fingers, removing the old ring, which had an attack power of 1.

And then the secret reward.

[You have used ???] [You have obtained one Blessing Powder.]

“Oh?”

Blessing Powder. An item that made uncertain probabilities certain.

It was worth far more than mediocre equipment. Taesan happily stowed it in his inventory.

Now, towards the 14th floor.

This time he wouldn’t go to Lilis. The zombie room didn’t provide much except for basic materials.

[Starting the 14th-floor quest.] [Defeat the 14th-floor boss and pass through.] [Reward: Anklet of the Valley.] [Secret Reward: ???]

“Hello there.”

He greeted the dwarf waiting at the entrance of the floor as usual. The dwarf looked at him and opened his mouth.

“Did you meet them?”

“Yes.”

“How did it go?”

“I took care of it.”

At the dispassionate answer, the dwarf smiled.

“You did well. They were useless, so it’s good they’re dead.”

“I will handle things on my own.”

Taesan responded bluntly and asked a question.

“Are you still contemplating?”

At the implied question that was essentially a request for a kind of quest to substitute for the penalty play, the dwarf stroked his beard.

“I’m considering one thing… but I’m still adjusting it. I will propose it around the next floor.”

“I see.”

In that case, he should clear the floor quickly and come back. Taesan descended to the 14th floor.

The young man spoke first.

“Is he dead?”

“Huh?”

The adventurers from the second rank who were leisurely waiting were startled.

“Who died?”

“Is it about Aldoata? The light went out?”

The young man in charge of managing the second rank had a gem that allowed him to confirm the survival of each adventurer.

The young man looked at the gem with shaky eyes. The brilliantly burning light had completely vanished, transforming the gem into something like a plain pebble.

“He must have let his guard down.”

They all agreed with those words. The young man mumbled with a strange expression.

“…Do you really think so?”

“Isn’t it too quick? That blockhead must’ve died without even transforming.”

If Aldoata didn’t transform into a werewolf, he would be one of the weakest among them. They thought he must have let his guard down and fought without transforming on the 13th floor.

The speed at which the light went out in the gem also reinforced this idea. In a normal battle, even they could not win so quickly, so they could only think that the incredibly arrogant Aldoata had let his guard down.

“Alright! Then I’m next!”

The man who had drawn a number one less than Aldoata clenched his fist. He, who was dressed grandiosely in a black robe, started to prepare with a sly smile.

“Tch. Seems it won’t come to me.”

“He’s going to die this time.”

Everyone who knew the power of the man in the robe tucked away their expectations and muttered discontentedly. The young man cautiously spoke.

“Don’t let your guard down. It’s the guy who defeated Levabas and Aldoata.”

“Do you remember who I am?”

The man laughed as he fluttered his robe.

“I am one who walks the path of magic. There’s no such thing as complacency for me.”

“Are you the arrogant fool who killed Aldoata and Levebas?”

The man in the robe spoke first. Taesan didn’t answer and simply drove his foot forward.

[Kang Taesan activated Acceleration.] [54 damage to Jusepi.]

“Kheuk!”

In an instant, Jusepi, with his chest pierced, vomited blood. Hastily backing away, he opened his mouth as if he couldn’t believe what just happened.

“Crazy…to attack out of the blue…”

“Why should there be a conversation?”

After all, it was kill or be killed.

“Eek!”

With the sudden onslaught of attacks, Jusepi ground his teeth and pulled out a staff.

[Jusepi activated Confusion.] [No judgment necessary! Kang Taesan repelled it with his unyielding willpower.]

“What, what…”

Thunk.

As Taesan thrust his sword in, he thought.

‘So, a mage this time.’

A robe and a staff. They were unmistakably a magician’s gear.

When Taesan resisted the confusion without any resistance, the greatly unsettled Jusepi took the hit.

To Taesan, this was a fortunate event, so he continued to thrust his sword while swatting away the staff.

Jusepi, who came to his senses belatedly, clenched his teeth.

“Yikes!”

[Jusepi activated Magic Shield.]

A white curtain enveloped Jusepi. When it collided with Taesan’s sword, a strong repulsion effect occurred.

“Oh?”

It was a form of magic he had not seen before. Interest sparked for the first time on Taesan’s face.

‘Is there some advantage to using this in creating an opening?’

The moment they engaged, he could have kept up the attack until the end, never letting go until the death of his opponent. However, he had purposely created an opening to gain what he could.

With a rigid face, Jusepi roughly shook his staff.

[Jusepi activated Madness.] [No judgment necessary! Kang Taesan repelled it with his unyielding willpower.]

“This is crazy.”

Jusepi ground his teeth. What was that? Repelling mental attacks with just willpower was something unheard of.

‘It wasn’t just luck that won the day.’

Jusepi stared at Taesan with serious eyes. It was plausible for Levabas and Aldoata to lose. Though he, being a mage, had a low defense, receiving 50 points of damage was no joke. He was not an opponent to be underestimated.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

[Jusepi activated Ice Pellet Dispersion.]

Crrrk, crkkk!

The ice pellets scattered with a harsh bouncing sound. The magic that was intended to restrict movement was obvious.

[Jusepi activated Frost Arrow.] [Kang Taesan activated Frost Arrow.]

“What?”

Jusepi, who had been confident that he wouldn’t be unsettled, raised his voice. Two frozen arrows collided, and the one that shattered was Jusepi’s.

Taesan’s arrow collided with Jusepi’s magic shield and exploded.

“What is this!”

Magic! Not even basic magic, but elementary-level magic called Frost Arrow!

And his magic was defeated. This meant that his opponent had higher proficiency.

‘Impossible!’

Who did he think he was? Recognized for his talent even in the high magic tower, he had heard that he was a genius who only came once in ten years.

He had only been granted access to the second tier here, but that was because the god of magic had not descended upon him, not because he lacked talent.

Contrary to his expectations, the talent Jusepi was credited with by the magic tower was accurately assigned to the second tier. Although such talent was not particularly impressive in this place, Jusepi was unaware of it.

But this kid in front of him, this child who had not been in the labyrinth for long, had a higher proficiency than him? He had a talent for magic?

‘It can’t be!’

Jusepi distorted his face in staunch denial.

In reality, Taesan had raised his proficiency using points, but Jusepi, unaware of this, experienced a shattering of his world.

[Jusepi activated Thunderbolt.]

Boom!

Lightning struck Taesan. He was unable to avoid it due to its speed of light and got hit directly.

‘Yes!’

Jusepi smirked. A real wizard would be able to react in advance upon seeing the manifestation of magic, but Taesan did not.

He thought that Taesan’s magic had won merely by chance.

[Kang Taesan's First Attack Nullification activated.] [Kang Taesan receives 0 damage.]

“What?”

Jusepi blurted this out without realizing it as confusion filled his eyes.

“…Attack Nullification?”

“Is there such magic? Fascinating.”

Instantaneous magic. Unlike Frost Arrow or Thermal Orb, it couldn’t be avoided. Taesan grinned and held his sword.

“Let’s continue.”

Jusepi engaged in the battle desperately. Barely holding onto his waning spirit, he manifested his magic.

At first, Taesan was on the losing end of the battle. Jusepi’s magic was diverse and effective, considering he had used magic all his life. It was difficult to counter for Taesan, who was facing magic for the first time.

However, Taesan had his stats, experience, and skills. As the battle continued, he learned one by one how to respond to magic and fought back.

Finally, Taesan’s sword shattered the magical shield.

“Thank you.”

Thanks to this, he learned a bit more about how to use magic. Jusepi let out a hollow laugh.

“Nonsense……”

His sword pierced Jusepi.

“He’s dead?”

“Huh?”

“Again?”

Everyone on the second tier was taken aback. Aldoata and Jusepi’s defeat felt different.

Jusepi was a master of magic. They all thought he would naturally win and return due to his diverse magic, which even they couldn’t easily respond to.

“…Did he let his guard down?”

“If he couldn’t use magic properly, it’s possible. After all, there are ghosts, too, right? If they helped from the side, it wouldn’t be impossible.”

But they still didn’t take the matter seriously. The 13th and 20th floors had a significant gap.

“I’m next!”

The boy, who still looked young, clenched his fist. This time, a serious expression crossed everyone’s face.

“I’ll be back!”

The boy left with a smile.

An hour later, the young man said,

“He’s dead?”

They were shaken. The middle-aged man who was next laughed and gripped his sword.

“I didn’t think he’d reach me. I’ll dispose of him quickly.”

The middle-aged man left. He had conquered the mercenary world with just one sword, and his experience was more than anyone else’s here. Everyone thought he would win.

Forty minutes later, the young man spoke again.

“…Again.”

“Wha…?”

They were taken aback. The woman who was next in line hesitated and waved her hand.

“… I’ll be back?”

And thirty minutes later, the young man twisted his face.

Although he said nothing, they all realized what had happened.

“…Next is me. Do I really have to go alone?”

“…Maybe?”

“Right. It’s only on the 13th floor. It’s weird to get serious. Let’s go together.”

Despite their casual words, their eyes were filled with agitation and fear.

In the end, they decided to ascend together as a group of five.

As they departed, their faces bore a mix of anxiety and confidence.

Everyone thought it was over now. There were five of them.

Five 20th floor adventurers. They couldn’t possibly lose.

Two hours later.

The young man said,

“… They’re all dead.”

The gems lost their light. A deafening silence loomed over them.

Quiet filled the room.
