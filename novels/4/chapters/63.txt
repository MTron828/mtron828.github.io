The usage of points was explained through gold, stats, and skill proficiency.

The ratio was as follows:

[Gold can be converted at a 1:10 ratio.] [Stats can be converted at a 5:1 ratio.] [Skill proficiency can be converted at a 10:1 ratio.]

The first number he paid attention to was points. He currently had 482p. When converted to gold, it amounted to 4,820 gold. When converted to stats, it amounted to 96 stats. Skill proficiency amounted to 48%.

The 10:1 ratio seemed high, but considering the value of proficiency in this place, it was worth the exchange. He could definitely become stronger due to this return.

The first priority was gold. The ratio was the best. You could get 10 gold for 1 point, so it was arguably the most profitable.

However, Taesan had no intention of converting his points into gold.

Gold was an important currency here, but he could get it anytime. Compared to stats and proficiency, its value was much lower.

Stats were the most basic figure here and could be considered even more important than proficiency. Though that was not the case for Taesan.

For Lee Taeyeon or Kang Junhyeok, choosing stats would be the correct answer. Both probably obtained more than 50 points, so they could increase their stats by 10 across the board. Considering their current stats were around 15, they could become stronger in an instant.

However, Taesan’s current stats were already too high.

If he combined all his current stats, it would be 819.

Even if he spent all his points, it would only amount to a mere 10% increase.

Of course, it was a significant figure. Still, considering how difficult it was to acquire points, it felt wasteful to convert them to that.

However, proficiency was different.

It was a figure that could only be accumulated through time, experience, and effort.

It was practically impossible to find opportunities to increase it like this.

There was a reason why he was surprised at the proficiency potion that could increase proficiency by 5%.

“Well then.”

Taesan opened the skill window for the first time in a while. There were several skills with updated content due to increased proficiency.

[Special Constant Activation Skill: Vision Enhancement] [Proficiency: 62%] [Allows for a broader field of view. Significantly surpasses human standards.]

Vision Enhancement had surpassed 60%. It could now be compared to the compound eyes of an insect.

[Special Constant Activation Skill: Composure] [Proficiency: 83%] [Unshakeable mentality. Even in the face of transcendent beings, no panic ensues. Acquires corrections to judgment. Never wavers, even in extreme situations. The spirit of this existence is indomitable.]

The phrase ‘The spirit of this existence is indomitable’ was added. It was nothing special for Taesan, who had never failed a mental judgment.

[Special Constant Activation Skill: Death Line] [Proficiency: 84%] [Can sense the moment of death. Activates in most crises. Also possesses a form of premonition.]

Just like Intuition, premonition was added to Death Line. Premonition was always beneficial in any skill. It was like a semi-future prediction skill with no downside.

[Special Constant Activation Skill: Sensory Enhancement] [Proficiency: 40%] [Enhances senses. Can sense vitality and danger. Can even sense things that are not visible.]

The phrase ‘Can sense things that are not visible’ was added. If what Lee Taeyeon said was true, then in Solo Mode, even enemies that were ghost types would appear. Sensory Enhancement could prove to be a great advantage when dealing with such entities.

These four skills had updated content.

“It’s much faster than before.”

Even when he was clearing Easy Mode, he had to work hard to raise his proficiency, and there were cases when he spent a whole day just to raise it by 1%.

Unlike that time, the speed was extremely fast now, perhaps because his opponents were of equal strength or stronger.

“What should I level up?”

He could increase the proficiency of his skills by 48%. It was a delightfully decisive moment.

He decided to rule out all the skills he just mentioned.

There were skills that could reach 100% proficiency, but they were not worth using these precious points to raise. At least, that was what Taesan thought.

There were skills whose proficiency levels increased well and others that didn’t.

He was thinking of leveling up the latter.

Naturally, his eyes landed on the Airak Martial Arts skill.

[Advanced Skill: Airak Martial Arts] [Proficiency: 8%] [A skill to handle weapons and the physical body. Still immature; it seems like there might be a loss in power transmission.]

The word ‘advanced’ wasn’t just for show. It was the slowest to increase in proficiency among the skills Taesan had.

Airak Martial Arts was a skill that improved by moving the body.

Despite using it in every battle, it was only at 8%.

“Hmm.”

Taesan stroked his chin. A skill changed its content when it reached 20% proficiency.

Would Airak Martial Arts be worth that?L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was a skill he didn’t fully understand yet.

It could change, or it might not. Even if it did, it might not give him any significant advantage.

Being a rather simple skill that allowed damage to be dealt, even when attacking with body parts other than the weapon, the proficiency might only be related to damage.

Endure was just like that.

Even when the proficiency increased, there were no significant changes other than the damage negation duration.

For the time being, Taesan postponed the decision and checked out his other skills.

“‘Shield?’”

[Special Always-On Skill: Shield] [Proficiency: 3%] [You have obtained a shield that prevents damage. The value of the shield increases in proportion to your health.]

If he increased the skill’s proficiency, the proportional value would rise. It wasn’t bad, but something felt lacking.

Taesan couldn’t easily make a choice. In his dilemma, he asked the ghost.

“Hey.”

[Eh, eh?]

The ghost, who seemed to be deep in thought, was startled.

[What?]

“What do you think about raising the proficiency of Storm Scar’s Sword?”

[Eh... without any conditions?]

“Yeah.”

[...What do you mean?]

It looked like it didn’t understand, but it obediently answered.

[Putting aside whether that would be possible, it's not very good, right?]

“Should I have to move physically to learn it after all?”

[After all, it's swordsmanship. The reason why I agreed to your raising the proficiency at first was because I couldn't help it since I couldn't teach you. Otherwise, you definitely have to move your body. No matter how much knowledge comes into your head, the body is a separate issue.]

It wasn’t surprising since he had anticipated this problem.

Taesan continued to check the skills.

Forced Duel.

Critical Strike.

Thirst for Battle.

Craving for Victory, and so on.

All were good skills to improve. However, he had no intention of raising any of them.

“The problem is that there are too many choices.”

It was, quite literally, a happy problem. Thinking that it would never end this way, Taesan shifted his gaze to another skill.

[Magic] [Proficiency: 2%] [You can use magic. Currently, you might only be able to ignite a flame.]

Magic, something he hadn’t been able to acquire at all in his previous life. He didn’t know how it would evolve.

“Should I check it out?”

There was someone who could give him the answer, so there was no need for him to worry alone.

Taesan returned to the 9th floor and went to find Lilis. As soon as he entered the Safety Zone, an explosion sounded.

“Cough! Cough!”

Lilis was sobbing, her face dusted with white powder.

“This combination doesn’t work… Huh?”

“Hello.”

Taesan greeted her briefly.

“… You’re here?”

She blinked and looked up at Taesan, dusting herself off as she got up.

“You’re earlier than I expected.”

“How much time has passed here?”

“I’ve also forgotten the concept of time… Maybe around three or four days?”

The concept of time here was the same as on Earth. While it was unlikely, it would have been a problem if the axis was completely skewed. Fortunately, it wasn’t.

“Why are you here? Do you have something to show me?”

“Not exactly.”

The proficiency of the Magic skill. When he asked what would happen if he increased it, Lilis tilted her head.

“Why are you asking? It will definitely change… but reaching 20% would take a few years of struggle?”

“I have a way to increase it.”

“… You’re going to increase the proficiency?”

Lilis’ face contorted oddly.

“How are you going to do that? Wait. Is that why you went outside?”

“Something like that.”

Although the details were different, he nodded vaguely, not wanting to explain. Astonishment crossed Lilis’s face.

“You can interfere with the system of the Labyrinth from outside? How did you find it? I searched thoroughly to see if I had something similar, but nothing came up.”

“Nothing like that exists?”

“Proficiency is a rule of the Labyrinth. Here, even those without talent can become strong, but in a way, they’re bound by the rules of this place. That’s why no one can interfere… what exactly is it? It doesn’t even sound possible.”

She still seemed bewildered, unable to comprehend.

“So, how much is it?”

“Around roughly 50.”

“….50%?”

Taesan nodded. Lilis closed her mouth.

For a moment, a dangerous light flashed in her eyes. Her pupils flickered incessantly, and after barely calming down, she exhaled.

“Whew. That was dangerous.”

She wiped her forehead. Her inner turmoil seemed quite severe for a moment as sweat was pouring down.

“It would be best if you didn’t mention that to anyone.”

Her voice was exceptionally serious, unlike her usual demeanor.

“There would be many people who would kill you if they knew. In this place, where one can even cut off their own fingers for just 1%, it should absolutely remain a secret.”

“Is it that serious?”

“Yes. It’s so difficult. I’ve just barely reached 20% with my magic.”

She grumbled, but her words didn’t quite resonate with Taesan. While a proficiency of 50% was undoubtedly valuable, he had several skills that had reached 100%.

“You’re going to use it on magic?”

“I don’t even know what magic is. I’m just thinking about it for now.”

“So that’s why you came to me.”

Lilis began to explain, shaking her head.

“I can’t explain in detail since I’ve only reached 20%, but as you increase your proficiency in magic, its versatility and the number of usable spells increase too. Right now, your proficiency is around 2%, 3%?”

“About that.”

“Then, you probably aren’t fully utilizing the power of beginner-level magic.”

“Is it stronger than this?”

He’s already causing close to 50 damage. In the case of Frost Arrow, it was cold enough to freeze anything it touched within minutes. Lilis spoke as if it was obvious.

“Beginner-level magic? It’s directly named ‘beginner’ by the god of magic. How could it not be strong?”

“Is that so?”

“Roughly 20%. You should be able to fully draw out its power at my level. And the moment it reaches 20%, the skill’s description changes. The ability you gain is reduced mana consumption and significantly increased power.”

Lilis waved her hand. Her body disappeared. It was invisibility magic.

“Originally, I couldn’t use it this long. It disappeared in about 10 seconds. And if the person has good senses, they would notice it right away.

“The moment it hit 20%, it changed like this.”

If her words were true, it was a significant difference. Taesan couldn’t sense her current state. Despite having evolved his sensory enhancement, he couldn’t perceive her, suggesting that without a specific method, one might not be able to sense it at all.

‘Is it worth improving?’

“As I mentioned before, the skill changes at every 20% interval. 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%. In the maze, magic changes through five stages.”

Lilis began her explanation.
