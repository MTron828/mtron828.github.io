Chapter 158: Thirty Fourth Level (2)

[Special Trigger Skill: Soul Conversion]

[Proficiency: 1%]

[Converts the soul's energy into physical strength. The user loses their life after a certain period following its use.]

[What?]

The ghost exclaimed in surprise upon reading the description.

[Lose life? Not the soul?]

Taesan stroked his chin. The effect seemed similar to what the apostle of the goddess used. It was about converting the souls energy into pure strength.

However, the cost was slightly different from what the ghost described.

Instead of soul damage, it was simply the loss of life.

[Huh? Is it because of Soul Ascension? Can it transform like this, too?]

The ghost continued to mutter in confusion. From his perspective, it was an illogical story.

Soul Descent damaged ones soul but granted immense power.

Taesan, who had easily defeated an active apostle, was nearly killed when facing an apostle who activated Soul Descent.

The fall of the soul was a fair price for such power.

And now, it had changed to a cost of life.

Still, its a hefty price to pay.

Whether it was life or soul, losing either meant death. Either way, further exploration of the labyrinth would be impossible.

No.

Taesan narrowed his eyes.

Could it be possible?

He recalled a skill he possessed.

A skill given to him by Pavsha after clearing his trial.

[Special Continuous Trigger Skill: The Proven Soul]

[You have triumphed over another version of yourself. When you face death, your soul will undergo Pavsha's trial.]

There was nothing certain. This skill might differ from his expectations.

But.

It could be enough as his hidden card.

Lets think about it later.

It was a question with no answer for now. With life at stake, he couldnt test it casually.

The first use had to be in a real battle.

[...Yeah. Let's do that.]

The ghost reluctantly agreed. Taesan continued his verification.

There was a system window indicating that apostle transformation was also upgraded by Soul Ascension.

[Special Trigger Skill: Apostle Transformation [Lakiratas]]

[The power bestowed for the first time by the god of struggle and death after their own birth. For 20 minutes, gain a portion of the power possessed by Lakiratas's apostles. This skill cannot be used again for a day after activation.]

The duration had doubled from 10 to 20 minutes. Apostle Transformation, a useful skill that boosts both the souls energy and stats, was a welcome change.

[Apostle Transformation... even that's transformed.]

The ghost moaned.

Apostle Transformation was a power directly given by a god. Specifically, a skill bestowed by Lakiratas, who governs two realms.

Soul Ascension was even interfering with such a skill.

Is this even higher in level than I thought?

As the ghost organized his thoughts, Taesan had also finished his analysis.

Okay.

Taesan clenched his fist.

The apostle was a formidable opponent even for Taesan, requiring him to risk his life, but the reward was worth it.

Having finished all his checks, Taesan proceeded through the labyrinth.

[34th Floor Quest Start.]

[Defeat the boss of the 34th floor and pass through.]

[Reward: Hatulia's Ring.]

[Secret Reward: ???]

The monster on the 34th floor was a knight clad in black armor.

A Death Knight?

[There's no aura of death.]

Just a look-alike, I guess.

Clang.

The black knight charged at him. Its longsword aimed for Taesans neck, slicing through the air.

Taesan lightly swung his sword. His blade clashed with the knights.

Crash.

The knight was sent flying far away.

Taesan walked calmly forward. The knight, staggering to regain its stance, charged again.

Clank!

This time, the knight didnt get pushed back. It began a power struggle with Taesan.

Planting his feet on the ground, he channeled strength throughout his body into the sword.

The knights sword held a power that a normal adventurer on the 34th floor couldnt easily shake off.

But Taesan felt no pressure at all.

Lets see how it has changed.

The reason he didnt immediately defeat the knight was one: to check the effects of his transformed Ability Sword.

Taesan exerted power into his sword. Under the applied force, the knights knees bent, and Taesans sword rose above.

[You have activated Landing.]

The power to suppress the knight momentarily amplified.

The knights knees hit the ground. Despite resisting, its body crouched, and the sword slowly bent.

Looking down at the knight, Taesan exerted more strength in his hand.

Unable to withstand the force, the knight dropped its sword and split in half.

So this is the feeling.

The proficiency of the Ability Sword increased, transforming several skills. One of them was Landing.

[Special Trigger Skill: Landing]

[Mana Consumption: 2]

[Proficiency: 5%]

[Grounds the body from mid-air.]

[Requirement: Advanced Sword Technique [Ability Sword]]

[When your sword is higher than the opponent's weapon, strike them down powerfully.]

He realized its meaning through direct use.

Similar yet different from Leap.

Leap was a skill that allowed a powerful upward strike when below the opponent.

The difference lay in whether one was below or above, though the descriptions were similar.

Taesan moved to the next room to experiment with another knight.

This time, he leaped over the knights head and activated Landing.

Boom!

Even in a situation where proper force couldnt be applied, the skill was activated without a problem. The knights body was crushed under the weight of the striking sword.

Observing the entire process, Taesans eyes shone.

Unlike Leap or Strong Blow, the skill was activated without Taesan exerting any force. He could deliver a proper attack even in situations without a footing.

The condition that the sword must be positioned higher than the opponents weapon existed, but given the nature of the skill, it was a condition that naturally had to be overcome. There was no major issue.

Having completed his checks, Taesan moved on to find another enemy.

The change wasnt just in the Landing skill.

In the next room, a knight charged at him.

[You have activated Mitigation.]

Crack.

Taesans sword collided with the knights. He frowned.

He exerted force in his sword, repelling the knight and checking the Mitigation skill.

[Special Trigger Skill: Mitigation]

[Mana Consumption: 30]

[Proficiency: 1%]

[Reduces the ratio of damage taken. The reduction is still quite minimal.]

[Requirement: Advanced Sword Technique [Ability Sword]]

[If the swords collide, it slightly reduces the strain on your sword.] F√¥ll√¥w ùíèew stories at nùíê/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Is this really working?

[Can you even notice such a difference at this level?]

The ghost spoke as if it were obvious.

The changed Mitigation skill reduced the strain on his sword. It was a skill that prevented being easily overpowered even when facing a stronger enemy.

However, the difference in strength between him and the knight was overwhelmingly in his favor.

He couldnt ascertain the skills effect against such a weak opponent.

What a waste.

Taesan sliced through the charging knight in one strike.

Looks like I wont be able to check the other changes either.

There were more changed skills. But at this level, it was difficult to verify their proper effects.

[Should I check them next time?]

That seems like a good idea.

Taesan nodded and moved forward.

Taesan had become stronger.

He had gained numerous powers by passing through the battleground of the gods and defeating the apostle of the forgotten goddess.

Already strong, he had become even more formidable.

Now, the monsters on the 34th floor were no match for him.

Even normal attacks couldnt be blocked, and a mere swing put them in a near-death state.

In fact, there was no need to even use his sword.

How trivial.

An unexpected side effect. The current labyrinth no longer offered him any thrill.

Taesan effortlessly cleared the floor and contacted other players for the first time in a while.

[Lee Taeyeon [Solo]: We are currently working on the 12th floor.]

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: Oh? That's faster than I thought.]

The last time they talked, they were raiding the 10th floor. So, he thought they would be on the 11th floor by now, but they were already on the 12th. Much faster than expected.

Lee Taeyeon clarified the answer to his question.

[Lee Taeyeon [Solo]: It's all thanks to you, Taesan.]

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: My doing?]

[Lee Taeyeon [Solo]: The Blessing of Struggle and Death. It really made us stronger.]

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: Ah, that?]

[Lee Taeyeon [Solo]: Yes, it's been incredibly helpful.]

Lakiratas gave them the blessing when Taesan defeated a Grade B monster. The talent of struggle and death.

The talent for death was mentioned, but its meaning was hard to understand. The important aspect was the talent for struggle.

The process of battle had definitely changed. Taesan, now more skilled and faster, realized that the change must be even more significant for others.

Reminded of this, he also contacted Kim Junggeun, who echoed similar sentiments. Thanks to the talent of struggle and death, they could break through much faster than before.

[Junggeun [Hard]: Ah, hyung, do you know about it?]

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: Know about what?]

[Junggeun [Hard]: About... the people in other modes.]

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: I don't know. I'm not really interested.]

At that moment, Taesan was conversing with Lee Taeyeon, Kang Jun-hyeok, and Kim Junggeun, not using the community, so he wasnt aware of the situation there.

[Junggeun [Hard]: You don't know, huh.]

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: Don't know what? Explain.]

[Junggeun [Hard]: Well... how should I put this? Simply put, people are worshiping you.]

Taesan paused.

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: What did you say?]

[Lee Taeyeon [Solo]: Huh? You haven't checked yet?]

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: Why would I watch what they're blabbering about?]

He had not paid any attention to the community as it held no value for him.

[Lee Taeyeon [Solo]: Then check it out when you have time. It might not be a problem, but ignorance could lead to issues.]

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: Alright. Oh, right.]

[Lee Taeyeon [Solo]: Anything else?]

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: You passed the 10th floor, right?]

[Lee Taeyeon [Solo]: Yes.]

Then, it was about time for her to meet the Guides of Sin.

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: If someone claiming to be the Guides of Sin appears, it's better to do as I say.]

It wasnt the best method, but it was a way to solve the problem for now.

Hearing Taesans explanation, they groaned.

[Lee Taeyeon [Solo]: Uhm... do we have to do that?]

[Kang Junhyeon [Solo]: I don't like it, but]

[Kang Taesan [Solo]: Even if you don't like it, there's no other way. You can't do what I do. So, it can't be helped.]

They reluctantly agreed, though somewhat begrudgingly.

After finishing the explanation, Taesan closed the window and opened the community.

He fell silent.

[Han Nara [Easy]: Where might Kang Taesan have reached now?]

[Kim Sein [Normal]: Maybe he's passed the 50th floor? He must have at least reached that far.]

[Han Nara [Easy]: We just have to wait. He will save us.]

After briefly scanning the community, Taesan turned it off.

Looking any further seemed like it would muddle his mind.

Whats going on?

[What's the matter?]

Nothing much.

Taesan explained to the ghost. After listening quietly, the ghost spoke.

[It doesn't seem like anything unusual.]

Really?

[As you said, if every human obtained the talent of struggle and death, that's a great feat. People naturally worship those who accomplish such feats, especially if it benefits them.]

Is that so?

This life was certainly different from the previous one. Back then, he was the only strong one, but now, he had helped all humans become stronger.

It should be fine.

It was just worship, nothing direct.

Taesan cleared his mind and continued to conquer the labyrinth.

Even moving slowly, he soon arrived at the boss room. Just as he was about to enter.

Swoosh.

Space split open.

Black energy swirled out, forming a shape.

Taesan stopped and watched the formation.

[Hello, my child.]

Its been a while.

The Demon God revealed herself.
