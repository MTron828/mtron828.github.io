Chapter 164: Forced Return (1)

Is this how things are settled?

The power of the Immortal changed the structure of the monsters and floors in the labyrinth. Since the floor was still technically the 36th, Taesan received all the usual rewards upon clearing it.

Not bad.

There would have been no issue if he hadnt received the rewards, but fortunately, he did.

Taesan browsed through the system window, item by item.

My level has increased more than I expected.

The monsters on the 36th floor were originally no match for Taesan, making it difficult to expect any growth from clearing it. However, the trial of the Immortal had boosted his level by three steps.

First, Taesan started to check the rewards for clearing the 36th floor.

A small spark of lightning flickered in Taesans hand.

[Lightning Struck Dead Tree]

[Lightning struck a dead tree and took form. It seems meaningful changes could occur when used as a projectile.]

Its not a lightning-struck dead tree.

It was the opposite. Taesan mused over the origin of the item as he drew an arrow.

When he attached the lightning-struck dead tree to an arrow he had acquired from disarming a trap, the lightning enveloped the arrow with a crackling sound.

[Self-Aware Lightning Arrow]

[An arrow that moves on its own to protect its owner. It possesses a consciousness and can move independently. It cannot travel beyond a certain range.]

[Current Owner: Kang Taesan]

[User's rank is insufficient. Attack Power: 1]

[Contains the essence of the lightning-struck dead tree. Attack Power +50]

[Inflicts an electrified state on the enemy it hits.]

Oh?

The attack power had increased by 50. It was a significant boost.

Additionally, the value of the arrow was enhanced by the electrified state it could impose.

Taesan possessed a total of four arrows. They were useful but nearly harmless tools that had offered little assistance. Even against the apostle this time, they had not been very effective.

However, if he could obtain three more like this, they would truly be useful.

[Nuclear Fragment Bracelet]

[Attack Power +35]

[Defense Power +60]

[Bracelet refined with materials from the deepest part of the planet.]

[Obtains additional stats when fighting entities related to nature.]

The bracelet boasted high attack and defense power, along with additional effects. Taesan reviewed the secret rewards with a sense of satisfaction.

[??? was used.]

[Obtained the Rough Grasp Gauntlet.]

[Rough Grasp Gauntlet]

[Attack Power +50]

[Made from a portion of a gauntlet that once crushed everything. The former owner's power still lingers.]

[Mysterious power is sealed within.]

Whats this?

The attack power seemed too low.

He had expected it to be in the 70s or 80s, but it was just 50. That was a mere 20 more than the gauntlet he had acquired earlier.

Could this be the cause?

[Mysterious power is sealed within.]

Perhaps unsealing it might reveal additional abilities. For the moment, lacking a method to unseal it, Taesan put the matter aside and donned the gauntlet.

His level had increased, and he had gained valuable equipment. The outcome was more rewarding than he had anticipated.

Then there was the reward from the Immortal.

It differed from what the gods had bestowed upon him so far; it was purely a boost in stats.

[A manifestation of the hunchback who delved into twisted mysteries. Your health increases by 800, mana by 200, and attack power by 80.]

Quite straightforward.

[Can't help it. Since the Immortal doesn't possess a domain, he can't grant power specific to one. But it's not bad, right?]

An increase of 800 in health, 200 in mana, and an 80-point boost in attack power. Just by considering the numbers, it was akin to wielding an extra weapon in terms of added attack power. Given that, the skill was quite valuable.

And finally, the staff.

[The Twisted Staff of Calamity]

[Magic +40]

[This staff caused the world's destruction due to personal greed.]

[Every time you kill an opponent using magic with this staff, magic increases by 1. In exchange, attack power decreases by 1 and health by 10.]

A progressive type of equipment.

The magic was an impressive 40. If it increased by 1 with each kill, given the right conditions, it could soar into the hundreds.

Certainly, a valuable item. Difficult for a magician to find anything superior. Yet, the penalty rendered it impractical.

Was this the staff used by the Immortal?

The description seemed to suggest so.

Taesan stored the staff. It was unusable for him now but too precious to throw away. He intended to have a blacksmith modify it.

[Immortals are beings who failed to become Transcendents. As such, they vary greatly. Some, like this one, attempt to kill you, while others might be amicable.]

The Immortals possess stronger personalities than the gods.

Taesan glanced towards the floors end before departing.

An Immortal.

Beings who fell short of godhood.

And the distinction was in attaining power that matched their rank.

It was a thought that he couldnt shake. Which side was he on? Whether he was consciously working towards it or not.

Just as Taesan was about to dismiss his deep thoughts and start down the stairs,

Ah.

He halted.

A powerful force from the floor above made its presence known.

That force was beckoning Taesan.

Finally.

[Is it time already? This feels somewhat premature.]

The ghost complained. Taesan, who was previously headed to the 37th floor, changed direction towards the source of the force.

It was a secret chamber on the floor.

Have you arrived?

Lilis awaited Taesan there.

Her aura seemed more refined than when he last saw her. She hadnt grown stronger, but it appeared she had discovered a way to progress to the next stage.

I see your skills have improved.

Thanks to you.

Liliss smile was subdued.

You dont like unnecessary chatter, so Ill get straight to the point. The god of magic has summoned you.

Her eyes shone.

Specifically for intermediate magic, Taesan nodded, understanding.

He had anticipated this. If the god of magic had gone out of his way to call him, there was no other reason.

The ghost, still skeptical, groaned.

[Too much... He's strong, but it's too soon for him to receive intermediate magic.]

Maybe the god of magic has something in mind? I dont think he would do anything harmful to adventurers.

[That's true, but...]

So, how do we proceed?

Taesan cut in. From his perspective, regardless of being too much or not, any opportunity to become stronger was the right choice.

Lilis calmly raised her finger.

Sit in front of the beads.

She pointed to the small beads arranged at specific angles.

Close your eyes and pray, and the god of magic will call you.

Taesan sat in front of the beads. Lilis hesitated before speaking.

If possible please tell the god of magic that I am always grateful.

Taesan nodded and closed his eyes.

Prayer.

He realized he had never genuinely prayed before.

Even at the statue of the forgotten goddess, he had only posed to pray and received skills, and the skill for praying to the demon god was just a one-off activation.

It had been the same in his previous life. He didnt believe in gods.

If there are gods, why must we endure this? Why must we die like this? Such feelings had dominated him.

The more he saw people dying while calling out to the gods, the firmer his disbelief became.

And it was the same now.

He still didnt believe in gods.

But a formal prayer that he could manage.

Taesan clasped his hands. Lilis swallowed hard.

Then, the space opened.

It was the moment an alien space tried to engulf Taesan.

[Special Quest Initiated]

[Return to Earth.]

[Immediate return will commence.]

[This quest cannot be refused.]

Taesans pupils dilated.

His body underwent a forceful transition. The alien space faded, revealing glimpses of Earth.

[What? At this timing?]

The ghost panicked. A return to Earth just as he was about to meet the god of magic seemed too deliberate to be coincidental.

Damn.

Taesan clicked his tongue.

His past experiences told him that he couldnt refuse special quests involving a return to Earth.

Ill have to meet the god of magic later.

Just as the space of Earth was about to engulf him,

[How dare they.]

A voice tinged with amusement yet filled with anger, resonated.

[Such audacity. To do this just as he's about to meet me?]

With chuckling laughter, the pathway to Earth closed.

Sensing the shift in energy, Taesan looked around.

Countless galaxies became visible.

It was a scene Taesan had once seen through a telescope at an observatory during his childhood but was now unfolding before him.

[Impressive, isn't it?]

Taesan turned toward the source of the voice.

There stood a young man with eyes shining like starlight, his arms spread wide.

[I made it. What do you think?]

Its beautiful.

His compliment was genuine; the sight was truly beautiful. The man grinned.

[Thanks.]

The man snapped his fingers, and a leather chair materialized behind Taesan.

[We won't need long, but let's sit and have a chat.]

Taesans body crackled uneasily as if immense powers were clashing within him.

The man settled into his chair. Taesan leaned back into his own chair obediently.

[You probably know already, but introductions are still necessary, right?]

The man lifted a finger. Starlight lingered on it before exploding like fireworks, scattering in all directions.

Taesan could feel it. The brilliant light of the fireworks literally contained the power of stars.

[I am the one involved in the design of the labyrinth, the one who established and created the skill called magic within it. I am the god who governs the domain of magic.]

The man allowed a slight smile to cross his face.

[The god of magic, Zelbando.]

It was Taesans fourth encounter with a god of the labyrinth.

The first had been the god of choice, Maria. Her power was violently strong, yet it didnt feel oppressive. She allowed one to make choices freely.

Next came the demon god, Lucifer. Her power was profound and restrained. She embraced what belonged to her but rejected all else.

Then there was the god of struggle and death, Lakiratas. His strength was sheer and undeniable.

He possessed the power to crush and dominate everything.

And now, with the god of magic, Zelbando, no distinct power was apparent.

More precisely, it was entirely self-contained. Sensing Taesans awareness, Zelbando muttered discontentedly.

[You've only encountered foolish gods until now. A god should preserve their dignity and respect mortals. Just appearing out of nowhere, making offers. What's that about?]

Thats true.

Indeed, he was unlike any god Taesan had met before. The god of magic glanced at the ghost.

[Hello?]

[...Greetings.]

[It's regrettable. I had hoped you might eventually reach it. Even if you couldn't overcome it.]

[I acknowledge my shortcomings.]

[Really?]

Zelbandos eyes, twinkling like stars, narrowed.

[Then what decision will you make?] RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

[...I don't understand.]

[A conversation for another time. You will need to choose from three options. Be careful not to err.]

The ghost fell silent at the significant statement.

Zelbando shifted his attention back to Taesan.

[Shall we proceed to the matter at hand? You're here for one reason, correct?]

Taesan nodded.

He was seeking intermediate magic; that was his purpose here.

Zelbandos mouth twisted into a wry expression.

[I had planned to present a trial to you. Upon its completion, I intended to grant access to intermediate magic. But... annoying interferences have occurred.]

With a snap of his fingers, the god of magic restored some balance to Taesans body, which had been fizzing with instability.

However, the newfound steadiness was short-lived and began to tremble once again.

[Those rat-like beings, always meddling, sneaking between the labyrinth and my territory.]

The god of magic laugheda cold, angry laugh.

[Dare they interfere when I'm about to give a trial?]

A calm yet furious energy spread, and the ghost swallowed hard.

[So, I'll change the quest content slightly. Kang Taesan. This quest is separate from intermediate magic.]

The god of magics voice echoed.

[Return to Earth. There, trample the pride of the ancient gods who dared to interfere with our meeting, and destroy their creations. Afterward, I'll give you a reward commensurate with your achievements.]

[Sub Quest Initiated]

[The god of magic, angered by the ancient gods' interference, desires for you to crush their pride.]

[Reward: The god of magic will determine it based on your performance.]
