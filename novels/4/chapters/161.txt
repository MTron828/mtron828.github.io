Chapter 162: Thirty Sixth Level, The Hunchback Pursuing Twisted Mysteries (2)

[Unlike the gods, who manage domains and thus have a clear purpose, they lack one. They move solely according to their desires.]

It doesnt seem much different from the gods.

[It is different. Gods' desires are related to their domains, but these beings' desires are only for themselves.]

Gods were bound to their domains, whether they liked it or not. Their actions, therefore, were restricted and somewhat predictable.

But immortals were different. They were free. Therefore, their actions were hard to predict, and foreseeing what they might do was difficult.

How do they compare to Lakiratas?

[Compared to immortals, Lakiratas is quite merciful. He may act independently, but at least he operates within the realm of strife and death. That makes him predictable and manageable. These beings, however, are different.]

During the trial, there were beings even more unpredictable than the gods who changed the content of the trial. The ghost continued to speak.

[They are free-spirited beings. Some dislike you, and some like you.]

This time, its the former, isnt it?

Taesan felt a gaze on him.

It was filled with annoyance.

A massive will descended on the ruins.

[The power of the Hunchback Pursuing Twisted Mysteries has diminished.]

[The Hunchback Pursuing Twisted Mysteries proposes an enhanced trial for you.]

Taesan stared quietly at the system window.

A quest unlike any he had faced before and unpredictable.

Taesan nodded.

Ill accept it.

[Sub-quest started.]

[The Hunchback Pursuing Twisted Mysteries tests you.]

[The Labyrinth Transformation Begins.]

[The Twisted Will covers the 36th floor.]

Suddenly, a cold sensation wrapped around him.

Taesan instinctively knew.

The spreading aura was a kind of grace. Similar to the blessings gods bestow, it enhanced the power of mortals and granted them new strength.

[The power of the Hunchback Pursuing Twisted Mysteries manifests. The Distortion of Twistedness is activated.]

The power faded, and the labyrinth returned to its normal state, just as it had been when Taesan first arrived.

But Taesan frowned.

This isnt good.

[Uh... what's this?]

The ghost seemed puzzled as well.

Regardless, they had to check. Clutching his sword, Taesan moved forward past the ruins.

Then, he encountered a monster.

Whats this now?

The monster on the 36th floor was a knight clad in blue armor, brandishing a sword.

Its movements were swift, and its refined swordplay would have posed quite a challenge for an ordinary adventurer.

But what stood before Taesan now was something entirely different.

The blue knights body was grotesquely twisted.

The sword had melded with its arm, and the armor was pitted with rust, dripping in places.

[The Blue Knight, blessed by the Twisted Mysteries, has appeared.]

Is this supposed to be a blessing?

The power radiating from the knight had indeed intensified.

But that was all. In exchange for power, the knight had lost its normal form.

[Because it's not a god.]

The ghost sighed.

[Unlike gods, immortals lack the necessary stature. They can force their power onto mortals, but they cannot bestow a stable blessing like gods. Many sought the power to become apostles of immortals, but...]

So, thats the result.

A being completely distorted and deteriorated.

Such was the fate of those who received the power of immortals.

[This isn't good.]

As the ghost murmured, the knight sprang into action.

With its sword fused to its arm, the knight charged at Taesan aggressively.

Simultaneously, a piercing cold emanated from the knights entire body. The chill, potent enough to freeze ones lungs, was imbued with a magical aura.

Clang!

Their swords collided.

However, the knight managed to block Taesans sword.

A typical monster on the 36th floor would have been sent flying by the mere clash of swords, but this knight held its ground against Taesan, albeit being pushed back.

[What's this?]

Taesan parried the knights sword and lunged at its chest.

Clang!

[The Blue Knight Blessed by the Twisted Mysteries takes 222 damage.]

Taesan stepped back after seeing the damage window. The ghost muttered, not understanding the situation.

[Why only this much damage?]

Isnt it strange?

It was an attack amplified by Addition and Strong Blow. Given Taesans attack power, it should have caused damage exceeding a thousand.

At a glance, its a physical enhancement and reduction of physical damage. Even if its from an immortal, a blessing like that?

Even to the ghost, the knight seemed too strong.

[This is strange. Really strange.]

The ghost murmured. Taesan focused on the knight.

The previous attack had barely inflicted any damage. An attack enhanced by Addition and Strong Blow, yet so little damage indicated extreme resistance to physical attacks.

The grace came from the Immortal of the Twisted Mysteries.

And, as Taesan knew, Mysteries often implied magic.

Thud.

Taesan stomped his foot.

[You have activated Fireball.]

Flames appeared next to Taesan, who rushed forward. He blocked the knights sword and detonated the fireball.

Boom!

[The Blue Knight Blessed by the Twisted Mysteries takes 201 damage.]

As expected.

It was clear now. The knight had a high resistance to physical attacks but was vulnerable to magical attacks.

Taesan stepped back again. The ghost, now understanding the situation, spoke incredulously.

[This is a bit too much.]

The nature of the trial had become clear. The intent seemed to be to pass the floor using only magic, not swordplay or skills.

A challenging trial, indeed.

Taesan had primarily used magic for support, not as his main approach. He wasnt highly skilled in it.

Moreover, passing would not be easy since all the floors monsters likely received the same blessing.

But its not impossible.

[You have activated Frost Arrow.]

Ssshh.

An arrow of ice that froze space materialized. Taesan launched it directly at the knight.

As the knight swung its sword to deflect the arrow, Taesan activated another spell.

[You have activated Magical Explosion.]

Boom!

The Frost Arrow exploded, scattering shards. The knight failed to block in time and was pierced all over.

Taesan, seeing the staggering knight, used his magic again.

[You have activated Lightning Strike.]

Crack!

Lightning pierced the knight. The knight shook it off and rushed toward Taesan.

Taesan waved his hand.

[You have activated Wind Explosion.]

Wind exploded in front of the knight. The knights body shook momentarily, halting its charge toward Taesan.Aall ùíèùíÜwest chùíÇptùíÜrs on n.o./vùíÜlùíÉi/n/(.)cùíêm

After confirming that Wind Explosion could block the charge, Taesan repeatedly activated it. The knight was shaken and pushed back.

It seems theres a misconception.

Taesan didnt primarily use magic because he was strong enough without it, not because his magic was weak.

Thanks to the points he had spent on magic from his Earth Return rewards, his proficiency in magic exceeded 40%. Considering the power of the guides who used magic, this was quite high for the 30th floor.

This works out well.

It wasnt that he couldnt handle the situation with his sword. It would take longer than usual, but he could definitely defeat it.

But since he was about to learn intermediate magic, he planned to increase his proficiency with this opportunity.

The Hunchback Pursuing Twisted Mysteries was forcing Taesan to use magic with all its might.

Then Ill do just that.

He decided to pass the trial using only magic.

Taesan equipped the items he had saved to enhance his magic and continuously cast spells to defeat the knight.

The massive will observing Taesan momentarily wavered.

It was subtle, but Taesan sensed a mix of disturbance.

Whats this?

Taesan wondered as he moved on.

In the next room, another twisted knight awaited him. Taesan used various spells to defeat it.

The magic itself didnt deal high damage, so it took some time, but defeating it wasnt a significant problem.

Once again, the observing will wavered.

The emotions it contained were intense enough for Taesan to recognize.

Anger and irritation.

This is strange.

The gods Taesan had encountered so far expressed rich emotions, but they always maintained a transcendents serenity and composure.

But the Hunchback Pursuing Twisted Mysteries was different. It reacted to Taesans actions with irritation, like an ordinary human.

Such behavior was uncharacteristic for a being of higher stature. The ghost explained the reason.

[It's simple. Immortals are twisted beings.]

Twisted?

[I mentioned before, right? They possess the power to reach transcendence but lack the necessary stature. It's like giving a precious sword to a foolish child. They're monstrously strong, but mentally weak at the same time.]

Is that even possible?

Immortals were supposed to be far stronger than mortals. The leaders of the Guides Taesan had met had unimaginable power, yet they hadnt penetrated the deeper layers, affirming this belief.

However, the concept of being mentally weak and unstable was difficult for Taesan to grasp.

[There are typically two types of immortals. Those who have legitimately built up power but lack the stature to become transcendent, and those who have gained power through shortcuts from the outset. The latter, in particular, are incapable of reaching the status of a transcendent.]

The ghosts voice was dispassionate, devoid of any awe or respect.

[Shortcuts have their limits. That's the fate of those who've accumulated power in such a manner. The Hunchback Pursuing Twisted Mysteries is likely one of those beings.]

The voice was laced with disdain.

[Let me tell you something about those who used shortcuts, like the Guides of Sin. They dislike them because they see a reflection of themselves. And they resent beings like you because you tread a path they couldn't.]

Bad memories?

[I've had my fair share of troubles. I didn't dissuade you from taking the trials because there's something to gain; frankly, I don't like them.]

The ghosts tone was tinged with irritation.

[Immortals who have gained power through shortcuts lack both the stature and the mindset appropriate for their strength. They are merely powerful. They wield their power recklessly and often resort to violence against those with genuine talent. Just observe our current predicament.]

A knight materialized in front of Taesan. Taesan summoned his spells and repelled the knight.

[The grace that endows your power and mitigates physical damage has permeated the floor? For an immortal, that is an excessive favor. They likely sought to kill you, not merely test you. They are probably panicking because things are not proceeding as planned.]

Why would they go to such lengths?

[Because it's the Hunchback Pursuing Twisted Mysteries. They have probably despised you ever since you were granted the privilege of learning intermediate magic from the god of magic.]

Taesan hesitated.

He had indeed been granted the privilege of learning intermediate magic from the god of magic.

All this just for that?

[Those who take shortcuts often respond with violence, even when gods show a modicum of interest in a mortal.]

The ghost clicked its tongue.

[Those who gained power through shortcuts lack the necessary stature. Yet, they allow jealousy and envy to consume them, venting their anger on mortals. You must be wary. There are likely many immortals who harbor ill will towards you.]

As the ghost concluded its warning, a golden wave enveloped the space.

[The might of the Hunchback Pursuing Twisted Mysteries has significantly waned.]

[The influence of the Hunchback Pursuing Twisted Mysteries manifests. The Distortion of Twistedness intensifies.]
