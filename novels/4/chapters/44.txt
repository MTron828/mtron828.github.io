“No defense? You’re saying I have to just take the hits?”

[If we're talking theoretically, yes.]

“It doesn’t seem like a very good swordsmanship technique.”

If there was no defense, it would be hard to even call it a sword technique. The ghost gave a careful explanation.

[I said there's no defense, but that doesn't mean you don't block attacks altogether. You know the saying' the best defense is a good offense'? It's like that. You preemptively stop the opponent's movements. You attack where the opponent is going to move their sword, blocking from our side. If you had to put it into words, it would be an aggressive defense?]

“Hmm.”

Having used a sword extensively himself, Taesan understood what that meant.

“But there are certain attacks that can’t be blocked.”

The opponent’s movements were anticipated, and their attacks were stopped. It sounded good. However, in the end, this was based on the movement of an attack. Perfect blocking would be impossible.

[You just take the hit.] [But in return, you attack even more. There are complete strategies for that as well.]

“It’s not a very stable sword technique.”

[It is risky. But its power is certain. I couldn't learn magic very extensively since the gods were annoyingly picky. My innate talent was also lacking, so I was stuck with beginner magic.]

However, the ghost had descended deep into the dungeon. Trusting only his sword technique, he broke through this place.

[If it was a weak sword technique, it would be impossible. What will you do?]

“There’s no ‘what.’ I’m obviously learning it.”

Taesan was already fond of the chicken game, where both participants risked their health and rushed in. He had Endurance and could also nullify attacks, so it was just the right sword technique for him.

[Good.]

The ghost said, seemingly relieved.

[Then let's start the lessons.]

“Do I need to show respect?”

[As I said before, there's no need for that. This is a kind of trade.]

“But how are you going to teach me?”

The ghost didn’t have a body. It was a being that, being dead, could not interfere with the living.

[Don't worry about that. I have permission up to this point.]

The ghost placed a hand on Taesan’s shoulder.

He felt a weight that he hadn’t felt until now.

[A raging storm. A scar like a fingernail mark.]

The subdued voice resonated.

[Storm Scar Sword. The only remnant left of my world.] [You learned the Storm Scar Sword from the owner of the Storm Scar Sword. You learned the Advanced Skill [Storm Scar Sword].]

An advanced skill. This was a level of skill he had not seen before.

[You have learned the Airak martial arts, but my swordsmanship follows a different track. It won't be integrated.]

“Eugh.”

He didn’t feel anything.

When he learned the Airak martial arts, some kind of concept and theory came into his mind, but this time there was nothing when he learned the skill.

[Advanced Skill: Storm Scar Sword] [Proficiency: 0%] [A sword technique passed down from a ruined world. Now, only one person has mastered it.]

The proficiency was 0%. Considering that all the skills he had gained started at 1%, it was definitely different from the norm.

[I am a Swordmaster. Owner of a title that is given only to those who have mastered the sword. In the maze of skills, my proficiency is 100%... but I'm a dead man. I wasn't allowed to go that far.]

“So, I need to learn it by myself.”

[Even though that's the case, communicating verbally is possible, so I'll do what I can.]

The ghost began to explain.

The ghost explained kindly. From one to ten, all the postures to take, and how to respond in various situations. His kindness was such that even a master would not instruct to this extent.

[So, it's not about blocking attacks; it's about responding to them. You have to keep your line. If the line is crossed, just abandon it and pierce your opponent.]

“…What do you mean?”

But Taesan could not understand.

The ghost was eagerly explaining, but it was too abstract or too concrete, making it hard to comprehend. He could understand a sentence or two, but they weren’t particularly meaningful. Taesan knew many of these types.

[Groan.]

The ghost groaned.

[Explaining swordsmanship verbally is indeed an impossible task.]

Swordsmanship was ultimately a physical skill. Learning by moving and practicing directly rather than hearing hundreds of words was much faster.

However, the ghost was a deceased entity and couldn’t intervene. All it could do was verbalize, and Taesan was struggling to understand.

“When attacking an opponent’s chest, do you mean to bend your arm, move to the left, and use the momentum of your whole body?”

[Yes. Do you get the feeling?]

“I don’t think so.”

He tried to move his body, but it resulted in strange movements. The ghost clicked his tongue in frustration as time passed without progress.

[As I expected, we're stuck here. How should we do this?]

Taesan closed his mouth without a word. The ghost spoke anxiously.

[This is not because you lack talent or anything like that. It just doesn't make sense. Swordsmanship is about moving the body. Even the written doctrines are written based on the experiences of those who have moved their bodies. So, until you actually move, you can't understand what it means.]

The ghost seemed to worry that Taesan might give up or become pessimistic at a very fast pace.

Contrary to the ghost’s concern, Taesan had not given up.

“Can proficiency also be considered ‘experience’?”

[Eh? Since it can be built up only through direct usage and acquisition, isn't it indeed experience?]

The ghost answered in surprise at the sudden question. Taesan sorted out his thoughts.

Proficiency could be gained by accumulating experience.

So conversely, if you raised your proficiency, did you gain experience?

It was worth trying. Taesan took out a potion from his inventory.

[Proficiency Boost Potion] [Raises the proficiency of one skill by 5%] [Oh, that.]

The ghost noticed it, too, albeit belatedly.

[Is that... possible?]

Taesan drank the potion.

[You have used the Proficiency Boost Potion.] [The proficiency of Storm Scar's sword has increased.]

“Woah.”

All sorts of information flooded into his mind instantly.

The way to wield a sword.

The way to block an attack.

The way to use strength.

All of that steadily fell into place.

Taesan stood up.

When attacking an opponent’s chest, bend your arm and move to the left, then use the elasticity of your whole body.

It was a statement he couldn’t understand just moments ago.

Taesan gripped the sword and moved his body. Thrusting the sword, bending his arm, and turning his body to the left, he swung his arm as if bouncing off with the help of the recoil.

His body naturally turned a full circle.

Whoosh!

The sound of his sword splitting the air rang loudly. The clean movement he couldn’t do earlier was now possible.

“It works.”

[Oh... So this kind of workaround is possible.] [Kang Taesan has invited Kang Junhyeok.] [Kang Taesan[Solo]: Is it still the same?] [Kang Junhyeok[Solo]: Yes. It's driving me crazy. Whenever I try to have a conversation, they keep interrupting and picking fights. Why do these crazy guys do this?]

Taesan could feel the anger through the text. There was a reason why Kang Junghyeok was this angry.

[Kang Junhyeok[Solo]: Why on earth are they calling us the enemy in Easy Mode? I just don't understand?] [Kang Taesan[Solo]: Because the labyrinth is too big of an enemy. You need an enemy that's easier to understand.] [Kang Junhyeok[Solo]: So why are they doing that in the first place?] [Kang Taesan[Solo]: I don't know their thoughts either. They may think it's beneficial.]

He knew why Choi Junghyuk was acting like that. But that was information known by the previous Taesan. He couldn’t tell him now.

[Kang Taesan[Solo]: Just ignore them like now. There will be set guys who keep blabbering.] [Kang Junhyeok[Solo]: Only Choi Junghyuk and a few of his flunkies are blabbering. Ah, it's annoying.] [Kang Taesan[Solo]: How's the labyrinth anyway?] [Kang Junhyeok[Solo]: For now, I'm roaming around the 2nd floor. It's tough, but I manage by catching one monster at a time. My level also went up not too long ago, so it got a bit easier.] [Kang Taesan[Solo]: That's good, then. Don't touch my stash.] [Kang Junhyeok[Solo]: Hmph, I'm tempted... but can't help it.] [Kang Taesan[Solo]: Going to fight the boss soon?] [Kang Junhyeok[Solo]: I will go once I'm done exploring. I have to defeat it.] [Kang Taesan[Solo]: Be careful then. That one uses mental magic.]

The boss of the 2nd floor was a goblin wielding a staff. Taesan, being semi-immune to mental attacks, passed without any problem, but the situation was different for others.

[Kang Taesan[Solo]: You should buy some immunity potions from the shop.] [Kang Junhyeok[Solo]: Yup. I always appreciate your advice. My stats are pretty high, so if I handle the mental part, there won't be a problem.] [Kang Taesan[Solo]: How high are your stats now?] [Kang Junhyeok[Solo]: Around 15 overall? I heard it's higher than sister Taeyeon.]

Overall stats of 15. Just as Kang Junhyeok said, it was not a weak number.

[Kang Taesan[Solo]: I see. That's good.] [Kang Junhyeok[Solo]: What about you, brother?] [Kang Taesan[Solo]: Do you want to know?] [Kang Junhyeok[Solo]: ...No, I think it's better not to know.] [Kang Taesan[Solo]: We'll see later.] [Kang Junhyeok[Solo]: You said the same thing last time, but can we really see each other later? I feel like I might die before then.] [Kang Taesan[Solo]: We can see each other.]

Kang Junhyeok would definitely see him as long as he didn’t do anything crazy.

Taesan closed the Community.

[Is it over?]

“Alright.”

Taesan stood up, gripping his sword. Not the sword he always used, nor Lakiratas’s sword, but two rusty swords, each with an attack power of 1.

He had returned to the store and bought them. The dwarf gave him a look of confusion as to why he would buy them, but to Taesan, they were necessary weapons. He also took off all his equipment that had attack power attached to it.

His attack power now was 2.

He moved on to the next room.

“Grr!”

[A Lizardman Warrior has appeared.]

A Warrior. A monster one rank lower than a gladiator. The weapon it used was either a sword or a spear.

[Perfect.]

Recalling the memories in his head, Taesan dashed forward. The Lizardman swung his sword.

Clang!

The sword blade jangled violently, creating a deadlock. Taesan didn’t avoid the attack targeting his whole body but rather pushed further into it.

It was his first practical application of swordsmanship. Therefore, he decided to fight in a conventional way first.

Clang! Clank!

He launched an attack and circled around the Lizardman. The Lizardman gritted his teeth and moved his hand.

Taesan attacked towards the trajectory where the sword was about to move.

Clash!

The Lizardman’s movement, which was about to attack, shifted to defense as the swords clashed. Seizing the gap, Taesan plunged his sword into the Lizardman’s chest.

[5 damage to Lizardman Warrior.] [6 damage to Lizardman Warrior.]

“Gah!”

The Lizardman held onto its sword. Taesan couldn’t properly respond to the attack where the handle was swung down at him in previous fights.

But now, he knew how to respond. All of that information was in his head.

Just like that, Taesan pulled up the hilt of his sword. The two hilts collided.

Clang!

“Eek!”

He cut straight through. The damage window ostentatiously obscured his view.

“Aargh!”

However, having removed equipment with additional attack power, the damage was minimal. The Lizardman was still vigorously swinging his weapon.

Taesan also squared off with him. He organized the numerous pieces of information resounding noisily in his head and showed it through his body.

Finally, after a battle lasting over an hour, he was able to win.

“Aah…”

[You have triumphed over the Lizardman Warrior.] [The proficiency of the Storm Scar Sword has increased by 1%.]

His proficiency increased. The ghost pointed out Taesan’s movements.

[It's important to strike, but it's also crucial to pull back. Use that pulling back motion as the movement for the attack.]

He grasped the theory, but his practical application was still immature. Taesan finished his confirmation.

‘It’s a good skill.’

If it wasn’t for Storm Scar, it would have taken two hours. In terms of quickly delivering damage and continuing the attack, it was an exceptional skill.

Even though he was still unskilled now, as he increased his proficiency, the value would continually rise.

He made his decision.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He would break through the 7th floor just like this. He would keep going until he could maximize his proficiency. The value was more than enough.

Taesan gripped his rusty sword and moved to the next room.
