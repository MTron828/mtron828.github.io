“I decline.”

He was the first to refuse the apostle’s contract, and Pavsha promptly withdrew. Given that he probably knew of Taesan’s actions up till now, it wasn’t surprising to see him not insisting too much.

[Pavsha looks forward to your next meeting.]

Kugugung…

The darkness faded, revealing the labyrinth.

“He really just lets me go.”

Among all the gods he had met, this one was the most straightforward. Taesan quickly checked his rewards.

“I saw a strange system window earlier.”

A sentence claiming that the proficiency of all skills had increased seemed absurd. Taesan reopened the system window.

[Your 'Soul Ascension' has activated. The proficiency of all skills, excluding the 'Soul Ascension', has increased.]

“… It’s real.”

Taesan blankly stared at the message, then opened his skill window.

The information in the system window was true. The proficiency of every skill he possessed had increased.

“Wow.”

It was inconceivable.

Not just one, but all skills. Every magic spell, passive skill, activation skill, and even the black magic he barely used had increased proficiency.

The increased proficiency was about 2-3% for each skill. Individually, this might seem minuscule, but collectively, it was an astounding boost.

Currently, Taesan has around eighty skills. Simple math indicated that the total boost was close to 200%.

“This is peculiar.”

It wasn’t that he couldn’t understand. ‘Soul Ascension’ was a skill that seized his opponent’s strength. What he had defeated was the soul of Malesten, a strong warrior who had ventured deep in the labyrinth and a body no different from a clone of himself. Hence, if one considered he pilfered a little from everything Mallesten had, it made some sense.

However, even considering that, the increase was unbelievable.

Indeed, because of this surge, he had several skills that hit 100%.

[Special Constant Activation Skill: Composure] [Proficiency: 100%] [The psyche of this being has reached the brink of mortality.]

Composure. A skill he had from the very beginning had finally achieved 100%. With reaching 100%, the lengthy description was shortened to a single line.

[Composure's proficiency has reached 100%. 'Composure' has evolved into a special constantly activated skill named 'Mastery State'.] [Special Constant Activation Skill: Mastery State] [Proficiency: 1%] [An unshakable heart. Unchanging will.]

Evolution of Composure. Mastery State.

It was a skill that impacted the psyche comprehensively, and at its peak, one wouldn’t waver in any situation. While it didn’t directly influence combat, it was an incredibly essential skill.

[Special Constant Activation Skill: Death's Line ] [Proficiency: 100%] [The ability to sense the brink of death. Activates in all crises.]

Death’s Line, too, had been simplified. But it wasn’t that fascinating. A great skill to detect mortal danger, but most of the trials Taesan faced were life-threatening, rendering the skill of little value to him.

Although its proficiency had reached 100%, it had not evolved yet. Death’s Line only evolved under specific conditions.

His field of vision would soon reach 100%. The Airak martial arts skill, which had been frustratingly stagnant, had also increased by 2%.

“I’d like to receive it once more.”

Given this rate, he would have eagerly undertaken multiple trials. With a sense of regret, Taesan checked the remaining rewards.

[Proven One's Dagger] [Attack Power + 25] [A reward bestowed by the God of Proof. An exceptionally distinguished piece of equipment.]

The attack power was a whopping 25. It was 10 points higher than the weapon he had been previously equipped with.

There was no reason not to equip it. And then, the skill.

[Special Constant Activation Skill: Proven One's Soul Strike] [You have triumphed over another version of yourself. When faced with death, your soul faces Pavsha's Trial. This skill can only be used once.]

“Hm?”

Facing Pavsha’s Trial? It was a hard-to-understand description.

“Do you know what this is?”

[Eh....]

The ghost, who had been zoned out, regained its focus.

[...I don't know what the trial is, but I know the part about facing death. It's often a skill that extends one's lifespan.]

“A second life? Is that it?”

[It's very likely, yes?]

In that case, it was an excellent skill. Attack nullification, endurance, and, on top of that, the Proven One’s Soul Strike. To kill Taesan, one would have to overcome numerous challenges.

“Hmph.”

He had confirmed everything.

Taesan finished his sorting and looked at the altar. The power he felt was almost entirely gone as if its purpose had been served.

“A god’s apostle.”

A contract where the soul remains bound to a god even after death.

The ghost spoke calmly.

[Clearing the labyrinth is near impossible, even for those with talent, luck, and skill. Some among those who lose hope, give up, or fear death accept the offer of a god.]

“Why?”

Their souls became bound to a god. Taesan didn’t see any reason to accept this. The ghost replied.

[Because one's power remains intact.]

Taesan realized.

“So they don’t want to give up on what they’ve built up?”

[When you die, you lose everything. But with the apostle's contract, you can retain your sense of self even if you're forever bound to a god. Which is more painful? I can't decide for you. Malesten chose the latter.]

The ghost shrugged its shoulder-like part.

[It's not a bad deal. But it's not a good one either. So take your time to think about it. At least, I see no need to accept it.]

“I feel the same.”

At least for him, it wasn’t a good deal.

Taesan moved on.

He defeated the spirits he encountered and arrived at a secret room. He deactivated the traps and received his reward.

[Black Rune Necklace] [Defense + 5] [Magic + 3] [Strength + 10] [Intelligence + 10] [A magical necklace. The power of the rune contained within is decently useful.]

While it had lower attack power and no agility compared to the necklace he currently wore, all other stats were higher. It was worth switching, especially with the rare magic stat.

He then headed towards the boss room. The boss was an intermediate ice spirit.

It was stronger than the intermediate fire spirit but not strong enough to stop Taesan.

[You have defeated the Intermediate Ice Spirit of the labyrinth.] [Your level has increased.] [You have obtained an Icy Fragment.] [Soul Ascension has been activated.]

The Icy Fragment, like the Spirit Gem, was a refining item. He checked the reward for the 22nd floor.

[Ironrock Momentum] [A book containing the essence of Black Magic. It's sold expensively at the store.]

A Black Magic item. It was said that when you offer a related item to the Demon God, you receive Black Magic in return. However, Taesan had no intentions of making an offer yet.

‘I haven’t even fully mastered the Black Magic I’ve learned so far. There’s no need to learn more just yet.’

He knew the basic usage, but he didn’t know detailed damage assessments, affinities, or how to combine various skills. If he tried to learn more here, it could just complicate things.

He planned to sell it at the store if the price was right.

[??? was used.] [Bracelet made from Dragon-Human's skin] [Defense + 30] [Attack + 10] [A bracelet made from the peeled skin of a Dragon-Human. The tough and sharp leather will protect its owner.]

Its defense was high. Additionally, it had an attack power of 10. Clearly, the equipment quality had significantly improved past the 20th floor.

Then, he proceeded to the 23rd floor.

[Starting the 23rd Floor Quest.] [Defeat the boss of the 23rd floor and pass.] [Reward: Snake Skin Belt] [Secret Reward: ???] FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At the entrance of the 23rd floor, Taesan showed the Ironrock Scripture to the store owner.

“How much is this worth?”

“A hundred thousand gold.”

The shop owner replied after taking a quick glance.

As expected, it was priced quite high, so Taesan sold it. The shop owner received it with a slightly nervous look.

“You’re not offering it to the Demon God?”

“There’s no need to right now.”

There was still a lot to buy at the shop. With basic items ranging from tens of thousands to a hundred thousand gold, it was always good to have more funds. Taesan thought it was better to have the gold than the unpredictable Black Magic.

“If you look at it objectively, it’s probably better this way… It doesn’t really matter. Even if her space is narrow, she’s unlikely to be moved by such an item.”

The shop owner muttered as he bid Taesan farewell.

Taesan arrived on the 23rd floor.

The monster on the 23rd floor was a Wind Spirit. It moved without a tangible form, so one had to rely on senses to strike it.

Although Lee Taeyeon had a tough time properly attacking it, Taesan could handle it directly with his highly refined sensory enhancement.

He moved forward four times and to the right five times. He arrived in an ordinary empty room.

This was the place the crazed spirit had mentioned.

[You have activated Reconnaissance.]

A single brick caught Taesan’s eye. He pressed it and headed towards the revealed passageway.

The deeper he went into the corridor, the stronger the scent of mold became. It became almost unbearable to breathe halfway through.

[A human?]

A clear voice echoed. There was evident surprise in the resonating voice.

In a room resembling a tropical rainforest, a blue deer appeared.

[A Superior Wind Spirit of Mold, Kashpa, has appeared.]

“What business does a human have here?”

“I received a request from the White Spirit.”

Upon hearing Taesan’s words, Kashpa fell silent. After a moment of rustling his horns, Kashpa spoke.

[You must be talking about the deranged spirit. That pitiful thing asked you to kill me.]

A heavy sigh resonated.

[It is broken. A distorted spirit that does not possess proper intelligence. If you follow its words, you will eventually face destruction.]

Kashpa raised his horns.

[So go back, human. Return and fulfill your mission. That's what you, a human, should do.]

“Sorry, but this is my mission.”

Taesan drew his sword. The flames emanating from Calvert’s Artifact began burning the surrounding mold. Anger surged in Kashpa’s voice.

[You…] [Kashpa activated the Deer that Walks the Wind Path.]

A sharp wind emanated from the deer, extinguishing the flames.

[Contemptible human! Even after I showed mercy, you dare set fire to my land for your petty purposes!]

“Mercy?”

Taesan chuckled.

“That’s for me to grant to you, not the other way around.”

[Human.]

With a rigid voice, a rush of wind came.

[Die.]

Wind blades rushed forth. Taesan swung his sword. With a sharp sound, the wind shattered and dispersed.

“Hmm.”

Taesan began moving swiftly, and Kashpa directed blades of wind toward him. An invisible force struck the walls.

[You have activated Reconnaissance.]

Upon activating the skill, Taesan began to see the approaching wind blades one by one. He halted his movement and waved his hand, gracefully manipulating both hands to evade each blade.

[Human...]

Kashpa gritted his teeth. The wind blades were an invisible natural attack. No matter how keen one’s senses, they couldn’t be completely blocked, but Taesan defended against them as if they were visible.

[It seems you have the capability to defeat a golem created by the King. But if that's all you've got, you cannot defeat me.]

Suddenly, the wind condensed, and it fired at Taesan like a massive cannon. With absolutely no delay in the attack, Taesan wrapped his arms around his body.

Boom!

[Your first attack nullification has been activated.]

The wind exploded, causing Taesan’s body to shake violently. Using his nullification, Taesan quickly charged at Kashpa.

[Hmm!]

Seeing Taesan’s charge seemingly unaffected by the attack, Kashpa, taken aback, slightly shook his horns. A wind barrier separated Taesan and Kashpa.

Clang!

Taesan swung his sword. The barrier violently swayed but didn’t break.

‘It’s sturdy.’

[Impressive skills, but still a human's.]

With a sneer, the air burst forth. After activating his Reconnaissance skill, Taesan saw thousands, if not tens of thousands, of wind needles aimed at him.

‘Is this the spirit’s technique?’

The skill activation window, apart from the first time he used it, didn’t appear. For activated skills, a system window would pop up before activation, allowing one to respond in advance. But with the spirit’s attacks, it was completely impossible.

‘I want to learn that too.’

Taesan grinned joyfully.
