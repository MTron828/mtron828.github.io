Chapter 191: 40th Floor, The Demon Child (5)

Taesan approached Quaned, who was shaking, his eyes wide as he gripped his sword.

The ghost, discerning the intention behind his movement, quietly asked,

[Are you going to kill him?]

Theres no other way.

If someone with such talent were to grasp Taesans power and return even stronger, it could indeed be dangerous. Just as the ghost had said, letting him go was not an option.

But I think there might be a way to curse him.

[How will you do that? You're not planning to summon the Demon God, are you?]

Nothing was as certain as the existence of a god to break the Immortals contract. However, the ghost spoke in an ambiguous tone,

That would be difficult. No matter how much the Demon God pities him, the contract has already been made. The Demon God said so herself. The matters of the labyrinth are left to the beings of the labyrinth. If she intended to protect, she would have prevented the contract itself.

The Demon God was in a position of non-intervention. Taesan calling the Demon God directly would not lead to the contract being broken or nullified.

Taesan was well aware of this.

What he was considering was a different matter.

The contract with Patricia involves the soul and power.

[Right?]

The condition of the contract was to take the soul and power entirely after death.

A contract is a contract only if its conditions are fulfilled. If its shaken midway or fails to take the power entirely, then the contract is not completed.

[How would you interfere with that?]

Theres one thing, isnt there? A skill that has been of great help so far.

[Ah.]

The ghost realized which skill Taesan was referring to.

[Soul Ascension]

Taesan nodded.

Soul Ascension took power when killing an enemy. It included not only stats but also the skills that the opponent had.

It was a kind of power plundering.

Patricias contract took the power and soul. Soul Ascension also took power.

The two powers could clash, preventing the contract from being fulfilled. There was a significant possibility of that happening.

[That's]

The ghost trailed off.

Patricia was an immortal. It was about seizing power through the contract with a being far surpassing mortals.

No matter how desperately mortals struggled and tried, overcoming the power gap was impossible.

No matter how great their skill, it would be deemed inferior and rendered meaningless.

However, the ghost could not provide a definitive answer.

Taesan quietly extended his sword toward Quaned. Quaned, having apparently made up his mind, quietly closed his eyes.

The Immortals contract.

Taking power and soul with the force of a supreme being. There was no room for a mortals skill to intervene.

But with Soul Ascension.

Against the monsters of the high gods, the angels of Hamon, the followers of the forgotten goddess, the will of Harfrans destroyed world.

Despite each being related to a transcendent being higher in rank than mortals, Soul Ascension was activated.

Would it work? Would it not?

Taesan judged it would.

Taesans sword pierced through Quaneds chest. Quaneds health, already near death, dropped to 0.

Ah, ah

But Quaned did not die. He groaned, his face pale.

Something vague within him rose into the air.

Taesan knew it. That was Quaneds soul, everything he had built up until now.

The power, having lost its direction, lingered in the air.

At the same time, a massive power descended.

[Uh-]

Ugh.

The ghost involuntarily held its breath. An invisible but massive will was overseeing this place.

This will slowly began to absorb the power floating in the air. Just as all of Quaneds being was about to be engulfed and disappear into this enormity,

Power surged out from Taesans body.

The power was not vast. But without wavering, it clearly targeted Quaneds power being absorbed.

[Your level has increased.]

[Your level has increased.]

[Your level has increased.]

[Your Soul Ascension has activated. Your health has permanently increased by 854, strength by 201, agility by 134, intelligence by 102, and mana by 58.]

[Your Soul Ascension has activated. Mana proficiency has increased by 3%.]

[Your Soul Ascension has activated. You have acquired the beginner black magic [Eligors Rose Thorn].]

A portion of the power Quaned possessed was stored in Taesan.

[...It really worked.]

The ghost said with a hollow laugh.

A skill that overcame the Immortals contract and plundered power.

Soul Ascension was a skill that stood superior even to the Immortals rank.

Uh

Quaned was still not dead. Taesan looked at him with cold eyes.

Soul Ascension was not a skill that took all the opponents power. Most of the power still floated above Quaneds head.

But the enormity no longer consumed Quaneds power.

It just stood still, as if shocked by what had happened, doing nothing.

The ghost swallowed its saliva.

[This isn't entirely good news. Isn't it dangerous?]

What will happen now?

As soon as Taesan spoke, the will moved.Fiind updùíÇted ùíèovels on nùíê/v/elbin(.)co/m

The enormity first showed anger.

The very space itself began to twist with the surge of emotions. Through the distorted space, the enormous being showed its eyes.

[How dare.]

It was suffocating.

The ghosts presence flickered as if it would disappear at any moment.

It was the first time a being beyond mortal rank descended in anger directly at him.

[How dare, my possession.]

Emotion flowed heavily in the voice.

[Instant death judgment in progress]

[Instant death judgment in progress]

[Instant death judgment in progress]

The continuous attempts at an instant death judgment.

[All judgments succeeded!]

And it succeeded. Amidst the terrible pressure, Taesan laughed.

Patricia grew even angrier at that laugh.

[Insolent mortal. You dare disturb my mood because you possess something beyond your station?]

Emotions had a physical impact.

The outer walls of the labyrinth began to crack and break apart.

The eyes sparkled fiercely.

[Die.]

A gaze that could bring mortals to their death struck down.

At that moment, the bricks that made up the labyrinths floor rose. They quickly assembled to block the gaze aimed at Taesan.

[That's far enough.]

The entity, assembled like a puzzle, spoke calmly.

[You're breaking the rules, Patricia. You cannot have a direct influence.]

[...Balbabamba. The wizard's tool.]

Patricias eyes flared with intense emotion.

[How dare you block me?]

The bricks making up Balbabambas body began to scream. His body crumbled, yet Balbabambas tone remained unchanged.

[You made a contract when you entered the labyrinth. Not to directly influence mortals. I turned a blind eye to tampering with the contract, but if you rampage like this, I can't just stand by.]

[What will you do if I don't stand by? Do you think you can stop me without the wizard?]

Patricia scoffed at Balbabamba. From their conversation, Taesan could tell that the wizard was currently absent.

Balbabamba conceded Patricias point.

[I cannot. So, I must call someone who can.]

Suddenly, darkness engulfed the room.

The force trampling on Balbabamba was cleanly erased. The space, distorted by immense power, was swallowed by darkness and returned to calm.

Patricia was disturbed.

[Demon God!]

[That's enough.]

A girl with black hair appeared, laughing.

[I've been holding back, but I shouldn't interfere. Mortal matters are for mortals, don't you know?]

Patricias power was swiftly pushed back. She gritted her teeth.

[...I made a contract!]

Patricia shouted as if a child was throwing a tantrum at an adult.

[I was supposed to take power according to the contract! That worthless mortal interfered! Don't meddle!]

[If it had been a legitimate act, I wouldn't have interfered. But this is different.]

The Demon God chuckled and pointed a finger at Patricia through space.

[Your contract was for Quaned's power and soul. The entirety of it had to be transferred intact. However, Kang Taesan caused a portion of the power to escape. This means the very condition of the contract was altered.]

The Demon Gods eyes narrowed.

[Your contract is void because it didn't meet the conditions. Quaned's soul and power will gain freedom. And you're attempting to enforce it?]

[Nonsense!]

Patricia roared. Simultaneously, immense power began to repel the darkness.

The Demon God laughed as if the attempt was futile.

A silent yet colossal clash of powers ensued. Taesan did his utmost to protect himself.

This is no laughing matter.

It was a confrontation between beings beyond mortality. Had the Demon God not shielded him, the waves of power would have obliterated him countless times.

[Disappear, Patricia.]

The Demon God gestured with a hand. Darkness eagerly surged, engulfing the space. Patricia summoned her power, but the disparity in strength was overwhelming.

[If you persist here, be prepared to be trapped indefinitely.]

[You...!]

With those words, Patricias presence vanished.

The Demon God clapped her hands lightly.

[Is that all? Balbabamba.]

[Yes.]

Balbabamba expressed his thanks.

[It seems not all immortals are rational. Thank you.]

[I could descend without using my power thanks to you, so it's all good. Farewell.]

[I'll seek your assistance again in the future.]

The assembled bricks crumbled away.

After Balbabamba departed, the Demon God approached Quaned.

[Poor child.]

Demon God

Despite Taesans level increase and the activation of Soul Ascension due to Patricias contract being disrupted midway, Quaned had yet to perish.

But now his face was growing pale, and life was ebbing from him. The Demon God extended her hand to him with a gentle tone.

[Come with me. Return to me. My child.]

Yes.

Quaned smiled and accepted her hand.

His body was enveloped in darkness and vanished.

In the space where tremendously powerful beings had descended, only Taesan and the Demon God remained.

The Demon God spoke first.

[Thank you. Once a contract is made, even I can't do anything about it. So, regretfully, I gave up... but thanks to you, he was able to return to my embrace.]

Its also beneficial for me. Does this mean Patricias contract is completely shattered?

[Yes. The entire transmission of power was broken thanks to you. The Guides also didn't gain anything.]

Thats good to hear.

It really was. Just thinking about their stunned faces was enjoyable.

What will happen to him?

[He's alive. Though his soul and power were wounded.]

This was quite unexpected.

Taesan had anticipated Quaneds soul would be freed, but he hadnt known he wouldnt die. The Demon God said with a laugh.

[Probably, his power floated away in the collision process between your skill and the contract. Healing will take some time... but he may be able to return someday.]

If possible, I hope we wont be enemies then.

[That won't happen. Precisely because I will make sure of it.]

With those words, the Demon God clenched her fist.

[This is my reward to you.]

[The Demon God's interference zone has decreased.]

[You have obtained the beginner black magic [Amon's Irregular Armor].]

The Demon God chuckled.

[You received intermediate magic from Zelbando, didn't you?]

Taesan nodded. Intermediate magic. Frozen World. Its power was worth the effort.

[Soon, I might give you something similar. Come down diligently.]

I understand.

The Demon God left with those words.

Taesan finally relaxed the tension in his body.

It was finally over. And he had received a sufficient reward.

Taesan descended the floors.

[This place is getting closer to the center of the labyrinth.]

[The darkness here is thick and heavy. Most beings here exist without physical bodies and exist as spirits.]

[41st floor quest starts.]

[Defeat the boss of the 41st floor and pass through.]

[Reward: Gem of the Pitiful Soul]

[Secret Reward: ???]

41st floor.

Reading the description, it seemed that many beings related to the mind rather than the body were present.

Taesan descended the floors. Meanwhile, the Guides of Sin realized something was wrong.
