Chapter 520

520. The Eighth Return, Earth (5)

Taesan landed in front of Kim Hwi-yeon. Kim Hwi-yeon greeted Taesan with a calm face.

"Mr. Taesan."

The guardians standing next to him looked like criminals, unable to even lift their heads properly.

"It's over, I suppose."

"Yes."

Kim Hwi-yeon smiled wryly. He had expected this outcome, so he didn't feel any particular emotions.

He didn't worry about trivial matters. What was important now was that the quest had begun.

The condition was the operation of the orb. Taesan asked Akrasian.

"How do we operate it?"

"Ah……."

Akrasian seemed to want to say something to Taesan, but ultimately swallowed his words.

"……We install the orbs at a certain distance from each other, centered around the rift. Then, we offer a prayer to activate them. We just need to hold out until the orbs resonate perfectly with each other and seal the rift."

"How long will it take to seal it?"

"We don't know that part either. But it will take a considerable amount of time."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is that so."

Taesan nodded his head.

"Then let's prepare."

People started to move.

There were a total of four orbs. The location of each orb was determined to be at the east, west, south, and north ends of Greenland.

Then, it was necessary to deploy personnel accordingly. Diana, Beldegeia, Lee Tae-yeon, Amelia, Minerva, and others. They started to move strong individuals to balance the team.

And within that, the guardians did not receive any special attention.

People were very busy, but they were very lonely. Akrasian couldn't stand it anymore and asked Kim Hwi-yeon.

"Where are we supposed to go?"

"Ah."

Kim Hwi-yeon looked at Akrasian as if he had just remembered something. After a moment of thought, Kim Hwi-yeon said.

"You can go in the direction you want to go, can't you? Since you're all helpful, I'll ask for your favor."

It's good if you have it, but it's not a big deal if you don't.

That was the treatment they received.

It was very humiliating and mortifying. They still couldn't let go of their pride as those who had protected numerous worlds.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Arkashian-nim, shouldn't we say something to the Transcendent? We came to save this world, after all. Is this how we're supposed to be treated?"

Someone muttered. Arkashian didn't respond.

He had already gone to see Taesan, after all.

When we arrived in Greenland, I carefully said, "We came to save this world, so shouldn't we be treated with respect?"

Taesan's response was simple.

He just stared at him silently.

He didn't show any enthusiasm, threats, or killing intent.

He just sent a emotionless gaze.

That alone made Arkashian unable to do anything and return. It felt like he had become a reckless child who didn't know what to do.

"......I'll prove it."

Arkashian gripped his sword tightly.

"I'll prove it in this battle. Our strength isn't meant to be used against humans. It's meant to be used against the subordinates of the Divine Punishment."

In this battle, they would prove their strength. If they were going to face the subordinates of the Divine Punishment, they were far more experienced professionals. Although they lacked power, they could overwhelm them with their experience and teamwork. Arkashian still hadn't lost his faith.

They waited, harboring their ambitions in their hearts, for the monsters to appear.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And when all the arrangements were finished.

'Then I will operate.'

Akrasian sat calmly under the disk and chanted.

'Great one, we, these humble young beings, beg for your mercy.'

'Haha.'

People felt a strange sense of unease for a moment.

Something enormous that couldn't be expressed in words was descending upon this place.

Akrasian raised his hands to the sky.

'Please, banish those evil things from this world.'

The prayer reached the sky.

At the same time, the disk began to operate.

Kiiiiing!

Four pillars of light shot up from the four disks. The pillars of light, which pierced the sky, soon reached the crack.

Zzzt zzzt zzzt!

Suddenly, a ripping sound echoed. The golden light and dark energy collided, creating a massive shockwave.

'Ah…….'

People stared blankly at the scene.

The four pillars that shot up towards the sky were extremely majestic. The reverence towards the great mountain was unwavering, but even so, the scenery was awe-inspiring and felt sacred."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The orb began to operate. The crack in the sky slowly started to cover itself with a golden light.

And the gods couldn't just stand by and watch.

Kkkkkk!

The crack opened.

From the empty space, monsters started to fall.

"Ugh."

Lee Tae-yeon's hair stood on end. The scene before her was identical to what she had seen in her past life.

"Damn this life. I've come so far."

But this time was different.

Back then, she was alone, but now she wasn't alone.

[Kaaaa!] [Woooo!] [Monster 112 has appeared.] [Monster 589 has appeared.] [Monster 214 has appeared.]

"Everyone! Prepare for battle!"

Kim Hwi-yeon shouted with a determined face. People cheered and pulled out their weapons.

* * *

"Heeheehee!"

The guardians gathered together, combining their strength. They desperately wielded their weapons and used magic.

Their faces were filled with astonishment.

"This is! Unbelievable!"

[Woooo!]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A monster, as big as a house, charges at the guardians. A few guardians try to block it with their shields, but they can't withstand the monster's tackle and are sent flying.

At that moment, Akrasian leaps into action.

He quickly climbs onto the monster's body and stabs his sword into its neck.

[Woohoo!]

But the monster doesn't fall. Instead, it becomes even more ferocious. Akrasian has to stab it several more times before it finally collapses.

But there's no time to rest.

Three more monsters of the same level as the previous one fill the space where the first one fell.

[Ugh!] [Kyaaa!]

Akrasian grits his teeth.

"What is this?! These things are..."

They're too strong.

They had saved countless worlds from Gosin, defeating many monsters in the process, but monsters of this level were rarely seen, and even when they were, there were only one or two.

But here, there were too many to count.

At least a hundred. Maybe a thousand.

The number was impossible to win against, even if they all fought with their lives on the line.

"This, this is..."

"Everyone! Gather around!"

While the guardians are panicking, Kim Hwi-yeon shouts out with a calm face.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

People combined their powers. With perfect harmony and unity, they defeated powerful monsters without much difficulty.

"Whoa."

"This is better than I thought? Only three-digit monsters are coming out."

On the contrary, they were more relaxed than the guardians. It was as if they thought this was no big deal.

"……We were the ones who didn't know anything."

At this point, even Arkashian couldn't help but accept it.

The world they protected was nothing.

From the perspective of the high priests and transcendents, it was just a trivial matter.

They thought it was serious and acted as if they could do anything.

It was the moment when their overflowing confidence and arrogance were shattered.

Kuuuuuuuuung!

With the help of strong allies like Lee Tae-yeon and Amelia, they could handle the monsters without much trouble. As they were gradually getting things under control, the sky began to shake.

Thud.

"Ah."

Lee Tae-yeon looked at the crack with an ambiguous expression.

"It's here."

[Monster 9 has appeared.] [Monster 11 has appeared.] [Kaahhh!]

"Ah."

Arkashian's face turned pale.

His instincts warned him of danger.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That monster can kill them all by itself and destroy the world.

There wasn't just one of those monsters, but several were falling from the sky. When the guardians felt the fear of death, Lee Tae-yeon gathered his strength.

[You have activated the dash.]

Without backing down, he flew towards the monster. He unleashed numerous skills and swung his sword fiercely.

Whoa!

[Kuaaaaah!]

The S-grade monster stumbled back, and people cheered.

"Woohoo!"

He had pushed back the S-grade monster. It was an incredible feat in itself.

Lee Tae-yeon, who had landed on the ground with a thud, clicked his tongue.

"It's still not enough, like a mountain."

"That's already an amazing achievement. You haven't even cleared the labyrinth, but you've reached that level already."

Diana also grasped her weapon with a calm face.

The appearance of the S-grade monster.

It was their turn to use their powers. Diana, who had counted the number of monsters, muttered to herself.

"I think this should be enough."

The number of monsters wasn't that great. If they combined their strength, they could push them back without much difficulty.

"That's obvious. They're all caught up over there anyway."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"……It's amazing, isn't it?"

Diana couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.

They didn't arrange people around four orbs, but rather three.

The reason was simple.

One orb was solely responsible for carrying the weight of Taesan.

The transcendent one. The great and lofty realm.

What one could do after reaching that realm was unfolding on the other side.

* * *

[Woohoo!]

Monsters rushed to destroy the orbs.

[Monster 1 appeared.] [Monster 2 appeared.] [Monster 3 appeared.]

Multiple S-grade monsters charged at once.

And Taesan, without any change in expression, simply kicked his foot.

Wham.

An S-grade monster was kicked away. With a sound of air bursting, the S-grade monster flew away, leaving the continent of Greenland, crossing the sea, and landing on the other continent.

With a nonchalant, light kick, Taesan had traversed the continent.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No need to use skills, magic, dark magic, or divine power. Just move your body and knock down all the S-grade monsters. It didn't take even a few minutes to clean them up.

"'You think you can stop me with just this?'"

The S-grade monster couldn't even buy time. Taesan looked up at the sky.

"Kuuuuuuung!"

A crack opened, and one of the monsters fell.

People felt a sudden chill.

They could sense that something distorted had descended upon this world.

"I'm here."

Taesan gazed calmly at the monster.

[3%!#!! appeared.]

The appearance of the apostle.

The ground beneath their feet couldn't withstand the sense of discomfort and began to distort. Space began to collapse, and all things began to crumble.

"Nice to meet you."

Taesan had expected the apostle's appearance from the start, so they didn't feel surprised or tense.

Instead, they felt pleased.

"I've been wanting to test something against an apostle-level opponent."

Taesan took a step forward.

The apostle responded by moving. With just that simple movement, a crater formed on the ground, and the entire continent of Greenland began to shake.

"Kugugugugung!"

The apostle wielded black energy to pressure Taesan. Taesan lightly wielded divine power, and the black energy was completely incinerated.

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ku-gu-gu-gung!"

Taesan arrives in front of Sado in an instant.

Sado tries to defend himself by moving his body. Taesan lightly raises his finger.

"Block it."

[You activated addition.] [You activated multiplication.]

Taesan's finger touches Sado's head.

And in that moment, Sado's head distorts.

[Dealt 4,411,882,084 damage to 3%!#!!]

Note: It appears to be a passage from a fantasy or game-like scenario, with Taesan and Sado being characters, and the use of game-like mechanics such as activating abilities and dealing damage.
