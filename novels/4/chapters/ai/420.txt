Chapter 421

421. 83rd Floor, the Essence of Falling God (3)

Instead of answering Taesan's words, they charged at him again.

Kiying!

Light enveloped them. Taesan easily knew what it was.

It was a labyrinth skill.

Each of them activated their skills and pressured Taesan. Taesan responded accordingly.

[You activated Baal's Dark Space Slash.]

Tzok.

The space turned dark.

The man who was charging suddenly felt a chill. The darkening space spread rapidly and engulfed them.

Kwagaga!

The space, now turned dark, rushed in all directions.

It crushed everything in its path, destroying all obstacles. Those who were charging tried to defend themselves with their skills, but it was no use.

They were buried in the space itself.

Kukuku...

The dark space that had spread out disappeared, leaving only one man, known as the captain, behind.

"......Huh!"

The man spat out a breath and sat down, stunned. There were no visible injuries on his body. Taesan was slightly surprised.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I've blocked it perfectly."

The dark space's encroachment was not as powerful as a great collapse, but it had the power to easily surpass intermediate-level magic. The existence of the mortal was a force that was almost impossible to block.

However, the man in front of him had exhausted all his strength but still managed to defend himself.

The man, realizing that he was the only one left, let out a dry laugh.

"A monster-like newbie has arrived."

"You're an adventurer of the labyrinth, aren't you?"

I had suspected it from the moment I saw him wearing familiar equipment, but seeing him activate his skill confirmed it. For some reason, the activation window didn't appear, but that was definitely a labyrinth skill.

The man nodded.

"Not everyone is like that, but most are."

"What are you doing here?"

"......I don't want to say it out loud."

"Why not?"

"It's embarrassing, that's all."

The man raised his sword with a trembling hand.

"It doesn't matter anyway. The busybody will show up soon."

The man charged at Taesan.

Taesan drew his sword.

Clang.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan lightly defended himself and pierced the man's chest.

The man was dying, but his expression showed no fear or pain.

"I didn't know I was going to die at the hands of a newbie..."

The man left those words behind and vanished.

Taesan saw the man's soul flowing into a certain part of the model garden.

Taesan gazed in that direction for a moment, then took a step forward.

No matter how far he walked, the plain seemed endless. It was as if he was seeing the same scenery repeated over and over, like a copy.

"There's no death, I said."

Here, death is not the end.

Perhaps it's a story of revival. After all, these souls are bound to Essence, so it's not strange.

However, actions have purposes.

This is the model garden, a place where souls bound to the God of Fall are trapped.

What was the God of Fall trying to achieve by creating this place? It was still unknown.

"Perhaps this is related."

Taesan looked up and gazed at the space above his eyes. A white window appeared there.

[Point: 5]

When he first arrived, it was 0. It increased to 5 points as he defeated five.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It seemed like a structure where you get points every time you defeat one.

There was no reason for the points to exist. Taesan, who continued to think, felt eight popular sensations approaching him.

"Well done."

He would hear the story from them. Taesan stopped walking.

"Are you a newcomer? Sorry about that. But it's not a bad story for you either."

The people who approached were not much different from the first ones Taesan had met.

They wore equipment similar to that of a labyrinth adventurer and did not show any hostility or greed towards Taesan. They just looked tired.

"You guys will answer, right?"

Taesan said so and was about to draw his sword.

"Stop!!"

"Kkkk!"

"Ugh!"

A loud voice thundered.

The sound was like directly stimulating their brains, and they covered their heads. The man who had spoken to Taesan first contorted his face.

"Has it already appeared?"

"I'm here!"

The owner of the voice rushed over at high speed. She landed beautifully between Taesan and the others, her feet pounding the ground."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Her golden hair fluttered. Her golden eyes shone like jewels.

"Hmm, tired."

It seemed like she had run from far away, and she let out a small sigh, looking a bit exhausted.

But despite that, she couldn't hide her dignity.

From birth, she had an air of nobility about her.

The man spoke bluntly:

"Are you here to bother me again? Golden Princess."

Taesan, who saw the woman, quietly admired her.

'Strong.'

Taesan had met many adventurers in the model garden, but she was the strongest. Even if Taesan attacked her with all his might, she wouldn't fall easily. She had the power to reach the realm of immortality with just one step.

The woman called the Golden Princess nodded confidently.

"He must be a newbie. I'll take care of his education for a while."

"You're still too nosy. You'll naturally learn as you experience it a few times."

"But if someone teaches you, you'll learn without having to go through the pain."

The Golden Princess spoke gently.

"What a troublesome woman."

The man clicked his tongue.

"Where did that old man who always followed you go?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'm here."

The old man walked slowly, carrying a long sword in his hand.

"Our princess always puts actions before words. It's hard to keep up with her."

"I'm sorry."

"That's what you've been saying for a while now. I've given up, so it doesn't matter."

The old man, who seemed to be a companion of the Golden Princess, was not caught off guard, but was certainly stronger than the others.

"I have a bad feeling about this. There's no chance of winning."

The opponent spoke calmly, but they didn't back down. All eight of them drew their weapons.

"Let me ask, how many are left?"

"If I defeat you, I think I'll be fine."

"Good luck."

The man grinned, showing his teeth.

The battle began.

* * *

"Hello?"

The Golden Princess smiled brightly, looking at Taesan.

"What's your name?"

"I'm Kang Taesan."

"Kang Taesan! That's a unique name. I'm Diana!"

"I'm Reynald," said the old man behind them.

The battle ended in an instant.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The golden princess was standing at the boundary. On the other hand, her opponent was unable to cross the boundary. The fundamental difference in their powers was enormous.

However, the faces of those who had fallen were not dark.

Rather, they were smiling satisfactorily.

Diana handed Taesan a dried meat strip.

"Would you like to eat it? It's a precious food that's almost gone. There's no hunger here, but putting something in your mouth is meaningful in itself."

"It's okay."

"Oh, I see."

Diana put the meat strip in her mouth. The movement was casual, but each action had dignity.

"Let me ask you again. Are you an adventurer who came down from the labyrinth?"

Taesan nodded. Diana's eyes sparkled.

"Then, perhaps..."

She was about to ask Taesan something.

But the words didn't continue. After thinking for a while, she closed her mouth with a bitter smile.

"No, there's no need to confirm it already. I'll save it for later enjoyment."

She made up her own mind.

Taesan, who had been watching her for a moment, opened his mouth.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Why did you bring me here?"

"I'm telling you this information about this place because I have to. I'm not interested, but the princess can't just leave someone like you alone."

"It's only natural. Well, think of it as self-satisfaction and just listen."

Diana continued speaking softly.

"Coming here means that Mr. Taesan was also used by the God of Falling, doesn't it? It's unfortunate. We all sympathize with you because we were deceived by him too."

Taesan was standing closer to the entrance, but he quietly listened to Diana's words.

"You must have guessed, but this is a place where people like you, who were used by the God of Falling, gather. It's a model garden created for his entertainment."

Diana raised her finger.

"First of all, there is no concept of death here. If someone dies and disappears, they will revive at a specific location after a day has passed."

"Is it impossible to die by any means?"

"Yes. There was even someone who turned their entire body into dust as an experiment, but they revived with terrible pain."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They cannot die. They had to live forever in this place.

The princess raised her finger and pointed to the horizon.

All that could be seen was a vast, empty plain.

"As you can see, there's nothing in this model garden. The technicians gathered to invent something, but it all ended in failure and disappeared."

Change was not allowed.

"The only entertainment is to fight each other to the death, but according to the rules of the God of Decline, once a battle begins, you must fight with all your might until you die. And the pain of revival is not trivial."

"You're a cruel god, indeed."

Raynard clicked his tongue.

Taesan asked them,

"How long have you been here?"

"I don't know. I forgot how to count a long time ago."

"I don't know either. It feels like hundreds of years have passed, but I don't know any more than that."

They spoke indifferently.

It was a world where nothing was allowed, a world of stagnant silence.

They cannot die. Change is not allowed. They cannot even control their own battles.

This place was a vast prison.

"I guess that's why there was no hostility towards me."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not like everyone fights because they want to. Even if they're in the same situation, venting their resentment and anger is meaningless.

They were all victims.

There was only one enemy. The god of downfall.

But as I listened to the story, there were parts that didn't make sense.

"Then why did they try to kill me?"

According to Diana's words, the battle here has no meaning beyond mere entertainment. There was no reason to kill the newly arrived Taesan.

"And you're not desperate enough to do that."

This place is terrifying. Nothing changes, nothing is allowed, and you can't escape death.

But despite that, the people Taesan met were surprisingly mentally healthy.

They looked tired and exhausted, but they had a clear sense of reason and were acting accordingly. They didn't seem like people who had suffered for hundreds or thousands of years.

"The reason is simple. Either it's a simple transformation, or we find it more enjoyable to maintain our sanity, so we've created a few convenient facilities."

Diana smiled wryly."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I said I'd revive at a specific place after I died, right? That place is a huge village. It's a place created by the God of Fall. There, people can eat humble food and sleep on hard beds. There are also simple entertainments."

At least the minimum living facilities existed.

"Most importantly, there's a point system. You must have noticed, but a system window with points written on it appears above our eyes. Every time we kill someone, we get 1 point. There are several ways to use these points."

The uses of points were not hard to predict.

"Temporary strengthening of convenience facilities."

"That's correct."

Diana nodded her head.

"If you use 1 point for a meal, you can change from a bland soup to a delicious steak. If you use it for a room, you can stay in a room with a soft bed and shower facilities for a day, instead of a room with a hard bed. The more points you use at once, the better the facilities become."

"So, you were trying to kill me to get points."

It was all about getting points to enjoy food and lodging, a form of entertainment.

"It's an obvious trick, but it's certain. Most people rely on it and somehow manage to keep their spirits up."

"That's disgusting."

"That's really true."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Mortals with exceptional talents, who had the potential to clear the labyrinth and surpass the depths, killed each other for food and shelter. And they relied on their spirits to endure.

It was a system that could be understood as the god of downfall creating this place for a reason.

"But that's not all."

Although it was a system that could maintain their spirits, it had its limits. There was no hope whatsoever.

However, among the people Diana met in this place, including herself, there was a glimmer of hope.

The hope of being able to escape this place.

Diana smiled faintly.

"You're lucky. You've only just arrived, and you'll be able to return to the world outside soon."

"Return?"

"It's better to see it for yourself. Let's go, Reynald."

"Right now? Do we not need to practice?"

"It doesn't matter. I've already practiced thousands of times for this day."

Diana grasped her sword with gleaming eyes.

"Follow me. I'll save you."

Taesan followed behind her.

They walked across the plain. Meanwhile, others appeared and blocked Diana's path.

Diana only said one thing to them.

"I've gathered everything."

"......Hmph."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With just one word, all those who had been blocking the way laid down their weapons.

And they began to follow Diana.

The crowd gathered and grew, and before long, a group of hundreds had formed.

Diana, standing at the forefront, walked confidently.

"I told you there were several ways to use the point, didn't I? This is one of them."

And she arrived at the center of the plain.

There was a single pillar there. Diana shouted towards the pillar.

"God of Descent! Princess of the ruined world! I, who have been deceived, have come to this place!"

Kugugugung!

The pillar began to operate.

The gaze of the God of Descent appeared.

Diana opened her mouth with shining eyes.

"I have fulfilled your conditions! So I request it! The Colosseum for liberation!"
