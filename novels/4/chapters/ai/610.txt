**Episode 611**

611. Easy Mode. Fifth Return (5)

The wolf charges. Its movement is extremely fast. Kim Hee-jae alone cannot handle its speed and power.

But Taesan doesn't move.

He gazes at the wolf as if observing it.

And when the wolf approaches, Taesan moves.

Just a little, his foot takes a half-step back.

The wolf's claw brushes against Taesan's hair.

[Gasp!]

The wolf howls. This time, it tries to bite Taesan's neck with its teeth. Taesan waits until the last moment, just like before, and lightly twists his neck.

The teeth scrape through the air.

The wolf attacks with all its might, as if going berserk. Each attack is extremely powerful, and it would take multiple people in Easy Mode to block them.

Taesan dodges all the attacks with minimal movement, as if taking a stroll.

"What, what is this?"

Kim Hee-jae, who was watching, is shocked. No, "shocked" doesn't even begin to describe it.

An extreme evasion.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was as if the wolf and Taesan's movements were perfectly synchronized, like a dance.

The evasion continued, and continued. Kim Hee-jae couldn't see Taesan as human anymore. He was far more inhumane than the hard mode players he had seen before, or even the Alone mode's Lee Tae-yeon.

"What... this feeling."

Taesan, who had been dodging, thrust his sword into the wolf's neck. The wolf let out a scream and collapsed.

Kim Hee-jae stuttered and asked,

"...... What are you doing?"

"Acquiring a skill."

"Acquiring a skill?"

It was an entirely unexpected answer.

Taesan explained slowly.

And after listening to the explanation, Kim Hee-jae's face became even more bewildered.

"I don't understand."

"Want me to explain again?"

"No, I understand, but I don't understand."

Kim Hee-jae stuttered and said,

"...... So, skills are obtained depending on how you tackle the labyrinth, right?"

Taesan nodded.

Kim Hee-jae's mind became even more confused.

"So, you're saying... you're going to obtain that skill artificially?"

"You understand well."

"No, I don't understand at all."

"Why? It's simple, isn't it?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It doesn't seem simple at all."

Kim Hee-jae barely calmed down his confusion.

"......There's a possibility."

He slowly analyzed Taesan's words and realized that they were very reasonable.

The Labyrinth's Skill.

Although they didn't know exactly how to acquire it, they knew that it was obtained during the process of descending into the labyrinth.

Then, what if they could obtain such a skill artificially, aiming for the skill they wanted?

It would be a tremendous power.

However, that was a separate matter from what Taesan was doing now.

"So, you're saying you can dodge a wolf's attack by a single sheet of paper for several hours?"

"It's not even an hour yet. I need to try harder to get the skill."

"What's with this again."

Kim Hee-jae looked at Taesan with a bewildered expression.

"Can you really get a skill with that?"

"I don't know."

Taesan shook his head.

His intuition told him it was possible, but it was just an intuition. He didn't know if it would actually work.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But the possibility is sufficient. I actually got a skill like this."

"What? What skill?"

"Breath-holding."

Taesan explained about the skill. Kim Hee-jae's eyes sparkled.

"That's... a pretty good skill, isn't it?"

It's a skill that allows you to hold your breath for a long time. It's simple but very effective. Basically, during combat, it's not the physical fatigue that's the problem, but rather the breathing issue that makes you tired quickly.

"How did you get it?"

"I submerged my body in water and almost died."

"...... almost died?"

"Yeah. Really almost died. I don't know how to explain it."

Taesan thought for a moment and said lightly.

"I guess this is it. Don't try to get the skill until you're told how to acquire it."

"......"

Kim Hee-jae thought he wasn't that smart, but even just listening to Taesan's explanation made him realize how difficult it was.

"How many minutes did you hold your breath?"

"I don't know. Maybe 6 minutes?"

How many minutes could Kim Hee-jae hold his breath?

He remembered that his longest record was 2 minutes.

A skill that can only be obtained by truly holding your breath until you're on the verge of death.

Kim Hee-jae shook his head.

"Yeah... I got it."

"It's okay, so let's try it once. The acquisition conditions aren't that difficult either."

"Got it. Got it."

Kim Hee-jae brushed off Taesan's words. Trying it out wasn't that hard, so he thought he'd give it a shot. Whether he'd get it or not was unknown.

"What can you get from what you're doing now?"

"I don't know. It might be a waste of time, or it might be valuable."

Taesan had been here for a few months for the sake of that unknown possibility. Kim Hee-jae asked with a tired face.

"...Do you have to go that far?"

It was like a kind of ascetic practice. Continuing to avoid it with just one sheet of paper was unimaginable. The amount of mental energy being consumed was also incalculable.

Taesan said.

"We're in easy mode, after all."

"...Easy mode, huh."

"There's a limit to getting stronger. Even if you clear the labyrinth, it won't be much different from now. To get stronger, you need the power to surpass the line."

Easy mode referred to the power to surpass the line.

"Then I should also try to surpass the line."

"Calm words. There was no fatigue or pride. It was just a feeling of doing what was necessary.

Kim Hee-jae, who was staring blankly at Taesan, muttered.

"You're amazing too."

"It's not that amazing. I'm just doing what I need to do to survive."

"That's what's amazing about it."

Kim Hee-jae shook his head. When people see endless despair, they give up and accept it. Their minds can't take it and collapse.

But Taesan was different. Even in despair, he was getting stronger and finding ways to overcome it.

Taesan is amazing. Even in hard mode, alone mode, he would have stood out.

"If it were you... you'd definitely be able to do it."

Kim Hee-jae said quietly. He clenched his fist.

"When we're all dead later, take revenge for us. Create a hellish place and invade the Earth for those bastards who did this."

"Let's try."

Taesan clenched his fist in response.

Kim Hee-jae and the other easy mode players went down.

Taesan moved to a different channel and continued to fight the wolf.

A month passed, two months passed."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

As he passes by, the number of players in easy mode increases. Although he was once ahead of everyone, he has started to fall behind, but Taesan doesn't care.

"Phew."

He takes a deep breath, adjusts his physical muscles, and opens the door. He dodges the wolf that's charging at him.

And the moment he successfully dodges for the first time, Taesan realizes.

Today is a good day.

Since he has to make extreme dodges, his daily condition is crucial. And Taesan realizes that today is the best condition he's had in the past four months.

It's possible.

With a strange sense of foreboding, he continues to dodge. Even more narrowly, the wind from the wolf's claws brushes against his eyes.

The dodging continues. It's even more intense than before. After about two hours, the wolf gets tired. Taesan closes his eyes and waits calmly for the wolf to recover.

As Taesan closes his eyes, the wolf slowly approaches him, trying to bite his neck like a leopard.

Taesan turns his body without opening his eyes. The wolf's teeth clash with a loud sound.

[Cr, Krllng.]

The wolf is taken aback.

No matter what it does, it can't reach him.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It felt like I was facing a balloon. The monster, designed to kill adventurers, began to feel certain that it couldn't kill the adventurer in front of it.

But the wolf didn't give up. According to its given mission, it charged towards the mountain.

The mountain welcomed it with open arms.

The wolf's claws tore through the air, and its teeth clashed with each other. The mountain didn't back down from the wolf for even a second.

Like that, three hours passed, and four hours passed.

The wolf grew tired and fell asleep. The mountain waited quietly beside it.

When the wolf woke up, it saw the mountain watching it from the side and was shocked, keeping its distance.

The mountain moved on its own and approached the wolf.

[Rrraaahh!]

The wolf's howl was now close to a scream.

It kept running away and running away.

And a whole day passed.

[Rrraaahh...].

The wolf, seemingly exhausted, swung its claws. Its speed was slow and weak, like a child's, and could be easily dodged. The mountain lightly stepped aside.

And in that moment.

A flashy system window appeared.

[You have successfully dodged your opponent's attacks at very close range for over a day. You have acquired the special skill [Untouchable Distance].]"

"It is the one and only truth that tells you that Taesan's actions are correct and that your choice was right.

A smile spread across Taesan's face."
