Chapter 442

442. 86th Floor, The World of the Sword (4)

[...Even if you say that, becoming a sword isn't exactly an attractive proposition.]

"Of course, your senses and such will change. After all, you'll be reborn as a sword, not human. But your self-awareness and free will won't disappear."

[How can I trust you not to pull something off in the middle?]

"I, Kosrun. I'll stake everything I've built and my desires on it, and I won't impose any restrictions on you."

Kosrun declared immediately.

"If I break my declaration, I'll suffer eternal pain without achieving anything I desire."

It was a declaration that put his own name on the line. With this, the possibility of Kosrun pulling something off also disappeared.

[...This is ridiculous.]

There was nothing more to say. The problem had disappeared, leaving only the ghost's choice.

[My head hurts.]

The ghost was confused.

He couldn't make a decision easily.

[Just give me some time.]

"Take it easy."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Cosrun didn't force it.

"Then, think calmly and slowly. I'll be doing something else, so make a decision and let me know."

Only Taesan and the ghost were left in the cave.

[What should I do.]

I thought everything was over, but suddenly a new option was given.

The ghost calmed down and analyzed the conditions coolly.

[Is it becoming a sword?]

It's not a living, breathing body, but a sword.

It was a story that felt extremely repulsive, but after hearing Cosrun's explanation, it wasn't as terrible as I thought.

As a sword, he could act freely. It was just a matter of changing the vessel that held his soul.

Of course, there were clear disadvantages. He could no longer feel the warmth of life. It was also difficult to empathize with others or share deep emotional connections with someone.

And it was uncertain whether Cosrun would succeed. It seemed like he was trying to make a soul into a weapon for the first time, so it wasn't surprising if any problems arose.

But I could live again."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I was able to have a conversation with someone, experience new things, and become stronger.

Perhaps I could have fulfilled his wish as a sword.

Both the advantages and disadvantages were clear, so the ghost couldn't make a decision easily.

[What should I do?]

In the end, the ghost asked Taesan.

"You can't give me the right to decide. This is something you have to choose yourself."

The ghost's future shouldn't be changed by someone else's interference. The ghost also agreed.

[That's right. In the end, I'm the one who has to make the decision.]

"But..."

Taesan closed his mouth.

The ghost waited for his words.

After a while, Taesan spoke.

"I think it's better for you to live as a sword."

[...Is that so.]

The ghost smiled slightly, as if he had let go of something.

[I've made my decision. I might regret it someday... but it's my choice. I'll take responsibility.]

Taesan called out to Coslun.

Coslun waited for the ghost's answer with an expectant face.

[I accept. Dwarf.]

"Good! I won't let you regret it absolutely!"

* * *

[So what should I do?]"

Note: The text appears to be a dialogue-heavy passage from a fantasy novel or game, with a ghost character contemplating their future and seeking advice from someone named Taesan. The conversation revolves around the ghost's decision to become a sword or not, and the implications of that choice.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We need to make a real soul into a sword. It's something I've never heard of before. It's not hard to imagine how difficult it would be. Even Koslun, who was usually cheerful, had an uncertain face.

"I've got a rough idea, but this is the first time I'm actually putting a soul into a sword, so I need to do some experiments. How much time do we have left?"

[About... a week is left. If that time passes, I'll have to leave.]

"A week, huh. It's tight."

Koslun furrowed his brow and quickly thought.

"First, we need a weapon that has a connection with you, rather than making a new one. Since we're going to use the sword as a vessel, the basic compatibility needs to be good. Can you get the sword you used when you were alive?"

[That's not easy. Taesan.]

Taesan took out the relic of Kabert.

It was the sword that Kabert had used before entering the labyrinth, and had kept with him until his death. Koslun's eyes sparkled as he received the relic.

"I can feel a strong connection between you and the sword. This is enough. It's overflowing. I'll hold onto it for a while."

Koslun, who had taken possession of the relic, spoke again.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And we need a huge vessel of will. We need to create a space to hold the soul in the sword. The weapons here don't have enough will, so... I'll gather all the weapons and organize them for now."

"I don't think that's necessary."

Taesan pulled out a fragment of will from his inventory.

Kosrun's pupils grew larger.

"This is it."

"A fragment of the world's will. This should be enough, right?"

"More than enough."

Kosrun let out a dry laugh.

"With this, the vessel will be sufficient. Where did you get this material from...?"

"And it would be great if we had this too."

Taesan also showed Kosrun the relics of Bardley. Kosrun let out a whistle.

"I can feel a strong connection to the soul. In theory, one sword is enough, but the more we have, the higher the success rate."

Kosrun smiled in satisfaction.

"Perfect. With this, there's almost no problem."

It seemed like everything was prepared from the start, and each condition was being met one by one.

"We've got the basic materials. Now, let's get a feel for it. Adventurer, bring as many weapons as possible from outside the cave. Crush the will, I mean."

"How many?"

"As many as possible. Up to your ability."

Kosrun smiled slyly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It seems like I'll need a lot of them."

Taesan nodded and stepped outside.

He intended to grant Kosrun's request to the fullest extent.

Standing on the vast land filled with countless weapons, he raised his hand.

"Gather."

[You have activated the Declaration of Gathering.]

Ka-ga-gak!

The weapons all flew towards Taesan at once. Although they resisted with their own will, opposing the situation, the declaration crushed all of their resistance and gathered them into Taesan's hand.

Taesan declared again.

"Surrender."

[You have activated the Declaration of Surrender.]

There was no need to reveal his power or suppress them.

Just one sentence was enough.

The declaration imbued with willpower was etched into the world. The weapons all ceased their resistance and surrendered to Taesan.

Taesan continued to move forward without stopping.

In less than an hour, he had gathered over hundreds of weapons.

"Is this enough?"

"......For now, it's sufficient."

Kosrun spoke with a dazed expression.

"I didn't think you'd bring this many......"

"Did I not tell you to bring as many as possible?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No. That's how it was, but it's amazing. Whatever. Thanks to that, it's possible to do it much faster."

Cosrun took hundreds of weapons and entered the cave.

* * *

Cosrun continued to experiment with something.

He merged the weapons, refined them, and extracted the will within them.

Taesan, an outsider, couldn't understand exactly what was happening, but he could sense that it was an extremely difficult process. Every time Cosrun refined a weapon, his eyes would sink and his cheeks would hollow out.

But Cosrun looked incredibly happy.

Even as his body was pushed to its limits, he didn't stop working. In just two days, he had used up all the weapons Taesan had brought.

"Will it do?"

"I've got a grasp on it, but there are still many lacking parts. I need more. Bring me more, not just this much, but even more than this."

Taesan readily agreed.

Just like before, he quickly brought more weapons.

And Cosrun used them all up and asked Taesan for new weapons again.

The countless weapons that had been piled up began to disappear. Now, they had to go far away to obtain new weapons.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

During that process, Taesan's only task was to retrieve the weapon.

While Cosrun was conducting various experiments with the weapon, time was passing idly. It was a moment of leisure.

So, Taesan spent that time chatting with the ghost.

They didn't have a grand conversation. The ghost talked about when it first met Levancia, when it obtained the artifact of Kabert, and what kind of experiences it had while growing up - just small talk.

Taesan also shared stories about his life on Earth. He talked about what he did before entering the labyrinth and what kind of life he lived, mostly just casual conversations about everyday life.

And after 10 days had passed.

"It's roughly organized now," Cosrun said with a pleased face.

"But there's still one thing missing. The last remaining material. The quest reward for this floor. The Ego Soul. Bring that to me."

Taesan agreed.

He quickly rushed to the location where the king's sword was situated, which he had already scouted out.

There, a magnificent, ornate sword was stuck in the rock, shining alone.

Ka-ga-gak!

The king's sword was pulled out.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Unlike other weapons, there was no intention to spare or hold back.

Only a strong will to test Taesan was visible.

The king's sword moved. Gathering all the power within, it swung down with full force.

The power turned into a sword aura and flew towards Taesan.

Taesan raised his sword to counterattack.

Kwaaaang!

The battle had begun.

The king's sword moved on its own, pressing down on Taesan without a master. The power within was at the extreme of mortality, surpassing immortality.

For Taesan, it was not a big deal. He had already reached immortality.

But for Lee Tae-yeon, it would be different.

Surviving was the priority, rather than submitting to the king's sword.

'I've overcome this.'

The quest condition was to submit the king's sword. It was hard to think that a shortcut would be allowed, considering the energy felt from the king's sword.

It meant that she had cleared the 100th floor solely with her own abilities.

She was definitely an amazing person.

'I'll go back to Earth and ask her how she did it.'

Taesan organized his thoughts and focused on the battle.

Kaang!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With a surge of power, I swung my sword greatly. The king's sword couldn't withstand it and was pushed back with a clattering sound.

Since there was a fundamental difference in our skills, it was difficult to obtain any special training or skills, so there was no need to hold back. Taesan quickly subdued the king's sword, grasping the hilt and pinning it to the ground.

And then, I put my sword away.

For a moment, the king's sword trembled as if struggling, but it didn't last long. The slowly building power subsided. The king's sword was quietly held in Taesan's hand.

[You have subjugated the king's sword.] [86th floor cleared.] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [You have obtained an Ego Soul.] [You have obtained???.] [Ego Soul] [An artificially created vessel for the soul. It is empty and can be filled with something.] [You have used???.] [You have obtained the King's Formel.] [King's Formel] [Strength + 200] [Agility + 200] [Attack power + 200] [Defense + 200] [The Formel of the sword wielded by the king of the world. It can be attached to any sword.] [It perfectly complements the balance of the sword.]

I cleared the 86th floor."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan took the Ego Soul and returned to Coslun. Coslun welcomed Taesan with a smile.

"Just wait a little, just a little longer. I'll tidy up and come back soon."

Coslun took the Ego Soul and entered his own space.

And two days later.

"It's done."

Coslun returned.

All preparations to turn the ghost into a sword were complete.

"Then let's start right away. Are you ready?"

[Yes.]

The ghost replied calmly.
