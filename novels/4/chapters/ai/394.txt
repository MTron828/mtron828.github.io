Chapter 395

395. The 79th Floor, the Struggle Floor (1)

[Congratulations.]

As soon as I returned to the labyrinth, I heard a voice calling out to me. Taesan knew whose voice it was right away.

"Ma'am Witch."

The green witch. She was the one speaking to Taesan.

[You've already reached the same level as me... You're really fast. It's not a bad story for me, but somehow it's a bit disappointing.]

She shared her vision with Taesan through their contract. As Taesan grew stronger and gained new powers, she got closer to her goal with each battle against stronger enemies. There was nothing bad about Taesan getting stronger.

However, she had been stuck as an immortal for her entire life.

It was an immeasurable amount of time. But Taesan had reached immortality in just a fleeting moment. She couldn't help but feel a little jealous.

[Still... it's not a bad story. The more you grow stronger, the higher the possibility that you'll discover the path to transcendence.]

The witch's voice was slightly tinged with envy.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What will you become? Will you stop at immortality like me? Or will you transcend like the gods and reach the realm of the transcendent? I'll keep watching."

With those words, the witch's voice disappeared.

The witch wanted to find a way to become a transcendent being. That's why she made a contract with Taesan.

However, he was walking a path that was completely different from both ordinary immortals and transcendent beings.

Taesan couldn't tell if he would be of any help to the witch.

He opened a community. The people who had survived and returned from the labyrinth were noisily chatting.

[Oliver Kan[Hard]: What's the situation like in Asia and Europe?] [Daniel Darmon[Hard]: We're fine. We had a tough time joining forces with Africa, but there were no major issues.] [Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard]: We're also fine. To be honest, there were some problems, but... thanks to Taesan, we made it through.] [Amelia Eirin[Ellon]: I felt something terrible even from across the ocean. Was it really okay?] [Lee Tae-yeon[Ellon]: It's fine. There weren't many deaths, and it was within our expected range. There were no major issues.]

Lee Tae-yeon calmly left a comment. Amelia looked at her with a puzzled expression and asked.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Amelia Airin[Alone]: It feels like something's changed. What happened?]
[Kang Joon-hyuk[Alone]: We finished all the quests and something changed. Did you hear something from Taesan-hyung?]

Amelia and Kang Joon-hyuk, who were in the same Alone mode, had shared many conversations before. As a result, they immediately noticed that Taesan had changed.

[Taesan[Alone]: Well, something happened.]

Taesan brushed it off. Amelia seemed curious, but didn't press the issue further.

Taesan had regained his memories from his past life.

He would descend into the labyrinth at a different pace and method from now on.

Taesan, who had glanced at the community, soon began to check his points.

5,800 points. It was an enormous amount of points. The way to use them was, of course, to master skills, but he was worried about how to use them effectively.

"There's no way to use them on soul skills."

Additionally, skills above a certain level couldn't be used properly.

He also thought about using them for magic or dark magic, but as the types of skills increased, their efficiency decreased.

After a moment of deliberation, Taesan made a decision.

"I'll put it off for later."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was no need to use the points right away. It was better to hold onto them until I acquired a suitable skill, and then use them on that.

There were many skills to be acquired. Advanced magic, and now I could even make a direct contract with a demon using Lemegaton. It seemed like a good idea to use the points on the skills I acquired from there.

Taesan made up his mind and moved his body.

He was still on the 78th floor, in the library of Manas.

He headed deeper into the library.

* * *

The first person to notice him was the librarian, Horhe. He closed the book he was reading and looked at Taesan.

"You've been away for a long time. Where did you go?"

As he spoke, Horhe gazed at Taesan.

And then he shut his mouth.

He stared at Taesan with a puzzled expression, his face scrunched up.

"......Did you reach it?"

"That's right."

"What have you done."

A crack spread across Horhe's face.

"How did you manage to do it so quickly......"

He let out a sigh.

Even Horhe, who had accumulated vast knowledge as the librarian of Manas' library, couldn't help but be shocked by Taesan's current achievement.

"This is unbelievable."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

In the end, the words he spat out were all there was. Greed and desire flickered across Jorge's face.

He was the administrator of the repository, a servant of the God of Knowledge who sought endless knowledge.

The existence of Taesan was stimulating his thirst for knowledge.

However, Jorge couldn't take any further action. It was because he didn't have the authority to do so.

In the end, Jorge could only savor the taste.

"At this point, I'm slightly resentful of Metis. What should I do? Should I go down now or stay here a little longer?"

"I think I'll stay a bit longer."

"Do as you please."

Even as he said that, Jorge couldn't tear his gaze away from Taesan.

Taesan's eyes seemed to say that as long as he was here, he would observe everything about Jorge. Taesan didn't mind and went to find Ainshar.

"Wow!"

Ainshar, who saw Taesan, let out a cry of surprise first.

"You've arrived. I saw the possibility, but how did you get here so quickly...?"

"I used a bit of a shortcut."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A place reached not by one's own power, but by faith. It could be called a shortcut. Ainzhahr laughed heartily, understanding the meaning behind Taesan's words.

"'Is there a shortcut to reaching it? It's just a difference in the path you take. You've obtained your power fairly. Congratulations.'"

"'Thank you.'"

Taesan, who had expressed his gratitude, drew his sword.

"In that sense, may I request a duel?"

"Go ahead!"

Ainzhahr laughed heartily and drew his sword.

The duel began once again.

Until now, Taesan had fought many duels with Ainzhahr, but Ainzhahr had never used his full strength in any of them. He didn't even use proper swordsmanship, only showing off his clumsy movements. Yet, despite this, Taesan couldn't even land a single hit on Ainzhahr. There was a huge gap between them.

But that was no longer the case.

Clang!

The swords clashed. In the face of Ainzhahr's powerful attack, Taesan didn't take a single step back.

[You activated the distorted ecosystem of Dekaravia.]

The dark magic he had been using all along.

But its power was on a different dimension.

Kwagwang!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The roots rose up and shook the repository. If Jorge hadn't opened the wall, the repository would have been destroyed by the overwhelming power.

Everything in the world that was connected to the roots was summoned.

Against this, Ainzhart, wrapped in golden light, swung his sword.

Quaaduk!

The roots were cut off by Ainzhart's golden sword.

However, the golden light that wrapped around Ainzhart also began to dwindle noticeably.

"This is fun!"

Ainzhart's eyes sparkled.

"I don't need to control my strength at all!"

Ainzhart stomped his foot.

In an instant, he arrived in front of Taesan. His speed was so fast that even Taesan couldn't keep up.

But it wasn't impossible to respond.

Taesan swung his sword.

[You have activated a strong attack.]

Kaang!

Taesan's body was pushed back.

However, he didn't take any damage. It meant that he had successfully blocked Ainzhart's true intentions.

"He's strong indeed."

Ainzhart was a monster.

Now that he had become immortal, it was clear that he had overwhelming strength that could defeat him 99 times out of 100.

But there was one chance in 100 that he could win.

Now, he had reached the same level as Ainzhart.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Grain, who possesses the variables of 'boundary' and 'sanctity', main-grade skills, it wasn't impossible for him to win.

Tae-san moved his feet. He sharply dug into the black Ainzhahr.

Kugugugugum!

The duel lasted for about half a day before it ended. Ainzhahr had a very satisfied expression.

"Good. It's been a while since I've felt so relaxed."

After taking a rest, Tae-san went to find Levienof. It was possible because Ainzhahr had now risen to the level of the undying.

But it was still impossible. Ainzhahr frowned with a disappointed expression.

"[78th floor cleared.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [You obtained the Book of Knowledge.] [You obtained ???.]

"Status window."

[Level: 161] [Shield: 19,100/19,100] [Health: 200,277/200,277] [Mana: 20,341/20,341] [Magic: 2,218/2,218] [Strength: 37,845] [Agility: 37,985] [Intelligence: 33,941] [Attack power + 10,125] [Defense power + 6,752] [The target is in the best condition.] [What kind of stats are these.]

The ghost let out a dry laugh. Even those who cleared the labyrinth normally couldn't be sure if their stats were higher than Taesan's current stats.

Taesan checked the rewards he obtained.

[Book of Knowledge.] [A small part of the knowledge from the Library of Heaven is contained within.]

"Is this a simplified version of the Library of Heaven?"

As he flipped through the pages, he couldn't find the end. He couldn't even detect the end with reconnaissance and concentrated detection.

The Library of Heaven was literally an infinite library. Even Jorge couldn't read all the books. It was natural that he couldn't know the end even if it was just a part.

He thought he would read it little by little when he had the time.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[I used it.] [I obtained the Sword of All Creation.] [Sword of All Creation.] [Strength + 300] [Agility + 300] [Intelligence + 300] [Mana + 200] [Magic + 75] [Attack Power + 750] [Dark Magic + 10] [Magic + 10] [A sword that contains the power of all creation, with an immense power that the user cannot fully wield.]

It was a weapon that raised overall stats. Fortunately, Taesan could handle both magic and dark magic, so it was a perfect fit for him.

After finishing his preparations, Taesan headed down the stairs.

[79th Floor Quest Begins.] [Prove your strength in the Realm of Struggle.] [Reward: Ring of the Victor.] [Secret Reward: ???]

79th Floor.

The 80th Floor was now within sight. Just as Taesan was about to descend into the labyrinth, the floor began to shake.

This had happened several times before, so Taesan waited calmly.

Before long, Balbam appeared.

Balbam didn't say a word.

He just stood there, silent. Taesan didn't speak either.

[You.]

After a moment, Balbam opened his mouth.

[You really are a pain in the head.]

His voice was filled with deep exhaustion.

Note: "Balbam" is likely a name or title, and "????" represents unknown or secret information.
