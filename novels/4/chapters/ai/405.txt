**Episode 406**

406 (Extra Story). 58th Floor, Lee Tae-yeon

[Start of 58th Floor Quest.] [Defeat the boss of the 58th Floor and pass through.] [Reward: Sword that guards the line.] [Secret Reward: ???]

"Is this the 58th Floor... what was this place again?"

Lee Tae-yeon tilted her head in confusion.

With Maria's help, she had recovered her past life's memories. However, as conflicting memories emerged, most of the unimportant things from her past life were forgotten.

The 58th Floor was no exception. Only a rough image of the floor remained, but she couldn't remember what monsters would appear.

"I'll find out when I go in."

She went down the stairs.

The shop owner was waiting for her there.

"You're here."

"Hello?"

Lee Tae-yeon smiled brightly and waved her hand. The shop owner looked at her with an ambiguous gaze.

"You're already on the 58th Floor."

"Yes. Isn't it fast?"

"It is. Too fast."

The shop owner looked at Lee Tae-yeon with suspicious eyes.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What were you doing outside and came back?"

"There was something that happened, that's all."

Lee Tae-yeon dodged the question. Due to Maria's restriction, she couldn't share her memories with others, and the shop owner wasn't someone she had a close relationship with either.

The shop owner, who had been gazing at Lee Tae-yeon for a moment, turned his gaze away.

"You might be able to... maybe."

The shop owner muttered to himself, looking like he was deep in thought, before changing his expression.

"What do you want to buy?"

"No? I don't have enough gold right now."

She shook her head. The shop owner began to organize his goods.

"If you're interested, come back and I'll show you some useful items."

"Ah, okay."

Lee Tae-yeon replied half-heartedly and passed by the shop owner.

She found the shop owner's behavior to be very unusual.

In her past life and current life, the shop owner had always looked down on her. He would mock her and ridicule her feelings.

Even when she reached the 100th floor, he didn't change. He would call her a "lucky rat" who had managed to climb up the system's ranks by chance, and showed no interest in her.

But now, things were different.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

As she regained her memories of her past life, she began to descend into the labyrinth at an incredible speed, and her attitude started to become more audacious.

It was the first time she had seen a shop owner like that.

"Wow, this is amazing."

She muttered to herself and took a step forward.

A sense of tension and anxiety began to creep up on her. She was always the most nervous when she first set foot in a new layer.

Creak.

She opened the door, and the 58th-floor monster responded to her.

[The Golden Deer appeared.]

A deer with golden antlers.

As soon as she saw the monster's appearance, her memories came flooding back.

"Ah? Is this the place?"

The deer let out a loud cry and charged towards her. Lee Tae-yeon took a deep breath, gripped her sword tightly, and pulled it out.

Clang!

The sword and the golden antlers clashed.

Lee Tae-yeon didn't back down. She twisted her sword's trajectory and struck the deer's side, making a long cut.

As the deer let out a painful cry, Lee Tae-yeon swung her hand. The intermediate spirit she had contracted with attacked the deer according to her master's will.

[You activated the Evasion skill.]

Ka-ga-gak!

The spirit's attack broke through, and the deer that was charging towards her was evaded.

She quickly lowered her stance and jumped to the side.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You activated Stealth.] [You activated Earth's Shadow.]

Lee Tae-yeon's body was instantly dyed with the shadow.

When the deer couldn't find Lee Tae-yeon and became flustered, Lee Tae-yeon lightly pierced the deer's neck.

The deer trembled its body in pain, violently shaking its head to push Lee Tae-yeon away, and then charged at her again.

After a few minutes of battle, the deer collapsed.

"Phew."

Lee Tae-yeon took a deep breath. Her body didn't have a single wound.

She tidied up her disheveled hair and continued to conquer the labyrinth.

* * *

Her steps were unwavering.

More deer appeared, but she easily defeated them without getting hurt. After defeating the seventh deer, she muttered to herself.

"I never imagined I'd be able to clear the labyrinth like this."

In her past life, she was a coward.

She didn't clear the labyrinth through a head-on battle, but rather through cunning.

It was the same on the 58th floor. Although she didn't remember exactly, she probably struggled to hunt one or two deer and then found a way to avoid the rest. And she must have succeeded.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She thought that was all she had. Fighting head-on and descending into the labyrinth was something only an existence like Taesan could do.

As time went back, many things changed.

She continued to move on to the next room.

After defeating seven of them, she had finally adapted to the pattern and had the leisure to think of other things while fighting.

"Taesan must have surpassed the 80th floor by now?"

The depth that Taesan had reached was likely to be very different from what she remembered. Taesan had already surpassed the limits of mortality. It was highly likely that the mage who created the labyrinth had intervened in some way.

"The depths... or something."

That hellish place.

Just thinking about it made her skin crawl. She was rejecting that place.

But she suppressed her instincts with her willpower.

Ka-chak!

She swung her sword, deflecting the deer's antlers and stabbing deep into its chest. The deer trembled and fell.

She organized her thoughts.

The depths were an extremely difficult and treacherous place, and she needed to prepare thoroughly in advance.

The current her was definitely stronger than her past self.

However, there were certainly skills that she couldn't acquire, no matter what.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The invisible shadow is something you'll get if you raise your proficiency... and the hidden story that no one knows can be obtained around the 70th floor. Is it difficult to obtain the hidden mouse's breath?"

The hidden mouse's breath was a skill that had been built up gradually from the beginning of the labyrinth. It was a possibility that it couldn't be obtained easily now, as she was walking a completely different path from her past life.

The hidden mouse's breath was one of the skills that showed her highest efficiency.

Not being able to obtain it would be a huge loss.

But her heart didn't waver.

The hidden mouse's breath was indeed an excellent skill, but it also revealed her weakness.

She had become stronger than that now. There was no reason to regret it now. She had obtained a skill that surpassed her past one.

After quickly clearing the floors, she arrived at the 58th floor boss.

It was a large, majestic deer with shining antlers.

As the deer charged towards her, Lee Tae-yeon swung her sword.

[You have activated a strong attack.]

Ka-boom!

Strong attack. Originally, it was a skill that disappeared after one attack, but with the ability sword, she could activate it continuously if she timed it right.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With the Ability Sword, dark magic, and the power of the spirits, she mercilessly pressured the boss. After dozens of minutes, she had also taken considerable damage, but she had defeated the boss.

[58th floor cleared.] [Your level has risen.] [You have reached the optimal state.]

'Heh.'

Lee Tae-yeon let out a sigh of relief and sat down, exhausted. After calculating the time, she smiled faintly.

It hadn't taken her a day to clear the 58th floor.

She was undoubtedly stronger now.

'What was the 59th floor like...?'

As she was organizing her thoughts and taking a short break, someone came up from the lower floor.

Lee Tae-yeon checked the stairs without flinching.

The one who came up was the Guide of Evil, a 5th-tier adventurer. She waved her hand.

'Hello?'

'...'

The guide who saw her clicked his tongue.

'...You're just a coward.'

The guide's gaze at her was filled with contempt.

'I don't know how you, a woman like you, got permission from the higher-ups, but don't get too cocky. You're just a trash, after all.'

What was visible was jealousy and contempt.

It was an unfamiliar emotion."

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Even in her past life, the gazes of the guides towards her were not much different from now. The higher-ups recognized her talent and allowed her to delve deeper, but the guides of other ranks could not accept that fact.

In their eyes, Lee Tae-yeon was just a coward.

She would use underhanded tactics to clear the labyrinth, and as an adventurer, she couldn't obtain the things she was supposed to get, making her a pathetic existence.

That's why they looked down on Lee Tae-yeon and were jealous of her.

It wasn't much different in her current life either. Although she had cleared the labyrinth more normally than in her past life, she still had an undeniable fear.

"Yeah, yeah."

Lee Tae-yeon replied carelessly, leaning her back against the wall. The guide's face contorted, seemingly displeased with her nonchalant attitude.

"……I suppose I need to teach you some manners."

The guide pulled out a hatchet.

He thrust it towards her, speaking sharply.

"Kneel down."

Lee Tae-yeon gazed at the guide with a blank expression. The guide continued to speak confidently.

"I'm an adventurer of a higher rank than you. I've reached the 60th floor. As a guide, I must receive absolute obedience from those of lower ranks. You may have been allowed to delve deeper, but for now, I'm in a deeper position than you."

The guide's words were almost like a violent command.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lee Tae-yeon felt a sense of superiority in the gaze of the guide.

‘Ah.’

She recalled her memories.

The guide in front of her was the one who had tormented and ridiculed her in her past life.

What would her past self have done?

There was no need to think about it. She would have immediately bowed her head.

Pride was of no use. The only important thing was survival. For that, she could abandon her pride.

But.

She smiled faintly and stood up.

“Disgusting.”

“……What?”

The guide's eyebrows twitched, as if he hadn't expected Lee Tae-yeon to refuse. Lee Tae-yeon spoke lazily.

“Why should I bow my head to someone like you? Isn't it the other way around? I'm an adventurer recognized by the headquarters. I'm fundamentally different from someone like you from birth.”

“……You bastard!”

The guide roughly raised his axe. At that moment, Lee Tae-yeon's body moved.

She grasped her sword and quickly charged at the guide.

“Ha!”

The guide hastily swung his axe down. Lee Tae-yeon moved her sword very slowly. The gentle movement of her sword sent the axe flying far away.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$"Ah."

Itaeyeon's sword pointed towards the guide's head.

The guide instinctively sensed death.

Swish!

The sword swept past the guide's cheek.

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, I tried acting like I did on Earth, and it worked pretty well. She burst out laughing with a bright smile.

"'Me? I might have done well if I had acted unexpectedly? If the world returns to normal, I'll think about it seriously?'

"Her face, which had been muttering to herself, gradually darkened.

"She had made up her mind to fight the guide who had just insulted her.

"It was something her past self, who didn't value anything except life, would never have done.

"She had changed.

"And she liked this new self.

"'Then... let's keep going down.'

"After taking a break, she grasped her sword again and began to descend into the labyrinth. Her eyes were filled with strong determination."
