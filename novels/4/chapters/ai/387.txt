Episode 388

388. The Sixth Return to Earth (5)

"Is it really starting from scratch? I'm worried about what will happen later."

Itealy is muttering to herself and moving her body. The spirit is assisting her, and black magic is pouring towards the monster.

Kukukukung!

The monster's tentacles are attacking. The dense attack couldn't be dodged entirely. Itealy swung her sword.

[You have activated the "Falling" skill.]

Kukung!

The trajectory of the tentacles is distorted. At the moment when the monster's power is concentrated on Itealy, Kang Jun-hyeok falls from above the monster.

Kwa-jik.

Kang Jun-hyeok's sword pierces the monster.

The monster's body trembles for a moment. The attack on Itealy comes to a halt, and she doesn't miss the opportunity. She quickly rushes in and, together with Kang Jun-hyeok, inserts her sword into the monster.

[You have defeated monster 577.]

"Are you okay?"

"There's no problem."

Itealy took a breath. If she had worked with Kang Jun-hyeok, she could have defeated the three-digit monster without much difficulty.

Itealy is surrounded by the monsters that are rushing towards her.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hang in there."

There were many four-digit monsters and a few three-digit monsters. Hard mode players found it hard to handle, but they were somehow managing to take them down.

They had been fighting against monsters that were overwhelmingly stronger than them on Earth. Based on numerous deaths and experiences, they had created the most optimal battle strategy and formation for fighting monsters. Now, they were not easily pushed back.

Lee Taeyeon jumped up. Her body speed suddenly increased.

[You have activated acceleration.]

Whoa!

Her sword pierced the monster. Kim Hwiyeon's eyes widened as she gritted her teeth and hung on. Lee Taeyeon tightened her grip.

[You have activated ripping.]

Rrrrr!

The sword moved around and hacked the monster to pieces.

"Thanks. Taeyeon."

"It looks like things are going well."

"We're talking, aren't we……."

Kim Hwiyeon turned her gaze to the side.

In the place where Indian people were gathered, a loud scream that could be heard from here was echoing.

"That's not good-looking, is it."

"Where is Taesan's father?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Russia's side. If it's this bad, I can handle it myself, so I'll just leave it to you and go."

Kim Hui-yeon grumbled, but her expression didn't darken. It was as if the Taesan trusted her, saying that in another way.

"Russia's side."

Lee Tae-yeon narrowed her eyes. Russia was fighting far away, but it wasn't a problem for her.

The Russian players were being crushed by the monsters without mercy.

And then Taesan's figure appeared among them.

"So it will be over soon."

*

The situation in Russia was not good at all.

Viktor, who was blocking the monsters charging towards them, was shocked.

"What the hell!"

The monsters were stronger than ever before.

Some rare three-digit numbers, even hard mode players, were struggling to withstand a single blow.

"'Is that really true?'"

During the process of exchanging information, Kim Hui-yeon warned that the monsters that would appear this time were completely different from those before. If they didn't prepare in advance, many people could lose their lives, she said.
Here is the translation of the text:

Victor was half-believing the words. Although he had confirmed the power of the Taesan, the monsters he had faced so far were not that strong. However, he had still prepared for the worst.

But the monster's strength was beyond his expectations.

Kuuuung!

The people flew away along with the loud noise. Every time the monster swung its club, people died.

The Russian and Mongolian players were in a state of panic and couldn't respond properly.

They were thus forced to retreat without a fight.

[Oh!]

Kk! Kk! Kk!

The giant let out a roar and charged at Victor. People tried to block it, but they couldn't achieve much. At the moment when the club was swung and Victor gritted his teeth to withstand it, he was suddenly struck.

Kwa-jik.

The giant's body was crushed to the ground.

The monster that no one could stop suddenly died. And the person who had done it stood on the monster's corpse.

"...Gang Tae-san."

"I understand. What situation are we in?"

"It's bone-chilling."

Victor nodded with a gloomy expression.

"That's enough."
Here is the translation of the text:

People cannot realize it until they experience it directly. Viktor's face was filled with a sense of reality.

Then, I think it's okay to summarize.

Tai Shan had collected the magic. The power was implemented through an open channel into the world.

[You have activated Jebara's black storm.]

"Eeeeh!"

"Ah, people, ... ah?"

People who were fighting monsters with all their might stopped in their tracks.

A small collection of black wind was born between the monsters.

Although it was small enough to be ignored, for some reason, all of them were captivated by the black wind.

The wind began to grow and soon took on the form of a giant storm.

Kka-kka-kka!

A storm that engulfed the world itself descended upon the earth.

The monsters were sucked into the storm. People screamed and crouched down, but the black storm only swallowed the monsters, not touching the people.

"This... is..."

Viktor stared blankly at the storm.

The storm slowly subsided, and no more monsters were seen.

Thousands of monsters were suddenly cleared away.

No one could open their mouth before the overwhelming power.

"...It was just a show."
(Note: The last sentence is a bit ambiguous and could be translated in different ways depending on the context. I provided one possible translation.)
Here is the translation of the text:

He let out a bitter laugh.

Tai Shan did not show his strength when he defeated the third-century hard mode player. Victor only realized this fact later.

Two days later, the wave ended.

Russia was inferior because Tai Shan had cleared it, and Eastern Asia's Three Kingdoms had experience up to this point, so they won easily without much difficulty.

However, India was different.

They barely survived on the mountain of corpses.

* * *

"Ugh...".

"Aa...".

The cries and groans echoed from all directions. The faces of India's hard mode players were stiff with rigor mortis.

The number of people who died was so great that it was terrifying. For them, the quest to return home was just a game. As they believed they could defeat monsters at any time, they did not prepare any strategy or tactics.

Therefore, the damage was inevitable.

The result showed that 30% of the players lost their lives, including a significant number of hard mode players.

And the quest appeared again.
Here is the translation of the text:

"[Special Quest Start] [The Second Wave is Starting.] [Waiting Period: One Week.] [Please handle all the monsters that are coming at you.] [Rewards will be distributed differently depending on the results when you return to the labyrinth.]

"Ah."

Fear is etched on people's faces.

Hasan tried hard to persuade hard-mode players to retreat.

"Don't you see? The monsters that are appearing from now on are too strong for us to stop with our own strength. We need to join forces with other groups and ask for help......"

"Shut up!"

But they didn't listen to Hasan's words.

"This is just once. This is just once...... We can stop the second wave with our own strength!"

They believed they had absolute power.

The monsters believed that they were invincible.

When everything was shattered, they began to deny reality and shout with obstinacy.

"......Is that so?"

Hasan's eyes dropped. He left with a determined expression.

And the second wave began.

Nothing changed. The monsters were still strong, and they were still weaker.

Unlike the first wave, they formed a rough formation, but it was clumsy. They suffered even greater losses, as their coordination was not good at all."

Note: I translated "하산" as "Hasan", assuming it's a character's name. If it's not a character's name, please let me know and I'll retranslate it.
Here is the translation of the text:

"We're here to help! Follow us from behind!"

Luckily, many Korean players who had organized the wave when people were about to die came to support us.

Thanks to their support, we were able to repair without any additional damage.

However, the atmosphere became even worse.

This incident made it clear that they could not hold back on their own and that it was impossible for them to stop.

People began to split up.

Initially, the class system was maintained because hard-mode players could survive only with their own strength. They could force others to submit to their class with their overwhelming power. It was a matter of logic based on strength.

However, if they were unable to obtain power.

Even if they were trusted and respected, nothing would be achieved.

Everything built on that power would crumble.

A window appeared, announcing that the next wave would start in a week.

And the next night, Indian players who were receiving the Zandalari class in secret moved to Korea's frontline.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, since there were a significant number of them, they couldn't help but be affected by the harsh mode's sensitivity. The Indian players of the harsh mode scowled at them with distorted faces.

"What are you doing?! You said you wouldn't make contact with other groups, but what's going on here?!"

"Shut up!"

A man from the Chandala class shouted coarsely.

"You treated us like slaves, like tools, and said we'd live if we followed your will! But look at us now! We're not even living, we're all dying!"

The harsh mode players were taken aback by the intense emotional outburst. The man gnashed his teeth and shouted.

"We'll all die if we keep going like this! That's why we've decided to join another group!"

"Oh, oh..."

The faces of the harsh mode players turned red. They didn't want to argue, but they couldn't help it. In reality, if they continued like this, most of them would die.

However, they didn't intend to agree with their opponent's words.

"...Fine. I don't acknowledge it. But according to the rules, those who betray us will meet death alone."

The harsh mode players drew their weapons. The Chandalas let out a scream and trembled with fear.
Here is the translation of the text:

Their hard-mode players laughed mockingly and pointed their swords at the man.

"'Even now, if you confess your sin and take your own life, I'll spare the rest by plucking out one of your eyes.'"

"'Die.'"

The man lifted his middle finger.

"'It's all the same regardless of how I die. I'll do as I please.'"

"'...Yes. That's how we hasten death.'"

The hard-mode players decided to kill them. Just as they were about to charge at them with their weapons.

"'Why are you making such a racket.'"

"'Ah.'"

But it was unsuccessful.

Right next to them, Taesan was staring at them expressionlessly.

* * *

The hard-mode players were startled.

Taesan was approaching without them noticing. He was like a ghost who had suddenly appeared beside them.

But they soon became flustered.

"'Die.'"

One of the hard-mode players stepped forward confidently and said,

"'This is our group's affair. You have no right to interfere.'"

Taesan just stared at him without responding. The hard-mode player felt a chill but tried to ignore it and faced him boldly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Who are you?"

"I am Sajid Khan, a great Brahmin from India."

"Ah, Sajid. I dislike it."

"...What?"

"I am not an adult. I won't think of saving people who are not mine, but if I become one of them, the conversation will change. They are trying to abandon you and join my group."

Tai Shan turned his gaze to Chandala.

"Are you all coming to our side?"

"Yes, we will follow you. We won't be with those despicable people."

Chandala's face turned red as he exclaimed fiercely. Tai Shan nodded his head.

"That's all right. Come this way."

"...As you please!"

Sajid raised his voice harshly. He drew his sword.

"These people are ours! You have no right to interfere!"

"Are you qualified to interfere?"

"What, what?"

"The leader of India is not you. It's Kamal Hassan. And the conversation with him is already over."

If someone wants to move to a different group, I won't stop them. I won't obstruct their freedom of movement.
Here is the translation of the text:

Two days ago, Hassan sneaked into Taesan's place and said:

"Even if you don't have actual governing power, you've recognized him as a leader. Therefore, everything else is just a general player. I have no qualification to stop him."

Taesan's response was gloomy.

They couldn't refute it. They had made Kamal Hassan the leader just to get rid of a troublesome matter.

"...Don't be ridiculous!"

But Sajid resisted.

"You're going to allow that?"

"No permission is needed."

"Hah!"

Sajid laughed and opened his inventory, taking out a blue cane.

"Regardless of what happens, you've betrayed me! Die!"

[Sajid activated the wind sword cane.]

The wind sword cane was unleashed towards Chandala. Chandala let out a scream and collapsed.

Taesan lightly waved his hand. The wind was under his control and scattered. Sajid was shocked.

"What's going on?"

His power wasn't blocked. It was gone just like that.

Taesan looked at him expressionlessly.

Sajid pretended to be calm and proudly shouted out.
Here is the translation of the text:

"They're no match for me! Qualifications and the like are unnecessary!"

He was confident. The Mountain would never be able to kill himself, he thought.

There were still tens of thousands of hard-mode players left in India. If the Mountain attacked Sajid, it would undoubtedly lead to a serious confrontation.

Just for the sake of Chandala and the like, Sajid wouldn't take on such risks, he thought.

"Understood, then get lost! Foreigner!"

Sajid shouted fiercely and charged at Chandala. Other hard-mode players were also starting to move slowly.

However, Sajid was mistaken.

Hard-mode players like those in India meant nothing to the Mountain.

The Mountain calmly snapped his fingers. Sajid, who was charging at him, flew backward with his head spinning and crashed to the ground.

Sajid lay on the ground, wriggling like a worm.

"...What?"

"...It seems you're mistaken about something."

The Mountain's voice echoed quietly through the eerie silence filled with shock.

"You are of no value to me."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Those who are treated as slaves, whether in normal mode play or hard mode play, were all the same to Taesan."

Note: 노예 (noye) means "slaves" or "bondsmen", 취급받는 (chuk-geop-bat-neun) means "being treated as", 노말 (nomal) means "normal", 모드 (mode) means "mode" or "level", 플레이어나 (peuleo-neun) means "or play", 하드 (hadeu) means "hard", 태산 (taesan) is a proper noun, and 똑같았다 (ddeok-gat-gat-da) means "were all the same".
