Chapter 292

292. Projection of Will (3)

"I will create equipment that anyone can use, a blacksmith of the labyrinth that anyone can use. That is the position given to me by the mage."

Kaang!

Halfran struck the hammer. A clear sound echoed.

"But the blacksmith here is not just me. The labyrinth is a place where gods reside. The rewards given to adventurers are treasures that cannot be made or seen outside. Many blacksmiths have headed towards the labyrinth."

And most of them disappeared silently.

The labyrinth does not allow ordinary adventurers. The blacksmith was the same. Only someone with Halfran's level of talent was accepted.

"Depth. The initial part of that place is occupied by a lunatic dwarf who does not exist."

"Go and find him?"

"He is a being that creates equipment different from mine."

Halfran said.
Here is the translation of the text:

"That guy is obsessed with creating something that transcends mortality, and has gone crazy because of it. He's not a normal person. He's only good at dealing with ordinary materials, but when it comes to dealing with something like what you have, he's top-notch."

Half-ran wrinkled his face.

"I'll gladly accept your willingness to swallow yourself. Since you've already gone crazy and broken down, you can create what you want. If there's a problem, it's because that guy is mentally broken, too...".

Half-ran spat out his tongue. His expression seemed to be getting annoyed just by thinking about it.

"Most of the people in the labyrinth have already broken down, but that guy is even worse than that. ...No, you wouldn't have a problem."

With a mysterious face, Half-ran gazed at the Taesan and opened his mouth.

"That's okay, I can handle it."

"Is that deep?"

The place that had seemed very far away now felt right in front of him. Taesan inserted his will into the gap.

"Alright, then when do you think you'll come back?"

"I don't know what to say about that, either."

Half-ran tentatively touched the materials.

"There are too many, and they're too diverse. You can't easily make the equipment you want. It might take you as long as it takes to make a ring."

"Really?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's a long story, but the Taesan's face was not bad. The longer it takes to produce equipment, the higher the level becomes, as I have known from my experience so far.

"So, let's see what's next."

"Wait patiently. It will be a busy time."

Half-ran gathered the materials with a face full of anticipation.

Taesan went down to the maze again. He arrived at the 64th floor staircase.

And the space began to split, revealing the appearance of the demon.

The woman who was looking at Taesan opened her mouth.

[As someone has already said, but I'll say it anyway. The 64th floor. The guide is waiting at the end.]

"It's faster than expected."

[There's no choice. You've become too strong too quickly.]

An adventurer from the 64th floor was fighting an adventurer who had stepped up to the 74th floor. It was an unprecedented incident in the long history of the maze.

[Then let's do our best to win.]

"Thank you."

[And the power you obtained... ]

The demon trailed off his words. The demon's expression, looking at Taesan, was ambiguous.

[No. It doesn't matter now.]

"Are you saying you have a will?"

(Note: Taesan is a character, likely the main protagonist, and the demon is a character who is speaking to him.)
Here is the translation of the text:

[Alright, that's clearly a powerful and formidable force, but you're not ready to handle it now. You'll need to go down deeper and gather more strength before you can unleash it.]

The devil disappeared into the darkness.

[We'll talk about that later. Come back quickly. I'll be waiting for you in the depths.]

Tae-san nodded his head.

After the devil left, he went down the stairs.

[Start of 64th floor quest.] [Defeat the boss of the 64th floor and pass through.] [Reward: Broken Self. Bahalram's Helmet] [Secret reward: ???]

*

The monster on the 64th floor was a giant slime.

After passing through the corridor, you can't go back through the corridor. Then, the slime fills the entire room and approaches slowly.

Before being crushed by the slime, defeat the slime. It looked like that level.

There was no problem for Tae-san. With his overwhelming strength, he could easily defeat the slime with just a few sword swings without using any skills.

As he passed through the floor, he checked the new skills he had obtained.
Here is the translation of the text:

"[Special Permanent Skill: Last Chance] [Proficiency: 1%] [When attacked by a fatal attack, it will inevitably block that attack once. It can only be used once against the same opponent and has a one-hour cooldown.]"

"Uh?"

The eyes of Mount Tai sparkled.

I had somewhat anticipated the skill name, but I didn't expect it to be at this level.

This skill was similar to "Endure".

Of course, in terms of its value as a standalone skill, it was lower than "Endure". "Endure" can completely ignore an opponent's attack and not take any damage for a certain period of time, giving it a very wide range of applications.

In contrast, "Last Chance" only blocks the attack. Since my actions are fixed as a defense, it seems difficult to make an immediate move.

However, the fact that it can block the attack is also a useful aspect. It's not as good as ignoring the attack like "Endure", but it's still a skill that can save one's life.

Considering its value, it's hard to compare it to other skills.

It's a very good skill, considering it can block a fatal attack. But I can somehow understand it.

[The opponent is @!xx$@ @#!.]

This was the system window that appeared when I entered Half-Ran's world."
Here is the translation of the text:

"The system window is collapsing. It's the first time since the holy savior that it's happening. The reason is not difficult to imagine.

'A being that has transcended mortality.'

A being that has planted its feet in transcendence.

When dealing with such a being, the system that was supposed to express it is malfunctioning, and errors are occurring.

It's clear that the being has struck back at the mortal body, saying it's not possible to escape.

And as a result, a new development has emerged.

Between holding on and the final chance, which one will activate first?

The mountain has moved to the next room, slowly compressing the approaching slime without touching it.

Gurgle.

[Your first attack has been completely nullified.] [Your second attack has been completely nullified.] [Your third attack has been completely nullified.] [You have taken 1043 damage.]

The damage is slowly entering. The mountain has not moved.

When one is in a life-or-death situation, holding on will activate. And since the holding-on ability is activated against a different target, there is no cooldown issue.

The life force is slowly being consumed, and it has dropped to three digits.

Just as death is imminent, the mountain's body moved."
Here is the translation of the text:

There was no intention of Taesan. It was close to automatic movement.

It gives strength to the entire body. It moves legs and arms to push roughly.

Ting!

The slime is bouncing back.

"It's going to activate before enduring!"

If this is the case, it would be an unexpected harvest. It's like having two lives. Even a ghost let out a sigh.

[This doesn't make sense.]

Taesan has endurance, so relatively it's of low value, but for other adventurers, it's a skill that's hard to find something better than this.

The labyrinth is a place where you have to make a life-or-death challenge. A skill that adds stability to this challenge is highly valued, and the ultimate skill is the best among them.

Taesan has finished the understanding and defeated the slime, recovering his physical strength.

The confirmation is over. Now it's time to confirm the remaining one.

[Special permanent activation skill: Incantation] [Proficiency: 1%] [Concretization of intention. By uttering a language infused with intention, one can make a declaration that affects the world.]

Incantation. A concept skill that increases proficiency. A skill obtained through the projection of intention.

Note: The text appears to be a passage from a novel or game, and the translation may not be perfect due to the context and cultural references.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Taesan moved to the next room. As the slime was rushing towards him, he gathered his will and said:

"Halt."

Kuuu!

The slime, which was approaching slowly, suddenly stopped.

The slime trembled. It was as if the slime's own will was colliding with Taesan's command, making it unable to do anything.

"It seems my headache has subsided a bit."

This might be because he obtained a specific skill, as it was less severe than before. At least, he wouldn't be unable to use it again after a few times.

Taesan gazed at the trembling slime, which opened its mouth again.

"Burn!"

The slime began to burn with the declaration.

The flames engulfed the slime, and the headache became even more severe. Taesan endured the pain and watched the burning slime.

The slime burned and then disappeared suddenly.

[You have won against the slime guarding the door.]

"The damage itself is fine."

The slime's vitality was quite high. The fact that he could defeat it with his will was a sign that the power of his will was proportional to his attack power.

[It's close to a prophecy.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The ghost muttered to itself. It was a tribe that handled a different kind of magic from the magic of the gods, and their words were similar to the spells they used.

It wasn't bad. There was a problem, but it was just a headache. The more they exercised their influence, the more severe the headache became.

Taesan alleviated the headache and conducted various experiments.

As a result, they found that when they used the spell on themselves, the headache was less severe.

And they also discovered that they could now handle the things they had been neglecting.

"Move!"

Kaga, kaga!

Arrows sprang out and rushed towards the slime.

Arrows with their own will. At first, they weren't bad when they were first obtained, but they weren't used well from a certain point on.

The reason was simple. The damage was too small.

The arrows needed a certain level of handling, and the criteria for the level were extremely high. Even Taesan, who had become quite strong, couldn't extract significant damage.

And moving one's own will was something that didn't bother Taesan, but it was also a sign that Taesan could no longer exercise their influence.

They couldn't even match the strong ones, so Taesan hadn't used them much until now.
Here is the translation:

But now that I've made up my mind, things have changed.

[A self-aware arrow] [A self-moving arrow that moves to protect its owner. It moves on its own, but cannot exceed a certain range.] [Current owner: Kang Taesan] [Current attack power: 521]

It seems that my attack power has risen significantly because I'm handling it myself. Additionally, my speed and power have noticeably increased.

"I was already at a level that could rival the transcendent."

The level of handling that I can achieve through my will is what makes me a usable arrow. If I rely on the self-awareness of the arrow instead of my will, my attack power will drop to two digits.

Tae-san's head suddenly felt a headache as he was about to use the arrow to defeat the slime.

Tae-san retrieved the arrow.

"It's usable, but..."

It was still difficult to handle.

Although I had mastered the spell and reduced my headaches, I was still not at a level where I could be ignored.

Now I understand why Ma Sin said that it was meaningless to use me now. It was because Tae-san's abilities themselves were insufficient for handling me from the beginning.

"But..."
Here is the translation of the text:

As the battle becomes more intense, the value of the equipment increases all the more.

It was a sufficient ability.

After confirming the victory, the giant began to break through the labyrinth again.

Breaking through the secret room, he claimed his reward. The reward was a black robe that granted the power of dark magic. It was a set of equipment to be offered to the demon king.

The giant continued to advance, eventually reaching the boss.

The boss was a slime with sharp thorns. The giant raised his hand.

"Hurry up and finish it."

[You activated the addition.]

Quack quack.

The slime began to disintegrate.

After striking it a few more times, the slime collapsed completely.

[64th floor cleared.]

Floor cleared.

However, the giant did not retract his sword.

[You summoned the supreme spirit, Barakaz, with a variety of colors. You also summoned the wind spirit king, Minerva.]

"Hello!"

[It's been a long time, master. The fact that you summoned Minerva, too, means that an enemy has appeared, doesn't it?]

"Yes."

The giant replied briefly, and Barakaz spoke with excitement, anticipating the next battle.

[Who is it? Is it related to the high-ranking officials again?]

"You'll know soon enough."

[Hmm?]
Here is the translation of the text:

Minerva's face was also stiff. She whispered to herself with a trembling voice.

"Ah......?"

Taesan gazed at the stairs leading to the 65th floor.

Kuung!

A tremendous reverberation resounded.

It was as if an earthquake had occurred, and the sound was slowly approaching.

Chel-kong.

Along with the sound of metal, it appeared.

A figure standing in front of Taesan's body, wearing a black armor from head to toe, appeared. On his back was a giant sword, as big as Taesan's body.

You could feel an overwhelming solidity.

The atmosphere was so oppressive that it silenced everything around him, just by existing.

And power.

Taesan had seen beings with such power before.

The Lord of Fire, and Ambrosia.

The guide of the path of evil. The leader of the group.

A ghost spoke:

"[Are you the first? It's fitting.]"

"......"

The knight didn't say a word. He just pointed his greatsword at Taesan.

[The iron wall that protects the world. A shaman has appeared.]
