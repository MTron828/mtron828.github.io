Chapter 541

541. The Temple of All Gods (7)

Until now, Taesan had never activated the Spirit Ascension with his own will.

This was not only because the Spirit Ascension was unique to Taesan himself, but also because of the inherent characteristics of the Spirit Ascension.

When the Spirit Ascension defeated an enemy, it would forcefully plunder the power within. Taesan's will had no control over this. Whether he wanted to or not, it would plunder by force.

It wasn't that he couldn't control it at all.

Thanks to the Seed of Life skill, he could control it to a very small extent.

However, the part he could control was limited to the type and amount of power being plundered. The Spirit Ascension was still a passive power that he couldn't actively manipulate.

But now, that Spirit Ascension had transformed into Spirit Domination.

Many things had changed in the process.

Taesan had activated the Spirit Domination with his own will.

As a result, it was manifesting in the world as a phenomenon.

Kwaaaang!

[Hmm?]

Lakiratas's face changed.

The axe was blocked by Taesan's hand and couldn't advance.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan's hand had neither boundaries nor physical strength. It was just an ordinary hand.

Of course, as he had reached a certain level, his body alone boasted an unchanging firmness, but it was absolutely impossible to block Rakiratas's attack. Without any equipment, he was like a fragile paper in front of an axe.

The moment they touched, it should have been crushed and torn apart.

But the axe was blocked.

Rakiratas put strength into his hand. Yet, the axe couldn't move forward.

[...For a moment.]

Rakiratas's face, which had been feeling unease, stiffened for the first time.

He realized it belatedly.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

Struggle and death were only for Rakiratas.

It was possible to break or contaminate with power and strength, but it couldn't be stolen. The two concepts were only allowed for Rakiratas.

But now...

Taesan's hand, which was touching the axe, contained struggle and death.

It was as if it belonged to Taesan.

It was a very small concept of theft, but even Rakiratas, the mastermind, didn't notice it immediately. However, it was a clear theft.

[You...]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Rakiratas tried to regain his own powers. But the struggle and death that had been shaken off by Taesan's hand did not return.

Power surged into Taesan's hand.

Kaah!

With a loud crash, Rakiratas and Taesan were pushed back together.

If it were the Rakiratas of old, he would have charged forward with his sword at the ready.

But he couldn't do that.

He stared at Taesan with a stern face.

[You...].

Rakiratas was about to say something, but...

[Enough.]

Just then, Jezi intervened.

* * *

[That's far enough.]

Kiiing!

Maria's power was activated. The option to confront each other was eliminated.

The battle itself was forcibly terminated.

When they came to their senses, they saw a transcendent being with overwhelming power standing between them, separating Taesan and Rakiratas with their powers.

[This should be enough. I've seen everything I need to see. Anything more is unnecessary.]

Maria said to Derusha.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What do you think, Dersha?" […….] "He proved himself against Rakiratas. Despite handling a strange beast, he showed that he could control it. And even against Rakiratas' full power, he demonstrated his own strength. Unlike what you said, it seems he'll be able to hold his own against the gods in the war as well."

Dersha didn't refute it.

Rakiratas is one of the top-tier transcenders, possessing unparalleled power. The fact that he was able to withstand him to this extent means that he can also defeat the gods.

"It's settled. I won't be stubborn anymore."

Dersha spoke quietly and stepped back. Maria smiled as she watched him.

"Don't hate her too much. She's doing what she thinks is right for this universe."

"I don't think much of it."

From Dersha's perspective, who has existed since the creation of the universe and maintains the order of the universe's death, Taesan is a very annoying foreign substance.

Taesan didn't have any particular thoughts about it either.

Rakiratas, who had been gazing at Taesan, slowly reached out his hand into the air. The axe slowly disappeared into the distance.

The atmosphere slowly settled down.

The wizard asked the other transcenders, "Dersha has acknowledged it, right? Is there anything else to say?"

There was no response.

Only a quiet, affirmative emotion was felt.

"It's settled."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan gazed at Taishan with a satisfied expression.

[I didn't know I could hold out this long against Lakirates. It's beyond my expectations. Is this a domain of life? I have no idea how it was created.] [But I'm following his control, so there shouldn't be a problem.]

The Transcendents were generally satisfied. Taesan, who had been watching them for a moment, asked them.

"Are you okay?"

[What's that?]

"My power, I mean."

[It's about time.]

Zhelvand let out a wry smile.

[You're handling an unusual power, and I knew that. It's surprising that it's a domain of life, but... you're following his control, so there shouldn't be a problem.] [I don't know what level you've reached or what position you're in, but as long as it's you, there's no problem.]

The Transcendents were saying that there was no problem.

However, what they meant was different from the reason Taesan had spoken.

"Did you not notice?"

Taesan gazed at Lakirates.

Lakirates also looked at the Transcendents with a subtle expression, similar to Taesan's.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$However, he opened his mouth instead of pointing it out.

[Is the inspection over?] [Yeah, it's done. I'm exhausted.] [I got what I wanted, so... I think I'll need a little rest now.] [You both do, don't you? You're not in the best shape either.] [That's right.]

Rakiratus had also lost quite a bit. He would gradually recover over time, but for now, he needed rest.

Rakiratus slowly moved his body.

[I'll rest first then. You two can keep talking.]

Before leaving, he looked at Tae San. Rakiratus had disappeared.

The transcendents were taken aback by the sudden movement.

But their surprise quickly faded.

"Anyway... there's no one left to bother you now. Congratulations."

The magician smiled broadly.

"You have been recognized by the transcendents of the universe. I'll come to you later to talk, so rest for now."

* * *

Tae San returned to the building that the magician had first introduced.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There, I was recharging my exhausted strength and spirit. Bardray trembled as if his hair was standing on end. His iron body creaked and shook with a rattling sound.

[...Am I not broken?]

"You're not broken. What's there to worry about?"

[You're not worried? Lakiratas! Lakiratas! The struggle and death that shook me!]

For Bardray, it was a terrifying experience. Every time the concept of the universe was shaken, it felt like he would break at any moment.

"You're my master. As long as I don't break, you won't break either."

[I know, but it's hard to help feeling terrified.]

Bardray grumbled, his heart still racing. He muttered to himself as if he was trying to calm down.

[Anyway... the atmosphere has changed a lot.]

The numerous gazes that were directed at Taesan.

Most of the gods who couldn't dominate the complete concept, but instead dominated smaller concepts, were sending hostile and murderous gazes towards Taesan.

They were antagonistic towards Taesan like a mantra, and felt threatened by him.

But now, they had all disappeared without a trace.

The occasional gazes directed at Taesan were filled with fear and terror."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power of Taesan shown in the battle against Rakirates was something enormous that they, who controlled small concepts, could not accept. With just one battle, they realized that Taesan had reached a separate realm that was beyond them.

"Not bad."

He had gained a lot. Through the process of fighting with his life on the line, he learned how to handle the authority he had obtained.

And he also realized the level he had reached.

Taesan, who was quietly resting, suddenly called out to Jeatbit as if he had remembered something.

"Grrr."

The beast's cry was heard. Jeatbit, like a puppy clinging to its owner, stuck to Taesan's entire body and quietly growled.

"What are you?"

The boundary of self-awareness.

Even Taesan couldn't fully understand what this was. Now he could give orders to the beast's self, but the bottom of the boundary was still unclear.

Taesan focused his mind.

He dug into the inside of the boundary. He tried to grasp the depths of it by manipulating his spirit.

'…….'

But he couldn't see anything.

It was like the deep sea, dark and profound. He couldn't reach the bottom.

Taesan stimulated his soul.

It felt like a power without a bottom.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I didn't know how to perfectly handle this, and it didn't feel easy at all."

'......And finally.'

The spiritual power of Lakirates, which had blocked the attack.

It was the moment when Taesan was thinking about it.

Creak.

The door opened, and a wizard appeared.

"Have you been resting well?"

"So-so."

"You must have had a hard time."

The wizard lightly waved his hand and sat down on a created chair, opening his mouth.

"The story is over. From now on, there will be no more opposition from the transcenders. You can go back now."

"Is it already over?"

"There's nothing to talk about for now. We still haven't decided exactly how to act."

The war had begun. There were many things to take care of. It wasn't something that could be settled in a few days.

"But... once things are settled to some extent, we might be able to ask for your help."

"I know that."

There was no intention to refuse. The wizard smiled brightly.

"You did well. You'll receive your reward directly from Lakirates. He said he would give it to you himself."

"......Really?"

Taesan's eyes sank.

Taesan had finished his moderate recovery.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's about time to leave.

Taesan went to find Lakiratas. It was because he had promised to give him a reward.

Taesan arrived at Lakiratas' temple.

"This is brutal."

There were countless swords, knives, and axes.

Innumerable weapons were embedded like decorations.

Each of those weapons was close to being a sacred relic, something that couldn't be found in the outside world.

And many skulls were scattered around the weapons.

It was a landscape that seemed to embody struggle and death.

And above it all, Lakiratas was sitting grandly.

[I'm here.]

"You said you'd give me a reward."

[A reward, yes. I have to give it to you.]

Lakiratas smiled mysteriously.

[If it's a reward, it's like I already have it, but yes. Rewards are necessary.]

It would be a meaningless conversation to anyone who overheard it.

But Taesan knew better than anyone what Lakiratas was saying.

"That's how it is."

[That's how it is.]

Lakiratas said with a playful tone.

[So, is my stolen concept being used well?]"

Note: The conversation between Taesan and Lakiratas seems to be cryptic and open to interpretation, so the translation may not fully convey the nuances of the original text.
