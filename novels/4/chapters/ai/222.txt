Chapter 223

223. The King of the Wind Spirits, Minerva (1)

[He's still very young.]

"How long do I need to wait to become a complete king of the spirits?"

[It won't take that long. I think it'll take about a week, just enough time.]

Barkarga smiled.

[This person is the king who will protect Ariaria and humans ahead. I'm honored to witness this magnificent moment with my own eyes. It's a great honor.]

"Let's wait for a bit."

For a week, Taesan had to keep anyone from approaching this sphere. Taesan leaned against the sphere and closed his eyes.

Then, Suma appeared. Someone was trying to put Taesan to sleep artificially.

Taesan didn't resist and easily accepted Suma.

Taesan fell asleep.

"Goodbye!"

When the sound of the greeting echoed, Taesan opened his eyes.

A white space greeted him, and a girl with blue hair in front of him tilted her head and smiled brightly.

"I'm glad to see you! My name is Minerva, the King of the Wind Spirits!"
Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan nodded his head and took her hand, and the girl who called herself Minerva smiled innocently and waved her hand.

"Are you my guardian who was summoned by my father?"

"If you're talking about the father who summoned you, then yes."

"Heh heh. Please take care."

[Your Majesty. This is......]

Barkaja, who had followed Minerva, let out a sigh. Minerva smiled and spread her arms.

"I have summoned you all to my domain!"

[Is that so.]

"You are my servant! Please take care!"

[Yes, I am your servant. I will obey your will.]

Barkaja bowed. Minerva treated Minerva with absolute devotion, as if she were a deity.

[Is this what it means that I'm not fully aware of my own self? I'm just a little kid.]

"Wah! It's white!"

Minerva, who had seen a ghost, shone her eyes and ran towards it.

"Who are you? Why are you so white? Can't you tell the difference from the background?"

[Go away, brat.]

The ghost, held by Minerva's hand and shaken back and forth, looked annoyed and moved away. But Minerva continued to chase after it.

Minerva, who was playing with the ghost, said to Tai Shan:

"So why did you summon me? I'm supposed to be watching over you."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Uh, there's still time left. Since the people outside don't seem to be moving yet, I'm feeling a bit bored."

Minerva grinned and ran to Taesan.

"Let's have some fun!"

"'Is it included in protecting what needs to be protected?'"

Taesan nodded his head.

* * *

When Taesan entered Minerva's territory, Akiel was sitting in the assigned tent, staring blankly at the ground.

She was not alone. Perina, Bann, and Karuin were all sitting or lying down, not saying a word.

"Akiel! You're here? ... Why are you so quiet?"

At that moment, the tent opened, and a middle-aged woman with fiery red hair, like a flame, entered. She looked like she was in her prime, with a dignified appearance that captivated the attention of many people.

Akiel forced a smile.

"Ah, Madam Marianne. Hello."

The woman was someone close to Akiel's parents, and they had a good relationship. They would occasionally discuss arranged marriages between families.
Here is the translation of the text:

She also often met Marianne when they were young and had a close friendship. Marianne adjusted her dress and sat down in the chair.

"Okay, why are you looking so gloomy? Didn't you want to come here?"

Akihen nodded slightly. Marianne scowled.

"I feel the same way. Ugh, the von Bauk clan. No matter how strong we are, they just keep telling us to come and go. I had to ride a horse for a month just to get here."

Most of the people gathered here had a strong dislike for the von Bauk clan. However, they couldn't say anything because of their power.

Marianne patted Akihen's shoulder.

"Well, let's think positively. Since we're here, let's enjoy it. What kind of existence is that girl from the planet?"

Akihen's face fell silent at her words.

"...Old lady."

Akihen opened her mouth with a hesitant tone.

"Why?"

"What do you think the old lady from the planet is?"

"I don't know."

Marianne opened her mouth with a hesitant face.

"Honestly, I don't know. I've checked nearby too, but I just can't figure it out. Even the spirits are keeping quiet about it."
Here is the translation:

The spirits didn't tell humans that they existed as a concrete entity, which was a kind of rule. And it was also a forbidden act.

Low-level and middle-level spirits couldn't talk to humans about the existence of the spirit king. Therefore, no one knew about the girl.

Except for Akien's group, it was a secret.

"I've never seen a similar existence in history books, and there's no information in the records."

The spirits also had a lifespan, but it was essentially meaningless at the level of the spirit king. It took a long, unrecordable time in human history.

"Some people say that the birth of the highest-level spirit is a myth, or that the first spirit born outside the spirit world is the girl, or that she connects the spirit world and the human world... What's the correct answer?"

"Maybe."

Akien opened her mouth.

"If that's something we shouldn't touch, what do you think?"

"There's a possibility, but... what can we do?"

Marianne smiled wryly.

"We don't have a choice."

The curtains opened. A man dressed in formal attire bowed low.

"Representative of the Akasia family, Mr. Akien. Representative of the Valdika family, Ms. Marianne. Are you both present?"

"Yes."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Yeah."

"If you come this way, I'll be grateful. I'm the representative of the Baruk family. Lord Haskar is calling you."

"A noble person is calling you. Let's go. Akien."

Akien got up with a gloomy face.

* * *

"What kind of palace is this? Why did you decorate this temporary dwelling so lavishly?"

Mariann muttered. The enormous building was before them. Even ordinary families couldn't build something so grand.

As they entered, the inside was even more astonishing. Beautiful patterns and precious decorations were abundant.

They entered even deeper.

When they opened the black door and entered, they saw a round table surrounded by many people.

Most of them were people Mariann knew. They were all individuals born with exceptional family backgrounds, each with their own territory.

Mariann looked around and opened her mouth.

"Is Haskar here?"

"He hasn't come yet."

"It's all a call, but you're late. What's the point of being a noble?"

Mariann sat down in her seat, mumbling.
Here is the translation:

Not long after, the door inside creaked open and a young man appeared.

The man with golden hair was very young, with a face that had just turned twenty. His face was full of confidence.

He believed he was great and that no one could approach him.

As he sat down in a chair, the atmosphere here was the most tense. Although a few people frowned, no one pointed it out. Precisely, they couldn't.

He snapped his fingers.

"Let's get rid of annoying visitors and get straight to the point. Explain it."

The attendant came forward to start explaining.

"You all know that a few months ago, a giant sphere appeared in the Buranian Plain. And there was a girl inside it."

The people couldn't hide their curiosity. The sudden appearance of the giant sphere was astonishing, and it wasn't just that.

"If we approach the sphere, the power of the spirits will become stronger. Rumors even say that a low-level spirit has evolved into a mid-level spirit."
Here is the translation of the text:

When those words were spoken, the people around the table lit up their eyes.

The power of low-ranking and mid-ranking spirits was vastly different from that of the heavens and the earth. Just being near a crystal would lead to evolution, which was a tempting prospect for everyone.

"But, as it is a power that can be obtained without any compensation, chaos will inevitably follow. Therefore, I, my lord, the great Hakasa, have personally suggested an approach to the crystal. It was a brilliant decision."

"What are you trying to do, trying to monopolize everything?"

Marianne's voice was small, but it echoed only in her own mouth.

"Hakasa has conducted various experiments. He has gathered researchers and those who possess information, but they have all failed. So Hakasa has made a single decision."

"This crystal is like a monster, possessing extremely powerful strength."

Hakasa opened his mouth.

"I've tried every means, but I couldn't break through the crystal's defense. I'm lacking in power. That's why I'm thinking of creating a domain."

"Domain?"

Hakasa nodded. The attendant unfolded a large sheet of paper on the table.
Here is the translation of the text:

Marianne scanned the contents written on the paper and scowled.

"What's this? This is an area that doesn't even exist."

"It's the area I created."

Haskell's expression remained unchanged.

"I'm gathering the power of hundreds of spirits. I'll bind them to my spirit and shatter the defensive barrier of the material world."

"That sounds good. But what about the burden of the spirits who are assisting?"

Marianne's tone turned sharp.

"Don't the hundreds of spirits who are taking on supporting roles suffer? And what about the spirits who are forced to be recalled due to their inability to withstand the power? Maybe they can't even be summoned for a long time?"

"So what?"

Haskell looked at her with a questioning gaze, as if asking "So what?" Marianne was enraged.

"Is it okay for the spirits to suffer?"

To them, spirits were not just simple tools. Once bound, they would be companions for a lifetime.

There was no one who enjoyed seeing spirits suffer, especially not in such a trivial role like supporting, and without any compensation or reward, it was even more unbearable.

But Haskell's expression remained unchanged.

"So, then what?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The eldest son of the Valkyr family, Hask. He is the only human who has made a contract with a high-ranking spirit in the world.

"If you're not satisfied, just leave. Then, your family will be destroyed, that's all."

"...I..."

Marianne gritted her teeth but remained silent.

He had a power greater than the king's. If he really wanted to, he could destroy her family anytime.

"That's decided."

Hask nodded his hand.

"I'm going to take a break, so get ready."

It wasn't a proposal, but a one-sided announcement. He left, and sighs and curses echoed from all sides.

Inside, Akiel was quietly looking down at the floor.

* * *

"The weaklings."

Hask spat.

The weak ones.

Those who couldn't even reach his feet were resisting his words. Hask wanted to destroy everything.

But he still had to hold back. He still had a little bit left before he could achieve his goal.

"If I just achieve my goal, I'll kill everything."

[Master.]

The spirit, who was contracted with Hask, sighed beside him.
He was a high-ranking spirit of the earth.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Stop it now. Really. That's something we can't touch."

"Shut up. Follow my orders or get lost."

[Master...?]

A high-ranking spirit whispered to itself.

[Master... really wants that, doesn't he?]

"Yes."

Haskar revealed this.

"I don't want to be satisfied with this narrow world."

To him, Arulia was too weak a world. He wanted to be greater. He wanted to have a stronger power. He wanted to surpass human limits and even surpass the spirits.

"That power is just a simple stepping stone. I'll absorb the power of the earth and become great! And I'll go there!"

Haskar couldn't hold back his anger and shouted.

"A place where great ones gather, where gods sit. The Abyss!"

[Is that Master's wish?]

"Yes!"

The Abyss. A place where heroes and warriors gather. A place where gods gather, and the world can be trampled upon.

Haskar heard about this place from a mysterious storyteller who came to him a few years ago.

At first, he thought it was just a legend and tried to chase him away, but as the storyteller presented evidence, he gradually realized that it was true.
Here is the translation of the text:

Haska was fondling the small sword in his pocket. It was a sword given to him by a storyteller. At first, he thought it was just a rusty old sword and ignored it, but as he took a closer look, he couldn't help but be amazed.

The twisted sword contained a power that could overturn the entire world.

Although it has faded and disappeared over time, and only a remnant remains, Haska knew that once upon a time, just holding this sword was enough to dominate the world.

He said that there were countless such things in the labyrinth.

The labyrinth, a space created by gods and magicians.

As he descended, he grew stronger, and it was also possible to break free from the boundaries of mortality.

Most of them couldn't survive and died as they descended into the labyrinth, but Haska didn't notice this.

He wanted to go to a place where he could surpass his limits and become stronger.

And he wanted to become stronger and stronger, break free from mortality, and achieve his wish.

"'If I can just absorb the power of this sword, I can go to the labyrinth. I'll conquer the labyrinth faster than anyone else there.'"

Note: The text appears to be a fantasy story, and the translation is based on my understanding of the context and language.
Here is the translation of the text:

Haaska screamed with a face full of ecstasy, "And in the end, I'll become the great god that the storyteller said I would!"

[The owner... .]

The high-ranking spirit remained silent.

Haaska was consumed by power.

Only the special bond between Haaska and the high-ranking spirit had taken over his self.

He lost his innocence and became a powerful being, chasing only strength.

However, there was nothing he could do.

Once a contract is made, the spirit becomes bound to a human.

Haaska had to protect him until his death.

[Please regain your composure.]

The high-ranking spirit quietly took his seat.

And the next day arrived.

People created a gloomy atmosphere and went forward, unaware that they were about to attack a mysterious existence that was protecting them.

At that moment, Taesan was playing with the wind king and the wind princess.

"Wow!"

Minerva exclaimed, her face dripping with sweat.

"It's fun!"

"That's it, that's it."

Taesan nodded. Minerva stumbled and stood up.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I want to play, but it's too late now... They're coming, after all."

She smiled wryly.

"They don't know who I am. So I'll forgive them. Because I have children to protect, because I have a life to defend."

The white world receded in the distance. Taesan turned back to reality, leaving behind the last words of the wind spirit king.

"So, just scold me."

Taesan opened his eyes.

Many people were approaching him.

"Shall we get started?"

He stood up and drew his sword.
