Chapter 571

571. The God of Fall, the Usurper (2)

It was the second time I saw the God of Fall.

Its overall shape hadn't changed much from before.

It was enormous, to the point where I couldn't even discern its form.

It had a grotesque appearance, as if all sorts of life forms were forcibly mixed together.

However, there was a difference from before.

I could sense the impurity emanating from its body.

The essence was contaminated by the divine.

"What have you mixed?"

The contamination was different from Levienenov's. It distorted the essence's concept and twisted its principles, but its fundamental nature still remained. It seemed as if two concepts were mixed together.

[...I feel good.]

The essence muttered quietly. The disgusting body trembled.

[Everything is falling to the bottom, and it's all crumbling.]

The universe's concept is collapsing.

Humans become even lower than insects, and insects become nothing in the true sense. Even the powerful ones fall to the level of ordinary humans.

"Everything becomes worthless. Isn't this the correct direction of the universe, I think?"

"It's distorted."

Essence chuckles.

"I also know. I'm a distorted existence. I'm expecting something different from other transcendents.]

What went wrong?

Was the concept of fall itself the problem?

Or was the process of obtaining the concept of fall the problem?

Or was the existence itself the problem?

Whatever the reason, the god of fall was distorted. The result had already been created.

He was truly close to being an evil god.

"[I couldn't reveal myself until now. There were always annoying things getting in the way, so I could only be satisfied with small pranks.]

A strong emotion is felt.

The target was Taesan.

"[But... it's not like that now. You've ruined my small toy, haven't you?]"

"Can't you just take it as a compliment?"

"[Even if you take it that way, it's fine. Thanks to you, I don't have to worry about anything anymore.]"

The god of fall reveals this. His power explodes.

"[I can trample you without a care, now that I've become this powerful!]

Kuuuuuuuuung!

The aura is overwhelming.

The power to bring down all things and crush them to the ground is covering the entire universe.

The universe is in the grasp of the Bardley.

Kwaaaaaaang!

The explosion erupts. The power that transcends boundaries is scattered.

The God of Fall doesn't stop attacking the universe. The distorted power of Fall is overwhelming the universe.

'I've become stronger.'

The God of Fall is a transcendent being who dominates the complete concept.

Among them, it had considerable power. The fact that it had settled in the labyrinth from the beginning was proof of its strength.

However, there was a clear limit. The God of Fall had clashed with the Demon God before and was unable to exert its power fully, getting pushed back.

It was a level that couldn't be reached by even the highest-ranking transcendent beings like the Demon God.

But now, the concept wielded by the God of Fall was strong enough to not be overwhelmed even if it fought the Demon God.

'Is it because it's mixed with the Divine?'

It's extremely unstable, but its aura and concept have been strengthened. I can understand why it could bring down the entire universe.

'But.'

That's all."

The boundary of the great mountain was violently shaken. It swallowed up the power of the falling god and shattered it.

"Not possible."

With a burst of strength, he accelerated. He broke through the whirling power and swung his sword at the god of the fall.

Whoaaa!

The essence's body trembled greatly. A significant crack spread through its body.

The essence had clearly become stronger by mixing with the divine power.

Compared to the demon god, it was at a level that could be considered superior.

But that was as far as it went. The current great mountain could now take down the divine power alone. The level that was once a threat to him was no longer a concern.

"No matter how hard you try, you can't reach me."

The fact that the demon god couldn't surpass him was because it was distorted by mixing with the divine power, but to the great mountain, it was a meaningless aspect. After all, he was standing at the boundary.

Kukukuku......

The essence's trembling body barely regained its balance.

[...It's still impossible.]

The essence muttered. There was no wavering in its voice. It was very calm, as if it had expected this to happen.

[I alone cannot make you fall. Unfortunately... it can't be helped.]

And one presence was felt.

"It was as if it had been there from the beginning, and somehow it was already there.

It was also a distorted and broken existence, similar to essence.

[The plunderer appeared.]

It was the plunderer.

Not just a part of the plunderer, but the true, genuine plunderer itself.

It was there. It wasn't surprising, given that this place was the plunderer's domain from the start. Taesan gazed at the plunderer.

"Is this the first time you've seen it?"

Its basic appearance wasn't much different from a part of the plunderer.

It wasn't human, nor was it a monster. It was a distorted form that couldn't be categorized as belonging to this world or the divine realm.

It was something that transcended the middle.

However, the sense of dignity and concept within it were on a different dimension.

A distorted, lofty dignity.

"It's heteromorphic."

Compared to any divine being he had seen or fought, it possessed a twisted dignity.

The plunderer, who had been quietly observing him, opened its mouth.

[The warehouse keeper bowed.]

"There's no need to be polite. I've gained many things thanks to you."

[Then, is it time to retrieve it now?]

"Try if you can."

Taesan grasped his sword. A boundary arose, surrounding him.

"Two, perhaps."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The God of Decline.

And the Usurper.

The presence of other gods was not felt. It meant that the two of them were the only ones opposing the God of the Mountain.

The collaboration of the God of Decline and the Transcender. It was probably the first time in the long history of the universe.

[No.]

But the Transcender denied the God of the Mountain's words.

[Not two, but one.]

“…….”

The God of the Mountain scowled.

“You.”

[I wish for the decline of all things. I wish for everything to become meaningless and fleeting.]

The God of Decline slowly moved towards the Usurper.

[That's right, I'm no different.]

The Usurper, as if waiting, expanded itself.

Slowly, slowly, it began to incorporate the God of Decline into itself.

Throughout the process, the God of Decline did not resist at all.

It was surrendering itself to the Usurper.

“Really, you're doing it again.”

[Uh, uh, something's weird.]

The God of the Mountain clicked its tongue and charged forward. It had no intention of just watching.

Kuuuuuuung!

But the shockwave pushed the God of the Mountain back.

A rough shockwave, one that destroyed and shook everything, and brought about decline.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The wave that became one with the usurper pushed the great mountain perfectly and blocked all access.

[Oh, oh, oh, oh…….]

The god of downfall let out a sigh.

What did the god of downfall do to reach that point, and what achievements did they attain?

The mortal would not be able to imagine the long time and numerous accomplishments that existed. What they built was something that could influence the universe on a cosmic scale.

Everything became a part of the usurper, losing all meaning and value.

The being itself began to fall, becoming even more wretched than an insect.

It was an extremely horrific and pitiful event, even on a universal scale.

But the god of downfall was more ecstatic than anyone.

[My…… downfall…… my end…….]

They were truly rejoicing at their own downfall.

"You're crazy."

He was a being more distorted than anyone had expected.

Kukukukuku…….

The usurper engulfed the god of downfall, erasing their existence completely.

The god of downfall has now ceased to exist.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The being that had long ruled the concept of fall in the universe was completely devoured by the usurper.

"There was no change until the end."

The god of fall remained the god of fall until the end.

Ku ku ku ku.

The concept of fall begins to be assimilated into the usurper's. It perfectly transforms into the usurper's possession.

It wasn't just a matter of storing it in a treasure trove. The concept of fall itself was perfectly dyed into the usurper's. The usurper gained complete control and dominion over the universe's concept.

It was like a majestic mountain.

The concept of fall was tainted by darkness.

"Is that so?"

Arilnan is the god of circulation, governing the circulation of the universe itself. His strength was clearly superior to that of Lakiratas.

Moreover, the usurper at that time did not possess many concepts of the universe.

Yet, the usurper defeated Arilnan and usurped that concept.

I have now discovered the reason.

Arilnan said that the usurper could temporarily swallow the entire world whole.

The concept of fall was perfectly assimilated into the usurper's, becoming their own.

It was like gazing at a majestic mountain.

Kkkkkk.

The usurper wields their power.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The dark fall that has been dyed black, covers the great mountain. The great mountain reveals its boundary.

Kuuuuuuung!

The boundary, mixed with the dark fall, collides with each other.

And, they cancel each other out.

Until now, nothing has been able to block the boundary. It has either been crushed by an overwhelming amount of power or ignored altogether.

But now, the boundary has collided and been destroyed.

[You are a being that originated from me.]

The usurper laughs.

[There's no reason why you can't do what I can do.]

"It seems like you're longing for me fiercely, despite being like that."

[By devouring you, I can become even more complete.]

The usurper's body trembles. The body that has devoured the complete fall is shaking anxiously.

In the end, it's unstable. That too.

It can be endured, but not for long.

[You are mine.]

"That's a sound I've heard too many times."

This is the usurper's domain.

The domain itself is attached to the great mountain. The dark fall is trying to bring down his spirit and body.

That's a distorted complete fall. It can literally cover the universe and contaminate it.

"It was a concept that distorted the universe.

If I were to handle it, I would surely be superior to all beings in the universe.

But.

"So what?"

Taesan pulls out the boundary. He brandishes his ash-colored sword.

Whoa!

Taesan tries to devour the black downfall and the boundary, but they cancel each other out.

Even after that, Taesan tries to devour it again, but the boundary's negation repels and rejects him.

The plunderer is undoubtedly strong, like a monster.

With that power, I could devour even the transcenders of the universe.

But Taesan also had similar power to the plunderer. There's no reason to back down, whether it's a stalemate or superiority.

"You're just a devourer. Your own authority doesn't exist."

If I simply contaminated the downfall and handled it, I couldn't reach Taesan.

I pull out the boundary. I expel the downfall and accelerate rapidly to stab the plunderer with my sword.

[I also know. Even if I handle this, I won't be able to bring you down.]

The plunderer spoke calmly.

It's wavering, and the anomaly appears.

Kuuuuung!

The downfall converges into one."

"The concept of collapse is gathered into a small sphere.

It's rushing towards the towering mountain, spinning wildly.

A very small sphere.

But it was everything.

The mountain pulled out the abyss. The abyss and collapse touched.

Whoa!

The collision sound spreads.

The abyss cannot withstand the collapse and distorts. If this continues, the abyss will shatter. The mountain quickly judges and retrieves the abyss, throwing its body.

At that moment, the sphere of collapse expands. In an instant, it engulfs the domain and spits it out. The boundary that surrounded the mountain is instantly consumed.

The mountain called out to the beast of the boundary.

Kuuuuung!

As the beast of the boundary, it forcibly breaks out of the domain of collapse.

“…….”

The mountain scowled.

What the usurper had wielded was authority.

But it wasn't a concept of the universe. Nor was it the usurper's authority.

The mountain realized.

“You. You've devoured another god, haven't you.”"
