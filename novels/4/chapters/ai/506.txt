**Episode 507**

507. 93rd Floor, Demons (6)

A massive, heavy, and strange power.

It slowly settles within Taesan, transforming into his own. Baal lets out a sly smile at the sight of Taesan effortlessly wielding the power.

[Even though it's a concept that can't be accepted in this world, he's handling it as if it were originally his.]

"Is this high-grade dark magic?"

[That's what it's called. Are you satisfied?]

"......It's quite impressive."

During the process of acquiring the skill, Taesan had grasped the level of power and intensity. That's why he couldn't help but feel puzzled.

"Is this level of power considered high-grade?"

[Can't it be compared to Zelvand's?]

Baal laughed as if asking a question.

Taesan couldn't deny his words.

Taesan possessed high-grade magic, including destruction and teleportation. Both were extremely powerful magic.

However, high-grade dark magic was even more powerful.

Although they shared the same "high-grade" title, it was clearly superior.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"From the start, there is no such thing as high-level dark magic. I just defined my power according to the concepts of this world, and that's why it got that name. If you compare it to the magic created by Zelvand and the power that originated from my roots, it's not even comparable."

"Thank you."

With this, it will definitely be a big help in future battles as well. But now, I've become curious about something.

"Is there nothing beyond high-level magic?"

"There isn't nothing. It definitely exists. But that's a fundamental part of us. It's a concept that can't be given to others, so don't worry about it."

Baal smiled faintly.

"More than anyone, you'll be able to reach that realm on your own soon enough."

"……Thank you."

"Then, let's slowly head back. It's not good to stay here for too long."

Baal clenched his fist, about to transcend space. Suddenly, Taesan thought of something and asked Baal.

"One thing. Can I ask?"

"What is it?"

"Why did you betray them?"

Baal was originally a being similar to a high god.

But he betrayed the high gods and sided with the Transcendents.

There must be a clear reason for that. Baal replied calmly to Taesan's question.

"It's nothing much. A simple, extremely personal reason."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If it's personal..."

[Even someone like me, who has emotions, can't control their own heart.]

The quiet words changed the world.

Blame.

Taesan landed on the ground with a solid thud. A firm sensation spread from his feet.

The place they arrived at was the Demon Realm.

And as soon as they arrived, the space opened up, and a girl appeared.

[Taesan.]

"You're the Demon God."

Taesan bowed politely to her. For a moment, her face, which had been examining Taesan, relaxed.

[It doesn't seem to be a problem.] [This is frustrating. You don't trust me, do you, Demon God? I wanted to follow you from the start, but it's a matter between you demons, so I couldn't intervene.]

The Demon God sent a pleased smile towards Taesan.

[You've worked hard, Taesan. Thanks to you, I can finally erase the things that have been bothering me.] [If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have been able to do it, so I'd like you to give me some credit.] [It's noisy.]

The Demon God muttered to herself while glancing at Baal.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Anyway... thanks to you. If you hadn't cooperated, it would have been impossible. I'll at least say this much.] [That's very much appreciated.]"

Baal smiled leisurely, with an attitude similar to that of an adult dealing with a whiny child.

As I had felt before, Baal had a fondness for Mashin.

And it was similar to how a parent treats their child.

"...Mashin is a created god, isn't it?"

The demon tribe had forcibly made a young and small child into a vessel for the god, which became Lucifer.

Then, what did Baal do when Lucifer was born?

"[Then I'll just go back now.]"

Baal clapped his hands and opened up a space.

"[The rest is for the two of you to discuss directly. Let's meet again later.]"

Baal said that and returned to his own domain. Mashin slowly descended to the ground.

"[How do you feel?]"

"I'm quite surprised."

The quest itself didn't have any particular excitement. From the moment I first encountered the demons at the meeting, I had predicted that it would end with a haha-hoho atmosphere. But the truth I learned afterwards made me think deeply, just like Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"How long can you hold out?"

[I don't know. It's weakening rapidly, but... it's a seal that we all created together. Maybe it'll hold out for a long time from now on. Or maybe it'll break tomorrow. You should be aware of that too.]

Mashin looks at Taesan. His cat-like eyes gaze at Taesan.

[The gods are still targeting you.]

"Wasn't the purpose of their seal to break it? If it's weakening, then I'm not needed anymore."

[I thought so too, but it seems like they're still moving with you as their target.]

"……."

Taesan's eyes droop. Mashin says not to worry.

[Don't worry. We've already won against them. The losers aren't scary anymore.]

Mashin changes his expression and applauds.

[Anyway, congratulations. You've obtained all the demons' territories? How does it feel?]

"It's amazing. I can't put it into words."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[It's all yours from now on. The dark magic has disappeared, and there will be confusion, but Baal and I will take care of it. There will be losses, but... it's not irreparable.]

Mashin smiled at Taesan with a hint of mischief.

[Let's organize the power you've obtained. Honestly, I've never seen a domain gathered like that before. I'm curious about how it will change. Anyway, this quest is over with this.] [Quest Clear.] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [You have obtained a fragment of darkening light.] [You have obtained ???.]

Taesan's body was pulled into the labyrinth. As Taesan departed, Mashin said with a hint of regret.

[I want to talk more, but... I have a lot to do, so I can't. Let's meet again later, Taesan.]

And Taesan returned to the labyrinth. The familiar walls of the labyrinth welcomed Taesan back.

The 93rd floor was finally over.

Taesan sat down, exhausted.

* * *

[What, what's going on.]

Bardley and Akasha, who were freed late, were flustered.

[What happened?]"

Note: There are some parts that are unclear or seem to be missing context, so the translation may not be perfect. Additionally, the ??? in the text suggests that there is some unknown or untranslatable term, which I left as is.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan explained what he had seen to the two of them. Bardray and Akasha were left speechless after hearing the story.

[... Is that real?]

"Of course it's true, I saw it with my own eyes."

[Uh, um.]

Bardray couldn't shake off his confusion. After being stunned for a while, he let out a deep sigh.

[... It would have been better if I didn't know.]

There was a hint of resentment towards Taesan in his voice.

[The scale is too big. Just imagining it is making me feel like I'm going crazy.]

"That's how it is."

[Of course! It's an event that affects the entire universe!] [It's... really dangerous. I'm getting a little dizzy too.]

"I see."

Bardray spoke in a tone that was both amazed and frightened.

"Why are you so calm? If things go wrong, the entire universe could be destroyed, and we'd be left with nothing.]

"Now that you mention it."

The conflict between the Transcendent and the High God had been clear from the start. In fact, he himself had been the key to freeing the High God. It was surprising, but not frightening.

He was simply preparing for the possibility of what might happen.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And to do that, I needed to become stronger than I am now. Taesan confirmed the reward.

[A dark, gloomy light fragment] [A fragment of something that shines brightly despite being extremely dark. It has contradictory power.]

The clear reward of the 93rd floor was a material. Despite being extremely dark, it was shining brightly.

And the ??? reward was similar to that.

[I used ???.] [I obtained a shining dark light fragment.] [Shining dark light fragment] [A fragment of a realm that absorbs everything, shining extremely brightly despite being extremely dark. It has contradictory power.]

Despite being darkness, it didn't absorb light and was shining brightly, allowing me to distinguish between objects.

Taesan had seen this in Baal's realm.

It was a part of the realm he possessed.

"Is this also a reward?"

The level was quite high. It was a meaningful material even for the current Taesan.

How should I handle this? Taesan pondered for a moment, observing what he had newly obtained.

A vast, wide collection of all evil remaining in the universe."

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was all up to Taesan's mind how to handle this. He could use it to wield black magic, or create something entirely different.

And one possibility was flashing through Taesan's mind.

Demons were ultimately similar to gods.

Then, their realm could also be dyed with the black color that Taesan possessed. He had already confirmed it himself.

Then, why not expand on that possibility and transcend the boundaries?

It was still a possibility, and not impossible. Taesan organized his thoughts and opened his skill window.

[High-Rank Black Magic: Baal's Shattered Fragment] [Mana Consumption: 30,000] [Basic Mana Consumption: 5,000] [Proficiency: 1%] [Summons a fragment of Baal's essence, which was shattered during the process of betraying his own nature.]

"This is crazy."

The mana consumption was laughable. 30,000 mana, six times the amount needed for a great destruction. The basic mana consumption was also a whopping 5,000.

Taesan's original mana capacity didn't exceed 3,000. Normally, it would be impossible to use, but it was different now. His mana had increased exponentially while dealing with demons."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, it wasn't a consumable value that could be easily used.

Just by looking at it, it was impossible to determine what kind of effect it had. The mana and magic seemed to be drained away.

[You activated a fragment of Baal's broken piece.]

Kiiing.

A black jewel appeared on Taesan's hand.

But nothing happened. The jewel didn't have any influence on its surroundings and quietly stayed on his hand.

It was too quiet, and Bardley was taken aback.

[...How do I use this thing?]

Taesan gazed at the jewel with a puzzled expression.

It was a beautiful, shattered piece, like a broken black crystal.

[You activated Complete Surveillance.] [You activated Essence Analysis.] [Something that Baal, the being, had when it was born.] [One of the fundamental things it had before it was abandoned.] [The universe cannot accept its existence.]

A tremendous amount of information flashed by. And among them, Taesan obtained the information he wanted.

[It's a channel that amplifies power.]

'A channel?'

This jewel is a power channel.

Then...

Taesan placed his finger on the jewel.

[You activated Ice Arrow.]

Zzzip.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But I don't know what level of amplification it is, but as a high-ranking dark mage, it's not ordinary. So, I thought I'd try to confirm it with a beginner's magic spell.

The frost arrow touches the jewel.

And the frost arrow starts to turn black.

Whoa!

The air condenses. The thick, dark frost amplifies in an instant, covering everything around.

[What?]

Bardley is shocked in an instant. The frost arrow suddenly grows in size, trying to cover the labyrinth.

Whoa!

Cracks appear on the floor of the labyrinth, and fissures spread on the walls.

[Again!]

The belatedly appearing Balbambara tries to stop the spreading dark frost with the power given to him.

Whoa!

But it doesn't work.

The dark frost freezes everything. It's not the power of a beginner's magic spell.

It was the moment when Taesan was about to quickly draw the boundary line to contain it.

"This again. I've obtained something amazing."

The wizard's voice echoed. At the same time, the space began to compress.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

The dark frost invading the labyrinth, like something trapped in a box, slowly begins to compress. The frost that filled the room soon shrinks to the size of a small box.

The wizard, who appeared by tearing through space, picked up the box.

"Hmm."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The magician, who had examined the inside of the box, wore a faint smile.

"That's what Baal threw away. That piece went to you."

"I know."

"I fought him once, so I can't not know."

The magician opened the space and put the box away.

"That's a very dangerous power, so it's better to handle it with care."

"I'll do that."

"Then go back. Balbambara."

[Ugh, really. Dammit.]

Balbambara barely suppressed his emotions and went back. The magician chuckled.

"So, how was it? You seem to know a lot."

"I'm just doing my job."

Taesan said calmly. Nothing had changed. His goal was to save the Earth and drive out the invading Goshin. That was all.

The magician was pleased with Taesan's attitude.

"You're good enough. That's sufficient."

"Do you feel uneasy about this? Sorry about that."

"That's true, but... it doesn't matter. There was a reason for me to come anyway."

The magician was extremely delighted. His emotions were visible at a glance.

One possibility flashed through Taesan's mind.

"Maybe..."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It looks like I've caught on. Yeah."

The magician opened their hand.

On top of it, a white gemstone was placed.

"I had a hard time, but it's finally done."

An item that Taesan, the magician, had commissioned to be made using the scales of Uroboros.

It's now complete.
