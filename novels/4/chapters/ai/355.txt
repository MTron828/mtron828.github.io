**Chapter 356**

**356. The Guides of Evil on the 76th Floor (1)**

One. Two. Three. Four.

There were a total of eight guides standing in front of Taesan.

[This is quite something. Familiar faces.]

The ghost murmured, and the guides also looked at the ghost.

"Hello."

"Hero."

Two women spoke, their faces identical except for their hair and eye colors, which were black and white.

[Black and white twins. Like Cliff... there are many like that.]

The ghost examined them one by one and spoke in a cold voice.

[There's no Sohee.]

"She refused."

A young man with white hair stepped forward, representing the group.

"I will find my own way."

[Helia, did you lead them?]

"I can't stand to see any more of this despicable behavior."

Helia gazed at Taesan with contempt.

"You, who had a great bloodline, have fallen as low as you can. You're seeking revenge by clinging to someone with unknown origins, aren't you?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There's no Sosiet, no Ambresia, no Lion King... all those guys I wanted to see are gone. Do it yourself. Taesan."

The ghost muttered to himself. It wasn't an attitude that took Helia's words seriously.

Helia scowled at the ghost's attitude, but a muscular man stepped forward.

"It's done. As he said, he's already dead. There's nothing to worry about."

"......Hmph."

Helia composed himself and looked at Taesan again.

"Then die. You're pathetic."

As Helia nodded, the guides jumped out and surrounded Taesan. There was no escape, a perfect encirclement.

The muscular man, Kwonsung Altair, opened his mouth.

"Gods are capricious by nature. Don't be too disappointed. I've been in a similar situation too. To the gods, mortals are just toys."

Taesan realized.

The sinful guides thought Taesan had been abandoned by Mashin.

The reason was easy to guess. Altair said with a completely unapologetic face, as if feeling sorry.

"A restriction on recovery? Honestly, it's too much to ask."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The demon god appeared before them. At first, she was terrified by the demon god's sudden appearance and thought he was going to crush her will, but the demon god's next words made their eyes widen in surprise.

The demon god said that when he fought against Taesan, he would not receive the level-up recovery effect even if he defeated them, and that this restriction would be added.

They couldn't understand.

In battles between adventurers, level-ups were essential, especially in one-on-one fights. They would defeat one, level up, and then defeat another to level up again. If they didn't do this, they would never win.

But the demon god had blocked this.

At that moment, they were convinced. The demon god had abandoned Taesan.

Otherwise, there was no reason to impose such a restriction.

The guides' faces were filled with confidence.

They believed they could definitely win against Taesan.

"Don't resent us. If you want to, do it to the demon god."

With those words, the guides unleashed their diverse powers.

"I won't do it to anyone."

Taesan muttered.

"There's no point in doing so."

The powers contained within were a collection of forces that even Taesan found difficult to counter. If they fought head-on, they would likely lose with high probability.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Of course, it didn't matter to Taesan.

As he gazed at the overwhelming power, Taesan drew his sword.

[You have activated Forced Duel. For 12 seconds, you will be immune to damage from anyone except Floria.]

The pouring power vanished the moment it touched Taesan.

"...What?"

"Huh?"

The guides who had been trying to predict Taesan's movements and respond accordingly froze.

Their powers were erased.

Taesan had only responded to one thing: Floria's attack.

"Forced Duel?"

"Let's try it."

[You have activated Sadohwa [Darkness and Chaos].] [You have activated the Avatar of Nature.] [You have activated the King's Vessel.] [The enemy who stepped on your deepest place has been activated.]

Taesan took a step back. The guides were shocked and jumped back.

* * *

"Ah, ah!"

A tall, blue-haired man. Floria was shocked and jumped back. In an instant, his body accelerated, putting distance between himself and Taesan.

And Taesan chased after Floria.

Floria was certainly fast, but not fast enough to shake Taesan off.

[You have activated Strong Strike.]

Ka-boom!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ugh!"

The sword clashed, and Floria let out a loud cry. The weight of the sword felt unbearable.

Floria shouted desperately.

"Do whatever you want!"

"That's what I'll do!"

The other guides were also desperate.

A massive amount of power was pouring into the 76th floor.

But it couldn't reach Taesan.

[You have activated a forced duel. For 12 seconds, you will be immune to damage from anyone except Floria.]

The forced duel was reactivated, and the power of the other guides was completely erased. Only Floria's power reached Taesan.

"What kind of skill is that!"

Altiaer shouted in disbelief. The effect of the forced duel appeared in the system window. They also knew what was happening.

"It's impossible! How can you have a skill like that!"

Attack invalidation, absolute judgment, endurance, and other unreasonable skills that Taesan possessed - they knew about those too.

But they couldn't even imagine a skill like the forced duel. What was that skill, anyway? Didn't it mean that numerical superiority was useless?
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Altiaar, filled with deceit, threw a punch. The powerful wind covered the Taesan. It was an attack that even Taesan had to move his body to block.

But the moment it landed, it was immediately erased.

In the end, Altiaar let out a hollow laugh.

"......That's right."

Helia, who had barely regained her composure, twisted her face in frustration.

"It wasn't something the gods abandoned."

The Forced Duel skill had restrictions on recovery, but it was enough to win because they could overcome it.

They had planned to use the group's power to take down Taesan.

But due to the Forced Duel, the plan itself was twisted.

"Let's change the plan."

Helia made a quick judgment.

They were deep-level adventurers who had overcome all sorts of variables and irrationalities. Even in the midst of chaos, they could find an answer.

"It's impossible to attack as a group. Let's fight one-on-one and stall for as much time as possible."

"Stall for time?"

"That means creating a consumption rate."

The other guides also realized it.

Taesan couldn't recover from the power consumed during battle.

They wouldn't give them a chance to drink a potion.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If you keep attacking, you can consume skills that have health, mana, or cooldowns.

By consuming one or two cards, you can increase the chances of winning for the next fighter.

They realized that this was the correct answer, but no one was happy about it.

"...How pathetic."

Altiaer let out a wry smile.

They had abandoned their pride and gathered eight people to kill Taesan.

But even after abandoning their pride, they had almost given up on winning and were just stalling for time.

Their pride, which had been trampled, was shattered.

Helia twisted her lips.

"Pride is less important than winning. You don't have to follow my words. Fight as you want."

Even as they were coming to a conclusion, Taesan and Floria continued to fight.

"Damn it!"

Floria also realized that no one except herself and Taesan could intervene. She gritted her teeth and tightly grasped her dagger.

"Don't laugh!"

Taesan was undoubtedly strong.

But he was also an adventurer who had been trampled by the depths.

He had won multiple times in unfair and unwinnable situations to arrive at this point."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A system window appeared before Floria's eyes.

[The opponent is an unbeatable enemy.] [Your righteous duel has been activated.] [Your battle instinct has been activated.] [Your unyielding spirit has been activated.]

As soon as the enemy judgment skill was activated, Floria's entire body accelerated.

Floria placed her hand on the ground. It was the moment when Taesan was about to accelerate and stab his sword into Floria's neck.

[Floria activated her designated acceleration mark.]

Floria's body disappeared.

There was no warning, no manifestation of power.

Floria, who had moved behind Taesan, stabbed him.

[Your first attack absolute nullification has been activated.]

Taesan quickly turned his body and swung his sword, but Floria was no longer there.

[Floria activated her designated acceleration mark again.]

Floria moved behind Taesan once more.

This time, Taesan did not take it lying down. He twisted his waist and swung his sword at Floria, who was stabbing him with a dagger.

Floria's body became blurry and left an afterimage.

[Floria activated her erased shadow.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The sword brushes past Floria and passes by.

His sword pierces through Taesan.

[Your second attack has been absolutely nullified.] [Floria has activated her designated mark acceleration.]

But in the end, Taesan allowed a single blow to land.

Floria, who had retreated, revealed this.

"You may be strong, but... that alone is not enough to win in battle."

Floria knows Taesan's information. Taesan does not know Floria's information.

The difference was enormous. The one who had stepped into the depths had their own abilities, and it was impossible for Taesan to perfectly counter them.

But that was all.

Taesan takes a step forward. Floria grits her teeth and responds.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

She barely blocks the swinging sword.

Floria was slower than Taesan.

The stat difference was overwhelming, so it was only natural. But Floria did not easily back down against Taesan.

[Floria has activated her designated mark acceleration.]

Floria's body moves to the edge of the room. Taesan tries to catch up, jumping into the air, and Floria appears right beneath Taesan's feet.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Your third absolute nullification of attack has been activated.]

Floria quickly creates distance.

'Good!'

I've consumed all the attack nullifications. Taesan doesn't properly understand his own power.

I can win.

This is the moment Floria gains confidence.

"I roughly understand."

Taesan didn't thoughtlessly consume three attack nullifications. He was analyzing Floria's designated marker acceleration skill.

"It's not spatial leap."

There's no cooldown for movement. The consumption value doesn't seem to be high either.

Limited Blink, a mid-level magic, has a 10-minute cooldown. It means that spatial movement is extremely difficult. It didn't seem like something that could be used so easily.

And Floria was only moving while attached to the ground. Taesan could see that even though he was in mid-air, Floria moved to his feet.

Taesan continued to analyze while blocking Floria's repeated attacks.

[You have activated concentrated detection.] [You have activated reconnaissance.]

The power of detection spreads out.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As a result, Taesan realized that something was engraved on the floor of the labyrinth.

'Location designation.'

He can only move to a predetermined location.

Taesan summoned his magic.

[You have activated the distorted ecosystem of Dekaravia.]

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The roots burst through the space and appeared, restricting the movement to a specific area.

Floria's face stiffened. Taesan rushed towards him in an instant.

Ka-aa-ang!

"Kueeek!"

Floria couldn't escape the designated marker acceleration as usual.

'As expected.'

He moved to the designated marker. However, it wasn't a spatial movement. It was a movement so fast that it seemed to fill the space, creating restrictions.

In other words, it was a physical movement that could create restrictions by filling the space itself.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

Floria was pushed back in an instant.

Taesan had also predicted the thoughts of the guides. He planned to buy time and consume the cards he had.

So, Taesan quickly grasped the opponent's hand and responded with a countermeasure, winning with minimal consumption."

Note: The text appears to be a passage from a fantasy novel or game, with elements of magic, spatial movement, and strategy.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Tae-san had an enormous number of cards. No matter what his opponent used, he could pull out a card that could counter it, it was that much.

There was no problem.

Tae-san infused power into his sword. Floria flew far away, repelled."

Note: "태산" is a Korean name, and "플로리아" is likely a proper noun, possibly a character's name.
