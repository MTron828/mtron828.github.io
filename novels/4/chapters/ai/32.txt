Episode 33

33. 4th Floor, God of Victory. Balta Zahar (2)

[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Can I take it?]
[Kang Taesan [Alone]: It's likely that Itaeyeon would refuse, but you're quite proactive. It should work out. But I'm not sure either. What I received could be something else.]

* * *

[Shut up.]

The ghost spoke sharply. However, his voice lacked the previous strength. Something seemed to have drained away.

Noticing this, the dwarf chuckled.

"You're a stuck being. Don't forget that."

"Just stop it already."

Taesan waved his hand with an annoyed expression.

"Why do we have such a bad relationship?"

"Should we hold hands and play pretend here? This place is full of those confined by limits. It's hard to find someone on good terms."

The dwarf grimaced in annoyance.

"If there's nothing else to do, go down now. I'm tired of looking at him."

"Understood."

There's nothing to gain right now anyway. Taesan descended into the labyrinth. The ghost remained silent.

* * *

4th Floor.

She had heard about this place from Itaeyeon.

"They called it the Orc's floor."

After rats come goblins. After goblins come orcs. It was a somewhat conventional arrangement.

Orcs.

Players referred to them as the warrior race. Each one possessed a strong physique and strength, displaying exceptional combat skills.

Yet their intelligence wasn't lacking. They were also quite agile. In the labyrinth, they were rare all-round monsters; in Easy Mode, they were considered bosses only from the middle layers and above.

Each of them roamed around the entire floor.

Itaeyeon's method of passing through the 4th floor was simple. She heavily relied on molotov cocktails and oil. She used them until she reached deep into the adversaries that could be eaten.

Taesan arrived in the room.

There was an altar there.

[You have found the altar of Balta Zahar.

[First Discovery Bonus] [Intelligence has permanently increased by 1. Mana has permanently increased by 2.

'As the story goes.'
Upon hearing from Itaeyeon, Taesan calmly confirms. Standing tall and reaching up to the ceiling, a conspicuous spire catches his eye. Taesan places his hand on the altar.

[Altar of Balta Zahar] [An altar created by those who serve Balta Zahar. It serves as a conduit connected to the divine. Balta Zahar can exert influence through this place.]

The basic information was identical to that of the Altar of Rakyrathas. Balta Zahar. If Itaeyeon's words were true, dominance over this area means victory.

"The God of Victory. Balta Zahar."

"Do you know?"

"He's not a bad god. Not exactly good either. Just an average god?"

Power gathers at the altar. Beyond space, something is sensed, observing this place.

Unlike Rakyrathas, it wasn't slimy or dark. It was a gathering of violently forceful power that tolerated nothing.

[Subquest Initiated] [Balta Zahar wishes to test you, who have come to his altar. If you accept, trials will come to you. Overcome them, and rewards will follow.] [Reward: Determined by Balta Zahar based on your achievements.]

Similarly, there was no information about the trials. Itaeyeon had avoided every altar she encountered.

But there was no reason to refuse.

Taesan accepted the quest.
[Subquest Initiated] [Balta Zahar delights in your choice.] [Balta Zahar reads your experiences.]

Following the system prompt, Taesan frowned.

"He reads them?"

"He's the God of Victory. He reads your memories and experiences to determine your worth. If he judges you as worthless, he might not give you the quest or even discard it. Well, I don't think you'll have a problem."

The ghost's words proved true.

Shortly after, a powerful force beyond surged violently. It eventually stabilized as if in contentment.

Then another window appeared before Taesan.

[Balta Zahar's interference area diminishes.] [Balta Zahar proposes enhanced trials for you.]

Taesan hesitated. The ghost seemed to have anticipated this.

"Ha. Diminishing his area while proposing trials? Sure, Balta Zahar wouldn't dislike seeing you."

Taesan pondered as he looked at the system window. Based on his experience with Rakyrathas, he understood that gods could be capricious. Facing enhanced trials wouldn't be easy.

The ghost reassured him of his concerns.

"Worried about the enhanced trials?"

"I've dealt with Rakyrathas before, so..."

Translated from Korean.
[...He even suggested that. You. And survived.]

The ghost's voice contained an indiscernible emotion. Eventually, he began speaking calmly.

[You can accept it. You should be able to clear it now.]

"I almost died with Rakyrathas."

[That's just Rakyrathas. That god is capricious. Even if you had fought and died, it would have been satisfactory to him, so he wouldn't have cared.]

Rakyrathas oversees struggle and death. Whether Taesan fought and died, both would have been fulfilled. The opposite would have been true as well.

That's one reason why Rakyrathas is free to act.

[Maybe you suddenly got stronger during the siren call?]

"How did you know?"

[Because he's capricious. I expected it, but I didn't really know.]

The ghost spoke hesitantly.

[Gods fundamentally dislike breaking contracts. Even if it's an ant-like human, or rather, precisely because of that, they dislike it even more. The moment they taste falsehood, they feel their own dignity diminish.]


So the conclusion was that there was no problem, according to the ghost's judgment. Taesan, after a moment of consideration, nodded his head.

"I'll accept the quest."

The rewards from the gods were certain. Even if Rakyrathas had its difficulties, it always provided sufficient rewards.

Accepting it would clearly make him stronger. Following the ghost's words, the gods did not utter falsehoods. Therefore, there was no reason to refuse.

[Subquest initiated.] [Balatazaha is greatly pleased.] [Balatazaha's interference zone diminishes.] [Balatazaha gains acceptance from residents of floors 4 and 5.] [. . .] [Approval 20. Disapproval 1.] [Floor 4 undergoes changes.]

Suddenly, a terrifyingly loud collision echoed as the system window appeared. For a moment, the ground shook. Taesan quickly crouched to steady himself.

Thud! Thud!

The loud noises continued. The vibrations felt through the floor and walls suggested something significant was happening.

"What's going on?"

A few seconds later, the vibrations ceased. The system window appeared.

[Balatazaha's Trial: Conquer the transformed floors 4 and 5.]

"Transformed?"

"Um... This is the first time I've seen this too."
The expression on his face was that of someone who had never experienced a ghost before. Taesan opened the door and moved on to the next room. It was only then that he could understand what the vibration was.

[Wow.]

This place took the form of a labyrinth. Corridors interconnected and rooms flowed organically. Floor 4 didn't seem much different.

But now, changes had occurred here.

A corridor was visible at the far end.

"It seems to have turned into a straight line."

Floor 4 had transformed not into a labyrinth, but into a straight line, with rooms extending in a linear fashion.

* * *

The labyrinth itself had changed. And not just one room, but the entire floor.

"Is this even possible?"

Taesan knew how solid the walls of the labyrinth were. Through many experiences, he understood how firm the concept of floors was in this place.

But even he had never heard of changing the floor itself.

[The opponent is a god involved in creating the labyrinth. It's not impossible, but... it's surprising. Was this even possible?]

Even the ghost seemed quite astonished, encountering something new for the first time. Taesan looked around the room. There wasn't much change to the room itself.

"Alright."

Then the task hadn't changed either.

As Taesan moved towards the room, the ghost was surprised.

"Going straight there?"
"I'm not here just to be stuck."

[...Fair enough.]

Taesan passed through the room and entered the next. There, there was an orc.

"Big."

Three times the size of an average person. The orc, sitting down, opened its eyes as Taesan entered. It looked at Taesan and grinned.

"Kurk."

The orc raised its sword.

"An orc with a sword appeared."

There was only one orc in the room. It seemed to want a fair fight.

"Accepted."

Twenty in favor. And one opposed.

Seemed like Taesan understood the meaning.

Taesan drew out Rakyritas's sword and shield. The orc, confirming Taesan's readiness, charged forward. As if it needed nothing more than to swing its sword down.

*Kaaang!*

The swords clashed. Taesan pushed it back. The orc staggered, but quickly regained its stance.

Definitely stronger than a goblin. In terms of strength, it wasn't significantly inferior to Taesan.

"Kurk!"

The orc swung its sword. Taesan blocked it with his shield.

"You take 4 damage."
The current damage, with a health of over 400, was largely meaningless. Taesan casually opened his status window to check.

[Shield 6/10]

His shield was worn down. Recognizing that the shield took damage before his health, Taesan moved his sword. The orc moved to counter.

"Stronger than I thought."

No openings. Taesan knew this from facing orcs in his previous world. They were definitely stronger now than back then.

[Trial of the Gods. Seems like we're meant to fight this one-on-one to the end. Naturally, the enemies must be reinforced accordingly.]

Clang.

Taesan's arm was pushed down. The orc exerted more force. Taesan briefly pulled his arm back and then pushed forward.

Boom!

"Kurk!"

The orc staggered back. Taesan immediately closed the distance.

"You triggered a combo attack. The next attack will be used twice." "You triggered a power strike. The next attack deals significant damage." "34 damage to the orc with the sword." "22 damage to the orc with the sword."

The combo attack included only basic attacks. Thanks to it, Taesan could clearly confirm the difference between a power strike and regular damage.

Taesan used 6 mana and dealt 34 damage.
‘One mana for two.’ 

It wasn't a bad ratio. As proficiency increased, the ratio would likely improve further.

"Kurk!"

The orc pushed Taesan back and swung its sword. Taesan dodged lightly and stabbed at its neck. After a few more swings of his sword, the orc fell.

"Kuruk...."

Satisfaction was evident on its face.

[You have defeated the orc wielding a sword.] [Your vigor has been activated. Strength permanently increases by 1.]

Strength for an orc made sense. It was a reasonable increase.

"Not too difficult."

"If it's difficult for you now with your stats, it doesn't make sense. It seems to be getting harder as you go up."

It was a sort of stage. The initial orc was the weakest enemy. As he progressed through the rooms, stronger orcs would appear.

Considering the number of approval, there would be ten rooms on one floor. 

Taesan went inside.

* * *

The sword has a quick, solid, was
[You have defeated an orc wielding a sword.] [Your level has increased.] [As a level-up reward, your health has increased by 20.] [Permanently, your strength has increased by 3, agility has increased by 4, and mana has increased by 1.]

After clearing five orc rooms, my level increased. Perhaps due to the enhanced challenge of the orcs, my experience points seemed to have risen as well.

"Considering the fuss, it wasn't much. I got surprised for nothing."

Despite their enhancements, they weren't enough to stop me. With the dungeon now linear, unnecessary detours vanished, allowing for faster clears. The ghost seemed to express disbelief.

"So, that's how you describe divine power. Quite something."

"Isn't it?"

"...Well, yeah."

For Taesan, not much had drastically changed yet. It was mostly a matter of the path altering. Even with the changes, there wasn't much thrill to the defection. He had experienced something similar before.

The ghost grumbled softly. Taesan checked the equipment he had acquired.

[Thick Ankle Guard] [Defense +3] [Seems like it can withstand many attacks. Doesn't seem to block weapons.]

Defense 3. It was a fairly high number. The ankle guard he was currently wearing had a defense of 1, so this was an increase of 2.

And weapons...
[Rugged Spear] [Attack Power + 4] [It's a spear. It seems quite painful if you stab with it.]

It was a straightforward description. It was the first spear he acquired, and it had a high attack power.

Here, the variety of weapons was also a great strength. There would inevitably be occasions to use the spear. Taesan placed the spear in his inventory and checked his status window.

[강태산] [Level: 13] [Barrier: 12/12] [Health: 450/450] [Mana: 78/78] [Strength: 72] [Intelligence: 72] [Agility: 62] [Attack Power + 18] [Defense + 14] [In peak condition.]

His barrier had increased to 12. It was an increase of 2.

"The ratio is 1/10, isn't it? Good."

If health was one hundred thousand, the barrier would be ten thousand. As proficiency increased, the ratio would gradually rise, making it a highly valuable skill.

However, the value of the barrier was not simply in its total health.

Taesan confirmed this in his first battle. The barrier was depleted before his health. The two judgments were different.

So, there was something to gain.
The main skill that can only be obtained if you receive attacks without your health being reduced. It's a skill worth solving the contradiction for.

"I think this is really possible."

If I raise the barrier just a little more, it should be achievable without difficulty.

I thought it would only be possible after significantly lowering various potions, equipment, and skills, but it was a pleasant mistake.
