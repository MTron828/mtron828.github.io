Chapter 289

289. The 71st floor of the past. The physical body of the Giant King (4)

[The first thing I wanted to confirm was your strength.]

Oman sent a strange gaze towards Tai Shan.

[The other gods were talking loudly, and I wondered if you really had that much power. Even when you cleared your trial from the lower floors, you had incredible strength, but there were people like that from time to time.]

The strong ones from outside.

Those who had reached the strongest in their original world could descend to the 20th or 30th floor without any problems. The important thing was what came next.

The depths of the abyss. As the limits of what a mortal could reach approached, was the power you possessed now greater than the floor you were currently on?

[The reason I summoned you to the unused space was for this trial.]

“Have your doubts been cleared?”

[Yes, they have.]

Oman smiled wryly.

[Although I thought I could clear it, I didn't expect it to be this easy.]
Here is the translation of the text:

He muttered to himself. It seemed that even a transcendent being like him would be surprised by what the Mountain God had done, as if there was a hint of admiration in his voice.

[Your power is overwhelming, even considering the long history of the labyrinth. No one has ever been able to obtain such power, not even reaching the depths of the 60th floor.]

His arrogant eyes gleamed.

[Moreover, the type of power you possess is also unconventional. It's astonishing that a mortal like you would have such power, and I can understand why they're interested.]

Oman spoke in a soft tone.

[You're exceptional among the mortals I've seen.]

"Thank you for your words."

[Don't die. You can reach places that no one else can, so come down.]

Oman clapped his hands.

[Another reason I summoned you is to discuss the covenant of the Way, but wouldn't you refuse anyway?]

"Yes."

The Mountain God nodded slightly, as if he had expected it. Oman spoke indifferently.

[If you were just a beginner at the entrance of the labyrinth, I wouldn't know what to say. But now, you have no reason to accept a covenant. It would be harmful to both of us.]

The Mountain God gazed at Oman with a blank expression.
Here is the translation of the text:

He was explaining many things to him, including information that Tai Shan didn't know. He explained it all without hesitation.

It was a good thing for him, but since the gods had restrictions on information, he was a bit taken aback. Omi noticed Tai Shan's expression and said:

"You're now standing at the surface. It's meaningless to control information anymore."

Tai Shan asked curiously:

"What is the surface exactly?"

Omi had heard a rough story from Yu-ling and Ita-yeon, but he didn't know the exact details. It was just that it was extremely difficult and obscure. He only knew one thing.

Omi answered Tai Shan's question:

"The second reason we're stuck in this labyrinth."

"...Second..."

"There are also those who want to experience the adventure of heroes, warriors, and magicians and are stuck here. But do you think these many gods would abandon their world and take this labyrinth as their dwelling place because of one thing?"

"...".

"You'll know when you reach the surface. Let's leave it until then."

Omi smiled wryly.

"I'm glad."
Here is the translation of the text:

Oman waved his hand. His power was starting to attach to Taesan.

[You have obtained the ring of a successful examinee.] [You have obtained the title of "One who has proven oneself".] [Farewell. Let's see what's next.]

Oman waved his hand. As the distance increased, Taesan's physical body began to return to the labyrinth.

[Ah, and one final word.]

Oman's voice echoed.

[I've had my fill and have become close friends. So I've heard it from her. Soon, the guides who claim to be the wayfinders will come to you.]

With that voice, Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

The labyrinth he returned to was not the giant king's body, but the 63rd floor.

A staircase leading to the 64th floor was visible right in front of him.

Taesan sat down.

* * *

Initially, the fact that he had moved to the 71st floor was astonishing, but he still managed to resolve the problem without much trouble. He also received generous rewards, so it was actually a good thing.

Note: The story appears to be part of a fantasy novel or game, and the names "Oman", "Taesan", and "Giant King" are likely characters or locations within that story.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The Red Shoes of Magubaania] [Attack Power + 100] [Defense Power + 300] [Strength + 300] [Agility + 300] [Action Speed + 14%] [Movement Speed + 14%] [The red shoes that Magubaania, who had the name of a saint, was wearing when he met his death.]

It had high attack power and defense power, and stats as well. Although it didn't have any special effects, it was a great equipment nonetheless.

[A Dark Magic Tome] [Black Magic + 150] [Magic Power + 400] [Intelligence + 1000] [A magical tome that compresses darkness itself. The thick darkness is so intense that even a strong black magician might be corrupted.]

It was a black magic equipment, suitable for intermediate-level black magic.

[I used it.] [I obtained a brown staff made from the remnants of a meteorite.]

It was a magic staff, a reward. The Sage's eyes shone. If I do this, I might be able to obtain another intermediate-level magic.

"It's fine."

Overall, the equipment was not bad. The Sage checked the reward for clearing the trial this time.

[The Ring of the Successful] [Attack Power + 200] [The ring given by the gods to those who have successfully passed their trials. It grants corresponding effects to the target.]

"Oh, wow."
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san raised his eyebrows. Although the effect was quite simple, it was definitely the effect he had been hoping for. For him, the most important thing was not defense or stats, but rather attack power.

So, the title would have a similar effect. Tae-san confirmed it along with his expectations, and his prediction was accurate.

[Title: Proving One's Ability] [Vitality + 1000] [Mana + 300] [Magic + 70] [Attack Power + 100] [Proving One's Ability to the God of the Test].

Attack power was attached to magic. Although the numbers were relatively low, the title was not something that could be changed like equipment, but rather something that could be kept forever once obtained.

Tae-san was satisfied. His stats had finally surpassed all of them. If he continued like this, he might be able to surpass Ite-yun's stats around the 70th floor.

‘Then, now it's time to...’

It was time to check.

The biggest change he experienced while clearing the trial was the concept skill. He needed to understand its exact effects and limitations.

Oh-man said, "Soon, the ones who claim to be guides will come to me."

The remaining guides were only the top leaders.

It was time to fight against those who had reached the brink of destruction. Before that, he needed to understand and organize the maximum power he had obtained.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san walked around the 63rd floor. During the exploration, he moved to the 71st floor and found that the monsters were still there.

Although he couldn't obtain anything from the monsters in exchange for the rewards, it didn't matter since the experiment was the purpose. "Klik!"

A black crow discovered Tae-san and flew towards him. Tae-san focused his mind on the crow.

He poured his will into the crow and applied pressure. The crow, which was rushing towards him, trembled with its body.

"Kki! Kkiek!"

The crow, despite having the enemy right in front of it, was writhing in pain and didn't know what to do. At this moment, the crow's mind was in conflict between the emotions of wanting to kill Tae-san and wanting to submit to him.

"Kkieeek..."

Finally, the crow trembled and lowered its posture.

The monster, which was supposed to kill the adventurer, took a submissive stance.

Tae-san gazed at the crow for a moment before turning his attention to his hand's sword. He began to focus his will on the sword.

When his will enveloped the sword, the sword broke free from his hand and flew towards the crow.

"Puuk."

The crow's eyes widened and it let out a scream of pain. It thrashed its body in agony and rushed towards Tae-san.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Is this the limit?"

Taesan, who had subdued the crows that were swooping down, conducted a few more experiments. As a result, he was able to confirm his approximate abilities.

He projected his will onto the world. The meaning contained in his words was simple: he had become able to physically and spiritually affect the world through his will.

The monster on the 63rd floor submitted to Taesan's pressure alone. And Taesan's sword, which he controlled with his will alone, pierced the crow.

If pushed to the extreme, he could even sentence his target to death with his will, just like the gods.

But he didn't have the power of a mortal.

"However, the limit is clear."

The crows that had submitted to Taesan's control flew at him after being pierced by the sword. This meant that his emotions had reached a boiling point or he was in pain, causing his control to break.

His will also didn't have a very strong physical impact on reality. Even a skilled person could easily block it, just like Taesan's own ego, which was on the level of an arrow.

And there was a biggest problem besides.

(Note: I tried to keep the translation concise and accurate, but please let me know if you'd like me to make any adjustments.)
Here is the translation of the text:

Whenever I unleashed my will, my head would spin. It was as if I was forcing myself to handle a power that had not yet been granted. The sensation was like being overwhelmed by a force beyond my control.

Even the experienced Taesan found it hard to ignore. The pain was not just simple, but seemed to be a kind of constraint. Unless it was an unusual case like that of a cicada, I didn't think it was possible to handle it meaningfully in battle yet.

[Concept Skill: Willpower ???] [Proficiency: 62%] [My willpower is ??? strengthened. I can sense the will of all living things and coordinate my own will. I can project my will onto the world. I have obtained ???.]

Taesan gazed at the Concept Skill.

The thing I obtained was from the world of half-ran, the blacksmith, who had perished.

"Let's go back and visit after a long time."

Just then, I also obtained a material item. Taesan took a step forward.

* * *

Taesan returned to the 60th floor with a satisfied expression. After sacrificing another offering, I was able to obtain a mid-level magic.

[Mid-level Magic: Earthquake] [Proficiency: 1%] [Mana consumption: 500] [It causes the earth to collapse. However, its impact is still limited to a local area.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The skill that can crush the earth. It's hard to see its effect within the labyrinth. The floor of the labyrinth is a place where even seasoned adventurers can't find any cracks, unless they're extremely skilled.

However, it wasn't a big problem for Taesan, who often went out to the outside world. Taesan was satisfied with magic and went to find Hafren.

"Oh? It's been a while, hasn't it?"

Hafren was still there.

In the place where flames were crackling, Hafren was hammering away at a forge, refining something.

"What's going on this time?"

"I'm going to entrust this to you."

Taesan took out the materials.

[The remnants of the giant king's heart] [The remnants of the heart of someone who once rivalled the gods. It possesses enormous power on its own.] [The remnants of the giant king's blood] [The remnants of the blood of someone who once rivalled the gods. It possesses enormous power on its own.]

"...Oh?"

Hafren's eyes sparkled.

"No matter how I look at it, the materials you're bringing back aren't suitable for now. How did you get these?"

"Can they be made into equipment through the process of clearing trials?"

"That's enough. What do you want?"

"A combat equipment that can move according to my will."

"According to will? I can make it. But, I'm sorry to say, but you're not skilled enough to handle it right now."
Here is the translation of the text:

Hafran was puzzled.

"Only those who have seen the truth can influence things. Even if you have the support of equipment, it's hard for ordinary people to intervene."

Hafran extended his hand.

"I'm a blacksmith, so I'll make it for you if you want, but... I'd rather not. If you really want it, just hand over the materials."

Taesan did not hand over the materials with his hand, but instead focused his will.

"...what?"

Hafran's face stiffened.

The remains of blood and heart floated up into the air and landed on Hafran's hand.

"That power... is..."

"It's as expected."

Hafran's world was destroyed by the will of the world itself. There was no way Hafran couldn't notice it. Taesan was now moving things not with magic, but with his will alone.

"Your destroyed world. I'd like to go back there and take a look again."
