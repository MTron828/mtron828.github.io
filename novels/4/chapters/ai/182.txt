Chapter 183

183. The World of the Arrogant Giant (9)

The god of magic gazed out at the earth with a distant look. Taesan stood beside him and asked,

"Are you not going to return to the labyrinth?"

[I will return, but not just yet. It's been a long time since I've been to my hometown, and I want to enjoy it too.]

Jerbrand's eyes, gazing out at the scenery, were filled with longing.

[I've been unable to come for a long time due to those annoying demons. I was really frustrated, but thanks to you, I can return once again. I'll express my gratitude again. This is sincere.]

"Well, what about the demons?"

[Nothing's changed.]

Jerbrand shrugged his shoulders.

[Just because I've caused them some damage doesn't mean they'll receive any significant impact. If that were the case, we would have broken through the seal and destroyed the original body long ago. But... they won't be able to interfere with my world anymore.]

The sky, which had regained its blue hue, seemed very still.

However, Taesan was aware that an enormous, invisible seal was spreading in that place.
Here is the translation of the text:

[But I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon... it's impossible to hold onto you.]

Gervand shook his hand.

[Go and meet the giant king. After talking to him and receiving a reward, come back and then I'll send you back to the labyrinth.]

Tai Shan nodded and went to find the Giant King.

"I'm here."

The Giant King had been waiting for him on his throne.

"You look good."

"It's thanks to you."

The Giant King smiled slightly.

The constraint he felt towards him earlier had disappeared completely.

Just his existence was enough to subdue and dominate all humans with an immortal's aura.

"I don't need to express gratitude. Human. We could have won thanks to you."

For a thousand years, he had been secretly eyeing the world of giants before he ascended to the throne.

His gratitude towards him was hard to put into words even as a giant king.

"But the damage was not slight."

The Giant King laughed bitterly. Half of the giant army, which numbered in the hundreds, had died.
Here is the translation of the text:

"When we think about the fact that each of them was not just an ordinary giant, but the lord of each territory, it's clear that the damage was enormous.

"But we have won."

They eventually succeeded in defeating the monsters and chasing them away.

And the damage was much less than what the Giant King had expected.

He had expected that the monsters would spread everywhere, destroying numerous territories.

The death of the lords is sad, but it's their duty to sacrifice their lives to protect their people.

The names of the lords who died in this battle against the Giant King will be remembered for a long time and passed down from mouth to mouth among the giants.

"'This is all thanks to you. You have perfectly done your job. I must repay you for that.'"

The Giant King raised his hand.

The magic power gathered and a white stone was born at that place.

"Take it. It's our rune."

[You obtained the white rune.]

"What's this?"

Tae-san received the rune.

The white stone fragment was covered with intricate patterns.

"It's a material for magic. Using it in your equipment will be quite useful."

"Is this similar to anything else?"

Tae-san shook his necklace.
Here is the translation of the text:

[White Rune Necklace] [Defense + 15] [Magic + 8] [Intelligence + 25] [A necklace made from the highest-grade white rune. All top-ranked mages will covet it.]

It was the necklace he possessed.

This necklace was also written as "White Rune" just like the one given by the Giant King.

The Giant King's face contorted.

"Do not compare our things to those of humans, which are insignificant and trivial. It is incomparable, a perfect material. It's better to see it for yourself rather than describing it. Do you have equipment that can accommodate the rune?"

"There is one."

Tae-san took out a staff.

[Twisted Disaster Staff] [Magic + 40] [A staff that brings about the downfall of the world due to personal greed.] [Whenever you use magic with this staff, your magic increases by 1, but your attack power decreases by 1 and your health decreases by 10.]

It was a staff obtained after overcoming the trials of the mysterious and twisted curse of the Magpie.

Although it was a good staff, it had a massive penalty.

So, I decided to entrust it to the blacksmith, but I still kept it.

The Giant King's eyes lit up when he saw the staff.

"That's it. It belongs to the Immortal."

"Understood?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"I can feel the lingering power. It's like the equipment I used during my mortal days. I can sense the power emanating from it, and I'm a twisted existence, to say the least."

The Giant King laughed.

"Hand over the staff. Make it usable."

I'll fix it for you, so there's no reason to refuse.

Tae-san handed over the staff.

The staff began to glow with a faint light and entered the Giant King's hand.

"This rune."

Tae-san produced a white rune.

The Giant King grasped the white rune in one hand and the staff in the other, and began to chant.

Kaa-aa-ak!

Suddenly, a wave of rough power emanated from the staff.

It distorted the mind of the person in contact with it and pierced the body with a thick, dark aura.

The Giant King's eyes gleamed with a deep smile as he felt the power of the staff, which seemed to be struggling like a trapped beast.

"Hey, you."

Kwajik.

The power wave was crushed.

The rune was combined with the staff.

The ominous aura emanating from the staff disappeared, leaving only a faint sense of white power.

"Take it."

Tae-san handed over the staff with a smile, and the Giant King received it without hesitation.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The Purified Rod of Disaster] [Magic + 70] [A rod that brought about the destruction of the world with one's personal greed, purified by the magic of the giant.]

The eyes of the Great Mountain shone brightly.

The magic level rose to 30 or so.

Not only that, but the penalty of decreased vitality and attack power also disappeared.

"Are you satisfied?"

"This is sufficient."

The Great Mountain happily grasped the rod, but the Giant King seemed to be slightly dissatisfied, stroking his chin and asked.

"Is that a sword? You're not going to use the rod, are you?"

"That's right. So I'll go to the blacksmith and get it remade into a different form."

It doesn't matter if it's a weapon or armor.

The effect will be amplified in the process, but there will still be sufficient value.

The Giant King nodded after hearing the Great Mountain's words.

"I want to combine the equipment and rod. Let's do it this time."

"...Really?"

"Think about what you've done, and even if it's a master blacksmith, the magic of such an object will inevitably be amplified. It doesn't sit well with me."

There was no reason to refuse since he had agreed.

The Great Mountain thought for a moment before removing his mantle.

"Then, let's do it this way."
Here is the translation of the text:

[Robe of the Ancient King] [Defense + 40] [A legendary robe worn by a great king of a bygone era. The magical treatment to protect the king is now only a remnant.]

The Giant King touched the robe.

"This is a decent robe, I think. With this, I can minimize my losses."

He murmured something as he received the staff.

A white aura began to combine with the two equipment pieces.

Wooooo.

When the light dimmed, only one pure white robe remained.

"It's not bad. With your current strength, it's sufficient."

The Giant King threw the robe away.

[Robe imbued with the magic of the Ancient King] [Magic + 40] [Defense + 50] [A legendary robe worn by a great king of a bygone era. The magical treatment to protect the king has awakened with immense power.] [Attacking with the robe reduces damage taken by 20%.]

"I was able to awaken the power within. I don't know which one is better, but this one is the least detrimental."

"This is sufficient."

Forty points of magic were added, and defense also increased a bit. Moreover, the effect of reducing damage taken by a large percentage when blocking attacks with the robe was also added.
Here is the translation of the text:

As I had expected, I couldn't bring out my full potential, so I was satisfied with this much effect.

Moreover, since I had been using the equipment from the very beginning, I didn't need to carry a separate staff, which was the most satisfying part.

Gwisinwang, who was delighted with the reward, murmured to himself.

"That's fortunate. Are we leaving now?"

Taesan nodded his head.

His goal was to conquer the labyrinth.

"Come back whenever you want. I'll welcome you personally then."

"Alright."

Taesan turned his body and left.

As he was heading towards the god of magic, he found Umbrekh.

When Umbrekh saw Taesan, he changed color and approached him.

"Ah, human. Have you met our king?"

"Yes, I have."

"Then are we leaving now?"

"My destination is there, so I'll be going back."

"Is that so?"

Umbrekh smiled wryly.

"Magic... we've forgotten that."

Umbrekh was confused.

At that moment, his mind was filled with vast knowledge about magic.

When he heard the story about the power that he and his companions had possessed from the beginning but had never recognized, he couldn't help but be astonished.
Here is the translation of the text:

"But it's still our strength. And that's all thanks to you. Whenever you want, come find me. I'll be waiting for you."

"Alright."

Tae-san left Umbreka.

Umbreka waved goodbye with her hand.

"So I hope to achieve my goal. Human."

Tae-san, who had gone that way, arrived at the god of magic.

"Are you going to come back?"

"Yes."

The god of magic smiled wryly.

"You did very well, very well."

The power of magic flowed from his hand and settled on Tae-san.

"So this is a service. [Your magic proficiency has increased by 4%.] [You have learned the basic magic [Tracking].]"

"Thank you."

Tae-san thanked the unexpected reward with a smile.

The god of magic waved his hand.

"It's only fair to give a reward for a job well done. Good work. Let's meet again later."

The space swallowed Tae-san up.

When the scenery returned to its original state, Rilis was waiting for him.

"Did you come?"

She gazed at Tae-san and quietly let out a sigh.

"You've gotten stronger."

"Can you tell just by looking?"

"I don't know about other things, but in terms of magic, that's a mid-level magic, isn't it......"
Here is the translation of the text:

Her eyes fluttered wildly. The gaze that seemed to want to devour Taesan had Taesan backing away.

"I'm going, then."

"Yes, that would be good. It's hard to be self-disciplined."

Taesan left her and descended to the floor.

[38th Floor Quest Start.] [Defeat the 38th Floor Boss and pass through.] [Reward: Amulet of the Order] [Secret Reward: ???]

It was the 38th floor.

Finally, the 30th floor was in sight.

Before breaking through the floor, there was something that had to be done. Taesan opened the skill window.

[Magic] [Proficiency: 56%] [I can handle magic properly, controlling fire, ice, and wind. ]

The proficiency of magic, which had not risen much, was finally at 60% right in front of her.

It was all thanks to the help of the magic god.

Magic was a skill that brought about great changes, but it was difficult to raise its proficiency.

The moment it exceeded 60%, it was expected that some change would occur.

The proficiency of the concept skill also rose to 40% as it defeated the monster.

As a result, the content changed once again.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Concept Skill: ???grade] [Proficiency: 42%] [The power of intention is awakened. One can sense and harmonize with the intentions of all things, and adjust their own intentions accordingly. And they have obtained ???]

Note: The text seems to be describing a concept or skill related to intention, willpower, or spiritual growth. However, the exact meaning is unclear due to the unknown words and phrases represented by the question marks.
