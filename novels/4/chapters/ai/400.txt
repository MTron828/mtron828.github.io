Chapter 401

401. 81st Floor, Advanced Magic (1)

[Gang Joon-hyuk [Ellon] : You've changed a bit... your tone has changed too... did you give your sister an item or skill or something?] [Gang Tae-san [Ellon] : If I was going to give her something, I would have given it to you too. The reason she changed isn't because of me.]

Although Tae-san had delivered Maria's flower arrangement, it was a medium that played a role in reviving memories. The reason she changed was within herself.

[Gang Joon-hyuk [Ellon] : It's not bad that you're going down quickly... but I'm a bit worried. What if something big happens?]

Gang Joon-hyuk's words were filled with anxiety and concern.

[Gang Tae-san [Ellon] : There won't be a big problem. I'll take care of it, so don't worry too much.] [Gang Joon-hyuk [Ellon] : Okay. Thank you, hyung.]

Tae-san ended his conversation with Gang Joon-hyuk and started talking to Lee Tae-yeon again.

After a considerable amount of time had passed, she accepted his conversation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Ah, sorry. I was busy clearing the boss and didn't check in time.] [Gang Tae-san[Alone]: What floor are we on?] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: We're on the 55th floor now.]

What was the monster on the 55th floor? It was cleared too quickly, so I don't remember it well. Tae-san, who was trying to recall, remembered.

[Gang Tae-san[Alone]: I think it was a monster that interfered with our minds.] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Yeah, that's right. Since we cleared the Alone mode, our mental state is fine.]

Lee Tae-yeon had clearly cleared the labyrinth by exploiting its weaknesses and was mentally weak.

However, that was due to her own self-doubt and self-deprecation. Her mental strength itself was far superior to that of an average adventurer. It was impossible for her to allow a normal monster's mental interference.

[Gang Tae-san[Alone]: Aren't you going down too quickly?] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: It's okay. We already know all the floors, so the strategy itself is simple. The trials of the gods were a bit difficult, but... there were no problems.]

Lee Tae-yeon had put in her all to clear each floor. Her memories of each floor were also very clear.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If you have the experience and knowledge gained from clearing the deep floor, you'll definitely be able to descend to the deep floor without any problems.

But Taesan didn't think that Iteyon would rush like this. It wasn't good to clear the labyrinth quickly.

[Taesan [Alone]: Why are you going down so fast?] [Iteyon [Alone]: Because I can't leave you alone.]

Taesan was taken aback.

After a moment of silence, Taesan responded.

[Taesan [Alone]: I don't care.] [Iteyon [Alone]: I know. This is just self-satisfaction.]

Taesan chatted a bit more and then turned off the community.

The feeling was strange.

If someone was about to clear the labyrinth, he thought he would wait for a while, gather his strength, and then clear the labyrinth with everyone.

And he thought he would return to the earth alone and deal with the monsters.

Iteyon knew what Taesan was thinking.

So, he said he couldn't leave him alone.

He wasn't alone.

It was a very strange feeling, but it wasn't bad. Rather, it was good.

Taesan, who had calmed down, continued to check the rewards."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Title: Solo Unyielding Body] [A body that is not affected by anything, just a solo unyielding body.] [All physical status resistances are greatly increased.]

The mage changed the useless title for Taesan, making it useful. Now, for Taesan, things like poison or paralysis were like nothing.

[Special Passive Skill: Unwavering Mind] [Proficiency: 1%] [As long as your mind is not broken, your spirit and body will not yield. You can move your body, which has reached its limits, with your mental power.]

"Is it moving my body with my will?"

It didn't seem like it would be of great help to Taesan, but it wasn't bad either.

And there was a special activation skill.

[Special Activation Skill: Seal of Authority] [Mana consumption: 1] [Seal absolute authority. If you want, you can also seal your presence.]

The skill was quite unique, as it was directly created and handed over by the mage. Taesan tried activating the skill.

[You have activated the Seal of Authority.] [Oh?]

The ghost made a sound.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan became immortal. The authority and presence that flowed from his very being were not something that could be easily hidden.

But when he activated the Authority Seal, everything disappeared perfectly.

Taesan now looked like a completely ordinary adventurer, without anything special about him.

[Is this okay?]

Taesan summoned Minerva to confirm. Minerva appeared with a delighted face.

"Master! You've finally achieved immortality! You should have called me sooner! I have a lot of questions too……."

Minerva stopped talking. She was taken aback by Taesan, who didn't seem to have any presence at all.

"What? You've definitely achieved it, right?"

"Even the Spirit King, with whom I have a direct contract, can't sense it."

Taesan released the Authority Seal. His presence spread out again, and Minerva was amazed.

"A seal of immortality? Is that a skill too?"

"I got it from the wizard who created the labyrinth. It's fine."

He could now control his presence at will. He didn't know what kind of situation would arise in the future, but it seemed like it would be useful.

"The labyrinth... if the being who created this place can do that, then it's no wonder. It's amazing."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Minerva, as if she was amazed, looked around the labyrinth and opened her mouth.

"Anyway, congratulations, Master. You've surpassed mortality. It's a feat that's almost unheard of in the universe."

Her words were not empty flattery. Even in the labyrinth, where the strongest from each world gathered, adventurers who had surpassed mortality were rare. Achieving immortality was a rare occurrence, even on a universal scale.

However, Minerva spoke with an ambiguous expression.

"I'm proud, but... I'm not sure how much help I'll be to you from now on."

The current Taesan was an immortal. As the wizard had said, the labyrinth would change to match his level from now on. Minerva was certainly strong, but she clearly fell short of immortality.

"You have your own things to do."

Taesan didn't need to worry, as the spirits that moved on their own were extremely useful, even outside of battle.

After chatting with Minerva about this and that, Taesan began to check on the rest.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Ring of Collapse] [A ring that compresses the power of collapse and brings it to life. Any ordinary being that touches it will have their entire body collapse.] [A ring that calls forth endless collapse.] [Attack power +500] [A ring that has the power to destroy surrounding objects just by existing. If the user's strength and power are insufficient, it will collapse the user's body.]

It was a single material item, and a decent ring with good performance. When I looked at the ring, I remembered the twin rings that had grown to the next level after I became immortal.

The white and black rings.

Now that I had become immortal, the power of this ring was extremely stable.

The attack power of the black ring had increased to 1,500 to 2,000. It was much higher than any weapon. The white ring had an additional description that it could use its own will to borrow divine power and support the user.

But it was still lacking.

Taesan touched the pair of rings.

A skill that combines two equal things into one.

I could use it now. If I combined the white and black rings, their power would surely increase greatly.

But not yet. I would go to Half-ran, confirm it, and test it out.

After finishing his preparations, Taesan headed to the 81st floor.

Leaving the quietly smiling shop owner behind, he stepped onto the 81st floor, where he saw a familiar altar."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**[81st Floor Quest Start.] [Pass through Zelvand's Trial.] [Reward: Staff of Wavering Sound.] [Secret Reward: ???]**

* * *

The God of Magic, Zelvand's altar appeared. As I approached the altar and raised my hand, the altar's energy enveloped me.

Taesan nodded his head.

Power expanded, and the world changed.

A black space filled with starlight, like the galaxy.

This was the realm of the God of Magic.

**[I've arrived.]**

"Greetings."

Zelvand stood alone in the galaxy, waiting for Taesan. Taesan bowed his head in respect. Zelvand waved his hand.

**[It's okay. You're now an immortal. You may not have your own realm, but you've surpassed mortality. There's no need to be so formal.]**

"As you say."

Zelvand was far stronger than Taesan.

Zelvand knew that and smiled wryly.

**[It's a meaningless phrase. Do as you please.]**

Zelvand created a chair and sat down.

**[Do you know what you'll gain this time?]**

"Will it be advanced magic?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This is the answer. High-level magic is a power that even those who have dedicated their entire lives to magic and possess exceptional talent cannot easily obtain. So, I'll give you a trial related to it. Will you accept it?"

Zelvand opened his mouth.

"Yes."

Finally, it was high-level magic. The gap between elementary magic and intermediate magic was like the difference between heaven and earth. After obtaining intermediate magic, he almost never used the elementary magic he had been using until then, which showed how big the difference was.

Then, what level would high-level magic be?

He was extremely excited.

Zelvand smiled faintly.

"Good. I'll take you to the trial place. Check the details yourself when you get there."

The God of Magic snapped his fingers. The space accelerated, centered around Taesan.

Countless galaxies flashed by, and Taesan arrived at one place.

It was a tower.

In a vast, white, empty space, a single tower stood, its top invisible.

"Is this the trial place?"

"Probably."

Taesan headed towards the magic tower. As he opened a small door and entered, eight people were waiting for him inside.

"Ah, you're here!"

"……Hmph. Not impressive."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I don't feel anything. Did Lord Zelvand really grant us permission to use high-level magic?"

A voice mixed with curiosity, annoyance, and distrust overlapped.

A deep and profound wave of mana was emanating from them, but each of their waves was unique and lacked unity, as if each person was using their own individual magic.

Among them, one person stood out with an especially strong presence.

An old man wearing a gray robe, a pointed hat, and a long white beard, embodying the most stereotypical image of a wizard, stood at the center of the group of wizards.

"……."

The old man was silently gazing at Taesan, and a hint of excitement was visible in his eyes.

Taesan was also slightly surprised to see the old man.

"The Immortal."

"Hello! Nice to meet you!"

The woman who had shown curiosity towards Taesan smiled brightly and waved her hand as she approached him.

"We've already met Lord Zelvand beforehand, but you're new, so you must be full of questions. Go ahead and ask! Is there anything you're curious about?"

"What kind of place is this?"

"It's simple," the woman said with a proud expression, placing her hand on her chest.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We are the wizards chosen by Lord Zelvand!"

"Chosen?"

"A madman obsessed with magic. Only a select few among those who dedicate their lives to magic are chosen by Lord Zelvand. Those chosen ones gather to research and train in magic forever at a place. That place is right here, the Tower of Eternity!"

A gathering place for wizards. The Tower of Eternity.

The woman raised her finger.

"And we are the wizards who have settled in this place! You can think of us as examiners who test whether you have the qualifications to obtain advanced magic! Please take good care of yourself for now!"

[Sub-quest starts.] [The God of Magic, Zelvand, wants to verify whether you have the qualifications to obtain advanced magic. To do so, you must visit the Tower of Eternity, a place where wizards recognized by Zelvand gather. Get recognized by the seven wizards settled in the tower and pass the tower master's test.] [Conditions: Recognition from the seven schools and the tower master.] [Reward: Advanced magic. Great destruction.]
