**Chapter 320**

320. 70th Floor, the King of the Flame Spirit. Vishnu (3)

[Kikikikiki!]

The light resonates. The crazy spirit that was attached to Taesan's sword appears.

[Ah! You've come! I've met my king!]

The crazy spirit shouts along with the light. Vishnu's face distorts.

"......That thing."

Vishnu also didn't forget. The spirit that she had created to protect the spirits' selves when she brought them to the labyrinth, a mere tool.

"Did that one also make a contract with the labyrinth's magician?"

[Ah! Your Majesty!]

The spirit shouts. The emotional voice echoes through the floor.

Taesan opens his mouth.

"Go and fulfill your wish."

[Kachak! Thank you! Thank you!]

The crazy spirit flies away.

[Ah! Great King! I respect and love you, the king I've been searching for! I've come to meet you!]

"Get lost."

To the shouting crazy spirit, Vishnu says coldly. Flames erupt and engulf the crazy spirit.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The crazy spirit, which couldn't even become a low-ranking spirit, was extremely weak. It was impossible for it to withstand Vishnu's power. Vishnu sneered at it.

"Is this what you call a trump card?"

"Yes."

Taesan nodded his head.

The crazy spirit, which had pierced through the flames, revealed its appearance. It didn't seem to have suffered any damage.

"What!"

[You're looking down on me! I understand!]

The crazy spirit shouted with a distorted face.

[Same here!]

The spirit attached itself to Vishnu's body, spreading all over and starting to oppress him.

"Ugh!"

Vishnu let out a groan. The emotions and madness that the crazy spirit had harbored began to fluctuate wildly.

The crazy spirit itself began to mix with her.

Taesan drew his sword towards the suffering Vishnu.

[You've activated acceleration.]

His body accelerated more than twice its normal speed in an instant, quickly closing in on the suffering Vishnu. Vishnu let out a shriek and unleashed a blast of flames.

The wave of flames rushed towards Taesan like a wild beast. Taesan summoned his magic.

[You've activated Marbas's Dark Wave.]

A dark wave erupted forth.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When I used Vishnu against the dark wave previously, it couldn't do anything and disappeared.

But it's not the case now.

The awakened black wave started to clash with the flames and devour them greedily.

"Ah!"

Vishnu gritted his teeth and pulled the flames even harder. He was finally able to push back the dark wave, but by then, Taesan had already closed in.

Vishnu was about to escape using the flames.

[Kikikik!]

The deranged spirit burst into laughter. The impure emotions suppressed the flames and blocked her movement. In the end, Vishnu allowed Taesan to land a hit.

"Ugh!"

[Vishnu activated his spatial teleportation shoes.]

Vishnu's body moved through space.

Taesan immediately detected his location and chased after him.

Gritting his teeth, Vishnu suppressed his disoriented mind.

The flames flickered. Vishnu once again unfolded the king's world.

It was literally a power that could change the laws of the world. Here, Vishnu was almost invincible. Taesan and the like would naturally be devoured and fall in an instant.

Kuuuuung!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, Taesan had blocked her way in the realm she had unfolded. She couldn't swallow one side and was stuck in a stalemate.

"How is this possible?!"

Vishnu couldn't accept it.

The power to change the world was not something that mortals were allowed to have.

It was something that only she, the Queen of the Spirits, who had lived longer than any other spirit and had an extremely high level of control over nature, could do.

She was the only one who could reach the end of the mortal realm, having stepped on the deepest part of it.

But Taesan had now made the world her own realm.

The world she had created was colliding with the Queen of the Spirits' realm, and they were in a fierce standoff.

Vishnu couldn't understand. Her absolute strength had disappeared.

And that wasn't the end of it.

Vishnu unleashed a fierce flame. It was a power that could burn everything it touched and turn it to ashes, but the crazy spirit that had attached itself to her was unscathed.

Whoosh.

The flames had attached themselves to her body. Fire was a familiar power to Vishnu, the Queen of Fire, but not now. The flames were trying to harm her.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Vishnu fiercely waved his arm and unleashed a flame.

The spirit that had gone mad and was attached to her was slowly damaging her own strength and power.

The reason he couldn't avoid Taesan's attack, even in his own domain, was because of that.

"How can I be bound by a lowly spirit like this?"

No matter how much the mad spirit tried to take revenge on Vishnu, the difference in strength and power was clear. It couldn't affect her that much.

Vishnu read the power contained within the mad spirit that bound him.

Her eyes trembled.

Inside, there was the energy of the Spirit God.

The Spirit God had given the mad spirit the power to kill her.

"Is that the Spirit God?"

The Spirit God had done it as a reward for Taesan saving Arulia, but Vishnu, who didn't know that, was shocked.

Meanwhile, Taesan arrived right in front of her. He hastily responded to the swinging sword.

She moved her hand erratically. The flame began to take shape.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Burn. The bird of flames."

[Vishnu activated the flame servant.] [Kkiruk!]

The phoenix charges at Taesan. Taesan doesn't dodge.

[You've ignited the spark of calamity.]

A flame that burns the entire world erupts and collides with the phoenix.

[Kkiruk!]

The phoenix suppresses the flames. The spark of calamity, crushed by the powerful force, slowly begins to lose its power.

Taesan gathers his strength and adds fuel to the flames.

[Kkiiik!]

The spark of calamity, amplified by Taesan's strength, grows in size and engulfs the phoenix.

Taesan, having defeated the phoenix, stabs his sword into Vishnu.

"Kkkk!"

The flames explode.

Taesan uses magic to pierce through the flames and creates a path. Vishnu is slowly being pushed back.

Pit.

A red line is etched onto her body, and red blood flows out.

"The blood of the Spirit King is the same color, huh."

Taesan mutters to himself as he charges forward.

Vishnu's eyes widen in surprise.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I didn't want to admit it, but the situation was not good. The territory was divided, and she couldn't control it as she wanted, and the interference from the deranged spirit hindered her movements.

She had to make a decision. Her eyes sank.

She took a step forward. Flames erupted. The wave of flames that filled the space was so intense that even Taesan had to choose to dodge rather than charge forward.

And so, Vishnu, who had bought time, gathered the power within himself.

[Ahahahah!]

The deranged spirit, who was subjected to the intense power directed at himself, let out a loud laugh.

[You want to kill me, Your Majesty! You want to erase me, who was abandoned by you! I understand!]

The deranged spirit didn't back down either. Instead, he fiercely poured his emotions into Vishnu.

[Then you should accept everything about me!]

The deranged spirit shouted fiercely.

[Human!]

Taesan immediately activated his skill.

[You've activated the abandoned sword.]

The deranged spirit, who had taken residence in his sword, activated the remaining one of the two skills he had obtained.

The emotions that had been bottled up inside the deranged spirit surged violently. It began to swirl inside Vishnu."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Vishnu gritted his teeth and gathered his strength. Amidst the clashing forces that seemed about to burst, Taesan drew his sword.

[You activated Nabellius' Golden Sword.] [You activated Plus.] [You activated the Soul Edge.] [You activated Absolute Judgment.]

Tat.

Taesan charged forward. As the power condensed within Vishnu exploded, Taesan's sword pierced through Vishnu.

[Vishnu activated the Distorted Recovery Seal.] [Vishnu took 71,040 damage.] [Vishnu recovered 35,520 health.] [Your third attack's Absolute Nullification was activated.]

Kukukukuku...

Even though the attack was nullified, Taesan's body was blown back by the consecutive explosions.

The Spirit King's domain began to shake violently. The explosion subsided, and Vishnu appeared.

Her upper body was in tatters.

A ring on Vishnu's finger broke off and fell.

"As expected, the equipment from the depths is troublesome."

With 70,000 damage, it would have been enough to take down Vishnu, but it seemed she had used the equipment from the depths to survive. Taesan sneered.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You killed the spirit that was calling out to you? That's too much."

"......You."

Vishnu's angry gaze turned towards Taesan.

Kaang!

The space cracked.

The king's world that Vishnu had unfolded couldn't withstand the consumption of power and was destroyed.

Taesan's partial world transformation, which was triggered simultaneously, also came to an end. Since it was a method that consumed catalysts to activate, there was a limit to its duration.

"My mana is also depleted."

Mana was at rock bottom. Vishnu didn't give him a chance to use a potion.

Kiiing.

Taesan unfolded his divinity. A golden light spread out, almost perfectly recovering Taesan's mana and magic.

Vishnu laughed mockingly at the sight.

"I was mistaken."

She thought that Taesan was strong, but still just a mortal bound by the system of the labyrinth.

But that wasn't the case. Taesan wasn't bound by the system. Instead, he was using it to transcend his limits.

Taesan was a monster.

Vishnu's energy grew even stronger. Taesan's eyes sank.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With the partial world change, her advantage was erased. She inflicted great damage using the crazed spirit.

The necklace of ugliness at the bottom of the fallen god's quest had reduced her stats.

However, the spirit king still hadn't lost her power.

That was the true power of one who had stepped into the depths.

Vishnu gathered the flames. The momentum of the flames that appeared was clearly dead.

Vishnu wore a faint smile.

How many enemies had been pushed back until now? It was a rare occurrence even when conquering the labyrinth. The queen, who possessed the world, had always been one step away from death.

"It's been a while."

Vishnu spread her arms. All the flames began to gather in her hands.

[Vishnu activated Agni's flame sword.]

A long flame sword was held in her hand.

The flames contained within were, literally, all her remaining strength. The heat dried her lips and burned the air.

"I acknowledge it. You are stronger than me."

The arrogant and great spirit king opened her mouth.

"I will face you as a challenger."

"As you wish."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan swings his foot. Vishnu also responds. The flames' sword and Taesan's sword collide.

* * *

The flames' sword explodes. It tries to burn and melt everything it touches.

Taesan steps forward, twists his waist, and swings his sword.

Ka-ga-gak!

The swords collide. Taesan activates his "Flowing Water" technique. Vishnu's sword trajectory becomes distorted, revealing her opening.

Just as Taesan is about to strike, Vishnu's body moves.

[Vishnu has activated her "Space Teleportation Shoes".]

"Seriously annoying."

Taesan immediately charges at Vishnu, putting pressure on her. Their swords clash, and Vishnu is pushed back.

"Kkkk!"

Vishnu is the Spirit King. She's not used to wielding a sword or moving her body. She can't help but be pushed back by Taesan.

However, Vishnu is somehow managing to hold on.

It's all thanks to her high-level equipment. The most annoying one is the "Space Teleportation Shoes".

There's no activation delay, and the cooldown is extremely short. It allows her to teleport anywhere freely, making it easy for her to escape from pressure.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Vishnu's eyes didn't lose their light. While withstanding Taesan's attack, he seemed to be looking for an opportunity.

But Taesan was the same.

Ka-ga-gak!

You can't read his will. If it's an opponent at Vishnu's level, they can perfectly conceal their intentions.

So, Vishnu analyzes Taesan's behavior patterns, the timing of her spatial leaps, and her position relative to Taesan, one by one.

Ka-ang!

Taesan wildly swings her sword. Vishnu is pushed back. As the sword that aims to pierce his chest approaches, Vishnu activates his spatial leap.

[Vishnu activated his spatial transition shoes.]

And Taesan was also waiting for that timing.

[You activated forced descent.]

"Uh."

All of Vishnu's stats drop. Due to the sudden change in sensation, Vishnu is taken aback, and his reaction is slightly slower than before.

[You activated the perfect fairy's wings.] [You activated acceleration.] [You activated skill acceleration.]

And Taesan's body leaves an afterimage. Just as Vishnu, who had landed far away, tries to turn his gaze, Taesan is already right in front of Vishnu's nose."
