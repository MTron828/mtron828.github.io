**Episode 551**

**551. The Treasure Box of the Usurper (9)**

The universe's concept scattered all over the treasure box.

They were the powers that the usurper had plundered from the Transcenders during the past war.

Now, those powers have escaped from the usurper and are under the control of Taesan. The distorted form of the usurper has changed, as if his face had hardened.

[You.]

The usurper quickly raises his hand. The power of corruption is activated, and dust covers Taesan.

Taesan counterattacks with his hand.

What emerged from there was not a boundary or physical strength.

It was a brilliant white light that shone more radiantly than anything else.

Kiiiiing!

The light and the dust of corruption collide. Equal powers cancel each other out and shatter.

[…You.]

The usurper had defeated many Transcenders in the past war and plundered their powers.

Among them was a god who shone brightly, purifying the world.

It was the God of Light.

Now, Taesan has wielded that very power of light. He intervened in the concept that the usurper had plundered, using it as if it were his own power.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Don't laugh.]

A voice without a smile, stiff and rigid, resounds. Numerous powers are unleashed towards the Taesan.

Taesan didn't move. He just focused his mind on the power that had come into contact with him.

[You have activated the Domain Inheritance.]

The light returns to Taesan's domain. The brilliant, pure concept of light envelops the area.

Ka-a-a-ang!

Concepts collide and shatter. Fragments scatter in all directions.

Taesan laughed.

"Look at this."

He clenched his fist, his anger rising against the Inheritor's energy.

[This is mine!]

The domain trembles in response to his emotions. The scattered powers begin to quiver.

[This is something that only I, the complete and perfect one, can have! You can't intervene!]

"That's what you think."

Taesan replied calmly. The Inheritor's face contorted in anger, stomping their foot.

Zzzt-zzzt-zzzt!

A massive, coercive power of expulsion charges towards Taesan.

This power seeks to exclude, deny, and expel the very existence of Taesan.

Taesan quickly dodged. He reached out to one of the scattered powers.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the Domain Plunder.]

Thud.

The authority that was scattered throughout the domain, which belonged to the plunderer, resonates with Taesan.

He forcibly seizes the ownership and control rights. Part of the authority begins to transform into Taesan's possession.

And Taesan wielded the plundered authority.

The space is filled with a shockwave. The space itself transforms into a liquid, striking the void.

Whoa!

The liquid-transformed space collides with the authority of expulsion.

And it is neutralized.

"What kind of authority is this?"

It was an authority he had never seen before. He couldn't grasp its exact effects.

But one thing was certain: it was useful.

Taesan took another step forward.

Rumble!

Part of the domain transforms into a liquid. It really becomes a wave, charging towards the plunderer.

The plunderer's energy becomes even more rigid, unable to withstand it.

Kkkkkk!

A white wave covers the world, colliding with the wave. The authorities cancel each other out, shattering each other.

And the plunderer becomes enraged, unable to bear the fact.

[That's mine.]

All the authorities that Taesan is handling now were originally his possessions.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Although it was only a part, the Usurper clearly remembered.

What kind of fight they had to take the power, what god they had to defeat, and how they had usurped the power.

This treasure box was everything that the Usurper had built up.

But now, it was being taken away from them by Taesan.

[How dare you! How dare you! How dare you!]

The Usurper's body trembled with rage. Their domain resonated with it. Countless powers went wild and out of control.

[That's mine! You're stealing it from me!]

"Ha! Ha! Ha!"

Taesan responded to the Usurper's anger with a sneer.

"What are you saying? You're just a Usurper."

No matter how hard the Usurper fought to take the power, in the end, it was still theft. They had stolen someone else's essence and made it their own.

And yet, they were claiming it as their own and directing their anger at Taesan.

"You usurped the concept of the universe after a fierce battle. I did the same. Do you have a reason to be angry?"

[……!]

The Usurper silently seethed with rage.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

All the scattered powers began to stir.

It was not just one.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Many absolute powers are trying to trample the Taesan.

Taesan took a step back with a serious face.

* * *

Kuuuuuuuuung!

Many powers are covering Taesan.

Each one is an absolute power that can influence the universe itself and shake the world. It's a concept that can overturn the world.

But Taesan doesn't back down.

He quickly moves his body and comes into contact with the scattered powers.

[You have activated the concept of usurpation.]

And he usurps that power.

He seizes its ownership and makes it his own, wielding it. The powers collide.

[…….]

The usurper is enraged.

But the emotions in his anger are restrained.

He is a noble.

One who has defeated many transcenders and usurped their concepts.

He wasn't foolish enough to continue denying what was happening right before his eyes.

"I am usurping the concept of the universe that I have usurped."

It was as if he was the usurper.

But there was an important difference.

The usurper could only usurp when he had won against his opponent.

When he had crushed his opponent's spirit and body, he could usurp their concept.

Note: The translation tries to maintain the original tone and style of the text, but some nuances may be lost in translation.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

In a situation where the opponent existed alone, it was impossible to intervene in their concept.

But Taesan was different.

The treasure chest contained a concept stolen by a thief. It was entirely his possession.

However, someone was forcibly intervening in that possession and stealing it.

'...Is this a superior concept?'

He didn't want to acknowledge it. He didn't want to accept it. But no matter how he looked at it, Taesan's stolen power was above the thief's authority.

That fact was extremely humiliating to the thief.

He was only a part of the thief.

He didn't have true power and didn't even know the true foundation of the thief.

But still, he was a thief.

He was the only noble being who could steal the universe's concept and wield it. The thief's part took pride in that fact.

But Taesan shattered that pride.

Crunch.

The sound of it being crushed echoed. The thief couldn't hide his anger.

But he restrained himself.

He calmly assessed the situation.

'...Stealing is possible, but ultimately, there is a limit.'

Taesan was simply pulling out the stolen power and handling it.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was a temporary usurpation above all. It was impossible to take power by force and make it one's own permanently.

Then, if you aim for that gap, you can succeed.

The usurper judged so and took immediate action.

Ku-u-u-u-ung!

The usurper raises their authority to the highest level, stronger than anything else, with all their might.

The words were at a level where Taesan couldn't respond properly.

[Pierce through.]

With a short phrase, the usurper's authority heads towards Taesan.

There's no escaping, no denying. It's a universal concept that can only be blocked head-on.

That was the usurper's full power.

The usurper believed without a doubt that Taesan couldn't block this one attack.

However, Taesan's response was greatly different.

He reached out and took control of the authority in front of him.

[You have activated the Spirit Usurpation.]

And he made that authority his own.

He stole it from the usurper's control and made it his own, even if only temporarily. That authority became Taesan's genuine property.

And so, he wielded the dominated authority.

The Expulsion authority was activated in Taesan's hand.

Zzeea-ea-ea-eong!

The Expulsion and the usurper's authority clashed with each other.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Mutually contradictory concepts try to negate and push each other away.

The usurper was certain of his victory. As the opposing concept was originally his, it was natural that he could bring out a deeper level of power.

Ridiculous.

But the result was completely different from the usurper's confidence.

The two powers clashed and cancelled each other out.

And neutralized each other.

A strong shockwave swept through the realm. The usurper's body trembled violently.

[How is this possible!]

"You can't even handle it properly, can you? Then it's the same."

Taesan charged forward. The usurper quickly regained his composure and wielded his power again, but the result was the same. His power was neutralized by Taesan.

[I am the usurper!]

"So what's the point?"

Taesan replied calmly.

Taesan also understood the usurper's thoughts. Clearly, his concept usurpation was not perfect. He couldn't fully grasp the concept, and it was only a temporary seizure of power. It was an unstable and distorted power.

But the usurper was the same.

He couldn't properly handle the scattered concepts in the treasure box.

"It's not like it's just that level..."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Of course, it's powerful enough. With numerous abilities at its disposal, it could probably take down any ordinary god.

But as for Lakiratas, it didn't seem like it could reach the gods.

The Concept Thief can only mimic the world's concepts, but it didn't seem like it would stop at just that.

'Is that because it's just a part?'

The Concept Thief in front of me is only a part of the Concept Thief.

It's a small existence that has only been granted a small portion of power, but as a Concept Thief, it can wield the concept of a treasure box. However, its limitations were clear.

'Then.'

It was a good thing for Taesan. The possibility of defeating it had increased.

Kukukuku!

The battle continues.

The Concept Thief wielded concepts to try and take down Taesan, but Taesan countered by stealing concepts and blocking it.

His ash-colored energy was almost depleted, and his multiplication ability was also exhausted.

But it didn't matter.

The concepts existing in the treasure box were soon to be his own. He would steal and steal, making them his own."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$The thief was going mad. One by one, the things he had eternally stolen, believing no one could intervene, were slipping into Tian's possession. It was as if his very existence was being denied.

And most of all, Tian was growing accustomed to utilizing the concept of theft.

The thief was starting to lose ground.

Kugu-gugu-gu-ong!

Finally, the concept Tian had stolen collided with the thief's defenses, breaking through.

[Oo, oooooh!]

The thief's emotions surfaced. He could no longer hold on and unleashed everything.

And a power was revealed to the world.

It was a flower.

Numerous flowers began to bloom, covering the area.

'What is this?'

Tian instinctively retreated.

This was dangerous.

It was higher than any power the thief had ever wielded.

[……Ah.]

And when the flowers began to bloom, Akasha reacted.

Akasha trembled. Her emotion began to affect the area.

The feeling from Akasha grew stronger.

Tian instinctively sensed it.

"Is that...?"

[……Yes.]

Akasha responded in a trembling voice.

[That is... the power of... Ari-el-sama.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I don't know what kind of power it is, but it's a form that manifests as a flower. It's different from what I expected."

Taesan raised the corner of his mouth.

"Revealing it at this timing means it's an extremely powerful power, doesn't it?"

Then, it would be a matter of taking it for himself.

Note: "찬탈" is a bit tricky to translate, but in this context, it seems to mean "taking it for oneself" or "usurping it".
