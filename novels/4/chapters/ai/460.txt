Chapter 461

461. The Seventh Return, Earth (13)

Amelia accepted readily.

Taesan immediately began the contract with the gods.

[You proposed a contract with the gods to Amelia.]

"I'll accept it."

Amelia nodded her head. As soon as the contract was executed, the two of them began to connect with each other.

"Hmm."

"What?"

A voice echoed. Taesan let out a sigh, and Amelia was taken aback.

It was a strange, unfamiliar sensation.

They were connected. Taesan's power and aura enveloped Amelia.

"Uh."

Amelia let out a sigh. A thick, strong, and unfamiliar power took root in her spirit and body.

"......Is this the feeling?"

Taesan clenched and unclenched his fists repeatedly. He was also feeling the same unfamiliar sensation as Amelia.

Amelia was inside him.

With the will of all things, he could understand her thoughts and emotions, but now he could even grasp the things that were deeper within her.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have obtained the servant [Amelia Airin].] [She has sworn eternal loyalty to you.] [You have created the first servant. She will protect you and act on your behalf, capable of doing many things.] [You can give orders to your servant. If you truly desire it, the servant cannot refuse.]

.

.

.

There were countless system windows that couldn't be checked with one glance.

Amelia was also searching through the air at an incredible speed.

Amelia had become the servant of Taesan.

When the confirmation was finished, Amelia looked at Taesan with an ambiguous expression.

"Uh, um, Taesan... sir?"

"Why are you suddenly using honorifics?"

"It's not that. Since I've become a servant, I thought I should use honorifics."

"No need. Just treat me like you normally do."

"......Alright."

Amelia had a dissatisfied expression, but she spoke normally.

"It feels strange to use informal language. Isn't this blasphemy?"

"What's with that kind of thinking?"

What was important wasn't the attitude. It was what she had obtained and what she could do.

"So, how does it feel to have become a servant?"

"It's strange. It feels like a part of you has taken root inside me."

"Then let's test it out once."

Taesan drew his sword. Amelia smiled brightly and faced him with her weapon.

Kuuuung!

The two engaged in a duel.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan slightly held back his power and checked her movements. As a result, he realized.

"There's no change as big as I thought."

Amelia had become faster and more precise. Just this alone made it impossible for the Amelia before becoming a Saint to beat the current Amelia.

However, considering she had become a Saint, the change wasn't that remarkable. Amelia opened her mouth.

"You still lack the qualifications to wield the true power of a Saint. Instead, you've acquired the skill of Saintification."

"Let's try using it once."

Taesan also had this skill. Taesan made her activate Saintification.

[Amelia activated Saintification.]

"Whoa."

Amelia let out a small gasp.

The power and strength that Taesan had instilled in her suddenly amplified and enveloped her entire body.

In an instant, she reached a high level she had never achieved before. Taesan gestured to her, who was staring blankly at her sword.

"Try again."

"Ah, okay."

Amelia took a step forward.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

She had become fast and strong. At this level, she had a good chance of winning against an S-grade monster.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The duration was the same as Taesan's, one hour. And it had a daily cooldown. Considering that Taesan was able to defeat his enemies thanks to his divine transformation, it was a huge change.

"What is this?"

Amelia couldn't help but be amazed.

She had surpassed the limits she had never reached before, and had become able to wield divine power.

Compared to Taesan, it was like a firefly in front of the sun, but it was still quite useful since she could recover on her own during battle.

However, she didn't gain any more power than that. Other apostles were able to wield some of God's power, but Amelia didn't gain anything.

"There's no power like that. What I gained was just divine transformation and divine power."

Taesan tried to give her his own power, but Amelia couldn't accept it. She was in agony, feeling overwhelmed by the power she couldn't handle. In the end, Taesan gave up on giving her the power.

"It's a restriction."

[You have not yet fully mastered your power as a god, and there are restrictions on your various divine powers.]

He had become the god of the earth.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, it was an imperfect position that was still influenced by people's faith.

As time passed, people's faith would stabilize, and he himself would reach a higher level, but for now, he couldn't fully wield his divine power as a god. It seemed that Amelia, who had become a saint, had also acquired a limited saintification skill due to this reason.

When he gained true qualifications, Amelia would also be able to fully wield her power as a saint.

But Amelia had a satisfied expression.

"I'm good with this, aren't I? Honestly, it's the best skill I've gotten so far. But I don't think I can give away power at this level without any cost. Did you have some kind of power consumption or something?"

"There is, but it's negligible."

It was an extremely small, almost imperceptible consumption. Considering the gap between Amelia and Taesan, it was practically nonexistent.

"The Saint's Contract."

For now, there were various restrictions, but as they grew further, they would disappear.

Then, it wouldn't just be Amelia, but other Alone Mode players would also be able to make a Saint's Contract.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Around the time Taesan finished confirming the new powers he had acquired, Amelia, who was checking the system window, tilted her head in puzzlement.

"What's going on? Why is it empty?"

"What's empty?"

"Should I say it's your divine name? That part is blank, right?"

"......Explain it in detail."

Taesan asked with a serious face.

Amelia's explanation was simple.

She had obtained a system window that showed who she had contracted with.

However, the part before Taesan's name was empty.

"[Gang Taesan]"

"It's like this."

Taesan stroked his chin.

Begosetta's god, Harmon, was a god of light born from the earth.

Levinevnof was a loving goddess.

A divine name represented the essence of a god.

Currently, he was a god of the earth.

But that was a level reached through the faith of all people. It couldn't be said to be his true essence.

The fact that it was empty meant one of two things.

Either he hadn't obtained his true essence as a god.

Or, even the system of the labyrinth couldn't grasp the essence Taesan possessed.

"My true essence."

He decided to grasp that. Taesan set his next goal.

"Okay, let's go back."

"Okay."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan took a step back. Thanks to Taesan's speed, Amelia was able to follow him effortlessly.

She gazed blankly at Taesan's back.

"...It's too big."

Now that she had made a contract with the Sword Deity, she could understand Taesan's power to a deep extent.

Taesan was too powerful.

His power was as intense as the sun, capable of turning someone like her into ashes in an instant.

Amelia was feeling the same emotions that Taesan had felt when he saw the Transcendents.

"...Huh?"

As Amelia examined Taesan's power, she discovered something.

Deep within Taesan's heart, something was lodged.

She was Taesan's Sword Deity, the being closest to Taesan in this world.

But even she couldn't understand what that thing was.

Amelia tried to examine it closely, but it suddenly disappeared into an even deeper place.

"What is that?"

She tilted her head, but she couldn't figure out what it was.

There were only 4 days left until their return to Earth.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

During that time, Taesan used the devil's realm to create a few black magic spells that people could use conveniently. Although the magic consumption was minimal, it perfectly filled in the gaps that people lacked, leaving them in awe.

Additionally, he provided advice on various skill acquisition methods and strategies. People listened to Taesan's words with serious faces.

And Amelia, along with other Elron mode players, continued to engage in intense battles.

Among them, Amelia showed the greatest change.

Ka-ga-gak!

"Wow."

Diana let out a sigh of admiration.

"You've become stronger."

"I've become a saint, so this is only natural."

"No, it's not just about that. You've really become stronger."

Diana had thought that Amelia was exceptional, but her talent didn't quite reach her own level.

However, the movements she was showing now were entirely different.

Having let go of her self-doubt, she began to unfold her true talent.

"I can't just stand still either."

Diana grasped her sword with a serious face. Lee Tae-yeon, who was standing next to Taesan, muttered to himself.

"Amelia has become a saint. It's fitting. It seems like she's also resolved her inner conflicts."

"Did you know that?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's my specialty, isn't it? It's about doubting oneself and devouring one's own talents."

Lee Tae-yeon said proudly. Taesan chuckled.

"Isn't that a rather embarrassing thing to say?"

"It's not like that. I was worried about what to do, but you solved it for me, so thank you."

She suddenly burst out laughing.

"I created a monster... This is really godly. I've come a long way."

"I've come a long way. The road ahead is still long."

And on the last day before returning to the labyrinth.

Taesan began to tidy up.

Ki-ki-ki-ing!

The divine energy enveloped the entire earth. People cheered and gasped in amazement.

Taesan, who had greatly exercised his influence, declared:

"I'll kill them all."

[You have activated the declaration of death.]

Quadruple destruction!

The divine energy exploded.

The remaining monsters on earth were crushed and destroyed. They struggled, but the divine energy, like a heavenly punishment, trampled them.

In an instant, all the remaining monsters in the world were annihilated. People erupted in cheers.

Taesan, who had dealt with the last monster, gathered the divine energy in one place.

And then, he shot it towards the black hole in the sky.

Kwaaa-aaa-aaa!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The collision of powers.

The space distorts and the world shakes.

Taesan's face contorted.

The hole in the sky remained unchanged, as if mocking him.

'It's still not enough.'

But it will be different next time.

Taesan gathered his strength. The people's bodies began to return to the labyrinth.

Lee Tae-yeon waved his hand.

'See you next time.'

Taesan nodded in response.

And they returned to the labyrinth.

[Monster subjugation bonus + 2443] [Apostle subjugation bonus + 3154] [High priest's fragment subjugation bonus + 6814] [Victory bonus + 1115]

.

.

.

[Settlement complete] [15,876p will be paid.]

As soon as they escaped from the earth and returned to the labyrinth, the high rank and divinity began to plummet.

He was the god of the earth. When he left the earth, the power's restraint was born. His rank dropped, and his omnipotence disappeared. Taesan quietly realized his own situation.

'Am I barely a transcender?'

His power had been reduced to a level where he couldn't even use the transcender's authority properly."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But immortality has surpassed it."

He was still a transcender. At this level, it was less than expected.

Taesan grasped the link connected to Amelia. Amelia was situated in the labyrinth, checking the points.

[Do you hear me?] [Huh?]

Amelia was startled.

She looked around the empty space.

[...Taesan?] [I can hear you.]

The contract of the Sado was a transcender's privilege that ignored even the fragmented dimensions. Although it didn't have much significance since there was a community, the fact that it could be confirmed in real-time was sufficiently attractive.

[This is amazing.] [Go down diligently. If you need to, pray and call me.] [Okay, thank you.]

Taesan checked the points he had obtained.

15,876 points.

When added to the points he had obtained previously, it exceeded 20,000 points.

Then, how would he use these points? As he began to think about it, the labyrinth shook.

"Balbambara."

Because he had become a transcender, he could immediately sense the signs of power gathering and condensing. Soon, the administrator of the labyrinth, Balbambara, appeared.
