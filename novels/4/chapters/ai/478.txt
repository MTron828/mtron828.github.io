Article 479

479. 90th Floor. Wizard (5)

Until now, the physical body of Taesan has been greatly affected by the Mystic System.

Every time the strength, agility, intelligence, and physical strength numbers changed, the body would also change. It was in a state of dependence on the system, unable to be independent.

However, now it has broken free from that dependence and has acquired a completely independent physical body.

Taesan clenched and unclenched his fists repeatedly.

The sensations within the body. The feeling of external stimuli through the skin.

Everything was different from what it was before.

"Ah."

The wizard let out a mocking laugh.

He quietly applauded.

"Congratulations. I didn't expect to reach this level. I can use the boundary line in this way too. What did you learn?"

"What about my origins."

Although not perfect, he gained an understanding of where he came from and from where he went wrong. The wizard looked at him with interest.
Here is the translation:

"Although I'm curious, I shouldn't say anything. You shouldn't tell anyone else about it either. It's a problem related to your foundation. There's no good in letting others know."

"That's what I'm thinking."

After answering, Tae-san's body began to tremble. He needed time to control the powerful energy that was welling up inside him, and the mage waited with a smile.

Tae-san checked the powers he had obtained while adjusting his physical body.

He had just discovered a new method of using the boundary's power.

That's why his skill proficiency had increased significantly. Among them, the black-colored skill was the most obvious.

[Transcendence: Black] [Proficiency: 42%] [Consumption: ???] [Law of Creation before the Beginning: @#@!]

Originally, the explanation of the black-colored skill was scattered and didn't make sense, so it was impossible to understand its contents.

As it reached 40%, some of the contents began to appear.

"'Before the Creation, and the Law...'"

The content itself wasn't particularly new. He had inferred that the high god existed before the Creation. The part about the Law was probably about corrupting and destroying the Law.

The information itself was not new from the beginning. The important thing was the practical change that occurred when it reached 40%.

Tae-san, who was trying to understand the black-colored power within his body, realized something.
Here is the translation of the text:

The amount of black energy has increased.

It's more than twice the amount of previous times.

"Many!"

Compared to the sacred energy of Taesan, the black energy was overwhelmingly inferior. I had always been worried about the imbalance, but it seems that the balance has been restored to some extent.

Other skills also seem to have improved significantly, but the system window is distorted and difficult to verify.

However, it's unlikely that the small amount of black energy will rise significantly. It might be comparable to the increase in black energy.

"Phew..."

Taesan exhaled.

His body began to fall under his control, and an immense power that couldn't be hidden was felt within his body.

Taesan stretched out his hand. As Taesan's power manifested, the faint black energy suddenly appeared in the world.

There was almost no delay. It was as natural as drawing a boundary like a puppet.

Taesan laughed.

"It was worth the effort to harmonize."

He merged the crystallized divine blood and the world-crushing bloodstain.
Here is the translation of the text:

It wasn't simply a matter of breaking down the boundaries and forcing them to become one, but rather, it was a process of harmonizing their characteristics and integrating them into the body.

As a result, the body of Taesan simultaneously possessed the characteristics of spirit and physical strength, which had never existed before.

The biggest reason Taesan had difficulties in dealing with boundaries was that his physical body was ordinary.

The high stats allowed him to transcend the realm of mortals, and the divine power forced his body to be elevated, but the basic structure was still that of this world.

The black and the boundary line, which existed beyond the laws, were not optimized for dealing with boundaries, causing a significant burden. To alleviate this burden, he had to invest a lot of mental effort into controlling his power.

However, now his body is no longer that of this world.

He has undergone a transformation into his own unique body.

As a result, he is able to freely deal with the boundaries like a free spirit.

"It's good."

The spirit and physical strength are both too intense and incompatible. If they were to be combined, there would be a high possibility of creating an excessively refined equipment.
Here is the translation of the text:

Then, he directly applied it to his physical body. He judged that only his physical body could perfectly handle two materials, and the result was a perfect success.

Tai Shan clenched his fist and swung it. The air burst forth, and the void was swept away. The power of a simple punch had increased significantly compared to before.

"'The influence of stats is still being received,'"

but dependence had disappeared. His physical foundation was completed with blood and sweat.

His physical body had changed to suit Tai Shan's, and his self-sustaining ability had also been strengthened. His recovery speed had accelerated, and the amount had increased as well.

And the apostolic gift had also changed.

[Special activation skill: Chaos Storm] [The power of the apostolic gift, bestowed by numerous gods, had changed into something new. For one hour, the magic power increases significantly, allowing one to gain control over dark magic. The consumption of magic power is significantly reduced. Additionally, the body becomes synchronized with the holy and dark forces, allowing one to perfectly handle two powers and even absorb chaos into the body. This skill can only be used once after activation and is valid for one day.]

The apostolic gift had changed into a new skill.
Here is the translation of the text:

The newly acquired effect is a perfect coordination between the physical body, spirituality, and darkness. And it's as if chaos is contained within the physical body.

The divine power sent by the gods has undergone a perfect transformation.

There was a huge and significant change overall, and the core of it was something special.

"[The Vessel] [The Vessel. It can hold and contain many things.]"

The skill description was extremely brief, and its content was also incomprehensible.

However, Taesan knew about it.

Among the new skills he had acquired, this one was the most important.

"'What is this thing?'"

Amelia said that the part of his divine name was empty. And the newly acquired skill also had a blank name.

What is this blankness?

Finding out what it is seems to be a crucial task.

"Is the confirmation over?"

"Yes."

Taesan nodded his head. The mage smiled.

"You may not be perfect, but you've discovered something about yourself. As a result, many things have changed, and you've gained new powers. That's a great achievement."

The air changes.

The mage's aura and his domain begin to gradually occupy the space.
Here is the translation of the text:

"But in the end, the 90th quest was one that shattered me. If I couldn't achieve it, it would be useless, and I knew that."

"Can the power he obtained reach him?"

To this question, Taesan pulled out his sword and answered with a gesture.

"Look at it. Show me the new realm you've reached."

The mage trembled.

The shockwave spread out.

An incomprehensible and fundamental power, which could no longer be found, shook the labyrinth.

This was the power of the mage's domain.

It was the authority of a great transcendent being who governed the laws. Taesan was unable to block the mage's light, which was as weak as a feather.

But now it's different.

[You have activated the Disorder.]

Disorder begins to settle into Taesan's body.

Setting the boundary line on the body was a method I had used many times before, but it was just a way to force the boundary line to be suppressed, and to surround the body with a makeshift barrier.

But now it's different.

The boundary line wraps around Taesan's entire body, grasping his arms, legs, and entire body without a gap.

It's trembling.

Soon, Taesan's face is also enveloped in a dark mist.

The boundary line has wrapped Taesan like armor.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san was holding his sword as usual. His sword, Bardray, was also completely covered in a dark gray mist.

He was about to swing it to contain everything.

"Waaaah!"

The dark gray mist burst forth and collided with the magical waves that the wizard had mixed in. The waves warped and twisted. Tae-san poured even more power into it.

"Kaaaah!"

The waves broke apart.

"...What is this?"

The wizard's eyes trembled. He couldn't see Tae-san beyond the boundary that he could perceive with his vision.

It wasn't just a simple boundary.

He had compressed the chaotic zone into the shape of armor.

Tae-san stamped his foot.

[You have activated acceleration.] [You have activated skill acceleration.]

He accelerated rapidly. It was extremely fast, to the point where even the wizard couldn't respond properly.

The wizard swung his arm with a serious face.

The waves burst forth and pushed Tae-san away.

That was the wizard's authority, the power to create all systems and laws, forming the foundation of the labyrinth.

"Waaaah!"

He maintained the boundary that enveloped his entire body more firmly and moved forward.

The acceleration and skill acceleration that Tae-san had activated were not cancelled.

"Ha ha ha!"

The wizard couldn't help but laugh.
Here is the translation of the text:

Of course, it was not a trivial matter. But it was not a gentle attack either. It was a wave that could not be blocked at all unless there was a counterpart.

Tae-san was enduring it, and it was approaching him.

"Ah, it's great! Very great!"

The one who had burst into laughter roughly kicked his leg.

Ki-ki-ki!

The labyrinth began to move according to its owner's intentions.

Ku-ku-ku-ku!

The law that had protected Tae-san until then, now moved with hostility towards Tae-san.

Tae-san drew his sword. The gray light collided with the brick wall, causing it to shatter into pieces. With the gray light that surrounded his entire body, he forcibly suppressed and resisted the law of the labyrinth that was trying to expel him.

The magician snapped his fingers.

[The magician had activated the creator's authority.]

Chi-chi-chi!

A sound of tearing and a mysterious force that could not be seen flew towards Tae-san, covering him.

Ku-uu-uu!

Tae-san's entire body shook for a moment.

Tae-san realized what force was covering him.

This was the highest law that formed the labyrinth.

Only the magician who created the labyrinth could wield the absolute authority that could pierce through Tae-san's skills and stats, making them meaningless.

Those affected by the labyrinth's system could never escape.
Here is the translation of the text:

But the gray mist did not penetrate the Taesan.

Although it was shaken and distorted by the magic's power, it did not reveal Taesan's appearance to the world. It perfectly protected its master from the laws of the world.

Hmph.

Taesan advanced.

As he took another step forward, a crushing burden fell upon him. However, he maintained his mental clarity even more firmly and dispelled the gray mist.

In this way, Taesan reached the magic's threshold.

Zzzt!

In that moment, an unparalleled energy enveloped Taesan.

The gray mist that had enveloped him was stripped away, and his body was exposed.

The magic's power seized Taesan, holding him in its grasp.

Gggg!

But Taesan did not retreat or yield.

His body is no longer of this world.

Nor is it of the heavens.

It is only his own body.

He resists the magic's power head-on. Taesan barely endures and brandishes his sword.

The magician lightly extended his hand. The sword was grasped by his hand.

Tzzt!

The gray mist devoured the law that bound the magician, causing it to collapse.
Here is the translation of the text:

But it's occupied by a new one.

Even if I try to break it down and crush it, a new law will occupy the position once again.

So, it's corrupted.

The gray mist in the mage's hand trembles for a moment.

It seeps into the mage's law, not to break or crush it, or pollute it.

The mage's law begins to corrupt the area.

"Ha!"

The mage hastily tried to pull back his hand, but it was too late. The law that protected him had taken in the boundary like opening a path.

Kwa-jik.

The sword is stuck in the chest of the Nine-Tailed Fox.

Paa-a-a!

At the same time, the wind bursts forth, and the pressure that had been pressing down on the mountain disappears.

The mountain took a breath. Its face was full of an unstoppable smile.

He has just taken a blow from one of the strongest in the world.

[You have launched a significant attack on a high-ranking opponent. You have obtained the special skill [Absolute Resistance].]

"...I didn't expect it to break through so soon."

The mage, who was laughing sarcastically, nodded his head.

"It's successful."
"Level 90 quest completed. The mage rewards you with a suitable compensation for your achievement."
