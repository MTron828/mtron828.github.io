259. Believers of the Old Magic (Part 4)

"Minerva, how's your stamina?"

"I'm still okay, but I'm not ready to take on all of them."

"Then let's keep moving away from them for now."

"Okay."

Minerva took Anetsha and Kwaned and flew away again.

Just before leaving, Anetsha shouted urgently,

"My Lord Taesan! Be careful!"

Taesan nodded and raised his sword.

Taesan kicked at dozens of contorted beings rushing towards him.

"You have activated acceleration."

Kwaaaang!

Acceleration surged like an explosion. A contorted demon standing in his path was split in half without knowing anything.

"Get him!"

"Oh God! Show me your grace!"

They charged at Taesan, who had plunged into their midst. Taesan moved both hands.

"You have activated continuous attacks."

As the proficiency of the Ability Sword reached 40%, new skills emerged.

One of them was continuous attacks, combining physical sword strikes with illusionary ones.

Traces of the sword were drawn.
The lingering images whirl around like a storm in all directions. Taesan swings his sword forcefully. Phantom sword strikes are unleashed in eight directions.

"Aaaah!"

"Kahak!"

Even staggered demons, some as high as the twentieth floor, with a few reaching the thirtieth.

Yet all are slain with a single continuous attack skill. The power emanating from their fallen bodies gathers to Taesan.

"You have activated Strong Strike."

He swings the sword fiercely downward.

The ground shatters and the aftermath spreads in all directions. He sweeps away the surviving demons.

"Chase them!"

The barely surviving ones stagger to their feet and shout.

"Catch him! This is an offering to our god!"

Taesan frowns at the relentless charge, ignoring even death.

He faces them head-on. Dozens of demons rush towards Taesan from the front.

"It never ends."

"You have activated Starlight Arrow."

A light arrow materializes in Taesan's hand.

He launches it towards the demons charging directly at him. They attempt to block, but to no avail.

*Kuuuuung!*

The light explodes.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

A blinding light, as if the world were ending, engulfed everything. And when the light subsided, there was no one left.

"Have we finished tidying up?"

Though they sensed the approaching presence in the distance, there was still considerable distance to cover. Pursuing them would take quite some time due to their movements.

"Master, are we going too fast? Even chasing them down is exhausting."

Minerva landed with a slightly weary expression.

"Are you alright, Master Tae-san?"

"I'm fine."

Using magic had only tired him temporarily; he could recover completely within an hour.

"This is quite bothersome."

Although they had tidied up for now, if this was a direct decree from the gods, they would continue to show themselves in the future. And they would likely attempt to kill Tae-san.

It was literally going to be an endless pursuit.

"I won't let these things trip me up."

It was impossible to eliminate all of them. They needed to find the core parts.

But even Tae-san didn't know where that was.

"Let's scout around for now."

* * *

Tae-san raced across the abandoned land at high speed.

Continuing to attempt detection, he sought out where power was concentrated.
However, it wasn't found. The area was vast enough that even Anesha couldn't detect all of it. It wouldn't be unusual for the search to take several months.

"It's going to be tough."

As Taesan pressed forward, he sensed something.

There was a presence rushing towards this place at an incredibly fast speed, a formidable entity. Taesan halted his steps.

"Hahaha! Found you!"

The demon swung down his sword along with a radiant laugh.

Clang.

Swords clashed.

The opponent didn't yield easily and swung their sword. They pressed Taesan and revealed themselves.

"Excellent! What luck! To think you were so close by! Truly, the great god has been watching over me!"

The demon exclaimed with excitement.

"I am the tenth finger of the great god! You cannot be my match!"

"Finger?"

"It means I hold the position of the strongest demon in this place!"

In other words, the demon before Taesan was the tenth strongest in this location.

The demon looked at Taesan with delight.

The message came down, reaching the man as well. He was excited to have the opportunity to be chosen by the great god, and once again excited to be closest to the target's location.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

It was a unique opportunity that could be chosen by the great god.

"Submit quietly! Human!"

The demon charged forward, revealing its true form. Taesan raised his sword.

[You activated Evade.]

The opponent's sword clashed, suddenly veering off course.

Naturally, the direction of the opponent's strength faltered, exposing a significant flaw. Despite the surprise, Taesan did not let the opportunity slip.

[You activated Strong Attack.]

Kraaang!

"Ha!"

The opponent's sword was deflected.

Desperately trying to create distance was futile. Taesan kicked forward.

[You activated Accelerate.]

In an instant, accelerated force pierced through the opponent's body.

"Cough!"

"Strong indeed."

The opponent was not weak. In the labyrinth analogy, they could probably reach up to the 50th floor by a narrow margin.

But that was all.

"How... how could..."

"Just in case... Can you tell me the locations of the Thorn and the Saint?"

"Cough! Infidel! Shut up!"

The demon shouted as it died.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"God has already chosen you! Everyone here is targeting you! You will slowly wither away and die."

The demon shouted harshly. Madness filled his eyes, making normal conversation impossible.

His mind was already shattered. Even if he used emotional interference skills, it would be difficult to have any effect.

"Then die."

Taesan swung his sword.

He kept moving.

* * *

"Haha! Found you!"

A demon gasped, panting heavily. He had sprinted with all his might, his legs trembling as if he might collapse any moment.

Excited, he rushed towards Taesan.

Taesan clicked his tongue irritably.

"You triggered Frost Arrow."

Pffft.

The demon's head was pierced through.

Silence returned.

"How annoying."

Taesan clicked his tongue again.

The ground was vast, so it took quite some time for staggering demons to appear after moving once.

However, one or two demons continued to emerge incessantly.

There was no issue in dealing with them, but there was no opportunity for rest.

Taesan moved his feet again.
Here's the translation of the text:

"You activated Leap." "You activated Scout."

Scanning the surroundings, he saw only the devils approaching. Nothing special was visible.

"It's really hard to find them like this."

He needed information.

But the devils here were all soaked in madness and wouldn't give the answers Taisan wanted.

First, he had to extinguish that madness and bring them back to their senses.

Taisan moved to find the thorns first.

As Taisan moved, he could see a few devils running towards him. He began to take them down one by one.

"Ah, found you!"

As he approached the devil who reacted to Taisan and tried to swing his sword down, his senses warned him.

Reacting reflexively, Taisan moved his sword.

Kaaang!

With a fierce recoil, Taisan's body was pushed back. Amidst the devils, a surprised young voice rang out.

"You blocked that? It was a timing I wouldn't be able to do again."

"That's why I said I would do it. Why did you interfere?"

"If it were you, you would've been counterattacked and had your jugular cut."

Laughter echoed.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

태산이 시선을 돌렸다.
Taesan turned his gaze.

마족 넷이 태산에게 걸어오고 있었다.
Four demons were approaching Taesan.

“휴. 뭐 이리 빠른지. 역시 신께서 성자의 이름을 빌려 직접 계시를 내릴만한 힘은 가지고 있어.”
"Hm. Why are they so fast? Indeed, they must possess power worthy of invoking the name of the saint directly."

“이쪽으로 오지 않았으면 추적에 상당히 시간이 걸렸을 것 같네.”
"If they hadn't come this way, tracking them would have taken quite some time."

“아, 아아…….”
"Ah, aah...."

운 좋게 목숨을 구한 마족이 주춤거리며 물러난다.
The demon, lucky to have escaped with his life, hesitated and stepped back.

광기에 물든 이들마저 거리를 벌릴만한 권위가 저들에게 있다는 의미였다.
Even these crazed individuals held enough authority to command respect.

“다섯 번째, 세 번째, 첫 번째, 여섯 번째 손가락…….”
"Fifth, third, first, sixth fingers...."

마족이 경의와 두려움을 보인다. 이곳에서 상당한 자리에 있는 이들이란 뜻이었다.
The demons showed respect and fear. It meant they held significant positions here.

태산이 물었다.
Taesan asked.

“너희도 손가락이냐?”
"Are you fingers too?"

“그래. 마계에서 성자를 제외하고 가장 강한 열 명이다. 숫자가 낮은 손가락일수록 강한 힘을 가지고 있지.”
"Yeah. We are among the top ten strongest in the Demon Realm, excluding saints. The lower the number of the finger, the stronger the power."

주먹이 무기인 듯한 근육질의 남자가 자랑스레 말했다. 태산이 물끄러미 그를 바라봤다.
A muscular man who seemed to treat his fists as weapons proudly spoke. Taesan looked at him calmly.

“그럼 네가 첫 번째겠네.”
"Then you must be the first."

강했다.
He was strong.

저 정도 힘이라면 60층까지도 내려갈 수 있었다.
With that level of strength, he could descend to the 60th floor.
Here's the translation of the provided text:

"If you invest time to the extent that it could be called legendary, could you become that strong even from the outside?"

"Wow."

The man revealed this.

"You have the eyes to perceive that? You're indeed strong."

"Only twelve fingers? Where are the rest?"

"They refused to cooperate. They said they're after their own opportunities. They're fools who erect useless pride against the command of the great god."

"Is that so? That's convenient."

At Tae-san's words, the man's face twisted.

"... Do you think the four of us can win? How arrogant."

"Yeah."

Tae-san nodded and rolled his foot.

"[You have activated Apostle Transformation [Mixed Divine Power].] [You have activated the King's Vessel.]"

Thunk!

A great burden settled on Tae-san. He immediately shifted that burden onto his ring and gathered his strength.

Tae-san's presence roughened the space.

The man who called himself the First Finger's face stiffened.

"You?"

"Let's finish this quickly."

Tae-san rolled his foot.
Here's the translation of the text to English:

In an instant, they all missed Taesan's movement. When they appeared again, he was swinging his sword down in front of the sixth finger.

"Ugh!"

The sixth finger gasped and raised its shield.

Upon contact with Taesan's sword, it crumpled and slammed into the ground.

As they attempted to finish him off, the remaining fingers regained their senses and moved.

They swiftly launched their attacks towards Taesan.

Taesan's hand moved.

The swords drew diagonals, distorting and smashing the trajectory of their attacks.

In an instant, they collapsed, trampling over shields. Craters formed on the ground as the sixth finger spat blood.

"This!"

"You have activated Mephisto's Black Lightning Sword."

Crackle!

Lightning pierced through the remaining three at once.

Their movements momentarily halted. Taesan thrust his sword towards the shield, shattering it.

"I, I never imagined this!"

It was the dying words of the sixth finger.

"You!"

The now loosened fingers rushed in fiercely, and Taesan lowered his stance.

"You have activated Marcosias' Fake Flame."

Material shaped like flames surged and engulfed Taesan.
The first finger wrinkles its nose and clenches its fist.

"Just with this kind of distraction! Do you think you can deceive me?"

Pew-ung!

Fake flames burst forth from the fist. However, it was expected. Fake flames, used without even opening a passage, couldn't deceive someone on the 60th floor.

What Taesan aimed for was a cover in sight.

[You activated stealth.]

"Huh!"

Stealth transformed into Ability Sword. Its effect allows you to evade detection for one second when concealing your appearance from the opponent.

[You activated shoes that leap to the end of the world. Teleport a very short distance.]

Instantly appearing right in front of the fifth finger.

Startled by Taesan's vanished presence, he suddenly opens his eyes widely and tries to block Taesan, who has appeared in front of him, with his sword.

[You activated strong strike.] [You activated blade of determination.]

Crunch.

"Huh?"

The sword shatters into pieces and half of the fifth finger's body is slashed apart.

"You, you!"

In an instant, both are dead.
What remained were only the third and first fingers. The first finger sharpened its teeth and shouted, "Make way! Support me from behind!"

The third finger was one who wielded rare power even in forsaken lands, harnessing the ancient force spread across the ground. With his support, they could become twice as strong as usual.

Taesan calmly pointed his finger at the third finger.

"You have initiated a forced duel."

Kaang!

The first finger's fist recoiled the moment it touched Taesan.

The third finger desperately tried to muster strength, but was notably slower than Taesan's approach. In an instant, the third finger also perished.

"You... you!"

"Could there really be a way to face this guy by the numbers?"

With just one forced duel, the story came to an end. No matter how much numerical superiority they displayed, once a forced duel was issued, it was essentially one-on-one.

"Why didn't you use a forced duel from the beginning?"

"Because I hadn't used the skills I had just acquired. I wanted to get a feel for them."

Acquiring skills was not the end but the beginning; one had to practice and familiarize oneself with them through use.
Roughly confirming, Taesan approached the remaining finger.

The finger, which had fallen limp, stared at the three who had collapsed.

All those who had spent an incalculable amount of time together were miserably dead.

"...You!"

"Whoa."

Taesan raised his sword.

* * *

"Cough!"

The first finger was strong.

Strength at the level of the 60th floor in the labyrinth. Not even the Demon King could be his match.

But Taesan now possessed the power to see even to the entrance of the abyssal depths.

With enhanced spirit and the vessel of a king activated, there was no way he could be matched.

"Ha, hahaha... It's me! It's me!"

The first finger shouted, denying reality.

He had trained through an incalculable amount of time. He had strived to become stronger over time to the point where his mind became distant. He had continued to fight without pause against the strong.

There was no death here, but it did not mean there was no suffering. He had lived his whole life enduring pain.

In the end, he became the strongest here.

Even in the Demon World, he thought there was no one who could oppose him. Besides saints, he believed himself to be the strongest.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

But this, to face death at the hands of an outsider. He couldn't accept it.

"This can't be happening. I can't die like this...."

Taesan thrust his sword into his throat.

With a futile voice, the light vanished from his eyes.

"Hmm."

Taesan clenched and unclenched his fist repeatedly. He couldn't check the system window because it was turned off, but a strange sensation continued to arise as he faced his fingers.

The activation of Spiritual Rise indicated that something had changed.

He wanted to confirm it, but there was something else he had to do first.

Taesan looked around.

The faces of the twisted demons watching the fight lost their madness.

"What is this...."

Here were overwhelmingly powerful individuals. The four of them couldn't do anything and died. The belief in the god that dominated their minds faded in the face of their miserable sight.

Now was the chance.

If madness disappeared and reason emerged, feelings of terror would also arise.

[You have triggered Laum's emotional fluctuation.] [You have triggered emotional interference.]

"Ugh!"

--- 

This translation captures the essence of the original text while maintaining its narrative flow and key details.
The slimy things spread out in all directions. Taesan sensed terror, not madness, freezing the faces of the demons.

"Gah! S-s-save me!"

A plea for life, not a scream tainted with madness.

Taesan grinned coldly and grabbed his throat.

"I'll spare you. Just answer one thing."
