**Chapter 586**

**586. Extra Story, Cleanup (4)**

"I've heard that they're a species that doesn't interact with other groups."

That's why, despite being the strongest, they were almost unknown. In fact, they had become like the Galapagos Islands, isolated and unique. It was a peculiar point that they remained the strongest even after becoming isolated.

"I am Naria. The representative of that place. Hashiangka."

The woman spoke quietly.

"Where is he?"

He must be the only one. Kim Hwi-yeon opened his mouth.

"We don't know the exact location either. But... he's here."

"He's not moving. Well, that's to be expected."

Hashiangka's voice was tinged with regret. She looked around the interior of the building.

"It's been devastated."

Although she had brought the Narians to a relatively intact building, the signs of destruction were still evident.

"But it hasn't been destroyed. I've heard that you people saved the universe here. The planet is still maintaining its form as a planet. It's amazing."

"We did our best, in our own way."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It seems like many things have been destroyed. Well, it's nuclear power, after all. I've never seen anything like it in history."

Hasiangka muttered in amazement. Amelia scowled.

"Did you come just to give a simple review? Why did you come?"

Instead of answering, Hasiangka stretched out her hand into the air. The space screamed and began to tear apart.

When her hand came out of the space, a small sphere was in it.

"......That's..."

Iteayeon's gaze changed. She could sense the power contained within the small sphere.

"With just this small orb, we won't have to worry about energy for at least a few hundred years."

"Yes, yes?"

Kim Hwiyeon was taken aback by the unexpected words. And Hasiangka's subsequent words left her even more stunned.

"I'll give this to you. I'll also give you the auxiliary machine. I'll teach you how to use it."

"Suddenly?"

A civilization that had been isolated from other species, like the Galapagos Islands, was suddenly offering them technology. It was an incomprehensible act.

Hasiangka cleared up their doubts.

"Let's call it respect. Or rather, it's closer to repayment."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Payback?"

"You guys saved the universe."

At those words, they realized the extent of Hashiangka's actions.

"It's a fact. Those terrifying beings are extremely powerful. There were also monsters that exceeded our understanding. We clashed with them multiple times. We managed to defeat them somehow, but we lost quite a few planets in the process."

"......You did it with your own power? Is that possible?"

Amelia was shocked. Hashiangka said they exceeded understanding, which meant they were at least S-grade. It might even mean they fought against a saint.

The fact that they handled it without relying on the power of a transcendent or an immortal, but with their own power, was unbelievable.

"We are strong."

Hashiangka's voice was filled with pride.

"We don't rely on powerful individuals, but with the technological prowess we've built up, we can shake the universe."

A transcendent is a being that dominates the concept of the universe itself. The God of Anger controls all anger in the universe, and the God of Magic controls all magic that exists in the universe.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As long as the Narians don't exert their influence over the entire universe, they can't reach the Transcendents.

But somehow, they were able to reach the Immortals. Extremely advanced technology made it possible to reach even the most powerful individuals.

'We are strong. We believe that one day, we can even reach the universe itself.'

With time, we can even reach the Transcendents.

That's the origin of the Narians. Amelia had an ambiguous expression.

'That's going to be difficult.'

'It's not impossible. Our species has always deeply desired it in our hearts. But... we thought we wouldn't be able to achieve it and would eventually perish.'

Hasiangka smiled wryly.

The concept of 'Gosin' is something that exists beyond the universe. No matter how strong they become, they can't dominate the concept, but rather use it to become stronger. It's impossible to defeat the absolute Gosin.

'To be honest, we thought we would lose.'

In the end, the universe will fall into the hands of the Gosin."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Narin people were doing such calculations. The Transcendents had weakened since the previous war, but the power of the Gods remained the same. No matter how you looked at it, the possibility of victory was not visible.

In reality, the Narin people were rapidly losing their territory to the Gods' attacks. They could somehow manage to defeat S-grade monsters, but they couldn't possibly counter the Apostles. They could only hold on, and that was all.

They waited calmly for their destruction.

But they won.

And it was all thanks to the power of a single, extremely strong individual, which they had denied.

"We have reverence for the existence known as Gang Tae-san."

Hasiangka's voice trembled with emotion. A single, overwhelmingly powerful individual had defeated the Gods and saved the universe.

They could even reach the Transcendents.

But they would never be able to reach Gang Tae-san.

The Narin people acknowledged Tae-san in their hearts. Kim Hwi-yeon's face was filled with surprise at this fact.

"Is... that so?"

"You may not know it yourselves, but most beings in the universe are aware of Gang Tae-san. Many people, excluding our tribe, are grateful to him."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's unthinkable that we wouldn't know. The universe was on the brink of destruction, after all. It was only after listening to Hasiangka's words that Kim Hwi-yeon realized that Gang Tae-san had truly saved the entire universe.

"'You guys are the ones he protected and saved. If you think about it, we're just extras.'

Hasiangka repeated the motion of tossing and catching a ball.

"'The great being who saved the universe wouldn't need our help. But we wanted to do something for him in our own way. So, we decided to provide you with technology.'

"That was the reason Hasiangka came to Earth.

Kim Hwi-yeon's eyes slowly lit up.

"'You're going to provide us with your technology?'

"'Not all of it. We need to maintain balance. But we'll send a technician to educate you so you can understand.'

Kim Hwi-yeon clenched his fist tightly. If Hasiangka's words were true, their biggest worry would be resolved. They would be able to obtain more advanced technology beyond just recovering their damaged technology.

"'The price for that is...'"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Material compensation is not necessary. This is a reward in itself. It's not an action that seeks compensation. Moreover, even if you receive something from us, it's not valuable to us."

The Narai people, who had conquered multiple galaxies, didn't care about the resources at the level of a single solar system.

There was no need to give them anything. Kim Hwi-yeon's face was filled with joy, and Amelia opened her mouth.

"Does saying that material compensation is not necessary mean that other compensation is necessary?"

Hashiangka smiled faintly.

"It's not a big deal. Considering the hardships you've faced so far, it's a very light thing."

"Speak quickly. What is it?"

"Your strength."

The purple-eyed gaze turned to Amelia.

"Show us what you've built."

* * *

"......What you've built?"

"Kang Tae-san is strong. He can save this universe alone. That's undeniable."

Hashiangka raised her finger, pointing to the end.

"Then what have you done? Have you done your part in saving this universe?"

A piercing question that struck at the core.

Kim Hwi-yeon couldn't open his mouth. Hashiangka continued to speak calmly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Did we truly support Kang Tae-san, the giant, enough?"

"……."

No one could easily answer.

If they hadn't been there, would Kang Tae-san have failed? At least, they couldn't be certain.

"Of course, under a giant like him, everyone becomes insignificant. I'm not trying to apply an unfair standard to you. I'm just curious. About your strength."

"Don't beat around the bush and just say it straight out. You want to test us, don't you?"

Amelia chuckled.

"It's about whether we have the qualifications to stand by his side, or if we're just holding onto his ankles."

Hashiangka smiled quietly.

"I won't deny it. I don't know. Did you guys do your part, or did you cling to his side and struggle to survive?"

Hashiangka fiddled with a bead.

"There are many in this universe who envy you. The one who saved the universe is directly protecting it, and it's not unreasonable to consider it his territory. If I were in that position, my name would be known throughout the universe."

"How pitiful."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Despicable jealousy. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I'm one of them too. So, I want to verify it. Do you guys really have the qualifications to be under Kang Tae-san's wing?"

"Okay."

Amelia had a confident expression.

"It's Lee Tae-yeon. What's going on?"

"I'll yield."

"I will too. Let my sister handle it."

"That's right."

Amelia smiled brightly and stepped forward. She introduced herself with confidence and elegance.

"I am the one you've been longing for and revering, Kang Tae-san's disciple."

"Disciple...?"

Disciple, a direct subordinate of Kang Tae-san. Hashiang's eyes sparkled. Amelia snapped her fingers.

"Let's do this. I'll clear up your doubts."

"Alright."

Hashiang stood up from his seat with a fierce gaze.

A short while later, they arrived at the abandoned land.

With Amelia in front of him, Hashiang clenched his fists tightly. The mechanical devices all over his body began to make loud noises as they started to operate.

"Then let's begin. I hope you can live up to my expectations."

Hashiang took a step forward. The ground shook violently with a loud rumble.

"Whistle."

Amelia whistled.

"It's intense."

It wasn't just the power of the simple suit. Hashiang's own strength was by no means weak either.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'm a Naria-in. Specifically, a genetically engineered warrior."

Hashiangka said with a serious tone.

"Everyone who's come here is the same. We're Naria-in, genetically engineered for battle."

A being who has surpassed the limits of their species, having refined their abilities through repeated modifications.

That was Hashiangka. Amelia murmured in awe.

"Can I call you a genius created artificially? Is this what it means to be an extremely advanced civilization? It's like a sci-fi movie."

Amelia was genuinely impressed. Hashiangka's passion was ignited as he spoke.

"By the way, this battle is being broadcast in real-time to our civilization."

"That's a pleasant thing to hear."

"Please, don't disappoint me."

Just as Hashiangka was about to charge forward, Amelia raised her hand.

"Wait a minute."

Hashiangka stopped.

"...Why?"

"Do you think you can take them on alone?"

"What's...that supposed to mean?"

Amelia pointed her finger behind Hashiangka. There were ten Naria-in standing there.

"Let's all go together. It's no fun if you're alone."

* * *

"..."

Note: Naria-in seems to be a term specific to this story, and I've left it untranslated as it's likely a fictional concept.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Hashiangka's face stiffens. With an expression filled with humiliation, he gazes at Amelia.

"...... I am Hashiangka. The great Colosseum of our civilization. The place where the strongest among the Narians are chosen, and I am the one who has taken the seat of victory."

"Ah, I see."

Amelia nods her head.

"I understand. So, you're going to take on everyone?"

"...... First, I'll crush that arrogance."

Hashiangka tightens his grip on his feet.

Amelia is the Disciple of Taesan. However, not all Disciples are strong.

Hashiangka knows what they've been through and how much time has passed since they became strong. Although Amelia is the Disciple of Taesan, Hashiangka believes that there are limits to her power, no matter how short a time it has been.

Perhaps she was designated as a Disciple to help her survive, but her power itself is not that remarkable. That was Hashiangka's judgment, and it was not a mistaken one.

"During the battle, his authority......"

"I don't think that way. This time, I'll only use my own power, so don't worry."

"That's good."

Hashiangka smiles faintly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Then, let's start by crushing his pride."

As soon as he finishes speaking, Hashiangka charges forward. The ground explodes, and a crater forms. Hashiangka suddenly appears right in front of Amelia.

Hashiangka clenches his fist and throws a punch. Amelia lightly tilts her head to dodge it.

Whoa!

A powerful gust of wind blows, sweeping everything in front of them violently. Amelia feels the shockwave next to her ear and lets out a small whistle.

"Fast and strong."

Hashiangka lifts his foot, and Amelia leaps backward to avoid it. The ground explodes again, and debris flies everywhere, blocking their view.

And Hashiangka doesn't miss the opportunity. In an instant, he moves to the side and lifts his foot, striking down.

Whoa!

A crater forms in the ground, and the earth shakes as if there's an earthquake. Kang Joon-hyuk, who's watching, can't help but exclaim in admiration.

"That's strong."

"Indeed."

Lee Tae-yeon also nods in agreement. The power Hashiangka is displaying right now is not ordinary.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is it just that level without any external help? It doesn't seem like it's just physical ability, and it seems like she's receiving support from her armor too."

Hasiangka was able to reach S-grade monsters.

"It's not like there's only one or two of those kinds of beings. They must have been able to block the attacks of the gods with their own power."

Hasiangka stood out among them, but it wasn't like she was overwhelmingly the strongest.

Moreover, she was just an individual. Their warships or spaceships, which were collections of advanced technology, would have even greater destructive power.

That was the civilization of the strongest in the universe.

Lee Tae-yeon couldn't help but be amazed.

"But it's not like we can reach that level."

Kwagagaga!

The battle continued, and Hasiangka's face hardened.

She was now using all her strength to attack Amelia.

But she didn't even come close to hitting her. Amelia wasn't moving that fast, but she was dodging with incredibly light movements, as if she could read all of Hasiangka's movements.

"Is it that level?"

Amelia, who had dodged all the attacks, nodded her head.

"Then it's my turn now."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Amelia raises her fist. Hashianka didn't dodge. The defense of the armor she wore was unimaginable. It could withstand even a single shot from a warship's main cannon.

She withstood it with her body and counterattacked. Hashianka quickly made a judgment.

And that judgment was a misjudgment.

Thud.

Her fist hit the armor, and the armor made a sound that shouldn't be possible.

Hashianka realized too late that he had made a mistake, but by then it was already too late.

Boom!

With a loud noise, Hashianka was slammed into the ground.
