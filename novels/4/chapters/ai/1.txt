2. Easy Mode Player (2)

From a distance, Jung-geun approached Taesan casually.

"You've worked hard."

"You came?"

"Of course I had to come watch my brother fight."

"Don't talk nonsense."

Taesan accepted the potato Jung-geun threw at him. His face wrinkled at the cold, chilled potato that had lost its warmth.

"This is why I didn't want you to come."

Since it was too much trouble to return to the restaurant, he had no choice but to eat it. It had been a long time since Lee Changchun had disappeared from his mind. Jung-geun alone admired the fallen Lee Changchun.

"Wow, hyung, you're really amazing. Even though he's a hard mode player, taking him down in one hit."

"Is it really impressive to take down such a weakling?"

"He's not exactly weak..."

Jung-geun said hesitantly.

Changchun was strong.

In addition, it is a very useful skill that is very rare among hard mode players, and strength is also a very useful skill.

It cut all damage in half
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Even though Jung-geun is evaluated as the strongest hard mode player, he must have struggled to overpower Taesan. He wasn't a player who would fall so easily.

It was simply that Taesan was overwhelmingly strong.

Jung-geun couldn't contain his curiosity.

"Seriously, how do you get that crazy skill that multiplies attack power?"

A skill that unconditionally squares attack power.

And it's not based on base attack power but the current attack power.

While Taesan's basic stats may stop at around a million due to being inadequate, depending on the user, it can produce damage close to infinity.

If there's a somewhat similar skill, it's just addition, which is far inferior to multiplication. Even that, apart from Taesan, only Itaeyeon had.

"And what about absolute judgment? Ignore defense? Where is such a skill? Nullify the first attack absolutely? What kind of cheat-like skill is that? Where on earth did you get it from?"

Jung-geun was genuinely curious.

If every easy mode player had skills like Taesan's, Jung-geun would have wanted to kill himself for choosing hard mode.

But only Taesan had such skills.

As always, Taesan responded.

"I worked hard to obtain them."

"You're saying that again. At this point, do you have anything left to hide?"
Here is the English translation of the text:

"That's all there is. What can you do about it?" Taesan said gruffly.

He diligently navigated through the labyrinth, which he called the Tower. It wasn't just passing through; he grasped and analyzed many things. That was everything.

Yet even saying so, people couldn't accept it. To them, the labyrinth was merely a simple hell. They didn't try to understand why one would grasp and analyze such a dreadful world.

As it turned out, Taesan didn't feel the need to explain thoroughly either, feeling no necessity to do so.

From the other side, another cheer rang out.

"Oh. Another player has come? Today seems to be bountiful."

"I don't think so."

Usually, when players arrived, they appeared in the heart of the city. But the cheer came from near the ramparts. Jung-geun also realized.

"Itaeyeon seems to have come."

* * *

In a situation where humanity was said to be on the verge of extinction, there was no one pursuing elegance and safety. Most of the city's houses were on the brink of collapse.

However, among them, there were also tidy houses. They seemed to have been consistently maintained, with not even a speck of dust on the walls.
"I still can't stand this kind of mess."

Taesan was standing in front of the house with an annoyed expression. He entered the house.

Creak.

As the door opened and the interior came into view, Taesan became even more impressed.

"Well, well."

Various decorations and murals could be seen. The house was quite nicely decorated, but in this crazy world, no one cared about decorations. If someone did, they must have been mentally unstable.

With a sigh, Taesan spoke to the woman who was waiting for him in the house.

"Don't you want to fix this strange habit of yours?"

"I don't want to hear your comments about my hobby, alright?"

The woman, sitting on a luxurious red leather chair, grumbled. Proudly, she raised her hand with long black hair.

"Isn't it beautiful? I brought it from the art gallery this time."

At the tip of her finger was a gigantic portrait.

The portrait, four times the size of a human torso, had not a speck of dust or a single scratch.

Amidst the overflowing monsters outside, in a world where one couldn't be sure if they would see tomorrow, bringing back that portrait meant that she cherished it dearly.

Taesan let out a sigh.
"Why is a woman like you the strongest human?"

Lee Taeyeon.

The one and only human who cleared Alone Mode.

She was evaluated as the strongest human on Earth. And by Taesan's standards, she was also the furthest from normal.

Taeyeon smirked.

"In situations like this, obsession with something becomes important. How about you try having a hobby like mine? I used to think things like art had no meaning in the old world, but now I see they each have their own flavor. Take this portrait I brought back this time, for instance..."

"Let's hear about that later when there's time."

Taeyeon had a knack for digressing when she spoke.

Taesan knew from experience that sticking to business without getting sucked in was best.

"What's the matter?"

The reason Taesan came here was because Taeyeon had called for him. Taeyeon gestured towards the armrest of her chair.

"The kid from Hard Mode. I educated him."

"No one else could do it but me."

"Right, a Hard Player to an Easy Player. It's always a weird story whenever I hear it."
Lee Taeyeon looked at Taesan with a face as if she were seeing something fascinating, then spoke.

"Status Window."

Lee Taeyeon's status window appeared.

[Lee Taeyeon] [Level: 258] [Health: 45810/45810] [Mana: 7020/7020] [Strength: 10152] [Intelligence: 9899] [Agility: 13254] [Attack Power + 5421] [Defense + 8456] [The target is in a fearful state.]

Anyone else would be astonished by these stats. Her light attack would rival the full strength of a Hard Player.

Taesan, looking at her status window, had a sullen expression.

"What is this, bragging?"

"It's just a simple check. Taesan. Show me your status window, too."

"So it is bragging. How can an Easy Player survive like this?"

Grumbling, Taesan opened his status window.

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 57] [Health: 1021/1021] [Mana: 820/820] [Strength: 105] [Intelligence: 100] [Agility: 98] [Attack Power + 49] [Defense + 58] [The target is in optimal condition.]

Lee Taeyeon nodded her head.

"As expected, you're pathetically weak."

Taesan frowned.

"Are you picking a fight?"
"You call it a simple check? Still, that level of stats is quite decent. Most Easy Players have much lower stats than you. As for mana management, even among Normal Players, you would probably be in the top tier."

Taesan fundamentally belongs to the easiest difficulty level of players.

And the growth discrepancy based on the dungeon's difficulty was severe.

Once you clear the dungeon, all growth comes to a halt, making it impossible to become stronger.

Hard Players would easily surpass Taesan by at least ten times.

The mid-tier players would be around twenty times stronger.

However, none of them could withstand even a single blow from Taesan.

It was also impossible for Lee Taeyeon to guarantee a victory against Taesan.

It was all because of the skills Taesan possessed.

"Do you have around two hundred skills?"

"About two hundred and thirty, yes."

"...That's truly an astonishing number."

Lee Taeyeon let out a hollow laugh.

She had around fifty skills, while Hard Players had around twenty at most.

Moreover, it wasn't just about quantity; each skill had its own quality.

Lee Taeyeon raised her fist.

"Just stay still."
"Lee Taeyeon activated the skill 'Addition.' Half of her base attack power is added." "Lee Taeyeon activated the skill 'Plus.' Her current attack power doubles." "Lee Taeyeon activated the skill 'Bullseye.' This attack is guaranteed to hit." "Lee Taeyeon's attack."

The damage that can kill Taesan more than ten times over engulfs him.

"The first attack of Gang Taesan is nullified." "0 damage to Gang Taesan."

However, only a brief system window appeared. Taesan remained in a defensive stance.

"What are you doing?"

"...Nothing. It's nothing."

Lee Taeyeon let out a bitter smile.

The ultimate precision skill, Bullseye.

It was one of the skills that fit within the five fingers of her hand, but it was useless against Taesan.

"Absolute nullification of attacks. Absolute determination. Multiplication, multiple layered attacks, duplication, temporary time stop... These skills are just absurd."

Even with just one of these skills, one could become a top-tier expert.

Taesan possessed over two hundred of such skills. That's why he could survive despite having insignificant stats and overpower everyone else.

"You said you obtained these skills by playing the Tower's elements, right?"

"Not the Tower, but the Dungeon. Why would the descending place be a tower?"
"Most people call it that, not just me. So what? You think calling it a labyrinth includes you in the minority? Answer me."

"Yeah. Skills can be obtained regardless of difficulty."

Lee Taeyeon shook her head and pondered deeply.

"We should have understood the Tower properly like you did. Instead of just obsessing over clearing it, we should have pushed our limits to become stronger..."

But they hadn't.

Consumed by fear, they fixated on clearing the labyrinth as quickly as possible and missed out on most elements that could have made them stronger. Lee Taeyeon realized this simple truth belatedly.

"I guess so."

Taesan said heavily.

If others had acted like him, would they have become as strong as he had?

He didn't think so. To him, Lee Taeyeon's words now were akin to saying everyone would invent the light bulb if they lived like Edison.

But not wanting to dwell on meaningless matters, he replied vaguely.

"It's already in the past anyway."

"That's not necessarily true."

Lee Taeyeon smiled knowingly. Taesan looked at her with a puzzled expression, but instead of answering, Lee Taeyeon changed the subject.
"Anyway, you're amazing. If you had played in solo mode, we might have been able to win."

Most of the powerful skills are based on stats. But Taesan couldn't even use one-tenth of those skills right now.

If Taesan had only reached the average stats of a normal hardcore player, humanity could have progressed much further than this.

Taesan impatiently clapped his hands.

"Can we stop talking about that?"

If he had played in normal mode. If he had played in solo mode. He had heard these words over and over again. Now it annoyed him.

"Get to the point. Did you scout?"

"Yes."

Lee Taeyeon said with a serious expression.

"The next wave is about to start."

Taesan frowned.

The wave where monsters launch a full-scale attack. Every time they returned to Earth, a wave occurred. After the last return, humanity lost Seoul in the first wave. Half of the hardcore players died in the second wave. In the third wave, humanity could only defend a small city.

With each wave, many people died, and the territory decreased significantly. Now it was the fourth wave.

"How many are there?"
"S-class, two of them. A-class, dozens. B-class, hundreds. And the Apostles."

Taeyeon said calmly. Taesan nodded his head.

"It's over."

Even Taeyeon barely manages to face S-class monsters. And there are two of them.

On top of that, dozens of A-class monsters. There are currently no hardcore players who can face A-class monsters, not more than twenty.

And the Apostles.

Something beyond S-class, something alien.

In reality, defeat was certain.

"But we have to put up a fight. Taesan, help me face the two S-class monsters."

"What?"

Taesan burst into laughter.

"You want me to die?"

"There's no one else but you who can face S-class. I'm already overwhelmed dealing with the Apostles. You know that, right?"

"You're such a pain."

Taesan complained, but he didn't refuse. He also knew that there was truly no other way now.

He turned his body.

"Shall we go and inform the others?"

"Well, at least they should be mentally prepared. Should we let them die without knowing anything?"

"That might be happier for them."

"I don't think so."
Here's the translation of the text:

---

Even if it means spitting blood and digging into the ground, one must strive to survive. That was Taesan's mindset.

Taesan went outside. Left alone, Taeyeon muttered to herself.

"Taesan, you're strong. You could lead us to victory."

She managed a bitter smile.

"But I'm just a coward."

She held a rough stone in her hand.

---

"Damn."

Jung-geun peered through the barrier with a bewildered expression.

"I knew a day like this would come eventually, but this feels really grimy."

"What about the others?"

"It's a mess. Everyone's saying it's the end. Praying and going wild."

"Well, I guess so."

Everyone's going to die. No one's keeping a clear head about humanity's end.

"And you?"

"I'm hanging in there. Considering everyone's dropping like flies, I've lived longer than expected. That's something, I guess. Something."

"Does it matter if you're dying or not?"

Chang-soo walked past them with a grim, dead look on his face.

"Come to think of it, that's pretty pitiful."

---

Hope this helps!
Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

You'd be excited at the thought of clearing the maze and enjoying the modern era. But instead, you're facing a dreadful reality, barely a day after seeing the world, waiting for death.

If you were a hardcore player, you would have cleared the maze after enduring all sorts of hardships. What an unlucky life.

"How are you feeling, hyung?"

Jung-geun asked Taesan.

"To be honest, hyung, I think you're the most unjustly treated here. If we had done just half of what you did, we wouldn't be facing annihilation."

"It feels unjust enough to die over. Is it over?"

Taesan said indifferently. It was a casual attitude, but it reflected Taesan's true feelings just now.

Grrr...

The monster's cry echoed. Jung-geun's expression hardened.

It was the beginning of the wave.

"Oh damn. This is bad. Seriously. Hyung, what do we have to deal with?"

"Two S-rankers."

"...See you in the afterlife. Looks like you'll go first, hyung. Please wait for me."

"Got it."

Taesan leapt into action. His adversaries weren't a horde of monsters.

Separated from them were just two monsters.

Taesan stomped his foot.

"You have initiated a major leap."

His body soared into the sky. In an instant, he passed over the clouds and swiftly distanced himself from the city.
The fight against the S-ranks is immense, even causing crater-like destruction that makes it impossible to fight near the city. Taesan looked down on the ground from above.

[You have activated complete reconnaissance.]

There are dots on the ground. The blue dots gather in one place and are very few, while the red dots twinkle and fill the ground like a cityscape.

Among them, two shining red dots stood out.

"I've found them."

[You have initiated landing.]

Taesan descended to the ground. The two monsters that were heading towards the city were surprised and stopped when they saw Taesan.

"Nice to meet you?"

Grrrr.

[Monster 5 behaves aggressively towards you.] [Monster 7 behaves aggressively towards you.]

The monsters look at Taesan, and the system window appears in their gaze.

[You confronted terrifying beings.] [Initiating judgment.] [Mental breakdown judgment in progress...] [Confusion judgment in progress...] [Fear judgment in progress...] [Instant death judgment in progress...] [. . .] [Judgment complete!] [You endured with unwavering mental strength!] [All stats have increased.] [Your mind will never crumble.] [An indomitable body is forged.]

Just by looking at them, a judgment of instant death is attempted.
Taesan drew his sword with a sigh. It was an old sword that had been with him all his life.

"Die, you damn things."

[You have activated unstoppable power.]
