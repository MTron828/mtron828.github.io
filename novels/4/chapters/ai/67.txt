68. 11th Floor, Penalty Play (2)

The dwarf grimaces momentarily upon seeing the ghost.

"So this annoying fellow followed us all the way here."

There was no surprise in seeing the ghost. Instead, it calmly spoke as if it had expected this to some extent.

"You knew, didn't you?"

"I knew. So what?"

The reply was indifferent. Instead of showing anger or annoyance, the ghost clicked its tongue and, as always, withdrew without further protest.

The dwarf also did not react strongly, turning his gaze towards Taesan.

"You've finally set foot in a proper labyrinth. Everything up until now wasn't false, but passing the 10th floor puts you among the top hundred."

Pride gleamed in the dwarf's eyes as he looked at Taesan.

"So, from here on, I can show you items that suit your level. Take a look."

The dwarf opened a space and took out equipment.

The shapes, colors, and aura of the equipment were all on a different level compared to anything seen before.
Taesan whistled as he inspected each item one by one. He picked up the Mookbit Chain Armor.

[Unused Mookbit Chain Armor] [Defense +33] [Damage reduction against opponent's weapons -5] [Armor that has never been seen in the world, stored in the craftsman's warehouse. Only the craftsman knows why.]

"Heh."

Taesan couldn't help but chuckle.

"This crazy performance..."

Currently, the armor he had provided Defense 10 and Agility 2.

It was definitely not low-grade equipment. He would wear it until he cleared the leather armor he was currently wearing in Easy Mode.

However, ÙŠ even?p want took let such lot who.  offer need
"I'll... consider these further."

He checked out other equipment, all of which boasted exceptional performance.

[Gauntlets of Verbosity] [Attack +34] [Additional Damage +5] [Gauntlets once wielded by a lesser-known warrior. Blessed by a sorceress who was his fan.] [50,000G] [Boots of Starcall] [Defense +20] [Movement Speed +15%] [Boots infused with the breath of nature. Contains all the energy of a single forest.] [40,000G] [Jang-Chiyang: Helmet] [Defense +30] [Strength +10] [Part of a set jokingly crafted by the Dwarf King. Full set reveals hidden abilities.] [70,000G] [Wilt of Death] [Magic +20] [A tome containing death itself.] [66,000G]

"What in...?"

No matter how he looked at it, the equipment offered astonishing performance matched by their high prices.

"Are there any set items?"

The pieces of Jang-Chiyang.

Not only did each one boast respectable stats, but they also hid additional functionalities. If not for their exorbitant prices, they would have been worth collecting.

That was the problem.

The prices were simply too high.
Currently, Taesan has 15,000 gold. Even if he scours everything, he can't afford the cheapest item.

Continuing to browse, Taesan chuckled to himself when he saw a certain ring.

"What's this now?"

[Purple Ring: Hongyeong] [Strength + 3%] [Intelligence + 3%] [Agility + 3%] [A ring that absorbs sunlight during the time raindrops fall into holes in rocks.] [100,000G]

All stats + 3%. It's an item with percentages. Moreover, it's not armor or a weapon, but a ring that can be worn on ten fingers, each with a 3% ratio.

The price was significantly higher than other equipment, but it held comparable value.

He wanted to buy it.

But he didn't have the money.

The dwarf grinned knowingly, sensing Taesan's feelings.

"You want to buy it?"

"I do want to."

He simply lacked the money. It was like a pie in the sky.

"There is a way to afford it though."

"Oh?"

Taesan looked surprised at the dwarf, who spoke with a mischievous grin.

"Of course, it's not just about buying it. I didn't show it from the 10th floor for nothing. There are ways."

"What ways?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"It was something Taesan hadn't heard from Itaeyeon. The dwarf spoke with a grin.

"You could see it as a kind of challenge. Every time you accomplish something, the value will decrease accordingly."

"What kind of challenge?"

"It's simple."

The dwarf pointed his finger towards the entrance.

"It's a kind of penalty play."

The dwarf began to explain. Taesan listened with a serious expression. After the explanation was over, Taesan stroked his chin.

"So, it's sacrificing stats."

"I like it when you adventurers take on challenges. The harder the challenge, the better. You risk your lives, but you'll become stronger because of it."

It wasn't wrong. After battles where their lives were at stake, they indeed became stronger. The only problem was losing their lives in those challenges.

"But you don't worry about that, do you?"

The dwarf chuckled and said. Taesan shrugged at the words filled with trust.

"I might not."

"Then maybe I misjudged you."

The dwarf laughed heartily. His face was more cheerful than usual.

Penalty play.

To summarize the dwarf's words was simple.
Here is the translation of the text:

"When you open the stat window, you see various numbers.

If we only organize the numbers that directly impact combat, there are seven: health, mana, strength, intelligence, agility, attack power, and defense."

The dwarf told him to choose a stat that could be made into a basic stat among those.
Here is the translation of the text:

"However, Taesan looked at the dwarf with a perplexed expression. The dwarf was still grinning broadly.

Taesan realized something. The dwarf was under a misconception.

"I'll offer it."

The dwarf's grin deepened even more.

"What will you offer?"

"Can I offer my shield as well?"

"That? Since it's also a stat, it can be done."

"I'll offer my shield, health, mana, intelligence, and defense."

The dwarf, who had been grinning broadly, hesitated.

"...Five things?"

"Yes."

"Oh, I'm fine with that, really?"

"Yes. Please proceed."

As Taesan urged him, the dwarf reluctantly reached out his hand. Some immense power settled there.

[Transaction completed. Your shield, health, mana, intelligence, and defense become base stats.]

A sense of relief washed over Taesan in that moment. When he checked his stats, he indeed saw some disappointing figures.

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 24] [Shield: 1/1] [Health: 100/100] [Mana: 10/10] [Strength: 406] [Intelligence: 10] [Agility: 332] [Attack Power +45] [Defense +0] [The subject is in peak condition.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"When you clear a floor, your stats return to their original state. Don't worry, as your stats will increase normally while you climb."

"Got it."

It was incredibly bleak. Even facing just two opponents could be dangerous.

But Taesan headed into the labyrinth with a cheerful expression.

"I'll go ahead."

"...Wait. Come to think of it, his stats..."

The dwarf realized belatedly, mumbling to himself, but Taesan had already broken through the door.

"Amazing."

He broke through the room with a joyful face. Before long, he encountered enemies on the 11th floor.

[A Skeleton Warrior appeared.]

With a clattering sound, a fleshless monster appeared.

From the 11th to the 20th floor, the dead appear. It was a monster befitting that description.

Clang.

The skeleton swung a rusty sword at Taesan. It was a decent swordsmanship.

"They're definitely strong."

Upon entering the 11th floor, he became much stronger compared to the rate of increase he had experienced so far.

It seemed funny to say that a creature with nothing but bones was stronger and faster than an ogre, but it was actually true, making it ambiguous to say anything.

But that's exactly it. He became stronger.

Taesan put strength into his sword.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The skeleton's sword broke, shattering its bones."

"[80 damage dealt to Skeleton Warrior.]"

"The attack included critical hits. It was convenient that it shattered at the moment of the critical hit, with only bones."

He swung one more time and knocked it down.

"[Obtained Bone Fragment.] [Obtained 453G.]"

"That was easy."

"Of course."

Even if you change your health and defense to basic stats, it doesn't matter. It wasn't meant to fit in the first place.

Even if you restore mana to its basic form, it doesn't matter. There's no problem even if you don't use skills.

Because his stats were overwhelmingly superior, penalties didn't matter at all.

Taesan defeated skeletons as he progressed through the labyrinth. During that time, he had a premonition of insight and quickly found a secret room, receiving a reward.

"[Bracelet of Acceptance] [Defense +5] [1% chance to counterattack against opponent's attack.]"

In addition to the defense of 5, the bracelet also had a special effect. It was not a bad piece of equipment. Since you can wear two bracelets, there was no reason to remove the item.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Afterward, I looked around for this and that, but since the 11th floor was a new theme, whether it was deliberate to adapt slowly or just a coincidence, there wasn't anything particularly special. So I proceeded directly to the boss room.

[Skeleton Knight appeared.]

It was a knight, not a warrior. Therefore, it was faster and stronger.

However, it was exactly at the boss level of the 11th floor. I dealt with it without any issues and received my reward.

[Ring of the Lion] [Damage against the undead +3] [Ring of the one who led the dead.]

Damage increased by 5. It wasn't bad. With this, I equipped rings on all ten fingers.

And a secret reward.

[You used ???] [Obtained Anklet Guard made from dying leaves and imbued with magic potion.] [Anklet Guard made from dying leaves and imbued with magic potion] [Defense +12] [Agility +7] [Anklet guard that a magic merchant tried to sell, but didn't sell because it was too expensive.]

It's a good item. It's an anklet guard with high defense and also high agility stats attached. The secret reward was worth it.

With the 11th floor, overall rewards have also been enhanced.

Although the items that monsters dropped were not quite up to the level to use, they were clearly better than the items obtained so far.

It was a satisfying achievement."
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"My level also increased to 2, and my stats rose considerably due to various skills.

Taesan descended to the 11th floor.

[Start of 12th floor quest.] [Defeat the boss of the 12th floor and proceed.] [Reward: Necromancer's Staff.] [Secret reward: ???]

It didn't even take an hour to clear a floor. Upon descending to the 12th floor, Taesan encountered a dwarf. The dwarf's face contorted in disgust.

"It's 5 pieces, so it's 50%. Right?"

"...Yeah. Damn it."

The dwarf stared coldly at Taesan. It was a similar look to when he realized Taesan had a protective shield. Shortly after, he burst into laughter.

"Why are you so cocky? I knew you were strong, but I never imagined this."

"Have you seen enough now?"

"Yeah. You damn brat. Did you really get this for free?"

He continued grumbling, but Taesan was delighted. Getting a 50% discount almost for free was a rare opportunity.

"Crafty fellow."

While he enjoyed himself, the dwarf couldn't help but be impressed. He maintained a casual demeanor outwardly but was quite astonished inwardly.
Here's the translation into English:

"In his experience, Taesan's stats were stats that couldn't be achieved at the current point in time.

'Is this possible?'"
