Chapter 149

149. Outside. The Battlefield of Gods (5)

"Ah, ahah?"

The Saint was shocked.

He, after all, was a mage of fame.

He now realized that what Tai Shan had done was indeed a magic.

And he also felt that Tai Shan's power was so immense that it was beyond his reach.

"'It's good to write outside.'"

Tai Shan muttered to himself and waved his hand.

[You have activated the Blaze Formation.]

A blazing aura surrounds Tai Shan.

With a flick of his hand, the Blaze Formation shoots towards the gods of mysticism. The Saint is startled and rises to his feet.

"Barrier!"

A translucent barrier of mysterious energy is formed. The late-arriving gods of mysticism add their strength to the barrier.

Kaah!

The barrier is shattered by the Blaze Formation.

The scattered sparks of flames cover them. Those directly hit cannot even let out a scream and disappear, while those who were struck by the flames also cannot last long.

"What's this?! What's this?!"

This flame is not even a minute old, and it's already broken through his barrier. The Saint widened his eyes, and Tai Shan looked puzzled.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Why are you so weak?"

Even if you're not favored by the gods, you're still a transcendent being who has surpassed mortals. Although you have incomparable strength, like Mount Tai, your magical power is too low.

[Gods can't easily give up their power. They must receive compensation, just like in the labyrinth.]

"Then, can't I just offer sacrifices?"

[Think about the level of sacrifices you've made, and the answer will become clear.]

"Ah."

Mount Tai nodded his head with a smile, having cast the magic spell.

From just looking at the equipment explanations in the labyrinth, it's clear that the equipment on the 10th floor is extremely valuable outside.

To learn magic, I had to offer a few of those valuable items.

Even if I consider it in terms of its value outside, it's acceptable to offer a treasure-worthy artifact.

"It's definitely going to be tough outside."

As Mount Tai muttered to himself, the magic continued to manifest.

And he couldn't even block one of them, let alone all of them.

[You have detonated a wind explosion.]

In the labyrinth, magic is almost useless, only used to block arrows and the like. Wind explosion.

"Aaaa!"

Note: The story seems to be a fantasy adventure, with a protagonist who is trying to learn magic and overcome challenges in a labyrinth. The text is a conversation between the protagonist and Mount Tai, a powerful being who is teaching the protagonist about magic.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Profit!"

That's like a storm to them. They can't resist and are blown away, stuck to the wall, and lost in the forest.

The Great Mountain continuously manifests its magic.

The light and easy-to-implement magic turned out to be a calamity itself.

"Ugh... ...".

"Aaaaah..."

And everyone falls down.

The Great Mountain activates the Frost Arrow.

Boom.

The mysterious stone statue of the gods is shattered.

[You have destroyed the mysterious stone statue that emerged from the bottom. The mysterious god who emerged from the bottom has been chased away from the battlefield of the gods. The gods of the labyrinth are delighted. The god of magic is extremely pleased and is very satisfied with your actions.]

A massive energy disappears into a rift in the sky, taking the souls of the gods with it.

The Great Mountain immediately moves on to the next one.

The next god is the god who moves the twisted cliff.

As his name suggests, he was a god who was revered for his strength, and his followers were also close to him.

"Aaaaah!"

A group of men, each bigger than the Great Mountain, rush towards the Great Mountain.

They come together to push the Great Mountain back, starting to do so.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Feel our strength!"

A particularly large man, with a loud voice, shouted out.

"We are the ones who can push mountains!"

"There must be a strength worthy of such words."

Their pressure was quite heavy. With a strength like this, we could really push a mountain.

It would be a very small mountain, at most.

But Tai-san has the strength to actually move a mountain.

Tai-san took a deep breath, gave himself a mighty roar, and stomped his foot on the ground.

Crack!

With just that movement, the ground began to crack and split.

He gave himself a boost, pushed with his shoulders, and pushed forward.

"Ahh, ahh!"

The bullets shot out of the cannons like rockets.

The eyes of the unusually large man widened in surprise.

"What's going on?"

The stats of the labyrinth directly affected his physical body.

When his agility increased, his physical speed surpassed the speed of sound.

When his strength increased, his physical strength became incredibly powerful, exceeding imagination.

And Tai-san had the strength to crush a tidal wave and lift a mountain.

"So Tai-san had to fight from a different place."

Note: Tai-san is likely a character with extraordinary physical strength, and the story is describing his abilities and feats.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The level of hard mode is such that you can minimize damage by focusing your strength, but even then, it's impossible to reach the level of Ita-yeon.

Only light battles are needed to destroy the city, so she had to fight from a distance like a mountain, unable to fight in the city.

A thought occurred to me naturally.

'Is it strange?'

Ita-yeon cannot fight in the city due to the aftermath of the battle. Therefore, she must have fought outside like a mountain.

However, when he returned to the city after defeating two S-grade opponents in his previous life, Ita-yeon was already there.

'Is he coming back after fighting?'

After winning the battle, he returned to the city and continued to appear, but he was killed before he could use the Uroburos' stone and resist the saint.

This assumption is the most plausible, but it's still unclear.

While having a vague thought, the men were struggling to push away the mountain, but the mountain's feet remained still as if rooted.

"'Let's finish it soon.'"

The mountain used its strength to swing its arm.

The big rocks flew away.

Kwa-jik.

The mountain broke the statue."

Note: The original text is in Korean, and the translation may not be perfect, but I did my best to convey the meaning accurately.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The god of power is extremely delighted. He is completely satisfied with your actions."

"Is there a god of power?"

It seemed to be a god sitting in a place where the Great Mountain had not yet arrived.

The Great Mountain looked up at the crack in the sky.

The godly aura and the souls of the gods were drawn into that place.

"I said there were twelve gods here."

The green one had said that to him. When he thought about the gods he met in the labyrinth, he was sure that there were many more than that.

"That's fine too."

The more gods there are, the more certain the reward will be.

The god that the Great Mountain had just obtained was the fifth.

Now, there were only five left.

*

"I'm dissatisfied."

The Great Mountain shook his arm. He had just chased away the god of light who was walking on the outside path.

He had chased away six gods in total.

He had processed more than half of them, and even the god of light was satisfied, but the Great Mountain was not.

"It's too weak."

There was nothing to do.

The gods on the opposite side were not at a level that could activate the ascension to the next dimension.

"It's nothing but a waste of time, isn't it?" he said with a sigh.
Here is the translation of the text:

If the difference in strength had been that great, I would have been crushed by the higher-ranked gods before even having a chance to fight.

The ghost smiled wryly.

[But I'm not that weak, actually.]

From the ghost's perspective, those weak ones were not weak at all.

The gods I first encountered here were indeed weak, but from the middle on, there were some quite strong ones. Even compared to the labyrinth, they weren't that far off.

As individuals, they may not have been strong, but if there were a sufficient number of them, they would have reached a level equivalent to the 20th or 30th floor of an average labyrinth.

[You're just too strong. I guess even the gods here didn't expect this.]

The gods outside the labyrinth, who didn't know much about it, would have used levels as a standard.

Usually, strength is proportional to level, so that's not entirely wrong.

The only thing was that I was an exception.

I had strength that didn't match my level, and I also had a special skill called "ascension" that allowed me to rise above my level.

[It's going to be confusing. So... I guess it's time to start moving.]

The ghost whispered softly.

A day passed.

The next day, Taesan killed two more gods.

Although the number was smaller than the day before, there was a reason for it.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's happened to these people? They've suddenly become stronger."

It wasn't about their abilities or skills improving. The gods' power was felt more intensely by the saints.

"Did the gods grant them power?"

[Maybe so. Originally, according to the laws of the battlefield, blessings of that level couldn't be granted, but it seems like they made a deal to kill each other.]

Tai Shan smiled.

"It's useless even if they do."

No matter how much divine power they had, it was impossible to stop Tai Shan with hastily acquired power. It wasn't like they suddenly became at the level of a saint, so it was just a matter of time. The result would be the same.

I processed eight of them like that.

Only two gods were left.

Before processing the rest, Tai Shan decided to eat first. He grilled the meat brought from the labyrinth and put it in his mouth.

The taste wasn't very good, but it was enough to fill his stomach.

Tai Shan slowly ate his meal, then suddenly stopped.

He turned his gaze.

There was a golden light nearby.

[Well, it's not bad.]

"It's later than I thought."

Both the ghost and Tai Shan waited calmly.
Here is the translation of the text:

As if a willow branch had split itself off, a being emerged with a natural reverence and a body bent in reverence. It was as if a being that had been adorned with gold had appeared.

Everything was a being adorned with gold, showing its appearance.

[You.]

A emotionless gaze was directed towards Mount Tai.

[You are a god adorned with gold. You have met the mantra.]

* * *

Mount Tai examined the mantra.

At first glance, it seemed to be similar to a human in appearance, with the exception of being hairless. It was a typical handsome man, but every part of its body was made of gold.

Even the tips of its fingers, its eyes, and its lips were all gold.

It was as if I was looking at a massive, golden fortress.

[A mortal is judging a god, isn't he.]

The mantra narrowed its eyes. With just that action, the surrounding plants began to wither and the earth began to wither away.

[Judgment in progress......] [Fear in progress......] [Confusion in progress......]

At the same time, I remembered the dozens of judgments I had made when I met Maria before.

"Dismiss."

Mount Tai shook its head.

The notification window that announced success in all judgments appeared.

Even Maria's judgment had been overcome, but the judgment of the external god, which was lower in grade, was nothing compared to that.

Note: The text appears to be a fantasy story with a mystical tone, and the translation is provided as accurately as possible.
Here is the translation of the text:

"'It's not true, I swear.'"

Taesan knew it. The existence right in front of him was not the true God. It seemed like a kind of avatar.

It was strong, but that was all.

When I saw the gods of the underworld, I didn't feel a sense of awe at something enormous.

'Is it because of the difference in rank?'

The rank of the gods outside was lower than that of the underworld. Therefore, Taesan might not have felt a different emotion.

The eyes of the mantra that was looking at Taesan trembled.

'[Why are you, someone like that, in such a rank...?]

"What?"

'[No, it's incomplete. I won't bother with it.]'

The trembling eyes of the mantra subsided.

'[Mortal. Become my servant.]'

The mantra spoke. It was as if it were a divine decree.

'[Although it originated from a lowly thing, it has a power that is usable. Become my servant and offer your soul to me.]'

"'I didn't think I would receive that.'"

'[Then, there is only death.]'

The calm gaze of the mantra is directed at Taesan.

A sharp sword pierced through Taesan's entire body.
Here is the translation of the text:

The tip of my finger doesn't move and I can feel the sensation of death all the way to the back of my head.

[Judgment in progress......] [Judgment failure! Death has engulfed you.]

Mantura speaks calmly.

[Die. Mortal.]

Death envelops the mountain.

The mountain gazes indifferently.

The opposite side is divine.

I knew it was impossible to resist the existence.

However, I also knew that I would never die absolutely.

[That's it.]

Interference occurs.

The absolute death towards the mountain is erased.

The space splits and a massive existence appears in the artificial world.

[The judgment has been lifted.]

The death that was engulfing me disappears. The mountain shakes off its coat.

"It's later than I thought."

[I was waiting for the dramatic timing.]

Mantura shows signs of confusion for the first time.

[You!] [It's a shame for the divine being to directly touch the mortal. Mantura.]

Rakiratas, who appeared on the battlefield, giggled.
