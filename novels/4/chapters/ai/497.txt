498. Level 92. Faith (9)

Kuwoouung!

Gray and gold collide.

And in an instant, the gold fades to gray. The world becomes monochrome. Lemidios gathers his strength amidst this.

Kuwoouung!

Power clashes, and Lemidios, who had never once retreated from his position, is pushed back. His face is filled with humiliation.

[Don't you dare laugh!]

Kiying!

Lemidios extends his hand. The compressed sacredness radiates a bright white light.

Guchuguguk.

[I have been at the level you've reached now for eons! Do you think you can reach me now!]

"Yeah."

Taesan, who was also an Overhuman, was certainly the lowest of them all.

However, Lemidios was undoubtedly the highest among the Faith-Gods. While the fight was evenly matched, there was still a clear difference in level. It was this difference that allowed Lemidios to pressure Taesan.

But not anymore.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Although it hadn't been long since they reached the same level, Taesan was already a perfect transcender. Their powers were equal.

And since they were equal, Taesan had no reason to back down now.

With a thick, dark aura enveloping his entire body, he charged forward. Remidaos unleashed his anger and wielded his divine power.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

Their powers clashed.

The white divine power was tainted. Although it struggled and resisted, it was no match for Taesan, like a deer caught in a hunter's snare. In an instant, it was pierced through.

[Ugh!]

Remidaos was ultimately forced to create some distance. He wildly swung his divine power and fled, making it easy for Taesan to chase after him.

But in the end, that was all he could do. Remidaos resisted and struggled, but he couldn't have a significant impact on Taesan.

Ki-ying!

Hundreds of white spears shot through the air. Taesan, seeing the spears, reached out his hand into the air.

[You have activated the Destroyer.]

Soul skill. Destroyer. The immortal's authority stolen from the High Priest's apostle.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I couldn't handle it until now. My skills were insufficient, and the power of the Immortal was not something that could be easily controlled.

But now, I can control it.

The high-level skills that were lacking are supplemented and forcibly raised.

Kwaduk.

Space and the world are being destroyed.

The white sacred energy spreads rapidly, like a spider's web, and shatters like glass, unable to withstand the power. Remidaos was shocked.

[How! The power of the Immortal, which is my sacred energy!]

"It's me who can handle that."

I answer lightly and attack again. Remidaos resists desperately, but ultimately allows a single blow.

Kiiiiing!

The sacred energy is rapidly depleted. Remidaos desperately tries to distance himself, but the sacred energy is consumed in an instant.

[Ugh. Ugh.]

Remidaos catches his breath. On his face, which is now exposed without his sacred energy, there is a sense of desperation and fear.

Remidaos, who had been feared by all, was ironically afraid of Taesan.

The fear that people had towards him was no longer visible. Only his faith towards Taesan was evident.

[…….]

Remidaos thought desperately. How could he overcome this crisis?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He had also transcended numerous trials and limitations in the process of becoming a transcendent being. This time, he believed it would be no different and quickly grasped the judgment and possibility.

But soon, Remidao realized.

The answer was not visible.

There was no possibility. Remidao's face was filled with despair as he realized this.

[This can't be!]

He denied his own intuition and judgment, which had never betrayed him before.

[I won't give up! I will become a great being! I won't fall here!]

Kiiiiing!

Divinity gathered.

The condensed divinity exceeded its limits, distorting its shape and color. The repercussions of handling it exceeded Remidao's physical limits, twisting his body.

Pure power. Even if he survived, Remidao's divinity would reach its limits. He had a strong will to sacrifice everything to kill Taesan.

[Die.]

His voice was filled with life and desperation. The distorted divinity enveloped Taesan.

Seeing the distorted divinity, Taesan raised his hand.

Above it, a formless energy gathered.

Taesan threw the formless energy at the divinity, which was as large as a fist. The universe-enveloping divinity collided with the formless energy.

And the formless energy rose up.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The immense power that resonated with the aura of nothingness began to inflate its body. It devoured the faith with an insatiable hunger, turning it into something worthless.

[Oh, oh.]

Remidao's last bit of strength began to lose all meaning.

Muga-cheon instantly devoured all the divine power. Taesan grasped his fist and reclaimed Muga-cheon.

Taesan leaped forward. Remidao's mind was half-lost, unable to respond, and it was already the end.

Thud.

[Ugh!]

Taesan's sword pierced Remidao's chest, taking in the last remaining divine power.

[This, this can't be! I! I! I'm supposed to be the great one!]

Remidao resisted fiercely, using up his remaining strength to push Taesan away.

But even that was taken away by Taesan.

Everything Remidao had built up until now became Taesan's possession. Remidao's face contorted in despair.

He was dying. The sense of desperation overwhelmed him. He desperately cried out into the void.

[Please! Please! Save me!]

Remidao wailed towards someone.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And a huge gaze is felt. Remidao's face brightened for a moment, but soon turned to despair.

The only thing felt from the gaze was joy and anticipation.

[You...].

The words couldn't continue.

Ash-colored darkness completely engulfed Remidao.

[Your divine power has increased. Your proficiency in divinity has risen by 14%.] [Your divine power has increased. You have stolen the soul skill [Divinity].] [You have killed a god. You have obtained the special passive skill [God Slayer].]

The lofty, some of Remidao's accumulated divinity was transferred to Taesan. Even though it was only a part, it far surpassed the divinity Taesan had accumulated so far.

Taesan let out a sigh.

"No matter how I think about it, it doesn't make sense."

Someone had stolen everything others had built up with their lives. The divine power increase was truly a warped skill.

Taesan turned his gaze away. As Remidao fell, the gaze and voice he had spread to the people were cut off. So, people knew. Remidao was dead.

There was no longer an existence that tormented them.

Faith was directed towards Taesan. A strong and numerous, unshakeable faith that would never disappear again.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And Bardley and Akasha. Both of them are also changing. Remidao is a being of this world, unlike God, and absorbs power as he pleases.

[Hmm...].

The energy I sense from Bardley is rapidly increasing. Akasha is the same.

But Akasha showed an even greater change.

Remidao is a divine monster.

Therefore, the energy Akasha absorbed was mostly divine. The immense power of God is swirling inside Akasha.

[Ah.]

Akasha is trembling.

As if he had realized something. His voice is filled with emotion, as if he had remembered something he had forgotten.

I wanted to understand the change that had occurred, but there was a more pressing issue to resolve first. Taesan gazed into the void.

There, he sensed a massive gaze.

What he felt inside was a deep sense of satisfaction and joy.

"It hasn't changed."

[You're still rude.]

"It's not the time to be polite now, is it?"

Taesan spoke calmly. The person beyond laughed quietly.

The space splits open.

Something with a distorted form appears in the world."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

At the same time, people who were praying towards Taesan trembled with fear. The opponent did nothing. Even though they had just appeared, they suddenly sensed death from a distance.

[You have encountered the God of Fall. Essence.]

The God of Fall. Essence.

A god who has the worst relationship with Taesan.

Something that can be estimated by fingers points towards Taesan.

The power envelops Taesan.

A power that can bring down the unknown existence of Taesan and drop it into the abyss.

Taesan, who had wrapped chaos around its entire body, tries to push back the power and exclude it. 

Kwaaaang!

The collision occurs.

The chaos is neutralized by the power. A massive shockwave distorts space and time.

Taesan is pushed back and regains its composure. It re-wraps the chaos and prepares for the next attack.

[It's not a problem at this level.]

The God of Fall mutters.

[As I declared earlier, I want to kill you right now, but... due to the interference of that damn thing, I can't intervene any further.]

At that moment, space splits apart.

A massive power envelops Taesan, nullifying all of Essence's interference and pulling it into its own domain.

[We'll meet again soon.]

Note: Taesan seems to be a proper noun, possibly a name of a person or a place. I've kept it as is in the translation.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The world had changed with a voice full of joy.

The mountain, which was dyed with rainbow colors, was a distorted space.

The mountain had been here several times before.

He turned his gaze. The wizard was smiling brightly, looking at the mountain.

"Did you come?"

* * *

"I was watching."

"I didn't see everything, but I watched until the end."

The wizard applauded.

"You did well. You perfectly defeated the god of faith, who had been revered for a long time, and cleared the 92nd floor quest. The rest is just a matter of getting confirmation from the shop owner."

The quest was cleared.

The mountain opened its mouth.

"The transcendent being behind Remidao was the god of downfall."

"You suspected it too, didn't you?"

The mountain nodded silently.

The transcendent being who knew about the mountain. And the one who had unpleasant feelings towards him.

The boundary was known, but the transcendent being who didn't know about the chaos call was determined.

The god of downfall. Or maybe the god of death. But it didn't seem like the god of death would use such a method. Then, it was only the god of downfall.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Do you think that's the way he likes it?"

"I think so when I think about it."

The immortals must have expected something in return from Remidaos.

Perhaps they themselves wanted to receive faith and become transcendent beings.

But Remidaos saw them as mere tools, nothing more. Even if they weren't trash, he thought he would discard them someday.

And Remidaos wouldn't be any different. He tried to reach transcendence through fear, but it's unclear if that's truly possible.

Even if it were possible, there's a high chance that the essence would directly intervene and cast him down. What he desired was a fall, after all.

"This time, I'm blocking it, so I couldn't interfere with you... but next time, who knows?"

The god of fall was aiming for him.

It wasn't a joke or simple curiosity. He had a clear enemy and a will to kill him.

But Taesan said calmly,

"It doesn't matter."

It's a wall he'll have to face eventually anyway. And he had no intention of losing.

The magician smiled satisfactorily at his attitude.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is the one who named Balbam a god? It's not a bad name. Remidao stopped in his tracks as a god.

He didn't just sit around without trying other methods. He tried every possible way, really everything. But they all failed.

The last method was to change faith into fear.

The distance between the god of faith and the concept of god was immense.

A green witch flashed through Taesan's mind.

"But... you're different. You won't stop at that level like him."

Taesan's wall is not the god of faith.

It's above that.

No one knew where that place was.

"Anyway, you did well. It seems like you've gained a lot. Not just yourself, but others too."

The magician's gaze turned to Akasha.

"The hero's transformation is also visible... especially since you caught my attention. Was it Akasha?"

There was a strange light in that gaze.

"The unknown energy I felt from you suddenly drew close. It's like a lost sense has returned."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Not even the wizard who created the labyrinth, nor any transcendent being he met, knew about Akasha. It was as if it had been erased from their cognition.

But now, the wizard seemed to have an understanding of Akasha's energy.

The wizard narrowed his eyes.

'You. What have you realized?'"
