349. 74th Floor, Battlefield of the Immortals (2)

"The land where immortals fought and died?"

[That's right.]

Taesan frowned.

"I haven't heard of this in the clearance report."

Immortals. Beings that surpass mortality.

Though Taesan was evaluated to stand at the boundary of mortality, he had not yet reached them.

[Calm down. That's just a story of the past. Now it's just land where everyone has died.]

Balbambaba spoke slowly.

[A long time ago, some immortals gathered and started a war. They chose a world called Valhuni as their battlefield and tried to kill each other there.]

"Even immortals wage war among themselves."

[They reached the limits of their realms, making them even more restless. Personal greed and emotions are not much different from mortals.]

Balbambaba concluded.
At first, the war began for trivial reasons, but as it dragged on, emotions intensified. They even drew in other immortals to actively seek to kill each other. Dozens of immortals fought and opposed each other. You can probably guess how it ended.

"Are they all dead?"

"That's right. Every single one of the dozens of immortals fell. It became a land of death where no one could approach."

"What do you want me to do in such a place?"

"Your task is simple. While the immortals are dead, their remains remain. Those remains are the objective of the 74th floor quest."

Taesan looked puzzled at Vahbalumba's words.

"That seems impossible."

Even though they had died long ago, the remains of the immortals themselves likely held immense power. Taesan, still mortal, didn't think he could interfere.

"There's no need to bring back the remains. Just find out where they are."

Vahbalumba handed Taesan some black flags.

"When you find the remains, plant these flags in the ground. That's all you have to do."

Entering the world of Haluni, Taesan searches for the remains of the immortals and plants the flags. That's the entirety of the quest. At first glance, it seemed incredibly easy.
However, Taesan could tell. This quest was exactly why the guides were stuck here.

"The previous riff-raff took a long time to consolidate their strength, frustrating and exhausting us."

Bababamba's grumbling proved Taesan's thoughts correct. Bababamba glanced at a flickering ghost.

"Thinking about it, you saw it just right. At least you're much better than those riff-raff." "It's disappointing compared to those who were blocked."

The ghost replied. Bababamba spoke up.

"For your information, there is no predetermined reward for this quest. The more relics you find, the greater the reward. No one has found more than two relics so far, but maybe you could."

Holding the flag, Taesan remained silent. Bababamba then spoke to Taesan.

"You can explain it, right? This quest is directly commissioned by the gods."

"As expected."

Find the relics and record their locations.

It was a quest that seemed to protect the relics of immortals.
Here's the translation of the text:

"The gods originally had no intention to interfere with Valhalla. They planned to leave it be. However, they began to take interest in the abandoned powers beyond.

The only beings banished from this world are the old gods.

"That place is in an extremely unstable state due to clashes between immortals, where space itself is distorted. If beings of transcendent level attempt reckless intervention, it could collapse, creating an opportunity for the old gods to interfere."

Therefore, send adventurers capable of withstanding the powers spread throughout Valhalla to investigate the dangerous location. That seemed to be the reason for the design of the 74th floor.

"Quests of this nature will increase gradually. It's safe to say this is the starting point. Is there anything else you're curious about?"

"How many remains of immortals are still left?"

"If all remains of immortals are left after a normal fight... it should be about five now."

"Five. Taesan nodded.

"Just wait a little longer."

He used skills like Apostleization during his spar with Ariel. He had to wait for the cooldown of those skills.

After a day, Taesan said to Valvampar.

Valvampar manifested power. Space began to collapse and transition.
Sure, here is the translation of the text you provided:

[By the way, just so you know, you can return to this quest at any time. Those who have cleared it before have repeated countless challenges and returns, so act as you wish.]

Taesan nodded.

His body shifted to Balhurin.

Taesan looked around.

All that was visible was the ashen force.

No living, breathing life could be felt, only overwhelming power drifting through the air.

And there was a blue barrier that seemed to spread out before Taesan.

[You can leave the barrier. Then I will wait for the clear.]

With that, Balbambaga's presence disappeared.

Taesan stepped his foot beyond the barrier.

At the same time, power began to crush Taesan.

"Hmm."

Taesan groaned.

The contorted space tried to collapse his entire body. Fragments of immortals dissolved in the air trample on mortal spirits.

Just standing here alone covered his body with a sensation that made it feel like it
Here is the translation of the text:

The world of Harfran itself was hostile, trying to kill the will of the world itself.

But the power scattered in Valhuluni was not trying to exclude the world.

It was just here.

Just that, however, exerted tremendous pressure on the mortal spirit and body.

Valhuluni gathered strength and will and endured.

Valhuluni moved slowly.

* * *

Valhuluni moved.

A place where countless immortals clashed to kill each other.

As a result, this place became a space similar to the realm of immortals.

Valhuluni gathered magic. He opened a passage toward the demon and activated black magic.

"You have activated the detection of Leraeji's domain."

Kiiing.

Magic leapt out of Valhuluni's body, trying to rush to inform Valhuluni of information from all directions.

But it couldn't come out.

The moment it tried to leave Valhuluni's body, it was annihilated by the grid spread throughout space.

"I can't even properly use black magic."

There was already a much stronger force pervading the entire space than black magic. It was impossible for magic or anything else to spread out.
Magic would be no different. Taesan gritted his teeth and gathered his determination and will.

What spread throughout the space was the domain of the immortal.

But there was no owner of that power.

So.

"Step back."

[You triggered the Declaration of Exclusion.]

With the command, the force that had invaded the space retreated slightly. Without missing the opportunity, Taesan gathered magic once again.

[You triggered Detection of Lera's Domain.] [You triggered Forced Amplification.]

Only then could magic be emitted according to Taesan's will, but it wasn't significantly different. Taesan could only advance to where the Declaration of Exclusion had pushed away, beyond which it would be trampled and disappear.

"This won't work."

71st floor. He couldn't properly use domain detection even in the Shadow's domain.

But even so, he could obtain information that the shadows had devoured. Thus, by gathering the shadows and spreading detection to a level they couldn't devour, he could strategize.

This time was different. It was impossible to decipher without clearing away the entirety of the power contained in the space.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"The invocation that exerts absolute effects on ownerless powers also had little effect, perhaps due to a pure difference in magnitude.

Even advancing required staking one's life. The power of detection did not work, and it was impossible to exploit vulnerabilities like on the 71st floor.

'Was there a reason it had been blocked for so long?'

Despite combining their powers, the guides of sin stayed here for decades, even centuries.

In such a layer, it wasn't strange. They would have cleared it little by little, repeating challenges and giving up, to extract information.

Taesan asked the ghost,

'How long did it take you?'

[Me? It took... about three years, right? It ended quickly.]

Considering he didn't receive anyone's help, the ghost's speed was clearly outstanding.

'I should change my method.'

Taesan thought.

Power spread without an owner.

The realm of immortals.

And in the remains of immortals, there is powerful force.

Can Taesan decipher that power?

It's worth trying.

[You have activated the avatar of nature.] [You have activated the vessel of the king.]

Both intensity and force rise.

Taesan even gathered the might contained in the ring around himself.

And observes."
Here is the translation of the text:

It was not about spreading power.

It was about identifying the harmful entity's location that was exerting force in reverse, reading the power of suppressing oneself.

If it were just a mere mortal, it would be impossible, but Tae-san now straddled between mortal and immortal. It was entirely feasible.

With eyes closed, he sensed the pressure exerted from all directions.

As a result, he understood that it wasn't just a mere spatial diffusion from the left, but something directly applying force.

He found it.

Tae-san opened his eyes and began to move forward.

The further he progressed, the stronger the pressure of power became. At intervals, the space twisted, even sucking in everything approaching.

By strength and resilience, Tae-san barely reached the remains of the immortal's entity.

It was a decayed, exposed human-shaped corpse.

Even without getting close, the lingering malice tried to penetrate Tae-san's interior, and the erratic force of the distorted immortal thrashed wildly.

Deciding it was too dangerous to approach further, Tae-san drew out a flag.
As the flag pierced the ground, simultaneously, a massive tent formed around the flagpole.

[Quest completed.]

The ghost chuckled dryly.

[Took less than an hour.]

For three years, the quest had been an immeasurable journey through wicked paths. Yet, it was finished in just one hour.

But simultaneously, they understood.

The guides of wickedness invested countless hours conquering the 74th floor.

Through that process, they grew stronger. Vishnu gained access to the king's realm, and Shaian succeeded in using limited versions of the five riots.

As a result, they succeeded in clearing the 74th floor.

And now, the current Taesan was stronger than the wicked guides who had become so strong.

It was natural for Taesan, who had originally reached the boundary, to easily clear the 74th floor.

"Hmm."

The quest was cleared.

But Taesan did not return to the maze.

With a firm voice, he said there are five remains of immortals here.

Taesan had only found one so far.

And now, he was confident he could find the remaining five.
However, there was a problem.

"The duration is too short."

The duration of Sadohwa is two hours. The incarnation of nature lasts one hour, and even the king's vessel isn't much longer.

Without these three skills, Taesan couldn't withstand the pressure here.

To find the remaining harmful things, a different approach is needed.

After a moment of contemplation, Taesan recalled one skill.

Transcendence skill. Black color.

The power of the god beyond principles and laws, devouring everything.

"Shall I give it a try?"

Taesan gathered the black color.
