Chapter 462

462. The 88th Floor, Those Who Want to Become Gods (1)

[You were expected to come back as a god.]

A voice filled with fatigue and warning resonates.

[The situation on Earth is also being monitored from here. It's not a difficult prediction. So, we prepared for it and set the difficulty level of the labyrinth. You managed to reach the transcendent level, albeit imperfectly. That's within the allowed range.]

Bal Bach, in its perfect form, descends upon the labyrinth.

[But... the power of the high god is beyond expectations.]

A skill that denies the laws of the world, transcending [self-immutability].

"Is there a problem?"

[There's a problem. That power is dangerous. Just by existing here, you can distort the laws of the labyrinth.]

"Don't worry. You can't handle it at that level yet."

Self-immutability only activates when it directly targets him. It has no effect on laws that simply exist and naturally influence the flow, like the laws of the labyrinth.

However, the boundaries in Balbam's voice did not disappear.

[As you said, it's not a problem now, but... who knows what will happen in the future.]

"I'll make sure I don't get hurt in the labyrinth then."

[That's unknown. There's no way to determine anything in this world where the existence of the labyrinth is uncertain.]

Taesan did not deny it. Balbam's boundaries were reasonable.

"So?"

[To be honest, I want to seal your powers.]

Balbam was the administrator of the labyrinth.

He was born to manage the labyrinth, eliminate all unstable elements, and correct errors. That's why Taesan's self-preservation instincts were annoyed and couldn't bear it.

[But... the wizard told me to let you go.]

Balbam desperately suppressed his emotions.

[My master has ordered it, so I won't intervene either.]

"The wizard said so."

[I can't understand. You're leaving the possibility of destroying the labyrinth open.]

Balbam grumbled, but it seemed like he had no intention of disobeying the wizard's orders. He sparkled his eyes.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Just in case, I'll ask, but you're not thinking of sealing your own self-transcendence, are you?"

"No."

Taesan shook his head. With a firm attitude, Balbambara didn't say anything more.

"You should be careful too. I don't know how you stole the power of the gods, but that's not the power of this world. You could destroy this world and cause chaos. You, as the master of power, are also included in that."

Balbambara warned Taesan.

Taesan nodded in agreement, acknowledging the reasonable words.

"I don't know when you'll use it, so I'll prepare the compensation for the labyrinth a little at a time. I thought things were settled, but it looks like I'll be busy again."

"Just a minute."

Taesan caught Balbambara, who was about to leave again.

"Why is that?"

"Can I use the points in a different way?"

Taesan currently has over a million points.

Until now, Taesan had used his points to increase his skill proficiency.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, as the proficiency of many skills rose to a certain level, it became increasingly difficult to raise their proficiency with points.

In the case of top-tier skills, the point consumption was too great compared to the proficiency gained. Even if I used up all the points I had to raise the proficiency of magic, I could only increase it by about 3 or 4% at most.

On the other hand, there was no reason to raise the proficiency of mediocre skills. Generally, the higher the proficiency, the more points were consumed. And there were skills that would naturally reach 100% proficiency without any investment.

Exchanging points for gold and stats was the worst of all.

In the end, Taesan had nothing to do with points.

As the administrator of the labyrinth, he might know some way. With that thought, Taesan grabbed Balbam.

[It's about points.]

Balbam stopped moving.

After a moment of contemplation, he opened his mouth.

[It's not impossible. For convenience, I divided the uses into three categories, but points are a kind of reward given to you. You can use them in other ways. I thought it would be resolved with three options, so I made it that way.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is that so?"

In reality, it was true. Taesan had used his points efficiently to level up while coming this far.

But now, he had become too strong, and it was inefficient to use points to increase his proficiency.

Balbambara made a decision.

[Good. I'll give you a reward with the points you have. Equipment or skill. Which one do you want?]

"Just a moment."

This time, it was Taesan's turn to think.

"What level of equipment are we talking about?"

[It's not something that will disappoint you. To be specific, it's equipment that's currently being sold in the store. The skill is also of similar value.]

"That's a relief."

The equipment that could be bought with points. If converted to gold, it would only be worth around 200,000 gold. Equipment of that value would be a huge loss.

Fortunately, it didn't seem like that would happen.

Equipment or skill.

The conclusion came quickly.

"I'll choose skill."

Taesan had a close relationship with Half-ran and Cos-lun, two excellent blacksmiths.

Equipment could be made anytime using materials.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But it wasn't a skill. Meeting the conditions was extremely difficult. Even now, I still haven't acquired a few skills I had in my previous life.

In terms of equal value, of course, skills were superior. As Taesan drew his conclusion, Barbalbam quickly organized things.

[Then, let's give you a choice.] [1. Attack Skill] [2. Defense Skill] [3. Support Skill]

"Is that the end of the three options?"

[If you think about directly specifying the skill you want and getting it, I'm sorry, but that's impossible. That's a matter of exceeding the framework allowed by the labyrinth.]

Attack, defense, and support.

Taesan made his choice.

"I'll take the support skill."

In the case of attack skills, having a boundary line now didn't mean much. Defense skills were the same. There were countless skills that could save one's life, such as self-protection, attack nullification, last chance, and endurance.

So, it was undoubtedly the support skill. Barbalbam accepted Taesan's choice.

[Among the skills allowed for you now... this one should be suitable.] [Barbalbam activated #000421.] [You have acquired the special passive skill [Cooldown Acceleration].]

Taesan's eyes sparkled."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

You could somewhat guess the effect just by the skill name.

[Special Passive Skill: Cooldown Acceleration] [Proficiency: 1%] [You can specify a piece of equipment or skill with a cooldown and reduce its cooldown time. However, if the cooldown time exceeds one month, it cannot be specified, and once specified, the original cooldown time of the equipment or skill will be restored, and the target cannot be changed until then. The cooldown time is reduced by 10%.]

It was a skill as expected. You could accelerate the cooldown time of a skill or equipment with a cooldown.

"Pretty good."

Taesan was impressed.

A 10% reduction in cooldown time. In and of itself, it didn't seem like a big deal. Reducing 30 days to 27 days wouldn't have a huge impact, anyway.

But the important thing was not the present, but the future.

As you increased the proficiency of this skill, the reduction rate would increase. From 10% to 30%, from 30% to 50%. Maybe even higher than that.

The value of that moment would increase exponentially.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I can use the copy skill every thirty minutes, and the selective exclusion skill every half day. It was a skill that actually increased the utilization rate of skills by several times.

Although it was impossible to set a skill with a cooldown of over a month, Taesan didn't have any skills with a cooldown of over a month. In fact, it was possible to use it with all skills.

[Looking at his expression, it seemed satisfactory.]

"Enough."

This was beyond what he had expected in terms of performance.

Taesan immediately chose a skill to use with the cooldown acceleration. The skill was Limited Blink.

It didn't matter much since it was only 10%. Instead, he thought he would designate it as a skill to use frequently and quickly raise his proficiency.

Meanwhile, Balbam, who had been watching him quietly, opened his mouth.

[Is the selection over?]

"Yeah. But why are you waiting? Don't you have something to do?"

[Come to think of it, I had something to explain to you. Now, let's head down to the labyrinth. I'll wait for you on the 88th floor.]

Balbam's body jumped through space. Taesan went down the stairs.

[88th Floor Quest Start.] [Bring peace to the world.] [Reward: A staff of a gear-turning something.] [Secret Reward:???]"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

On the 88th floor, Balbambara was waiting.

[Well, I've created this 88th floor just for you. Let me explain about the quest.]

Taesan stood in front of Balbambara.

Balbambara's mouth opened.

[The place you're going to is Mariseion. It's a world where two immortals have been fighting for hundreds of years to become gods.]

* * *

"That's weird."

It hadn't been long since Taesan had obtained divinity. And yet, the quest on the 88th floor was related to him. Balbambara replied calmly.

[It's just a simple coincidence. Your task is simple. The world has been devastated by the long struggle between the two immortals. Bring peace to that place and restore the world to its original state.]

"Just a minute."

Taesan raised his hand.

[Do you have any questions?]

"If I become a god, do they also want to receive the worship of all people like me?"

[No. There are many ways to become a god. The method you've achieved is quite special. Originally, it's much simpler than that.]

"Can I ask what kind of methods there are?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a story that didn't matter much to Taesan, who had already become a transcendent being, but he was curious. The path to becoming a transcendent being.

As the green witch's goal was to become a transcendent being, it wasn't bad to listen to it.

[You know, too. The god of Begesuta, Harmon. He wasn't receiving the worship of all people. But he was a god.]

"That's what I'm curious about."

Taesan only knew of reaching a high level of enlightenment through the worship of all people or obtaining a domain on his own. Balbam explained.

[There are many ways. One of them is the imprint on the world.]

"Imprint?"

[If the thought that the being is a god is engraved in everyone's mind, like common sense. If that imprint is etched into the world for a long time, the being becomes a god.]

People think of a certain being as a god.

Their faith spreads to others.

Eventually, if everyone comes to think of that being as a god.

That being truly becomes a god."

Note: "초월자" is translated to "transcendent being", but it can also be translated to "transcender" or "someone who has transcended". The term is often used in fantasy or mythological contexts to refer to a being that has surpassed human limitations.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When you are worshipped, your power and authority as a god will increase. However, what's important is the concept. People's thoughts become power, creating phenomena in the world. That's how you can become a god."

Balbambara pointed to the distant mountain.

"You're the one who's forcing people to worship you in an extreme way, making them believe in you. Originally, it would have taken hundreds or thousands of years to gain their trust."

"Is that so?"

"There are other ways to achieve it. It doesn't matter if it's through bloodline, contract, or anything else. If you have the qualifications to become a god and overcome the corresponding trials, you'll become a god. There are a few more ways, but... I can't tell you everything. The two methods I mentioned are the most common ways to transcend."

"It doesn't seem that difficult."

"It's not impossible. However, there are limits to the realm you can reach through those means."

Balbambara said nonchalantly.

"There are two types of transcenders. One is a transcender who exists by relying on something. The other is a transcender who governs the laws of the world and dominates concepts. As long as the concept itself doesn't disappear, they won't perish."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I knew that difference. It was different from planet gods like Lebinenofna Harmon and transcendent beings like Maria, who were on a different level altogether.

[Even if there are special cases like the Demon God, the level of dominating concepts cannot be reached by relying on something else. It can only be reached through one's own power.]

"Is that the difference?"

The image of the green witch appeared in Taesan's mind.

She didn't seem to be unaware of this fact. With her power, it wouldn't be impossible to slowly gain the worship of everyone.

"Do you want to reach the realm of governing laws?"

Taesan organized his thoughts and opened his mouth.

"Then the two immortals are trying to become gods, each in their own way."

[You're close. Thanks to that, the world is in a huge mess. It's also having a bad influence on the surroundings. Solving that is the quest this time.]

"Alright."

[Then go and come back.]

Balbambara opened up space. Before entering it, Taesan asked.

"Does it matter how I do it?"

[It doesn't matter. Whether you pursue a peaceful method, resolve it through a deal, or crush it with force, it's all up to you.]

"That's right, then."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Tae-san raised the corners of his mouth at Balbam's response.

He inserted his body into the space beyond. A new world appeared."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
