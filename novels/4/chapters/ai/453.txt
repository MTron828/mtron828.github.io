**Episode 454**

**454. The Seventh Return, Earth (6)**

The apostle is moving. The numerous, branched, jelly-like substances are rushing towards Taesan.

The power contained in each one was an overwhelming force that even Taesan couldn't underestimate.

Taesan gripped his sword tightly.

**Kwagagagang!**

An explosion occurred. Taesan took a step forward, using his arms, legs, and entire body to wield his sword. The jelly-like substances burst and scattered in all directions.

Taesan gathered his magic as it was.

[You have activated Baal's Dark Space Rush.]

The darkened space flew towards the apostle. The apostle quickly gathered the scattered jelly-like substances to defend its body.

**Kuuuuuuung!**

A loud noise erupted.

The apostle's jelly-like body, which had collided with the space rush, suffered a slight loss.

The apostle of the gods. A being that destroys numerous worlds and disrupts the global order.

Its strength is transcendent. Even Diana, who has reached the boundary, would have almost no chance of winning against the apostle.

But...

'I will become even stronger.'
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was on the sixth return to the earth that he defeated the apostle, and he had become overwhelmingly stronger than before.

The apostle in front of him seemed no different from the one he had faced before, and it was unable to become his opponent.

There was no reason to hesitate. Taesan took a step forward and charged towards the apostle in an instant.

And at that moment, the apostle's body, made up of droplets, exploded.

Taesan, thinking it was an attack, protected himself with his divine power.

But the scattered droplets did not target Taesan.

[Huh?]

The apostle had broken down into thousands, tens of thousands of tiny droplets, each the size of a small water droplet.

'Separation?'

Among the scattered droplets, Taesan sensed the apostle's will and power in the smallest one.

That was the core. Taesan reflexively tried to target that droplet, but the droplets scattered in all directions.

They disrupted his vision and confused his senses. The droplets were too small, and Taesan momentarily lost track of the core's location.

The droplets seemed to have no intention of fighting Taesan, and were spreading out across the entire United States.

"Tsk."

Taesan clicked his tongue. He realized what the apostle was aiming for. He quickly cast magic and dark magic towards the scattered droplets."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Quagaga River!"

In an instant, thousands of dots evaporated and disappeared.

But an even greater number scattered in all directions.

Taesan quickly chased after them.

The goal of the Four Gods was not to defeat Taesan, nor was it to harm people.

It was to destroy the pillars that had appeared across the United States.

* * *

"Is it okay to just wait here like this?"

A Korean man guarding the pillar said with an uncertain expression.

He was Lee Chang-soon.

Although he wasn't a top-tier hard mode player, he had the power of the upper ranks, having cleared up to the 60th floor.

His role was to defend the pillar in the American interior.

However, since most monsters were coming from the outskirts of the United States, there wasn't much he could do even in the midst of a fierce battle.

"I think I should go help."

"No."

A French hard mode player replied to Lee Chang-soon's worried words.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The quest goal is just a pillar. If we only focus on pushing forward, we won't be able to respond when the enemy targets this place. At the very least, we need to deploy a minimal defense team."

"I think that's right, but it's still uncomfortable."

Lee Chang-soo grumbled and suppressed his emotions.

He was staring blankly ahead, killing time.

"...Huh?"

There was something small floating in front of him.

"Slime?"

It was a black slime.

It was so small, about the size of a water droplet, that it was easy to overlook if you didn't pay attention.

"What's that?"

Just as Lee Chang-soo was about to approach it in wonder, the slime suddenly burst into action.

In an instant, the slime had grown to the size of a small hill and was rushing towards the players who were defending the pillar. They were caught off guard and couldn't respond in time.

At that moment, the magic circle that Taesan had set up earlier was activated.

Kyiiiing!

A brilliant blue barrier shone brightly, blocking the slime's attack. The players, who had finally grasped the situation, screamed and readied their weapons.

"What, what's going on!"

"It's the enemy!"

One of the hot-headed players hastily counterattacked the slime from outside the barrier. At the same time, the slime roughly engulfed him.

"Ah?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But it was too late when they realized something was wrong. The ones who had gone beyond the wall had resisted, but it was meaningless and they were devoured anyway.

It was only then that they realized the creature in front of them was an unbeatable existence.

The creature grew its body again and struck the wall.

Cracks began to appear on the wall.

"What do we do?"

"What can we do? We have to risk our lives to stop it."

With determined faces, they grasped their weapons. The wall was about to collapse. It was the moment they were about to charge in with a battle cry.

Kwaaaang!

The creature disappeared with a loud explosion.

"Huh?"

Those who had steeled themselves for death stopped in their tracks. It felt like something had passed by, but it was beyond their level to see or feel.

"......Lord Taesan?"

* * *

Taesan quickly sprang into action.

He was tracking down the scattered creature, erasing it one by one.

But it wasn't going to end like this. The number of creatures exceeded tens of thousands, and they were scattered all over the United States. Even if Taesan was strong, he would have to suffer significant losses to clean them all up.

"Akasha, assist me."

[As you wish, Master.] [You have activated magic overlap.] [You have activated Great Destruction [Rejection].]"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The overlapping magic of negation begins.

And only then did Kim Hwi-yeon, who had realized through communication that each pillar was being attacked, shout quickly.

"Everyone! Use the magic circle to move to each pillar!"

Gosin's goal was not to kill them, but to destroy the pillars.

If the monsters hadn't entered yet, it wouldn't have mattered, but since they had already entered, maintaining their formation was meaningless.

People quickly used Beldegkia's magic circle to move towards the pillars being attacked by the apostles.

At the same time, the slime covered them.

"Hold on for your lives and block it!"

"Aaaaah!"

Cries and screams erupted. They threw their bodies to block the pillars before the surrounding walls were destroyed.

Even if they were apostles, if they received the help of the magic circle and used all their strength, they could hold on for a while.

And during that time, Taesan finished his magic.

He overlapped the great collapse of negation three times and released it.

[You have activated the magic release.]

The concentrated great collapse shoots up high into the sky. A black sun rises over the American continent."

Note: There may be some nuances or cultural references that don't translate perfectly, but I've done my best to provide an accurate translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the Magic Explosion.]

And the sun bursts.

Incalculable fragments scatter in all directions. Taesan focuses his mind, undeterred. With the assistance of Akasha, he detects all the scattered apostles on the American continent and identifies their locations.

And he accurately casts a spell towards those locations.

[You have activated Magic Tracking.] [You have activated Infallible Shot.]

The bursting sun becomes rain, piercing the earth.

Kugugugugukung!

The apostles aiming for the pillar are pierced by the rain and explode. Some try to dodge quickly, but the dark rain accurately pierces the apostles.

In an instant, the apostles lose more than half of their numbers and burrow deep into the earth.

The situation becomes slightly more stable. People catch their breath, grasp the situation, and shout.

"It's Taesan-nim!"

"He saved us!"

A new faith begins to take root in Taesan.

Taesan, who quickly gathers his faith, takes flight.

"Ta, Mr. Taesan, what happened?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The guy I was fighting against has scattered in all directions and is targeting the pillar. Their goal isn't to kill us. It's to destroy the pillar."

"Anyway... from now on, I won't focus on maintaining the front line, but on defending the pillar."

Kim Hwi-yeon hastily nodded his head.

Thanks to Taesan's quick repair of the communication base, communication was restored immediately. The decision was quickly conveyed to everyone.

People gathered around the pillar.

And changes also occurred among the monsters.

Ordinary monsters almost disappeared, and ones that could manipulate time or self-destruct to deal massive damage appeared.

"There's no way we can just sit back and do nothing."

Taesan is incredibly strong right now.

Beldegkia and Diana also joined forces with them.

Naturally, the limits of Gosin's power, which could be demonstrated, also increased.

However, what appeared was a saint similar to the previous return.

In this quest, the focus is on destroying the pillar, and the determination to mobilize all strength at the end can be felt.

"I don't plan on just taking it lying down."

[You have activated the Frozen World.]

Zzzt!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The chill swept in, freezing all the monsters in front of him. Taesan pulled out a window that moved on its own, with an arrow merged into one. The arrow, now a single entity, could move freely without being bound to Taesan. It moved quickly, piercing through the monsters.

The people let out a mix of cheers and gasps.

When he made up his mind and moved, monsters below A-grade couldn't even set foot in the United States.

But Taesan couldn't move easily.

The subtle presence of the assassin, hidden deep in the earth, couldn't be detected.

It was unclear whether the assassin was optimized for hiding or using a different method, but it was impossible to predict when and where they would pop out.

"Please."

"Yes!"

Kim Hwi-yeon replied with determination.

The people did their best.

They used communication to strategically deploy personnel and moved people around as needed.

And Taesan focused on blocking the assassin.

Rumble.

In the western United States, at the end of the pillar, the slime appeared. The players who belatedly detected the slime screamed. It was a moment when they were trying to prepare for the shock.

Quack!

The slime dispersed and disappeared.

Taesan appeared in its place.

Taesan waved his hand.

[You activated the Starlight Arrow.] [You activated the Magic Separation.] [You activated the Magic Tracking.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Kiiiiing!

The arrow of stardust draws its trajectory. In an instant, it appears across the entire United States, piercing through all the jelly-like creatures.

And then it takes off.

The body soars into the sky. The air bursts, and an acceleration that humans can't withstand is applied.

Taesan arrives at the eastern end in an instant.

There, he annihilates the jelly-like creature that was about to attack the pillar.

The people guarding the pillar stumble.

"That, I'm sure we received communication that you were in the west just a little while ago......"

"I flew here."

"Uh......"

People can't continue their conversation.

The apostle is using every means to destroy the pillar, avoiding Taesan's gaze.

But everything is being blocked.

The jelly-like creature is rapidly decreasing in number. It won't be long before we can finish off the apostle's main body.

However, the situation for other players is not good.

At first, there were no particular problems. The leaders of each country did their best, and they were able to block it without much damage. People successfully defended all the pillars.

But as time passed, problems arose."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The monsters became even more ferocious and started to act faster.

The appearance of the monsters was also specialized only for destroying the pillars.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

"Ku-uu-uu-ek!"

"Block it with your body!"

A drill-like monster charged towards the pillar. People threw themselves to block it, but not a few of them were injured.

"Move the wounded to the sanctuary and recover!"

Oliver shouted roughly.

The problem was simple.

They were limited. People were dying, and the number of wounded was increasing. Although the sanctuary in Las Vegas could heal them immediately, there was a clear time constraint for moving them.

As the endless monster attacks continued, fatigue accumulated, and their concentration wavered, but the monsters didn't.

They were created tools. There was no mental exhaustion. They wouldn't stop until they achieved their given objectives.

Bel dentiana, Diana, and Lee Tae-yeon were also stuck, constantly facing S-grade monsters.

As a result, their defense was gradually being breached.

"It's a bit early, but there's no choice."

Muttering to himself, Taesan went to see Kim Hwi-yeon.

"Let's abandon a few pillars."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

“Huh?”

“It’s impossible to protect everything anyway.”

Taesan said calmly. He had expected this from the beginning.

There were too many pillars.

No matter how quickly they moved their personnel, it was impossible to block everything.

It was better to give up cleanly and take what they could, rather than getting too attached to something beyond their abilities and losing everything. That was Taesan’s thought.

“There are pillars that aren’t installed with magic circles, far away, right? Let’s give up on those.”

Not all pillars were at an equal distance. There were some that were relatively very far away.

“And let’s focus our strength on the remaining pillars. Even if the slime appears, we can somehow endure it.”

“Is it possible?”

“It’s difficult in our current state, but if we give up a few pillars, it’ll be enough.”

The apostle, who had been divided into tens of thousands of pieces and had its power weakened, had lost most of its slime due to Taesan.

In their current state, if several top-tier hard mode players combined their strength, they could buy some time, even if only for a short while.

“Got it.”
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She withdrew all the personnel stationed at the distant, hard-to-defend pillars.

Naturally, the defense of the other pillars was strengthened, and the monsters focused their power on the abandoned pillars.

And Taesan moved.

"Open."

With the command, the earth collapsed.

"Haha!"

Kim Hwi-yeon stumbled backward, momentarily terrified, as the earth collapsed.

The end of the hole was not visible.

It wasn't just because it was dark.

Even from her perspective, the depth was so great that she couldn't see the end.

Taesan threw his body towards that place.

His physical body fell rapidly, passing through the surface and piercing the mantle.

And Taesan arrived at the deepest part of the earth.

Taesan protected his body and expanded his senses. In an instant, every atom around him was detected by Taesan's senses.

At the same time, the Sage moved.

Sending a blob of saliva to the surface, it targeted the pillars. But the people who had already entered Taesan's domain and were prepared were able to withstand the Sage's attack.

Zzzt!

"Kkkkkuuuu!"

"Aaaaaah!"

Dozens of people vomited blood and collapsed. Instinctively, they realized that they were insignificant beings that couldn't even put up a small resistance.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If they hadn't been separated into countless branches, they would have all died just by existing here. The being they faced was such an existence.

But they didn't back down.

"Taesan, sir!"

They cried out Taesan's name and charged towards death.

[The proficiency of Divine Power increased by 1%.]

They desperately held on and eventually protected the pillar. And in the meantime, Taesan detected everything.

Not just the surface, but also the interior of the earth, without missing a single thing.

In the end, Taesan was able to detect the core of the apostle that he had lost.

"Create a path."

Quadruple crack!

The rock broke open, and the path expanded.

Taesan immediately launched himself. The apostle's core tried to dodge late, but it was already too late.

Taesan precisely pierced the apostle's core with his sword.

[You have defeated $!@xx!.] [Your spiritual power has been activated.] [The proficiency of Distorted Spiritual Tuning has increased by 4%.] [The proficiency of Black has increased by %$!!@.] [The proficiency of Boundary has increased by !%#$@.] [The proficiency of Command has increased by 2%.] [The proficiency of the Will of All Things has increased by 4%.] [You have obtained Black [Fragmentation].]"

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As the apostle fell, the jelly-like creatures that were attacking the pillars simultaneously collapsed. Those who were risking their lives to defend were taken aback for a moment.

But their surprise didn't last long.

They realized that the one who had blocked the jelly-like creatures was Taesan.

"Wow!"

No matter how great Taesan's power was, there were certainly those who didn't believe it. It was strange to think that all humans would believe in Taesan, since humans are all different.

But as the quest progressed, those kinds of people gradually disappeared.

Now, except for a handful of people, everyone began to believe in and look up to Taesan.

[The proficiency of Taesan's divine power increased by 1%.]

Taesan's divine power proficiency reached 99%."
