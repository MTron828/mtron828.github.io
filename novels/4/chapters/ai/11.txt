12. 1st Floor. The Seeker of the Gods. Paladin Ainzhar (7)

[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Hyung, this is different from the usual stories?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: What's this all of a sudden?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Paladin. You spit once and just leave?]

* * *

"Alright! There's no reason to delay, so let's begin right away."

Ainzhar began explaining the skill.

"There are numerous skills in the labyrinth."

There truly were many. There were thousands of skills that Taesan didn't need and hadn't learned. If you included the skills he didn't know, there were probably tens of thousands.

"However, I confidently believe that Levinev's technique is the best skill. It may not look flashy, but it's honest and practical. It's a skill that even the goddess herself praised."

Ainzhar said proudly.

"Do you know what the basic skill is?"

"It's the easiest skill to obtain within the labyrinth. You can acquire it with just one action."

"You know it well."
Ainzhar looked at Taesan with an impressed expression.

"It's basic information, but not something adventurers on the 1st floor would necessarily notice. It seems that the information here is well-known in your world, like mastering endurance and such."

"Yes."

Taesan responded, neatly storing the information in his mind.

"Still, from a teaching standpoint, I'll give you a simple explanation. Feel free to ask if there's any information you might not know."

Ainzhar cleared his throat with a smile.

"Taesan, what basic skills are you learning?"

"Swordsmanship and shield technique."

"Classic choices."

Ainzhar nodded approvingly.

"Swordsmanship for handling swords, shield technique for handling shields, and spear technique for handling spears. That's the basics."

Basic skills.

Skills obtained the moment you start handling a weapon. As proficiency increases, so does knowledge and utility with that weapon. It was a skill every player handled as a fundamental.
And for Taesan, it was a meaningless skill. He was a player who relied on straightforward skills rather than tricks. The utility of spears and swords had no significance to him, so he hadn't paid attention to their proficiency.

But now, things were different.

Now, he could obtain normal stats. It was also better to sufficiently raise basic skills.

"Levinenov's technique. We call it Ailac weaponry. Its effect is the integration of basic skills."

"...I see."

Taesan's expression cooled. Ainzhar smirked.

"You probably think it's meaningless right now."

"Even if the skills are combined, there won't be any change."

One might mistakenly think it's good because proficiency can be raised all at once. It might have been good for other skills. But it wasn't a basic skill.

Because there were system problems, the use of many weapons was not of great significance.

Ainzhar opened his mouth, perhaps knowing what Taesan was thinking.

"What's your additional attack power right now?"

"It's 1."

"...A cute number. It should be around 4 with that."

"Basic attack power should be about that much."

"Good."

Ainzhar stood in front of Taesan.

"Probably the attack power of that shield. Will you attack me with it?"
"Even if you don't hit any damage."

"Don't worry about that."

Ainzhar chuckled and activated the skill.

[Ainzhar has activated Target Fixation. Ainzhar will receive all attacks as fixed damage.]

"Well, give it a try."

If that's what you want.

Taesan swung his shield at Ainzhar's head.

Thunk!

[Ainzhar takes 4 damage.]

"...Was it really necessary to hit my head?"

"My mistake."

"Well, if that's how you feel..."

Ainzhar said with a slightly remorseful face.

"Now try hitting me with your fist."

He extended his chest as if to say to hit here instead of his head. Since it seemed like it would sting again if he hit his head this time, he willingly hit his chest.

[Ainzhar takes 2 damage.]

"Have you figured out what I'm trying to say?"

"Are you talking about the change in damage depending on the striking weapon?"

"That's right. You catch on fast. It's because of this very reason that adventurers stick to using only one weapon."

It was a simple problem.
Weapons each have their own attack power value. Right now it might be around 1, which is weak, but later it can reach hundreds or even thousands.

Additionally, additional attack power applies only when attacking with the corresponding weapon.

"For example, if you're wearing gauntlets with an attack power of 50 and a sword with an attack power of 20 at the same time, when you hit with the sword, only the 20 attack power applies. Conversely, if you hit with the gauntlets, only the 50 attack power applies. You can't get 70."

"Of course, isn't that obvious?"

If you wear two weapons and their attack powers are added together, all players would be carrying weapons all over. They would be attaching a dagger to each finger.

But that's not it, so used used
Every time, only a weak basic damage was inflicted, which was quite uncomfortable. However, it was a systemic issue, so there was nothing to be done but to leave it alone.

"My sect, which venerates Lord Lebinerf, detested such things. My body is my weapon, and my weapon is my body. There can be no distinction in handling. Thus, after extensive research, I developed the Ayrlak weapon technique. I exerted myself for it."

Ainz chuckled and said, "The effect in the labyrinth is simple. Integration of basic skills. And integration of damage from all equipped gear. Just two things."

Taisan's eyebrows twitched. "The sum of attack power?"

"You've grasped it correctly. It means that if you wear a sword with an attack power of 20 and gauntlets with 50, it totals to 70."

"...And how far does this apply?"

"Naturally, to every part of the body! Whether you strike with your arms, bash with your shoulders, or kick with your feet, the 70 attack power will apply!"

"...," Taisan groaned. In essence, it meant his entire body became a weapon.

Players use only one weapon. After all, only one attack power would apply anyway.
However, with the Ayrlak weapon technique, there was no need for such things. Gauntlets used in hand-to-hand combat, along with various pieces of armor that added attack power and rings that had been deemed unnecessary. All could be worn simultaneously.

Although it might not seem valuable right now, as one breaks through the labyrinth and obtains equipment, its value increases exponentially.

"It's a great skill."

It was difficult to express just how good it was with words alone. For Taisan, it was a skill he hadn't been able to obtain in the past. The Ayrlak weapon technique alone had enough value to be considered a main skill.

"For someone like you who already has endurance, the surprise may be minimal, but for ordinary adventurers, it's a skill of immeasurable value that they could never obtain even if they devoted their entire lives to it. Do you have the intention to learn?"

"Of course, I'll learn it."

Without a moment's hesitation, Taisan replied, which satisfied Ainz Ooal Gown.

"Good. Then let's focus on the Ayrlak weapon technique. Let your whole body relax and accept it."

"Can you really give it to me like this?"

"Unlike other skills, this is a skill I've acquired and learned myself. There's no issue in passing it on. Just like this, it's possible."

Ainz Ooal Gown placed his hand on Taisan's shoulder.

"Ah."

Taisan let out a soft groan. Something flowed into him: the types of techniques, methods of control, and various other information.
"I felt a sensation I had never experienced before in my life.

"You have received the Ayrlak technique from its founder. You have obtained the top-tier skill [Ayrlak Weapon Technique].

"The basic skill [Shield Techniques] has been integrated into the Ayrlak Weapon Technique. The basic skill [Sword Techniques] has been integrated into the Ayrlak Weapon Technique.

"How is it?"

"...It's surprisingly simple."

"That's because I have mastered the Ayrlak technique to 100%. Otherwise, it would have been quite challenging for a long time."

Ainz Ooal Gown chuckled. With that remark, Taisan gained new information.

'So it's possible to easily transmit physical skills one has created.'

This was also information he hadn't known in his previous life. Players diligently learned basic skills but did not create anything using them, so even the existence of advanced skills like this had not been widely known.

"Let me check once."

Taisan opened his skill window.

[Top-tier Skill: Ayrlak Weapon Technique] [Proficiency: 1%] [A technique for handling weapons and the body. It seems immature still, causing loss in the transmission of power.]
"As proficiency increases, your handling will become more adept, so it would be good to train diligently every day without fail. Also, please take this."

Ainz Ooal Gown handed over a rusty ring.

[Faded Ring] [Attack +1] [A ring that someone used for a long time. Originally, it must have had considerable value.]

"I can't give you more than this because I shouldn't lose sight of its important value due to the benefits. I apologize."

"This is sufficient."

In the past, he would have likely discarded it as useless. After all, you can't exactly fight with a ring. However, now that he had learned the Ayrlak technique, the value of this ring was equivalent to a rusty sword.

Taisan received the ring and put it on.

"Hmm. I've conveyed everything I could with this... but it's a bit regrettable. Anyway, since I can't immediately lower the depth..."

Ainz Ooal Gown, deep in thought, made up his mind.

"Would you care for a sparring match?"

Ainz Ooal Gown drew his sword.

"It's a technique you've just learned. Wouldn't it be appropriate to test it out before a real battle?"

"Of course."

There was no reason to refuse. Taisan raised his shield.

* * *

In the labyrinth, every action is evaluated accordingly.
Even in a completely useless room, if you meticulously examine it and find something, your proficiency in perception rises. Continuously blocking the opponent's attacks increases your shield technique proficiency.

Therefore, fighting against strong opponents is meaningful in itself.

Ainz Ooal Gown sparred with Taisan for two full days, and Taisan gained a lot from it.

First, he acquired one skill.

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Endurance in Battle] [Proficiency: 3%] [Allows prolonged battles with minimal fatigue accumulation.]

This continuous activation skill enabling long-term battles made a significant difference depending on whether one possessed it or not. It was this skill that allowed him to spar continuously for days against S-rank monsters.

However, this skill was something he had somewhat given up on in this place. Its acquisition required players to fight among themselves, but since Ainz was a solo player, he had half-heartedly abandoned it.

According to Itaeyeon, there were other adventurers, but there was no room for leisurely sparring.

He could obtain it thanks to Ainz.

In addition, most of his skill proficiencies had increased.

"Is that enough?"

"Yes, it's enough."
The results over the past two days were too significant to dismiss. Taisan sincerely thanked Ainz Ooal Gown.

"It's something I did because I enjoyed it. And it was an enjoyable experience for me too."

Ainz Ooal Gown looked at Taisan with a wondrous expression.

"Now, a adventurer of the 1st Floor has an unbelievable sense and ability... As expected, I have an eye for talent."

He smiled contentedly and continued.

"Taisan, I have two promises to ask of you."

"Please, go ahead."

"Now that you've also learned the Ilyak technique, you can teach it to someone else. But never teach it to someone worthless, like a scavenger. If you break this promise, I'll personally come to kill you."

His tone was serious, devoid of any hint of jest. Taisan nodded in understanding.

"Understood."

"And the other thing is, if you discover any information about Lord Levenoff, make sure to inform me."

"It's unlikely I'll meet Ainz Ooal Gown again in the Labyrinth."

Itaeyeon said so immediately. She hadn't seen Ainz Ooal Gown since the 1st Floor. Ainz Ooal Gown gave a wry smile.

"I'm not holding out much hope anyway. I'm just clinging to a miracle."
His face was visibly worn out. Perhaps he had spent quite a bit of time here without finding anything.

And at the end of it all, he discovered the dead goddess.

If Ainz Ooal Gown had succeeded in finding the goddess, he either saved her or died with her. But neither had happened.

Therefore, unless a major variable occurred, it meant that before Ainz Ooal Gown could find her, Levenoff would be killed by someone else.

To tell or not to tell.

It was a kind of crossroads.
