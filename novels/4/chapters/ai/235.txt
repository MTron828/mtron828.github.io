Chapter 236

236. The Fourth Return. Earth (3)

"What are you going to do then?"

"Let's stay quiet."

Kim Hui-yeon answered the words of Soo-jang-san. She furrowed her brow.

As expected. The next quest would be a quest where people from each region would gather in Seoul. Therefore, I had made a rough plan beforehand.

"First... we'll go to protect them."

Everyone nodded in agreement with her words.

The quest was to protect the people coming from Seoul. It didn't mean waiting quietly for them to arrive, but rather, we had to move to rescue them ourselves.

"But we're too few compared to the place we need to go to."

That was the point of concern.

The number of their forces was not enough to protect all regions. It was a great burden to distribute personnel to minimize risks.

"Where are the regions?"

"In Gwangju, Daegu, Busan, Wonju in Gangwon-do, Daejeon, and Jeju-do. There are six places."

"It's a lot."

(Note: The translation is in Simplified Chinese, as per the rules.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"How are we going to distribute them?"

Kim Hui-yeon, who had been thinking for a moment with her eyes closed, opened her mouth.

"We've decided to leave it to Ji and the normal mode players."

"If it were in the past, I wouldn't know... but now that Taesan is helping, they might be able to stop them too."

The people agreed. The normal mode player who was within Taesan's area was able to defeat the monster without much trouble.

In other words, only the hard mode players and solo mode players would be leaving.

"First, I'll go with Seo Jang-san and Geum Jung-geun, and half of the hard mode players will go to Daejeon. And the rest will head to Gwangju."

They also agreed to this. As soon as Baek, a D-grade monster, returned, he burst out. The main quest would become even more difficult from now on.

And Kim Hui-yeon's judgment was not wrong. If the hard mode players from the past had been in charge, they would have been able to win, but as it was, many lives were lost in vain.

"So, the remaining half of the hard mode players will be divided again, with half going with Lee Tae-yeon to Wonju and the rest going with Kang Jun-hyeok to Gwangju. Is that okay?"

"Yes."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taeyeon and Kang Junhyeok nodded with serious faces. The gap between them and the hard mode players had grown wider with each return, and now even if they ran for dozens of miles, they couldn't catch up.

If they worked together, even if a C-grade monster appeared, they wouldn't be easily defeated. It was a suitable lineup.

"Well, there are three more regions, then..."

Daegu, Busan, and Jeju Island.

In fact, these places were the farthest away. The silence was broken, and people's gazes converged on one spot.

Tae-san opened his mouth.

"I'll take care of the other three places."

"......Is it really possible?"

"No problem."

The response was met with admiration and reverence, mixed with a sigh. Kim Hui-yeon looked at Tae-san with a guilty face.

"I'm sorry."

"It doesn't matter."

And then they set off. With the quest starting, there was no time to waste. The prepared ones took a deep breath and left the area. Kim Hui-yeon asked Tae-san just before she left.

"Tae-san, where are you going?"

"Busan."

"Busan..."

A slight concern appeared on Kim Hui-yeon's face.

"It's quite far, isn't it? I've heard that Busan is in a pretty dangerous situation."

Note: The text appears to be a scene from a fantasy novel or game, and the characters are likely players or adventurers in a virtual world.
Here is the translation of the text:

Most hardcore players have died. Only a few normal and easy mode players survived the previous return. I heard that it ended like that.

In reality, it's impossible to survive this time. Even the people from Busan thought so.

"Is that a problem?"

"...No, it was a pointless question."

Kim Hwiyeon seemed to understand Taesan's response and left.

"I'll go ahead and take a look."

"Brother, let's see each other again when we're alive."

"Ah, it's a bit annoying to control people...".

"This is also a good experience."

They scattered one by one.

Taesan opened his mouth.

"Barkazza. Do you know what to do?"

[Kick. I don't like it when something falls from the owner's hand, but if it's an order, I have no choice. Just specify the location and I'll finish it perfectly and come back.]

Taesan lightly touched Barkazza's head. Barkazza's eyes widened as he received the information and suddenly flew away.

Whoosh!

Barkazza flew away.

Taesan turned his gaze to Minerba.

"Alright, it might be a bit annoying, but it's your order. Let's see each other again later."

Minerba smiled mischievously and disappeared into the wind.

Left alone, Taesan also moved his feet.

"Busan?"

It was almost like the end of the world.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It'll take about thirty minutes to walk, I think."

"Eee!"

A man with a face full of wounds brandishes his weapon in a desperate manner.

"Aaaa!"

As he lets out a loud cry, he deflects the monster's attack and plunges his weapon deep into its body. The monster trembles and falls to the ground.

And then another monster takes its place.

"Clunk."

"Aaaaah!"

Cries of despair echo from all sides.

The man who knows the faces of the fallen sees his friends being defeated one by one and contorts his face in anger.

"Damned fools!"

He roughly opens his inventory and throws a potion at the monster. The potion hits the monster and releases the power it contained.

"Snap, snap, snap!"

Frost forms.

The bodies of the monsters are frozen, slowing down their movements.

However, it seems that the monsters are not severely affected, as they start moving again.

The man becomes frustrated. The powerful item he bought does not seem to have any significant effect.

"Everyone, how are you doing?"

"Not good."
Here is the translation of the given text:

A man with a serious expression, covered in wounds, shouted loudly. There were more monsters than their number. As the people around him became increasingly desperate, the wounded man gritted his teeth and snarled.

"......Break through!"

He charged forward, roughly, at the group of monsters. The people followed him, desperately.

"Waaaah!"

They barely managed to break through the monsters.

After running for a while, the wounded man panted and asked:

"How many of us survived?"

"It's almost everyone who's dying, and about half of the normal ones. Even some hard mode players have died."

"Damn it."

The wounded man scowled.

The quest cannot be refused. They began heading towards Seoul from Daegu.

And they encountered countless monsters.

Each one was equivalent to a hard mode, and there were over a hundred monsters. The sight was even more daunting than their determination. Despite their efforts to push forward, there was still a long way to go.

"Brother, we're done for..."

"Stop joking."

The worried people were comforted by the wounded man.

"You've seen the quest content. People will come from Seoul."

"Do you really think that's possible?"

The serious-looking man's words left the other man speechless.
Here is the translation:

There were too many monsters. I didn't think it was possible for people to come from Seoul.

"Why bother taking the dangerous path? There's no reason to do so."

"...I'll come. You've heard the story about the solo mode, haven't you?"

"But that's..."

Is that really the case?

The man couldn't answer with the question-filled gaze.

He was a hard mode player, and among them, he was a leader who led the strong players from Daegu.

So, he had heard many stories from the hard mode players from Seoul, including Kim Hwi-yeon and Geum Jung-geun.

A monster-like human being who had given a new power, known as the "Black Magic", to all the people of Seoul.

Not only that, but the other two solo mode players were also very strong, he said.

However, the man was skeptical even as he listened to the story.

Next to him, there was also a solo mode player, but his strength was not that impressive. It was just at the level of hard mode, but not that much stronger.

Although the difference in strength within the mode was large, I didn't think it would be that big of a difference.

Moreover, he had never seen the Taesan himself, so he could only hear the story.
Here is the translation of the text:

They were able to knock someone away just by throwing punches, and a crater would be formed on the ground just by jumping. "It's probably intentional."

They were desperate and needed something to rely on in their minds. That's why the existence of Taesan, a powerful being, was his judgment.

It's not weak, but it's at the level of a few hundred Senes in Hard Mode, he thought.

"... Whatever, we have to go to Seoul. Everyone, get ready."

The people gritted their teeth and stood up.

They moved forward slowly. Monsters appeared again.

The people's faces turned white at the sight.

"This, this is crazy."

Hundreds of monsters were blocking their way.

"Run......"

The man quickly shouted and turned around, but stopped talking.

There were also dozens of monsters behind them.

Upon regaining consciousness, he found himself surrounded by monsters.

A serious-looking man spoke blankly.

"It's over, I guess."

"I'm sorry, kids."

The wounded man hung his head.

"No, this is unavoidable. I did my best."

"But we've lasted this long. This is enough to be satisfied with and die."

"Mom, I'll go see you now."
Here is the translation of the text:

"One more, I'll make it."

They calmly accepted death. The man with wounds all over his body grasped his weapon with eyes that were blazing with anger.

"Let's kill one more on the way!"

"Yes!"

They made up their minds and charged forward.

Boom!

A loud noise came with something falling in front of them.

"Uh, oh no!"

"What's this?"

The people who were charging to the front stopped in shock. The dust settled, and the figure of the existence that had caused the loud noise appeared.

[I've arrived. Those things are annoying, so I'll just get rid of them.]

A weak voice rang out. The man's pupils dilated. Someone shouted.

"Monster!"

A green gargoyle appeared. The man reflexively drew his sword.

Ka-ka-ka!

[Zero damage to Barkazah.]

"What?"

[Don't do anything annoying. You're not our enemy.]

Barkazah clapped his hands. A barrier formed around them.

Ka-ka-ka!

[I have come to protect you on my master's orders.]

"Master?"

The conversation is smooth. Since there was no intention to harm them, the man put away his sword.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Alright, my master. The one with the name Kang Tae-san has ordered you to guard this place until we arrive in Seoul.]

Kang Tae-san.

His eyes, full of malevolence, trembled at the name. Barkagaz looked back at him.

[I know, it's a bother. It's not a big deal.]

“……Are you his subordinate…… or something?”

[Think about it comfortably.]

“That's amazing. Even monsters are used as subordinates.”

The calm man muttered to himself. He was amazed, but it was not unreasonable to think that one monster could be tamed. He thought that if he had one, he could at least survive halfway.

However, the ones who were trying to protect their leader from behind hesitated as the conversation continued.

The man spoke calmly.

“So, where is your master?”

Considering that he had tamed such a monster, his master must be much stronger than expected. He thought that if he had him, he could at least survive halfway.

But Barkagaz disappointed his expectations.

[He didn't come.]

“What?”

[I came alone. I'm enough on my own.]

“What's the point of......”

The man who was about to say something more stopped in surprise.

Ka-ka!

He didn't notice it, but the monster was continuously pounding against the stone wall with its claws.
Here is the translation of the text:

And there were no scratches on the wall whatsoever.

[I'll quickly tidy up since it's a bother.]

Barkaja clashed his fist.

A streak of blue light burst forth.

People let out screams and closed their eyes.

The sound of a loud crash and crumbling earth echoed.

And when they opened their eyes, everything around them had become flat.

* * *

“Ahahahaha!”

The middle-aged woman with a mummy-like appearance was tearing her hair in front of the sea.

“Ugh, this quest is ridiculous! Can't you make it a bit more reasonable?”

She laughed hollowly.

The people behind her, numbering dozens, were all slumped to the ground in a similar state.

"It's too unreasonable, even without consideration. There's no consideration…….”

The woman slumped down.

Her name was Lee Hye-yeon. She was a career woman who boasted of her abilities.

After completing a long project, she had come to Jeju Island for a change of pace. Just as she was about to take a step and enjoy a pleasant trip, the world began to collapse.

She had entered hard mode.

And when she returned to Earth, she returned to the position where she had entered the labyrinth in Jeju Island.
Here is the translation of the text:

There were sixty-seven million people living on the mainland, but on this island, it was a different story.

The overall number was small, so even the strong ones were few. It was fortunate that there were relatively few hard-mode players, at least, thanks to the minimal luck that followed.

However, as the monsters kept coming out relentlessly, the number of survivors kept dwindling, and by the third return, there were barely a few hundred left.

It was almost certain that they would be wiped out at the next return.

So, Lee Hye-yeon believed that. She thought that at the next return, they could go to Seoul. She thought that some means of transportation would appear.

But it wasn't.

"What's going on...?"

They had to cross the sea to get to Seoul.

She shook her head.

It was an impossible task. The planes were all destroyed, and even if they weren't, there was no one who could pilot them. The boats were a few small fishing boats left, but they were of no use.

Kururur.

The sea behind them was getting rougher and rougher.

There were monsters even underwater. Even if they tried to board the boat, they would become fish food.

"Kids, I think we've reached the end..."

"Don't want to die. Sister..."

"I'm the same. I want to live..."
Here is the translation of the text:

They hugged each other and cried. The monsters were slowly approaching them.

And then, a gust of wind blew.

"Hello?"

A beautiful woman with green hair appeared. Ihye-yun, who had been crying with tears, took a step back in surprise.

"Who are you?"

"Call me Jingling, if you understand."

"...Jingling?"

"Yes. My master told me to take you to Seoul."

"My master... Seoul... Could it be Kang Tae-san?"

Ihye-yun's muttering caught Minerva's attention.

"Don't you understand quickly? Does it mean you have the ability to survive?"

"No..."

A strange existence trying to help them. And Jingling.

I don't know the details, but there was only one existence with such power. Minerva smiled happily.

"So, don't worry. Little lives. I'll take you to safety."

"But..."

They looked out at the sea.

The monster that had been sleeping deep in the sea was stirring. If they tried to cross, they would all be buried.

But Minerva had no problems.

"Let's clear those out first."
Here is the translation of the text:

Minerva waved her hand. The wind became a sword and flew away.

The monsters approaching her all shattered.

"...what?"

"If there's no path, we can make one."

Minerva hummed and lifted her foot to the sea floor.

Then, the surface of the water broke.

The sea began to open.

"I'll get rid of the annoying things."

Minerva stomped her foot. The power that spread across the land from her foot shattered the sea monsters.

"...ah..."

"...ah..."

The people stared blankly at the miracle unfolding before their eyes.

Minerva pointed from the path that appeared between the sea. "Come quickly."
