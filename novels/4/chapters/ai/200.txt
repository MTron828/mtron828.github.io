Chapter 201

201. 45th floor (2)

[The secret room within another secret room. This is quite amazing.]

Tae-san entered the room. As he walked through the dusty corridor, he saw a small room.

In the room, there was a decayed skull and a small staff.

Tae-san grasped the staff.

[The staff of the ice path] [Consumed mana: 20] [Creates a path made of ice in front.]

It was a staff with a magic that had been a long time coming. The effect was not particularly impressive, just creating a path made of ice.

[You have activated the magic extraction.] [You have learned the basic magic [Ice Path].]

Tae-san couldn't bring any more staffs into this place.

Tae-san stretched out his hand towards the skull behind the staff.

Ki-i-i-ing.

However, the wall blocked Tae-san's hand. The wall, covered with countless magical characters, was firmly guarding the skull.

"This is as expected."

Tae-san had found the hidden secret room within the secret room.
Here is the translation of the text:

And she got a staff of ice path. However, there was a skull, but it seemed to be guarded by something, so she couldn't approach it, she said.

Tai Shan joined forces with the hand that touched the wall. The wall began to tremble violently and showed a stronger rebound effect.

"Can it be broken with strength?"

It can be broken. However, since it was resisting, it was unclear what kind of aftermath would occur.

Tai Shan opened his inventory.

[Unsealing Sword] [A sword imbued with the unsealing magic. It can unseal the seal of magic. However, it cannot unseal a higher-level seal of magic imbued in the sword.]

The magic unsealing sword he obtained earlier. He raised his hand that day.

[You have activated the magic extraction.] [You have obtained the beginner magic [Unsealing].] [Beginner magic: Unsealing.] [Mana consumption: 100] [Proficiency: 1%] [It can unseal the seal of magic. By increasing the consumed mana, it can increase the number of unsealed magic spells. However, it is still not possible to unseal many magic spells.]

The magic imbued in the sword disappeared, and the sword became ineffective.

Tai Shan put the sword away and raised his hand to the wall again.
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have activated the magic cancellation.]

Keying.

A ripple occurs around the magic core. The mana containing the cancellation power begins to spread and seep into the barrier.

The barrier trembles as if resisting, growing rough and uneven.

The mana of the great mountain begins to dissipate like water flowing away. The barrier starts to crack slowly.

Zzz...

And the barrier that couldn't withstand the pressure bursts apart.

The remnants of the magic scattered everywhere are swept away by the great mountain, which has taken up a skull.

From the skull, a faint magical power can be felt. The great mountain poured mana into the skull through the hand that held it.

Brrr.

The skull began to tremble.

A blue light appeared in the empty socket. The scattered bone fragments lying on the floor suddenly rose up and began to fit together.

[Oh, oh.]

The skull's jaw moved, and a voice was heard.

[But I didn't think it would actually work. Is it worth trying again?]

The jaw clicked. The skull looked at its own body with a sense of wonder, as if it was surprised. It seemed to be disappointed with the skeletal body it saw and hung its head in disappointment.

[It's just as I thought. It's all over. Not even rich, what a miserable end.]

"Hello?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san opened his mouth. At that moment, the skeleton seemed to notice Tae-san's existence and bumped its jaw.

"Ah, I'm sorry. I forgot the person who revived me. I'm really grateful. Really, I said."

The skeleton's voice was filled with a deep sense of urgency.

"Honestly, I thought I would be stuck in this predicament until the maze was cleared, so I did some foolish things."

The skeleton wore a tattered robe on its body, and held a staff that was worn down to a mere bone with a bone-hand.

"I was about to become a great magician. Ahki-sha. I'm glad to meet you. [You met a betrayed magician.]"

* * *

"Can you tell me how much time has passed since my death?"

"I don't know."

"Ah, I see..."

Ahki-sha bumped its jaw. It seemed to be moving its tongue. A ghost who had been standing still suddenly opened its mouth.

"Are you also an adventurer?" "I was too. Although I'm in this state now, I think you're similar to me." "Not similar. You're a kind of person I've never seen before."

The ghost was someone who had once gone down to the depths. If he didn't know, it would be one of two things.
Here is the translation of the text:

The existence before the ghost or the existence after the ghost, but they don't know when it was. There is no way to know the time in the labyrinth.

Akisha let out a strange noise and asked, "Do you know Mantecja?"

"...Who is he?" "[He's the one who hit me on the back of my head. And he's the one who entered the labyrinth with me.] [Is he with you too?]"

The ghost smiled slightly, as if he understood.

"I know. You're an adventurer from before me. You are..."

The skeleton changed its expression.

"What is he doing?" "[He's affiliated with the Sin Road Guide from the depths.] [The Sin Road Guide? What's that?] [It exists. He's living there with the name of the Great Mage.]"

Akisha's movement stopped due to the ghost's response.

He asked in a stiff tone, "Is that the name of the Great Mage?"

"Yes... [That's it]."

A cold laughter echoed.

"Yes. If I had killed you and taken everything, that would be enough. Yes. That's what it's like. Yes, it's delicious to kill you."
Here is the translation of the text:

Akhsha laughed merrily. Tae-san quickly understood the situation.

"Is it betrayal?"

[It's not a rare occurrence. In a labyrinth, adventurers often fight each other and gain a lot. The stronger one is, the more they gain. It's surprisingly common for someone to kill their comrades for their own power.]

[Yes, I went through the same thing.]

Akhsha spoke in a rough voice.

[I was the most outstanding mage in the Tower of Magic. The Tower's owner even told me that I could reach his level within ten years. And after fifty years, I could reach a realm that no one here could touch.]

Akhsha's anger simmered beneath the surface as he continued to speak.

[But I wasn't satisfied with that. No matter how outstanding, no matter how high a level I reached, I was still far inferior to countless transcendent beings and immortals. I wanted to be greater. Therefore, I couldn't rely on what I could get from the outside world.]

"Is that a labyrinth?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, this place is where the strong can achieve even greater heights. I've searched diligently. And I've finally arrived. But I didn't know it. Someone else was following me too."

"That's a mage."

"Yes."

Akisha nodded.

"He was undoubtedly talented. A talent that appears only once in a hundred years, and everyone loved him. Until I appeared, that is."

The one who had received everyone's attention, love, and trust lost everything in an instant to someone with greater talent than himself.

"I felt a bit sorry for it. But I thought that if I disappeared into the labyrinth, it would be okay, but instead, they chased after me from that side. I'll prove that I'm more talented than you, I said."

The ghost seemed to be interested in the story and urged him to continue. Akisha spoke hesitantly.

"I like it too much." [It's too interesting.] "I know about that thing's past, so it's not boring. Hmm... Well, there's nothing special about it. I went down to the labyrinth and he followed me. But his innate talent was useless. He always arrived late to the new level and was also slow to learn magic."
Here is the translation of the text:

I met someone with exceptional abilities that surpassed my own. I followed him to the most desolate places, but I couldn't surpass him.

Even ordinary people would have been tormented by it. And if someone couldn't bear it, they would have had a twisted heart.

[So, did you kill him? To get the power he had? Did that old man have a past like that?]

The ghost murmured with a hint of interest.

[And I used to say that there's no one who surpasses me with magic, and this is fun. I want to meet him again.]

[And what's with all that nonsense?]

Akiasha laughed with a sob. The low, muffled laughter was cut off abruptly.

[Are you an adventurer?]

Tae-san nodded. Akiasha's blue eyes burned with determination.

[I'm an adventurer. I was betrayed and buried here. I want to take revenge. Will you accept it?]

"I'll accept it."

Tae-san agreed immediately. It's only natural to fight against the guide who leads you down a path of sin. Since the enemy that will eventually fall to us is already set, receiving a quest won't be a problem.

As soon as Tae-san responded, Akiasha's face turned ambiguous.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Thanks for taking it easy on me... I can't just give you a quest easily. I don't know anything about you. Does that guy have a name, the Great Mage, or something?"

Is the mountain giant strong enough to take him down, or can he grow strong enough to do so?

Akisha needed to know that.

"Just being here proves your strength, but that's not enough."

Akisha shook her fingers, leaving only the pinky intact. A single magic circle appeared on the small room.

Wooo...

A small, golden slime burst out of it.

"This is the Golden Slime. It has physical and magical resistance. Even 50-floor adventurers find it hard to deal with. It's a monster that's hard to defeat."

This is the 45th floor. Considering that you become much stronger when you overcome a maze's theme, a normal 45th-floor adventurer wouldn't be able to defeat it.

"If you win against this, I'll give you the quest."

The slime flew towards Taesan with a loud thud.

It was quite fast.

Taesan drew his sword.

Whoosh!

The slime disintegrated and fell to the ground, twitching and convulsing as if it had received a big shock.

Taesan stepped on it and struck his sword.

"You have won against the Golden Slime."
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's no big deal."

[What?]

Akisha stumbled.

[Is this, is this that easy?]

A golden slime monster with physical and magical resistance.

In other words, if you can just break through it, it's a pretty simple monster. Akisha sighed and let out a sigh.

[This guy... is pretty strong, isn't he? There's no problem.]

* * *

[Sub-quest start] [The traitorous mage. Akisha wants to take revenge on the mage who betrayed him.] [Condition: The mage's death] [Reward: The most powerful and exceptional magic possessed by Akisha, as well as the equipment used by him.] [He said he had reached the depths. At that time, you will also become much stronger, but it will still be a significant reward. My magic is something that even the gods of magic cannot despise.]

Akisha proudly spoke and shook his finger. The power of magic was bestowed upon him by Taesan.

[And I'll give you this.] [You have obtained the special skill [Unbalanced Mana Barrier]. You can use it effectively against Mantecja.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The blue flames of the skull began to fade away.

[Then I... will sleep again. When you defeat that guy and complete the quest, I'll arrive by your side.]

After saying that, I destroyed the skull.

I couldn't feel Akisha's aura anymore. Tai Shan came out.

"Now, it's two of us."

The vengeful spirit seeking revenge against the Spirit King.

And the revenge against the sorcerer that the skull desired.

The commanding officers who needed to be defeated were now two.

"Are you also one? You're the one called Sosehit, aren't you?"

[...Yes, she is.]

The woman with a lantern. Sosehit, Gardentia.

She was said to be an old acquaintance of the spirit. However, it was Sosehit who had planned to kill him, not anyone else.

"It's too much."

Tai Shan muttered to himself and broke through the floor.

From then on, there was nothing unusual. The NPCs who gave quests did not appear, and the trials of the gods did not show up either.

Therefore, Tai Shan cleared the floor without any interference, organized the equipment that appeared, and delivered his emotions to Valencia.
As a result, he was able to arrive at the 48th floor.
