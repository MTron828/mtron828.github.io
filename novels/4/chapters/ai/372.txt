Chapter 373

373. The 77th Floor, the World on the Brink of Destruction (5)

The two cities were perfectly worshiping Taesan.

Then, the rulers of the other cities also became anxious. They didn't just sit back and do nothing. They had been monitoring Malbre's movements and had sent scouts ahead of time.

As a result, they were able to watch the one-sided battle between Taesan and Malbre.

Taesan single-handedly defeated the Red Flame God.

It meant that each of them was an unbeatable strongman.

They were terrified. They couldn't believe that someone with such power would just sit back and do nothing. They were convinced that Taesan would crush them and destroy their cities.

But they didn't want to surrender to Taesan either. They had no intention of giving up their positions as rulers of their cities.

So they made a decision.

They would form an alliance to take down Taesan, the tiger.

Purunbit Isul, Musin, and Kalayat combined their powers.

With their combined strength, they moved towards the city that the Red Flame God had ruled.

"......I heard the story, but it was real."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

As they arrived in the city of Taesan, their faces scrunched up. The city was extremely lively. The people's faces were flushed, and their dwellings seemed extremely sturdy.

"Let's go."

They entered the city, and the city's people trembled with fear as they saw them.

"What?"

"What's going on?"

As the leaders and officials of the three groups entered simultaneously, the people were overwhelmed with anxiety.

They enjoyed the fearful glances of the people as they searched for Taesan.

"Are you the one who defeated Malbre?"

The owner of the Blue Frost said to Taesan with arrogance.

They surrounded Taesan as if to encircle him.

"I'll make you a proposal. Let's join hands."

The owner of the Blue Frost said confidently.

Taesan already knew that he was strong.

But they themselves were not weak either. They thought that if the three groups combined their powers, they could inflict significant damage. So, they proposed an alliance.

"The two cities you rule are yours. We acknowledge that. So, don't interfere with our city."

They believed that Taesan would not reject their proposal. They thought they had enough power to back it up.

Taesan responded.

"What if I refuse?"

"……."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The man's face distorted.

"Then, it's unfortunate, but there's no choice. Kill him!"

A loud noise erupted. The executives of each group smashed the building and rushed towards Taesan at the same time.

Taesan gazed at them with a blank expression.

The people who were watching Taesan's building with anxious faces screamed and ducked down at the loud noise. When they looked up, they saw Taesan and the other group engaging in battle.

"Die!"

The owner of Calleart shouted and unleashed his power.

At the same time, an invisible force struck Taesan, pushing his body backward.

"Hahaha!"

He burst into laughter and swung his hand wildly. The invisible force continued to press down on Taesan.

'Is this power similar to electromagnetism?'

The invisible, formless power. It wasn't magic, nor was it black magic. There was no precursor to the power, and it was difficult to read where the power was being generated.

It was a very unique power. Not only Calleart, but his executives were also exhibiting similar powers.

"Crush him!"

Following the owner's command, the executives simultaneously struck down with their hands.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan's body fell to the ground. The earth couldn't withstand the pressure and cracked, collapsing.

"This is fun."

It was a remarkably unique power. There was a thrill in watching it.

The master of the blue light also used his power.

In an instant, a water sphere enveloped Taesan's face.

His vision was obscured by the water, and his breathing was blocked. Taesan shook his head to get rid of it, but the water sphere was created again.

That wasn't all. A water pillar and wall formed around Taesan, trying to restrict his movements.

The master of the martial god also moved. He was extremely fast and powerful. His swordsmanship was sharp, and his movements were efficient.

But it wasn't his own power. Taesan, who was observing him calmly, realized that something was attached to his entire body, forcing him to make efficient movements.

The other executives also had unique powers. As Taesan watched them, he could understand the reason.

There wasn't just one god who scattered divinity in this world.

Several gods had descended their divinity to protect this world. It seemed that depending on whose divinity one obtained, they would gain different abilities.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If I were to attain divinity, what kind of power would I gain?"

I wondered anew. Although it's impossible now, if I were to achieve perfect divinity in the future, I might be able to wield it like that.

"Ah, ah, ah!"

The onlookers let out a despairing cry.

From their perspective, Taesan was unable to withstand the attack and was being pushed back continuously.

They closed their eyes and desperately prayed.

The owner of Calleiat revealed his true intentions.

"I can win!"

Despite having no experience in merging with other groups, they were perfectly in sync. A sense of superiority, as if they had seen a higher world, dominated him.

They pressed Taesan even harder and faster.

The power of the void suddenly grasped Taesan tightly. The owner of Calleiat shouted.

"Kill!"

They charged forward as if they had found an opportunity. The owner of Calleiat also drew his void sword and rushed forward.

Taesan nodded his head.

"It's sufficient."

They were quite strong.

From his perspective, they were handling a power that was almost perfect, as if it were trash.

He must have desperately worked hard.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I must have overcome the hardships that gnawed at my bones. I must have won many battles, risking my life, and sometimes leaving everything to fate.

It was a power that couldn't be obtained otherwise. Although they were ruthless tyrants, their efforts and struggles hidden in their movements were real.

But overwhelming power was a law that crushed everything.

As the enemies approached, Taesan snapped his fingers.

[You activated Marbas's dark wave.]

In an instant, darkness enveloped them.

* * *

"What?"

The owner of Calleiat opened his eyes.

"What, what?"

He slowly got up, looking around in a daze.

Everything around him was destroyed.

"Everyone..."

There was no one. His trusted subordinates, who had believed in him and followed him, had vanished into thin air. The only ones left were himself and the owner of the blue-green mist, who had a similarly dazed expression.

"What, what... how did this happen?"

His voice trembled.

"I was alive?"

"I didn't know I could survive even if the passage wasn't open. You're more useful than I thought."

Taesan was looking at him with a calm face.

It was only after seeing that face that Calleiat remembered."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He grasped his own power, and they judged it as an opportunity. Everyone rushed in at once. He also raised his sword, intending to pierce Taesan's chest.

Just as he was about to reach him, the opponent lightly flicked his hand.

At that moment, darkness was realized.

The owner of Calleiat, who saw the darkness, felt a chill run down his spine. Frightened, he covered his entire body with his sword's power.

And then he lost consciousness.

When he regained his senses, everything was already shrouded in darkness.

"...What's going on!"

He wildly swung his hand, pouring out all his remaining strength.

Taesan didn't dodge or block it.

He simply lightly flicked his finger.

And with that, his power was cancelled out.

"......"

"It's okay, I'll make it easy for you."

Taesan took a step forward.

He, frightened, wildly unleashed his power.

But his power, which collided with Taesan's body, vanished without a trace.

He couldn't withstand it and tried to flee, but his body wouldn't move.

"Move! Move, I say!"

"You can't move in that state."

"Huh? Huh?"

The owner of Calleiat, who had been struggling for a while, belatedly realized that his body couldn't move."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His other half was buried in darkness, and his senses were disappearing.

It wasn't just him; the owners of the other surviving groups were the same. They were all dying.

"Aaaaah...."

Only then did he realize.

The enemy wasn't unable to respond to their attacks. They were simply not worth responding to.

He had been mistaken, thinking he could win without even knowing that.

He no longer resisted.

Taesan easily finished them off.

"Oh, ohohoh!"

The people who finally understood the situation cheered. They wailed and praised Taesan.

"Our savior!"

The monsters who had oppressed them, treating them like toys, were now powerless and dying under Taesan's hand.

The groups that had terrorized people with fear were all annihilated.

People shouted Taesan's name.

"Oh!"

"Our god!"

There was no one left to call Taesan a messenger of God. Nor was there anyone to call him a savior.

They called Taesan a god.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They believed that the god who had descended to this earth to save them was themselves.

The Great Mountain, who had finished his preparations, moved.

Many people followed him.

He moved to the remaining city, where he cultivated food through simple farming and built shelters.

At first, people doubted the Great Mountain, but as those who followed him showed enthusiastic faith, and since the Great Mountain didn't ask for anything, people began to worship him in no time.

Now, more than half of the people who had survived in this world were worshiping the Great Mountain.

"Hmm?"

At that moment, the Great Mountain felt it.

A change had occurred in the faith that was pouring into him.

"What's this?"

He couldn't put it into words. But something had changed - was it influence, or presence? Something was different.

He still couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was.

He would know after resolving the issues in the remaining two cities.

The Great Mountain resolved the problems in the remaining two cities as well, cultivating food and building shelters.

Now, all the people in the five cities worshiped the Great Mountain.

All the survivors worshiped the Great Mountain as a god.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Huh?"

At the same time, Taesan could feel it. The faith gathering around him had changed in quality.

[You have acquired the rightful qualification. You have obtained the concept skill [Master of Faith].] [Your proficiency in Divine Power has increased by 3%.]

* * *

"Hmm?"

Minerva's eyes, which had been moving beside Taesan, widened. The ghost also stopped in its tracks.

"Master?"

[Uh... you've changed somehow?]

The two of them were about to speak when Taesan also realized it.

A strange sensation was dominating his entire body. It was an extremely unfamiliar and amazing feeling that he had never experienced before.

"Suddenly, I feel like you're really far away?"

Minerva muttered with a dazed expression. It was literally true. Suddenly, she felt a sense of distance from Taesan. He was clearly right next to her, but it felt like he was in a different dimension.

"......"

Taesan opened his skill window.

[Concept Skill: Master of Faith] [Proficiency: 1%] [One who is revered by all in the world.]

The description was extremely simple. Taesan raised his hand, manifesting his will.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

At that moment, the flow of air changed.

Even Minerva, the spirit queen, could only purify a region the size of a city due to the pollution that had engulfed the earth.

The fact that even she had a limit meant that this planet was that polluted.

"Uh..."

Minerva was shocked.

The air was being purified.

The pollution caused by the gods was disappearing, and numerous plants were turning green along with the air.

People realized that they could breathe much more easily than before.

"......What's going on?"

The purification itself wasn't that remarkable. Even a small region like a mountain could be purified if it had influence over nature.

But it wasn't just the city that was purified now.

The purified air was spreading beyond the city and covering the entire world.

Taesan realized.

That he had become the god of this planet.
