Chapter 291

291. Projection of Will (2)

Of course, it wasn't a proper reward.

Even if there was a time limit for scattering one's will, it was possible to avoid the direct attack of the star, but the star had already become aware of the Mountain God.

If one stayed for a certain period of time, one would try to kill the Mountain God, no matter what it took, even if it meant destroying the planet. The only thing one could take was the materials obtained previously.

It was a reward that could be understood to some extent.

However, the reward that couldn't be obtained originally remained unchanged.

The Mountain God had taken all the materials he could from the ruins. When he came out, the world was in chaos.

The wave of power filled with frustration and anger was growing stronger.

"It's time to settle things."

Even if it wasn't, the headache was getting worse. It was almost time to finish.

When the frustration with the insects reached its peak, one would want to destroy the entire house and kill them all.

This was the limit.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan moved. He headed towards the destination of the quest. He descended to the deepest part of the world and found a transparent-colored spring sealed within.

[The Essence of Innocence] [A liquid that existed from the beginning of the stars. This substance was complete in itself from the moment it was born.]

Tai Shan took the liquid.

The quest conditions were fulfilled, but Tai Shan did not immediately return.

Tai Shan gazed at the land. A ghost asked:

[What are you doing?]

"You can't feel it, can you?"

The immense will that had been felt since stepping into the fallen world of Half-ran. It was only now, at this moment when the proficiency of the conceptual skill had reached 60%, that it could be felt.

It was strong enough to be felt from afar. The will emanating from it was wrapping around the world.

And it was being felt right below.

"If you are the master of the will that wraps around the world, you must be the star itself."

[Is that... likely?]

The ghost's voice trailed off. Tai Shan thought for a moment before making a decision.

[You have triggered the earthquake.]

The cave floor collapsed.
Here is the translation of the text:

Everything was crumbling, and the body of the mountain began to fall. There was nothing beneath the collapsed cave, only a deep and vast underground chamber.

[You have activated the anchoring.]

How far had it fallen? After a few seconds of falling, the mountain reached the bottom.

It was a passageway of darkness.

Even the mountain, which transcended human categories, could not see anything in front of it due to the darkness.

[You have activated the blazing furnace.]

However, using magic to create light, the passageway was still dark. This darkness seemed to have existed even before light existed, and it was as if it was devouring light.

And at the end of the passageway, a massive something was felt.

[Uh... danger... no way...]

The ghost seemed to have just noticed it and swallowed its saliva.

[What are you going to do? I recommend going back right away.]

"We've come this far."

Since we've come this far, shouldn't we take a look at what's ahead?

The mountain walked through the passageway of darkness.

And at the end of the passageway, a vast plaza appeared.

There was a pure-white sphere there.

A sphere that emitted a light similar to the sun. From there, one could feel the will and power of the entire planet.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is the core of the star that aims to destroy the world of Half-Ran and kill the Great Mountain."

[You have met the world.] [This is......]

A ghostly sigh was whispered.

The Great Mountain arrived at the square, and a massive beam of energy targeted the Great Mountain.

The gaze was unlike anything before, accurately perceiving the Great Mountain.

It was probably not a feeling detected by intention, but rather a direct observation.

The gaze contained extreme anger, fury, and hatred.

Dare.

It was said. Not a language, but a pure intention pierced the Great Mountain's mind.

Dare. Within my domain.

The star declared.

Die.

The declaration with intention echoed.

[Immediate judgment... ] [Judgment failure!] [The declaration of death is overwhelming.]

This is a declaration of death that defies the judgment itself, like a god.

[Ah......]

The ghost was shocked. The declaration of death touched the Great Mountain's neck.

[You have activated mental acceleration.]

The Great Mountain focused its intention. It gathered the scattered intention and spread it throughout its body, declaring:

"Go away."

This is a declaration of negation.

A declaration with absolute intention, just like the world, having an impact on the world.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The declaration of negation is activated.] [The immediate declaration disappears.] [You have declared your own will, which has had an impact on the world. You have obtained the special permanent activation skill [Command].]

Death, which had been stroking your back, is leaving. The Great Mountain has drawn its sword.

[The opponent is an enemy who cannot be defeated.]

It is an enemy who cannot be defeated. It's only natural that the world itself would be like that. It was nothing to be concerned about.

But the events that followed were unexpected.

The system window began to distort slowly.

[The opponent is @!xx$@ @#!.]

System failure.

It was the first time since the Great Mountain faced off against the demon.

[You have activated the apostolic [Darkness and Chaos].] [You have activated the vessel of the king.] [The desire for battle has been activated.] [You have activated the scorn of the strong.] [Heretical thoughts have been activated.] [The giant killer has been activated.] [The one who opposes the great will has been activated.]

A strong sense of annoyance gazed at the Great Mountain.

The power contained in the body came together.

The energy that had spread throughout the world began to concentrate.

Die.

Along with the declaration, white energy is shot at the Great Mountain.
Here is the translation of the text:

This is the power of the star itself. The power that had been targeting Taesan until now was at best local, a mere fraction of the world's power. Therefore, Taesan was able to withstand it.

However, this is the origin of the power possessed by the world itself.

As the manifestation of power alone causes everything around it to distort and lose its form, it begins to lose its shape.

Snap.

[Your first attack is completely invalidated.] [Your second attack is completely invalidated.]

[Your third attack is completely invalidated.] [You take 1230 damage.] [You take 1101 damage.] [You take 1023 damage.]

There is an absolute shield that resists the power of the intangible, but it's of no use. The absolute shield is a skill that blocks the opponent's attack in proportion to Taesan's stats. The enemy in front of us has a power that cannot be blocked by stats of that level.

Wooooo!

The world itself is about to crush Taesan.

Despite being able to withstand it, Taesan has already resigned itself to death.

Time slows down, and mental acceleration is achieved.

Can it be blocked?

Magic is futile. While intermediate magic is certainly powerful, it is still a power meant for mortals. That power transcends its category. Even time delay is impossible.
Here is the translation of the text:

The black magic is not much different. Once you put all the magic into the channel, you can delay time for a while, but that's the limit.

You need time to open the channel, so a tremendous power will strike you before the black magic is activated.

The sword technique is also futile. It's not a power that can be activated like that.

The power that's covering the Tai Shan is the power of the world itself.

It's transcendent, surpassing the mortal realm. The existence that transcended the mortal realm was manifesting its power to kill Tai Shan.

So, what's needed is a power that transcends the mortal realm, even higher than that.

The light is in Tai Shan's grasp. It's divine.

And it's being shrouded in black. It's the power of the gods.

The mixed power creates something with a grayish hue.

Tai Shan wielded it as it was.

The white power and gray power clashed.

*Kuku kuku kuku*...

The space is collapsing. Everything is distorted and losing its shape.

Only darkness was consuming everything around it.

And Tai Shan was lying down in the collapsed space.
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have taken 49532 points of damage. You blocked the attack from @!xx$@ and obtained the special skill "Last Chance". You have gained a fragment of willpower.]

The damage from the single attack was enough to cripple a mountain.

However, the mountain laughed.

The attack just now was just a kind of instant death blow, meaningless damage.

It was a damage that was reduced to a level that couldn't even activate a skill to withstand, let alone block it.

"It's fine."

The mountain shook off the shock and stood up.

The white sphere was still at the same height as before.

However, the tip of the sphere had changed to a slightly grayish color, barely noticeable to the naked eye.

No damage gauge appeared. It meant that there was no significant injury.

However, his power had created a tiny flaw on the immortal being. He was satisfied with that.

And the world seemed to be enraged, thinking that this was not at all what it wanted.

The emotional energy had begun to affect reality. It was as if he could do this kind of thing at any time, and the power to attack the mountain in an instant had accumulated.

"Let's see what happens next."
Here is the translation of the text:

Taisan muttered to himself and pulled out a bead.

As he did so, a force shot towards Taisan, and his physical body moved to a mysterious place.

"I want to say I'm back safely, but it's impossible," he said.

Hafren's face was filled with wonder and astonishment.

"What just happened?" he asked.

Hafren seemed to have sensed the power beyond the space. Taisan opened his mouth and took a potion.

"It's the core of the world. Did you know?"

Taisan said. The deepest place that Hafren had requested as a quest. Below it was a space that contained the will of the world itself, and when he fell down there, he saw a massive orb that contained the world's will.

Taisan's words widened Hafren's eyes.

"Is that... true?"

"I didn't know. I knew the world was trying to kill us, but I didn't think there was something like that gathering the will... not just me, but no one from my world knew."

It was not strange. Taisan's skills were not yet refined enough to notice, so he couldn't have noticed. Hafren's gaze at Taisan was filled with astonishment.
Here is the translation of the text:

"So, you're saying you've faced the world itself and returned, right?"

"That's how it'll be."

"How?"

That was a question.

"What's the point of surviving like that?"

It's not something that can be said to someone who has come back to life, but it's also a valid question.

Tae-san was undoubtedly strong. However, his strength was only on the level of a mortal.

Even if Tae-san had powers that didn't fit him, it didn't change anything.

And the opponent was the world itself.

A being that transcended mortality, of a kind.

It's impossible to counterattack. The gap between them was so huge that it was impossible to win just by sending a glance.

However, Tae-san had come back to life. It was in a state without any unusual circumstances.

"There's one card that can be played against someone like that, you know."

The power of gray. Even the gods would tremble with envy, and look at transcendent beings with disdain.

If that exists, at least I won't die, I thought, and approached the world.

After a moment, a half-human's eyes lit up.

"No matter what, it's a good thing that's happened. Pure water has been brought. Take it. I'll create what you want."

"Okay."
Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan handed over the pure water of innocence. And he opened the inventory.

The materials from the world that had been destroyed by the superior water fell apart.

The eyes of Halfdan, who had stopped at the numerous materials, lit up.

"...What is this?"

"What kind of equipment can we make with these materials?"

Tai Shan asked.

*

"Ah."

Halfdan, who had been staring blankly at the materials, smiled wryly and turned his gaze to Tai Shan.

"This isn't a quest to collect these things, right?"

"I brought them along anyway."

"That's fun. It's not bad......"

Halfdan's eyes sparkled as he muttered to himself.

"If this is the case, I can make something a bit more useful."

After pondering, he made a decision.

"I'll use the materials given by the Giant King and make one equipment using all of these. Is that okay?"

Tai Shan nodded his head. Soon, he disappeared into the depths. It was meaningless to make multiple equipment.

Halfdan smiled happily and gathered the materials.

"Alright. Come back later. I'll make something really useful for you."

Here is the translation of the text:

"Before I ask, I want to know one thing. If you're a thing from that world, can you make a higher-level equipment?"

"Yes. I was a resident of that world. The things born and raised there are things I can handle best."

Half-ran said confidently. Taesan opened his inventory. There was still one material he had not given him.

"Can I use this as material too?"

[The Edge of Desire] [The Will of the World. Its tiny and insignificant remnants.]

A faint, white haze appeared.

Half-ran hesitated.

He looked at the haze with a vacant gaze and suddenly smiled.

"You're... really making me surprised again."

"Possible?"

Taesan was also taken aback. Half-ran was clearly exceptional. Just looking at the ring he had made could tell.

However, what he showed now was the will of the world. A power that transcended mortal bounds. Even Half-ran, who was exceptional, couldn't handle it.

Half-ran shook his head.

"That's something I can't handle either. When I made your ring, the materials I used were clearly exceptional, but it was within my limits. The fundamental light was ultimately a material without self-awareness."

Here is the translation of the text:

Halfalan looked at the fragment of his will and said:

"But that's different. That's a being that has transcended mortality. It has its own will. If I try to deal with it, the remaining fragment of my will will surely swallow me up."

"I'm sorry to say so."

Then there was no place to use it. As I was thinking of offering it to the gods as a trading object, Halfalan spoke up.

"But I know someone who can handle it."

He opened his mouth with a ambiguous expression.

"A master craftsman who has taken up residence at the entrance of the depths. A madman who pursues something beyond mortal bodies. The short-lived Dwarf's Course Run. You can handle what you have in your possession."
