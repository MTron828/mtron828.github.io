Episode 266

266. Special Skill Activation: Absolute Judgment (3)

[Special Skill: Absolute Judgment] [Mana Consumption: 10] [After activation, the next attack ignores the opponent's defense and penetrates all defensive skills and measures. However, if the attack is cancelled, it will not activate.]

[…] He let out a dry laugh.

"What's this?"

"Take a closer look."

Taesan immediately moved to the next room.

Last clone. Taesan swung his sword while unarmed.

[You activated Absolute Judgment.] [Dealt 103 damage to the timid clone with its eyes closed.]

Zhajijik.

The clone's skin changed after being attacked. Taesan swung his sword again.

[You activated Absolute Judgment.] [Dealt 99 damage to the timid clone with its eyes closed.]

This time, Taesan didn't respond at all. He didn't attack the weakness of the changed skin, but simply swung his sword normally.

Yet, similar damage was inflicted as before.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The mountain range activated its absolute judgment and continued to pressure the mutated body. The mutated body continued to change its pattern to respond, but the damage did not decrease.

Woong.

The mutated body changed its pattern again. A blue barrier formed around it. The mountain range struck down with its sword.

[You have activated your absolute judgment.]

The sword, which easily destroyed the barrier without any resistance, pierced through the mutated body.

[This is unbelievable.]

The ghost muttered. I thought that I wouldn't be surprised by any unexpected events after being with the mountain range for so long. But that thought was shattered.

In the labyrinth, defense was one of the most important abilities. Outside, even the strongest person could die from something trivial.

The strongest person in the world could die from a mosquito bite, and a mercenary who had survived countless battles could die on the battlefield from a blind sword attack.

Endurance and defense were abilities that prevented such unexpected deaths. Moreover, they allowed one to advance safely in situations where they had to risk their lives."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"No matter how dangerous the trap is, if you have enough strength, you can push through it with your body. If your defense surpasses your attack power, you'll only take 1 point of damage.

That's why adventurers in the labyrinth invest a lot of time and gold into increasing their defense.

And the skill Taesan has obtained now is something that renders all that effort and time meaningless.

[Is it not only ignoring defense, but also ignoring defense skills and measures? Are you kidding me? Can you even break through this solid defense?]

Taesan nodded. The ghost couldn't help but burst out laughing.

[What is this.]

The solid defense that reduces all incoming damage by half. That too was meaningless in front of Taesan. The ghost let out a sigh.

[This is ridiculous. This guy could be the perfect nemesis for that guy.]

"That guy?"

[Yes. One of the high-ranking officials. The one who boasts the highest defense. That's why even other high-ranking officials can't touch him. But he's no match for you, it seems.] [Ignoring all defense? Can something like that even be obtained in the labyrinth?]

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"Barkaja was also unable to withstand the shock. Among the spirits, there were those who poured all their energy into defense to protect their master, surpassing even Barkaja. But their power was meaningless in front of Taesan.

[What's with the consumption value of 10? It's ridiculously low. Haha, I can't help but laugh.]

Quadduk.

Taesan struck down the transformed body.

He smiled.

The skill that made him invincible, the one that allowed him to be called the strongest, had been reactivated.

"Good."

Taesan swung his sword and advanced.

The boss of the 59th floor was a black transformed body, larger and harder than any they had seen before.

But to Taesan, it was nothing.

[You have activated Absolute Judgment.]

Quadduk.

The sword shattered the transformed body's flesh.

The transformed body tried to counterattack, but all its efforts were futile against Absolute Judgment. It collapsed in just one minute.

"Status window."

[Gang Taesan] [Level: 120] [Shield: 3899/3899] [Health: 40820/40820] [Mana: 3780/3780] [Magic: 653/653] [Strength: 8461] [Intelligence: 7261] [Agility: 7815] [Attack power + 2745] [Defense + 1622] [The target is in the best state.]"

This appears to be a passage from a fantasy novel or game, with a protagonist named Taesan who possesses impressive skills and abilities, including the powerful "Absolute Judgment" skill.

Here is the translation of the text from Korean to English:

"Itaen cleared the labyrinth and came out with stats like this.

I reached that place. I'll definitely be able to reach the bottom if I go deeper. The ghost murmured.

[The stats are ridiculously high.]

It was due to the level up. Every time I defeated the enemy, I took their stats and showed a more than double increase.

Stats aren't everything in the labyrinth, but they're the basics. The higher they are, the more advantageous they are for the capture.

"Are you higher than me?"

[No? Am I lower than when I died?]

"Yes?"

It seemed that the higher you go, the higher the level up. I thought so and smiled.

Itaen, who had been attacking alone until the end, didn't have a big difference in stats with the current him.

[With this much stats, I'll be able to handle the equipment of the guys in the deep. The leaders will also have a headache.]

The ghost chuckled.

Taesan, who defeated the boss, returned to the labyrinth and found the secret room. He captured the place and got the reward.

He organized the rewards he had earned."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

**[Belt of Painful Echoes]** [+20 Black Magic] [+100 Intelligence] [+150 Defense] [A belt created by a skilled black magician who imprisoned the screams of the demons he tortured. If you listen closely, you can hear the screams of the demons from that time.]

It was a terrible description, but the effect was useful. Any equipment that increased black magic abilities was welcome.

And there was more than one.

**[Necklace of the Lich in the Western Forest]** [+40 Black Magic] [+200 Intelligence] [A necklace that a lich, who ruled the forest, received as a gift from someone before losing its humanity. The lich couldn't bear to part with it even after losing its humanity.]

This was also a good piece of equipment. The black magic boost was significant, likely due to it being a necklace.

With this, the power of black magic would surely increase significantly.

**[The Trumpet of the Advancing Army]** [A trumpet for advancing into battle. When blown during combat, the morale of allies increases.]

A trumpet for use in group battles. It couldn't be used for now, but it would come in handy after returning to the earth. All in all, they were useful equipment.

"Then."

Taesan went down the stairs.

**[60th Floor Quest Begins.]** [Defeat the boss of the 60th floor and clear the floor.] [Reward: Soil of the Black Land.] [Secret Reward: ???]

60th floor.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a place where the theme of mysterious beings appeared to end.

The next theme was finally the last one that delved deep.

"I've finally arrived near."

The place that had seemed so far away was now right in front of him.

Taesan strengthened his legs and went down the stairs, and the shop owner was waiting for him at the entrance of the floor as usual.

"I'm here."

He said calmly, but his eyes were filled with undeniable longing.

"I've finally made it this far. There's not much left now."

"That's right."

"Yes, there's not much left. Until the day you reach that place...…."

He muttered to himself, his eyes filled with longing.

After composing himself, he opened his mouth.

"Do you have anything to say?"

"No."

Taesan shook his head. Even if he was alive, it wasn't now. He would gather money until he reached the depths.

"Then go down. Go down and reach that place."

The shop owner revealed his teeth.

Taesan left him behind and headed towards the passageway.

What was the shop owner hoping for?

The system window that appeared when he met the shop owner called him the "Lost King".

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He must have entered the labyrinth to retrieve what he had lost.

It was likely to be in the depths.

Taesan encountered a 60th-floor monster.

The last monster of the mystery was Imugi.

The enormous Imugi, which filled the room, rushed to devour Taesan.

Taesan drew his sword.

* * *

Imugi was strong.

Although it had a massive body, its speed was faster than any monster Taesan had seen before. It was a strength that would require anyone who had made it this far to fight with the resolve to face death.

[Sha!]

Imugi violently shook its body and opened its jaws. Taesan extended his arm, and the golden sword was in his hand.

[You have activated the golden sword of Nebarius.]

He drew a straight line.

The golden line slashed Imugi as it rushed in. Imugi fell with a loud crash.

Taesan repeated opening and closing his fist. It was a bit difficult to use because it was a mid-level black magic, but he needed to get used to it with repeated practice.

He cleared the 60th floor without any problems."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"The Umki was clearly strong, but Taesan had already reached the mid-level of the labyrinth.

A regular monster on the 60th floor couldn't threaten him.

He knocked them down one by one and advanced.

And his speed was noticeably slow.

[Why are you going so slow?]

"I need to prepare too."

[……Ah.]

The ghost realized what Taesan meant and shut his mouth. Barcaraja asked in a trembling tone.

[Master, I sense a strong power ahead. And... it seems to be an existence close to me.]

"Maybe it's true."

Taesan broke through the labyrinth.

The community's invitation to him had been noisy until now, but he had no intention of chatting. His mind was fierce, so he turned off the notification.

Taesan arrived at the secret room, broke through the trap, and obtained the reward.

The reward was a window frame. Although its attack power was decent, it wasn't a weapon Taesan, who used dual swords, would use. He put it in his inventory and continued to break through the labyrinth.

He cleared the monsters and arrived at the boss room.

[Shaah...]. [The Umki, who couldn't become a dragon, appeared.]"

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"It had smooth and magnificent scales unlike any of the monsters it had met so far. Its face had changed a bit, and it looked similar to the dragon Taesan had met.

What's more, unlike any of the monsters it had met so far, it used magic.

Quaaaang!

Taesan strikes down his sword at the rushing Agari. The monster crashes to the floor with a loud noise.

Taesan destroys all the magic that appears in the air and thrusts his sword deep into the monster's body.

[Kyaaah!]

The monster starts screaming and thrashing about.

Taesan calmly deals with the monster.

Before long, the monster collapses with a scream.

Taesan sheathes his sword. The system window appears with a flourish.

Rewards for clearing the 60th floor. He wanted to check each one, but there was no time.

Taesan turns his gaze to the stairs.

Thud. Thud.

As they approach the stairs, they come into view.

One of them is a knight-like existence wearing solid armor and holding a large shield in one hand and a sword in the other, emitting a faint light."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

And the remaining one was a being that held a quietly flickering flame. The flame didn't blaze fiercely or violently, but it contained a power and dignity that could be felt just by its presence.

There were only two of them.

Taesan looked around.

"No matter how I look at it, they're not guides of the 6th level. Who are they?"

[We killed all of them. They're worthless.]

The being with the sword spoke calmly.

"That's right?"

Taesan gazed at the two.

"So, you're the last ones."

The last guardians who blocked the path to the depths, meeting the leaders.

The two opened their mouths.

[I am the great fire spirit king, Vishnu's shield.] [I am the great fire spirit king, Vishnu's spear.]

The power surged, and a fierce energy burst into the room.

[Come, dare to oppose the king. Meet your death under our power.]
