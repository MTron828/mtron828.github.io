**Chapter 405**

405. 81st Floor, Advanced Magic (5)

Weirard realized it. Taesan was determined to win this time, thinking of fighting him with all his might.

"Let's start then."

According to the rules of the God of Magic, most of his powers were sealed, excluding magic. Weirard's staff moved. A black dot was drawn in the air, and soon a line was formed, pouring towards Taesan.

It was a perfect control of space, leaving no room for evasion.

Taesan responded by manifesting his magic.

[You have activated Starlight Arrow.] [You have activated Magic Concentration.]

The Starlight Arrow was compressed and shot towards the black line. Although it couldn't withstand the attack and was crushed, it managed to change its trajectory, creating a space for Taesan to dodge.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

Taesan dodged Weirard's attack without a single hit, countering with just one magic spell.

Weirard didn't get flustered. Instead, he laughed joyfully and swung his staff.

Ki-ying!

Dozens of black dots were drawn in the air.

Like a divine punishment, hundreds of lines descended upon the ground. Taesan moved his body.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He wields magic. He warps space to create space, and uses random blinks to gain distance. He then overlaps his magic to block the incoming black lines.

The wizard at the tip of the staff created a black dot and drew a large semicircle.

"Go."

Kugugung!

The semicircular surface burst out of the circle and roughly grasped the space.

Taesan raised his hand.

[You have activated magic overlap.] [You have activated warping.]

The overlapped warping is activated. The moment the semicircular surface touches the warped space, it begins to distort.

And Taesan didn't miss that moment.

[You have activated forced exclusion.] [You have activated magic concentration.] [You have activated magic acceleration.]

Kuuung!

The power of exclusion is concentrated towards the warped space. The surface creaks and stops its charge.

[You have activated warping.] [You have activated magic explosion.]

There, Taesan activated warping again and exploded the space. The charging surface shattered, creating an opening to dodge. Taesan lightly moved his body to avoid the attack.

The wizard revealed this and swung his staff.

The black lines filled the space, but didn't reach Taesan."

Let me know if you have any further requests!

"Fire and ice cover the world. The perfect use of magic resists Wira's power.

[Your magic proficiency has increased by 1%.] [[You have obtained Magic Circle.]] [[You have obtained Magic Interference.]] [[You have obtained Memorize.]]

The battle with Wira is only possible with magic.

As a result of continuously increasing magic proficiency, it has finally reached 80%.

[You have activated the Frozen World.]

Whoa!

The Frozen World has been activated. The power contained within is of a different dimension from what we've seen so far. It freezes everything and dominates space.

Wira holds his staff. Countless black lines that have appeared shatter the Frozen World.

"Well done."

Wira showed pure admiration.

Taesan had almost perfectly grasped his behavior pattern and power strategy.

As a result, even though the battle had been going on for a long time, he didn't receive any damage.

Of course, as an immortal, he had lived for a very long time as a wizard. There were still many patterns he hadn't shown yet."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, there was a fundamental principle underlying all patterns and behaviors. Taesan had already grasped it. No matter how hard Wiraed pressed, he wouldn't fall easily.

"But that's not all."

He wouldn't fall easily.

That was the limit.

Wiraed's staff moved, and the black threads poured out simultaneously.

Taesan responded by manifesting his magic.

The power of the magic, which had reached 80% proficiency, was undoubtedly strong. The other wizards watching couldn't help but wonder if this was really the magic they had learned.

Kugugugung!

But he couldn't pierce the black threads.

Although it was easier to neutralize than before, and the power had increased, he still couldn't break through.

"I have reached the realm of immortality with only this magic."

Wiraed muttered to himself.

"Unless it's your true power, magic alone can't reach me."

Kugugugung......

The black threads were densely packed around Taesan. If Wiraed wanted to, he could separate the threads and pierce Taesan's entire body.

"Now, what should I do?"

There was no chance of winning.

And Taesan knew that too.

"I never thought I could win from the start."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Everything he had done so far was a stepping stone to victory.

Taesan gazed at Wylard among the black lines.

"Your power. Dimensional definition. A magic that manipulates points, lines, and surfaces. I was curious about how you controlled it, but it's simpler than I thought."

"What is it?"

"The balance of power caused by the conflict between the outside and the inside."

Wylard smiled faintly.

"That's correct."

The basic unit of Wylard's magic was a small point.

A very difficult magic that compressed powerful energy without leaking any power waves.

The method of creating it was simple.

"Extreme mana compression."

Compressing mana and compressing it again to create a small point shape.

It doesn't do anything on its own. The compressed power is uncontrolled and explodes immediately. Taesan realized this through several experiments.

So, he also applied mana to the outside.

Compressing the same amount of mana as the compressed mana, and wrapping the compressed mana.

"But I don't know how to do it."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I've grasped the theory, but no matter how many times I tried, I failed. Even if I compress the compressed mana again, it doesn't achieve the balance of opposing forces like Wira's. The doubly compressed mana just ends up exploding.

Perhaps only Wira can utilize mana in a way that makes it possible.

"So, what should I do? Are you thinking of experimenting to steal my magic? I won't stop you. If you spend around a hundred years here, you might be able to achieve a slight possibility."

"No."

Taesan shook his head.

"I can't do that."

Wira is a genius.

He has an unparalleled talent that surpasses Taesan's, having devoted himself to a single magic for decades, or perhaps even centuries.

"I'm not a magician from the start. I don't have the intention or talent to invest time in a single magic. It's too bothersome."

He is an adventurer.

One who obtains all available power and utilizes it to fit himself.

"So, I'll just take the advantages."

The principle of Wira's magic lies in the balance of opposing forces between the outside and inside.

It's not necessary to only handle it with mana."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A dark power flowed out from Taesan's hand. Before Taesan could do anything, Wiraed, who was about to attack, stopped his staff.

'...That is.'

Wiraed was an immortal.

He possessed a power worthy of his name, and his body was blessed by the God of Magic. He had saved the world from destruction several times, following the orders of Zelvand.

Wiraed had defeated monsters and saved multiple worlds.

That's why he could understand what kind of power Taesan was wielding now.

'Is that the power of Gosin?'

Taesan was now controlling the power of Gosin, which was not permitted to exist in this world.

'Most skills, excluding magic, were forbidden, but this doesn't apply to that.'

The reason was not hard to guess. The power of Gosin was a power that transcended the laws. Zelvand's rules did not apply to it.

Taesan, who had become an immortal, was able to manipulate black magic to some extent.

However, using magic in conjunction with it required an extremely high level of control, beyond Taesan's imagination. It was impossible for him now.

So, additional preparation was necessary.

Taesan took out materials and inserted them into his wrist guard."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This is the Magic Tower where wizards gather. The materials for alchemy were countless.

[You have partially changed the world.]

The thing that changed was not this space, which is under the law of Zelvand.

It was Taesan himself.

Taesan's mana power was amplified, and he gained perfect control over it.

Taesan gathered mana and blackness as it was.

Could blackness be combined with a different power, not divinity?

No one in this world could handle blackness. Only Taesan was capable of doing so.

Blackness and divinity are fundamentally opposing powers. Taesan was close to forcefully controlling the two powers, which constantly clashed and tried to break free.

However, in the case of blackness and magic, magic couldn't withstand blackness. In any case, magic was consumed by blackness and disappeared.

I was still thinking about it, but Wirard showed me the way.

The condensed mana began to implement a frozen world. Taesan placed blackness outside his mana as it was.

What was needed was balance through opposition."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The blackness goes berserk. It's as if it wants to defy the will of Taesan, swallowing everything in the world and going on a rampage.

'Shut up.'

Taesan gathers his strength fiercely.

With a strong will, he tramples the resisting blackness.

It doesn't matter if it's the power of the gods or the power of the laws. It's his own power that he possesses.

Then, he must follow his own will.

With a strong determination, he tramples the blackness. Taesan's aura itself crushes the blackness.

The blackness trembles violently, but soon calms down.

The internal mana and the external blackness begin to balance each other out.

Taesan unleashes his power as it is.

[You have activated the frozen world.]

Zzzt!

Coldness sweeps across the world. But the color is not white.

It's a deep, dark black, like ink.

Wylard hastily waves his staff, and the lines that surround Taesan scatter, with thousands of lines trying to pierce through Taesan.

But they come into contact with the black coldness.

Zzzt!

The lines shatter and scatter in all directions.

Wylard's magic is broken for the first time.

"It's done."

Taesan clenches his fist. At the same time, the system window appears."

[You have obtained the Dark Magic.]

“……Ha. Haha! Hahahahaha!”

The wizard, Wira, gazed at the mountain with a blank expression, then burst into laughter. He shook his long beard and gazed at the mountain with an insane glint in his eyes.

“How can you possibly wield the power of the gods as if it were your own?! It's incomprehensible!”

He slammed his staff on the ground, sending a powerful shockwave rippling out.

“Excellent! Absolutely excellent! This place is perfect for accumulating magical knowledge, but it's been infested with weaklings! To reach a higher dimension, you can't rely on that! You need to fight with all your might and surpass them!”

Wira pointed his staff at the mountain.

“Come! You, the Immortal One! Take me to a higher place!”

The staff shook violently.

[Wira's authority is revealed. He has activated the Dimensional Rift.]

A dot appeared at the tip of the staff.

Its color was not black, like before, but white.

Although no power could be felt, the mountain instinctively knew that the white dot was not just a simple power, but something close to the laws of the world.

"Taesan gathered mana and blackness. He acquired a skill. And he knew how to use it all.

Black magic is manifesting in the world.
