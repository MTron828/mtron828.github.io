111. 23rd Floor. Wind Spirit. Kashfa (2)

The wind turns into blades and emits a piercing sound. Taesan swings his hand widely.

Bang!

The blades shatter and the air explodes. Taesan leaps through the empty space, dodging the airborne attacks, and lands above Kashfa, bringing down his sword.

At the moment it touches Kashfa's horn, the wind explodes, pushing Taesan away. Taesan lands on the ground and moves his hand. The wind that was shooting like cannonballs dissipates upon colliding with his fist.

"Difficult."

Taesan rotates his hand. He had managed to defend against everything through reconnaissance, but he had not inflicted any significant damage to the spirit.

Taesan obtained skills from the deranged spirit to attack spirits, making it possible for him to engage in combat against them.

However, if the attack didn't connect, it was meaningless.

[That's your limit, human.]

The spirit in the form of a deer arrogantly remarked.

[I acknowledge your prowess. Lesser and intermediate spirits wouldn't stand a chance against you.]
Nullification of attacks, acceleration, and many other spells.

The power and abilities Taesan displayed were beyond what even Kashfa had seen before. For an adventurer of the 23rd floor, it was an overwhelming amount of strength.

Honestly, I couldn't help but be impressed as the battle continued.

["But that's as far as you go. Your power cannot touch me."]

"You're the same, though."

Kashfa, too, failed to land any significant blows on Taesan. Kashfa remained indifferent.

["Your goal is to kill me. Mine is simply to drive you out of here. The superiority here is clear."]

"Hmph."

Taesan chuckled but didn't argue.

In reality, it was true. His attacks didn't connect with Kashfa.

As he tried to approach Kashfa, the wind exploded, pushing Taesan away. Despite using acceleration, force, and diversion tactics to get closer, most of his attempts failed.

Even his magic didn't prove very effective. Frost arrows were blocked by the wind, nullifying their acceleration, and the incendiary sphere didn't even manifest due to the wind's interference.
The lightning strike had some utility, but only managed to inflict damage that was hardly worth the mana spent.

"He seems to favor defense over offense."

At least with his current stats, breaking through his defenses wasn't possible.

"Reflect on your arrogance and leave, human."

"I'd rather not."

Taesan's refusal elicited a smirk from Kashfa.

"Coldness is akin to the symbol of an adventurer. Very well. Feel your helplessness."

The wind surrounding Kashfa thickened. Without needing to activate reconnaissance, a dense wall appeared.

Taesan shook his sword. His opponent was someone against whom all his accumulated experience and skills were ineffective.

"I wanted to practice a bit more, but I suppose it can't be helped."

Muttering to himself, Taesan stomped his foot. Kashfa scoffed as he saw Taesan charging towards him.

"You're like a mosquito."

The wind fragmented into pieces in the room. Burnt grasses were cut off and scattered like flower petals.

Taesan rushed towards Kashfa. Darkness expanded behind him.

"You have triggered the distorted ecosystem of Dekarabia."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Dozens of massive tree roots protrude from the darkness. Kashfa, who had been waiting leisurely, is startled.

"This is!"

Kugugugung!

The roots begin to surge and fill the room. Fragments of flying wind are blocked and disappear into the roots.

"You're not a demon!"

Kashfa denies it and sends blades of wind. Instead of blocking with his sword as before, Taesan hides behind the roots.

Kagak!

Blade marks appear on the roots. They are quite deep, but not enough to break the roots into pieces. To sever the roots, it would require the power contained in the wind.

"As expected."

Neither magic nor aura nor skills could damage the spirits, but only dark magic could inflict damage on them. From the 21st floor, there was a faint suspicion that something was happening.

Dark magic had an advantage over spirits.

With this in mind, victory was assured. Taesan moves through the gaps in the roots to avoid the wind and approaches Kashfa.

"Pointless."

The wind intensifies around Kashfa. The accelerating wind gradually becomes a storm that unfolds before Taesan. Taesan places his hand in the storm.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"You triggered Marcothias's fake flames."

Material in the shape of flames pours out. It vigorously shakes the storm and emits intense heat.

"The fake flames are material in the shape of flames. They inflict continuous damage. How long can you withstand?"

Kiiiiing!

With a tearing sound, the storm shakes violently. The false flame rises like a living creature and devours the power of nature.

"How dare you defile spirits with twisted power!"

With a voice filled with anger, Kashfa gathers strength. The room shakes heavily under the concentrated power of the wind, as if it were about to explode.

"You triggered Raom's emotional turmoil."

During the previous battle, when random mental attacks were launched, Kashfa had not been affected in any way. He had even mocked it as pathetic.

"Ugh, ugh!"

But this time was different. Kashfa began to look noticeably confused.

The boiling wind subsided like an explosion, and the fake flames continued to melt the storm away.

Finally, a small gap opened between the storms. Taesan activated his acceleration. He rushed in quickly and thrust his sword into the gap.
Here is the English translation of the text:

The storm tore apart, leaving Kashfa vulnerable. Blue flames ignited on Taesan's sword.

"[Human!]"

"Stop calling."

"[210 damage to Kashfa.]"

The sword moved, displaying a damage window as it did. Kashfa roared and gathered the wind.

"To humans, to spirits, to the beings of natureâ€”inflict wounds!"

"You're quite noisy."

As Taesan pushed forward, he activated Marcothias's fake flames. The material in the shape of flames engulfed the gathering wind and crushed it.

He knew the countermeasure. He succeeded in approaching. From here on, it was one-sided.

Dealing damage with his sword and blocking the opponent's actions with dark magic, Taesan nullified the spirit's skills. Even without the system window showing, being so close allowed him to foresee the enemy's moves.

*Kwaack.*

Finally, the spirit collapsed. It didn't take long, as its health wasn't as high as expected.

"Ha, hahaha."

Kashfa chuckled bitterly.

"Such as a human... Such as a human!"

Regret soon turned to anger. A voice filled with hatred echoed.

"Human! Our king will judge you! You will pay for daring to touch a spirit!"
Here is the English translation of the text:

"Is the Spirit King also present here?"

"They reside in the deepest depths! To oppose us for the sake of insane spirits like Kashfa! They will pay dearly for their arrogance!"

"Don't worry about that. We were bound to be hostile with you anyway."

Taesan delivered the finishing blow. Kashfa's body dispersed into the air, and the power contained within it merged with Taesan.

"You have defeated Kashfa, the superior wind spirit." "Your level has increased." "Your level has increased." "Your Spirit Ascension has been triggered. Your strength has permanently increased by 32, intelligence by 22, mana by 60." "Your Spirit Ascension has been triggered." "Acquired the spirit skill [Deer Walking the Wind Path]." "Obtained the core of a superior spirit." "Gained the untamed spirit's aura."

With the rise in level and Spirit Ascension, stats also increased significantly. However, it was the skills that caught his attention first.
[Spirit Skill: Deer Walking the Wind Path] [Mana Consumption: 100] [Proficiency: 1%] [Duration: 30 minutes] [A spirit born from the wind itself can manipulate its birthplace. During the duration, it exercises influence over the wind.]

The mana consumption was quite substantial. However, it had a description of duration attached to it.

He could understand why the system window didn't appear when Kashfa manipulated the wind. It was because once used, it became a persistent skill.

Taesan decided to try it out immediately.

[You have activated Deer Walking the Wind Path.]

A strange sensation instantly enveloped him.

The air currents, which he had previously paid no attention to, could now be felt across his entire body. He waved his hand, discerning the direction and trajectory of the wind's movement.

Recalling Kashfa's method, Taesan attempted to create a curtain of wind. The wind condensed and formed a faint blueish barrier around Taesan.

However, it was incredibly weak and unstable. It seemed like it could collapse at any moment, swaying unsteadily.

Taesan clenched his fist. The wind forming the barrier exploded, forcefully striking the room.

"Is this the extent of it? It's still difficult to control."

Muttered Taesan, sensing the strength of the wind.
Since he wasn't a spirit, or perhaps due to his lack of proficiency, it wasn't usable to the extent of offense or defense.

Nevertheless, it wasn't completely unusable. The significant point was its duration as a skill. Being able to freely use it for 30 minutes was sufficient for supporting movements.

Against much weaker enemies, just the spirit skill alone would be enough.

It was a usable skill. Taesan judged so as he checked the items he acquired.

[Core of a High-level Spirit] [Spirit's core. Pure and powerful. If held by nature devoid of ego, it will become a spirit.]

It seemed like a quest item. He could take it to the spirit gone mad. Taesan confirmed the other item as well.

[Unbound Spirit's Essence] [Spirits are not bound. Among them, the wind spirit has the attribute of flying through the sky without restraint. If used with specific equipment, it seems one could gain special power.]

"This is also an item for refining."

As the timing for refining the materials entrusted to him approached, his reasons for visiting increased.

After finishing his inspection, Taesan tidied up the room. As he headed towards the boss room, he asked the ghost:

"Have you seen the Spirit King?"
Kashpa had spoken about their king. He mentioned that he resided deep within, and the ghost was an adventurer who had ventured down to the depths as well.

"He was there. But I wasn't interested."

"Why?"

"He was a guide to sin."

The ghost spoke calmly. It was an unexpected revelation.

"So he was an adventurer, not a monster or NPC?"

"Spirits are ultimately part of races like demons or humans. There's no reason for him to enter the labyrinth in the form of a monster. I don't know why he came. I wasn't interested in the weak ones."

There was a faint anger in the indifferent voice.

"Come to think of it, did he help kill me too? Then I have a purpose. I'll tear him apart too."

"Let's postpone that."

Taesan arrived at the boss of the 23rd floor.

The boss was an intermediate wind spirit. Naturally, he dispatched it easily. After defeating a high-level spirit, there was no way an intermediate one could be a challenge.
[Your level has increased.]

[Your Enlightenment has been triggered. Strength has permanently increased by 15. Agility has permanently increased by 18.]

[Obtained Snake Skin Belt.]

[Obtained ???]

[Your level is now 55.]

[Using the dungeon's system, you have arrived at the entrance level desired by the wizard. The wizard, pleased with your growth, offers you a reward.]

[Choose your reward.]

[1: Provision of special equipment.]
[2: Increase in proficiency of specific skills.]
[3: Permanent increase in specific stats.]
[4: Comprehensive knowledge about the dungeon.]
[5: Some of the hidden truths of the dungeon.]
[6: One desired piece of information, but with conditions and constraints.]
