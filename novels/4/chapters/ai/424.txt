**Chapter 425**

425. 83rd Floor, the Essence of the God of Fall (7)

The apostle hesitated for a moment.

Taesan's face was filled with confidence.

The apostle was convinced that he could obtain the power of the God of Fall that Taesan had shown.

Without a single doubt, the apostle thought that Taesan's words were trustworthy.

"Nonsense!"

But the apostle immediately denied his own thoughts.

It's impossible. Taesan's power would never reach him.

He clenched his fist and charged forward, full of confidence.

Taesan responded to him.

**Crash!**

The course of the battle didn't change. Taesan was still overwhelming the apostle.

But the result didn't change either.

The apostle didn't fall.

On the contrary, he started to counter Taesan's power little by little.

"Just a moment……."

"This is……."

Only then did the onlookers realize that something was wrong.

The power Taesan was showing now was clearly superior to theirs.

In fact, it had reached a higher dimension than the princess who had opened the Colosseum just a few days ago.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And the apostle was an equal opponent to the princess.

It was impossible to block Taesan's attack.

But the apostle, although struggling, was able to continue the battle without taking significant damage.

It was as if it was designed to be that way from the beginning.

"Ah……."

"This is it."

Despair suddenly spread throughout the audience. They too realized the truth about the Colosseum.

"Hmm. There's no need to pretend anymore."

"I tried to hide it, but it's too late."

"It doesn't matter."

The apostle sneered.

"It's a bit early, but they will be satisfied. Those who believed there was an escape route have realized the truth and fallen into despair. It's a painting that Essence-nim loves very much."

The apostle burst into laughter.

"More than anything! You can't give up! Even if there's nothing at the end of the rope, you can't let go of your only hope!"

The apostle fiercely clenched his fist.

"Come on! Realize your own powerlessness!"

Taesan slowly drew his sword.

The battle continued. Taesan unleashed numerous powerful attacks, and the apostle responded to all of them."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan's face showed confidence, and Sado's face showed joy.

No matter how much he attacked, the enemy wouldn't fall.

It was a very good opponent to raise his proficiency.

Taesan used numerous skills to raise his proficiency.

Even if their skills were similar, the difference in power was enormous, so he couldn't raise his proficiency much.

But it was satisfying enough. Taesan significantly raised his proficiency in various skills, including magic and dark magic.

And in the process, he continued to grasp Sado's power.

After roughly confirming, Taesan sheathed his sword.

"That's it. I lose."

"...What?"

Kugugugu!

As the participant acknowledged his defeat, the Colosseum event came to an end. Sado was taken aback by Taesan's sudden surrender.

"Are you giving up like this?"

"I've learned everything I needed to."

Taesan jumped away with a nonchalant expression.

In the midst of shock and confusion, Taesan disappeared without a word.

Sado stood there, dumbfounded.

* * *

Taesan used his remaining points to get a decent room.

He didn't think he could win from the first battle anyway.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What I wanted was information and a strategy. What I hoped for was to gain enough to try again after recovering. My skills have also improved significantly, so I can try again after recovering.

'It's a shame I didn't get the skill.'

Among the skills I remembered, there was none that met the conditions. A few new skills came to mind, but the risk was too great. Since I didn't fully understand the power of the sacred artifact, there was no need to challenge it.

Taesan organized his thoughts.

The sacred artifact was an unbeatable boss.

No matter how much I reduced its health, it would recover just as much. It would respond to Taesan's skills and gain new powers.

'And it would respond to the boundary line as well.'

This was the first time the boundary line itself was intervening.

But Taesan wasn't surprised.

The boundary line was powerful, but not all-powerful. He knew that if he were at the level of a transcender or an immortal, he could overcome it. There was no reason to be surprised now.

On the contrary, the fact that he could obtain the power to intervene even with the boundary line was delightful.

Thud. Thud.

The sound of knocking on the door echoed. The Golden Princess, Diana, entered.

'Taesan-nim, are you okay?'

'Why are you like that?'

Diana, who had entered, looked flustered."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She thought that Taesan's mind was shaken.

But there was no change in Taesan's facial expression.

"No, I don't think I need your advice."

Diana asked calmly.

"What do you plan to do?"

"I'm thinking about it."

She had grasped the basic structure and principle.

But she still couldn't think of a way to overcome it.

The problem was ultimately the power of the Fallen God. She had to break through it. Why was the Fallen God so confident in its own victory? It was because it was going to use its own power.

Power was something that existed because of its own accumulation.

It wasn't strange for the transcendent being, Essence, to have absolute confidence.

[How can I use a shortcut to break through?]

"It's difficult."

This was the realm of the Fallen God. There was no way to use a shortcut. The skills beyond the boundary, including the eternal and immortal belief skill, were sealed.

Taesan was worried. Diana also furrowed her brow, deep in thought.

The damage to the apostle was normal.

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was like Taesan's prediction, where his physical strength wouldn't fall below 1, and when it reached 1, it would recover.

Then, the method of winning was simple.

If you forcefully made his physical strength, which wouldn't fall below 1, to 0, it would be over.

Taesan had a card for that.

Boundary Line. A power that destroyed order and ignored laws.

With this power, I could defeat the Four Gods.

The God of Fall also knew this and used his authority to block the Boundary Line.

In other words, the God of Fall told me that the Boundary Line was the correct answer.

'The authority of the Transcender.'

I had to break through it.

But that was the authority of the Transcender itself. Taesan, who had fallen to the mortal realm, could never break through it.

No matter how incomplete the authority was, it was still the authority of the Transcender.

If it was the authority of the Transcender, even the Boundary Line created by Taesan, who had fallen, could be made non-existent.

But I couldn't do it.

Handling authority was, after all, a matter of being a god. Even if I was a god's apostle, I couldn't perfectly handle the authority of the Transcender. There was definitely a limit.

'I have to break through that limit.'

But how could I break through the limit?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The power of the Fall intervenes even at the boundary line. It was the highest law among laws. It was impossible to pierce through it with the power within the law.

Taesan had previously defeated Horai's apostle, who wielded the power of the Transcender, but it wasn't that he had pierced through the power. Rather, it was because the opponent had not handled the power properly, and Taesan had taken advantage of that gap.

According to Essence's judgment, Taesan would not be able to pierce through the power no matter what means he used, which is why he was given this trial.

Then, what if he were to use other abilities that the God of the Fall might not know about?

Taesan came to a conclusion.

* * *

A day later, after recovering all his spent energy and gathering points, Taesan reopened the Colosseum.

The audience seats were filled again, but the faces were no longer filled with the same trust and expectation as before.

Everyone sat with half-dead faces.

"...... Princess."

"Ah, Reynald."

Reynald approached Diana with a haggard face.

"Are you okay? You don't look well."

"What's the point of being healthy in a place where you can't even die?"

Reynald smiled bitterly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We were fools. We didn't know and were reckless. The princess... did she know from the beginning?"

Diana nodded her head. Reynald's face contorted in despair.

"...I'm sorry. I didn't know that either, and I said foolish things to the princess."

"No, thanks to you, I was able to regain my composure. You don't have to apologize."

"Thank you."

After composing himself, Reynald looked at Taesan.

"I thought the Colosseum wouldn't open for at least a few years... but maybe there's a way?"

"I'm not sure."

"Does the princess not know either?"

"She didn't give a clear answer. When I asked her the reason, she said the God of Decline might be watching."

"That's true too."

This was his domain. He couldn't not know what was happening within his domain.

"But... since there's a possibility, I'll take on the challenge."

A light sparkled in Reynald's eyes.

And then, the apostle appeared. He looked at Taesan with an unpleasant expression.

In the previous battle, Taesan had declared defeat. But there was no sense of victory. Only the feeling of being used.

"Kill me."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Sado galloped his horse.

Taesan drew his sword with an expressionless face.

The battle began.

The flow of the battle was no different from before. Taesan overwhelmed Sado, and Sado barely managed to defend himself.

But no one cheered. The faces of those who realized it was a predetermined play became even more gloomy.

"Hahaha!"

Sado laughed, having blocked Taesan's sword with his fist.

"You can never beat me! It's already been decided!"

"Maybe not."

Taesan put the materials into his wrist guard. The wrist guard swallowed all the materials with a gulping sound.

And Taesan changed the world.

[You have activated a partial world change.]

It's not the world that's changing.

Taesan is changing himself.

What he desires is the ability to control mana.

[You have activated the Frozen World [Rejection].]

An icy chill, like darkness, swept in. Sado's face stiffened for a moment.

"Ugh!"

Sado clenched his fist and swung it.

Kugugugung!

Until now, Sado had been gaining power that surpassed his opponents' strength.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But this time, I couldn't do it.

The power of negation magic is a fusion of black and magic. Fundamentally, it has the upper hand over all the powers of this world.

In the end, the apostle was frozen in the dark cold.

Tzzt!

"...What is this?"

The apostle's whole body was frozen, and he scowled.

"You're handling a very unusual power. But it's not a problem."

The apostle, who had escaped from the ice, spoke with confidence.

"With this, you can't kill me."

"I know that."

The power of negation magic has absolute superiority over all powers. It can't completely ignore the laws.

But the apostle also wouldn't fall, and he couldn't respond.

That was enough.

The power of negation magic is a mixed magic of divine power and black power.

It couldn't be called a power within the laws.

The black and golden colors mixed on Taesan's sword, and a gray color appeared.

Taesan drew a boundary line.

"Hahaha! Foolish thing!"

The apostle ridiculed Taesan.

"Oh God! Give me your power! Please throw away everything that dares to oppose you into the abyss!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power envelops the Taesan. At the same time, Taesan activated his skill.

[You have activated Selective Exclusion.]

Maria's power, which erases the opponent's selection.

But nothing happens. Taesan clicks his tongue.

"Is it not an attack, or does the power not apply to him?"

Whatever the case, the power of downfall envelops Taesan.

It intervenes with Taesan, rendering all his powers useless and meaningless.

The boundary line was also included.

The boundary line loses its power in an instant, and the black and divine energies begin to separate.

In this state, it is impossible to kill the four gods.

Taesan also knew that fact.

This is where the real battle begins.

[You have activated Frozen World [Negation].] [You have activated Mana Storm [Negation].] [You have activated Unquenchable Flame Bird [Negation].]

You activate a series of negation magic.

All of them manifest along with the boundary line and collapse in an instant, rendering their power meaningless.

The power of the downfall god envelops Taesan, making it impossible to escape.

Even so, Taesan does not stop."

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Rather, it drew in even more mana and poured out its power. It mixed black and divine power once again, creating a boundary line.

Endlessly, powers that could destroy the world began to appear.

'...You?'

Sado's face stiffened. He too realized that something was off.

[You have activated the Great Collapse [Rejection].]

A distorted sphere materialized in the world.

The power of the God of Destruction engulfed the Great Collapse and brought it down.

Ridiculous.

But something was different.

Through the gap in the power that enveloped Taesan, power slowly began to flow out.

It was as if it had exceeded the limits of power.

'...You!'

Only then did Sado's face distort as he realized what Taesan was aiming for.

'Dare! You think you can confront the great power of the esteemed one head-on? Don't be ridiculous! That person is a transcendent being! You're not even close to being able to reach them!'

A transcendent being dominates the concept itself.

With a realm worthy of the divine, they exercise absolute influence within it.

The God of Destruction is a transcendent being that dominates the concept of destruction."

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power of essence that deals with the law of gravity is like the apple falling to the ground or the air moving from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure area, which is the fundamental principle of the world.

To break that power, the opponent also had to have a concept and intervene with the law.

In reality, it was impossible to respond unless you were a transcendent being.

But now, Taesan was trying to break the power of essence with his strength.

"That's not for you to judge. It's for me to judge."

This was insufficient.

What he was trying to do now was to deny the fundamental principle of the world with his strength.

He had used the boundary and negation magic simultaneously, but he still couldn't surpass the power of the gravity god.

So, one more was needed.

A power that transcended immortality and could reach the transcendent being was necessary.

Taesan opened his magic. But it wasn't the dark magic of another demon.

It was Taesan's own dark magic.
