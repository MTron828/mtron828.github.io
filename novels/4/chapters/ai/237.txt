Chapter 238

238. The Fourth Return. Earth (5)

It was simple to know what Go Shin was aiming at.

It was impossible to kill Taesan. To send a monster to kill him, a lot of strength was needed.

Moreover, there was an issue with the contract with the gods, so it couldn't be easily decided.

So, instead of killing Taesan, I kill someone else.

The current attack felt like that.

A monster's attack from a distance. The number was not small, and it was scattered in all directions.

"'It's not a bad method.'"

Taesan was not particularly good at long-range attacks. With his bow and magic, he could attack up to 10 kilometers, but he couldn't predict Go Shin's moves.

If he tried to attack at close range with a arrow or magic, he would probably come up with a countermeasure.

Of course, processing it itself was possible. Sado-hwa, the King's vessel, and Black were all examples. Once he revealed his cards one by one, he could be defeated.

However, Go Shin was aiming at that itself.

So, I use the power that consumes the least value.

Urg.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

On Taesan's palm, the starlight arrows gathered.

It was a mid-level magic given to him by the god of magic, Jerbrand.

The faces of the people around him, including Choi Tae-man, turned white. They were not the only ones; others nearby did not look significantly different.

"Ugh..."

"Ah, ah..."

They coughed up their labored breaths and shrank their bodies.

"That's it."

It was simply a manifestation, but a crushing pressure was unleashed. They could sense that even a weak force could not be approached by them, and they felt a sense of instinctual awareness.

"Weren't you just pretending?"

Choi Tae-man's eyes widened in shock, and Taesan focused his mind.

He expanded his senses. He could detect the positions of monstrous creatures 10 kilometers away, shooting concrete at them.

He stored each one in his mind. He detected a monstrous creature crawling at the bottom of his feet. He read all the variables existing in every direction.

And then the arrow shot up into the sky. The starlight energy rose to the high sky.

"Scattered."

The arrow burst out like fireworks.
Note: I translated "태산" as "Taesan", which is a common Korean given name. If you meant something else, please let me know.
Here is the translation of the text:

Like a rain of stars, the arrows scattered towards the monsters. At the same time, the ground cracked, and a monster with a shield-like form appeared. The monster, which shot concrete-like projectiles, surrounded itself with a massive barrier.

It seemed to be specialized in blocking long-range attacks and had the strength of an A-grade monster, equivalent to the strength of a giant's bow and an icy arrow.

"'Ah, I was prepared for this.'"

The broken starlight collided with the monster's barrier.

And then the starlight shattered the barrier.

The A-grade monster, which had focused solely on defense, was crushed like Styrofoam by the starlight. The starlight, which had been shot down, exploded.

Kuuuuuuuung!

Residual fragments erupted from all directions.

"What, what's this?"

Chief Tae-man was left speechless by the immense power that seemed like a missile had fallen. Taesan smiled satisfactorily.

"It's okay."

The monsters left behind no remains and disappeared. The monster that appeared later was not low on energy, considering its specialization in defense, and was defeated with a single blow.

[Mid-level magic: Starlight Arrow] [Proficiency: 1%] [Consumed mana: 400] [Implement a starlight arrow infused with the power of the stars. The arrow can be divided into multiple branches, but its power decreases.]

If the world was frozen and was specialized in close-range combat, the Starlight Arrow was a long-range sniping magic.
Here is the translation of the text:

"If one doesn't separate the arrows and uses them, the power won't decrease even over dozens of kilometers. Moreover, one can adjust the speed to a great extent. Although I handled it slowly this time since it was the first use, I could have shot it at a speed that even a skilled person couldn't react to if I wanted to.

The value in a limited space like a labyrinth is not low, but the value outside is even higher. The part that was lacking in terms of long-range combat before was filled to a significant extent.

"'Let's keep going.'"

Tae-san said.

The people nodded silently.

* * *

"'The story was actually exaggerated.'"

"What are you talking about suddenly?"

"It's about your strength."

Choi Tae-man smiled wryly.

"'You're a monster, just as expected.'"

Monsters continued to appear afterwards.

He wielded various powers and tried to kill them in different ways.

And Tae-san easily defeated all of them.

Each process showed Tae-san's power, which was astonishing in itself.

In fact, the rumors he had heard were exaggerated.

"'You thought it was fake, right?'"

"Most people thought so. Not just me, but people who haven't met you believe your strength is exaggerated.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

He glanced at the others.

"But it wasn't like that. I understand why they're showing reverence towards you."

Just like in Seoul, the people of Busan were also showing reverence and worship towards Taesan.

"Then... there might be a problem."

Taesan's face contorted in a scowl.

Taesan, who knew what the problem was, replied.

"It won't happen."

They continued on their way.

Although the monsters were still visible, it seemed they were slowly finding a different method. After processing everything and advancing, they finally arrived in Seoul.

"Wow!"

"Ah, we made it!"

People hugged each other and shed tears of joy, expressing their gratitude to Taesan.

"Thank you! Thank you!"

Taesan nodded and entered into the room.

Inside, there was no one except Ji, the guardian of Seoul, and the Normal Player. Taesan, who had set out from Busan, was the first to arrive.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was as expected. The fewer numbers, the more it would be possible to move a longer distance. Barkazha's group had more people than Busan, so they were relatively slower.

Kim Hui-yeon, Lee Tae-yeon, and Kang Jun-hyeok were not very different.

But they were not as strong as a mountain, so it took them time to handle the monster. In the case of Minerba, it was inevitable that they would be slow since they had to cross the sea.

"'We'll wait until all the groups arrive.'"

The next quest requires everyone to gather.

He sent the people inside the hall and then left the hall again.

He quickly moved towards Kim Hui-yeon's side. Not long after, their movements became visible.

"'Eiiik!'"

They were pushing the monster away with all their might.

"'It's fine.'"

The strength of the monsters was top-notch even among D-rank. It was difficult for them to handle, but they were dealing with each one individually.

Taesan did not come to help. Even if they were in a hurry, there was no reason to help if they could overcome it on their own. Experience was the most valuable value.

Taesan continued to move on his own.

He also met the group led by Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Jun-hyeok, but they did not seem to have any major problems.

"'Looks like we won well.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

As I saw that the situation was beyond words, it seemed that a monster of the C-grade had appeared, but it seemed that they had won. It was an achievable feat with their combined strength.

"It's not a problem for Barca or Minerva either."

So it was just a matter of waiting.

Taesan returned to Seoul. The people of Busan, including Choi Taeman, were walking around with blank faces.

"This place..."

It's too intact.

Most buildings are broken, but they still maintained their shape. Busan had taken root to the extent that its buildings had flown away.

The faces of the people were bright. Only hope for survival and a future to look forward to was visible on their faces.

As a result, many people survived. Unlike the Busan that could be counted, there were tens of thousands of people.

"And..."

Choi Taeman clenched his fist.

His strength had increased significantly compared to before. It was because he received support from the area Taesan had spread out when he entered Seoul.

"Ha."

He let out a forced laugh.

It was surprising and sad that the difference was caused by just one person.
Here is the translation of the text:

The people of Seoul welcomed the people of Busan. Although people of the same level can meet each other, the meeting on earth is different. The family, acquaintances, and those who met each other were happy and shared stories.

As they talked more, they realized the differences between Seoul and Busan.

The people of Seoul thought that if there was no Tae-san, they would also be like this.

The people of Busan thought that since they have come to Seoul, they can also live with the future in mind like this.

As a result, the faith towards Tae-san became even deeper. The proficiency of sacred power increased noticeably, exceeding 30%.

Time passed.

People gathered slowly.

The latest to arrive was Kim Hwi-yeon's group. It took a long time because they had to process the many people and monsters.

Eventually, everyone gathered.

"Alright, let's start the meeting," Kim Hwi-yeon said.

* * *

About a dozen people were gathered in a small meeting room. Most of them were leaders who had overseen players from each region.

Kim Hwi-yeon looked at them with a complex expression.

"I'm glad to see you all... but it's like we're all familiar faces."

Choi Tae-man smiled wryly.
Here is the translation of the text:

If you could become a leader in this region, you would naturally be a hard mode player. And among them, you had to be especially strong.

Kim Hwi-yeon, Geum Jung-keun, and the others had no acquaintance. Kim Hwi-yeon slapped the table with a bang.

"I have a lot to say, and I'm sure you all are curious about something too...”

They were looking at Mount Tai and Minerba and Barcas beside it, filled with longing, curiosity, suspicion, and reverence.

And one enemy.

[The Owner.]

'Wait.'

The voice echoing in his mind was answered by Mount Tai.

"Let's process the things we're curious about later, and first take care of the arrangements."

Kim Hwi-yeon asked with a serious face.

"How many of you survived?"

The number of survivors, and the additional people in each mode. We had to grasp that first.

Choi Tae-man was the first to speak up.

"Busan. Start the solo mode. Open 12 hard mode players. 57 normal mode players. 92 easy mode players. In total, 191 people survived."

"...".

The shocking number left them all speechless.

Among the approximately 350,000 people, only 191 survived. Choi Tae-man said with a gloomy expression.
Here is the translation:

"He likes being scolded. It's okay because I couldn't save it anyway."

"No, you couldn't do anything."

Everyone in Busan knew the situation. Next, the leader of Jeju-do said:

"Jeju-do: 3 players in hard mode, 20 players in normal mode, 30 players in easy mode."

"Gwangju: 450 players in hard mode, 1,600 players in normal mode, 3,500 players in easy mode."

Let's start telling the story one by one. The place where the most people survived was Daejeon, with an astonishing 650 people in hard mode, 300 people in normal mode, and 600 people in easy mode.

The man's face was filled with pride as he talked about the survival numbers. He had led many people to survive under his command, so it was only natural that he was proud.

He glanced at the mountain for a moment.

His eyes seemed to contain a hint of sadness and a sense of caution towards weak enemies.

"It's been a while."

In a world where everyone laughed and cooperated, there was no such thing. People were accustomed to opposing each other and fighting.

He was an example of Choi Jung-hyeok.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

He incited turmoil and killed many people in order to survive, but he had a clear purpose in mind - to survive.

Although his methods were wrong, the fact that he wanted to survive was not the problem. Therefore, even Taesan had to deal with Cho Jung-hyeok, but he understood his desire.

Seojangsan was the same. He used Ji and Normal modes to survive in a rational way. Although his methods were wrong and led to bad results, it was a choice that could be understood in a world that was about to collapse.

But the man in front of him, the leader of Jeonju.

Taesan couldn't understand that man until the very end.

The man who had met his most foolish death that he could remember.

That was the man that Taesan remembered.

It was Kim Hwi-yeon's turn.

She opened her mouth.

"There are 150 players in solo mode, 7,252 players in hard mode, 1,690 players in normal mode, and 1,770 players in easy mode. That's a total of 15,762 people."

"......"

People lose their words, with a different meaning from the past.
