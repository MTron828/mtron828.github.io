Chapter 509

509. 94th Floor, Easy Mode (2)

[Just a moment. So, this is...]

"This is the place I cleared before I turned back time."

Taesan and Lee Tae-yeon. A world that only the two of them experienced. Bardley held his breath.

[Master? Where is this place?]

"I think you don't know much about it."

Taesan told Akasha about his past in moderation. After the story ended, Akasha was speechless.

[Is that... really?]

"It feels good to be back in my hometown after a long time."

Taesan approached the well. A gentle ripple spread on the surface of the water, touched by his fingertips.

[Then...].

Bardley, who barely suppressed his astonishment, slowly grasped the situation.

[Is this not the past?]

"It can be seen that way."

This place was not the past. It was closer to a world abandoned in a distorted timeline.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If the goal was simply to return to the past, it could have been made easier. But that's not what Taesan wanted. What he wanted was to return to the timeline that had been distorted and erased. It was to return to easy mode."

Taesan took a sip of the water, and with its refreshing taste, the fatigue that had remained in his body was recovered.

Bardley asked Taesan, who was drinking water, "So, what are you going to do now?"

"What was the point of crossing over the distorted timeline?"

"Let's understand the situation first," Taesan said, looking at Bardley and Akasha. The two were standing beside him, having lost their physical bodies and existing only as spiritual entities.

Taesan was the same. He had lost all the equipment he had obtained at the peak of the labyrinth. The equipment he was currently wearing was all from easy mode.

"It's like possession." It seemed to be a concept that temporarily possessed Taesan in this timeline. If it was a summon, there would have been restrictions on his actions, so it wasn't bad in that regard.

"Status window."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**[Gang Tae-san] [Level: 57] [Health: 1021/1021] [Mana: 820/820] [Strength: 105] [Intelligence: 100] [Agility: 98] [Attack Power +49] [Defense Power +58] [The target is in the best condition. The target is $xx! indeed.]**

The stats were ridiculously low, laughable compared to now. I couldn't help but burst out laughing.

It was a perfect, easy mode, with nothing to add or subtract.

The only difference was that there was something sleeping inside him.

Perhaps it was the power he had in his original world. If he were to bring it out, he might be able to use it. But then, there was a high possibility that he would be expelled from this world.

After roughly grasping the situation, Tae-san looked around again.

"Baradley" muttered in amazement.

**["But this is just like a real labyrinth. A place like this can exist, too. What have those bastards done?"]**

"Exactly the same?"

**["There's no difference, is there? The energy I feel, the atmosphere, everything is the same."]**

"That's how it feels to you, I suppose."

But it wasn't the same for Tae-san.

Although all his powers were sealed, the experiences he had gained didn't disappear.

So, he could know facts that he didn't know in the past.

"It's different."

Easy mode was different from Alone mode, and there was an unpleasant smell here.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a strange and unfamiliar smell, yet somehow familiar.

Something was twisted. I could confirm what I had predicted to some extent by seeing it directly.

"There's a lot to do."

Taesan recalled which floor he was on and soon realized that this was the 80th floor.

A resting place where the Spring of Life existed. Taesan had cleared the labyrinth and rested here for a long time when he got tired. Not only that, but many other easy mode players had also rested here and chatted.

But now, there was no one in sight.

Taesan was alone in the vast floor.

No, he wasn't alone. Someone was slowly approaching.

Before long, an old man appeared.

"......I wondered where you went. You were here."

The old man greeted Taesan with a warm smile.

"It's been a while since you came to rest. Taesan."

"......Deoksu, old man."

A forgotten memory flashed through Taesan's mind."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Most players in Easy Mode revered Taesan, yet feared him at the same time. Despite being in Easy Mode, he had become so powerful that it was difficult to approach him.

However, there were a few who could do so. They had built a friendship with Taesan.

Deoksu, the old man, was one of them.

"It's been a while."

Taesan opened his mouth. Deoksu's face trembled for a moment.

"......Something's changed. It seems like there's been a change in your heart."

"Did you notice?"

"Well, even though we've lived similar lives, I'm still a bit older than you."

Deoksu chuckled and opened his mouth.

"If you've suddenly had a change of heart, are you thinking of leaving the labyrinth soon? You've stayed here for a long time. There are hardly a thousand people left here now. Everyone else has already left. If you leave too...... I'll be a bit lonely."

"Not yet. Not yet."

Taesan replied briefly and thought to himself.

The fact that there were hardly a thousand people left meant that a considerable amount of time had passed since the last return. It meant that Taesan had succeeded in moving through time as he had wanted.

"Thinking about it now, I've left a lot behind. What's the reason for that?"
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$"Easy mode isn't hard. With just a bit of determination, you could clear it in a few years.

So, the fact that tens of thousands of people are still stuck in it is quite strange. The old man at Deoksudong gave me a weird look when I mentioned this.

"It's all your fault, you know."

"What?"

"What do you mean, what? You didn't know? This is quite a shock."

The old man at Deoksudong scowled.

"Most of the people still here are staying for the skills you talked about."

Tae-san finally understood the meaning behind the old man's words.

Tae-san had shared information about the skills he had obtained, including addition, acceleration, jumping, and absolute judgment. He had hidden nothing.

And he had obtained all of these in easy mode.

In other words, the players in easy mode could also obtain the skills that Tae-san spoke of. It was only natural that there were many players in easy mode who longed for power that surpassed hard mode.

But Tae-san was unaware of the fact that so many players were challenging themselves."
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$"I just thought a decent number would do, I never thought I would surpass ten."

"I see you're busy trying to learn new skills, but how about paying attention to your surroundings a bit too. You are an object of admiration for everyone here."

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"'We should move forward, but I'm not that passionate. Even if I go out, I can't follow the enthusiasm of others and will fall behind. It's better to stay here and kill time with everyone, it's more comfortable.'

Taesan couldn't understand Deoksu old man.

So, he persuaded him.

'Let's go out.'

'I'll go out soon too.'

'We can live together.'

That's what he said.

Deoksu old man hesitated, but believed Taesan's words and went out first.

And when Taesan went out...

He no longer existed in the world.

Taesan, who had been looking at Deoksu old man for a moment, opened his mouth.

'Old man.'

'Yes?'

'There's no need to go out.'

'...What are you talking about? Didn't you always tell me to go out?'

'I did, but thinking about it carefully, it doesn't seem so bad to live here.'

'What do you mean?'

Deoksu old man chuckled.

'Well... it's a relief that you said that. I've been worried lately. I think I can stay here a bit longer.'

'Live comfortably. See you next time.'

'Okay, see you next time.'

Deoksu old man bid a leisurely farewell."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan went down into the labyrinth. He had to go further down from here.

Occasionally, monsters appeared and blocked the path, but he had repeated the process thousands, tens of thousands of times. Perhaps it was more than that, and his body had already memorized the response. He continued to conquer the labyrinth and opened a community.

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone] : Ah! Really! Please! This damn labyrinth!]

"Ha."

Taesan burst out laughing.

As soon as he opened the community, he saw numerous posts left by Lee Tae-yeon.

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone] : When can I get out of here! I'm already on the 77th floor! Please, just stop! I want to go back too!]

"It's already the 77th floor, huh."

She continued to leave passionate posts. Taesan, who had been watching her for a moment, uploaded a post.

[Gang Taesan [Easy] : Good luck.]

The posts that had been going up non-stop suddenly stopped. Not long after, a post came up, looking awkward.

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone] : ……What's this? It's awkward.] [Gang Taesan [Easy] : What's up.] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone] : Why are you suddenly speaking so nicely? You usually tell me to get lost.]

Taesan was taken aback by Lee Tae-yeon's words.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I thought about it, and that's how it was. He didn't tolerate Taeyeon's whining. He often treated her coldly.

 Inside, he had jealousy and anger towards Taeyeon.

 Taesan, who was smiling, posted a message.

[Taesan[izi]: I just think my personality has changed.] [Taeyeon[alon]: What's going on? Are you leaving already? Don't go. Don't leave me behind. Let's stay together until I leave...][Taesan[izi]: Shut up. Try harder.]

Taesan turned off the community.

"It feels new."

At that time, what was he like? He was able to recall his long-forgotten self after a long time.

"It's not bad."

* * *

[So.]

Bardley, who had been quiet, asked.

[You didn't come here just to chat with old acquaintances, did you?]

"Of course not."

[What exactly did you come here for? You wouldn't use a fragment if it was something ordinary, would you?]

There was anticipation in Bardley's voice.

Taesan always took actions that exceeded his expectations, and every time, he achieved more than expected. This time, too, Bardley was eager to see what he was aiming for.

"You're expecting it too."

Snap."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan stabbed the monster's neck with a sword. He had already descended to the 94th floor. There wasn't much left until he reached his destination.

"It's a skill."

[What's a skill? Are you kidding me, is it an addition skill?]

"Multiplication."

[...Multiplication?]

"And reset the designated skill. If possible, I'd like to acquire other skills as well, but I'm not sure if it's possible."

Taesan replied calmly.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
