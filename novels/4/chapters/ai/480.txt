Chapter 481

481. 91st Floor. Ouroboros (2)

One of the skills that had reached 100% proficiency was "Evasion".

[Special Active Skill: Evasion] [Mana Consumption: 5] [Proficiency: 100%] [Evades almost all interference directed at you.]

The skill description had become quite brief. But the changed content was certain.

It wasn't just attacks, but evasion from almost all interference directed at him.

The phrase "almost all things" implied that, except for some special cases or situations he couldn't handle, it was virtually all-encompassing.

Lately, he hadn't been able to use Evasion frequently. It was because the enemies he faced were all ones that would crush Evasion with brute force and attack.

However, as a reward for being a mage, the skills he possessed had become his own.

From now on, he would be able to activate Evasion with all his might even in intense battles.

And that wasn't limited to just Evasion.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**Special Active Skill: Counter** [Mana Consumption: 5] [Proficiency: 100%] [Counters almost all enemy attacks. Even if it can't counter, it can still counter, and if it still can't, it can activate Cross Counter.] **Special Active Skill: Cross Counter** [Mana Consumption: 20] [Proficiency: 1%] [Instead of dodging the enemy's attack, it uses the enemy's power to deal even greater damage. It can also be activated against attacks that can be dodged.]

The Counter skill has also reached 100% proficiency.

As a result, a new skill was acquired: Cross Counter.

Counter allows him to counter even attacks that he couldn't counter before, but there were still some impossible attacks. In those cases, instead of dodging, this skill allows him to counter with an even stronger attack.

Taesan had skills that nullified attacks, such as attack invalidation, and skills that erased attacks. These skills were very valuable to him.

**Special Active Skill: Acceleration** [Mana Consumption: 5] [Proficiency: 82%] [Accelerates extremely quickly towards the target. The effect increases the farther away the target is.] **Special Passive Skill: Mind's Eye** [Proficiency: 88%] [An unshaken heart. Unwavering will. Unbreakable spirit. Indomitable fighting spirit. Enlightenment and self-awareness.]

In addition, the proficiency of many skills such as Acceleration, Strong Strike, Leap, and Vital Point Targeting has increased. The amount was too great to check all at once.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I thought it would take a long time to acquire the essential strike, but it seems I can get it faster than I thought.

"I didn't expect my proficiency to rise like this."

But I understood. He had become too strong now. The system that helped adventurers was now only a constraint to him.

It was a part that would have been annoying to a mage. I thought it would be settled someday, and that day was now.

Anyway, it was a good thing for him. It felt like receiving an unexpected gift.

And among the changed skills, there was still a core skill left.

[Special Activation Skill: Essence Insight] [Proficiency: 94%] [Identifies the target's essence. Can determine the source of their power and weaknesses. Can also understand their underlying thoughts and principles. Can glimpse the deepest part of the target. However, if the target's level is higher than the user's or they strongly resist, it is impossible.]

The proficiency of Essence Insight had finally exceeded 90%.

And finally, his reconnaissance proficiency had reached 100%."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When the proficiency of Gap-a reaches 100%, it becomes Scouting. And when Scouting reaches 100%, it evolves into Perfect Scouting.

[Special Activated Skill: Perfect Scouting] [Mana Consumption: 10] [Proficiency: 7%] [Evolved form of Scouting. Can know everything within a certain range. However, it's still unable to know things that are deeply hidden.]

I finally obtained Perfect Scouting.

Of course, there's still a long way to go. My proficiency was only 7%. In my past life, I had reached 100%. It was possible that the effect was insufficient.

But it was still sufficient.

The phrase "knowing everything" was literally true.

Even if it was something he didn't recognize, or something that wasn't in his knowledge, it naturally allowed him to know it.

The strength of Perfect Scouting didn't lie in combat. It was a more useful skill in situations outside of battle.

Taesan looked at Akasha.

"Just wait and see."

[Yes.]

Akasha replied quietly. Taesan activated the skill."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You have activated the essence detection.] [You have activated the complete scan.] [Akasha] [A forgotten goddess's apostle, currently your possession. She is in a state where she doesn't recognize herself.] [She has forgotten the one she served.] [She was an object of reverence and admiration for many people during her lifetime.] [She was…….]

Many unknown, unperceived information about Akasha is flooding my vision.

"'Complete scan is the problem.'

Too much information is appearing. If I raise my proficiency, I can gather only the information I want, but I haven't reached that level yet.

Let's gather only the key information, and I can get a rough idea of the content.

She was an apostle of a forgotten goddess.

It seems she held a crucial position, right next to the goddess.

And except for Akasha herself, there was no existence related to the goddess in this world.

The stars, the sacred relics, even the fragments the goddess used briefly - everything was erased. The fact that not even a speck of information appears with the complete scan means it really doesn't exist in this world.

"'Is it a usurper?'

What is being usurped, and what is being done with what's been usurped.

Even the magicians don't know, which means there's also the power to erase oneself. The name bothered me.

"'I don't know.'

Taesan organized his thoughts and opened the status window."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Kang Tae-san] [Level: 197] [Shield: 39138/39138] [Health: 400665/400665] [Mana: 58458/58458] [Magic: 2488/2488] [Strength: 81827] [Agility: 82958] [Intelligence: 75821] [Attack Power + 26093] [Defense + 14542] [The target is in the best condition.]

Tae-san let out a laugh.

It was truly a monstrous stat. His strength, agility, and intelligence were nearing 100,000. It was a stat that would make his past self, Lee Tae-yeon, look pathetic.

But even this stat didn't show everything about him. The status window only showed what the system could display. His true power lay outside the system.

"Good."

Tae-san muttered to himself and began to check his newly acquired skills and labyrinth rewards.

[Special Activation Skill: Absolute Resistance] [Mana Consumption: 100] [Proficiency: 1%] [Absolute resistance. Can be activated against enemies with higher levels and strength than you. For a very short time, your level becomes equal to theirs. However, after the effect ends, a tremendous burden will fall upon you. This skill has a one-week cooldown.]

"What's this?"

Tae-san let out a dry laugh. He hadn't expected much, but the effect was beyond his imagination.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's amazing to think that I can make someone of a similar level to me in such a short time. If my opponent is someone like Rakiratas or Goshin, it means I can become an existence on par with them.

Although I won against the wizard, it was only because I hardly attacked. If we had fought with all our might, my chances of winning would still be slim.

That skill was what boosted my chances of winning.

Of course, the penalty would be great, but if such an existence was determined to kill me, my chances of survival would be almost zero. If I had the possibility, it would be a sufficiently excellent skill.

Taesan, who was satisfied, checked the 90th floor clear reward.

[Wizard's Hat] [Magic + 200] [Mana + 3000] [Intelligence + 2000] [Attack Power + 300] [Defense + 1000] [A hat used by a wizard who once created a labyrinth. The power and strength still remain in the hat.]

The magic stats were extremely high.

With high intelligence and mana stats, the attack power was also respectable, and the defense was also extremely high at 1000.

It's clear that I've entered a new level of equipment since reaching the 90th floor."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I used it." "I obtained the shining holy sword." "Shining Holy Sword" "Strength +700" "Attack Power +1800" "A holy sword directly given by a god to their beloved apostle. Although the god and apostle are now gone, the power within it still remains unwavering." "When used with divinity, the sword's power increases."

The sword was also quite impressive. Taesan was satisfied and gathered his equipment.

And he headed towards the 91st floor.

The start of a new theme.

It was the starting point that signaled the end of the labyrinth.

As he descended the stairs, the shop owner greeted him as usual. He gazed at Taesan with a deeply ingrained smile.

"You've finally come."

"What do you want from me?" Taesan asked the shop owner. He clearly had something he wanted from Taesan.

"Is what you want here?"

"It might just happen."

The shop owner's smile grew longer.

"With your current abilities, you're more than capable. You can do it. You can... fulfill my long-held desire."

He laughed.

There was no need for perfect detection or essence analysis. His emotions were written all over his face.

"Just a little further, just a little more. And grant my wish. I'll give you a suitable reward."

He muttered to himself.

Taesan left him behind and headed towards the 91st floor.

91st floor.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That place wasn't much different from the previous floors. Rather, it was a fairly ordinary floor.

And the wizard was waiting for Taesan.

"Hello."

"Let's see you again."

"From here on, I'll need to explain, except for special cases, my clone will explain it."

The wizard said so. Upon closer inspection, the wizard's entire body was slightly trembling. As he said, it didn't seem to be his main body.

"Then I'll explain the 91st floor quest first. The 91st floor quest is Ouroboros."

Ouroboros.

At the mention of that name, Taesan's eyes sparkled.

The wizard explained.

"A world of infinite cycles swallowed by a snake, the goal is to go there and achieve your objective, that's the 91st floor quest."

[91st Floor Quest Start.] [Cycle Snake. Ouroboros. Move to the world swallowed by Ouroboros and achieve your desired objective, then return.] [Reward: Returning Flute.] [Secret Reward: ???]
