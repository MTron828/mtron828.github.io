103. Vekweseta, Lamb of the Master (13)

Transcendental Skill. Divine. It was a skill type I had never seen before.

And there's "Half-Body Thesis." It seemed to be a skill related to the gods.

I wanted to confirm it, but there was something I had to do before that.

Tae-san flew back to the demon village. There, he saw Anetsha held captive among countless demons.

"Tae-san!"

Anetsha brightened up upon seeing Tae-san. In stark contrast, the demons grew infinitely darker.

"Ha, hahaha...."

Artenekia let out a bitter laugh.

"Has the Divine Lion... been defeated?"

"Now what are you going to do?"

"...."

Artenekia, who had been staring blankly at Tae-san, finally spoke.

"If someone like you had come just a bit earlier...."

There was a hint of resentment in his voice.

Artenekia nodded to the demons with a bitter smile.

"Let's go, everyone."

"What? No!"

Anetsha hurriedly tried to stop them, but the demons acted swiftly. They drew hidden daggers from their bosoms and stabbed themselves in the neck.
It was a motion filled with surrender, devoid of any fear or resistance. That's how the fifty demons died.

"Ah, aaaa!"

Anetsha rushed to their bodies and screamed.

The demons had abandoned the gods they believed in, even their princess. It must have been a difficult decision.

They had pledged death upon failure, and they kept their promise.

The princess stared blankly at the corpses of her kin.

"...What is this?"

A tired voice echoed. She couldn't hold back and burst into laughter. It was a hollow, empty laughter.

The kin she had sought so hard had betrayed her, and her god.

"Taesan... sir."

Anetsha, who had reached out towards Taesan, lowered her hand.

Taesan was ultimately someone who would leave. He wasn't someone who could stay with her.

Now, she was completely alone.

There was no safe place for her.

Taesan asked her.

"Do you still believe in your god?"

"...."

Unlike before, Anetsha couldn't answer immediately.

With trembling head, she managed to speak at last.

"....Yes."

She bit her lip.
"I still... believe in Him."

With ethereal words, darkness descended.

A deep, overwhelming power spread throughout the world. Darkness gently enveloped the village, covering the corpses of the demons.

"Hm?"

Anetsha raised her head in surprise.

Before her, darkness revealed its form.

[My child.]

Darkness, in the guise of a young girl, gently touched Anetsha's cheek. Anetsha's eyes trembled.

"Mashin... sir?"

[I'm sorry.]

Lucifer's voice carried deep sorrow and gratitude.

[And thank you. Even when everyone else despaired and abandoned me, you never lost faith in me until the end. Do you know how grateful that is to a deity?]

"Ma, Mashin?"

Anetsha couldn't suppress her bewilderment.

[It's an expression of gratitude, my child. Ask for anything you desire, and I shall grant it.]

Anetsha's eyes widened.

Lucifer whispered to her.

[Do you desire revenge, or do you wish to meet your father?]

"......I..."

Blankly staring at Lucifer, Anetsha finally spoke.
"What becomes of those who have forsaken you?"

[At least they won't come back to me.]

Demons originate from the Mashin. The fact that their souls do not return to the Mashin means they are forsaken by everything else.

Anetsha's uncertainty subsided.

"Then please embrace them into your embrace, O great Mashin."

Lucifer smiled at Anetsha's words.

[Understood.]

Darkness enveloped Anetsha.

"Come with me."

And then darkness exploded. Taesan's sight was dyed entirely black.

When vision returned, it was the Mashin's palace.

They had returned to where Anetsha first met the Mashin.

The Mashin sat proudly on their throne as before.

The Mashin spoke.

"The quest is a success, Gang Taesan." [Sub-quest complete.]

The completion window appeared.

"Was this your aim from the beginning?"

Where is a safe place for Anetsha?

At first, they thought it was the land where the demons gathered. But that place was a trap. At least, in Vegevse'ta, there was no place for Anetsha.
"The safest place for the demons would be by the Mashin's side, wouldn't it?

"You said you would end it as soon as you could come down."

"I was aiming for the timing too. There's only one believer left in me, so there's no need to cover my back. And you made a gap by having Hamon send down an angel. It worked out very well."

Lucifer raised the corners of his mouth as if satisfied.

"Is this the end of it?"

The quest is complete. However, Lucifer shook his head.

"That won't do. You did well. You did more than enough."

Lucifer's gaze towards Taesan contained faint emotions.

"So I'll show you something fun."

Lucifer stood up from his throne. At the same time, the palace receded. In an instant, they stood in an empty space.

"Look at that."

Taesan looked in the direction Lucifer pointed.

There was a planet there. It was incredibly beautiful, with blends of blue, white, and green light.

"The universe?"

"That's Vegevse'ta. A world where I no longer have anything."

Lucifer reached out with a chilling smile.
A massive darkness poured out with a rumble. Slowly, it extended towards Vegevse'ta, gradually enveloping it without a gap.

"[Ah....]"

The ghost sighed as if lost for words.

"Very well."

Lucifer clenched his fist.

The darkness condensed, beginning to suppress the stars. Suddenly, as if in rebellion, golden light burst through the darkness.

"This is my world!"

A voice filled with anger echoed from Vegevse'ta.

"This is mine!" "Yes. Now that place is yours."

Lucifer chuckled grimly and strengthened his fist.

"So die with what's yours."

Crunch.

The stars crumpled. The planet crumpled like a PET bottle with the air sucked out.

Squelch. Squelch.

The compressed star began to shrink even more. Before long, the voice filled with rage could no longer be heard.

After a short while, there was nothing left that could be called a planet.

There were only compressed chunks of rock.

"Now, it's truly over."

Lucifer muttered with a relieved expression.

* * *

Returning to Lucifer's palace, Taesan couldn't help but ask.

"Was it necessary to call me?"

Literally a monster.
He completely crushed the stars and planets.

It wasn't entirely without resistance. A being presumed to be Harmon resisted roughly, emitting a golden aura. However, they were swiftly trampled under Lucifer's power.

There was a difference in strength greater than that between a child and an adult. It meant Lucifer could handle everything alone without needing Taesan's assistance.

"Then everything of mine will be destroyed too."

Lucifer said, crossing his legs.

"If I destroy that world, what's mine won't come back to me. Soul, life, will. Everything will be gone. I hate that."

"...Is that Anetsha?"

"Yes."

Lucifer smiled.

"Poor child. And grateful. Despite being rejected and suffering, you didn't give up on me. To save such a child. Not bad."

One thought flashed through Taesan's mind.

He had heard that hard gems refine each other through collision. Gems break each other to create a beautiful form.

At the end, countless gems are discarded, leaving only one beautiful gem behind.
Lucifer leaned back on his throne.

"I'll express my gratitude. Kang Taesan. It's very rare for me to express thanks."

"Is that so."

Taesan cleared his mind. Whatever was the right answer, it was now a matter unrelated to him.

"And he also said to thank you, and to apologize."

"...Is that so."

Anetsha nestled into the witch's embrace.

I won't see her again. Taesan quickly sorted out his emotions.

Lucifer opened his mouth with a joyful expression. Considering he had destroyed an entire world, his attitude was remarkably light.

"You've satisfactorily cleared my quest. So now I suppose I should give you a reward?"

Dark energy flowed from Lucifer's hand into Taesan.

"You have acquired magic." "You have learned [Dark Magic]."

An entirely separate power engulfed Taesan. Something black took hold within him.

"Check your status window."

Following Lucifer's instructions, Taesan opened his status window.
[Kang Taesan] [Level: 45] [Shield: 207/207] [Health: 2400/2400] [Mana: 526/526] [Magic: 10/10] [Strength: 835] [Intelligence: 562] [Agility: 732] [Attack Power +93] [Defense +115] [Target in optimal condition.]

After defeating the angel, level and affinity increases were triggered, significantly boosting stats. Additionally, a new element called "Magic" appeared just below Mana.

"The basic acquisition method is the same as with other elements. It increases as your level rises. But that can be a bit frustrating, right?"

Taesan's level was not low. There was little significance in rising from here.

"So let's provide a service."

Power once again imbued Taesan.

"You have learned the special continuous activation skill [Dark Plunder]." "[It has a similar effect to the skill given to you by Baltaja. Your magic will gradually increase with each enemy killed.]"

With such a skill, using magic became much more convenient. Taesan accepted it gratefully.

"And I will grant you eligibility."

An emblem of darkness appeared before Lucifer. It was etched onto Taesan's palm.

"You have obtained the title [Recipient of the Witch's Favor]."

Lucifer explained.
When you pray to me, you can learn dark magic. Of course, it's not free. Just like the gods of magic, you must offer something in return to me, especially if it's something related to magic.

It seemed that items related to oneself increased in value, just like with the god of magic.

"And I'll provide you with more service." "You have learned the beginner dark magic [Declaravia's Distorted Diet]." "You have obtained the basic dark magic [Raum's Emotional Wavering]."

One beginner dark magic and one basic dark magic. It was an unexpected harvest.

He received more than he had expected. Taesan expressed his gratitude.

"Thank you, O Lord."

"Hehe. That'll do."

The Lord exhaled through his nose. It was a strangely emotional sight.

"Now, there's only one thing left, right?"

Taesan nodded.

Before going to Bequetheta, he asked the Lord for one more thing, and the Lord allowed it. The Lord opened his mouth.

"The beings that destroyed your world. In short, your assumption was correct. They were beings called Transcendents from the moment they were born, now referred to as the Gods."

Taesan's eyebrows twitched. He had expected it, but hearing the confirmation from the god made him feel quite peculiar.

Lucifer continued calmly.
[From the beginning, they were strong. Because of that, they didn't understand the hearts of mortals. Once, all the gods in the world were ancient deities. We took their place and sealed them away. I am no different.]

Lucifer raised his hand. Dark and thick energy gathered there.

[There was a god before me. He was a god from the start. Those who didn't see gods interested in themselves worshiped a small, young girl as a god, and after various processes, the girl became a god.]

Lucifer clenched his fist, breaking through the darkness and grumbled.

[Making a god out of a child who hasn't even grown up. Adults are truly irresponsible, don't you think?]

"I don't know."

[Hmph. Boring.]

Lucifer muttered disdainfully. The ancient gods trampled his world. Naturally, there was something curious.

"Why are you trampling our world?"

[That question is flawed.]

Lucifer replied calmly.

"Because the worlds they trampled aren't just yours. 258 worlds. The number of worlds destroyed by the ancient gods.]
