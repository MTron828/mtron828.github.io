**Episode 505**

**505. 93rd Floor, Demons (4)**

[Ugh!]

Amon let out a painful groan. If he were an ordinary being with a black presence lodged deep in his chest, it would have been enough to take his life.

But he was a demon.

Immutable, he couldn't die. Many transcenders had tried to kill him, but all their attempts had failed.

Taesan would be no different. Amon believed so and tried to escape.

[…Ah?]

But Amon realized something.

The ash-gray color was slowly devouring him.

It was spreading from his chest, engulfing his body and his power with an insatiable hunger.

[Oh, oh, oh!]

Amon was suddenly overwhelmed with fear. It was a thick, dark fear he had never felt before.

It was the fear of death.

[Save me!]

For the first time in his life, Amon begged for his life.

He struggled and tried to escape, but the ash-gray color covered his entire body in an instant.

[Sal...]

The ash-gray color even swallowed his voice.

There, Amon's existence ceased to be.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That body and power. Everything was destroyed and became a part of Taesan's mountain.

"Hmm."

Taesan grasped the new power that had taken root within him. It was the domain that Amon had possessed.

[Your spiritual power has increased. You have seized [Amon]. The throne of Remegaton has been strengthened.] [You have killed a demon. You have acquired the special skill [Demon Slayer].]

"Is that so, demon? Despite the difference in power, my spiritual power has increased."

The concept of spiritual power was different from the general existence of the world, or maybe there was another reason. Originally, it was impossible to increase spiritual power with such a gap, but he was able to seize power effortlessly.

He didn't know the reason, but it was a good story for him. It meant he had gained one more thing against the demon.

Taesan sheathed his sword.

The demons couldn't do anything. They all stood there, staring blankly with their mouths agape.

[What, what's going on?] [What's happening?]

They knew.

Amon's domain had been seized."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No. The existence of Amun has disappeared. The companion who had existed since the dawn of creation, the being who was believed to be immortal, has vanished without leaving a single trace. It was as if they were discarded like trash.

[……What are you! Who are you!]

A loud shout erupts. But no one can approach Taesan. They are overwhelmed by an eerie fear and terror.

"If you don't come, I'll go."

Taesan puts strength into his legs.

[You have activated Chaos Call.] [You have activated Acceleration.] [You have activated Skill Acceleration.]

In an instant, his body disappears from the demons' sight.

When he reappears, it's after he has passed by them.

[Ah?] [Eh?]

The bodies of the five demons are cut down. They fall, unaware of why they are dying.

[Ugh…… Ah…….] [Sa, save me.]

Their power is stolen by the surge in Taesan's energy.

The five demons, who had once killed and ridiculed countless lives, are now powerless and annihilated.

[What, what!]

The demons, now regaining their senses, unleash their power and create distance.

[Everyone! Kill that guy!]

With a fierce cry, the demons' power is unleashed.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!"

"The power of demons over thirty is realized in the world. It's a power that can split planets and overturn continents.

Among them, there was also the dark magic that Taesan had used.

But Taesan's expression didn't change.

Taesan had almost stopped using dark magic from a certain point on.

The reason was simple.

'It's too weak.'

The demons' dark magic was too weak.

They were certainly powerful, but their power had a limit. At best, it was on the level of an immortal. Of course, their power was unmatched, but it still couldn't surpass the limit.

On the other hand, Taesan was stronger than an immortal, surpassing even the gods.

Since the fundamental level of their power was low, it was inefficient to mix it with dark magic. It was much stronger to use high-level magic instead.

The only exception was Baal's dark magic. All other dark magic was below par.

"So, you're no longer needed."

He clears everything up. A demon with a fully red body clenches his fist, and a material in the shape of flames erupts from it.

Taesan knew who that demon was.

'Marcothias.'"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A demon handling a material with a flame-like shape. The temperature of that material was capable of melting the sun.

[Melt away!]

Markosias covered the entire mountain with the material. In an instant, the entire mountain was covered.

Markosias's face brightened momentarily.

But the flame-like material burst out, piercing through the ash-colored substance. The mountain's hand grasped Markosias's neck.

[Ugh! Ah, how!]

'You can't pierce through with just brute force; it's not enough to just melt the sun.'

Crunch.

He applied force to his hand. Markosias's neck broke. At the same time, the ash-colored substance rose up and seized Markosias's domain.

Waaaah!

And roots burst out of the ground.

The roots were more like a thick wall, piercing through the planet itself. Dekaravia's twisted vegetation.

The mountain also used to wield dark magic.

Kukukuku!

[Die, pierced!]

Dekaravia, shaped like a tree, shouted coarsely. The mountain, seeing the roots rushing towards itself, waved its hand.

'Bardley.'

[Got it.]

Bardley was dyed with ash color. The mountain threw Bardley towards the roots just like that.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Chaos!"

Bardley splits the roots like bamboo and charges forward. Dekaravia's face changes rapidly. He tries to call out the roots quickly to stop him, but Bardley pierces through everything.

"Kwaduk."

A sword is thrust into Dekaravia's chest.

And the ash-colored explosion tears his body apart.

"[Eeek!]"

A demon with a head three times larger than a human's barely reaches the back of Taesan. He places both hands on Taesan's head.

"[Collapse!]"

A powerful mental interference tries to intervene with Taesan.

Raum's emotional disturbance. Taesan, due to his lack of skill, could only show what a human could imagine.

But Raum's direct use of emotional disturbance could show something beyond that.

Just by thinking about it, he could make himself forget and empty his emotions.

"It won't work."

"Kwajik."

"[Kuh!]"

Emotional disturbance or not. Even without the ash color, it could affect Taesan. In an instant, Raum also faces death.

"Kurururung!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Many demons combine their powers. A black lightning bolt strikes, and a dark thread tries to pierce through the Taesan. Numerous powers, including the storm's arrow, charge towards Taesan.

Taesan lightly waves his hand.

[You have activated Baal's Dark Space Slash.]

The darkened space crushes and shatters all their powers. The aftermath alone is enough to tear the demons' bodies apart.

[Ahhhh!]

The demons, who were attacking in a panic, slowly come to their senses.

[Oh no.]

The ones who were feared by people, who had dominated many for a long time, are now dying one by one like trash.

There is no way to win. Absolutely not.

One demon trembles and shouts.

[Surrender! We surrender! We lost!]

The other demons come to their senses at his cry.

The condition for ending the duel. It is for them to declare their defeat.

The demons who realized this fact declare one by one.

[I lost!] [Stop! Stop! We surrender!]

Baal, who was watching this scene, couldn't help but laugh.

[Really, truly, they are pitiful. They have killed many lives and are so afraid of their own deaths. You are really... useless.]

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ba'al wore a twisted smile.

["You're all going to die. It's beneficial for all of us."] ["Surrender!"] ["We lost! We're defeated!"]

The demons shouted in unison. One demon declared defeat and seemed to think they had survived, its expression brightening.

Thud.

But the black sword of Taesan pierced its chest and devoured it.

[Ugh...] [What's going on! Why! We lost!] [The end of the duel is when one group declares defeat. I clearly said so. You all have to declare defeat.]

Ba'al spoke calmly. Only then did the demons realize that no one had declared defeat.

[Who is it! Who didn't do it!] [Aaah! What kind of guy is this!]

They desperately tried to find the one who hadn't declared defeat. But in a situation where their lives were in danger, it was practically impossible to find the culprit.

Thud thud!

[Ugh... ugh... ugh...]

One by one, they died.

The demons also realized they couldn't retreat.

But they still didn't fight back.

["Run away!"]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They turned their backs on Taesan and started to flee. Taesan let out a dry laugh.

"Looks like they'd rather run than fight. What a disappointment."

They fled with desperate faces, but didn't get far before being blocked by a massive wall.

[Put your lives on the line and fight, you scum. This is your last struggle.]

Ba'al spoke calmly.

Taesan grasped his sword and slowly approached them.

[Ah, ahh, ahh!]

The demons, in a state of despair, charged towards Taesan. Taesan swung his sword.

[Kwaaaang!]

Another demon was struck by the sword and disappeared. The realm that had existed since the dawn of time, which was theirs, began to distort and change into Taesan's possession.

Taesan raised his hand.

[You have activated the Great Collapse [Chaos].]

Kuuuuung!

The magic of Chaos crushed the demons and shattered them.

There was no escape, no victory.

Overwhelming despair engulfed the demons. Some of them drooled and lost their minds, staring blankly into space.

[…Ba'al!]

Someone let out a loud cry. He rushed towards Ba'al like a madman, but an invisible barrier blocked his approach.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You were trying to kill us from the start!]

Baal smiled quietly.

He was about to shout something, but the black sword of Taesan pierced through his back.

Crunch.

One by one, the demons disappeared.

And finally, only the last demon was left.

He was an old man. Wearing a neat suit, he was quietly standing still, like a secretary, without doing anything while Taesan was eliminating the demons.

The old man opened his mouth.

"[Are you satisfied?]" "[Yes.]"

Baal appeared beside them.

"[Thank you. Beaufrons. I asked you to do it, but I was half-doubting whether you would really do it.]" "[My king is you. If you say so, I will follow anything.]"

The old man smiled faintly.

"[More than anything, I didn't like my own kind either.]"

Taesan realized why the duel hadn't ended.

For the duel to end, all the demons had to declare their defeat. But the old man in front of him was on Baal's side. He had deliberately not declared defeat to let Taesan kill the demons.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Was this the condition from the beginning?"

Baal had been trying to kill demons since he was called to this place.

[This was a chance to tidy things up neatly. It couldn't be missed.] [Then, Lord Baal.]

The old man bowed his head towards Taesan's sword.

[May you achieve what you desire.] [Thank you. Farewell. Beaufrons.]

Taesan's sword pierced the old man's chest. The old man silently accepted his death.

The power within him began to flow into Taesan.

Taesan had taken over thirty-eight demon territories. The demon territories he possessed began to mix with numerous other territories, transforming into something entirely different.

[[Black Magic] has changed.] [The beginner black magic [Marcothias' Fake Flame] has been deleted.] [The beginner black magic [Decarabia's Distorted Vegetation] has been deleted.] [The beginner black magic [Marbas' Dark Wave] has been deleted.]

...

...

The system window won't stop.

And that's not the end.

The throne of Remegaton began to transform into something else.

[[Remegaton's Throne] has evolved into [Part of Evil].]
