**Chapter 506**

506. 93rd Floor, Demons (5)

Thirty-eight. If Taesan had reached the realm of Belial, which he originally had, it would be a total of thirty-nine.

Thirty-nine demon realms were gathered inside Taesan.

Each one was an extremely old and powerful existence that had been around since the dawn of creation. All their realms were mixed together to become one within Taesan.

Taesan took a deep breath and observed himself.

Something new had taken its place inside him.

And it was enormous.

Taesan raised his hand, and magic erupted instantly.

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung!

Dark magic poured out all at once.

The roots that could split the world, the flames that could melt the sun, and the pillars that could pierce through the continent.

Everything was realized in an instant. In a flash, Baal's realm was greatly shaken. Baal's expression changed.

[Oh.]

Taesan opened his skill window.

[Dark Magic] [You can freely control the powers within your realm.]

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"My proficiency has disappeared. But it didn't weaken. To be exact, it had transcended the concept of proficiency. The long content was condensed into a single sentence.

Black magic had become a perfect part of Taesan's body.

When he handled black magic, the system window didn't appear.

When he controlled his own body to attack, the system window didn't appear either. That's because it was something he inherently possessed, his most basic ability.

Black magic had now become his perfect limb, and it no longer appeared as a system window.

In reality, all black magic skills except for Baal's had been deleted from the skill window.

Taesan gazed at the system window, which was now empty.

[Part of Evil] [The remaining collection of all evil. What it will become depends on your choice.]

The existence of demons had disappeared from this world, and the phrase 'demon' had vanished without a trace.

And as a result, the heterogeneous things that remained inside Taesan were mixed with the domains of all demons.

[What about it?]

"I still don't know well," Taesan shook his head in response to Baal's question.

It was too vast and broad. It was a size that couldn't be grasped in a short time. He needed to take a little more time to understand it clearly."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When the primordial realm is mixed and merged, such a result occurs. I have a memory from a very long time ago... This is interesting. Fascinating."

Ba'al applauded.

"A satisfactory result. Thank you."

"You intended to kill them from the beginning, didn't you?"

"I said so. There was a need to remove the defective products."

Ba'al turned his gaze away. The plain was devastated by the aftermath of the battle, but not a single remnant of any power remained.

The evidence that demons existed in this world had completely disappeared.

Ba'al had a very satisfied expression on his face.

"You've returned to where you originally belonged. You did well, Taesan."

"Is it okay? The aftermath is quite large, isn't it?"

The power of demons that the demon tribe could wield through their contract with the demon god. Dark magic took up a large part of their abilities.

Now, those demons had been erased from the universe. The demon tribe could no longer wield dark magic.

Although they were considered defective products, they were beings that maintained the balance of the world, so there was bound to be an aftermath. But Ba'al spoke calmly.

"Don't worry about it. I've already finished discussing that part with the demon god."

"......Is that so."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Mashin knew all these facts, it seemed.

[Anyway, the beneficial influences those things had on the world were nothing but that. And that was something Mashin and I could handle with our powers. There was no problem at all.]

Baal laughed with a cheerful face, genuinely delighted.

[I finally got rid of the things I've always wanted to get rid of. Thank you.]

"Then, I'd like to hear the story slowly."

Baal and Mashin had wished for the demons' death. But they didn't know the reason yet.

[There were various reasons, but... I wanted to confirm it directly first.]

"What are you talking about?"

[I've always wanted to get rid of those disgusting, trash-like existences.]

Baal's voice was filled with undisguised contempt.

[They were just born that way, with everything unchanging. Existences with no meaning. But it was impossible. They were unchanging, and wouldn't die.]

"Can't you just erase them?"

Baal, too, was not a being of this world. He was a similar existence to Goshin. But Baal shook his head."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'm impossible. I made a contract with the demons when I expelled the gods, so direct interference was impossible. I used loopholes to erase them one by one whenever I had the chance, but still, many of them survived."

Ba'al takes a step back. The world folds in on itself like paper.

"It's impossible for anyone in this world to kill them. But you did it."

The world folds perfectly, and a space like white light appears.

"You can erase them. You're a being capable of perfectly killing the expelled gods."

"Did you want to confirm that?"

"I heard the story, but I didn't see it myself. I wanted to confirm it before they came back."

Ba'al raises his hand. A powerful force that warps the space-time axis gathers within it.

"Then I'll show you the truth of the world."

Ba'al clenches his fist.

The condensed force explodes, and the space-time axis collapses. The world distorts, and they jump to somewhere else.

"Uh..." "Hmm..."

Bardley and Akasha hold their breath. Their souls slowly begin to crumble. Ba'al waves his hand with a belated realization on his face.

"I think you two can't handle it. Take a nap for now."

Note: Ba'al is a name that appears in various mythologies, including ancient Mesopotamian and biblical traditions. In this context, it seems to be used as a character's name.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His power enveloped Bardray and Akasha. Baal's power protected the two.

Bardray and Akasha had also become incredibly strong. They had withstood the attacks of the worthless ones without losing themselves.

But even the two of them couldn't withstand the power of this space and were about to collapse.

Taesan judged that it was impossible to continue resisting with his bare body and wrapped himself in chaos.

Taesan quietly observed his surroundings.

It was a distorted space.

Even Taesan, who had encountered numerous gods and directly confronted the high gods, was seeing unfamiliar and strange things for the first time.

"...It's huge and powerful."

Powers beyond his comprehension existed here.

Even if he only grasped a small fragment of it, he could wield power that could shake the universe.

And Taesan could sense familiar energies within it.

Maria, Zerband, Lakiratas, Lucifer.

No. It wasn't just the gods he knew. There were powerful beings he didn't know, but were on par with him. The energies of concept gods that surpassed dozens of others were mixed in this space.

Taesan turned his gaze.

Beyond the mixed space, there was a single wall.

"...Just for a moment."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan finally realized what the wall was.

The power and strength of the concept gods surrounding him had created that wall.

The energy swirling around him was all just remnants of that.

And beyond the wall, something was visible.

Taesan realized where he was and what it was.

"The boundary of exile."

[That's right.]

Ba'al nodded his head.

[This is the place where the high gods were exiled. It's the boundary of their seal.]

* * *

Ba'al slowly approached the wall.

[You also know about our past, don't you?]

"Yes."

A very long time ago, the Transcendents and the High Gods clashed over the dominance of the world.

And the winners were the Transcendents. They emerged victorious after numerous sacrifices, defeating the High Gods.

But the High Gods were unchanging, and they couldn't be killed. They were beings that the existences of this world couldn't handle.

[We clearly won. I also couldn't kill the High Gods, so I chose to exile them from this universe. Although there was some interference from beyond the seal, it was sufficient to respond to it.]

Note: "Transcendents" and "High Gods" are translations of the Korean terms "" and "" respectively, which may have different connotations or implications depending on the context of the story.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The gods' intervention was not that great. Even the weak Taesan could handle it to some extent.

[But a problem is arising.]

Something is stirring beyond the wall.

A being that cannot be described in any language or expression of this universe, with a form that cannot be grasped.

It was gazing at Taesan and Baal.

Ku-gung….

It moved its body. Its form heavily pounded on the wall.

Taesan reflexively prepared to defend himself.

Tzzzzz!

The wall shook.

A ripple spread through the absolute wall that transcended the boundaries of the world, created by all the transcenders.

Baal laughed.

[As usual. Not tired at all.]

The being on the other side glanced at this place, gazing at Baal and Taesan for a moment, then slowly retreated.

Taesan relaxed his defensive stance.

That wall is absolute. Even a conceptual god cannot leave a single scratch on it alone.

Despite knowing that, his instincts reflexively made him take a defensive stance.

"Gods."

That indescribable something was the true self of the gods.

And Taesan realized one fact.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

There was a very small crack in the part where the divine sword had collided.

It was extremely small. It was a size that wouldn't be visible unless one focused their attention, like a tiny mountain.

But it was a clear crack.

[There is nothing eternal in this universe.]

Ba'al stroked the new crack and said,

[The expulsion of the divine swords created by all the transcenders is absolute, but it will slowly fade away over time.]

The entire wall came into Taesan's field of vision.

There were hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, or more cracks.

It was hard to find a part without cracks.

[The seal is weakening, and it's happening quickly.]

"I thought there was still some time left," the wizard said. "Until a shining star loses its light, we can hold out."

The thing that could extremely compress that time was the boundary line that Taesan possessed. That's why the divine swords were targeting Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was originally like that. But from some point on, the seal has been weakening faster than we expected. To be honest, it's alarming how fast it's happening. If this continues, it won't last long."

"Why is this happening?"

"Many transcenders have searched for the reason, but no answer has been found. We don't know if our calculations are wrong or if there's some kind of interference."

"……."

Taesan closed his mouth. Baal continued speaking.

"Although it's unexpected, we can't just sit back and do nothing. The reason I've been dealing with the demons is precisely that. There's no reason to let them strike us from behind someday."

Baal took his hand off the gold.

"That's all I can say. The rest is for the transcenders, including Mashin, to hear directly."

Taesan nodded with a sunken gaze.

Baal pointed at Taesan with his finger.

"In a way, I deceived you."

Baal's initial quest was to participate in the meeting. However, his true goal was the death of the demons. He didn't tell Taesan that fact.

"It doesn't matter. We got what we wanted anyway."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I thought I would answer like that. But if I don't give a sufficient reward, there's someone who will get extremely angry. It's ambiguous whether it's an apology, but I'll give a suitable reward.

The power of Baal dwells within Taesan. It was something heterogeneous that didn't exist in this world.

"Take it. This is the power I've had since I existed as myself."] [You have obtained the high-grade dark magic [Baal's shattered fragment].]
