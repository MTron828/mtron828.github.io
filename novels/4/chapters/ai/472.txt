Chapter 473

473. 89th Floor, Gosin's Outpost (6)

To defeat Paradise, he had to break through the power he possessed.

The simplest way to do this was to use the Chaos Domain. By distorting the laws and concepts of the world itself, he could even crush Gosin's power.

However, the boundary line was already severely depleted. A large amount of energy had been used to forcibly normalize the stopped time.

The Chaos Domain was a power that could only be used once, even in a state of perfect preparation. The risk of using it immediately was too great.

And there was no need to rely on the Chaos Domain.

While the Chaos Domain was a power close to omnipotence, Taesan was confident that he could defeat Paradise even without it.

Taesan, who had already fought against Iteon, knew the method.

Taesan grasped his sword tightly. Paradise's body trembled.

Suddenly, the air changed. Taesan summoned his magic.

[You have activated Marbas's Black Wave.] [You have activated Starlight Arrow.] [You have activated Mana Storm.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Suddenly, dozens of magic and dark magic were implemented in the world. Taesan rapidly rotated his body around Paradise, continuously consuming mana and magic. Just as he was about to fire his gun, Paradise realized something.

Taesan's power was literally covering the entire world.

To the left was a storm, to the right was a black wave, in front was a beam of light, behind was a wave of cold air, and above was a space shrouded in darkness.

The entire field of vision was blocked by magic and dark magic, and nothing could be seen.

Paradise hastily detected Taesan's presence and took aim, but Taesan responded simply.

[You have activated stealth.] [You have activated Baal's overlapping darkness.]

Taesan's presence disappeared.

All Paradise could feel was the magic rushing towards him.

"Ridiculous! That's right, though!"

Paradise revealed his intentions.

"I cannot hide my body from my own authority!"

He roughly turned his body and fired his gun.

Ta-a-a-ang!

Ka-a-a-ang!

The bullet's time was reversed. Its trajectory was bent countless times, chasing after Taesan.

Paradise's authority, which possessed infinite possibilities, would repeat itself until it reached the desired answer. Even if Paradise himself didn't know the answer, it was the same. No matter how hard he tried to hide, it was impossible to escape the bullet.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ka-ga-ga-gak!"

But the returning bullet doesn't stop.

It repeats and repeats, but ultimately can't find the answer and pierces through the air.

"What, why..."

Taesan's always-active skill. The one who hides in the shadows.

Due to its effect, attacks that can't detect Taesan will never hit him.

Unless the probability is 0, the infinitely repeated possibilities will eventually succeed.

But if the probability is 0 from the start, there's no effect to be seen. Paradise hastily loaded his gun. But Taesan's magic, which had already reached his vicinity, had already taken over the surroundings.

The closer he got, the slower it became, but it was impossible to simply dodge the attacks that occupied the surroundings.

Paradise quickly thought. Using a handgun could create an opening, but Taesan would surely be waiting for that gap.

Then, he'll break through with his body.

Taesan's magic wasn't that strong. If he could withstand the moderate damage, he could break through.

Note: "카가가가각!" is an onomatopoeia, often used to describe a loud, explosive sound.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Paradise had decided to break through the wave of cold energy with his body. Compared to other magic, it was relatively weak, and he could break through with minimal damage.

"Hmph!"

The cold energy enveloped his entire body. Paradise gritted his teeth and endured, successfully breaking through.

"I knew you'd do that."

But that was exactly what Taesan had anticipated.

What entered Paradise's field of vision after breaking through Taesan's magic was a golden, overlapping great explosion.

Breaking through with his body. That was the correct answer, targeting the weak point.

Taesan had also predicted that and had already activated a sacred, merged great explosion in advance.

A brilliant, shining golden sphere filled Paradise's field of vision.

He thought he had broken through, but a new attack awaited him. If he had been a bit more calm, he would have realized that the great explosion was a trap. But Paradise reflexively drew his gun.

Bang!

The bullets bounced back and destroyed the great explosion.

Taesan didn't miss that opportunity.

[You have activated Mana Storm [Chaos].]

Kagagagak!

A gray storm swept in.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In an instant, Paradise's entire body was torn apart. Paradise let out a painful cry and hastily retreated, but its entire body was already in a state of disarray.

"'Can you take this? You're tougher than I thought.'

"Yes, you bastard!"

Taesan charged at Paradise. The cooldown time was 10 seconds. There was no reason to hold back. He had to gain as much advantage as possible during that time.

He swung his sword, imbuing it with a grayish hue. As the boundary line slowed down, he resisted and targeted Paradise. Paradise pulled out a dagger and somehow managed to block the attack.

Clang!

If both were in top condition, Paradise would have been unable to block Taesan's attack. However, the slowed-down time also affected the boundary line.

Some resistance was possible, but it was only about half the usual speed.

"Perfect resistance is difficult."

That was a power related to the domain. Unless he activated the Chaos Domain or wrapped his entire body with the boundary line, it seemed difficult to perfectly resist the slowing power.

Thanks to that, Paradise was barely able to gain 10 seconds.

However, to use a gun, he had to load the bullets first."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Paradise gritted his teeth and took a step back. He was prepared to take the damage and reload, and indeed, he had to take the damage.

Kwajik.

A sword created a large wound on Paradise's side.

Thanks to that, Paradise was able to take a step back successfully. He suppressed a painful groan and finished reloading.

[You activated a random Blink.]

Taesan moved behind Paradise. After identifying his position, he quickly gathered his mana.

[You activated Great Collapse [Chaos].] [You activated Magic Acceleration.] [You activated Skill Acceleration.] [You activated Limited Blink.]

He implemented Great Collapse behind him and then moved forward to charge.

In front of Paradise was Taesan, and behind him was the Great Collapse of Chaos. Paradise's eyes trembled.

No matter how many possibilities he turned back, he couldn't pierce both the front and back with a single bullet.

The opponent's possibilities were forced into a larger framework, and Paradise's eyes moved quickly. He finally made his choice.

Ta-daang!

The gun was fired towards Taesan.

And that was not the correct answer.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Your third attack has been absolutely nullified.]"

"What the...!"

Paradise couldn't hold back and cursed. The massive explosion behind him erupted.

"Uggghhh!"

Paradise rolled on the ground. Taesan swiftly swung his sword, leaving a large wound on his back.

But Paradise didn't fall.

He desperately got back up and reloaded his gun.

"What's with this guy's toughness?"

Taesan clicked his tongue. Despite being attacked at the boundary, he was still standing. His physical abilities seemed ordinary, but he was incredibly resilient.

"It doesn't change anything, though."

Taesan continued to cast his magic. The world became distorted, the earth crumbled, and the sky split open.

Ka-ga-gak!

Taesan opened his inventory. The self-aware sword flew freely, confusing Paradise.

"I, I, I!"

Paradise stumbled, feeling pressured by the slowly approaching magic, and used his gun as soon as the 10-second timer was up.

And it was a misfire. The bullet was wasted, and Taesan took advantage of the opening again.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's ultimately paradise when you use your authority. It forces a situation where you can't even think, and you can't make a rational judgment. And if you're led just a little bit, the authority of possibility is wasted in vain.

In the end, no matter how powerful the authority is, there's always a weakness that can be exploited depending on the user.

When I faced Lee Tae-yeon, I created a situation and condition that she couldn't understand through simulation and won.

Kuuuuung!

The scars on Paradise's body continue to grow.

His face, which had been enduring somehow, started to turn pale.

[You have activated the World Sword.]

The World Sword is realized, and its color turns to ash.

Paradise fires a gun, and the World Sword clashes with it, shattering each other.

The remnants of the shattered sword pierce through the mountain and aim at Paradise.

The fear of death looms on Paradise's face.

"I, my lord! I offer this world to you! Please defile this world!"

Kiiiiing!

The world tries to stop.

Five minutes have passed without notice.

But Taesan is now thinking of ending it.

[You have activated the Chaos Domain.]

Considering the remaining amount of black energy, the duration of the Chaos Domain is at most a few seconds.

I'll end it within that time."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The world of ash swallowed the stopped world.

Even under the influence of slowed time, it was in a state of perfect liberation.

Blame.

"Wait a minute!"

Paradise was shocked.

Until now, Taesan had been releasing the stopped world at the boundary, but some delay was necessary. However, the Chaos Realm had completely suppressed the power of the gods.

Quack!

"Ugh!"

The sword pierced Paradise's heart. He spat out blood. His vitality began to drain from his entire body.

"I! I!"

He tried to shout something, but the ash swallowed everything.

"Next time, it won't be the avatar, but the gods themselves will come down."

Quack.

Taesan deeply embedded the sword.

And the power and aura within it began to emerge.

It was trying to escape from Paradise's physical body and return to its original owner in another dimension.

"Let go."

Taesan smiled and pulled out the aura.

With the proficiency of the Life Seed skill reaching 40%, he could now directly control the rise of his spiritual power.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It tramples and suppresses the power that tries to escape. And it forcibly confines it within the Taesan. It struggles and resists, as if it doesn't want to be eaten, as if it wants to return to its original owner, but it crushes everything with its might.

And in the end, a massive entity is confined within the Taesan.

[You have defeated the Avatar of the Time Walker.] [You have forcibly eliminated numerous possibilities and achieved victory. You have acquired the special activation skill [Denial of Possibility].] [You have seized the transcendent [Time Interference].]

At the same time, Taesan felt a sensation he had never experienced before. He could understand what he could do with it and where his limits lay.

So Taesan couldn't help but laugh.

Now, he could interfere with the world's time."

Note: "Taesan" appears to be a proper noun, possibly a character's name or a location. I've left it untranslated as it may have a specific meaning in the context of the story.
