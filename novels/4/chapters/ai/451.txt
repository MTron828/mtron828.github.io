**Chapter 452**

452. The Seventh Return, Earth (4)

The European players who had followed Taesan were all stunned.

With blank faces or faces that looked like they were gazing at an absolute being, they stared at Taesan.

Daniel, who had barely regained his composure, spoke to Taesan in a trembling tone.

"I knew it was going to be tough, but I didn't think it would be this bad... If you're here, we can all survive."

"No."

Taesan shook his head.

"The enemy won't allow that. They'll give us a quest like that."

All players on Earth gathered in Las Vegas.

The quest conditions were met, and a new quest was given.

[Special Quest Start] [Choose Your Representative.] [The designated player will become your representative and can give orders and direct actions to you.] [To become the representative, more than half of the players must agree.]

The gazes of those who read the quest naturally fell on Taesan.

"What's this... Is there anyone else besides Taesan?"

"There's no other option."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan did not refuse. Under these conditions, anyone else but him could not have become the representative.

From an efficiency standpoint, it would have been better for Kim Hwiyeon or Oliver to become the representative, but people from other continents would not have acknowledged them as such.

It was the same in the previous life.

People from each country strongly insisted that their leader should become the representative of humanity, and in the process, bloody conflicts even occurred.

Since a majority's approval was necessary, Taesan had no choice but to become the representative.

Taesan said to them:

"I won't directly lead people from now on. The leaders of each country will give instructions as they have until now. You guys coordinate and come up with a decision."

People nodded. The leaders of each country had done their best to lead them so far. If they coordinated, there would be no one to reject their words.

A conclusion was reached, and a new quest appeared once again.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Special Quest Begins] [Monsters are coming for you.] [Waiting period: 20 days.] [Defense area: The mainland of the United States, excluding Alaska and islands.] [Defeat the enemies that will come for a month and protect the pillars that will be created in each region.] [The number of destroyed pillars will affect the next quest.]

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

A loud rumbling sound echoed simultaneously. A blue pillar rose from the ground into the air.

"Huh?"

"What's going on? The mainland of the United States?"

People who read the quest were shocked. The quest conditions themselves weren't that special. It was just another defense quest they had been doing all along.

But the scope was the problem.

The mainland of the United States. The entire area was the quest site.

Even excluding Alaska and islands, it was ridiculously vast. People were in an uproar.

"How are we supposed to block this?"

"This is an impossible quest..."

Discontent and shock erupted over the impossible quest. People were confused. Negative emotions spread like wildfire.

It was the moment when leaders, including Kim Hwi-yeon, tried to calm people down.

"Quiet."

Taesan spoke up.

His soft voice spread to all of humanity.

In an instant, the confusion subsided. They closed their mouths and looked at Taesan.

"We can win."

A statement without any basis or logic.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But with those words, the confusion disappeared. The belief that they could overcome anything with their combined strength began to take root in everyone's eyes.

A strong and deep faith flowed into them from him.

Taesan, who had grasped his faith, spoke up.

"Since we've settled this, let's start."

"Ah, yes."

Kim Hwi-yeon hastily nodded his head.

* * *

The first thing they needed to do was to assess the number of players. They had to figure out the total number of survivors and the ratio of each mode.

Since there were so many people left, it took a whole day just to complete that task.

And the conclusion was reached.

"There are about... 100,000 in the Alone mode, which is worth considering as a significant force. If we exclude that, there are 300,000 in Hard mode, 700,000 in Normal mode, and about 100 million in Easy mode."

"100 million, huh."

Oliver murmured with a bitter smile. It wasn't a small number. But the human population had exceeded 7 billion, and it had decreased to 1/35 of that. It was only natural to feel a sense of despair.

However, Taesan's expression was not gloomy.

Even if only 500,000 people had survived, he would have judged it to be not bad.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Earth of the past was precarious and desperate. After several returns, they finally found stability, but before that, countless people died in vain.

This was an achievement that surpassed what he had initially expected.

They quickly grasped their emotions. Having confirmed the number of survivors, it was now time to deal with the issue of shelter.

There was no problem with food. The temporary farm was almost omnipotent in terms of food supply.

However, the issue of sleeping arrangements was a problem.

"Hmm..."

"Where are we going to put all these people to sleep?"

Although the transcended beings didn't mind the discomfort of sleeping arrangements, the human psyche was a crucial aspect. Since they still couldn't let go of their human hearts, their mental state was greatly affected by their living conditions.

The number of people was too great to be accommodated in a city like Las Vegas. They had to scatter across many cities, which would make management difficult.

Taesan, however, solved their worries with a simple solution.

"Get up and take shape."

[You have activated the Declaration of Formation.]

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The ground trembles. People scream and stumble.

"Enemies!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Oliver prepared to face the monster that would suddenly appear, armed with his weapon.

But the trembling earth created things that he couldn't even imagine.

Kugugung!

The earth rose up and took shape. Hundreds, thousands of massive buildings suddenly appeared on the vast plain.

In an instant, centered around Las Vegas, enormous buildings materialized.

At first, people were bewildered by the incomprehensible events, but soon they realized that Taesan had done it and entered the buildings.

And they couldn't help but gasp in amazement.

The interior of the buildings made of earth was perfect. There were many rooms, and structures that looked like beds were abundant.

The beds, despite being made of earth, were incredibly soft. The people who obtained a place to sleep cheered.

Taesan didn't stop there. The buildings were enormous and tall, but they seemed vulnerable to the monsters' attacks.

[You have activated the Sacred Land Creation.]

Note: "Kugugung" is an onomatopoeic word that is difficult to translate, but it's often used to describe a loud, rumbling sound, like thunder or an earthquake.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The realm of gold is realized. On Earth, as much as direct faith is received, the lack of divinity does not occur. The revived divine power is bestowed upon the entire sacred land. The power grows the sacred land to its limits, as far as its abilities allow.

As a result, the sacred land surpasses Las Vegas, encompassing all the buildings created by Taesan.

"Wow..."

People gasped in amazement at the golden realm, reminiscent of a myth.

Even Diana and Beldegencia couldn't help but be astonished.

"The sacred land... how did you create this without being a transcendent being?"

Taesan expanded his senses, increasing the range of his divine influence.

"Rise."

[You have activated the Wall of Declaration.]

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

A massive wall protecting the pillars created across the United States has emerged.

A massive wall also appeared around the pillar in the center of Las Vegas, encasing it, causing people to stumble backward in shock.

"I'll give you time to catch your breath."

It was a declaration filled with strong determination. Even an S-grade monster couldn't easily destroy it.

People were stunned.

Buildings were created, and a massive wall formed around the pillar. Moreover, the golden realm gently enveloped them.

It was a power akin to creating the heavens and the earth.

"Taesan... this is..."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Players from the US and Europe, excluding Asia, began to praise Taesan with reverence.

Those who had survived until now did not believe in God.

The reason was simple.

There was no such thing as a miracle.

They couldn't do anything to save their families and acquaintances, and people died without a care. The God they had longed for did not save them.

Those who had fled to a non-existent God could not survive.

But now, Taesan was showing a power akin to a miracle, and was bestowing it upon them.

Those who had lost their faith began to regain it.

Their target was Taesan.

[The proficiency of Divine Power increased by 1%.]

* * *

"Hmm."

A strong belief was rooted in Taesan. An extremely thick faith filled his mind.

Taesan quietly gathered his faith and moved. He headed towards a place where Beldegencia was.

"How's it going?"

"No problem."

Beldegencia was drawing a magic circle.

Taesan had asked him for a teleportation magic. With many people surviving, the scope of the quest was broad, and it was a correct judgment.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"108 pillars have appeared all over the United States. Since each one needs to be protected, a lot of attention is required, and a means of rapid transportation is necessary.

If it were Belzengki's magic, it would be more than enough.

"The location is fixed, so it's easy to create. Let's try it once."

Belzengki, who had drawn the entire magic circle, stepped back.

The magic circle was enormous. It was large enough to transport thousands of people at once.

Taesan stepped onto it.

In an instant, the magic enveloped him, and when the light disappeared, he had moved to a different location.

"Is this New York?"

Taesan, who had grasped the location, returned to Las Vegas through the magic circle again.

"How is it?"

"It's okay. Can we create it in every city with a pillar?"

"That's impossible. I have to draw the magic circle myself, but I don't have enough time. I'll try my best, but I think I can only do about half of it."

"Then, spread it out as widely as possible. Make it possible to move quickly."

"Got it."

The means of transportation was prepared. They could now move directly to the cities that were being pushed.

However, to do so, a communication method was necessary to alert them to the danger.

Many scientists and technicians gathered to discuss communication methods for that purpose."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They were worried about how to communicate in a world where everything was destroyed.

If they had a base station, they could communicate across the entire United States, but most of the base stations were destroyed. They could somehow repair them, but they only had twenty days to do so. There was no time to repair them.

Taesan solved their worries.

He gathered his powers and declarations and made a declaration.

"Reconstruct!"

[You have activated the Machine King.] [You have activated the King's Declaration.]

Kiying!

Although he didn't know about machines, his powers were different.

Many devices returned to their original state. The destroyed base stations began to operate again.

"Is this enough?"

"Yes..."

People nodded their heads in amazement.

The problem of communication was also solved.

Every time Taesan moved, things that were believed to be impossible were being solved one by one.

People's faith grew stronger and stronger. And that faith became a direct power for Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Whenever my divine power increases, Taesan realized that the level and quality of the divinity he possesses surpasses what he had before.

And beyond that, something came into view.

It was a lofty realm that he had not reached until now.

[The proficiency of his divine power has increased by 1%.]"

Note: "Taesan" appears to be a proper noun, likely a character's name, so I left it untranslated.
