Chapter 602

602. Extra Story, 1st Floor, Lee Tae-yeon (4)

"Ugh, ugh, ugh."

Lee Tae-yeon arrives at a small spring, half-crawling. She greedily drinks the spring water.

[You have reached the optimal state.]

And, everything about her is restored.

Her physical fatigue, as well as her hunger, completely disappear. She lets out a sigh of relief, feeling a sense of satisfaction deep in her soul.

"Whew...â€¦."

She lies down on the floor. The hard brick floor feels like a comfortable bed to her now.

'Safety Zone.'

A place where those who enter the labyrinth can rest comfortably.

This was exactly that place.

Lee Tae-yeon felt a sense of comfort for the first time since coming here.

The exhaustion she had forgotten suddenly catches up to her. It's no wonder, considering she hadn't slept for two days due to extreme tension. She closes her eyes and accepts the exhaustion that's pulling her in.

And a few hours later.

She opens her eyes.

"Ah..."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She turned on her senses and got up. Nothing around her had changed. It was the same as when she had fallen asleep.

"Phew."

At least she wasn't dead.

Having obtained a minimum level of safety, she slowly began to recall her memories.

"......I think I got something."

Although the situation had been urgent and her memories were hazy, she was certain she had obtained something.

"Skill window?"

The system responded calmly to her questioning cry.

[Special Passive Skill: Death's Omen] [Can detect when death is imminent. Only activates in extreme situations.]

"......This is a real game."

Stats, equipment, and now skills too.

She let out a dry laugh.

It wasn't a bad story for her. Having a skill meant she had another card to survive.

Fortunately, the number of skills she had obtained was not small. Lee Tae-yeon slowly checked her skills.

"Does it detect when I'm about to die?"

It seemed like a skill that did exactly what it said. When she was really on the brink of death, it would let her know. Lee Tae-yeon tilted her head in thought.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$"Is it worth using?"

It's something that happens without knowing how it occurs or how to find out. You would have to actually reach the point of death to confirm.

[Special persistent trigger skill: Path of Life] [Proficiency: 1%] [Subconsciously determines the possibility of survival. Only activated in extreme situations.]

"Oh."

Eitae-yeon spoke. It was the skill she needed the most.

What she fears the most is death. Having a skill that could avoid it was a good thing.

[Special activation skill: Escape] [Mana cost: 2] [Proficiency: 1%] [Can be activated when showing your back to the opponent. Sprints in the opposite direction of the opponent. It seems to be slightly faster than regular running for now.]

"Oh oh."

She spoke again.

An escape, it wasn't what she wanted. The peculiar thing was that it was not always on but an activation skill, meaning she had to activate it.

"...is this how you use it?"

How to use it, her instincts were telling her.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You activated the escape.]

The skill was activated.

But nothing happened.

Maybe the skill's conditions weren't met. She, who had roughly figured out how it worked, checked the next skill.

[Special Activation Skill: Combat Evasion] [Mana Consumption: 5] [Proficiency: 1%] [Can be activated during combat. Automatically evades the opponent's attack. There is a limit to the attacks that can be evaded, and it can only be evaded once.]

"Wow!"

This was even better. It could be activated during combat, and it was an automatic evasion. Although there were various restrictions, it was unconditionally good.

As she carefully examined the skill, she felt something strange.

"They're all evasion-related."

They were all skills related to avoiding combat or surviving. There were no other skills. If she listened to Broken Man or Dwarf's words, they wouldn't like her movements, but she had obtained skills like this.

"Is there some kind of condition?"

She couldn't understand it for now.

And there was something else she had obtained besides the skill. She rummaged through her memories and barely found it.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**[Title: The One Who Ran Away]**
**[Fled in battle, a cowardly but surviving title. Agility +2]**

"Wow, this is too much."

She muttered to herself after reading the description.

But with Agility +2, it didn't seem so bad. With a base stat of 10, it was a 20% increase. She moved her body, and indeed, she could move faster than before.

"This is a real game."

She obtained a title, her stats increased, and she acquired skills.

It was a perfect game.

A dry laugh escaped her lips. No matter how she tried to accept the situation, it was just too absurd.

"......I wonder what others are doing."

"Look, a pioneer!"

When she tried to open the community, a loud voice rang out. Lee Tae-yeon let out a shriek and took a step back.

"Not a bad reaction. Hmm."

The old man with a golden aura looked at her with an interesting expression.

**[You have encountered the Seeker of God.]**

"The Seeker of God?"

"......Hello?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lee Tae-yeon did not let her guard down, even as she exchanged greetings with a slight bow. Everyone she had met here so far had been hostile towards her.

"Are you an adventurer?"

"Are you an adventurer?"

"I'm referring to those who strive to conquer the labyrinth. Is that correct?"

"Uh... I'm not really sure."

"You don't know? That's understandable."

Ainzach spoke with a gentle smile, as if it was no big deal. He slowly approached Lee Tae-yeon.

"...Is that not the case?"

There was no sign of hostility towards her. He might be the first friendly being she had met here.

"Hmm."

Ainzach gazed at Lee Tae-yeon with an enigmatic expression.

Ainzach evaluated adventurers who sought to conquer the labyrinth.

However, that was only for those who were qualified. Most adventurers did not have the qualifications to be evaluated by him.

And his standards were extremely strict.

Since Ainzach had entered the labyrinth, he had personally evaluated fewer than a hundred adventurers. Even if you considered the strong ones who were exceptions from the start, like the guides of evil, they were only a tiny minority when you thought about the time he had entered the labyrinth.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Another alone mode player, Kang Joon-hyuk, had not met Ainz's standards. Therefore, Ainz didn't bother to test him and simply spat and left.

But Ainz was deep in thought about Lee Tae-yeon.

"It's like he's got some skills."

The response was quick. He was one of the top adventurers he had seen so far. Even now, he was maintaining a safe distance, keeping his entire body tense, ready to respond to any movement.

It wasn't something that could be calculated. It was an instinctive action, close to intuition.

He had talent, overflowing with it.

But this place wasn't somewhere that could be resolved with talent alone.

Ainz ended his thoughts.

"How should I react?"

Ainz clenched his fist.

[Ainz launched a non-lethal attack.]

Ainz's attack.

His fist moved.

Slowly.

But surely.

[Your Death Line has been activated.] [Your Path to Life has been activated.]

"Ah."

The system window alerted him, but that was unnecessary. She instinctively realized the power contained in that fist.

A power that could destroy mountains, split the sea, and shake the sky, transcending human understanding.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It's approaching her.

"Ah, uh."

She needs to avoid it.

She can avoid it. Ainzhart's attack is moving at a considerable speed. If it's the current her, she can barely avoid it.

But her body won't move.

An overwhelming, monstrous strength that surpasses her understanding.

When the landslide hits, she can't even think of avoiding it and just stares blankly, similar to when she's frozen in shock. Her body has stiffened due to the overwhelming power.

She's going to die.

Her instincts are screaming warnings.

And Ainzhart is grinning.

Paaaang!

The fist stops in front of Iteayeon's eyes. The whirlwind hits her. Iteayeon's body flies far away.

Kwaaaang!

"Ugh!"

[You took 14,211 damage.] [The critical hit is activated. The damage is nullified.]

The fist didn't even touch her. It was just the whirlwind. Yet, the damage that came out was enough to kill her a hundred times over.

"Ah, uh."

Ainzhart grins at her trembling figure.

"You're a weak coward."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He had enough talent. Lee Tae-yeon had perfectly grasped the level of his attack, the power contained within, and how he should behave to avoid it.

It seemed like he had lived a very peaceful life, judging from the aura he gave off. Nevertheless, it was easy to guess the level of his talent.

It was no exaggeration to say that he was the best adventurer Ainzhart had ever seen.

However, he was paralyzed with fear by his attack, overwhelmed by the fear of death.

"What a waste of talent."

If he had the spirit of a warrior, he would have been perfect. He would have cleared the labyrinth without any obstacles.

Perhaps, it was just a one-in-a-million story, but he could have cleared the labyrinth.

However, Lee Tae-yeon had the spirit of a coward, an extremely ordinary life.

Lee Tae-yeon would never be able to clear the labyrinth. Ainzhart was certain of it. It was also impossible for him to fulfill his own desires.

"What a pity."

Ainzhart clicked his tongue again.

Lee Tae-yeon was able to respond to his attack.

He was able to perfectly dodge the previous attack.

Ainzhart had only seen such an adventurer twice since he entered the labyrinth."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's really a shame about my talent."

"But humans can't have everything."

"No matter what, it was no longer his problem to judge. He no longer had any interest in Lee Tae-yeon.

"......I."

Lee Tae-yeon, who was stuck to the wall, let out a sigh and spoke. His voice contained a single emotion.

"What did I... do wrong to deserve this?"

"Your weakness. That in itself is the mistake."

Ainzhaar replied and left, taking the source of life with him.

Lee Tae-yeon, who was left alone, shook his head deeply.

[You have perfectly grasped the overwhelming enemy's attack. You have acquired the special passive skill [Intuition].]

Note: Ainzhaar is likely a name, and it seems to be a fantasy or game-like setting. Lee Tae-yeon is also a name, and it appears to be the protagonist of the story.
