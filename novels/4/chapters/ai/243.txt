Chapter 244

244. The Fourth Return. Earth (11)

The shadow and light collided with each other.

They mixed and distorted the colors in all directions, starting to emit a strange aura.

"Ah..."

Tae-san let out a low whistle.

A tremendous pressure enveloped his entire body.

Everything began to distort.

"Kuung!"

Tae-san felt a sense of crisis and realized that thousands of monsters were rushing towards him. Each one was a B-grade monster.

Ki-ying.

Tae-san refused to be controlled and began to rampage, causing a very faint tremor to spread from the distorted thing.

"Quddud!"

The monsters rushing towards him suddenly twisted and turned into a grotesque shape. Thousands of monsters were crushed and unable to withstand the immense force.

Tae-san wrapped his body tightly around himself, using his spiritual energy and physical strength to defend himself.

However, he still couldn't hold out.

The sound of creaking and rumbling began to echo through the air.

"Chyeh."

Tae-san gritted his teeth and tried to regain his balance.

He concentrated his strength and adjusted his balance.

However, he was rejected.

The power of the law. The sacred.

The power that distorts the law. Blackness.
Here is the translation of the text:

Two opposing forces are mixed together and distorted, and another is distorted.

Kuung!

The cracks begin to appear in space. Broken fragments fall down.

The inner world is a region created by the power of a S-grade monster that can break the world alone.

A tiny space was created by concentrating all that power.

It was almost like a world.

That world was crumbling.

[Ah, this seems very dangerous.]

Of course, it was a natural thing.

The mountain had divinity, but it couldn't handle it.

The black also had it, but it couldn't handle it either.

Both forces were uncontrollable, and they were mixed together to create a new thing. Even when they were completely opposing forces, a reaction occurred.

There was no way the mountain's control would work.

Ggu-ggu-gu.

The mixed divinity and shadow began to change into a grayish something.

'Ah?'

The ghost, who had been watching anxiously, stopped.

The ghost has seen many powers.

It has analyzed the majority of the powers it has seen, from the depths of the living to the dead. It knows the weaknesses, direction, and principles of those powers.
Here is the translation of the text:

Initially, it was impossible to reach the depth without that level of ability.

Therefore, the small light that Taesan pulled out was able to grasp the true nature of the divine in an instant.

The power of the high-ranking gods was also openly incompatible, and it was easy to recognize the power of the expelled existences.

However, the gray power gathered in Taesan's hand was unknown.

No matter how hard one looked, it was impossible to analyze it. It was truly a mysterious power beyond the unknown.

"What is this?"

As the ghost was flustered, Taesan calmly grasped the situation.

"It's dangerous."

Kwak-kwak-kwak.

The space began to collapse.

The power of the S-grade monster that poured out could not be endured. It was not a simple problem of power.

The monster that was difficult to defeat in the past was unable to withstand the gray level.

"The rebound and collision of opposing powers, and the forced combination."

From this instability, power exploded.

The principle was roughly understandable. The problem was that it was far greater than Taesan's expectation.

Kiki-kiki-kiki!

Taesan gathered all the powers into something.
Here is the translation of the text:

On the verge of explosion, it was possible to control it.

But that was all.

It was impossible to move according to the will of the mountain with this power.

It was a power that couldn't be controlled directly.

[You have activated mental acceleration.]

You focus your mind even more.

How can you control this power? You tried to put it into the ring, but the ring refused, as if it didn't want to be broken or couldn't bear it.

Thoughts keep occurring. Various ideas flash through and disappear repeatedly.

And then, the judgment that it's impossible is made.

The answer was to mix only a very weak power. If you tried to put in even a little more, it would have exploded uncontrollably.

Control is impossible.

"What can I do?"

The mountain has made a decision.

He gave up control.

The ghost was startled.

[You!]

The power that he couldn't control.

Then, it's okay not to control it.

You can make it explode as you want.

(Note: I've translated the text as accurately as possible, but please note that the text appears to be a dramatic and fantastical narrative, and some phrases may not be grammatically or logically correct in English.)
Here is the translation of the text:

The gray power, which had been held back with difficulty, suddenly began to burst forth in search of freedom. Even the distant monsters in the distance turned to dust and disappeared, leaving a gap in the entire space.

The monster, which had abandoned its control and was only relying on its brute strength, was slowly dying.

Wooo!

The space was shaking.

A massive power from the other side was imbued in the monster. The broken space was filled once again, and a dark, inky darkness descended.

The dying monster was revived once more and concentrated its power on the Taesan.

The darkness, which had absorbed the light, rushed towards the Taesan.

Kaka!

However, everything was shattered by the gray power.

It was as if an earthquake had struck, and everything collapsed.

Even the interference of a god was rendered meaningless by this power.

The Taesan poured more power into the gray something.

The sacred and shadowy powers were intertwined.

The Taesan grasped it.

It trembled with resistance, as if its very soul was being polluted by the sensation of grasping.

But it could still be wielded.

[Your determination has been activated. The damage leading to death has been nullified. For 1 second, all damage is 0.]

The Taesan gripped the gray and swung it.

The concentrated gray light exploded.

* * *

“Eeeeh!”

Kaka!
Here is the translation of the text:

Kim Hui-yeon barely managed to defeat a monster. She gasped for breath.

Her strength was almost exhausted. It was reasonable to assume that the victory was impossible, as many people had already died.

However, Kim Hui-yeon did not give up.

"Fight!"

She grasped her weapon.

"We can win!"

"Oh, oh, oh!"

The people responded to her words and stood up.

In that instant, a small monster like a bug suddenly attacked Kim Hui-yeon.

"Ah."

Kim Hui-yeon tried to react, but her exhausted body couldn't move properly.

It was the moment when Kim Hui-yeon sensed her own death.

Ka!

A dagger struck the monster, pinning it down. The monster struggled, but the dagger didn't waver.

The pale-faced man who had saved Kim Hui-yeon asked, "Are you okay?"

"...I'm Ju-hyuk. Thank you."

Kim Hui-yeon left a grateful expression and stood up. Ju-hyuk watched her as she charged at the monster again.

"...What's the difference, then?"

He looked at Kim Hui-yeon with a calm expression, as if he were trying to find out what the difference was between her and himself.

And then he realized many things.
Here is the translation of the text:

He pursued power and desired to be a leader. He didn't care about the lives or minds of others.

And he thought that if he was a leader, it was natural. He believed that only those who didn't care about others and went ahead alone could become leaders.

But Kim Hui-yeon was different.

She went forward with others.

And always, with an unshaken expression, she boldly shouted.

Even if the current situation was desperate, she believed she could win. She took the initiative and didn't back down.

She had always been like that. Even in a desperate situation, she treated people with a bright face.

He was different. To him, others were just tools for gaining power. What individual thoughts or desires they had didn't concern him.

Perhaps his attitude was subtly revealed. That he didn't care about them, and even if they died, he wouldn't be sad.

Can you always trust and rely on him? Can you trust him when it's dangerous?
Here is the translation of the text:

The difference was just a moment ago, but it was getting bigger and bigger as I looked closer.

That's why people chose Kim Hwi-yeon instead of him.

Lee Ju-hyuk smiled sarcastically.

He still believed in his own way of doing things. He thought that as a leader, one should take bold action.

But now, he didn't think about denying Kim Hwi-yeon.

He stepped forward. As a hard mode player following Kim Hwi-yeon's words, not as a leader.

The battle continued.

The situation was still desperate. They were fighting hard under Kim Hwi-yeon, but the number of monsters didn't decrease. Only the people were falling.

Kim Hwi-yeon gritted her teeth.

The word "extermination" flashed through her mind in that instant.

Pfft.

"What?"

The movement of the monsters suddenly stopped.

The giant monster behind Taesan was tearing apart its internal organs.

Kuuuung!

Minerva, who was pushing the giant monster, also felt it. Her face stiffened as she blew the giant monster away with the wind.

"What's going on?"

Barquaz also looked shocked.

Minerva looked at the S-grade monster.

"...What? That's it."
Here is the translation of the text:

She sent a gaze that said she couldn't understand.

The power that a labyrinth could possess, existing within the laws, was not divine power.

Nor was it the transcendent power that existed beyond the laws.

It was something in between.

The faint, grayish light that flowed out from the gap between monsters exploded.

* * *

[Your ascension has been activated. Your proficiency in [???] has increased by 4%.] [Your ascension has been activated. Your proficiency in the special continuous activation skill [Twisted Ascension Regulation] has increased by 3%.] [You have gained the special activation skill [Inner World].] [Your proficiency in [Black] has increased by 1%.] [[Boundary] has been obtained.] [Since you have escaped the labyrinth, you cannot acquire skills.]

The world is visible.

The mountain murmurs calmly.

"It's done."

[What's up with you?]

A ghost asked, seemingly unable to understand.

[What kind of big brain came up with the idea of combining the two? If you're wrong, you could be torn apart into a hundred pieces, you know?]

"It's okay, right?"

[……You.]

"Don't overdo it. I've calculated everything."

Note: The text appears to be a mix of fantasy and game-like elements, with characters and settings that are not clearly defined. The translation is based on the context and grammar of the text, but some phrases may not be entirely clear or accurate without further context.
Here is the translation of the text:

The internal structure of the S-grade monster was something that even Taesan couldn't penetrate at this moment.

In other words, he needed to extract something beyond his current strength.

That was precisely the sacred and black.

Mixing the two would lead to a backlash, which was expected. The collision of two opposing, massive forces was only natural.

The crucial thing was whether he could control it or not.

If he couldn't control it, what would he do?

Taesan had to risk his life to handle the uncontrollable powerful force.

"That's a holding pattern for the sake of it."

A skill that could nullify the damage leading to death, but only once.

There is no limit to this skill. Even if it's any skill, no matter how great, it could wipe it out once.

In reality, he had even withstood the attack of a saint in his past life.

Therefore, Taesan gave up control and wielded the gray power.

[......I thought it all out and wrote it.]

"Don't make bets without a chance of winning."

[What a crazy person.]

The ghostly face spat out a bitter expression.

Taesan looked around his surroundings.

"The monsters have all disappeared, it seems."
Here is the translation of the text:

Since the monster that was going to become the master has died, it naturally disappeared.

Tae-san looked down at his hand. The gray energy had scattered and was dissipating.

The S-grade monster was incomplete from the start.

It had used all its strength to bind Tae-san, and if it were to be pierced with a needle, it would burst like a balloon.

As a result, the internal energy had exploded, and it had disappeared unable to withstand it.

However, it was indeed erased in one blow. It was more powerful than what he had imagined.

"Oh, oh, oh!"

People who had belatedly understood the situation cheered loudly.

"Tae-san! Tae-san!"

"I believed it!"

They fell to their knees, shedding tears of amazement. Kim Hui-yeon ran over with a bright face.

"Tae-san, you've done it!"

"How did it go?"

"It's not good."

Tae-san glanced at the people.

The number of people had decreased significantly compared to before Tae-san entered the monster. More than half had decreased.

"However, ... we did not perish. We survived."
Here is the translation of the text:

There was no one weak enough to be crushed by that death, but they were rejoicing at their survival and praising the Mountain God.

"Lord."

Barcaza and Minerva arrived late.

Minerva's face was filled with astonishment.

"What's that gray aura just now?"

"It's the power of sacredness and virtue mixed together."

"Power of sacredness and... virtue?"

Minerva's eyes widened in surprise.

"Why does the Lord have the power of virtue?"

"If you ask, it'll be a long story. Just think of it as my power and it'll be easier to understand."

"...I don't understand at all. And what's mixed together? What's that?"

Minerva was a divine monarch.

She knew most of the information about the world. She knew about transcendent beings, immortal beings, and the power of virtue.

However, the gray aura's power that had just emerged was a type that she didn't know about.

It was a power that even the world's guardian didn't know about.

"I don't know the details."

The Mountain God shook his head. He had expected the creation of power due to some kind of backlash.

However, he didn't know exactly what kind of power it was.

"But someone who knows is aware."

[Quest completed.] [With the condition fulfilled, the descent is permitted.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The space splits apart. Those who had been crying out the name of Tai Shan's name in despair suddenly pause. Right next to them, Kim Hui-yeon's face turns white as he takes a step back hesitantly.

"Ah..."

Minerva's face turns pale.

A massive being appears in the split space.

(It's been a long time since I've shown myself to so many mortal beings.)

A man with black hair appears, accompanied by a dry voice.

"Ah..."

People involuntarily bow their heads.

The man seemed to be nothing to them.

In reality, they were not even aware of it.

However, they could sense it. The being who appeared was someone of a level that they dare not judge.

[The God of Despair. Aphrodite has appeared.]
