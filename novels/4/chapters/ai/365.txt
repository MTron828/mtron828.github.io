Chapter 366

366. 76th Floor, Child of the Gods (6)

The Transcendent's domain engulfed the space. Taesan tried to create distance, but the entire world was already shrouded.

[You have activated Essence Perception.] [You have activated Concentrated Detection.] [You have activated Reconnaissance.]

You try to grasp the power that has been realized in the world.

But nothing comes out. Just like when you detected the Child of the Gods, a jumbled mix of letters floods Taesan's mind.

The Transcendent's domain was impossible to grasp even with Taesan's power.

Kuung!

The Emperor leaps forward.

Taesan blocks the Emperor's swinging fist with his sword.

Kaang!

Taesan's body is pushed back a little. As the domain expands, the Emperor has become stronger than before.

However, the increase in power wasn't that great.

If you try to respond, you can respond to that level. There was nothing special about using the power of the gods.

[You have activated Starlight Arrow.]

The arrow of light collides with the Emperor. The divine energy that surrounds the Emperor's entire body absorbs the light.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan swung his hand as usual.

All sorts of magic were manifested. The earth crumbled, and a chill swept over the world.

Taesan's magical power was incredibly strong. Even a powerful emperor-level warrior would have a hard time approaching him.

Taesan continued to manifest his magic, putting pressure on the emperor.

The emperor looked at Taesan with an arrogant face.

"You have no manners. How dare you use such a profane power, akin to magic, on sacred ground."

The emperor raised his finger.

"I will set a rule. From now on, in this sacred realm of the Lord, whenever you use magic, you must clasp your hands together and offer a prayer."

As soon as the emperor finished speaking, the magic that was being manifested suddenly stopped.

"What?"

Taesan's face contorted in an instant.

The magic had been cancelled mid-cast. This had never happened to him before. Taesan quickly gathered his mana.

[You have activated Starlight Arrow.]

The mana was consumed, and the power should have been realized.

But it didn't. It was as if trying to ignite a flame underwater - the activation itself didn't work.

The emperor took a step forward, his foot stomping towards Taesan.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan blocked his attack, which was like a storm.

Ka-a-a-ang!

Taesan was pushed back and bit his tongue. He was using magic, not mana.

[You have activated Asmodeus' Corrupting Chain.]

A new black magic was obtained. Its effect was to suppress the opponent.

Cha-ja-ja-jang!

The chains that burst out of the space wrapped around the Emperor's entire body. The Emperor wildly flailed his arms and legs, and the chains began to break apart.

[You have activated Visago's Stormy Arrow.]

A black arrow materialized and charged straight at the Emperor.

The Emperor, who had broken free from the chains, swung his fist.

Kwaa-a-a-ang!

Power exploded. The black and golden colors clashed, reducing the surroundings to ruins.

"How dare you use black magic in this sacred place?"

The Emperor scowled and declared.

"From now on, a new rule will be established. Every time you use black magic, you must bow your head to the earth and pay respects to the gods."

The black magic that was being cast was cancelled.

"This is unbelievable."

[What's going on?]

The ghost also muttered in shock, its energy drained.

It wasn't just Taesan who was restricted.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This world. It was bound by the constraints of dark magic.

The Emperor fiercely pushed away Taesan.

Ka-ga-gak!

Taesan, who had distanced himself from the Emperor, clasped his hands together and prayed, manifesting magic. Fortunately, simply clasping his hands together was enough to manifest the magic.

Zhe-zhe-zhe!

As a result, the normally frozen world was revealed.

Taesan's eyes sank.

There was no falsehood in the Emperor's declaration. If one followed the rules, they could wield power, and if not, it was impossible.

"Your swordsmanship is lacking."

The Emperor sneered and declared again.

"Before you wield a sword, you must kneel on one knee and pay respects to the gods."

Taesan's movement to draw his sword came to a halt.

The changed laws of the world, governed by Taesan's will, prevented him from moving his sword. Taesan quickly knelt on one knee, then drew his sword.

Ka-aa-ang!

"Tsk."

Taesan clicked his tongue and summoned Minerva. The summoned Minerva blew away the wind, pressuring the Emperor."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"How dare a lowly spirit like you be summoned to the land of the gods? This is the land of the gods. The existence of a spirit summoned without offering a worthy sacrifice to the gods is not permitted. Begone!"

"Ugh!"

Minerva's body disappeared with a scream.

Taesan blocked the Emperor's fierce attack and quickly judged the situation.

"Rules."

A power that interferes with the fundamental laws of the world.

Similar to partial world alteration, but a higher-level power.

It brings a part of the god's domain power to the world, creating a one-sided rule for oneself.

Horai was the god of rules. He had forcibly inscribed unfavorable rules onto the world for Taesan.

Taesan realized.

This was the power that only the apostles chosen by the gods could wield.

Whoa!

[Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.]

The attack was erased, and his body returned to its state before the attack. The Emperor scowled and stomped his foot again.

"What kind of trickery is this?"

Kuung!

The Emperor charged forward with his fist clenched. His technique was quite simple, so Taesan could easily counter it.

However, Taesan was currently bound by the rules.

Not only magic, but even dark magic, spirits, and even swordsmanship were impossible to use properly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Usually, even a simple counterattack would be difficult to block.

Ka-ga-gak!

Taesan swung his sword. However, since it required a preparatory motion, his reaction was slow. The Emperor dodged easily and counterattacked.

Taesan knelt down again and swung his sword upwards.

[You activated the 'Flow' skill.]

The Emperor's fist, which was touched by the sword, was deflected.

However, the Emperor quickly regained his footing and used his strength to return the deflected trajectory to its original path.

The second attack was nullified.

Taesan thought quickly.

A power that restricts the activation of strength. Regulation.

There were a few countermeasures. First, there was partial world alteration.

Although it was the power of a god, it was the Emperor who controlled it. If it was partial world alteration, it would be possible to neutralize it to some extent.

However, he had used up all his resources while defeating the guides.

Next was the boundary line.

A gray power that mixed the power of laws and the power beyond laws.

It would be possible to ignore the regulation and nullify the divine power that the Emperor possessed. If he could just land a hit, he could defeat the current Emperor with a single blow."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, it was not suitable for immediate use. Taesan gazed at the Emperor.

The first opponent to face was a genuine god's apostle.

It was impossible to know what kind of hidden abilities there might be. There was also a possibility that Taesan could receive direct power from the Transcender and somehow withstand the boundary line. However, since Taesan was still unable to fully control the boundary line, he had to use it cautiously.

"If I use the boundary and the boundary line together..."

Even that might be pierced.

But when two uncontrolled powers mixed, the consequences were difficult for Taesan to predict.

So, that method was a last resort.

The opponent in front of him was not that kind of opponent.

If he grasped the possibility, he could win.

Taesan moved his body slowly to analyze the Emperor's power.

However, no matter what, it meant he had to hold on for now. He allowed the Emperor's attack and, as a result, Taesan was accumulating damage little by little.

The attack nullification was being depleted, and his stamina was decreasing.

Kwaang!

The Emperor's fist struck Taesan's sword, and Taesan's body was pushed back.

"You cannot defeat me," the Emperor said with arrogance.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Your true power is undoubtedly stronger than mine. I won't deny it."

If we were to fight with all our might, even the Emperor himself would lose. The Emperor knew that too.

"But in front of great power, your true power is useless."

A power that makes everything built by mortals meaningless.

That was the power of God. For mortals, it was an absolute authority that could never be reached.

"I understand. You're a lowly tool."

"Ah."

The child, who had been watching the battle from afar, trembled with fear.

Although the child couldn't see the battle with their eyes, they knew that Taesan was being pushed back.

"This weakling is going to die because of your stubbornness."

"Ah..."

The child's face turned pale.

Taesan was dying.

Because of no one else but themselves.

"No, I don't want that."

The child stumbled forward, trying to intervene. The child, who had already lost many people because of themselves, couldn't bear it anymore.

"There's no need for that."

But Taesan stopped the child.

"Do you want to be possessed by the divine blood that badly?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's too great a power for a trivial tool like that to possess. Don't you think it's right for someone with qualifications to take it?"

The Emperor laughed, his twisted smile filled with greed.

"That's right! I'll absorb the divine blood and surpass mortality! And I'll become the guardian who stands by their side!"

He charged forward with his loyal servant.

"Be a stepping stone for him! You pitiful existence!"

Taesan drew his sword.

[You activated mental acceleration.]

You slowly organized your thoughts while blocking the relentless attacks.

"The Rule of Compulsion."

A very one-sided rule that only benefits the Emperor himself.

But the opponent is not a god.

At best, they're just a servant who borrows that power.

There must be limitations to that law.

Just looking at how it doesn't seal magic and dark magic altogether, but rather makes them take a specific stance before activation, you can tell.

"You can set conditions, but you can't seal the ability itself."

[You activated stealth.]

The Emperor's attack caused the ground to crumble, and Taesan's figure became obscured. For an instant, Taesan's presence disappeared.

Taesan, who had moved behind the Emperor, knelt down.

Ka-ga-gak!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Emperor hastily twisted his body to block Taesan's attack.

"I have several unpleasant powers."

The Emperor only said that, but he didn't impose any rules on stealth.

"I didn't impose any rules on nullifying attacks either."

He was frustrated and flustered, but he didn't block it. Taesan's sudden attack during the battle was the same.

Taesan drew his sword. The Emperor's fist and Taesan's fist clashed.

Ku-u-ung!

Taesan had never wielded a sword before. But since there were restrictions on swordsmanship due to the rules, it was easier to fight with his fists instead.

With the unified attack power of the Airak martial arts, the damage itself wasn't a big problem.

The fists clashed. Taesan defended against the Emperor's attack.

From the start, the Emperor's martial arts weren't that great. On the other hand, Taesan had fought numerous opponents in the labyrinth, including those who used their fists.

Knowing the countermeasures meant knowing how to move accordingly. Of course, it was far inferior to swordsmanship, but it wasn't something he couldn't handle.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Because of the difference in experience, the Emperor couldn't easily break through Taesan's defense.

"It's pitiful, you don't even know shame. You might as well accept your death quietly."

The Emperor ridiculed Taesan.

However, he didn't take any further action.

Although he could have broken through the rules with his authority, he didn't activate them.

Taesan was certain. There were restrictions to the rules.

Then, what were the restrictions?

"In cases where the rules apply not only to others, but also to oneself."

The rules the Emperor had activated were all related to magic, dark magic, spirits, and swordsmanship, which had no connection to the Emperor. On the other hand, the authority was something the Emperor wielded. If the rules applied to himself as well, he wouldn't be able to activate them.

"Or, there's a restriction on the number of rules."

At the same time, there was a limit to the number of rules that could be set simultaneously, which is why he couldn't impose restrictions on the authority.

Confirmation was not difficult.

[You have activated the spark of calamity.]

The fierce flames of destruction appear in the world."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power contained within was stronger and more intense than ever before, surpassing anything Taesan had handled until now. It was because he could now properly wield the power of destruction, having defeated the guiding leaders.

"This is it."

The Emperor scowled, taking a step back. Taesan focused his mind.

The calamitous flame that burned everything in the world. If the user's level was low or they lacked qualifications, it was impossible to control. That was why it had been impossible to handle until now.

But now, Taesan possessed both of those qualities.

The flames danced wildly.

The true flames that burned the world were transcending the realm of the transcendent.

The power of destruction, with its high level, was something even the Emperor couldn't easily block. Taesan took advantage of the opening and raised his hands in prayer.

[You have activated the Starlight Arrow.]

Kiing!

Magic and dark magic were activated. The rule wasn't to block the activation of magic and dark magic itself, but rather to satisfy the conditions. If the conditions were met, it could be handled to any extent.

The power surged towards the Emperor. The Emperor wanted to counterattack, but the flames that burned the world, chasing after him, didn't give him the leisure to do so.

The Emperor clicked his tongue and said..."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You dare to wield such a petty power in the realm of Horai-nim. The flames that burn the world cannot be unleashed unless it's not in the original world."

A new rule is applied to the world.

At the same time, Taesan realized. The restriction on magic, which had been limited for the first time, disappeared.

There is a limit to the number of rules that can be applied simultaneously.

And the limit of the rules is up to a total of four.

The verification is complete. I've also organized the countermeasures.

Now it's his turn. Taesan gathered his strength."

Note: "Horai-nim" is likely a proper noun, possibly a name or title, and I've left it untranslated.
