Chapter 265

265. Special Activation Skill. Absolute Judgment (2)

"59th floor. If it's fast, it's obtained quickly."

[... What else are you getting? What is it this time?]

The ghost asked, seemingly tired. Taesan replied.

"Absolute Judgment."

[... What kind of name is that? What's its effect?]

"Complete disregard for the opponent's defense measures."

[... ]

The ghost was speechless.

Taesan began preparing to acquire the skill.

In this world, there exists something called "gauge."

If you have a gauge above a certain level, you won't receive damage from those who don't have it.

In his previous life, he was in easy mode.

The concept of gauge didn't practically exist.

He couldn't understand it back then, but he didn't take damage from S-rank or demon opponents because he didn't have a gauge.

However, he defeated an S-rank opponent and landed a valid hit on a demon.

The skills that made it possible were Essential Strike and Absolute Judgment.

"Right."

The creature focuses on defense. Taesan recalls the information that Taeyeon told him.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The monster with a lot of defense, covering its eyes.

'A monster that focuses on defense.'

It defends against everything, whether it's magic or physical strength, using its high vitality to tire out its opponents.

It was a monster that slowly wore down its opponents.

Taesan swung his sword, and the sound of steel colliding with steel rang out.

[Dealt 987 damage to the monster with a lot of defense covering its eyes.]

Zhaja!

The monster's defenses became even stronger.

Swinging his sword again, this time only 500 damage was dealt. The recoil was severe, and he had to put a lot of strength into his hand.

Zhajazhaja!

The monster's defenses became even stronger.

It became a form that tightly connected and repelled attacks.

Kaang!

Taesan swung his sword.

The weapon bounced back with a strong recoil, dealing only 300 damage this time.

"Where did it go?"

[You activated the Frost Arrow.]

The cold arrow pierced the monster, shattering its defenses with a loud sound.

[Dealt 1087 damage to the monster with a lot of defense covering its eyes.]

This time, normal damage was dealt.

Note: The text appears to be a passage from a fantasy novel or game, describing a battle between a character named Taesan and a monster with strong defensive capabilities.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"Then, the creature's form changed again. Its skin, which was wrapped around it, began to emit heat. When it fired another arrow, the damage decreased to 700.

Taesan used his spirit skill this time. He used a small flame to pressure the creature.

This time, the creature's skin transformed into a rock-like form, and the damage it received gradually decreased.

"It would be tricky for someone else."

No matter what attack was used, it would respond accordingly. But it wasn't a problem for Taesan.

He possessed four powers: dark magic, magic, swordsmanship, and spirit energy. And even more, he had the power of the Divine, which was hard to handle, and the power of the gods.

It was meaningless to try to match him. If one tried, they could just use another skill. Or, like the intermediate dark magic he used earlier, he could crush them with his raw power. There were many ways to defeat them.

But for those who possessed only one or two powers, like the creature, he would be a very tough opponent.

Kaang!

[Dealt 887 damage to the creature with its eyes closed in fear.] [You won.]

The creature collapsed.

"About 30,000, I suppose."

With that much damage, he could knock it down. It had a considerable amount of health."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"I can see why Lee Tae-yeon was about to die."

Taesan smiled and moved on to the next room.

He started taking out his weapons and equipment one by one.

"[Are you trying to lower your attack power?]"

"It's too high."

He had to meet the conditions for absolute judgment.

The ghost let out a strange sound.

"[What are the conditions? I'm curious, but I can't help but wonder.]"

"You'll see if you just look."

The monster appeared. Taesan, excluding his sufficient equipment, charged with a sword.

Kaang!

98 damage was dealt.

The transformed creature's skin changed to match the attack, becoming tougher and more resilient.

Taesan focused his mind.

"[You have activated your essence grasp.] [You have activated your insight.]"

He read the creature's information, understanding its transformed skin, its pattern, and its countermeasures.

Taesan charged again.

He precisely targeted the gap in the transformed skin and stabbed it.

Kwa-jik.

This time, the damage dealt was 97.

Jjeok.

The creature's skin transformed again.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"It changes into a smooth form. It looked like it would slip away even if attacked.

'Let's see where it goes.'

[You activated your insight.]

Information comes in.

The changed form, its effect, and its rough appearance are etched into your mind.

As a result, you could see that there were protruding parts between the smooth forms.

Taesan rushed in.

The protruding part was extremely small, like a single dot. He focused his mind and thrust his sword.

The tip of the sword precisely hit the protruding part.

Kaang!

99 damage.

The ghost understood through a series of processes.

[Are you going to keep dealing similar damage?]

"Yes."

[What's the margin of error?]

"About +-5% based on what I've understood so far."

[...... Wow.]

The ghost's voice was filled with admiration and disbelief.

It meant that if they assumed they dealt 100 damage, they would only deal damage between 95 and 105.

[How many times?]

"Over a hundred times."

[...... It seems that the opponent needs to respond differently to each attack, watching you experiment on this creature.]

"You know that well."

The ghost laughed mockingly.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This is crazy."

[...The owner seems to be out of their mind.]

Barcaraja also said with a trembling voice. He didn't know much about the system of the labyrinth, but he could sense that Taesan's words were on a different level.

An opponent who changes their defense every time they're attacked, adapting to each blow.

You have to make them take the same amount of damage every time you attack, no matter what they do.

In other words, you have to pierce through all their defenses and crush them.

Barcaraja couldn't even imagine the difficulty level of that.

And having gone deep into the labyrinth and overcome numerous trials, the ghost was even more incredulous.

"[That's a crazy statement, similar to adding numbers.]"

Adding numbers was a skill that required the same posture, the same strength, and the same trajectory, repeating it all without a single mistake to increase the damage.

Absolute judgment was the opposite. You had to pierce through the opponent's different defenses every time, using a different method each time, over 100 times.

But one thing was certain.

Both were crazy.

Tzok tzok tzok.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"It spread out like dry skin. Taesan pierced through the changed defense again.

Kaang!

[Dealt 96 damage to the masked, frightened creature.] [You're really taking this, what's wrong with you?]

"I've tried. A lot."

Millions of times. Maybe even more. I tried to get a perfect judgment.

The experience that couldn't be measured made me realize that I could sense the opponent's response and adjust my strength accordingly.

Taesan continued to attack the creature. The creature, which had been changing its skin, suddenly covered its face with its arm.

Woong.

Instead of changing its skin, a blue-ish barrier formed around the creature.

This was a completely different response. I tried to use Insight, but it only described it as a protective blessing that defended the body, without giving any details.

Tsk.

Taesan charged towards the barrier.

He stabbed his sword and put strength into his legs.

The moment the sword touched the barrier, a repulsive force was felt.

A force that bounced the sword back. Taesan reflexively added more strength, and the barrier was pierced, stabbing the creature.

[Dealt 93 damage to the masked, frightened creature.]

"Hmm."

Failed."

This appears to be a passage from a fantasy novel or game, with a character named Taesan battling a creature with unique abilities.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The mountain sword was drawn. There was no shock, as there was no expectation of success on the first try.

The mountain sword exerted strength and advanced.

While continuing to press against the transformed body, which had unfolded its defenses, it attempted to deal 100 damage. After several attempts, it was able to stably deal damage.

The transformed body also continued to change its defensive pattern, but there was no problem. The sword calculated the recoil force felt when it touched the defense and applied the corresponding amount of strength.

As a result of continued pressure, the mountain sword was able to grasp the transformed body's pattern.

'The first is a change in the armor's shape.'

Next, it applies a blue barrier and recoils.

Third, the transformed body itself becomes solid. Unlike the armor, it has no gaps, so it must be struck purely with strength.

The fourth pattern is to cover its entire body with a slippery liquid. It reduces damage by slipping away from the sword's attack.

And the fifth pattern is to move wildly. It's closer to simply flailing around than attacking. It was a bit difficult to land an accurate hit due to its constant movement.

In total, the opponent showed five patterns."

"After that, no matter how much he tried, the pattern didn't change, so Taesan organized his thoughts and moved on to the next room.

Now was the real deal. Taesan charged at the new entity.

Kaang!

He swung his sword.

The entity, which was trying to change its pattern to defend itself, was suppressed by Taesan's same technique and movement as before. But the entity, which had been constantly changing, changed its response method.

Wooong.

A blue barrier was formed.

Taesan swung his sword again, breaking through the barrier's pattern. This time, he made his whole body rigid.

Next, he covered his entire body with a sticky substance, and finally, he started flailing wildly.

Through this process, Taesan realized that if he attacked in the same way, the entity's pattern would also remain the same.

So, what if he attacked in a different way?

Taesan moved on to the next room and started dealing around 100 damage to the entity there.

But this method was different from before. Until now, he had aimed for the gaps in the entity's defense, but this time, Taesan forcibly crushed the entity's rigidified defense with his strength.

The entity, which had been changing, changed again.

Tzok!

The entity's body became rigid."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It had passed the second pattern and was showing the third pattern directly.

It wasn't simply showing the same pattern mechanically. According to Taesan's response method, this entity changed its pattern.

In other words, if Taesan attacked in the same way, he could fix the entity's pattern.

One way. One way. He's creating a path for the attack. Taesan opened the passage with his magic.

[You have activated the domain detection of Relaje.]

Kying.

The magic spreads out in all directions, sweeping away the labyrinth. As a result, Taesan grasped the location and number of rooms on the 59th floor.

"There are 20 more."

In other words, he must obtain absolute judgment within these 20.

Taesan moved to the next room.

First, one. He grasped it again this time. By observing the pattern and moving in the same way, he realized that the entity would respond in the same way.

He realized that nothing was missed.

And two.

He starts attacking the pattern."

이 текст는 한국어입니다. 다음은 영어 번역입니다.

First, we try to perfectly understand the husk's pattern. By continuously dealing the same damage, we figured out a pattern close to perfect.

And the third one. We figured out the wall pattern. If we make a big change in damage halfway, we realized that it maintains the same pattern. By maintaining the wall pattern, we figured out the changes in the pattern and how to deal with it.

Fourth.

We deal with the hardening pattern.

This was relatively easy. It just got harder, so we just kept dealing with it by understanding the cycle and its intensity.

We've finished figuring out three patterns.

The fourth pattern is the one where it splatters sticky liquid all over its body.

This one was quite challenging. The total damage changed, and the pattern kept changing halfway.

As a result, I realized that I had to deal damage within a range of +-5% to the boss. If not, it became even more difficult. Not only did I have to adjust my body and deal damage, but I also had to figure out the sticky pattern, which took quite some time. It wasn't until the ninth try that I was able to figure out the sticky pattern and adjust the damage.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

And the last pattern. The crazy, wild pattern.

It was the hardest. I couldn't easily read the pattern in the wild movements. At first glance, it seemed to be moving randomly.

But on the eleventh try, Taesan was able to grasp the pattern that seemed random but had a hidden rule.

Next, he started to exploit that pattern.

He spent fifteen tries figuring out how to attack in a way that would make the next attack easier to land, and how to adjust his strategy to make it a bit easier to exploit.

Finally, Taesan had mastered all the patterns.

From then on, it was time to repeat.

He input the pattern and attacked the entity. He mechanically repeated the attack, gradually reducing the margin of error.

[Uh...].

The sight was enough to make Barajas sigh. Taesan's mechanical repetition looked nothing like a human.

Taesan continued to repeat the attack.

And the result...

Nineteen tries. Only one more try left.
