Chapter 227

227. Creating a Dark World (2)

Goshin was aiming for his own world and himself.

As a mountain seeking divine power and strength, he would inevitably clash with Goshin and others if he pursued his goals.

I thought it was a rehearsal for that moment. The mountain's shadow stretched out, and I took a step back.

The darkness that swallowed the Haask was definitely unusual. I had faced many monsters before, but this one was significantly different.

It wasn't just strong, but was fundamentally different.

The shadow enveloped the land and space.

Once something was swallowed by the shadow, it would never come out again.

The four directions of the concrete were covered by the shadow.

"Baruka, get away. If not, return or leave."

[I may feel embarrassed to say this, but it's impossible. Don't die. Master. If the contract holder dies like this, it's too pitiful.]

As Baruka left, Haask's distorted smile appeared.

"Kaha!"
Here is the translation of the text:

As the rough echoes and darkness rise together from the shadows, those things that sprout like thorns aim at Tai Shan.

Tai Shan suddenly opens his body, narrowly avoiding the thorns that are targeting his head, and swings his sword to pierce his entire body.

Kagakagak!

The darkness collides with the sword and distorts its trajectory.

And the sword is gradually consumed by darkness, starting to absorb the darkness.

Tai Shan breathes fire into the sword. The darkness is pushed back by Tai Shan's power and falls apart.

As he adjusts his spiritual energy, Tai Shan feels a sense of burden.

"'Is blocking also dangerous?'"

The place where the shadow touches becomes a domain of the gods. The power that rejects harmony and ignores laws, using Hask's body as a medium, expands its domain to the world.

Tai Shan's sword is about to be bound by the power of the gods just by blocking this attack.

Although he can pour spiritual energy to repel the attack, he will be at a disadvantage if he consumes too much spiritual energy in response to such small attacks.

Darkness rises again from the shadows.

Like a tidal wave, the powerful sword energy sweeps Tai Shan's hand.

[You have activated the frozen world.]

Tzetzetzetzetz!
Here is the translation of the text:

The intense coldness surrounds me from all sides, freezing everything it touches and stopping time around me.

And darkness doesn't care, swallowing the coldness. The shadow that has eaten everything in an instant is running towards Tai Shan.

It's Tai Shan's fault.

Tai Shan is trying to escape. He narrowly avoids the pursuing shadow and creates a distance between them.

However, the shadow becomes even more violent.

The shadow that covers the entire world seizes Tai Shan's escape path.

There's nowhere to run anymore. So, it's just a matter of time.

Tai Shan puts his strength into his legs and runs towards the outer edge of the shadow where it hasn't yet spread.

At the moment when the shadow touches his feet, Tai Shan jumps and pulls out his shield.

[You have activated the shield of the Aegis.]

The shield's power is surrounding Tai Shan.

For one second, the shield makes Tai Shan immune to all damage. However, there is a drawback: during the shield's activation time, he is unable to move.

But he's not bound by the law of inertia. Before activating the shield, Tai Shan had already stepped aside, so his body is flying out of the shadow's range.

The shadow is heading towards Tai Shan's flying body.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Holding the essence of Tae-san, it turns it into a dark gray color.

The shield's effect is immunity to damage. The shadow attack is ineffective and should not have hit.

'Uh?'

However, Tae-san's eyebrows twitched as if they were about to take off.

The shadow that covered the body roughed up Tae-san, suppressing it.

Tsssss.

The power of the shield that wrapped around Tae-san began to wane.

'[Ah, ahahah?]

Until the shadow breaks free, it cannot withstand. Tae-san quickly summoned the essence of the body and wrapped it around itself.

Kaaaang!

The shield's duration ended before it could be broken.

The shadow attached itself to Tae-san's body. Tae-san felt an unpleasant, alien sensation from the tip of his toes and pushed it away with the power of the essence, activating the skill.

'[You have randomly blinked.]'

Tae-san's physical body moved far away. Tae-san shook off the darkness that clung to his feet.

'[Uh... this is...].'

The ghost couldn't speak. Tae-san held his sword expressionlessly.

"Still."

There was no need to be surprised. The power of the high god distorted the laws of this world and intervened with the power of the gods.

And the labyrinth is a place where a magician combined the power of the gods and magic."

Note: Tae-san and the high god are likely to be characters or deities in a fantasy story, and the text appears to be a scene from an action-adventure or fantasy novel.
Here is the translation of the text:

"If items in the labyrinth are affected by the power of the high gods, it's not unusual."

"'Skill' seems to only affect items, right? If I'm not mistaken, it can provide some defense too."

The shadows in the darkness are trying to pierce through the mountain. The mountain avoids the attack.

"Hahahah!"

Luckily, Haskar wasn't paying attention to the crystal. He was only gathering his strength to kill the mountain, so the mountain didn't need to worry about the crystal's protection.

So, he focused only on killing the enemy in front of him.

The mountain moved its body.

Kkkaaaga!

Avoiding attacks alone is not enough to defeat the enemy. Haskar had to find a way to approach him.

It's impossible to approach the enemy by stepping on the ground. Haskar's surroundings were all within the high god's domain. As soon as he lifted his foot, the high god's power would crush the mountain.

Then, to the sky.

[You have activated the perfect fairy's wings.]

The crystal wings spread behind the mountain's back.

The body accelerates and soars through the sky.

"Hahahah!"

Whooosh!
Here is the translation of the text:

The shadow lifted and stood upright, covering the sky. As the dark power surged forth, Taesan moved its wings.

Pa-a-ang!

It moved quickly, its trajectory like a brush stroke filling the air. Taesan dodged, moving its shadowy form to evade.

"Hahahah!"

Taesan burst into laughter.

The one who had once been so powerful, yet had broken their own contract, was now unable to do anything but flee. The fact that they were unable to do anything filled Taesan with great joy. It was too enjoyable to bear.

"Mirage, indeed! Against this great power, what's the point?"

Nothing mattered.

Taesan shouted loudly.

"You'll die there! Bug!"

Taesan didn't respond.

It had no concern for the creature that was being consumed by its own power and losing its sense of self.

Taesan simply read the trajectory of the shadow, having grasped most of its movements. With that, Taesan made its decision.

"It's almost time."

"Yes! It's time for you to die......"

Taesan's mockery was cut short, as it had suddenly flown towards Taesan.

Taesan quickly gathered its shadowy energy and released a thorn.

Taesan dodged lightly, twisting its body.

The flying thorns passed by Taesan.

Kwa-jik.
Here is the translation of the text:

The sword of Taesan pierced through the chest of Hasaek, who was covered in darkness.

[$#@! took 23 points of damage.]

"Who, who?"

Hasaek's face contorted in rage, as if he had been ambushed.

His strength surged like a volcano eruption, and he tried to engulf Taesan with his shadow.

Taesan moved his wings and twisted his body.

The shadow split apart, emptying the air.

Hasaek shook his hand. The shadow waves spread out in all directions like a tidal wave, and Taesan dodged it and struck Hasaek's nape.

[$#@! took 26 points of damage.]

"Kak!"

Hasaek let out a scream and retreated. The pierced wound on his neck was covered in darkness, leaving no scar.

"Shh."

Taesan snarled and moved.

"Boldly! I dare you to strike my great physical body with your sword!"

Hasaek's eyes flashed with anger as he wielded his shadow.

The storm-like shadow raged at Taesan's entire body.

The wings moved. Taesan's sword sliced through Hasaek's chest.

And the wound was covered in darkness once more.

"Ha ha ha ha!"

Hasaek burst out laughing.
Here is the translation of the text:

At first, I was startled by the fact that I was attacked, but soon I realized that Taesan's attack was not a threat to me at all.

"'Just barely, it's not possible for you to hurt me that much!'"

Now, I have received the power of the gods, and the power of the gods is exactly as I said.

It's not just a trivial matter, but even mortal humans cannot approach it.

The difference in power made Taesan's attack fail to reach me.

Therefore, Taesan cannot kill me.

Having made this judgment, I further increased my power.

Even the remaining emotions were covered by the power that swept away in all directions.

"'Die!'"

Ka ka ka!

The shadow fragmented and scattered in all directions. It swallowed up everything in its path and turned the surroundings into a desolate wasteland.

It was exactly like a storm.

After the darkness shot out, there was nothing.

I unleashed a fierce roar.

"This is the end! I'm the strongest!'"

Kwa kwa kwa.

As I shouted, my chest was pierced.

In the darkness, Taesan's figure appeared, with not a single wound.

"'Ah, how...'"
"'How will it be...?'"

Taesan's hand moved. His sword cut through my entire body.

Note: I translated "태산" as "Taesan", which is likely a character name in the story. If you have any further context or clarification, please let me know.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah-ah-ah!"

Haska's face contorted as he summoned the shadows once more.

"It seems you've managed to survive, but that's all!"

Tai-san was unable to land a proper blow on him.

Haska's overwhelming advantage remained unchanged.

Haska continued to wield his strength, and Tai-san responded by thrusting his sword again and again.

Haska kicked Tai-san's leg. The shadow suddenly sprang up and attempted to engulf Tai-san.

Tai-san shook his sword.

The gathered energies at the tip of the sword collided with the shadow. A small gap appeared, and Tai-san slipped his body through it, emerging behind Haska and striking his abdomen.

"...Ah, just as I thought!"

His advantage remained unchanged.

Haska continued to control his strength.

And Tai-san responded accordingly.

[You have unleashed Marbas's Black Wave.]

The sword became a wave that rushed towards Haska.

Although the difference in their strength was significant, the wave was enough to block Haska's vision. In the brief moment when his attack was stalled, Tai-san launched another successful attack.

Haska continued to wield his strength.
Here is the translation of the text:

And everything was shattered, destroyed, and disappeared. Taesan did not allow even a single attack and struck at Haskar with a powerful blow.

"Ah, ah?"

Haskar suddenly realized.

The battle had been going on for over ten minutes, but he had not been able to hit Taesan even once, and instead was being constantly attacked.

"......Don't laugh!"

The difference in strength was clear. He had to win absolutely.

The shadow pierced the ground and rose up.

The attack was like a relentless pursuit with no place to flee, but Taesan moved his wings without changing his expression.

Pang!

The density of the shooting shadows was quickly judged, and Taesan swung his sword towards the approaching shadow.

[You have activated the "Flicker" technique.]

Kaang!

The trajectory of the shadow was distorted. The distorted shadows collided and created a void in space.

Taesan shook off the sword that was imbued with the shadow, and emerged unscathed.

Taesan blocked the attack without sustaining any significant damage and then stabbed again.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's this...?"

Haska's curses were repeatedly spat out, but the result was unchanged.

Taesan ignored Haska's powers with a nonchalant expression.

"'Clearly threatening...'

A strange, unrefined, and unbridled power that seeks to corrode the entire body just by touching it, turning it dark.

If a qualified person with legitimate authority were to wield this power, Taesan would also be threatening.

But if someone like Haska were to wield it, it would be completely unthreatening.

Haska has only been familiar with the power of the spirits so far. He has handed over all battles to the high-ranking spirits, leading them and starting battles. This is the first time he has taken the initiative to wield power.

Therefore, the movement of his power was too predictable. One could read his intentions just by looking at his eye movements, the waves of his power, and so on.

He was using the strange, unrefined power as if it were a normal spirit power, unable to utilize its true potential.

Power is nothing more than holding it, and it's useless.

Only someone with legitimate abilities can be threatening.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san disconnected his thoughts and continued the battle.

The battle was one-sided. However, it was not a good situation.

Tae-san's attacks still couldn't deal a proper amount of damage.

He lacked the intensity to make a difference.

Although he was dealing minor damage, he would be defeated before Sado-hwa's time was up.

Hassak, who had calmed down, shouted harshly.

"It's pointless! You can't win!"

"Not yet, though."

Tae-san smiled wryly.

"But that's the same for you too."

Tae-san's body began to shake.

Thorns shot out from the shadows and flew through the air.

As the battle continued, Tae-san became more and more familiar with Hassak's attack patterns.

Even if Sado-hwa ended, Hassak's strength couldn't kill him.

"Moreover, time is on my side."

"Nonsense!"

Hassak laughed. His strength was limitless. In contrast, Tae-san's strength was dwindling and his physical strength was slowly decreasing.

However, Tae-san was confident. He knew that he would win eventually.
Here is the translation of the text:

The battle continued.

Taesan dodged all the attacks.

"Ah!"

Haska's strength burst forth with a fierce counterattack, and his power exploded.

It was the moment when Taesan tried to kick out.

Snap, crackle.

The globe shattered.

A gust of wind blew from that place.

The soft and refreshing wind began to gently push away the dark land that was consumed by darkness. The shadowy figure was blocked by the wind and disappeared.

Haska's face stiffened as he felt the presence emanating from the breaking globe.

Taesan sharpened his sword.

"I thought I had to hold on for a little longer, but it's faster than I expected."

"It's impossible to make someone wait like that."

As the globe broke apart, the figure of Minerva appeared, accompanied by the voice of a mature woman.
