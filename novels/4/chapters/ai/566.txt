Chapter 567

567. The World-Destroyer (3)

The World-Destroyer becomes enraged.

Unable to accept the fact that he has been obstructed, he expresses his emotions.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

He tries to shake the universe to pieces with just his emotions. The Transcendent Being tries to prevent the World-Destroyer from unleashing his powers and spreading them throughout the universe.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The World-Destroyer lifts his foot, and it comes crashing down towards Tai Shan.

In that instant, the galaxy collapses.

There was a power contained within it.

But he was not afraid. Tai Shan did not flinch or retreat.

He draws his sword.

He controls his powers. Not only does he contain his physical strength within the sword, but he also controls all the physical forces around him that are being shaken. Even the physical forces that are scattered around him as his foot moves are under Tai Shan's control.

And then, the sword meets his foot.

Kwa-aaa-aaa-aaa!

A massive pressure is felt heading towards Tai Shan. From a pure strength perspective, it's clear that Tai Shan cannot withstand the World-Destroyer's powerful force, which is enormous and huge.

Kaga-ga-ga!

But he endures.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

He controls physical strength. His physical strength and the movements of the world-ender create all physical strength.

And he makes it his own.

He then puts the obtained physical strength into his sword.

Hmph!

Physical strength explodes. The world-ender's foot rises. The body of the mountain also tries to fall downward.

Hoooo!

But he stops the physical strength from being used and moving his body.

Kuku, kuku, ku... 

The world-ender adjusts his stance. The damage is not great. It was just a collision of forces, causing his stance to waver.

But that was a shock to the world-ender.

The mountain lightly shook his sword.

"It's not that impressive."

The world-ender's power is ultimately simple.

It's just that from the perspective of the universe, the physical strength that is wielded is from the physical strength that emerges from there. It's just that the size of the physical strength is so great that it tears the universe apart. The phrase "size of power" is accurate.

He is an existence that wields the concept of the universe in a different sense from the usurper.

But the mountain is an existence that governs physical strength itself.
Here is the translation of the text:

No matter how great the physical power of the world destroyer was, it was impossible for him to control everything that belonged to the concept of the universe.

Of course, if it were just physical power, there would be many concepts of the universe that he could not respond to. However, the problem lay in the fact that the world destroyer was self-sufficient.

The power that denied and excluded everything was preventing the transcendent beings from intervening in physical power, making the world destroyer extremely powerful.

But it was all irrelevant to Tai Shan.

Kuoooung!

The world destroyer raised his fist again. Tai Shan did not retreat and wielded his sword.

Kwa-aa-aa-ang!

The sword and fist collided. The world destroyer's physical power was being put under Tai Shan's control.

However, interference occurred in the process.

The world destroyer's power of self-sustainability. It blocked and rejected the concept of the universe. It was trying to reject Tai Shan's control over physical power.

But it was irrelevant to Tai Shan.

Kudukuduk.

A boundary dispute occurred. It collided with self-sustainability. The two heterogeneous things mixed and shook, creating a gap for the concept of the universe to intervene.
Here is the translation of the text:

Then, Taesan intervened in the physical power of the World Crushing God, and seized it.

Oh no!

The World Crushing God was pushed back again.

Throughout this process, Taesan did not feel any burden.

The boundary defiance that he possessed was originally the World Crushing God's authority. It was self-sustaining.

He seized the fragments and absorbed them into his authority.

This became the death of the struggle, and he was reborn with a new authority.

As a result, the basic structure was similar to self-sustainability. To some extent, the power compatibility occurred.

Originally, it was supposed to be a perfect sub-compatibility, so it was not possible to exert any influence on the World Crushing God.

However, the boundary defiance was mixed with the concept of the universe.

If we consider the power itself as a constraint, it may be pushed back, but the mixed concept is a peculiarity that does not yield to self-sustainability.

The physical power and the boundary defiance were not enough to defeat the World Crushing God, but they were sufficient to withstand the pressure.

And Taesan's power was not limited to that.

"Then, shall we try?"

He confirmed how far he could respond with the two powers. Now it was time to deal with other powers.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san's body moved. He was rushing towards the World Crusher at an incredibly fast speed.

Ku-ku-ku-ku!

His fist swung around.

Tae-san did not dodge. He did not swing his sword, but instead charged forward.

Just as his fist was about to hit Tae-san, Tae-san opened himself up.

And his fist was swallowed by Tae-san.

The power of the World Devourer, which could swallow and digest everything, was now being exerted within Tae-san.

The World Crusher's body began to sink into Tae-san's stomach. The World Crusher, unaware of what was happening, had already retrieved his fist.

The World Crusher trembled. His power was not exhausted or broken, but rather... he had vanished.

It was as if he had fallen into something.

"It's tough to clash bare-handed."

Tae-san felt a sense of burden, as if he was facing an attack from an existence at the level of the World Crusher. It seemed that he would be subjected to a significant burden if he were to face the World Crusher head-on.

So, he didn't face him head-on.

He slowly devoured him, and his body moved at an incredibly fast speed.

Kwa-a-a-a!

His body accelerated, with his physical limits stretched to the limit. He wrapped his arms around the World Crusher's body.

Ka-ka-ka-ka!
Here is the translation of the text:

The body of the World Crusher is connected to his arm.

And the self-sustaining entity that wraps around his body falls into the abyss. Although it's small, it's undoubtedly lost its power.

The World Crusher responds. He swings his body violently. He tries to shake off the Tai Shan, swinging it with a rough wave.

"Can't be done."

However, this physical strength has no meaning to Tai Shan. He swings his hand. He changes all the physical forces generated by the wave into his own possession.

And he swings again.

Zzzz...!

The World Crusher's strength is overwhelming him. His body is slightly swaying, and Tai Shan has fallen back into the abyss, its self-sustaining entity exhausted.

Cgugugung... ...

He devours and swings. Although there is no major damage, the World Crusher continues to struggle.

The World Crusher has made a decision. This cannot continue.

He is a high-shining god who has killed countless transcendent beings. It wasn't just a simple exercise of physical strength.

The World Crusher's self-sustaining entity is strengthened. The power accumulated in his fist becomes denser and more concentrated.

Tai Shan's abyss cannot hold back its power.

"Is it a concentration of power?"
Here is the translation of the text:

It was inevitable that it would be wasted even with the lowest level of power. Additionally, the boundary was also unclear, making it difficult to block properly.

However, Tai San had not yet fully utilized all its powers.

If the opponent focused its strength to respond, Tai San would do the same, gathering its strength.

The boundary beast was attached to Tai San's sword. It became one with physical strength.

He swung it as is. A collision of pure strength and strength.

A loud sound burst forth. Tai San did not retreat even a step. It galloped through the gap of the world destroyer's trembling, with its chest pounding.

It contained everything and thrust the sword. It erased its own unchanging self with the lowest level of power and inserted the sword into its naked body.

[You have activated the multiplication.]

Zzzz!

The world destroyer's body was pushed back, stumbling.

Tai San had sharpened its sword.

There was a reddish liquid stuck to that sword.

"The blood of a heroic soul is also red."

As I had seen the blood droplets before, it was not that surprising.

Tai San flung its body again.

And the transcendent beings who had witnessed that battle were all watching.

[What's this... that's it.]

The god of control murmured to himself.

[It's too easy to counterattack.]
Here is the translation of the text:

It's not impossible to face a crisis. The attack from the World's Strongest Man could have dealt a significant blow to Tai Sui. Tai Sui was also fighting back with all his might.

However, that's not all.

He's not pulling out all the stops or using his strongest cards against his opponent. Instead, he's gradually unleashing his powers, one by one, to attack his opponent.

It was almost too easy.

It seemed like he was solving a puzzle of moderate difficulty. This scene was a huge shock to the gods. Even Hehil said, "If it were someone else, I wouldn't have been able to respond so easily. But since it's the World's Strongest Man, it's not a problem at all."

Tai Sui and the World's Strongest Man were, in fact, evenly matched. They were similar in terms of physical strength and boundary control, but Tai Sui's powers didn't stop there.

The God of Compression said in a tone that was hard to understand.

"Are you dealing with several powers? Physical strength, self-preservation, and similar powers. The power of the Mysterious Depths. And the boundary. There were four. Moreover, it seemed like he still had some reserves left.

"I didn't think it would be this easy."

Here is the translation of the text:

If the world's strongest being were to exert all its strength to crush Mount Tai, Mount Tai would have to sacrifice its life and consume many things. Even if it's an extraordinary being, the world's strongest being has the power to overcome it.

This is because Mount Tai has already obtained a certain power.

The power of the underworld. The profound abyss that swallows everything.

This is a power that can swallow everything without using any power or energy at all. It's a power that can swallow everything, no matter what.

Even if it's a divine power or a self-sustaining power, it's still a power that can swallow everything.

Mount Tai swallowed the self-sustaining power of the underworld and pierced through the remaining parts with its unbroken physical force and boundary. Therefore, Mount Tai was able to respond easily to the world's strongest being's attack.

[Is it the usurpation of the divine?]

Ehilir whispered to himself.

He was a god who had taken his seat in the labyrinth.

He knew about the power of Mount Tai.

Mount Tai takes the power of someone it defeats.

Even if it's a divine being or a transcendent being, it's the same.

During the era of ascension to the divine, Mount Tai only took a small part of the power, but after the usurpation of the divine, it took the entire concept of power for itself.

It was really an unbelievable thing.

Every time Mount Tai defeats a divine being or a transcendent being, it takes the entire power for itself and makes it its own.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he crushed the enemy, he became increasingly powerful, almost exponentially so.

The Great Master's true abilities were not apparent to anyone, not even to the gods.

Hoo-ah!

Blood was splattered in a crimson hue.

As the World Crusher's attack whirled around him, the Great Master unsheathed his sword.

"It's getting bigger and uglier."

Although the damage was accumulating slowly, it was significant enough to be noticeable even from a cosmic perspective. However, it was nothing more than a scratch.

It can't be defeated with a simple attack.

"'It's human-shaped.'"

Then what about its weak point?

[You have activated your full surveillance [perimeter].]

He gazes at the World Crusher. He surveys the gods. Although he doesn't understand its concept and origin, he can grasp its physical form to some extent.

As a result, the Great Master realized.

The World Crusher's structure is not much different from that of a human.

Its weak point is also the same.

Then...

After a brief moment of contemplation, the Great Master made his decision.

He infused power into his feet. His body accelerated through the universe. He aimed his sword directly at the World Crusher's chest.

Here is the translation of the text:

The world's strongest warrior is enraged. Before Mount Tai, there was no defense or evasion. It was a movement to break through with pure strength.

Ku, ku, ku, ku, ku!

Filled with anger, he clenches his fist. The unchanging power is concentrated in the fist.

Wu, wu!

The fist begins to move.

The universe is distorted and destroyed. Mount Tai did not dodge. He pulled out the Mu Jia Gang, controlled the boundaries, and stored all the physical strength.

Kwaa, kwaa, kwaa, kwaa, kwaa!

The universe is torn apart. The four transcendental beings wield their powers to block the aftermath.

Wa, wa!

The Mu Jia Gang rises and loses its unchanging nature. And the boundary contradiction devours the remaining power, eliminating it, and directly connects with the physical body and the boundaries of the world's strongest warrior.

Je, je, je!

Gold appears on the arm of the world's strongest warrior.

The blood vessels burst, and a red liquid splashed in all directions. A wound has appeared on the unchanging physical body of the world's strongest warrior.

The world's strongest warrior does not retreat. Even if he is injured, he will undoubtedly crush Mount Tai with his strong will.

And it seems to be successful. The Mu Jia Gang and the boundary contradiction that had wrapped around Mount Tai began to slowly dissipate.

Joyful emotions appear on the face of the world's strongest warrior.

His fist has touched Mount Tai.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Your first absolute invalidation of attack has been activated."

And your fist, although just a little, definitely retreats backwards.

If it were the current Tai Shan, it could have activated the attack invalidation to some extent against the High God.

I was aiming for this from the start. The World Crusher trembled, and Tai Shan did not miss the opportunity. He spins like a meteor while twisting his sword.

Leaving a long scar, he reaches the World Crusher's chest. He inserts the sword deeply into it.
