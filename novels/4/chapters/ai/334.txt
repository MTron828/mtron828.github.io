Chapter 335

335. The World of the Ghost's Demise (6)

Levansia had Bardley's child.

The ghost was greatly shocked by this fact.

[She... had my child...]

"I didn't know."

[...I didn't know.]

The ghost's trembling lips opened.

[I wandered to fulfill the prophecy. In the process, I never returned to the imperial city. I never met Levansia. And when I finally returned...]

It was already after the demon king had destroyed the empire.

[I, I...]

The ghost held his breath.

He had accepted the destruction of the world. He had finished settling his mind.

But even so, his heart was still wildly wavering now.

[Just for a moment, just for a moment.]

The ghost barely spoke.

[Just leave me alone for a moment.]

With those words, the ghost's figure disappeared.

It was not like when he was chased away by the gods, but rather the ghost had hidden his body of his own will.

Taesan was alone for the first time in a long while.

'The God of Regret.'

It was a trial fitting for the realm of regret.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The ghost made a contract with the wizard. Therefore, the dead man could exist as a ghost in the labyrinth.

The ghost's role was to meet adventurers, give them quests, reward them, and fulfill its own desires.

And the ghost's desire, which it had made a contract with the wizard to fulfill, was revenge.

It was to watch the guides of evil be killed.

In other words, if Taesan defeated the guides of evil, the ghost could no longer exist as a ghost.

The dead ghost could do nothing.

Taesan also couldn't do anything about it. As it was a contract between the wizard and the ghost, interference was impossible.

Although the ghost's appearance was invisible, Taesan could sense that it was by his side.

However, Taesan didn't call out to the ghost. There was nothing he could do for it now.

Waiting for his thoughts to settle on their own was the right answer.

Regardless, the past time began to flow.

People poured more energy into their training, preparing for the impending battle that would soon arrive.

Taesan confirmed the power contained in his sword by fulfilling the prophecy.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**The Relic of Calvert: The Sword that Inherited the Ancestors' Blood**

[Currently, it's a relic of a world that has been destroyed. It has taken the lives of many imperial families.]

[Attack Power + 500]

[When facing all enemies, Attack Power + 150]

[By fulfilling the prophecy of the world, its power has been infused into the sword. When facing the Demon King, who brings destruction, the power to defeat him is granted to the master of the prophecy.]

Not only did the simple attack power increase by 200, but a new special effect was also born.

A powerful energy could be felt from the Relic of Calvert.

It was not just a simple power, but a will to resist destruction.

The exact effect could be confirmed after meeting the Demon King.

However, the Demon King did not appear.

Tired of waiting, Taesan moved.

He traveled the world, checking every location.

It was not just to enjoy the scenery. He was looking for a place to fulfill the conditions to acquire skills.

Taesan acquired many skills. Among them were skills he couldn't acquire in his previous life.

However, he still hadn't acquired all the skills from his previous life.

There were still many core skills left, such as Copy, Simple Time Stop, Multiply, Designate Skill Initialization, and Essence Strike.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In the case of essential strikes, it was somewhat okay. If I mastered the essential grasp and vital point designation to 100%, I could learn it. The condition to reacquire it wasn't that difficult either.

But the other skills were different.

Especially copying, temporary time stop, multiplication, and skill reset. These four skills were the problem.

They required extremely high acquisition conditions, proportional to their value.

Even Taesan, who had obtained many skills, didn't have the confidence to reacquire them.

It was only possible to acquire them through extreme situations, extremely good luck, and instantaneous inspiration and response. All of those factors had to come together.

"There's none."

Taesan, who had traveled half the world, gave up. He searched everywhere, but couldn't find a place to obtain skills in the ghost world.

For now, he continued to descend into the labyrinth, searching for a place to obtain skills.

If what Itaeyon had said was true, and those layers still existed, there was a possibility of obtaining a few skills.

Taesan, who had returned to the imperial city, quietly continued to think about acquiring skills.

During that time, the ghost didn't appear even once.

And so, a week passed, and it descended upon this world.

* * *

"It's noisy."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

In the royal palace, a man bit his tongue.

Envoys from the empire had been coming continuously. "The demon king will soon descend, so let's cooperate with the empire to prevent the destruction of the world."

However, the old man who ruled the kingdom refused to cooperate with the empire.

"There's no way a demon king exists in this world."

The old man sneered. The demon king was a legendary figure from ancient times. It was impossible for such a being to descend upon this world and destroy it.

The empire was spreading rumors that the demon king would appear to conquer the world. The old man judged it to be a lie, so he rejected all of the empire's requests for cooperation.

The citizens of the kingdom were anxious and rebellious, trying to flee the kingdom, but the old man's mind did not change.

"Your Majesty!"

The door burst open, and the knight commander came in with a worried face.

"There's someone at the entrance of the kingdom."

"Guide him in."

The old man bit his tongue and went outside.

At the entrance of the kingdom, there was a man.

He was a young man.

He had pale white skin without a single blemish, wore black clothes, and held a large sword.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

An ominous feeling. It seemed to emanate a sense of being substantialized. The soldiers facing him trembled, but the old man was unfazed.

"I've prepared well in the empire."

The man in front of him was a decoy scattered by the empire to spread false rumors. The old man didn't believe it.

"Kill him and hang his head at the entrance of the royal palace. Then, the empire won't dare to intervene."

"Yes, yes..."

The soldiers cautiously approached the man.

Even as the sharp sword drew near, the man stood still, his face pale.

"...Why am I here?"

The man muttered quietly.

His soft voice pierced the soldiers' ears.

"I should have destroyed this place."

The soldiers' bodies trembled as they met the man's indifferent gaze.

"Ugh..."

They couldn't approach him anymore. The old man, who had been watching, shouted in frustration.

"What are you doing? Kill him!"

Even with the king's order, the soldiers couldn't approach him. An instinctual fear that couldn't be overcome by human power stood before them.

The man, who had observed them, nodded his head.

"This is a fake."

The man instinctively knew it.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He had completed all the tasks he was assigned.

In other words, this place was a fake created by something intervening.

"My duties remain unchanged."

As the man murmured, the energy he felt growing stronger. The soldiers' faces turned pale.

"Aaah!"

One soldier, unable to bear the fear, closed his eyes and stabbed the man with a sword.

The sword touched the darkness surrounding the man, and then it was swallowed and disappeared.

"Ah."

One soldier was swallowed by the darkness and disappeared. The old man watching from the side took a step back in shock.

"How dare you! You've harmed the kingdom's soldiers! You're a being of the Empire! I won't stand idly by!"

"Be quiet."

The man spoke softly. The darkness began to spread slowly.

"Oh, oh, oh, oh!"

The darkness engulfed the entire kingdom.

The soldiers were at a loss, unable to do anything.

"The world will fall into silence."

With those final words, the darkness rose.

The ancient castle walls, the magnificent palace, the villages where people lived...

All of it was swallowed by the darkness, leaving nothing behind.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The devil king enjoyed the silence that even swallowed the sound of the wind, and he took a step forward.

* * *

The devil king appeared.

The rumor that the nearby kingdom was destroyed spread rapidly. The devil king's monsters began to trample the world at a rapid pace.

The empire moved. The kingdoms that decided to cooperate with the empire also began to take action quickly.

Knights and soldiers gathered from each country.

And the devil king continued to advance.

He scattered thick and deep darkness as he went forward. Since he had no intention of hiding himself, everyone knew where the devil king was.

And in such a situation, it was natural for fools who couldn't objectify themselves to come out.

"You, devil king! I am the brave warrior who will defeat you! Meet your death before my sword!"

A young man boldly declared in front of the devil king. The devil king swung his darkness indifferently. The young man charged forward with a battle cry, but was immediately engulfed in the darkness and disappeared.

The young man who believed himself to be a brave warrior in the devil king's mind disappeared in an instant.

The devil king soon arrived at a castle.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Demon King sensed the chaos within the castle walls. This kingdom, like the previous one, had dismissed the rumors of the Demon King's appearance as mere gossip and had refused to cooperate with the empire.

They were not prepared to fight. The soldiers were panicking, overwhelmed with fear, and trying to flee in disarray.

"They're not even worth fighting."

Darkness spread far and wide.

The darkness that stained the land rose up and engulfed the kingdom.

Fear and terror, without exception, became part of the Demon King's power.

The Demon King passed by the ruins that had been engulfed.

His face was filled with disappointment.

"You are truly foolish people."

Despite knowing that they had the means to destroy themselves, they did not work together to prevent the destruction of the world. Even in a situation where they had to combine their strength to counter the great enemy that was the Demon King, the beings of this world did not do so.

They did not cooperate, prioritizing their own interests and greed, even when faced with a powerful enemy. They abandoned their prophecies and were destroyed for the sake of small gains.

They were truly foolish beings. The Demon King sighed deeply.

"I had hoped that there would be some difference, but... there's nothing."

Even in a world that was fake, they remained foolish.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Demon King began to move again to destroy the world.

* * *

The Demon King arrived at another castle. He, who was about to devour everything with his power, hesitated for a moment.

Inside the castle, fear and terror filled the air.

But they did not back down.

They formed a disorganized line, grasping their weapons and trying to suppress their trembling hearts to confront him.

The Demon King recalled the darkness he had spread. He took a step forward and approached the castle gate.

"Everyone! Fire! For the world!"

With a shout filled with determination, arrows and rocks rained down. Boiling hot oil poured down towards the Demon King.

The darkness surrounding the Demon King rose up and absorbed all the attacks.

Despite their attacks not working, the people of the kingdom did not give up. They passionately launched attacks to try and deal damage to the Demon King.

The Demon King, who had been watching them with a cold gaze, drew his sword.

In the past, when he destroyed the world, he had never used a sword. There was no value in the world worth drawing his sword for.

But this time was different.

He drew his sword and drew a line of death.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ku-gu-gu-gung!"

The loud noise and the castle walls crumbled together. The king entered inside, passing through the collapsing walls.

"Kill him!"

"For the world!"

The soldiers grasped their spears and charged towards the king.

It wasn't a reckless charge like the first kingdom.

It was an attack that risked their lives to take down the king.

A small smile appeared on the king's lips.

The king swung his sword, knocking down the soldiers and advancing forward. Even in the face of overwhelming power, the soldiers did not back down.

The king, who had knocked down everyone and advanced, soon arrived in front of the person who seemed to be the king.

The king had a futile, yet determined expression, holding his sword.

"You are the king... a monster."

"You will die."

"It doesn't matter. I had already resolved to sacrifice myself from the start, which is why I'm here."

The king's appearance was faster than the empire's expectations. It would take time for the warriors from each country to gather.

The kingdom had taken on that role itself.

It was gathering those who would become sacrifices to block the king and save the world, which is why they were here.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even if I die in this place, humanity will triumph over you!"

The king charged at the Demon King with faith.

The Demon King quietly laughed and swung his sword.

The king's falling face was filled with the conviction that they would triumph.

"Something's different this time."

The Demon King muttered, sheathing his sword.

In the past, there were those who tried to stop him when he was about to destroy the world.

However, they didn't truly understand the concept of the Demon King. They thought he was just a powerful being and tried to defeat him.

But this time was different.

They knew what kind of existence they were. And yet, they believed that humanity could win without a doubt.

A deep smile spread across the Demon King's lips.

He was the Demon King.

A device for destruction.

What he desired was not simply the destruction of the world.

He wanted to see the world's will.

He wanted to see them unite their powers, believe in the hero, and confront destruction with true meaning. That was the one desire he had as a device.

"I understand your will. But I am the Demon King."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He tramples on all will and destroys the world, which is his mission.

The Demon King takes a step forward.

Distorted creatures begin to emerge from the darkness.

[Uuuuuuuuu!]

Monsters appear. There were ones as large as mountains, and ones as small as insects.

All of them were the Demon King's minions.

They charged forward to trample the world."
