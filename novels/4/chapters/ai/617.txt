**Chapter 618**

**618. The Outer Story, The Magician of the Labyrinth (1)**

"It's me first."

The magician chuckled and said, his face beaming with a smile. Taesan looked at him with an expression that seemed to say, "I knew you'd say that."

"If you think about it, you've received a lot from me."

The most fundamental reason he was able to reach this place was the labyrinth itself.

The magician shook his head.

"I just laid out the board. It's all thanks to your power. I should be the one thanking you instead."

The magician's voice was filled with a warm enthusiasm.

"Your journey has been incredibly meaningful to me as well. I've never regretted creating the labyrinth, but the thought that I created it for this purpose is overwhelming."

His face was filled with deep satisfaction.

"Well... let's get back to the main topic."

The magician organized his thoughts. He gazed at Taesan with a calm, settled expression.

"Taesan, do you know what god I was before I became the Magician of the Labyrinth?"

"No."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The realm of the magician was a place where everything was mixed up and nothing could be understood. Even if it was the greatest mountain, grasping its essence was difficult.

"Who am I?"

The magician said, but it was more like a murmur to himself than a question.

"Why did I create this labyrinth?"

"I wanted to see the adventures and journeys of mortals."

"That's correct."

The magician smiled faintly. It was a phrase he had been saying unchanged since the first time they met.

"It's not exactly that, but similar. I sacrificed everything to create this labyrinth."

Thinking about it, it was a very strange thing.

The original magician must have been a transcendent being, but creating a space like this meant they weren't a weak transcendent being.

They must have been a transcendent being who could grasp the concept of the universe and exert a universal influence.

But that was limited to just a small space, the labyrinth.

The one who could control the box itself had imprisoned themselves in the box.

And that was for no one else but to see the journeys of mortals.

That wasn't the only strange thing. There was one condition in the labyrinth: if you conquered the labyrinth, you could have one wish granted, whatever it may be.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If Taesan had wanted to, he could have taken the entire labyrinth into his hands.

It was also possible for the magician to devour the achievements he had built up over his lifetime in one bite.

The labyrinth was something the magician had created by sacrificing himself. It was a kind of realm and concept. To think that he would hand it over to someone else just because he had conquered it was an absurd story.

"Do you regret it?"

"No."

The magician smiled faintly.

There was no hint of regret in that smile.

"Not at all. I'm very satisfied with my current state. But other transcenders don't understand me, which makes me curious. You, who are different, can you understand me?"

A low voice whispered.

"What I want from you is to see the process."

The magician, who was once a transcender, wanted to see the process of how he became the labyrinth's magician with his own eyes.

That was the magician's wish.

"Will you grant it?"

Taesan nodded his head. He was also curious. What had the magician who created the labyrinth wanted in the beginning? The magician seemed satisfied, snapping his fingers.

"Good. Then let's go right away."

"Do you need to prepare?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'm different from God, so you don't need to intervene directly. It's just a simple show."

And the world is in chaos. The mountain did not resist. A quiet voice echoes in the twisted world.

"What do you think? I'm curious."

* * *

In the middle of a dark and vast desert.

In a place where there is no sign of life, the man looked up at the sky.

The vast and wide sky.

In the darkness like ink, the moon and stars shine.

People will gaze up at that sky and estimate the unreachable distance.

They will deify the moon and stars and pray to the gods who reside beyond.

And now, he can overturn that very sky.

He can break the moon and control the stars.

It's as if he's the ruler of the world.

The man has lived his entire life for his own desires.

An ordinary person would have died in the process, but he was a genius.

A genius who could understand and control all things.

And countless layers of fate.

In the end, he achieved his desires and reached a great height.

He achieved what he had wanted his whole life through his own will.

He was a transcender.

He became a god.

His journey had ended right here, at this moment.

* * *

Time had passed since the man became a transcender.

The past became history, history became legend, and legend became myth, which was an extremely long time by human standards.

And the man was disappointed.

At first, he felt a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment, having reached a high level and succeeded.

But that was only temporary.

After that, he felt an unbearable emptiness.

"What is this?"

Since becoming a transcender, he had never felt this emptiness disappear. It was as if a hole had been created in his stomach, and no matter how much he ate, he couldn't fill it.

At the same time, it was a feeling he had never experienced during his mortal days.

Was this a feeling that came with being a transcender?

He thought so at first, but no matter how much time passed, the emptiness was not filled.

The emptiness was slowly but surely consuming him.

The man wanted to do something about this emptiness.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

First, he tried to relive the hardships and ordeals he had experienced in his mortal life.

The ordeals he had barely overcome by risking his life now seemed simpler than snapping his fingers.

He was proud of the heights he had reached.

But that was all.

He didn't feel any sense of accomplishment from his actions.

The hardships and ordeals he had struggled with now felt like looking at something far away.

It was hard for him to overcome them on his own.

Then, what about those who had become transcenders before him?

This emptiness was something that had arisen when he became a transcender. Then, other transcenders must also have this emptiness.

He went to find other transcenders.

The first one he found was the God of Struggle and Death, Lakirates. Among the transcenders, he was one of the oldest and his strength was exceptional.

The man asked Lakirates about his own emptiness.

"There's no such thing," Lakirates said bluntly.

"Emptiness? I've never felt it before."

"……Is that so."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The man was slightly surprised. His emptiness had been there since he became a transcendent being. He thought other transcendent beings would also have it, but they didn't.

Next, he went to see the God of Victory.

[Don't you know?]

The God of Victory also didn't seem to feel the emptiness. Next, he visited the God of Choice. The God of Choice listened to the man's concerns a bit longer.

[I've never felt it before... Is it emptiness? Then, what if I turn my attention to somewhere else?]

"Is that so?"

[Don't you have weak things that believe in you?]

The man nodded. It had been a while since he took the position of a transcendent being. There were quite a few mortals who revered him.

[Give trials to the weak things that believe in you. See how far they'll follow your path and how they'll worship you. And then, choose the ones who please you and make them your disciples. That's a joyful thing in its own way.]

"That's right."

When he thought about it, he had never created a disciple before.

The man followed the God of Choice's words.

He selected talented individuals from among his serving mortals and gave them trials.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They rejoiced and risked their lives to challenge the trials.

Among them, there were those who died, but there were also those who overcame their trials and reached a higher level.

It was somewhat enjoyable. The mortals who tried to solve their trials in any way were pitiful.

But that was all.

His emptiness did not disappear.

This method wouldn't work. The man continued to seek another god.

The one who was a transcendent being from birth couldn't understand at all.

[What's with this emptiness? What are you talking about?]

The god of death spoke with a puzzled expression.

[Do your duty. You are the concept god who governs the universe's concept. Control and govern the concept you dominate.]

The man didn't speak anymore because their conversation didn't match.

The transcendent beings couldn't answer his question.

So, he gathered the mortals of the planet.

"If you answer my question, I will grant your wishes."

A great god's declaration.

A self-proclaimed sage.

A great swindler.

Even a young child who couldn't even walk.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Everyone came to find him. They passionately tried to resolve the man's doubts.

But no words could reach his heart.

The emptiness did not disappear.

Nothing could be the answer to his question.

What could he do to get rid of this emptiness? No matter how hard he thought, he couldn't feel it. Neither the transcendent nor the mortal could provide an answer to his question.

So he returned to the desert where he had become a transcendent being, feeling numb.

He spent his time quietly there.

He didn't do anything, literally.

If doing something would only fill him with emptiness, it was better to do nothing.

Time passed and passed. Only the desert sandstorm bothered his ears.

[It seems like it's free.]

And how much time had passed?

A laughter-mixed voice was heard.

The man was slightly surprised. He hadn't thought that being would come to find him.

"......Hello."

[Yes. It's been a long time. How long has it been?]

"It seems like it's the first time since I became a transcendent being."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The man bowed his head respectfully. He was a transcendent being, a conceptual god. There was no one who could be his example anywhere.

But the being in front of him was different. The man spoke respectfully.

"It's been a long time. God of Cycles, Arilnan."

Arilnan also smiled and replied.

"Yes, it's been a long time. God of Adventure."
