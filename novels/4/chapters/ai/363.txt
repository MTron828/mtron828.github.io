Chapter 364

364. 76th Floor, The Child of God's Blood (4)

The power that had been manifested towards the child on the other side of the space.

It contained divine power. It was impossible for ordinary strength to exert this level of power beyond space.

There was only one such existence in this world.

"You damn unbeliever!"

The knight gritted his teeth and stomped his foot. Light enveloped the knight's entire body.

"It doesn't seem like you're going to answer."

Then, he was going to force an answer out of him.

The knight, wrapped in divine power, charged towards Taesan. A golden sword was materialized in his hand.

The sword aimed for Taesan's neck.

Taesan raised his sword.

Clang!

The sound of swords clashing echoed. Taesan parried the knight's sword and stabbed him in the chest.

Kaah!

"Ugh!"

The knight spat out blood and stumbled backward.

The armor pierced by the sword was dented.

"My, my armor...…"

"Isn't it broken?"

The knight was shocked that his armor was dented, and Taesan was shocked that it didn't break.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The difference in power between Taesan and the knight was clear-cut and insurmountable. It was normal for the knight to be knocked down with a single blow, but somehow, the knight was enduring.

The reason was the power granted to the knight by someone.

Taesan took a step forward. His body disappeared.

The knight's instincts sounded the alarm. Reflexively, he turned his body and swung his sword.

Kaang!

"Kkkk!"

Taesan applied pressure at a level that the knight could barely block. The knight was sweating profusely and barely managed to defend himself.

"This is fun."

Taesan slowly observed the knight's power.

The knight's own power was not particularly exceptional. It was similar to the swordmasters he had met in the world of Berserkeseta.

However, the divine power granted to him was elevating him to the level of the 50th floor of the labyrinth.

"Can a god's apostle, who is not even a transcendent, grant this much power?"

Taesan muttered to himself and swung his sword down.

Kaang!

The ground beneath the knight's feet caved in, blocked by his sword.

"Monster!"

The knight was shocked.

Even though he was using the power granted to him by the Emperor himself, he was being pushed back without being able to put up a decent resistance.

"But!"

Taesan was being careless.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The knight aimed for the gap in the mountain's defense.

Ka-gak!

The mountain swung its sword to block the knight's attack. The knight's eyes shone brightly as he took a powerful step forward.

"Die!"

Ki-ii-ying!

The sword shone with a light like the sun. It was the knight's full power, pouring all his strength into a single sword.

The sword pierced the mountain's chest.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

But it couldn't penetrate.

The golden light that touched the mountain was being repelled.

"What, what?"

"There's a difference in our strength."

The mountain grabbed the knight's neck and slammed him to the ground.

Even if he received power, he couldn't overcome the difference in strength. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't even consume the mountain's attack nullification.

"I also have questions to answer. So, will you answer me?"

Three proofs were activated.

The mountain's strength itself was materializing, starting to crush the knight.

"Ah...…."

The knight's face turned pale. His mind was about to surrender to the mountain, and his body trembled like a willow tree.

He couldn't do anything.

There was a difference in strength that could stop his actions with just his will.

It was the moment when Taesan was trying to extract information from the knight.

Keeeee!

A pillar of light fell from the sky. The pillar, which seemed to burn the earth itself, contained a power that even Taesan couldn't underestimate.

[You activated a limited blink.]

Taesan quickly escaped the range of the pillar. The pillar pierced the knight.

"Aaaaah!"

The knight screamed and turned to ashes. The power within him flowed somewhere through the pillar of light.

When the pillar of light disappeared, nothing was left.

"Cold-blooded."

It seemed that Taesan was going to handle the information himself, rather than relying on others.

Taesan turned back to the child. Taesan, who had sent the wolves away, looked at the child.

The Emperor was aiming for this child.

His obsession was never weak. It seemed that he would stop at nothing to obtain the child.

Taesan took out a leaf with divine blood on it.

This divine blood was the most important information. Now that he had grasped it, there was no reason to hesitate.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated Beyond the Boundary.] [You have activated Magic Overlap.] [You have activated Concentrated Detection.]

You release Concentrated Detection.

When you activated it before, you couldn't grasp the information contained in the divine blood. But it's different now. Taesan has activated Beyond the Boundary, forcibly bringing the power beyond mortality.

Even if there's a power higher than Taesan's, he can understand it.

The information and power contained in the leaf have flowed into Taesan's mind.

"I see."

Taesan pressed his forehead, suppressing the pain. Using the power beyond mortality to detect means reading information that the current Taesan can't accept, which would mentally overwhelm him. That's why he had been delaying the activation of Beyond the Boundary.

But it was worth it.

He hasn't learned everything, but he's grasped all the necessary information.

"Is this the real power of God?"

The divine blood is literally the power of God.

It's a power that transcends mortality, flowing through his veins.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, having divine blood does not mean that anyone can surpass mortality. Therefore, most people with divine blood live ordinary lives and die.

To be precise, it was closer to having divine blood sealed within their bodies.

Therefore, most people with divine blood lived ordinary lives and died.

But even so, it was a power that could surpass mortality. If one could surpass a certain realm, they could control it like Helia, even if it was forced.

If Helia, who was at the end of mortality, could become that strong, then someone stronger than her could control it even more freely and strongly.

For example, if one reached the realm of Taesan, it would be possible.

The boundary referred to the state of being one step away from both mortality and immortality.

It was a state that was stronger than the realm of mortality, but clearly weaker than that of an immortal.

And if someone in such a situation were to acquire divine blood...

Perhaps they could surpass the boundary.

Taesan gazed quietly at the sleeping child.

The child said, "I couldn't endure the pain and went to the divine temple, where an oracle was given. I received a curse from all things, and only the Emperor can lift that curse."

The method to lift the curse was for the child with divine blood to become a sacrifice to the Emperor themselves.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When a being with a self becomes an offering, does it mean nothing if someone else forces it upon them?"

[It loses its meaning. An offering is about dedicating oneself, after all. The intentions of both the one making the offering and the one receiving it are crucial. They must come to an agreement and accept it.]

The ghost said. Taesan shook his head.

Why did the god of choice send himself to the child's side?

Now, it seemed like he knew what she wanted.

* * *

The child moved to the next trial location. Even after a day passed, Taesan defended against the curse, and nothing happened again.

"Haha... what's going on..."

The child shook his head, feeling utterly frustrated.

"Why?"

The child was trapped in a long despair and eventually gave up, deciding to become the emperor's sacrifice. It was for the seven trials.

But as soon as he entered the trial, the curse suddenly lifted.

The child couldn't understand.

"Maybe... because I tried to kill myself, the curse disappeared? Then, I'm now..."

The child muttered to himself repeatedly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They continued on their way and finally arrived at a small rural village.

"Huh?"

The child's eyes widened.

The village was very lively. Many people were laughing and chatting, and various foods were laid out on the stalls.

"Is this a village festival?"

A small, unique festival that seemed to be happening in every village. It looked like it was underway.

"……."

The child stared blankly at the festival.

Taesan asked the child.

"Do you want to participate?"

"Yes, no... I mean, I'm a cursed child. If I participate in something like a festival......"

The child's words trailed off.

The child hung their head in shame.

"But, I..."

"But isn't the curse only active for one day? And right now, the curse isn't active. It's okay to participate."

"But..."

The child wanted to participate in the festival, but at the same time, they were afraid of their own curse and hesitated. Taesan spoke softly.

"It's your choice. Do you want to enjoy the festival?"

"......Yes."

"Then let's go."

Taesan led the child into the festival.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The child looked around the festival with a sense of wonder. Because they were wearing a robe, the villagers thought they were a traveler with Taesan.

"Hey, mister! Is that your kid?"

A sturdy man asked Taesan with a smile. Taesan nodded, and the man handed over a skewer with a chuckle.

"You're an outsider, aren't you? Kid, this is a service! Enjoy it and take it with you!"

"Ah, thank you."

The child received the skewer with a word of gratitude.

As they slowly unwrapped the skewer, their eyes widened in amazement.

"Delicious...!"

The child had lived alone. The flavor of the seasoning, carefully crafted by people, had taken over their brain.

The child, who had been staring at the skewer, suddenly made a big decision and handed it over to Taesan.

"This is delicious. You eat it."

"I'm fine, you eat it."

"Ah, thank you!"

The child quickly devoured the skewer.

The festival continued.

A performer who seemed to be a magician appeared, and a bird that could speak like a person caught everyone's attention. The child was no exception, watching with sparkling eyes and walking around among the crowd.

However, the child didn't let go of Taesan's hand, which they were holding onto.

"......It's nice."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The child murmured.

It was a short phrase, but it contained a lot of emotions.

Taesan opened his mouth.

"Do you envy an ordinary life?"

"Yes."

The child nodded. In his gaze, there was a boy of the same age holding hands with his parents and laughing as they strolled around.

"If I had been born ordinary, if I hadn't been born with blue blood... what would it have been like? Could I have lived happily too?"

The child's voice was filled with despair that was uncommon for his age.

Taesan spoke.

"If you could have lived that life?"

"Yes?"

"If your blood was just blue and didn't hinder your life, if you could have lived together with others despite being persecuted for having blue blood, would you have made the same choice as you did now?"

"What do you mean?"

The child looked puzzled, not understanding Taesan's words.

"You'll find out soon."

Taesan looked up at the sky.

A powerful force was gathering from afar, trying to manifest itself in the world.

Zzzt.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The gold begins to seep into the ground.

The space distorts.

"What?"

The child's expression stiffens. The child knew from past experiences what this was a sign of.

"No, the day hasn't even ended yet!"

"Is the child searching for hope and getting impatient? How pathetic."

"Quick, we have to get out of here fast! If we don't, this village will..."

The child desperately grabs Taesan's arm.

But before that, a loud rumbling sound occurs. The space distorts, and the ground shakes.

People scream and stumble.

"Ahhhh!"

Despair covers the child's face.

People start to die.

All because of themselves.

Taesan takes a step back.

The energy bursts out and collides with the divine.

The distorted space quickly regains its balance.

The power from beyond the space collides with Taesan's energy, and they confront each other.

"......What?"

The child's pupils widen in shock. Until now, the child had not noticed the power from beyond the space. The child didn't even have time to notice before the power was quickly suppressed.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But this time it was different. The power from beyond the space collided with Taesan's power, and they clashed with each other. As a result, even a child who didn't know anything could sense the enormous power of the collision.

Taesan sneered at the power from beyond the space.

"No matter how hard you try from that distance, it won't work on me."

The power from beyond the space resisted, but it was slowly crushed by Taesan's power.

"Just wait a little. I'll be right there."

Kwajik.

The space closed.

People groaned and got up.

"What, what's going on?"

"What happened?"

No one was dead. The ground had shaken a bit, but it wasn't enough to collapse the foundation. The worst damage was that a vendor's stall had collapsed.

The child was staring at Taesan with trembling eyes.

"......Taesan-nim?"

"Let's get out of here for now."

* * *

Taesan took the child and went outside the village.

The child stumbled and barely managed to sit down in the bushes.

The child bit their trembling fingernails.

"......What is it? That thing?"

This time, it was clearly unusual.

The curse had been triggered in just one day, which was unprecedented.

"There......"

The power from beyond the space that had appeared last.

No matter how you looked at it, it was strange to call it a curse.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The child was extremely confused.

"You weren't cursed. Just because you have blue blood, it doesn't mean the same thing will happen to you now."

"What?"

The god of choice said, "I respect all choices. Even if it's a choice that leads to death."

However, the god hated it when there was no choice, and one was forced down a path by others.

Taesan slowly opened his mouth to explain to the child.

* * *

A few days later.

The child looked at the golden temple with a dead expression.

Their face was filled with all sorts of negative emotions.

"Everything is your choice," Taesan said. The child seemed to have made up their mind and walked towards the temple. The knights guarding the temple entrance drew their swords when they saw Taesan and the child.

"Halt! This is the temple where the Emperor resides! Who are you?"

"I... I'm the cursed child," the child said, taking off their robe. The guards were shocked when they saw the child's true identity.

The child suppressed their emotions and said, "I've come here to end my own life, now that all the trials given to me by the Emperor are over."
