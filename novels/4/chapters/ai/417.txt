**Episode 418**

418. 82nd Floor, Remigton (7)

The remnants of Belial that had spread throughout the realm disappeared.

The holy beings that had protected the realm, as well as the small, scattered minions that had blocked the intruders, were all annihilated.

The evidence that this was Belial's realm began to vanish one by one. The throne slowly corroded.

And this place began to transform into Taesan's realm.

"Phew."

Taesan took a deep breath. Baal looked surprised, but also seemed to understand, muttering to himself.

[Is this really you?]

As he spoke, Baal took a step forward.

The world was turned upside down. In the blink of an eye, Taesan was transported to a space filled with thick darkness.

"This is..."

[My realm. I didn't intend to bring you here, but it doesn't matter now that you're like this.]

In Baal's realm, only darkness was visible. However, it was possible to distinguish between objects. It was as if the darkness was playing the role of light.

Baal applauded.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Congratulations. You're a mixed existence. You've become the first human to grasp the devil's domain, which has existed since the beginning.]

The devil's domain.

Taesan raised his hand. He felt a sensation that he had never experienced before, spreading throughout his body.

He had now grasped the devil's domain.

"But I don't feel like I've become a devil."

He felt the power and sensation of being a devil, but he was still human.

[That's amazing.]

Baal spoke with a smile.

[If you had taken Belial's power and qualifications, your fundamental nature would have changed to that of a devil. You would have become one of our kind. But you only stole Belial's domain. As a result, your fundamental nature remains unchanged.]

Taesan was still human.

[You've obtained the devil's domain while remaining human. That's why you've acquired the skill called "Remegaton's Throne", which is not devil-like.]

He hadn't become a devil, but had only stolen the devil's domain. The skill "Remegaton's Throne" held that meaning.

[It's truly amazing. And interesting. Who would have thought that something would happen in this world that would defy my predictions.]

Baal opened his mouth with a smile.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You've now taken hold of the devil's domain. It means you've taken one of the 72 devil's names. Do you know what that means?]

The devils with domains are only 72 in number.

Taesan has taken one of them.

The devil, Belial's name was overlaid with Gang Taesan's.

Baal laughed as if it was ridiculous.

[The devil that had existed from the beginning was destroyed, and the owner of that domain has changed right here. It's really, really astonishing.]

"It doesn't seem that way, though."

[He's astonished, but the current situation is more enjoyable than that.]

Baal looked at Taesan with joy.

[Perhaps power and prestige. He didn't know that giving up everything and getting just one seat would be possible.]

"Power isn't important, anyway."

The high priest who had killed Lee Tae-yeon and made him surrender, as well as the guide leaders who had blocked his way, were all now under him.

Power and prestige can be achieved by conquering the labyrinth, but the qualifications are different.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Devil's Realm. This opportunity will never come again. From the moment I saw the throne, my goal was not power, but the seat itself. Because I could control the seed of life to some extent, I was able to steal the Devil's Realm.

[Is something different now? It's the first time someone has obtained the Devil's Realm, and I'm curious too.]

"It feels like magic is getting closer."

As if it were his own limb, he could perfectly control magic. Baal said it as if it were obvious.

[The devil is the master of magic. It's only natural to perfectly control magic.]

"And... I feel something inside me."

Although it was still empty, it was an enormous, vast something.

"This must be the realm of the devil."

[I know it well.]

Baal stroked his chin. With an interested expression, he looked at Taesan and opened his mouth.

[The reward for this trial was Belial's realm and its seat. There was no greater reward than that, but... you have caught my attention. I'm curious about your ending. Let's provide a service.]

The darkness spreading from Baal's realm took root in Taesan's body.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Be delighted. You are the first to obtain my dark magic.] [You have obtained the intermediate dark magic [Baal's Dark Space Invasion].] [You have obtained the intermediate dark magic [Baal's Overlapping Darkness].] [Your magic has permanently increased by 3,000.] [Your proficiency in dark magic has increased by 5%.]"

"......Is it okay to give me this much?"

My magic has increased by 3,000. It's a higher amount than the magic I currently possess. Baal said nonchalantly.

"[As the great demon lord, I should at least do this much. From now on, we'll need a tremendous amount of magic. This much doesn't hold much significance.]"

Baal waved his hand as if he was finished, and the darkness parted to reveal a passageway.

"[Go that way, Lucifer. The young child is waiting for you.]"

Taesan looked at the passageway.

But he didn't take a step forward.

He opened his mouth and asked Baal.

"There are a few things I'm curious about. Can you answer me?"

"[Hmm... I've shown you pleasant things, and now we're not in a bad relationship. Ask away. I'll answer you fairly.]"

"What kind of existence are you?"

Demons are similar to fallen angels.

And fallen angels are beings that have been banished from this world.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Now that I have the devil's domain in my hands, I can feel its power more vividly. And that power is, too extraordinary.

It's not something that belongs to this world.

[……It doesn't matter.]

Ba'al muttered, lost in thought for a moment.

[It seems like you're guessing too. If it's you now, you can answer. We are beings that existed before the creation of the world.]

Just like that, we are beings that existed before this world was born.

That's the devil and the gods.

[It's natural for us to distort the laws of this world. We existed before the laws existed, so the laws that were created later have no meaning to us.]

There was no great shock. It was because I had already made a rough estimate in the library of the universe.

So, instead of resolving the question, it only grew more complicated.

"What meaning do you have, then?"

Beings that existed before the creation of the world are still alive, polluting the world.

What meaning do they have?

"Do you exist to destroy the world? Or is it meaningless?"

Ba'al said ambiguously.

[Meaning. If I were to find it... I couldn't easily answer either. Because it's our original sin.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Original Sin?"

[Think of them as things that deny the flow of time. I am the lord of demons, but I didn't prevent Belial's destruction.]

On the contrary, I used Taesan to block the plans of other demons who wanted to revive Belial. It meant that I didn't want Belial to come back to life.

[Originally, we were more numerous than this. We were literally covering the entire world. But due to various incidents, we were reduced to this number.]

Baal shook his head.

[That's it. From now on, you'll have to find out the rest on your own.]

"......I understand."

Original Sin. And things that deny the flow of time.

It was new information, but it wasn't enough to understand. Taesan organized his thoughts.

[Is that the end of the questions?]

"There's still one more thing. You said I was a mixed-up existence."

[It's literal. Do you think it's possible for a being in this world to wield the power of God and grasp the realm of demons?]

Baal spoke as if it was nothing new, with a tone that implied it had always been that way.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Beliar's throne has never disappeared since we were born. From the beginning, we were beings that existed before the creation of the world. It's almost impossible for beings that exist after the creation of the world to interfere with the qualifications of those who came before. But you easily intervened and forcibly took over the name."

"When did this start?"

He knew that himself. Taesan himself was not an ordinary being.

But if it was mixed up, when did it happen?

Ba'al smiled quietly.

"The magician of the labyrinth is searching hard, but it won't be easy to find the answer. So... I'll give you a hint. Search your memories carefully and recall your journey."

As soon as he finished speaking, Taesan's body was forcibly pushed through a portal.

The world turned upside down, and Taesan arrived at a vast, empty plain.

"My journey?"

Taesan shook his head. It was a question that couldn't be answered for now, just like Ba'al said.

Taesan looked up.

There was nothing to be seen in this vast, empty plain of a world.

This place, which was Beliar's world, had become Taesan's domain, belonging to no one else.

* * *

Taesan walked through his domain. He had obtained his own domain several times before. It was when he partially changed the world or became the master of the world by receiving faith.

But this feeling was different from anything else.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a feeling of having obtained something entirely one's own, unaffected by anything, and eternally indestructible.

Taesan gathered his will.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

Then, the empty world responded to Taesan and began to move.

The vast plain trembled, and cliffs and mountains emerged.

It was a feat that shook the very nature of things, but it didn't consume any power.

[This is your domain. This world is literally yours. You can do whatever you want, it's your freedom.]

A quiet voice whispered. Mashin, Lucifer, stepped into his domain.

"Hello."

[Is this the devil's domain...? I thought it was possible.]

Mashin seemed to be pondering something, with his arms crossed.

[Well, this picture isn't bad either.]

After coming to a conclusion, Mashin extended his hand to Taesan.

"Let's make a contract. Taesan. Not as a human, but as the ruler of the devil's domain."

Darkness flowed out and enveloped Taesan.

"What's the content of the contract?"

[The devil is a being beyond the law. But they wield the power of black magic. That's possible because of our contract.]

Mashin continued to speak."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With the contract with me, you can create your own dark magic. And by accessing the fundamental part of magic, you can strengthen this world. In return, the dark magic you create will be provided to the dark magic users or the demon tribe."

"That's fine with me."

Taesan agreed, and the darkness gently seeped into him.

[You have acquired the contract skill [Demon and Devil].] [You have acquired [Dark Magic Creation].] [You have acquired the special passive skill [Dark Knight].] [You have acquired the special passive skill [Master of Dark Magic].] [Excellent choice.]

The demon laughed, and a connection was felt between Taesan and her.

Satisfied, she said:

"For now, you've only obtained a position. You don't have the corresponding power and authority. You'll have to fill that gap slowly. Demons originally don't grow in power and remain unchanged, but since you've only acquired a domain, it'll be different for you."

Taesan's essence was still human. He had acquired the ability of a demon's domain.

"From here on, I can't help you."

This was Taesan's world alone.

He had to create it with his own power, not relying on others.

"I'll cheer you on. Go ahead and create what you want."

With those words, the demon disappeared.

"Is this my domain?"

"What should I do?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I've gotten too much at once."

He checked first. Taesan opened his skill window.

[Remegaton's Throne] [You have acquired Remegaton's throne, gaining control over the demon's realm. You can now grant Remegaton to your subordinates.]

As he took over Belial's realm, he acquired the skill of Remegaton's throne. As a high-level skill, it seemed he could grant Remegaton to his subordinates as well.

[Contract Skill: Demon and Devil] [A contract between a demon and a devil. The demon borrows the devil's power to bestow upon their children, and the devil borrows the demon's power to directly influence this world.]

Previously, the demon had told Taesan that black magic was about borrowing the devil's power. It seemed that this skill made it possible.

[Black Magic Creation] [Proficiency: 1%] [You can create black magic that can be controlled through a contract with a demon, using some of the power in your world.]

Creating black magic.

Until now, Taesan had used various demons' black magic.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"His power was extremely great, providing immense strength to break through the labyrinth of Taesan.

Now, Taesan himself can create such powerful black magic."
