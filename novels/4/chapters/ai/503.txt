Chapter 504

504. 93rd Floor, Demons (3)

[We are noble.]

Amon declared. He spoke of unchanging truth, as if he was talking about a value that wouldn't waver no matter what.

[We are the only ones who are eternally immortal in this world. We are the only ones who exist alone, unwavering, and unshakeable. Even those who call themselves transcenders are nothing but fleeting existences compared to us.]

Amon's eyes fluttered with a certain emotion.

It was pride and arrogance.

[Moreover, we have existed far longer than you. You should naturally show us respect...….]

"Shut up."

Taesan cut off Amon's words. He didn't want to listen. He didn't want to fill his ears with useless, meaningless information that was like trash.

Taesan could understand the demons' psychology.

They, who had existed since before the creation of this world, were undoubtedly the only ones who were unchanging in this world.

Even now, when Goshin was exiled, it was clear that they were special.

And they were drunk on that fact.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$They claim to be great and noble just by looking at one of them.

That was quite a funny statement. It meant that their value was nothing more than being born like that.

They were a species that existed before the creation of the universe. They should have had wisdom, virtue, and enlightenment that matched their long history.

However, their value system and mindset were far from impressive.

They were no different from ordinary humans. Tae San opened his mouth.

"You must have been strong since I was born?"

[Of course. It's the difference between you weak beings in the universe who have to stack up strength. We were perfect from birth.]

Amon spoke proudly. Tae San shook his head.

'Is that why.'

A being without qualifications had gained power. It seemed that was the reason they had childish minds.

'Even the gods are like that. It's disappointing then.'

Tae San glanced at Baal.

Baal was still watching their confrontation without any intention of intervening.

'...what are you expecting.'
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But if you're not going to get involved, then I'll do as I please."

When Taesan didn't react, Amon urged him on with a twisted face.

"What are you doing? You're being..."]

"Shut up."

"What?"

"You're being too loud, so be quiet."

Taesan said in a calm tone.

Amon's face trembled.

"You..."]

"Isn't it because of that that you're pressuring me? Don't make up ridiculous excuses and just get to the point. I have my own reasons for not liking you, don't I?"

The demons' energy began to stir, and their scorn and disdain slowly turned into hostility.

Amon's face contorted.

"[...How dare you. You've tainted our purity. You dare to speak to us like that?]

"In the end, it's because of that, isn't it?"

Taesan had taken over Belial's domain and made it his own.

To those who took great pride in being demons and in their immortality, it was as if their sacred realm had been desecrated.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[I was going to overlook it according to your attitude, but it seems that's not possible. Lower your head. Sincerely speak our names one by one and apologize.]

“Do you dislike it?”

[Then we can't just stand still either. We have no choice but to punish the vile ones.]

The demons began to move slowly. Their energy was gradually approaching the mountain.

The air was tense with hostility and killing intent.

"I can't understand."

The mountain muttered quietly. His power was slowly seeping out of his body.

Even with just that power, he was able to crush and shatter the approaching demons' energy.

The mountain was clearly stronger than the demons. In fact, he was overwhelmingly so. The demons knew that too.

But the demons didn't back down. Instead, they approached with scorn and ridicule.

[You are clearly stronger than us. But we won't be defeated. We are unchanging. You can't kill us.]

It wasn't a false statement. The gods and demons were beings that couldn't be killed in this world. That's why even the transcendent beings had given up on expelling the gods.

But the mountain was different.

He could kill them anytime he wanted."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Those connected to Remegaton couldn't have been unaware of the fact. But not knowing was one thing.

It meant that Baal or the gods had blocked that fact.

Taesan gazed at Baal again. Baal, as before, was watching them with an unreadable smile.

[It seems like things are getting intense.]

Baal opened his mouth. The demons trembled with fear. Amon was the same.

But soon, he changed his expression and spoke confidently to Baal.

[This is a matter between us demons. Originally, we couldn't directly intervene in the affairs of mortals, but now he's taken the position of a demon. Even if it's you, you can't interfere in our business. That was the contract, wasn't it?] [Yes. I also can't interfere in your internal affairs. I can't directly harm you either. It's a very inconvenient contract.]

Baal smiled.

[So I'll make a proposal to you.] [A proposal, you say...?] [In any case, if we fight like this, it'll take a considerable amount of time. You won't die, and yet, Taesan is far stronger than you.]

Note: Remegaton is likely a proper noun, possibly a name of a person or a place, and I've left it untranslated.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Taesan was convinced by Baal's words. Baal knew that he could kill the demons, but he deliberately hid that fact from them.

[So, how about setting one condition and having a duel?] [A duel is...].

Amon said with a trembling voice. He himself knew that he couldn't defeat Taesan alone.

But Baal's next words were too enticing to him.

[The duel opponent is... well, it's just Taesan and all of you. Thirty-eight, I think. You've all managed to survive miserably.]

"Is it one against many?"

[Yes. It doesn't matter. The condition is to declare defeat. You all have to declare your own defeat. What do you say? The reward is that the loser must obey the winner's command unconditionally.]

Amon and the other demons quickly thought it over.

And they gave their answer. Amon replied with a twisted smile.

[Alright. We accept.]

Taesan is undoubtedly strong.

But they are not weak either. If they all use their full strength to pressure Taesan, they can definitely win. Amon had no doubts about it.

Above all, the condition for winning the duel is to make the opponent declare defeat."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a truly ridiculous thing to say. They were unchanging. They didn't die, and their power didn't dwindle, so there was no reason to declare defeat. In reality, it was just a matter of time before they won.

"'It seems Baal doesn't like that human either.'

Amon planned to use them to grasp the ki of Taesan. Amon believed it without a doubt.

'[What are you going to do, human? Are you going to back down now that you've come this far?]'

Amon sneered at Taesan.

But Taesan wasn't looking at Amon.

Taesan's gaze was fixed on Baal.

Baal was quietly smiling. Taesan, who had been looking at his face for a moment, nodded his head.

'Alright. Let's accept it.'

Baal laughed joyfully and raised his hand.

'[Good.]'

Kuuuuuuung!

The building crumbled. In an instant, it was erased, and they found themselves in a vast plain.

'[I'll give you a little preparation time. After that, we'll start right away, so get ready.]'

* * *

'[Make me regret it. You dare to steal our things, you worthless thief.]'
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Amon left with a smirk.

Over thirty demons gathered in one place, chatting with each other.

Taesan quietly observed their appearance.

[You saw the demons.]

By Taesan's side, Baal spoke calmly.

[How do you feel?]

"It's disappointing," Taesan replied immediately.

The demons fell short of Taesan's expectations. Their thoughts and spirit were like those of a child.

[Demons and gods are unchanging. But demons are far inferior to gods. They are unchanging, and their physical strength and power are, of course, inferior, and even their spirit is.]

Baal's voice was filled with contempt and disdain.

[They are foolish and ignorant like children, yet they possess the power to destroy the world. Countless people have died for their simple pleasures.]

"You dislike them, don't you?"

Baal said, addressing the great evil. He was the lord of the demons.

However, Baal's voice and gaze revealed a hatred towards the demons that surpassed anything else.

"What do you desire?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Baal knew that if the two of them were to meet, the demons would retaliate. Yet, he proceeded, which meant he was aiming for a collision between the Taesan and the demons.

[Do you remember when I first met you and asked you about us? Do you remember my answer back then?]

"Yes."

Taesan asked Baal, "What does your existence mean?"

Baal replied, "It is our original sin."

"We are beings that deny the flow of time. That's why we didn't stop Belial's destruction."

[It was fine until now. Due to the contract, we couldn't interfere with the world too much, so we just left it alone. But... it's no longer possible to leave it alone.]

"Is there a reason?"

[The things we've been holding back are starting to move.]

"......"

The thing we've been holding back was one.

Goshin.

[I don't know why it's already moving, but... we need to clean up the defective products before that.]

Baal said quietly.

The power of the demons on the other side is slowly fading away. With a confident face, Baal looks at Taesan, who has finished all preparations.

[Whatever. It's ultimately your choice. Do as you please.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Baal claps his hands. The sound of applause echoes throughout the entire realm.

["I, Baal, declare my name. You will start a duel. The duel will not end until one of you admits defeat, and the loser must obey the winner's command, no matter what. Will you accept?"]

The demons shout in unison, "So be it!"

Taesan also nods his head.

["Good."]

Their declaration becomes a contract through Baal's power. Baal smiles as if he had been waiting for this.

["Then let's start. Kill each other."]["Haha!"]

Kuuuuung!

The first to make a move was Amon.

He approaches Taesan with a distorted smile.

["Pitiful human! I'll show you my true power!"]

Zzzt!

The space splits open, and a massive, dark-colored pillar appears from the black gap.

Its size is enormous, like a mountain range.

"Amon's Dark Pillar."

Taesan also had a dark magic like this.

However, the power of this pillar was clearly different from when Taesan wielded it. This pillar contained a power that could destroy a continent.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[This is the power of our demon! Pitiful mortal!]

Amon shouted confidently.

Even though he had used a tremendous amount of power, Amon's strength was not depleted at all.

The demon's power is unchanging and eternal. No matter how much it's used, it doesn't decrease. Amon created another anchor and threw it at Taesan. And he himself charged forward, creating another anchor.

Kugugugung!

He tore through space and charged forward. Other demons predicted Taesan's actions and prepared to attack, thinking he would dodge the anchor and pressuring him from all sides.

But Taesan didn't dodge the anchor.

He slowly reached out his hand only when it was close. His fingertips turned ash-gray.

The size of it was comparable to a small pickaxe.

The ash-gray color touched the anchor.

Kwaaaang!

And the anchor crumbled.

Like a cliff crumbling from an earthquake, the anchor completely shattered and fell apart. The fragments brushed past Taesan's side. The demons who were about to move froze in place for a moment.

Taesan stood still, without a single wound or movement.

[...Silence.]

Amon realized that something was off."

Note: "anchor" is a literal translation of the Korean word "쐐기", but it's likely being used as a metaphor for a powerful attack or technique in this context.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But he had already reached the vicinity of Taesan's body. Taesan's body moved suddenly. At the moment he felt he had disappeared, the ash-colored thing had pierced his chest.

"Let go."

Taesan said calmly. Something was happening inside him, and it was swallowing Amun."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
