27. 3rd Floor (1)

Taesan inspects the staff.

[Random Mind Staff] [A magical staff created by chance. Even the creator doesn't know why such magic is imbued in it. It can use the basic magic [Random Mind Attack].] [Basic Magic: Random Mind Attack] [Mana Cost: 5] [Uses random unfavorable mental magic on the target. Attempts a status effect judgment on the target.]

Literally a staff. Confusion, curses, madness, and so forth. It casts unfavorable mental magic on the target. It's random, but within the framework of an unfavorable effect. Thus, it wasn't a major disadvantage.

And the clear reward from the 2nd floor. Basic Mana Increase Potion.

[Beginner Mana Increase Potion] [A liquid containing the power of mana. Drinking it will increase your mana.]

Taesan drank it without hesitation.

[Mana permanently increases by 10.]
It was a satisfactory increase. Now Taesan's mana was at 41. With simple calculations, he could use his skill "Spill" nearly 8 times.

"Good."

And now for the remaining reward ???

"What's this?"

As a secret element clear reward, it was expected to be better than the clear reward. Taesan checked the reward with anticipation.

[You have used ???] [Obtained a tool of a lowly thief.]

A tool resembling a pickpocket's tool appeared in Taesan's hand. Taesan, who had thought it would be a reward related to stats, was momentarily surprised.

"What's this?"

[Tool of the lowly thief] [A skill unique to the lowly. If you lose it, your comrades will abandon you.] [Attempts trap disarmament and lock opening.]

"Oh?"

Taesan was surprised. It was an equipment for disarming traps and unlocking locks.

"I got this like this."

Among the traps, there are traps that must be hit.

If there is no tool for unlocking a kind of confirmed trap, tears must be swallowed and the reward must be given up. From the 5th floor, there are boxes with traps and lock handling appearing little by little. With this tool, attempts at unlocking were possible.
Here's the translation of the text:

"It's a very good item. Moreover, by using this tool, you can acquire skills in trap detection and lock unlocking.

It didn't have practical performance, but it was useful for breaking through the labyrinth. The ghost muttered.

[I got everything I could.]

"Why are you so dissatisfied?"

[Do you think the dead would be happy seeing the living gain achievements?]

"Well, that's true."

Taesan agreed with reasonable words.

Similarly, the ghost was someone who failed to conquer the labyrinth. Watching him gradually break through the labyrinth brought many thoughts to mind.

Once confirmed, it was over.

Taesan headed towards the passage leading down. As he descended below the passage, a quest window appeared.

[3rd Floor Quest Start.] [Defeat the boss on the 3rd floor and proceed.] [Reward: Beginner's Health Increase Potion.] [Secret Reward: ???]

Beginner's Health Increase Potion. It increases health by 50.

Like the Mana Increase Potion, it was an exceptionally good item. Taesan finished confirming and opened the door. A dwarf was waiting for him.

"Oh. You came?"

"I came."

The dwarf's welcoming face momentarily twisted.

"...What's wrong?"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"[Are you an old nag? You're still alive and kicking?]"

The ghost chuckled. The dwarf clicked his tongue.

"I got a quest."

[Since you got it, you came. No eyes?]

Ignoring the ghost's words, the dwarf spoke to Taesan.

"That's just a loud loser. Don't bother with him for no reason."

[An old man who can only pray, boasting.]

They exchanged sharp reactions. If the dwarf's response to the ghost was indifference and disdain, the ghost's contained hostility, reproach, and mockery.

[But can you tell me not to bother the old man? Seems like he's quite valuable?]

The ghost said jokingly.

[Wanna poke him once? I want to see the old man go crazy.]

"You? Against him?"

The dwarf chuckled. Taesan waved his hand.

"Instead of you two arguing, why don't you pay attention to the main business?"

"Ah, sorry. The loser keeps making a fuss."

The dwarf promptly apologized. Indeed, the dwarf was very kind to him.

"You won't bother with such a guy. What are you going to buy?"

"I don't have anything yet."
Here is the English translation of the text:

"I haven't gathered enough money. While wandering around the third floor, he planned to come back.

"Then let's see next time. Might as well shake off that guy."

[Hmph.]

The ghost chuckled. As they exited the shop and entered the third floor, Taesan spoke.

"Why aren't you two getting along?"

[Can we get along? That old man is so sinister and stupid.]

The voice was full of resentment.

"You'd better be careful too. The old man might seem helpful at times, but he can turn on you anytime. He's someone you can't trust."

"Is that from when you were alive?"

"Would it be different if I were dead?"

If I were alive, I would break through the labyrinth. It was like Taesan's situation right now.

You can't trust him. The ghost sneered at the shop owner. Taesan entered the labyrinth.

"Kyaak!"

"Kik!"

Just like on the second floor, four goblins were waiting. Although the types of monsters appearing on the second and third floors overlapped, there was a difference.

Here, there were goblins using magic instead of bows.

"Kyaak!"
Here is the English translation of the text:

"[The goblin with a staff activated confusion.] [No need to roll! You resisted with indomitable mental strength.] [All stats increased.]"

Taesan drew his sword with a heavy sigh.

Three minutes later, only Taesan and the ghost remained in the room.

"The third floor seems easier than the second."

"I'd argue, but you're right, so I've got nothing to say."

The ghost grumbled.

"Normally, this place is pretty tough, you know? I've nearly died here several times, but now we're getting through like this."

The ghost's words were not wrong. There were goblins using enchantment magic, along with three guarding goblins.

Avoiding their group of three was difficult, and handling them one by one would risk falling under the confusion check. It was a kind of bottleneck.

However, Taesan was partially immune to mental states. It was almost easier than the second floor because it was like there was one less goblin.

Taesan began to leisurely break through the labyrinth. Moving to another room, he dealt with the goblins. This time it took two minutes.

"Oh, my."

The ghost, who had been quietly watching, exclaimed in admiration.
Here is the English translation of the text:

[As I watched quietly, your movements seem fine. The techniques you've learned in practical combat have clear limitations, but you cover them with your sense and observational skills. ... If it's you, you could probably make it to the middle floors without any problems.]

He didn't intend to settle for satisfaction on the middle floors alone.

He aimed to clear the labyrinth.

Taesan continued to roam the labyrinth, defeating goblins along the way. The ghost asked, puzzled.

[Why are you defeating all of them? With your current level, you won't get much experience. Wouldn't it be better to descend quickly?]

The ghost's words were not wrong.

While they didn't give minimal experience points, with Taesan's current stats, even the 4th and 5th floors posed no problem.

The increase in spiritual energy was also sealed due to the difference in caliber, leaving only money and equipment to be collected.

Taesan replied calmly.

"Because there's a quest."

[A quest? Do you have more to gain right now?]

"Rakiratas."

[Huh?]

The ghost paused.

[That guy gives out quests like that? I've never heard of such a thing?]

"Have you faced the trial yourself?"

[I have. I cleared it without any problems.]

The ghost proudly replied. Then he became curious about something. As Taesan killed goblins, he asked.

"What kind of creature is Rakiratas?"
Here's the English translation of the text:

[It's literally just paper. A humble person devotes themselves to Rakiratas and becomes stronger. The price for that is eternal binding, yet there are those who still think it's a good thing.]

The ghost seemed unable to comprehend.

[Still, you're strong. If it's not a fake but the real deal, you'd have to overcome at least the fifth floor to face such an opponent. Do you think sacrificing a wretched life is worth it?]

Listening to the ghost's story, it didn't seem like the trial suddenly intensified. Still, Taesan seemed knowledgeable about Rakiratas up to the deep levels.

Taesan asked.

"Do you know about the Apostle's Contract?"

[Huh?]

The ghost asked in surprise.

[How do you know about that?]

"Because Rakiratas proposed it to me."

[...He proposed it to you?]

The ghost seemed quite flustered and fell silent. There was a moment of hesitation, but soon he spoke.

[With you as you are now, you'd certainly receive the proposal. Ugh. I didn't get it.]

The ghost muttered discontentedly.

[Where should I start explaining?]

"You explain willingly."

The dwarf hesitated mentioning the contract. He had expected some reluctance, but this was unexpected.
Here's the translation of the text:

"I'm already a dead man! Bound by laws but unrestricted when it comes to information. And what the old man doesn't tell you is partly for your sake too. It's a disgustingly clumsy consideration, but there you go."

The ghost chuckled.

"Why should I care about you? We'll part ways on the tenth floor anyway."

The ghost didn't mean it for him. But oddly enough, that was good. To be honest, the dwarf's consideration wasn't necessary.

He needed information. About this place, about the NPCs' purposes, about who the gods were.

The ghost began to satisfy his curiosity.

"Each god has their own domain. There are those in charge of victory and those of defeat, a wide variety. Among them, Rakiratas is the god responsible for strife and death. And he's also one of the strangest gods."

"Weird?"

"He acts very lightly for a god. He breaks contracts as he pleases, and he tries to help those he likes by reducing their burdens. Should I call it childlike? He's a god who is difficult to express in words."

As he listened to the explanation, he became curious.

"What exactly is a god?"
Here's the translation of the text:

"At least, he wasn't a god known on Earth. According to the ghost, there seemed to be at least dozens of them."

["Those who aided in the design of the labyrinth."]

"Design?"

["Do you remember the system window you saw when you entered here?"]

Taesan groped for memories.

"...A labyrinth created by a magician."

["It's said that this place is a labyrinth created long ago by a great magician, granting one wish to those who conquer it."]

A labyrinth created by a great magician. That's what this place was.

["But it's difficult to create it alone. He sought out transcendent beings and shared his plan. He wanted to create a grand labyrinth, a tower descending underground. He wanted to summon countless warriors and heroes to break through. He wanted to witness their challenges, struggles for their lives, and inevitable deaths."]

"You'd think people would like that."

["Like it? They were ecstatic. They wholeheartedly supported the magician. After a significant time passed even for gods, the place was designed right here. The labyrinth."]

It was a bigger story than he had anticipated. The ghost continued speaking.
"And the gods took their place in this place that they had labored to create. They judge those who enter the labyrinth from the depths, from the deeps. They assess their worth through trials, passing judgment with their gaze. Among them, they make offers especially to those who please them. That is the Apostle's Contract."
