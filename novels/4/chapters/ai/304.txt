305. Fifth Return, Earth (1)

Taesan looked at the bracelet.

A bracelet of blood-red color like blood. It must be because the blood of the Giant King was used as the material. He could feel the power embedded within it.

Strong.

It didn't have the consciousness like a ring, but it had a steadfast power that seemed to move according to the owner's will at any time.

[Bracelet of Despair, Encompassing Part of the World] [Strength + 500] [Agility + 500] [Intelligence + 500] [Attack Power + 500] [Defense + 500] [Based on the flesh and blood of the Giant King, it has drawn out the power of many materials from the now extinct world to shape the bracelet. What lies within is a part of the world itself.] [Can activate special skill [Greed of Annihilation].]

The corners of Taesan's mouth lifted.

First, the stats and attack power were satisfactory. Naturally lower than a ring, but still satisfying figures.

And there's the special activation skill. That must be the core of this bracelet. Taesan opened the skill window to confirm.
[Tactical Skill Activation: Greed of Annihilation] [Mana Cost: 400] [By synchronizing with the power contained within the bracelet, the user can devour and nullify attacks infused with the opponent's will. However, attacks surpassing the user's will or the bracelet's power cannot be nullified.]

Tae-san interpreted the explanation and looked at Hafran.

"A defensive skill?"

What Tae-san desired was equipment capable of handling offensive attacks using willpower.

Hafran raised his hand into Tae-san's gaze.

"It seems you want an explanation."

"Go ahead."

"At first, I tried to create offensive equipment as you requested. I envisioned a format that controls space by manipulating the blood of the Giant King."

Tae-san's expectations were somewhat similar. The blood of the Giant King itself possessed tremendous power. If enhanced and controlled, it would wield considerable force.

"But as I used the materials one by one, cursed bracelet started rejecting my touch. Blood kept splattering out, attempting to pierce my limbs."

Hafran raised his arm. The sturdy forearm was marked with tight scars that seemed to bind small threads.

"With my skills alone, I couldn't produce offensive equipment."

Hafran spoke with dissatisfaction in his voice.
When I think about it, it doesn't seem that strange. Harfran cannot control willpower. It was natural that there would be constraints in making equipment that he could control with willpower.

"So I completely changed the approach. Instead of offense, I gave it the power of defense. After that, he no longer tried to attack me."

"So that's how it turned out."

"Yeah. I'm sorry about that."

"It doesn't really matter."

Whether Taisan asked for attack equipment to subdue opponents faster or not, Harfran didn't pay much attention to either side.

The important thing was the performance of the equipment.

["You are the Wind Spirit King. I have summoned Minerva."]

"Oh, Master! It's been a while!"

"How are things on your end?"

"I'm finding some stability. My cute children are working hard."

Minerva smiled softly. The world of spirits and humans. Arulia. With the birth of a new Spirit King, the void and confusion that arose were gradually being sorted out.

Taisan spoke to Minerva.

"Try attacking me."

"...Why all of a sudden?"

"I have an experiment to try."

Looking puzzled, Minerva glanced at Taisan as he shook his bracelet. Soon understanding the situation, Minerva nodded.
"Ah, that. You suddenly asked me to attack, so I was surprised. To what extent?"

"With full power."

"Got it!"

*Kuwung!*

"Sleep!"

Halfren tried to stop in panic, but it was already too late. A gust of wind violently swept through his workshop, sending tools hanging on the walls flying with a crash.

Minerva chuckled softly.

"Take this!"

*Kuwung!*

The wind shoots towards Taesan.

Minerva's power is nearly equal to Taesan's. In other words, this attack was comparable to Taesan's full power.

Facing the incoming wind, Taesan focused his will.

"[You have triggered the greed of destruction.]"

*Warak, the crimson light of the bracelet shone.*

*Kiiing!*

He raises the crimson power and swallows the wind. The wind struggles and resists, but the crimson power stubbornly swallows it all.

The wind slowly subsides.

Minerva's eyes widened.

"...Has my power completely disappeared?"

Taesan knew he could block it. Even if he couldn't block it, knowing the existence of nullification of the attack, he thought there would be no damage.

But the power Taesan just showed was different from what she expected.
The mountain didn't just block her power; it literally swallowed it up. And it did so effortlessly, without any significant expenditure of strength.

"Is this how it is."

Taesan shook his bracelet. The crimson light of the bracelet had slightly diminished compared to before.

Even though it had blocked Minerva's power, there was hardly any headache. If he had tried to erase it purely with his willpower without the bracelet, it would have consumed considerable mental energy.

However, it seemed the bracelet had expended a significant amount of its power, as the sensation of power from it had greatly diminished.

It was slowly recovering, but not very quickly.

He could completely erase the opponent's attacks almost perfectly. But in doing so, it consumed the bracelet's power. Once all of it was used up, he wouldn't be able to activate the desperate swallowing until it recovered.

Taesan nodded.

"Good."

Blocking Minerva's power meant he could also sufficiently block attacks from the leadership. It was equipment that could erase attacks at critical moments and exploit vulnerabilities.

"This should be enough even without being offensive."

He had to discard the newly acquired bracelet recently, but it performed well enough that he didn't regret it.

"That went well. From now on, I hope we experiment after discussing in advance."
"Sorry."

Half-ran grumbled as he picked up the scattered tools and put them back in place. Minerva looked around curiously as if marveling at something.

"Master, what new power did you gain while I wasn't looking? I sense something strange."

"Ungling."

"......Ungling?"

Minerva paused. Taesan handed Half-ran a grinding stone.

"Can you use this too?"

The grinding stone of razor sharpness. It was a secret reward from the 60th floor, capable of significantly boosting attack power.

Taking the grinding stone, Half-ran's eyes gleamed.

"This is good. Do you have a weapon in mind?"

"Right here."

Taesan handed over Cabert's artifact.

It was a sword recovered from the entrance of the labyrinth where the ghost had once used it in life. Although it had many special effects, it was time to focus on increasing its pure attack power.

Taking Cabert's artifact, Half-ran looked at the ghost.

"His sword, huh."

[That's right?]

"Just wait a moment."
Harfran began sharpening the sword with a grindstone. Taesan spent the time confirming the precise effects and powers of the bracelet.

Thirty minutes later, Harfran handed over Calbert's artifact.

"All done."

"Already?"

"Just polishing, not crafting anew from materials, so no need for a long wait."

Harfran shrugged. Taesan checked the increased attack power.

[Calbert's Artifact: Ancestral sword imbued with blood of ancestors] [Artifact of a world now lost. Claimed many noble lives.] [Attack +300] [Attack +150 against all enemies]

"Oh?"

The attack power had risen more than expected. Harfran explained,

"Over time, the equipment itself has degraded in power, and the original blacksmith didn't properly preserve the materials. Still, it's a good sword. It performs much better now thanks to my work."

"Of course. It's a sword with history."

A ghost chuckled. Satisfied, Taesan sheathed the sword.

Taesan waved his hand.

"See you later."

"Next time, bring more of those materials. It's tough work, but it's rewarding."
Hafren waved goodbye with a smile.

"Now, all preparations are complete. Taesan quietly waited."

"You are a supreme spirit of diverse colors. Varcaza has been summoned."

Varcaza was summoned as well. Minerva asked, as if finally understanding.

"Are you returning to the master's world again?"

Taesan nodded. Minerva murmured with interest.

"Is it another confrontation with the gods...."

Crack.

Space split apart.

Taesan threw himself into it.

And what appeared was a huge hole torn in the sky.

As always, it was a desolate Earth.

A calm voice echoed from all directions. Among them was a familiar voice.

"Everyone gather! I'll take attendance!"

The fifth return had begun.

Taesan walked in the direction of the voice he heard.

* * *

"Representatives of each mode! Let me know the headcount!"

Kim Hwiyeon shouted enthusiastically. Taesan approached her.

"Oh, Taesan."

"Are the people okay?"

"Well, it's the fifth time, so... I think they're starting to get used to it."


People calmly followed Kim Hwi-yeon's words. There was no longer any sign of despair or sadness.

Kim Hwi-yeon spoke quietly.

"Since we don't know how this quest will unfold, we should prepare ahead of time."

Taesan nodded and said to Minerva and Barkazza,

"Clean up all the approaching monsters."

[As the master wishes.]

"Got it. Master."

Minerva and Barkazza soared into action. Soon, a loud noise erupted around them.

Taesan looked towards a rift in the sky.

From there, monsters descended to the ground.

Perhaps because they had acquired authority, Taesan could feel the power of the rift more clearly.

Taesan smirked.

'How absurd.'

That's how he knew. The power contained in that rift surpassed the power of mortality.

The rift itself was like a monster.

'It's still far.'

But in this life, he had come to understand the true nature of the rift, which he had never known before.

He was gradually getting closer to their power. Taesan went to find Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk.

After exchanging blows with the two, Kim Hwi-yeon, who had finished organizing, came to find them.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"Total forty thousand. Three thousand eight hundred hard mode players survived."

"How many were there after the last return?"

"Forty-six thousand. In hard mode, about four thousand were."

"The damage is minimal."

"Because everyone has established a foundation."

Kim Hwiyeon said proudly. After investing a lot of time, they were descending through the maze stably. Unless they overestimated their abilities or became complacent, there were hardly any deaths.

Taesan asked.

"How many floors are you on now?"

"We're at the mid-forties. We've almost reached the fiftieth floor."

"Is that so."

Mid-forties.

Taesan said to Kim Hwiyeon.

"Be careful."

"Huh?"

"In the Frozen Mode, the maze's difficulty changes around the seventy-first floor. There could be places like that in hard mode too."

"Ah..."

Don't get complacent just because you're descending steadily. Kim Hwiyeon nodded firmly at those words.

"Yes."

It wasn't just idle talk. According to Taesan's memory, even in hard mode, the difficulty changed around the seventy-first floor. A definite barrier had emerged between those who could advance beyond that point and those who couldn't.
Sure, here is the translation of the text:

---

However, there shouldn't be a problem for Kim Hwi-yeon or Korea's hardcore players. They've already overcome the attacks of the Goshin on Earth.

But other places besides Korea will struggle considerably. With Goshin's interference in other countries reduced, there could be countries even more challenging than in past lives.

The summary is complete.

And then, the system window appeared.

[Special Quest Start] [This quest is a joint national quest. Designated countries: Korea, North Korea, Japan, China.] [All players from designated countries must gather in one place. Overcome the hardships encountered while gathering and meet players from other countries.] [This quest has no time limit.] [The more influence you have on encounters between players, the more points you will earn when returning to the labyrinth.]
