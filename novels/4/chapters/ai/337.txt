Chapter 338

338. The World of the Vanquished Spirits (9)

They have won.

They have overcome their downfall.

A party was held in the empire to celebrate their victory.

"We have won!"

"For the sake of the heroes!"

"For the eternal glory of the great empire!"

People dressed in their finest attire rejoice, drinking and eating. Tai-san also blended in, quietly passing the time.

"Ah! Our hero has arrived."

Bardrey approaches Tai-san, his face flushed from drinking.

"Let us express our gratitude once again! Thanks to you, our world has been saved!"

Bardrey raises his cup. Others also shout and join in.

The excitement enveloped them all.

Tai-san waited for the commotion to die down before asking:

"What are your thoughts now?"

"Hmm... I don't know."

Bardrey furrowed his brow. Although they had clearly won, the situation was ambiguous, and they couldn't just be overly joyful.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The damage was not slight. Many kingdoms had perished, and many knights and soldiers had died. It was clear that it would take a significant amount of time to recover from the damage.

"But... we have overcome destruction."

Now, we no longer have to worry about the future.

Bardley poured himself a drink with a relaxed expression.

"Let's enjoy ourselves first. Time is abundant."

The door burst open. The emperor and empress appeared, and the people enjoying the party hastily bowed their heads.

"You've arrived."

"Yes, my son."

The emperor's face, looking at Bardley, was filled with pride.

"You've done well. There's no one else who can take my place but you."

"...Thank you."

A blush rose to Bardley's face.

He was the emperor's only son and heir. Moreover, he had handled all his competitors with his own hands, so the throne of the next emperor was essentially his.

And for the emperor to directly say that in front of everyone was equivalent to a public declaration.

The emperor chuckled and patted Bardley's shoulders.

"Enjoy yourself, son. We only have a bright future ahead of us."

The emperor left after saying that and joined the party."
Here is the translation of the text:

Badrey smiled with a satisfied face. "Good."

He genuinely looked happy.

"You have done many things for me. You've fulfilled prophecies and directly blocked the demon king. From the empire's perspective, no matter how much the inhabitants of this world repay us, it's not enough."

Badrey gazed at the Taesan.

"If you desired it, the empire would prepare a place for you."

"I'll think about it."

The Taesan responded quietly. The party continued.

"Your Majesty."

"Oh, Levanisia."

Levanisia approached Badrey, her face red with shame.

"I have something to confess to Your Majesty."

"Confess?"

Badrey looked at her with a puzzled expression.

Levanisia opened her mouth.

When Badrey heard what she said, his eyes widened greatly.

And a joy began to spread across his face.

Badrey started shouting loudly, embracing Levanisia and laughing with a face full of happiness.

And the world began to distort.

Everything began to fade away.

And the place where the Taesan arrived was a world overflowing with dark energy.
Here is the translation of the text:

The place was where one's spirit was crushed and forced to relive the past, a distorted location.

Tae-san lifted his gaze. There was a distorted, self-contradictory being there.

Tae-san instinctively recognized what kind of existence that was.

"The God of Regret. Leigrit."

The being exuded a faint, subtle aura, as if it was the correct answer.

Leigrit, who had a deep-seated emotion, asked, "Did you enjoy it?"

Tae-san didn't answer, but Leigrit's emotion was spreading everywhere.

He looked incredibly happy.

[Leigrit's interference zone had decreased.] [Leigrit has given you a reward. You have received [The Lord's Robe].] [You have cleared the strengthened trial. Additional rewards will follow.] [You have obtained [The Ring of Distorted Reflections of the Regretful].]

He received two rewards.

The trial was cleared.

However, Leigrit did not send Tae-san away.

Leigrit was looking at the ghost standing silently beside him, not Tae-san.

Leigrit asked, "How is it?"

The silent ghost opened its mouth.

"What do you want from me?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The spirit's voice was as hard as steel. With a heart full of emotions, it asked the god of regret:

"What answer do you want from me?"

Legrit burst out laughing. It seemed that the real matter was about to begin, and a great power was about to be revealed.

"Legrit's interference zone is decreasing." "Legrit proposes to the hero who is buried in the labyrinth." "Option 1: The hero returns to the labyrinth and completes the quest agreed upon with Kang Tae-san." "Option 2: The hero is embedded in the world of memories created by Legrit and is reborn. The contract with Kang Tae-san is cancelled, and the hero returns to their tomb in the labyrinth after death."

The spirit's body began to tremble as it slowly read the content.

"[It's really interesting. Really.]"

The spirit spoke in a dismal tone. Kang Tae-san was scrutinizing the content one by one.

The first option was to stay by Kang Tae-san's side and watch as they crushed the guide to the road of sin, just like now.

However, the second option was different.

The spirit could live again in its own world.

There, it could be with the people it loved, continue to protect the empire it wanted to protect, and watch its child grow and develop.
Here is the translation of the text:

They could experience and feel what kind of life they lived, what they did, and how they died.

Of course, it was just a fake.

The spirit world had already perished. What they saw was just a place created by Legrit according to his memories.

It was not real. It was just a created sculpture.

Yet, the spirit was unable to make a choice easily.

The spirit wanted to see its own world, which had not perished, even just once.

It wanted to live a life with itself, her, and their child.

Rejecting it as fake, the spirit would not be able to see its own world again. Its hope was to exact revenge on death, which would be achieved by crushing the guide of sinful paths.

The spirit, whose hope had ended, had a high probability of no longer being bound by the labyrinth like the spirit had done.

It was possible to renegotiate with the mage to change the conditions, but whether the mage would accept it was a problem, and whether it was possible to make a contract that would reverse time was unknown.

On top of that, the contract with Tai Shan was also severed.

The spirit had to wait without expectation for an adventurer who would come and fulfill its hope, returning to the entrance of the labyrinth's tomb.
Here is the translation of the text:

Rigel saw the silent ghost and was delighted.

Tai Shan understood Rigel's intention.

"Really, a perverted hobby."

Rigel didn't care what the ghost would choose.

If the ghost chose the first option, it would regret it. It would keep thinking about not being able to protect its own world, even though it was fake.

Even if the ghost chose the second option, it would be the same. It would be satisfied with living together, but it would also be miserable. The more happy it was, the more it would think about how fake it was and why it couldn't achieve it. And then the ghost would return to a narrow grave again.

Regardless of which option the ghost chose, Rigel's desired picture would be drawn.

[I am......]

The ghost's voice was filled with sorrow. The ghost looked at Tai Shan as if it had grabbed a straw.

Tai Shan opened his mouth.

"I respect your choice."

It was a short sentence. That was all Tai Shan could say to the ghost.

In the end, it was the ghost's own choice.

The trembling ghost's body began to calm down slowly.

The ghost opened its mouth.

* * *
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as the Taesan returned to the labyrinth, a system window appeared.

[I acquired the belt made by the master of this cruel space.]

[I acquired something else.]

"Is it natural to obtain a secret reward?"

I obtained a secret clearance reward despite not finding the secret room.

[From now on, the concept of a secret room will not exist. Whether or not to obtain a secret clearance reward will depend on how perfectly I fulfill the clearance conditions.]

The ghostly voice, which had fallen but was not shaking, spoke.

Taesan, who had obtained the reward, opened his mouth.

"Are you okay?"

[...... anyway.]

The fallen voice cried out.

[I had many thoughts. I wanted to see my child's face once. I wanted to hear my voice and laughter.]

My own child. My own blood. The fruit of love.

This made the ghostly spirit too sad.

[But it's all fake. It's not real.]

The ghostly spirit spoke as if vomiting.

[I chose a fake and deceived myself, and it's an insult to my world and myself.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Yongsa was strong and had talent. His spirit was unshakeable and he did not fall for any temptation. Even if the result made him suffer, he would say so.

He was too proud to accept something fake. Therefore, the ghost chose the first proposal.

[What's more, I also need your help. We're just at the beginning. I have some things to tell you.]

The ghost smiled cheerfully. The Taesan opened his mouth.

"Thank you."

[There's no need to be grateful. I chose it myself.]

In fact, Taesan's existence played a significant role in the ghost's choice.

He watched Taesan from the side as he entered the labyrinth and descended to the depths. Although the time was not long, many things happened during this process. As a result, the ghost developed some affection for Taesan.

'Maybe we will part ways at the end.'

If it was true, I wouldn't know, but I'd rather see how far Taesan could reach. I wanted to watch it.

First, it was settled like that.

[You've got a lot, don't you? Let's check it out.]

"It is so."
Here is the translation of the text:

At first, my ability sword and irack technology, as well as related skills, have significantly improved.

It's clear that the effect of the title obtained at 70th floor was significant. Irack technology, which didn't increase much before, increased by 3% after just one battle.

Although the content of the skills didn't change, it was still a pleasant change.

And I got a lot of skills while defeating the demon king.

[Skill: Summon of Annihilation] [Proficiency: 1%] [Consumption: ???] [Summon the annihilation.]

The explanation was very simple. I didn't know what it consumed.

"What's this?"

I couldn't guess whether it was a power of attack or summoning something.

But one thing was clear.

It was very ominous.

I felt a sense of resistance when using the skill itself, which was a kind of power.

"I'll check it later."

I'll confirm the skill in a more stable state. Taesan made a decision like that.

[Skill: Opponent of Annihilation] [Proficiency: 1%] [When facing an existence that embodies the will of annihilation, the skill's might and intensity are maximized.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"When facing a demon that can burn the world, this skill was of great help. Since I think I will encounter such an enemy in the future, it's not a bad skill to have.

[Special permanent activation skill: Resolute Will] [Proficiency: 1%] [Reaching a higher state of mind, one can resist corruption by spirit and will, and overcome with determination.]

"Ah."

The Taesan's eyes lit up. It was a good skill.

Right now, the Taesan was trying to handle the holy and black energies, but his mind was becoming corrupted and was about to be consumed by them.

This skill was there to compensate for that. Since it's a skill that will be used frequently, it's quite good.

The new, powerful will that had been obtained was like a fragment of the will obtained previously, appearing as an item made of materials. I thought of going to Half-ran to confirm it.

And what the Taesan wanted to confirm above all was something.

The Taesan gazed at the ring that was exuding a thick aura.

The ring was a reward for clearing the strengthened trial, given by the League. The power felt from within was beyond imagination."
Here is the translation of the text:

"The Ring of Distorted Retrospection for the Regretful" [Increases vitality by 100] [Increases mana by 100] [Increases attack power by 100] [Increases defense power by 100] [Allows you to reset the cooldown of one designated skill, but only for skills with a cooldown of less than a week. This effect lasts for a month.]
