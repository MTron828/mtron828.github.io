Chapter 284

284. 62nd Floor (1)

"...Did you find the princess's soul?"

Bellbangkia spoke in a trembling voice. Tae-san shook his head.

"I'm not sure if it's the princess. I entered the realm of the god of downfall, where the souls of mortals who are suffering in pain gather."

There was nothing but suffering souls there.

Hundreds of souls. They were all receiving expectations from the god of downfall, only to be betrayed.

"Most of them seemed to have lost their sense of self and turned black, but one soul was still gray. It seemed to be holding onto its sense of self, even as it was being eroded around it."

Bellbangkia's eyes widened.

"I don't know if that's the princess you're looking for. But if the god of downfall didn't intervene with the princess at the end, it's likely that the princess was captured by the god of downfall relatively recently."

"Hah, hah, hah."

Bellbangkia laughed. Her eyes were full of hope and expectation.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, so that's how it is. I've never seen the God of Despair take on a form like that since the princess."

"What makes you so sure?"

"It's because no one has been chosen by the God of Despair since I took my seat here. None of the adventurers who were chosen by the God of Despair have returned."

Belbangkia's eyes welled up with tears and he let out a sob.

"Oo... Princess... You're still holding on to yourself even after being swallowed by the Transcendent One. Please wait just a little longer. I'll move to rescue you..."

The mountain god waited for him to calm down. Thirty minutes later, he finally composed himself and scratched his head with a sheepish expression.

"I'm sorry. I got a bit carried away."

"It's okay."

Belbangkia had been stuck in the labyrinth for hundreds of years, waiting to rescue the princess. Even if hundreds of years were to pass, it was impossible to predict what would happen.

If one considered the purpose of opposing the God, it might take thousands of years.

And if time passed like that, there was a high possibility that the princess would completely deteriorate.

Belbangkia gazed at the princess's rescue, but deep down in his heart, he had already given up.
Here is the translation of the text:

But I saw hope now. I also confirmed that the princess had not lost her sense of self yet.

It was enough to be happy.

"But it seems that her physical body has already been lost," he said.

"I knew that. To the gods, a mortal's physical body is of little value, so they would naturally separate the soul. It's fine. I've prepared for that."

Belbangkia smiled wryly.

"Have you tried using the orgele?"

"No, I didn't have the time because I was right in front of the gods."

"Well, then there's nothing to do. I came back perfectly fine after seeing the gods themselves, you know..."

Belbangkia looked at the Taesan with eyes full of expectation, and soon smiled wryly.

"Alright. I'll be waiting."

[You have cleared the 61st floor.] [You have obtained the Emperor's Ring.] [You have obtained the reward from the secret room, the staff of the dormant mortal.] [??? has been obtained.]

The secret room reward was automatically given when the 61st floor was cleared. Belbangkia left the place.

"Take your time to check."

"Thank you."

Taesan sat down and checked the rewards he had obtained.

This is the 61st floor. The rewards are changing to the next level.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The Emperor's Ring] [Strengthening the body by 1000] [Increasing mana by 200] [Increasing attack power by 80] [Increasing defense by 80] [A ring that was used by the emperor who ruled over all continents. No one could resist him, and everyone knelt down before him. Until the immortal destroyed the world, the emperor was indeed absolute.]

“Ah.”

The Taesan raised his eyebrows.

This is not a secret reward or a quest reward. It's just a simple clear reward, but its performance is impressive. It's a valuable equipment.

[The Staff of the Unconscious Mortal] [Increasing magic by 200] [Increasing mana by 1200] [Increasing intelligence by 500] [The staff of the unconscious mortal. Although it has the potential to become a transcendent being after a lifetime of training, the lazy mortal chose to meet his death as a mortal.]

The magic value is over 200.

The mana is also attached to 1200. It's an extraordinary staff.

Of course, it's not necessary to use the staff in the Taesan's battle style. If it's offered to the god of magic as an offering, it will be a good sacrifice for a middle-grade magic.

‘If the staff is this good, then...’

What is the level of the black?

The Taesan soon found out.

[He used ???] [He obtained the Heavenly Great Sword] [The Heavenly Great Sword] [Increasing attack power by 250] [The sword of the greatest sword in the world. It is the sword that no one can catch up to. It is the sword that has the power to control the world.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The effect was extremely simple. The explanation was also simple.

However, it was a powerful weapon in a simple way. Its attack power was 250, which was 100 points higher than the current weapon he was wearing.

"Good."

Tae-san swung the weapon and checked its balance. After a few tries, he got a rough feel for it.

The 61st floor reward ended with this, but there were still things to be confirmed.

The God of Falling. The points and equipment gained by clearing the ordeal, and a skill.

The God of Falling was prepared to give it to Amelia, but now it belonged to Tae-san.

[The necklace at the bottom of the abyss] [Strength + 100] [Agility + 100] [Intelligence + 100] [It continuously reduces the stats of the enemy by a certain percentage during combat.]

It was a rather unusual equipment, as expected of the God of Falling. Tae-san wore the necklace and drew his sword in front of Belladonna.

"Can we have a brief spar?"

"What? You can't give us a reward now?"

"I know. It's because of the equipment's effect, so I'll check it out."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hmm... That's fine. Considering what you've done, it's about right."

Bellbangkia waved her hand.

Tae-san kicked his foot.

Bellbangkia dodged the magic shot at her and swung her sword. Instead of taking the absolute judgment, she chose to dodge.

As the battle continued, Bellbangkia's expression became puzzled.

"Hey?"

Her movements became slightly, but definitely, slower. While the speed of magic execution was almost imperceptible, it was slowed down slightly.

"Is that a curse-casting tool?"

"It looks like it. Has your stats dropped significantly?"

"Just a moment."

Bellbangkia pretended to open her status window. Looking at the empty air, she said:

"About 5% dropped."

"That's right."

Tae-san sharpened his sword. So, it was quite a good equipment.

Tae-san was about to face an existence that was the guide of the wicked path. It was the leader. As they had descended to the depths, Tae-san and his stats were similar to, or even higher than, theirs.

When facing such enemies, dropping 5% of one's stats was undoubtedly a significant meaning.
Here is the translation:

[Special Skill: Forced Descent] [Mana Consumption: 200] [Proficiency: 1%] [Decreases the opponent's stats by a certain ratio for a certain period of time.]

Simple explanation. It was easy to understand. Taesan begged Belldeonia to understand and activated the skill.

[You have activated Forced Descent.]

"Ah."

Belldeonia let out a sigh. He said, "It's definitely lowered my stats. This level of effect is significant enough to have a significant impact on the battle, isn't it?"

"It's fine."

This skill was designed to be activated at the start of the battle. Both equipment and skills were designed to weaken the opponent rather than strengthening oneself.

Belldeonia's face was slightly pale. For someone opposed to the God of Descent, the skill granted by the God of Descent would naturally evoke some resistance. However, Taesan's obtained power was not something to be interfered with.

"Then."

It was time to spend points.

2,410 points. It was a significant amount of points.

The place to use them was already decided.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Special Permanent Active Skill: Double Casting] [Proficiency: 1%] [When using this power, which consumes mana, or magic, or a separate energy, you can simultaneously use two skills. However, the execution speed of the power is significantly slowed down.]

Immediately, points are consumed. When proficiency reaches around 50%, the consumption of points increases exponentially. At that moment, Taesan stopped upgrading proficiency.

[Special Permanent Active Skill: Double Casting] [Proficiency: 49%] [When using this power, which consumes mana, or magic, or a separate energy, you can simultaneously use two skills. The execution speed of the power has significantly accelerated.] [You have activated the frozen world.] [You have activated the starlight arrow.]

Two spells are simultaneously executed. Ice is charging towards Taesan, and a starlight arrow is being executed in his hand.

Belnkiya, who has been watching, opens his mouth in surprise.

"Simultaneous execution of magic? Is this really Double Casting?"

Belnkiya is a magician who has gone deep into the depths of magic. Naturally, he had Double Casting. Therefore, he could not help but be shocked even more.

Double Casting was a power that even magicians who had focused on magic couldn't easily obtain. And even if they obtained it, before upgrading proficiency, it wasn't worth much.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, once you surpassed a certain level, it was a skill that held immense value. At the same time, it was an essential power that allowed you to implement multiple magic spells in various situations.

As for Taesan, his proficiency in double casting had increased significantly, making his casting much faster.

At this level, he could even use it in actual combat. Taesan thought so and smiled satisfactorily.

Even when implementing two spells simultaneously, there was no significant difference in speed compared to when he used one spell.

Then, what if... Taesan used both magic and mana simultaneously.

[You have activated the Frozen World.] [You have activated Naburius' Golden Sword.]

The Frozen World is activated. The Golden Sword is summoned through the implemented channel and wielded as is.

The golden trajectory is drawn in the labyrinth.

To properly handle black magic, one had to open the channel with magic. However, it took time to open the channel, so he had to create a gap and use it.

But now, thanks to double casting, he can create that gap as he pleases. The utilization of black magic has become even more convenient.

The results exceeded expectations. Now, the question was how to use the remaining points.
Here is the translation of the text:

There was nothing that seemed worthy of being done. Most of the skills had already reached a certain level, and now they were consuming too many points, resulting in decreased efficiency.

Tae-san spent the remaining points on various skills. As a result, some skills reached the threshold of changing their content, and the jump and landing rates increased by 20%.

[Special activation skill: Jump] [Consumed mana: 30] [Proficiency: 20%] [Can jump very high and go further.] [Condition: Advanced swordsmanship [Ability Sword] [Can lift the opponent's weapon from a lower position.]

[Special activation skill: Landing] [Consumed mana: 20] [Proficiency: 20%] [Can land on the ground from mid-air.] [Condition: Advanced swordsmanship [Ability Sword] [When your sword is higher than the opponent's weapon, you can strongly knock the opponent down.]

The proficiency of landing didn't change much, but the jump was a different story. The jump could really reach the end of the sky, depending on the proficiency.

Landing also gained significance due to the effect of Ability Sword.

"So, go well. I'll wait for the next meeting."

Note: Tae-san is likely a character name, and Ability Sword is a special ability or skill.
Here is the translation:

"It's all over. Bellbangia waved her hand. Tai Shan went down to the labyrinth.

[Start of 62nd floor quest.] [Climb the 62nd floor maze and defeat the owner of the maze.] [Reward: Athena's Crimson Wristband.] [Secret reward: ???]"
