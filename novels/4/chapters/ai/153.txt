Chapter 154

154. The Forgotten Shrine of the God, the Lost God's Shrine (2)

Tae-san picked up a broken arrow.

[A self-aware arrow] [An arrow that moves on its own to protect its owner. Currently, it is broken and cannot be used.]

Tae-san gazed at the broken arrow.

A ghost who had been watching Tae-san noticed something.

[What are you thinking about?]

“Is it worth doing?”

[I don't know... It might be possible, but it seems a bit dangerous.]

“There's enough value to try.”

Tae-san raised his head.

[You have activated scouting.]

A skill that reveals information within one's field of vision. Scouting.

However, nothing appeared.

When considering that the forgotten goddess's secrets were hidden, it seemed that scouting did not work on things related to the goddess.

[You have activated the trap release.]

The trap release skill was activated, but no window appeared. It was one of two possibilities: there was no trap, or the trap was too high-level for Tae-san's skills to detect.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tao Shan was absolutely sure that the next one would come.

Tao Shan took a step forward. At the same time, an arrow shot out from the wall.

Ah!

The arrow, which was moving erratically and causing confusion in his field of vision, was shot by himself.

Tao Shan concentrated his mind.

[You have activated mind acceleration.]

As long as the arrow's trajectory is read based on how much you move your self, it's meaningless. The important thing is field of vision and response.

Tao Shan dodged the arrow that was flying towards him, trying to pierce his legs. Although it was a very close call, he was able to avoid it all thanks to his high agility.

Then, the arrow's movement changed.

The arrow started flying towards Tao Shan's blind spot.

But Tao Shan was waiting for it.

Tao Shan's skill. The twin eyes of coordination allow him to see beyond his field of vision.

With the assistance of the sensory enhancement skill, he could block even an attack from behind, as if it were visible.

The arrow flew towards Tao Shan's shoulder blade. Tao Shan waited until the end and, at the most critical moment, turned his body around.
Here is the translation of the text:

The arrow tried to break free from its trajectory, but thanks to the mountain's patience, it failed to do so.

The arrow was caught by the mountain's hand.

Then, the arrow began to struggle. It violently tried to break free from the mountain's hand, slowly pulling away. As the arrow was about to escape, the mountain said, "Wait."

 Suddenly, a bunch of whips wrapped around the mountain's arm, and the mountain grasped the arrow.

The arrow was fixed in the mountain's hand. The mountain held it firmly and brought it down to the ground.

Pffft!

A small hole was created.

A ghostly figure asked worriedly, "Is it going to break apart?"

"It won't break apart," the mountain replied.

The arrow was not that weak, after all.

The mountain held the arrow firmly in its hand.

The arrow struggled a few more times before becoming still.

"The arrow has gained self-awareness," the mountain said.

The mountain released its grip on the arrow.

As the mountain opened its hand, the arrow was quietly lying in its palm.

The ghost was amazed, saying, "This is really something."

The ghost could see that the arrow's movements were quick and unpredictable. Its speed was similar to the mountain's, and if the timing was off, it might not be able to hold onto it until its energy was exhausted.
Here is the translation of the text:

It didn't take 20 minutes to catch it.

Tae-san laughed.

"Ah, just as expected."

When he first discovered the secret room in solo mode, he was caught off guard by a trap of arrows.

Tae-san used the arrows that were flying towards him to catch the giant rat.

The traps in the labyrinth become the property of the adventurer who grasps them.

I remembered that trick and tried it again, and it was successful.

Tae-san checked the arrow.

[A self-aware arrow] [An arrow that moves on its own to protect its owner. It moves on its own, but cannot exceed a certain range.] [Current owner: Kang Tae-san] [The user's level is insufficient. Attack power: 1]

Tae-san threw the arrow. The arrow floated in mid-air, then began to circle around Tae-san.

Tae-san's smile deepened.

"Is it good?"

The arrow that doesn't require any attention can attack on its own. Its speed is also fast, and the power contained within it is almost too much for Tae-san to handle.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Although the attack power was very low, it was sufficient to annoy the opponent a little and change the outcome of the battle. "I'll gather a bit more."

Taisan took another step forward.

This time, two arrows appeared.

The arrows aimed at Taisan and at the same time, the arrows controlled by Taisan also moved, starting to restrain each other.

Thanks to this, Taisan could focus on the remaining arrow. He quickly shot down the approaching arrow and then grabbed the other arrow and stuck it to the ground.

He put strength into the arrow trying to escape. The arrow thrashed about several times and then stopped.

[You have obtained an arrow with self-awareness.]

"Good."

This is the second one.

Taisan smiled satisfactorily and was still not done enjoying himself.

There were still many paths left.

* * *

As Taisan advanced as expected, more and more arrows appeared.

Two, three, and finally four arrows flew out at the same time.

In the end, Taisan was able to grasp a total of four arrows.

"It's not enough."

Taisan looked at the arrows swirling around him with an ambiguous expression.
Here is the translation:

"The number of arrows was not as many as I expected. The more arrows there were, the more disorganized the battle formation became, and I couldn't even grasp the ground to steady myself.

"Well, I'll be satisfied with this. Look at how greedy you are."

The ghost was amused by the mountain's appearance. The arrow, which had a sense of self, was like a kind of ego crisis.

An object or tool with a sense of self was highly valued.

The mountain said that the whip-like arm guard it was holding was a tool that couldn't be found in this low-level place. It was saying that it was a valuable item.

But the ghost thought it was ridiculous to say that they got four of those and still weren't satisfied.

"It seems like the arrow trap is over, doesn't it?"

"It does, yeah."

Boom!

The mountain's front was surrounded by large, circular-bladed swords that were moving in a semicircle.

"It's a classic."

The arrow trap, fixed to a central axis, moved along with the swords. It was a typical trap that anyone could think of.

About ten swords were moving at a set distance from each other."
Here is the translation of the text:

Upon taking a closer look, it seemed that everything was moving slowly and the gap was quite wide, so it didn't seem like a big problem to break through one by one.

"There's no way that could happen."

The arrow also had its own will. It couldn't be just an ordinary arrow.

Tai Shan decided to try it out first.

He threw his body into the trajectory of the sword. And suddenly, the speed of the sword changed. It was what he had expected, so Tai Shan calmly raised his sword.

Whoa!

A solid sensation transmitted through the sword. He took a step back, but he didn't think he couldn't block it at that level.

Ka ka ka!

The circular sword began to rotate wildly. In an instant, sparks flew out of the sword and began to push back.

It's impossible to block. Tai Shan quickly released his strength into the sword and jumped back.

Then, the axis of the sword moved strangely and the trajectory changed. Tai Shan quickly blocked it again, but couldn't withstand the rotation and allowed a blow to hit his chest.

[The first attack was canceled.]

Tai Shan calmly analyzed the information outside the trap.

'It can't be blocked.'
Note: This appears to be a scene from a fantasy novel or game, with magical or superhuman elements.
Here is the translation of the text:

The power of the sword itself can be blocked, but the subsequent rotation was the problem. The additional rotation that occurred was so sudden and difficult to respond to that it was impossible to avoid it unconditionally.

However, not only speed but also trajectory changed freely, making it difficult to dodge. As I pondered, a ghostly voice spoke to me.

[Isn't it a bit reckless to rely on the invalidation of the attack and rush in?]

"It's too variable. We can't predict how the sword will move. And this device has no value in invalidating the attack."

The greatest advantage of invalidating the attack was that it could make the opponent confused, rather than returning to their original state before the attack.

Meanwhile, the main pattern of Taesan was to deal a huge amount of damage.

But the device had no emotions. If it had returned to its original state before the attack, it would only work again and attack.

"I don't know what will happen then."

I had not yet figured out how the sword would move.

It was possible that I would be caught in the sword's path after relying on the invalidation of the attack and rushing in, without even knowing the information.

"There is a seal, so I can escape with a blink, but since the invalidation of the attack is limited, there's no reason to do it for now."
Here is the translation of the text:

The ghost nodded and closed its mouth.

After some thought, Tai Shan decided to try one more experiment.

Tai Shan drew his sword towards the incoming blade.

[You activated the slash.]

Just as the sword and blade were about to meet, the blade twisted.

As it twisted, the trajectory changed, and Tai Shan was forced to retreat, but he still obtained the information he wanted.

The blade became the target of the ability sword.

"It's more spacious than I thought."

There are skills that don't activate with certain devices, so I checked it out and was satisfied with the result.

With this, the solution became clear.

Tai Shan took a deep breath. He changed his greedy choice from attack power to strength and kicked off.

I realized it when I used slash just now.

The rotation of the blade is triggered when it's in contact with the sword.

So, if you just repel the blade, the problem is solved.

[You activated the shockwave.]

Tai Shan swung his arm wildly towards the incoming blade.

Kaaa!

It's not at the same level as blocking it, and the blade bounces back.

"Ah, yes."

When you activate shockwave, you can push it away at that level.
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan charged forward directly. The swords that were moving erratically aimed at Taesan, but he avoided those that could be dodged and cut down those that couldn't. Those that couldn't be dodged were neutralized by attacking them invalidly.

Ta.

Taesan arrived at the end of the trap without allowing a single bit of damage.

It was a satisfying strategy. Taesan had a happy expression.

"This is a long time since I've seen this."

There were traps in the secret rooms on each floor, but they had no meaning with the current stats. The traps were destroyed by simply brushing them off.

It was a perfect trap-clearing this time.

This was a happy time for Taesan, who liked this kind of thing.

"Where will it end?"

Taesan took a step forward, filling his expectations.

* * *

After that, more traps appeared.

Falling platforms that would explode when touched, walls that would come rushing towards you, and more.

Taesan cleared all of them perfectly using skills and items.

The next trap was a trigger that would spring a net and pull Taesan into the labyrinth.

Note: Taesan is likely a character's name, and the story appears to be from a game or novel.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san first used an arrow to check if there was a trap. It wasn't a judgment of attack, but rather a trigger that didn't activate the trap. It was impossible for the skill that released the binding to work on this kind of trap. Since it seemed that there was a high risk of falling, Tae-san began to approach slowly. After checking several things, Tae-san gained several pieces of information. The ceiling opened, and the net fell to the ground, pressing down on it with great force. Then, after a certain period of time, the ground opened, and Tae-san disappeared into the labyrinth. The trigger for the trap was shock. Even a very slight shock could transmit through the tunnel and cause the net to engulf the entire tunnel. Therefore, the solution was simple: don't cause any shock. [You have activated the "Wind Walking" skill.] By wrapping his body with wind, he prevented any shock from being transmitted through the tunnel. After increasing his agility with the skill, he jumped to the ground. However, the tunnel was far away. It was impossible to reach it with a single jump. [You have activated the "Mid-Air Jump" skill.] So, he jumped again.
Here is the translation:

Soaring through the air, crossing the void.

But the path was not yet over.

Still, half or more remained.

As the foot of the Great Mountain touched the ground, the ceiling opened, and the net dropped, and the Great Mountain quickly kicked out.

I clung to the ceiling as hard as I could.

[You have activated the Stamp.]

And as the net enveloped the Great Mountain, it touched the ground, and the Great Mountain activated magic again.

[You have randomly blinked.]

The Stamp fixes the location of the random blink.

Thanks to the Stamp being stuck to the ceiling, the Great Mountain's physical body, which was lying on the net, moved above the net.

As the net was lying on the ground, kicking the ground would not make it drop again.

I kicked the ground and used the aerial jump again to reach the end of the path.

However, the Great Mountain did not pass through the path.

Continuously manipulating the path, I summoned the net.

And after using various things, I discovered that Mephisto's black lightning could slightly rustle the net.

"Is there no harm in black magic?"
Here is the translation:

Tahesan summoned the net one more time and used all his magic to cast a black lightning bolt again.

As a result, he was able to obtain a net about 1 meter long.

The ghost, who saw Tahesan's satisfied expression, exclaimed with a mix of admiration and surprise.

"[Is this guy crazy?]"
