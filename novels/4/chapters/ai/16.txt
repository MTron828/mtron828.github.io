17. 2nd Floor (2)

Seeing that he showed no particular hostility despite mastering the Iron Lock technique, it didn't seem like there was significant opposition between them, but it was still wise to be cautious.

Unlike with Ainz Ooal Gown and the Dwarves, there could easily be NPCs who are hostile enough to kill each other.

"Do you need anything else?"

"I don't have money, so this will do for now."

"Then hurry down. You don't want to wander around and lose your sense of direction, right?"

"I already thought about that."

Taesan passed by the shop and headed towards the 2nd floor. The Dwarf waved his hand in farewell.

"See you on the next floor."

Thud.

The door closed. At the same time, a system window appeared.

[This place is slightly off the entrance of the labyrinth.] [A place where those who die when stabbed with a knife live. The power here is not that strong.] [2nd Floor Quest Initiated.] [Defeat the boss of the 2nd floor and proceed.] [Reward: Basic Mana Increase Potion.] [Secret Reward: ???]

"A mana increase potion?"
Here is the translation of the text:

---

It was a potion that increased mana, extremely valuable and not sold in stores. He hadn't seen many of them as he wandered through the labyrinth.

If it's basic, it would increase about 10 points. Since his current mana was only about 15 points, it held considerable value. This would greatly reduce the restrictions on using skills.

With expectations, Taesan proceeded down the passage.

Ding.

A notification sounded, indicating someone was calling him. Taesan opened the community.

\[Gang Taesan [Alone]: What's up?\] \[Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: Ah, there you are.\]

Terrifyingly, posts flooded in as Taesan posted.

\[Lee Sang [Alone]: It's Taesan! You're alive!\] \[Kim Taejin [Alone]: Thanks to you, I was able to reach the Fountain of Life! Thank you so much!\] \[Kim Junan [Alone]: Taesan! I have something to ask you!\] \[Kim Suhyun [Alone]: Taesan! Taesan! Wow! It's Taesan!\]

In an instant, words filled his view. Taesan replied roughly.

\[Gang Junhyuk requested a whisper to Gang Taesan.\]

Taesan accepted the request.

Here is the translation of the text into English:

\[Gang Junhyuk \[Alone\]: Wow. This is serious. Can't even say anything, huh?  
\[Gang Taesan \[Alone\]: What's going on?  
\[Gang Junhyuk \[Alone\]: It's nothing major. Just checking if you're still alive.  
\[Gang Taesan \[Alone\]: Shouldn't you be worrying about yourselves more than me?  
\[Gang Junhyuk \[Alone\]: I'm stuck here, what else can I do? Seriously though, thinking back gives me chills. Thank you, hyung. Everyone's thankful to you.  
\[Gang Taesan \[Alone\]: If you trusted and followed, then that's enough.

Taesan had left a post in the community regarding the strategy for the 1st floor. By following the most optimized route to the Fountain of Life, there was a reasonable chance of surviving.

However, he didn't have high expectations.

A person trapped in an unknown space with limited options, relying solely on simple community posts to challenge their fate? It seemed impossible. He doubted they would follow without suspicion.

Yet contrary to Taesan's expectations, most of those in Alone mode followed his strategy.

\[Gang Taesan \[Alone\]: It's not for me to say, but did you really throw yourself in here based on just one post?  
\[Gang Junhyuk \[Alone\]: Can't help it. We were all at our limits. Even wanted to catch onto a straw, you know?  

Upon hearing Gang Junhyuk's words, it became clear it was a very simple reason.

If they didn't enter the labyrinth, they couldn't obtain provisions. Not eating wouldn't directly lead to loss of health or death. It was just a matter of consuming stats and mental energy, so if they decided to endure, they could continue doing so for as long as they liked.

However, hunger was another issue.
Trapped by disaster, some had starved to their limits to the point of cutting off and eating their own limbs. This signified that the pain of starvation was greater than the horror and agony of severing.

Here, since they couldn't even die, they had no choice but to endlessly gnaw at their hunger and live on.

People were worn out.

Unlike other modes where players could meet and converse, that wasn't possible here.

Outside the labyrinth, in the village, there were only NPCs who gave predetermined responses. The Broken Man refused conversation altogether.

While some interaction was possible through the community, it was vastly different from meeting and speaking face-to-face.

There was no one to talk to.

Nothing to eat.

It was a perfect environment for madness.

Indeed, in the previous world, numerous Alone players had perished haphazardly, entering as if to abandon survival and commit suicide.

In such circumstances, Taesan posted a message.

A strategy for the first floor.

\[Gang Junhyuk \[Alone\]: Hyung, you said not to expect much, but from our perspective, your post was really necessary.]

Taesan's post contained information.

There was a shopkeeper inside the labyrinth, and on the first floor, there were monsters like Copybara, creatures that targeted only ankles. Upon spotting them, one could flee immediately and return to the shop.

This was the information conveyed.
Alone mode's labyrinth was an unknown entity to players. The reason they didn't venture inside was also substantial. It was the fear of the unknown, not knowing what would come out.

But thanks to Taesan, they obtained information.

Those who shook off their fear of the unknown began to prepare themselves to enter the labyrinth.

Among them, Lee Taeyeon was the first to attempt it.

Following Taesan's advice, she entered the labyrinth, met the shopkeeper, and arrived at the Fountain of Life. She broke through the labyrinth and survived.

Lee Taeyeon left many complaints in the community. To those who saw the community, Lee Taeyeon was someone as afraid as anyone else.

Yet she succeeded.

In other words, they could also arrive at a place where infinite recovery was possible. It was a very enticing proposition. Following Lee Taeyeon's success, many Alone players rushed into the labyrinth.

Not everyone succeeded. Even if they knew the strategy, it wasn't an easy difficulty. The Fountain of Life was quite far from the shop. There was also a not insignificant chance of encountering a Big Rat on the way.

Still, compared to the previous world, an unprecedented number managed to reach the Fountain of Life. The difference was astounding, even to Taesan.

However, arriving and capturing the Big Rat were separate issues.
Even if infinite recovery was possible, capturing monsters faster than reaction speed was impossible unless one had an innate talent for it.

Most continued to challenge themselves while soothing their hunger at the fountain.

Only two had succeeded in hunting.

Lee Taeyeon.

And now, conversing with him, was Kang Junhyuk.

[Taesan [Alone]: What were you planning to do before my post came up?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: I was just planning to run through the labyrinth. I couldn't stand being hungry. I planned to eat after beating monsters and everything.]

A 17-year-old boy who had not yet become an adult. He had already won against the Big Rat, so he must have talents similar to Lee Taeyeon's.

But his name was unheard of.

In the previous world, he would have been dead after fighting the Big Rat. He survived as an Irregular who left a post.

"..."

Would the number of clearers increase just because he left a strategy?

Taesan didn't think so. Even if he barely managed to catch the Big Rat, he wouldn't be able to go down further. Survival rate and clearance rate were separate.

Even in the previous world, there were a few who reached the Fountain of Life. However, except for Lee Taeyeon, no one passed the 1st floor.
The only ones with a chance to clear are Lee Taeyeon and Kang Junhyuk.

"Is it worth nurturing?"

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: What are you doing right now?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: I'm taking a break after catching the Big Rat.] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: What about Lee Taeyeon?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: He's probably sleeping right now.] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: Have you met the Holy Knight?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Huh? Who's that?]

It was an unfamiliar expression. Since the previous Lee Taeyeon had met Ainsharl, it wouldn't be strange to meet him once if he stayed at the Fountain of Life.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: A strange old man looking for a god will come. He's an NPC whose treatment changes depending on your actions. He'll attack you out of the blue, so don't be scared and respond properly. Then you might get something useful.]

I don't know if I'll give you the skills of a Light Weapon, but I can get other skills. In the early days, each skill was precious.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Tell Lee Taeyeon when he wakes up.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Um......] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: What's wrong?]
Kang Junhyuk showed signs of hesitation for a moment. Eventually, as if he had made up his mind, he left a message.

[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Hyung, are you okay?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: What are you talking about?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Aren't you giving me too much? I appreciate your help, but in the end, we're competitors trying to conquer the Labyrinth together.]

Taesan paused at the unexpected remark. Junhyuk continued to write.

[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Of course, I'm weaker than you right now, but if you give me so much, I might catch up soon, right? I naturally have no intention of doing anything to you, but I feel like you're being too kind. You don't need to just give away what you've worked hard to achieve.]

Taesan chuckled.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Did you struggle to say that?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: I was being serious...]

Junhyuk's words were also understood. No one wants to give away their hard-earned achievements to others without any conditions.

But Junhyuk was mistaken.
[Kang Taesan [Alone]: What kind of competition is this? We're all humans on Earth facing inevitable destruction.]

They were not competitors. They were comrades.

There were a few chances to venture outside into the world before clearing. They would realize how foolish they had been then. There were those who couldn't grasp the minority subject and were running wild, but all of those individuals were monsters, or they died at the hands of Lee Taeyeon.

And another misconception.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: There's only one reason I'm telling you all this. It's to warn you not to die in a strange place.]

Knowing the strategy is a separate issue from actualizing it.

Lee Taeyeon's clearing of the Alone mode was an extraordinary stroke of luck upon luck. She herself said she wouldn't survive if she were to enter the Alone mode again.

A place where even those who have cleared can't guarantee another clearance.

That's the Alone mode.

Even if Kang Taesan were to tell Kang Junhyuk about the secret room right now, he wouldn't be able to clear it. There was a significant risk of becoming a prey with just the last fifteen arrows.
[Kang Taesan [Alone]: And do you think knowing that will enable you to catch up with me?]

Even when he cleared the Easy Mode, he was compared to Lee Taeyeon. Kang Junhyuk's words now felt like a chick telling its owner who feeds it that it will become stronger than the owner if it keeps feeding it.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Stop wasting your breath and focus on coming down hard.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Well, I couldn't even pass the first floor, so it sounds like you're talking nonsense.] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: Fine, you got it. Just work hard. I'm going further down.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Where are you right now?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: 2nd floor.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: ...Wow. I've barely caught the Big Rat. It's only been a week. Isn't this a bit too fast?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: Fast? It's just ordinary.]

In the middle of their conversation, a sudden thought crossed his mind.

"Come to think of it, isn't it about time?"

About a week had passed. It was a period for players in Easy and Normal modes to adapt. Taesan asked.
[Kang Taesan [Alone]: How's the community these days?]
[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Pretty ordinary. Oh, these days people from different modes are starting to chat a bit here and there. But... there are also some who like to pick fights. I've been ignoring them for now, but I don't understand why they're doing it.]

Those who pick fights.

Taesan knew exactly who they were.

"Looks like some clueless fools are starting to cause trouble."

Players in different modes couldn't see each other.

They misunderstood each other's strengths and started thinking their own mode was the hardest.

In the previous world, Taesan used to interfere, but now that he's gone, they can rampage as they please.

He wasn't particularly interested. If they rampage, they'll deal with it as they see fit.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Keep it up.]
[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Yes, hyung.]

Taesan turned off his whispering.

The structure of the second floor was similar to the first. It wouldn't be much different since it changes every ten floors.

Moss-covered bricks and floors were visible, and the interior of the maze seemed similar.

But Taesan knew better than anyone. The first floor of the Alone mode was half-tutorial. The real challenge started from the second floor.

A labyrinth where even the Fountain of Life couldn't be found, and recovery methods were severely limited.

Taesan knew what awaited him here.
Taesan walked through the corridor. A door came into view. Beyond this point, a room could be seen. Taesan opened the door just enough to peek inside.

"Squeak."

"Creak. Creak."

Green monsters appeared. They were humanoid in shape but small in stature, barely reaching Taesan's chest. Each carried a sword, shield, bow, or some other weapon, their grotesque fangs protruding as they chattered among themselves.

"Growl."

"Squeak, squeak!"

When one muttered something unintelligible, the other monsters erupted into laughter. It seemed like they had heard a funny joke.

"A goblin wielding a bow appeared." "A goblin wielding a short sword appeared." "A goblin wielding a short sword appeared." "A goblin wielding a shield appeared."

"Goblins."

Green monsters that were prevalent throughout the middle and upper floors, often appearing when things got quiet—the most common monsters encountered.

These were the monsters of the second floor.
