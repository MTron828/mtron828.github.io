30. 3rd Floor, Goblin Lord (4)

A sword, as large as a human, rests in the goblin's hand. Taesan steps back in disbelief at the surreal sight.

"Lord?"

A monster with a name. A named one. Goblin Lord. As the title suggests, much stronger than elite goblins. The ghost let out a groan.

"Oh... this isn't good. Why is a Lord level here?"

"Do you know about it?"

"It's literally the king of its race. It's an existence that transcends the boundaries and concepts of its kind, of which there is only one."

"It seems so."

Three times larger than any other goblin.

Big enough to dwarf Taesan.

Unwavering eyes and perfectly sculpted muscles.

A posture without any hesitation.

The difference was so awkward that it was embarrassing to call it a goblin. Even its clothes were neat, revealing none of the internal organs, unlike typical goblins.

"Even if it's a goblin, it's still a Lord. It's not the kind of monster you'd expect to find in these lower floors. Why is it here?"
Here is the English translation of the text:

The ghost continued murmuring about an unexpected situation. Taesan mentally absorbed the information and adjusted his posture.

Observing Taesan like that, Goblin Lord remained silent.

"Is this where you've come from?"

There was no reason to refuse. Taesan put strength into his ankles.

Swoosh!

His body accelerated. The wind harshly slapped his face. In an instant, he reached close and swung his sword down.

Clang!

The sound of metal clashing echoed. Taesan frowned.

Goblin Lord remained seated, without flinching, blocking his attack. Goblin Lord spoke, watching calmly.

"I don't blame you."

Unlike any goblin Taesan had seen so far, Goblin Lord's voice was not sharp but rather remarkably gentle.

"You too are just a plaything for them. But... I have a role to fulfill here as a monster."

Strength surged through the Lord's hand. The greatsword moved. The Lord calmly stated,

"So, I will kill you."

Power exploded.

Taesan felt as if a truck had rushed at him in that moment. A several-ton truck filled to the brim.

"You triggered Evade. The next attack is evaded."
Here is the English translation of the text:

It was a skill close to reflex. The trajectory of the sword twisted, hitting the wall. A large dent appeared on the wall.

"What the..."

Crash!

Lord moved his hand while remaining seated. The sword thrashed like a storm. Taesan gritted his teeth and put strength into his arms.

Clang!

With a rough sound, both swords bounced off each other. Lord's face showed a slight admiration.

"You're strong."

"What the..."

Taesan was impressed. His strength stat was 37. In Easy Mode, this stat was no issue up to the 50th floor.

However, Lord's greatsword was noticeably heavier. Dealing with an opponent even with a strength close to 40 was unbearable. Is this a monster from the 3rd floor?

"This balance is insane."

While Taesan muttered curses, Lord calmly swung the greatsword. A weapon the size of a person aimed to tear Taesan apart.

Taesan quickly made a decision.

A shield is unnecessary. Even if it's Lord's strength, blocking wouldn't just block. He discarded the shield and gripped Rocky Latas's sword with both hands.

Klang!

The swords clashed, and Taesan's knees bent. But he didn't touch the ground.
Here is the English translation of the text:

Not a level that couldn't be withstood even with both hands. Taesan scratched his sword and rushed at Lord. Sparks flew.

Clang!

The current situation is advantageous for Taesan. Lord is in a posture to strike down with his sword. He needs to raise his arm to attack again, but Taesan is digging in from below. At least he can't attack with his weapon.

At this timing, Taesan planned to stick close and deal significant damage. Judging from the fact that the opponent's weapon is a very large greatsword, he thought he had the advantage in close combat.

However, Lord calmly pulled back the sword with his back.

Instead of striking down with the sword blade, the handle aimed towards Taesan's face.

With a grim determination, Taesan activated his skill, [Evade].

"You have activated Evade. The next attack will be evaded."

The trajectory of the handle twists. It tries to forcibly hit Taesan's shoulder.

The skill has an absolute judgment in the labyrinth. To overcome it, there is no other way but to respond with a higher-level skill.

"Goblin Lord has activated Strong Strike. The next attack deals significant damage."

A calm system window obscured Taesan's view.

The handle, which was intended to be forcibly bent, now aims directly at Taesan's head.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan's pupils momentarily shook, but he quickly assessed the situation. He inserted the sword into his body to block.

Crash!

"Ugh!"

"You have received a strong impact. All actions will be slowed for 10 seconds."

His body trembled with a tingling sensation. His movements dulled to the point where he could feel it. The situation was dire. It was impossible to escape the attack range in this physical state.

There was only one answer.

He had to endure for 10 seconds.

Taesan steadied his breathing.

Lord raised his sword.

Clang!

The swords collided. Taesan had no advantage in strength, agility, or any other aspect. Even his movements were slowed, making it overwhelming just to block a single attack.

"You have triggered Counter. You retaliate against the opponent's next attack."

His body moved automatically. Controlling his physique instinctively to find the optimal path, he countered the opponent's attack with a skill.

However, it had its drawbacks. If he couldn't retaliate against the opponent no matter what, the skill would end at the level of avoiding the attack.

Still, simply avoiding an attack that would normally be unavoidable was crucial. The greatsword grazed right past his head. Cut-off strands of hair fluttered into the air.

5 seconds.
Here is the English translation of the text:

Lord pulled his sword to the side and swung it.

The sound of the air splitting sent chills down the spine.

Taesan dodged as if collapsing his body.

3 seconds.

His stance faltered. He couldn't avoid the successive attack.

"[You have triggered Evade. The next attack is evaded.] [You have triggered Counter. The next attack deals significant damage.] [You have triggered Evade. The next attack is evaded.]"

The trajectory of the attack twisted, returned to its original path, then twisted again. The greatsword bent around Taesan's waist.

"[You receive 46 damage.]"

0 seconds.

His physical state returned to normal.

Taesan swiftly got up, putting some distance between himself and Lord who calmly readjusted his posture as he pursued.

"Good grief."

A bitter laugh escaped. What on earth was that? The opponent still hadn't risen from their throne. Sitting down, they had overwhelmed Taesan.

[The opponent is an unbeatable enemy.]

Even without the system saying so, he knew. That was absolutely not an opponent to encounter on the 3rd floor. Even on the 7th floor, it would be understandableâ€”an enemy like that.

[You have to run away.]
Here is the English translation of the text:

The ghost's voice was serious, not playful as usual.

"That's not an opponent you can face right now. You should run away, get stronger, and come back."

"And then what?"

"What do you mean?"

Taesan calmly looked at Lord. Lord was still seated on his throne. The ghost seemed frustrated, as if pounding on his chest.

"If that's Lord, then we're not supposed to be facing adventurers from the 3rd floor! Besides, it's not like that thing is going anywhere!"

"Then there's nothing to gain. The rewards from each floor clearly diminish once you descend."

The irritated ghost fell silent.

"...You know that?"

"Of course."

Movement between floors in the labyrinth is free, but it doesn't mean the rewards are the same.

Once you descend a floor, the rewards from the previous floor significantly diminish. Experience and gold acquisition drop to one-fifth, and special rewards disappear altogether. That's why there are no people endlessly grinding on lower floors.

To obtain everything on this floor, they must resolve it now.

"I have no intention of descending."

They'll handle it here.
Here is the English translation of the text:

The ghost muttered as if unable to understand Taesan's stance.

"Arrogant. You've been cautious, raising your proficiency, and yet you challenge like this?"

"What are you talking about? This is all for this purpose."

He wasn't grinding for safety, to avoid danger.

If he were someone who valued his life, he would have chosen hard mode. Just clearing hard mode alone would make him much stronger.

But he chose Iron Mode.

It wasn't for survival.

It was a challenge risking his life.

Actions for rewards.

To slightly increase those odds, he disarmed traps, acquired skills, and raised proficiency.

"You... [No judgment necessary. You did not give up against an opponent that cannot be defeated!] [No judgment necessary. You have raised your spirits against an opponent that cannot be defeated!] [No judgment necessary. You have raised your will against an opponent that cannot be defeated!] [My stats have increased.] [You never break during battle.] [You have gained eyes that see through the opponent's weaknesses.] [I felt the respect that will be felt.]

"Brave soldiers."
Here is the English translation of the text:

Road's indifferent eyes filled with admiration. He gripped his sword with a serious expression.

"If you won't back down, then I too will face you head-on."

Taesan silently scrutinized Road. Surely he wouldn't place an opponent entirely unbeatable on the third floor. There must be some chance of success. As the judgment of an impossible opponent began to reveal weaknesses as a reward.

Road never got up from the throne once. At first, I thought he ignored him, but on closer inspection it wasn't.

"...... The legs."

"Huh?"

The ghost also noticed belatedly.

"That leg is crushed?"

Road had a large wound on his leg. Although I didn't feel overwhelmed by his presence, it seemed difficult to stand with a scar that cut through the entire thigh.

"Are you chased out in the area? "

"Are there things like that?"

"Yes, there are things like that. It might be a different race to come out someone, who unto there his life even unto forCell  Got
Here is the English translation of the text:

Regardless of what it was, the opponent had limitations in mobility. Taesan widened the distance. Road did not chase after him, quietly holding his ground.

It was certain. The opponent couldn't leave the throne.

In this situation, there was a chance of winning.

* * *

"Aren't you coming?"

The goblin asked with a bored expression. Taesan had been standing still for almost thirty minutes.

"Just wait a moment."

Taesan's mind was racing. He calculated how to fight tactically.

And he found the answer.

Road grinned broadly.

"Come. Brave one."

"Oh dear. This doesn't seem right..."

The ghost grumbled, but didn't display the pessimism it had just moments ago.

"Still, give it a try. We'll watch with expectation."

Taesan approached the wall and steadied his breath.

"You activated apnea."

He gathered his strength. To the limit, almost to the point of muscle tearing.

He then roughly struck the wall.

*Kwaaang!*

Vibrations spread through the wall. His strength wasn't enough to break it, but it was sufficient to dislodge things attached to it.

The room was adorned with numerous decorations. Animal bones. Ornate wooden ornaments, and heavy, large objects hung from the ceiling.
Here is the English translation of the text:

They all fell at once.

Decorations began to collapse like hail falling.

"Is this how it's coming?"

Road laughed joyfully, wielding his sword. The falling decorations were quite large. If hit directly, they could cause considerable damage. He had no choice but to fend them off with his sword.

Taesan swiftly drew his staff.

"You activated Fireball."

As flames gathered, he quickly switched his staff to a bow. He pulled back two arrows in rapid succession.

*Ping!*

Paralysis arrow and poison arrow were shot. Passing through the flying fireball, a flame arrow was completed. Immediately, he drew out the Staff of Mental Domination.

"You activated Confusion." [Rolling for judgment....]

"Hmm."

Road let out a soft groan.

But he easily shook it off. Taesan had anticipated this as well. Using the Staff of Mental Domination was just to create a slight opening.

Decorations obscured the view. With decorations falling throughout the entire room, Taesan had no corner to escape.

Instead of blocking, Taesan kicked off. Within the collapsing room, he charged towards Road.
Here is the English translation of the text:

"You activated Forced Duel. For the next 10 seconds, except for the opponent, you cannot take damage."
