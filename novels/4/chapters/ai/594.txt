**Chapter 595**

**595. Extra Story, Mashin (7)**

The city was enormous.

A majestic castle wall.

A sturdy gate.

And beyond that, a gigantic castle came into view.

Lucifer's eyes sparkled like a child who had found an expensive toy.

Ba'al chuckled at the sight.

[Shall we go in?]

"Of course!"

Lucifer said with confidence. Ba'al weakly pulled Lucifer into a hug.

And the space jumped.

Lucifer and Ba'al arrived at the city's alleyway.

"Whoa."

Lucifer carefully landed. With an excited face, she pulled Ba'al's hand.

"Come quickly."

[Yes, yes.]

Ba'al leisurely followed Lucifer from behind.

As Lucifer exited the alleyway, the first thing that caught her eye was the numerous people.

Many vendors selling various goods.

People were dancing with joyful faces. Something was bursting in the sky.

"Wow……."

[The timing is great. It seems today is a celebratory day.]

"A celebration?"

[It means a day to commemorate and enjoy something. You don't have that in your small model garden, do you?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I didn't have the freedom to enjoy anything to that extent, did I? That's right......

Lucifer gazed at people with sparkling eyes. A joyful atmosphere was conveyed to them.

[Enjoy yourself. You're a vessel for the transcendent. That's why I brought you here.]

"Lucifer."

[Yes?]

"Lucifer, call me by my name."

Baal laughed.

[Right, Lucifer.]

Lucifer watched the festival with sparkling eyes. She mingled with the crowd, confirming one by one that they were having fun together.

"Hahaha!"

A child passing by handed Lucifer a piece of candy. Lucifer froze for a moment, then looked up at Baal with a puzzled expression.

"This is......"

[It seems like a festival gift.]

"This is similar to what you gave me."

Lucifer, who had put the candy in her mouth, smiled in satisfaction.

"It's delicious."

After that, Lucifer continued to enjoy the festival. From her perspective, everything was new and amazing. After wandering around for a while, Lucifer grabbed Baal's sleeve.

"I want to try that now. The dish you liked the most."

[Alright.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ba'al took Lucifer to the restaurant. The restaurant already had a long line.

[There are a lot of people.]

Ba'al confidently stepped forward.

[Could you please make way for us?]

"What's going on? What's...?"

The person who suddenly spoke turned around, scowling, and shut their mouth.

Ba'al was currently disguising himself as a human.

An ordinary human couldn't detect the disguise.

However, despite that, an overwhelming presence was palpable. People unconsciously made way for him. Ba'al walked forward, as if it was only natural.

[Let's go in.]

"This is bad."

[Do you dislike it?]

"No, I like it."

Lucifer also walked confidently. It was a natural trait for someone who stood above others.

The two of them carefully sat down on wooden chairs. Before long, the waiter brought the menu, and Lucifer's eyes sparkled as she examined each item.

"Can we eat everything?"

[If you want to.]

Lucifer called the waiter and ordered all the menu items at the restaurant. The waiter looked at her with a "are you sure?" expression and took the order.

Before long, the dishes started to fill the table one by one.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lucifer picked up his chopsticks with a delighted face.

"It's all delicious. This is a new flavor."

Her face was extremely joyful. She savored each dish, enjoying the taste.

"Can you not eat that?"

[I'm enjoying it enough, it's okay.]

"Then I won't refuse."

Lucifer quickly devoured the food.

And the people around him began to watch with astonished eyes.

The restaurant wasn't small. Naturally, there were many types of dishes, and Lucifer ordered everything on the menu.

The amount of food was enough to fill the table.

It was not a quantity that a small child could finish. It would fill the stomach of a robust adult and still have some left over.

But Lucifer finished half of the dishes in an instant. And yet, his chopsticks didn't stop.

Lucifer tilted his head, looking puzzled at the gazes around him.

"Why are they looking at me like that?"

[You're eating an excessive amount compared to your body size.]

"If I increase my physical energy consumption, it's not a big deal, is it?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not something anyone can do. It must be a mysterious and sacred thing to them."

"Hmm."

Lucifer had a puzzled expression, but he didn't show any curiosity and instead focused on the food.

Before long, there were only empty plates left on the table.

Lucifer patted his belly.

"That was satisfying. Very."

"Then let's get up from our seats. There are many people eyeing our spot."

The two of them went outside. The festival was still ongoing. Lucifer looked around with a bright face and said to Baal,

"Can I go around by myself?"

"Why not?"

"It's just that I don't feel like enjoying myself when I'm with you. People keep looking at you."

"Hmm."

Even if he tried to hide himself, the intimidating aura was unavoidable. Above all, Baal's physique was overwhelmingly larger than that of a sturdy man. People naturally kept their distance.

Baal was hesitant.

It wasn't a big problem if Lucifer went around by himself, but somehow it bothered Baal. It was an emotion that even Baal himself couldn't understand.

"...... Whatever. It doesn't matter."

After some thought, Baal finally made a decision. He held out his hand.

"Snap."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A lump of metal fell onto Lucifer's hand.

[It's human money. With this much, I'll be able to move around without any problems.]

"Thank you."

Lucifer's face lit up as he ran off.

Baal watched him, hiding his body and observing his figure.

Lucifer's appearance, enjoying the festival, was like that of a normal kid his age. Baal felt something pleasant.

"Amazing. I didn't know I'd feel this way."

Baal gazed at Lucifer in a daze.

And as the night grew deeper...

An incident occurred.

Lucifer entered a narrow alley, and men who looked like thugs followed him from behind. Baal scowled.

His body moved into the alley, and as expected, a disturbing scene unfolded.

"Hehehe..."

"Huhu."

The men pulled out knives and threatened Lucifer.

"Looking at your clothes, you seem to be from a wealthy family, but you shouldn't be wandering around here carelessly."

"If you follow us quietly, nothing big will happen."

The men's greedy eyes fixed on Lucifer.

And Lucifer, with a seemingly bored expression, opened his mouth.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Why did you follow me? It was like this. It's a human trafficking scheme. I've accumulated knowledge, but I didn't expect to see it in reality."

"Cut the nonsense and follow me!"

"Is this a festival? What's the fun in this? No, this is your entertainment, isn't it?"

Lucifer snapped his fingers.

"If you want me, catch me yourself."

"You're talking nonsense, girl!"

The men rushed out. Lucifer's body moved.

He quickly lowered his posture and dodged under the man, then raised his hand and hit his jaw.

"Ugh."

The man, who received a sudden shock to his brain, fell down.

Lucifer slammed his body into the wall and accelerated towards another man.

"Ah, this!"

The man tried to grab Lucifer, but Lucifer lowered his posture even further and kicked upwards. The man's jaw shook and he fell down.

"Ugh ugh ugh!"

"This kid is!"

Other men rushed in.

Lucifer threw his body with a bored expression.

Lucifer is a transcendent being. At the age of seven, he defeated an immortal with pure technique alone. It was impossible for an ordinary human to push him back with simple numbers.

"This is no fun. You guys are."

Note: Lucifer is a name that is often associated with the devil or a fallen angel in Western mythology, but in this context, it seems to be used as a name for a powerful and skilled individual.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lucifer, who had knocked down the men in an instant, walked out of the alley with a bored expression.

The men who had stumbled to their feet gritted their teeth.

"Hey, call them all! We must catch that little brat!"

[You should have endured it.]

The men were startled by the sudden voice.

Ba'al had somehow blocked the entrance of the alley.

[It's a rare festival, but it's a pity to let it go to waste.]

"Who are you!"

[You've touched something valuable. It's very unpleasant.]

"What nonsense..."

Ba'al grabbed the man's head and applied force. A cracking sound echoed, and the man's brain and flesh stuck to the alley wall.

[You'll have to pay the price for that.]

"Ah, ah..."

Ba'al didn't allow them to speak.

One by one, he grabbed their heads and crushed them. They tried to scream and run away, but even that was not allowed. Ba'al's presence stopped them in their tracks.

[Get lost.]

Thud.

The last man was crushed.

Ba'al lightly wiped the blood from his hand.

[Didn't I promise not to get dirty?] [I promised not to get involved.]

Ba'al replied calmly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[I killed them with my own hands. They will return to their original place as a concept of death. I think this is fine.] [If it were up to me, I would have created a problem, but... not this time.]

Maria said with a relaxed tone.

"[Cleaning up the trash is something I also agree with.]"

It's not that the transcendent being is being kind to the mortal. What they protect is only the concept of the universe.

"[But... this is interesting.]"

Maria laughed with joy.

"[Why did I make such a strange proposal? It was because of that reason. Such talent was born in that small model garden. It's unbelievable.]"

Maria also saw the perfect vessel of the transcendent being, which was born from the child of the demon tribe.

"[If it were up to me, I would have trampled you and taken it in our hands.]"

Baal is a sinner, the enemy of the universe.

The fact that the vessel of the transcendent being was in his hands was a loss in itself.

As a transcendent being, Maria had to take it in her hands. In the current situation where she was opposing Baal, each transcendent being was crucial.

And it was also a good opportunity. Baal had promised not to defile the universe, so Maria could protect Lucifer alone.

"[But I won't move.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She had thought of abandoning Baal and Lucifer.

"[Everything is your choice. Do as your heart desires.] [You speak as if you know my heart.] [I know well. Baal, the high god who doesn't intervene, who doesn't come out of the demon world.]"

Maria chuckled.

"[I wondered why there was no movement, and it was because of this reason. I couldn't have imagined it.]"

Maria swung her hand, and the six wings scattered in all directions.

"[You felt emotions when you killed these insignificant things.]"

They were beings that couldn't even become dust compared to Baal. There was no reason for Baal's emotions to be stirred when killing them.

But that wasn't the case.

Baal felt considerable discomfort and anger when killing them.

"[You could have killed them with just a light touch, but you crushed their heads with your own hands. You wanted them to feel fear and despair. That's how much value they had to you.] [Nonsense.]"

Baal spoke calmly.

"[They have no value to me.] [Then there must be something that gives them value.]"

Maria let out a mocking laugh.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You probably know what that is yourself.]"

Baal didn't answer. Maria's eyes sparkled.

"[It's a very small tremble, but... it's a huge tremble for a being like you. But, you know. It's a contradiction.]"

An irreconcilable contradiction.

"[Whatever choice you make, a change will occur for you. I'm curious about what will happen.]"

Baal didn't answer.

Fireworks exploded.

The festival began to signal its end.
