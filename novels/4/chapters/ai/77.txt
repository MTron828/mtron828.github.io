Episode 78

78. 14th Floor, Guide of Sin (1)

Aldoata fell. Barely regaining consciousness, he struggled in resistance but was ultimately trampled by Taesan. Aldoata shouted in terror.

"Sleep...!"

"I don't want to hear it."

A sword pierced Aldoata's chest. With a gurgling sound, life faded from Aldoata's eyes.

[Your spiritual essence has been triggered. Strength permanently increases by 20. Agility permanently increases by 18. Intelligence permanently increases by 13. Stamina permanently increases by 70. Mana permanently increases by 20.] [Your spiritual essence has been triggered. Acquired basic transcendence skill [Werewolf].] [Your level has increased.]

"Hwiwoo."

Taesan whistled. It was a substantial increase.

"Isn't it more profitable to hunt adventurers than monsters?"

[Because what you have doesn't make sense.]

Spiritual essence increase is a theft of strength. Perhaps because it is a skill that takes away everything accumulated, the increase from capturing adventurers was higher than from killing monsters.
There, his level had also increased. Considering that typically clearing one floor would raise it by 1 or 2, this too held significant value.

The ghost muttered with a dubious tone.

[The skills you've acquired overall don't make much sense... But what's this Spiritual Essence Increase skill? Is it even a skill worth obtaining?]

The ghost was astonished at the Nullify Attack and Endurance skills, but had doubts about the Spiritual Essence Increase. It seemed like a skill of such magnitude was questionable.

Spiritual Essence Increase not only brought stat boosts but also skills.

[Basic Transcendence Skill: Werewolf] [Mana Cost: 10] [Proficiency: 0%] [Transform into a werewolf. Cannot transform yet due to insufficient special blood.]

"What kind of skill is this?"

[Didn't you see earlier? It literally transforms you into a werewolf. It's a skill with drawbacks and advantages, but you can't use it right now, right?]

"Yeah, seems like it."

There was an explanation about lacking special blood. Even though he tried to use it as a test, it didn't activate as if blocked.

[It's a transcendent skill, requiring the blood of noble lineage. You can't obtain it immediately. You'll have to descend a bit to be able to use it.]

"What a waste."
Since it was the first time encountering the skill, there was interest in what effects it might have. Accordingly, there was anticipation about obtaining other skills as well.

Taesan regained his appetite and began confirming the rewards on the 13th floor, which he hadn't checked before Aldoata appeared.

There was a sharp little blade on the outside of the ring, making it a ring that could be used as a kind of gauntlet.

[Ring of Severance] [Attack Power +5] [Craftsmen believed that wearing ten of these rings would produce an effect similar to a gauntlet. In that case, it would be better to wear a gauntlet.]

As mentioned in the description, it was poorly made equipment, but it was perfect for Taesan, who had the Irock technique.

He wore all ten rings on his fingers, excluding the ring with an attack power of 1.

And then, a secret reward.

[You used ???] [Received one dust of blessing.]

"Oh?"

Dust of blessing. An item that makes subtle probabilities certain.

It was more valuable than mediocre equipment. Taesan happily stashed it in his inventory.

Now, onwards to the 14th floor.

This time, he won't go to Lillis. Except for the materials in the zombie room, he didn't get much else.
[Quest on the 14th floor begins.] [Defeat the boss on the 14th floor and proceed.] [Reward: Ankle Guards of the Valley.] [Secret Reward: ???]

"Hello."

Taesan greeted the dwarf who was waiting at the entrance of the floor, as usual. The dwarf looked at him intently and spoke.

"Did you meet them?"

"Yes."

"How did it go?"

"It's taken care of."

The dwarf smiled at Taesan's composed response.

"Good job. Just kill those useless bastards."

"I'll handle it."

Taesan replied bluntly and asked.

"Are you still considering it?"

It was an implicit question about the quest to substitute for penalty play. The dwarf stroked his chin thoughtfully.

"I'm thinking about it, but... I'm still adjusting. I'll propose something around the next floor."

"I see."

If that's the case, he just needs to clear it quickly and come back. Taesan descended to the 14th floor.

* * *

The youth says,

"He's dead?"

"Huh?"

Adventurers from the 2nd tier who were waiting leisurely were surprised.

"Who died?"

"It's Aldoata. His light went out."

The youth responsible for managing the 2nd tier receives a gem that allows him to confirm each adventurer's survival status.
The youth looked at the jewel with flickering eyes. The dazzling light that had been burning brightly suddenly disappeared, turning into a mere stone.

"Looks like he let his guard down."

They agreed at someone's remark. The youth muttered with a mysterious expression.

"â€¦Did he really?"

"He's too quick, isn't he? That fool must have died without even transforming."

If Aldoata didn't transform into a werewolf, he was considered the weakest among them. They thought he fought on the 13th floor without even transforming, feeling complacent.

The speed at which the light in the jewel went out made them lean towards that thought. In a normal battle, even if it was them, they couldn't win so quickly, so they couldn't help but think that Aldoata, who was unparalleled in arrogance, had let his guard down.

"Alright! Then it's my turn next!"

The man who had one less number than Aldoata clenched his fist. He wore a black robe grandly and smiled confidently, preparing himself.

"Tsk. He won't come to me."

"I guess I'll die this time."

Everyone who knew the power of the man in the robe grumbled, giving up hope. The youth cautiously spoke.

"Don't let your guard down. He's the one who defeated Rebevas and Aldoata."

"Have you forgotten who I am?"
The man laughs, his robe fluttering.

"I am one who walks the path of magic. I do not let my guard down."

---

"Are you the arrogant bastard who killed Aldoata and Rebevas?"

The man in the robe speaks. Taesan doesn't answer and charges forward.

[Taesan activates Acceleration.] [Deals 54 damage to Joseph.]

"Urgh!"

Joseph, with a pierced chest, vomits blood in an instant. He hastily staggers back, mouth agape in disbelief.

"You madman. Attacking out of the blue like this..."

"Why bother talking?"

They're just going to kill each other anyway.

"Take this!"

Joseph brandishes his staff amidst the onslaught.

[Joseph activates Confusion.] [No need for a roll! Taesan shakes it off with indomitable mental strength.]

"Hmph, what a..."

Thunk.

As he thrusts the sword in, he thinks,

"This time, it's a mage."

Robes and a staff. Clearly the equipment of a mage to anyone.

Since Taesan offers no resistance to the confusion, Joseph, thrown off balance, continues to receive blows while trying to knock away the staff.
Joseph, belatedly regaining his senses, grits his teeth.

"Eeek!"

[Joseph activates Magic Shield.]

A white barrier surrounds Joseph. When Taesan's sword clashes against it, a strong recoil occurs.

"Oh?"

It's a type of magic he hasn't seen before. For the first time, Taesan's face shows interest.

"Has creating this opening borne fruit?"

At that moment, he could have continued to strike without stopping until death. However, deliberately creating an opening to gain what he could obtain.

Joseph shakes his staff roughly with a hardened expression.

[Joseph activates Madness.] [No need for a roll! Taesan shakes it off with indomitable mental strength.]

"This is insane."

Joseph grits his teeth. What's that. He used only mental strength to fend off mental attacks. It's unheard of.

"It's not just luck that got him through."

Joseph eyes Taesan seriously. Rebevas and Aldoata may have lost. He may have low defense as a mage. But taking damage for 50. He's not someone who can be ignored.

[Joseph activated the spread of the bean.]
Ice pellets bounce roughly and scatter outwards. It's a magic intended to restrict movement.

[Joseph activates Frost Arrows.] [Taesan activates Frost Arrows.]

"What!"

Joseph, who claimed he wouldn't be shaken, raised his voice. Two cold arrows collide, and the shattered one turns out to be Joseph's arrow. Taesan's arrow explodes as it clashes with Joseph's magic shield.

"What is this!"

Magic! And not just basic magic, but novice-level Frost Arrows!

To make matters worse, his own magic was defeated. It meant the opponent's skill was superior.

"Impossible!"

Who was he? Even in the tall and high towers of magic, he heard rumors of being recognized as a genius once every ten years.

Though he was only allowed to be in the second rank here, it wasn't because he lacked talent, but because the god of magic didn't come down to him.

However, contrary to his expectations, Joseph's talent as judged by the headquarters was exactly second rank. His talent at that level wasn't considered remarkable here, but Joseph didn't know that.
However, the young child before him, who had only recently entered the labyrinth, was more skilled than himself? Talented in magic?

"This can't be!"

Joseph firmly denied it, his face contorting.

In reality, it was Taesan who had boosted his skill points, but Joseph, unaware of this, felt as if his world was crumbling in shock.

[Joseph activates Lightning Strike.]

Kwoong!

Lightning strikes Taesan. Moving at the speed of light, it's unavoidable and hits directly.

"Yes!"

Joseph grins. A competent wizard would anticipate and counter such magical implementations, but Taesan failed to do so.

He thought it was pure luck that his magic had succeeded.

[Taesan's first attack nullification is activated.] [0 damage to Taesan.]

"What?"

He blurts out unknowingly. Confusion fills Joseph's eyes.

"...Attack nullification?"

"Is there such magic? Amazing."

Instant magic. Unlike Frost Arrows or Flame Bursts, it's unavoidable. Taesan wields his sword with a pleased expression.

"Let's continue."

* * *
Joseph threw himself into the battle with desperation. Clinging to his faltering focus, he unleashed his magic.

Initially, Taesan was pushed back in the battle. Joseph's magic was diverse and efficient, having spent a lifetime honing his skills. For Taesan, who was encountering such magic for the first time, it was difficult to respond.

However, Taesan possessed stats, experience, and skills. As the battle continued, he learned how to counter each spell, pushing back relentlessly. Eventually, Taesan's sword shattered Joseph's magical shield.

"Thanks to you."

Thanks to him, Joseph had learned a little more about using magic. Joseph let out a bitter laugh.

"No way..."

The sword pierced through Joseph.

* * *

"...He's dead?"

"Huh?"

"Again?"

Everyone in the second-tier was bewildered. Aldoarta and Joseph's defeat felt different.

Joseph was a master of magic. They had assumed they would easily win since the others here couldn't handle his diverse magic.

"...Could it be that we were too complacent?"

"If he didn't use his magic properly, it's possible. Come to think of it, there are ghosts too, right? If they helped from the sidelines, it wouldn't be impossible."
However, they still didn't take it seriously. There was quite a difference between the 13th floor and the 20th floor.

"Next is me!"

A young boy, who still looked quite young, clenched his fists tightly. With strong resolve, he faced everyone.

"I'll be back!"

The boy smiled and left.

An hour later, a young man spoke up.

"Is he dead?"

"......"

"Again?"

They hesitated. Next in line, a middle-aged man chuckled and gripped his sword.

"I didn't expect it to come to me. Let's wrap this up quickly."

The middle-aged man departed. With experience as a man who had conquered the mercenary world with just one sword, he seemed more experienced than anyone else here. Everyone thought victory was assured.

Forty minutes later, the young man spoke again.

"... Again."

"Uh..."

"Ugh, hmm."

They were confused. The next challenger, a hesitant woman, waved her hand.

"I'll... be back?"

Then, thirty minutes later, the young man grimaced.

Without saying a word, they all realized what had happened.

"... Next is me. Do I really need to go alone?"

"... Maybe?"
"Sure. It's just the 13th floor, but it's getting serious. Let's stick together and go."

They said it nonchalantly, but their eyes betrayed hesitation and fear.

In the end, they decided to band together and go up as five. As they departed, their faces held both anxiety and confidence.

Everyone thought it was over now. There were five of them, after all. Five adventurers of the 20th floor. They couldn't possibly fail.

Two hours later.

The young man spoke.

"... They're all dead."

The jewels lost their luster. A quiet silence lingered among them.
