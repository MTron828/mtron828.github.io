107. 21st Floor. The Insane Spirit (3)

[Are you going to accept it?]

Taesan tilted his head. There was no reason to refuse the quest.

Moreover, it was a quest that no one else had received. For a normal adventurer, that means the possibility of a substantial reward despite the difficulty.

[Hehe! Great!]

The white spirit burst into laughter.

[I'm going to become stronger! I'll kill them and make them mine to become complete!]

"Well then, how do we do this? Start explaining."

[It requires many steps!]

The spirit chuckled.

[I am very unstable! So we need to make it safe first! Then make me complete, and then gather strength!]

The spirit raised its arm roughly.

[So first of all, bring the owner of the 21st floor! Kill that guy and bring the core!]

"Got it."

The first quest naturally cleared as Taesan advanced through the labyrinth. He promptly left the room. The spirit continued to burst into laughter behind him.

[I will have my revenge!]
Ignoring the voices filled with madness and hatred, Taesan stepped outside.

The ghost muttered in surprise.

"So, capturing the golem was an additional condition for the quest... It's something that wouldn't normally be obtained. Why would they create such a thing?"

The golem's core belonged to the spirit, making it impenetrable, and its toughness and speed made it impossible to handle without surpassing stats from the 21st to the 30th floor.

Taesan was beyond the specifications and, objectively speaking, it was a quest that couldn't be accepted from the start.

"Maybe they hoped for that level."

Adventurers wanted the same level as Taesan, so the gods could have settled here.

The spirit fell silent at that.

"That's... quite a scary thing to say."

"It was impossible from the start."

Even the highly praised spirit in the maze couldn't help but admire Taesan. It was nearly impossible for many to reach his level.

A spirit appeared in front of Taesan.

Taesan swung his sword.

With an afterimage, the spirit was torn to shreds.
He couldn't defeat the spirit because his attacks were ineffective, not because his stats were insufficient. Without a moment's hesitation, he broke through to find an empty room at the end.

"You activated reconnaissance."

In Taesan's view, one brick was emphasized.

Taesan pressed the brick, and a secret room opened.

"It's so convenient to have reconnaissance."

With the ability to trigger premonitions, there was no reason to painstakingly search for secret rooms. Taesan entered the secret room, disabled the traps, and obtained his reward.

"You obtained the Lightning Staff." "[Lightning Staff] [A staff used by intermediate magicians. Can cast the basic spell [Lightning].]"

It had been a while since he'd had a staff. Unlike the Fire Staff, this one featured intermediate magic rather than basic.

He immediately triggered magic extraction and acquired it.

"You have learned the basic spell [Lightning]." "[Basic Spell: Lightning] [Mana Cost: 6] [Proficiency: 1%] [Strikes lightning above the target's head. This attack cannot be dodged unless faster than lightning. Deals greater damage to non-immune enemies. Attempts to inflict [Electrocution] status on the target.]"

The Guide of Sin. It was the magic Joseph used against him.
Due to the nullification of attacks, there was no effect whatsoever, but because it was immediate, it was quite tricky.

Since he wanted to test it out, he moved to another room and used it towards the spirit.

"[You activated Lightning.][75 damage to the intermediate fire spirit of the labyrinth.]"

"The damage is a bit low."

Perhaps because it was immediate, the damage was certainly less compared to the blazing arrows and frost arrows. However, there was sufficient merit in it being magic that couldn't be dodged once it moved.

Taesan headed towards the boss room on the 21st floor.

"[An intermediate fire spirit of the labyrinth has appeared.]"

It wasn't lower but intermediate. As such, it was larger and had a darker flame color.

The spirit scattered sparks towards Taesan. The sparks fluttered around the room like snowflakes.

"[You activated Frost Arrows.]"

Extreme cold scattered. Thanks to that, the sparks lost some of their power. Taesan rushed straight at the intermediate spirit. Despite being hit all over by sparks, the damage was relatively minimal, perhaps because he had surrounded himself with frost arrows.

Taesan manifested Aura.

"[176 damage to the intermediate fire spirit of the labyrinth.]"

The intermediate spirit resisted. It created a firewall, blocked attacks, and tried to push Taesan away. Taesan dismantled it one by one and attacked the spirit, and soon was able to defeat it.

"[Your level has increased.]" "[Your Enlightenment Rise has been activated. Permanent increases: Strength +15, Agility +11, Intelligence +5, Stamina +55.]" "[Acquired Flame Ember.]" "[Acquired Core of the Intermediate Fire Spirit of the Labyrinth.]"

"So this is the level on the 21st floor."

It was simpler than expected.

Even though he was already strong, crossing the Vergasetta increased his stats, so it was only natural, but he couldn't help but feel bored.

In the end, all he could expect were trials from the gods, named monsters, and guides to wickedness.

Feeling regretful, he opened the stats window. It was said that his magic increased every time he killed an enemy or leveled up. He was curious about how much it had increased.

[강태산] [Level: 49] [Shield: 251/251] [Health: 2850/2850] [Mana: 551/551] [Magic: 27/27] [Strength: 984] [Intelligence: 643] [Agility: 821] [Attack +93] [Defense +115] [The target is in optimal condition.]

Magic increased by 10.
Level 4 increased and cleaned up one room, and defeated a golem, but received 10. It was hard to tell whether it was high or low.

He would probably find out when he met other demons. Taesan confirmed the 21st floor clear reward.

[Spirit Jewel] [A bead imbued with spirit energy. It seems useful when visiting a blacksmith.] [Flame Ember] [Ember of fire. When commissioned to a blacksmith, it can impart fire properties to weapons.]

It seemed that rewards related to refining began to be given gradually after meeting the blacksmith.

[Core of the Intermediate Fire Spirit of the Labyrinth] [Spirit's core. It seems that absorbing it will provide stability to someone unstable.]

This seemed to be an item for a spirit quest. And there was a secret reward left.

[Used ???] [Obtained Skill Proficiency Increase Potion.]

"Ooh."

It was a skill proficiency increase potion after a long time. A potion that raises skill proficiency by 5%. Considering what Rilise said about cutting fingers even at 1 or 2% skill proficiency, it had tremendous value.

Taesan gathered everything and took it back to the spirit who had gone crazy again.

"Here you go."

[Hehe! Great! Of course, you're the best!]
The spirit destroyed the lair and tore apart the spirit's core, letting out a wave of power akin to a scream.

[Hehehe!]

The white spirit harnessed the power bursting forth from the lair. When the waves subsided, a considerable amount of strength surged within the white spirit.

[First quest of the deranged spirit completed.] [Thanks! Next is the 23rd floor! Fourth directly ahead, and fifth to the right! There's a hidden room there! Defeat its owner and return!]

Taesan, who received the next quest, left the room.

Upon reaching the 20th floor, there was a blacksmith named Hafran. Hafran said he would move every five floors, and he kept his word.

"Can these be refined?"

Taesan handed over the ore guarding the core, the flame ember, and the spirit jewel. Hafran glanced briefly at the spirit jewel and flame ember.

"You brought these?"

The spirit jewel and flame ember didn't seem to surprise him much, probably because they were basic clear rewards. However, his eyes widened when he saw the ore guarding the core.

"What's this?"

"Obtained from a golem said to be created by the Spirit King. Can you make something out of it?"
"Golem... the one guarding the Spring of Green? We could defeat it?"

Hafran, marveling, nodded his head.

"I can make it. Can you explain?"

"Thank you if you do."

"The Flame Ember literally imbues weapons with fire attributes. It increases attack power and allows for burn damage upon attack. There are no particular downsides."

"Like Marnius's Rune Enhancement Plate?"

"It feels like that. The Spirit Jewel, if used as a material for your equipment, grants resistance and benefits against specific attributes. And this..."

Hafran hesitated as he held the ore guarding the core with an uncertain expression.

"I'm not sure either. I think I'll have to make it to know."

"Then please make it."

Equipment crafting. That was his specialty. Hafran stroked his chin.

"Normally, I'd charge for materials... but since this is my first time handling it too, I'll make it free of charge. Should I include this?"

"As you wish? You can use it now or later."

The Spirit Jewel. A precious material indeed, but not necessarily vital to the extent. Taesan aimed for the equipment sold by the shop owner, so there was a good chance he would discard it after use.
"Then craft it in the form of armor. It should be quite an enjoyable time."

Hafran gathered the ore and Spirit Jewel with a pleased expression. Taesan tapped his shoulder as he gripped the hammer.

"But first, handle this."

"Ah, the Flame Ember? Alright. Hand me the weapon, it'll be done soon."

Taesan handed over Cabert's artifact. True to his word, ten minutes later Hafran returned with the sword.

"Oh?!"

The spirit showed interest. A faint red aura enveloped the blade.

"Cabert's Artifact: Sword imbued with Ancestor's Blood" "Artifact from a lost world. Claimed countless lives of nobles." "Attack +40" "Attack +15 against all enemies" "Fire attribute imbued"

The attack power had increased by 10, and it now had a fire attribute.

The improvement was remarkable. Taesan, who had expected at most a minor increase of 2 or 3, was astonished.

"Is this...?"

"It seems it was originally designed this way, and it complements the sword perfectly. It yielded the best efficiency."
"My sword from my world is a cursed blade. It was always a magical sword from the beginning. However, over the course of many years, its magic has faded away."

It seemed that the Flame Ember had filled that void.

Taesan gratefully accepted the weapon.

"Thank you."

"We're in a mutual helping relationship. It's settled then. Come back later. Give me a rough summary."

Hafran lifted his hammer and headed towards the anvil.

Taesan left him behind and descended back into the labyrinth. Now, he was on the 22nd floor.

[22nd Floor Quest Begins.] [Defeat the boss of the 22nd floor and proceed.] [Reward: Mark of Dark Shadows] [Secret Reward: ???]

Taesan began his breakthrough of the labyrinth. The monsters on the 22nd floor were lesser ice spirits of the labyrinth. They were marginally stronger, though whether there was a significant difference between fire and ice, he wasn't sure.

Since the difference wasn't significant, he dealt with them roughly and moved forward. The quest for the deranged spirits was on the 23rd floor, so there was nothing particularly urgent on the 22nd floor.

Then, midway through the breakthrough, he discovered an altar of the gods.

"You have discovered the Altar of Pafsha."
