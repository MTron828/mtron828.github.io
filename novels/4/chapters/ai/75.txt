76. 13th Floor, Guide of Sin (3)

Lebevas' eyes wavered. He, who had been contemplating, tightly closed his eyes.

"Just promise me one thing."

"What is it?"

"Kill me."

Lebevas spoke as if exhausted.

"Just don't do anything else, just kill me purely. Then I'll give you a proper answer."

"Sure."

Taesan nodded. There was no reason to do anything else. Lebevas, who briefly smiled bitterly, spoke up.

"That's probably how it'll be. To them, we may be nothing but dust, but we're still part of the Guide of Sin. They won't hesitate to leave those who violate their rules alone."

"Indeed."

Taesan knew that beyond the norms, those who cleared the 10th floor could never defeat those who cleared the 20th floor. Even if their numbers increased, it wouldn't change much.

The leadership had no reason to be interested in adventurers on the 20th floor.

But they wouldn't just let those who disrupt their order go unnoticed.

"They... despise us."
Lebevas murmured with an emotional voice.

"They classify ranks based on the floors they reside in as an absolute standard. Up to the 20th floor is second rank. Up to the 30th floor is third rank, like that. Since they see each rank as an absolute rule, it's not easy to ascend. If they do, they think their dignity will decline. It's even worse for adventurers in deeper places."

"You're playing around."

Taesan scoffed. Dignity declining. He never imagined such words would come up here.

"It was like that before too. It turned around based on a few strong guys. It's a squeaky group, but no one betrays. If they do, they just kill them."

"Do you know about Einzhar?"

"You mean those who seek the god?"

"Who else would there be?"

"..."

Lebevas spoke up.

"We don't intervene with those bound within the labyrinth. They are irregular beings."

"You're saying it depends on strength."

Lebevas smirked bitterly.

"I got the gist of what I wanted to know."

If they kill these people, the ones below will come up to catch him.

"I should prepare a response."
There was no way out.

"Even if they're not them, there are plenty of adventurers in the second rank. No matter who you are..."

"I have no interest in them."

Lethargic words.

There was a strong sense of confidence. He also possessed strength befitting that.

Lebevas looked up at Taesan with disappointment.

He had been like that too. When he first set foot in the labyrinth, when he had just cleared the 5th floor, he thought he was the strongest and that no one could stop him. He believed without doubt that he would clear the labyrinth.

But he was broken. Faced with despair, he sank into hesitation.

And like this, he met a death in a way he had never imagined back then.

"If only I had refused the offer back then..."

Even if he had fought to the end, if he had died believing in himself at that time, wouldn't that have been better?

"Well then, farewell."

A sharp sensation pierced his heart. Lebevas smirked bitterly.

It's all in the past now. Regret holds no meaning.

Finally, Lebevas accepted his fate.

"Hmm?"
Taesan blinked his eyes. Something from the dying Lebevas' body entered Taesan.

Whether it was his soul or accumulated power, Taesan absorbed it.

[Your Soul Surge has been activated. Strength permanently increases by 23. Agility permanently increases by 20. Intelligence permanently increases by 18. Stamina permanently increases by 70. Mana permanently increases by 40.] [Your Soul Surge has been activated. Proficiency in Power Strike increases by 8%.]

Soul Surge. It was similar to before, but the amount of increase was incomparable.

[Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [Acquired the Gauntlet of Might.]

[Gang Taesan [Alone]: How far did you two go?] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: We cleared the 3rd floor. Now we're entering the 4th floor and exploring little by little. Junhyuk is doing the same.] [Gang Taesan [Alone]: Is everything okay?] [Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: Yes. Thanks to the points, there haven't been any major issues.]

Not only Taesan but also other players had gained various points, large and small, since returning to Earth.
Taeyeon and Junhyuk performed quite well, so they must have received decent points. Upon returning, Taesan advised them to use the points on their stats, and they followed his advice. Thanks to this, their stats increased significantly.

The 3rd floor was also helpful in that there wasn't anything particularly unusual about it. Although there was a hidden boss room, Taesan instructed them not to enter even if they found it, so they were able to clear it without major issues.

[Gang Taesan [Alone]: How are the other modes?] [Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: Well, Easy Mode is, hmm, pretty quiet. Judging from the occasional stories I hear, it seems everyone is struggling.]

Easy Mode was suppressed and constrained in various ways by Choi Junhyuk. With his disappearance, considerable freedom emerged.

However, at the same time, the mode where the most people died was Easy Mode.

In Easy Mode, they were not accustomed to death as long as they were cautious enough not to easily die. Since the return to Earth, the number of people has noticeably decreased, so the atmosphere will calm down for the time being.

But there was no other choice. They had to get used to death as well.

[Gang Taesan [Alone]: What about Normal Mode?] [Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: There wasn't much difference there, really. If anything, people have become more cautious.]
Normal mode was the most subtle place. It wasn't weak, but it wasn't strong either. Therefore, there was a tendency to be swept away.

[Gang Taesan [Alone]: How about Hard Mode?] [Kim Jungeun [Hard]: Let me tell you about that.]

Jungeun interjected.

[Gang Taesan [Alone]: You survived?] [Kim Jungeun [Hard]: I'm alive because I couldn't die. How about you, hyung?] [Gang Taesan [Alone]: I'm the same as always.]

After a brief conversation, Jungeun began to explain.

[Kim Jungeun [Hard]: Not many of us have died. Those who were in the labyrinth without going down, mostly on the 1st and 2nd floors, and those who were determined survived.] [Gang Taesan [Alone]: That makes sense.]

Just like in Alone mode, surviving in Hard Mode isn't just about talent. You need to know your limits and whether it's safe to proceed.

On Earth, the monsters were strong, but most players in Hard Mode survived because they honed their bodies.

[Kim Jungeun [Hard]: Because of you, hyung and Taeyeon, Junhyuk, we've become quite serious too.]

Players in Hard Mode considered themselves the strongest.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"EZ and Normal Mode were exceptions from the start, and I believed Alone Mode was partly false, even if it was true, because I thought I couldn't go deep due to its difficulty.

But Taesan was a monster.

Itaeyeon and Kang Junhyuk were also at a level similar to or slightly stronger than the likes of Kim Hwiyeon and Geum Joonggeun, causing the subtle confidence that had existed to crumble.

[Geum Joonggeun [Hard]: I've been talking about this and that to other Hard Mode players. Maybe we'll be much stronger when we meet next time?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: That would be good.]

Taesan can't save everyone. Just like this time, when all four directions were blocked, situations where each individual has to overcome continue to arise.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Don't die. See you again next time.] [Geum Joonggeun [Hard]: Okay.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Oh, hyung. I have something to tell you.]

After the conversation settled down, Kang Junhyuk, who had been quiet, spoke.

[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: When I entered the 4th floor, there was an altar of the gods.] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: The altar of victory?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: It said 'Valtaja' there, that's the altar of victory?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: Right. There was one on the 4th floor, wasn't there?]
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

The moment they entered the 4th floor, an altar greeted them. The altar of the god of victory. Valtaja's altar.

[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Can I take it?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: Have you seriously thought about it?]

Taesan asked.

Junhyuk was confident. He wanted to try anything and believed he would survive. So Taesan had briefly trained him when they met on Earth.

[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Yes. I've thought about it seriously. Considering who I am now and decided. I think it'll work out.]

At his serious words, Taesan stroked his chin.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Itaeyeon would probably refuse even if offered, but you're proactive.] [Itaeyeon [Alone]: I'll give it a try too.]

Taesan was genuinely surprised by Itaeyeon's words.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: You would do it too?] [Itaeyeon [Alone]: Like you said, I can't keep being a coward forever.]

Like Junhyuk, Itaeyeon's words were serious. Taesan's expression also turned serious.

"Is it because of me?"

Junhyuk might not know, but Itaeyeon had run away from trials altogether. The only reason he would suddenly accept would be because of what Taesan had said on Earth.

Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: It should be possible. But I don't really know either. What I received is different from what you all got.]

His trial was one enhanced directly by the god of victory. If one were to think that its difficulty was similar to the trials before Rakiratas enhanced them, and since Itaeyeon and Kang Junhyuk had also raised their stats as points, it wasn't impossible.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: I can't stop you from making a serious judgment yourselves. Go ahead. Don't die, though.] [Itaeyeon [Alone]: Yes. I suppose I should get ready.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: We'll see if I survive.]

Taesan closed the community window and asked.

"You've received trials from the god of victory too, right?"

[I did. It was a long time ago though.]

"How did it compare to Rakiratas?"

[Uh... It was easier than that. It was manageable.]

Easier than Rakiratas. This meant there was a good chance of clearing it with Itaeyeon and Kang Junhyuk's level. Both of them had that kind of talent.

"I hope you don't die."

It could be seen as him pushing them in a way. Even if others didn't know, those two held a considerable meaning to Taesan.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

However, if he didn't take on challenges like this, it would only get harder later on, so he had to do it now.

The die had been cast; now all that was left was to wait.

"Well then."

Suddenly, he received a message and stopped to check. Taesan confirmed the equipment he received.

[Gauntlet of Power] [Attack Power +18] [A gauntlet worn by the strong.] [The next attack deals five times the basic attack damage. This skill can only be used once a month.]

It was good equipment. Taesan was moved because until now, he had obtained equipment that didn't match his level, but this was different. For a normal adventurer, this would be an ecstatic moment.

Originally, such equipment could only be obtained on the 13th to 20th floors, so its value was significant.

Taesan opened his status window.

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 30] [Shield: 97/97] [Health: 1300/1300] [Mana: 332/332] [Strength: 462] [Intelligence: 287] [Agility: 395] [Attack Power +65] [Defense +54] [In prime condition.]

He was approaching level 500 slowly. He had defeated Rebevas, which increased his level by 2 and significantly raised his abilities.

Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

The moment Taesan defeated Rebevas, something was absorbed from the adventurer. It seemed like the enhancement absorbed his strength. It was a sensation he had never felt before.

"Seems like it works properly against fellow adventurers."

The enhancement was a skill with many unknowns. He could only roughly infer its effects.

"You've slain Rebevas. Though you're at the lowest echelon, you're part of the guide to the path of wickedness."

The ghost spoke calmly.

"It won't be long before there's movement. Maybe not the arrogant ones, but those nearby will stir."

Adventurers like Rebevas.

Taesan said solemnly,

"Bring it on."
