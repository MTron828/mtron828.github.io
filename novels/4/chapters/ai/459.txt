**Chapter 460**

460. The Seventh Return, Earth (12)

Taesan examined his own body.

Something invisible, like a film, was wrapped around Taesan.

The power contained within was not of this world.

It was God's power.

"What is this?" Beldentia asked with a bewildered expression.

"Is it not just a simple power or concept of strength? What kind of power did you obtain?"

"God's authority," Taesan explained roughly. Beldentia's pupils widened as she listened to the story, and then a hollow laugh burst out.

"Are you saying it's a denial of the laws themselves? What nonsense..."

It was not something that could be easily accepted.

"So, does that mean no one can interfere with you now?"

Even if they were transcenders, their powers were based on the laws of the world. But Taesan shook his head.

"It's not that level. The limits are clear."

It would be like that if God handled it directly. God would intervene in everything, including death, life, and authority, and would even distort and destroy the laws of the labyrinth.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, that power was exhausted during the process of stealing the Taesan's strength. The only way to stop it was to directly intervene with the law that targeted Taesan.

And every time the law was stopped, the self-immutable was consumed.

When Diana's fatal blow was blocked, the self-immutable wrapped around her body was consumed. Although it was recovering, the speed was extremely slow.

"Doesn't it seem like it's decreasing?"

"That's because the gap between you and me is huge."

The current Taesan was a transcendent being.

Even if Diana was strong, she was only at the boundary level. The difference in power was overwhelming, so the consumption value was minimal.

To block an attack from an equal or superior opponent, a large amount of self-immutable would be consumed. Beldentia, who had heard the explanation, stroked her chin.

"Still, it's an absurd power. To affect you, you need to break the self-immutable that wraps around you first, right? Until then, you won't receive any influence or intervention."

"That's right."

Although there were limitations, it was an extremely powerful skill.

No being in this world could escape the concept of law. To exert any influence on Taesan, one had to overcome the wall of self-immutable.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And self-nullification is the authority of the gods. It doesn't belong to the laws of this world. Even the opposing side couldn't easily understand it.

Now, the phenomenon of attack invalidation has also disappeared.

'Is this the authority of the gods?'

This is also infinitely degraded compared to what the gods had.

I'm curious about what kind of authority other gods possess. Beldegkia let out a dry laugh.

"A being with the authority of the gods? I've never heard of it before."

Next, I need to check the changes in Bardley and Akasha.

The two evolve and change every time they defeat an enemy. Since they defeated the god's fragment, Taesan expected a huge change.

[The Prince of the Destroyed World: Bardley] [The Prince of the Destroyed World's Empire, Cabert's Prince, Bardley. He was reborn with a sword as his physical body.] [Attack Power +2854]

However, contrary to his expectations, there was no significant change.

Although his attack power increased to a high level, it wasn't a remarkable number considering they defeated the god's fragment. Bardley said,

"Maybe it's because I'm a god? You're a being beyond the laws, so you can obtain power without any issues. I'm not like that."

"Is that so?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Godhood is unchanging. Its power neither increases nor decreases. Only the Taesan could forcibly seize it by using the boundary and spiritual ascension. Bardley was not included.

What about Akasha?"

[I don't know either. It's still unclear, like a fog that can't be lifted. Something seems to be coming to mind, but... it's hard for now.]

"Take your time."

[Yes, thank you, Master.]

The reward obtained was roughly confirmed.

But it still wasn't over.

Taesan closed his eyes and observed himself.

He had become a god of the earth.

On earth, he was a transcendent being.

What could he do as a transcendent being, and what kind of influence could he exert?

He read and observed himself, grasping his newly acquired powers and abilities.

"Ah."

His voice echoed. Taesan realized something and opened his eyes.

"......It's only natural when you think about it."

Taesan burst out laughing.

He had become a transcendent being now.

Then, it was only natural that he could use the abilities that only transcendent beings had possessed until now.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan stood up from his seat. His body transcended space.

* * *

Only a week was left until they returned to the labyrinth.

During that time, people danced, sang, and rejoiced.

"For Taesan!"

People shouted the names of those who had saved them.

The most frequently called name was, of course, Taesan.

Every person on Earth worshiped Taesan, offering prayers and praises to him. A singer even composed a song dedicated to Taesan.

"For Diana!"

And the next most frequently called name was Diana.

She had defeated numerous S-grade monsters alone, earning her the right to be praised by people. Beldegencia also received praise from people for similar reasons.

"For Lee Taeyun!"

Of course, Lee Taeyun was also included among those being praised.

Lee Taeyun was the second strongest person on Earth after Taesan.

He had fought against S-grade monsters and saved many people, making him worthy of praise.

And among them...

No one called out Amelia's name.

Amelia wore a bitter smile amidst the crowd.

"Huh."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She let out a sigh and slipped away from the crowd. Those who saw her smiled brightly and expressed their gratitude to her.

"Ah, Amelia! Thank you so much! We were able to survive thanks to you!"

"No, it's nothing. It's just something anyone would do."

She spoke casually and slipped away from the crowd, heading towards a quiet place.

She wasn't forgotten. She still had the trust and faith of the people.

But she was no longer their hope.

"No, what's the point? It's only natural, anyway."

She muttered quietly to herself. She was fifth in terms of strength, a precarious position.

"......It's a bit sad."

She couldn't be the main protagonist.

The main protagonist was Taesan.

She accepted that.

But somehow, she felt depressed.

Amelia leaned her back against the wall.

"What do I want?"

Even she herself couldn't clearly understand her own emotions.

As she thought blankly, Taesan appeared in her mind.

Their first meeting hadn't been good.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Amelia, who had received the blessing of the gods and believed herself to be the strongest, didn't doubt that Taesan was weaker than her.

But the duel began.

She couldn't do anything and was defeated.

It was a crushing defeat, an absolute gap.

Amelia was captivated by that power.

To be exact, she was captivated by the existence of Taesan.

She believed that if she worked hard, she could catch up to him one day and become his equal.

I'll catch up to you.

I'll be your next.

With that mindset, she attacked the labyrinth.

But at some point, Taesan changed.

She became a completely different person, descending through the labyrinth at an incredible speed. Amelia felt a sense of crisis and accelerated her own pace, but Taesan quickly surpassed her.

As a friend, it was joyful and satisfying to see her growth, but at the same time, it was unsettling.

Catching up to Taesan is my job.

I'm his next.

But it didn't end there.

Diana and Beldegia appeared, two people who were clearly stronger than her.

Her strength, which had seemed so great just a moment before, was suddenly not so impressive.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And the overwhelming power that Taesan showed this time.

The thought of catching up to Taesan disappeared from my mind.

And another emotion that even she didn't know filled that space.

'Is it jealousy?'

Was it jealousy towards their strength? No, it wasn't. I was grateful that many people were able to survive thanks to them, and I had never felt jealous.

'...Did I want to be worshipped by people?'

I used to think that way. I wanted to be the strongest and receive everyone's admiration.

But it wasn't like that anymore. While people's indifference was a bit disappointing, it didn't make me sad. The reason for my sadness was different.

'...Taesan and Taeyeon often talk to each other alone.'

I knew that the reason for Taeyeon's change was related to Taesan. But he didn't say a word to me about it.

Diana and Beldencia were the same. Taesan didn't tell her any detailed stories about the two.

That made Amelia a bit resentful.

'...Ah?'

She suddenly spoke up.

She realized the reason for her sadness.

To her, Taesan was a god."

Note: The translation tries to maintain the original tone and nuance of the text, but some phrases may sound a bit awkward in English due to the differences in language structure and cultural context.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He was an overwhelming strongman and a leader who led everyone.

She wanted to be recognized by him.

You're strong, aren't you?

If it's you, I can trust and leave it to you.

She wanted to earn his trust and hear his secrets directly.

Amelia's face turned red.

"What, what is this?"

It was like a child's desire for recognition. She didn't want to acknowledge her own emotions. She tried to shake off the thought that had risen, but it wouldn't easily disappear.

Thinking back, she had wanted to be valued by someone from the beginning.

She had also been deceived by the God of Decline because he had recognized her.

It was just that now, it had become Taesan.

Once she realized her emotions, they wouldn't stop. Thoughts flooded her mind constantly.

She also wanted to share secrets with Taesan.

She wanted to hear Taesan say that she could trust him.

She wanted to fight alongside him, back to back, with their lives on the line.

She slumped down.

"Is that all I wanted? It's really embarrassing."

"What is it?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She was startled and jumped up.

Before she knew it, Taesan was standing beside her.

"Taesan? What's going on here?"

"I have business with you."

"......with me?"

Not with Lee Taeyun or Diana, but with herself.

Amelia's mood improved just with that. Her depressed emotions disappeared without a trace. She spoke cheerfully.

"What is it? Tell me."

Taesan looked at her for a moment before speaking.

"You, do you want to become my apostle?"

* * *

At Taesan's words, Amelia's face stiffened.

"Apostle of God...... are you serious?"

Taesan nodded.

Apostle.

She also knew what that meant.

"I have become a god."

It wasn't perfect, but Taesan was a transcendent being now.

And a transcendent being could create their own apostle.

"Your soul will belong to me. In return, I can grant you my power."

Until now, Taesan had been offered apostle contracts by other transcendent beings.

But now, he was offering an apostle contract to someone else.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Will you be my first apostle? Are you interested?"

"......Just a moment."

Amelia was confused. She needed time to sort out her thoughts after being suddenly asked to make a contract as an apostle. Taesan waited quietly.

After a little while, Amelia, who had gathered her thoughts, asked:

"How many apostles can you make?"

"You're the only one. Right now, I can only make one apostle."

Taesan, who was almost a perfect transcender, had various limitations.

Amelia bit her lip at his answer.

With a determined face, she said:

"Taesan, you should make a contract with Lee Tae-yeon or Diana, or Beldencia instead of me."

"Why?"

"Because those three are more talented than me."

They had more talent than Amelia herself.

If they became Taesan's apostles, they could maximize his power and become stronger. Even if she became Taesan's apostle, she wouldn't be able to fully utilize his abilities. That's what she thought.

"What are you talking about?"

But Taesan had a face that said she was speaking nonsense.

"You have talent, Amelia Airin."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's okay. But compared to them..."

"Your talent is not inferior to Tae-yeon's at all. In fact, you have an advantage in some aspects."

"Huh, really?"

Amelia thought she was lacking compared to Tae-yeon.

But now, Taesan was denying her thoughts.

"You're exceptional. In terms of simple talent, you're not inferior to them at all."

Thump.

Amelia's heart was racing.

Taesan was acknowledging her.

"Really... is that so?"

"Yes."

Taesan nodded his head.

"Of course."

Amelia was exceptional.

In Taesan's judgment, her talent was among the top he had seen in all humans. In fact, after escaping from the God of Fall, she had rapidly descended into the labyrinth.

But at some point, something changed.

Her speed of descending into the labyrinth slowed down, and hesitation and uncertainty appeared in her movements.

Taesan knew the reason.

"Tae-yeon's talent is doubt and caution."

It was so timid that it was almost cowardly, constantly doubting and sometimes even rejecting the correct answer.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The reason she was able to survive and become stronger was undoubtedly due to her talent. Even now that she has regained her memories from her past life, the parts that were excessive have been alleviated, but the foundation has not changed much.

"And Amelia's talent is, believing in herself."

She repeats the challenge of risking her life, and she doesn't doubt it. She believes she will win. She believes she can achieve everything she wants. And she actually achieves it.

That was her talent.

However, because she was overwhelmingly defeated by Taesan, her belief that she was the strongest was shattered.

But it was okay. Taesan was the only strong one, so she could still believe in herself and move forward.

That's when Lee Taeyeon appeared.

Lee Taeyeon was different from Taesan, and at first, she couldn't reach Amelia's level. But at some point, she changed and suddenly surpassed Amelia.

And then Diana and Beldechika appeared as well.

Cracks began to form in her belief in herself.

It was self-doubt.

She wondered if she was really exceptional, or just a little more outstanding than an ordinary person.

She was quietly crumbling, devouring her own talent and doubting herself.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even if I clear the labyrinth like this, I could have stopped at a level that's not that impressive.

Taesan never thought of leaving it like that.

'It's a good thing it turned out well.'

I was worried about how to resolve Amelia's wavering. Simple words wouldn't cut it. I had to show her directly that she had value.

And the contract with the apostle was, above all, a certain recognition.

'I don't offer a contract with the apostle to someone I don't recognize.'

Amelia's pupils trembled. Her face turned bright red.

The feeling inside was joy.

'You're exceptional. The difference is just in direction, and you're not inferior to Taeyeon and Diana at all.'

'But Taeyeon cleared the labyrinth faster than me...'

'That's because she regained her memories.'

'...Memories?'

'It's hard to explain in detail, but she used a special method. It's not that she has overwhelming talent compared to you.'

'...'

Amelia couldn't hide her joy.

Taesan was directly recognizing her.

He said she was not inferior to Taeyeon and Diana at all."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not Lee Tae-yeon, Diana, or Bel Deng Kia who proposed the contract of the apostle. It's you, Amelia."

Amelia was worshiping the gods. And she was someone who knew what an apostle was.

An apostle is the closest servant to God. They directly receive God's commands by their side, and even gods don't casually propose an apostle's contract.

It's only offered to those who are truly trustworthy, have power, or are charming.

Amelia understood the will of the gods. The shame she had until now suddenly disappeared.

"Of course, I won't force you. It's about dedicating yourself. If you don't like it, I won't..."

"No."

Amelia shook her head.

Her thoughts were neatly organized.

She smiled brightly. It was the same confident smile that the gods had shown her when they first met, believing in her own superiority.

"I like it. I'll accept it, Tae-san."
