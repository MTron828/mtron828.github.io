Chapter 465

465. The 88th Floor, Those Who Want to Become Gods (4)

Taesan continued to move.

He traveled to various cities and villages, freeing people from their mental shackles and liberating them. Paragup also tried to hinder him like Keboruak, shaking the earth, but Taesan easily resolved the issue with a light touch of his foot.

Taesan spoke to those whose mental shackles had been released, looking dazed.

"Follow me."

They followed Taesan as if mesmerized.

As they traversed the continent, some grew tired and suffered, but Taesan's divine power healed all their wounds and fatigue.

Thus, a massive group was formed.

People began to show reverence towards Taesan.

However, not everyone did so. Some were still confused and flustered, while others suspected that Taesan had some hidden agenda.

But they couldn't deny the fact that Taesan was a god.

Their thoughts began to take shape as a kind of awakening in the world.

[The proficiency of Taesan's divine power increased by 1%.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"After his divine power transformed into divinity, his proficiency level rose for the first time. At the same time, the divine power that Taesan possessed found a little stability.

"This is the feeling."

The more people who revered him as a god and thought of him, the more his divine power found stability.

As the years of faith accumulated, and the number of believers increased, he would obtain a stable divinity. As long as those who believed in him like Lebinev didn't disappear, his divinity would never decline.

Taesan continued to move. His goal was the faith of all people in this world.

He freed them from their brainwashing and led them. Of course, there were also those who fanatically believed in the immortals without being brainwashed. But no matter what Taesan said, people trampled on them.

"It's because of you!"

"You killed my parents!"

The world was covered in Taesan's color.

At some point, the battle of the immortals had stopped. People who realized this were overjoyed.

"The world is at peace!"

The endless clashes that had been ceaseless like the sound of cicadas in the summer had worn down their nerves. But now it was very quiet. Just that was enough to make people happy."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan could feel the emotions of two enormous beings.

 Astonishment.

And doubt and curiosity.

That night, Taesan used his divine power to control the earth and create a place for people to rest.

And he kept his distance from them.

When Taesan arrived at the vast plain, he opened his mouth.

"It's me."

Kiieeing!

A being with enormous power fell from the sky, trampling the earth fiercely.

He had a human body, but he was not human. His face had a sharp beak and the eyes of a bird of prey. Two pairs of wings fluttered behind him.

His body was three times larger than that of an ordinary person.

He was a Joingeon.

Thud. Thud.

The sound of footsteps was heard. A sturdy man with brown skin and a stern face approached. His bulging muscles all over his body looked more grotesque than beautiful.

And there was a particularly noticeable part.

"The Bald General."

Taesan nodded.

"Are you Keboruak, and are you Paragupe?"

Paragupe scowled.

"What business does a god from another world have here?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Get out. This is our world. Even if you're a god, you're not the god of our world. You have no right to interfere."

Their emotions were those of fierce rejection.

Taesan was ready to attack at any moment if they refused.

"It seems like you're misunderstanding something."

Taesan said calmly.

"First of all, you're not gods. You're just immortals born in this world. You can't claim ownership of the world. If you were gods, you wouldn't be able to do things like this."

There was no god in this world who was responsible for the planet. So, they could do as they pleased to destroy the world and fulfill their desires.

"You're doing the same thing for your own desires, aren't you? I'm the same."

"You're an outsider! You weren't born in this world!"

"But I'm a god. In that sense, isn't it more justifiable for me to do as I please in this world, rather than you who try to control everything according to your own will just because you were born here?"

Taesan's words, mixed with ridicule, stirred up Keboruak's emotions.

"It doesn't matter what you say. Decide. Die or retreat."

"......You're arrogant."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Paragup's eyes gleamed with a fierce light.

"You won't be able to bear the consequences of your choice."

"That's not for you to decide."

Taesan swung his hand, and a shockwave engulfed Paragup and Keboruak.

Paaaah!

Their limbs were torn apart.

No, they weren't torn apart. From the beginning, their true selves didn't come to this place.

"Next time, let's see each other's true forms, not just our avatars."

[Make me regret it!]

"Yeah, yeah."

Taesan replied lightly.

The next day, Taesan moved with the people he had awakened. No one noticed what had happened during the night.

And the place where the immortals resided was shrouded in perfect silence.

The emotion that flowed from there was only one.

Anger.

They were waiting for Taesan to come to where they were.

Of course, Taesan had no intention of going there right away.

"I'll do what I need to do and then go."

Taesan traveled the world.

He freed the people from the brainwashing of every city, and the forced faith in Keboruak and Paragup gradually disappeared.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And every time, the feeling of anger and resentment from the other side grew thicker.

“Ah…….”

“Uh, uh.”

Now, even ordinary people could feel it to some extent. But Taesan received it with joy.

As time passed, Taesan finally liberated all the cities in the world.

There were no longer any people in this world who worshiped Paragup and Keboruak.

[The proficiency of the Divine has increased by 1%.]

Some of the liberated people worshiped Taesan, while others did not. But the fact that Taesan was a god was clearly established in their minds.

That was enough.

Their faith would accumulate over time and become a power for him.

And now it was time to complete the quest.

* * *

“Uh…….”

People were stunned. Before them lay a hole the size of a continent.

It was a massive scar that would never be erased from the world, its end not fully visible.

It was the place where two immortals had fought for hundreds of years, a place that no one dared to approach and was only passed down through stories. But now, they saw it with their own eyes.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You can leave. Wait for the world to turn right."

So saying, Taesan threw his body into the hole. His body disappeared into the darkness.

People began to offer fervent prayers.

"Lord Taesan..."

"Please save us..."

Strong faith was instilled in Taesan.

Taesan landed on the bottom of the hole.

"Farewell."

Taesan gave a light greeting. Keboruak and Paragup gazed at him in silence.

[Die.]

No further words were needed. Keboruak and Paragup simultaneously unleashed their powers. Two enormous forces enveloped Taesan.

Taesan poured strength into his hand holding the sword.

Kwaaaang!

With a loud noise, the world shook.

Taesan took a step back and sneered.

"For hundreds of years, you've been trying to kill each other, and now you're combining your powers to catch me?"

"Go ahead and mock me. You're going to die here anyway."

Paragup's body began to swell. His muscles bulged, and his skeleton grew larger. In an instant, he grew to a size of several dozen meters, like a giant.

"Haaaa..."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Paragupi lets out a long, mournful cry. The earth responds to it. The ground rises up and wraps the Paragupi's entire body in a armor-like covering.

Boom!

A fist swings through the air.

Taesan unsheathes his sword and swings it down. The sound of the collision echoes, and the Paragupi's body is blown backward.

But there is no wound. The earth that wrapped around his body protected his flesh. The armor that was broken by Taesan's attack instantly returns to its original state.

The Paragupi's nickname is "The One Who Treads on the Earth". His power is to synchronize with the earth itself, wrapping his body in an absolute, infinitely recovering armor.

A majestic, new bird's cry is heard. At the same time, the sky begins to rumble. A storm accompanied by strong winds suddenly begins to brew.

Keboruak is the master of the sky. His power literally controls the sky.

Lightning and wind rush towards Taesan without hesitation. Taesan clenches his fist.

[You have activated the Great Destruction.]

A dark, all-destroying sphere is summoned into the world.

Just as the Great Destruction is about to explode and erase the storm, the Paragupi roughly stretches out his hand and grabs the Great Destruction. A massive, thunderous sound echoes from the Paragupi's hand.

"Hmm."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Paragoupe let out a small cry as it was hit by a powerful shock. But its authority was a defensive one, and it withstood the impact of the great destruction with the armor that covered its body.

And Keboruak aimed for the gap. The storm condensed into a single force and charged towards Taesan.

Kiying!

Taesan protected its physical body with its divine power. The condensed force shook Taesan's divine power violently, but it couldn't reach its physical body.

Kugugugung!

The heavens pressed down on Taesan and crushed it. Taesan defended itself and dodged the attack.

[This is! My world!]

Keboruak shouted fiercely. The heavens resonated with him. The entire range, from the ground that wasn't touched by the huge hole to the universe, was under Keboruak's control.

The sky here was Keboruak's domain.

"The land is mine."

Paragoupe declared calmly. All the land inside the hole, and even the core of the planet within it. Everything became Paragoupe's domain.

The heavens transformed into their domain.

They said they had been fighting here for hundreds of years, never once leaving this place. In the process, this place had become their domain.

'Strong.'

The two immortals who had established their domain were strong.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Although they were weaker than Ainshahar, they seemed to be at a level just below that. Moreover, their connection with each other was certain. It was as if they knew each other better than anyone else after fighting for hundreds of years.

The combined strength of those two immortals. Even Ainshahar, the strongest among immortals, would find it difficult to win against them. Keboruak shouted loudly.

[You may have reached a higher level than us, but you're not a god of this world! Your power and strength have fallen to a negligible level!]

Keboruak burst into laughter.

[You've only just become a god! You're unstable and wavering!]

Taesan didn't deny it.

It wasn't a false statement. Although he was revered as a god in this world, fundamentally, he was a god of the earth. If he wasn't on the earth, his power and strength would be significantly reduced, barely reaching the level of a transcendent being.

If he had become a transcendent being and had found stability over a long period of time, he might have been able to maintain his power even if he left the world, but that wasn't the case now.

[With your current state! You can win!]

"The body and soul of a transcendent being. If you handle them well, you can reach a higher level. Use them well."

They were confident of their victory.

Their power could even reach a transcendent being. They believed it without a doubt.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And Taesan showed them a faint smile.

'Can you defeat me?'

Kiiiiing!

Keboruak gathered his strength fiercely. It was a massive sphere that condensed all the power of the heavens. It was shot straight at Taesan.

Taesan didn't dodge or block it.

He just stretched out his hand.

Kagagagak!

The sphere was caught in Taesan's hand. Keboruak burst out laughing.

[Oh, how arrogant! I'll tear your whole body apart!]

The sphere contained Keboruak's full power. Even if he was a transcendent being, if he was in a state like Taesan's, he wouldn't be able to stop it.

That's what he thought.

Taesan poured strength into his hand.

The sphere let out a scream and burst out its power, trying to tear apart Taesan's body and inflict wounds.

But it didn't reach him.

It was blocked by the aura and divine power surrounding him, and couldn't reach.

[……What?]

Only then did Keboruak realize.

His attack wasn't reaching Taesan.

Something invisible, something that couldn't be seen as part of this world, was crushing his attack.

Kachaang!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The orb shattered and the wind scattered in all directions. The attack nullification did not activate. It meant that not even a slight damage was inflicted.

"Something's wrong."

Taesan brushed his hand away.

He was currently a transcendent being.

Even if he was barely clinging to the edge, he was an existence that had surpassed the wall.

Keboruak and Paragup were strong. If the two combined their powers, they could even take down Ainztaharma.

But even so, it was still at the level of immortality.

There was an unbridgeable gap between immortality and transcendence. It was an absolute wall.

"You're right, I'm not a complete transcendent being now. I'm a transcendent being who has escaped my own world, but hasn't reached my proper place. I've only recently become a god, so I'm still very unstable."

There was no mistake in their words.

"But that doesn't mean you can beat me."

Taesan laughed.

"Okay, show me your proud power."

[You activated the Creation of the Sacred Land.]

A golden light began to envelop the world.
