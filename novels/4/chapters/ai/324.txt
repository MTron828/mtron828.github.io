Chapter 325

325. The 71st Floor, the Shadow that Devours Everything (1)

It was starving.

To satisfy its hunger, it repeated the cycle of eating and eating.

But even so, its emptiness was not filled.

Grrr.

The shadow wept, waiting for the day it could fill its hunger, and fell asleep in the deep, dark abyss.

* * *

Taesan examined each of the equipment.

The wrist guard, armor, shoes, and helmet all boasted exceptional performance, making him want to buy them all. Taesan restrained himself.

If he saved up more gold, he might be able to buy more, but for now, he could only afford one. He had to be cautious.

Regaining his composure, Taesan checked the equipment and discovered one fact.

[Deep Hiding Black Shoes] [Defense +500] [Movement Speed +10%] [For 10 seconds, you can hide in a deep place and become immune to any effects, but you cannot move. You can come out at will, and there is a 1-hour cooldown after use.] [650,000G]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Shoes that grant invincibility for 10 seconds. Since they can be used at will, there was no chance of being caught off guard by the opponent. These shoes were versatile and could be used to dodge the opponent's fatal attacks, hide one's body, or find an opening to counterattack.

However, due to their powerful special effects, their inherent stats were relatively lacking.

It wasn't just the shoes that were like this.

[Injured Balroc's Sealed Ring] [Mana + 100] [Attack Power + 50] [Defense + 50] [Allows you to summon Balroc, who is sealed. The summoned Balroc will not obey anyone's commands and will try to destroy everything. If it takes a certain amount of damage, it will be resealed by the ring and can be summoned again after a week.] [500,000G]

Balroc.

When I first met him, Half Ran summoned Balroc to test me and said, "A monster from the depths, a being that rivals dragons."

The ability to summon such a being was undoubtedly remarkable.

However, the ring's inherent stats were ridiculously low.

Compared to the equipment I obtained before reaching the depths, it was lacking.

After checking other equipment, I was convinced.

Either the stats were absurdly high, or they had moderate stats and special abilities."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Or, instead of having low stats, they have extremely exceptional special abilities.

The equipment that can be obtained here is one of three.

"Is this the best equipment that can be obtained here?"

"Don't be ridiculous. This is just the entrance to the deep floor. As you go down, you'll be able to see even more exceptional equipment."

The shop owner replied. It seemed that it was impossible to obtain perfect equipment at the entrance to the deep floor.

Then, what should he get?

Taesan fell into thought.

Honestly, it didn't matter what he bought. He couldn't see any equipment that was significantly better than what he already had. That's why his head hurt even more.

Taesan continued to check the equipment and organized his thoughts.

What was lacking for him?

It wasn't defense. He had Aegis's shield, attack nullification, endurance, and destruction's greed. He had many skills that could block and eliminate attacks.

He could erase his opponent's defense with absolute judgment and accelerate his skills to attach quickly. He even had limited blink, so he wasn't lacking in mobility.

His attack power wasn't low either, thanks to his Ilac martial arts skills.

Taesan came to a conclusion."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

What he lacked was not something else.

He lacked the power to break through the opponent's pressure and move forward.

Taesan, who had organized his thoughts, checked his equipment. Since he had already decided what to buy, his movements were swift.

In the end, Taesan was able to find a single gauntlet.

[Continuously Amplifying Gauntlet] [Attack Power +500] [Magic +30] [Dark Magic +30] [Mana +500] [Magic Defense +100] [A gauntlet created by a renowned magician who spent his entire life on it. The magical design and materials within it have the ability to amplify power to the extreme.] [Can activate [Forced Amplification] once every ten minutes.] [Forced Amplification] [Increases the consumption value of skills that consume mana and magic defense, maximizing their power.] [600,000G]

"Can I try using it once?"

"Do as you please."

Taesan put on the gauntlet and gathered his mana. The frozen world unfolded, and cold air began to spread in all directions.

Taesan grasped the gauntlet in that state.

[You have activated [Forced Amplification].]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan's mana was rapidly draining away.

And the energy of the western wind that was spreading towards the world grew stronger.

Zzzt!

The ice was maximized, engulfing everything. The cold air that was pouring down made Taesan's skin feel chilly.

"It's considerable."

The power was unmatched compared to the frozen world he was used to.

If it was this strong, even Vishnu, who had activated the king's world, would be pressured.

It was a skill that amplified power, so the stronger the skill, the more effective it would be. The stronger it got, the more useful the equipment would be.

It was more than enough. Taesan touched the gauntlet.

"I'll do it with this."

"This guy is buying this as soon as he enters the deep level for the first time."

The shop owner laughed and received the gold.

Taesan, who had obtained the gauntlet, headed towards the passage.

"Good luck."

With a quiet farewell, Taesan moved forward.

The place he arrived at after passing through the passage was a dark and dense world of blackness.

It was a space where nothing could be seen, like a dark and thick ink.

Taesan expanded his senses.

* * *

"Break through the realm of the starving shadows."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was the condition for clearing the 71st floor.

You could break through without meeting the specific conditions.

Taesan stepped into the darkness.

A thick, heavy sensation spread through his feet.

It wasn't just a simple darkness, and even Taesan's vision couldn't fully grasp what was beyond the darkness.

[You activated the domain detection of Leraize.]

The waves containing magic spread out in all directions, informing Taesan of the hidden information in the darkness.

But it suddenly stopped.

Something deep in the darkness had absorbed all the power of Taesan's domain detection.

Taesan quietly drew his sword, focusing his senses and slowly moving forward.

Chwa-a-a-ak!

At that moment, the darkness split open, and a monster appeared.

It was a shadow.

The shadow with a form rose from the ground and charged at Taesan.

[A starving shadow appeared.]

Taesan moved his sword.

Kwaa-a-ang!

With a loud noise, the shadow was slammed to the ground. The shadow scattered on the ground and began to cling to Taesan's feet, trying to devour him.

"Hmm."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan gathered his strength and trampled on the shadow.

The shadow, however, did not back down, and instead got up again and charged at Taesan.

Inside, it was filled with only greed and hunger.

[You activated the Frost Arrow.]

The cold arrow pierced the shadow. But the shadow did not stop. It swallowed the arrow shot by Taesan and kept charging.

Taesan wielded his dual swords and stabbed the shadow.

The shadow created a hole in its own body and dodged the dual swords.

Aaagh!

The shadow transformed into a sharp blade and charged.

Taesan moved his sword.

Clang!

The sound of collision echoed.

Currently, Taesan's stats are superior to those of the headquarters. Despite that, the shadow was not easily pushed back.

Kagakagak!

The shadow swirled around and tried to devour Taesan. Taesan rolled on the ground and charged.

[You activated the Whirlwind Sprint.] [You activated the Skill Acceleration.]

A storm swept in. The shadow, which was about to devour, was suddenly pushed back.

Taking advantage of the opening, Taesan thrust his sword deep into the shadow.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The shadow didn't collapse, but instead rushed towards Taesan and bit into his arm.

However, due to the aura of the martial arts, the shadow was pushed back. It was the activation of the absolute protection that prevented continuous damage.

Taesan exerted strength in his hand, and with that, the shadow was cut in half.

Thud.

The halved shadow still didn't stop trying to devour Taesan. Taesan kicked it away with an annoyed expression and trampled on it.

[You have defeated the starving shadow.]

The movement of the shadow, which had been crawling on the floor, finally stopped.

"What's going on?"

The shadow was incredibly strong.

Taesan had to focus all his energy to take down one of them.

That meant that a typical 71st-floor adventurer would have to risk their life to fight it.

It was a rather unique monster.

The shadow wasn't trying to kill Taesan.

It was trying to make him a part of itself by devouring him.

"Were you also like this?"

[No? I was a bit different. Did I change floors again?]

"That's right."

At that moment, Taesan sensed the shadows rushing towards him, wriggling in his senses.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan stomped his foot. He jumped into the air, and the shadows flew up at once.

More than ten shadows rushed towards Taesan.

[You have activated the Frozen World.] [You have activated Forced Amplification.]

Zzzt!

The fierce frost of the darkness froze everything. The shadows that were rushing towards him were trapped in the ice.

The power of the Frozen World that he had unleashed was so strong that even the highest authorities couldn't stop it. A 71st-floor monster couldn't withstand it.

Ka-ching.

But the shadows didn't die.

Instead, they broke free from the ice that had frozen them and rushed towards Taesan again.

There was no killing intent in their eyes.

All that was visible was greed.

Zzzt!

The ice shattered. The shadows flew their broken bodies and tried to devour Taesan once again.

But Taesan didn't just stand there. A black thread had gathered on his hand.

[You have activated Sabnak's Black Thread.] [You have activated Limited Blink.]

As the black thread exploded, Taesan's body moved far away in an instant.

The shadows were cut apart by the black thread and fell to pieces.

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan charged towards the shadows that were falling to the ground.

[You activated the Starlight Arrow.]

With magic and sword in tandem, he took care of them one by one. After a considerable amount of time had passed, he was able to take out the entire row of shadows.

[Your level has risen.] [Your spiritual power has increased. The proficiency of the Seed of Life has increased by 2%.]

A level up. And with it, the skill of the immortal being that had surpassed mortality, which was given to him by the Dragon God, had its proficiency increased by taking out the shadows.

Taesan scowled.

He gathered his magic. He opened a path towards the demon, and activated dark magic.

[You activated the Domain Detection of Leraize.]

Kiiing!

The magic spread out in all directions.

Although it was swallowed up by the darkness and disappeared, it continued to spread without stopping.

As a result, Taesan was able to figure out what kind of place this was.

This darkness was incredibly vast.

Even with domain detection, he couldn't see the end of it.

And within the darkness, there were countless shadows hiding.

Rumble.

The shadows were charging towards Taesan.

Their number easily exceeded several hundred.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A four-digit shadow was approaching.

* * *

Taesan, who had detected the approaching shadows, filled with determination, said:

"Disappear."

[You have activated the Declaration of Concealment.]

The command is activated. Taesan's presence is erased, and his aura disappears.

The shadows that were rushing towards him suddenly stop. They can't locate Taesan's position and wander around in confusion.

Taesan walked through the darkness.

Although his vision was blocked and his senses were numb, he could still see and feel enough to move without difficulty.

Taesan brushed past the stumbling shadows.

Even if he had activated the Declaration of Concealment, he couldn't be detected, not even when he passed right next to them.

Taesan, who was moving forward, stopped in his tracks. Two shadows were fighting each other.

Rumble.

Their powers clashed, each trying to devour the other. Taesan watched the battle between the two shadows with a calm gaze.

The fight between the shadows, which had been trying to devour each other, soon turned into a one-sided victory. The dominant shadow brutally suppressed its opponent and devoured it.

The power of the shadow that had devoured its opponent began to amplify.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"On the contrary, the power of the shadow that had absorbed him was suddenly drained.

The shadow that had absorbed the power seemed satisfied and left with a carefree attitude. The shadow that had lost all its power began to move slowly and awkwardly.

'I wonder how this happened.'

This was the realm of those shadows.

They would absorb each other's power and try to take over, and adventurers who visited this place would also be absorbed and made into one of them.

I realized the strategy to conquer this place.

The quest clear condition was not to defeat the shadows, but to break through them.

It seemed that the goal of the 71st floor was to hide from the numerous shadows, find a passage, and escape through it.

Taesan used his authority, but adventurers who had made it this far would likely have a skill to hide their bodies or could buy related items from the store to break through.

Of course, Taesan didn't plan to clear it that way.

Taesan walked through the darkness, heading deeper into the unknown."
