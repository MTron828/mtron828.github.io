**Chapter 593**

**593. Extra Story, Mashin (5)**

A small girl.

She looked like a child in her early teens. Her soft, black hair cascaded down. Her black eyes gazed at them narrowly.

She was extremely beautiful, but that was all. No powerful energy or aura could be felt from the girl.

However, Baal was shocked.

The girl was ordinary.

Her power and aura were insignificant.

But despite that, Baal could sense something about the girl.

"Nine years ago, a child was born. The child's mother died during childbirth, and the father also died in an accident. I took the child in and started raising them."

The man spoke quickly, unable to calm his excitement.

"And soon, I realized. The child was a genius."

His eyes, filled with madness, turned to Lucifer.

"I didn't teach the child anything, but in just five months, they began to speak fluently. They spoke more freely than an ordinary adult."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He analyzed the structure of the words he heard and grasped their meaning, making them his own.

'When I was only one year old, I mastered walking and running perfectly. I began to perfectly control my physical abilities.'

The child never fell even once.

Without relying on anyone, he stood up on his own power and moved freely.

'I was defeated by this child when he was only seven years old, with pure technique. I didn't teach him anything, you know.'

By observing the man's movements with his eyes, he understood the structure of his power and actions, making them his own perfect technique.

With just that, he was able to defeat the immortal man with his technique.

'This child is a genius. No, it's hard to describe him with such an expression.'

The man spread his arms wide. A loud voice echoed through the underground chamber.

'This child is a miracle!'

'Shut up.'

Lucifer scrunched up his face, as if his ears hurt.

A miracle.

Even Baal, who had ridiculed the term until now, couldn't deny it this time.

A being that appears only once in several billion years, a miracle that transcends the entire universe."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"From the moment of birth, a being with the possibility of becoming a transcendent being is born.

Such an existence was born in this small, model-like box.

Baal is a high god. He is the enemy of the transcendent being, existing since before the creation of the universe.

He poses a great danger to them.

Baal's instincts trembled. At that moment, Lucifer's gaze turned to Baal.

A faint smile.

The laughter is directed at Baal. With a piercing gaze that sees through himself, Baal unconsciously took a step back.

"Do you know?"

"What do you mean?"

The man did not understand Lucifer's intention. Lucifer shook his head.

"I guess you don't know. You're well-hidden. That's okay... but who are you?"

Lucifer's gaze turned to Taesan.

His face was filled with curiosity.

"This is very unusual. You're neither this nor that."

"An outsider."

Taesan spoke calmly.

"Is this the demon god from the mortal era?"

Surprisingly, there was little difference between the current demon god and the one from the past. The only difference was in the power and dignity they possessed, but their tone and gestures were almost identical to those of the current demon god. They were a being that was complete from the start.

"There's something... familiar about you."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lucifer narrowed his eyes.

"There's a familiar feeling somewhere... but that can't be. Something's blocking it. This feeling is new to me?"

Lucifer's eyes sparkled with amusement.

"It's fun."

The current Lucifer had restricted his past self from understanding the mountain. 

But Lucifer had pierced through that restriction as well. He couldn't resolve the contradiction, but he had succeeded in realizing it.

"Is this it?"

This was the vessel of the transcendent being.

Taesan was purely amazed. It was a talent that surpassed understanding.

[...It's possible.]

After a moment of silence, Baal spoke.

[It's possible.]

This girl could grant a man's wish. The man's face was filled with a bright smile.

"I will save our kind! I'll make the girl a god and curse us, giving us freedom!"

A frenzied cry.

The target of this, Lucifer, had a calm face.

* * *

[Am I allowed to see this?]

"Why suddenly?"

[No. It feels like you're doing something impious.]

Note: The translation tries to maintain the original tone and nuances of the text, but some phrases may not be directly translatable.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Baradrei muttered to himself in a tense tone. It was quite a miracle that Lucifer had allowed him to see his past - no, it wasn't Baradrei, but Asenath.

"Well, he must have known that you had seen it too."

[It's good then, but... how strange.]

Masin. Lucifer was the god of the abyss. It was an absolute truth that no one questioned, that he was the god of the abyss.

But here, Lucifer was not a god.

He was just an ordinary girl. Of course, her talent was not ordinary, but at least her level was.

Watching it directly with his own eyes was a very strange feeling for Baradrei.

"So, this is what it means to be a created god."

Lucifer said to Asenath. That she was a created god. A tool for the demons.

There was no lie in that statement.

She was truly a god created out of necessity.

"So, this is where the truth begins."

Asenath's body began to be covered by darkness. Even transcendents and high gods could no longer recognize his existence.

Soon, he had perfectly hidden his appearance.

* * *

That night. At a time when the darkness had grown even deeper.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ba'al had quietly entered the underground room where Lucifer was sleeping.

Lucifer was lying on a small bed, sleeping peacefully.

Just looking at her, she seemed like a very cute child.

It was hard to believe that she was the vessel of the Overlord, just by looking at her appearance.

[Hmm.]

It was also Ba'al's first time seeing the Overlord's vessel.

Born with the qualification to become an Overlord from birth, she was a being akin to a miracle.

The girl in front of him could break the small model box and free the demon tribe.

Of course, there were still many problems remaining. Right now, she was just the vessel of the Overlord, with no power whatsoever. It was almost impossible to solve all the problems.

But it was not impossible.

There was a one in ten thousand chance that the girl could become the Overlord and cover the demon world.

He thought to himself.

He had to eliminate the risk.

The man's device was not yet complete. He could take care of it right away.

Just as he was about to move.

"......An intruder has entered."

A voice rang out. The girl, Lucifer, had somehow opened her eyes and was staring at Ba'al.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You're coming into a girl's bedroom? Isn't that too rude?"

[He felt sorry about that.]

The girl slowly got up from bed. Her hair flowed down onto the bed.

Her black eyes gazed at Baal.

Every time she looked at him like that, Baal felt a piercing sensation.

"It looks free."

[Old people are all like that. After experiencing many things, they become tired of everything.]

"I think that's good too. Being free means you've enjoyed everything, right? So, you must be feeling bored."

The girl looked up at the ceiling with a bored expression.

"I'm also free. Unlike you, I haven't experienced anything, so it's like that."

[I think taking a walk might make things a little better.]

"I can't leave this place. He cherishes me so much. If I get even a small injury, he reacts as if the world has collapsed."

[That's right. He is the one who will fulfill his own desires through you.]

"Even so, I'm just a tool to him."

The girl lay down on the bed, looking bored.

Note: Baal is a proper noun and appears to be a name, so I left it untranslated.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lucifer, who had been staring blankly at the ceiling, turned his head slightly.

"There's a unique scent."

[What scent?]

"It's similar to the flowers I smelled when I was young, but slightly different."

[Is he talking about the scent of black tea?]

"Black tea?"

[He doesn't even know what black tea is.]

When I think about it, it's unlikely that there would be black tea in this small model garden.

Baal chuckled slightly.

[Want to try it?]

Lucifer slowly nodded his head.

Baal returned to his residence and brought back tea leaves and a teacup. He boiled water and slowly steeped the tea leaves.

"Heh."

Lucifer watched with curious eyes as the fragrance wafted up.

Baal found it somewhat amusing.

A being who could become a transcendent being, someone who could threaten him, was interested in such a small thing. It was ridiculous and entertaining.

"The scent is nice."

[It seems to have steeped enough. Why don't you try some?]

Lucifer slowly picked up the teacup. He was briefly surprised by the heat, but then carefully brought it to his mouth.

"......It's delicious."

[It's not bad, I suppose.]

"Is this kind of thing overflowing outside?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There are even more amazing things."

"Envy. There's nothing here. Even if it exists, it won't be sent out."

Lucifer drank the red tea in an instant and clicked his tongue, looking disappointed.

"Lacking... Hmm..."

After a moment of contemplation, Lucifer's face lit up as if he had a good idea and he clapped his hands.

"Good. Then let's make a deal, shall we?"

[Deal?]

"Bring me the red tea and other external pleasures. And when everything is over, I'll spare your life."

[What did I do wrong that you're offering to spare my life?]

"You're a sinner, aren't you?"

Lucifer said with a nonchalant face.

Baal laughed.

[You're really perceptive.]

"How can you not know when the atmosphere is so thick?"

[The one who calls himself a miracle didn't realize it, did he?]

"He's an idiot."

Lucifer said with a sneer.

"I've heard a lot about him. Our eternal, immortal enemy. The undead monster. A twisted existence that has been around since before the creation of the universe."

[And yet, you're asking me for a deal?]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, I'm making a request. Even if I become a transcendent being, I'll spare your life."

The small girl made a bold proposal to Baal, the great demon lord.

"You won't lose anything. These small toys are nothing to you, right? It's just a small price to pay for your life. Isn't it a ridiculous price?"

She spoke with confidence, without a hint of hesitation or wavering.

It wasn't that she didn't notice his power. The girl wasn't foolish enough to not know what Baal was capable of. She knew exactly what kind of existence Baal was and what kind of power he possessed.

The girl was a vessel for a transcendent being, but she wasn't one herself. If Baal simply snapped his fingers, he could kill her.

"Amusing."

Baal laughed. It was a genuine laugh, one that he hadn't laughed in a long time.

[I'm scared, so I can't refuse.]

Baal put on a show, like an actor in a play. He was a great performer.

[Good. I accept. You're a clever kid.]
