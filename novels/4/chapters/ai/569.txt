**Episode 570**

**570. The God of Fall, the Usurper (1)**

The entire universe is falling.

It wasn't a physical concept of falling.

The scattered grass, the earth, the swaying wind, the quietly standing ocean, and the fragments of broken buildings.

Everything is falling.

The concept and the axis are dropping to the bottom.

"What's going on? This is..."

Taesan muttered.

He could feel it.

The conceptual part of the universe, where everything is falling.

For him, there was no significant influence. The influence of the fall wasn't that great. If one had a certain level of axis, they could ignore it without much difficulty.

But it wouldn't be the same for mortal beings.

They would suddenly feel a sense of powerlessness and self-loathing. They would feel like they're falling into an endless abyss. All sorts of negative emotions would dominate their entire body. It wouldn't just be a simple feeling, but would also affect their physical strength.

Every existence in the universe would be affected.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The dignity of humans has fallen to a level not even worthy of insects, and insects have become as powerless as dust. Even the strong will become as feeble as the elderly.

“……This is.”

The God of Decline has arrived.

His existence was scattering his concept throughout the universe.

And, a powerful force spread through the crack in the sky.

Tremendous!

The crack was sealed, but the seal was broken. The crack spread rapidly throughout the entire seal.

“Ah.”

A voice echoed. A wizard who had suddenly arrived was looking up at the crack with his tongue out.

“Did I come at the right time?”

As soon as he finished speaking, numerous presences were felt.

“What, what is this?”

“What’s going on?”

Panicked voices echoed. Hundreds of millions of people suddenly returned to Earth.

They were all Easy, Normal, and Hard mode players.

“Ah…….”

“Ah, ugh.”

Those who arrived on Earth suddenly let out a sigh. The concept of decline that had spread throughout the universe was no exception for them. In the case of Easy mode, they couldn’t even breathe properly.

“What, what is this?”

Kim Hwi-yeon, who had seen the great mountain, asked with a panicked face.

“Tae, Tae-san? How did this happen…….”
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Can I ask you something? Why did you guys return to Earth?"

"Huh? What?"

Kim Hwi-yeon's eyes widened as he looked around.

"What's going on? Why are there so many?"

"You don't know either, do you?"

It meant that they had been forced to return without any prior notice or system warning. It was as if the system was mocking them, only appearing after everything was over.

[Forced Return.] [All players in the labyrinth will return to Earth.]

"What the...?"

"What is this?!"

"You're really something else."

Taesan clicked his tongue.

The people's confusion didn't last long. It was because something even more shocking was happening.

Rumble!

At the same time, the universe began to distort.

Several powerful, distorted beings appeared simultaneously. They began to defile the world and claim it as their own.

The gods.

Things that had disappeared from the universe were reappearing.

"There are many."

And their numbers were not small. It was as if all the gods had descended upon this place, determined to put an end to everything this time.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Their distance was just right, neither too close nor too far from the Earth. It was a distance where they could exert their influence.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

A crack began to spread in the universe.

People screamed and stumbled.

"Ah, ah, ah……."

"Ah."

The gods' influence swept over them. Even though they couldn't see it, they felt suffocated. Their breathing stopped, and death drew near.

People were consumed by fear and began to die slowly.

It was then that Taesan tried to protect them, biting his tongue.

[This is crazy.]

A woman appeared, her face twisted in a scowl as she snapped her fingers.

Kyiiiing!

And the death that had been cast over the people was lifted.

People barely managed to catch their breath. Taesan looked at her.

"Derasha-nim."

The goddess of death, Derasha.

She had covered the Earth with her power.

[Is this how it's going to be?] [It's within the predicted range, but it's quite a sight. I didn't expect them to gather in one place. This is fun.]

Laughter accompanied the appearance of another woman.

The goddess of cycles, Arirnan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It wasn't just the two of them. The presence of other transcendents could be felt, one by one. They suddenly appeared, colliding and conflicting with the gods.

The magician clicks his tongue.

"I've decided to put an end to this."

"Have you decided to go for a short-term battle?"

The gods are unchanging and unyielding. That's their advantage over the transcendents.

So, the gods' battle strategy had been to drag out the fight and exhaust the transcendents' powers, one by one.

But the existence of Taesan distorted that strategy. He was a being who could grant eternal death to the gods.

Moreover, he could even steal their powers and become even stronger.

So, the gods changed their approach.

They decided to launch a swift and decisive attack, all at once.

KUUUUUUUUUUUUNG!

The shockwave swept through, and people cowered in fear, covering their bodies. Even though death and rebirth protected them, they felt the fear of being annihilated.

All beings capable of destroying and recreating the entire universe had gathered near the Earth.

It was like the final war, the end of everything, as enormous powers clashed and distorted.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And within it, the fall that covered the entire universe was palpably felt.

"You're kidding me."

The magician's lips curled up. In his eyes, a strong hatred and anger towards the God of Fall were evident.

"Are you thinking of committing suicide? What kind of nonsense is this?"

"Is it possible for a transcender to do something like this?"

"It's originally impossible, but the God of Fall is a god with its own concept and history. If it expands its own concept, it can temporarily influence the entire universe."

The magician spat.

"But in the end, it's a suicidal act. It's a crazy thing to consume one's own domain. You've made up your mind, haven't you?"

Taesan looked up at the crack in the sky.

The concept of fall that permeated the universe was strongly felt from there.

"I wondered where it was, and it was hiding in that gap."

The God of Fall was hiding in the crack in the sky.

Taesan looked around. Among the many players, the solo mode players were nowhere to be seen.

"The usurper must have forced them to return."

Iji and Normal, Hard modes were the usurper's possessions.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The usurper had the authority to forcibly return them. But Alron Mode was a complete labyrinth. The wizard snapped his fingers.

"Unexpected, but what can you do?"

At the same time, players of Alron Mode, including Lee Tae-yeon, returned to Earth. Among them was Amelia, who was in the middle of a battle, gritting her teeth and wielding her sword.

"Eeek... what?"

Her eyes widened in surprise.

"...Taesan?"

"Uh, just a moment. What's going on?"

Lee Tae-yeon felt the shaking forces and trembled. Diana and Beldequia also returned, holding their breath.

[No explanation needed. It's a long-awaited war.] [I don't have anything to do. I'll just have to watch over the mortals.]

Arirnan laughed and threw herself into the fray. Derusha activated her powers and surrounded the Earth.

And then the quest window appeared.

[Special Quest Begins.] [Survive.]

It was extremely short.

But the conditions were clearer than anything.

At the same time, monsters began to fall from the cracks in the sky. Twisted creatures, accompanied by the howling of beasts, started to descend upon the Earth."

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The power felt there was extremely high. They were monsters that possessed the power to trample and crush people.

At the very least, they were A-grade. There were many S-grades as well.

And the apostles.

The monsters were covering the sky.

People screamed. Kim Hwi-yeon held his breath and shouted.

"Everyone! Form a line!"

In the midst of confusion, people prepared to fight against the monsters.

And Taesan lightly swung his arm.

From there, a grayish light burst out, and the monsters falling from the sky disappeared all at once.

"What, what?"

People's eyes widened in surprise.

But it wasn't the end.

The monsters continued to pour down like a bottomless swamp.

Simply dealing with them was meaningless. Unless the cause was removed, the monsters would continue to come down until all players on Earth died. Taesan quickly realized this.

"Is it inside?"

Beyond the crack.

The God of Destruction was there. Its presence was so strong that everyone could feel it.

"Ah……."

"Uh."

Diana and Beldegia trembled with fear. The two of them crouched down.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The two who were greatly affected by the God of Fall's wrath bit their lips. They could feel the God of Fall's gaze directed towards the earth.

And there was another existence that spoke.

"This is unexpected, but... Taesan. I'll reduce the 99th floor quest right here."

[99th Floor Quest Begins.] [Defeat the existence beyond the rift.] [Reward:???] [Secret Reward:???]

Taesan nodded his head. He spoke to Kim Hwi-yeon, Lee Tae-yeon, and Amelia.

"Please help me."

"Yes, yes."

"What's going on, I don't know, but if we defeat those things, it'll be fine, right? Then what's the big deal!"

Amelia spoke with determination.

The monsters landed on the earth. Despite the sudden event, people responded calmly.

The battle began. Monsters and humans clashed and confronted each other.

"I want to help, but I don't have the luxury to do so. Neither do I, nor the other Transcenders."

Ku-gu-gu-gung......

A variety of waves and collisions occurred from outside the earth.

The gods and Transcenders were confronting each other.

Even if the two gods disappeared, the gods were powerful. The mages didn't have the luxury to easily help the earth.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They think they can see the end of everything with this opportunity. In other words, if they can just block this one, they can achieve some sort of settlement."

And the beings who existed for that end were waiting beyond the rift.

"Return victorious. We will do the same."

Taesan nodded. The wizard took a step forward. His body moved through space.

"Then."

"Come back. Taesan."

Lee Tae-yeon said with a smile, and Taesan replied lightly, flying away.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

He tore through the monsters flying towards him, ripped them apart, and entered the rift.

Thud.

Taesan landed.

In the rift that spread across the sky of the earth.

"This is my first time entering this place."

The rift was severely distorted. It felt like the realm of a god, but it wasn't. Nor could it be said to be the realm of the universe.

It was as if something was suspended in the middle.

Just like Taesan.

The rift was wider than he thought. It was a size that could easily surpass a mediocre galaxy.

As Taesan gazed at the rift for a moment, he realized.

This was the realm of the usurper.

Not a treasure box, but the true realm possessed by the usurper, his domain.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And Taesan saw it.

The being waiting for him.

[The God of Fall, Essence has appeared.]"

Let me know if you'd like me to help with anything else!
