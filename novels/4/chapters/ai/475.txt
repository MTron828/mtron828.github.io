Article 476

476. 90th floor. Mage (2)

"You're getting stronger at an incredible speed, no question about it. To be honest, I couldn't find a precedent like this even if I were to look at the entire universe."

Tai Shan had entered the mystic realm only 10 years ago.

However, he had already surpassed the immortal and reached the realm of transcendence.

"You're a special case, excluding extremely rare cases. You're growing at an incredible speed. You're exceptional and outstanding. But... it's not enough to reach the next level just by relying on that."

Tai Shan looked at the mage. The mage shrugged his shoulders.

"Well, let's give it a try."

The mage's power enveloped Tai Shan. His physical strength, mana, and magical energy were fully restored.

Tai Shan adjusted his sword.

"What's the time limit?"

"There isn't one. You can challenge as many times as you want, and use all the means at your disposal. Even if it's unfair or wrong, it doesn't matter. The only important thing is to break through to the next level."

The mage revealed himself. A vast, boundless world and realm appeared before the eyes of the world.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan had entered the realm of magic before, but at that time, his abilities were insufficient, and he was unable to grasp the essence of the realm he possessed.

But now he could understand.

The realm of magic was, in fact, this labyrinth itself.

He had mixed his own realm with the power of the gods, created numerous devices and systems, and brought the realm into being as a space.

"I am the magician of the labyrinth. I created and govern this place, and I am the only unique existence."

The magician smiled and spread his arms.

"Show me everything you possess."

Tai Shan's eyes widened in shock. He took a step back.

* * *

After that, a battle-like situation unfolded.

Since the first blow failed, he had to try his best to find a way from now on.

Tai Shan poured out all his strength to break through the magician, and the magician responded easily.

[You activated addition.] [You activated the sword of courage.] [You activated copying.]

An attack with all his might. The damage was in the tens of millions. But the magician waved his hand casually.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The ones who have transcended alone and reached the limit do not obey the law. You need to understand the meaning contained within it correctly."

A strange phenomenon emanated from the magician.

The sword on the peak of Mount Tai, which had collided with the phenomenon, lost its power in an instant.

The attacking power, amplified by addition, copying, and the sword of courage, returned to its original state.

The magician snapped his fingers and summoned the bricks of the labyrinth, which flew towards Mount Tai like a meteor.

The speed was too fast for him to dodge properly. Mount Tai quickly dodged, but couldn't dodge it all. The fragments hit Mount Tai's body.

[You receive 111 damage.] [You receive 111 damage.]

Mount Tai furrowed his brow at the damage display.

The attack invalidation did not activate at all.

The magician spoke calmly.

"It means that one can control everything according to one's own will by governing the law and concept."

The labyrinth is the magician's domain.

It is the world governed by the magician. Following the labyrinth's laws is equivalent to resisting the magician's will.

"You will not be able to use the labyrinth's skills unless you protect yourself within your own domain."

"It seems that way."
(Note: The text appears to be a fantasy story and the translation is based on the context and grammar of the text.)
If this were the earth, the situation would have been different. The earth is his domain, and his world. He can resist the interference of a mage to some extent.

However, this is a labyrinth. It is a mage's domain. The system of the labyrinth is not applicable.

So, he will attack with something else.

[You have activated the corrupt chain of Asmodeus.]

The chain is flying. Mount Tai is launching magic spells along with it.

The magic and dark magic are not based on the system of the labyrinth, but on the power of the archangel and Jerubbaal.

The mage's domain is far from being controlled.

[You have activated the World Sword.]

The World Sword appears in the labyrinth.

Although its size has decreased slightly to fit the labyrinth, its immense power has not changed.

Mount Tai swings it as is. The mage nodded his head.

"It's correct. I can't erase it with my power, which is far from my domain."

The mage took a step back.

And with that, the numerous powers spread by Mount Tai are shattered and broken. The World Sword is shattered and broken in an instant.

"But if there is a difference in power and momentum, it's not a big problem."

"Ugh."

Mount Tai spat out his tongue. It was as expected.
Here is the translation of the text:

Shin Hamon was dominant over the world of Beseuta. He was undoubtedly a transcendent being.

However, when the Masin grasped his fist lightly, he and Beseuta together disappeared.

The transcendent being who governed the laws was incredibly lofty. Even if he was not the original body, but a puppet, the difference was not narrowed down.

In the end, even the ordinary mysterious power or magic, or dark magic, did not work.

What was needed was holiness and blackness.

"'Time will take its toll.'"

Tae-san muttered to himself and quietly gathered his strength.

The recovery speed of holiness and blackness was extremely slow.

Even a magician could not recover it to the extent that he had to wait for time. The magician waited in silence.

Suddenly.

After a certain period of time, Tae-san stood up with a sword in hand.

The magician welcomed him with a smile.

Tae-san kicked his foot. His previous self was in a state of being bound by a boundary line.

The magician lightly snapped his fingers. At the same time, an overwhelming power and momentum pushed Tae-san.

Tae-san gritted his teeth and resisted. He strongly broke through the boundary line on his body, repelling the magician's power.
Here is the translation of the text:

The magician didn't respond differently. He seemed to be expecting something, and he casually manipulated his powers to gaze at the scene.

And then, only a short distance away, Tai Shan approached, holding a spell and shouting:

"Halt!"

Kiiying!

The world was engulfed in blackness.

Time in the world came to a standstill.

The fragments of crumbling bricks scattered.

The explosion subsided, and the aftershocks ceased.

Everything came to a halt.

And in that frozen world, the magician was also caught up in it.

Tai Shan charged forward without hesitation. The time was short, and he had to end it within that time. It was the moment when he was about to strike the puppet with his sword.

The puppet's body trembled.

As if resisting the frozen time, it kept leaving a lingering shadow. Tai Shan quickly tried to thrust his sword into it.

Kaaah!

The sound of shattering and the magician's body moving together.

"It's too late."

Thud.

The magician's hand grabbed Tai Shan's sword. As the boundary exploded and he tried to grab the puppet, the magician's area kept filling the gap.

"You don't have the power of the divine. You're not strong enough to stop the world's time."

The magician's powers surged. Tai Shan was pushed backward, stumbling.
Here is the translation of the text:

"But I fought directly against the owner of that power."

A very long time ago.

There was a war between the Transcendent One and the High God.

And the winner was the Transcendent One.

"'The one who walks time. There is no concept of time around the High God. Do not intervene by exceeding time by breaking down the future and past. Your level is not impressive to us.'"

"'I'm shocked.'"

The majestic mountain, with its refined manner, muttered to itself.

The boundary line does not pass through the chaotic region.

Time's authority does not pass through either. There was no need to mention other powers.

The mage said:

"Keep going."

* * *

The mountain did not give up.

It gathered all means and combined its numerous abilities to try to break through the mage's defense to the maximum.

It was really an insurmountable challenge. The mountain spent over a week trying to get a glimmer of hope.

And in the end, the mountain concluded:

"It's impossible."

I thought there must be a gap. Since it's impossible to win, I used all means to try.
Here is the translation of the text:

But the answer didn't come out.

Taisan had overcome numerous challenges that seemed impossible, and had achieved great feats. He believed that he could overcome any obstacle that stood in his way.

If there was no possibility of winning, he would find another way or create a different outcome.

However, this time was different.

Although it was just a fleeting moment, Taisan was connected to the magician in a way that was unlike the seventh scroll of the World Crusher. Even a little bit of the magician's power was enough to be considered a great force.

In other words, the one blocking Taisan was one of the strongest existences in the universe.

At least, it was impossible to win under the current circumstances.

Taisan closed his eyes.

How could he win? No, could he even reach that level?

"It's not a quest that can be cleared with just a simple battle."

It didn't mean that clearing was impossible either. A maze should have some possibility of clearing, after all.

Taisan looked at the magician.

The magician didn't say a word to Taisan, who had given up on the battle. He just smiled quietly.
Here is the translation of the text:

The mage had been seeking something from Tai Shan.

"What do you want?"

Tai Shan recalled the mage's words.

He said that as long as one's abilities exceeded those of gods and transcendent beings, one could surpass the limits. Tai Shan agreed, saying that he had grown stronger and possessed exceptional abilities, but there were still differences between himself and those who could exert influence on the universe.

The mage said again that he had grown quickly, but it was difficult to reach their own realm with just that. It was not just a matter of needing a simple boundary or threshold.

Tai Shan thought to himself.

If he used the same method to forcefully surpass his limits, rely on the mystic system, and reach a higher level, would he be able to do so?

The answer soon became clear.

It was possible.

The boundary and mystic ascension were irregular. By defeating countless powerful opponents through mystic ascension and overwhelming the total amount of energy on the boundary, one could then surpass even the creator of the labyrinth, the mage.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was far too inefficient.

The mage had reached a very high level. In order to reach that place by consuming countless powers in a way that was easy to digest, it was truly necessary to spend a lot of time.

The time it took was comparable to none before.

Of course, having reached that level was undoubtedly a significant advantage, but it was an extremely inefficient method, and that hadn't changed. Now that I've seen the mage's power with my own eyes, I know.

Taisan opened his eyes. The mage was looking at him quietly.

"What's the point of showing this?"

This meant that it was difficult to reach that level using the methods of the past.

"Was I hoping to realize something?"

And it was not a physical thing.

Taisan closed his eyes.

The mage was watching him quietly, smiling.
