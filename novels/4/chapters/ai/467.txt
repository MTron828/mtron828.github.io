Chapter 468

468. 89th Floor, the Outpost of the Gods (1)

As soon as I arrived on the 89th floor, Balbam appeared before me as usual.

[You handled it well. This much isn't bad.]

"Really?"

[It's not like I'm going to destroy the world with the immortals or force people to worship me through mind control. I just killed two immortals. That's within the acceptable range.]

Balbam spoke in a calm but somewhat resigned tone.

[Anyway, once you reach the 90th floor, you'll be free from my grasp. Do as you please. I can tolerate that much.]

Now, I felt a sense of liberation.

"So, is the 89th floor the last floor you're in charge of?"

[That's how it'll be. There will still be things to take care of afterwards, but I won't have to worry about it anymore.]

Balbam said with satisfaction.

[Finally, I'm free. It's done really well.]

The joyful him soon composed himself and started his work.
Here is the translation of the text:

"So, I'll explain the 89th quest. The quest is about infiltrating a planet that is the vanguard of a high-ranking being in the universe, killing the being's slave, and destroying the world."

"What is the vanguard?"

"High-ranking beings are basically existence that have been exiled from this world. They cannot intervene in this world arbitrarily."

"But they intervene too often."

Every time Tai Shan took action, the high-ranking being would intervene. It had become quite annoying.

Valvatorez shrugged carelessly.

"That's enough to limit them. Originally, they would have devoured the entire galaxy."

"The scale is getting too big."

"Because those who once ruled this world are involved. You'll understand what I mean. There are those who made a contract with them."

Tai Shan nodded his head.

The Holy Realm. The foolish mortal, Arura. The leader of China, Jin Long. The world of Lebinenov, where I encountered the empty, monstrous body.

All of these existences had accepted the high-ranking being's proposal.

"The high-ranking being cannot easily intervene in this world. Therefore, they do not allow the contracted minions to remain in the planet they have taken over. That's why it's called the vanguard."

Valvatorez spoke in a tone of annoyance.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The planet that has been consumed is capable of exerting some influence, even on gods. Although the Overbeings are removing the gaps each time they appear, it's just too many. If things go wrong, even the Overbeings could suffer significant losses. Therefore, it's better to handle the external demons rather than directly attacking the frontlines.]

"The universe is in a precarious state, you know."

[The universe has always been unstable. Even without gods, a world that's about to perish is of little concern. It's just that a god has been added to it.]

The Overbeing's tone didn't show any significant emotional change, as if it was just a big deal.

[It's gotten worse recently, but it's still okay.]

"So you want me to personally go to the frontlines and destroy it? Even the Overbeings can't just enter that place?"

[That's correct. But you're fine. You're not affected by their pollution.]

Tai Shan had a black aura.

He was not contaminated by the power of the gods, and he was freely handling it.

[The direct interference of the gods will be blocked by the Overbeings. You just need to settle their accounts.]

"Alright."

Tai Shan nodded his head.

"No surrender."

* * *

The quest has been accepted.

Balambalma said he would say it when he was ready. Tai Shan obtained the black magic before that by sacrificing a gift to the gods.
Here is the translation of the text:

[I have obtained the designated space collapse of Baal.]

[Baal's designated space collapse]
[Consumed mana: 2500]
[Consumed magic: 1000]
[Proficiency: 1%]

It summons a distorted space existing in Baal's domain to a designated location. The power to collapse time and space is not effective in physical influences beyond a certain point.

It is a new intermediate-level black magic that I obtained after trying it out a few times. It seems to be a black magic for long-range sniping.

The range limit is up to what can be seen in one's line of sight, which is nearly the entire range. The destructive power doesn't seem to decrease even at a great distance, making it a useful spell.

After obtaining the black magic, I talked to the Mountain God.

"This time, are we going to the den of those guys?"

"Yes."

"Why aren't we disturbing the vanguard?"

"It's because the taint of the gods is a threat even to the transcendent, isn't it?"

"There is that, but... there's a bigger reason."

The Mountain God spoke in a calm tone.

"Usually, the avatar of the gods resides in the vanguard, and the avatar is a being that is one with the gods. They are indestructible, so it's not worth the effort to kill them. But... you're different."

The Mountain God was able to kill the avatar of the gods.
Here is the translation of the text:

It seemed that he had received a quest to destroy the outpost because of that reason.

["As always, I'll wait for you."]

"Yes," Taesan replied. The demon who was about to leave with a happy expression stopped suddenly.

[...]

Her gaze was directed at Taesan's index finger.

It was exactly Akasha.

["You... are different from before. What's going on?" [...You are the great lord of the underworld. You are a demon, aren't you?]]

Akasha asked the demon in a confused tone.

["Do you know who I am?"]

The demon narrowed his eyes instead of responding. His forehead furrowed.

["...I don't know you. I feel that something is off, but I don't know what it is. What is it?" ["It's the same, isn't it?" ["Hmm..."]]

The demon glanced at Akasha for a moment before leaving.

["It's not something that can be understood by just looking. It's fun. Is it related to the gods?"]

Akasha murmured with an interesting expression.

["There may be value in searching. See you next time."]

After saying that, the demon disappeared.

Taesan looked at Akasha.

"What's coming to mind?"

["...I can't say it out loud."]

Akasha was silent for a moment before opening her mouth.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Suddenly, a few fragmented memories came to mind. It's about my last encounter. I was... fighting with someone.]

She hesitated and spoke slowly.

[My lord, who I had lived with before, was also there. No, we all fought together. We resisted it with all our might.]

"What?"

"That... that's..."]

Akasha didn't answer.

She looked worried and clamped her mouth shut.

"I don't know. I can't remember. It's like a completely different color has been painted over it.]

"You don't need to force yourself to remember."

Tae-san calmed Akasha down.

"Is that so?"

Mashi said that Akasha felt something from the god, but he didn't know what it was.

One of the strongest beings in the universe didn't know about Akasha.

It was likely related to the gods, as Mashi said.

"She was a forgotten goddess."

A goddess who no one, including all humans, remembered. That's Akasha.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san wondered about the goddess she believed in. What was it that made her unable to grasp even the basics? However, it was not something that could be confirmed immediately.

After Tae-san had finished summarizing everything, she approached Balbamba.

"It's over."

[I understand. Then let's start right away. Don't resist your power.]

Kiying!

Balbamba's power wrapped around Tae-san. Although she could have easily shaken it off if she had made up her mind, Tae-san followed Balbamba's words.

She had kept her strength and abilities hidden from the outside world.

[If you go down like that, they'll catch up right away. I don't know what you'll do, but you'll be able to move freely without being detected by them.]

"Thank you."

Balbamba released her power and opened up a space. It was not a planet, but the universe.

[Considering the world is under the influence of the gods, it's impossible to send someone directly. Instead, I'll send you to the nearby area. Go and see for yourself.]

Tae-san put her body into the space.

What she saw was a vast universe.

Tae-san was now in the middle of the universe.
Here is the translation of the text:

Life was impossible in this space, but Taesan had no particular problems. Taesan turned his gaze towards his destination and looked at it.

The place was shrouded in darkness.

A dark aura spread throughout the planet, slowly unfolding and polluting the universe.

He had to enter inside. Taesan moved his physical body towards the planet.

Suddenly, the dark aura that enveloped the planet stirred. It moved to block and exclude external beings.

Taesan wrapped himself in a black aura. The dark aura merged with Taesan's black aura and became one with it.

Taesan was able to infiltrate the planet's interior without any resistance.

What was displayed to the world was blackness.

Although I have seen many worlds destroyed by the power of the gods or seen destroyed worlds several times, this was different. It was more alien and closer to the gods.

The black aura that spread throughout the planet was like a swaddling cloth, embracing the planet.

The number of gods' servants and their strength here were unknown. The gods' power also blocked his guidance, making it impossible to communicate properly.

First, I planned to move cautiously for reconnaissance.

But before that, the opponent appeared.

"What's going on?"
Here is the translation of the text:

A man dressed as a mercenary stood on the shoulder, holding a sword and a liquor bottle, gazing at Tai Shan. Suddenly, Tai Shan's mind began to whirl rapidly. He was trying to stop himself from speaking too quickly.

"Are you new?"

The man replied calmly.

His attitude was completely without tension or vigilance.

Tai Shan quickly relaxed his facial muscles and nodded his head.

"What kind of messenger are you?"

"......The World Crusher."

"The World Crusher?"

The man's face was shocked.

"Did that person create a messenger? Are you lying?"

There was no intense suspicion on his face. He just thought that Tai Shan was trying to flatter himself by lying.

Tai Shan raised his arm. The man came closer to examine Tai Shan's arm. He seemed to be checking if he had a self-proclaimed title. He let out a sigh and exclaimed, "Really... this is amazing. Follow me."

The man walked forward.

Tai Shan followed him.

As we walked through the world stained with black, a small building came into view.

The building was extremely dilapidated, barely maintaining its shape.

Inside, there were sounds of multiple people's breathing.

Note: Tai Shan is likely a character from Chinese mythology, and the World Crusher is a mysterious title that the man claims to be. The story appears to be a fantasy adventure narrative.
Here is the translation of the text:

The man entered inside.

"Ah, did you come?"

"It looks like there were no major problems, right?"

"This world without a god or an immortal, I'm not impressed."

The man who proudly spoke turned his head towards Taesan.

"And look, I've found a new recruit, have you?"

"Ah."

"New recruit?"

They turned pale. Their faces were pure and innocent.

"Who is the one you worship?"

"The World Destroyer."

"What?!"

"Really?"

"Can you make a prophet too?"

"I was shocked. I thought it was a lie, but it turns out they have the power."

"That's amazing."

They showed a surprised and amazed expression towards Taesan.

But that was all.

There was no further interest or caution.

The man smiled slyly.

"And you guys, what did I bring?"

The man showed a wine bottle. Their eyes lit up.

"Ah!"

"What's this! That's incredible!"

"I brought it from the empire that was broken this time, and it's been aged for a long time to commemorate the imperial succession. I broke the seal and brought it here!"
Here is the translation of the text:

They burst out laughing and enjoyed themselves immensely.

It was a very peaceful and joyful atmosphere.

However, through their conversation, they realized that these people had sold their souls to a god and abandoned the world, making them traitors.

"Hey, newcomer! You too, come! Let's talk! What have you come for?"

The man who had been drinking gestured towards the mountain.

The newcomer was certain.

They didn't know anything about the mountain.

Whether it was because the information was not properly disclosed or because they didn't think they could come here, they were warmly received by him.

'Maybe the relationship between low-ranking officials isn't as bad as we thought.'

This was unexpected. They thought they would kill, reject, and keep each other at a distance.

But it wasn't a bad story.

'It's good, then.'

So, they obtained information. Many things about the god were unknown. They directly confirmed the god's power, kind, and number.

The mountain sat down next to the man, and opened his mouth.
