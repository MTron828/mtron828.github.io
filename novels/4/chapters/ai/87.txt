Episode 88

88. 20th Floor, Death Knight Road (1)

In front of the altar, the ghost spoke.

"[They call it the god of demons, but its essence is magic itself. It's a being that governs all magic.]"

Lucifer, the demon lord.

Perhaps that's why magic was flowing from the altar. The amount was small, but incredibly dense.

[Initial Discovery Bonus] [Intelligence permanently increased by 3. Mana permanently increased by 10.] [Altar of Lucifer] [An altar created by those who serve Lucifer. It serves as a conduit connected to the gods. Lucifer can exert influence through this place.]

"Do you know what kind of trial it is?"

"Um......"

The ghost trailed off.

"To be honest, I don't know either."

"Haven't you received it?"

"You should know that gods give trials that match their recommended domains. So what kind of trial do you think a demon lord would give?"

Taesan understood from the ghost's words.

"Is it a god who gives trials only to demons?"

"It's not necessarily like that, but for humans, the criteria are extremely strict."


Here is the English translation of the text:

---

The god of victory gives trials of victory, the god of struggle gives trials of struggle, and the god of choice gives trials of choice.

Naturally, a demon lord would give trials related to demons. And humans had no connection to demons. Naturally, there was a possibility that the demon lord would not find value in giving trials.

He understood, but then came the difficulty.

"Am I unable to receive trials too?"

He had come to the demon's altar to learn dark magic. But to find out he couldn't learn here after coming all this way was perplexing.

"[I may not have received it, but your story will be different. Regardless, you have triumphed against demons and gained dark magic, so Lucifer will know. Even if not, contact will be made.]"

He cleared all the enhanced trials imposed by various gods. Moreover, Maria even personally extended an invitation.

In such a situation, there were no gods who would remain indifferent if it wasn't their domain. The ghost thought so.

["It's just... the problem is not being able to anticipate what kind of trial it will be."]

"I'll have to come back later."

["To strengthen your weapons and go?"]

"Since I don't know what kind of trial it is."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

There was no information whatsoever. So it seemed best to just get stronger in every way possible. Even if trials were enhanced according to Taesan's scale, there was clearly a difference between numerous victories and a few losses.

Taesan finished the 19th floor. As it was the floor of the Lich, all the secret rooms, clear rewards, and secret rewards were related to magical equipment.

With plans to bring them all to Rilis later, he entered the 20th floor.

The monster on the 20th floor was a Death Knight. As a knight of death wielding a sword, he possessed considerable swordsmanship.

Of course, it meant nothing to Taesan.

*Kwachik.*

He swung the sword, sending it flying and piercing through the chest. Dark energy exploded with a bang and scattered in all directions.

Their levels were fairly similar, triggering a rise in spiritual energy, but the gap in stats was far too large. There was no reason to struggle now.

While breaking through, he encountered the guide of sin. Passing through, Gagorat moved through the room and saw Taesan, causing his body to shiver.

"I said I wouldn't kill you."

"...The weak always have to worry about the whims of the strong."

Gagorat chuckled.

"You've come all this way already..."

"I'm passing through."

Taesan passed by swiftly. Gagorat turned towards Taesan's back and spoke.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

"Are you going to descend straight to the 21st floor?"

"No. I'll stay a bit longer."

After combining his equipment, meeting Rilis, and clearing the Trial of the Magician, he planned to descend.

"Then, before you go down, there's something I need to tell you."

"I know."

Taesan left Gagorat behind and entered another room. He found the secret room and roughly dealt with the other rooms. He left one room untouched. Then, he entered the boss room.

[A Death Knight appeared.]

The name was the same. But it was stronger. The sword strikes were rough enough to test Taesan to some extent.

*Kwachik.*

However, the result was the same as before. The sword flew with force, catching Taesan off guard due to its speed.

Since the 8th floor, Taesan had been able to defeat adventurers up to the 20th floor. By the time he reached the 20th floor, there was no opponent who could be a match for the boss of the 20th floor.

He easily defeated the boss without any trouble.

"Hmm... It's not supposed to be this easy to pass through..."


Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

"I had a big fight with the guides of sin in the middle."

Originally, it would not have been overwhelming like this. It was possible because I could greatly increase my stats and level while facing the guides of sin.

System windows popped up one after another. They noticeably strengthened with each theme cleared. It wasn't as significant for Taesan now, but it wasn't meaningless either.

However, Taesan skimmed through the system windows and checked something.

"As expected, it's not here."

A reward obtained when clearing secrets and understanding all hidden elements of a floor.

That system window wasn't visible.

Taesan quietly examined the room.

"You had a strong feeling."

With a premonition, a brick came into Taesan's view.

The brick was lighter red compared to the other bricks.

Taesan pressed the brick.

*Drroong.*

As the brick went in, a passage soon appeared.

"...Come to think of it, I couldn't get the secret reward even on the 20th floor."

"As expected."
From the 1st to the 10th floor, there were monsters with names, commonly known as Named. However, from the 11th to the 20th floor, there were no Named monsters at all, only NPCs.

Taesan thought there might be at least one on the 20th floor, and his hunch was correct. Taesan entered inside.

There was a Death Knight.

[Death Knight Lord, Valoran appeared.]

"A Lord class."

Lords and Kings are overwhelmingly stronger than the average of their species. Taesan faced Death several times while unable to get out of his chair, facing- Ha.

[Your fair fight has been triggered.]

Valoran opens his mouth.

[Are you here.]

A low voice is heard.

[You must be the ghost of a hero.] [Know me?] [The sage often spoke of you. Strong, but pitiful and weak.] [â€¦I met that guy?]

There was a big difference between the 10th and 20th floors. Valoran laughed with Kook.

[What. It is a secret of ours. You should have this freedom in a bundled position.]

Valoran wiped off the laughter and turned his gaze. The red energy inside wearing
"He seems to be enjoying himself despite all that."

The voice contained enough joy for Taesan to notice.

"This is a hidden room. Not easily found."

With a grim voice tinged with madness, Valoran drew his greatsword and stood up.

"Those who find this place don't last more than a few centuries."

Valoran leaped forward. It was as if he had no need for conversation, quickly approaching Taesan with swift movements.

Taesan swung his arm.

Sword clashed against sword, rebounding off each other.

Strong. This was no mere 20th-floor level. It seemed even beyond the 25th-floor level. It wasn't a level where an ordinary player could win.

But Taesan was not an ordinary player.

"Hup!"

With a short, swift motion, the greatsword moved. Despite its enormous size, it moved incredibly gracefully.

Taesan moved both hands forcefully. There was a clash with the greatsword, creating a loud noise. Sparks flew, brightening the view.

Unable to withstand the force, the greatsword was pushed back, and Taesan thrust his sword in between.

"25 damage to Valoran."
Valoran moves his foot. His sturdy leg strikes Taesan's abdomen.

Then, a nullification of the attack activates. Valoran's foot returns to just before being heard.

Taesan seizes the opportunity to thrust his sword in.

Once again, Valoran attacks, only to be nullified once more.

In an instant, more than ten attacks are launched. Valoran fiercely swings his greatsword, driving Taesan back and letting out a mocking laugh.

"[Attack nullification... How amusing. What an incredible skill.]"

Muttering grimly, Valoran charges again.

There was no fear in his strikes that his own attacks might be nullified again. It was a composed attack, almost as if he had resigned to something.

Blocking the sword and deflecting it, Taesan sensed something odd.

Valoran is a named monster. Whether to counterattack or evade, he might have one or two skills at his disposal.

Yet in this pressing situation, Valoran solely wielded his sword against Taesan.

His red eyes stared earnestly at Taesan.

"Hmm."

Changing tactics, Taesan began pressuring Valoran with his swordsmanship alone. Valoran's eyes, visible through his helmet, curved in a sinister arc.

*Clang!*
The greatsword displayed dazzling movements. Perhaps that alone was a form of swordsmanship. Taesan moved his arms smoothly, resembling a dance of martial arts. He deflected the greatsword here and there, twisting its trajectory.

*Whack!*

Valoran released one hand gripping the greatsword and struck Taesan's chin with his elbow.

"[You received 72 damage.]"

Savage damage was dealt. His brain shook from the impact. Valoran didn't miss the opportunity and quickly readjusted his grip on the greatsword.

Taesan gritted his teeth. Along with the metallic taste of blood, his shaken mind began to clear somewhat.

He grasped the sword in his left hand in reverse grip.

*Clang!*

He blocked the greatsword that came down just below his chin.

Continuing in the same motion, he jabbed Valoran's side with his other sword.

The blade pierced through the armor, digging in.

Valoran stepped back, twisting the hand holding the greatsword outward, tearing through as if ripping apart. The sword held by Taesan, which had been blocking the greatsword, was pierced through, and the greatsword penetrated Taesan's shoulder.

Taesan immediately struck Valoran's head up close. The helmet shook violently, revealing a gap.

The swordsmanship favored the opponent. But the stats favored him.

Then, victory was achievable based on that advantage.

He swung down fiercely with both hands.

*Clang!*
Here is the English translation of the text:

Valoran's arm is slightly pressed. In a power struggle like this, the dance of martial arts has little significance. He roughly cuts using the wolf's fangs.

Valoran doesn't stay still either. Utilizing every part of his body, he repels and perfectly covers close combat by gripping the greatsword in reverse.

They engage in combat, each exploiting the other's strengths.

And the winner was Taesan.

*Kwajik.*

Taesan's sword pierces Valoran's chest. The armor, weakened and split, shatters completely.

Taesan gasped for breath. His condition wasn't good either. Blood flowed from various parts of his body, and nearly half his stamina was gone.

Leaning against the wall, Valoran let out a laugh.

"Thank you. I didn't expect you to refrain from using skills on purpose."

"It goes both ways."

Valoran intentionally refrained from using skills. Taesan matched that by sealing his skills and continuing the fight using only swordsmanship.

Valoran chuckled softly.

"I am a knight."

A knight is the term for one who wields a sword.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"In a space where such skills in English can only be obtained, I didn't want to rely on skills in English. I wanted to fight with just my pure sword. But that wish was only driven by my stubbornness. I didn't intend to force a fair fight... Thank you very much. Thanks to you, I can leave satisfied."

Valoran took off his helmet.

Surprisingly, a clean face was revealed. He must have just turned thirty. He didn't look very old.

"It's not much of a reward for that, but take this."

Valoran also possessed skills, but they were not his main strength. However, skills were Taesan's specialty. If he had used his skills, he could have passed through without major injuries.

But Taesan chose to refrain from using skills, accepting the risk himself.

Knowing this well, Valoran thought it appropriate to offer reasonable compensation.

It was a helmet worn by the Death Knight Lord. Naturally, it would have excellent performance. Moreover, the helmet was equipment that could only be obtained after considerable descent.

Taesan received the black helmet.

"I originally planned to leave without giving you anything. But I suppose this can be seen as compensation for your actions."

There was no intent to aim for it, but there were results from not using skills.

"Now I am free... I'd like to say that, but it's not really true."

Valoran chuckled softly.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Adventurer. Do you know why those of us with intellect are bound to the monsters here?"

"I don't know."

"It's simple. This place is a land of opportunity for some. But for others, it is not."

Valoran groans as he rises to his feet, supporting his staggering body with his sword.

"It's regrettable that I cannot contain the truth. With you, however, you could descend to the depths. Then you would naturally come to know. Who we are, what a mage is."

With a bitter voice, Valoran vanished.

"If that happens... Show mercy to us who cannot escape. O mighty one."

With a mournful farewell, Valoran disappeared.

All that remained were shattered armor and a sword devoid of all its strength.

"You are the Death Knight Lord. You have triumphed against Valoran." "Your level has increased." "Your spiritual essence has been activated." "You have obtained Valoran's helmet." "You have grasped the hidden elements of the 20th floor. Reward: [???]."

Taesan opened the system window that had been closed.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"You have perfectly cleared the 20th floor. You have gained the title [Seeker]." "You have thoroughly understood and cleared every floor up to the 20th. You have gained the title [Bearer of Perfection]." "You have entered the labyrinth to a level worthy of pride. You have gained the title [Arrival at the Path's Beginning]." "You have sufficiently proved your strength here and demonstrated even greater value. You have gained the title [Successful Challenger]." "You have accumulated countless experiences. You have gained the title [Accumulator]. You have obtained the special passive skill [Self-Validation]." "Transcendents are beginning to take a stronger interest in you."
