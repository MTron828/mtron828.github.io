64. 10th Floor, Boss (2)

The uses of points were as explained: Gold, Stats, and Skill proficiency.

The ratios were as follows:

[Gold is exchanged at a ratio of 1:10.] [Stats are exchanged at a ratio of 5:1.] [Skill proficiency is exchanged at a ratio of 10:1.]

The preceding numbers represented the points. Currently, he had 482 points. Converted into gold, it was 4,820 gold; converted into stats, it was 96 stats. Skill points were at 48%.

Though the 10:1 ratio was high, considering the value of proficiency in this place, it was sufficiently worthwhile to exchange. This return would definitely make him stronger.

Firstly, gold. It had the best ratio. Getting 10 gold per point made it arguably the most advantageous.

However, he had no intention of converting everything to gold.

While gold was an important currency here, it could be acquired at any time. Compared to stats and proficiency, its value was significantly lower.
Stats are the most fundamental figures here, arguably more important than proficiency, but not for Taesan.

If it were Itaeyeon or Kang Junhyuk, choosing stats would be the correct answer. Both would have obtained over 50 points, allowing them to raise their stats by 10. Considering their current stats are around 15, they would instantly become stronger.

However, Taesan's current stats were already excessively high.

If all his stats were added up now, they would total 819.

Using all his points would only be 10%.

Certainly a meaningful figure, but considering how difficult it is to acquire points, it seemed wasteful to exchange them.

But proficiency is different.

A figure that can only be accumulated through time, experience, and effort.

Opportunities to raise it in this manner were virtually non-existent.

There was a reason he was surprised by the proficiency potion that increased proficiency by 5%.

"Well then."

For the first time in a long time, Taesan opened his skill window. There were a few skills whose contents had changed due to increased stats.

[Special Passive Skill: Sight Expansion] [Proficiency: 62%] [Allows for a wide field of view. Quite beyond human norms.]
Sight Expansion has surpassed 60%. It was now appropriate to compare it to the compound eyes of insects.

[Special Passive Skill: Composure] [Proficiency: 83%] [A steady mind. Not shaken even in the face of beings beyond cognition. Gains adjustments in judgment. Never falters even in extreme situations. The spirit of this existence is indomitable.]

The phrase "The spirit of this existence is indomitable" has been added. Taesan, who has never failed a mental check, was unimpressed.

[Special Passive Skill: Line of Death] [Proficiency: 84%] [Can sense the moment of death. Activates in most crises. Also has a form of premonition.]

Line of Death now includes premonition, similar to insight. Premonition was always beneficial in any skill. Being half a future foresight skill, it had no downsides.

[Special Passive Skill: Sensory Enhancement] [Proficiency: 40%] [Enhances senses. Can feel things like vitality. Can also sense shapes. Can sense the unseen.]
The sentence "Can sense the unseen" has been added. If Taeyang's words were true, even enemies of the ghost type appeared in Alone Mode. Sensory enhancement could be a great strength when facing such things.

Four skills have changed:

"It's much faster than before."

Even when clearing Easy Mode, I had to go through all sorts of hardships to raise my skill level, and there were days when I spent all day just to increase it by 1%.

Unlike back then, it was an incredibly fast speed, perhaps because they were enemies of equal or greater strength.

"What should I raise?"

I can raise the proficiency of the skill to 48%. It was a very sweet time to make choices.

I'll ignore all the skills I just mentioned.

There are skills that can reach 100% proficiency, but they weren't worth raising at the cost of valuable P. At least Taesan thought so.

Proficiency varied for each skillâ€”some skills rose well, while others did not. He planned to raise the latter skills.

Naturally, his attention turned to Eye Lock Weaponry.

[Top-tier Skill: Eye Lock Weaponry] [Proficiency: 8%] [A technique that handles weapons and the body. It's still immature, so there may be loss in power transmission.]

The term "top-tier" indicated not just style, but Taesan saw it as the skill that had gained proficiency the slowest among all the skills he had.
Eye Lock Weaponry is a technique that moves the body.

Despite using it in every battle, it was only 8%.

"Hmm."

Taesan rubbed his chin. The skill changes its content when it reaches 20%.

Does Eye Lock Weaponry hold enough value?

It's a skill he doesn't know much about.

It could change, or it could remain the same. Even if it changes, it might not bring him significant benefits.

Since it's a very simple skill where damage is dealt even if attacking with parts other than weapons, its proficiency might only be related to damage.

Surviving was crucial right now.

Even if proficiency increased, there wouldn't be much change aside from ignoring damage for a while.

Taesan postponed his decision for now and checked other skills.

Surviving wasn't easy to raise in proficiency, but as mentioned earlier, raising it wouldn't make much difference.

Ignoring damage for a while certainly had its value, but he didn't feel it was worth spending points to raise.

"Increase Shield?"
[Special Passive Skill: Increased Shield] [Proficiency: 3%] [You have obtained a shield that blocks damage. Its value increases proportionally with your health.]

If I raise proficiency, the proportional value will increase. It's not bad, but something felt lacking.

Taesan couldn't easily make a decision. While pondering, he asked Ghost.

"Hey."

[Uh, yeah?]

Ghost, who seemed lost in thought, was startled.

[What is it?]

"What do you think about raising proficiency in Storm Scar's Sword?"

[Huh... without any conditions?]

"Yeah."

[... What are you talking about?]

Though puzzled, Ghost answered obediently.

[Setting aside whether that's possible, wouldn't it be rather ineffective?]

"As expected, do I have to learn it physically?"

[After all, it's swordsmanship. At first, I had to raise proficiency because I couldn't teach it, so there was no choice. Otherwise, you have to move your body no matter how much knowledge you have in your head; physicality is a separate issue.]

It wasn't unexpectedly a known issue.

Taesan continued to examine the skills.

Honest duel.

Vulnerable point attack.

Thirst for battle.

Thirst for victory, etc.
If I raise them, all these skills would be great. However, I didn't consider raising them.

"There are too many choices, which is the problem."

It was literally a happy dilemma. Thinking that it would be endless if he continued like this, Taesan turned his gaze to another skill.

[Magic] [Proficiency: 2%] [Can use magic. Right now, it seems I can only avoid embers.]

It's magic that he couldn't obtain at all in his previous life, and he doesn't know how it will change.

"Should I check it out?"

Since there's someone who can give him the answer, there's no need for him to worry alone.

Taesan returned to the 9th floor and went to find Rilis. As soon as they entered the safety zone, an explosion sounded.

"Kelock! Kelock!"

Rilis was in tears with white powder scattered around her.

"This combination isn't right... Huh?"

"Hello."

Taesan greeted her briefly.

"...You came?"

She blinked and looked up at Taesan, then quickly brushed herself off and stood up.

"You're here sooner than I expected."

"How much time has passed since I've been here?"

"I've long since forgotten the concept of time... It's been about a day or so, hasn't it?"
Here's the English translation of the text:

"The concept of time on Earth and here is the same. It wasn't very likely, but it could have been a problem if the axis had completely twisted. Fortunately, that didn't happen.

"Why did you come? Do you have something to show?"

"It's nothing special."

When asked about raising the proficiency of the magic skill, Rilis smirked.

"Why are you asking about that? It does change for sure... But to reach 20%, you'd have to struggle for years."

"There's a way to increase it."

"...Increase proficiency?"

Rilis's face twisted strangely.

"How do you increase that? Wait. Was that why you went outside?"

"More or less."

Not wanting to explain in detail, Taesan nodded vaguely. Rilis looked impressed.

"You can interfere with the labyrinth's system from outside? How did you find out? I've searched everywhere for something similar but found nothing."

"Isn't there anything like that?"

"Proficiency follows the labyrinth's rules. Even those without talent can become stronger here, but in a way, they're bound by the rules of this place. So no one should be able to interfere... What on earth? It seems unbelievable."

She still looked perplexed, as if she couldn't quite understand.
Here's the English translation of the text:

"Well then, how much is it?"

"About 50."

"...50%?"

Taesan nodded. Rilis fell silent.

For a moment, a dangerous glint passed through her eyes. Her pupils darted restlessly, then she managed to exhale as if calming herself.

"Phew. That was risky."

She wiped her forehead. Sweat was dripping, indicating a momentary turmoil in her mind.

"It's best not to tell anyone about that."

Contrary to her usual demeanor, her voice was serious.

"If they find out, there are plenty who would kill you for it. This place allows me to cut even my own fingers for just 1%, so keep it a secret."

"Is it really that serious?"

"Yeah. It's tough. I've only managed to get my magic to 20%."

She grumbled, but Taesan didn't quite grasp the significance. While proficiency at 50% was undoubtedly valuable, he knew several who had achieved 100%.

"Are you planning to use that magic?"

"I don't even know what magic is. For now, I'm just thinking about it."

"So that's why you came to me."

Rilis began to explain, nodding her head slowly.
Here is the English translation of the text:

"I haven't reached more than 20%, so I can't explain in detail, but as proficiency in magic increases, the versatility of magic usability improves, and the number of usable spells also increases. Right now, your proficiency is about 2% or 3%, right?"

"About that."

"Then you probably aren't fully utilizing the power of beginner spells."

"Stronger than this?"

Even now, it can deal damage close to 50. For Frost Arrow, it was cold enough to freeze moisture upon contact. Rilis said as if it were obvious.

"Even for beginner spells? The gods of magic themselves gave them the name 'beginner'. There's no way they'd be weak, right?"

"Maybe."

"About 20% or so. If I just reach my level, I can unleash its full power. And once it reaches 20%, the nature of the skill changes. The abilities gained reduce mana consumption and greatly increase power."

Rilis waved her hand. Her body became transparent. It was invisibility magic.

"Originally, I couldn't maintain it for long like this. It would disappear in about 10 seconds. And if someone had good perception, they could notice it right away. It changed like this the moment I reached 20%."
If what she said was true, it was a significant difference. Her current appearance didn't register to Taesan. Even though his sensory enhancement had evolved, not feeling her presence meant that without a specific method, he wouldn't sense it at all.

"Is it worth raising?"

"As I mentioned earlier, skills change in content every 20%. 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%. In the labyrinth, magic transforms into a total of five stages."

Rilis began her explanation.
