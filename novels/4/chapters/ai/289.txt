Chapter 290

290. Projection of Willpower (1)

Halfdan muttered to himself, lost in thought.

"That's the kind of power that's unattainable for mortals...".

"It's something you can only get in your own world."

Tai Shan said.

"So, I'll go back and check again, just to be sure."

"Hmm."

Halfdan stroked his chin, his smooth skin devoid of stubble. As he opened his mouth, he said:

"The next time I send you to my world, you'll be thinking about the depths, because if you don't have that level of strength, you'll definitely meet your demise."

The other being, a star, recognized Tai Shan. It had a definite emotion and was trying to kill him.

It was impossible to survive without the strength to tread the depths.

"If I had that kind of power... it might be possible..."

After a moment of contemplation, Halfdan said:

"But it's dangerous. You've managed to grasp your willpower, but you're not perfect at it yet. You might die."

"That's always been the case."

(Note: I've translated "하프란" to "Halfdan" as it is likely a character name, and "태산" to "Tai Shan" as it is also likely a character name.)
Here is the translation of the text:

As he descended into the labyrinth, he didn't have a single safe memory. He had always risked his life to win because he had such immense power.

This time, it would be no different.

Halfdan smiled slightly at the response of the Great Mountain.

"That's right. Then I'll do what's expected of me as a resident of this place and a adventurer."

[Sub-quest starts]

"The deepest part of my world. There is a spring of purity in the cave there. Go there and bring back the water of purity."

[Halfdan wants the water of purity that exists in the deepest part of his world.] [Condition: Bring back the water from the spring of purity in the deepest part of the world.] [Reward: Equipment created with the water of purity]

The Great Mountain nodded. The quest was accepted.

* * *

"If you bring it back properly, I will create equipment with the materials of the giant king and the ones you brought."

After Halfdan's words, the Great Mountain's physical body moved.

He arrived at the world that Halfdan had abandoned.

He stood on the vast land, and at the same time, the world began to shake.

Ggggggg!

The sky wailed, and the land creaked. A clear hatred began to target the Great Mountain.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tàishān's foot sank into the ground. At the same time, the earth lifted up.

Just like a tidal wave, it tried to engulf Tàishān.

As the earth's waves rushed towards Tàishān, Tàishān clenched his fist and struck out. The earth shattered and broke into fragments, scattering them everywhere.

Kuoooong!

The sky pressed down on Tàishān.

A tremendous pressure enveloped his entire body.

The remaining air congealed into dozens of storms, which instantly rushed towards Tàishān.

It was time to put his will to the test. Would his willpower, which he had gained, be able to affect the will of the stars themselves?

Tàishān focused his mind.

His concrete will was projected onto reality. Tàishān wished for the storms to collapse.

"Ah."

At the same time, a massive headache and a storm collapsed.

The collapsing storm trembled with unease. Tàishān yelled out, his will contained within.

"Explode."

With that cry, the storm dissipated.

It was clear: he could intervene in the will of the world itself.

However, the cost was extremely high. Despite having removed only one of the dozens of storms, his head felt like it was about to burst.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was difficult to write at the moment. At least, it was a story after the mount Tai had reached a higher level or had become more skilled.

Mount Tai burst through the storm and ran away.

"It's ultimately a question of strength."

One had to escape with physical strength, not willpower.

It was impossible to win. One could hold on for a while, but ultimately, they would meet their demise.

One had to avoid the fight altogether.

The most rational approach was to run to the destination of the quest without stopping. The stars were seriously trying to kill him, but he had become significantly stronger than before. He could probably hold on until he reached the destination.

However, Mount Tai was thinking of a different way out.

[You have activated your true nature.] [The stars' will. They are trying to kill beings that can breathe and live.]

True nature. It reveals the true nature of the opponent and also shows its weaknesses.

[The stars are searching for and killing opponents with wills, excluding themselves.]

The stars were not directly pursuing Mount Tai with their own eyes. Instead, they were tracking Mount Tai's will and killing him from afar.

The opponent with a will.

And Mount Tai could project his will onto the world.
(Note: The text appears to be a part of a fantasy story, and the translation may not be perfect due to the complex nature of the story.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"Can this be possible?"

He scattered his will.

He maintained his own self and influenced the world with his will. It was a very contradictory statement. He had abandoned his will to do something while keeping his self intact. It was generally an impossible thing.

But the current Taesan was possible.

Taesan opened his mouth.

"Scatter."

With those words, his will began to take shape. And then, a change occurred.

Kuuuuu!

The storm was still raging. The sky was crushing the earth, and the earth was rising like a tidal wave.

But the direction of that power was no longer chasing Taesan.

The tidal wave of the earth swept past Taesan's side. The storm was chasing a distant target and disappeared.

It seemed like they were just circling around Taesan without being able to pinpoint his exact location, and they couldn't catch up to him.

"Hoo."

Taesan's eyes lit up. The stars were unable to accurately track his location.

Taesan took a step back to confirm. He galloped across the earth at a rapid pace.

Kuuuuu!

The world was still targeting him. He was causing the earth to explode and bursting the air.
Here is the translation of the text:

But he didn't hit the mark exactly.

Taisan realized. The stars had roughly guessed his location, but they didn't grasp his exact position.

"It's like that."

Taisan's lips curled up.

* * *

It's not something that directly affects the world, so my headache was manageable. I could bear it this much.

And I roughly understood the application of concept skills.

"A declaration filled with intention."

It's not enough to simply concentrate one's intention. A declaration that determines the outcome was needed.

Upon reflection, I realized that all gods, when they act, do not simply rely on strength, but often utter words. This was true for the gods who defeated the demon and for the gods who tried to kill him.

At that time, I didn't attach much significance to it, but it seemed to be a necessary process.

Thanks to having scattered one's intention, the world's intention couldn't track him.

Therefore, he made a decision. Taisan took a step.

That direction was not the deepest part of the world.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the distance, there was a vast forest.

The first thing he brought from the world of Half-ran was the wild roots. It was the forest.

Tae-san arrived at the forest, but the stars were still not shining brightly enough for him.

Tae-san happily entered the forest.

[Broken branches] [Things from a decaying world. Alone, they are nothing. If planted in the earth, they will grow into a distorted tree.] [Dried soil in decay] [Things from a decaying world. Alone, they are nothing. If planted in this soil, they will grow into a distorted shape, losing their original appearance.]

Tae-san happily gathered the materials.

He didn't know how to use them, but Half-ran would be different. He would create excellent equipment with the materials he brought.

"Good job."

Kuku-kuku-kung!

As Tae-san cut down the tree and gathered the soil, his energy became even stronger. Tae-san avoided using excessive force and gathered the materials.

Having gathered enough materials, Tae-san moved on again.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

This time, he did not head to a deep place. The place he headed to was the tomb of the deceased king, which he had visited for the second time.

At that time, he was only concerned with the crimson coral, but looking back, there were also some other objects made of various materials. He thought about checking each one carefully.

The mountain rushed.

Then, the mountain was chased by the star, and it displayed its power.

Kuku, kuku, palace……

The ground was split in two. The sky drew closer to the earth, and the air grew more turbulent.

The star was clearly aware of the mountain and was trying to kill it, but it couldn't pinpoint its exact location.

"Why are you doing this?"

The mountain asked. There was no immediate response.

"Hey?"

[...?]

The ghost suddenly spoke up.

[You asked me that, didn't you?]

"Is there anyone else?"

The spirit, who was usually able to sense its location, had its location exposed at this place, and was forced to return to its original form. There were only the mountain and the ghost left.

The ghost seemed to be in a state of disorientation.

"After meeting the arrogant one, he became silent and unresponsive, and I couldn't help but wonder if he was thinking about something."

It was easy to guess the reason.
Here is the translation of the text:

The demon said to the ghost: "Three choices. Time is drawing near."

[I am a dead existence. I'm done with it.]

The ghost nodded quietly.

[Although I am bound by a contract with a magician and trapped in a labyrinth, when my wish is fulfilled, I can leave this world as a wandering soul. That's all I have. But what does it mean that I have three choices, which are worthy of being called choices?]

There was a complex emotion in the ghost's voice.

[And the things that are worthy of being called choices are not yet determined.]

The ghost's wish was simple: revenge against the one who killed him.

The fact that this ghost makes a choice means that something more important than revenge has emerged.

There was only one such thing.

Resurrection.

To escape death and return to the labyrinth once again.

If his expectation was true, it was a matter he had long been looking forward to. He could revive and descend into the labyrinth again.

Depending on the type of resurrection, he could conquer the labyrinth and fulfill his original wish.

To conquer the labyrinth and save his own destroyed world.

[But the gods wouldn't do such a thing.]
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The revival of the demon was something that gods themselves would not normally do.

Even if Mount Tai died, it would not try to grasp its soul with its own hands, and there was no god who would revive it.

In other words, the existence that revives the ghost is someone who will gain a considerable benefit.

Then, what does that existence want?

The ghost was puzzled by this answer. Mount Tai said:

"It's a story for later. Right now, it's a futile worry. Just relax and select what you want."

[……Yes, yes.]

The ghost let out a deep sigh. He also knew. He just couldn't come to a conclusion by himself.

His worries seemed to fade away, and he spoke in a bright tone:

[But still, it's a ridiculous power. The world itself fails to recognize you.]

"I think I know roughly where it is."

Kuku!

The land was still trembling around Mount Tai. Although the exact position was unknown, it seemed to know where Mount Tai was.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Let's compare it in a way that's easy to understand. What you've covered is like a human's perspective. It's like trying to catch a fly by flying around it with your eyes closed. You can sense the fly's location because of the noise it makes, but it's hard to catch it accurately. At least, ordinary people would say so."

"What's going on?"

"I'm not sure myself, but it seems like you're not targeting me properly. Of course, if you get really excited, the conversation might change, but it's not that intense yet."

So, there was no problem. He arrived at the tomb of the deceased king of the Taesan.

Let's go inside. Previously unseen things appeared.

"The Mask of Paranoia" [A mask used by the legendary courtesan who brought about the downfall of the world. No one, not even the royal family, was able to see her face. Her face became a secret that no one knew about because of the downfall of the world.]

We gathered each material item one by one.

Although Half-Ran didn't directly request it, the value of this item is low because it's essentially equivalent to getting something for free.

"This isn't how the original quest was designed, is it?"

A ghost chuckled.

The quest to bring about the downfall of Half-Ran's world, which requires the power to leap over levels.

The reward was equipment made from materials that exist in Half-Ran's world.
Here is the translation of the text:

The equipment that could be obtained in the labyrinth was extremely difficult to get. It was a reward that matched the difficulty level. As we entered Halfiran's world, we could make more and more equipment. However, as we went deeper into Halfiran's world, the will of the stars became increasingly stronger. If we couldn't beat the stars, we could only barely get the quest materials and escape.

In other words, the materials that could be obtained in Halfiran's world, excluding quest materials, were rewards that required defeating the will of the stars.

These materials were at the planetary level.

It was necessary to reach a level where we could defeat the will of the stars, surpassing the depths.

That's what Tai Shan did, obtaining it through unfair means.
