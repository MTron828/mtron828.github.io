**Chapter 270**

270. 61st Floor, The Testing Ground (1)

As soon as Taesan entered the 61st floor, the shop owner looked at him and smiled faintly.

"You've made it. What would you like to buy?"

"No, nothing."

Taesan shook his head. The 61st floor marked the beginning of a new theme. The equipment in the shop would also be upgraded to the next level.

However, Taesan had no intention of buying anything. He was about to enter the depths, and considering the prices of the equipment there, he needed to start saving up from now on.

The shop owner nodded as if he had expected this.

"This place is right before the depths. It's a unique spot. From here on out, the labyrinth will start to change little by little."

He gestured with his chin.

"You'll see when you get there. Win and triumph. I'll be watching from below."

Taesan replied with silence and left the shop.

He headed towards the corridor. Just as he was about to open the door in front of him, a system window suddenly appeared and stopped him in his tracks.

**[Special Quest Start] [Trial of God] [One week later. All adventurers of the labyrinth will move to the Colosseum.] [There are as many Colosseums as there are countries, and you can choose to visit another country's Colosseum if you wish.] [This quest cannot be refused.] [After moving to the Colosseum, proceed with the quest and receive rewards based on your achievements.]**

* * *

"It's starting soon, I suppose."

Taesan muttered to himself as he read the quest window.

Colosseum. It had only one meaning.

Arena. Player versus player combat.

Taesan opened his community window, and coincidentally, he received a chat invitation from Lee Tae-yeon. As soon as he accepted, familiar faces started chatting noisily.

**[Geum Jung-geun[Hard] : Uh... I don't get it. What's going on exactly?] [Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard] : Wait a minute, Jung-geun. I'm also getting a headache. Let's think about it for a bit.]**

People were scratching their heads, trying to understand the situation. There was no one from another country present yet.

**[Kang Taesan[Alone] : What's going on?] [Geum Jung-geun[Hard] : Ah, brother.] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone] : Mr. Taesan, do you know about this? We were suddenly given a quest called the Trial of God, but it's so sudden and unexpected.]**

They focused on Taesan's words, expecting him to know something since he had shown a direct connection with God in the past.

However, Taesan's words were laced with denial.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Kang Tae-san[Alone]: I don't know. If there's a god, there must be a few, but there's no reason for me to do this without an explanation.]

[Kang Joon-hyuk[Alone]: You're not kidding, right? Then who is this guy?]

Of course, Tae-san knew what was going on. He knew how things were progressing, who he was meeting, and what quests he was receiving.

But that was because he had traveled back in time, so he couldn't talk about it.

[Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: ...Is this some kind of trial that God is imposing on the entire labyrinth?]

[Kang Joon-hyuk[Alone]: It's possible. There's nothing meaningless about the gods' movements.]

[Geum Jung-gwan[Hard]: Well... let's investigate.]

They started discussing.

[Geum Jung-gwan[Hard]: The quest is a forced quest.]

[Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard]: If we call it the Colosseum, does that mean we're fighting someone?]

[Kang Joon-hyuk[Alone]: It's highly likely. The problem is who we're fighting... ]

There was a brief silence at his words. Lee Tae-yeon uploaded a post with a puzzled expression.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Maybe we're the only ones... it's likely, right?]

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: Then there's a problem. It wasn't said that each mode would be separated in this quest.]

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Um, I don't know either. It would make sense for each mode to be separated...]

[Kang Jun-hyuk [Alone]: God is not a being that pursues reason.]

Kang Jun-hyuk and Lee Tae-yeon, who had experienced God and overcome their trials, knew that God did not value the weak at all. They knew that God only cared about those they favored.

In the end, it was an unsolvable problem. In a week, the quest would begin, and they would find out.

It was more productive to discuss something that could be confirmed immediately.

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: What does it mean that we can choose a Colosseum and meet with the country we want?]

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: It means exactly what it says. We can meet with the country we want and proceed with the quest together.]

[Kum Jung-geun [Hard]: Then let's talk about it. If we can meet, it's better to meet.]

They could meet with people from other countries.

Their emotions were stirred by this fact, knowing that they were not the only survivors, but seeing it with their own eyes was a different story.

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: Let's contact them first. We'll discuss the details with them later.]

[Kang Jun-hyuk [Alone]: Okay.]

The story was slowly unfolding. When Taesan was about to leave the community, Taeyeon suddenly called out to him.

[Taeyeon [Alone]: Ah, Mr. Taesan. Haven't you had any news since then?] [Taesan [Alone]: What's going on?] [Taeyeon [Alone]: No, I mean, Amelia? That woman?] [Taesan [Alone]: Something came up, but I ignored it all.]

He had received several invitations to chat from her, but he had ignored them all, and now he saw that he had accumulated dozens of invitations.

[Taeyeon [Alone]: You keep asking me what Mr. Taesan is doing. I answered politely, so you keep clinging to Mr. Taesan...…] [Taesan [Alone]: We'll meet soon anyway. Let's just focus on our own work until then.] [Taeyeon [Alone]: Yes.]

Taesan left the community.

As he recalled, the only countries that had met at this Colosseum were Korea, the United States, France, and Japan. The other countries had either refused to talk or only met among themselves.

"I wonder what will happen."

The outcome would be completely different from his past life. That was what he was looking forward to.

**The Story**

Taesan finished his preparations and opened the door.

It was very spacious.

The room was as large as four basketball courts combined. And beyond that, a staircase leading down was visible.

This one room was the entire 61st floor.

Taesan instinctively realized.

He turned his gaze. A man was sleeping with his back against the wall in the corner of the room.

**"Just as I thought."**

Taesan approached the man. The man, feeling a presence, slightly opened his eyes.

**"...You're a stranger."**

The man slowly got up.

Wearing a tattered robe and a pointed hat like a wizard, he was about one head shorter than Taesan. His entire body was small and frail, as if he would collapse if pushed.

**"An adventurer?"**

Taesan nodded. The man opened his mouth.

**"Nice to meet you. I'm an adventurer who has walked the depths. And I'm the one who tests adventurers here."**

The man pulled out a staff. A withered and twisted wooden staff appeared.

**"I'm Beldegia, a wizard who has failed his duties. I'll be in your care for a while."**

[You have encountered a wizard who failed to rescue the princess.]

Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with!

* * *

The wizard who failed to save the princess. Beldekiya.

Taesan gazed at Beldekiya. Beldekiya looked back at him, belatedly noticing the presence of a ghost.

"A warrior?"

[It's been a while, Beldekiya.]

"......I see how it is. You were betrayed and killed, and made a deal with the wizard? That's why you're stuck with this adventurer?"

[No need to explain further. Yes, I was trapped in this labyrinth to seek revenge against those bastards.]

"That's too bad. I thought you could reach the end of the labyrinth. Even if it's a worthless clear, you can still find honor."

Beldekiya laughed. It was a hollow, eerie laugh that sent chills down his spine.

He clapped his hands.

"Well then."

He gazed at Taesan.

"You've made it this far, so you want to move forward from here?"

"Yes, I do."

"Good. Then what's your name?"

"Taesan, Gang Taesan."

"Ah, Gang Taesan. Did you check the system window when you entered this place? What was written there?"

"It said this is a place guarded by gatekeepers."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The labyrinth changes theme every 10 floors. The theme from the 61st floor to the 70th floor is the guardian.

"That's right."

Beldekia struck the floor with her staff.

"I am the guardian. I test whether adventurers who reach this place can proceed further or should be stopped here."

Beldekia smiled faintly.

"Don't you think it's correct to prevent them from having futile dreams if they're going to give up in despair anyway?"

"Then do I have to fight you?"

Taesan gazed at Beldekia with a mixture of annoyance and curiosity.

"I don't want to waste my energy on a futile fight."

"……Huh?"

A small light flickered in Beldekia's eyes.

"Amazing. You've realized it quickly, despite my efforts to hide it. The warrior next to you didn't even notice."

[It's noisy.]

The ghost grumbled. Taesan shook his head.

"Why are you, an adventurer, acting as a guardian in this place?"

Beldekia was a monster.

"Even in a weakened state, I could feel the power. The magician in front of me was strong. Even the Lion King and the Fire Spirit King would not be a problem for him. He had the power to crush and destroy them all.

'Maybe.'

He might have been an adventurer similar to Ainzhart.

"The reason is simple. I am a magician who has not fulfilled my duty and has not achieved my wish."

Beldegkia said with a smile.

"That's why I made a contract with the magician of the labyrinth. I thought it was a simple task."

He held up his staff, and his robe fluttered and shook.

"You don't need to know the rest. Anyway, do you want to go down?"

"Yes."

Taesan nodded. Beldegkia looked at him for a moment and then spoke.

"I won't stop you. It's your choice."

He tapped the floor with his staff.

"Then let's start the test."

[Sub-quest begins] [The 61st Floor Guardian. Magician Beldegkia tests those who come to this place. If you pass his test, you can receive a reward.]

"The contents of the test will be explained from now on."

Taesan waited quietly for the explanation. He had heard a rough outline from Lee Taeyeon, but she hadn't told him everything.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The weak do not have a reason to come down here. The place below is even more harsh and frightening. Rather than facing a futile death, it's better to stop and settle here. I am the examiner."

Beldekia pointed to the mountain with her staff.

"So, I will test you. It doesn't matter how long it takes. If you pass my test just once, that's enough."

"What is the content of the test?"

"You must have obtained many things while coming down from the labyrinth."

Beldekia opened her mouth.

"It could be swordsmanship or a skill. What I will test is the various powers you possess."

Beldekia continued speaking.

"How perfectly you can handle the powers you have. How far you've reached. I will test that. And if you pass, you can use it to overcome me and go down."

**The Test of Verdandi**

* You can choose one power.
* All other powers except the chosen one will be sealed.
* You must pass the test of Verdandi in that state. The test has stages.
* If you clear the test, you will be given a reward worthy of your efforts.
* You can challenge the test multiple times.
* You can continue to challenge by selecting a different power, and the value of the reward will increase as you succeed.
* You can only attempt the test once a day.
