93. Bequeseta, Lamb of the Masin (3)

A blue light flows over the sword. An undulating energy, like flames, envelops Garrant's sword.

"Is that Aura?"

[What? How do you know that?]

"Because I've seen something similar."

Given the existence of magic, there was no reason Aura couldn't be real. Taesan's curiosity was piqued.

"Come at me."

Taesan claps his hands with an interested expression. Garrant twists his mouth.

"Die!"

Garrant swings the Aura-infused sword. Taesan moves his sword calmly, while Garrant scoffs.

"You're like a stupid brute!"

Aura boasts absolute cutting power. Unless it's a legendary sword, a normal blade cannot hope to block it.

Clang!

But the sound of blades clashing rings out.

"What?"

Aura, a sword invisible at first glance, clashes with a blue-hued sword. Despite the fierce blue light engulfing Taesan's sword, it seems unaffected, not a single scratch appearing on it.

Clang.
Garrant hastily steps back. With eyes filled with astonishment, he gazes at Taesan's sword.

"What in...?"

"It seems it can't even break a sword."

[It's the pinnacle among swords in my world. Do you think a mere Aura can destroy it?]

The ghost grumbled.

[Even without that, weapons influenced by the Labyrinth's system are as sturdy as can be. It's hard to even scratch them with Aura.]

"You, you!"

Garrant denies the unfolding phenomenon and charges once more. The blue Aura growls like a beast.

Taesan does not intervene.

[Your first attack has been nullified.]

"Huh?"

Anetsha's pupils widen as she blocks her mouth.

In her eyes, Garrant seemed to stab Taesan's body, but it appeared as though the attack posture had returned as if time had gone back.

'Sorcery?'

Naturally, her thoughts went in that direction.

'...Magic that alters time?'

It was magic of a level rarely found even in that great tower.

Facing Garrant, Anetsha was more bewildered than ever. He had clearly stabbed Taesan. But upon regaining his senses, Taesan had returned to his posture before the attack.
"Th-this...!"

He stabbed the sword again.

[Your second attack has been nullified.]

And once again, it reverted.

Garrant's face turned grim.

Taesan moved his arm solemnly. Garrant reflexively moved his sword.

[Your third attack has been nullified.]

Even that reflexive attack was erased.

"Canceling attacks is quite a task."

Judging by their appearances, it seemed the people here couldn't see the system window.

Garrant's expression was growing increasingly desolate.

His attacks, his movements, all erased. Having experienced firsthand that even the results themselves disappeared, Garrant knew.

An entity meddling with time. As far as Garrant knew, the Archmage of the Tower. None but those who had approached the storm of magic could.

No, even they couldn't. Limited interference might be possible, but even the Archmage couldn't erase results like this.

"He's a monster!"
Whatever he did, he was facing death. Gripped by sudden fear, Garrant screamed and swung his sword.

"Aaaaaah!"

The sword swung wildly without any technique. Taesan sidestepped and extended his arm.

Swoosh!

The sword, infused with aura, grazed past his arm.

[You received 63 damage.]

"The damage is manageable."

It pierced through his defenses. A rough estimate suggested the weapon had nearly 200 attack power.

Garrant's sword looked impressive but wasn't quite a renowned blade.

In other words, it meant pure aura damage.

"Let's try a few things."

[You activated Evade. The next attack will be dodged.]

Taesan rushed towards the despairing Garrant.

* * *

Taesan engaged Garrant using a variety of skills. Reluctant to die, Garrant forced his feeble body to respond.

Activating Evade, countering, employing all sorts of magic to deal with the aura, he gathered various pieces of information.

"You can't ignore skills, it seems."
Evade and Counter. The two representative defensive skills activated normally. They effectively reduced the damage as expected. It meant that against aura attacks, there was no judgment beyond defense.

"It doesn't seem like he can change form, nor enhance his mind or body? Just a strong cutting force. Not much new here."

At this level, it seemed to be the limit.

Still, the cutting force was quite useful. Taesan could effortlessly cut through magic like Frost Arrows and freezing air itself, meaning he could deflect almost any attack.

"Not bad."

Taesan murmured, and Garrant's eyes were completely defeated.

His attacks suddenly veered off course, failing to land properly. Arrows of icy coldness emerged nearby, freezing his entire body, accompanied by interference in his mind.

Unable to even move, Taesan was faster and stronger than a swordmaster despite using magic.

"Above Swordmaster level..."

There was no way he could overcome such a foe. Garrant whimpered.

"Who are you...?"

"Let's save that for later."
Taesan pressed his hand against Garrant's throat. With his breath cut off, Garrant lost consciousness.

Anetsha, who had been watching, suddenly snapped out of it and approached.

"You... you're strong..."

"What level is this guy?"

"He's recognized even by the king, treated with respect wherever he goes, a swordsman."

She stared blankly at Taesan. Having witnessed the battle up close, she could calmly assess Taesan's strength.

He was indeed formidable.

An exceptional swordsman. Physical abilities unmatched even by swordsmen who use aura. And a magician capable of controlling time and extreme cold with ease.

Mastering just one of these would have been enough to make a name in the world, but he wielded both effortlessly.

"I've been entrusted to protect you," Taesan said calmly.

"It's my role to guard you."

Guard.

Anetsha's face trembled at his words.

She had lived alone for eight years. Every encounter had been an enemy, every interaction seemed driven by greed.

Taesan's words struck deep into her heart.

Gulp.

"Oh..."


Anetsha's tense stomach suddenly growled. Her face flushed red.

"Are you hungry?"

"...Yes."

Anetsha nodded slightly. Taesan waved his hand in the air.

"You have activated food production."

A pale stew appeared in a bowl. Anetsha's eyes widened.

"Eat. It might not taste great, but it'll fill your stomach."

"...You can create food too?"

"Yeah."

Anetsha let out a small gasp of amazement.

Even with her limited knowledge of magic, she knew it wasn't an easy task. Unless deeply immersed in creation magic, even summoning basic water was difficult, let alone producing proper food. It was unbelievable.

"Let's go inside and rest for a bit," Taesan said, leading her into the cave. Anetsha followed him eagerly.

Taesan avoided the bonfire and brought more bushes to make a makeshift bed.

"Since you must be tired, get some sleep."

"...Where are you going?"

"Not far. Just going to check the surroundings."

With a wave of his hand, Taesan exited the cave.
She stuffed it into her mouth absentmindedly.

"...Tastes bad."

But it's warm. The heat from the bonfire loosens her tense body. Suddenly, fatigue washes over her. She closes her eyes softly.

* * *

"This might take a while."

She knew it would be tough, but it was even harder than Taesan expected.

Finding living demons was difficult enough, and the fact that they were almost extinct had even bounties on them.

Taesan's quest was to take them to a this ش even ش; had اeven won who و them little evenif
[Your world is like that too, isn't it? No magic, no aura, no monsters. It's similar. I don't really know either. Rare are those who delve deep, and even rarer are those who wield aura.]

"You could just ask directly."

Taesan flicked his finger on Garant's forehead.

"Ouch!"

With a scream, Garant grabbed his forehead. A terrible pain spread through the impacted area.

"Hello?"

"...."

Regaining his senses, Garant looked at Taesan and bit his lip.

"So, what should I do?"

Garant had no intention of letting him live. He wouldn't vanish neatly like the previous hunters.

Unable to bargain with his life, Garant wouldn't easily spill information either.

Taesan, contemplating for a moment, belatedly recalled a skill.

"Why isn't this activating?"

[Special Permanent Activation Skill: Proof of Self] [What you've accumulated manifests around you.]

It was a momentum-like skill acquired while clearing the 20th floor, but no one he faced here felt intimidated. After a moment of reflection, Taesan realized.

"This is on manual. It should be an activation skill, not a permanent one."

Taesan complained briefly and activated the skill.

"Eu!"
The sound of swallowing breath echoed. Taesan looked down at Garant. Garant's face was pale and heaving.

Beyond the level of intimidation, it was suffocating to the point of death. Taesan halted the activation of his skill. Garant gasped roughly for breath.

"I can't use this."

He had intended to lightly frighten him with intimidation, but it would be futile if he died beforehand.

"Ah, ah."

Fear was evident in Garant's gaze as he looked up at Taesan.

"Who are you...?"

The moment Taesan activated his proof of self, Garant saw something immense.

It wasn't a mere human or demon, but something beyond such trivial concepts. Its existence alone compelled submission and choked the breath of anything living—it was an absolute entity.

Garant desperately opened his mouth.

"W-what do you want from me?"

"Hmm?"

Taesan's face froze.

"I have questions for you."

"A-ask anything. I'll answer everything."

Garant replied with a face gripped by fear, seemingly ready to disclose even what hadn't been asked.

'What is this?'
This skill cannot be activated at all times. It's not at the level of intimidation but rather a skill that must be sealed because it truly chokes one's breath to the point of death.

However, feeling something different, Garant, who had been keeping his mouth shut, was desperately trying to spill it out.

"I wonder if I can use it for this purpose?"

Taesan spoke up.

"Everything you know about Ora. Spill it all."
