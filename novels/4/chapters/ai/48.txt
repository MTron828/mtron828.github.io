Episode 49

49. 8th Floor, God of Trials. Arrogance (3)

A shadow appears on the 17th floor.

Kang!

It's heavy.

It was a tingling sensation that I hadn't felt in a long time. I could endure if I had to, but there was a difference in strength that would diminish over time.

"It's not an enemy judgment yet."

Taesan deflects the sword and moves. He attacks with the Storm Disaster sword. The shadow, bewildered by the unstoppable swordsmanship, makes a decision.

The shadow takes a firm stance and strikes down. With an attack that overwhelms with force, it could destroy swordsmanship and tactics alike.

"Hmm."

Taesan calmly steps back. The opponent's stats are higher than his. They also possess skills.

[The shadow has activated Strong Attack.]

They rush in with a rough momentum as if to finish with one blow. How to deal with such an enemy. He asks the question and finds the answer.

The opponent is a shadow. It's a clone of the one who broke through the labyrinth. Each has different patterns and movements. Intelligence also exists to some extent.

In that case, it's simple.

[You have activated Acceleration.]
Taesan rushed at his opponent. It was a charge that disregarded defense, akin to a suicidal act, causing the shadow to momentarily hesitate.

But only for a brief moment. The shadow immediately thrust its sword. If it had been so immature as to discard obvious vulnerabilities, it wouldn't have made it this far in the first place.

However, this time it was a failure.

[Your first attack has been completely nullified.]

The attack was erased. The shadow's body reverted to before swinging the sword.

Confusion could be felt even beyond the darkness. Taesan moved his sword. His first sword, Wolf's Fang.

After dozens of damage indicators appeared, the shadow barely regained its composure.

Clang!

It deflected the sword and stabbed at Taesan's neck. Once again, Taesan did not block.

[Your second attack has been completely nullified.]

The attack was erased. Taesan moved his sword. Instantly, over 200 damage was dealt.

[Passing the seventeenth trial. As a reward, Strength increases by 8, Agility by 9, Intelligence by 3, Mana by 10.]

He completely ignored the notification about increased attributes. Even seeing similar messages had become tiresome.

The spectating ghost let out a hollow laugh.
[It's a selfish skill that can't be found in the labyrinth. There's no countermeasure, right?]

Absolute Nullification. It erases the attack itself, but it wasn't considered particularly effective on its own.

To nitpick, skills like "Defer" forcibly delay attacks, and "Counter" are somewhat similar.

There were quite a few skills that interfered with the outcome of attacks.

Of course, Absolute Nullification had the distinct effect of completely erasing the outcome of an attack, setting it apart from other skills, but that wasn't its most important aspect.

The greatest advantage of Absolute Nullification was its ability to activate constantly.

When the skill activates, a system window appears. Since it's visible to the opponent, they can anticipate and respond in advance.

Taesan did just that.

When he saw elite goblins using "Defer," he quickly distanced himself and countered with arrows and fireballs to negate their delay.

Against the warrior goblin using "Strong Attack," he countered with "Counter."

Facing the goblin chieftain casting spells, he prevented spell activation each time the activation window appeared with mental magic.

All of this was possible because the activation of skills was visible to the opponent.
Each other's ability to respond quickly to the opponent's skills was also an important factor. Perhaps the designer of the labyrinth was aiming for that, as most skills that could interfere with the situation were skills that activated after the results were revealed in the system window.

However, Absolute Nullification was a skill that activated constantly.

It was a skill where the system window appeared after the results were obtained.

Unless the opponent had prior information, there was absolutely no way to respond.

And Absolute Nullification was a hidden skill that not even ghosts knew about.

In reality, it was fine to simply receive it unconditionally unless Taesan directly informed otherwise.

The shadow of the 18th floor appeared, but this time it wasn't much different. The opponent attacked with various skills, and Taesan abandoned defense.

"Your first attack has been nullified."

The attack was erased. Taesan poured everything onto the bewildered shadow. The shadow regained composure and attacked again, but once again it was nullified.

Another attack.

But this time, Taesan did not fall.

He endured this damage more decisively than on the 17th floor.

"You activated evasion."

But there was no problem. He stuck to the confused shadow and overwhelmed it. He used magic and skills to inflict damage.

The shadow fell.

And the shadow of the 19th floor appeared.
Here is the English translation of the text:

Once again, it rushes forward just like before. The shadow attacks. The attack is erased due to Absolute Nullification. Taesan counterattacks. In an instant, the damage window floods the field of view.

The shadow hesitates. But soon it attacks again immediately.

Second attack nullified.

This time, without hesitating, it attacks directly. Taesan retreats, gritting his teeth.

Based on the nullification of the attack, he launched a counterattack, but couldn't strike with as much force as before because the opponent attacked immediately without hesitation.

"From here on, it's for real."

Judgment was quick, as he survived up to the 19th floor in Alon mode.

The shadow charges. It strikes down with a speed difficult to react to.

Kaaang!

His arm is pushed back. His body begins to slowly give way.

It's strong. The difference is felt enough that fighting with strength alone would inevitably lead to defeat.

"[The opponent is an impossible foe to defeat.]"

Enemy assessment appears. Taesan pushes back with a strong attack and increases the distance.

"[Assessment unnecessary! You have not been discouraged against an opponent deemed impossible to defeat.]"

Enemy assessment bonus.

"[Your fair and square duel has activated.]"

A skill that boosts stats when it's a 1:1 situation.

"[Your thirst for battle has been ignited.]"
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

Skills that enhance everything when facing an enemy.

"[You have activated the scorn of the strong.]"

A skill that receives judgment bonuses when facing enemies.

Taesan clashes with his sword once again.

Kak!

He doesn't get pushed back like before. It's possible to engage in a somewhat equal fight.

Taesan, who has countless skills for dealing with enemies, found this advantageous. He pushes forward based on increased stats.

"[You have activated the burning wrath.]"

He uses magic. An explosion obscures the view. The shadow retreats and swings the sword roughly.

"[The shadow has activated relentless assault.]"

The sword leaves afterimages as it bends in all directions.

A skill that forcibly moves the body to cleave 270 degrees.

Although it has significant drawbacks, it's not a bad skill when visibility is compromised like this.

Taesan knew all the activation conditions and patterns of that skill. That it couldn't reach the back, and its range was limited to the upper body.

And that once activated, it couldn't be stopped midway.

He lowers his posture like grounding himself. The sword narrowly grazes past the tip of his nose.

"[40 damage to the shadow.] [30 damage to the shadow.]"

He stabs a sword into the ankle. The shadow screams in pain, trembling all over, but its hand does not stop. Taesan turns directly around and pierces its chest.

[Nineteenth trial passed. Strength increases by 10 as a reward. Agility increases by 12. Intelligence increases by 5. Mana increases by 10.]

Added to this are bonuses from the Rising Spirit and Nemesis Victory rewards. There's even a bonus from the Desire for Victory skill.

He became stronger in an instant. But it wasn't that easy.

The opponent, without being startled by absolute attack nullification, immediately launched an attack. It meant they had the ability to quickly find the correct answer even in sudden variables from the nineteenth floor onwards.

As Taesan anticipated, the next step is the limit.

A shadow appears.

Adventurer on the twentieth floor.

The shadow thrusts a greatsword toward Taesan.

[The shadow has activated Total Victory.] [No need for judgment! You repelled it with strong mental power.]

Total Victory. A skill that imposes overwhelming judgment against enemies with an overwhelming gap. Naturally, it triggers a Nemesis judgment.

Like the shadow on the nineteenth floor, activate skills to raise stats. The opponent, who was briefly observing Taesan, wields a greatsword.

Boom.

The sword, longer and thicker than a person, fills the room.

Clang!

His arm is pressed and his body is pushed back. Even with his stats boosted by skills, the gap is too large. Taesan strengthens his arm and kicks.

"[You have activated Acceleration.]"

Clang!

The blade of the sword sharpens as Taesan closes in on the shadow. Swinging his arm, he tries to strike Taesan's head with the hilt. Taesan rushes forward without slowing down.

"[Your first attack Absolute Nullification has activated.]"

The attack is nullified. Taesan drives the sword into the shadow's chest.

The shadow attacks with a fist clad in gauntlets.

This attack too is nullified. The damage indicator noisily obscures the view.

The shadow swings its elbow. Taesan activates evasion. The elbow brushes past his shoulder.

"[The shadow has activated Recoil.]"

"Ha."

For a moment, an intangible force pushes Taesan back. Taesan marvels at the forcibly widened distance.

"There's Recoil?"

A skill that pushes away with an intangible barrier proportionate to stats.

It was a skill Taesan learned quite late. But that wasn't the end.

"[The shadow has activated Continuation.]"

The shadow's hand moves. The greatsword leaves traces as it swiftly sweeps through the room.

"So there's Continuation too."

---

Superior compatibility of slashing. Attacks swiftly, unlike slashing, without restrictions on actions or range.

A sweeping sword strike forms a kind of shield. Taesan narrowly dodges and casts magic.

"[You have activated Madness.]"

Pause.

The tip of the sword trembles under mental interference. Taesan kicks without missing the opportunity.

[The shadow has activated Recoil.] [You have activated Acceleration.]

Piercing through the intangible barrier with speed. Depending on the conditions based on stats, it could be pierced by pushing away.

The shadow activates Flowing. Attack by piercing through with strong attacks. The opponent swings with the hilt.

[You receive 152 damage.]

The sound of damage echoes. As expected of an adventurer on the 20th floor, it was quite painful.

Continuing the battle, Taesan realized one thing.

'It's not a monster.'

Damage only occurs when attacked with a weapon equipped with attack power from outside. The opponent does not push with feet or shoulders. That meant they couldn't deal damage that way.

The opponent wields a greatsword. The advantage lies with the Lich.

Then it becomes simple. Just stick close and don't give them distance.

"[You have activated Fortitude.]" "[You have activated Spill.]"

Activating the skills beforehand, the battle begins. Unlike shadows, Taesan with his Irock martial arts can inflict damage regardless of where he strikes the opponent's body. He takes advantage of this and steadily wears them down.

However, the opponent wasn't idle either. An adventurer who had descended to the 20th floor in Alon mode couldn't be that weak.

The opponent sheaths the greatsword and draws out a longsword.

Taesan momentarily panics, as he didn't expect the opponent to change weapons like that. The shadow swings its sword regardless.

"[The shadow has activated Strong Strike.]" "[You have activated Strong Strike.]"

Clang!

Taesan is pushed back. If it's the same Strong Strike, it depends on base stats and mana consumption.

Taesan blocks with his sword and casts a spell. Frost arrows form in the air.

Thud!

The shadow narrowly avoids being hit. Seizing the opportunity, Taesan moves his hand.

"[The shadow receives 26 damage.]"

Damage is calculated. So far, he's dealt close to 1,000 damage. The opponent on the 19th floor had around 1,100 health.

It's almost over.

Taesan abandoned his defense. The longsword pierced Taesan's shoulder.

"[You receive 210 damage.]" "[You have activated Unyielding Will.]"

Instead, he pushes his body forward, driving the sword deep. Ignoring the sharp pain, he manifests magic and swings the sword.

The shadow draws out the greatsword.

Taesan activates Strong Strike.

Kaaah!

With almost all his mana behind the blow, the greatsword rings loudly.

The shadow attempts to push back using Repel, but Taesan sticks close with Accelerate.

The sword pierces through the shadow. The shadow retaliates. Taesan's robe flutters.

"[You have activated Robe of Darkness.]"

Robe of Darkness.

Effect: Invisibility for 1 second.

As his body disappears, the shadow's sword pauses. He seizes the moment of hesitation.

Alongside consecutive system windows appearing, the shadow disappears.

[Passed the twentieth trial. As a reward, Strength increases by 12. Agility increases by 13. Intelligence increases by 10. Mana increases by 14.] [Your Spirit Rise is triggered. Proficiency in Strong Strike increases by 7%.] [Your Spirit Rise is triggered. Acquired special activation skill [Repel].] [Your Spirit Rise is triggered. Strength permanently increases by 8. Agility permanently increases by 8. Mana permanently increases by 10.] [Your Thirst for Victory is triggered. Strength permanently increases by 8. Agility permanently increases by 9. Stamina permanently increases by 10.]

Victory achieved.

The system window appears loudly. Beyond it, another shadow appears.

Clank.

The sword rings.

A fierce pressure overwhelms Taesan. In sheer intimidation alone, he loomed larger than anyone he had seen.

Taesan chuckled.

"Here ends."

It's no longer feasible. Breaking through the barrier would make him incomparably stronger. Even the 20th floor was precarious; it seemed unlikely he could defeat the 21st floor.

His current limit is the 20th floor. He understood it clearly.

[The Trial of Arrogance concludes.] [Arrogance falls silent in response.]
