59. Easy Mode. Choe Jung-hyuk (3)

Before facing those trying to kill him, Taesan grabbed Jung-geun and Hwi-yeon by the collar.

"Huh?"

Jung-geun, bewildered, was sent flying into the sky.

"Whoa!"

They were forcibly landed on the rooftop of a building. Taesan soon brought Itaeyeon and Kang Jun-hyuk there as well. Kang Jun-hyuk, dragged along, stared blankly at Taesan.

"Why so fast?"

Even he had surpassed human limits in his own way, but he hadn't seen the entire process of being grabbed and moved to the rooftop.

"Wait here since you'll be in the way."

As Taesan prepared to descend, Jung-geun hastily grabbed him.

"Just a moment. With that number, it could be dangerous. Minimum damage..."

As Jung-geun spoke, he sensed something odd.

"Huh?"

Taesan hadn't received any damage from the iron bars. Taesan drew his sword.

"Just a moment."

Kim Hwi-yeon spoke with a trembling voice. Her shaking eyes were fixed on Taesan.

"I know your heart."

Taesan calmly replied.
"But there's no need to protect."

Taesan returned to the ground.

Those surrounding him hesitated.

"What are you just looking at!"

Choe Jung-hyuk shouted roughly.

"Kill him!"

* * *

Upon arriving at City Hall, they found it unexpectedly deserted.

Since no particular quest had started, all they could do was wait quietly.

"This is boring..."

"Is there no internet?"

As they tried to alleviate their boredom in some way, a commotion erupted outside. The sound of hundreds of people gathering and talking could be heard.

"Is there some kind of speech going on?"

Just when they were getting bored, they gathered together. Among them were hundreds of armed individuals and one man surrounded by them.

"Huh?"

"Are they fighting?"

They murmured cautiously. Some among them recognized Choe Jung-hyuk's face.

"What's that bastard up to now?"

Amidst voices mixed with surprise, people started to gather. Under the scrutiny of thousands of eyes, Choe Jung-hyuk twisted his lips.

"Well, that's better."
No matter how strong the opponent is, with this many numbers, there's no way we'll lose. So, from now on, let's just go full terror politics.

By boldly confronting them, showing that we can trample hundreds of humans underfoot, everyone will follow his lead. That was his plan. Taesan understood that through Choe Jung-hyuk's face.

He's not wrong.

If it were Itaeyeon or Kang Junhyuk, they'd have a tough time against those numbers. They might even lose.

"But not me."

Taesan grips his sword.

Choe Jung-hyuk shouts,

"Kill them all!"

"Waaaah!"

With a roar, they charge towards the oncoming crowd. The ghost lets out a sneer.

"Really? You're trying to attack me at that speed?"

They're so slow.

Moving at the same speed as ordinary humans, they seemed almost frozen.

As they closed in, Taesan moved his hand. In an instant, his hand disappeared, only to reappear accompanied by numerous system windows.

"Urrgh!"

"Aaargh!"

"[Do Minjun takes 50 damage.] [Lee Seojun takes 36 damage.] [Seo Doyoon takes 54 damage.] [Lee Siwoo takes 33 damage.]"

...

"What, what?"
The shocking damage amazed everyone. For Easy Mode, who hadn't even reached double digits, it was truly an astronomical figure.

Taesan grimly moves his sword again.

Everyone nearby is cut down and falls.

"Ah...."

In just a few seconds, several lives were lost, without any response.

Stuttering, Choe Jung-hyuk shouts,

"Murderer!"

Those shaken by the sudden deaths echo,

"Murderer!"

"Mass murderer!"

Under hundreds of accusations, Taesan lifts his sword grimly.

"So what?"

He kills someone. His emotions are submerged, unable to hurt him. The deaths of humanity and all who knew him had no great significance.

Moreover, these hundreds are Chi Jung-hyuk's gang, people who have killed people without much kindness.

Taesan kicked. People thought he disappeared for a moment. When he showed his face again, they were behind him.

Chya-jak!

With countless damages, people fall without screaming.

Ignoring himself, people rush toward Taesan with screams like screams.
Taesan did not dodge their attacks. He simply cut and stabbed those attacking him.

A spear strikes Taesan's chest. The face of the attacker lights up.

"[Kang Taesan's Block] has been activated. [0 damage to Kang Taesan]."

"Cough, cough."

Taesan swings his sword, slashing through them. Numerous spears and blades touch Taesan, but no damage is inflicted. Watching this, Choi Jung-hyuk curses.

"It should at least show '1'! Why isn't it showing anything!"

No matter how high the defense, there should be at least minimal damage.

Even if hundreds struck at once, it could be threatening due to the hundreds of damage inflicted.

However, Taesan possesses a blocking skill that nullifies damage below a certain threshold.

There is no way for them to inflict damage on Taesan.

Crack.

Dozens of people fall once more. A ghost sighs.

"Is this all you've got? It's frustrating to death."

"They're already wiped out, aren't they?"

With a casual response, Taesan kicks again.

"Oh, can't see......"

Kwaaaang!

With a roar, the ground shatters. Those watching doubt their eyes at the force creating a crater.
Taesan began to kill each of those nearby. He grabbed the neck of a man who looked malicious. The man's face turned pale.

"Wait, hold on!"

Ignoring the plea, Taesan snapped the man's neck. He had killed hundreds of people, like the noisy staff officer next to Choi Junghyuk. There was no reason to spare them.

"This is a nightmare!"

Choi Junghyuk shouted with denial.

Hundreds of people were overwhelmed by one person alone. This was not guerrilla warfare but a straightforward power struggle.

They couldn't chase after his movements, and they couldn't block his attacks. Their attacks were completely blocked.

"Shoot arrows! Throw nets! Use potions!"

They desperately shouted commands, but following them was meaningless. Arrows bounced off harmlessly, nets tore like spiderwebs. Even doping with potions and blocking his path with force proved futile.

The expressions of those who watched in admiration around gradually hardened. They staggered back, their faces filled with horror.

If they were like this, there was no need to mention those participating in the battle.

Taesan brushed off his sword.

"Anything more to do?"
Before they knew it, nearly half of the people had died. Hundreds perished in just a few minutes.

"Ah, ahhh!"

Screaming, they fled. Whether it became a fuse, the crowd disappeared into chaos.

There was no need to chase after them. They were just wobbling like transient creatures. It would be a waste of time to pursue and kill them.

Approaching Choi Junghyuk, who sat stunned, he grabbed him by the hair.

"The dream is over."

"...I can't believe it."

Everything he had built up until now was shattered by just one person.

"Why... why does someone like you exist!"

Despair echoed in his cry. Taesan replied to Choi Junghyuk's hateful gaze.

"I've told you that before."

"What?"

"And you died like this. Farewell."

Choi Junghyuk's body collapsed.

For a moment, the man dominated the easy mode.
They avoided them, engaged in guerrilla warfare, went down the maze, and became stronger, so after months of fighting, they could win. But now that the stats themselves were so different, they could be dealt with at once.

Taesan absentmindedly withdrew his hand and looked around.

Those who met his gaze shivered in fear. He glanced at them for a moment as they desperately averted their eyes, then climbed back onto the roof.

"Are you okay?"

"Uh, yes. Yes..."

Itaeyeon replied absentmindedly. Kim Hyun bit his lips.

"You...."

Her eyes, having seen the bodies, were endlessly shaking.

She couldn't accept killing people. Hard mode was difficult enough as it was, and the atmosphere of mutual hostility would only intensify.

But they would have to get used to it.

"There will probably be more incidents like this in the future. If we get stuck on every single one, we won't be able to move forward."

Itaeyeon and Kang Junhyuk were still dazed. It seemed they needed some time before they could engage in proper conversation.

"For now, let's take a break."

Taesan looked down at the people.

Their gaze towards him was that of seeing a murderer.

"You must have a headache."

* * *

In a wide park, Taesan stood alone by a tree. Junggeun approached him.

"You look lonely."
"I'm fine."

Taesan replied indifferently.

"No one's asking me to teach them for no reason. I'd rather be on this side. Are you okay with that?"

"Yeah, well, since you saved my life, I shouldn't fuss about stuff like that."

Junggeun shrugged nonchalantly. It wasn't just talk; he really seemed unaffected.

"I roughly know who those guys are over there."

"What about Itaeyeon and Kang Junhyuk?"

"They're resting right now. They said they'll be here soon."

"Tell them to take it easy."

Itaeyeon was particularly fragile. Seeing numerous bodies had likely taken a toll on his psyche.

"Hyung."

Junggeun asked with a concerned expression.

"Are you okay?"

"How do I look?"

Taesan retorted unexpectedly. Junggeun lowered his head as if it was a pointless question.

"You seem fine. I would've been quite shaken if I were you... Is it because of Hard Mode?"

"That doesn't matter."

Although he had accumulated experience, he couldn't reveal everything. Junggeun, who had been staring at him oddly, soon spoke with a stern face.
"Hyung-nim. But things could get complicated. Right now, Miss Hwiyun and others are talking about you..."

"Not necessary."

Taesan casually cut off Junggeun's words.

Just ordinary words from many people.

They didn't evoke any particular response from Taesan.

"And soon, they won't be able to make a fuss."

It was almost time for the special quest to begin.

* * *

"You can't just sit still!"

A middle-aged man slammed the desk forcefully. His resolute face showed strong determination.

"We must definitely punish that man!"

"..."

Hwiyun pressed her forehead. She sighed deeply from the bottom of her heart.

"I shouldn't have called him."

Hundreds of people had died. And they weren't killed by monsters but by someone like them.

Amidst the chaos, Hwiyun tried to salvage the situation somehow. They needed someone to discuss, like a member of parliament or a representative of a civic group. Hwiyun deeply regretted her choice now.

"He killed people."

A stern-looking woman with a somewhat mischievous demeanor spoke. Back when the world was intact, she had been respected as a representative of a civic group.

"He must be punished by law."
"Correct. No matter how dire the situation is, there are things that must be upheld for humans to remain human."

"Him?"

Hwiyun smirked with a bitter smile.

"He's capable of facing hundreds of players alone, and he must be punished, even if I can't handle him right now. Is that what you're saying?"

"Yes, that's right. Despite the fear of monsters, law and order must be established."

Naturally agreeing with the necessity of it made Hwiyun dizzy. She struggled to convince them somehow.

"First, the start of the battle was Choi Jung-hyuk. He was the one who initiated it. He took players in the alone mode hostage."

While the shock of someone dying was shocking, Taesan did nothing wrong in essence. He was attacked and simply retaliated. If it had been in the past, it was an inevit even
"You mentioned you're a college student, right? Then there's a lot you probably don't understand. The world shouldn't be ruled by brutes who think they can dominate just because they're strong. Our world has been maintained by suppressing such individuals with laws."

"...But that world has already collapsed."

"We need to rebuild it ourselves. Do you intend to live like beasts?"

Hwiyun was annoyed by the patronizing tone, as if calming a child.

The people she was conversing with were members of parliament, representatives of civic organizations, and others with many followers.

Naturally, even within the labyrinth, they had numerous followers. They were like fledglings scavenging for food, not entering the labyrinth under their escort and assistance alone.

Perhaps that's why they were so oblivious to the current situation. The monsters were powerful. No matter how hard they fought, the old world could never return.

Yet here they were, clamoring for punishment under Earth's laws, treating Taesan as if he were their last hope.

If they were to punish him, who would do it?

If Taesan were to unleash his anger and attack them, who would stop him?

Who could possibly handle the power of such absolute beings?

They had no such thoughts at all. They merely wanted to regain the power they once held.
Hwiyun closed her eyes against their visible desires.

"Is this how Taesan sees me?"

She spoke, feeling suddenly self-conscious. It was a moment where she desperately tried to persuade herself.

\[Special Quest Initiated\] \[First Wave Begins\]

The quest window appeared before them.
