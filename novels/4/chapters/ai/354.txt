Chapter 355

355. 75th Floor, Wandering Planet (2)

Rumble!

Lightning strikes down. The wind becomes a hurricane, blowing fiercely and causing the earth to collapse, as if trying to swallow the mountain whole.

The mountain stomps its foot, crushing the collapsing earth. It dodges the lightning and punches the hurricane away.

The mountain makes a quick judgment.

At this rate, clearing the stage wouldn't be difficult.

So, instead of getting fixated on clearing the stage, the correct answer was to identify what could be gained to the maximum.

The mountain starts exploring its surroundings instead of heading towards its destination.

[You have activated the Leraize's domain detection.] [You have activated the concentrated detection.]

The mountain continues to use its detection power to grasp its surroundings, obtaining overall information from the sky to the depths of the earth.

But nothing comes out.

This place is really empty.

"There's really nothing here."

[It's a place where life can't survive. While there may be cases where something can be gained even in such a space, it doesn't seem to be the case here.]

The mountain takes a step forward, expanding its search range even further.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And the abandoned planet was extremely annoyed by Taesan's behavior.

The planet, filled with anger, dropped a lightning bolt. Taesan drew his sword.

Ka-a-a-ang!

The lightning bolt collided with the sword and scattered in all directions.

"There's nothing here either."

Taesan didn't even bother to react to the planet's attack.

The planet grew even more enraged at his behavior.

Strong emotions and a fierce determination emerged.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The ground cracked and collapsed, creating a massive hole the size of a large city.

Ku-rur-rung!

The lightning bolts fell like crazy, scorching the earth. The wind became a hurricane, and the fragments of the earth flew violently through the air.

It was literally a scene of destruction.

And on the collapsing ground, Taesan stood firm without a single waver.

Thanks to his special skill, Balancing, which helped him maintain balance in any situation, his posture didn't falter even in the slightest.

The ground collapsed according to the planet's will. The collapsing ground rose again according to the planet's will, trying to swallow Taesan. At that moment, Taesan activated his skill.

[You have triggered an earthquake.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The land that tried to swallow the Taesan Mountains was cancelled out along with the earthquake caused by the Taesan Mountains.

In an instant, the realm of the collapsing earth was transcended.

The planet became like a dog chasing a chicken.

"It's far inferior to Halfra's world."

[That's unique. It's almost impossible for a star to have immortal-level power from the start.]

Immortal means exactly that - immortal.

They don't have a concept of lifespan. They exist forever until they meet a physical or mental death.

However, planets all have a lifespan. From a human perspective, it may seem ridiculously long, but in other words, there is an absolute, unavoidable fate.

To that extent, planets cannot have immortal-level power.

Halfra's world was an extremely rare exception that broke that condition.

[But that doesn't mean it's weak...].

75th floor. Just looking at the quest conditions for the deep layer, you could tell. Even a moderately skilled deep-layer adventurer couldn't defeat the planet's will.

The problem was that Taesan wasn't an ordinary adventurer.

"Let's keep searching to see if there's something more."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Conquering was not even a problem. Taesan thought that there must be something to gain from the planet, and he was determined to find out to the limit.

And the planet was driven to madness by Taesan's appearance.

The planet had gathered adventurers here to clear the 75th floor, and it constantly tormented them.

But the result was always the same. The adventurers either succeeded and returned to the labyrinth, or they died and disappeared here.

In the end, nothing was left beside the planet.

It was too empty.

The planet, which couldn't endure, eventually developed a certain value system.

The existence of mortality. The adventurers were no more than toys to play with.

Living beings are weak and fragile. They can't even withstand their own light play and collapse.

I am far stronger, greater, and superior to those kinds of existences.

Yes. Life is unnecessary. I am perfect on my own. Life is just a toy to express my perfect emotions.

That was the planet's absolute value system.

The distorted emotions had taken away even the planet's original admiration and envy for life. It was also the pillar that supported the planet's spirit."

Note: The translation tries to maintain the original tone and nuance of the text, but some phrases may have been adjusted for better readability in English.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But the planet was unable to do anything about the Taesan.

It wanted to deny it, but it felt so certain that it couldn't be helped. The fact that Taesan was stronger than itself was undeniable.

The planet let out a fierce cry.

Its emotions were in turmoil, and everything was distorted. Until now, the planet had never used its full power to torment an adventurer. It was because it was too difficult to deal with the aftermath from the planet's perspective.

But this time, it was determined to kill Taesan with all its might, without thinking about the consequences.

"This is insane."

Even so, it couldn't reach Taesan.

Taesan muttered to himself, unleashing his power. He blocked the planet's attack, which was a combination of dark magic and magic.

The land, unable to withstand the force, began to collapse.

If it collapsed like this, it would take at least several hundred years to recover. If it went wrong, the contract with the wizard could be broken, and it could be expelled from the 75th floor.

But the planet only thought about killing Taesan.

[This reaction is too different from my time.]

The ghost let out a sigh. He was certainly strong, but he wasn't as exceptional as Taesan is now.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

When he cleared the 75th floor, the planet ridiculed and attacked him as if playing a prank, but he barely managed to fend it off with his life on the line.

However, the planet facing Taesan revealed all its emotions and was determined to kill him.

But Taesan easily blocked all those attacks.

It was almost time. The finish line was just ahead.

Taesan took a step forward. Using acceleration and skill acceleration, he burst through the planet in an instant.

The planet, realizing Taesan was about to clear it, hastily gathered all its strength, but it was no match for Taesan's speed. The planet's defenses were breached, and Taesan broke through.

Taesan was almost at his destination.

In the end, the planet couldn't hold back.

Kiiiiing!

With a loud roar, the ground in front of Taesan collapsed, revealing a pure white will within.

Taesan, who had experienced this before, immediately realized that this white will was the will of the world itself.

The will gathered its strength and burst forth. The power of the world itself was concentrated, trying to crush Taesan.

But compared to the power of the destroyed world of Halfra, it was ridiculously weak.

That was enough to break through. Taesan swung his arm.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You activated the Magic Overlap.]

You overlapped the Starlight Arrow three times and then detonated it.

[You activated the Magic Release.] [You activated the Forced Amplification.]

The Starlight Arrow was fired.

It collided with the power of will, and the world turned white.

Kugugugugu!

The planet was shocked. The power used to reveal its true form was being destroyed by the Starlight Arrow of Taesan.

The planet made a decision.

There's no turning back now.

Even if it means collapsing itself, it will definitely kill Taesan. With determination, it moved its true self.

Kuuuuung!

The planet began to collapse.

The sphere cracked, and the core twisted.

The earth rose up, the air trembled, and the atmosphere collapsed.

The scale of this attack was different from anything before.

Literally, everything on the planet was charging at Taesan.

The weight of the continent crushed Taesan, and the planet's atmosphere condensed to engulf him.

If we only consider pure physical strength, Taesan was above any existence he had faced.

But it was not a level that could be overcome.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I pour strength into my feet and charge forward.

[You have activated Gale Step.] [You have activated Skill Acceleration.]

I rush forward like a storm, crushing the earth. The great mountain trembles beneath my feet.

[You have activated Boundary Transcendence.] [You have activated Magic Overlap.]

I overlap earthquakes and unleash them towards the earth.

[You have activated Magic Release.]

The earth, like a wall, collapses.

The broken cube-like fragments scatter and create a path.

Tat.

The great mountain stamps its foot. The planet's will bursts forth in fury, releasing its power.

The great mountain wields its sword.

Kagagak!

The powers collide, and the shockwave spreads in all directions.

The great mountain imbues its sword with power, forcibly pushing back the planet's power. At the end of the breakthrough, the planet's will is revealed.

The will is trembling violently.

The power is raging out of control, and even the great mountain can sense the intense emotions.

How!

I am a great star. I am a planet. Humans are but mere dust to me."

Note: The text appears to be a fantasy or sci-fi passage, and some of the language and imagery may be quite vivid and dramatic. The translation tries to convey the sense of power and intensity in the original text.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That was the power that I had prepared for collapse and unleashed. A human who couldn't even reach the dust was trampled by their own power and had to die.

But Taesan pierced through that power and reached right in front of me.

This is impossible!

The intense emotions of denial and resentment gathered together, making my heart flutter. But I shook my head lightly to shake it off.

Taesan's sword had a gray color, with black and golden hues overlapping.

The planet also didn't stop.

And at the moment it clashed with the boundary, the planet's power warped.

Kwajik.

The sword pierced the planet's will. The gray light burst forth, dyeing the world.

* * *

[You...].

Balbambara couldn't continue speaking. Taesan sat in front of him with a calm face.

[I wish you would clear it like others do.]

In the end, Balbambara couldn't hold back and said it. It was something he shouldn't say as the administrator of the labyrinth, but he couldn't bear not to say it.

The 71st, 74th, and 75th floors were changed because of Taesan.

It was unprecedented for three floors to change in such a short period of time."

Note: " Kwajik" is an onomatopoeia that is difficult to translate, but it's meant to convey a sense of a powerful and sudden impact.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's me who creates a place and concept that fits the floor. Do you know how hard it is?"

Balbambara said, looking tired. They were already busy creating a new 71st floor, and now another floor had been added on top of that.

Moreover, that floor was the 75th floor. It was a floor that had never changed since the labyrinth was created, but now it had to be remade due to Taesan's actions.

"I'm sorry, but it's not something that can be done easily."

[I know. It's just a simple complaint. I suffered so much when designing the labyrinth, searching for that planet, but now it's become useless.]

"That floor was that old?"

Taesan was slightly surprised. He knew that the floor had existed since the era of the ghosts, but he didn't expect it to be a quest that had been set up since the design phase.

"What's going to happen to the planet now?"

At the same time as the boundary line pierced the will, the quest completion window appeared.

Thanks to returning to the labyrinth immediately, Taesan didn't know the result. Balbambara answered.

[It didn't disappear, but it suffered a difficult-to-recover damage. Its ego must be broken. At least, it can't fulfill its role as a floor of the labyrinth.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The abandoned planet could no longer remain as a layer of the labyrinth.

It was a story unrelated to Taesan and the great mountain. He had only responded to the planet's attack.

[Well, good luck. I'll go find out quickly.]

Balbambara grumbled and left.

Anyway, Taesan cleared the 75th floor and received a suitable reward.

[Ring of the World's Core] [HP + 2,500] [MP + 500] [Attack + 150] [Defense + 150] [A ring that compresses and refines the world's core. Although the craftsmanship of the refiner is quite immature, resulting in a lot of lost power, the power contained within is still extremely strong.] [Staff of the Demon King's Contractor] [Dark Magic + 330] [Magic + 500] [Spellcasting Speed + 15%] [A staff wielded by one who had a contract with the Demon King of the demon world, who was once more powerful than anyone. Although those who made contracts with demons were said to meet a miserable end, that didn't apply to the Demon King's contractor.]

The ring simply had high HP, MP, and attack power. It was easy to understand, and its performance was certain.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The secret reward, the staff, was not particularly special as a staff of dark magic. It would be enough to offer it to the demon god as a tribute.

But what I obtained was not just that.

Although there was nothing on the abandoned planet, I obtained something.

[Special Passive Skill: World's Rival] [Proficiency: 1%] [One who has fought against the world itself. When opposing the world's will, increases one's strength and all stats. Additionally, can directly read the will contained in the planet's power.]

The Immortal Rival I obtained on the 74th floor. It was a skill that seemed to be converted to a global scale.

"I can use it in Halfra's world."

Currently, Taesan couldn't guarantee that he could surpass Halfra's world.

But if he obtained related skills and grew stronger little by little, he would eventually reach a possible level.

Taesan headed towards the 76th floor.

The start of the 76th floor.

And the demon god said that they were waiting for him here.

Taesan brushed past the shop owner and entered the 76th floor.

There, he felt many presences.

"Why are there so many?"

Taesan muttered to himself as he entered the area where he felt the presences.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There were many guides of evil paths.

[You encountered the Black Twin.] [You encountered the White Twin.] [You encountered Gwonseong, Altair.] [You encountered Cliff, the ruler of the dark abyss.] [You encountered Esteban, the lord of the echoing valley.] [You encountered Floria, the starlight flash.] [You encountered Gloria, the warrior of the great holy one.] [You encountered Helia, the most noble one.]"

Note: The text appears to be a list of encounters or meetings with various characters, each with a unique title or description.
