580. Beyond (2)

The Higher Beings.

Beings that shatter the universe and even contend with transcendents.

Tae San had shown no particular interest in them. At that attitude, the Higher Beings felt humiliation. A feeling of fury enveloped Tae San.

The emotions of several Higher Beings. It would be enough to cause a stir in the universe and distort concepts.

"Disappear."

Tae San lightly waved his hand.

With that, emotions were torn and shattered. They didn't even leave a trace and were extinguished.

Step.

Tae San steps forward.

And the Higher Beings retreat that much.

Tae San looked at them and said,

"If you have no intention of fighting, then get lost. I have nothing to see from you."

Now, Tae San was a being of a different league.

He had swallowed up the Higher Beings and obtained countless powers, but it was something more fundamental than that.

Tae San had reached a level higher than the Higher Beings in a true sense.

It was an impossible gap that couldn't be described as simply being stronger or superior. He was just simply above them.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You're nothing to me anymore."

A calm, but brutal truth.

The gods felt a strong sense of humiliation at those words.

But they couldn't attack Taesan.

They could sense it too. Taesan had reached a higher level.

It wasn't about grasping numerous concepts or possessing immense physical strength.

He simply stood above them, purely and simply.

Kukukuku......

The gods began to retreat one by one. Those who had never backed down in their wars against the Transcendents, turned their backs and distanced themselves from Taesan, like cowards.

Taesan ridiculed them.

"Fools."

Although Taesan had surpassed them, the gods were still strong. If they all combined their strength and attacked Taesan, they could threaten his life.

But the gods couldn't do that.

Because they were cowards.

With their characteristic of being indestructible and immortal, they had intervened in the universe without hesitation, but they couldn't recklessly challenge Taesan, who could kill them.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Boring guys."

Taesan muttered. He could have chased away the retreating gods and eaten them all, but he didn't think about doing that now.

He had to focus on something bigger.

Taesan raised his gaze.

From the moment he stepped into the gods' realm.

And until now.

He felt a gaze directed at him.

It was hard to call it a gaze. It was too big and enormous.

He grasped it.

"Expand."

He gave the order.

"And, open."

His senses.

The beast of the boundary obeyed the order. The beast of the boundary was a realm, a life of its own. It expanded and amplified within Taesan.

His senses became even more sensitive, reaching the highest limit.

And at the end,

Taesan could see the true owner of the gaze.

"......It's ridiculously huge."

Taesan, who had been silent for a moment, exclaimed. His face was filled with astonishment.

[What? What's going on?]

"Don't you feel it?"

[What's there?]

"I don't feel anything. It's better not to know."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Bardley is currently the sword of Taesan. His power and valor are somewhat in sync.

However, even Bardley couldn't understand what Taesan was looking at.

Akasha would also be greatly different.

It's something enormous that can't even be felt, let alone understood, in a general sense.

The only one who can grasp that is Taesan.

'Enormous.'

That was the first impression.

Enormous, in a pure sense.

Even the World Destroyer was enormous, but this was beyond that level.

It was awkward to simply call it enormous. Humans don't say the universe is enormous, do they? When faced with a size that exceeds the concept of understanding, people can only feel overwhelmed.

That's how Taesan felt now.

It wasn't just enormous.

His valor was also on a different level.

When a being of high valor, like a high god or a transcendent, encounters a being of overwhelming valor, they are overwhelmed. Just by looking, they feel the sensation of death and are pressured to the point of being unable to do anything.

But this was different."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Even if an ordinary person were to recognize that, they wouldn't feel anything. It's like gazing at a pebble on the street, a completely numb sensation.

The height that was too high had become a completely different concept.

It was like a 3D being looking down at a 2D world, a sensation that couldn't be expressed in this world's concepts.

"You're brutal, aren't you?"

But.

Taesan had a clear sense of that existence.

He knew what level it was at, what kind of power it possessed, and what it could do.

He had a perfect grasp of it.

"I knew it existed."

The realm of the gods was extremely alien. Every existence in this place was born from the gods.

They were born solely by the gods' will, moved according to the gods' intentions, and could be erased at any moment if the gods so desired.

It was a world that revolved around the gods, a world that would die if they didn't exist.

Then, one question arose.

The beings of the universe are born naturally within the cycle.

There is a parent-like existence, but it's not particularly dependent or reliant on them.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Born and grown, only a few reach the highest realm. Even without anyone's intervention, life is born and circulates naturally.

But this place doesn't turn without a high spirit.

Lowly people are derived from high spirits.

Then, where did high spirits come from?

Didn't they also come from something?

Is it possible that there is no origin of everything?

This was the question that Taesan had been holding since he felt the gaze.

He has now solved that question.

"The realm. Is it itself?"

Taesan murmured.

The will of the world that existed on several planets.

The snake that governs the cycle of all things, Ouroboros.

The god of death, the master of the concept of death itself, Dersha.

There were concepts that existed from the creation of the universe, as well as the will of the planets themselves. The enormous existence that is now felt is also the same.

The difference is that it is the collection of all things in the true sense.

The space where high spirits reside. The realm on the other side.

It was itself.

If the universe itself has a self, it would be on the same level as that."

Note: Ouroboros is a mythological snake that consumes its own tail, symbolizing the cycle of life and death.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As long as that thing is not destroyed, killing the high gods is meaningless. If that thing is willing, it can create high gods again.

"What do you desire?"

"Why did you create the existence of high gods?"

"What thoughts do you have and observe in this world?"

"I couldn't know that far. The gaze towards the great mountain felt like curiosity and joy.

"What's it to me?"

"It's not for the great mountain to know what that thing desires and thinks."

I draw my sword.

As I move, I hear laughter. It's as if the great mountain's actions, hostile towards me, are enjoyable.

"I don't know what you are, but... I have one thing to do."

The great mountain, muttering quietly, freed itself from all restraints.

It devoured the concepts of high gods and transcendents.

It expanded itself.

Quadruple destruction!

Countless concepts are devoured by the high gods' realm and dyed. The great mountain begins to change them into its own possessions.

That, which is extremely ridiculous, laughed on the other side.

At the same time, the will of the realm moves.

The concepts unfolded by the great mountain are shattered like fragile ornaments in an instant."

Please let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's crushed and distorted like a scrap iron lump in an instant. The mountain is pulling its power even further up. The authorities are mixed and merged, devouring the will of the realm and crushing it down.

The realm's size is slowly increasing.

Heh heh.

And laughter echoes.

It's as if the prank is over, and the realm has devoured the mountain.

Concepts are crumbling in an instant.

Everything that the mountain has manifested is being trampled and shattered. The mountain is exposed to the realm in an instant, bare and naked.

A strong pressure is felt. It's as if a giant is grasping itself, a sense of being overwhelmed.

'It's ridiculously strong.'

No, it can't be expressed in words. That's a being that transcends such concepts.

It's crushing all concepts, like something that surpasses the realm.

Laughter echoes.

As if that's all there is.

As if it's been enjoyable, like a child playing with toys.

There's no need to see it anymore, and the mountain is about to be erased, its existence buried and disappearing into the realm.

And at that moment...

'Me.'

The beast that had been sleeping at the boundary jumps out.

* * *

Kuuuuuuuuung!

The boundary and the realm of the gods collide.

The realm of the gods, which is trying to devour the mountain, is pushing forward with a massive wave.

Kwadddddd!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The beast of the boundary, facing the realm of Gosin, claimed its own realm.

Hmph!

It won't back down.

The realm can no longer reach Taesan.

Something beyond is shaken, and the emotional waves spread throughout the entire realm.

It was clearly wavering.

"Do you think you're all-powerful?" Taesan sneered at the realm.

"It's not perfect, but I've also reached the same realm as you."

The opponent was the realm of Gosin itself, a being like the universe, the complete owner of the realm, something that created numerous concepts and stood at a lofty height.

But Taesan was the same.

The beast of the boundary he possessed.

It was the realm of the universe and Gosin, a realm that existed between the two.

It also dominated its own realm, just like the thing beyond.

It could be seen as an equal existence.

"Well... it's hard to win, though."

Taesan muttered to himself.

It could be seen as an equal, but it was undeniable that the opponent was stronger than Taesan. From the start, they could exert influence over the Gosin, so victory was close to impossible.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even if it's possible, it will take an extremely long time. It will take consuming the entire realm to make it disappear.

Perhaps it will take as long as the universe was created and destroyed.

Then, Taesan will truly gain omnipotence.

But Taesan didn't think that way.

At the end of everything, he becomes the sole absolute being.

He doesn't desire such a wish. What he wants is not strength.

"Let's try to finish it."

The authority is activated, affecting the realm. The beast of the boundary lets out a creaking sound and emerges.

It had always been starving.

It couldn't reveal its true self and had always shown only a fragment of itself.

If we think about the characteristics of the boundary, even the gods would be overwhelmed, but it had never shown such a form.

The reason was simple.

Because Taesan, as an individual, dominated the boundary, which was too powerful and enormous.

It was an unsolvable, kind of limit.

He had never fully utilized the boundary's power even once.

Now, that power is emerging.

The complete beast of the boundary appears in the world.

"I desire."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The mountain spoke quietly of its wish.

'The end.'

[You have activated a broken wish.]"
