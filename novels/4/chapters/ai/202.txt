Chapter 203

203. The 50th floor, a madman gone berserk (2)

"Swallow me whole! Mortal enemy!"

The emotions burst forth and spread throughout the entire room.

And then, the emotions that had spread began to pour into Taesan.

"Ha ha ha!"

Valencia was certain of his victory.

He had consumed an inexpressible emotion. Anyone who touched the emotions he was spreading would go mad.

He poured all those emotions towards Taesan at once.

"It's over!"

It was impossible to survive.

No matter how hard he tried to maintain his composure, he would become a madman swept away by the wave of emotion.

Of course, Taesan had collected pure emotions up until now without any problems.

However, with his current mental strength, he couldn't block Valencia's power.

He laughed maniacally. Now that he had Taesan's physical body as the sacrifice, he could collect emotions and bring everything to an end.

As expected, a storm of emotions was brewing in Taesan's mind.

Anger. Pleasure. Hate. Helplessness.

All those emotions were pounding his head like a hammer.
Here is the translation of the text:

And Tai Shan calmly accepted the emotions.

Strong currents.

He swallowed everything that belonged to the defeated one, wiping it out like a wave.

But that's all.

Compared to the despair he felt in his previous life, he was infinitely weak.

Tai Shan raised his fist and shouted. Valencia, who was about to approach, flew back with a burst of energy.

"Ah, how?"

"I'm weak, that's all."

Tai Shan replied simply and rushed towards him. Valencia hastily gathered his emotions and hurled them at Tai Shan.

Again, countless emotions poured in.

But he brushed them off with a light wave of his hand.

Valencia shouted with a hint of denial.

"Why?"

"What's the point of having many emotions? They're insignificant, useless."

It was a very natural and expected thing, as if.

Valencia's emotions, which he had swallowed, were all the emotions of those who had given up and stopped halfway.

The emotions of those people, when gathered, would mean nothing. They were just a lot of numbers.

"Ah, ah, ah!"

Valencia gritted his teeth.

He continued to pour out his emotions, but none of them hit their mark.

Valencia's eyes began to tremble violently and then slowly calmed down.

He stopped running away.
Here is the translation of the text:

The sword of Tae-san pierced his chest.

Valencia spilled blood from his lips and gazed at Tae-san's eyes. Tae-san grasped his head and shouted.

"Consciousness! Show me what you have!"

[A judgment attempt is made.] [Judgment in progress...].

The judgment window and the world changed together.

In front of Tae-san, only a world of gray ash was spread out.

Tae-san instinctively realized that this was the world of consciousness.

'What's this?'

He and Valencia called each other into the world of consciousness, and then grasped the consciousness itself.

So, this place is Valencia's inner world.

Tae-san stepped into the world of consciousness.

There were fragments of Valencia's memories that could be seen.

Through this, he could understand Valencia's entire life.

He was an ordinary person in the world. Born in the Middle Ages, he lived as the son of a tax collector, dealing with tax-related matters.

Tae-san was puzzled. He lived a simple life, satisfied with himself, and did not know why he would go mad or what he would want to obtain the consciousness of the transcendent for.
Here is the translation of the text:

At that moment, a fragment of memory appeared in Taesan's gaze.

The fragment was a strange color.

As Taesan approached the fragment, the memories it contained began to appear.

Taesan scowled.

There was only destruction there.

The city was burning, people were dying, and knights were riding horses wildly.

A dragon was flying in the sky, and an extraordinary power was scattering towards the other side, starting to unfold.

It seemed like it was trying to stop something.

Kuuuung!

And then everything collapsed together with the wave of a great power.

The knights were trampled, the dragons were bleeding and falling to the ground.

The world was doomed.

"Immortal?"

Taesan's eyes narrowed.

In the power that was crushing the world, the strength of the immortal was felt.

Valencia was running away frantically from that place.

As he ran, terrified and desperate, something approached him.

Valencia closed his eyes with tears.

Kwajik.

And it ended. The fragments of memory shattered and broke apart.

"This is it."

Taesan narrowed his eyes.
Here is the translation of the text:

During the time when Taesan was in Valencia's mind, Valencia was the same. He advanced Taesan's mind.

"It's all consumed!"

The physical body is ultimately controlled by the mind. If one consumes Taesan's mind, Taesan's physical body becomes his.

He spread his mind in all directions with eyes filled with madness.

At that moment, he was trying to make everything his own.

"Ah, ahah?"

But he soon realized that the power of the mind he was spreading was not as effective as he thought.

"Darkness?"

It was then that Valencia realized.

He was now in darkness.

He could not even see a step ahead, and his own existence was being consumed by an endless darkness, like a black curtain.

Valencia was shocked and advanced.

But the darkness did not disappear.

He scattered his strength. All his strength was consumed by the darkness and disappeared.

"This is... "

Valencia was shocked.

He realized.

This was Taesan's mind. But he saw nothing.

The reason was one.

His mind was far too inferior to intervene with Taesan's mind.
Here is the translation of the text:

He had swallowed tens of thousands of spirits and couldn't even touch his own memories.

[Judgment Successful!]

Ka-ching!

The world was shattered.

Tai Shan returned to the labyrinth, his face twisted in anger.

‘Immortal?’

The existence that had trampled Valencia's world and subdued him was undoubtedly the aura of an immortal.

"What's the point of this?"

It was not just a trivial matter. It meant that the immortal had directly torn apart Valencia's world.

And then, the aura that approached Valencia at the end.

It seemed that it would be the immortal. But then, there was a question. Why was Valencia here?

He tried to ask about it, but Valencia was not in a normal state.

"Ah, ahah, ahahah……"

The one with a sword in his chest did not resist at all.

"You are... like that."

He looked at Tai Shan with a hoarse voice and said:

"Yes. I've brought the pure core. Since I've become invulnerable to such things from the beginning, I... I want to take revenge on the immortal who has made me like this, but... alas, alas, alas..."

Years, maybe tens, hundreds of years...
Here is the translation of the text:

Dreaming of surpassing oneself, the eccentric who had taken up residence in the labyrinth died in that way.

[Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [You obtained the special continuous activation skill "Emotional Interference"]. [Your spiritual level has risen. You obtained the special continuous activation skill "Emotional Turbulence"]. [The special continuous activation skill "Emotional Turbulence" merged with the special continuous activation skill "Three Proofs"].

The skill integration has been completed.

[Special continuous activation skill: Three Proofs] [You have proven yourself to yourself, God, and the world. The things you have accumulated and your emotions have become real, remaining in the surroundings and having a material impact.]

In addition to the things accumulated from the Three Proofs, the part where emotions have become real has been added.

"Is it a bit stronger now?"

It's not just a difference in intensity, but emotions are also included. The emotional power that Valencia had shown was not weaker than the saint's power. The Three Proofs are likely to be even stronger.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Special permanent skill: Emotional Interference] [Proficiency: 1%] [Can interfere with others' emotions or imbue one's own attacks with emotions to attempt to judge the opponent's mind. The stronger one's mental power, the less effective it is.]"

"Let's see."

Tae-san activated the Snowflake Arrow. Then, he used Emotional Interference, and the emotional turmoil shown by Valencia began to gradually manifest on the Snowflake Arrow.

"It's fine."

In other words, all attacks would result in a mental judgment, just like a abnormal status effect. Although it may not be effective against extremely strong opponents, it could be used effectively against numerous enemies.

It didn't end there.

"You have reached the desired location in the labyrinth. A reward is given accordingly."

Kururung.

The floor tiles rose up. They began to fit together like a puzzle, forming a shape.

"Are you that person?"

"Hello, Balbambal."

The labyrinth administrator, Balbambal, appeared. He looked at Tae-san and muttered to himself.

"It's rare for an adventurer who hasn't even entered the depths to meet me so often, you know."

"Is it good?"

"It depends on how you think. First, I have to do my job."

Balbambal's body trembled. Valencia's corpse began to slide down into the labyrinth.

Kururung.
Here is the translation of the text:

And a small spherical object appeared at that location.

It seemed to be a temporary NPC that replaced Valencia's role.

[We've been together for a long time, 21 floors of the labyrinth, and 41 floors of guides who led the way. But now, two of them have disappeared, all because of one adventurer.]

"Should I apologize?"

[There's no need to. The fact that they disappeared means that their wishes have been fulfilled in some way.]

Barbarossa's body trembled and bumped into something.

[We made a contract. According to that, we took our place in the labyrinth. The fulfillment of that contract means that the role has ended, and that's a good thing. The hero behind you is probably the same.]

The hero's words trailed off.

[My job is done. Now, I should reward you.]

Barbarossa's body trembled and began to gain power.

[You've reached the second stage of the labyrinth's magic as a mage.]

"100 levels?"

[In numerical terms, that's correct. As for you, the mage has prepared a reward.]

Even at level 55, Barbarossa appeared and gave you a choice.

"What was it?"

(Note: The last sentence seems to be a question, but it's unclear what it's referring to. If you can provide more context, I can try to help clarify.)
Here is the translation of the text:

Equipment, skill proficiency, stat upgrades, knowledge of labyrinth, hidden truths, and desired information.

I remembered it that way.

This time, the Mountain God thought about what he would receive and the Balamb Garden's leader, Headmaster Cid, spoke up.

[It seems you're thinking, but this time it's limited to two options.]

"What's with the reduced amount compared to last time?"

[Don't ask me. It's been decided by the mage.]

Headmaster Cid spoke in a tone that showed he was annoyed.

[This time, you can receive a valuable equipment or skill. Choose one.]

There was no need to deliberate on the options.

"I'll take the skill."

Equipment can be replaced someday, but skills cannot.

Headmaster Cid seemed to know that and nodded his body.

[Take it. It's a gift from the mage to you.] [You have obtained the special activation skill [Adventurer's Will].] [Special activation skill: Adventurer's Will] [Mana consumption: 50] [Only available to adventurers descending into the labyrinth. With a steadfast will and mind, you can ignore all judgments imposed upon yourself for a certain period of time.]

"What's this, a skill that provides immunity to status abnormalities?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san had an aura around him. If one ignored the previous judgment, it would include cold, burn, emotional, and even death judgments, as well as confusion judgments, and so on.

Although Tae-san had never experienced a psychological judgment before, it felt different from being immune and resisting.

[You've come down to a level that a mage would be satisfied with. So, you should receive a reward commensurate with that. Are you satisfied?]

Tae-san nodded his head. Ba-bal-bam's body began to crumble.

[Then I'll go back to my task. I'm busy because of my owner.]

Ba-bal-bam left, muttering to himself. Tae-san caught up to him.

"Hold on. I'll ask one more thing."

[It's not allowed for you.]

"It's not a big deal. It's just a simple confirmation."

Ba-bal-bam's body stopped crumbling.

He asked, "What is it?"

"What is the reward for clearing a floor? Is it possible to receive it regardless of which floor it is?"

[What are you asking for?]

Ba-bal-bam replied with a tone of annoyance.

[Of course. It's natural that it's a reward for clearing a floor.]

"I understand."

Tae-san nodded his head. Ba-bal-bam's body had completely crumbled.

[Then I'll see you next time.]
Here is the translation of the text:

After completing the verification, Tai Shan descended the layer.

[This is the place where the abyss of the labyrinth leads to. This is a place where things filled with mystery live. The fallen and the uncorrupted coexist in harmony.]

[Start of 51st floor quest. Defeat the boss of the 51st floor and pass through.]

[Reward: Broken Spirit's Ankle Guard. Secret reward: ???]

The grandmaster who was sitting on the 51st floor greeted him.

"Ah, you've finally made it here."

He looked at Tai Shan with a face filled with nostalgia.

"Your speed is far beyond that of others. From here on, the labyrinth will change again. Many things will appear. How you relate to them is entirely up to you."

He gave a brief advice. Tai Shan took the advice to heart and broke through the passage.

"'Then.'

The devil said that the 5th-level guides were waiting for him on the 51st floor.

And then, this Taeyoung said that the 51st floor was quite unique.

Click.

Tai Shan opened the door.

What appeared was a vast city.
Here is the translation of the text:

Many medieval-style buildings lined the street. And there were people walking down the street, their faces expressionless.

Monsters were nowhere to be seen.

It was more like a village than a building.

"Really."

[It's been a long time since I came here.]

Many adventurers had gathered in the labyrinth.

And some of them went all the way down to the bottom, while others died on the way down.

However, such cases were extremely rare.

Most people who came to the labyrinth gave up after going down a few levels.

The feeling of despair that they might die due to their own abilities, or the doubt that they couldn't make it to the bottom, and so on.

Many people who were stuck in this emotional state abandoned their quest and settled in the middle of the labyrinth.

This place is the 51st floor.

It was a city where people who had given up gathered.
