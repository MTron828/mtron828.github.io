Episode 125

125. Grade B Monster (2)

Almost four days had passed since the net fourth week. There was only one day left until the final wave.

Everyone's expression was bright. People believed that it would not be too difficult from now on.

Tae-san visited Kim Hwi-yeon, who was preparing for tomorrow in his room.

"Ah, Tae-san."

"Be careful tomorrow."

"Yes?"

"Don't feel uneasy and do your best."

"...There's something."

Kim Hwi-yeon's tense body relaxed and he stood up stiffly.

"I'll tell you."

"Okay."

Kim Hwi-yeon left the room with a serious face.

And that night.

Ka-ka!

"Wow!"

Gang Jun-hyeok's arm gave way and he fell down. He got up with a red face.

"It's not over yet."

"No, it's not enough."

Tae-san held a sword. The eyes of I Tae-yeon, who was watching with an anxious face, became rabbit-like.

"Hey? Is it already over? What's going on?"
Here is the translation of the text:

After arriving at the city hall, Taesan continued to train with them. It was no different from the previous wave.

However, today's Taesan stopped training after only two hours.

"Don't you want to die in the battlefield and regret it? We must fight without regret."

"...What's going to happen tomorrow?"

Gang Jun-hyeok spoke calmly.

"Aunt Kim Hwi-yeon is mobilizing everywhere to form a line, as my brother said."

"It's going to be very difficult tomorrow, anyway."

Taesan gazed at the sky's rift.

Gang Jun-hyeok swallowed hard, feeling a strange sense of foreboding.

"If my brother feels it's difficult, then... how difficult is it?"

"Don't die. If you die, I'll be really sad."

"I'll try my best."

And the next day arrived.

Everyone prepared for the wave, having received a warning from Kim Hwi-yeon. Their faces were serious.

[The fourth wave has begun.] [Rewards will be distributed according to performance.]

Kwwwwk.

"What's this?"

"What's going on?"

This time, unlike before, monsters didn't rush in.

The air just split open.

Monsters began to appear one by one from the rift in space.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This...?"

Someone swallowed their spit. There were dozens of monsters, much fewer than before.

But it was ominous. It felt like those dozens of monsters had a power stronger than the monsters themselves.

Tae-san muttered to himself.

"E-grade."

And a few D-grades.

"I've made up my mind."

Tae-san laughed at the monsters more terrifying than he had imagined. Even the current hard mode players would find it difficult to win against E-grade monsters, not to mention D-grade.

The monsters start moving.

Kim Hwi-yeon curses them.

"Everyone, line up!"

* * *

The battle has begun, and people realized...

The monsters of today are truly creatures from a different dimension.

"Ugh!"

The monster roughly wags its tail. Even the players in ideal and normal mode couldn't block it and were blown away.

"Kkwek!"

Sung-jang-san barely blocked it, shocked.

"It's heavy!"
He couldn't handle such power. He had experienced such power before.

"It was the monster that appeared at the end of the previous return!"
Note: G-grade, D-grade, E-grade, etc. seem to refer to different levels of monsters in a game or simulation.
Here is the translation of the text:

This level of strength is formidable.

There were nearly a hundred of those things.

Feeling despair, Seojangsan moved his sword.

Monsters were running wild among people. More than a hundred people were being oppressed by tens of thousands.

Snap!

And D-grade was literally the incarnation of destruction.

Wooo!

"Ah... Ahh."

Iji and Normal, Hard, and everything in between was crushed and trampled. Lee Taeyoung struck down his sword with a scream. His face was pale, but his movement and trajectory were perfect.

Boom!

That attack was easily blocked. Just as Lee Taeyoung let out a scream when he was hit by the monster's counterattack.

"What are you just standing there for?"

Kwa-jik.

Taesan crushed the monster. The monster, unable to withstand the force, fell to the ground.

Ggugu-ggu-gung!

The ground cracked and trembled, as if an earthquake had occurred. Lee Taeyoung's face turned pale.

"Taesan, sir!"

The monster that had fallen to the ground did not collapse and counterattacked. It moved its long, winding chains to bind Taesan.

"Grab it."
Note: The text appears to be a scene from a novel or manga, and the translation may not be entirely accurate without context.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san pretended to be annoyed and clenched his fist. Chains burst open. He then brought his fist down, causing the monster to fall to the ground again.

"Two times...?"

She couldn't resist the monster, who was defeated by just two attacks.

"Tae-san is all I need...".

Although the monsters are strong, Tae-san is even stronger. She muttered to herself with a glimmer of hope, but Tae-san cut her off.

"I'm sorry, but it can't be done."

"Yes, yes?"

Tae-san gazed at the E-level monster before him, his eyes narrowing.

"I'm here."

Snap.

The space split open. A hand pierced through the web-like gap in the space.

A black arm. It pulled at the space, causing the crack to expand roughly.

The monster was humanoid.

It had four arms. Black legs. Its body was three times larger than theirs.

Its bodily head pointed towards them.

"Ahh."

[Monster 48881 appeared.]

A five-digit monster appeared on the spot.

"Ahh, ahh...".

Lee Tae-yeon's body began to tremble.

It's scary.

She was overwhelmed by fundamental fear. The monster that appeared before her, more terrifying than anything she had seen in her maze, filled her with fear.
Here is the translation of the text:

It wasn't just her who felt that. Everyone who was fighting suddenly trembled with fear at the impending dread.

The monster raised its four arms.

Kuung!

In an instant, they thought a bomb had exploded. The shockwave covered them.

"Uaaaah!"

Regardless of whether it was easy, normal, or hard mode, they scattered in disarray and flew away. And the shockwave was precisely heading towards Tai Shan.

Tai Shan scowled and swung his fist at them.

Zzeeeung!

People covered their ears at the sound of the air bursting.

Tai Shan shook his hand, looking startled.

"How strong you are."

[This is quite dangerous.]

"Tai Shan, sir."

Kim Huiyuan, who had flown in from beside Tai Shan, stumbled and got up.

"That's......"

Her jaw clicked with a loud sound. She was scared. The monster's aura, which was just a presence, made her heart skip a beat.

"I don't like it."

Tai Shan bit his lip. At the same time, a surge of energy burst forth from him.

"Ah."

Kim Huiyuan retreated without realizing it, unable to resist the energy emanating from Tai Shan.

The concentration of that power was similar to the power emitted by the monster.
Here is the translation:

"Sorry, I don't think I can help you."

"What's your name?"

He turned his back on her summons and planted his feet.

* * *

Taesan had left the city hall. He ran and ran until the city hall was no longer in sight.

"This should be enough."

It would not have any impact on the city hall even if he fought here. The only problem was whether the monster would chase him, but since the monster followed him as soon as he moved, he didn't worry about it.

"What's my purpose?"

Taesan took out his sword.

The four-armed giant gazed at him silently.

[Strong.]

The ghost let out a sigh.

[It's strong enough to be a real challenge. Even an adventurer who has fallen 40 floors can't handle it. Why is such a monster emerging so soon?]

"It's simple, isn't it?"

To kill him. That's all.

"Should I be happy because the strong ones are paying attention?"

Taesan said it like a joke, but his eyes were extremely serious.

A five-digit monster.

It was a B-grade monster that even hard mode players who had cleared the labyrinth could not defeat.
Here is the translation of the text:

The opponent is an unbeatable enemy. Judgment unnecessary.

As my enemy's judgment succeeds, everything rises to the top. It doesn't end there.

The desire for battle has been activated. A just duel has been activated. The strong are humiliated. Heresy has been activated.

The system window is rising rapidly. You can feel the changed stats to the extent that it is almost tangible, and you can use skills.

"You have activated scouting." "Monster 48881" "Specialized attack type"

The scouting is not yet complete, so the stamina does not come out. However, the information shown is sufficient.

"Thank goodness it's specialized."

There were various types of monsters. Attack type, support type, defense type, etc. And from there, they branched out again.

The simple attack type with nothing was all-around. Speed, strength, and stamina were all above average.

However, if a specialized name is attached, it means that one ability is excluded, and the rest are below average.

The problem is what kind of specialized type it is. Is it attack power, speed, or something else? It's not clear for the time being.

"I'll try and see."
Here is the translation of the text:

The monster's head-like origin moved. Although there was no eyeball, a clear sense of vitality was felt.

Kuung.

The monster suddenly kicked its feet. At the same time, Tae-san could sense it.

It's a specialized speed-type monster. The monster's appearance suddenly disappeared in an instant.

When the monster reappeared, it was facing Tae-san.

[Your first attack was nullified.]

Tae-san moved immediately. Just as he was about to strike the monster's neck with his sword, the monster disappeared. A gust of wind blew, and the monster retreated several steps away.

"í—ˆ."

Tae-san let out a hollow laugh.

He couldn't respond at all to the monster's speed. He adjusted his stance with a serious look.

Tat.

The monster's body disappeared.

At the same time, Tae-san activated his skill.

[You have accelerated your mind.] [You have activated the "Wind Walker" skill.]

After using all the speed-related skills, Tae-san was finally able to move. He dodged the incoming punch.

Tae-san's sword clashed with the monster's arm.

The four arms attached to the monster wildly flailed about. Tae-san also used his first "Furious Storm" technique, "Wolverine's Fang".

Ka-kaka-kaka!
Here is the translation of the text:

"The difference in speed is significant. Tai Shan allowed the monster to strike back."

[Your second attack has been nullified.]

However, it was as expected. With the attack nullified, Tai Shan inserted the sword into the monster's chest, which had returned to its previous state. Since the connection was like a flowing river, the monster couldn't dodge.

[Tai Shan has activated the Heavy Strike.] [Tai Shan has activated the Add.] [Tai Shan has activated the Continuous Attack.] [The monster took 895 damage.] [The monster took 412 damage.] [What a thrill!]

The ghost couldn't help but mutter, "It's ridiculous that double damage is dealt even with continuous attacks. It's a skill that's impossible to understand no matter how I look at it."

The monster charged again. Tai Shan was unable to block it, and the attack nullification was triggered. Tai Shan took advantage of the gap to strike back.

Again, a massive amount of damage was dealt. The monster created some distance again.

"Well, now it's my turn."

The attack nullification has been completely consumed. Now, there is no opportunity to take advantage of the gap when returning."
Here is the translation of the text:

Despite dealing around 3000 points of damage, I can say that I've done my part. However, the monster's physical strength, which the protagonist remembers, is around 3,000 to 3,000. I still need to succeed in around eight attacks.

The monster moved. Tae-san chased after its afterimage with his sword, but only managed to scratch the air.

[You took 343 damage.]

343. Given its speed specialization, the damage was surprisingly small.

However, it's not something to be ignored. Tae-san's physical strength, including his defensive barrier, is around 4,300. Even with his shield activated, he would die after taking 30 hits.

Against a monster that can barely be seen and can't even counterattack, I need to succeed in eight attacks within 30 attempts.

It was definitely an impossible victory.

But.

"Did I underestimate myself too much? This is an insult to my pride."

I've fought against thousands of monsters in my previous life, specializing in monster types.

Tae-san muttered to himself and placed his hand on the ground.

[You activated the twisted vegetation of Decarabia.]

The twisted roots exploded like a bomb.
