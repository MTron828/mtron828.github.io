**Chapter 436**

436. The 85th Floor, the Ash-Colored Woman, Sosiet Gardenia (4)

"What's going on."

Bardley looked around with a distorted face.

"I was clearly resting on the 10th floor, wasn't I?"

"Haha, haha, haha, hahahahaha..."

Sosiet, who was lying on the floor, laughed like a madwoman.

Despite having everything taken away by Exirea, she still maintained a consciousness that was close to madness.

"Ah, ah, ah. My prince..."

"......Sosiet?"

Bardley was taken aback when he saw Sosiet lying down.

"Why are you like this?"

"I'm telling you, prince."

Sosiet spoke with a lifeless face.

"You died. I borrowed Exirea's power to revive you."

"......What nonsense is this?"

Bardley's face contorted in shock.

"There were no monsters on the 10th floor that could kill me."

"I don't know about that. But one thing is certain, you were dead. I don't know. Maybe someone from the upper echelons secretly killed you."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"How could I not know that those guys are approaching?"

Taesan gazed at Bardley.

That Bardley had the memories of when he was on the verge of death, resting on the 10th floor, and was revived by the power of the gods. Even if Bardley's corpse was revived with the memories up until his death, it wouldn't be strange.

At first, Bardley, who was in denial, began to accept reality as Sosiyeot's story progressed.

"......That method might be possible."

"There were many guides who didn't get along with you. They took the lead. I warned them, but... they didn't listen."

"How can I believe your words?"

Bardley spoke sharply, doubting everything.

Sosiyeot laughed calmly.

"If I had killed you, I wouldn't have a reason to revive you, would I? Look at me."

Sosiyeot raised his arm, showing no strength, like a weak woman.

"I sacrificed everything to revive you."

"......You borrowed my power, didn't you?"

[Yes. The labyrinth's warrior.]

Exirea replied calmly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[She sacrificed herself to save you, who had died. There is no falsehood in that.]

"Is that so."

[So I will give you, who have been revived, an opportunity.]

The system window appeared to the revived Bardley.

[Defeat the adventurer who made a contract with the ghost of the prince of the ruined world.] [Condition: The death of Gang Tae-san.] [Reward: Resurrection.]

Bardley, who had read the system window, opened his mouth.

"I'll believe your words. Sosiet."

[Do you really believe her words?]

The ghost let out a cold laugh. Bardley's gaze turned to the ghost.

Bardley, who was staring at the ghost, suddenly spoke.

"It's me."

[You're not me.]

"Did you make a contract with the wizard of the labyrinth to avenge yourself? You're treating your own soul like this. It's ridiculous."

[Sosiet did revive you. But at the same time, she's the one who killed me.]

"I'll return it to you. I can't believe your words either."

Bardley was even doubting his own ghost self.

"You must have experienced many things in that state. Even if you're me, I'm not me. You can't be trusted."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I know that's my past self, but what a troublesome personality I have."

"No matter how true your words are, nothing changes."

Bardley stretched out his hand into the air. The space split open. It was an inventory granted to the adventurers of the labyrinth.

"What's important is that I died and got a second chance."

Bardley pulled out his hand from the inventory.

A long sword appeared in his hand.

"I shouldn't miss this opportunity that I got like a miracle."

Bardley's gaze towards Taesan was filled with clear hostility.

The warrior who had provided him with a lot of information and helped him by his side was now trying to kill him.

"Then, you beings with desires. Move according to your desires."

Exirea stepped back, ending with those words.

* * *

"I wouldn't make a contract with an ordinary adventurer, so you must be quite capable."

Bardley held his sword with an arrogant face, more confident than anyone.

"I'll test you myself. Adventurer."

Tat.

Bardley's body moved.

The sword drew a residual image.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It drew numerous orbits, as if multiple people were attacking at once.

The first sword of the Storm Scar. Wolf's Fang.

Taesan grasped the sword.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

The sword's attack was relentless. The ghost died on the 80th floor. Although it was stronger than a typical 80th-floor adventurer, it wasn't overwhelmingly so.

Taesan was an immortal. Even if dozens of bards rushed at him, he could emerge victorious without a single speck of dust on him.

However, the bard's attack was sharp and powerful.

Exirea took everything from Sosiet and granted him the power. For the sake of his loved one.

That power raised the bard's abilities to a considerable level. Now, the bard was showing off a strength that rivaled that of Beltenkyia's princess, Diana.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

Numerous afterimages were drawn, and at the same time, the distance between them grew. The bard's face was twisted in anger.

'...You've learned my swordsmanship.'

The Ability Sword was based on the swordsmanship of the Storm Scar.

'Did you think you could teach me my own swordsmanship, even if we had a contract?'

The bard clicked his tongue and grasped his sword."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That swordsmanship is mine alone. I won't allow anyone to have it. I'll show you the true Storm Scar sword."

It's an arrogance that doesn't recognize anyone except himself, and confidence in himself.

"Is that the you from the past?"

[……Yeah.]

The ghost nodded quietly.

Bardley charged again. The movement of his sword was different from before. It was as if he was dancing, softly aiming for Taesan's vital spots.

The second sword. The dance of the swordswoman.

[You activated a strong attack.]

Taesan created some distance.

But Bardley was like a snake, crawling along Taesan's sword and aiming for his neck.

[You activated a dodging skill.]

Ka-gak!

The sword bounced back as if repelled. Bardley quickly regained his posture.

"It's different from what I know. Is he ignoring the collision with his weapon itself?"

Bardley muttered quietly and pulled out another sword. Holding two swords like Taesan, he charged again.

His posture was extremely low.

Holding two swords, he rotated his body and charged like a storm.

Ka-ga-gak!

The sword blade grazed past Taesan. The empty and real spaces were mixed up, making it difficult to distinguish between them.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If we're only talking about swordsmanship, I've surpassed Taesan."

Taesan blocked the attack and said,

"Are you done cleaning up your mind?"

[...What's going on? Are you waiting for me?]

"This is your quest."

Taesan said calmly,

"I can't just end it on my own terms."

[Ha.]

The ghost laughed.

[I've already finished cleaning up. I can finish it. Everything.]

The ghost said.

Taesan grasped his sword with both hands and struck down. In response, Bardley swung his twin swords with elasticity, like a spring, and aimed for Taesan's heart.

Just like that, Bardley danced with his sword, aiming for Taesan's heart.

Taesan, who had been watching the scene, put strength into his sword.

Quarddak.

Bardley's sword, which had been thrusting like a snake, was pressed down.

Bardley's eyes widened. He hastily activated his secret skills and tried to push back Taesan's sword.

Taesan responded very simply.

He didn't move, he just put strength into his sword and pressed down.

And with that alone, Bardley's body was knocked to the ground.

"Kuh!"

Taesan struck down with his sword, imbuing it with divine power.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Divinity exploded towards Bardray. A golden light enveloped the labyrinth. Even if he was a high-ranking apostle, he couldn't escape the divinity's power.

But Bardray didn't die.

A barrier was firmly protecting Bardray.

[You have activated Absolute Judgment.]

Taesan struck the barrier, but it didn't even budge.

Absolute Judgment was a skill of the labyrinth, close to a law.

The fact that it didn't work was one thing.

The defense barrier was also something close to a law.

For the sake of the one he loved. Among the effects of that power was the ability to prevent death-inducing damage for a certain period of time.

Bardray's face, which had stumbled back to its feet, was stern.

"You can't win against him right now. He's reached a higher dimension than you."

The fallen Sosiet said with a face that was rapidly losing its vitality.

The power of Exirea that dwelled within Bardray was certainly remarkable, but its limits were clear. Taesan, an immortal, wasn't weak enough to be surpassed by a 80th-floor adventurer who had only received one blessing from a god.

Bardray didn't deny it.

"I can't win like this.""
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Don't worry. It's fine. I knew that much too. I'll definitely make you win."

The last bit of life left in Sosiét's body was fading away.

"So, even in death, don't forget about me."

[Sosiét Gardentia had died.]

"Sosiét?"

Bardley's eyes trembled.

Although he had been holding on with his willpower in a situation where he should have died, it was still too sudden. It was as if he had chosen death himself.

At the same time, a massive presence descended once again.

But it was not Exirea.

It was a different existence.

[Derasha's post-mortem contract was activated. Derasha's interference domain decreased.]

Sosiét opened his eyes.

* * *

"Hmm."

Sosiét slowly got up.

But unlike before, he had a very unnatural, doll-like appearance.

"I don't like that Exirea intervened... but I've obtained the original body I wanted. It doesn't matter."

The being that had taken over Sosiét's corpse muttered. She turned her gaze to Taesan.

"You're the one who's been causing a ruckus in the labyrinth."

"......Who are you?"

Taesan scowled.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The presence felt in Soshiet was Exirea. It was more than that. Soshiet opened its mouth.

"I am Derusha, the God of Death."

"Lord Derusha?"

Bardley's eyes widened.

Derusha was a transcendent being who truly embodied death itself, existing since the creation of this world.

Lakiratas also had a domain related to struggle and death, but he only dealt with deaths that occurred through struggle and did not possess death itself as his domain.

Most transcendent beings were called gods, but Derusha was a being who was truly close to being a god in the true sense.

And Bardley knew that Derusha was one of the gods residing in the deepest part of the abyss, on the 90th floor.

"Why is Lord Derusha in her body...?"

"I've been interested in her since she entered the labyrinth. I offered her a contract, but she kept refusing. Then, she suddenly changed her mind and accepted the contract recently."

[That's how it happened.]

The ghost closed its mouth."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was a part that was predictable. Sosiet had a special power from birth. The power to control the dead, which even the highest authorities couldn't fully understand, was a unique power. It wasn't unusual for the God of Death to take an interest in her.

"'Why are you on the 85th floor?' she asked.

It seemed that she had received some of Derasha's power through their contract.

"'My contract with you is to lend you my body in exchange for helping someone once.'"

Derasha was gazing at Taesan.

The light in her gaze was not gentle at all.

Taesan immediately understood.

The magician had said that Taesan was going to be killed by a god.

One of them was the God of Death.

"Originally, I wouldn't have liked this contract, but... if it's with you, the story changes."

[Derasha's puppet activation.]

Kukuku!

The God of Death's authority was manifested through Sosiet's body.

"The magician says you can create a new world. What kind of new world is that? This world is perfect. Why would you want to create chaos and allow the existence of troublemakers?"

Death slowly began to unfold. Derasha declared, as if pronouncing a sentence.

"Existences like you are unacceptable."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Sosiet... gave up his life for me. If he wanted my victory that much, I should respond to him as well."

[Ha.]

The ghost let out a dry laugh. To him, who knew the truth, it was a ridiculous situation.

"Ehilri, I will accept the contract with you now."

[The God of the Sword, Ehilri, descends.]

Ehilri, the god who had once overcome the trials of Taesan. Ironically, Ehilri had given his physical body to Bardray during the trials of Taesan.

Now, he was proceeding with the contract with Bardray, who had regained his physical body.

The ghost had said that he had been offered the contract of the sword multiple times when he was alive, but he had rejected them all because they would limit his growth.

But now, he was accepting the contract to defeat Taesan.

"Oh, oh, oh..."

Bardray let out a sigh. His strength evolved into that of the sword. He reached an incredible height in an instant.

"It's quite a lot."

Taesan clicked his tongue. Exirea, Dersha, Ehilri.

Three transcendent beings were aiming for Taesan's power.
