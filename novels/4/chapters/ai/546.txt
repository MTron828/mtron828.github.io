Chapter 547

547. The Treasure Box of the Usurper (5)

[What are you doing here?] [Huh?]

The messenger was taken aback for a moment, as if they didn't expect to be asked that.

But soon, they regained their composure and began to speak.

[We're waiting for the start.] [The start?] [Yes!]

The messenger exclaimed, filled with joy and excitement.

[We're talking about the start of the war to reclaim our original world and make it our own!]

War.

It wasn't hard to guess what they were talking about. It would be the upcoming war between the transcenders and the gods.

Taesan thought for a moment before speaking again.

[There's something I want to ask.] [Please say anything, great one.]

The messenger bowed their head, taking an absolute obedient stance.

Taesan gazed at them with a calm expression.

The messenger had a complete grasp of their senses.

Their conversation flowed smoothly, as if they were talking to an ordinary person.

'He's more composed than I thought.'

"All the monsters he had met so far were ones that didn't make sense, so he thought this place wouldn't be much different. But it was unexpected.

Well, the monsters he had faced so far were tools to destroy the world, so they didn't need complete intelligence.

Then, from Taesan's perspective, the story became easier to understand. Taesan asked the death god.

"Who do you serve?" "I am a child born from the fragments of the Great World Destroyer, who is alone and supreme."

A child born from fragments. Taesan scrutinized the death god. As he said, Taesan could sense a self-transforming power within the death god's body.

Of course, it wasn't at the level of being called a true power. If he had to compare, it was only slightly more solid.

But a clear fragment of power was visible.

Taesan looked at the other monsters bowing their heads in the distance.

He could sense a similar energy from them as well. Even if they weren't the World Destroyer, they had a tiny bit of the characteristics of the born-from-fragments gods.

Taesan realized."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Beings in the universe are born and die under a great cycle. Even transcendents were not born as transcendents from the start. Except for special cases like Derusha, they all rose to their current positions from being mortal, bound by the universe's concept.

But this place is different.

The twisted realm of the gods is where everything is determined by the gods' judgment and power.

In other words, all beings that exist here are derived from the gods, similar to being part of the gods' flesh and blood.

The space that rivals the universe was created solely by the gods.

In other words, if the gods handle it, this place doesn't need to be worried about anymore. If one god falls, all their underlings will perish as well.

'Not bad.'

Taesan looked around.

There were numerous distorted planets beyond that.

The number exceeded ten.

'[Are they gathering for war?] [Yes, it's true. The great ones are preparing.]'

The god of death laughed with joy.

'[The great ones are breaking the filthy barrier they created. The weak and dirty, naive and childish external beings dare to try and block it, but it won't be long before the path is opened.]'

The god of death shook his body violently, trembling with joy."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We have gathered here to prepare for that war! We've been robbed! To reclaim our original world that was tainted and retrieve it!"

Taesan gazed at the other planets, overflowing with the emotions of the gods.

The monsters gathered on the planet were extremely powerful.

The weakest among them was an S-grade monster.

There were hundreds, thousands, no, even more of them gathered.

The number of beings that seemed like gods was not small either.

If they were to move in unison, it wouldn't end with just a light impact. Even if they were gods, they couldn't guarantee they could stop it. If the Transcenders didn't move personally, they would destroy hundreds of planets and continue to advance without stopping.

The problem was that the Transcenders were too busy to stop them.

It was difficult to find a strong person who could stop them.

If the war began, it would be the end.

Taesan's eyes sank.

But he didn't take action.

He just asked the god.

"I heard there's a traitor who surrendered to them on the other side. Is that true?"

The god nodded.

"Yes, I've heard that too."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You're a foolish person blinded by greatness. Everything will eventually become dirty anyway, but it's not bad. You're just fulfilling your own role.] [Do you know where that guy is?]"

Taesan asked, and the messenger was slightly taken aback.

But without much hesitation, the messenger began to speak candidly.

"[That part... I'm sorry, I don't know either.]"

The messenger's voice was filled with genuine apology.

It was a strange and fascinating sensation to see a being born from a high-ranking official react like a human.

"[The location of that foolish person is only known to a select few among the great ones. If you ask them directly, you'll find out.] [Is that so?] [But I have a hunch about it too. It's not here.]"

Taesan looked at the messenger, who spoke quickly, like a child eager to share what they knew.

"[The foolish person is a being from the other side. They couldn't exist in our world from the start.] [Really?]"

The transcendent being couldn't stay in the high-ranking official's realm. Taesan knew that, but he thought that since they had a cooperative relationship, the high-ranking officials would find a way to make it possible. However, it seemed that was impossible.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[That means they're on the other side, doesn't it?]" "[Unless they're hiding in a specific space, that's right.]"

Those who have fallen have a high probability of being in the universe.

Taesan organized the information in his head and turned his gaze.

More than ten planets.

Among those gathered there, there was no one weak. It was as if they had been selected.

"[You're the vanguard, aren't you?]" "[Yes. We have obtained the qualification to participate in the war's vanguard, certified by the great ones.] "[Are all the strong ones gathered here?]" "[That's right. There's no one who refuses to sully themselves beyond this point. Everyone here has applied, but the weak ones have all been eliminated.]"

The voice of the messenger was filled with undeniable pride.

"[That's right, isn't it?]"

The ones gathered on these more than ten planets, excluding the strong ones, are close to the total power of this place.

"[The great ones are all within the boundaries, aren't they?]" "[Yes. Not a single one is missing, and they're all using their power to sully themselves. Truly... the great ones are indeed great. If it's them, they'll be able to sully the other side as well.]"

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The messenger who was speaking felt a strange sensation.

"[But why are you here...?]" "[Are you also included in the usurper's group?]" "[Yes?"]

The messenger was taken aback.

"[You also know that the usurper is within the boundary... but suddenly...]" "[That's right. It means there's no one to intervene here. I'll crush them with all my might, and it'll be hard to even send fragments or remnants. It's not bad.] "[...Is that so?]" "[Achieving the goal is important, but it's better to handle what you can and move on.]"

The messenger took a step back.

"[You're a part of the great one, aren't you? What do you mean?]" "[What is a part?]" "[It's exactly as I said... a part. A part of the great one. You've separated yourself and created another self...]" "[Is it a concept bigger than fragments or pieces?]" "[A part... is that so?"]

The messenger was extremely flustered. But their eyes still didn't show any doubt towards the great one.

"I can't doubt anything. I must be heterogeneous."

"[Ordinary beings from the other side can't act like you, so it's natural, isn't it?]"

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The sound of a human's voice echoes. The god's body trembles greatly.

[You are... No, you...]

The blackness that wrapped around the mountain begins to unravel, revealing the ash-gray color hidden within.

The god is shocked.

[You! Enemy!]

"Enemy, that's what I've been called. How pitiful."

[How! Here!]

"That's not important."

The mountain slowly tightens its grip on the sword in its hand.

The boundary is breached. The sole ash-gray color within the blackness swells up, revealing its fangs.

The monsters watching from behind are also caught off guard and begin to move. The mountain stretches out its arm towards them.

"I am your enemy. Then, there's only one thing we can do, right?"

The mountain draws its sword.

The ash-gray color bares its fangs.

* * *

KWA-A-A-A-A-ANG!

A massive sound erupts. The ash-gray color that emerged devours the blackness and charges forward, becoming a massive wave that covers the entire realm.

[AH-A-A-A!]

The sage lets out a scream and protects himself. His self-proclaimed "Unchanging Principle" is activated.

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power of the high god, which can block external interference and exist independently.

But all of that was buried in ashes.

The god of death, who had killed countless lives as a servant of the high god and had once devastated multiple planets, had disappeared without any meaning.

"Hmph."

Taesan smiled in satisfaction. In an instant, over a hundred monsters had been annihilated.

"Refreshing."

[Oh, oh, oh!] [Enemy!] [A vile foe is here!]

The monsters on the planet detected Taesan's presence and began to move.

[Bite him!] [Defile him!] [For the great ones!]

Countless monsters charged towards Taesan.

But that was not all. On other planets that had felt the ripple effect, monsters were also rushing towards him at high speed.

Their number was in the tens of millions.

Each and every one of them was at least an S-grade monster. The number of saints was not small either.

A group that could defile the entire universe if the transcendent being did not intervene.

But Taesan was unmoved.

"Come and see. Filthy things."

Taesan smiled. Chaos surrounded him.

[Oh, oh, oh!]"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The largest monster, with its huge mouth, charges forward. Taesan lightly swings his fist.

Quaaduk.

Starting from its mouth, the monster's body explodes.

And through the gap, the monster, divided into thousands of branches, tries to bind Taesan's entire body. It grabs his arms and legs and pulls them in.

Kkuuuk.

A powerful pressure is heading towards Taesan.

The monster, divided into thousands of branches, was not weak.

In terms of its level, it was above an S-grade monster.

Taesan responded very simply.

He just lightly shook his body.

Quaaduk!

And with that, the branches tear apart, and the monster disappears.

He stomps his foot. The compressed physical force explodes, sweeping the front area. Dozens of monsters burst apart at once. The surviving monsters are half-destroyed, crawling on the ground.

"If you can handle it, you should handle it."

These monsters are dangerous.

An S-grade monster can destroy a planet on its own.

The tens of thousands of monsters here all have powers beyond that.

If they were to spread to the universe, they would destroy half of it while the transcenders are busy dealing with the gods.

So, I'll take care of them first. With Taesan's hands.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ka-ga-ga-gak!"

The two aberrations, having defeated the monsters, charged forward.

Distorted, like a fog, their aberrant forms were twisted.

Taesan knew. Those two were exceptionally powerful, even among the monsters.

They were apostles.

Taesan didn't know, but those two apostles had become one, surpassing the limits of what an apostle could achieve. They were the apostles who had destroyed dozens of worlds, killed over ten immortals, and evaded the transcenders' eyes during the past war.

Even the transcenders had struggled to deal with them, but ultimately couldn't eliminate them - one of the beings who had made a name for themselves in the past war.

"Are they the apostles of the worthless?"

Taesan muttered to himself. The two apostles charged forward, becoming one. Strongly condensed, they rushed towards Taesan.

The power within them was capable of rendering an entire star meaningless, turning it into nothing.

However, Taesan still showed no particular expression.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The worthless servant's apostle swallowed the Taesan whole. He tried to make everything about Taesan meaningless.

But the apostle soon realized.

That his worthlessness was, in fact, killing him.

Quadduduk.

The dark energy surrounding Taesan. A boundary violation occurs. It dares to intervene with its own master, trampling and killing the filthy and unjust thing.

Quadduduk.

The apostle's dignity is torn apart in an instant.

The apostle struggles. Using the power of the worthless servant, he tries to shake off the boundary that is clinging to him and escape.

But it doesn't work.

The dark energy clings to him like a leech, preventing the apostle from escaping. And with a calm, yet brutal, expression, it swallows the worthless servant whole.

The apostle continues to struggle, but it's meaningless.

Quadduduk.

And finally, the dark energy swallows the worthlessness whole, making it its own.

The joyful roar of a beast is heard.

The two apostles, who had polluted the universe in a past war and had been a headache for the transcenders for a long time, were thus unable to do anything and perished.

Note: "Quadduduk" seems to be an onomatopoeic expression, possibly indicating a sound effect or a dramatic pause.
