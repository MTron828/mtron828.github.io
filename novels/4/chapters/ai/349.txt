Chapter 350

350. 74th Floor, the Battlefield of the Immortals (3)

This is the realm of the immortals. The fragments of the immortals floating in the air were undoubtedly powers that had transcended mortality. Taesan, who was still mortal, had no means to counter them.

Although he could manipulate divinity to push them back, the consumption of divinity would be extremely severe. It wasn't a good method.

So, he decided to use the power of black.

The power of black was the power of the high gods. It was a power that existed beyond the concepts of mortality and immortality. It had the potential to overcome the pressure of space itself.

However, he couldn't experiment with it here. Since it was an untested method, he needed to practice.

As the duration of the natural avatar's time was almost up, Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

Barbalb, who had been waiting, was surprised by Taesan's return after just a few hours.

[You're back already? Did you give up?]

"No."

Barbalb, who had been observing Taesan for a moment, realized something.

[... Ah. You've already completed the quest. You're much faster than I expected.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even if it's Taesan's power, I knew it was enough to clear it, but I didn't expect other adventurers to take years to clear it so quickly.

[The quest conditions have been met. If you want, I'll acknowledge your clearance of the 74th floor.]

Barbabamba thought Taesan would finish the 74th floor like this.

But Taesan shook his head.

"Not yet."

[...Are you going to continue to the 74th floor?]

"There are still four immortal relics left, aren't there?"

I won't turn back until I've confirmed all of them.

Barbabamba spoke in a hesitant tone, influenced by Taesan's resolute words.

[I acknowledge it. You're strong. Throughout the history of the labyrinth, no one has obtained power like yours at the entrance to the deep floor.]

Taesan was undoubtedly powerful. Even Barbabamba's eyes could see that he was on the verge of transcending mortality.

But that place was the realm of the immortals.

It was a place where the remnants of beings that had transcended mortality remained. Even Taesan couldn't continue the quest any further.

[I'm the administrator. Interfering with adventurers is not allowed, but I can still offer advice. Overconfidence will kill you. Sometimes, it's necessary to be satisfied with what you have and leave, even if you can't get everything.]"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not an exaggeration."

"It's enough," Taesan said, having obtained numerous skills while descending into the labyrinth. "I've judged it to be so."

Balbam didn't say anything more than that.

[You know my will. Then, what will you use to break through the realm of the immortals? For now, there's a limit.]

Balbam spoke quietly.

Taesan responded with action.

[You've activated the black.]

Whoa. Darkness burst out of Taesan's body.

It wasn't magic.

It was the power of an existence that defied the laws and principles of the world, located on the other side of the world.

[This is...].

Balbam let out a sigh.

The darkness, similar to ink, spread slowly across the ground.

[It's still unsettling even after seeing it again.]

Taesan's ability to wield the black was something he had seen before, but it was still unbelievable. A mortal being was using the power of the gods. It was truly incomprehensible.

Balbam quietly gathered his strength, preparing for when Taesan's black power would go out of control.

Taesan slowly tuned the overflowing black power.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He has become much stronger than when he first obtained the black color. Indeed, the black color has started to envelop his body according to Taesan's will.

'I can control it.'

But the problem was still significant.

The black color that enveloped his body was trying to devour Taesan's physical body.

Both his mind and body were under simultaneous pressure. Even with the resistance skill against mental contamination, it was hard to endure.

Taesan, who was pushed to his limits, put the black color back in.

He could handle it.

The problem was that he had to solve the contamination of his body and mind.

Taesan slowly finds an answer.

With skills like Sadohwa and Natural Avatar, he could somewhat resist the contamination. But it wasn't perfect. Even if he raised his level with Sadohwa, he couldn't resist the contamination of the black color.

Partial world transformation might be possible, but the duration was too short, making it impossible as well.

'In the end, it's divine power.'

A power that perfectly opposes the black color. With divine power, he could block and resist the contamination of the black color.

But that also had its own set of problems.

When the black color and divine power mixed, the boundary line was activated. Taesan could handle the boundary line to some extent, but it was only temporary."

Let me know if you have any further questions or need clarification on any part of the translation!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"While handling blackness and divinity, he makes sure not to mix them up, and controls them to a level where the boundary line doesn't activate.

He had never tried it before, and didn't even think it was possible. But Taesan was certain. He thought it was possible now.

Taesan wraps his body in blackness.

It wasn't a covering. He kept a slight distance from his physical body and wrapped the blackness around him, thinly, like a single layer of fabric.

What he aimed for was to balance divinity and blackness, pressing them against each other.

In reality, he had succeeded once before. When he defeated the true dragon, Jinryong, who had become a slave to the gods, he maintained the balance between divinity and blackness.

At that time, he used the infinitely recovering divinity to forcefully suppress the blackness, but it was possible because of people's direct faith. Now, it was impossible.

But Taesan didn't intend to wield such immense power. Just wrapping his body in it was enough.

And with that, he could handle blackness and divinity even more freely than before.

Taesan spread out his divinity.

His divinity came into contact with the blackness.

Crunch.

A distorted sound echoed, and a gray figure began to appear. Balbambara clicked his tongue and gathered his strength."

[Can it be stopped?]

Balbambara knew the power hidden within him.

A power that distorts the laws. As the administrator, he had absolute authority in the labyrinth, but he couldn't guarantee that he could stop it. Balbambara was prepared for the shock.

A tremendous power, a power that transcended boundaries, began to reveal itself to the world.

Taesan focused his mind.

What he desired was not a collision between divinity and darkness.

Although they repelled each other, he wanted to achieve balance.

Then.

Taesan instinctively found the answer.

Kiying.

The pure white ring shone brightly. With the ring's assistance, he controlled divinity.

Divinity and darkness began to rotate in opposite directions.

The two powers, which had been trying to mix, began to rotate separately and find balance.

Kagagaga.

As time passed, the initially repelling divinity and darkness eventually separated stably.

Balbambara, who had been gathering power, stopped.

[That's...].

"It's done."

Taesan took a deep breath.

Divinity was thinly wrapped around Taesan's body. And darkness was fluttering above it.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As much as the blackness was blocked by the divine, it couldn't stick to Taesan, and the contamination of the mind and body didn't occur either.

Success.

At the same time, the system window appeared.

[[Boundary Rebound] was obtained.] [The proficiency of the boundary line has risen to @#!3@.]

Taesan, who had separated blackness and divinity, opened the skill window.

[Boundary Rebound] [Proficiency: ?] [Something between laws and beyond laws. It repels and pulls out divinity and blackness.]

The explanation of the boundary line was similar, but different. The boundary line had content that handled divinity and blackness, but Boundary Rebound had an explanation that repelled and pulled out.

Taesan activated blackness and divinity again.

Because he had obtained the skill, it was a bit easier to handle than before.

Kagagak.

Divinity and blackness rotated in different directions, not mixing with each other.

Success.

Taesan smiled and turned off Boundary Rebound. The ghost murmured, seemingly unimpressed.

[What will you get next? Will you try handling blackness alone?]

"That's still impossible."

But if time passes and I become stronger, it might become possible.

The quiet Babambam opened its mouth.

[This is ridiculous.]"

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His voice was filled with complexity.

[It's really unbelievable.]

Divinity is the power of God.

Black is the power of the High God.

By harnessing the powers of two opposing existences, he achieved a stable outcome.

It was an unprecedented feat. As the administrator of the labyrinth, even Balbamja, who had faced numerous gods and adventurers, found it hard to accept.

[Are you going back?]

"Yes."

[This time, I'll go too.]

Balbamja intended to verify the power that Taesan had obtained.

Balbamja gathered his strength. The space was reversed, and Taesan moved to Balhaluni.

This time, Balbamja was also by Taesan's side.

Taesan activated the boundary repulsion.

As the blue light barrier emerged, the fragments of the Immortal scattered throughout the world began to pressure Taesan.

But it was different from before.

The world's pressure, upon touching the black, was erased and couldn't reach Taesan.

Neither the apostle's power, nor the natural god's power, nor the king's vessel was used, yet Taesan was able to overcome the world's pressure without any burden.

[...What is this?]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Balbambara was stunned and murmured to himself.

The gap between mortality and immortality was unbridgeable. No matter how hard one tried, it was impossible, a kind of law.

But Gosin was an existence beyond that law.

It wasn't strange that he was breaking the boundary between mortality and immortality.

It was just strange that Taesan, a mortal, was doing it.

[…….]

It's dangerous.

The power Taesan possessed was too heterogenous.

If someone who could withstand the power of an immortal with a mortal's strength were to gain an even higher strength, what would happen?

They could even break the laws of the labyrinth.

The administrator's instinct warned of that future.

But Balbambara did nothing.

The wizard and the god had already met Taesan and understood his heterogeneity. Yet, they didn't move.

Then, he didn't need to do anything either. He would leave the rest to them.

[Then, I'll just go back. Let them handle it.]

"Alright."

Balbambara's figure disappeared.

Taesan erased the overwhelming power with blackness and moved forward."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This is the realm of the Immortal. The power that crushes mortal bodies and shatters spirits is spreading in all directions.

But it doesn't reach Taesan.

[This is really ridiculous.]

It's different from Balbambara, but even the ghost found it hard to accept.

[In reality, even if you're a transcendent being, as long as you're holding onto it, it's impossible to mentally suppress it, right?]

It wasn't strange to accept it like that. But Taesan shook his head.

"It's impossible to go that far."

Taesan, who was using it directly, knew that. It wasn't a power that could be used in multiple ways.

"I somehow regained my balance, but it's still precarious."

He wrapped his body in a thin layer of divine energy and black energy, rotating them in different directions to maintain balance. In theory, it was perfect.

But because it required delicate adjustments, he could only bring out a tiny amount of power.

"I can hold out right now because I'm not relying on the power spreading throughout this place."

It wasn't a power directed at Taesan personally. The remnants of the Immortal were left in the air, crushing everything that existed.

The power only acts, it doesn't have a will. That's why it could be erased with a boundary reaction."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And the consumption of concentration is also great."

"If the balance of power wavers even a little, it's possible that the boundary line will be crossed and the mountain will be covered."

"Delicate management was necessary throughout the activation process."

"But even so, it was true that I could roam freely in the realm of the immortal without any burden."

"As my proficiency increased and the mountain's intensity grew, the utilization rate also increased."

"More than anything, if this kind of utilization is possible, there may be other ways to utilize the divine and black colors."

"There's value in experimenting with this and that."

"I can obtain a different power, distinct from the one I've obtained so far. I headed towards the place where the mountain's intense power could be felt."

"The mountain, surrounded by the boundary repulsion, did not stop its steps."

"In the end, the mountain discovered the immortal's relic."

"The relic emitted an extremely strong power, but the black color surrounding the mountain erased it all."

"The mountain planted its flag."

"Ki-ki-kiing."

"A massive veil covered the immortal's relic."

"Now it's set."

"The mountain continued to move forward."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I was able to use the holy and black colors for a long time because I reduced the consumption value so much.

As a result, Taesan was able to find two more immortal relics in an instant.

Now, only one remains. At this rate, I'll be able to clear the 74th floor in no time.

[Those guys would be really surprised if they saw this.]

The guides have been stuck here for a long time.

But Taesan was making progress towards clearing the floor with ease.

This meant that there was a huge gap between the guides and Taesan.

[My head is going to hurt soon.]

The ghost had some connection with the guides, so it knew. 

The fact that the wizard, Shaian, who had made all the preparations, fought Taesan and lost meant that none of the guides could beat Taesan one-on-one. That's what it meant to be a seated wizard.

I think they're probably crumbling right about now.

From the start, it wasn't about having a specific ideology or being bound together by camaraderie. We gathered to conquer the floor, and our goal was to clear it. As the foundation of the guides crumbles, there will be many who will stray from the path."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"However, I'll find a way somehow."

When the ghost saw it, it was impossible with their power.

The ghost's wish was getting closer and closer.

It was enjoyable before, but not now.

The ash-colored woman, Sosiet Gardenia.

The ghost himself cherished and helped many people, but she was a guide who betrayed him.

The ghost's mind was complicated.

He was in agony, and Taesan proceeded with the 74th floor quest. Before long, he found the immortal's relic in the distance.

"A machine?"

The last immortal's relic was made up of mechanical devices. It had a humanoid robot-like appearance.

[It's not like only organic life exists in the universe. There must have been mechanical life forms that went down to the labyrinth too.]

I thought it was possible, but this was the first time I saw it directly. Taesan opened the space.

"This is the end."

The 74th floor clearance was right in front of him. Taesan planted the flag on the ground.

Cheers.

A blue curtain formed.

[Quest complete.]

Taesan found all the immortals' relics in Valhalla.

At the same time, a massive power engulfed the world.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan was not affected, but it was the power of the Transcender that enveloped the entire world.

"Is it all over?"

The power of the Immortal overlapped and accumulated, making it impossible for the Transcender to intervene. If they did, it could give the gods an opportunity to intervene.

But now, Taesan had grasped the location of all the Immortal's relics.

With the quest complete and everything settled, it seemed that the Transcenders were also going to intervene.

"It looks quite urgent."

[The gods are watching, so they're trying to wrap things up quickly... But isn't it too hasty? You haven't even returned to the labyrinth yet?]

Taesan observed the power of the Transcender, who was collecting the Immortal's relics.

There was no emotion whatsoever in that power.

The world was being purified. The scattered fragments of the Immortal were being erased, and the Immortal's relics were disappearing one by one. The power contained in the mechanical Immortal relic in front of Taesan was also gradually disappearing.

At that moment, the sky opened up.

A black power from beyond the laws of the universe began to descend, forming a pillar.

The power of the Transcender, which enveloped the entire world, rose up. It pushed back the black pillar and trampled it down.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But an extremely small, thread-like power touched the immortal's remains.

Keening.

[……Huh?]

The immortal's entire body began to radiate light. A red glow flickered in the pupils, as if warning of something.

At the same time, a powerful force surged forth.

The boundary that surrounded the Taishan Mountains was momentarily distorted. The Taishan Mountains hastily gathered their strength and created distance.

Ku-gu-gu-gung…….

A loud rumbling sound echoed.

The immortal's remains were rising.

"Clearly, he's dead, right?"

There was no sense of life or will. The immortal's soul was not present here.

But the immortal's body rose.

Recognizing the Taishan Mountains, it identified them as an enemy.

Ki-ii-ii-ing!

The mechanical devices made noise as they operated. The lifeless killing intent directly targeted the Taishan Mountains.
