Chapter 233

233. 54th Floor (1)

The skill that had changed one more time was the consecutive attack.

The consecutive attack added an additional damage bonus and had a stacking effect. This was due to the ability sword's effect, which caused the sword to slash twice simultaneously.

And now, an additional effect has been added.

[Special Activation Skill: Consecutive Attack] [Mana Consumption: 3] [Mastery: 34%] [Use the next attack twice. The damage has increased slightly. There is no restriction on time or space.] [Condition: Advanced Swordsmanship [Ability Sword] [1. The physical laws of the next attack will be attempted twice.] [2. It is possible to simultaneously execute two types of physical sword techniques, including a reflective sword technique. The user can adjust the reflective sword technique to some extent. This effect lasts for a certain period of time.] [One of the two effects can be selected and used.]
Here is the translation of the text:

It was most effective to use everything directly. Taesan passed through the tunnel and found the monster. The vortex's shape rushed towards Taesan.

[You have activated continuous attacks.]

The sword flashed.

And then, a black sword flashed.

Kaka!

Taesan's sword and the black sword clashed together, sending the monster flying. Despite the monster's defense, it was quickly pierced and torn apart.

[The vortex dealt 5312 damage.] [The vortex dealt 1232 damage.]

The monster couldn't withstand it and fell to the ground.

Taesan, who had confirmed the effect, nodded his head.

"It's okay."

The damage was roughly around 20%. Unlike the previous effect, it was unable to generate shock when the sword clashed with the opponent, but the chaotic sword attack made the defense more difficult. Both sides had clear advantages, making it possible to use it according to the situation.

Additionally, there were skills added to the ability sword due to the rise in proficiency.
Here is the translation of the text:

"[Special Skill: Stealth] [Hide one's body and eliminate sensory detection. However, it's still quite unrefined.] [Conditions: Advanced Swordsmanship [Sword Ability] [Can be activated when hiding one's appearance from the enemy during combat. Lasts for 1 second, during which the enemy's detection is completely disabled. Activation ends if one's appearance is directly revealed.]]

'Is it a defense against exploration?'

It's hard to say exactly what effect it has, but if it can make it impossible to detect even the most minute changes in physical appearance, it would be quite useful. It would be possible to launch a surprise attack even in a direct confrontation, depending on the combat environment.

[Special Skill: Frenzied Sword] [Mana consumption: 50] [Increases damage by threefold. This skill cannot be used again for one hour after activation.] [Conditions: Advanced Swordsmanship [Sword Ability]] [If activated, the shock of collision with the enemy's weapon increases by threefold.]

The effect of Frenzied Sword has been transferred to a physical effect. As expected, it's a good effect. It can create a significant variable during combat, making it even more useful than the basic effect.

There were three new skills added or modified. Additionally, the effects of existing skills such as dodging and countering have been strengthened.

The ghost was impressed.

'[You've been quite busy dealing with the enemies you've faced recently, but these skills are definitely different from before.]'"
Here is the translation of the text:

The beast that leads the world to destruction. The power of a weakened noble spirit. In the end, it's not about individual skills, but about overall strength and might.

It's only against heterogeneous enemies that the Ability Sword didn't fully unleash its power.

However, when fighting against humanoids of the same kind, unless they are overwhelmingly strong, we would have to fight hard and take a beating. Even just a sudden change in the continuous attack would cause the opponent to feel like they're fighting two people at once.

The effects of the Ability Sword are fully revealed against humanoids.

In other words, they were the guides of the sinful path.

"Will they ever come?"

[As I looked at the demon, I didn't think they were planning to do anything immediately...... I don't know what's going on. Even if there are many 60th-level adventurers, we can fight each other, but since they're not sending anyone, it seems like they're plotting something.]

The ghost who was speaking suddenly smiled.

[And now it seems almost over.]

60th-level adventurers.

Once they're done, there's a high possibility that the next one will be the top officials.

Tae-san gazed blankly at his sword.

The power of the mad spirit infused in the sword became even stronger.

Preparations were being made one by one.

Tae-san grasped his sword tightly and broke through the confusion.

* * *
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san broke through to the 54th floor. He discovered the secret room and processed the boss.

And he didn't stop there, advancing to the 55th floor.

The monsters on the 55th floor were interfering with people's minds, showing a sense of welcome and breaking people's spirits. Of course, Tae-san was not affected at all.

He processed the secret room completely and defeated the boss.

While clearing the 55th floor, the changed equipment was two pieces.

[Ring of Azura with remnants of the afterimage] [Intelligence + 100] [Defense + 100] [Magic + 30] [The afterimage of Azura was embedded in the ring. The magical aura contained within was originally meant to change the world.]

[Moja of the Great Sage] [Defense + 120] [Magic + 40] [Action speed + 7%] [This is a hat that the Great Sage used in the past. It has great value and power.]

Both changed equipment were related to magic. The other equipment obtained was all magical equipment.

"Are these mysterious things related to the theme?"

[It's possible.]

Tae-san organized the things he had obtained.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was almost time. The people who had finished preparing were all gathered, determined.

Tai Shan went back up the labyrinth again.

54th floor. He entered the hidden room. Ririsu was waiting for him there.

"Yah! It's been a long time!"

Ririsu smiled with a happy face. Her face was much brighter than before.

"Thanks to you, I was able to enter the 50th floor and see for myself that people's affairs are unpredictable."

She murmured to herself with a new look in her eyes. 51st floor. A forest full of mystery. To her, who was pursuing magic itself, it was like a treasure trove. She enjoyed verifying each and every one of them, even if she couldn't fully utilize them.

As she gazed happily at Tai Shan, Barkaruga appeared before her.

"...Hello?"

[I'm glad to meet you. You're the first human I've seen here.]

"Magic?"

Tai Shan nodded his head. Ririsu gazed at Barkaruga with a calm expression and sighed in amazement.

"You're really strong... I can even go down 50 floors with just one of these magic spells."

[I am a being who has received power directly from the king. No matter how mysterious it is, its meaning does not fade away.]

Baruka said proudly.

Rilis turned her gaze to Taesan.

"Is this because of the tribute?"

"Yes."

Taesan took out his magical equipment. There were not a few, and their quality was quite high. Rilis's eyes sparkled.

"Wow... These are good equipment. With this quantity, the quality is sufficient."

"I came hoping for this."

"Good. Wait for a moment."

Rilis struggled to move the equipment.

"Okay. Now we can pray to the God of Magic."

Taesan sat down in front of the tribute.

He closed his eyes and prayed.

Then, Taesan's spirit moved in response to the God's summons.

The God of Magic, Jerubad, was there. He was sitting on his throne in the middle of the galaxy, just like before. Taesan bowed his body.

"I pay my respects to the God of Magic."

[Yes.]

Jerubad replied briefly.

There was a mysterious light in his gaze as he looked at Taesan.

It was not hard to guess the reason.

[I don't know. How should I use the power you possess?]
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's a shame I can't erase their traces, but that's because it's your own power you've gained. As an immortal, I can't intervene in the affairs of mortals. Be careful how you use it."

"Thank you."

But even though Taesan obtained the power of the gods, he didn't seem to think about intervening.

"For now, I'll let it slide. You've managed to hold your own as a mortal. Even though you've transcended space and time, as long as you're not someone who's reached a peak state, your mind would've been unable to withstand it."

Jerbrand smiled slightly.

"Actually, it's a strange story that you've obtained their power. Your mind is still unshaken. That's your unique trait, I suppose."

His face lit up with interest.

"Were you hoping to become someone like yourself, a wizard? That's interesting. I should meet you again sometime."

"That's what you're saying, isn't it?"

Taesan didn't know. Jerbrand smiled mischievously.

"Are you curious?"

Taesan nodded. Jerbrand leaned back in his chair.

"I can only answer you the same as before."

"Are you still lacking in power?"

"I've made some progress, but I'm not aware of the secrets. But... you've made me happy, so I'll tell you one thing."

(Note: The text appears to be a conversation between two characters, Taesan and Jerbrand, with a fantasy setting. The conversation revolves around Taesan's newfound power and his relationship with Jerbrand, who seems to be a wizard or a powerful being.)
Here is the translation of the text:

Zerban opened his mouth.

"What is needed to become a transcendent being?"

"Is it not strength and power?"

The strength of transcendence, and the power that matches it. If one only has power, they will become an immortal being, but if one has both, they will become a transcendent being. That was the fundamental principle known to Tai Shan.

[But even those two are not necessary. One's mind must also reach a certain level.]

"I think that's only natural, but..."

It's unlikely that the mind of someone as strong as that would be weak. It's clear that they have reached a certain level.

But Zerban shook his head.

[It's not just about being exceptional or transcendent. There are even immortal beings whose minds have gone astray. It's a certain condition, I suppose. One must satisfy that condition to become a transcendent being or an immortal being. So, what is that condition?]

Zerban applauded.

[That's as far as I can go. The rest is for you to figure out yourself. Or become stronger and find the answer yourself.]

"I understand."

[Then I'll do what you want.]

Zerban's energy is gathering.
Here is the translation of the text:

The transcendent will was implanted in Taesan.

[You have learned the intermediate magic [Stellar Arrow].] [Although the value of magic is slightly lacking in terms of material benefits, it's still a service.]

"Thank you."

[Are you going to leave now?]

Taesan nodded his head. Jerbrand chuckled.

[I'll be waiting. Let you play.]

The world became distant after that.

Taesan had returned to the labyrinth again.

"Ugh..."

The place he returned to was where Relics was holding her breath with a flushed face.

When Taesan obtained the intermediate magic, Relics also obtained it simultaneously. That was the agreement. Satisfaction appeared on Relics' face.

"This is good."

[Since it's not even worth using due to mana shortage, is it really that good?]

"It doesn't matter. What's important is that the great power has taken residence within me."

Relics smiled widely.

"Thanks."

Taesan nodded and left outside.

The next one was Halfdan, the blacksmith. He had entrusted the materials and commissioned the production of a new item.

Let's go to the 50th floor to meet Halfdan. He presented some decent equipment.
And now it's time to return to Earth.
