Chapter 598

598. Extra Story, Mashin (10)

[Ugh!] [Ugh!]

Baal, demons, and agents are all pushed back without exception. The intense battle suddenly subsides.

The dust settles, and his figure comes into view.

A black-haired man who feels nothing.

[…Gang Tae-san.]

Baal mutters quietly.

[Come to think of it.]

Gang Tae-san had disappeared at some point.

But Baal didn't realize that fact. It was as if there was a hole in his memory.

‘What’s going on.’

He is a being from before the creation of the world. The concept of forgetfulness does not exist. He has remembered everything he has seen and felt from the beginning of time to the present.

But despite that, he had completely forgotten about Tae-san.

Tae-san pats Baal on the back.

"I'll go, it's almost over anyway."

[Who are you...?]

"As I said before, I'm a traveler."

Tae-san says lazily.

"If I must add, I'm a traveler who's favorable to you. Go ahead."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Gang Tae-san raised his finger and pointed to the village. Within it, a concept was slowly taking shape and forming a figure.

"Can't you see the last part with your own two eyes?"

[...That's right.]

Ba-al let out a faint smile.

[Then thank you. I'll take care of it.]

Ba-al turned his body around. The demon and the proxy were still there, and they were strong. Even the great Ba-al himself couldn't guarantee an easy victory.

But there was no need to worry anymore.

Ba-al entered the village. Tae-san took Ba-al's place.

"It's come to this."

Ba-al would have blocked the proxy and demons.

He must have gone all the way to the brink of destruction.

And just as he was about to reach the end, the demon god was born.

And the demon god would have saved Ba-al and taken care of them.

I've seen everything I needed to see.

Then from now on, he could move as he pleased.

[...You.]

The proxies were wary of Tae-san.

A stranger.

Nothing could be felt.

Even though he was right in front of them, if they blocked their physical sight, they wouldn't even know he existed.

A perfect nothingness.

The proxies swallowed their saliva.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They were excluded, and the ashen color was beyond understanding. It was not of the universe, nor was it theirs.

It was not divine.

Nor was it transcendent.

A dangerous heterogeneity.

[...Who are you, but please step aside.]

The agent spoke politely.

[This is our business, so please don't interfere.]

"Do you dislike it?"

Taesan smiled faintly.

"I have no intention of stepping aside. You can either back down or make me step aside. Choose one of the two."

[This, this rat-like thing!]

Belial, who had finally come to his senses, charged forward. The level of the devil was not comparable to that of the transcendent. He had not fully grasped the true nature of Taesan's power.

And Belial had to pay the price for it.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The darkness exploded, and Belial's black magic enveloped his body.

It was Belial's authority.

A magnificent power that had become a beast made of magic, trampling and crushing all things. It was his proud authority that had destroyed numerous planets.

Belial's beast approached Taesan's vicinity.

And Taesan lightly waved his finger.

Quard-quard-quard!

[Uggghhh!]"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Belial's beast burst like a balloon. Its body was trampled in an instant and crushed into the ground.

"'You and I have a strange relationship.'"

Taesan muttered. He had forcibly taken over Belial's domain and become a demon.

"'This is also a strange fate, so I'll at least send you off without pain.'"

Thud.

That was the end.

Belial was dead.

[Uh?] [Ah.]

The demon was dead.

Its existence was erased, completely wiped out.

Fear spread among them in an instant. The demons screamed and tried to flee, but it was impossible.

"'You can't go.'"

[You have activated the Declaration of the Boundary.]

Kiiing!

A massive curtain enveloped them. The demons were shocked and pounded on the curtain, but it didn't budge, like concrete.

[…It seems you're determined to go all the way.]

The agents pulled out their strength. They cried out to their master, who existed high in the sky.

[Our lord! Lend us your power! Your dignity! Your enemy-destroying might!]

A prayer to the great god.

It reached the distant being. The great god's power and dignity had to descend upon them.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But nothing is accomplished.

A strange stillness flows. The agents are bewildered.

[Huh, what?] [Are you a demon lord?]

"If you're going to come down, then come down."

Taesan speaks calmly.

"Even if it's a fake in a parallel world, it's not bad to kill you here either."

[You're a demon lord! You're a demon lord!]

The agents wail, but nothing happens. The demon lord has completely blocked their connection, like a coward.

"Rat."

Taesan laughs.

"You're just strong, but you don't even have the qualifications or will to match that strength. You're nothing but trash in this fake world."

Even with such blatant contempt, the demon lord doesn't move. Taesan has lost interest too. The agents falter.

[Huh, ah.]

"Then, die."

Taesan draws his sword, Bardray.

* * *

Baal slowly walks through the village.

There, the bodies of the demon tribe, whose souls have escaped, remain.

Their souls will now forever belong to the demon tribe.

Note: "마신" (mashin) is translated to "demon lord", but it can also be translated to "devil" or "evil god" depending on the context.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As a curse to worship Lucifer, I will remain with the demon tribe, torn apart by Galgari.

[You will remember me.]

With a short phrase, Baal continued to move forward, and there was also the corpse of the governor.

He had a very satisfied face.

[Your wish has been fulfilled. You must be satisfied.]

And Baal went down to the underground.

There, Lucifer was present.

She was floating in the air, becoming one concept. Her power and strength had reached an unprecedented level.

Originally, she would not have been able to withstand it and her body and mind would have collapsed.

But she was a vessel of the transcendent.

The demon tribe's faith in itself was contained within her.

It was a promised faith.

Although she was a god, it was not a problem even if she was a transcendent. As long as the demon tribe existed and the curse on them was not lifted, she would be the demon god.

Baal sat down in his place.

[Now that I think about it, you told me.]"

Note: The text appears to be a passage from a fantasy novel or game, and the translation may not be perfect due to the complexity of the language and the cultural context.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$'You are twisted. Unlike the other ancient beings, you do not see us as mere toys. You have quite a bit of passion and perseverance, enduring tedium and trying to do something. I wonder what that is. What is it that you want from us?'

At that time, Baal couldn't answer, but now he could.

['I envy you.']

They are immutable.

They do not change.

From before the universe was born until now, they have never changed.

The ancient beings take pride in this, but Baal did not. To be unchanging forever, that was too horrifying for him.

They do not change.

Then what is the purpose of their existence?

He wondered what he could leave behind in this world, what kind of change he could bring about.

There is nothing he cannot do.

In contrast, the existences of the universe change.

They gain power, reach great heights, grow old, die, and their souls scatter.

He was extremely envious.

[Envying and fascinated.]

He wanted to see their changes. Even if it was just a substitute, he wanted to experience it. That was why he created the small model garden with the demons.

But it was only a pastime. He did not truly immerse himself in it. For they are who they are, and Baal is Baal.

However, Lucifer was different.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"At least to Baal, Lucifer was not just a simple stranger.

He was captivated by the existence of Lucifer and its possibilities.

[Even if he becomes a transcendent being, there will still be many problems.]

When Lucifer becomes the demon king, he must liberate the demon world.

In other words, he must confront the current demon king directly.

Lucifer was strong, but he had many weaknesses. As a created god, his power utilization was insufficient, and his knowledge was also very low.

Then, Baal could help him with that.

As a transcendent being, Baal could teach him about knowledge and power utilization.

And about the other transcendent beings in the universe.

Baal thought he would tell him everything he knew.

[Is this the role of a mentor, as humans would say?]

That role seemed quite enjoyable too.

Kiiiing!

The power that was wildly fluctuating began to stabilize slowly.

The vessel of Lucifer was filled with magic.

Lucifer opened his eyes.

And the world ended.

Taesan returned.

Back to his original world.

[Did you come?]

The demon king was waiting beside Taesan, as if he had been waiting."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I've seen what you desire, even if it's not everything."

[Really? How was it?]

"It was amazing."

Lucifer was a god created for the sake of the demon tribe, with a pure and noble intention.

As long as the demon tribe existed, she would exist as a god. That was her faith, and also her concept.

[What about the rest?]

Her black eyes gazed at the distant mountains. Within them, there was a light that yearned for something.

[I am a god created for the demon tribe.]

The demon tribe's faith in Lucifer was not natural. It was a curse that was forced upon them, a kind of brainwashing.

[If they knew this, it wouldn't be strange if the demon tribe resented me.]

From the moment I was born, I was forced to have faith in someone, and I would even sacrifice my life for their sake.

That was a cruel truth.

"But you tried to become a god."

In a way, she was also a victim. Because of her role as a vessel for the transcendent being, she was forced to receive the demon tribe's faith and play the role of protecting them.

Note: The translation tries to maintain the original tone and nuance of the text, but some phrases may have been rephrased for better clarity in English.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

More than anything, Mashin had a choice. She could have accepted Baal's suggestion and run away alone, living her own life.

But she didn't do that.

For the sake of the demon tribe, for their freedom, she became a god.

And she fulfilled her role as Mashin with devotion.

She cherished and protected the demon tribe like her own children.

"You are Mashin."

Even if she was created, Mashin was still Mashin.

Taesan bowed his head respectfully.

"I will respect and admire you, Mashin, Lucifer."

[……That's right.]

Mashin spoke in a small voice, with a somewhat relieved expression.

[Thank you.]

"Did you get the answer you wanted?"

[It's enough. You've worked hard, Taesan.]

Mashin smiled faintly.

[There are many other things I want to say, but there's still plenty of time.]

Let's think about it slowly, Mashin muttered to herself.

[We'll continue to be together from now on.]

"What. That's right, I suppose."

Whether it's Lucifer or not, she has escaped the shackles of fate. From now on, she will continue to build strong relationships.

[Let's have tea later.]

"If you wish."

The task was over. It was time for Taesan to quietly take his leave.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Ah, that's right.]

Mashin opened his mouth. As he continued to speak, Taesan scrunched up his face.

* * *

Taesan had returned to Earth.

[I'm back.]

"Have you been waiting too?"

[I'm curious about your opinion, just like that kid.]

Ba'al was sitting on a rock.

[So, how was it?]

"It's somewhat as I expected, but it's still surprising to see it in person."

Taesan looked at Ba'al.

"Lucifer was your child, wasn't it?"

They didn't even share the same blood, and their fundamental nature was different. Lucifer and Ba'al were irreconcilable enemies who couldn't coexist.

But the two of them were connected by a bond stronger than anyone else's.

Ba'al only allowed Lucifer to see his true emotions.

[Like a child.]

Ba'al muttered to himself.

[We are solitary, complete beings. We have our own kind, but there is no affection between us. We don't have a sense of belonging to a family. My kind is perfect, they say, and they praise themselves for it.]

"But you weren't like that."

Ba'al hated that perfection.

He detested the unchanging and yearned for change.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, he was fascinated by Lucifer.

[That's right. It's not a wrong thing to say.]

Baal murmured. After a brief silence, he asked Taesan.

[I'm an absolute traitor who can't be forgiven by the gods. In a way, I'm a rebel who betrayed my own kind.]

"I don't deny it."

Taesan looked at Baal.

"But you seem to be satisfied."

[I am satisfied. I've never regretted it even once.]

"Then that's enough. Other people's criticism and condemnation mean nothing to you. You're a god, after all."

Baal chuckled.

[That's right. I'm a god.]

An unchanging existence.

Others can't give him any meaning, value, or change. That's because he's alone and unchanging.

Only Lucifer was an exception.

[Well, I enjoyed it too. I should spend more time with that kid again.]

"That's fortunate."

[I'm free from now on. But you seem to be busier than I thought.]

"That's right."

Marsin said to Taesan before leaving."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
