Article 237

237. The Fourth Return. Earth (4)

"Ah, no!"

People scream and fall down. A man in front of me frantically swings a hammer to clear the way, but the monsters rushing towards him only push him back instead of clearing the way.

'What a pain!'

The man scowled at his face.

His name is Choi Tae-man. He was the leader of Busan.

And Busan was the worst place at this moment, next to Jeju Island.

The reason was simple. All kinds of misfortunes existed in Busan.

As it was said that Busan was the second capital, many people existed, but the ratio of hard mode players was significantly lower than in other regions.

Although the mode was not divided into a fixed ratio, but was left to individual choice, the difference was particularly large in Busan.

And since there were fewer hard mode players, the number of easy and normal players was large. And many players gained a kind of speaking right.

They began to pressure the hard mode players. "You powerful ones, please protect us," they said.
Here is the translation of the text:

Despite the hard mode players expressing their discontent, their numbers were too few. Those who still held modern societal values chose to compromise rather than confront each other.

And once those who had power had a taste of it, they would continue to wield it.

Compared to the relatively small number of hard mode players, and the conflicts between players, the atmosphere was tense.

It was unlikely that the quest would proceed normally. As a result, the majority of the group died. By the time the third revival ended, the number of survivors had dwindled to the point where they could be counted on one's fingers.

Gwaah!

Taihai brutally slaughtered the monsters.

In the chaotic situation, he was chosen as the leader and tried to save as many people as possible.

He managed to persuade the remaining survivors, including the normal mode players, to avoid killing each other. Those who had chosen to confront each other had all died, and the remaining ones had all chosen to abstain from conflict rather than confront each other.

Some of them even bothered to make a noise, so the hard mode players were also filled with anger.

But it was already too late. With the absolute numbers being so low, they had to prioritize surviving the monster's attacks. Eventually, their numbers continued to dwindle.

He looked back as he fought off the monsters.
Here is the translation of the text:

The number of people chasing him had noticeably decreased.

Choi Tae-man's eyes were trembling. It had only been 20 minutes since he started. But so many people had died...?

"...?"

The word "extermination" flashed through his mind.

Ku-uuu-uuu!

A giant monster moved its body to strike his head.

Choi Tae-man barely managed to block it. His body was pushed back violently.

His eyes became dull.

Just as he was about to make a decision, the monster's body burst forth, and it rushed towards him.

Pfftt-! Pfftt-!

And the monsters were crushed like dominoes. The pupils of the people who were crying and resigned to death became larger.

"Ah, ah?"

Through the fallen monster's bodies, a calm-faced man appeared.

He looked around at the people of Busan and muttered to himself.

"They're much fewer than I expected. It's no wonder they didn't make it."

"Who are you?"

"I'm Kang Tae-san."

The people shuddered. They also knew about Kang Tae-san from the community, as a being who had survived among the people of Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, like a monster.

Kang Tae-san said.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I decided to head to Busan."

"But it's only been 20 minutes since the quest began......"

"I've worked hard, so I'll take a break and sort these things out first."

A hundred or so monsters are running towards us.

"Danger......"

Just as Cho Tae-man was about to say something, Taesan's hand trembled.

The monsters suddenly burst out in unison.

* * *

"Come in."

Taesan handed them cooked corn, and the people eagerly received it.

Cho Tae-man also ate one ear of corn in one minute.

"Are you full now? We should have brought some food from the labyrinth, shouldn't we?"

"...But it's been a long time since we've eaten corn."

The food in the labyrinth is stale and lacks flavor. While it can fill one's stomach, it's impossible to enjoy the pleasure of eating.

Cho Tae-man looked at the last corn kernel with a regretful gaze.

Taesan pulled out another ear of corn.

Water dripped from his hand onto the corn, wrapping it around. The water began to boil.

"Alright."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Almost instantly, I handed over the cooked corn to Chae Taeman."

Chae Taeman received it with a pale face.

"Is it possible for something like that to happen?"

"I got something recently."

Thanks to Beatrice's quest, I was able to exercise influence over nature and the power was at a level that could even interfere with the weather.

Summoning water to boil was not a problem. Chae Taeman's expression turned grim, but he quickly disposed of the corn and opened his mouth.

"Thanks. I'm alive thanks to you."

"It's not something to be thankful for."

It's only natural for humans to help each other.

"Still, gratitude is necessary. It's a matter of conscience. We've seen a lot of blood because of people who aren't like us."

Chae Taeman smiled wryly.

"Do you know what kind of situation we were in?"

"Sort of."

A place where people clashed and was wiped out. That place was Busan. In my past life, Seoul was on shaky ground, but I didn't know how it managed to survive, but Busan couldn't even hold on.

"I've heard that Seoul and Gyeonggi Province were similar."

I'm a mid-mode player. Chae Jung-hyeok. And the hard-mode player. Seo Jang-san.
Here is the translation of the text:

They formed a group for their own purposes and tried to manage others.

And they had solved all the problems by themselves.

"If you were in Busan..."

They would have solved Busan's problems and survived as well.

Tae-man's face turned gloomy as he muttered to himself.

It's already over and it's meaningless. Even if I pay attention to such things, it won't help with survival, as I have learned from my past experiences.

Tae-man lifted his head with a determined expression.

"As long as you're here, we can survive and make it to Seoul."

They can survive.

The faces of people who had taken a rest looked hopeful at this fact.

"Well..."

Tae-san whispered softly.

The wind will blow. It's always been that way.

"What's going to happen this time?"

*Tae-san took the people from Busan to Seoul.

And then, other people also contacted their respective groups.

Gang-jun-hyeok met the people from Gwangju and defeated the monster after taking them to Seoul.
Here is the translation of the text:

With the help of Kang Jun-hyeok, they gradually made progress. As the night fell, they felt tired and took a rest.

A woman approached Kang Jun-hyeok, who was standing on the edge of a cliff.

"Hello."

The woman was the leader of the people from Gwangju. When she was blocked by monsters and thought she was going to die, Kang Jun-hyeok had saved her.

"Ah, hello."

"What are you doing standing there? You could have left it to someone else. We should be able to do something like that."

"No, I have to do this myself. I can't do otherwise."

Kang Jun-hyeok shook his head. The woman's face turned slightly red.

"Honestly, I thought you were exaggerating when I heard it from Hwi-yeon, but you're really strong... If you're like that, then the person called Kang Tae-san must be strong too?"

"No."

"Then?"

Kang Jun-hyeok denied it. The woman was taken aback and he said:

"It's not even comparable to that."

He gazed into the darkness with a strange gaze.

"Why are you so strong? It's not just that."

Before leaving, Tae-san told them one thing.

"Kururung."

A loud noise echoed from the other side. The ground cracked and a monster appeared.
Here is the translation of the text:

"[Monster 111026 has appeared.]"

"Uh."

The woman's face turned stiff.

The monster itself was not unusual. She had already killed hundreds of them.

However, the monster in front of her was different.

I can feel its power and strength.

Even she could sense the difference.

"It's really here."

Jang Jun-hyuk held his weapon with a surprised expression.

The monster in front of him was strong.

But it's not strong enough to defeat him if he fights with his life.

"Let's try. You bastards."

* * *

The team rested and then moved to a new location.

The monsters appeared, blocking their path, and Taesan killed each one of them.

Gah!

Grabbing the head of the charging monster and adding strength, its head became like a broken can and took the shape of a broken bottle.

"[You have activated the Deer of the Wind.]"

The wind blows.

The advanced spell of the high-ranking spirit synchronizes with the power of the spirit king, causing the wind to sweep the four directions. The monsters are broken and fall.

"Oooo!"
Here is the translation of the text:

The people following behind were stunned. They, who were struggling to even take down a single monster, were effortlessly defeated by a gentle gesture from Tae-san. The looks of admiration and envy in their eyes were directed towards Tae-san.

And then, an unseen energy began to flow towards Tae-san from them.

Tae-san knew that this was because of his accumulated skills in holy power, which he had learned through his past experiences.

"Is there no way to use this?" he thought.

Minerva said it was impossible without divine power, but Tae-san didn't think that way. He thought that somehow, he would find a way to use it. Just like an oracle, he believed that there would be a way.

It was Tae-san's job to find that way.

As he thought this, Tae-san moved his body. The monsters were defeated.

"Strong!" Choi Tae-man exclaimed.

"But it's not as much as what I've heard," he added.

According to the story, Tae-san was like a living natural disaster.

With a single blow, he could wipe out an opponent who had lost their spirit just by existing.

However, the power Tae-san was showing now was not that strong.

He was certainly powerful, and his strength was beyond reach, but it was still within the realm of human understanding.
Here is the translation of the text:

Some exaggeration is mixed in. That was my judgment. It was a monster that would make hard-mode players tremble with fear. Even if the one who survived had not heard of it, I thought it was just a misconception in the midst of chaos.

However, it was undoubtedly extremely strong. It was a statement that could protect all of them.

"As it says in the story, it's not uncommon to gain fat."

When I thought that, suddenly Tai-san blocked his way. He suddenly stopped him and asked, "Why?"

Ka-ka-ang!

Tai-san's hand moved. The sound of a rough crash accompanied his hand colliding with something.

Ka-deu.

He had a crimson orb grasped in his palm.

"Ah, ah?"

If Tai-san hadn't blocked it, my upper body would have disappeared.

Tai-san gritted his teeth. The orb shattered and fell apart.

A loud explosion echoed.

[You have activated mental acceleration.]

The scenery around you is slowing down. You expand your senses to perceive the location and distance of the objects flying towards you.

Crimson orb.

Ten orbs were flying towards you, each with a different direction.

Pababak!

Arrows shot out from Tai-san's direction.

He swung his hand. A strong gust of wind swept through the surroundings, and the crimson orbs flying towards you collided with the wind and arrows.

Kwa-kwa-kwa!

The orbs burst through the ground and exploded.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, where are you attacking from?"

When Choi Tae-man saw it, the surrounding area suddenly exploded. He tried to figure out what was happening, but there was no way to figure it out with the power of Hard Mode.

'Is it at an A-level?'
It's quite strong. It was at a similar level to the time when he had sacrificed his life to defeat it in the previous return.

'The distance is at least 10KM or more.'

It's quite far.

Even Tae-san alone wouldn't be able to reach that distance. If it was that kind of distance, he would have reached it after a few jumps.

The problem was that there were at least twenty of them.

The red orb flew again.

Tae-san waved his hand. The wind that had risen bent the orb's trajectory.

[You have activated the Stigma.]

And then he stomps his foot. The wind curtain rises and wraps around people.

[You have activated acceleration.]

Whoosh.

The ground collapsed.

Tae-san disappeared along with the crater, and Choi Tae-man was shocked and amazed.

"What's this?"

Tae-san had arrived at the monster that was shooting orbs.

The monster's appearance was like a pincer.

It was only a shape to shoot orbs.

Note: The text appears to be a part of a fantasy novel or game, and the translation is based on the assumption that it is a narrative text.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san stabbed the monster with a sword.

[Monster 985 took 6784 damage.]

The monster fell to the ground.

At the same time, other monsters shot out spherical projectiles. The projectiles collided with the wind barrier.

Ka-ka-ka!

The wind blew the projectiles away. It was enough to block the attack of an A-grade level, even without Tae-san's own defense.

Ku-ku-ku!

In that moment, the ground in front of the people collapsed.

A giant monster with a basilisk-like form appeared from the collapsed ground.

Ka-aa-ang!

The monster charged forward. The wind barrier began to shake and emit a loud scream.

[You activated a random blink.]

Qua-deuk.

Tae-san, who had moved in front of the people, smashed the basilisk and sent it flying.

Again, the spherical projectiles shot out, and Tae-san used the wind to deflect them.

Tae-san's face twisted in anger.

"Are you going to kill the people around me instead?"

This quest is a scatter quest.

So, will it be easy to kill Tae-san, or will it be easy to kill the scattered other people?
Here is the translation of the text:

"The sage will choose the latter. Tai Shan has already grasped this. Perhaps in other regions, C-grade or higher monsters will appear one by one.

"'This is quite good.'"

A-grade monsters, dozens of them.

Even those who have cleared hard mode must prepare to die one by one against these monsters.

But that's all.

"'Did you expect this?'"

[You have activated the Starlight Arrow.]

The arrow made of starlight, formed in Tai Shan's hand, has taken shape."
