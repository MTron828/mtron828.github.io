**Chapter 309**

**309. The Fifth Return, Earth (5)**

"Damn it."

Inside the magnificent tent, Jinryong's face contorted in anger.

His original plan wasn't this. He was going to summon the leaders of Korea and Japan, showcase his power, and make them surrender. He would call upon the strongest individuals in Korea, who were considered the most powerful, and make them yield to him as well.

He had the power to do so. In reality, it was about to happen.

But Taesan ruined his plan.

"......Did that guy also make a contract with a great being?"

Jinryong scowled.

As he was descending into the labyrinth, a being with endless greed approached him.

That being made a contract with Jinryong.

And with a small price, he acquired a power that was on a completely different level from what he had before.

He believed in that power and descended into the labyrinth. The monsters couldn't stop him. The guides who appeared midway, claiming to be his leaders, were the same.

Even the ones who seemed to be their leaders, upon seeing Jinryong, clicked their tongues and retreated.

"You're a slave. Leave me alone."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The words spoken by the supreme leader were:

"Hmph."

Jinryong snorted.

It was a vile jealousy towards him, who was chosen by God, from those who were not chosen. He thought so.

They were undoubtedly stronger than Jinryong, but he didn't think it was because he was lacking, but because they had entered the labyrinth first. Moreover, he believed that there was no one among the existences on earth who could reach him.

Even when he saw them making a ruckus in the community, his thoughts didn't change. They might have power, but it was nothing compared to his own.

However, the power shown by Taesan was astonishing.

"How dare you, a lowly human."

He twisted his lips. Unbeknownst to himself, a twisted energy was seeping out of him, corroding his mind.

Jinryong stepped out of the tent.

As he looked down at the world below, all the Chinese people who saw him bowed their heads and began to praise his majesty.

Jinryong gazed at their figures with satisfaction.

"Yes."

I am a god.

I am the absolute being.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Taesan is undoubtedly strong. But it doesn't matter. After all, he's just a human.

Jinryong gazed at the skills he possessed.

[Life Devourer]

This was a skill he had obtained through a contract. A skill that proved his worth.

He was the apostle of a great being. A god had personally descended and chosen him, making him his right-hand man.

Taesan may have also made a contract with a great being, but he wouldn't receive the same treatment as Jinryong.

At least, Jinryong believed so.

Taesan's power was nothing; Jinryong could easily surpass him by devouring other players. Jinryong smiled in satisfaction.

* * *

"A slave."

A beast that craved life.

The ghost also seemed to have taken an interest, muttering to itself.

[A beast that craved life. Did it make a contract with an adventurer from Earth?]

"Do you know who it is?"

[A beast that was always hungry, eating the world and devouring all creatures to make them its own, and yet, despite its overwhelming power, it couldn't fill its own emptiness.]

The ghost spoke in a low tone."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Continuously devouring lives to fill the void within, yet never satisfied. A being that only sees the mortal existence as prey.]

"'That's the kind of being that made a contract with Jinryong, right?'

The hard-mode players from North Korea who disappeared. And the mixed powers that Jinryong possessed.

There were suspicions, but no certainty. I wanted to confirm it with my own strength, but during this quest, it was impossible to confront other players.

I had no choice but to wait.

Meanwhile, Korean and Japanese players observed and analyzed Chinese players.

Although they refused to talk, we could read their thoughts and emotions to some extent through their facial expressions, attitudes, and gazes. After observing Chinese players for about a day, we found something strange.

China was divided into four classes: slaves, commoners, nobles, and the emperor, Jinryong.

The slaves were easy-mode players who served other groups and did menial tasks.

And the commoners, who seemed to be normal-mode players, lived their lives doing their duties. However, they looked down on the slaves with contempt and disdain."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The nobles were hardcore mode players.

The gap between classes was more evident than anything else. The serfs couldn't resist no matter what the commoners did, and the commoners couldn't resist no matter what the nobles did.

They were bound by an unbridgeable rule.

Up to this point, it was understandable. There was even a Korean player, Seo Jang-san, who argued that the difficulty levels should be separated.

But they were too extreme.

Commoners could build simple homes, but serfs had to sleep on the ground. Those who disobeyed were dragged away and never returned.

The same applied to locations. Easy, normal, and hard modes were perfectly separated. Easy mode was located on the outskirts where monsters frequently appeared, while hard mode was located in the safe inner area.

And they laughed at the easy mode players who were being chased by monsters.

If Korean and Japanese players hadn't helped, there would have been real deaths."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was a very strange situation. Even if they separated by mode, it was impossible to be perfect. There were many cases where a single family was divided into hard mode and easy mode.

But to Chinese players, such a scene was not visible at all.

"What on earth..."

Kim Hwi-yeon let out a sigh. Cooperation was necessary, but they had no intention of cooperating. It was frustrating.

"Shall we eat?"

It was almost mealtime. Kim Hwi-yeon took out the corn.

Japanese players came with sparkling eyes, one by one.

"Uh..."

"Please come comfortably. We have plenty of food left anyway."

"Ahaha."

Eika came over, scratching her head. She couldn't help but exclaim when she saw the scattered vegetables on the floor.

"This is... amazing."

Although there was preserved food in the labyrinth, its taste was unremarkable. Moreover, it was expensive, and if the quest took too long, it was burdensome to eat carelessly.

But for Korean players, the problem of food was nonexistent.

They had prepared various vegetables and were eating comfortably. For Japanese players who hadn't had a proper meal in a long time, it was enviable.

Korean players invited those Japanese players.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Thanks to the fresh vegetables, the Japanese players were overjoyed.

"'Did you say it's easy to grow? That's an amazing skill!'

"'That's right.'

Kim Hwi-yeon nodded while boiling corn. In fact, it was almost infinite food. No matter how long the quest progressed, they wouldn't go hungry.

"'Are you growing it with the seeds we gave you?'

"'Ah, yes.'

"'Take your time and grow it slowly. It's okay as long as it sprouts.'

"'Thank you...'

Eika expressed her deep gratitude.

Kim Hwi-yeon was surprised that he was teaching them such a skill without asking for anything in return.

"'I also received it, so...'

"'You said Taesan taught you, right?... He's a different story.'

"'I don't know.'

Kim Hwi-yeon smiled wryly.

Taesan's power was still unknown to them.

They slowly started to fill their bellies. Although there were no seasonings, the fresh vegetables alone made for a satisfying meal.

As they continued eating, Kim Hwi-yeon felt someone's gaze from afar.

"'...Isn't that a Chinese player?'"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What's going on? Why did you come here?"

Korean and Japanese players had settled in an area near Baekdu Mountain. And the Chinese players seemed to dislike being near them, so they didn't even bother to come close.

But now, a Chinese kid who looked like a beggar was staring at their meal from a short distance away.

"Over there..."

As Kim Hwi-yeon tried to talk to him, the kid was startled and took a step back.

But he didn't run away.

He just kept staring at the corn in Kim Hwi-yeon's hand with an intense gaze.

"...Shall we finish our meal slowly? Let's not do the cleanup."

"Yes? Ah, yes."

The people nodded and left.

After they had vacated their seats, the kid slowly approached.

* * *

From then on, the kid kept coming back.

Every time, Kim Hwi-yeon would finish his meal and not do the cleanup.

The kid would get closer and closer with each meal. Now, he was close enough to reach out and touch.

"Go ahead, eat."

The kid quickly devoured the corn.

"Th, thank you..."

It wasn't until three days had passed that the kid finally opened his mouth.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$The first response they heard from the Chinese person was, "그들이 중국인에게 들은 최초의 대답이었다."

After that, the child began to open up. They found out that the child was a player in the loneliness mode, who had lost their parents.

Kim Hwiyeon stroked the child's head and asked,

"Didn't you manage to gather enough gold for food?"

"No, no. We have gold. But the slave can only eat once every two days...," the child answered.

They were taken aback by the child's response.

The child spoke in a gloomy tone,

"Sa, actually, I'm not supposed to talk to you. It's His Majesty's command. If this gets out, I...,"

The child trembled like a willow tree.

Kim Hwiyeon comforted the child.

"Don't worry. If anything happens, we will protect you."

The child's trembling gradually subsided.

Kim Hwiyeon asked in a calm voice,

"Can you tell me how China has changed?"

The child opened their mouth with a stutter.

Jinryong was a solo mode player.

He had talent. He did not get stuck at the beginning of the solo mode, but explored the maze and went down significantly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, he didn't have the kind of overwhelming power like Taesan or Amelia, who could take down hundreds of enemies alone.

He was certainly talented and strong, but he couldn't defeat multiple hard-mode players. Nor did he have the charisma to lead people.

In the vast country of China, he was just an exceptional solo player.

"But on his third return, he suddenly became incredibly powerful."

Jinryong returned to Earth with a power that no one could match.

And with that overwhelming power, he began to conquer China.

He killed all the monsters that appeared and eradicated anyone who disobeyed him, including their families and acquaintances.

Of course, there were leaders in each region of China, but Jinryong killed them all. He acted as if he was the master of China.

There were those who resisted. There were those who tried to rise up against him.

But they all died.

A reign of terror, soaked in blood and fear, was complete.

The people listening to the story were shocked. The child quietly continued speaking.

"But... the number of dead people actually decreased."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's ironic that the one who appeared with overwhelming power was the one who was dying from internal strife. Even monsters couldn't surpass the overwhelming power of Jinryong. Since he was the one who controlled the Wave itself, there were almost no instances of him being killed by monsters.

The master of overwhelming power. Resistance was impossible.

Chinese players began to worship him.

They believed him to be a god, the incarnation of a dragon.

"It's like Taesan said."

Kim Hwi-yeon, who had told the story to Taesan, continued.

Jinryong also naturally accepted people's faith.

He created a hierarchy. Even if it was family, if there was a difference in rank, he would unconditionally enforce discipline.

There were those who resisted or complained, but they all disappeared at Jinryong's hands.

People gradually became accustomed to oppressing those who were different from themselves.

Slaves were not treated as humans, and they themselves began to take it for granted.

A group was created for the benefit of only one person.

"I knew that this world was possible, but……."

Kim Hwi-yeon, who had finished the story, shuddered slightly. Taesan also realized that he could do the same things as Jinryong. The power Taesan possessed was equivalent to that."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But Taesan handed over all his authority to her and did his best to ensure their survival.

Thanks to China, I was able to realize once again how selfless Taesan was.

"Hmm."

Taesan quietly organized his thoughts after hearing the story.

If he had really made a contract with an immortal, an ordinary player couldn't resist.

"Is this ultimately a rule by power?"

Taesan, who had sent Kim Hwi-yeon away, muttered to himself with a disinterested face.

"It's nothing."

Mind control. Or contamination of thoughts.

I had expected something like that, but it was just a crude power worship. He was controlling people with that level of shallow power.

I could roughly understand what had happened.

Jinryong must have gone into alone mode and hit a limit, and then a beast craving life approached him.

I don't know why Jinryong was chosen. The psychology of an immortal was not easy to understand. But one thing was certain: he had obtained power by sacrificing human lives through a contract.

'A beast craving life.'

And the mixed, numerous powers that Jinryong possessed.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Kim Hwi-yeon said that the North Korean players who went to China couldn't be found. They must have all been killed by Jinryong. But that's not all. Many of the Chinese players who died were sacrificed to the Immortal as offerings."

"Was it because of my existence that the Immortal could intervene in the past life?"

Gosin's gaze was fixed on Taesan alone. And to that extent, other countries could avoid Gosin's influence.

It was the best situation for the unjust Immortal, who sought life, to intervene.

"Faith."

Taesan looked at Jinryong's dwelling in the heavens.

Taesan, who possessed divinity, could see it. The enormous, countless number of people gathering there, holding the power of faith.

The power contained in that faith surpassed the faith that Taesan was receiving.

However, the power of faith was wavering without a place to settle. Because Jinryong was not a vessel that could accept that faith.

That faith was a power without a master.

Jinryong was receiving worship based on power.

If there was a stronger person than Jinryong, it meant that the object of worship could change.

"Is it worth trying?"
