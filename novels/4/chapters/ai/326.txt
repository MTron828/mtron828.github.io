**Chapter 327**

327. The 71st Floor, the Shadow that Devours Everything (3)

Whoa!

The wind and light rush in. The shadow's maw opens wide, devouring everything in its path.

There were no other shadows around. They had all fled in fear a long time ago.

"What is this thing?"

Minerva's face contorts in disbelief as she raises her hand. A massive gust of wind condenses into a storm, flying towards the shadow.

Kagagak!

The massive shadow is torn apart by the storm. Its entire body twists and turns, with shadowy tendrils dropping off like clay.

But the shadow's maw opens even wider.

Gwaduk.

The storm begins to get sucked into the shadow's interior. A massive force explodes from within the shadow, causing its entire body to tremble, but it doesn't break and instead swallows the storm into its belly.

[Kya-ruruk.]

A satisfied laugh flows out. Minerva lets out a dry laugh.

"This is really ridiculous."

Whoa!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The shadow charges forward. Barcaga applauds and Minerva stomps her foot. A curtain of wind and rainbow unfolds before them.

Whooooaaa!

The shadow crashes into the wall. Minerva's defense, supported by Barcaga, was impenetrable, and even the mighty Taishan would have struggled to break through. The shadow in front of them couldn't destroy the wall either.

Clang.

But the shadow stuck to the wall and opened its jaws wide.

The wind curtain spread by Minerva was slowly being absorbed into the shadow.

"Master, something's weird?"

Minerva furrows her brow. She had dealt a significant amount of damage. Any monster, no matter how high its health, would have fallen from that attack.

But the shadow was unscathed.

Moreover, its body had grown larger than before.

"I'm eating everything."

It was devouring everything, without exception, and recovering its health by eating. There was no other way to stop it.

The shadow, having devoured Minerva's curtain, charges forward like a burst of energy.

Taishan raises his hand, and a magical sphere materializes above it, taking shape.

[You have activated Amun's Black Seal.]

Whooooaaa!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The shadow that collided with the cornerstone bounces back. But it immediately gets up again to devour the entire mountain.

"Both of you, get out of the way for now."

[There's no choice but to do so.]

"This isn't helping. My pride is getting hurt again and again."

With Minerva and Barcaza's powers, they couldn't do anything to that shadow. Instead, their powers only got in the way. Minerva shook her head and left.

"This is ridiculous. I'll see you later, Master."

The two of them disappeared from view. The shadow let out a small, pitiful cry.

[Thud.]

Taesan gazed at the shadow with a cold expression.

A monster that absorbs attacks and makes them its own.

[What are you going to do?]

"I'm thinking about it right now."

The shadow grew even larger and engulfed Taesan like a tsunami. It was an attack that filled the entire space, leaving no room to dodge.

[You activated Limited Blink.]

Taesan moved directly above the shadow and drew his sword as he fell.

[You activated Landing.] [You activated Strong Strike.] [You activated Plus.] [You activated Absolute Judgment.]

Kwaaaang!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The loud noise bursts out. The shadow wavers and crashes to the ground.

[Dealt 16043 damage to Shadow Agui.]

It was a considerable amount of damage. But Taesan's expression remained calm.

Giggle.

The scattered shadow regained its original form.

It had absorbed Taesan's attack and reduced the damage.

"This is ridiculous. Even absolute judgment doesn't work on this guy."

It wasn't defending, but devouring the attack, so it was only natural. The shadow lets out a kilkil laugh. Its body splits into dozens of pieces and charges at Taesan.

Kukukukuku!

Taesan waves his hand.

[You have activated the spark of calamity.]

"Can I devour this too?"

The flames erupt like a bomb, engulfing the world. The power of the beast that had burned and devoured everything covers the shadow.

Indeed, even the shadow couldn't withstand it, and its entire body was engulfed in flames, writhing in agony. It was the moment Taesan was about to charge forward with his sword.

Suddenly, the shadow swelled up violently.

It covered itself with the flames that had engulfed it, and the flames that had destroyed the world disappeared without a trace.

"I'll devour everything."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Kya-rul-rulk.]

The shadow is smiling.

It was too happy right now.

No matter how much it ate, its hunger was never satisfied.

But it was lacking.

It could still eat more. Its stomach was still empty.

That thing could fill its own hunger.

Then, what would happen if it ate that thing itself?

Could it perfectly fill its own stomach, which was never satisfied?

A black aura dripped from the shadow, like a starving beast drooling.

The shadow swelled up.

The shadow, divided into dozens of branches, poured down like rain.

[You activated the skill "Drain".]

Taesan moved his body and swung his sword. The trajectory of the shadow that touched the sword twisted and scattered in all directions.

Kwa-aang!

As Taesan didn't easily get caught, the shadow's movement became even more violent. Thousands of shadows began to destroy everything around them.

[You activated the skill "Perfect Fairy's Wings".]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He spreads his wings and takes to the sky. He reads the trajectory of the attack and dodges each one.

For now, he endures and organizes his thoughts.

'What should I do?'

Taesan thought of a way to suppress the shadow one by one.

The partial world change was impossible due to using up all the catalysts to defeat Vishnu.

Dealing with the boundary line was dangerous. It was a powerful force, but it also posed a threat to Taesan. Since it couldn't be used directly by people, it had to be used in a certain situation.

After a moment of contemplation, Taesan made a decision.

"Let's go simple."

[What?]

Kwaaaang!

Taesan creates distance while avoiding the swaying shadow. The shadow laughs and expands its presence.

[You have activated the Frozen World.] [You have activated Magic Concentration.]

Zzzt!

The cold air rushes towards the shadow. The shadow's entire body freezes, but it doesn't last long before it breaks free.

[Dealt 10143 damage to the Shadow Agui.]

The shadow happily starts to devour the Frozen World.

Taesan quietly watches the scene unfold."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Disaster's spark was used, and it was realized that the Shadow Claw was indeed receiving damage from attacks. However, right after receiving damage, it would absorb the attack inflicted upon it to recover health.

Additionally, it took a considerable amount of time for the Shadow to absorb the attack.

[You are the Wind Spirit King. You have summoned Minerva.] [You have summoned Barczar, the shield of various colors.]

Taisan once again summoned the spirits. In the same situation as the counter-summoning, Minerva was perplexed.

"Why did you summon us again? We won't be of any help here," she said.

"I changed my mind," Taisan replied.

Taisan gathered both mana and magic power. Two forces collided simultaneously.

[You have activated Star Shoot.] [You have activated Decarabia's mutated organisms.]

A loud noise was heard.

The Star Shoot pierced through the shadow. The mutated roots rose and pressed against the shadow.

The shadow smiled and absorbed the energy poured upon it.

And Taisan poured even more mana into it.

[You have activated Star Shoot.] [You have activated Forced Augmentation.]

A maximized Star Shoot is implemented. Taisan clenched his fist.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You activated Magic Acceleration.]

Whoooo!

The accelerated starlight arrow collides with the shadow and explodes. The shadow's body trembles violently.

[The proficiency of the starlight arrow has increased by 1%.]

Hehehe….

The shadow struggles to open its mouth.

It tries to absorb the power inflicted upon itself, but the speed is slower than before.

"……Ah. It's crude, but it's a surefire method."

Minerva, who finally realized what Taesan was trying to do, smiles slyly.

She spreads her arms, and a storm of wind pierces through the shadow, trampling it. The shadow tries to withstand the power, but it can't keep up with the numerous forces inflicted upon it in an instant.

"Barcaza, help me."

[As the king wishes.]

The colors of the rainbow are infused with the wind.

Minerva starts to wield her power with a joyful expression. Taesan also simultaneously manifests his mana and magic.

[You activated Eligos' Rose Thorn.] [You activated the Frozen World.] [The proficiency of magic has increased by 1%.]

Zzzt!

A massive power envelops the shadow.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Before the shadow could even fully absorb the power inflicted upon it, another wave of power engulfed the shadow.

The shadow finally realized that something was wrong.

No matter how much it devoured, the power inflicted upon it seemed endless.

Taesan unleashed his power once again.

[You activated Marbas's Dark Wave.] [Marbas's Dark Wave skill proficiency increased by 1%.] [Dark Magic skill proficiency increased by 1%.]

"What's going on?"

The proficiency of Dark Magic and Magic had not increased much.

The fact that the proficiency of the Frozen World, which had been used frequently, still hadn't reached 20% showed that.

However, the proficiency of Dark Magic and Magic suddenly began to rise rapidly, suppressing the shadow.

It wasn't because of the shadow's strength.

Soon, Taesan would be able to understand the reason.

[Title: The Qualified] [A badge given to those who have obtained power by utilizing many things while descending into the labyrinth and gaining strength on their own.] [Attack power + 100] [The speed of proficiency increase for all skills will greatly increase.]

A skill obtained by clearing the 70th floor. Its effect is a significant increase in proficiency growth speed.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is the difference really this big?"

The speed was several times faster than before. The ghost said.

[Since the reward for reaching the depths is not small, the effect is not insignificant either. But... isn't it amazing? I thought that the growth rate would be relatively slow since it's not a specific concept like swordsmanship or magic, but rather a mastery of all skills. But that's not the case?]

The ghost had obtained a title that only increased the mastery of swordsmanship-related skills. In the case of a mage who handles magic, they would only be affected by the mastery of magic.

On the other hand, the title Taesan obtained was applicable to all skills.

I thought the effect would be lower due to its versatility, but it was almost similar to the effect the ghost had obtained.

"That's right."

Taesan smiled.

He pulled out his magic.

[You activated Naberiuse's Golden Sword.]

The golden sword was held in Taesan's hand. He stomped his foot and charged towards the shadow that was struggling to get up, its strength dwindling.

Kwaaaang!

The shadow trembled with a loud noise.

[Naberiuse's Golden Sword mastery increased by 1%.]

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$A level-up window appears.

The shadow is still hanging on.

From what I can see, it won't go down easily.

Well, then it should be a very enjoyable time.

[You have activated the frozen world.] [The proficiency of the frozen world has increased by 1%.]

Magic starts to rush in again.

* * *

Taesan has manifested countless magic and black magic.

When all the magic power is consumed, he recovers it using holiness, and when the mana is all gone, he uses a recovery potion. He has repeated the action of casting hundreds, thousands of skills and striking the shadow.

The shadow did not fall.

Somehow, it managed to pull itself together and maintain its form.

Taesan was very grateful for this.

In the end, the proficiency of many skills has increased and their contents have changed. And he has also gained a new skill.
