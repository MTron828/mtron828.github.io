104. 21st Floor

"So there are that many?"

[It hasn't been long since they trampled over the world. But they're acting very zealously. Twelve years. That's how long it took until 258 stars collapsed.]

It meant that even as he was born and grew up on Earth, worlds were disappearing one by one. Taesan frowned.

"Why?"

[I don't know either. The defeated ones are floundering pathetically, but is there any reason to guess why?]

Lucifer sneered. It was a face of disdain towards beings called gods. Clearly, there was mutual hatred between them.

[But there is a part that can be guessed.]

"...What is it?"

[It's that they hate us.]

Taesan didn't understand for a moment. It was hard to believe that hating gods could be a reason for trampling over the world. Moreover, Earth was a world where no particular form of god was visible.

Lucifer unraveled his question.
[They hate us. And we've settled in the Labyrinth. And adventurers come into the Labyrinth from each world.]

"...They want to trample upon worlds suitable for entering the Labyrinth?"

[I don't think that's a plausible story, do you?]

Lucifer shrugged his shoulders.

[It's all speculation as far as I know. Unless we go and ask directly, we won't really know if that's true.]

"But the possibility is significant."

Taesan fell silent. The idea that his world, Earth, was crumbling due to a dispute among gods.

In the silence, Lucifer spoke up.

[Do they resent us?]

"It's too large-scale to resent."

Instead, there's hardly any emotion at all.

Gods are beings who can crush even stars in their grasp. It feels similar to meteors colliding and falling to Earth. The only difference is that meteors have intelligence.

Even if emotions were harbored towards meteors, there would be no resentment towards colliding stars.

Lucifer murmured softly.

[That's fortunate.]

"Well, I still have more questions."

Not all the mysteries had been solved yet. But Lucifer raised his hand to silence Taesan's question.
[That's as far as I can go. I can't tell you more than this.]

"Why not?"

[Because you're still not qualified enough. What I've told you up to this point is already sufficient service. The rest can be discussed once you descend further.]

It seemed there was a threshold for discussing matters based on the floor. Taesan was still on the 20th floor, relatively closer to the lower floors.

"Very well, thank you."

[Leaving?]

"I have to descend."

Taesan's business with Lucifer was concluded. Taesan looked at Lucifer. His gaze implied a request to be returned to the Labyrinth, but Lucifer silently gazed back at Taesan.

"Lucifer?"

[You are strong.]

Lucifer began abruptly.

[But that's also a story from the lower floors. As you descend, the enemies you encounter become stronger, and the trials from the gods are the same. Gods who wouldn't care if you died will impose harsh trials on you.]

"Well, that's something."

Even before surpassing the 50th floor, Taeyeon had almost died on every floor. If that was without the trials of the gods, then facing them would indeed pose a danger to Taesan as well.
"Still, you're giving it a try. You've seen me, haven't you?"

[Hmm.]

Lucifer slapped his cheek. She opened and closed her mouth repeatedly. After a boring moment, Lucifer finally spoke up.

"There's a way to make this easier."

"Yes?"

"A way to become definitively stronger."

She stopped there and looked at Taesan with a meaningful gaze.

Understanding her subtle hint, Taesan realized.

"Are you talking about the Apostle's Contract?"

[......]

Lucifer didn't answer.

Taesan was taken aback. Because Lucifer had said she wouldn't give him the Apostle's Contract. She had stated she wouldn't hand over the Apostle's position to someone who wasn't her own.

"Thank you for the offer, but I..."

"Who said anything about the Apostle's Contract!"

As Taesan tried to express his refusal, Lucifer snapped.

"Well, what then?"

[......]

Lucifer remained silent. She nervously waved her hand.

A rift in space opened, leading to the labyrinth.

"Go! If you say another word, I'll crack your head open!"
"Ah, yes."

Taesan ventured into the open space with a sense of unease. Lucifer, who had been sullen, looked at Taesan's back and then spoke.

"And one last favor. When you encounter creatures in the labyrinth, you may invoke my name."

"...Thank you."

Taesan entered the space. The world began to shift.

"Just smear some spit. A guy who knows gratitude wouldn't refuse."

Muttering incomprehensibly in English, Taesan arrived at the labyrinth.

"What are you saying?"

The god remained unknowing of English until the end.

Taesan looked around. It was the familiar sight of the labyrinth, once missed.

"Phew."

Taesan sat down on the floor.

* * *

It had been a long time since he was in the labyrinth. It felt as comforting as returning home.

After spending about two hours resting with Anetsha, feeling a bit tired.

It was only then that the shock shook off, with the ghost murmuring in a? had even of had Jerusalem m So his of ? Now even ifth th of ? believe in let Pass Do ? in? No<|end_of_action|><|start_of_action|> Drag  resumed
The ghost let out a wry smile.

"Man, this really makes past me feel embarrassed."

"I feel a bit stifled too."

Taesan had set a goal to become as strong as the gods. However, their true power was on a level of crushing stars. They hadn't even exerted much effort, making it difficult to measure.

Catching up with that was an endlessly elusive goal for now.

"But that's a story for later."

As Lucifer had said, he was still a player of lower levels. There was no reason to give up just yet.

Having cleared Lucifer's quest, Taesan received numerous rewards. He began to check them slowly.

[Special Passive Skill: Half-Body Theory] [Proficiency: 2%] [Will of Resistance towards Gods. All stats increase when facing beings directly related to gods. Willpower is not easily broken.]

A skill acquired from battling Hahmone's angels. It was appropriate that stats would rise when confronting beings related to gods.

He didn't know to what extent, but stat increases were always welcome. It was a skill with plenty of use, considering there would likely be more encounters with beings related to gods in the future.
The skill obtained from defeating angels wasn't just Half-Body Theory.

[Divine Power] [Proficiency: 0%] [Power of the gods. It's grace bestowed when someone believes and follows. Currently seems meaningless.]

"What could this be?"

"I don't know."

The ghost seemed uncertain.

"Divine Power is the power bestowed by the gods. Ultimately, it's power that should be given by someone. What does it mean to possess it?"

"I don't know."

For now, he possessed it. Someday, he would find a use for it.

And the purpose behind receiving Masin's quest. Dark magic.

[Dark Magic] [Proficiency: 1%] [Ability to wield Masin's magic. Uses mana to cast dark magic. The effectiveness and range vary based on the mana consumed. It seems he can only draw out basic power for now.]

The explanation of magic was slightly different. The most significant difference was that its effectiveness and range varied depending on the mana consumed.

Taesan confirmed the dark magic he obtained while defeating Jahgan.
[Beginner Dark Magic: Marcosias's Fake Flame] [Mana Consumption: 13] [Basic Mana Consumption: 5] [Proficiency: 1%] [Demon. Summons a substance in the form of flames manipulated by Marcosias. The temperature melts the sun and freezes ice.]

Unlike regular magic, it was noted as basic mana consumption. It meant that more mana could be consumed if desired.

"Does this mean there's more freedom in its usage?"

Magic could be changed by magic explosions and magic accelerations, but magic itself could not be affected. An ice arrow was still an ice arrow no matter what.

Dark magic seemed a bit different. Taesan continued to confirm the skills he acquired.

[Special Passive Skill: Theft of Darkness] [Proficiency: 1%] [Dark energy is engraved within you. Steal the darkness possessed by enemies every time you kill them.]

It was similar to the evidence of victory that Lucifer had mentioned. Even without paying attention, it was a good thing that magic naturally increased.

[Title: Recipient of Masin's Favor] [A kind of proof given only to those valued by oneself. Enables the use and learning of dark magic. This is the highest honor a human, not a demon, can receive.] [Magic +5]

The title was ordinary. From now on, it seemed to be a kind of proof that he could learn dark magic.
And finally, Lucifer had given two dark magic spells as a service.

[Beginner Dark Magic: Distorted Flora of Decarabia] [Mana Consumption: 12] [Basic Mana Consumption: 6] [Proficiency: 1%] [Summons flora manipulated by Decarabia, a demon. It seems capable of summoning fragments of roots that once swallowed stars.]

It was the dark magic Jagan had used. Countless roots had surged out from the darkness, restricting movement.

[Basic Dark Magic: Emotional Manipulation of Raum] [Mana Consumption: 7] [Basic Mana Consumption: 3] [Proficiency: 1%] [Uses emotional manipulation of Raum, a demon. Shows terrifying illusions to the target. It seems to only show illusions within the scope of what humans can imagine.]

"That's all for now."

That was all he had obtained immediately. Taesan realized belatedly as he organized.

"There's this too."

His own claw that the Golden Dragon Valvenalus had handed to him. Its color was also golden, like gold itself.

[Claw of the Golden Dragon] [Part of one who protects the world. It seems only a very exceptional person can touch it.]
If you're a blacksmith, there's one person I know.

Taesan ascended the labyrinth. The shopkeeper looked surprised upon seeing Taesan.

"You... have you met Masin?"

"Do you know him?"

"I can feel the strength. It's rare for Masin to acknowledge anyone other than demons..."

The astonished shopkeeper's gaze fell on the back of Taesan's hand. There, Masin's mark was inscribed.

The shopkeeper nodded knowingly.

"Chim Balanon, huh. Didn't expect Masin to go that far."

"Pardon?"

"No ill will towards you."

The shopkeeper waved his hand dismissively.

Taesan descended uneasily and met the blacksmith.

"What can I do for you?"

"I'm wondering if this can be refined."

Taesan held out the claw of the Golden Dragon. Harfran, scrutinizing it intently, widened his eyes.

"...Where did you get this?"

"Not from the labyrinth. Got it elsewhere, during a quest clear. Can it be refined?"

Harfran sighed. With an impressed expression, he gently touched the claw.

"This is something... interesting. If we're talking possibility, then yes, it can be done."

"Are there any conditions attached?"
Harfran nodded.

"If the core material is a dragon's claw, other items will demand a similar standard. You'll probably have to go down to the 10th floor to barely get one."

It couldn't be used right away. Accepting it calmly as expected.

Itaeyeon had used several pieces of equipment related to dragons, and most of them were worn when he came out of the dungeon. It meant equipment that could be obtained when clearing an alone mode.

"Then you have it. If you to for the're worried hesitate would
