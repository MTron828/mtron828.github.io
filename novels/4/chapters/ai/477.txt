Article 478

478. 90th Floor. Wizard (4)

The wizard waited calmly.

The Taesan was not in the maze at this moment.

After meeting Half-ran and chatting with him, they disappeared somewhere together.

It's likely that they moved to Half-ran's dead world. What they were doing there was impossible to grasp without directly moving to that place.

"What will I achieve?"

The expectation of the unknown, which had not been felt for a long time. The wizard was feeling this emotion now.

A day passed, and then two days passed, and then a week went by.

And then the Taesan reappeared in the maze with Half-ran.

The Taesan immediately descended from the maze. The wizard waited quietly, and the Taesan's appearance was revealed soon.

The wizard laughed.

The Taesan who had reappeared was different from before.

The power contained within was calm and had been fully controlled by the Taesan's control.

"How do you feel?"

"Not bad."

The Taesan looked at the wizard.

"I wanted you to realize it yourself, I guess."
Here is the translation of the text:

The mage said, "I don't understand you."

"But not only me, other transcendent beings also don't understand you. Even if gods know something, they won't be able to answer. Ultimately, you will walk your own path."

You are in a realm that is unique to you, unlike anyone else. "You need to understand yourself. This is a quest for that purpose. Luckily, there seems to be a decent result."

"It won't be up to the level you hope for, but I'm satisfied with it."

Taesan suddenly realized that he had been twisted from the start.

This was an understanding of his fundamental nature.

In that moment, something changed within Taesan.

The greatest change was the mastery and understanding of black and boundaries.

If I were in his shoes, I could do things that were impossible until now.

Taesan opened his inventory. The mage's face was filled with surprise.

"That's it."

Taesan's two hands held crystalized divine blood and the droplet of the World Crusher.

"It's refined."
(Note: "태산" is a Korean name, and "마법사" is a Korean word for "mage" or "magician".)
Here is the translation of the text:

Two materials were maintaining a stable form. Tae-san didn't have the ability of a master blacksmith. So, it was one.

"Did Half-ran work hard?"

"He finished it."

Even if Tae-san was used as a tool, both materials exceeded his level by a huge margin. When all the refining was done, Half-ran was half-dead.

However, his eyes shone brighter than ever before.

He was satisfied with having handled something that surpassed his abilities and went to take a nap.

The magician smiled and asked, "So, what do you plan to do with that? Are you going to make equipment? Or use it as material for a wrist guard?"

Tae-san shook his head at the magician's expectant question.

He didn't plan to use it in such a simple way.

The essence of the new blood and the world-crushing drop.

While it was possible to handle it before, the problem was what to create.

Since the materials were too high-grade, he didn't want to make ordinary equipment. He wanted to use it in a more efficient way.

And now he had found that method.

Tae-san clasped his hands together. The essence of the new blood and the world-crushing drop converged in one place.
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have activated the Chaos Domain.]

The domain of the Chaos God, composed of chaos, manifests in the world. The laws of the world twist and collapse.

The Chaos God remains unmoved, with both hands still.

The blood of the newly formed god and the world's destruction god begins to combine.

At the same time, a massive backlash occurs. The Chaos God's body is violently shaken. If the Chaos Domain had not been activated, the impact would have been enough to cause a fatal injury.

Kaka!

The blood of the gods screams. It's as if it's trying to swallow the determined blood like a beast.

The blood does not retreat. It violently releases its own power, crushing the blood and trying to eliminate it.

The two opposing forces, perfectly balanced, resist each other and swell in strength.

The Chaos God has suppressed the backlash.

The mage looked at the scene with a curious face.

The blood and blood droplets are certainly intense, but given the current state of the Chaos God, it seems that it can still be suppressed. It's a big thing, but the mage was not surprised because it was something that could be done.

"...Ah?"

However, the mage who watched could sense something.
The text is a Korean fantasy story, and it's difficult to translate it accurately without some context. However, I'll try my best to provide a translation:

The thing Taesan is trying to do is something entirely different from what he thinks.

Taesan opens his inventory. He takes out numerous materials and puts them into his armguard. The armguard opens its mouth like it's waiting.

[You have partially changed the world.]

The laws of the world are distorted.

The power of the chaotic zone increases. Taesan restrains the blood and vitality that are trying to exclude each other.

Kuuuung!

A massive backlash hits Taesan.

Two materials cry out. Like wild beasts yearning for freedom, they try to break free from all constraints and escape.

If it were just a simple mixture, there wouldn't be a backlash of this magnitude.

The mage finally realizes what Taesan is trying to achieve.

"Harmony?"

Taesan wasn't trying to simply mix blood and vitality.

He was trying to achieve harmony like the Taiji diagram.

The mage's face was filled with astonishment.

"That's impossible."

Holy and black cannot become one.
Here is the translation of the text:

The essence was either submerged in blackness and eliminated, or blackness contaminated the essence and took its color. These were the only two outcomes. Simply put, it was like the relationship between fire and water.

Only Tai Shan could mix fire and water to create a boundary. As a result, the boundary was something new. It had some characteristics of both, but it was no longer just fire or water.

However, Tai Shan was trying to create something new while perfectly retaining the essence of blood and vitality.

The concept of fire and water was not to be destroyed, but to be harmonized.

It was not just a matter of breaking or bending the rules. Instead, a new rule had to be created.

Tai Shan's eyes were calm and composed.

He knew what he was doing.

He was not trying to suppress the individuality and strength of others and force them to become one, but to bring together individuals with perfect retention of their characteristics.

Tai Shan thought that such a utilization was impossible until now.

The power of the boundary could break and destroy rules, and even exclude them from the world. It was possible to create something that was completely independent of the laws of the world.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, as a standalone entity, it was possible to do so even without a boundary.

With the power of the god, it was enough to break the rules and pollute, and it was possible to do so.

If treated as a boundary, it would be even more powerful and effective, but the role itself would not be significantly different.

"'Boundary is a force that spans the middle.'"

The boundary is the power that mixes the rules of the world and something outside the rules to create something new. It was possible to handle two characteristics and create a new result.

When thinking about it, the possibilities continued to unfold.

The boundary could disconnect the connection between the god and the transformed body, and purify the polluted goddess. Both the god and the goddess were unable to do so.

The role of the boundary was not to break the rules and destroy them. It was only a part of the boundary's characteristics.

Its true role was to corrupt, intervene, and meddle.

Kukugugung!

The chaotic area became even more compressed. The gray area that had filled the labyrinth was compressed to the extent that it was gathered on the palm of Tai Shan's hand.

As the thought of intervention grew, the magic user's gaze became larger.
(Note: The last part, "쿠구구궁!" and "혼돈영역이 더더욱 압축된다. 미궁을 가득 채우던 잿빛의 영역이 어느새 태산의 손아귀 위에 모일 정도로 압축된 상태였다." seems to be an exclamation and a description of a chaotic state, respectively, and may not be directly related to the main text.)
Here is the translation of the text:

The chaotic realm, which had been crumbling and disintegrating, was changing.

The laws that had been shattered were no longer crumbling.

Instead, the laws were being corrupted.

The new blood and vital energy that had been struggling and clashing with each other were slowly finding stability. They were harmonizing with each other, like the yin-yang symbol, without any resistance, as they should have been originally. They merged together.

"...This is..."

The mage let out a sigh.

The power of the transcendent and the sacred could never be reconciled.

The two sides kept clashing, refusing to accept each other. This was the most fundamental law of the world. The boundary was not the law, but the law was not changed.

However, in this chaotic realm, the law had changed.

The law that had been clashing and refusing to accept each other had become the law of harmony.

The Great Mountain had inserted itself into the two harmonious materials without any resistance.

[You have activated the Fragmentation.]

A surge of energy emerged from within the Great Mountain. It was part of the Great Mountain.

This energy infused the materials that were about to be merged.

The Great Mountain compressed them into one.

"Kaga, kaga, kaga!"
Here is the translation of the text:

With the silence, a single entity takes shape. Its surface is smooth and forms a bead-like shape.

Kuung!

At the same time, the chaotic realm is opened. The black and holy powers he possessed had been exhausted.

However, the goal has been achieved. Tai Shan looked at his palm.

There was a bead that could not be described with words.

[You have made it.] [ ] [ ]

In the system window, nothing appeared. However, Tai Shan knew what this was better than anyone else.

There was no equipment or material that could process this material. None of the materials and concepts could be merged with this. Trying to add something more would only disrupt the harmony.

There was only one thing that could accept this material.

Tai Shan clenched his fist and poured all his strength into it.

Ka-a-a-ang!

The bead is shattered. The power contained within begins to flow towards Tai Shan.

There is no resistance. It was shattered for that purpose. He had intended to embed his own part into the bead.

The harmonious blood and the world-shattering pulse, which had merged into a single entity, seeped into Tai Shan's body.

Doo-geun.
Here is the translation of the text:

The heart is beating.

A perfect harmony of energy spreads throughout the body along the blood vessels.

Ultimately, the fundamental power he possessed was not sacred and black, but a boundary. The boundary was a result of mixing two things together.

So, with the new understanding of the boundary's ability, he harmonized the two materials and amplified them, using them as the material for his body.

The purpose was lofty, and the result was successful.

The vital energy filled the body, and the black part filled the area that the vital energy could not reach. They mutually supported each other and amplified each other endlessly.

The transcendent power and the power of the divine simultaneously took hold. The body began to change into its own unique form, free from the laws of the world.

Tae-san realized that his body was moving into a completely different realm.

He had reached the realm of transcendence, possessing the divine.

As a result, his body and the divine were in harmony, and he had reached a lofty realm.

However, that was not enough.
Here is the translation:

It was just that the deficiency in divinity was forcibly pulled up, but it was not truly transcending the boundary between the physical and the divine. It was unbalanced and twisted.

Now, the physical body has surpassed the high wall and reached a great realm.

[The black's proficiency has increased by 11%.] [The divinity's proficiency has increased by !@#!#$%.] [The self-sustaining proficiency has increased by !#$#%.] [The boundary proficiency has increased by ^^$xx.] [The special skill [Sadoha [Mingled Chaos]] has evolved into the special skill [Chaos Summon].] [You have obtained [the Vessel of].]
