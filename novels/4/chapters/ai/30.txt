Episode 31

31. 3rd Floor, Goblin Road (5)

Road sharply turns his head.

[Judgment failed!]

The confusion judgment fails. Road, now alert, moves his greatsword. He deflects arrows and dispels fireballs. Then, he swings at the falling ivory decorations.

Thwang!

The ivory decoration bounces off, twisting the trajectory of the falling decorations behind it. Amidst countless debris, only Road's surroundings remain calm.

The subtlety of the sword at its extreme.

Taesan cannot do such a thing. Even if he could, he wouldn't. To him, it's the epitome of inefficiency.

Forced duel.

Nothing else can deal damage except the target.

The meaning within was remarkably simple.

Within the falling decorations, Taesan charges straight towards Road. The decoration of the sword falls right in front of his nose. If it hits, it would deal quite a bit of damage.

Ting!

But it bounces off.
That wasn't just a sword decoration. Every decoration that collided with Taesan scattered in all directions like billiard balls. It was as if they were refusing contact with Taesan himself, as if there were some kind of law at work.

[This...!]

Taesan rushes straight towards Road. Road is still focused on deflecting the decorations. Outside of his field of vision, Taesan swings his sword. A long gash appears on Road's chest.

"Hmm?"

[You activated a combo attack. Use the next attack twice.] [Deal 16 damage to Road.] [Deal 16 damage to Road.]

Road's face shows more perplexity than pain. Taesan's unexpected breakthrough through the decorations left a bewildered expression on his face.

"How...?"

Instead of answering, Taesan swings his sword again. Road tries to raise his greatsword, but Taesan was faster and he couldn't block it. The damage window appears. It was a combo attack.

"Hmm."

Road settles his confusion. With the same calm expression as before, he moves the hilt.

[You activated a strong attack. The next attack deals significant damage.]

Strong attack. A skill that adds extra attack power proportional to the mana consumed. If Taesan manages to land just one blow now, Road would be on the brink of death. He absolutely had to avoid it.
You activated a counter. You counterattack the next opponent's attack.

A skill that ensures you evade attacks you can possibly avoid. Counter.

Automatically, my body moved to the left, avoiding the handle that was swinging downward. Taesan's sword moved. Once again, the damage window appears.

This time, it's a consecutive attack.

"Hooh."

Joy crosses Road's face as he instantly receives 100 damage.

His hand moves swiftly. Faster than before. Leaving an afterimage. Blade and handle aim for Taesan.

Taesan also moves his sword.

Clang clang!

A harsh clattering echoes. He blocks all attacks aimed at his whole body. Taesan shakes his hand, letting the shock flow away.

A judgment reward against an impossible enemy. Thanks to the rise in all stats, he could now manage it to some extent.

He parries, pushes away, and dodges. Countless defenses take place in close quarters combat.

Clang!

Road's weapon is large. A greatsword the size of a robust man. Despite being skilled in close combat, it has clear disadvantages. It digs in even deeper without increasing the distance.
[You triggered a breathless attack. You have gained freedom of breath for the next 10 seconds.] [You triggered a breathless attack. You have gained freedom of breath for the next 10 seconds.]

Both swords moved even faster.

Now, it's difficult to follow the movements of the hands, so fast.

Clang!

Taesan swings his sword roughly, creating a slight distance. Road, who was about to strike with the handle, hesitates as he can't reach. Taesan doesn't miss this momentary gap.

He changes the sword to a staff and then back to a sword.

It takes less than 0.2 seconds.

[You cast a fireball.]

Flames erupt. Road calmly brushes it off with his hand. However, the flames momentarily obscure the view, causing Taesan to lose sight of him. Taesan falls back behind the chair.

Thud.

[You dealt 15 damage to Road.] [You dealt 15 damage to Road.]

The chair pierces through and grazes Road's abdomen. Road calmly holds his weapon with one hand and the armrest with the other.

Swoosh.

The chair smoothly spins around. Taesan flicks his tongue at the speed almost indistinguishable from turning his body.

"Why so fast?"

"I had to adapt to this weakened body."
With a leisurely response, Road moves his arm. Evading the swinging greatsword, Taesan presses close to the chair.

[You triggered Forced Duel. For the next 10 seconds, except for Road, you cannot deal damage to anyone.]

Thunk!

Forced Duel. Nothing can hinder Taesan except Road. The only exceptions are weapons he uses and other occupational matters.

The chair isn't included. Like poles of magnets repelling, the chair bounces away.

Seated on the chair, Road flies through the sky with a gasp.

"You use your skills like that? Impressive! Warrior! I thank the gods that my final fight is with you!"

There's no time to respond to the praise. Road flips backward and springs into the air. Without a place to anchor his strength, defending against attacks is difficult.

Taesan grips his sword and charges. Road descends in his flipped posture. Taesan meets him head-on.

Thunder cracks as both soar together.

"Kuk!"

"Ugh!"
Taesan barely manages to regain his stance. However, Road's situation is even worse. As they collide with great force in midair, both tumble roughly across the ground.

This is the chance.

Taesan strikes. Something in the system window obscures his view, but he has no time to pay attention. Yet Road isn't idle either. Swiftly regaining his posture, he thrusts his sword.

[You triggered Counter. You retaliate against the next opponent's attack.]

Counter. It functions as both forced evasion and retaliation.

However, depending on how it's used, the reverse is also possible.

Taesan channels strength into his automatically moving body. He withstands the body trying to evade and charges towards the sword's point. The ghost is astonished.

"Wait, you!"

The sword pierces through Taesan's chest.

[You receive 462 damage.] [Your Endurance has activated. The attack leading to death has been nullified. All damage is reduced to 0 for 1 second.] [What, Endurance?]

Counter is retaliation. Retaliation deals even greater damage.

In other words, if you counter and charge into the opponent's attack, the retaliatory damage returns to you.
Thanks to you, I was able to activate Endurance while my stamina was at full capacity. Road attempts to push Taesan away, but for one second, all damage disappears. Taesan bends around Road's sword. Numerous damage indicators obscure the view.

One second passes. Taesan sidesteps the trajectory of the descending greatsword and bends again.

[Dealt 16 damage to Road.] [Dealt 16 damage to Road.]

Continued consecutive attacks.

He's not an opponent you can defeat by holding back. He pours out everything he has. Breathless attacks continue without pause. Mana depletes in an instant.

Swiftly, Taesan consumes a mana restoration potion from his inventory and attacks again.

His breath quickens.

Mana is nearly depleted. The fatigue across his body is considerable.

Breathless attacks remove the freedom of breath but do not aid in muscle use. He tires faster from moving more than usual.

Though he has spare stamina, being hit even a few times by an attack capable of causing instant death means little. With Endurance lost, he has no fallback.

But Road is also in dire straits. He has endured countless blows. Being humanoid, his stamina limits are clear. Perhaps the end is near.

So, this is the final battle. For both the goblin and him.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

From now on, he doesn't perfectly avoid attacks. Instead of completely blocking, he takes some damage and counterattacks. They exchange blows repeatedly.

The sword pierces through Road's shoulder. Taesan's pupils shake. Road's expression remains endlessly composed, as if he had aimed for this.

Road grabs Taesan's wrist. The sword digs in deep, making it impossible to escape.

He kicks Taesan's abdomen with his foot.

[You receive 35 damage.]

"Urgh!"

His body momentarily stiffens. Dull pain spreads across his chest.

A rib is broken. Judging by the sensation, it might be more than three.

[You activate Unyielding Will. Ignore all injuries and act for 10 seconds.]

The pain doesn't disappear, but the discomfort lessens. Taesan pushes the sword even deeper.

[Deal 25 damage to Road.] [Deal 25 damage to Road.]

The handle of the greatsword strikes Taesan's back.

[You receive 46 damage.]

With the sword still embedded, Taesan lifts it up. Shoulder skin and bones are torn.

Road strikes Taesan with his shoulder. The sound of bones breaking echoes.

[You receive 35 damage.]

Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

His entire body twitches. He forces his broken body to move. He stabs with the sword and creates wounds, repeating the process.

Taesan plunges his sword into Goblin Road's chest.

The blade embeds deeply. With the tip of the sword, he feels the heartbeat.

For a moment, Road's face relaxes. With a gentle expression, as if he has found peace, he whispers towards Taesan.

"Well done. Warrior..."

Something seems to leave Road's body.

Taesan felt that it was his soul.

Some spiritual essence scattered across the ground, not the ceiling.

It felt like delving into profound depths.

[You have defeated Goblin Road-Ha-Ha.] [You have cleared the quest of Laki Ratas.] [You have discovered hidden elements on the 3rd floor. Reward: [???].]

A system window announcing the end of the battle appeared.

It's over.

Taesan slumped down.

* * *

"Huff."

Breathing out, he closes his eyes and leans his back against the wall. His level has risen, releasing all physical fatigue, but the mental burden was quite significant.

"So this is Road."

It's strength that doesn't seem like that of a goblin. His strength, composure, ability to assess the situation, and response to variables were all perfect.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

If there had been even the slightest, tiny mistake, it would have been me who died. Even during Laki Ratas, it was risky, but this time it was truly touch-and-go.

"Are you okay?"

"Somewhat."

Pressing his temples, he eases his fatigue. As his mind slowly returns, a sudden thought strikes him.

"Why so quiet?"

Since the battle ended, the Ghost hadn't said a word. It simply stood quietly by Taesan's side.

"It's just... nothing."

The Ghost's voice trailed off. There seemed to be something different about its usual demeanor, but he didn't press further. Right now, he didn't have the capacity to spare for that.

"Phew."

He stretches.

Finally, he calms down.

His pounding heart returns to a normal rhythm.

"I should check things out soon."

He opened the system window blocking his view. Lines of text filled the screen so densely that he couldn't see ahead.

First, the rewards for victory.

[You have defeated an opponent where victory seemed impossible. Health increases by 50. Mana increases by 5. All stats increase by 7.]


Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

Victory against an impossible foe bonus. He had never seen that before. In Easy Mode, such formidable enemies never appeared, and since stepping outside, there had been no chance to receive rewards, so handling it properly this time was a first.

All stats +7. On top of that, health and mana increased. It was a much greater increase than any other reward.

And it didn't end there.

[You fought a fierce battle against an impossible foe. You obtained the special passive skill [Craving for Battle].] [You fought and triumphed over an impossible foe. You obtained the special passive skill [Craving for Victory].] [You successfully outmaneuvered an impossible foe in every encounter. You obtained the special active skill [Scorn of the Mighty].]
