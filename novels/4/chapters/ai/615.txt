**Chapter 616**

616. Easy Mode. Temporary Time Stop (4)

"Useless."

Taesan scowls, his face twisted in frustration. Despite investing a lot of time, he hasn't acquired a skill.

The conditions for acquiring skills were different, or he would get a completely useless skill that didn't meet his expectations. Such trial and error were not a big deal for Taesan, as he could obtain various skills in the end.

However, Taesan is feeling an unusual and strong sense of frustration right now.

"It's not working."

His narrow eyes gaze at the thousands of projectiles. He looks at them for a moment, then lets out a sigh and takes a step forward.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

He approaches the distorted projectiles. Taesan, who has reached the center of the room, holds a sword and shield.

He takes a deep breath, then moves his sword.

Ka-ang!

The first thing to collide with his sword is a needle.

A very thin needle collides with his sword, and its trajectory is deflected. It collides with other projectiles, creating an irregular pattern in an instant. Taesan enters the range where he can intervene.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But Taesan didn't waver. He had created an irregular pattern. Even within that irregularity, a pattern existed.

He read it. His mind accelerated. He raised his shield.

Bang! The sphere that collided with the shield bounced back. It flew towards Taesan again, colliding with the flying sword.

Taesan pressed the sphere down with his sword at an angle.

The sphere bounced back at a diagonal angle, flying out of range.

He turned his body around, stabbing his sword into the ground. The flying projectiles collided with his sword and bounced back.

His mind continued to rotate. It was meaningless to see only one or two steps ahead.

The constantly changing positions and types of projectiles.

The changing trajectories upon collision.

And the timing of the projectiles' collisions.

He had to accomplish all of that to reach a temporary pause. He foresaw dozens, hundreds of steps ahead. His body moved without rest.

[Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.]

Ka-chak!

He knocked back the projectiles that had been nullified, which collided with the sphere and flew towards the sky. In mid-air, they collided with the falling sword blade and bounced back in opposite directions.

Everything had gone according to Taesan's calculations.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Establishing thousands, tens of thousands of patterns, remembering the meaningful ones, and moving my body towards the goal.

It's been roughly two minutes.

It's now. Taesan lowers his stance.

Ka-ga-gak!

He presses the sphere with his shield. The sphere crushes numerous projectiles and touches the ground. The flying arrow above his head collides with the needle. The long sword moving from the left collides with the arrow, needle, and sphere all at once. The sphere on the upper right makes a loud noise and wobbles back and forth.

He takes a big step forward. The projectiles that have already been neutralized by the attack invalidation collide with Taesan's legs.

0.05 seconds. A fleeting moment.

In that moment, dozens of projectiles collide all at once.

Although it was brief, it felt like time had stopped.

Except for Taesan's back, that is.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

The projectiles collide with a loud noise behind him. Failure. Taesan clicks his tongue and steps out of the room.

"This is frustrating."

The reason for his frustration in this failure was simple.

It was due to his pure lack of ability.

'I can't calculate everything.'"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"To obtain the skill, all projectiles within the range that he could interfere with had to be temporarily stopped.

In other words, it meant that he had to read all the trajectories, types, speeds, and positions of the projectiles and artificially match the timing.

To be honest, it was crazy.

The human brain is not a supercomputer. There are limits to calculation and processing.

And Taesan had now reached those limits.

The problem was that he still hadn't met the conditions for the skill.

It was the same as blocking projectiles. He had grasped the conditions for the skill, but couldn't obtain it due to his lack of ability.

"Ugh."

The reason he was frustrated was because of his own inadequacy. If he had just been a little more talented, if he had just a little more ability, he could have obtained it all. The skill he couldn't obtain due to his inadequacy.

In this case, he felt frustration and anger towards his own inadequacy.

Of course, if someone else heard this, they would think it's ridiculous.

Creating a situation where thousands of projectiles flying in all directions couldn't even approach him for 10 seconds, making dozens of projectiles collide at once, and even calculating it all artificially.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Not even a genius could have attempted it.

But Taesan was genuinely frustrated. If he had just a little more talent, he could have grasped everything.

'It can't be.'

He had reached his limit. By analyzing the pattern that was set for about 2 minutes, he could stop about 80% of the projectiles.

But 20% was absolutely impossible.

It was the limit of his pure ability.

From the start, he couldn't even reach the corner behind him. To stop it, he would have to read everything, but his brain couldn't reach that far.

20%.

A number that was absolutely out of his reach with his abilities.

It wasn't small, but it wasn't large either - an ambiguous number.

'…….'

His tongue rolled around in his mouth. His stopped brain started rolling again.

'...This is crazy... but I can do it.'

Even Taesan, who had done countless crazy things, could be certain of it.

It was really a crazy thing to do.

But... there was a possibility.

That was enough.

'I'm doing all sorts of crazy things.'"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan nodded and entered the secret room. He stood in the center, took a deep breath, and moved his body.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

His movement was perfectly identical to the one before.

He had perfected the pattern he had learned over the past year to the best of his abilities. This was his limit. Adding anything more now would be meaningless.

Two minutes passed, and again, dozens of projectiles stopped.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

But the projectiles behind him were making a loud noise as they collided. Taesan was certain after hearing the sound for a moment.

20% was a number he couldn't predict or reach.

In other words, a completely different collision had occurred, unlike the previous attempt.

So, he stopped at 20%.

Not because of his ability, but due to pure luck.

He had reached the possibility of stopping all projectiles.

If he repeated the trial and error many times, wouldn't he eventually be able to reach it?

"I should have done it from the start."

Irregular. To obtain a skill that surpasses the line, there are things that are impossible with just his ability.

He would have to rely on pure luck and miracles.

Then, he would continue to try until that miracle happens.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's a realization and knowledge.

Taesan has now stepped into a separate realm.

Kagagaga!

The secret room is repeating the process of going in and out. It's been repeating for 2 minutes, and the projectiles behind him are colliding in different ways.

Taesan, who was moving his body, couldn't help but laugh.

Even if I say 20%, at least 10 projectiles were created.

The possibility that those 10 projectiles would collide purely by chance is ridiculously low.

'But.'

The impossible is not impossible.

A long, long time ago.

It's a life on Earth that's now barely remembered.

I remembered the article I saw back then.

In this infinite universe, a planet similar to Earth appears.

And life is born within it.

The probability of a high-level life form like humans emerging is like the probability of creating a complete clock by shaking a 25-meter pool filled with clock parts.

An infinitely close to impossible probability.

But that probability actually came true. Although it's now completely destroyed, there was definitely life on Earth."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Compared to that, this probability is extremely high, isn't it? It's just a matter of dozens of projectiles colliding at the same time. It's not difficult at all.

'That's right.'

Taesan sincerely believed it.

He went out of the room and came back in, moving his body according to the pattern.

After repeating it about ten times, a thought suddenly occurred to him.

'Did I say "reset"?'

There was a phrase like that in a mobile game. It was about deleting the game and reinstalling it to get a good character. He wasn't interested in that kind of game, but now he was doing something similar. He couldn't help but laugh.

He repeated it, and repeated it again.

Days turned into weeks.

And then a month passed.

He didn't know how long it would take. From now on, it was a pure battle of luck. Probability was like that.

It was just a simple repetitive task, so he tried to block out his consciousness as much as possible. He repeated the memorized actions, engraving them into his body.

A year passed.

But he still hadn't acquired the skill.

Itaeyeon boasted that he had perfectly escaped from the guide of evil, and Taesan congratulated him.

Another half year passed.

He still hadn't acquired the skill.

And then another two years went by."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taeyeon poured out all sorts of complaints, saying that the deep space was like a dump. However, she said that the library of Mansang was good because it had many books. She vowed not to leave until she had read all the books here.

And another year passed.

The labyrinth became really quiet.

Except for Taeyeon and Taesan, the community was almost stagnant.

And time continued to pass.

At some point, Taesan forgot why he was doing this.

He became completely mindless, and his body moved on its own.

Still, Taesan continued to enter the secret room.

It was like a kind of ascetic practice.

Although Taesan himself didn't realize it, his true nature was trying to reach a higher place.

He wanted to transcend the physical constraints and awaken his spirit to grasp the principles of the world.

But...

Suddenly.

The foreign fragments that had been dormant within him blocked it. They contaminated the high place that was rising, devouring and trampling it. Taesan couldn't even recognize what was happening and continued to move his body.

And finally...

KA-BOOM!

A collision sound rang out. It wasn't a loud, irregular noise like before.

It was the sound of all projectiles within a certain range colliding at once, and the sound of his goal being achieved.

"You have stopped everything within the range that you can interfere with. You have acquired the special activation skill [Temporary Time Stop]."
