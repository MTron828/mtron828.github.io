Chapter 362

362. 76th Floor, the Cursed Child (2)

The man from the thief group tried to get up somehow.

He tried to shake off Taesan and escape.

But it was impossible. He couldn't even stand up, let alone escape. It was hard for him to even breathe properly.

"What the...!"

The man was shocked.

They weren't weak. From the start, they had the ability to receive tolls from those who passed through, which meant they had the power to escape even if someone came to defeat them.

But to Taesan, that power was meaningless.

"Don't be too scared. If you answer correctly, I'll let you go."

Taesan spoke calmly.

His languid voice was like the voice of death to them.

Taesan began to question them. They answered his questions very enthusiastically.

As a result, Taesan was able to obtain some useful information.

"So, you're saying the cursed child is..."

The illegitimate child of the divine bloodline. It was widely known that the child was a being cursed by all things.

The reason was simple.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Everything in the place where the child is becomes ruined and desolate because of that.

When the child stays in the village, the village is destroyed. Buildings collapse, and people die silently.

When the child stays in the forest, the forest becomes desolate. The lake dries up, and the plants wither and twist.

And in the process, the cursed child doesn't even get a single scratch.

"At that time, when everyone was afraid and puzzled, the Emperor himself gave an oracle. He said that the child is a being that destroys the world just by existing, and is cursed by all things."

"The Emperor?"

"The ruler of the sacred empire that has governed this world for a very long time. He is also the apostle of the God of Rules, and has transcended human boundaries."

The face of the bandit leader who spoke these words was filled with reverence. It was not a simple ruler, but a feeling of worshiping a god.

"The Emperor is the ruler of the world. His words are law. That's why we call that child the cursed child and keep our distance."

Taesan listened to the explanation and thought for a moment.

He then asked the bandit leader again."

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$"So, the curse only occurs if the cursed child stays in one place for more than a day?"

"Yes, yes......the cursed child has always had the curse appear when they stay in one place for that long."

"What about if the cursed child is constantly moving?"

"I don't have information on that..."

Following the cursed child. It's not something anyone would do.

The man glanced briefly at Mount Taisan.

The story he just told was just common sense.

But it seemed like he was hearing it for the first time, as Mount Taisan spoke.

"Alright then, I'll be on my way."

"Ah, thank you!"

It was unclear if Mount Taisan was really going to save him, but he hurriedly ran away. The remaining bandits quickly followed after him.

"Could the master of the new bloodline have such a characteristic?"

[Um...I don't know. There's just not enough information. It doesn't seem impossible, but could the master of the new bloodline really not have a single scratch?]

The ghost also had a vague appearance. First, we'll confirm the conditions from the side. Mount Taisan moved.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The child couldn't go far. It was caught up in just two steps. Taesan stood in front of the child.

"Huh?"

The child's pupils grew larger at the sight of Taesan blocking their path.

"Wait, didn't you leave?"

"I heard those guys talking about you earlier."

"Ah... you didn't know about me, did you?"

It was then that the child understood. They had no idea about their own curse, which was why Taesan was following them. The child made a judgment.

"I'm causing harm and death to those around me just by existing. So, please leave me."

The child said this and took a step forward.

And Taesan followed behind them.

"Uh..."

"Where are you going?"

"Yes, yes?"

The child stuttered in surprise at Taesan's question.

"...... A vast forest. I'm going to the Recreation Zone."

"Then let's go together."

"Yes?"

The child was taken aback.

"If you stay by my side, you'll get cursed! You need to leave quickly!"

"I'm strong," Taesan said calmly.

"At least in this world, there's no one who can curse me."

"Eh..."

The child didn't seem to believe Taesan's words.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But to Taesan, it was really like that. If it was a fight, maybe he could shake it off lightly, but the curse was not something he could easily get rid of.

"So, let's go together."

* * *

The child tried desperately to shake off Taesan after that.

He tried with words and even tried to hide by moving his body.

But nothing worked. Taesan didn't listen to the child's words, and he immediately found the place where he was hiding.

In the end, the child gave up.

"I don't know even if I'm cursed."

Taesan walked alongside the child, who tried to keep as much distance from Taesan as possible.

Since it was a fairly wide road, there weren't many people coming and going.

"What?"

"The cursed child……."

And the people who discovered the child's true identity took a step back in shock, gazing at him as if they were seeing a monster, not a human.

The child calmly accepted that gaze.

The child continued walking, and night fell. The child stumbled and entered the forest.

The child lay down on the soft grassy ground, which was the most comfortable spot.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The sound of a rumbling stomach came from the child's belly as they tried to fall asleep.

"......"

The child's face turned bright red with embarrassment.

Taesan, who had been gazing at the child for a moment, went into the forest.

"Ah."

The child, without realizing it, tried to call out to Taesan but stopped.

If Taesan were to leave, it would be a good thing. With that thought, the child tried to calm themselves down and lay back down, but Taesan reappeared.

"What?"

The child's eyes widened in surprise.

Taesan was holding a deer in their hand.

Taesan threw the deer down and waved their hand. Flames engulfed the deer, and the sound of sizzling filled the air as the meat began to cook slowly.

"Ah......"

The child stared blankly at the deer.

The child's body was weak and slow, unable to catch fast wild animals. As a result, they mostly filled their belly with grasses and fruits. Even meat was limited to fish.

And now, meat was being cooked right in front of the child's eyes.

Taesan spoke to the child, who was staring at the deer in awe.

"Eat."

"......Really?"

"I brought it for you to eat from the start."

"G, thank you!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The child rammed their head into the scorching hot meat. Although it was extremely hot and they jumped back, startled, they didn't give up and continued to tear at the meat with a "huff" and a "puff".

Taesan saw this and waved their hand. The wind blew, making the temperature just right for eating the meat.

The child quickly filled their belly with the meat.

Only then did they feel a wave of drowsiness wash over them, and they stumbled and fell asleep.

The child fell asleep as if they had fainted.

Taesan gathered some wood and started a fire.

They created a gentle breeze that allowed the child to sleep comfortably.

The child's face looked more at ease.

The next day, the child opened their eyes wide, looking at Taesan's unharmed appearance.

"Huh? Huh?"

Until now, every place the child had stayed for more than a day had been devastated.

But Taesan had been by the child's side for more than a day without a single injury.

"How...?"

"I told you, I'm strong."

Taesan said calmly.

"I'm not affected by your curse."

"Oh, oh...".

The child was taken aback.

It was an unprecedented experience, and they were extremely confused.

But life began to return to the child's eyes.

The distance between the child and Taesan, who were walking again, was closer than the day before.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The child kept talking to Taesan, and Taesan responded appropriately.

"So, I was thrilled to catch a squirrel and eat its meat, but suddenly the baby squirrels came out. I was too hungry, but I had to let them go."

"Honestly, I still don't know much about mushrooms. I don't know what's edible and what's not."

"I wonder how long it took to build a road this big. I'm sure it took a lot of people's effort."

The child's words didn't end. It was as if they were trying to have a conversation they had been unable to have for a long time, and they kept talking as they walked.

They continued on their way, and night fell again. The child tried to stay awake, nodding off occasionally.

"I'm sleepy, let's sleep."

"No, we can't. There's still a lot to talk about..."

The child desperately tried to shake off sleep.

As they wandered the world alone, they wanted to tell all about their experiences and amazing events.

They were thirsty for human conversation and wanted to keep talking.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The princess of the Veseta kingdom. She was different from Anetsha. Anetsha was also a child, but as a princess, she had received education and was able to accept reality and analyze it calmly.

But this child was truly just a child.

So, even when she tried to push Taesan away, she couldn't do it properly. When she realized that Taesan was not affected by her curse, she immediately opened up her heart.

Taesan asked,

"Don't you have a reason to risk your life?"

"……."

The child remained silent to Taesan's question.

"No."

The child shook her head.

"I... am a being that shouldn't exist in this world. The only way for me and the world to be saved is for me to devote my body to the Emperor."

Her voice was filled with conviction, as if there was no other choice. Taesan opened his mouth.

"Why do you want to devote your body to the Emperor?"

"Because only the Emperor can lift my curse."

The child spoke with a hint of sadness.

"I also went to the temple to understand my curse. The Emperor himself prayed to the gods to understand me. I was cursed from birth, and I can't even die as I please."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Just dying alone is a curse that spreads throughout the world, tormenting all existence. And even if I'm alive, the curse ruins everything around me because of it."

"There's only one being who can solve this, Your Majesty the Emperor. I shouldn't exist."

The child clenched their fist.

Their arm was trembling slightly.

"This is a journey for him."

The child fell asleep with a gloomy face.

Taesan stirred the campfire.

"Is this a choice?"

What kind of conclusion is the god of choice hoping for?

Taesan gazed up at the night sky. The vast expanse of stars was spread out before him.

Taesan, who had been staring blankly, opened his mouth.

"Block it."

[You have activated the Declaration of Blockade.]

Kwaduk.

With the declaration, the space distorts. The power of the gaze that was directed at him is blocked and crushed.

The crushed power contained anger and frustration.

No further gaze could be felt. Taesan stirred the campfire again.

* * *

"I've arrived..."

The child muttered, gazing at the vast forest. It was an extremely beautiful forest. The child entered with a gloomy face.

"A vast forest. Rekregen. Do you know what kind of place this is?"

"I don't know."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's a very beautiful forest. Many plants and animals have lived here for a long time, and it's a forest that people love. I'm going to...…"

The child clenched their fist and went deeper into the forest.

As they went further in, where human hands couldn't reach, the path became increasingly difficult. Eventually, the child's arm was cut by a sharp leaf and they were injured.

"Ow!"

Blue blood spurted out from the child's arm.

The child looked gloomy and went even deeper.

Taesan picked up the leaf with blue blood on it.

"When I said I would sacrifice myself, a revelation came down. To become a sacrifice, I must pass through trials. I must clearly realize what kind of existence I am and how horribly distorted I am."

The child, who had reached the center of the forest, sat down.

"I'll stay here for a day. This is the first trial."

If the child stays in a specific place for a day, that place becomes cursed and withers away.

The child said with a sorrowful face,

"Please spare me. I don't know how you're not cursed, but this time it's really not going to work out."

The child didn't fully understand why Taesan was unaffected either.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But this time it was different. Every place he stayed for more than a day was devastated. There was no reason for this time to be different.

"No."

Taesan shook his head. The child was complicated by Taesan's choice, but at the same time, was grateful.

"......Thank you for being by my side."

The child quietly nodded.

Time passed.

The child spent time sleeping and eating. Taesan brought meat and the child quietly closed their eyes, savoring each bite.

Like that, a day passed.

Birds chirped and the sound of flowing water was heard.

The scent of grass was strong, and the leaves rustled in the wind.

The forest was peaceful.

"Huh?"

The child's eyes widened in surprise.
