Chapter 114

114. 24th floor. The Guide of Sin (3)

As the approaching footsteps echoed, Tai Shan raised his head.

"Hello?"

"Not as young as I thought?"

"The external appearance is meaningless, isn't it? But... it's still young. At most, it's in its early twenties?"

The guides of sin looked at Tai Shan with a relaxed expression.

Tai Shan counted the number of them. There were four, and then they disappeared from view.

"Just four of you?"

The top guide of the third rank thought he knew everything.

When Tai Shan was defeated by the second rank guide, and Horian died, he thought that everyone was descending. But just four? It was a correct judgment, but just four was a bit disappointing.

"These people have been stuck here for dozens of years. If it were the past, I wouldn't know... but now, their strength has all declined.]

"I thought it would be all of them, but it doesn't matter."

No matter how many or few there were, it meant nothing to him. The woman awkwardly waved her hand.

"Uh... Hero. Hello?"

[It's nice, but we're not on familiar terms, are we?]

"That's right."
Here is the translation of the text:

The guides' eyes, which had been smiling, began to sink.

Suddenly, the air was filled with tension. Tai Shan took out his sword.

[You have launched a reconnaissance mission.] [Hajing Loyah] [Level: 65] [Health: 3165] [Equipped weapon: Spear] [Crouching down.]

A man with brown hair and an Arab-like face was holding a three-sectional staff and looking at Tai Shan.

[Barven Louata] [Level: 65] [Health: 2995] [Equipped weapon: Short sword] [Crouching down.]

A man wearing a black robe that clung to his body without any weapons was probably a member of the thief's guild.

[Ariniacia Clarius] [Health: 2350] [Equipped weapon: Cane] [Crouching down.]

She was the only woman, with long blue hair and carrying a cane, which made her look like a mage.

[Kashian] [Health: 2991] [Equipped weapon: Bow] [Crouching down.]

And finally, there was the archer.

The distribution of roles was complete. Tai Shan puffed out his chest. His muscles tensed, and his mind became focused.

"Is the story going to be long?"

"Not necessary, of course."
Here is the translation of the text:

As the answer was given, the Great Mountain stomped its foot.

[You have activated the Deer Walking on Wind.] [You have accelerated.]

It was incredibly fast. They were astonished by the approach that far exceeded their expectations.

However, even so, the 30th-floor adventurer quickly responded. The mage shook his staff.

[Ariensia has activated her magic.] [Judgment unnecessary!]

"Ah, oh?"

The magic was released. Casian shot his bow. The power and speed were suitable for the 30th floor.

The Great Mountain did not dodge and manipulated the wind. The concentrated wind made the arrow's trajectory deviate. The arrow whizzed by without touching.

"Hey!"

Kahah!

The sword of the Great Mountain clashed with the halberd of Ha Jing. Ha Jing felt a sense of awe at the power emanating from beyond the halberd.

'I'm stronger than you!'

The stats showed that the Great Mountain was stronger. Having reached the limit of the 30th floor and confident in their own superiority, Ha Jing had a gap in their movement.

A blue flame erupted from the Great Mountain's sword, dodging Ha Jing's halberd and striking his chest.

[226 damage to Ha Jing.]

"Just a moment!"

"What damage is this?"
Here is the translation of the text:

They're not just watching idly. The mage is casting a spell, and the archer has pulled back his bow. The thief is trying to insert his short sword into the mountain's back.

[You have triggered the "Distorted Vegetation" of Dekaravia.]

And the roots are rushing towards them. The black aura-infused plants in the room are pushing them back, and they're hastily stopping their attack and retreating.

"Black Magic!"

"It's not a demon, though......!"

Whoosh.

While they're regrouping, the mountain is continuing to apply pressure on Ha-jing.

Ha-jing didn't just stand still either. He activated his skills and tried to escape the crisis with his swordsmanship.

But they were all blocked.

The skills were rendered ineffective by the mountain's light movements, and the swordsmanship was pierced by the black aura-infused sword. Half of his life force was lost in an instant.

"What's going on?"

"Is that so?"

[You have triggered the "Frost Arrow" and "Fiery Ring" skills.]

The mountain continued to apply pressure on Ha-jing with his magic, black magic, and divine skills. Just as he was about to make his move, an attack came flying in at the perfect timing, and Arienesia let out a scream.

"What's with the eyes on the back of your head?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan's field of vision has almost reached 100%. It's almost as if there are no blind spots. For those who have a proficiency of around 40 to 50%, it's hard to understand the level of competition.

Taesan wielded his sword with a rough swing. Hahjing's sword was shaken violently by the force. Taesan inserted the sword into Hahjing's chest without hesitation.

"Ah."

Hahjing's sword flew up to the sky. Taesan's sword pierced Hahjing's chest.

"Ah, ahah..."

[You won against Hahjing Roya.]

"Ik!"

Arienezia gritted her teeth and waved her hand. Her mana burst forth, and a spell was cast.

[Arienezia activated the storm arrow.]

Kakakaka!

The wind blew, creating a massive arrow. Taesan caught the arrow with a flash of light.

"It's strong."

It was one of the strongest spells he had ever seen. If it hits, it would be a devastating blow that could drain hundreds of health points.

[A mid-level spell... it's usable even at 30th floor.]

Arienezia glared at Taesan with a fierce gaze and waved her hand.

The arrow was launched. There was no place to dodge, and it was impossible to think of dodging.

[You have activated the forced duel. For the next 10 seconds, you cannot take damage from anyone except Baven Luisa.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The arrow that touched the Taesan exploded, losing its magic and scattering in all directions.

"What's going on?"

The Taesan rushed towards them, not understanding what was happening.

* * *

The guide of evil.

They were not weak. If they had simply combined their powers, they could have pressured the Taesan.

However, their coordination was extremely loose, and they were not prepared.

The thief could not even scratch the Taesan's back, the archer could not apply any pressure, and the magician could not display any magic due to continued suppression.

Even the magic that appeared later was rendered meaningless due to the forced duel.

It was natural, as they had never coordinated with each other. There was no one to fight together, so it was a natural outcome.

And even if their coordination had been perfect, there was no change.

The forced duel, which made it impossible for anyone to intervene except the target.

As long as that was the case, pushing the Taesan with numbers meant nothing.

And that was the result.

"Crash."

"That was really annoying."
Here is the translation of the text:

The last remaining bandit's heart was pierced. Although he tried to escape carefully, he couldn't evade the scouts and his life force disappeared from his eyes.

[You have won against Bavben Luitta.] [Your level has risen.] [Your spiritual upgrade has been activated. Your agility has permanently increased by 36, your strength by 21, your intelligence by 19, and your vitality by 100.] [You have obtained the special skill [Stealth].]

You have won against four guides and your level has reached 4. Your stats have increased even more, and you have obtained two skills.

"Status Window."

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 60] [Shield: 329/329] [Vitality: 3830/3830] [Mana: 716/716] [Magic: 44/44] [Strength: 1246] [Intelligence: 915] [Agility: 1102] [Attack Power + 145] [Defense Power + 172] [Target is in the best state.]

All of your stats have increased by around 100. You have obtained two skills, which will allow you to reach a level where you can defeat the guides, and you have also obtained the skill.
Here is the translation of the text:

[SPECIAL ACTIVATION SKILL: HIDE] [MANA CONSUMPTION: 20] [SKILL LEVEL: 1%] [Hides one's body and eliminates noise. However, it is still very unrefined.]

It was a skill similar to the Transparent Skill. The effect seemed similar, and there was no significant difference.

It's probably a skill that can be used by those who have not learned magic. It may not have much significance, but it's not bad either.

[Beginner Magic: Wind Explosion] [MANA CONSUMPTION: 9] [SKILL LEVEL: 1%] [Causes a wind explosion.]

The explanation was very simple, and the effect was just as simple. The mountain held up its finger.

[You have launched a Wind Explosion.]

Pffft!

A gust of wind burst forth from in front of the mountain, striking its face roughly and pushing it backward.

The power itself was not particularly impressive, but like a lightning strike, there was no delay and the location of the explosion was limited to around the mountain. From the perspective of restricting the enemy's actions or blocking projectiles, this spell was sufficient.

"So, when will it come?"

These four were not the end. According to the ghost's words, there were still about five more.

[Oh, I don't think it will come.]

The ghost muttered ambiguously.

* * *

"I'm dead."
Here is the translation of the text:

In the silence, a man's voice echoed. The four gemstones in front of him had all gone out.

"......Are they all dead?"

"Yes."

The administrator spoke in a voice similar to a sigh.

"All of them... are dead."

"How, how fast? It's not even been two hours yet!"

Someone shouted in denial.

"You can't escape even if you're not good at it! Don't lie!"

"I thought the same way. That's why I sent it."

The difference in equipment is absolute. Even if the opponent is an extremely skilled adventurer, a 24th-floor adventurer can't defeat those wearing 30th-floor equipment. It takes a long time. Even if a problem arises, I believed that they could escape easily.

"But... they're all dead."

The silence returned.

The administrator barely opened his mouth.

"Should we go up and fight?"

"...That's not an attractive proposal. You killed the four of them in two hours. I don't think it will change even if you say six."

The woman regained her composure and muttered to herself. It was not a wrong judgment, but it was not the correct answer either.

"If that demon was there......"

Note: The story seems to be a fantasy adventure story, and the characters are discussing a situation where a group of people died in a short period of time.
Here is the translation of the text:

Not long ago, a demon left the 3rd floor. It had been granted permission by the leaders to guide them. However, they had not been granted permission to go to the places they went.

At first, they sent jealousy and envy. They lit up their eyes, saying, "I'll check what's different with my own eyes." But after a short time of being together, they realized.

That demon was like a monster, incredibly strong. It had abilities that were unmatched even among those at the same level.

Then, they could have been opponents. But the administrator shook their head.

"He's already gone down. And he won't come back, you know. It's meaningless to imagine it."

"So what should we do...?"

They were unable to come up with an answer and were in a state of confusion. The administrator somehow managed to open their mouth.

"Let's wait for a while. That guy is still on the 24th floor."

Their current location is on the 30th floor. It takes time to go down. One man frowned.

"Should we give him time to grow stronger?"

"It's pointless for us to win. So, we'll give him time and make contact with those below."

"...Are we waiting until the leaders who left return?"

After a cruel decision, they let out a sigh.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was a boast, but the conclusion was clear. Since it was impossible to defeat the adventurers, they hoped for the early arrival of the leader.

If their prayer was successful, they could survive, but if it failed, they would die.

Their abilities didn't matter at all, as the choice was already made.

"But I have no other means."

The manager spoke with a pleading tone, and the others nodded in silence.

"So, I'll make a decision. Let's escape after contacting each other. We'll hold on until the leader arrives."

"...It's so bitter."

Someone muttered to themselves, and they all shared a bitter smile.

* * *

Tai Shan, who was leaning against the wall, muttered to himself.

"They won't come."

They waited for about two hours. Although it was enough time to realize the abnormality and prepare, no one came.

"Yes, my prediction was correct."

[The guides are pitiful people who are afraid of failure and hesitate to make decisions. But it's disappointing.]

The ghost spoke with a tone of disdain.

[They must have decided to wait until the leader arrives. Whether it's good or bad, it's all the same.]

"It doesn't matter which way it goes."

It doesn't matter even if the leader arrives. They have prepared for it.
Here is the translation:

"But... I think I should give it a little time."

"What? Why?"

"The quest has appeared."

Tae-san gazed up at the sky.

The quest log read "Return to Earth".
