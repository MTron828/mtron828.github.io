Chapter 322

322. 70th Floor, Broken Man

Broken Man gazed at Taesan with a very satisfied expression. Despite not being involved in anything, he looked pleased.

"It's amazing. The one who couldn't reach the depths defeated the one who did. That's incredible."

Broken Man chuckled and sent a glance.

"That kid I saw back then has grown up so quickly."

Broken Man hadn't had high expectations for Taesan.

He thought that even if Taesan went down to the labyrinth, he would eventually get stuck and give up.

But to have come this far... and to have defeated Vishnu, the Fire Spirit King...

It was astonishing. It was admirable.

Taesan spoke quietly.

"So, do I just need to defeat you now?"

"Is that so?"

Taesan drew his sword, taking a battle stance. Unlike Taesan, Broken Man didn't draw his sword, but instead waved his hand.

"Let's take a break for a bit. To be honest, I don't think I can be your opponent."

Broken Man stabbed the floor with his sword, as if this place was his own territory.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'm on the 70th floor. I couldn't reach the deepest level and got broken. Vishnu, who went all the way to the deepest level, is naturally stronger than me. And you, you defeated such a Vishnu."

It's not enough to be simply fast and strong to be confident in victory.

But still, Broken Man couldn't win against Taesan. There was a gap between them that big.

"There's no need to rush. Let's take a break for now. Although our fatigue was relieved with the level up, it's good to have some time to organize our thoughts, right?"

"That's right."

There was no need to refuse the favor. There were a few things to confirm anyway. Taesan sat down in his seat.

* * *

[Taesan [Alone] : Haven't you cleared the other places yet?] [Hwiyeon [Hard] : No. All communities except for Korea, Japan, and China are quiet. They might have been wiped out, but it doesn't seem like it... It's like they haven't returned to Earth yet.]

As of now, only Korea, China, and Japan have completed the Earth's quest.

It wasn't strange. Players from each designated country had to gather in one place, and there was no time limit for the quest.

Note: It appears that this text is from a fantasy or game-related story, and some terms may not be directly translatable. I've done my best to provide a natural-sounding translation, but some nuances may be lost in translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There must be a country that needs to cross the sea, and there must be a country that needs to traverse the long and vast plains. Originally, it was a quest that would take years to complete.

The Taesan element, which is not normal, made it impossible for it to be a long-term war.

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard] : ……Maybe Gosin isn't targeting another country?]

Taesan took advantage of the gap in the earth and targeted players from other countries. It was a possible story, but Taesan denied it.

[Gang Taesan [Alone] : We don't have the luxury to do that.]

Gosin had consumed a lot to kill Taesan. It was to the extent that the gods themselves could intervene in the quest.

Then, there would be no spare energy to target other places.

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard] : That's really a relief.]

The possibility had caused Kim Hwi-yeon's writing to be filled with anxiety.

After that, Taesan exchanged stories with Kim Hwi-yeon and Chinese players through the community. They shared small talk, such as how the relationships between countries were not bad.

After the rough information exchange was over, Taesan called Lee Tae-yeon and Gang Jun-hyeok."

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Gang Tae-san [Alone]: How is it?] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: It's not bad. Thanks to the power I gained on Earth, I'm able to descend more easily.]"

Tae-san, who was searching his memories, asked.

"[Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Did you guys make a contract with a mid-level spirit?] [Gang Jun-hyuk [Alone]: Yes.] [Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Is it helpful?] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Yes, very much! It's quite strong, and it's enough to assist in battle. Moreover, it's cute! Just holding it makes me happy!]"

It was a rare, lively, and bright post from Lee Tae-yeon. Tae-san chuckled.

He was going down to the labyrinth alone, without anyone's help.

It was a mentally very difficult task. Tae-san had a ghost, so he could talk to it, but Gang Jun-hyuk and Lee Tae-yeon didn't even have that, so they were truly alone.

In such a situation, having an absolute ally like a spirit was a great comfort.

"[Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Hang in there.]"

Tae-san left those words and turned off the community.

"It's good."

Tae-san remembered. He remembered how hard Lee Tae-yeon had struggled in her past life. He remembered how many posts she had written on the community while descending into the labyrinth.

That was not the case now.

It was a good thing.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan stood up. The Broken Man, who had been waiting from a distance, asked.

"Is the break over?"

"Yes."

The Broken Man's hand, grasping the window, tightened its grip.

Taesan drew his sword.

The situation became a face-to-face confrontation.

The Broken Man opened his mouth.

"Do you know why I called those guys my peers? They seemed to be just like me, after all."

As he descended into the labyrinth, he would eventually stumble, hesitate, and become a failure. The Broken Man thought that even the guides of sin were no different.

"I just realized it early, and they realized it late. There's not much difference. But you... might be different."

The Broken Man's hand, grasping the window, tightened its grip again.

With a bursting sound, he accelerated. He swung his sword to deflect the window that was about to pierce his head.

Ka-ga-gak!

The window sliced through the air and was deflected.

[You have activated the King's Vessel.] [You have activated the Avatar of Nature.]

A tremendous power and strength were bestowed upon Taesan. He charged forward, swinging his sword. With a single strike, the Broken Man's body flew far away.

"Haha!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The broken man laughed. He quickly regained his posture and grasped the sword with a firm hand. The sword trembled and drew a trajectory.

The mystery contained in the sword. It was a clear enigma. Only those who had devoted countless years to a single sword and reached its end could see it.

But it was shattered.

The broken man's mystery was crushed by an overwhelming power. As the sword's attack swept towards him, the broken man laughed.

* * *

The broken man did not lose his fighting spirit. Even as he was pushed back by the overwhelming power, he found a way to win.

It was the same method he had used when he had descended into the labyrinth in the past.

But even so, he could not win.

At the end of the short and long battle, the broken man was defeated.

"This is the power that can see the end. I'm somewhat satisfied."

The broken man dropped his sword.

He was a failure. He had given up, judging that he could not go any further.

The emotions of a failure towards someone who is moving forward are admiration, respect, or jealousy and hatred.

The broken man was the former.

"I may be trapped here and unable to escape, but... I'll be cheering for you."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The broken man smiled faintly and disappeared into the light, reconciled.

He wasn't dead. He probably went back to the entrance of the labyrinth.

The broken man will play the role of guiding those who fall into the labyrinth again.

Taesan unsheathed his sword.

A noisy system window filled his field of vision."

Note: "브로큰 맨" can be translated to "broken man", but it's possible that it's a proper noun or a title, so I left it as is. Also, "미궁" can be translated to "labyrinth" or "maze", but I chose "labyrinth" as it seems to fit the context better.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**Your level has risen.**

**You have reached the 70th floor. You have obtained the title "One Who Has Reached the Entrance of the Deep".**

**You have perfectly cleared the 70th floor. You have obtained the title "One Who Has Entered a New Realm".**

**You have perfectly cleared all floors up to the 70th floor. You have obtained the title "One Who Has Made Progress Through Conquest".**

**You have reached the place that mages have longed for. You have obtained the title "One Who Has Received the Expectations of Mages".**

**You have reached a deep and profound place. This is a place where gods reside, where all sorts of terrifying things live, and where the secrets of the world can be discovered.**

**It is up to you to decide whether to move forward or to be satisfied with your current achievements.**

**You have been given a new reward based on your achievements up to the 70th floor. You have obtained the title "One Who Has Obtained Qualifications".**

**The deep and profound place is a place where you can gain great enlightenment just by reaching it. You have obtained the special passive skill "The Pride of One Who Has Reached the Entrance".**

**Title: One Who Has Reached the Entrance of the Deep**

**You have reached the entrance of the deep.**

**Health + 500**

**Strength + 300**

**Attack Power + 100**

**Defense + 100**

The titles "One Who Has Entered a New Realm" and "One Who Has Made Progress Through Conquest" were not much different from "One Who Has Reached the Entrance of the Deep". They were titles that increased overall stats and attack power.

The difference started from the next one.

**Title: One Who Has Received the Expectations of Mages**

**A small reward given to those who have reached the place that mages have longed for.**

**Magic + 50**

**Mana + 1000**

**Mana regeneration speed increases by 30%.**

As a mage, the reward was also a title related to magic. The increase in magic and mana stats was significant, but the increase in mana regeneration speed was the most noticeable.

**Title: One Who Has Obtained Qualifications**

**A proof given to those who have utilized many things while descending into the labyrinth and have obtained their own power.**

**Attack Power + 100**

**The proficiency growth rate of all skills increases significantly.**

"This is..."

Taesan quietly read the skill description.

The increase in skill proficiency growth rate.

"Did you get this?"

[Yes?]

The ghost looked at the system window. After reading the contents for a moment, the ghost spoke in a trembling voice.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[...No way. What is this? I didn't have a title like this?]

"What's with you?"

[But I did have a title that I earned, and its effect was to increase my proficiency in swordsmanship and help me understand the intricacies of sword fighting.]

A title with a different effect.

Taesan was able to understand the reason.

"A new reward based on achievements."

It was a title whose effect changed depending on what you handled and what you achieved as you descended into the labyrinth.

The warrior who focused on swordsmanship saw an increase in their swordsmanship proficiency. On the other hand, Taesan, who handled almost all types of skills, seemed to have increased the proficiency growth rate of all skills.

"What's the effect?"

[It's considerable.]

The ghost replied.

[This is also something you need to figure out as you descend into the labyrinth, so I can't say much, but you won't be disappointed.]

"That's right, this is it."

The sentence "Great Leap" was written. Considering how strict the labyrinth's system explanations are, it's likely that the explanation "Great Leap" would be satisfying, just as the ghost said.

Note: The text appears to be a passage from a fantasy novel or game, and the context is about a character named Taesan who has obtained a title or achievement in a labyrinth, and is discussing its effects with a ghost.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As the proficiency of spirit magic, intermediate magic, and dark magic was increasing at an incredible rate, this title was expected to be of great help in the future.

[Special passive skill: The one who reaches the entrance will gain a profound realization. The user's strength will be enhanced.]

It was another skill that enhanced the strength of the one who obtained it. It was also what was expected. The high-ranking officials didn't back down even against Taesan, who possessed the sacred vessel and the king's container.

It meant that there was a skill or item that enhanced strength. This title seemed to be one of them.

The rough confirmation was over.

Taesan went down the stairs.

Finally, he reached the deep floor.

A strange sensation that something was different came over him.

And instead of the usual shop owner, Balbam was waiting for Taesan.

[I'm here.]

Balbam spoke quietly.

[Welcome, adventurer. You have arrived at this place, the deep floor.]"
