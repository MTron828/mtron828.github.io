Chapter 533

533. 95th Floor. Essence (7)

First, he had to confirm where he had reached.

He had climbed to a position equal to that of the Transcender and the High Priest.

However, there was one problem.

Taesan himself didn't know what level he had reached.

A distorted and twisted realm. Only Taesan had reached this realm, and since there was no comparison, it was impossible to confirm with simple intuition.

"I need to try a direct confrontation at least."

At least, it wasn't a problem that could be solved now.

So, he decided to identify the changes first.

During the process of filling his mind with his complete self, many skills had changed. Since he didn't know exactly what had changed, he needed to check each one individually.

[[The Vessel] had disappeared.]

A vessel that could hold and contain many things.

The skill, which implied that Taesan's body was the vessel of the Usurper, had disappeared.

Now that he had completely eliminated the Usurper within him and removed all impurities, it seemed natural that the skill had also disappeared.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even in the midst of chaos, there was a similar sentence. It was a sentence that changed into something new by resonating with it.

And as the chaos call changed into a passive skill, that part was completely erased.

[Special Passive Skill: Chaos] [The power of many gods bestowed upon the apostle. It resonated with the complete you and changed into chaos. This is yours alone.]

The chaos call was a powerful skill.

The control over the boundary line became significantly stronger, and it could be handled almost perfectly in terms of physical strength. The consumption of magical power also decreased greatly, making it possible to use black magic much more efficiently.

It has now changed into a passive skill.

Originally, it only activated for an hour, and the cooldown was a day. The fact that the time constraint itself disappeared was significant enough.

But that's not all. The effect of the skill itself also changed.

'Is it chaos?'

Maybe it's referring to the boundary line. But the skill that has changed now is too much. I couldn't tell if what Taesan can do now is exactly thanks to chaos."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"First, I confirmed it. There were too many skills that had changed, making it difficult to grasp each one individually. In the end, Taesan focused on the core skills that were essential.

The skills obtained through the surge in spiritual energy had changed the most. The authorities gained from the gods were also among them.

[Transcendence: Self-Immunity] [Proficiency: ^@] [Unaffected by %@, and gains strong resistance to!@$]. It's still incomplete, with ^$$ remaining. This skill is controlled by Transcendence [Boundary].

It was added that all skills related to black would be controlled by Transcendence [Boundary].

It definitely felt different from before. The Transcendence skills obtained through the surge in spiritual energy. He could wield them, but it felt like wearing clothes that didn't fit his body.

But now, it was different.

The Self-Immunity that enveloped his entire body was naturally embracing him.

Taesan raised his arm.

He focused his mind and moved his Self-Immunity. The intangible energy naturally flowed and concentrated on his arm.

Whoosh.

The Self-Immunity firmly grasped a specific area.

Taesan shook his arm. The Self-Immunity left his arm and enveloped his entire body again."

Note: The ^@, %@,!@$, and ^$$ symbols appear to be placeholders or variables, and their actual values are not provided in the text.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Now, it's possible to utilize it in this way too."

The fact that self-transcendence is like this means that other transcendent powers are also the same, right?

"Can I confirm all of this?"

It was too much, even if there were many.

The powers he had obtained were not just one or two. Just counting the levels of power, there were black, worthless, time interference, compression, and self-transcendence - five in total.

It wasn't strange that it took several days to fully grasp just one of them.

For now, I'll put it off for later. Instead of focusing on detailed control, I'll focus on a bigger concept. It was ridiculous to think that there was something more important than controlling power, but it was true.

Taesan gazed at his skill window, which was empty.

"I didn't know I had this left."

Taesan had the skill "Spiritual Ascension".

It was the strongest card that had made him who he was today, having stolen numerous powers and abilities.

However, Spiritual Ascension had been tainted by the usurper and was no longer his pure ability. So Taesan had abandoned Spiritual Ascension with his own hands.

He thought he would never get it back, but during the process of rediscovering himself, Spiritual Ascension was newly restored.

It was in a much more powerful form, to say the least.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Transcendence: Seizing the Opponent's Authority] [Proficiency: 100%] [The soul has reached a higher world. A high-level soul can steal the opponent's power every time it wins. You can temporarily take control of the opponent's authority by partially seizing it.]

Baedreiga let out a sigh.

Transcendence skill.

It meant having the complete authority of a transcender.

The concept and feeling of this skill were different from those of the soul skill. Taesan had possessed many transcendence skills, but none of them were truly his own. They were all stolen through authority upgrades.

Now, Taesan had finally acquired a transcendence skill that was truly his own.

"Is it not an upgrade, but a seizure?"

Taesan covered up the distorted concept caused by the seizer and recreated it as his own perfect authority.

The basic effect seemed to follow the authority upgrade, but there was an additional part.

"What's the point of being able to seize the opponent's authority and use it temporarily?"

[Hmm... doesn't that mean you can use the opponent's power to some extent?]

"Does that make sense?"

It was hard to understand how you could intervene in the opponent's dominating concept and make part of it your own. It defied common sense.

[But... isn't the authority upgrade itself a ridiculous skill?]

"That's true."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But in reality, I had dealt with something similar to Taesan, so there was nothing to say. Taking away the opponent's authority was also something that couldn't be understood. It was just as incomprehensible as the rest.

"This too, I couldn't sense at all."

There had to be an opponent. One that was equal to or surpassed Taesan. Only then could I properly verify the skill.

One thing I was certain of was that its value and effect had increased more than when my spiritual power rose.

It was incomparable.

This made me curious.

Originally, he should have reached the realm of transcendence.

But due to the intervention of the usurper, the point of arrival was distorted. He obtained the spiritual skill of spiritual ascension.

Then, what was the concept of the world he would have dominated if he had reached the original realm of transcendence?

There were a few possibilities, but I couldn't be certain.

"It's pointless to look for it now anyway."

I had already given up. The distorted point of arrival was recreated by the current him. It was impossible to recover what was lost.

I was just curious. Where had he originally reached?

Taesan cut off his thoughts and continued to verify. As he scrolled down the long system window, he could see the core."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[[Black] has disappeared.] [[Divine] has disappeared.] [[Boundary] has disappeared.]

It wasn't just the vessel that had disappeared.

Black, Divine, and Boundary had all disappeared.

It was a bewildering system window. All three powers were the core cards of Taesan's mountain. And yet, those three skills had vanished.

However, the power felt within Taesan didn't change much.

Taesan raised his arm.

Swirling.

Black rose and wrapped around his arm. Taesan raised his other hand as well. There, a golden Divine light began to shine brightly.

It wasn't that Taesan had lost Divine and Black. Boundary was the same.

Many other skills had disappeared, most of which were related to Boundary or Divine.

It wasn't that they had disappeared, but rather, they had been integrated into one.

And that was exactly the Transcendent [Boundary].

[Transcendent: Boundary] [Proficiency: 100%] [The boundary's line. Something that stands between the world and beyond.]

Most skills that handled Divine, Black, and Boundary had been integrated into Boundary.

Taesan recovered Divine and Black and gave them power.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Smile."

Without any delay, the boundary line naturally unfolded.

"I can even call the boundary line itself now."

The boundary line was a power that could be created by mixing sacred and black energies. Therefore, until now, it had been handled by fusing the two powers in advance and pulling them out.

But it wasn't like that anymore.

Now, he could directly summon the boundary line itself.

That wasn't all.

Taesan snapped his fingers. The boundary line that appeared in the world changed its shape according to its master's will.

Ka-ga-gak!

It was refined and transformed, taking on the shape of a sharp sword.

Taesan snapped his fingers again. The sword turned into a shield, and the shield turned into a bow.

Taesan waved his hand, and the boundary line disappeared.

Now, he could control the boundary line almost perfectly.

Until now, he couldn't do that. Why? Because the boundary line wasn't entirely his. Half of it belonged to the usurper. So, he couldn't handle it properly until now.

But it wasn't like that anymore.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The current boundary line was perfectly his own. He could do many things that he couldn't do before.

For example, when Taesan trampled on the usurper, he used the boundary line to leap through space.

It wasn't just a matter of crossing space, but rather moving through the gaps in the boundary. It was an unstoppable, impossible-to-block movement that couldn't be interrupted.

Not only could he cross space, but many other things became possible.

As his power evolved, many things about the boundary line changed.

Leaving aside control, the sheer quantity and quality were incomparable to before. What was once a small lake was now comparable to an ocean. He no longer had to worry about exhausting his power.

'But.'

There was one problem.

Taesan himself couldn't grasp the limits of the boundary's power.

When he tried to use the boundary line to its fullest extent to stop the usurper, something inside Taesan began to emerge.

It was a beast.

A clear sense of self was felt. It seemed to want to reveal itself to the world, and it let out a joyful, triumphant cry.

Taesan had unconsciously cancelled the manifestation of his power. It had been a long time since he had been this flustered."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"'Can I control it?'

I need to conduct a proper experiment, but at least in the labyrinth, I couldn't experiment.

I need to find a wide, open space where I can conduct many experiments to see if I can control his power.

This was also a power that required careful observation over time.

"It's impossible to verify right now."

Taesan muttered to himself, continuing to verify. He had obtained one more power.

[Transcendence: Physical Strength]

Bardley let out a dry laugh.

[What's with you and having so many powers?]

There were three: Domain Invasion, Boundary, and Physical Strength.

The God of Fall. Essence governed the concept of fall and wielded it as power.

The God of Selection. Maria governed the concept of selection and wielded it as power.

Power was a pinnacle that a transcendent being reached after dedicating their entire life.

It was extremely rare to have multiple, diverse powers. Unless it was an exception like Lakiratas, who governed both struggle and death, it was unlikely.

But Taesan had three: Domain Invasion, Boundary, and Physical Strength."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was no transcendent being who ruled over three realms, as Bardley knew.

"Is it because it's distorted?"

Authority is a kind of destination, a single terminus. Once you reach it, you can't go any further.

However, Taesan reached the distorted realm of spiritual ascension.

As a result, he didn't arrive at the terminus.

In his current life, he could reach a higher position than in his past life.

Exactly how, I don't know, but it wasn't bad. Thanks to that, I was able to obtain multiple authorities.

"Physical power."

It wasn't hard to guess how he obtained it.

A collection of physical powers that could even deal damage to Goshin.

It was like having one authority.

As the wall of spiritual ascension broke down, he obtained an authority that matched what he had achieved.

"Amazing."

This was an authority that was easier to understand compared to spiritual usurpation or boundaries.

A single concept that encompassed struggle, death, choice, and essence.

He had come to dominate the concept of physical power itself, which was the universe's own power. Bardley muttered to himself, recalling this fact once again.

[Transcendent being.]

"I suppose that's possible."
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$The concept itself was something he could have claimed to understand, but he himself couldn't quite be sure. There was something different about it. Tae-san had confirmed the effect of power.
