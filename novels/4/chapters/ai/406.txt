**Chapter 407**

407. 81st Floor, Advanced Magic (6)

The frozen world of darkness was revealed.

A contradictory magic that balances two opposing powers.

Mixed with black, its power and properties changed qualitatively.

It could no longer be called Gerband's magic. Wiraed waved his staff. He placed a white dot in front of him and created hundreds of black dots.

"Let's test its power first."

Thousands of black lines poured out from the hundreds of black dots. The number was so overwhelming that it filled the space, making all previous attacks seem like child's play.

The black lines collided with the frozen world of darkness.

**ZZZZZT!**

The frozen world of darkness, hit by the black lines, did not back down.

Exuding an aura of dark coldness, it advanced, breaking through the black lines and heading towards Wiraed.

**ZZZZT!**

However, as the black lines continued to pour down, its momentum gradually decreased. Eventually, it could not withstand the force and the ice exploded.

**KUUUUUUUNG!**

Fragments of the dark ice and black lines scattered throughout the world.

Wiraed let out a hollow laugh.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's a monstrous power."

Hundreds of black dots were frozen in a single world, and the expectation was that it would become even stronger, but it was beyond imagination.

Wiral created hundreds of black dots again.

Taesan activated the frozen world to respond.

Zzzt!

The result was the same as before. Wiral gazed at the collision of powers with a calm eye.

"Is it the absolute superiority of the attributes?"

The power of the frozen world itself didn't change much.

However, the blackness was a power that existed beyond the laws, a divine power that contaminated the order and laws.

That power mixed with Zelvand's magic.

As a result, the properties of both mixed and created a new power.

It was the absolute superiority in terms of attributes.

That's why it was able to crush and neutralize the overwhelming black lines.

The foundation of his magic was the gathering of pure mana. There was no such thing as a suitable attribute. Yet, being pushed back by the attribute meant that the black magic, which existed in most of the world's powers, had an absolute superiority over the attributes.

Note: There are some terms and concepts that may not have direct translations, so I've tried to convey the meaning as accurately as possible.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What is this thing that has been created?"

It's absurd to combine the black color and magic, the power of the gods and the power of the divine, and mix their properties together. It's something that couldn't even be imagined.

The Great Mountain holds up its arms. The black color and mana are in opposition, but they are in balance.

[You have activated the Starlight Arrow [negation]!]

The Starlight Arrow is realized.

It's not a radiant light like before, but a dark arrow as black as the night.

The arrow rushed towards Wyrda. Wyrda burst forth with a mighty roar and shouted in triumph.

"Ah, this is great!"

He shook his beard and exclaimed.

"This is the optimal power for testing my abilities! Come on!"

Kiying!

The white dots collided with the dark arrow.

Hundreds of black dots froze in opposition to the frozen world. It's impossible to block the Starlight Arrow with just one dot.

However, the white dot did not yield.

Without the slightest tremble, it was blocking the Starlight Arrow.

The Great Mountain glared at the white dot with a scowl.

From the start, I felt that this white dot was unusual.

It's not a powerful force, but rather something that feels like a rule.

Kaang!
Here is the translation of the text:

The white dot, unable to penetrate the starlight arrow's power, disappeared.

Wylad shook his staff. Hundreds of black lines burst forth at once.

Tai Shan used the frozen world to dodge and counterattack.

After neutralizing the black lines, Tai Shan launched another attack on Wylad using the frozen world.

Kaga kaga!

However, the coldness was blocked by a single white dot and failed to reach Wylad.

Tai Shan focused on the white dot and realized something.

"Is this a dimension different from this place?"

Wylad's magic deals with dimensions, points, lines, and surfaces.

When summoning the white dot, he had activated the dimensional rift ability.

It seemed that he had created a separate dimension with the point.

Although he was dealing with blackness, his magic was mixed with the properties of his spells, and he couldn't unleash the full power of pure blackness. Therefore, it seemed that he was unable to penetrate the white dot, which was close to a law.

"It's a bit too simple, isn't it?"

Wylad's magic was indeed powerful, but it lacked something more. It was too ordinary for a divine ability.

This is the true power of Wylad as an immortal.
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan thought calmly and made a decision.

Although the point has absolute defense power, the area it can affect is extremely small. Seeing it disappear soon, it seems to have a short duration.

Then, this time, I'll attack with a long-lasting magic.

[You have activated the Unending Flame of Negation.]

The negation flame has erupted. Instead of a blazing flame, it scattered a thick black dust, polluting everything.

The negation power continued to scatter, pressuring the Wiraad. As Taesan had expected, the Wiraad was unable to freely control the white points, and instead controlled the black points to attack the negation flame.

Kukung!

Taesan's attack was blocked by Wiraad, who shook his staff.

Several white points were born around Taesan.

Taesan reflexively activated the shield of the three protectors. The black-coated shield defended Taesan's body.

At the same time, the white points were connected in a line.

Taesan, who was between the points, was exposed to the attack of the line.

Kagagakaga!
The shield of darkness broke apart in an instant. Taesan hastily twisted his body to dodge.

Wiwald let out a gasp.

"It's momentarily blocked. It's definitely interesting."

Taesan, who had narrowly escaped, furrowed his brow.

The speed of the dark line was fast, but it was not at a level that couldn't be dodged.

However, the white dots that had connected to form a line could not be dodged.

It was not just fast. The dots directly connected to each other without any delay.

Wiwald displayed his power again. White dots disappeared and reappeared around Taesan, causing him to reflexively twist his body to avoid the trajectory between the dots.

Eh!

And the dots connected to form a line.

This attack had definitely confirmed Taesan's victory.

"'The line connecting the dots.'"

After implementing a dimension that Wiwald could perfectly control, Wiwald was connecting white dots. This was because it was under Wiwald's control, and there was no delay or possibility of evading.

"'Stronger.'"

A power that uses a separate dimension, like a force that handles laws and rules.

However, it was not unbeatable.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan dodged the spinning lines and quickly rotated his head.

"It's clear that I've reached my limit."

The king of the mechanical device that Tai Shan had fought before, or the destroyer's power, did not show this level of strength. It was a powerful but rule-bound power. It couldn't even adjust the rules itself, like Wiyu.

Wiyu was clearly handling powers beyond his own abilities.

As soon as Wiyu created a white dot, the power he felt was visibly decreasing. The dimensional breach was a power that surpassed Wiyu's abilities.

"How do you handle such power, I don't know."

Risk was convinced. Then it was possible to attack that part.

After making a decision, Tai Shan manifested his power.

He summoned the black dragon and changed his attack direction randomly with a blink, firing the starlight arrow again.

The black magic was poured out continuously.

And as time passed, the burden on Tai Shan grew heavier and heavier.

Using the power of controlling mana by forcibly pulling up the partial world change to use negative magic itself was a success.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, every time he activated magic, he had to consume a significant amount of spiritual power. Therefore, he couldn't even use supporting skills like magic stacking.

Suddenly, the black color began to run wild, as if it didn't want to follow him anymore.

"Stay still."

Tae-san used an order to force the wild black color to stop.

[You have activated the earthquake spell.]

The ground began to shake. This place was a space created by Jerbrand himself. Although it wasn't destroyed, a wave-like aura covered the area.

Wyard, with a black face, pressed down on the ground's aura.

And in the middle of it, Tae-san wrapped his body in darkness.

[You have activated the transparency spell.]

Tae-san's body was shrouded in darkness. Suddenly, Wyard lost his bearings and couldn't pinpoint Tae-san's location.

Wyard quickly made a judgment and created hundreds of black dots, scattering them in all directions. The dots attempted to devour the space itself and find Tae-san's location.

In that instant, Tae-san cast a shield spell and broke through the black dots, charging forward.

Wyard, who had determined Tae-san's location, immediately created a white dot and drew a line.

Ka ka ka!

The shield that surrounded Tae-san was broken in an instant.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san hastily twisted his body to evade, but he couldn't avoid it perfectly. In an instant, a long and deep scar appeared all over his body.

However, Tae-san held on.

He expanded his field of vision and used his sharp senses to dodge the opponent's attacks without delay.

And when he approached Wiyarad, he released the accumulated power all at once.

The power that had been condensed to the limit, just before it was about to break the balance, was implemented in the world.

[You have activated the frozen world [negative].] [You have activated the starlight arrow [negative].]

A dark aura slowly flowed out and enveloped the world. Magic ran wildly and targeted Wiyarad.

Wiyarad summoned a white point to protect his body.

Kuuuung!

The white point that collided with the power was shaken violently.

Wiyarad's face was stiffened.

The white point was shaking. The dark magic that was barely maintaining the balance with the blackness had undoubtedly immense power that could overturn the laws.

"It's meaningless!"

Kiiing!

The shaking white points connected with each other. As they connected, they expanded and formed a white surface.

The dark magic that had been manifesting its power was absorbed into the white surface.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was as if the negating magic had been consumed by a separate dimension, leaving no resistance or backlash. "Ha, ha, ha!"

Wylland burst out laughing with a pale face. He had fully mobilized the power of the dimension he was handling, and it had swallowed the negating magic without leaving a single particle behind.

It was the first time he had handled the power of the dimension on a unit-by-unit basis. He felt a sense of accomplishment as if he had reached a higher plane.

And then, Tai Shan was standing in front of him.

Wylland's eyes widened.

As he quickly tried to use his magic to block Tai Shan, Tai Shan's hand moved.

[You have activated forced exclusion.]

Kuuuuu!

A powerful, invisible force enveloped Wylland. Wylland tried to hold back with all his might, but his body was pushed back.

"It's not over yet!"

"No. It's over."

Wylland drew his staff, but Tai Shan withdrew his hand.

"What's the point of saying it's over..."

Wylland, unable to understand Tai Shan's words, continued to try to use his magic. However, he suddenly stopped.

He finally realized that he had been pushed outside.

"...Ha."
Here is the translation of the text:

He suddenly remembered the conditions of the test.

Taesan's purpose was not to crush him, but to push him from the original.

He was so focused on the current battle that he forgot about it.

"...What a ridiculous thing."

Wiwald laughed with a sarcastic smile. He had fought with all his might against Taesan, who had been sealed and could only use magic, and had even forgotten his original purpose and fought recklessly.

In contrast, Taesan did not forget what he was supposed to do and calmly countered Wiwald's attacks.

It was a perfect defeat with no excuses.

"There is victory."

A system window appeared with a calm voice.
