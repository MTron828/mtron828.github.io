86. The Ruined World of Halfran (1)

A gray desert. A colorless world of sand where nothing is visible.

Taesan set foot there.

The moment he stepped into the desert, his skin dried up. With each step, the arid ground cracked like a swamp, and the little remaining oxygen decreased even more.

It would have been quite difficult without acquiring resistance. Taesan reduced his breath even further and wrapped his entire body in a robe.

"How much longer?"

Checking the map, he saw that he was halfway there now.

Taesan moved forward slowly.

He couldn't run; he could only move forward while breathing. There were still no signs of any significant movements. So, Taesan, feeling a bit bored, asked the question he had been curious about.

"What's the difference between adventurers and you?"

[Are you talking about contractors?]

"Probably."

NPCs existing within the labyrinth. They seemed to refer to themselves as contractors.

Contractors and adventurers.

Similar yet different.

[Haven't you guessed? It's the difference between the bound and the unbound.]


The ghost spoke.

[Adventurers like you can go outside freely. They have freedom. But contractors cannot do that. They are bound within the labyrinth because they made deals with the magicians.]

Contractors reside within the labyrinth and provide quests and assistance to adventurers.

[It's a kind of contract. I have the opportunity to fulfill my wish, but in return, I'm bound to the labyrinth.]

"A wish?"

[I was killed by the Ogre Sage. I made a contract for revenge. Release made a contract to walk the path of magic. The old man searching for the god made a contract to find his own god.]

Everyone strongly desired something.

"The dwarf who runs the shop probably desires something too. Halfran is no different. He plays the role of a blacksmith in hopes of wishing for something.]

That wish would be here where Taesan was.

"So, these are quests."

[Since I cannot leave the labyrinth myself, I entrust adventurers like you instead.]
If you manage to overcome the pressure of the guide to sin, you will be stronger than Taesan is now, at least. But instead of returning to a world that destroyed itself, I entrusted Taesan with the name of the quest. If that was tied to a contract, then the question is resolved.

"I sort of understand."

The labyrinth is deep and difficult. Each floor you descend, various monsters attempt to kill you, and the gods are incredibly cruel and indifferent.

The adventurers you occasionally meet are also likely to be hostile.

In situations where there is no place to rest, not even allies, it's difficult to endure even if you have a heart of steel.

So it would be good if there were beings who showed kindness without confrontation. If that kindness is connected by mutual understanding and cannot be betrayed, even better.

If there are beings that reward you after passing appropriate trials, they will become a great strength.

That's probably why the magician created the existence called the contractor.

"I don't know if it's mercy or what, but it wasn't a bad story for me, so I accepted it. It's better than just dying as is."

The ghost murmured uncomfortably.

Taesan asked, "What happens to the contractor?"

"It could be anything. The magician came directly to me. If you accept, you become a contractor; if not, you don't."

"Who is that magician?"
The one who created the labyrinth. They received help from the gods to create a space of this magnitude. Perhaps they could have been stronger than transcendent beings.

The ghost, after a moment of silence, spoke.

"I cannot answer."

"Is it a secret?"

"It's similar. You'll naturally come to know as you descend."

Since there was no urgent need to probe further, Taesan didn't press the issue.

Around the middle of the desert, suddenly a wind arose before Taesan.

The wind gradually engulfed the sands, swelling in size until a massive sandstorm formed.

"Is this an attempt to kill me for real?"

Kagagagak!

Taesan tried to dodge, but it was too immense. The sandstorm, the size of a mountain, swiftly swallowed Taesan.

The fierce wind threatened to blow away Taesan's body, while the sands relentlessly battered against Taesan's form.

"You triggered Evade." "You triggered Endure."

Although skills were employed, they were futile. Most triggered skills exerted significant power in a single attack, which meant little against the countless assaults of a sandstorm.

"It's not passing through."

Despite holding out for quite a while, the sandstorm continued to engulf Taesan.
[Since it's only to kill you, there's no need to go anywhere else.]

In the end, Taesan had to either find a way out on his own or dispel the sandstorm. He activated Frost Arrow and shot towards the center of the sandstorm, but nothing appeared.

He swung his sword, but it only struck sand without any other effect.

"I can't kill it."

Although it was a natural phenomenon, he thought it could be alive due to its special circumstances, but it wasn't.

So he had no choice but to escape. Taesan activated a spell.

[You have activated Slow.]

The speed of the sandstorm slowed down a bit.

'The target skill has been applied.'

Crunch.

Taesan stomped his foot.

[You have activated Accelerate.]

Rush against the wind. Accelerate can only be activated if there is a target. This time the target was the sandstorm itself.

Due to Slow, the storm slowed down a bit, and Accelerate boosted the speed, causing the body to rush forward.

He stepped on the ground again.

[You have activated Accelerate.]

The body escaped the sandstorm at a fast speed. The sandstorm tried to chase Taesan belatedly, but Taesan had already escaped from the sandstorm.

"Phew."
Taesan, who had escaped beyond the safe zone, brushed off the sand clinging to his body. The sandstorm seemed unsure of what to do, swaying back and forth.

The distance between Taesan and the pursuing sandstorm had already become too great. The difference in speed was clear; it could have engulfed him when it appeared suddenly in front of him, but now it was too late. The sandstorm, which had hesitated for a moment, made its decision.

"Is it disappearing?"

[If the objective isn't achieved, it means there's no value.]

The power of the sandstorm was slowly fading away. Gradually, the scattered sands swirled here and there, then vanished.

And within that, something entered Taesan.

"Huh?" [Your Evoke Rise has been activated. You have acquired the conceptual skill [???].]

Taesan murmured with surprise at the sudden appearance of the system window.

"What's this?"

* * *

"Why did this activate?"

Evoke Rise. It absorbs the power of the opponent when killing them. That's what was written, and that's how it activated. Therefore, Taesan thought Evoke Rise was a skill that only activated against living opponents.
However, an activation occurred that contradicted his thoughts up to this point.

"Huh?"

The ghost seemed perplexed.

"...The sandstorm was meant to kill you. And it didn't. So, it makes sense that it ended up with you winning... But why the Evoke Rise?"

"Me? Really?"

Taesan was equally bewildered.

"More importantly, what kind of skill is this?"

[Conceptual Skill: ???] [Proficiency: 3%] [???]

It was only labeled as ???. There was no other information available except for the term "Conceptual Skill."

"What exactly is a Conceptual Skill?"

[It's my first time encountering one too.]

If even the deeply knowledgeable ghost didn't know about it, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the majority of adventurers within the labyrinth were also unaware.

The contemplative ghost let out a sigh.

"Could it be...?"

"Anything coming to mind?"

"Well, there is something... But..."

The ghost shook its head.

"I'm not entirely sure yet. I'll tell you once I've sorted it out."
He wasn't sure. It was a sudden event, which startled him, but looking at it calmly, he had easily gained a new skill. It wasn't a bad thing for Taesan.

Taesan continued onward even more. Without any particular issues, he exited the desert and passed through a field, eventually seeing a massive cliff.

Crash.

The cliff collapsed. Fragments started to fall, defying gravity and flying towards Taesan like cannonballs.

"Trying out all sorts of experiences."

Being attacked by falling rocks from a collapsing cliff. It would be a story to tell for a long time.

[You have activated Mental Acceleration.]

Taesan swung his sword with a serious gaze. He deflected and sent flying the incoming boulders, mixing the dance of Muhi and the fangs of wolves adeptly. Despite the entire cliff collapsing and pouring down like rain, he handled it with composure, mental acceleration, and swordsmanship.

He deflected them without much trouble, but there were still too many. His fingertips started to tingle. Taesan frowned and swung his hand.

Crunch.

A single boulder shattered into fragments, lightly grazing his palm and causing a small cut.

It wasn't just a simple boulder. Perhaps due to the will of the world, it even pierced through Taesan's defenses.
While blocking with his tongue, Taesan saw something.

"What's that over there?"

There was an ashen circular aura within the collapsed cliff.

"Huh? What?"

"Over there, on the cliff."

"...I don't see anything?"

It seemed visible only to Taesan.

"Is it because of the skill?"

After the sandstorm disappeared, it could be something seen due to the acquired ??? skill.

After a brief thought, Taesan exerted force with his foot.

[You have activated Acceleration.]

He dashed towards the boulders pouring down like meteors. He swung his sword to deflect them and kicked to push them away. Evading what couldn't be blocked and enduring what couldn't be avoided, he swiftly approached the cliff.

The boulders poured down intensely as if warning him not to come closer, but it was already too late.

Taesan pierced the ashen aura with his sword.

The boulders, driven by will, fell rapidly under the influence of gravity. Simultaneously, the aura was absorbed by Taesan.

"Oh?" [Your Spiritual Enhancement has activated. ??? proficiency has increased by 2%.]

It was certain. The ashen aura had been attacking Taesan.
It was probably something related to the stars. Judging by what the ghost couldn't see, it was likely that the residents of this place hadn't noticed either.

"What in the world is this skill?"

[Concept Skill: ???] [Proficiency: 3%] [Will of ???]

Even though a word had been added, Taesan still didn't understand. He closed the skill window with frustration, and inwardly, the ghost sighed.

"Will... could it be?"

The ghost couldn't see the ashen aura, but had a vague suspicion. The reason Harfran's world had been destroyed was because the star itself had intended to kill the world.

The sandstorm that appeared this time to kill Taesan, and the collapse of the cliff, were extensions of that intention.

It was the will of the star that did not allow living things to exist.

Against such will, Taesan prevailed. In a sense, one could even say he had won. So it was not entirely unreasonable to think that he had taken power from an enemy he had lost to. 

"But...."

The ghost was perplexed.

"Is this power permitted for humans?"
When Taesan learned about the Skill of Spiritual Elevation, he was astonished. His stats increased every time he defeated an opponent. Moreover, if he won against an adventurer, he could even steal their skills.

This wasn't a trivial matter. Skills were something obtained only after much effort and talent. Spiritual Elevation meant he could randomly plunder such skills.

Simply put, if Taesan defeated someone who had learned the Ailac Martial Arts, he could potentially acquire those skills himself.

However, there was a limitation—he had to defeat his enemies to do so. Therefore, the ghost thought of Spiritual Elevation as a skill that killed enemies with either a physical or spiritual presence, plundering what was within them. In that sense, it was clearly a defined skill.

"But... it's more sophisticated than that."

The sandstorm and the collapse of the cliff could be seen as the world itself being destroyed by the will of the stars.

Taesan had triumphed over the will of the world.

Thus, Spiritual Elevation had been plundering the power of the world.

It wasn't just about physically taking something away; it meant plundering on a conceptual level.

Furthermore, if the level of the skill was low, it couldn't plunder anything.

In other words, Spiritual Elevation possessed a rank higher than the will of the stars themselves.
"This isn't so much power granted to mortals."

Rather, it's above.

Granted to transcendent beings...

"Over there?"

[Hm?]

"Is that the destination? At first glance, it seems exactly that."

Taesan looked at the map. A small colorless forest was visible.

The ghost, now alert, replied.

[Yes. I too took roots in a place like that.]

The ghost erased his thoughts. If he had truly reached that level, he wouldn't still be confined to mortal flesh.

"Still, could it be just one level below that? Now I'm more curious about the past."

While the ghost pondered alone, Taesan ventured into the forest. Colorless trees rustled ominously as he moved deeper, paying them no heed.

"Is that it?"

About halfway in, there stood a massive tree. It was so enormous that it hardly seemed like a tree at all.

Oddly, the roots of the tree were protruding outward, irregularly sprawling.

It was immediately apparent.

Those were the roots of Spiritual Elevation.
