**Chapter 531**

531. 95th Floor. Essence (5)

A massive scar was etched into the landscape. The plunderer who had flown far away couldn't get up.

"As expected."

The fact that the boundary line could be destroyed in this way meant that it was impossible to stop it with any universal concept or the power of the gods.

Of course, if one were to prepare a countermeasure against simple physical strength, it might be possible, but in general, it was an absolute card that couldn't be stopped.

Taesan nodded in satisfaction.

The massive physical strength shook the landscape. The aftermath swept away the pollution that had covered the landscape.

But that was all.

The pollution of the landscape was slowly returning to its original state.

Beyond that, the plunderer was seen struggling to get up.

It couldn't get up properly.

It had taken significant damage and stumbled several times, but eventually got up and flew towards Taesan again.

"I guess so."

Taesan calmly accepted the fact.

Physical strength was undoubtedly powerful.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If I were to confront him directly, I could deal a proper blow, even if he's a transcendent or a high-ranking noble.

But the opponent in front of me is himself.

His attacks are difficult to defend against because they are tainted by the source of corruption, which is rooted in his own mind. Physical strength is a separate power from spiritual strength, but ultimately, it's the same power he possesses.

The physical strength card I had was already used up. The boundary line is meaningless.

In reality, the chances of winning were close to zero.

'What can I do?'

But Taesan didn't show any particular excitement. The usurper raised his hand, and the boundary line rose again, trying to engulf Taesan.

Damn it.

Taesan stomped his foot.

He quickly moved his mind and began to dodge the usurper's attacks at high speed.

Why couldn't he defeat the usurper?

The reason was simple. It was because the usurper had already perfectly merged with his mind.

He tainted everything, making it return to normal, and eventually made it his own.

It was a kind of cancer cell.

I should have removed it early on, but I didn't realize it until it had spread to the entire mind. Now that it's already taken root, it's impossible to deal with it."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan thought of a method.

How could he defeat the usurper?

While avoiding attacks, he found dozens of answers in an instant.

But as a result, the answer was that there was no answer.

There was no way to undo the fundamental corruption that had been built up from the beginning. Moreover, even the boundaries were being stolen away right now.

So what should he do?

Taesan came to a conclusion.

"Let's just go with simplicity."

Taesan stopped moving, as if he had given up. The usurper laughed alone, thinking that Taesan had surrendered.

[You are me. You are mine.]

"Cut the nonsense."

This way, he couldn't win.

So Taesan decided to keep it simple.

Taesan closed his eyes. The usurper, who had been charging at him with joy, stopped in his tracks.

[…….]

For the first time, the usurper's face stiffened.

The connection with Taesan began to fade away. Everything he had built up lost its meaning and crumbled away.

[You.]

Kuuuuuuuuuuuung!

The connection collapsed quietly, but clearly.

[Uh, just a moment.] [Master?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

With anxious minds, Bardley and Akasha were shocked.

Right now, Taesan was abandoning what he had built up.

"[Master? This is.]"

"It's not that I'm abandoning everything. I'm abandoning what my past self built up."

How did the usurper grow and become stronger within him, corrupting his mind?

It was because Taesan had reached a great height in his past life.

The usurper, attached to that height, tainted it and slowly gained power. In the end, it was thanks to the height his past self had reached that the usurper, originally meaningless, could become so strong.

So, he's abandoning it.

Kukuku...

The sound of collapse echoes quietly.

A vast world is crumbling.

"I don't feel good about this."

He had spent an extremely long time in easy mode.

It was a period of time so long that it couldn't be compared to his current life, a time that was literally mind-numbing. During that time, Taesan had built up many things and reached great heights. Unbeknownst to him, his level had reached an extremely high place.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Maybe I've reached the realm of transcendence, with a distorted power.

My spiritual energy is rising.

I was about to cut it off with my own hands right now.

I felt a huge sense of loss. A huge hole was pierced in my mind.

[Don't laugh.]

The thief let out a short laugh and charged at me. Gang Tae-san smiled and drew his sword.

Ka-a-a-ang!

I blocked the attack and created some distance, then cast a spell. A massive explosion headed towards the thief.

I dodged the attack and muttered to myself.

"Is it really that urgent?"

The reason the thief could stick to me was because of the spiritual energy rise. If I cut it off, even the thief wouldn't be able to intervene with me anymore.

The boundary line that wrapped around the thief's entire body began to lose its power, like a machine that had run out of energy, coming to a stop.

Kki-kki-kki-kkik!

I laughed and swung my sword. The thief was pushed back for the first time, accompanied by a crashing sound.

[Don't laugh.]

The thief's voice was stiff and rigid.

[You can't abandon it. It's your foundation.]

"What. It's not wrong. That's usually the case, anyway."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Reaching the peak of spiritual power was a kind of milestone for Taesan.

It was everything he had built up in his past life.

Even if it was on par with the concept governed by the Transcenders themselves, it was still insignificant.

There were many who would rather choose death or self-obliteration than give it up. The concept was something that the Transcender had devoted their entire life to, and it was more precious than their own life.

"So, what's the point?"

But Taesan didn't have any particular emotions about it.

Reaching the peak of spiritual power was everything he had built up in his past life. It was a lofty and powerful realm.

The power to plunder and steal numerous abilities was the strongest card that had made the current Taesan who he was.

So, what's the point?

"I've already given up everything and come here."

When he turned back time, he lost all the skills he had acquired.

Multiplication, addition, copying. The initial skills he couldn't acquire now were reset, and it was his last chance.

He couldn't even be sure if he could reacquire those skills himself. In fact, there were many skills he had already given up on acquiring.

But Taesan didn't find it that sad.

Because, in the end, it was just a card."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's the same with the surge of spiritual power. The surge of spiritual power is just one of the cards he has.

Everything he has is possible because he is Gang Tae-san.

In the end, what's important is Gang Tae-san himself. He is the main one. Other powers can never be the main ones.

He is complete in himself.

What's important is himself.

That's his unwavering faith.

Kuuuuuuuuung!

His mental state collapses.

The greatest thing he had built up crumbles to nothing.

[The Soul Skill [Surge of Spiritual Power] disappears.]

His mind becomes empty. It's a feeling of emptiness at the root. Even at the highest level, he feels an unbearable sense of despair and powerlessness.

"This is ridiculous."

The feeling of abandoning oneself is not something anyone can experience.

Kukukukuku….

His mental state transforms into a vast plain. The usurper looks at Tae-san with a stiff, hardened face.

[…You.]

"How do you feel?"

Tae-san said calmly. The power he felt from the usurper was endlessly falling. Even if he tried to draw a boundary, the limit was clear now. The usurper was enraged."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You dare to destroy the precious fruit that I've cultivated.]

"It's mine. It's not yours."

[So, what are you going to do about it.]

The usurper roughly spreads out their hand. The blackness gathers and swirls.

[Nothing has changed.]

"It's not like that right now."

If there's a problem, then it's the same for Taesan as well.

In the end, he himself destroyed the greatest thing he had built with his own hands. He was now in a state of infinite weakness.

And the corruption was not completely resolved.

He had only cut off the main part, but his mind was still tainted by the usurper. Except for the fact that they had both become infinitely weak, nothing had changed.

So Taesan thought of filling the void anew.

"The ascension of my spirit is the realm I reached in my past life."

Originally, he was supposed to reach the realm of transcendence, but it was distorted and twisted by the usurper, becoming something new.

It was never truly his to begin with.

"So."

He fills his mind with his true self once again.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Throwing away what I built up in my past life, I've reached a high level of accomplishment in this life, filling my heart once again. This is something that only I can possess, something that impostors cannot intervene with.

"I should have done this from the start."

Taesan muttered to himself, holding something in his hand. It was something that couldn't be identified by its shape, but anyone could tell what it was.

That was Taesan, himself.

[You have activated your true self.]

The Essential has finally been activated. The existence that is only Taesan, untainted by the impostor, begins to cover his heart.

[You!]

The impostor screams.

A massive, dark, and ashen color rises.

But it's meaningless. The fundamental spirit that was supposed to rise has already been destroyed. What's left is only a remnant.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

He spews out his true self.

The heart that was tainted by the impostor, but had no control over, is now covered by Taesan himself.

And he adds what he has to it.

[You have activated a part of evil.]

The collection of all evil that has existed since the beginning of time, remaining in the world, sweeps through his heart. Following the complete control of Taesan, his heart is covered.

[You have activated a shining fragment of dark darkness.]

Please let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And the realm of Baal is added. The space itself becomes distorted, and it follows the control of Taesan.

Ku ku ku ku palace!

The usurper tried to intervene hastily. He tried to dominate with his powerful aura and presence.

But it's impossible.

[This is.]

He was Gang Taesan.

The ascension of the spirit is Taesan's limit. Since it's distorted and broken because of him, everything related to Taesan is affected by him.

He is Gang Taesan, and Gang Taesan is him.

But it's not the case now.

Gang Taesan, as an existence, can no longer be intervened by the usurper. The pollution he tainted has covered Gang Taesan, and he can no longer exert his influence.

[You are! Mine! I am you!]

"You are not me."

Taesan denies it briefly.

He is himself. Even if the usurper intervened and polluted him, he remains alone and untainted.

He reveals his current self, not his past life.

His body, mind, and spirit are in harmony.

It's not about reaching a new level.

The ascension of the spirit, which was blocked by a wall and couldn't be reached, has finally stepped into the realm that his current self, not his past self, has reached.

[You have activated forced arrival.]

With everything you possess, you cover your entire mental landscape without leaving a single thing out.

Ka-ga-ga-ga-k!

In the process of unleashing from the depths of Taesan's mind, the experiences and emotions of his current life flash by.

It's a massive collection. Even an ordinary person would be overwhelmed and collapse just by tasting a fragment of it. The density and quantity are so immense that even a transcender would find it difficult to handle. It's as if experiencing and feeling the transcendent realm is a kind of mental attack.

But Taesan didn't feel any burden.

The distorted form that had collapsed is restored, and a new appearance is created. The mental landscape itself is newly constructed.

That appearance was clearly distorted and broken, but Taesan's energy was definitely palpable.

And Taesan has arrived.

In his own complete and perfect place.
