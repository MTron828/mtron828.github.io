Chapter 231

231. 52nd Floor (2)

"What's up?"

Taihan waved his hand.

Minerva gazed blankly at Taihan.

"Ah, ah, ah?"

She looked around. A small space made of bricks. And the immense power felt within it.

"Taihan?"

"I've met you again."

Taihan nodded his head. Minerva's face was filled with more confusion.

"Can't I be summoned by you?"

She had to protect Arulia. That's why she made a contract with Taihan, excluding the part about summoning. When Taihan summoned Minerva, the skill that activated was confirmed.

[SPECIAL PERMANENT ACTIVATION SKILL: Proxy of the Contract] [It serves as a proxy for the contract with the Lord of the Spirits, substituting for the power that arises from it.]

It seemed that this skill was used by Beatrice to take on the power used by Minerva to get here.

Minerva's face fell as she realized the situation belatedly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"...I understand what happened. My father helped me like this..."

Her voice was filled with emotion.

"Ah, I thought I'd never see you again. It's nice to meet you again."

Minerva smiled and approached Taesan.

Taesan widened his arms, and Minerva did the same.

"What's going on? Why are you distancing yourself?"

"It didn't matter back then, but it's a bit awkward now."

The previous Minerva was like a child, but now she was a mature woman, so she didn't know how to comfort her like before.

Minerva's face turned red. Although she had become a complete angel king, she didn't seem to have grown up mentally.

Taesan stroked her hair, and she burst into a silly laughter.

"It's good."

[Your Majesty.]

"Ah, Barkazza. How are you? The ghost is also well?"

[Well. The contract with the angel king. And the summoning of the angel king. It's going to be fun to see the appearance of the deep-dwelling demons.]

The ghost chuckled.

Minerva finally realized where she had been summoned.

"This is the labyrinth, right?"

"It is."

"Hoo."
Here is the translation:

She scanned her surroundings with a spark of interest in her eyes. After sensing a fleeting power, she let out a sigh of admiration.

"It's impressive. I can't help but feel it too."

She was the guardian of the world. In any sense, there was no one stronger than her in the entire universe.

However, in the labyrinth, she felt that there were many forces comparable to or even stronger than hers. This fact piqued Minerva's interest.

"Are there also divine beings?"

"There are."

The Lord of Evil Spirits.

She was the enemy of Mount Tai. Minerva, who had faced the same Lord of Evil Spirits, found it hard to predict her reaction.

Would she show enmity as a rogue, or would she not be able to fight as a comrade-in-arms, leaving her in disarray?

Minerva seemed to have grasped the intentions of Mount Tai and smiled mischievously.

"Don't worry. I've made a contract with you. No matter who the opponent is, I'm on your side. Ah, except for my father."

"That's fortunate."

There didn't seem to be a problem when fighting the Lord of Evil Spirits.

The situation was fully understood.

Then, it was time to get to the main point.

"How much power can we use?"

"Hmm..."
Here is the translation of the text:

Minerva raised her hand with a sigh. The wind gathered there. The massive wind began to take shape and materialize.

Minerva clenched her fist.

The wind exploded and struck the abyss. The hair on the Peak of Tai Shan was violently shaken.

"...The true power of the original is not enough. Is it even worthy of being the highest level among the top-level spirits?"

[This guy can't even muster the power to make a contract with a spirit king, so it's only natural. But is it really the highest level among the top-level spirits?]

The ghost spoke in a voice mixed with admiration.

[Minerva and Barkazza. Even just the two of them could break through the abyss.]

"What about the limitations of summoned time?"

"The power consumed when summoned by my father will be compensated. Once all the power is consumed, it feels like a reverse summon. Conversely, if you just adjust the power, you can stay indefinitely."

"It's fine."

Tai Shan nodded his head. It was not a bad condition.

As he became stronger, his power would gradually approach that of the Spirit King. Beatrice gave him a reward that would make him satisfied.

"It seems like I don't need anything right now."

"It's only for now."
Here is the translation of the text:

"If so, I'll leave. I have a lot to do for a while, so I'm a bit busy."

Minerva was just born. There must be a lot to do in Ariuria.

"Yeah."

"Hi, Tai Shan. See you later."

Minerva smiled and waved her hand.

The Wind King disappeared into the distance.

Barcaga let out a sigh.

[I'm fine with being together, but this can't be a breach of my contract, can it.]

"There won't be such an occasion."

Barcaga had a lot to do as usual.

And it's not over yet.

[Title: One who governs nature]
[A being recognized by Beatrice, the spirit of nature. All spirits recognize your existence and affirm it. You can also exert a profound influence on nature.]
[All damage to spirits + 30%]

There were three skills that could influence nature. This overlap allowed me to control the weather.

My damage also increased by 10%. It's not a bad change.
Here is the translation:

[Special Constant Activation Skill: Mysterious Energy] [Proficiency: 58%] [Unwavering spirit, unchanging will, unbroken mind, eternal struggle.]

And then, the Mysterious Energy surged to an incredible level after overcoming the high-level challenge of the gods.

Although some additional sentences were added, it didn't feel like a significant change. It was as if the original power was finally being utilized and added to the content.

[Special Constant Activation Skill: Twisted Spirit Alignment] [Proficiency: 42%] [Twisted beings can manipulate their own spirits. By carrying a suitable burden, they can control their own spirits or the spirits of others, and even adjust those within a certain range.]

The Twisted Spirit Alignment also underwent a significant change, surpassing 40%.

The first change was a reduction in burden. Additionally, it became possible to control not just one's own spirit, but also the spirit of others within a certain range.

"Is it for attack or defense?"

When an attack infused with spirit is launched, it is possible to twist that spirit slightly, as if to dissipate it. It had a sense of explanation, a feeling, and such a meaning.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was a significant change. Now, the enemies who couldn't be defeated by him are all high-level enemies, and if he loses his spiritual energy, it's the same as losing his attack. And finally, the change of the spirit.

[A spirit seeking revenge has taken residence. Attack power + 80, attack power + 30% against the spirit, and attack power + 60% against the spirit king. The spirit king can activate the skills "Abandoned Knife" and "Wrath of the Blessed One".]

Attack power increased by 50.

Additionally, attack power against the spirit increased by 10%, and against the spirit king by 20%.

And the skill "Wrath of the Blessed One" has also been born.

Overall, it was a change aimed at killing only one spirit king.

I'm looking forward to the time when I meet the evil spirit king.

The proficiency of the concept skill has also increased, but there was no significant change. It seemed to be entering a state of excess.

"So then."

This was the last one.

The most anticipated and anxious skill remained.

[Transcendence: Black] [Proficiency: 1%] [Consumption ???: ???] [?#$@!! #$!!@# @#@!]

"This is what?"

A skill obtained by blocking the path of the high-spirited.

The power of the high-spirited has entered him through the rise in spiritual energy.
Here is the translation of the text:

Consumable things were also unknown, and their contents were not written either.

In fact, it was a mysterious skill.

A ghostly sound was emitted.

[Honestly, it's quite ominous, isn't it? Leaving it alone might be okay, but I don't think you'd make that choice.]

It's a new card I've obtained for the first time. There was no option to leave it behind.

One must try before becoming a corpse or a meal.

Tae-san activated his skill.

[You have activated the black.]

Tae-san's shadow was trembling.

The moving shadow had a will and slowly advanced.

[Master?] [What?]

The ghost was shocked.

The power felt from the trembling shadow was a power he had experienced.

A shadow that devours everything and erodes it.

That was similar to the power handled by the High God and the demon, Haskar.

"Um."

Tae-san slightly furrowed his brow. An unpleasant sensation was slowly invading his brain. It was a feeling of mental pollution caused by using it.

Tae-san extinguished the shadow. The erosion that had pierced his head slowed down.

"It's possible to use it, but it will be difficult, I think."
Here is the translation of the text:

The erosion itself can be suppressed, but it's difficult to use in a fierce battle where a slight difference can decide victory or defeat, and it's a skill that can be as sharp as a double-edged sword depending on the efficiency of the shadow.

[This is......]

And the ghost was still unable to regain its composure.

That shadow was directly granted power by the high god. To be precise, it was the power of the high god itself.

The Mountain God, who didn't make a contract, possessed it.

The ghost was about to say something when the labyrinth twisted.

Kuku kuku kuku!

The bricks shook. The floor rose, and the power gathered.

[I don't know how I got here.]

The devil's figure appeared, revealing its hostility. Ferocious anger was poured onto the Mountain God.

The Baraka quickly unfolded the barrier, but it broke apart instantly, causing unimaginable damage. It was beyond endurance.

[How dare the high god's arrogance set foot here. I'll make you regret that arrogance......]

The power-gathering devil paused when it saw the Mountain God.

[......You.]

"Hello?"

The Mountain God waved its hand.

The devil, which had been silent for a moment, opened its mouth.

[The power of the high god was felt here.]

"This?"

[You have activated the black.]

Note: There are some fantasy terms and concepts in the text, such as "고신" (high god), "태산" (Mountain God), "발바밤바" (devil), and "바르카자" (Baraka), which may not have direct translations.
Here is the translation of the text:

The shadow trembled. It was clear that the mighty Taesan was wielding the power of the high god, and Babelba's words were lost.

[Didn't you make a direct contract with the high god?]

"What, are you kidding? Why would I make a contract with such things?"

[That's right... just wait for a moment.]

Babelba's aura expanded.

[As the administrator of the labyrinth, I order you: reveal yourself.]

His gaze fell upon Taesan.

[This is it.]

And a sigh escaped.

[This... is amazing.]

"I'm also bewildered."

Taesan drew out his sword. Although I don't know the details, the black power wielded by Taesan seemed to evoke hostility from Babelba.

Babelba shook his head.

"Don't worry, I've got it under control. I've grasped the situation, and I know what to do."

"That's good news."

[You've just used the power of the high gods. That's why I thought their influence had arrived. It's confusing.]

Babelba's aura dissipated. The labyrinth began to return to its original form.

[It's a very strange thing, but since no contract was made, I won't think about it. Let's just continue to descend into the labyrinth.]

The last faint voice of the disappearing Babelba whispered away.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Was this what the wizard desired?]

His existence had completely disappeared.

[What a big deal almost happened.] [I can't handle this kind of existence. Are there such existences scattered throughout the labyrinth?]

A ghost spoke up. Barkazar was astonished.

[I'll be careful when using this, but I don't recommend using it at all, personally.]

Balvabamba showed malice towards Taesan. It's likely that the gods would have a similar reaction.

"'What Beatrix said was this.'"

I won't intervene, but there will be those who don't like it.

Taesan obtained the black color, which was what he was talking about.

This was the power of a high-souled being. It was not an indirect power like a twisted spirit adjustment, but the power that a high-souled being possesses.

Of course, the existence of this world would not like it.

Taesan had planned to seal the black color unless it was really necessary. Because the gods are self-centered, the possibility of Taesan killing them with just his own power also existed.

All verification is complete.

Now it's time to head back down to the labyrinth again.
The mountain god advanced. Baraka seemed to be slightly excited and followed him.

[A transparent snake appeared.]

"Baraka."

Ah!

Baraka clapped his hands.

Light rose and swept across all directions. The transparent snake hastily moved to avoid it, but was engulfed by the light and disappeared.

[This guy has become stronger. With this level of strength, I can handle 60 floors by myself.] [It's the king's blessing. Well, I can sense the presence of a transparent snake. And it seems to possess a power equivalent to a high-ranking spirit. What a fascinating existence! Very fascinating.]

A deep sense of joy was palpable in Baraka's voice.

Baraka was extremely delighted and challenged himself to battle. Thanks to this, the mountain god did nothing and was able to break through to the 52nd floor.

After breaking through the secret room, they arrived at the boss. The 52nd floor boss was a transparent scorpion.

[Hmm.]

Kukukuk!

The light wavered. The scorpion, being the boss, did not easily succumb. It swung its claws, distorting the light and charging towards Baraka.

[Ha ha ha!]

Baraka let out a loud laugh.

The mountain god did not intervene.
Here is the translation of the text:

Victory was naturally Barkaza. However, it was not an easy fight, and it took some time.

[It's interesting.]

Barkaza laughed. His voice was the most energetic among the voices Taesan had heard so far.

[It was the right decision to follow the master. Who would have thought such a place existed.]

"Satisfied, I suppose. Then, it's settled."

Taesan checked the rewards.

First, the leaves obtained from the secret room, which had the power to strengthen the arm guard that had absorbed the red thorns of the cursed rose and the green roots of the cursed vines. The arm guard was born from the whims of a witch and still had hidden powers. It had absorbed the leaves, and it now had an increased attack power of 125 and a defense power of 10.

The attack power increased by 50, and it was now over 2,000.

[The transparent charm] [Defense power +100] [A magic charm used by an invisible mage, which makes the wearer invisible. As long as the wearer does not attack or collide with something, the invisibility will not be dispelled.]

"Wow?"
Here is the translation:

Equipped, it can achieve permanent stealth.

It was a good equipment. As for the enemies that Tai Shan is facing, they are only people who can see through stealth even with their eyes closed, so it's not necessary for him, but it may be of help in various quests.

"I'll definitely need to keep it with me."

And a secret reward.

[You used ???.] [You got the shoes that can jump to the end of the world.] [The shoes that can jump to the end of the world. Whether it's true or not, no one knows.] [You can jump farther.] [You can suddenly move a very short distance. This effect can only be used once a day.]]

"Is it Blink?"

It was quite good. Unlike random Blink, he could jump to any place he wanted.

The shoes he was wearing also had the effect of releasing a status abnormality once a day, which was quite good, but it was worth replacing.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

After replacing all the equipment, Tai Shan went down to the 53rd floor.

"I need to hurry down."

A lot of time had passed since his return to the last planet. According to Tai Shan's memory, there was not much time left.

The time had come for the things he had accumulated to bear fruit.

It was almost time. He had thought about getting as much as possible before that.

"There's a lot to do."

Tai Shan muttered to himself as he went down the stairs.
