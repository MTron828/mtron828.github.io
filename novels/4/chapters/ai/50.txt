Episode 51

51. 9th Floor, Hop Goblin (1)

[Marnius's Rune] [Grants attributes to weapons with a probability.]

As before, it was a concise explanation. It was also a rune that could overlap with the inscriptions' scrolls and be useful for other purposes.

With this in mind, there was something I was curious about.

"Is Marnius also a god?"

He was a being who put his name into an item. Previously, I hadn't been particularly interested in gods, but seeing many gods here changed my perspective.

"Not a god, but a transcendent being."

"What's the difference?"

"There isn't a huge difference. Whether one governs a domain or desired it themselves. That's about the extent of it."

It seemed there was no intention to explain further.

"Just know that such beings exist. Not all of them are involved with the labyrinth. If you try to learn about each one, I'd have to spend days explaining."

"Is that so."

There seemed to be more transcendent beings than I had thought.
Taesan placed Marnius's rune into his inventory. It was almost time to discard Rakiratas's weapon. He had been using it from the 2nd floor all the way up to the 9th, so it had been a long time. He planned to use a new weapon once he obtained one.

And then, a random reward.

"You even get skills as random rewards?"

He didn't know. He had never received one in Easy Mode. Since Itaeyeon rarely received secret rewards, she didn't know either.

First, he checked the effect.

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Touch of Exploitation] [Proficiency: 1%] [Absorbs a certain percentage of health every time damage is dealt to an enemy.]

"Seems useful for prolonged battles."

It was also a skill type that Taesan had never seen before. He would need to find out what percentage it was, but as it was a secret reward, its value would likely not be insignificant.

Taesan descended to the 9th floor. This time, he did not encounter Relise. Since Markanda used its beak as a weapon, it did not drop any particular items. It was all crafting materials.

[9th Floor Quest Initiated.] [Defeat the boss of the 9th floor and pass through.] [Reward: Boots of Swiftness] [Secret Reward: ???]

The dwarf greeted him.

"You've come. Already on the 9th floor? It won't be long now."

"That's right."
In several ways, it's soon in various senses. The ghost quietly closed its mouth.

"I won't survive this time either. Hurry up and go down. I don't want to see that tedious face."

"There's something I need to say before that."

It was uncertain what kind of reaction would be shown, but confirmation was necessary nonetheless. The dwarf chuckled.

"What is it? You're not planning to stick with me until that guy kicks the bucket, are you?"

"No. I'll probably be out for a while."

"Out?"

The dwarf's pupils dilated.

"From here?"

"Yes."

"What do you mean?"

Even the ghost, who had been silent, asked in surprise.

"You're going out of the labyrinth?"

"It's not that I want to go out. I'm being forced out."

"...Is that even possible?"

The dwarf scratched his chin with a puzzled expression.

"From what I'm hearing, it sounds like something's intervening... but nothing specific comes to mind."

"Do you not know?"

"I'm completely clueless about external affairs while tied up here. Of course, the god of this place wouldn't do such a crazy thing..."

The dwarf also seemed unaware of the entity that had summoned Taesan here.

'Isn't it a god?'
The pondering dwarf asked,

"How long will it take?"

"Well..."

Taesan couldn't give a definite answer either. Depending on how things unfolded, it could either finish quickly or take some time.

"It seems like it'll take roughly a month or two."

"It won't take that long. I'm not sure what it is exactly, but even if you don't want to go, it seems like it's not impossible to avoid. Have a safe journey."

The dwarf said plainly. Taesan nodded and headed towards the 9th floor.

The ghost, belatedly coming to his senses, began to inquire.

"Where are you going?"

"Outside."

"Outside? Outside of the labyrinth? Where that broken fellow guards? What's out there?"

"Not there, truly outside."

"Huh?"

The ghost was bewildered.

"What do you mean by 'outside'?"

Taesan didn't answer. He would find out soon enough anyway.

He looked at the ghost.

A presence that disappears upon clearing the 10th floor. A being bound by the quest.

In other words, as long as the quest remains, always by his side.

"Why send it away like that?"

"Not like that."
I averted my gaze. It's still a possibility. There was no need to say how the labyrinth would respond.

Taesan moved across the room. Monsters from the 9th floor appeared.

"Kyaak!"

[A hob goblin wielding a spear has appeared.] [A hob goblin holding a shield has appeared.] [A hob goblin with a bow has appeared.]

It was the same setup as the 2nd floor. The difference was that the goblins had evolved into hob goblins.

"They're stronger than lizardmen?"

Hob goblins were a superior species of goblin, but in terms of strength, they were below lizardmen considering the strength of their species.

Taesan soon understood the reason.

"Kieeek!"

The hob goblins swung their weapons. It was not the movement of someone who had trained for just a day or two; it was restrained and precise.

"Huh."

Taesan parried with his sword and stepped back. The goblins coordinated and rushed in.

"This is interesting."

No matter how much they trained, the difference in basic stats was significant, and Taesan himself was now learning swordsmanship. There was no problem with his opponents.

What surprised him was that the hob goblins were stronger than he had thought.

"Is this kind of reinforcement possible?"
The strength of the monsters did not differ between modes. The goblins encountered here were at the same level as those encountered in the easy mode, and the same was true for lizardmen and orcs.

Although the orc warriors were different, they were exceptions as they had been strengthened by the trials of the gods.

Taesan had encountered hob goblins even in easy mode, but now they were noticeably stronger than those he had faced before.

The ghost replied,

"[There are limits, but you can train to a certain extent. Of course, someone has to teach you, but you already know that, don't you?]"

In other words, there were named monsters on the 9th floor. Named monsters existed.

Taesan lowered his hand. The hob goblins attacked Taesan.

As his shield was completely worn down and his health started to deplete, Taesan moved his sword.

*Slash.*

"Kack!"

The hob goblin trying to block Taesan's sword was crushed along with his shield.

Touch of Plunder.

Recovers a certain percentage of the damage.

The shield was deliberately struck, not an HP judgment. When Taesan confirmed it, 3 HP were recovered.

"It's about 5% in ratio."

Now that he had just acquired it, it was 5% in basic proficiency. If proficiency was steadily improved, it would become quite useful. It was a skill that could gain an advantageous position in continuous fights.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"It's good that it activates automatically. It means it triggers without needing attention. Each of these things accumulated to create significant variables.

Taesan quickly cleared up and began breaking through the labyrinth. In the next room, four hob goblins were waiting, but Taesan took care of them all in less than a minute.

Taesan defeated adventurers from the 20th floor. The monsters on the 9th floor were no longer worthy opponents. He continued to clear each room without stopping.

He searches for the secret room. The effect of penetration activates and he quickly finds it. As always, he disarms traps and receives rewards.

[Thick Shield] [Defense +15] [Solely for defense. Seems useless alone.]

Defense was his top priority.

The drawback was that it was a two-handed shield.

As described, it wasn't very useful alone.

Taesan had an increase in spirit, which made it somewhat usable, but defense wasn't currently the most important thing.

The problem was that his attack power was too low compared to his stats.

At the end of his journey, he soon encountered the boss.

"Kack!"

[Chief Hob Goblin appeared.]
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"This chief simultaneously used both magic and a sword. Swinging both his staff and sword, he attacked Taesan with spells and sword strikes.

Taesan approached calmly, like a mountain breeze.

[You activated the Robe of Darkness.]

In an instant, his body disappeared. The chief hesitated. Taesan thrusts his sword into the chief's neck.

"Kack, Kyaak."

Suppressing his resistance, he thrusts the sword in. Before long, the chief fell.

[You have defeated Chief Hob Goblin.] [Your level has increased.] [You are now in peak condition.] [As a reward for leveling up, your health has increased by 60.] [Your strength permanently increases by 12. Your agility permanently increases by 15. Your mana permanently increases by 8.] [You obtained the Faded Staff.]

He immediately checks it.

[Faded Staff] [Magic +5] [A staff of faded magic, now only a shadow of its former value.]

It's not better than the Chill Staff he currently possesses. Still, it's better than mediocre equipment considering it's a tribute.

"Pretty quick."

"Shouldn't be careless."

Now, it's the 10th floor.

However, instead of descending, Taesan surveyed the boss room."
Before long, he was able to discover a strange pattern forming a single decoration.

Taesan pressed the decoration.

*Click.*

As the wall receded, a path was revealed.

"Of course it's here."

Taesan stepped inside. It was the pattern reminiscent of Goblin Road. Just like back then, the interior was lavishly decorated.

"An adventurer."

And at the end, there sat a goblin on a throne.

[You have encountered Goblin Lord, Route-Ra.]

Unlike the usual encounters, there was no name change.

It truly meant Goblin Lord.

The lord looking at him opens his mouth.

"Have you met Hagae-Ha?"

Taesan nodded. Route-Ra smiled.

"Satisfying to face a warrior like yourself."

Route-Ra stands up. He points his spear towards Taesan. Taesan casually lifted his sword.

Currently, Taesan is at the level of a 20th floor adventurer. No matter how high the lord's name may be, the odds are clear. Route-Ra seemed to sense that too, smiling wryly.

He grasps his spear with a life-or-death grip.

"I knew the day would come eventually, but it feels peculiar."

"You must have defeated Hagae-Ha."
Sure. Here's the translation of the text:

"Yeah. I won in a fair fight and took the seat of the lord. It was a fight for my life."

"Why did you do that?"

From his words, it seemed he was fully aware of himself. He was a monster, destined to fall to adventurers.

Route-Ra replied nonchalantly.

"If I was destined to die anyway, wouldn't it be better to leave some kind of result behind? Dying as a lord is more dignified than just another goblin among many."

"Is it greed?"

He challenged Hagae-Ha to battle for a more glorious death.

In Easy Mode, monsters were creatures driven purely by instinct, hardly possessing intellect.

But even those called monsters here lived according to their own values and beliefs.

NPCs came here for their own hopes.

Then what were monsters here for?

"Let's fight, warrior."

The lord raised his spear and charged.

Fast and strong. Even on the 20th floor, Taesan hadn't seen movements like these. It wasn't just skills; in pure movement alone, he surpassed anyone Taesan had seen.

Taesan moved both hands.

The sound of wind tearing echoed.

Kaaang!
Here's the translation of the text:

The goblin's arm is pinned down. Taesan swings forcefully, pushing aggressively.

"Hmm."

The lord grimaces and presses the ground with a determined face. Desperately lowering his stance, he thrusts his spear towards Taesan.

[Route-Ra has activated Strong Attack.] [Your first attack is completely nullified.]

The attack is erased.

Taesan retaliates. The lord skillfully activates his skill with a resolute face.

[Route-Ra has activated Feint.] [You have activated Strong Attack.]

The bending sword corrects its course. Route-Ra blocks it with gritted teeth. The spear shakes violently.

"Well, this is... nothing much to do."

Route-Ra chuckles bitterly.

"Even skills won't work, movement is constrained. Can't even gain the upper hand in swordsmanship. Didn't expect to be pushed this far by an adventurer on this floor."

Route-Ra is strong.

Ordinary players would barely have the strength to compete by the 14th floor. He was like a monster. Taesan raises his sword.

"Are you going to give up?"

"I can't do that."

Route-Ra grips the spear with both hands, eyes shining brightly.

A storm is brewing.
Here is the English translation of the text:

The spear draws traces and simultaneously pierces ten places. The freely moving spear forms a circle, smoothly letting the air flow.

The optimal use of an extreme weapon.

Taesan raised his sword.

Kuwoong!

He crushes the technique with strength. Like a storm, his sword strikes split the surroundings.

Route-Ra did his best.

Five minutes later, the lord with a sword in his chest slowly retreated.

"Is this the end?"

"You held out longer than I expected."

Originally, it would have ended in about three minutes. However, Route-Ra managed to hold out until the end by really clinging to the ground and discarding his weapon, buying a little time.

It was a meaningless difference. In the end, victory was out of reach.

But Route-Ra seemed satisfied.

"Well, okay. I don't know if I'll remember this outcome, but I'm satisfied with myself now."

Route-Ra threw the spear. Taesan caught it.

[Obtained the hastily made spear.]

"Use it as you wish, warrior."

Route-Ra closed his eyes.

[You have emerged victorious against Route-Ra.] [You have defeated the lord of goblins. Earned the title [One cursed by goblins].] [You have defeated the ruler of a race. Earned the title [King Slayer].]
