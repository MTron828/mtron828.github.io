**Episode 615**

615. Easy Mode. Brief Time Stop (3)

The thought suddenly occurs to him. It's crazy. He has to stop all projectiles within his interference range in an instant, almost 0.05 seconds.

That includes things outside his line of sight and beyond his interference range.

He doesn't even know how many projectiles can enter his interference range. He also doesn't know how long he needs to maintain the stopped state.

Optimistically, if he can stop time for just a moment, he might be able to acquire a skill. But maybe he'll need to maintain it for several seconds.

The forced duel was like that, and even though he couldn't achieve it, blocking projectiles would be the same.

There's a high possibility that his efforts might be in vain and yield nothing.

"No."

Taesan erased his negative thoughts. Assumptions are meaningless. What's important is whether he achieves his set goal or not.

He refocuses his mind and moves his sword.

**Kagakagakagak!**
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The projectiles go crazy and bounce back. In an instant, thousands of patterns appear.

The field of vision expands.

The activation skill cannot be used. The conditions for acquiring the skill are everywhere, but it's impossible to activate it.

He relies only on his instincts and the always-active skill.

He sorts out the patterns he can read and utilize among the thousands. He moves his body to control them.

Kagagak!

His hands move roughly. As expected, control fails. The bouncing projectiles pierce through Taesan's body in an instant.

[Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.]

Until now, he would stop immediately and start again when this happened. Blocking projectiles is meaningless once they make contact.

But it's not the case now.

What he wants is a moment of stillness.

Even if the projectiles touch his body, it doesn't matter.

And in that process, Taesan realized one more thing.

'Attack nullification can also be used.'

The effect of attack nullification. It turns back time to before the attack lands.

In other words, after activating attack nullification, it gives him a certain amount of time to respond."

Note: "Kagagak" is an onomatopoeia and doesn't have a direct translation, but it's often used to describe a loud, intense sound.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan quickly moved his body. The projectile that had been nullified by the attack's invalidation effect bounced back and collided with another projectile, deflecting off Taesan's sword.

Thousands, tens of thousands of patterns were formed. Just looking at them made his mind dizzy and his head ache.

But he didn't stop.

He continued to read on.

And about an hour later, Taesan emerged from the secret room.

"I'm going to die."

His physical condition was also exhausted, but the mental exhaustion was even greater. He had read too much, and his eyes were tired. Taesan sat down and took a rest.

"How long will it take?"

It was unknown. Even if he stopped for just a moment, it was much harder to stop than to simply block.

At least, it was fortunate that the time he had invested over the past few years was not entirely meaningless.

The physical force of the projectiles was the same, but their volumes were different. He had a clear understanding in his mind of how they would move when collided with a certain amount of force at a certain angle.

He had grasped the exact number of projectiles in the room, down to the last digit.

And he didn't need to block all eight sides.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When it collides with the floor, the projectile also stops. That part could also be utilized. The conditions were better than when I first tried to block the projectile.

'It'll take about a year, I think.'

But it's still taking a long time, no matter what.

There is a possibility. If I can gain a valuable skill by investing time that has no meaning or value, then it's a profit.

Taesan, who had taken a sufficient rest, re-entered the secret room.

Kaang!

He draws his sword.

He uses the remembered pattern. The projectiles bounce back and enter the range.

Since he's not trying to block them, the projectiles need to enter his range instead.

But not too many. It needs to be controlled to a certain level. And while doing so, he calculates the minimum amount required to acquire the skill.

'It's ridiculously hard.'

He mutters to himself and continues to move his body, repeating the process of reading patterns and calculating.

A sharp, swift sword flashes by, heading towards Taesan. Taesan doesn't dodge and slowly moves his sword.

[Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.]

The attack is nullified, and the sword returns to its previous state before it touched.

The slowly moving sword and the swift sword clash."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ahhh!"

The arrow flew in the opposite direction. It collided with the needle and bounced off in a diagonal direction, hitting the ground and then bouncing back up. Immediately, it collided with a sphere the size of a human body and crashed to the ground again.

Taesan watched the entire process.

"...The largest projectile is a sphere the size of a human body."

The projectiles here would bounce back immediately upon collision. In reality, they had almost no weight.

Then, couldn't we use something to press them down and stick them to the ground?

That way, the continuous collisions would stop.

Using a large shield-like equipment, couldn't we exclude a certain range by pressing down on the sphere?

What means could we use? How many variables could we control?

Taesan thought and calculated everything.

Taesan continued to think calmly.

* * *

Time passed and passed.

After two months, the overwhelming patterns that had been impossible to accept had somewhat settled down.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

When five months had passed, he reached the limit of his calculation pattern.

However, it was still far from enough. From then on, he had to use something other than pattern calculation to reach his goal. Taesan tried to control it using the floor and attack invalidation.

When seven months had passed, he succeeded in achieving perfect control using the floor.

When ten months had passed, he succeeded in controlling it using attack invalidation as well.

He had to use his brain too much, so he had to take breaks frequently. During his breaks, Taesan would chat with the community. Most of the time, they would listen to Iteayeon's complaints and grumblings.

And around the time one year had passed.

The strongest player, Choigain, cleared the 100th floor.

[Iteayeon [Alone] : Don't go!]

Iteayeon clung to him desperately.

[Iteayeon [Alone] : What are you going to do if you go that far? You're already leaving one by one! Don't leave me behind!]

Over the past year, many players had returned to Earth. The number of people who would listen to Iteayeon's complaints was decreasing, and that was a huge problem for Iteayeon.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Choi Gain is one of the few people who listened to her complaints to the end with Taesan. She couldn't help but feel desperate.

[Choi Gain[Hard]: Hahaha.]

The awkward laughter contained a clear intention of refusal.

[Choi Gain[Hard]: I'm sorry, Taeyeon-ssi, but... I want to leave. I want to return to Earth.]

Choi Gain spoke firmly.

[Choi Gain[Hard]: I will build a civilization with people. I will revive our hometown.]

Taeyeon couldn't hold on anymore. She knew that trying to hold on was her own selfish desire. If she could escape this terrible place, it would be a blessing.

[Choi Gain[Hard]: It's done then, Taesan-ssi.] [Gang Taesan[Eezi]: Take care. By the time I leave, I hope the internet will be developed.] [Choi Gain[Hard]: Since a lot of time has passed, I wonder if the power hasn't been restored? With many technicians returning, it's possible, right?]

Choi Gain's joy was palpable even through the text. He asked Taesan.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Choi Gain [Hard]: When are you coming back, Mr. Taesan?] [Kang Taesan [Easy]: I don't know. I'll come back after I finish this.] [Choi Gain [Hard]: Time stop? Seriously... it's unbelievable. The possibility is even scarier.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Taesan, are you leaving?]

Lee Taeyeon, who had been quietly listening, was shocked.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Don't go... don't go... I'm really lonely...]

Taesan smiled faintly.

[Kang Taesan [Easy]: At least for now, I don't plan on going, so don't worry.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Really? You promised, right?]

The conversation continued for a while, and soon it was time for Choi Gain to leave. Lee Taeyeon bid him farewell with tears in her eyes.

[Choi Gain [Hard]: Well, everyone! It's farewell! See you next time!]

His words were filled with strong conviction.

The conviction that they would survive and return to Earth.

And the conviction that Earth would be at peace.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Uh, yeah.] [Kang Taesan [Easy]: Take care.]

With that, Choi Gain didn't say anything else. He had returned to Earth.

"Earth."

If he just willed it, he could return right away.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not this disgusting emergency ration, but I'll be able to eat decent meat and fresh vegetables. Not on a hard, cold dungeon floor, but on a soft bed.

"Hmph."

Taesan shook his head. Useless thoughts. They mean nothing.

Right now, the only thing that matters is skill.

Taesan gripped his sword again.

And so, two months passed.

Taesan realized that he couldn't obtain skills through this method.
