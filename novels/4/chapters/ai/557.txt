**Chapter 558**

558. 98th Floor. Complete Existence. High Priest (1)

Ku-gu-gu-gung….

As soon as Leviathan declared its defeat, the realm of the end began to disappear. They returned to the labyrinth the size of a sports stadium.

"It's good."

And Taesan was extremely satisfied.

He had confirmed everything. The results of the confirmation were even more satisfying to Taesan.

He had succeeded in stealing the concept that called for the end of the universe. Although it was a meaningless power against the High Priests, it could change the story if he mixed it with the boundaries.

Taesan was extremely delighted.

As soon as the quest was cleared, the restrictions were lifted. Taesan took out all the equipment he had and wore them. Bardley and Akasha immediately asked.

[Taesan, what happened?] [Did you win?]

"Yes."

Taesan nodded.

The two looked at Leviathan.

[…Ah.] [Uh.]

And Bardley and Akasha held their breath.

They felt an instinctive fear towards Leviathan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I didn't even think about winning against Leviathan, or enduring, or losing.

I was just scared.

I didn't want to get close. I wanted to get far away and escape from its sight.

It was a fear close to instinct, one that all living beings in the universe possess.

[Tae, Tae-san. Did you win against that thing?]

"Yeah, it was nothing."

[Huh, huh...][Grrr...].

Leviathan let out a low growl, as if it didn't like what was being said.

But it didn't take any further action. It curled up its body like a puppy, glancing at Tae-san's eyes.

At that sight, Bardray was able to suppress his instinct to run away. Bardray let out a dry laugh.

[The last lizard... or something. How did you win against this?]

"It was nothing to me."

Tae-san didn't have any particular emotions about winning against Leviathan.

Leviathan was clearly powerful. With its strength and ferocity, Tae-san would have had to risk his life if he were in a similar situation."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But it was an absolute superiority. The God of Death was powerful enough to oppress the Transcenders, but to Taesan, it was as if he had no influence at all. Since he was an opponent who couldn't be defeated from the start, there was no reason to be happy about winning.

"Still, a win is a win."

Taesan approached Leviathan.

"Give it to me."

Taesan had cleared the 97th floor quest.

And as the target of the quest, Leviathan had to give Taesan a reward for clearing it. Leviathan's body trembled.

He had honestly never thought he would lose.

He believed it was impossible for a being in the universe to defy him, who was in charge of the end. Even if Taesan was on the boundary, his roots were universal, and he thought his authority would prevail.

But it wasn't so.

Taesan had already transcended the laws of the universe.

'...A god.'

He was a separate, distinct existence. But not a god. Leviathan saw a concept similar to Taesan for the first time.

From the start, he was an opponent who couldn't be defeated.

But defeat was defeat.

He had to give a suitable reward. Leviathan desperately racked his brain and opened his mouth.

[What do you... desire.]

"Your power."

Leviathan's eyes shook greatly at Taesan's calm words.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I want to say it, but I can't. Bring out the suitable materials and equipment. It's filled with attacking power."

[Is this attacking power...?]

Leviathan murmurs in a young, carefree voice. After a moment of contemplation, Leviathan makes a decision.

[Gather. It's the end.]

It's a word of power.

A single authority formed by language. At the same time, the end is condensed and takes shape.

Kyiiiing.

And it's realized. A grayish orb appears.

[You have obtained the End's Collection.] [End's Collection] [The End of All Things. This collection contains the power to force an end to everything in the universe.]

"Wow."

The power contained within the End's Collection is close to a complete concept.

It's a power focused solely on destruction. If handled properly, it could create an extremely powerful piece of equipment.

[Implement it here. My tool.]

But that's not the end. With Leviathan's declaration, a sword appears before him.

It's a longsword with a grayish, rugged blade.

The aura of the end can be felt within it.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You have obtained the Sword of the End.] [Sword of the End] [Strength + 2000] [Attack Power + 5000] [The sword that calls for the end of all things. Its power is focused solely on attack power.]"

“……Hmph.”

Taesan let out a sigh of admiration.

Attack power of 5000.

It was higher than any equipment he had, even when compared to Bardray and Akasha's attack power. It was a number worthy of the reward from the universe-ending Leviathan.

“Long time no see, new equipment.”

Recently, the rewards had not been equipment, so it was a rare change. Attack power was the most valuable stat to Taesan right now. It was significant.

“This is enough.”

[Then I'll... retreat for now.]

Taesan nodded his head. Leviathan hastily opened a space and escaped.

[Ugh, I'm out of breath.] [Huff.]

Only then did Bardray and Akasha breathe a sigh of relief. Just being in the same space as Leviathan made them feel like they had a knife to their throat.

Taesan fiddled with the End Assembly.

Material item.

How could he use this?

As Taesan pondered, the wrist protector came to mind.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[World-Changing Wrist Guard.] [A wrist guard created by the witch herself, imbuing it with power. With specific conditions and catalysts, it can alter the laws of the world around the equipment, granting it the power to do so.] [Attack +800] [Defense +800] [If you've learned the green witch's magic, you can use [Partial World Change].]

The wrist guard given by the green witch. It had the characteristic of strengthening by devouring materials.

The End's Assembly is too enormous for the wrist guard to handle, but if Taesan controls it, it's possible.

Hmm.

It's as if the wrist guard is being bound by the End's Assembly, but the ash-colored ones are firmly controlling each other.

Kuuuuung!

And the End's Assembly begins to seep into the wrist guard. Its enormous power and concept slowly start to convert into attack power.

Kagakagak!

And finally, all the Ends are embedded within the wrist guard.

"[World-Changing Wrist Guard.] [A wrist guard created by the witch herself, imbuing it with power. With specific conditions and catalysts, it can alter the laws of the world around the equipment, granting it the power to do so.] [Attack +4800] [Defense +800] [If you've learned the green witch's magic, you can use [Partial World Change].] [You can temporarily summon [The End].]

"It's alright."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"His attack power had increased by a whopping 4000. With just this one wrist guard, the difference in attack power between his past life's Lee Tae-yeon and now was negligible.

Although the partial world change had lost its meaning since he could now call upon the realm, the addition of being able to summon the end was a welcome change.

It wasn't a bad change. Simply put, his attack power had increased by around 7200. For Taesan, who had the ability to convert physical strength into multiplication, it was a sufficient reward.

Moreover, he now possessed the power of circulation.

It couldn't be simply seen as an attack power of 7200.

After finishing his confirmation, Taesan went down the stairs.

98th floor.

The end of the labyrinth was finally approaching. He went down the stairs and arrived at the room, but there was nothing there.

"Looks like it's busy."

It seemed like there was no leisure time, as if something was blocking the way. Taesan thought he would wait while doing something leisurely.

As it happened, there was something to do. Taesan called upon the boundary beast. With a low roar, its shape began to take form, its body trembling as it faced Taesan.

He could imbue the boundary with circulation.

Then, could he do the opposite as well?

By granting the concept of circulation to the boundary's realm, could he summon something new?"

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The possibility was sufficient. The problem was that the beast at the boundary refused to circulate.

So, I slowly reduced the rejection response and made it accept the circulation.

[You activated the circulation.]

The circulation touched the beast. The beast trembled its body.

Slowly but surely, it adapted.

It wasn't something that could be done immediately. The mountain range took its time, leisurely making the boundaries touch each other. The beast at the boundary slowly got used to the circulation.

About a week later...

A magician appeared.

"I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. It seems it ended faster than I thought."

The magician spoke calmly, revealing their figure. Their entire body still had remnants of black magic.

"You've worked hard."

"It's just as I said."

The magician wiped their tired face with their sleeve.

"I'll give you a 98th-floor quest. You can guess what it is, right?"

Taesan nodded. There was no other choice, anyway. The magician opened their mouth.

"The quest I'll give you is one. Kill the evil god that's invading the universe."

Let me know if you have any further requests!

**[98th Floor Quest Begins.] [Kill the Corrupting Gods.] [Reward: ???] [Secret Reward: ???]**

* * *

Kill the Corrupting Gods.

Not a fragment, not a part, not a piece.

Kill the entire Corrupting God, that's the quest.

Taesan's expression didn't change. He had expected this quest to come someday. It was just that it had finally arrived.

"Is it the Corrupting God?"

"What's the situation like?"

"I'll tell you from the beginning. You know this too, but the seal has been broken. The beings from the other side have started corrupting the universe. And the Corrupting Gods, which can be called their core, have scattered."

"Scattered?"

"Yes. The Corrupting Gods have scattered across the universe, corrupting parts of it. The Transcendents are trying to stop them."

"Are they all separated and individual?"

"The Corrupting Gods don't become stronger by combining their powers. On the contrary, their abilities interfere with each other."

The Corrupting Gods were all separated.

Taesan, who had processed that information, asked:

"Have the locations of all the Corrupting Gods been identified?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"From the start, the universe has been thoroughly contaminated, so it's impossible not to notice. Except for one, everything has been detected."

"One?"

"The Thief."

At those words, Taesan scrunched up his face.

"......Is it hiding its appearance?"

"It's highly likely. The eyes and ears of the Transcenders are spread throughout the universe. If even a tiny bit of power is used, it can be detected immediately...... But it still hasn't been confirmed. It's definitely somewhere in this universe."

"Have you found the location of the God of Decline?"

"No."

The mage shook his head.

"If it's as you say, it's definitely somewhere in this universe...... but it's not visible. It's not easy to hide the existence of something with that level of concept. Hmm, how did it do it."

The Thief and the God of Decline. Both were in a state of hiding their appearances.

"Well, for now, it's not worth worrying about. If it shows itself, we'll know immediately. What's more important is the current situation."

The mage clapped his hands and changed the subject.

"We've definitely become weaker than in the past war."

Many Transcenders were destroyed in the past war. On the other hand, the High Gods were immortal. Except for a few, they still remained.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a state where I couldn't help but be pushed around.

"But... I don't think there's a bigger problem than I thought. They must have suffered some damage during the process of breaking the seal. Of course, it'll be fine with time, but it's too much to handle right now. It's just a matter of slightly touching it to balance it out."

"I'll take on that role."

Taesan asked in a calm tone.

"Who is the high priest I need to deal with?"

"The owner of the abyss. The administrator of the bottomless pit."

The wizard replied.

"Mujeogang. Kill that high priest."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
