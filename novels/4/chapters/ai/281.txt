Chapter 282

282. Amelia Airin (4)

"There's something more I need to tell you."

Lee Tae-yeon asked Taesan with a surprised tone.

"Will you tell others as well?"

"Why not?"

"No, it's just...".

Lee Tae-yeon sent a suspicious gaze towards Oliver. Oliver subtly pushed his chair back.

"At least, can't you show some favor to him? Is that okay?"

"It doesn't matter. I'm not going to tell everything anyway."

To be honest, Taesan wasn't interested in what kind of trick the US had pulled off in this quest. What was important was survival.

"If you continue to cause trouble, I'll take action, but not yet. Our goal is not to confront each other, but to survive."

Survival. Surviving and returning to Earth.

Their expressions turned serious at his words. Lee Tae-yeon also nodded in agreement and turned his gaze away from Oliver.

"Before that, let's ask first. Are you going to work with us to take care of the monsters?"

"Yes."

"There's no point in refusing now that we've come this far."

"It's better to combine our strength rather than going alone."
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Each of them showed positivity. Tae-san lightly tapped the table with his fingertips.

"Then let's make a contract first."

[Tae-san proposes a silence contract to everyone present in the space.] [Condition: Withholding information disclosed in this place.] [You can choose to accept or reject.]

The silence contract was one of the few rights that players could exercise, just like a duel. Tae-san opened his mouth.

"From now on, if what I say becomes known, it might be a bit annoying. So let's make sure of it."

About the gods and the maze.

It's something everyone needs to know at some point, but not now. At least people need to reach a stage where they can guess. If the truth is revealed all at once, chaos will ensue.

Oliver carefully asked,

"What happens if you break it?"

"Nothing will happen. Only an alert that I broke it will come to me. And when I return to Earth, I will just pay the price for breaking the contract."

"...I see."

Oliver said calmly, swallowing his saliva.

"I'll accept it."

"Me too."

"Yes."

As Amelia nodded quietly, everyone agreed.

Taesan opened his mouth.

"How do you think we ended up in this labyrinth?"

* * *

About the gods. About the high gods. And about the labyrinth.

Taesan explained the information he had discovered to them.

They had risked their lives to lead people and had survived until the end, or had died before that.

Everyone here had done their best to survive. The truth was a natural right they should know.

Of course, not everything was revealed. The reason for the labyrinth's separation and difficulty was not explained, as it would only dampen their spirits.

But he had explained most of the important core.

As the story came to an end, their faces were filled with shock.

"......I had a vague idea, but."

Daniel's trembling eyes opened his mouth.

"Really...... a god-like existence was involved."

"A sudden destruction of the world. And the labyrinth. If it was an accidental event without the intervention of a transcendent being, that would be even more terrifying."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Because Amelia had talked about God, I knew that such a thing existed, but... I thought it was just a story in Alone Mode and didn't pay much attention to it. But it was directly related to us, wasn't it?"

Oliver muttered quietly. Everyone was in shock.

In the case of Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk, they had already experienced God's trials in Alone Mode, so the shock was relatively less, but it wasn't nonexistent. They also didn't know that the Earth was being invaded by God.

"God said they would oppose God. Does that mean they're a benevolent being towards us?"

"No."

Aika's question was met with a shake of Taesan's head.

"They don't care about individual mortals. They only show favor to those who please them."

Taesan glanced at Amelia with a hint of disdain.

"The God of Fall doesn't show favor, but rather looks for toys to play with... and doesn't even give that much attention to other humans."

At Taesan's words, Amelia's body trembled slightly.

But she didn't argue or show anger. She just quietly thought about something.

"If we've come this far, don't you think we should know why Korea ended up like this?"

Taesan, overwhelmingly strong. But the number of people who had survived in Korea was extremely small.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Oliver said in a trembling voice.

"......Are the gods trying to kill you?"

"That's right. They're giving you too much attention. I wish they would just leave you alone."

Everyone's gaze was fixed on Taesan's grumbling appearance.

A being that could destroy the planet itself. An immortal transcendent being that far surpassed human understanding.

And the human who was receiving their attention.

Once again, Taesan's existence felt truly remarkable.

"This is......I can't say it for sure."

Kim Hwi-yeon said with a sigh. It was too big of a secret. If they revealed it now, it would definitely cause uncontrollable chaos.

"Anyway, it's better to prepare. The scope of the Earth's quest has expanded from country to world, and now the gods will also take an interest in the entire world."

Everyone nodded with a stern face.

Taesan clapped his hands.

"Information that can't be shared outside stops here. From now on, we can reveal as much as we want. I'll tell you about the skills."

With that, the heavy atmosphere disappeared. Everyone's eyes sparkled as they waited for Taesan's words.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

No one is unaware of the importance of skills. The possibility of survival itself changes depending on the skills one possesses.

Taesan is the strongest player on earth. He was the one who taught skills. Every single word had to be memorized and stored in one's mind.

Taesan began his explanation.

"Unwavering determination, counterattacks, vital spot attacks, breathless attacks, continuous attacks, and reduction of damage..."

First, he told them about the skills that anyone could acquire with hard work. Those who had already acquired them but didn't know how to get them were amazed, and those who hadn't acquired them yet were thrilled and stored the information in their minds.

"Breathless... it looks really cool. How long do I have to endure?"

"Until the moment of death."

"......"

It's not that everyone can acquire them just because they're taught. Anyone can acquire them with effort, but that effort is never easy.

However, if all players are taught, one or two people will eventually acquire them. And seeing them, others will think they can also acquire them and take on the challenge.

That's how people slowly become stronger.

That's what Taesan wanted.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It may seem difficult, but it's worth the effort. I wonder how you figured this out."

"I'm also amazed. You told us about it as soon as we entered the labyrinth."

"...As soon as we entered?"

Amelia muttered quietly. Her voice was too soft, so only Taesan could hear her.

Taesan ignored her and continued speaking.

"Next is the skill of jumping and landing. The effect is that you can jump high and won't take damage even if you fall from a great height."

"How do you get it?"

"If you fall, you need to land on the ground from a height that would be fatal."

"......"

Everyone was silent.

Taesan spoke up.

"This is as far as anyone can get with this skill."

Oliver was taken aback by Taesan's words.

"Anyone can get it? It seems like only a select few can get it."

"Anyone can get it. You just need to put in the effort."

From here on, it was a skill that couldn't be obtained.

Taesan nodded.

"So, it's Lee Tae-yeon, Kang Joon-hyuk, and Amelia."

"...And me?"

"Yes."

Taesan nodded.

"Only three of you will remain. The rest of you, leave. From here on, it's a skill that's too difficult to teach to everyone."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I had also thought of revealing the nullification of attacks or endurance to a certain extent.

Taesan's desire was not his own strength, but the survival of as many people as possible. There was no reason to hold back on skills.

However, he didn't trust individual humans.

Skills like forced duels and absolute judgment were ones that could cause great chaos if someone with malicious intentions learned them.

Taesan remembered. When he returned to Earth, there were those who killed other players to fulfill their desires.

Of course, it was almost impossible for them to acquire skills. Even in his past life, he had announced it to the community, but only one person, Lee Tae-yeon, had succeeded. And she had only acquired addition and certainty.

But there was a possibility. There was no reason to leave a chance for chaos to occur.

Moreover, considering the conditions for acquiring skills, those who tried to get them might end up dying and causing more harm than good. The losses outweighed the gains when revealing them.

'There.'

Unlike in his past life, many players in the alone mode were still alive."

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If they were to learn how to persevere and meet a guide, what would happen?

At the very least, a good picture wasn't drawn. There was a high possibility that they would tell the guide all the skills that Taesan had taught them for their own benefit. Or, they might be caught and tortured to extract the skills, and then killed.

Power that didn't match one's abilities was poison.

Although the space was separated, it was unclear how the influence would come. The core skill was planned to be revealed later, after being filtered further.

"Ah, yes."

"I understand."

As they were about to leave, they bowed their heads to Taesan.

"Thank you so much."

They also knew. The information that Taesan had given them was extremely valuable, something that couldn't be bought even with a thousand gold coins. It wasn't strange at all that Taesan had kept it to himself without saying a word.

And yet, Taesan had provided it to all of them without asking for anything in return. They all knew that the acquisition condition was secondary, and that it was an enormous blessing.

Taesan replied.

"If you're grateful, survive to the end. That's the repayment you can make."

"......I guess we can't die now, then."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They left. Taesan said to the three remaining people.

"First, endure. Kang Jun-hyuk and Lee Tae-yeon will know."

"Ah……."

"Yes, they know. But they couldn't get it."

The two of them spoke hesitantly. Taesan said to Amelia.

"The effect is to gain immunity to all damage for a certain period of time when you receive damage that leads to death."

"……Is there really such a skill?"

It's a skill that gives you a chance to survive even when you're on the brink of death. It's a skill with an absurd value.

Taesan replied.

"Even if you take damage just once, if you perfectly block the opponent's attack multiple times in a situation where you would die, it's okay."

"……What?"

"And next is attack nullification. The effect is to erase the attack itself the moment it hits. To obtain it, you need to be in a situation where you must take damage without defense, and then avoid taking damage."

"Is it okay to use a defense skill?"

"No. You need to purely rely on movement to reduce damage. The only thing allowed is the blessing powder that increases luck."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"To counter the opponent's attack, you had to reduce the damage to the minimum by dodging and then use the blessing powder to nullify the reduced damage. It was only possible to obtain it by doing so.

If you had a shield, it wouldn't be difficult to obtain, but that was a trick that only Taesan, who had passed the strengthened trial, could use. They were not like that.

"……."

The ghost, who had been quietly listening, grumbled.

"[You're really lucky. Even if you can get just one of the things you're talking about, you'd be willing to give up everything, and yet you're getting this without any cost.]

The skills of the labyrinth are absolute. Nullification can render even the strongest opponent useless, and forced duels cannot be interfered with even by the Spirit King.

If I were to tell the guide's headquarters about the attack nullification right now, they would give up everything to get it. The skills Taesan is talking about have that much value.

Getting something like that without any cost is clearly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

"I've heard it before, but isn't it a skill that's impossible to obtain?"

"Is it really possible? No matter how I listen, it sounds like it's impossible to acquire."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Kang Joon-hyuk and Lee Tae-yeon had puzzled faces. Although they believed in Taesan, the conditions he told them were all unbelievable.

Only Amelia was staring at Taesan with a shocked face.

A fire began to burn in her eyes.

Taesan, who had seen her expression, opened his mouth.

"I'm not forcing you to learn. But the difference between recognizing the conditions of a skill and not is huge."

Taesan continued to explain.

Addition, absolute judgment, forced duel, and certainty. Each of these skills had the value of a main skill.

He told them the information.

"Ugh... my head hurts..."

Lee Tae-yeon tried to put the information in his head while holding his head, and Amelia looked at Taesan with a wavering gaze.

"Lastly, there's the sword of determination. Its effect is to triple the damage. The cooldown time is one hour."

"That's also impossible..."

"The acquisition condition is to fight against an opponent you can't win against and risk your life to survive."

"What?"

Lee Tae-yeon was taken aback after hearing the condition.

"Then didn't I or Joon-hyuk already fulfill it? We fought against you, Taesan."

"Didn't you get it?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is that so, Junhyeok? And you?"

"I couldn't get it either."

Taesan turned his gaze to the two of them after their responses.

"Amelia, and you?"

"......I couldn't get it either."

She spoke in a quiet voice. Taesan thought for a moment before speaking.

"This battle wasn't a proper battle, after all."

In the trial of the God of Descent, instead of death, they would only become unable to act. It was natural that they couldn't obtain it since the premise of risking their lives was broken.

"Then, when we fought to obtain the Ability Sword earlier......"

"You guys didn't fight to win back then."

"Ah."

Lee Taeyeon muttered blankly.

"Getting skills is really hard......"

"Did you think it would be easy? But if you know the conditions, you'll have a chance to acquire it as you go down the labyrinth."

Taesan stood up from his seat.

"That's all I'll tell you for now. The rest is up to you guys to discuss. Then, Amelia."

"......Me?"

"There's something I need to tell you, so follow me."
