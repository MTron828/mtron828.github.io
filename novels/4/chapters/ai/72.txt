Episode 73

73. 12th Floor, Boss (5)

Even though a goal has emerged, nothing will change.

As Maria said, he is currently in a very weak state. He hasn't even learned addition, let alone multiplication, essential strikes, or copying.

So, he descends.

Deeper.

To where he can become stronger.

"But first."

He hasn't even confirmed what he obtained with the sudden invitation. First, he checks Maria's reward.

[Weapon of Shape Transformation] [Attack Power +15] [A weapon that can change its form. Can transform into a dagger or a longsword.]

It comes with a decent attack power and special abilities. Taesan checked it immediately. The weapon transformed into a short dagger and soon changed into an ordinary-looking longsword.

It can be used as two different weapons. Changing its form didn't seem to affect its attack power.

After confirming the weapon, Taesan then checked the skills.

[Special Activation Skill: Freedom of Choice] [Mana Cost: 20] [Proficiency: 1%] [Allows transformation of stats. The ratio doesn't seem to be very high yet.]
"Oh?"

Stat transformation. It was something he had never seen before. Taesan immediately conducted an experiment.

The transformation ratio was 10%. Agility, strength, intelligence among themselves, stamina, mana, shield, attack power, and defense could all be transformed. It seemed impossible to transform two types simultaneously.

"Not bad."

Stats vary in importance depending on the situation. There are times when stamina is worthless, and times when defense is worthless.

It is possible to change meaningless parts into meaningful stats. It's still 10% for now, but as proficiency increases, it can rise even higher.

Later, 100% transformation should also be possible. It was a skill that could be useful depending on its application.

"It seems the reward matches what was promised."

There wasn't just Maria's reward. As difficult as Maria's trial was, additional rewards could be obtained.

There were skills whose proficiency had greatly increased first.
[Special Activation Skill: Breathless Attack] [Mana Cost: 2] [Proficiency: 21%] [Allows movement without regard to breathing during combat. Currently lasts only about 20 seconds. Reduces muscle fatigue.]

After tiresomely using the Breathless Attack skill, it finally surpassed 20%, reducing muscle fatigue.

Breathless Attack was intense due to unrestricted movement but caused significant muscle fatigue. The mitigation made it a welcome change.

[Constant Activation Special Skill: Vision Expansion] [Proficiency: 80%] [Grants a broadened field of view, extending well beyond human norms.]

Vision Expansion was rapidly approaching 100%.

Most skills undergo significant transformations upon reaching 100%. It was a skill entirely different from anything before.

At this rate, it might reach 100% before breaking through the 20th floor. Taesan checked other skills with modest expectations.

Due to endless battles, he was able to learn a new skill.

"Your mind went astray with the passage of time. You have acquired the special activation skill [Mental Acceleration]."

"Come to think of it, time felt a bit odd."

During Maria's trial, both enemy movements and his own felt slower than expected.
Mental Acceleration. In Easy Mode, where intense battles that twist the mind's time are rare, it was a skill he had never learned in his previous life.

[Special Activation Skill: Mental Acceleration] [Mana Cost: 8] [Proficiency: 1%] [Accelerates the mind. Time's flow twists ever so slightly. Currently usable for only about 10 seconds.] [You have activated Mental Acceleration.]

He used the skill, but nothing seemed to change.

Taesan raised his arm.

"So slow."

The movement of his arm felt strangely sluggish. His mind was moving faster than time itself. It was a very subtle difference, but undeniably distinct.

"Is this how the skill works?"

Having more time to think during combat was equivalent to an increased chance of winning. As proficiency increased, its value would surely rise even more. Perhaps it could even be a tier just below a main skill.

With each new thing he learned like this, he would undoubtedly grow stronger. As Taesan finished his inspection, he tried to move.

There was something in his pocket.

"What's this?"
It was a small decoration in the shape of a flower. Its seven petals were adorned with colors as vibrant as a rainbow.

[Gift from Maria] [A gift bestowed upon humans favored by the gods. Currently has no known effect.]

"A ghost?"

"Huh, what's this?"

"Hmm... I've never seen it either?"

Even the ghost seemed puzzled.

"Well, it shouldn't be bad."

It seemed to be an item given out of goodwill. Taesan put it back into his pocket.

Finally, Taesan moved.

He killed the monsters he encountered and found a secret room. Disarming traps, he collected rewards.

In the midst of this, his proficiency in trap disarming reached 20%.

[Special Activation Skill: Trap Disarm] [Mana Cost: 1] [Proficiency: 20%] [Attempts to disarm a trap. Seems to have a low chance of success.]

It wasn't a major achievement, but it felt good.

The reward from the secret room was a pair of high-quality leather gloves.

[Strong Gloves] [Attack +5] [Defense +3] [The finest gloves crafted by a famous artisan. Sturdy enough to withstand even sword strikes.]

"It's been a while since I changed gloves."

He equipped the new gear and headed towards the boss room.

[A Lesser Decayed Ghoul appeared.]
It was a truly intuitive name. Just as its name suggested, the ghoul with remnants of red flesh bared its teeth and lunged. Taesan wrinkled his face.

"It stinks."

Squelch.

He swung his fist.

The ghoul was pounded into the ground.

He stomped on it persistently, and it vanished with screams.

[You have emerged victorious against a Lesser Decayed Ghoul.]

The boss of the 12th floor. If it were Itaeyeon or Kang Junhyuk, they might have fought to the death and emerged victorious.

But for him, it was too easy. His opponent didn't even pose a minor threat.

Taesan felt dissatisfied.

"Too easy."

Compared to the corresponding floor, he had become excessively strong. The only way for him to feel challenged was to face divine trials or named monsters.

Naturally, he missed out on most rewards when encountering bosses.

Firstly, no archenemy rewards appeared. Moreover, his boost in divine grace didn't seem to work properly. These were things he couldn't obtain because they were too powerful.

Taesan was disappointed.

In the past, he might not have thought much of it. Even if he missed such details, there would be no problem with clearing. However, if his goal was to reach divinity, he had to seize every possible advantage.

"Is there some way?"


There wasn't any other way yet, so he had no choice but to descend.

Of course, it wasn't like he didn't pick up anything. The boost in divine grace worked slightly, and clearing the floor had also bumped his level up by 2, now reaching level 28. He could obtain meaningful increases in stats.

Both clearing the 12th floor and the secret reward were magic-related items.

Thinking he wouldn't particularly have any use for them, he went to find Rilis. She brightened up when she saw Taesan.

"I've been waiting for you! Did you bring it?"

"Here."

Taesan handed it over, and she eagerly checked it. Soon, she smiled with satisfaction.

"This should do! Finally, it's my turn!"

She learned basic magic. Rilis's pupils glittered with excitement at the fact.

As she murmured something more, the magical items disappeared. They had been offered as a tribute. She closed her eyes briefly in prayer, then opened them brightly.

"Done!"

She couldn't contain her joy and bounced around.

"Now I can learn one beginner's magic spell! Yahoo! Finally!"

"Isn't that a bit too noisy?"
"Beginner's magic! Beginner's magic! It has its worth!"

"I'm not so sure."

To him, who could create Flame Bursts and Frost Arrows, it wasn't all that impressive. Rilis, noticing Taesan's expression, muttered in dissatisfaction.

"Some people risk their lives just to learn this..."

"So what can you learn then?"

In response to Taesan's question, Rilis suppressed her emotions and raised a finger to her lips.

"I can't choose on this end. It's directly decided and bestowed by the divine."

"No choice at all?"

He nodded calmly, having expected as much.

"Then teach me."

"Alright. Just wait a moment."

She closed her eyes again and murmured something more. Power descended upon her from the void.

"So that's the power of magic."

It was a dense mana wave, evident even to Taesan. Rilis opened her eyes.

"I've learned it."

"Which one?"

"It's a status ailment magic. I'll explain what kind it is when we learn it. Let's save the surprise for later enjoyment."

As she spoke, Rilis had a constant smile on her face. The ghost chuckled and asked.

[Are you that happy?]
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"Whether it's good or not! Finally, it's beginner's magic! I struggled so much to learn Invisibility, but I've managed to learn one so easily! I'm really thankful!"

Rilis spread her arms wide and tried to hug Taesan. Taesan backed away.

"Ouch!"

"What are you suddenly doing?"

"Um... I was trying to express this joy."

Taesan chuckled.

"No need for that. I'll come back next time there's an offering."

"Yeah. See you again!"

She waved goodbye with a bright smile.

Taesan descended to the 13th floor.

[Quest on 13th Floor begins.] [Defeat the boss of the 13th floor and pass through.] [Reward: Ring of Severance.] [Secret Reward: ???]

He hadn't accumulated enough money to use the shop. The dwarf looked calm, as if there were no other choice but to play penalty games. Without much conversation, he arrived at the 13th floor.

The 13th floor was a den of zombies. They were packed in like goblins, but individually weak. While roughly cutting through them, he felt a presence.

As Taesan grabbed a zombie's head to tear it off, he hesitated. His detection sense was intensely activated. Someone was approaching from beyond the door.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

Soon, the door opened and a presence appeared.

"Ugh. So annoying. How long do I have to patrol..."

With red hair and a somewhat frivolous face, a man appeared. He widened his eyes upon seeing Taesan.

"Oh, uh?"

"Hello."

Crunch.

As Taesan spoke while tearing off the zombie's head, the man looked puzzled and stuttered as he looked at Taesan.

"Oh, hello?"

[Your Insight has been triggered.] [Revevas Aita] [Level: 42]

Level 42. Fourteen levels higher than Taesan.

"Oh... You're a newbie? It's been so long, I was surprised."

Revevas scratched his cheek and looked at Taesan, then his gaze fell on the ghost. Revevas grimaced.

The ghost chuckled.

"Still causing trouble. You're still alive?"

"...Why are you here?"

With a furrowed brow, Revevas looked at the ghost.
