79. 14th Floor, Guide of Sin (2)

"Next... it's your turn."

The dark-haired woman who had fought Aldoata trembled at the gaze directed towards her.

"I... I don't want to. I don't want to go."

She showed a firm posture of refusal. Her eyes were filled with fear.

"What's wrong? This is... strange. I don't want to go."

"Then next is your turn..."

Everyone's gaze turned to the young man who seemed carefree. He had always laughed and enjoyed jokes, but now he shook vehemently and refused.

"I... I don't want to either."

Their gaze naturally shifted to the next person. But it was the same. They shook their heads with faces filled with fear.

The next one would probably be the same. The young man tasked with managing the second tier bit his lip.

"Because it's such a monster..."

To overcome them even at the 13th floor? It's impossible. Their judgment is not wrong. There's a difference between 13th and 20th floors like that between a child and an adult.
Here is the English translation of the text:

That's also not the difference between an ordinary child and an adult but between a 9-year-old child and a sturdy young man.

However, the result is a complete defeat. All five sturdy young men have been killed by the 9-year-old child.

"What are we going to do?"

"I don't want to."

"I... me neither."

Everyone refused. It was a cowardly reaction, and a natural one.

They became guides of sin not because they were inspired by ideology, but because they were terrified. It was because the threat of being killed if they refused was clear and unavoidable.

Even though they were only allowed up to the 20th floor, just staying quiet revealed their nature.

The young man let out a bitter laugh.

"Half of us are already dead."

Half of the companions who had been together for a long time had already passed away. Some of them didn't get along, but there was still an ugly bond. A sense of futility washed over the young man.

The young man managed to speak.

"Then let's all agree not to touch him, and when he comes up, let's hide and wait for him to pass."

"Uh, okay."

Everyone agreed. That's how it was settled.

"These miserable bastards are still the same, huh?"

A mocking voice echoed.

* * *

A man came up the stairs leading down to the lower floor.

He had a confident face and a muscular body.

And horns grown on his impressive head.

A scent of arrogance wafted around.

"Hello there, boys."

The young man swallowed and bowed his head. Following him, the other adventurers trembled and bowed their heads in fear.

"You've arrived."

"Yeah, you greenhorns."

The horned man, Magu, laughed and gestured.

"Hey."

A black-haired woman trembled.

"Come here."

"Yes, yes..."

The woman stood next to Magu, trying to conceal her trembling. Magu placed his arm around her shoulder.

The young man hid his irritation with a bitter smile.

Magu, the demon lord.

He was an adventurer permitted up to the third rank.

Unlike those who were only permitted up to the second rank, he was an adventurer who could see a bit further up.

But instead of descending into the labyrinth, he often came up to harass them, the adventurers of the second rank.

Honestly, it was very annoying.

Here is the English translation of the text:

If he's been allowed up to the third rank, why does he keep coming up to bother us instead of staying quietly on the 30th floor? If it were just about ability, he would have been torn to shreds dozens of times.

The guess wasn't off. There was no real difference between them and the third rank. There were just ten more floors to go down, and eventually they would hit their limit.

He came up because he was bored and enjoyed bothering them. I understood that, but from the perspective of those involved, I just wished he would drop dead.

Suppressing his emotions, the young man asked, "What's going on?"

"It's nothing."

Casually surveying them, Jagan opened his mouth.

"Why is everyone gone, and only half of you are here?"

In an instant, they were all shaken. Only the young man replied nonchalantly.

"They're all on other floors for the moment."

"Hmph."

Jagan chuckled and raised his hand. His fist struck the young man's face.

"Don't give me that nonsense. Seems like only you guys got the message?"

The young man bit his lip in pain. Why did he ask when he already knew? Suppressing his anger, he spoke up.

"They're all... dead."

"Oh?"

Interest sparked in Jagan's face.

"Even though they're just second ranks with no talent or strength, they got wiped out by the 13th floor?"


He mocked the guides of the second rank but did not disdain them. Surviving up to the 20th floor here was a testament to his own success, meaning he couldn't be ignored.

"Hmm."

Jagan stroked his chin in thought.

"If I kill that guy, will it change their evaluation of me?"

Though he was a formidable presence among them, being only one rank above didn't make much difference. After all, he was ultimately permitted only up to the third rankâ€”up to the 30th floor.

He grimaced.

"Why was that fool allowed down to the depths?"

Not long ago, a similar demon child had entered the labyrinth.

He had quickly descended to where he was, but honestly, he hadn't paid much attention. Instead, he had regarded him with contempt.

The reason was simple.

Though of the same demonic lineage, he came from nobler blood.

He was born into nobility even in the demon realm, while his counterpart hailed from the lowest of slums.

Yet that fool had been allowed down to the depths.

It was outrageous.

He wanted to kill him, but if he did, the leadership would surely have him killed, so he had no choice but to stay quiet.

So he changed tactics. He intended to prove his strength, his talent, to change the leadership's evaluation of him.
He who killed the adventurers of the 20th floor, despite being on the 13th floor.

He proves his strength by killing that guy. Although he is only on the 13th floor, he will still be evaluated in some way.

Jagan nodded approvingly as he made his decision.

"Good. Have him guided to me."

"Excuse me?"

Out of the blue, what nonsense. There was such a look. Jagan showed his teeth nonchalantly.

"Guide him because I'm going to avenge him. Or do you want to die?"

***

"Fireflies."

The ghost sneered.

"Even so, they gathered in groups of five despite their pride. It was too late to judge."

Five adventurers from the 20th floor. They were certainly threatening. Their defense and attack power were high enough to receive substantial damage.

However, the adventurers had never fought together, so their cooperation was clumsy. Each time they captured one, they leveled up immediately.

After leveling up, all their conditions were restored. This advantage allowed them to win.

"Great."
As many as ten floors were captured, so the overall increase was considerable. Their level was 28 before simply fighting them.

And now it's 39. It's risen by 11 levels. Naturally, their stats have also increased significantly to match.

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 39] [Shield: 169/169] [Health: 2020/2020] [Mana: 416/416] [Strength: 615] [Intelligence: 412] [Agility: 540] [Attack Power +69] [Defense +62] [The target is in optimal condition.]

"These stats aren't like those on the 13th floor."

Taesan whistled.

But it wasn't all good. He could have received the floor clear rewards properly so far because his stats were abnormally high, but his level matched the floor level.

However, if his level rises like this, the clear rewards will decrease significantly.

Seeing Taesan regret this, the ghost burst into laughter.

[Even if you think that, it's much more profitable, isn't it? Like a greedy person trying to take everything.]

"That's why."

Transcendent existence. Gods.
To get close to them, I really had to obtain everything. It wasn't just an attractive phrase to Taesan that he was much stronger than an ordinary adventurer.

Still, as the ghost said, gain was indeed gain. Fighting adventurers greatly improved the proficiency of his skills. On top of that, he managed to obtain one more piece of equipment.

[Ssokdok's Bead] [Magic +6] [Sound Magic +5] [A bead imbued with Ssokdok's sound magic.]

According to the ghost's explanation, it was a bead that increased both magic and sound magic by +5. To Taesan, it seemed like an insignificant item that he could offer as a tribute.

And he also obtained skills.

First, he acquired the basic hereditary skill of the wolf-human.

[Basic Hereditary Skill: Wolf-Human] [Mana Cost: 10] [Proficiency: 0%] [Transform into a wolf-human. Cannot transform yet due to insufficient special blood.]

As it was a hereditary skill, he could only pin it down unless he received blood without receiving any blood.

And next, he been
[Basic Magic: Scatter Granule] [Mana Cost: 4] [Scatters numerous ice granules colliding with each other. Inflicts greater damage on non-immune targets. Attempts to apply the [Frostbite] condition to the target.]

It was Taesan's first large-area magic acquisition.

The granules densely occupy space, greatly restricting movement unless there is significant physical force.

Though the damage isn't substantial, it holds value in its ability to constrain movement.

And another new skill.

"What kind of skill is this, anyway?"

Taesan puts his hand on the ground with a puzzled expression, grasping dried weeds soaked in blood.

"You have activated Verdant Growth."

The system window flickers as the dried greenery breathes new life.

After a moment, the weed appears fresh and vibrant.

[Basic Elemental Skill: Verdant Growth] [Mana Cost: 2] [Proficiency: 1%] [Bestows nature's mercy. Revives vegetation.]

"An elemental skill?"

A skill he encounters for the first time. The ghost began to explain.

"Do you know about elemental beings?"

"I have a rough idea."

"Then it's easy to explain. Think of it as similar to magic. At extremes, they can overlap, but unlike magic, they tend to be more nature-friendly skills."
"How do you learn this kind of thing again?"

"You have to meet spirits."

The ghost replied nonchalantly.

Spirits. It rang occasionally to Itaeyeon. But they all said they were hostile in the form of monsters.

"It looks like there's something else."

If you look for it downstairs, you'll find it.

"By the way, is this the end?"

The adventurers who had been appearing continuously were no longer visible.

"Because they checked the fever. They're starting to understand. That they're not dealing with opponents they can mess with. ...Right after they speak?"

Several signs of popularity were felt in the hearing. Taesan frowned at the number close to two.

"Is this the end?"

He took out his sword.

Before long, a creature with horns appeared.

The ghost leaked a smile.

"That's here too."

"Hello?"

A strong and deep evil power spread. Even Taesan, who had never seen a demon, felt it so much.

"Are there demons too?"

Taesan glanced through the room. About ten signs of popularity were quietly staying there.

'I won't interfere.'
Taesan stared at the demon before him with a serious look in his eyes.

Strong.

Qualitatively different from the adventurers he had seen so far. Even though he had grown stronger, he could feel a power that didn't guarantee an easy victory.

"Hmm."

The demon. Jagan stroked his chin. Looking at Taesan, he spoke.

"Who are you?"

His eyes became serious. When he first appeared, he seemed frivolous and full of complacency, but now he had disappeared inexplicably, replaced by boundless caution.

Jagan, who was looking at Taesan, cautiously asked.

"Are you perhaps the Dragon?"
