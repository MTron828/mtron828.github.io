**Chapter 472**

472. 89th Floor, Gosin's Outpost (5)

Taesan expressed gratitude, and Paradise's eyes trembled.

He couldn't understand Taesan's words. He had shown overwhelming, absolute power, yet he was expressing gratitude. It was a phrase that defied common sense.

But Taesan was sincere.

"I've finally gotten this opportunity."

He had always thought about it.

"I can't obtain all skills."

The numerous skills he had acquired in his past life.

Among them, there were certainly some he had to give up in this life.

"But there are skills I must obtain."

The multiplication and designated skill reset were too valuable. He was determined to acquire those two skills no matter what.

And he had a plan to do so.

Before leaving the labyrinth, he was determined to obtain them.

However, the other skills were uncertain.

Especially the temporary time stop.

The temporary time stop that could freeze time around him.

It was an absolute skill that could even affect the Sado.

But that was his limit.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Multiplying or initializing a designated skill's target was the world, but the range of temporary time stop was the universe.

It was a skill that intervened with the world itself, similar to a law.

And when one became a transcender or a high god, they could overwrite the law with a stronger one or even destroy it.

In my past life, I didn't know about this part. There was no need to worry about those who were stronger than the four gods.

But it's not the case now.

The current Taesan could easily win against the four gods.

His main enemies were the high gods.

It was likely that temporary time stop wouldn't work on them.

Of course, even so, the skill was still magnificent. At the immortal level, it was practically impossible to counter, and even transcendents would exhaust their strength trying to block it.

But the real problem was different.

There was no way to obtain it.

Temporary time stop was one of the most difficult and luck-dependent skills he had acquired.

Gathering thousands of projectiles that repelled each other in a limited space and fulfilling specific conditions was a task that was close to impossible."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Even if the conditions were met, it was not the role of talent or luck, but rather pure luck that was needed.

Resetting the multiplier or designated skills was the same condition, and I was confident that I could achieve it, but it wasn't a simple matter of time freezing.

After a long period of contemplation, Taesan had given up on the idea of time freezing to some extent in his mind.

But Taesan didn't care.

You can't have everything. To gain something, you have to pay the price. He gave up a few skills and gained transcendent strength that he couldn't reach in his past life. It was something to be celebrated.

But now, an enemy with the same ability as time freezing has appeared.

Taesan couldn't hold back his laughter.

"I'm thrilled."

A greedy gaze is directed at Paradise.

Paradise unknowingly took a step back. Taesan put strength into his legs.

Whoosh!

His body accelerates. Taesan swung his hand, and magic was unleashed into the world.

[You have activated the Chain of Corruption of Asmodeus.]

Chk-chk-chk!

Multiple chains are summoned and fly towards Paradise. Paradise regained its composure and simply dodged.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You activated Philzung.]

The chain immediately chased after Paradise.

"Tch."

Paradise, who had clicked his tongue, quickly dodged to the side. Since the chain had slowed down, it wasn't difficult to create some distance.

However, the chain continued to pursue Paradise relentlessly.

Even though it had slowed down, the chain's relentless pursuit until it hit its target was considerable pressure.

[You activated Limited Blink.]

Taesan moved in front of Paradise.

[You activated the Call of Destruction.] [You activated the Spark of Calamity.]

The two powers that called for the destruction of the world were realized and rushed towards Paradise.

The power of destruction wielded directly by the Transcender undoubtedly contained the power to destroy the world.

Paradise clicked his tongue and pulled out his gun. He realized that unless he got rid of those things, they would chase him forever.

He loaded the gun with bullets and completed the series of actions perfectly before raising the gun.

Ta-daang!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The bullet that seemed impossible to dodge drew a trajectory and flew towards Taesan, destroying all the numerous abilities that were chasing him.

Taesan didn't dodge or block it.

[Your first absolute nullification of the attack has been activated.]

"Haha!"

At the same time as the nullification was activated, Paradise's body trembled for a moment. His body was resisting the power that was trying to return him to his pre-attack state.

"How dare you!"

Paradise shouted loudly.

His physical body forcibly regained its stability.

"What's with this resistance?"

Taesan muttered to himself. It was clear that those who were close to the abyss and had a strong connection to it could resist the labyrinth's skills.

Taesan approached Paradise even closer. Paradise quickly finished reloading his gun, but didn't fire immediately. He dodged the attack and created some distance, and only after a certain amount of time had passed did he raise his gun.

Bang!

The bullet was fired. Taesan focused on defense, but the bullet that kept coming back scratched his arm.

[Your second absolute nullification of the attack has been activated.]

"Is there a cooldown or something?"

Paradise didn't fire the bullet immediately even after finishing his reload. He waited for a certain amount of time to pass, as if waiting for something, before firing his gun.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The power to turn back time had a cooldown period of a certain length after use, it seemed.

"About 10 seconds."

Tsk.

Taesan charged at Paradise. But as soon as he fired his gun, Paradise had already finished reloading and had created enough distance.

"You have an unusual power. But it's useless!"

Paradise burst out laughing and fired his gun again.

Until the bullet hit, Paradise's power turned back time. It was almost impossible to dodge.

Then, Taesan didn't dodge.

Taesan unfolded numerous barriers and wrapped his body in divinity. He spread them evenly across his entire body, leaving no gaps.

The bullet collided with the barrier wrapped around Taesan.

Ka-ga-gak!

Time turned back.

He repeated this countless times to find the answer. If he continued like this, he would eventually break through.

So, he devoured it.

Taesan called out blackness.

He created a boundary line and covered the bullet with it.

Ka-ga-gak!

Time turned back countless times.

But the ash-colored barrier did not break.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No matter how many times I repeat it, I can't find the answer.

The pupils of Paradise, who had been watching with a smirk, grew larger.

Ka-ga-ga-gaâ€¦.

The bullet ultimately failed to reach Taesan and lost its power.

Tsk.

"What's this."

Taesan, facing the flustered Paradise, unleashed his negation magic and dark magic.

He was certain about their recent exchange. Paradise had to fire a gun to block his attack, which meant that without authority, there was no way to counter his attack.

Then, there was no need to hold back. Taesan used his immense power to attack, and he pushed Paradise to the limit, staying out of the range of time interference.

Paradise had to use bullets to block Taesan's attack, so he couldn't put much pressure on Taesan. Taesan also used his boundary line to block the flying bullets, making defense possible without any issues.

After a long time of chasing and being chased, a flush rose to Paradise's face.

"Ha, haha! Finally!"

Paradise laughed and spread his arms wide.

"My lord! I offer this world to you! Please, defile this world!"

Kiiing!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The world has stopped.

Taesan quickly grasped the flow of time.

'5 minutes.'

Paradise used its power to stop time, and after 5 minutes had passed, it activated its power again.

The cooldown time for stopping time is 5 minutes.

The rough check was over. Taesan broke through the boundary and forcibly turned back the stopped time.

Although his power was nullified, Paradise wore a confident smile as if it had won.

"There's no chance of winning for you! Your power is certainly strong, but it also has a clear limit!"

It was already known that he could wield the strange, ash-colored power. It was just unexpected that it could counter the divine power to this extent.

But in the end, that power will be exhausted.

On the other hand, Paradise's power is infinite and does not exhaust.

In a long-term battle, Paradise will ultimately emerge victorious. Paradise had no doubts about this.

And no matter what he shouted, Taesan didn't respond and organized his thoughts.

Paradise's power can be broadly categorized into three types."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

One is the time interference in the surrounding area used for defense. The closer you get, the slower time flows.

The other is the power to rewind time used for offense.

The effect of the power is simple. It was a battle of probability.

No matter how low the success rate, if you repeat it countless times, the attack will eventually succeed, according to the logic.

That was the skill possessed by Lee Tae-yeon. It was similar to the principle of infinite possibilities.

The difference was that infinite possibilities required finding the probability and executing it directly, whereas Paradise's power of possibility forced time to rewind and made low-probability attacks succeed.

It was close to being overpowered, but there was a limit. The power could only be used with a gun.

Paradise's weapon, the gun. Despite having extremely high abilities, Paradise took its time loading the gun, as if performing a solemn ritual.

The fact that they took their time loading the gun despite being able to control time meant that the act itself was a necessary constraint for using the power.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a power that was certainly formidable. The self-transcendence that could block the full power of a high-ranking immortal ten times over was shattered in just two attempts.

If it hit, it would be difficult to show a good face, even if it was a mountain.

And finally.

The authority to stop time, boasting of its absolute effect.

Unless it was a boundary, it was impossible to nullify, and once used, it had a 5-minute cooldown.

That was the power possessed by the avatar of the gods.

"It's nothing," Taesan muttered.

It was intricate and unique. As a power close to the laws of nature, it was undoubtedly powerful.

But it was not a threat to him.

All verification was complete.

The rest was just a matter of him getting what he wanted."

Note: "ê³ ì‹ " is translated to "avatar of the gods", but it can also be translated to "divine spirit" or "godly essence", depending on the context.
