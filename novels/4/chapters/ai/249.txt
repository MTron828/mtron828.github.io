Episode 250

250. Community, players of the earth (1)

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard] : Ah, people have finally calmed down.]

She posted a relieved message. Until just now, the speed was too fast, making it impossible to specify the people she wanted to communicate with.

The fervor had cooled down a bit, and it was no longer like that.

Ordinarily, she would have given an order to keep quiet, but this time she couldn't for a reason.

[Geum Jung-geun [Hard] : The people we want to talk to have already talked, so it's about to calm down.]

After entering the labyrinth, she returned to the place that existed before her return.

As an American traveling in Korea, she had entered the labyrinth as a Korean. Immediately, some people from other countries among Korean players existed.

They were desperately seeking the well-being of their surviving family members in the community. The leaders of each country were so moved that they couldn't remain cold.

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard] : Then I'll invite them. Please speak up, countries that want to communicate.]
The community has expanded to allow people from each country to communicate with each other.

Then, it was impossible for the conversation to end simply.

[Oliver Khan [Hard]: I'll call.] [Daniel Darmon [Hard]: I'll join too.] [Ichijo Eika [Hard]: I'll join too…….] [Amelia Airline [Alone]: I'll call too. And you're all in solo mode, aren't you?] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Are we? We don't really understand such conversations well, but if you want, you can.] [Kang Tae-san [Alone]: Is the settlement complete?] [Kim Hui-yeon [Hard]: Uh, Tae-san.] [Kang Jun-hyeok [Alone]: I thought you were being quiet and making a move, but you were actually watching.] [Kang Tae-san [Alone]: It seems to be quiet. If we're going to have a group conversation, I'll call you too.] [Kim Hui-yeon [Hard]: Okay.]

Kim Hui-yeon started to organize the people.

Even people who seemed to be representatives of other countries also selected and organized the people.

[Kim Hui-yeon [Hard]: Then, I'll make it.] [Kim Hui-yeon created a group chat. Will you accept the invitation?]

Tae-san accepted.

Dozens of group chats were generated.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Danielle Darmon [Hard] : I'm feeling a bit better now. I can have a relaxed conversation.]

[Oliver Quinn [Hard] : That's right. Then I'll ask one question. What nationality are you? We're from the United States.]

The main point was immediately revealed. Kim Hui-yeon answered.

[Kim Hui-yeon [Hard] : We're from South Korea.]

[Danielle Darmon [Hard] : We're from France.]

[Eika Ichijo [Hard] : We're from Japan.]

The United States, South Korea, France, and Japan.

All four nationalities of people were gathered together.

Tae-san thought about their names.

"'It's like that."'

The remaining three were all people who were in Tae-san's memory. Only South Korea was involved with a high-ranking official. The other countries did not seem to have undergone significant changes.

[Oliver Quinn [Hard] : It's mysterious. I expected it, but it's surprising that we can have a conversation with people from other countries.]

[Kim Hui-yeon [Hard] : That's right......]

It was impossible to contact other countries. They thought they were the only ones who had survived.

But it wasn't.

There were still many people living in the world, and they were descending into a labyrinth.

This fact became a great strength for them.

After a brief pause, they introduced themselves to each other.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Oliver Cannon [Hard]: I am a leader from the United States. My name is Oliver Cannon, and I am 45 years old. I think it's okay to consider the people participating in the discussion as leaders from each country.]

[Kim Hui-yeon [Hard]: That's right.]

Other foreign players also agreed. Oliver Cannon was muttering to himself.

[Oliver Cannon [Hard]: I don't know who messed up the Earth, but if you're going to open a community, at least divide it by country. Why didn't you make it different levels? It's hard to understand.]

[Daniel Darmon [Hard]: That's right.]

[Kim Hui-yeon [Hard]: Despite that, the conversation itself is going well. I was worried that I would have to learn all the languages of other countries, but it's not necessary, and I'm relieved.]

There were also players from other countries who did not speak Korean, but all of them were able to converse without any problems.

So, I had expected it to be possible, but I was still a little anxious.

[Oliver Cannon [Hard]: But is this the end? What about the people from other countries?]

[Kim Hui-yeon [Hard]: Hmm... Let's go and see.]

They left the group and called people to join the community.

Ten minutes later, they returned without achieving anything.

[Oliver Cannon [Hard]: ...It's more dead than I thought.]
Here is the translation of the text:

As the community expanded, similar channels emerged.

A unified community where all people on earth gather.

And national communities where people from each country gather were born.

It's reasonable to say that the absence of a national community means there's no one to use it, which is equivalent to extinction. In other words, it was a wipeout.

The number of national communities was only around a hundred or so.

The number of countries on earth is 206. It meant that half of them couldn't survive.

As expected, the monsters were strong and humans were weak.

And in the chaos, people tried to achieve their desires by not trusting each other and joining forces, rather than combining their strengths to survive.

It wasn't unusual for countries to become extinct.

However, the shock of the difference between what was expected and what actually happened was a separate matter.

[Daniel Darmont [Hard]: It seems like other countries are having conversations with each other. But... surprisingly, many countries refuse to cooperate or use their own communities, ignoring our questions entirely...]
Here is the translation of the text:

The remaining people were not cooperative. There were countries that didn't trust other countries. And there were countries that ignored each other altogether.

However, they could enter each other's national communities and engage in conversations. Daniel Darmont entered the Chinese community to talk to someone.

But there was no response. It was as if the entire Chinese people ignored him. It was a chilling feeling.

[Oliver Kahn [Hard] : Don't bother with people who don't want to talk. I want to team up with people who want to survive.]

Oliver spoke harshly. Tai Shan smiled.

It was a familiar scene, as if nothing had changed.

The remaining three, excluding Kim Hwi-yeon, had discussed this combination in their previous life after expanding their community.

[Oliver Kahn [Hard] : Let's have a serious conversation from now on.]

They began to engage in conversations.
Here is the translation of the text:

Oliver Cannon: Is there a significant change in that maze? 
Kim Hui-yeon: No, the maze has not expanded or changed its layout. 
Oliver Cannon: Can't we meet in the maze...?

Only the community was open. The maze was still divided by mode and country.

Daniel Darmon: It seems like we can only meet on Earth. 
Oliver Cannon: Then the key is return. Do you think you and your country will cooperate? 
Kim Hui-yeon: Yes. 
Ichijo Eika: I don't think I'll refuse to come this far. 
Oliver Cannon: Good. Then let's talk individually. How many people survived, and among them, how many of each difficulty level? 

It was a rational statement. In order to unite our strength for survival, we first need to know each other's abilities.

They started talking individually.

South Korea had a total of 5.6 million people. 700,000 hard mode players survived.

Japan had a total of 50 million people. 1.2 million hard mode players survived.

And the United States had a number that exceeded imagination.

Oliver Cannon: 15 million hard mode players, a total of 360 million people. 
Kim Hui-yeon: That's a lot...
Here is the translation of the text:

Kim Hui-yeon was shocked. Originally, the population of the United States was about seven times that of South Korea. However, the number of survivors was incomparable.

Tae-san was also amazed. In his previous life, he had not survived with so many people.

"Is it because we're focused on South Korea?"

The power of the gods was invested in South Korea more than in his previous life. It seemed that other countries had more leeway in comparison.

[Kim Hui-yeon (hard): Wow, there are many...]

However, Kim Hui-yeon was unaware of this and was overwhelmed. There were many more survivors than in South Korea.

[Oliver Kane (hard): Korea has lost a lot, I'm sure it's tough...][Ichiyo Eika (hard): Hang in there, hang in there...]

People left messages of condolence. Kim Hui-yeon had nothing to say and remained silent.

[Oliver Kane (hard): But since we've managed to hold out with a small number of people, those who survived must be strong. How many floors have you reached in hard mode? We've reached the 30th floor.][Daniel Darmon (hard): Oh, it's the same in the United States. It's high. We're at the 28th floor.][Ichiyo Eika (hard): We're at the 27th floor.][Kim Hui-yeon (hard): What?]

Kim Hui-yeon was bewildered.

Oliver Kane asked with an interesting tone.
Here is the translation of the text:

Oliver Khan asked: How many floors is it? 30 floors? 32 floors? [Kim Hui-yeon replied: It's on the 38th floor.]

There was a brief silence after Kim Hui-yeon's post.

Later, Oliver Khan was shocked and posted again.

Oliver Khan: 38 floors...? Is this really true? Are you not lying? [Kim Hui-yeon replied: What's the point of lying like that? If it's a lie, you won't be able to survive.] [Oliver Khan: That's true... But how? No, it's even more difficult. There are only a few people who survived on the 38th floor.] [Kim Hui-yeon: Ah, that's it.]

Kim Hui-yeon spoke vaguely.

Kim Hui-yeon: It's a bit complicated, but let's just say it ended like that.]

Kim Hui-yeon also realized it late. That Korea has a unique situation in many ways, and that the Taesan is at the center of it. And that's what she meant.

However, she didn't explain it clearly. The Taesan is too special to be told to people from other countries.

Even if she says it, it won't be accepted, and it might even cause chaos. That's why Kim Hui-yeon didn't explain it in detail.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Oliver Cannon [Hard] : Is it possible for people to do that? It could be. We have too many people on our side, so it's actually safer.]

[Kim Hwiyeon [Hard] : If you need help with your strategy, feel free to ask. I'll answer if you're okay with it.]

[Oliver Cannon [Hard] : Thanks for that. Then I'll ask right away. I'm stuck on the 30th floor boss's strategy, can you help me?]

After that, there were various discussions about strategies. People from France and Japan also joined in, hoping to get some information.

[Oliver Cannon [Hard] : So that's what you're doing. That's okay.]

Oliver Cannon seemed to have obtained the information he wanted and posted a happy message.

[Oliver Cannon [Hard] : If we've reached the 38th floor, it will be a big help when we meet again. Let's expect it.]

Just as the conversation was about to wrap up, she joined in.

[Amelia Airin [Alone] : Is it over?]

* * *

[Amelia Airin [Alone] : Oh, it's so tedious and boring. I had a hard time listening.]

[Oliver Cannon [Hard] : Amelia......]

[Amelia Airin [Alone] : Why? What do you want to say? You acknowledged my authority until the end of the conversation, didn't you?]

[Oliver Cannon [Hard] : Whatever.]

Oliver Cannon seemed exhausted and posted a message. As the leader of American players, he seemed to be having trouble controlling Amelia, a player who didn't listen to his words.
Here is the translation of the text:

Amelia Airline [Alone] : Only the strong can survive. And the strong only emerge in Alone mode.

Overwhelming self-confidence.

And she had the strength to match it.

Amelia Airline [Alone] : Surviving at the level of Hard Mode in the world of Satchen is a sign that a strong person exists. Who is the one who was invited to Alone mode earlier?] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone] : Uh... who are you?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone] : Who are you calling?] [Amelia Airline [Alone] : It's still there. That's why.]

She said:

Amelia Airline [Alone] : The strongest human in the world. A person recognized for their strength by the existence of God.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone] : God?]

Lee Taeyeon was the strongest Alone mode player.

The reason was simple. She was the only one who had survived Alone mode. She was the only one who had cleared Alone mode.

However, she was not the strongest in the past either.

When Alone mode was descending in each world, and other people were also achieving significant results, excluding Lee Taeyeon. They were alive and not dead during that time.

Amelia Airline.
Before meeting her death, she was the strongest player in the game, playing alone mode at its highest level.
