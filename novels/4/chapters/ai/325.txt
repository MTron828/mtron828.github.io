**Chapter 326**

326. The 71st Floor, the Shadow that Devours Everything (2)

Taesan entered the darkness.

As he went deeper, he saw more and more shadows, and the shadows were fighting each other.

Kugugugung!

They clashed their powers and engaged in battle. The stronger shadows devoured the weaker ones, growing stronger.

And then, another shadow attacked from behind.

A shadow that had exhausted its power during the battle was caught off guard and instantly crushed.

A shadow that had succeeded in its ambush grew even stronger and moved freely.

The two shadows that had lost all their power slowly disappeared into the darkness.

"It's a jungle."

They devoured each other, stealing power from one another.

Taesan observed the process of shadows devouring each other.

The concept of power theft and the process. Taesan realized that he could understand it.

"It's similar."

The beast that craved life and had made a contract with Jinryong. The way it absorbed power by killing other players was not much different.

"Are they similar species?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The beast that craves life was originally a mortal existence.

It devoured everything and consumed all, relying solely on its power to rise to the position of an immortal.

[I don't know, either. There are hardly any who know where that immortal came from, right? The beast that craves life even devoured its own home and hometown.]

It left nothing behind. It put everything that reached it into its belly. That's how it grew to have the power to become an immortal.

[But... it does seem similar, doesn't it? Maybe it's a similar species, just like you said? Then, did the beast that craves life originally exist as a species unit?]

The ghost murmured with interest. Taesan advanced into the darkness.

Whoa!

At that moment, a shadow covered Taesan.

Taesan swung his sword. The rough sound and power clashed.

Kagak!

The shadow tried to devour Taesan, exposing its entire body. The power felt within was much stronger and larger than other shadows.

Taesan poured power into his sword and kicked out.

After a considerable amount of time, Taesan was finally able to knock down the shadow.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Your spiritual power has been activated.] [The proficiency of the Seed of Life has increased by 1%.] [Have you declared concealment?]"

“No.”

Taesan was still in a state of being obscured by the command. Taesan stepped on the scattered shadow.

“It seems it doesn’t work on someone stronger than a certain level.”

The shadow that was currently covering Taesan was significantly stronger than the other shadows. Even if a normal 71st-floor adventurer fought with all their might, it would be difficult to win.

The goal of the 71st floor was not to defeat the shadows.

It was to find a way to avoid the shadows and navigate through the darkness to find a path.

That was clear just from the strength of the shadows. Each one was slightly weaker than a Broken Man, and there were over a thousand of them. Defeating the shadows one by one was not a normal strategy.

But what Taesan was trying to do now was not a normal strategy either.

“There’s a limit to defeating small things.”

Experience points couldn’t be obtained from enemies below a certain level, and spiritual power upgrades were the same. If Taesan defeated a few dozen more shadows, both would reach their limits.

Taesan, who had quietly organized his thoughts, spoke up.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The strength of the shadows is all different."

There were those who could win easily, and those who struggled to defeat them. This was because the shadows were devouring each other to steal their power.

"Then, there must be the strongest one."

A shadow that had eaten many others, possessing immense power and ruling over this place.

The ghost nodded quietly in agreement.

"That's right, but how do we find it?"

The darkness here blocks our sight and senses.

Even if we activate the realm detection in Lelazie, the shadows will devour the detection power. And they'll rush towards Taesan.

For Taesan, who has a forced duel, it wouldn't be a big problem, but it would take time to handle over a thousand of them.

Moreover, we didn't know how vast this place was. It could be as large as a planet.

"It doesn't matter."

Is the power of realm detection being devoured?

Then, it would be a simple matter to pour out power that couldn't be devoured.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the Apocalypse of Darkness and Chaos.] [You have activated the King's Vessel.] [You have activated the Avatar of Nature.]

The power of the gods is bestowed upon Taesan. The King's Vessel descends, harmonizing with nature.

The Declaration of Concealment is shattered, and a powerful wave of energy spreads in all directions.

Dark shadows begin to approach, and Taesan summons his magic.

[You have activated the Domain Detection of Leraize.] [You have activated Forced Amplification.]

The magic is consumed in an instant. The enhanced detection, strengthened by the domain, spreads with a force that can destroy everything around it.

The shadows try to devour the power of detection, but it's futile. With three domain-enhanced skills activated, the power is greatly amplified by forced amplification, shaking off the shadows and spreading in all directions.

A vast amount of information floods into Taesan's mind.

The number of remaining shadows, the width and shape of this domain. It's as if he's walking and surveying the area with his own hands, with all the information neatly organized in his mind.

And as the domain detection spreads, something catches his attention at the edge of his perception.

A being with an enormous, unimaginable power that even Taesan cannot underestimate.

Found. Taesan has stopped the domain detection.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

As I turned my gaze, thousands of shadows rushed towards Taesan.

Taesan took a step back.

* * *

[Crunch.]

A massive shadow was quietly lying down in the abyss.

It was starving.

It was extremely hungry.

It wanted to fill this endless emptiness.

It quietly stirred its body. The shadows that made up its body began to split into thousands of branches, stretching out in all directions.

The shadow branches that pierced through the darkness rushed towards the scattered shadows in all directions.

The shadows resisted, trying to devour it, but were mercilessly trampled.

In an instant, over 50 shadows became a part of it.

[Crunch.]

But it was not satisfied.

There was no change in its hunger.

It had become too powerful.

The shadow born from the depths had reached the end of its species, devouring and devouring until it reached the limit.

From now on, no matter how much it ate, nothing would change. The shadow instinctively knew this.

The shadow was starving.

It had forgotten when it last satisfied its hunger.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If a strange being were here, I thought I could fill my hunger, so I came in, but nothing changed.

Yes. The being that called me here looked very delicious. If I ate it, I thought I could fill my hunger.

At the same time, I realized that it was an existence that couldn't be eaten. It had exceeded the line that I could handle.

That's why I didn't attack the strange being.

But if I continued to starve like this, I thought I should at least try.

It was about to fall asleep, regretting the past, in order to forget its hunger. It knew that it was the best way to forget hunger through its past experiences.

As its consciousness began to fade, it suddenly happened.

Kiiiiing.

A massive wave of power swept through the shadow and passed by.

Something had entered this place.

It wasn't particularly surprising. Weak and insignificant beings often invaded its territory.

It was so weak that even if it ate it, it wouldn't be able to fill its hunger, so it didn't even bother.

But this wave of power was different.

That power..."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The shadow rose up. It destroyed its surroundings, devoured the darkness, and burst forth with immense power.

* * *

Aaagh!

I blocked the shadow's attack and struck back with my sword. I poured all my strength into it and cut it down.

[You have activated Forced Duel.]

I defeated one shadow and activated Forced Duel again.

I ignored the thousands of shadows rushing towards me and charged forward.

With a skill like Sadohwa, the shadows couldn't stand a chance against me. I trampled and defeated them one by one, advancing forward.

How far did I advance?

Taesan finally stopped moving forward.

"I'm here."

[For a moment.]

The ghost let out a sigh.

[... What's this? That thing.]

Kagagagak!

A massive sound echoed. A gigantic shadow was rushing towards me from the distance.

It was devouring all the shadows in its path.

The shadows tried to resist, but they were swept away like animals in a natural disaster, overwhelmed by its immense power.

The shadows that had been rushing towards Taesan with greed suddenly scattered. It was as if they were intimidated by the massive shadow.

[The Shadow Ogre has appeared.]

Note: Sadohwa is likely a reference to a skill or technique in the context of the story, but it's not a real-world term.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The shadowy aura's torrent engulfed the Taesan.

Taesan infused his sword with power and charged forward.

Ka-a-a-ang!

A massive shockwave resounded, causing the space to violently tremble from the collision.

The shadow and Taesan simultaneously bounced back. Taesan gathered his strength.

"Strong."

If you only looked at his simple strength, it was even greater than the leaders.

[Is this not the 71st floor? What is this thing doing here?]

The ghost murmured in disbelief, having encountered a monster with power that far surpassed the 71st floor.

[Kar-r-r-uk.]

The shadowy aura quietly laughed.

The shadow began to spread out in all directions, slowly devouring the space.

Taesan laughed. This was a satisfying opponent.

[You are the Wind Spirit King. You summoned Minerva.] [You are the colorful shield. You summoned Valkazar.]

"Master, what's going on this time..."

Minerva, who was about to greet him warmly, stopped in her tracks upon seeing the enormous shadow.

"...What is that?"

[You're still fighting a unique existence. If you defeat it, that should do it, right?]

"That's right, but it'll be tough."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Barcaga claps his hands. The colorful lights pour down on the shadow.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The Shadow King's body trembles violently. Barcaga mutters in a puzzled tone.

[Why aren't you defending yourself?]

It was a simple test. If you had that much power, you could easily dodge or block it, but the shadow didn't.

They soon realized the reason.

Chomping sounds echo.

The power of Barcaga's attack is being absorbed by the shadow.

"......Huh?"

[Kar-ruck.]

The shadow charges forward with a rough laugh. Barcaga, who was watching in a daze, hastily releases a burst of colorful lights. Minerva uses that power to summon a gust of wind.

"Go."

Following her master's command, the wind becomes a blade and charges at the shadow.

Minerva has become significantly stronger by consuming the essence of nature. With Barcaga's support, she could even fight Vishnu again.

Qua-gwa-gwang!

The shadow's body is indeed pushed back by the wind blade.

But Minerva's expression remains stern.

"......Are you devouring my power?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Huff, huff.

The sword of the wind was slowly disappearing into the body of the shadow.

[Clang.]

The shadow was happily inflating its body even more. The shadow, which filled the space, rushed towards the great mountain."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
