**Episode 575**

**575. The God of Decline, the Usurper (6)**

**Whoa!**

[The proficiency of Ability Sword has increased by 2%.]

The swords clashed. Taesan activated his evasion skill. The Usurper's trajectory was distorted.

[This is ridiculous.]

The Usurper felt a strange, dreamlike sensation.

The overwhelming difference in power was still evident, even to others. It was unthinkable, no matter how he thought about it.

**Kagagak!**

But Taesan continued to dodge the Usurper's attacks and counterattacked.

[The proficiency of Ability Sword has increased by 1%.]

And finally, the proficiency of Ability Sword reached 80%.

At that moment, Taesan realized. Many things about Ability Sword had changed.

He didn't need to confirm it. His senses, his instincts told him what had changed.

[You have activated Strong Strike.] [You have activated Acceleration.]

**Kaang!**

One of the changed effects.

The power of Strong Strike and Acceleration had increased significantly. Taesan charged towards the Usurper even faster and stronger.

[Annoying.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The plunderer grits his teeth and unleashes his power fiercely. A black wave crashes down on the Taesan.

Taesan takes a step back and activates his essence destruction, opening a path.

One of the penalties for intense strength and acceleration.

If you don't time it right, the skill's activation will be canceled. It was a quite troublesome penalty.

And now, that penalty has been alleviated.

Quadruple!

The wave is broken, and the plunderer clashes with Taesan's sword. The timing was already broken, but the power and speed contained in that sword were still increasing.

With 80% reached, the effects of intense strength and acceleration have changed.

The power has increased, and even if you don't time it right, you can continue to activate it by consuming additional mana.

And now, the mana consumption is no longer a significant penalty for Taesan.

[What is it.]

The plunderer is taken aback. And Taesan takes advantage of that surprise. He quickly lowers his stance and raises his sword.

[You have activated Leap.]

Kaahhh!

The plunderer's body is lifted up.

The power of Leap has increased by nearly two times. The plunderer grits his teeth and launches himself. In an instant, he flies towards Taesan and pierces him.

[You have activated Stealth.]

Note: It appears that this text is from a fantasy novel or game, and the names "Taesan" and "plunderer" are likely character names. The text describes a battle scene with magical abilities and sword fighting.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Evasion required hiding one's body from the opponent to activate.

But it was no longer possible. Even though the usurper was staring at Taesan, his figure and presence completely vanished.

And it took even longer to re-identify Taesan's location after he disappeared.

Kagakagak!

The usurper barely blocked Taesan's attack. He twisted his sword and continued to attack.

[You launched a consecutive attack.]

Many sword trails were drawn.

And unlike before, all of those trails were real attacks.

Kagakagak!

The usurper poured his strength into it and swung his sword strongly, destroying all of Taesan's sword trails and charging forward.

Taesan didn't back down and swung his sword.

[You activated a slip-away.]

Kagakagak!

The usurper's sword blade grazed past Taesan's sword.

Kwaduk.

Taesan's sword grazed past the usurper's shoulder.

[How annoying.]

Emotion was evident in the usurper's voice. He pressured Taesan at an even faster and stronger pace than before.

Kaaaaaaang!"

Note: "Kagakagak" and "Kaaaaaaang" seem to be sound effects, possibly indicating the clash of swords or the intensity of the battle.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan blocked and dodged the attacks. He took advantage of the opening and struck. The usurper, as if annoyed, raised his hand. The dense, black aura within pressed down on Taesan's attack.

[You have activated Absolute Judgment.]

Whoa!

The skill has been activated.

A powerful shockwave swept over the usurper's body. The direct damage was inflicted along with the black aura that surrounded him.

[Replacement.]

As the proficiency of Ability Sword reached 80%, a new skill was also added to the swordsmanship.

Absolute Judgment was one of them.

Its effect was that when the opponent tried to respond to an attack with something other than their sword, the power contained in Taesan's sword would temporarily amplify to counter the opponent's attack.

Ability Sword was a high-level swordsmanship.

Although he hadn't used it frequently recently, he had used it a lot during the process of breaking through the labyrinth.

Even so, its proficiency had only just reached 80%.

The level of the skill itself was very high, and the change that occurred when the proficiency increased was significant.

And it didn't stop there.

[The proficiency of Ability Sword has increased by 2%.]

The proficiency of Ability Sword continued to rise.

[Hmm.]

The usurper fell into thought.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His current form was not suitable for facing Taesan. On the contrary, it was a form that made it easy for Taesan to deal with him.

He was different from Taesan.

There was no need to cling to his sword so desperately.

Giving up his sword and focusing on his pure strength to attack would be more effective in dealing with Taesan.

He knew that.

But the usurper couldn't make that choice.

It was because of his ego and pride.

If he didn't crush Taesan's spirit and body head-on, it would be meaningless. That's what made this battle meaningful.

Moreover, he had to crush both of them to fully devour him. Simply defeating him was not enough.

He would go this way.

The usurper made his decision.

And Taesan had also anticipated this.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

The battle was flowing in a direction favorable to Taesan from a certain moment.

[You have activated your landing skill.] [You have activated your consecutive attack skill.]

Ka-aa-ang!

With the enhanced power of his landing, his sword strike left an afterimage. The afterimage contained the essence of destruction, scraping the usurper's body.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There is no significant damage to the plunderer. No matter how much the essence is crushed, it's difficult to deal a meaningful blow to the consolidated body just by scratching it.

But it was clear that the plunderer was being slowly devoured.

It was enough to irritate the plunderer's nerves.

Kuuuuuuung!

The proficiency of the Ability Sword continues to rise rapidly.

The plunderer takes a step back, distancing itself. It holds up its sword and charges. The consolidated sword wave crashes down like a tsunami.

And the mountain was waiting for that moment.

[You have activated Forced Duel.]

Forced Duel.

The effect of the Ability Sword, transformed into a sword, is that when the opponent uses a sword, neither party can use anything else except the sword.

Once used, the plunderer will never be able to withstand it again. So, it was waiting for the optimal opportunity, and that was now.

Paaaaaaang!

The dark wave crashing down on the mountain bursts forth. With the proficiency reaching 80%, the effect of Forced Duel is also strengthened. Originally, it would have only been able to erase a part of it, but now it has made the plunderer's attack completely meaningless.

[What!]

The plunderer is truly shocked. The sword wave bursts forth, revealing its weakness."

Note: "Ability Sword" and "Forced Duel" seem to be specific terms or abilities in the context of the story, so I've left them untranslated.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan gave strength to his feet.

[You activated acceleration.] [You activated skill acceleration.]

He quickly rushed into the thief's arms. The thief quickly moved his sword, but Taesan was even faster.

[You activated multiplication.]

He poured all his physical strength into the sword and unleashed it.

Whoosh.

The sword pierced the thief's chest.

Taesan released all the power stored in the sword. His strength swept through the thief's internal organs.

[You.]

The thief's voice stiffened. He grabbed Taesan's arm. He held a black sword.

And the sword exploded.

Everything inside was blown away in all directions. Taesan couldn't dodge because his arm was caught.

[Your last chance has been activated.]

With the overwhelming power, Taesan's body moved automatically. The sword shook in an unpredictable trajectory. He blocked and deflected the explosion that was about to engulf him.

But it wasn't perfect.

The contamination began to corrode Taesan. Taesan strengthened his grip on the sword and forcibly broke free from the thief's restraint.

The thief's body trembled.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No matter how high the conqueror's level was, if they were to be directly attacked from within, the impact would be immense.

Ku ku ku ku….

The conqueror, unable to maintain their human form, began to crumble.

[……I acknowledge.]

The conqueror spoke.

Their voice was extremely low and eerie, making the listener's instincts tremble and their body shrink back.

[In this form, I cannot defeat you.]

No matter how high their level was, and no matter how strong they were, the difference in their ability to wield a pure sword was too great. They could no longer insist on maintaining their human form and sword.

[I will give up on devouring you completely. I'll just crush you physically.]

With those words, the conqueror's body began to swell.

Their condensed and compressed power suddenly grew enormous. The many things they had conquered, like a distorted monster, covered everything in their surroundings.

From the start, the human body was a constraint on the conqueror's true power. Taesan had dealt them significant damage. Now, it was difficult to maintain, and there was no need to do so.

This form was the conqueror's true self, capable of unleashing their full power.

Even if they had suffered great damage, it would be difficult for Taesan to emerge victorious."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, Taesan had also acquired something.

The proficiency of the Ability Sword continued to rise.

And at the end of it, he finally saw the end.

[Soul Swordsmanship: Ability Sword] [Proficiency: 100%] [A unique swordsmanship created by the adventurer of the labyrinth. It is based on the system of the labyrinth. It was created based on the swordsmanship used by the prince of the destroyed world. It can be used in conjunction with many skills.]

"Is this a soul skill?"

He had not reached the realm of the Transcendent.

But it meant that he had reached the realm of the Immortal.

This one skill alone could be called immortal.

The Ability Sword was the culmination of his swordsmanship concept. It wasn't a big surprise.

And what had changed?

Which skills had been integrated into the Ability Sword?

Taesan instinctively knew. He drew his sword.

[You have activated Addition.] [You have activated the Blade of Tenacity.] [You have activated Multiplication.]

Kiiiiing.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The sword contains physical strength. And it's controlled. The sword is perfectly filled, unshaken, and its shape is fixed.

It wasn't just controlled by the power of physical strength.

In the true sense, the increased damage was perfectly embedded in the sword.

The thief also realized that fact.

The fact that the sword contains physical strength with tens of thousands of damage, fully embedded.

And it was the Ability Sword that made it possible.

[...It's unbelievable.]

The skills of the labyrinth, like swordsmanship, have meaning in this level of battle. The thief couldn't accept it.

But it was actually happening.

The physical strength contained in the sword was stabilized. It wasn't one-time use, but could be wielded continuously without consuming it.

And with that physical strength and power, he could kill him.

[Good.]

The thief liberates himself. The mixed power sweeps away everything, and crushes it.

[Let's see the end.]

Kuuuuuuung!

The massive body crashes into the mountain.

The mountain also stumbles.

Kwaaaaaaang!

The collision spreads, and the shockwave resonates. It's a very deep and profound shockwave that even beings outside the crack can feel."

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan did not back down against the usurper's full power. The blow he dealt was not a small one, leaving a deep and lasting wound on the usurper.

To begin with, the usurper was in an unstable state.

Having absorbed too many powers and concepts of downfall, there was a limit to their control over their strength. This was further exacerbated by Taesan's blow, causing even more cracks to form.

Kwaaaah!

They charged forward, pouring in numerous powers to engulf Taesan and make him their own.

Taesan did not retreat.

He moved forward, and forward again.

And at the end...

Kwachik.

The sword pierced the usurper's very essence.
