Chapter 122

122. Choosing the King (3)

"Hold on! We haven't agreed yet!"

Seojangsan jumped up and shouted. Taesan smiled wryly and lifted his fingers.

"It's simple. You are not a qualified player recognized by the system."

Changing the king in the previous world had never happened. Many attempts had been made, but no one had succeeded.

Eiji, normal mode, hard mode players, including Taeyeon, had never changed the king, so they thought it was a meaningless clause. That's why Cho Jung-hyeok used the phrase "normal mode player" when killing Seojangsan.

Only qualified players can request the change of the king. And the standard for qualification was extremely high.

Not only had they cleared the trials of the gods, but they had also overcome the strengthened trials that had entered their hearts.

So, hard mode players, including Taeyeon, and even Kang Jun-hyeok, were not qualified. Although they had cleared the trials of the gods, they were not at the level that pleased the gods.

There was only one Taesan.

Taesan clapped his hands.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Okay, now I can change the king. Then won't the conversation become simpler?"

Gang Tae-san looked at Seo Jang-san with a playful gaze.

Seo Jang-san suddenly rose up with a fierce expression.

At the same time, Gang Tae-san's body moved. The chair broke, and Gang Tae-san arrived in front of Seo Jang-san.

"Hey!"

Seo Jang-san panicked and pulled out his weapon, but Gang Tae-san easily deflected it and grabbed his neck.

"Kk! Kk!"

He hit the wall and bounced back. The nearby players in hard mode quickly drew their weapons to attack Gang Tae-san.

[You have triggered a counterattack.]

The invisible power sent them flying.

"Whoa!"

"Ah!"

The charging figures crashed to the ground and fell against the wall, like mosquitoes hitting a fly swatter.

The conference room was quickly devastated, and Gang Tae-san spoke calmly.

"I can end it this way, but that's not fun, right?"

"Yeeh!"

Seo Jang-san lowered his weapon.

Gang Tae-san caught it and threw it away.

Kuda-dang!

"Ahh!"

Gang Tae-san stood tall, alone in the wreckage.

"That's why I'm giving you a chance. Let's have a go."

* * *

"It's fine too."

Here is the translation of the text:

At the city's park, Tae-san blew a whistle.

"Is that all?"

"Yes. That's all for me this time."

Seo-jang-san said confidently.

Behind him were over a hundred players. And all of them were hard mode players.

"You all..."

Kim Hui-yeon bit her lip. It seemed that all the hard mode players of the Yong-in were following Seo-jang-san's will, either explicitly or implicitly.

"I'll regret giving you a chance."

Tae-san said to Seo-jang-san. Take everything you have, use all your strength, and fight with all your might.

Seo-jang-san followed his words. His expression in front of Tae-san was bright. With this many people gathered, even if Tae-san was extremely strong, there was still a chance of winning.

"Then let's start immediately. Do you remember the conditions?"

"Defense is 0, and it's a one-on-one battle without injury. I know it."

Many players of the Yong-in were watching their fight, and most of them expected Tae-san to lose.
Here is the translation of the text:

Hardcore mode players were indeed very strong individuals. No matter how strong they were, they believed it was impossible for a single person to defeat hundreds of people.

"Ah!"

The first to move was a hardcore mode player.

He charged towards Taesan with his shield.

"'The opponent's attack power is 50, you know!'"

When Taesan attacked a hardcore mode player from Yongin, he showed a damage of 51. Xuzhangshan recalled this and told everyone:

"The damage is certainly high, but it's not on the same level as being unable to withstand it. First, I'll block the attack and then come up with a counterattack."

"I'm sorry to dash your hopes, but I didn't give you a chance for any other reason."

On the contrary, he was about to crush them.

Taesan drew his sword towards the approaching shield.

[You activated the "Plus" ability.]

Kwajik.

The opponent's body flew up into the air like a baseball hit by a bat.

[Kim Min-joong took 453 damage. Kim Min-joong was defeated.]

"It's flying far away."

Taesan shook his sword with satisfaction as he looked at the man who had fallen from the viewing platform at the edge of the city.

The hardcore mode players who were about to move were stunned.

"...?"

"If you don't come, I'll go."
(Note: The names "Taesan", "Xuzhangshan", and "Kim Min-joong" are likely fictional characters in a game or story.)
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san took a step forward. He charged towards the man who was closest to him. The man who was standing there blankly was startled and drew his sword.

Tae-san calmly brought down his sword to block the man's sword.

Whoosh!

The man's sword was broken, and he fell to the ground. Sand scattered everywhere, and the fallen man didn't move as if he had fainted.

[Kim Gu-han received 443 damage. Kim Gu-han was rendered powerless.]

It was a single strike. Suddenly, Seo-jang-san's expression changed, and he shouted out in a loud voice.

"What's with that damage?! Don't make a fool of yourself!"

Seo-jang-san remembered that when Tae-san attacked, the damage was 51. He had been unaware of the fact.

Tae-san responded to Seo-jang-san's outburst.

"I had to work hard to control it."

He attacked without using his sword, relying on his gauntlets, and his speed was very slow.

"Ah, Ah..."

Seo-jang-san finally realized the truth.

He believed that the damage at that time was Tae-san's actual strength. 51 was an extremely high damage, and it was incomparable to theirs. It was hard to imagine that he had withheld his strength.
Here is the translation of the text:

Since he believed he had a chance to win, he thought that if the damage was that much, they could hold on for a few hits, and if their defense was 0, they could still succeed in their attack and take the damage.

However, the power shown by Taesan was the kind that shattered the premise conditions.

"'Is the battle over?'"

Taesan moved. He kicked the player's neck, who was leaning against him, and sent them flying towards the building. Along with the sound, the player was slammed into the building.

And then, he swung his sword towards the opposite side. The player, who was holding a sword, was shocked and tried to block it, but it flew towards the other side along with the sword.

In an instant, all four of them fell.

"'Don't laugh!'"

West Mountain suddenly shouted in a loud voice.

"'I, we are hardcore mode players! We are those who have become stronger by staking our lives!'"

A declaration that contained all his confidence and self-respect.

"So what can we do?'"

Taesan casually disregarded his cry.

* * *

West Mountain's eyes grew hot.

"'We are hardcore mode players.'"

He couldn't just be powerless. They are strong people. Even if they lose, it's an unthinkable thing.

"'Everyone, snap out of it!'"

His fierce cry brought the hardcore mode players back to their senses. They stared at Taesan with eyes full of struggle.
Here is the translation of the text:

"No matter how strong!'

They are the ones who have risked their lives to descend into the labyrinth, among the top players.

As they regain their composure, they start to move. With their enthusiastic movements, they put pressure on the opponent.

"Ah!"

A man with two-handed shields dashes forward, making a "kunkunk" sound.

[Pakdaein activated his skill.]

Pakdaein's skill is a defensive skill that reduces the damage he receives, but it's not as powerful as his superior skills. However, it's still useful.

The opponent struck Pakdaein with his sword.

The man with two-handed shields fell to the ground.

[Pakdaein took 394 damage.]

"Oh, I survived!"

The man on the ground exclaimed, overjoyed to have survived despite being on the brink of death.

"What's the point of holding on?"

The opponent sneered, his eyes cold. Pakdaein was now severely injured.

"......Don't think you'll get away with it!"

The West Mountain, who had been watching the battle, shouted.

Pakdaein was the one with the highest vitality among them.

Even though he used his skill, he couldn't withstand it for more than two hits. This means that they are bound to be defeated with one blow.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san moved calmly. With a single blow, he shattered the obstacles in his way and began to gather them one by one.

"Ahh!"

A tall man with a long, flowing hair and a mighty cry rushed forward with a sword.

Tae-san roughly parried the attack and attempted to counterattack.

"You got hit!"

[Ise-han activated his "Flood" skill.]

Flood is a rare skill held by only a small number of hard mode players, and Ise-han was one of them.

Ise-han used this skill to win countless battles. He charged forward confidently, his eyes fixed on Tae-san's sword.

Tae-san's sword came to a halt.

He dodged the sword and struck Ise-han's forehead with his finger, releasing the Flood skill and swinging his sword.

Whoosh!

[Ise-han was rendered powerless.]

"Uhh..."

Ise-han collapsed to the ground.

It was as if he had simply given up. From a distance, those who were watching him seemed to think that he was simply rushing towards his own death.

Tae-san's sword moved with a loud whoosh. At the same time, the people who had been rushing towards him all stumbled and fell to the ground.

Tae-san did not stop.

He approached the man who was stumbling around, searching his inventory. The man, who had Tae-san standing in front of him, pulled out something and threw it at him, his face pale with fear.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Paang!"

The red powder spread rapidly. A man's face lit up as he shouted.

"It's over! Attack everyone!"

He threw a powder that dispersed the thoughts of monsters with intelligence. It was an item that scattered the minds of monsters with intelligence.

As it was worth 2000 gold, the man was able to barely obtain it with his entire fortune.

[Attempting to determine the state of confusion with Kang Tae-san...[No need to determine the state!]

"What are you doing that hurts your eyes?"

Tae-san frowned and brushed off the powder.

"Uh, uh?"

The powder pierced the man's chest, which was filled with astonishment.

After that, the one-sided battle continued.

"A, ah..."

Seo-jang-san couldn't believe the reality in front of him.

Hard mode players, who had descended into a labyrinth with a 1% survival rate, each had a hidden skill or two. Now, all of these people who were falling were people who had abilities and strength that others couldn't easily overcome.

However, they were all falling one by one.

"Now it's half of them."

Tae-san's face showed only annoyance as he said this.

His expression was like a grown-up dealing with a child's tantrum.
Here is the translation of the text:

"And the child was right there.

'A strong, great, and extraordinary hard mode player. What's the difference between you and the easy mode players who you look down on?'

There was none. To him, it was the same whether it was easy or hard. No matter how many gathered, it had no effect on him.

Snap.

Another hard mode player fell.

Their faces, which had been resolute and fierce as they fought to make a decision, were gradually becoming gloomy.

The people who were watching couldn't help but be shocked.

The people from Anyang, who had come together, were surprised, and the people from Yongin, who didn't know, were so shocked that they couldn't put it into words.

The hard mode player was able to easily handle the monster that was overwhelming, and even if a hundred of them came, they couldn't win.

Therefore, they followed without complaint or violence.

To them, the hard mode player was like a ruler.

But their hundreds, like they were powerless, were falling one by one.

It was like a fantasy.

'Uh...'

'This is it.'

Lee Taeyeon let out a stunned gasp. Kang Jun-hyeok let out a forced laugh."
Here is the translation of the text:

He was not weak. He was confident that he could win 1:1 against a hard mode player and even had a chance to win 1:2. However, compared to the great mountain, he was very small.

Even if he fought against the entire human race, he thought he would have a chance to win. He knew that he was strong, but he couldn't imagine that he would reach this level.

"...Can I reach this someday?"

He and the great mountain were players in the same mode. It was not impossible.

But it was too distant. He couldn't even imagine it in his mind.

While everyone had different thoughts, the battle continued.

And it was about to end.

The great mountain, standing among the powerless, didn't sweat a single drop. His breathing didn't quicken, and even the smallest imperfection couldn't be seen.

He was crushed.

"You're the last one, aren't you?"

The great mountain looked at the West Zhan Mountain, who was gazing blankly at himself.
