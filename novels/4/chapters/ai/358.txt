Chapter 359

359. 76th Floor, Guides of Evil (4)

The guides resisted the overwhelming cold. The black and white twins cancelled each other out and held hands.

[The black twin activated an unchanging bond.] [The white twin activated an unchanging bond.]

A powerful wave erupted from the black and white twins. It was a powerful emotion that could crush and trample everything, as if they were one.

"Whoa!"

Altiaur took a firm stance and unleashed his authority.

[Altiaur activated his innate origin.]

It was an ordinary authority, but it contained a power that no one could underestimate.

Altiaur had acquired all the skills he had obtained before and after becoming a sovereign, and packed them into one fist.

Helia solidified her entire body with a stronger blue blood.

The skill they had just activated was everything they had built up in the labyrinth. It was a power that symbolized who they were.

Crash.

But the moment they clashed with the ice, they were shattered into pieces.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Aaagh!"

The cold energy of the extreme cold seeped into his emotions, shattering the fist that contained all of Kwonseong's power and covering Altair.

"Tchajeor!"

Helia's entire body, wrapped in blue blood, was being destroyed.

"This can't be! This can't happen!"

He shouted in denial, but the cold energy calmly devoured him.

"Tchae."

All the cold energy converged, and the room fell silent. Taesan let out a sigh.

The world-altering power of the Sadohwa and the partial world change came to an end simultaneously. The immense power and vigor that had been embedded in his entire body began to fade, and a sense of exhaustion washed over him.

The cold energy that had covered the world began to pierce Taesan's entire body.

[What kind of power...].

The ghost let out a mournful sigh. He had invested all of his domain's power into the frozen world. He had summoned power from beyond the boundary of death, and through magic amplification and forced enhancement, he had amplified that power even further.

As a result, the guides of the frozen world, who had been consumed by the cold energy, were on the brink of collapse.

"Tchajeor!"

The ice shattered, and the black-and-white twins appeared. The two of them collapsed with pale faces. It seemed that further battle was impossible.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Huh, huh huh..."

Altair's entire lower body was frozen, and he let out a hollow laugh.

He was not much different from the black and white twins. Further battle was impossible. In reality, he was slowly dying.

"You're a monster. You're really a monster."

He had defeated the eight guides of guilt alone.

Although he had forced a one-on-one duel, he was only able to win thanks to Taesan's strength.

"I have no words left after being defeated so perfectly. You win. Adventurer."

Altair accepted his defeat calmly and closed his eyes.

Taesan stabbed him in the chest.

[You have defeated Altair.]

The black and white twins also did not resist. They acknowledged their defeat and quietly accepted death at Taesan's hands.

"Now there's only one left."

The most noble one. Helia.

He was in a more pitiful state than Altair or the black and white twins. His entire body was covered in blue blood, and his limbs were broken.

"...I cannot accept this."

He said, staring blankly into space.

"I cannot accept it! I! I!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He shouted with defiance.

"I have received the blood of God!"

He was fundamentally different from mortals like them.

He spat out the pride he had deeply believed in his heart.

"You're nothing! Your existence can't surpass me!"

Taesan drew his sword.

"You've lost. So, die quietly."

"No way! I haven't lost! I..."

Helian denied it until the end, even as he was dying.

Taesan's sword pierced his chest.

"I didn't lose......"

He died like that.

"This is the first time someone hasn't accepted defeat until the end."

[He was arrogant, more so than anyone, even more than me.]

The last guide died.

Taesan emerged victorious.

It seemed like a satisfied laugh could be heard from beyond the space.

[You have reached the optimal state.]

The restrictions on recovery disappeared. The fatigue and exhaustion that had been all over his body vanished in an instant.

Taesan leaned his back against the wall.

* * *

Leveling up resolves all physical and mental fatigue.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But despite that, I felt somehow tired. Taesan closed his eyes and took a short rest.

[Is it settled?]

"Moderately."

Taesan opened his eyes. The ghost smiled slightly.

[As I recall, there were about twenty guides. You took down eleven of them.]

More than half of them met their end at Taesan's hands.

[In fact, the group of sinful guides has come to an end.]

The absolute group that had controlled and managed adventurers entering the labyrinth for an uncountable amount of time, had now been crushed by Taesan.

The rest will either give up and flee, or find their own way.

[She hopes they won't give up and flee.]

The ghost murmured.

Taesan had won against the guides. And not just one, but eight.

The reward for that was by no means small."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Level: 155] [Shield: 15,800/15,800] [Health: 173,277/173,277] [Mana: 18,641/18,641] [Magic: 1,528/1,528] [Strength: 33,245] [Agility: 34,685] [Intelligence: 30,141] [Attack Power +8,695] [Defense +6,052] [The target is in the best condition.]

"Ha."

Taesan couldn't help but laugh.

All his stats had exceeded 30,000.

He raised his sword and swung it. The sword, which was clearly faster than before, let out a sharp whooshing sound as it sliced through the air.

With his speed and strength, it was now difficult to find an opponent who could surpass him.

In terms of physical abilities, it was almost impossible to find someone who could push him back. His stats were that impressive.

Of course, that didn't mean he was the strongest. Simple stats could be overturned by various factors in battle. If there was a significant difference in skill, even high stats wouldn't mean much.

Skill was what mattered most, so it was hard to say that he had become stronger solely due to his increased stats.

But still, stats were undoubtedly important. As a fundamental aspect of physical ability, the higher they were, the easier it was to gain an advantage in battle.

And the most important thing wasn't his stats. It was the skills he had acquired through his spiritual awakening.

He had defeated eight opponents.

The spiritual awakening had granted him a total of eight skills.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**Special Activation Skill: Mark Designation** [Proficiency: 1%] [Mana Consumption: 500] [Designates a mark at a specified location. Currently, only up to three marks can be designated. Once designated, the mark cannot be reset until the next day, and there are restrictions on movement distance.]

At first glance, this skill seems useless on its own, but when combined with other skills, its value increases exponentially.

**Special Activation Skill: Mark Acceleration** [Proficiency: 1%] [Mana Consumption: 50] [Uses the Mark Designation skill to accelerate the body and move to a designated mark. You can choose the desired mark to move to. There is a 1-minute cooldown after activation.]

I acquired the Mark Acceleration skill that Floria used to handle.

Taesan tested it himself. He designated three marks and activated the skill.

[You activated Mark Acceleration.]

His body accelerated.

Taesan instantly moved to the designated mark.

"It's quite fast."

Even with a proficiency of only 1%, Taesan's speed was unmatched, to the point where low-level enemies would think he had teleported. The cooldown was also very short, only 1 minute. It was extremely useful in many ways.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Of course, there were also drawbacks. Unlike random, limited blinks that jump through space, this skill was restricted because it was bound to movement, and if the space itself was blocked, the movement was limited. However, even considering that, it was a respectable skill.

[Special Passive Skill: Deeper Faith] [Proficiency: 1%] [A collection of madness-like faith. Continuously recovers one's own divine power.]

The great warrior's skill, obtained by defeating Gloria.

The effect was the recovery of divine power. Taesan's divine power was ambiguous, and it was unclear whether the skill would activate or not. But when I checked, it was recovering normally.

"It's quite fast."

Even though Taesan's current divine power was not small, it was recovering at an extremely fast rate.

At this rate, even without direct faith, I could handle divine power more frequently.

Divine power was an essential force for future battles. Once consumed, it took a long time to recover. A skill that assisted with that was definitely necessary for Taesan right now.

[Special Passive Skill: Apocalypse's Offspring] [Proficiency: 1%] [Obtained by devouring the remnants of destruction. Can handle the power of destruction more freely.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The skills related to Taesan's destruction were the Ember of Calamity and the Call of Destruction. Both had tremendous power, but since Taesan couldn't handle them properly, they didn't have a significant effect.

A skill that helps to use those skills more freely and strongly. It seemed like it would be helpful to think of it that way.

The following is a skill obtained by defeating Estevan.

[Special Activation Skill: Forced Return of All Summoned Creatures] [Mana Consumption: 1,000] [Proficiency: 1%] [Forces the return of all summoned creatures within a certain range, without exception. If the summoned creature is strong enough, it can resist.]

This was the skill Estevan used to reverse-summon Minerva in the end.

Right now, with a proficiency of 1%, it doesn't have a significant effect, but considering that it can even reverse-summon the Spirit King, it's worth investing in.

[Special Activation Skill: Mental Burden Shift] [Mana Consumption: 300] [Proficiency: 1%] [For 30 minutes, shifts some of the mental burden to the physical body.]

It was an easy-to-understand explanation. Considering that the burden on the mind is greater than the burden on the body, even in the case of black and holy magic, it seemed like it would be helpful to activate it at a critical moment."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The leader of the guides had a skill that was not inferior in terms of numbers to be used in the final battle.

'As expected.'

The skills of the deep-sea adventurers were each extremely useful.

Taesan was satisfied and checked the remaining skills.

[Special Activation Skill: Merge into One] [Mana Consumption: 1,000] [Proficiency: 1%] [Merges two equal objects into one.]

A brief description.

That alone was enough for Taesan to understand. He knew it was a skill he couldn't use.

The twins had used this skill to merge into one.

As a result, even without using other skills, they were able to catch up to Taesan in terms of power and speed.

There was no cooldown, no risk, and no duration. It was a skill that was close to perfect in terms of pure enhancement.

It was undoubtedly an excellent skill, but the condition was too harsh. Merging two equal objects? It was almost impossible unless you were born as twins like them from the start.

But Taesan quietly examined the skill.

Two equal objects.

The condition was just one.

Then, it wasn't impossible."
