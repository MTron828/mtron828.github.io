**Chapter 402**

402. 81st Floor, Advanced Magic (2)

"Take a break for now. I'll be staying here for a long time, so take a look around. If you have any questions, feel free to ask anytime."

With that, the magicians dispersed.

Taesan did as she said and first explored the magic tower.

The magic tower was enormous and tall. Its end was invisible, and there were countless rooms that couldn't be counted. Each room had its own unique features. There were rooms like laboratories with all sorts of experimental tools, and rooms with hundreds of magic circles densely drawn.

The number of magicians in the tower was considerable.

There were over a hundred, and most of them were training their magic, paying no attention to Taesan.

Taesan walked down the corridor. A man with red hair, walking from the opposite direction, frowned when he saw Taesan.

The man, who seemed to dislike Taesan, muttered to himself in a tone mixed with annoyance and passed by Taesan with a scowl.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even if Zelvand accepts it, we don't recognize you. Don't be reckless."

He warned in a whisper. Taesan, who had been gazing at his back for a moment, continued to stroll around the tower without a care.

"They can't see you."

[It's not like the labyrinth's existence can see me. The old man in the center didn't seem to be one.]

Many gazes were fixed on Taesan.

Instead of approaching Taesan, the wizards used magic to observe him. Most of them showed curiosity or indifference.

Of course, there were some who revealed hostility.

Taesan pretended not to know and spent the day leisurely.

"What is this place?"

He arrived at a library filled with countless magic books. Compared to the library of the heavens, it was small, but there were still books that would take a lifetime to read.

"Oh, hello?"

A woman appeared on the ladder of the bookshelf, smiling brightly. She was the only wizard who showed affection towards Taesan.

"Heh heh."

She jumped down from the ladder, and the numerous dolls below gently caught her.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The woman who came down from the doll unfolded her clothes and asked,

"Have you looked around enough? What's the atmosphere like?"

"Some of them showed hostility towards me, but most of them were indifferent."

"Is that so?"

The woman let out a sigh.

"It's not often that a new magician comes in, so can't you just accept them a bit? We're not going to be together for long anyway. You're just being stubborn for no reason, right?"

She grumbled for a bit and then smiled faintly.

"So, what brings you here?"

"I was wandering around and discovered this place. What kind of place is this?"

"As you can see, this is a library. There are many magical books stored here, including cursed or sentient ones, so you need to be careful."

"I see."

Taesan looked around the library. As the woman said, he saw magical books with special powers, but there was nothing particularly remarkable.

"Well, that's good. You guys, try a bit harder."

The woman clapped her hands.

At the same time, a wave of mana in the form of threads spread out from her.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The dolls infused with mana began to move on their own, searching through the bookshelves. In an instant, dozens of books piled up in front of Taesan.

"These are well-organized, great books for accumulating knowledge. Why don't you read one?"

"......Thank you."

There were too many.

Just reading them would take a considerable amount of time. Taesan didn't plan on staying here for that long.

After briefly flipping through the books, Taesan asked,

"You're a doll maker, aren't you?"

"That's correct."

The woman smiled slyly and snapped her fingers. The dolls began to pair up and dance a gentle waltz.

"I handle specially crafted dolls. I can control over a hundred dolls at once. Isn't it interesting?"

"That's unique."

A doll-controlling magician? Taesan had never seen one before. The woman shrugged her shoulders.

"You can learn Gerband's magic here. Most magicians learn that. But a few of us, including me, are different. Instead of relying on Gerband's power, we create our own magic. The eight magicians who said they would test you are all like that."

"Is it really necessary to create your own magic?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Zelvand is a god of magic. His magic was flawless and unparalleled. Elia scratched her cheek with an ambiguous expression.

"This is a difficult thing to say, but we're stuck in a wall."

Elia waved her hand, and a huge wave and a blue light window appeared.

"This is intermediate-level magic."

Taesan didn't know the magic, but he could sense the energy and knew it was on par with the frozen world or the starlight arrow.

"Oh, you noticed? I thought maybe, but it's the real deal."

Elia exclaimed, waving the window.

"Up to this point, we've been allowed to do this, but... anything beyond this is not permitted..."

Elia smiled wryly.

Taesan knew what she meant by "beyond this".

"Is it advanced magic?"

"Yes. We think we're qualified, but it seems Zelvand doesn't think so."

That's why they were creating their own magic, not Zelvand's magic.

"So, among the wizards who said they'd test you, there are those who are jealous of you, you know."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"After staying here for a long time and learning magic, but not being allowed to use high-level magic, Taesan, an outsider, was immediately granted permission.

It didn't seem strange even when he showed hostility.

"Are you one of them too?"

"No? I just thought it was interesting and decided to participate, and I wanted to help you too. The guy lying down over there, pretending to sleep, is a magician who controls plants. He's one of the seven magicians. He's a suspicious guy, so be careful."

The woman whispered, looking at the man lying on the sofa. A voice mixed with annoyance came from the man.

"You're selling out other people's information? What's your goal, Elia?"

"What's the big deal? You'll find out anyway."

"That's true, but we're examiners. We need to verify what kind of power we have and how we use it through this test."

"That's too harsh, isn't it? You could have told us this information beforehand."

The woman, called Elia, grumbled. The man sighed and got up.

"Anyway, from now on, don't talk about other magicians. It's his job to figure that out."

"Okay, got it."

Elia reluctantly nodded her head.

"That's not it."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But Taesan already knew everything about the two of them from the moment they entered this place.

He knew the flow of mana they possessed and how they controlled it. Everything was visible to him. They had also set up their own protection to hide from others, but to Taesan, it was as if it didn't exist.

Although he didn't know exactly what kind of magic they used, he had already grasped the direction and properties of it.

"Ah, I forgot to introduce myself."

The woman let out a proud cough and placed her hand on her chest.

"I am Elia Magatri, the owner of the Marionette School and one of the eight magicians recognized by the God of Magic."

"I am Constria Veriel, the owner of the Rocquest School and one of the eight magicians recognized by the God of Magic."

Constria gazed at Taesan with a serious expression and asked,

"What's your name?"

"I'm Kang Taesan."

"Kang Taesan. Leave this place immediately."

"Constria?"

"This is not a warning, but advice. I don't sense anything from you."

Constria spoke bluntly."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Being recognized by the God of Magic means you have an extraordinary talent that surpasses ours. There's nothing to say about that. But you're too weak."

Taesan gazed at him quietly.

Constria thought that silence had pierced his heart, and continued speaking.

"Your friend Elian is a special case, but most people here don't allow outsiders like you. Especially if you're weak, it's even more so. Moreover, everyone here has reached a high level. No matter how talented you are, if you're as weak as you are, you can't learn anything."

Saying so, Constria turned his body and headed out of the study.

"Leave now and live your life. This is the advice I can give you."

The door closed. Elian, who was left alone, scratched his head with an embarrassed face.

"Hmm... the words are a bit harsh, but they're not entirely wrong. But it's okay! I'll help you!"

Elian clenched his fist tightly.

"If you're allowed to use advanced magic, it means Lord Zelvand has recognized your talent. If you just endure for a few years, other magicians will recognize you too!"

"Is that so."

Taesan finally realized why the conversation had gone awry somewhere.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They didn't know much about Taesan.

Although he seemed powerless at the moment, he was recognized for having the talent to learn advanced magic from Jervand, and was thought to have entered this place.

Taesan was currently using his authority seal, hiding all his power. If he wasn't an equal existence, he would appear as an ordinary human. That's why Elia said she would help him and stay with him for a long time.

"How annoying."

There was no reason to stay for so long.

But that didn't mean Jervand wanted to release the authority seal.

After finishing his thoughts, Taesan asked Elia.

"Is the test something that can be taken whenever I request it?"

"Hmm. Yes. Whatever Jervand-nim says, we don't have the right to refuse. But it's impossible to pass right now, so let's train slowly and..."

"No."

Taesan shook his head.

"I'll take the test right now."

"Huh?"

Elia's pupils widened.

* * *

"Already taking the test? What's the hurry?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

One magician grumbled. Inside the magic tower, there was also a room for dueling. In the spacious room, eight magicians and Taesan gathered.

"Elia, you said you'd take care of it. What did you say?"

"No, I tried to stop him, but..."

Elia scratched her cheek with an ambiguous expression.

When Taesan suggested taking the test, she refused, saying it was meaningless at this point.

But Taesan didn't back down.

Taesan was brought here by Zelvand, so Elia had no choice but to step back.

"So who's going to do it?"

"Hmm..."

"It's a hassle..."

"I'll go."

A man stood up.

He was a man with red hair, who showed the greatest hostility towards Taesan. He walked towards Taesan with a sly smile.

"Why is he so enthusiastic?"

"He's always whining about wanting to learn advanced magic. It's no wonder he's disliked."

There was no expectation. Since Taesan had detected him at their first meeting, they all knew Taesan had no power.

"Why did Lord Zelvand bring such a weak guy? He seems to have talent, but he's too weak."

"Do you think he's weak?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Huh?"

The old man, who had been quiet until now, opened his mouth. The wizards were taken aback and asked.

"Isn't it obvious? I don't feel anything from him."

"Elijah, you were the closest to him. What do you think?"

"Huh... I don't know either. It feels like he's hiding something, but it's not that impressive."

Elijah shook her head. She had also tried to grasp Taesan's power right next to him. But she really didn't feel anything.

"I see."

The old man gazed at Taesan with a curious expression.

"Amazing. What kind of method did he use to hide it so perfectly?"

"Huh?"

"You'll see."

The man with red hair arrived in front of Taesan. His eyes were filled with hostility.

"You trash."

His voice was filled with hatred and animosity.

He had dedicated his entire life to magic.

Literally, he had abandoned his family, friends, lover, and even his own life, betting everything on a single magic.

With such obsession and achievement, the man was recognized by the magic god and was able to enter the magic tower.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He, who had entered the Magic Tower, was extremely proud of himself. He was one of the few magicians recognized by the great God of Magic.

He had only recently entered the Magic Tower, so he was deeply absorbed in his own pride.

Just then, Taesan entered the Magic Tower.

A powerless person, yet recognized by the God of Magic and granted a high-ranking position.

The man couldn't tolerate Taesan's existence.

Just by being here, Taesan was undermining his authority. He couldn't allow this person to further pollute the air here. The man thought of expelling Taesan from this place.

However, expulsion was impossible. The God of Magic had directly permitted Taesan's existence.

Then, he would make Taesan leave on his own.

The man sneered and shouted.

"I am Butler Raven, the founder and only magician of the Butler School! I will test you!"

Butler shouted and gathered his mana.

Then, the space around Taesan began to distort.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Butler had mastered the magic of manipulating space. He could fold space to jump long distances, twist space to make attacks miss, or even launch direct attacks on his opponents, making him a magician of the highest level.

What Butler did to Taesan was first, a seal of movement.

And then, pressure.

Crushing.

Taesan was unable to move as Butler blocked his space. And then, little by little, he applied pressure. He made Taesan's breathing difficult and his entire body's muscles ache to the point of agony.

Taesan didn't show any signs of movement.

Butler twisted his lips. Right now, Taesan must be feeling a pain similar to being tortured, with his entire body bound and helpless. Elia, who was watching from behind, scrunched up her face.

"That's too much."

As she was about to stand up, a staff blocked her way.

"Old man?"

"Just watch. There's no problem."

The old man was gazing at Taesan with a calm eye.

Crushing.

The pressure of space was getting stronger and stronger.

Butler was thinking of wrapping things up soon. Any more pressure could be life-threatening.

"That should be enough of a threat."

If he released the magic, Taesan's expression would change in an instant, and he would cower in fear. Butler was about to release the magic with anticipation.

"Is this it?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan murmured.

He moved his hand, feeling the pressure of the space.

"Indeed, it's quite unique. At least, it's a magic I can't handle."

"What, what!"

Butler's pupils enlarged.

Right now, he was grasping Taesan's entire body. He couldn't even move his body, let alone change his expression, or it would be abnormal.

But Taesan was calmly touching the distortion of the space, as if taking a stroll.

"What is this!"

Butler roughly pulled out his power.

A massive sphere of space formed around Taesan. The space itself was distorted, creating an environment where life couldn't survive even for a moment. The scenery was twisted, and the landscape was mixed up.

In that distorted space, Taesan's appearance didn't change even a little.

It was as if he was untouched.

"This is……."

"It's a magic test, so using magic is correct, isn't it?"

[You activated magic overlap.] [You activated distortion.] [You activated distortion.] [You activated distortion.]

Mana is condensing.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Those who were watching held their breath. A massive wave of mana suddenly gathered from Taesan, who didn't seem to be feeling anything.

It was a high-dimensional, incomprehensible magic, even to them.

The condensation of mana alone was causing cracks in the spatial fabric.

The old man's eyes gleamed.

[You have activated magic release.] [You have activated partial tuning of magic.]

The distortion of space crushed the spatial fabric.

* * *

"Ugh!"

Bartler spat out blood and collapsed. He had tried to handle magic beyond his limits, and it had backfired.

"This is... unbelievable..."

Constria let out a sigh.

Intermediate-level magic. Distortion. It was magic that they could also handle.

But the power displayed by Taesan before their eyes seemed absolutely unattainable.

All the magicians, except for the old man, were speechless at the sight before them.

"Who's next?"

Taesan's voice echoed in the silence.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
