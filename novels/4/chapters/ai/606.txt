[Calculation Complete] [23p will be paid.]

The familiar landscape appears along with the system window that blocks my view.

A narrow space made of gray bricks.

There were many people there.

"Ah...”

"I'm alive. I'm alive...”

The sounds of relief and tears fill the air. People collapse to the ground. The joy of having survived and the despair of having barely made it fill the space.

Taesan also lets out a sigh and sits down.

"I managed to survive, at least."

But he didn't accomplish anything.

He closes his eyes.

The third return to Earth.

They trampled on countless deaths and returned to the labyrinth.

* * *

One day.

It was a peaceful moment, a new year's moment when everyone was looking forward to the future.

The sky split open and a monster appeared.

The terrifying monster, like something out of a movie, began to trample and destroy the earth.

In the midst of confusion and chaos, a translucent window revealed a brutal truth.

Your world is being invaded.

If you do nothing, it will be destroyed.

But I will give you a chance.

Cultivate your strength and reclaim the earth.

And they were given four options.

Easy, Normal, Hard, and Alone mode.

Taesan chose Easy mode.

And so did the vast majority of people. It was only natural. In a state of confusion and fear, it's extremely rare for someone to take a step forward on a thorny path. They would rather take a narrow path, driven by fear.

Without even knowing it was a trap.

They, who had been abandoned by their mothers, fought for their lives.

For the first time in their lives, they staked their lives and defeated the monsters.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

At first, players in easy mode thought their choices were correct. However, through communication with the community, they realized that other modes were extremely difficult.

Easy mode was challenging, but there was no great risk to their lives. As long as they didn't get confused and kept their cool, they could survive.

They began to have hope.

But that hope was shattered after returning to Earth.

Taesan closed the system window. 23 points. It was a pitifully low score.

Still, he thought his situation was relatively good. Other people in easy mode probably had single-digit scores.

But it was all meaningless anyway.

Taesan leaned his back against the wall.

At least he had survived.

But he didn't know if he could survive the next return.

He ate with a bitter smile. The only advantage of easy mode was that there was no shortage of food.

As he slowly ate, he heard the sound of wailing from around him.

"I hate this......"

"I just want to give up. Why is this happening......?"

It was a sorrowful sound that scratched at the listener's emotions.

They were trapped in despair and couldn't think of a way out.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan, who had just finished eating, opened the community. After returning, he wanted to check the status of other modes.

But that was ultimately a wrong choice.

[Jo Min-joon[Easy] : Everyone, I'm sorry for the trouble. I'll get us out of this hell.] [Kim Si-woo[Easy] : Ye-eun, I'll go first.] [Lee Jun-seok[Easy] : Parents, I'm sorry.]

What appeared was a will announcing their deaths.

And it wasn't just one.

There were over a hundred.

The last remnants of those who had chosen to die themselves.

"Pathetic."

Taesan clicked his tongue and closed the community. There were those who left wills every time they returned, but this time it was especially severe.

"Well, they're all dead anyway."

"That trash, Choi Jung-hyeok."

Taesan let out a sigh.

He was a player who had dominated the Easy mode and had even influenced other modes.

In his second return, he waged war against Hard and Normal mode players, killing many Hard mode players, including Seo Jang-san.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"After that, Taesan directly killed him in the labyrinth, but the aftermath was already severe. The strongest ones had died in the internal conflict, so there was no way to turn back. When they returned for the third time, they had to pay the price.

Taesan got up from his seat and climbed the stairs. No matter how far he climbed, all he saw were players filled with despair. Taesan, who had become numb, approached a woman.

"Cho Ji-young."

"...Ah, Taesan."

A tired-looking woman in her late 20s greeted Taesan.

After Taesan killed Choi Jung-hyuk, the Easy Mode was in chaos. Whether it was good or bad, he was the owner of Easy Mode.

To resolve the chaos, an administrator was needed.

Taesan was impossible. He had killed many Easy Mode players while capturing Choi Jung-hyuk. It was an unavoidable act, but he was ultimately a murderer. He couldn't become an administrator.

Cho Ji-young was the one who took responsibility and sat in that position.

"What's the situation?"

"It's the worst. What can I say."

Cho Ji-young forced a smile.

"Too many people have died. There are even people who are committing suicide now, and I can't handle it."

Despite always looking exhausted, she had an unbroken hope.

A hope that someday they could survive and live a peaceful life."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, I took on the role of administrator in Easy Mode after Choi Jung-hyuk's death.

But her face no longer showed any hope.

"How many people have died... I don't know. I don't even want to know."

"That's your role, isn't it?"

Identifying the dead and understanding the layers of the labyrinth. That's the administrator's role.

Choi Ji-young shook her head.

"Is there any meaning? No, there isn't."

Her face, which was answering her own question, was distorted with despair.

"It's all meaningless. No matter how hard we try, we're just in Easy Mode. We can't even play the role of a meat shield properly! Everything we do is just child's play!"

Choi Ji-young exclaimed in desperation.

"That's what really happened! Kim Hwi-yeon died! Because we didn't do our job! The person who trusted us died!"

"......"

Taesan silently listened to her outburst. After a moment, he asked her in a calm tone.

"So, are you going to give up?"

"......I don't know."

Choi Ji-young was exhausted.

"I don't know. Nothing."

The conversation was not making sense. Taesan went down to the labyrinth and opened the community forum."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Many messages were flooding in, and finally, a normal conversation was starting to appear.

[ITaeYeon[Alone] : Ah. I hate it. I hate it... I have to go down to the labyrinth again...]

ITaeYeon, an adventurer in Alone mode, was a player who couldn't even do easy mode at first, but was now slowly showing her skills.

According to Taesan, she hadn't even cleared the 10th floor yet.

On the other hand, Taesan had already cleared up to the 50th floor. The difference was more than five times.

Despite that, ITaeYeon had an overwhelming strength that couldn't be compared to Taesan.

"...Status window."

[Taesan] [Level: 27] [Health: 431/431] [Mana: 140/140] [Strength: 31] [Intelligence: 30] [Agility: 40] [Attack Power +12] [Defense +22] [Target is in a depressed state.]

The stats were ridiculously pathetic.

I couldn't help but laugh.

Even if I cleared the labyrinth, there wouldn't be a big difference with these stats.

I'd be lucky to be able to defeat a single weak monster.

That was the limit of easy mode itself.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taeyeon and the hardcore mode players were frustrated by the difficulty of the labyrinth, but Taesan was even more frustrated than them.

"You can become stronger, can't you?"

"If you try hard and risk your life, you can become even stronger, can't you?"

"I have nothing."

Even if I conquer the labyrinth, I won't be able to reach their level.

Because he's in easy mode.

Inferiority complex, powerlessness, and anger swirl around him. A single choice had distorted everything.

"......What should I do?"

He leans against the wall, feeling helpless.

It's pointless to try to clear the labyrinth. Even if I reach the 100th floor, I won't be able to achieve anything.

This place is a cradle.

It gently wraps around them, blocking all paths to growth, a cradle of death.

Taesan spent his time feeling helpless like that.

And soon, he heard the news that Choi Ji-young, the administrator of easy mode, had committed suicide.

* * *

"Stupid woman."

She left a short will and took her own life, unable to hold on to hope.

Taesan wasn't particularly saddened by the fact.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's rather understandable. Instead of facing death in despair and agony, taking one's own life might be one of the answers.

This place is a labyrinth. Death is as familiar as life. While someone's death may not be special, a simple funeral is still held, at least, because they were an administrator.

"We're doomed anyway. Let's just enjoy this place until the next return."

Everyone silently agreed with someone's words. Easy mode is a cradle. At least, in this place, the threat of death is minimal.

People spent their time in a daze.

And among them was Taesan.

"Let's enjoy it until the next return."

It seems like the right answer.

Even if they put in all their effort and tried their best in easy mode, their limits were clear.

They wouldn't even be able to become a high-level player by the next return, and would die meaninglessly.

Taesan initially thought that even in easy mode, he could become strong enough. He believed that when he was rapidly descending into the labyrinth to defeat Choi Jung-hyuk.

But his third return completely shattered that belief.

He was just a slightly stronger easy mode player.

He couldn't even defeat the weakest monster."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If it weren't for Kim Hwi-yeon, I would have definitely died.

An even stronger monster will appear in the next return.

It's hard to survive even in normal mode, so there's no need to say anything about easy mode.

So I give up.

I'll just enjoy it for now and calmly wait for the impending death.

There's no other way. He's just an easy mode player.

But...

Wait.

Taesan clenched his fist. His fingernails dug into his flesh."
