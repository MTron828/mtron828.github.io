Chapter 415

415. 82nd floor, Remegaton (4)

Tai Shan checked the strange creatures that were piled up in the sky.

Initially, the creatures were not alive.

They were now gone, but they had moved like the remnants of a demon, driven by an automatic device left behind by Belial. They were just tools to counter intruders who entered the area.

It seemed that the creatures would shoot a gas when an intruder approached a certain distance, and then automatically respond.

Tai Shan continued to check, and the attendant of Belial, who was watching him, couldn't help but ask:

"What are you doing?"

"That has nothing to do with you. Don't worry about it."

Tai Shan replied casually, and the attendant shut his mouth.

The ghost sensed what Tai Shan was doing.

[Can I get a skill?]

Tai Shan nodded his head. The ghost wasn't surprised.

Tai Shan had always tried to acquire skills in any situation. This place was Belial's dead world, and given the unusual environment, it was easy to predict that Tai Shan would try to do something.

[I'm curious. What skill is it this time?]
Here is the translation of the text:

"I don't know either."

[What's that?]

"I don't have any skills, nor have I thought about them, so I don't know."

Tae-san spoke calmly.

He calculated the conditions of numerous skills and actually obtained them.

However, in his previous life, he was only a player in easy mode. The environment and situation were extremely limited.

At least, such an environment did not exist in easy mode.

Therefore, Tae-san did not know what skills he could obtain in this condition and had to repeat trials and failures.

Tae-san thought for a moment.

The stars on the ceiling unfolded as Tae-san moved, and they suddenly shot out thorns.

It was an all-encompassing attack that consumed almost all the space, leaving little room to dodge.

"'It's not hard to block,'"

One spell would be enough to stop everything. But that would achieve nothing.

Tae-san tried a few experiments.

The first one was to block the manifestation of the star's power. He gathered his strength and crushed it. The thorns could not pierce through Tae-san's barrier and protrude.
Here is the translation:

But Tai-san got nothing.

Tai-san didn't think he would succeed at first, so he didn't feel disappointed and tried again.

This time, he neutralized all the powers that were manifesting. He separated the magic, surrounded the magical seal, and blocked the trajectory of the thorns that were shooting out in all directions. As a result, the thorns couldn't advance and were blocked right in front of the magical seal.

However, the system window that notifies the acquisition of skills did not appear again.

Tai-san was not disappointed. It was natural for there to be numerous trials and errors in acquiring skills.

Tai-san continued to try out various experiments, and the ghost asked curiously:

[How can you get skills despite such a big difference in strength and level?]

"There are also skills that can be obtained regardless of strength and level."

Skills that are not related to strength and level, but are based on fundamental conditions, may be difficult to obtain, but are possible.

The most representative example is addition.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san had to continue attacking the numerous enemies with the same unyielding strategy, dealing damage without faltering even once. The strength of the enemy was of no concern.

What Tae-san was aiming for this time was a skill of this kind.

Tae-san thought for a moment, then quietly took a step forward. At the same time, thorns rained down from the stars in the sky.

Tae-san lightly waved his hand. When the thorns reached Tae-san, they shattered and scattered.

Tae-san observed the stars.

It wasn't just a simple gaze, but rather he concentrated his mind and sensed them.

As a result, he began to see something similar to the will of the stars.

The will of all things is not just a skill that can only sense the will of life and emotions. By concentrating one's mind and expanding one's senses, one can literally read the will of everything that exists in the world.

In short, this was now possible.

Tae-san lifted his foot.

At the same time, the will sensed from the stars began to change rapidly.

The waves of will bursting forth, and the places where the will is concentrated.

He grasped and understood everything.

Tae-san took a step forward. At the same time, the thorns rained down simultaneously.
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan didn't try to avoid or block the sharp thorns, but just stood still and waited.

Kuku-kuku-kuku-kung!

The thorns pierced the ground roughly.

[What's this?]

The ghost was startled.

Among the thorns that had pierced the ground, Taesan was standing without a single wound. It looked like the thorns had deliberately avoided Taesan.

[How did it do that?]

"'Willpower without movement. This too is possible.'"

Reading movement means reading the transfer of power and then dodging. However, willpower is a stage prior to the manifestation of power. Taesan read the willpower of the ants and anticipated the location where the thorns would shoot. Then, it moved to a place without thorns.

Even when facing an opponent with a low level of intelligence, Taesan had done something similar, but that was possible because the opponent had lost their consciousness and only their strength and instinct remained. What's most impressive is that Taesan succeeded against an inanimate object.

"'Can you read willpower even if you're inanimate?'"

It's like a skill of the world itself, so it's hard to understand in many ways.

And this attack also confirmed something else.

The ants did not recognize Taesan and attack it.
(Note: I translated "태산" as "Taesan" since it seems to be the name of a character, but it could also be a literal translation of "Great Mountain" if the context requires it.)
Here is the translation of the text:

It was closer to a reflexive response than a conditional one. When the intruder approached to a certain distance, he would spread out his strength to pierce in all directions.

In an instant, dozens of conditions and the corresponding skills flashed through his mind.

And then, Taesan finally found something close to the correct answer.

"It's a barrage attack."

In that situation, he would advance without dodging or blocking, not receiving any damage, and wondering what skill he could obtain.

"Let's try."

If that's the case, it's possible. Taesan, full of confidence, continued to experiment.

He began to grasp how much willpower he could read, what level of accuracy it was, and how much space there was between the thorns, and how he would respond when Taesan made a move. He started to analyze everything.

Uh-oh.

Taesan took a step forward. A strong willpower emerged from his body. He began to read the direction and trajectory of the thorns shooting towards him.

This time, Taesan realized that he couldn't avoid the thorns by walking forward.

What was needed was to walk like taking a stroll. He couldn't take evasive actions. He needed to induce the opponent's attack.

The trajectory of the thorns shooting automatically changed according to Taesan's movements.

Then...
Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan moved his legs and shook his fingers.

As a result, the will of Sheng Ge synchronized with his fingers and underwent a chaotic change.

Not only moving forward, but also guiding the trajectory of the thorns to some extent by moving his entire body.

He tried to grasp one by one the conditions and solution methods. He repeatedly attempted and verified how to move to guide the trajectory of the thorns and how to make the process natural.

And two hours later.

"Almost there."

Tai Shan finished preparing and expanded his senses. He read the will of everything around him and lifted his foot.

At the same time, he sensed the will of Sheng Ge.

He prepared to shoot the thorns to block the intruder. Tai Shan, who had read the trajectory and direction of the thorns, took a step forward.

Huh-huh-huh-huh!

The thorns pierced the ground.

But it did not reach Tai Shan.

It was as if the thorns had moved to avoid Tai Shan.

Tai Shan lifted his foot again. Again, he sensed the will of Sheng Ge.

He grasped it.

He grasped the will of the thorns, which branched out into thousands of directions, and understood it before its trajectory and path were manifested.
Here is the translation of the text:

As a result, he realized that he couldn't avoid it. However, there was no problem. Taisean lightly waved his arm. It was not a defensive or evasive movement, but rather a meaningless gesture.

However, that movement alone changed the will that Seong-ge had felt.

Seong-ge is an automatic defense device. It responds to the opponent's movement. Even if the movement is meaningless, it will read it all.

Through two hours of experimentation, he had already figured out how to change the trajectory.

After confirming that the trajectory had changed, Taisean took a step. The needle shot again. However, it didn't hit Taisean.

Pfft.

He took another step.

Hoo-ah!

The needle shot again.

However, it didn't hit Taisean. He moved his arm, leg, and body to twist the trajectory of the needle.

[...Wow.]

A ghostly exclamation echoed.

Avoiding the needle was something he had seen many times before, so it wasn't surprising.

However, Taisean's movement now seemed very natural.

Hoo-ah!
Here is the translation of the text:

Thorns were pouring down, filling the horizon of Taesan. It was an attack that completely occupied the entire space, with no escape.

Taesan continued to walk forward, as if taking a stroll, while the thorns were deliberately avoiding him.

The scene was so astonishing that it was almost unbelievable.

After taking about twenty steps...

*[You didn't dodge, avoid, or defend against the attack and didn't take any damage. You obtained the special skill [Shadow Within] instead.]*

At the same time, the thorns naturally bypassed Taesan.

Taesan didn't deliberately avoid the thorns. Instead, the thorns simply avoided him on their own.

It was clear that he had obtained a skill just from that.

*[You activated Jebara's Black Storm.]*

Kaga Kaga!

Taesan destroyed all the spatial nodes. Although the thorns poured down all at once, the Black Storm swallowed them all and dispersed them.

"Uuuuah!"

"What's going on?"

Other contractual parties who were breaking through the area from a distance were shocked. They were terrified and moved away from the direction of the storm.
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan knew that, but it was a story unrelated to him, so he ignored it and opened the skill window.

[Skill: Shadow Dwellers, always active] [Proficiency: 1%] [In the case of an attack that is not noticed, it does not hit you.]

The ghost let out a sigh.

[Wow, you've got all sorts of skills. What's this one?]

"Is it an attack that is not noticed?"

The effect was easy to guess. It was probably a device that automatically attacks the surroundings when something like a giant turtle approaches, or an attack that does not hit if the opponent is not aware of Taesan.

"That's as far as it goes, I suppose."

The ghost also understood the meaning of Taesan's words.

[There's a condition attached.]

From now on, the opponents Taesan will fight against will all be above immortal level. It is impossible to miss an opponent in such battles.

In the end, to properly use the skill, it was necessary to hide one's body from the opponent, which was a very difficult situation to create.

"It doesn't matter."

However, Taesan said calmly.

"This is enough to win."

Numerous trials and attempts to obtain the skill.
Here is the translation of the text:

After putting in countless years of effort to obtain a skill, I found that it was utterly useless in actual combat. It was like copying a skill.

I didn't even anticipate or try it beforehand, so I was quite satisfied with it.

[But it's like that, isn't it.]

In reality, those who hide in the shadows aren't skills of such low level.

This skill is a constant-type skill that doesn't consume mana, and if I just hide my appearance, I can easily dodge attacks from high-ranking opponents. If I was alive back then, I would have been extremely happy to obtain this skill.

However, the skills I've obtained so far are fundamentally different, so it's only comparable.

[My senses have been numb, I guess.]

The ghost let out a strange sound.

Taesan thought about how to use the skill.

"'Escape'."

Escape changes the effect of Ability Sword, allowing me to hide my body from the opponent for 1 second, making me undetectable in all senses. I can now fulfill the conditions of the new skill.

"'I can also use it in a way that changes the partial world to hide my body.'"

If I just decide to use it, there are many ways to do so. I'll gradually figure out its efficiency and make a plan.

Here is the translation of the text:

Taisan was satisfied and took a step forward.

He moved forward without hesitation. However, another obstacle appeared.

This time, it was not a giant, but a small living being.

A creature with fluttering wings and a menacing gaze.

They were so small that they couldn't be seen with the naked eye, and there were countless numbers of them. They attacked Taisan, who was intruding on their territory, to kill the outsider.

Taisan casually clenched his fist.

Quack, quack.

Thousands of creatures simultaneously disappeared.

"Are you going to get a skill this time?"

"This condition has already been experimented with."

Taisan said calmly. The small, invisible beings. He had already confirmed the skills that could be obtained from them in his previous life.

And most of the skills he obtained were useless.

"Already done."

A ghost chuckled. Taisan, without stopping, advanced towards the powerful force that he could feel in the distance.
