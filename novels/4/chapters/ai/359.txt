Chapter 360

360. 76th Floor, Guides of Evil (5)

Taesan gazed at the ring.

A black and white ring.

This ring was born as twins, just like the yin and yang, from the very beginning.

Then, could the two of them use one ring together?

Taesan knew it was possible.

But for now, they couldn't use it.

The ring was indeed a twin, but the power between them was not equal. The black ring had attack power, while the white ring had defense and divinity.

It was uncertain whether the skill conditions were perfectly met.

Moreover, Taesan had not yet fully mastered the ring.

So, he thought of first accurately grasping the skill conditions and then finding Half-ran, who had created the twin ring, to get help.

"There's a lot to do."

It seemed that various preparations were necessary.

Next, he acquired the special passive skill of Gwonseong's martial arts, Gwonseong's authority.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But Taesan is an adventurer who wields a sword, not his fists. That's why his skill has been integrated with the Ilac martial arts and ability sword.

As a result, his proficiency in Ilac martial arts has increased by 5%, bringing it to 54%.

It was a skill that didn't rise easily. Despite being a skill that activates in every battle, it still hasn't reached 60%.

"I'll think about it later."

He was currently on the 76th floor.

And Ainshar's destination was the 78th floor, the Great Library of the Sky.

There were only two floors left.

Had he achieved his goal, or was he still wandering?

It wouldn't take long to find out.

He finished checking the rewards he obtained by defeating the guides. Overall, it was more about reinforcing his existing powers rather than gaining new ones.

It might not seem like a big gain, but it wasn't bad either. Taesan already had too many diverse powers, and it would be better to reinforce his existing ones rather than trying to handle new, unmanageable powers.

And this wasn't the end."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As I delved deeper, Taesan acquired a title that assisted in increasing the proficiency of his skills.

And while fighting against the eight guides, he used numerous skills.

As a result, the contents of various skills that had been stagnant changed.

The first skill to change was Ability Sword.

[Advanced Swordsmanship: Ability Sword] [Proficiency: 62%] [A unique swordsmanship created by the adventurer of the labyrinth. It is based on the labyrinth's system and was created using the swordsmanship of the prince of the destroyed world as a foundation. It can be used in perfect harmony with various skills.]

The proficiency of Ability Sword increased to 60%.

Although the description of the skill itself did not change much, several affected skills emerged.

[Special Activation Skill: Reconnaissance] [Proficiency: 82%] [An evolved form of intuition. It can gather a vast amount of information about the target.] [Condition: Advanced Swordsmanship [Ability Sword]] [When the target uses a sword, it can analyze the characteristics, weaknesses, and principles of that swordsmanship in detail.]

As the proficiency of Reconnaissance reached 80%, the effects of Ability Sword were added."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Scouting provides overall information, but it's difficult to know the details. Now, I can understand my opponent's swordsmanship more deeply, especially when they're using their sword.

And skills like acceleration, strong attacks, and feints that can be triggered continuously by matching the timing.

The effect of successfully triggering these skills becomes stronger and stronger.

The skills that are difficult for opponents to respond to have become even more difficult to respond to.

[Special Skill: Transformation] [Mana Consumption: 1,000] [You can adjust the attack and defense stats. The adjustable limit is equal to the sum of the attack and defense stats. This skill can only be used once a week, and the stats return to normal after attacking.] [Condition: Advanced Swordsmanship [Ability Sword]] [When you adjust the attack stat using Transformation and attack with a sword, an additional 20% is added.]

"Wow."

This skill, Transformation, allows me to attack with full power in a single strike. And the added effect of Ability Sword is incredibly simple yet powerful. It increases the adjustable stats by an additional 20%.

It means that if I convert 5,000 defense points to attack points, I'll get 6,000 attack points."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was an easy-to-understand and powerful effect, with attack power increasing simply. I was satisfied.

[Special Activation Skill: Forced Fall] [Mana Consumption: 200] [Proficiency: 7%] [Reduces the opponent's stats for a certain period of time by a certain ratio.] [Condition: Superior Swordsmanship [Ability Sword]] [When the opponent's sword clashes with yours, it increases the weight of the opponent's sword. This effect can be stacked.]

"What's with the weight?"

It wasn't a very impressive effect. It was hard to imagine what kind of advantage it would give to increase the weight of their weapons, especially for those with monstrous stats. 

But since I reached 60% and got this effect, it might still be useful.

That's as far as the effects of Ability Sword go.

From now on, it's just regular skills.

The proficiency of Frozen World has reached 40%.

[Intermediate Magic: Frozen World] [Mana Consumption: 300] [Proficiency: 40%] [Unleashes a chilling energy that freezes everything, bringing forth a portion of the power to freeze the world itself.]

The proficiency of Frozen World has already reached 40%. It seemed that using magic multiple times through stacking had helped quite a bit in increasing proficiency."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the frozen world.]

Coldness covers the world.

The power of the frozen world is realized in the world through the mana channel.

It has definitely become stronger. With this level of power, defense would be easy even without using magic overlap.

‘But.’

Although it was a powerful force, Taesan felt somewhat unsatisfied.

Partial world change, using everything beyond the boundary, and activating the frozen world.

The power contained within was truly transcendent, surpassing mortality. It was the true power of magic created by the magic god itself.

In comparison, it was too pitiful.

One day, Taesan would be able to wield that power without the aid of other forces. Taesan organized his emotions and checked his other skills.

There were many changed skills. Vital point designation, resonance gaze, essence analysis, counter, forced duel, acceleration.

And the proficiency of various passive skills had also increased.

Taesan, who had checked each one, was satisfied.

But it was not the end yet.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The space was torn apart. A dark, thick, yet familiar darkness flowed out, revealing the girl's figure.

With the sound of applause, Mashin appeared.

[You did well. Taesan.]

"Have you been watching?"

[Of course, I have. Why would I take my eyes off the feast in front of me?]

Mashin smiled faintly.

[It's easier than I thought, but... it's also possible because of the power you've built up. I'm satisfied.]

Mashin's reward was given. The darkness settled into Taesan.

[You have obtained the intermediate black magic [Zepar's Black Storm].] [You have obtained the intermediate black magic [Asmodeus' Chain of Corruption].] [You have obtained the special passive skill [Return as Darkness].] [The special skill [Apostle of Darkness and Chaos] has evolved into [Apostle of Darkened Chaos].]

Two intermediate black magics.

Plus, a passive skill and the evolution of Apostle.

I'll have to check the detailed effects, but this is worth the effort of fighting with limited recovery.

"Thank you."

[You granted my request. As a god, it's only natural to reward you for that.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Mashin said with a pleased smile. Instead of leaving immediately, she gazed at Taesan.

[Do you know where you are right now?]

“Yes.”

Taesan was situated on the boundary between mortality and what lay beyond.

[Until now, I thought you weren't enough and left you alone, but... now I can try to approach you seriously.]

Taesan realized what Mashin was saying.

The master of dark magic. The devil.

They were going to approach Taesan.

[I don't intend to interfere. Everything is up to your choice.]

“I understand.”

Taesan nodded his head.

Mashin smiled pleasantly and disappeared into the darkness.

[Special Passive Skill: Return to Darkness] [Proficiency: 1%] [Recovers some of the magical energy consumed when using dark magic.]

A skill that recovers some of the magical energy consumed when using dark magic. Magical energy is more difficult to recover than mana, and it's hard to increase it. This skill was a small but helpful one that reduced the consumption of magical energy.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The skill of Sadohwa has also changed significantly. The duration has increased from two hours to three hours, and the consumption of magic during the skill's activation has been halved.

I read the descriptions of two intermediate-level black magic skills, and they seemed quite useful. I planned to test their actual power in direct combat.

'Finally.'

I've finally finished checking all my skills.

It felt like the longest time I've spent checking my skills since entering the labyrinth. Taesan had done a great job.

Instead of getting up, Taesan opened his mouth.

'Me.'

'Did you notice?'

A carefree-looking man with red hair appeared out of thin air, grinning awkwardly.

'I tried to hide pretty hard.'

'I knew it from the moment you snuck in.'

Taesan was checking his skills when Ambresia sneaked into the room, hiding her presence. I thought about attacking, but since there was no enemy, I let it go.

'That's right.'

Ambresia scratched her head.

I used all my strength to hide, but you knew from the moment I entered. It meant there was a significant gap between us.

'Really... you've changed a lot.'

Ambresia was the first person I met when I first met Taesan."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He had blocked his attack carelessly and tossed him aside without a second thought. It wasn't a long time ago.

But to think that the situation would reverse so quickly. Ambresia let out a wry smile.

"I've never felt this way before, but I feel a wall."

"What's going on?"

Taesan grasped his sword. Ambresia took a step back.

"I don't want to fight you. Unlike those who died at your hands, I don't want to commit suicide."

Taesan was refusing to engage in battle and was choosing to hide instead. Ambresia was one of them.

"So why did you come?"

"I was curious about the outcome of the battle."

[Is it boredom or curiosity? Well, you were the most curious of all the guides. You were the most adventurous.]

The ghost said. Ambresia looked at the ghost with an ambiguous expression.

"Ghost... what should I say?"

[You don't have any ill feelings towards me, so it's fine.]

The ghost spoke calmly. Ambresia scratched his cheek.

"Anyway, I don't want to fight you. But if you're going to kill me... I'll resist."

Ambresia raised his hand.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was a small key inside.

Taesan gazed at him with a blank expression. Ambresia quietly swallowed her saliva.

"It's okay."

Taesan put away his sword.

"I don't have time to waste."

Taesan remembered that Ambresia had used the key to move him from the lower floors to the 70th floor.

Then, the opposite should also be possible.

If he had several similar items, it would take an extremely long time to defeat him. Taesan was certainly strong, but he couldn't quickly subdue a strong opponent like Ambresia, who was determined to escape.

It was likely to take a long time if they started a cat-and-mouse game. Ambresia let out a sigh of relief, as if she was grateful.

"Thanks. Really."

Ambresia had the confidence to escape. But if Taesan really pursued her to the end, she would have no choice but to die. It was extremely fortunate that Taesan was letting her go.

"I'll repay you with some information, but... it's a bit awkward to say it's repayment."

Ambresia said, taking a step back."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There are many guides who made the same choice as me. The guide who decided to fight you is now dead in your hands. But there are two guides who decided to find another way."

[Who are they?]

Ambresia answered the ghost's question.

"The Lion King and the Ashen Lady, Sosiet. The two are waiting for you inside the labyrinth."

"Only two?"

It seemed to have decreased significantly. From Taesan's perspective, it was a relief, but not for the ghost.

[You didn't run away, Sosiet.]

"It didn't seem like you had any intention of doing so from the start."

Ambresia muttered, and the ghost let out a small laugh.

[Good, very good.]

"Then, it's farewell."

Ambresia held up the key.

"I hope we don't meet again."

With that, his body disappeared. He had used the key to move to another floor.

If only two more guides were defeated, the guides of sin would no longer be able to block his path.

And that meant that the day the ghost's wish would come true was approaching.

Taesan took a step forward. The altar, which he had neglected while fighting the guides of sin, came into view.

He would clear Maria's trial. That was the 76th floor's quest.

[You have discovered Maria's altar.]

The God of Choice, Maria.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It wasn't their first meeting. As Taesan placed his hand on Maria's altar, a tremendous power began to descend upon the labyrinth.

[It's nice to see you again. Child.]

Maria's presence filled the labyrinth.

Taesan responded to the voice with a hint of laughter.

"It's been a while."

[It's been a while, indeed. Not enough time has passed to say that, but it's been a faithful time.]

Maria laughed.

[I've been enjoying watching your choices. You've brought excitement to a dull time.]

"Will I be able to pass Maria's trial?"

[Yes. I'll give you a trial, just for you.]

Maria's power began to seep into Taesan.

[Sub-quest starts] [Maria wants to test you, who have come to her altar. If you accept, the trial will come to you. If you overcome it, you'll receive a reward.] [Maria's interference zone will decrease.] [Maria offers you a strengthened trial.]

Taesan nodded his head.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Sub-quest begins.] [Those with divine blood, trapped in endless despair, seek to become a sacrifice for the emperor themselves. Help them on their journey and make your own choices.] [However, physical interference with the owner of the divine blood is prohibited.] [Reward: Maria will determine the reward based on your achievements.]"
