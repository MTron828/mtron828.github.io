**Chapter 596**

**596. Extra Story, Mashin (8)**

Surprisingly, Maria cooperated with Baal.

She told other transcendents that Baal could travel through the universe, and thanks to her, Baal was able to do so. Although there were many restrictions and surveillance, Baal was able to travel through the universe.

He traveled through the universe with Lucifer.

Lucifer enjoyed seeing all sorts of things with Baal. They observed the vastness of the universe and the lives of humans living there.

"This is fun."

Lucifer returned to her residence, laughing happily. She had just seen a magnificent waterfall.

"Nature can be that beautiful. It's something we can't experience in this dull world. And even in that natural world, living beings find their own paths to survive."

Lucifer tapped on the bed. A bed made of woven grass, which was very unstable. It was a huge difference from the lodgings outside.

"I wonder if we can achieve the same development as them someday?"

[If you succeed and time passes, it might be possible.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If we accumulate knowledge and pass it down to future generations, acquire technology, and commemorate history, then...

The demon tribe can also establish a brilliant civilization like humans.

[What do you think?]

"Well, maybe we'll fail."

Lucifer said calmly. Baal chuckled.

[You knew that, didn't you?]

"I won't fail. But there's no way to stop the obstacles."

The architect's wish is clearly possible.

Lucifer can become a transcendent being by receiving the demon tribe's faith.

But the process was the problem.

What the architect wants to achieve is a contract with all demons.

It's impossible for the high-ranking demons not to notice such a massive disturbance.

Lucifer and Baal also knew that fact perfectly well. Only the demons blinded by miracles didn't know.

[Why didn't you refuse?]

"It's not like they'll listen even if I say it."

The architect was blinded by miracles. Even if Lucifer says it's impossible, he won't listen. He'll just shout out his wishes and proceed with stubborn determination.

"Unfortunately, I don't have the power to stop him."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lucifer shrugged his shoulders. Although he could defeat the immortal with his skills, he lacked the overwhelming power. If he fought with all his might, it would be her defeat.

"And even if it's possible, I won't do it."

[Why not?]

"What they need is me, a hope. Being trapped here, unable to achieve anything, and just growing old and dying. What value is there in that kind of life?"

[Isn't surviving enough?]

"No."

His black eyes gazed at Baal, unwavering and clear.

"That's not enough. We need possibilities. Even if the end is destruction."

[You're cruel.]

"You shouldn't say that. You're the one who gave me hope, aren't you?"

Baal smiled quietly.

[Did you know that too?]

"How much do you think I'm a fool?"

Lucifer grumbled.

"You brought outside knowledge to this place."

The owner of this small model garden, who had been trapped here, knew about the outside world.

Who the demon world originally belonged to, who ruled the outside world.

And what was needed to become a transcendent being.

And trivial knowledge like human trafficking, robbery, and cooking.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This was knowledge that could never be obtained here.

It was one of a kind.

The only external existence that could enter and exit this place.

It was Baal who directly transmitted this knowledge.

"You are twisted. Unlike other gods, you don't think of us as simple toys."

If they wanted to see these people living and dying here, there was no need to transmit external knowledge. Even if they wanted to see them bring about their own revolution and destruction, there was no reason to use such a troublesome method.

"We're putting in quite an effort, tolerating the annoyance and trying to do something. I don't know what it is. What do you want from us?"

[Hmm.]

Baal spoke in a low tone.

[I don't know either.]

And a few days later.

"Lord Savior."

The village chief said with an excited face.

"All preparations are complete."

* * *

Oooooh.

A strange power flowed in Lucifer's residence.

It was a kind of contract.

A single curse centered around Lucifer.

All the demons in the village outside were praying towards this underground, facing outward."

"It's finally coming to an end."

Lucifer muttered to herself, her entire body starting to fill with a strange power.

"It was fun, Baal. As promised, I'll spare your life."

[You're very welcome.]

Baal smiled faintly. Lucifer was always confident. She was overflowing with self-assurance and had no fear.

It was extremely captivating.

Baal, who had been gazing at Lucifer for a moment, opened his mouth.

[You're going to die.]

The plan of the elders will fail.

Baal was convinced of it. There was no way it could succeed.

They would all die, torn apart, and be forgotten. It was a predetermined fate.

But...

[How about running away with me instead.]

"Huh?"

Lucifer looked at Baal with a surprised expression.

Baal was also surprised. It was an impulsive remark.

But he couldn't take it back.

[I can hide you and run away.]

Lucifer was a vessel for the transcendent being. But for now, she was just a vessel. Baal's power was enough to hide her.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I can take you and send you to the universe. There, you will gain freedom. You will come to know many more things."

The wind outside.

The warmth of the sun.

The warmth of human kindness.

The possibility that she can reach.

The universe is vast. What she has seen while traveling with Baal is only a tiny fragment.

"[It's an already predetermined outcome. You can escape from there and enjoy your freedom, can't you?]"

With a calm tone, Lucifer gazed at Baal with a strange expression.

"...... Unexpected words. Thank you. But it's not necessary."

Lucifer stood up from her seat.

Standing on the shabby bed, she declared to the world.

"I will achieve it myself."

She was shining brightly.

Her light was so intense that it was dazzling.

"And why do you think you'll lose?"

Lucifer smiled coldly.

"I will reach the highest place. I will trample you and stand on your head. Let's see then."

"Oooooh!"

A cheer erupted from outside. The demons wailed and knelt down, their voices trembling. The chief demon's face turned red as he shouted.

"Our demon lord! You are the miracle that will save us!"
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$He strikes his head to the ground. The earth shakes.

"Pray! Bring us and grant us salvation!"

Keyiiiiying!

The device spread out in the miniature garden operates.

It is a curse for a creature known as the fallen.

An eternal indelible mark to be engraved upon them.

All intact intellect-possessing fallen worship it. It is promised to be worshipped even in future faith.

Keyiiiiying!

It is a contract with all the fallen.

All the fallen in the underworld are the target.

Its effect does not end in this small miniature garden. The barrier that Baal spread is breaking. It spreads throughout the underworld.

And the minions of the underworld and the demons noticed.

At the edge of the underworld, the demons saw what they were doing.
*
*
*

[Here they come.]

Baal muttered. A few of the underworld's minions and demons were quickly rushing towards his miniature garden.

Soon they entered Baal's view.

They were surprised and stopped when they saw Baal.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Ah, Lord Baal.] [Beliar.] [You've already arrived, I see. Indeed, you are Lord Baal. Well, anyway... Who would have thought you'd be hiding in a place like this?]"

Beliar gazes at the miniature garden.

A small village. The demon tribe lived there.

"[These rats.]"

Beliar reveals his true nature.

"[You were hiding in a place like this? I didn't know how you were hiding, but it's perfect. This is going to be a delightful time.]"

Beliar mutters excitedly. Then, two enormous beings approach them.

"Kuuuuung!"

Twisted, distorted beings with dark auras.

They bow their heads to Baal with reverence.

"[Greetings, Lord Baal.] [Long time no see.]"

Although they were extremely polite, there was a hint of tension.

They were the direct apostles of the Demon God, created by tearing off a part of themselves. They possessed the power and authority that even Baal couldn't trifle with, as the left and right hands of the Demon God.

"[Those filthy rats were doing something ridiculous.] [That's right.] [I wonder how they hid. It seems like some kind of barrier was set up... I can sense Lord Baal's energy there...]" [No, it's just the proxy.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Baal spoke lazily. The proxy gazed at Baal with a cold stare, then bowed his head.

"[Lord Baal, please step aside. We need to clean up the trash.]

The proxy's energy became sharp and tense.

"[Those vile creatures are doing something very dangerous right now.]

The aftermath was spreading throughout the demon world. Every demon was a target.

It was a curse and a seal on the very existence of the demons. The power that was bound together was unpredictable, even for the proxy.

It was almost impossible, but they had to uproot it. The demons agreed.

"[Hmph.]

Baal was deep in thought.

If he stepped aside, the proxy would trample the village.

He would kill all the demons praying, and find Lucifer.

And he would pierce Lucifer's heart.

The vessel of the transcendent being was extremely dangerous. He would defile and ravage it, completely crushing the body and soul, making it impossible to find its original form.

Nothing would be left of the material and spiritual essence that made up Lucifer in this universe.

"I don't want to see it."

Baal felt a strong sense of discomfort.

As he stood silently, the proxy spoke.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Or do you think Baal-nim will take care of it himself?] [What should we do.] [If Baal-nim doesn't have any thoughts, I'll do it!]

Belial lets out a sly laugh and takes to the air. He tries to brush past Baal and enter the village.

And at that moment, the darkness moves.

Quadruple thud!

[Ugh!]

The darkness tramples Belial and slams him to the ground. The demons are shocked and scatter in all directions.

"[Lord Baal?] [Hm.]

But as much as they were shocked, Baal was also bewildered by his own actions."
