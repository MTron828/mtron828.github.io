**Chapter 446**

**446. The Ring of Black and White (1)**

"Show me the ring."

Taesan showed him a pair of black and white rings.

As Halfren examined the ring from every angle, Taesan spoke to him.

"It turns out, Coslun. I met him."

"Met Coslun?"

Halfren's pupils grew larger.

"...... Which floor did you meet him on?"

"86th floor. He said he made a new contract with a wizard."

"A new contract, huh."

Taesan explained to Halfren. After hearing the story, Halfren's confusion subsided.

"...... So that's how it happened. It's definitely a place that means nothing to me."

Halfren couldn't handle equipment with a will of its own. To him, the world of weapons with a will was not very appealing.

"Wait a minute."

Halfren scowled.

"...... Then, this energy I've been feeling since a while ago..."

[Hello, Halfren.]

Bardley spoke in the form of a sword.

Halfren closed his mouth.

A moment later, a dry laugh burst out.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Hero... how did it come to this? I thought I had completed the quest and given my power to that sword, and then left..."

[I've become a sword.]

"Kosrun must have been thrilled. Hero, are you satisfied with that?"

[What's the big deal? At least for now, I don't have any regrets.]

"Then that's fine, I suppose."

Halfren said calmly.

"Congratulations on achieving your wish."

[Thanks. It's not like it's a big deal for me, anyway. You have your own tasks to attend to.]

"That's right."

Halfren nodded in agreement. He grasped a pair of rings tightly.

"Then let's get started right away. Follow me."

Halfren took Taesan to his own ruined world.

The place was completely dead.

Even the last bit of life had disappeared, and it had transformed into a massive, planet-sized boulder.

"Are we going to make it here?"

"The equipment I'm going to make now exceeds my understanding. Since I don't know how the aftermath will turn out, I judged it to be correct to make it in a dead world."

Halfren said so and headed towards the large forge that was left abandoned in the dead world.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It seemed that Halfdan had created something after the death of the world.

"Then let's get organized. I'm not skilled enough to handle the tools you've given me. But if I treat you as a tool, the story changes."

Taesan became Halfdan's hammer and anvil.

The immortal became the blacksmith's hands and feet. If that's the case, Halfdan could handle even materials that were impossible for him to handle.

"But a tool is the craftsman's hands and feet. It's not just about following my words. You need to become me, and I need to become you."

Halfdan pulled out a pure white orb from his bosom.

"Let's synchronize you and me first, then."

[The Core of the Refined World] [The Core of the Refined World, refined by the blacksmith's hands. It has the power to connect different lives and synchronize them.]

"Ah, I'm sorry, hero. Could you please keep your distance for a while? I don't know what kind of influence someone like you would have."

[Got it.]

Bardley slipped out of Taesan's hand and kept his distance.

"......Perfectly free, Cosrun. I didn't know that guy had a chance to fulfill his wish."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Hafuran, who was amazed, opened his mouth with a serious face.

"Are you ready?"

Taesan nodded his head. Hafuran was handling the core of the world.

A white sphere expanded and engulfed them.

And Hafuran and Taesan synchronized with each other. Their powers and auras began to resonate with each other.

Hafuran's face trembled.

"Hmm..."

Taesan was an immortal. No matter how much Taesan adjusted, it was difficult for Hafuran, a mortal, to achieve perfect synchronization.

"I underestimated you. Maybe I wasn't prepared enough."

Hafuran took out numerous materials from his pocket.

He activated them all at once. Instantly, Hafuran's power and aura surged to an extremely high level.

Only then did Hafuran feel a bit relieved and took a deep breath.

"Then... we need to take it one step further. We'll connect our minds."

"Minds?"

Taesan was taken aback.

Connecting their minds meant that Hafuran would peek into Taesan's heart, which was equivalent to saying that.

"I understand if you feel resistant. But without connecting at that level, creating the equipment will be difficult."

"I have no choice. It doesn't matter."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was no reason to refuse anymore. It was simply a matter of showing it, and it wasn't a story that would evoke a sense of refusal.

"Okay, then let's start right away."

Kiying!

The core of the world that surrounded them began to amplify even more.

They started to connect with each other.

And Taesan saw it.

In a world made entirely of fire, a dwarf was hammering away alone, without a care in the world, even as he was burning himself.

That was exactly what Halfan's heart was like.

And just as Taesan saw Halfan's heart, Halfan also saw Taesan's heart.

"......Hmm?"

Halfan's eyes wavered.

He looked like he had seen something strange, something that didn't exist in the world, and was taken aback.

"Why is that?"

"No, it's nothing."

Halfan hid his surprise and regained his composure.

"Our hearts are connected. How does it feel?"

"It's strange."

He felt something about Halfan within himself.

It was a feeling as if the two of them had become one.

"Then that's it. Let's start right away."

Halfan placed a pair of rings on the anvil."

Note: "키이잉!" (Kiying!) is an onomatopoeic expression that is difficult to translate, but it's often used to describe a sudden, intense, or dramatic moment.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The owner of this ring is you. It will influence your ego, power, and dignity. Remember that."

Taesan nodded his head.

"Then let's start. Activate it."

[You activated one of the two rings.]

Zzzt!

The sound resonated.

The two rings, which were separate, tried to become one by force.

Naturally, a backlash occurred. The ring's structure began to collapse. Like trying to force a mismatched puzzle piece, it refused to fit and shattered.

At that moment, Halfren took out a material.

Chk-chk-chk!

The thread of collapse was drawn in mid-air. Thanks to the connected mental image, Taesan immediately realized what Halfren wanted. He moved the thread to tightly wrap around the ring.

And it was locked in place.

The collapsing ring was forced to maintain its shape by the thread of collapse.

Halfren immediately took out the next material. It was a badge of struggle. The badge shattered, and the intense power contained within it began to spread in all directions.

Taesan controlled his will to focus the powers on the rings.

Ku-ku-ku-kung!

The rings, empowered by the great force, responded to it. They continued to rise to an even higher level, and the backlash between them began to disappear gradually.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And finally, the essence of the world.

The world's everything is contained, and it covers a pair of rings.

Clang.

It binds, pulls, and covers. The rings slowly accept each other.

There, Halfren took up a hammer.

Ka-boom!

The sound of pounding resonates. Halfren doesn't stop. He takes up the hammer again and strikes down.

Ka-boom!

He focuses all his spirit and abilities. He takes up the hammer again.

Ka-boom!

It's as if he's dedicating himself to hammering.

But even so, it's not enough.

The ring resists, emitting a wave of energy. Halfren pours all his strength into striking the hammer, but it has little effect.

And then, Taesan responds to it.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

He unleashes his power and crushes the ring. He mixes divine and black energy to trample the ring's resistance.

"You're my equipment."

That ring was his possession.

And possessions must follow their owner's will.

He imbues his will into the ring, suppressing its resistance. The ring's resistance gradually weakens.

Eventually, the ring submits and begins to accept him.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The hammer struck. With the sound of iron and steel clashing, the ring was forged.

Kwaaaang!

Black and white spread out in all directions.

The power contained within was a fierce force that could destroy and shatter everything.

Taesan unfolded his arms, and a magical barrier enveloped Halfren.

Kwaaaang!

The barrier, struck by the force, shook violently, but it did not break and stood firm.

The aftermath subsided.

"......Thanks. I almost died while making the equipment."

Halfren muttered, his face drenched in sweat.

"I did the right thing here."

The ruined world was devastated by the concentration of power. If he had done it in the labyrinth, his workshop would have been destroyed.

And on the anvil, there was one ring.

On that ring, black and white swirled like the taiji symbol.

"I really... did it."

Halfren let out a sigh of relief. Even he couldn't imagine creating equipment of this level.

The materials that went into making that one ring alone were the light of the origin, the source of the four gods, the dragon's claw, the spark of the spirit king, the essence of the world, the thread of destruction, and the proof of struggle.

There were seven of them in total.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Each and every one of them was a material that could create top-notch equipment, even if they were used to make just one piece of equipment.

Everything was used solely for the sake of one ring. Half-ran gazed at the ring with expectant eyes.

"That's yours. Check it out."

Taesan took the ring. The ring did not resist and allowed Taesan's hand to grasp it.

[A fusion of grandeur and perfection, dyed in black and white] [Strength + 10%] [Agility + 10%] [Intelligence + 10%] [Attack Power + 2500] [Defense + 500] [Many materials were mixed together to create a perfect whole. A pair of twins, created separately, merged to form a complete self. You have perfectly tamed this ring.] [This ring is in sync with you. It perfectly assists all your actions.] [This ring is a part of you. It can control the power you possess, protect you, and attack your enemies.] [This ring has a self. If you want, you can awaken that self.] [The awakened self grows stronger every time it defeats an enemy, enhancing the ring's abilities.]

* * *

[Oh wow.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Bardley let out a sound without realizing it.

[What kind of ring is this.]

Bardley had also made a prediction. The performance of the ring was going to be different from what he had seen so far. Just thinking about the materials used made it clear that it was going to be exceptional.

But this was a number that exceeded Bardley's imagination.

His strength, agility, and intelligence stats had increased by 10%.

Even considering the original set effect of a 5% increase, this was an absurdly high number.

Just that one number alone made Bardley think it was okay.

But that wasn't the end of it.

The attack power was a whopping 2500.

It was on par with Bardley himself. It was unimaginable that a single ring could have such attack power.

Although the attack power number made it seem relatively insignificant, the defense of 500 was also an unprecedented number for a normal ring.

[What is this? How did you make this?]

"It's not something I made. If you think about it, it's as if Taesan made it himself."

But Halfren's face, as he said this, was filled with strong confidence and joy.

"Can I check it out too?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan handed the ring to him. Although the ring seemed to resist slightly, it didn't put up a big fight.

"Oooo..."

Half-ran examined the ring and let out a sigh of amazement.

His eyes shone with uncontrollable joy.

"I, I have this kind of equipment..."

"Does this mean my wish has come true?"

What Half-ran had been longing for was to create a unique piece of equipment that no one else could make, something that only he could create.

"No. I'm still lacking."

But Half-ran denied it. His eyes were filled with a strong desire.

"I can create even more exceptional equipment that no one can surpass. And if you're with me... it's not impossible."

Half-ran smiled deeply.

"Let's get along well from now on. Adventurer."

"Alright."

The full support of the great blacksmith would not be bad for him either.

Taesan examined the ring. The ring had not only simple stats but also special effects.

It seemed that he needed to awaken the ring's ego to confirm its effects.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is it the ring's ego?"

Taesan gently grasped the ring. As his power and aura permeated the ring, the ego that had been dormant within the ring began to awaken.
