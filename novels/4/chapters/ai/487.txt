**Episode 488**

488. 91st Floor. Uroboros (9)

A skill obtained by dealing a critical hit to the labyrinth's magician. Absolute resistance.

When the opponent's level is higher than yours, your level is forcibly raised to match theirs.

Your level rises. You quickly surpass the slow-paced stairs and forcefully kick open the tightly shut door.

Kuung.

The door shakes.

The sound of creaking and the crack spreading starts.

Through the gap, you can see the place beyond the door.

That place is a high realm. A place where transcendent beings who rule the world with divine power have reached. It's the entrance.

Taesan's level is trying to burst through the door.

And at that moment, his mind was reeling from the burden of his raised level.

Just kicking open the entrance was this difficult, so it was easy to imagine how hard it would be to enter directly.

So, it was his true nature, meant for him.

Note: Uroboros is a reference to the ouroboros, a mythological symbol of a snake eating its own tail, often representing cycles and self-reflection. In this context, it may be a name or a title given to a character or a skill.

The effect of the essential power granted to him was simple. By seeing his true nature, observing himself, and knowing himself, he could temporarily contain many things and become a vessel that could hold a lot.

Taesan focused his mind.

Ku-u-ung!

The gold spreading on the door gradually increased. It seemed like it would break at any moment, but the door didn't break. It stood firm, as if it was saying, "You're not allowed to pass yet."

But Taesan didn't notice that.

He was looking at something else.

His field of vision was filled with a dark, distorted world. A chaotic, jumbled space where he couldn't discern his true nature.

It was his subconscious.

Taesan had also tried to read his own subconscious many times, but he had failed every time. Even though it was his own subconscious, he couldn't read or understand it himself.

But now...

Taesan focused his mind.

The power to observe and see his own true nature was his essential power.

He could see deeper than ever before.

He delved deep into his subconscious, observing his inner self and exploring his own mind.

He entered the distorted, chaotic world, and at its deepest point, Taesan could see something. There was something inside him.

"That's it."

Amelia said, recalling the existence that Half-ran had mentioned was hidden within him.

Its true form appeared as something in front of her eyes.

It was something that couldn't be identified as human or beast, and its true nature was unknown. The power that couldn't be grasped obscured her vision and senses, making it impossible to determine what it was.

But one thing was certain.

It was looking at Taesan.

A certain emotion was felt in the gaze directed at Taesan.

It was unclear whether that emotion was hostility or friendliness.

The gazes of the two parties met, and the unknown entity that had been staring at Taesan slowly moved. It was as if it was yielding its place, backing away from Taesan.

Something was consumed by an unknown power and disappeared.

Kwaaaang!

And in that moment, the door burst open.

The door that had been desperately holding on suddenly couldn't withstand the force, and the place beyond it was completely revealed. Taesan's strength reached an unprecedented level in an instant.

All of this happened in the blink of an eye.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The worthless person who realized something was off late finally moved on their own. They gave up trying to slowly take control of the space and instead tried to swallow the Taesan into themselves.

If it were the previous Taesan, even if they had a boundary, they would have had to risk their life to respond.

But it wasn't the case now.

Taesan drew his sword. The boundary was raised.

The boundary was different from before.

It was a deep, dark gray, like ink.

The sword flashed. It collided with the worthless person who was charging.

Ka-ga-ga-kak!

With a strong rebound, the worthless person was sent flying.

The boundary didn't stop. It stuck to the worthless person, trying to dye everything in a grayish hue.

The worthless person raised their arm and swung it.

Kuuuuung!

With a strong rebound, the grayish hue burst out in all directions. The dome-shaped barrier shook violently.

"Ha."

Taesan burst out laughing.

He had now reached the entrance to a high level of mastery.

Although it was a shortcut and a temporary state, the fact that he had achieved it couldn't be erased. He felt an immense power that he had never experienced before.

"Let's do it again."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Taesan is unleashing its power. Its speed is far surpassing its previous level. A worthless being is pulling up its energy and covering the world.

Kwaaaang!

The Taesan is drawing its boundary line. With its sword as the center, the boundary line is revealing its form to the world. The boundary line is engulfing the sword, increasing its size, and becoming enormous.

Kwagagang!

The energy is exploding and bursting out. The Taesan is swinging its hand.

[You have activated the Great Collapse [Chaos].]

The Great Collapse is manifesting in the world and accelerating. Previously, it was blocked by the formless energy and disappeared.

But it's not the case now. The Great Collapse is colliding with the formless energy, consuming its power, and growing stronger.

The Taesan is revealing this and gathering even more power.

And Essential, who was watching from outside the dome, let out a shout of amazement.

"Wow."

The look in his eyes was an uncontrollable admiration.

"I didn't think the power I gave would be at that level."

Essential realized that the Taesan had used some kind of power to raise its level to match that of the worthless being.

And that it had used the power he gave to stabilize it, he thought."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But that was strange. His power was clearly providing absolute stability to the boundary through the observation of the essence, but its effect was limited. There was no ability to maintain the boundary stably at a level that was unreachable.

"It's still twisted."

And what was that twist?

A rough guess went through his mind. Essential laughed with joy.

"That's also appearing. The world has certainly changed a lot. Show me what you have. A mixed existence."

* * *

[You activated mental acceleration.] [You activated acceleration.] [You activated intense strike.]

Kwaaaang!

He swung his sword.

The material energy burst out and was pushed back.

But as much as it was consumed, it flowed back out from the worthless one.

"There's no end."

Taesan clicked his tongue. He was now on the same level as the worthless one. He wasn't being pushed back even from the front. No, the boundary line was superior, making it a more advantageous state.

So he thought he would remove the material energy with a direct attack and then approach, but no matter how much he removed, it didn't end. It kept flowing out more than what was consumed.

The divine power was unchanging. Its power was absolutely not consumed.

Taesan realized its true meaning.

"It can't go on like this."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The true power of the boundary line lies in its ability to distort and interfere with the laws. However, to do so requires extremely delicate control. In the current state where we are transcending the limits, it was impossible.

Even if that weren't the case, the method to interfere with and distort the laws through Gosin was still unknown. We could only engage in a pure power struggle.

'A prolonged battle is futile.'

The boundary that had reached the other side of the gate was slowly being pushed back, as if it was not allowed to exist. An unknown power was supporting it, but it was also on the verge of collapse.

Then, I changed my tactics.

Gosin's power does not dwindle. However, it seemed that there was a limit to the amount of energy that could be released at once with that small fragment. Then, I would overwhelm it with power beyond that limit.

[You have activated the downfall of all things.] [You have activated the purification of the impure.] [You have activated the law of discipline.]

Kyiiiing!

A tremendous authority envelops the world. The entire body of the worthless one distorts, and the energy flowing out suddenly decreases.

Taesan did not miss that opportunity. With his current power, he could mix the boundary line with all his might.

[You have activated the call of destruction [Chaos].]"

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The power of destruction, tainted with a dark aura, reveals itself to the world. It wildly charges forward to devour the gods.

Kuuuuung!

The powers collide. Taesan stretches out his hand into the void.

[You have activated the World's Sword [Chaos].]

The dark-aura-tainted sword reveals itself to the world.

It wildly swings its sword, scraping the dome and charging towards the worthless ones.

The worthless ones gather their energy fiercely. The powers collide.

Kuuuuung!

[You have activated the Great Collapse [Chaos].] [You have activated Baal's designated space collapse.]

Taesan is engaged in a pure power struggle against the fragments of the gods.

And Taesan does not back down.

Kagagak!

He slowly tramples the surging energy. The influence of the worthless ones, who had dominated the entire space, begins to wane.

And when he reaches the climax, Taesan unleashes all his power.

[You have activated Memorize.]

He unleashes all the power he has accumulated. Instantly, Taesan's power blows open the space, creating a long path.

Taesan does not miss the opportunity.

He wraps the boundary line around his entire body and charges towards the worthless ones.

[You have activated the transformation.] [You have activated the sword of determination.] [You have activated the addition.] [You have activated the absolute judgment.] [You have activated the acceleration.] [You have activated the skill acceleration.]

With the sword containing everything, I charge forward. The worthless one's energy is exhausted even before they can react, and I reach their vicinity in an instant.

At that moment, the worthless one's body collapses and rushes towards the mountain. The infinitely condensed worthless energy, which was too dense, has gained value instead.

That is the worthless one's true power.

The ability to devour the world using oneself.

If I had that ability, I could have pushed back even the current mountain's boundary line head-on.

So, the mountain didn't think of responding with its boundary line. It knew that if it approached, the worthless one would unleash its full power.

The mountain didn't dodge. Instead, it charged forward head-on.

Thud.

The worthless one's power devours the mountain.

And at that moment, the mountain's ability was activated.

"Stop."

With the declaration, time in the world comes to a halt.

The power to manipulate time, time interference.

Can the power of the gods be countered with the power of the gods?

Even though the mountain possessed self-immutability, it couldn't ignore the power of the time-manipulating monster's underling, which was used by the gods themselves.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But one thing was certain - the fact that time interference could be used against even the strongest powers had been confirmed.

Hah!

The movement of the worthless being suddenly stopped. It was a momentary pause, and in an instant, it broke free from the time interference that had bound it and moved again, but that was enough.

Taesan pierced the boundary line with his sword.

The worthless being quickly defended itself, but Taesan didn't stop. He strengthened the boundary line and struck it with even greater force.

Kuuuuung!

He forcibly broke through the defense.

He pierced the core with his sword. The core and the sword tip collided.

Kwaduk!

The core cracked instantly. As the source of the worthless being, the core was extremely sturdy. However, Taesan's attack power, mixed with the boundary line, was able to pierce it in one blow.

A massive explosion occurred in an instant. The worthless thing gained value and swept everything in its path.

[You have activated the Chaos Domain.] [You have activated Copy.] [You have activated the Distorted Ring of the Regretful.] [You have activated Copy.]

Even that final struggle was consumed.

As Taesan was now, he could even activate Copy in the Chaos Domain."

"The space dyed in a dark color is copied, and its total amount quadruples in an instant. It was a power that exceeded the limits, something that even the current Taesan couldn't handle.

So, it's not suppressed.

[You have activated the possibility denial.]

The possibility of the chaotic domain, which has broken free from control, reaching Taesan is eliminated and erased.

All resistance from the worthless ones is crushed and shattered.

Taesan stretches out his hand and grasps the broken core.

Quadruple destruction!

The core of the worthless ones loses all its power and disappears.

The origin of the universe, which had been bound by Oroboros for an immeasurable amount of time, is erased from the universe. The dome-shaped structure loses its form and slowly collapses.

And Taesan forcibly grasps the scattered power.

"Give it to me."

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

A fragment of the divine. That power is absorbed by Taesan. It changes into his complete and utter possession, without any resistance or backlash."

Note: Oroboros is a mythological symbol of a snake eating its own tail, often representing the cyclical nature of time. In this context, it seems to be used to describe a powerful and ancient entity that has been bound or sealed away.
