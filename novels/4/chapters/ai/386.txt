**Episode 387**

**387. The Sixth Return, Earth (4)**

Kim Hwi-yeon followed Hasan's words. Before long, they gathered in a secluded spot, away from people, with Gang Tae-san, Geum Jung-geun, Lee Tae-yeon, Gang Jun-hyeok, and Kim Hwi-yeon and Hasan, making a total of six people.

"What? Isn't the leader of India? We couldn't even meet, so why did you come here?"

Geum Jung-geun's pupils widened as he looked at Hasan. He also knew the current situation, having made efforts to contact India. Hasan smiled wryly.

"Hello."

"Hasan, it seems like you're not hostile towards us, so I'll ask. Why did India reject us like that?"

Kim Hwi-yeon asked, but Hasan didn't answer.

He looked around at her, Tae-san, and Lee Tae-yeon, then opened his mouth as if he had made up his mind.

"There's one favor I'd like to ask."

"What favor...?"

"Can I have a duel with Tae-san?"

"What?"

Kim Hwi-yeon was taken aback. Hasan fixed his unwavering gaze on Tae-san.

Tae-san nodded his head.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It doesn't matter."

"Thank you."

Hasan drew his sword. He revealed his power with a serious face.

"Oh."

"This is quite..."

Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk were amazed. It wasn't something they could reach, but it wasn't a power to be underestimated either. It was a power that could only be obtained by reaching the 40th floor.

"If it's you, Taesan sir, you can easily defeat someone like me. So, I have a request. Please face me with all your might."

"Alright."

Taesan accepted.

The duel was established, and Hasan prepared to move his body with a serious face.

"Ah."

But he stopped right there.

Taesan was just staring at him without doing anything.

Just that was enough to make Hasan's entire body tremble like an aspen leaf. His entire body was drenched in cold sweat.

"Ah, ah, ah..."

Eventually, Hasan's eyes rolled back, and he collapsed. Kim Hwi-yeon, who was watching, was shocked and caught the fallen Hasan.

"Taesan sir, what did you do?"

"A simple pressure."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He showed Hasan what he could do using his willpower. Just that was enough to crush Hasan's spirit and make him collapse.

"Huh."

Lee Tae-yeon clicked his tongue. A 40th-floor player couldn't resist at all and simply fainted from the pressure.

The others wouldn't be much different. It was a power that didn't even think about resisting, despite being the same level of difficulty.

"Ugh..."

It didn't take long for Hasan to wake up.

He stared blankly at Taesan, then soon wore a bitter smile.

"What kind of monster are you, to be in this situation? You're still twisted, aren't you?"

"Are you trying to cooperate with us?"

"I am. But the rest is different."

Hasan let out a sigh to calm himself down.

"I'm clearly their leader, but I don't have any real power. I'm just a decorative figurehead."

"What's going on...?"

"Where do I even start explaining?"

Hasan scratched his head with a complicated expression.

"Let me start from the beginning. After the world went to hell and monsters started appearing, we barely managed to survive. But people's spirits kept getting weaker. Even those who managed to survive started committing suicide."

Please let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Kim Hwi-yeon nodded his head. They were no different. The peaceful world had collapsed, and suddenly they had to fight for their lives. There were many who couldn't accept it and had fallen apart.

"We overcame the crisis and continued to live. The monsters weren't that strong, after all."

As all the power was concentrated in Korea, other countries were relatively at ease. Indian players could live with hope for the future.

"The problem started from there. The caste system began to revive."

"The caste system? I heard it had largely disappeared nowadays."

"That's what it was like originally. But as the world fell apart and laws became meaningless, the world began to regress to the past. People started discriminating against each other and oppressing one another."

"You mean the caste system... like Brahmin and Kshatriya?"

"Yes. The highest caste, Brahmin. The next caste down, Kshatriya. And then Vaishya, Shudra, and the untouchable Chandalas. The people from the top two castes started gathering to seize power."

"Isn't that a bit strange?"

Geum Jung-geun, who had been quietly listening, opened his mouth to speak.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's unpleasant to say this, but the labyrinth is extremely egalitarian. As you gain real power, your social status becomes meaningless. But they're talking about a class system. I think it's impossible.

In reality, Korea was the same. During the first return, politicians and civic group leaders tried to do something with their social power, but they all got killed by monsters. The class system on Earth was meaningless at the point where the world was destroyed.

But Hasan shook his head.

"That's how it was originally. In reality, the class system itself was destroyed, and everyone was equal. But... the Brahmins and Kshatriyas of hard mode moved."

Hasan bit his lip.

"They pulled in the Vaishyas and Shudras of the same hard mode to their side."

"Ah."

Geum Jung-geun finally realized what was going on.

"Modern India's class system was collapsing. There were many who didn't like that. They took advantage of the labyrinth and pulled people in."

If you're with us, you can also gain power.

Your descendants and children can live as nobles and royalty forever.

We have that kind of power. We have the qualifications for that.

That's what they preached."

Note: The text appears to be a passage from a fantasy novel or game, and it references Indian caste system terms such as Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The world has been ruined. Those with power wanted to create a hierarchy in their minds. Under their cooperation, a perfect class system was established in no time. I couldn't even intervene from within the hard mode.

As a result, the caste system was perfectly revived in India.

"The situation is different from China."

In China, the class system was established under the overwhelming strongman, Jinryong. No matter how high a position one held, they were ultimately under Jinryong.

But India was different. In India, the class system was revived under the cooperation of a majority of hard mode players. Their rules were extremely solid and wouldn't be easily broken.

"We had the luxury of pursuing something more than just life. In reality, hard mode players could easily defeat monsters. That reality solidified India's class system."

Hasan continued to speak as if spitting out words.

"They established a class system and began to manipulate religion according to their own will. There were some who opposed them, but their numbers were too great and their power too strong, so there was no way to stop them."

"Didn't they try to pull you in, Hasan?"

"They approached me too. But I refused."

Hasan said with a bitter smile.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'm the lowest rank. I was a Chandala. If I accepted their will, I would be comfortable, but my colleagues and friends would suffer. Above all, people should be equal. We shouldn't be divided by rank."

Hasan said this with strong conviction, as if it was an undeniable truth.

Taesan looked at him like that.

It didn't seem like he was receiving any special divine support, unlike Amelia. He had reached the 40th floor solely on his own strength. In a way, he was more impressive than Lee Tae-yeon or Kang Joon-hyuk.

However, in his past life, he hadn't seen Hasan.

The answer was clear.

Hasan was a good person. And good people were willing to sacrifice their lives for others.

Perhaps in his past life, he had lost his life on Earth for the sake of others.

"I opposed them, but I didn't have the power to defeat them all. If a full-scale conflict were to occur, someone would eventually die. I didn't like that, so I compromised a little at a time."

As a result, Hasan lost his right to speak.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As the strongest player, I'm pretending to be respected, but in reality, I'm being despised as a lowly creature. The players from other countries who joined us have obtained the rank of Chandala. Right now, India is a playground for hard-mode players."

"......This is a story that Seo Jang-san would love to hear."

Kim Hwi-yeon smiled wryly. Seo Jang-san, a hard-mode player from Korea, had also tried to do something similar. If Taesan hadn't stopped him, he would have had a high chance of success.

"It's okay, though. At least many people are still alive."

Hasan's face contorted.

"But the story has changed now."

Hasan turned his gaze to Taesan.

"You're a monster. You're stronger than any existence I've ever met. And yet, you're not saving the world."

Considering the level of monsters invading India, it was an impossible task. Taesan alone would have to wipe them all out to be normal.

But that wasn't the case.

"The monsters we've been dealing with so far are just fragments. The real monsters are targeting you. That's why we've been able to take it easy."

"I know that. That's the correct answer."

"Th...that's right."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Hasan's face fell gloomily. His prediction had come true, but it was the worst-case scenario, so he couldn't be happy about it.

"If we go on like this, the Indian players won't be able to survive."

There was no chance of winning without Taesan's help.

That's why Hasan had come to this place, avoiding the gaze of the Brahmins.

"I'm trying to persuade them, but they won't listen to me. They don't want to give up the power they've grasped."

"So that's why you've come to us."

"Yes. Please, I beg of you. Help us so that many lives aren't lost."

Hasan pleaded desperately.

Everyone was silent, deep in thought, when Taesan spoke up.

"What do you mean by 'help'?"

"Huh?"

"I can crush the hard-mode players with my power and save them. But what would change?"

"Uh..."

Hasan couldn't answer.

"If I crush them with my power and rule over them, will they follow my orders? In the end, it's just a matter of an absolute ruler appearing above the hierarchy. The fundamental problem wouldn't be solved at all."

"......"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Can't you find the way yourself and then come to us for an answer? Go away. Come back only when you've figured it out yourself."

Haesan didn't say a word when Taesan spoke.

"Taesan, what's going on?"

After Haesan left, Kim Huiyeon asked cautiously, looking at the cracks in the sky. Taesan replied:

"What's the point of doing it?"

"Or, with Taesan's power, I'll make them follow me……"

"But I've said it before - the fundamental problem hasn't been solved. We can survive for now, but nothing will change."

Taesan opened his mouth.

"I'll definitely save people. But I won't save everyone."

"...".

Kim Huiyeon didn't respond.

She also knew that it was impossible to save everyone, and it was pointless to force Taesan to do so.

"Don't worry. I won't just leave them be."

Taesan said.

He wasn't a saintly figure.

Still, he thought he could save as many people as possible. If Taesan had only valued efficiency, the number of survivors would be less than half of what it is now.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, if one is determined to seek something, it would be better to seek something that benefits oneself as well.

Tae-san had thoroughly filtered his faith, which came to him.

His level was beyond the boundary, and he was sticking his head out further than his expectations. His speed was much faster than expected.

"'I must be a being in this world, after all.'"

The world that was on the verge of destruction was not where Tae-san was born and raised. Therefore, the faith gathered there was intense.

However, the earth was different. Tae-san was born and raised here. So, he was receiving faith from humans on earth. As a result, a more fundamental and profound faith was gathering.

"'This is the extent, then.'"

It was possible that this return might surpass the boundary.

Tae-san was thinking of taking action for himself.

Time passed. Haha, despite trying to persuade the Brahmins, they ridiculed and mocked him.

What a coward! A traitor who wants to be friends with unbelievers. You'll prove the weakness of that Tae-san and block his waves, they said.
Here is the translation of the text:

Hesan did not give up, but nothing changed. Those who had not experienced the Braman did not think of relinquishing their power.

In the end, time passed without any notable achievements.

People formed a line, preparing for the wave. The Bramans at the front of the line confidently waited for the wave.

They quickly dealt with the monsters and intended to enjoy their power again. They were only thinking about this.

And then the monsters appeared.

[Wave start.] [Woohoo!] [Monster 987 appears.] [Monster 378 appears.] [Monster 148 appears.]

* * *

"Oh..."

Indian players in easy and normal mode are tense, waiting for the wave. Many people pray and beg for God's salvation.

However, the faces of the hard mode players at the front line did not show any anxiety or fear. Their faces were full of laughter, as if they were playing a game.

"Who will defeat the most monsters this time?"

"Let's bet? The person who defeats the most monsters will receive 200 gold and 10,000 Chandeliers."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ten thousand? That's too few. We should give at least a hundred thousand. It's a special festival, and we can't make it too small, can we?"

People were treated like possessions. And nobody thought it was strange.

They had absolute power. Nobody could stop them or interfere with them.

The reason was one: they had power.

After they acquired a certain level of power, they almost never risked their lives on Earth.

Each of them could crush dozens of monsters on their own without getting hurt.

It was a hard mode, so with over a million of them, they could crush the monsters as if they were nothing.

They only needed themselves.

They were lazy, normal, and everything was useless to anyone.

This self-confidence twisted their thinking even more.

"How are we going to get out of this? It looks like we're going to cooperate with another group."

"Just leave it. I don't think it's worth getting involved. We can just ignore it."

Although he was alone, he was still the strongest player. If they directly removed him, there would be a big loss. As long as he was yielding to them, he wouldn't think about getting involved.
Here is the translation of the text:

Someone among them twisted their faces.

"What's most important is that the other group will soon become ours," he said.

In response, a mocking laughter echoed.

"You're just a bunch of cowards who worship one human being. What's the point of trampling on them?"

"Are you going to cry out in despair when you see us handling the monsters, turning into slaves?"

They knew the situation in Korea. So they mocked and ridiculed Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese people.

Those who couldn't live without relying on a single human being were indeed weak. It was really pathetic.

Even Taesan, a clear-cut strong person, would be similar in level to a mountain, and could be trampled on with ease. They thought that way.

This time, they planned to swallow Russia and Korea whole.

At that time, when they were dreaming of a bright future, the Wave began.

"Let's settle things quickly."

The space expanded, and monsters appeared.

Most monsters were not that impressive, just on the level of those they had defeated so far.
However, there were monsters that had never been seen before among them.

[Oh no!][Monster 987 has appeared!][Monster 378 has appeared!][Monster 148 has appeared!]

"...what?"

"Is it a three-digit number?"

The faces of the Indian players suddenly turned pale with shock.

What they saw was the end of a four-digit number.

The four-digit monster is quite strong, but it's not threatening to their lives, and they can easily defeat it by combining their strength.

"...it's the first time I've seen a three-digit number."

"There's no big difference."

They were slightly tense, but they didn't have any more intense emotions.

Even if it's a three-digit number, they can still dominate it. They didn't doubt it.

Hard-mode players charged at the monsters. The monsters stared blankly at them.

"Die!"
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The person in front pulled out a weapon. It was the man who had first proposed the bet.

The monster moved its body.

Its head separated from its body.

“Ah?”

[Oh! Oh! Oh!]

A loud explosion occurred simultaneously with the sound. Indian hardcore players like shrapnel were scattered in all directions.
