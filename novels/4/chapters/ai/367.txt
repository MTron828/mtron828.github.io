368. World, Community

A determined power has been materialized as a blue gemstone in front of the mountain.

The gem slowly descended onto the mountain's hand. With a cool sensation, the gem settled in his palm.

[You have obtained Determinized Blood.]

"Blood of Determination?"

[It is a part of the power that I possess. How you handle it is entirely up to you.]

Maria spoke calmly.

[You can graft and wield it yourself. Or you can use it as a material to craft a weapon. But at least for now, it would be too much for you to handle.]

The mountain gazed at the Blood of Determination.

Though the blue gem was stable, it contained a terrifyingly strong power.

Even the current mountain found it hard to handle such power.

[Determinized Blood can only be obtained by you. It is a one-of-a-kind reward given to you in this world.]

"Thank you."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was just as Maria had said. The divine blood was a power that no one could obtain unless they were born with it. The emperor had tried to obtain it in the form of a sacrifice, but it was unclear whether it would really succeed.

He had obtained a power that was impossible to get through normal means. That alone was enough value.

[This is a reward and a kind of expectation. You've become strong enough to handle it. Then you'll be able to appreciate its value.]

Maria chuckled.

[This is a reward for passing my trial well. Don't you have any questions? Ask away.]

"Then I'll ask boldly, despite the impertinence."

Taesan opened his inventory.

In Taesan's hand was a very small, flower-shaped ornament. The seven petals were colorful like a rainbow.

[Maria's Gift] [A gift given to a human loved by the gods. It has no effects yet.]

"What is this thing used for?"

It was the reward Maria had given him when they first met.

It was a very long time ago. He was only on the 12th floor, and was weaker than the current Lee Tae-yeon or Gang Joon-hyuk.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But I still couldn't handle the gift Maria had given me back then. Every time I thought about it, I would activate my core analysis or concentrated detection, but nothing would come out.

[You're asking about that, aren't you? Then I'll answer.]

Maria slowly opened her mouth.

[That's a gift that can't be used alone. You can use it when you meet someone who has a connection with you.]

"......Who is the person connected to me?"

The person connected to him was already dead. He had turned back time, after all.

Maria also knew that fact.

She had said it when she first met Taesan. He was someone who had turned back time using the power of the snake's vomit, which had been manipulated by the gods and had made a wrong choice.

And she was talking about the person connected to him.

Taesan's eyes sank.

Maria quietly smiled.

[Let's put that off for later enjoyment.]

With those words, Maria's domain began to distance itself.

[I'll be waiting for you in a deeper place. Come down soon.]

With her last, faint voice, Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

'Is it the person connected to me?'

His head was a bit complicated. Taesan fiddled with the flower arrangement.

"Some doubts arose, but one thing was certain. He had cleared the 76th floor.

[The Blood of Determination] [It had solidified the Blood of Determination, stabilizing it. If someone without qualifications tried to control it, it would go out of control.]

The warning-like explanation was also felt by Taesan. Although it was a reward, it couldn't be used immediately.

For now, it was something that had to be possessed, but considering the power of the Blood of Determination, it wasn't a worthless reward. As Maria said, it was something to think about after becoming stronger.

And the rewards for clearing the 76th floor.

[Deep Darkness Forged Armor.] [Strength +900] [Defense +900] [Dark Magic +30] [Dark Magic Resistance +10] [An armor forged by a being who created dark magic, made as a hobby in their own realm. It's a piece of equipment made like a joke, but it contains an enormous power.]

If the being who created dark magic was a demon, then it seemed like a demon-made equipment. The dark magic and resistance values were attached accordingly."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Rough Gemstone Ankle Guard.] [Strength + 500] [Attack Power + 400] [Defense + 500] [One day, a mysterious gemstone fell onto a planet. Many blacksmiths rushed to refine the gemstone, but they died after just a few touches, succumbing to its unknown power. After countless lives were lost, the gemstone finally took the form of an ankle guard.]

It was always a reliable basic clear reward.

And when the emperor was defeated, the divine power upgrade was triggered.

[Your divine power upgrade has been triggered. Your proficiency in divine power has increased by 3%.]

A 3% increase in divine power. At first glance, it seemed like a meaningless upgrade. But to Taesan, who knew the value of divine power, it was a significant increase.

When divine power reached 81%, the upgrade itself stopped. Even though many players on the planet revered Taesan, it didn't budge.

The moment it reached 100%, he would be able to obtain his own divinity, so the upgrade speed was extremely slow.

And yet, it had increased by 3%. It was more valuable than acquiring a mediocre skill.

And the acquired skill...

[Special Activation Skill: Law of Regulation] [Consumption ??? : ???] [Proficiency: 1%] [Summon the realm of regulation and impose its law. The user's level and qualifications are still too lacking to wield this power.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Soul Skill. It was a description similar to the King of Machinery. Just by that, you could tell what kind of skill it was.

This was a power granted only to the apostles of the God of Rules.

It was something brought about by the Soul Ascension.

[Even the Transcendents couldn't help but be impressed... it was really hard to accept.]

Soul Ascension was a power that brought strength regardless of whether the opponent was an immortal, a high-ranking being, or an apostle of God.

It was a truly incomprehensible skill.

The reward was substantial. Although it couldn't be used right away, if one had the qualifications, it was equivalent to being able to use some of God's power. The value of that was by no means small.

Since I had won against the apostle, there was a change in the apostle's transformation. The name remained the same, but the effect of the apostle's transformation was slightly enhanced.

The reward was this much.

Then, it was time to check. Taesan went up to the next floor. Half-ran was waiting, as if expecting him.

"Ah, you're here. I've been waiting for you."

"Is everything done?"

"Yes."

Taesan had entrusted Half-ran with the pure light crystal he had obtained in the Spirit Realm. It seemed that the production was complete.

Half-ran handed Taesan a shimmering light fragment."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I was worried about what to make, but nothing came to mind. So, I decided to go with something simple but powerful."

[Pure White Blessing Powder] [Blessing Powder. Apply it to a weapon to imbue it with its power.] [Attack Power +200] [Can activate [World's Radiance] once an hour.] [World's Radiance] [Summons the light of radiance that has existed since the beginning of time. Repels darkness and defeats evil beings.]

"You can use it with the artifact you have."

"Sounds good."

The pure attack power was quite high. I didn't know the extent of World's Radiance's effect, but I thought it would be useful as a skill similar to forced amplification.

With the freed spirit's abilities fully restored, Taesan sprinkled the powder onto his sword.

"Is that all there is to it?"

"No, I have something to ask."

Taesan showed him the black and white rings on his fingers.

"How were these rings exactly made?"

To use one of the rings, they needed to know exactly how they were made. Half-ran asked, looking puzzled.

"What's got you curious?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The process of making the ring. Did you try to make it in a pair from the start?"

"No, that's not it."

Half-ran shook his head.

"At first, I tried to make it as a single piece of equipment. But the materials were too powerful and unmatched, so they repelled and resisted each other. I almost died because of it."

The materials contained in the ring were also difficult for Half-ran to control.

Half-ran thought deeply about how to stabilize it and finally came to a conclusion.

"I'll make two rings through the same process. Although the materials are different, the appearance may vary, but the manufacturing process is perfectly equal. I'll use that to resonate with each other, amplify the power, and stabilize it. That's how the ring was made."

"Is the manufacturing process the same?"

"It's perfectly identical, without a single error. That's what 'twin' means from the start."

"That's right."

A perfectly identical ring was made.

Then, it was really possible. It may be difficult for now, but the possibility was sufficient.

"That's enough. Thank you."

"You provided the materials and had me make the equipment according to your wishes. Of course, I should answer you. Is that the end?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There's still one more."

Taesan showed the refined blood to Half Ran.

"Can I refine this?"

"……."

Half Ran, who had been gazing at the refined blood, scrunched up his face.

"You've brought something that can't be found even on the 90th floor. Do you think you can do it?"

"Likewise."

Since Taesan hadn't had high expectations from the start, he put the refined blood back in his inventory.

"I'm great, but I'm still a mortal. I wish you'd understand that."

Half Ran grumbled. Taesan bid him farewell and headed back down to the lower floors.

Just as he was about to head towards the 77th floor, system windows suddenly popped up and blocked his view.

They were all about the community. Taesan opened the community window.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Amelia Airin[Alone]:...Why are you guys back already?] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Because we finished early on this side.] [Amelia Airin[Alone]: What's going on? What about the Chinese side? I could feel something big happening.] [Kang Jun-hyuk[Alone]: Ah, that thing... It's a bit of a long story, but...] [Oliver Kan[Hard]: Let's hear it. We need to take a break anyway.]

In the community, many people were chatting.

Taesan realized that other countries had also completed their trials and returned to the labyrinth.

* * *

"It's faster than I thought."

I thought it would take at least half a year, but looking at the people talking, it seemed like every country had completed their quest.

Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Jun-hyuk were explaining their experiences in China to players from other countries.

[Kang Taesan[Alone]: Is everything done?] [Amelia Airin[Alone]: Yes.] [Ichijo Eika[Hard]: Ah, it's been a while. I was curious because there was no news.] [Kang Jun-hyuk[Alone]: That's just how it is. We don't know what we're doing either.] [Kang Taesan[Alone]: There's no need to say anything.]

Taesan slowly explained about the Jinryong. Amelia listened in silence for a moment.

[Amelia Airin[Alone]:...I was similar to you.] [Kang Taesan[Alone]: It's different. You at least used your own strength to clear the labyrinth.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even if the god of downfall had given assistance, it was Amelia's own power that had broken through the labyrinth. It was different from Jinryong, who had left everything to the immortal.

[Kang Tae-san [Ellon] : Well, it turned out well.]

It's been a while since we talked about it in the community. Kang Jun-hyuk and Lee Tae-yeon must have gone down the labyrinth quite a bit too. Even hardcore players were the same.

I thought I'd try to organize things this time around.

[Kang Tae-san [Ellon] : Tell me, how did you guys do it?]"

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
