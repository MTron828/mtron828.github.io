26. 2nd Floor, Secret Room. Boss (11)

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: This seems a bit easy.] [Moon Jae-seong [Alone]: ...I feel like I might die doing this.] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Relatively speaking, it's easier. As long as you time it like a machine, hitting the timing precisely, there shouldn't be any problems.] [Kang Joon-hyuk [Alone]: As soon as you enter the room, shoot paralysis arrows at the three goblins, knock them down for 30 seconds, then shoot three paralysis arrows again. You have to do this nearly ten times without any mistakes, yes. Well, compared to earning endurance, it's easy.]

* * *

[Forced duel? How can you not do this? This is really the first time I've seen this skill.]

"Work hard and do well."

[He got it because the guy on the 2nd floor worked hard? Funny.]

The ghost chuckled as if it had been deceived.

[Someone with such a skill wouldn't let it go. Where did you get the information?]

The ghost seemed to think he had heard about forced dueling from someone.

Taesan kept that thought to himself.
Here is the English translation of the text:

Chewing on skewers, it was a difficult answer to give, but he was very grateful for letting him have his delusions.

"But skills aren't everything. I understand you've obtained good skills, but don't become arrogant, okay?"

"Just answer the questions properly."

"...Damn it."

The ghost shuddered.

* * *

The ghost continued to grumble, clearly displeased with Taesan's victory. Taesan listened with one ear as he wandered through the labyrinth.

"Forced dueling is a good skill, but there are many skills in the labyrinth, you know? You're not Leap, are you?"

"I know."

"...You know?"

"But why Leap? Couldn't you learn a major Leap?"

"W-what's a major Leap?"

"I guess you didn't learn it."

Taesan said sullenly. The ghost groaned at his words.

"I'll admit it. You know your skills well. But the labyrinth isn't just about that. How you live here and what you discover are also important, you know? So, what are you doing now?"

"What does it look like I'm doing?"

Taesan was examining the bricks in an empty room. The ghost realized belatedly.

"A secret room? You must be having a hard time."

Here is the English translation of the text:

---

Exploring this kind of secret room was pure grunt work. There was no choice but to check every single brick in the room.

There were two ways to reduce it: increase the number of heads or have special skills. It was one of the two.

[You had a strong hunch.]

Among the countless bricks, one caught Taesan's eye. Taesan stared at it for a moment and then walked over. He grabbed and pulled the brick.

Shhh.

As the brick moved in, the secret room revealed itself.

[Huh?]

"As expected, good."

It was an ability that appeared as Taesan's Insight skill proficiency exceeded 20%. Occasionally, it would inform you of important information.

Appearing to Taesan in the form of a hunch, in that moment, all the problems plaguing his mind were resolved.

It had the effect of skipping through essential Try-Error sections necessary for penetrating the labyrinth in one breath.

The ghost seemed to realize that Insight had been activated and muttered in a bewildered voice.

[...Insight too? And proficiency exceeding 20%?]

Taesan entered the secret room. Inside, he saw numerous passages covered with traps.

"Are these goblin traps?"

Here is the English translation of the text:

---

[It's a trap used to store items they consider valuable. It might be difficult to break through since the traps are set randomly. It could be a good choice to give up and turn back.]

Taesan silently observed the traps.

The first trap was an arrow trap.

The second trap appeared to be a pitfall in the floor.

And the third and fourth seemed to be sliding wall traps.

It's just like Easy Mode. Taesan walked into the traps.

[Huh?]

Ping!

He deflected the flying arrows.

He avoided the floor with the trap that would give way underfoot.

With a grinding sound, the wall started to move, attempting to crush Taesan.

Quickly, Taesan ran and instead of trying to escape the moving wall, he clenched his fist and struck towards it.

Kwaaang!

The bricks turned into sand. Taesan brushed his hands together with a grim expression.

"Same as before."

The moving wall itself is a trap for traps. If he were to rush forward to escape, dozens of traps would activate simultaneously.

It's not impossible to get through, but it would be quite a struggle.

The easiest way to clear it is to break through the wall.

Unlike the labyrinth walls, the moving walls are made by goblins.

Their durability isn't very high, so they could be smashed with a fist.
Here is the English translation of the text:

Taesan calmly disabled each trap and walked through the passage.

[......]

The ghost closed its mouth and followed quietly. At the end of the passage, a small box appeared. Taesan pulled a lever, destroying all the traps, and checked inside.

[Ring imbued with mana] [Mana +5] [A ring found in a hidden spring deep underground, emitting a faint, pure fragrance.]

"A mana ring?"

A pleased confusion mixed on Taesan's face. An increase in mana was always welcome.

Furthermore, it wasn't just any accessory but a ring. Unlike necklaces or earrings, it could be worn on any finger, making it the best accessory to obtain.

"Nice."

Taesan put on the ring and happily exited the secret room. The ghost, who had been silent, spoke.

"What are you?"

"If I say 'the second one,' will you understand?"

"The second one?"

There was no sign of understanding. From the ghost's response, Taesan confirmed something.

"It seems I'll need to surpass the 85th floor to obtain the Urboros vomited Wise Stone."


Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

As Taeyeon didn't say anything, he also didn't know how to get it. Knowing that he could get another chance if he did well, he planned to look for it.

Anyway, the story after entering the depths.

Taesan walked through the labyrinth and arrived at the red door.

Taesan went inside. The ghost was surprised at his casual attitude and asked.

"Aren't you going to ask me?"

According to their contract, the ghost had to tell him everything he knew. As an NPC who had descended to the 85th floor, he must know who the boss of the 2nd floor was and how to attack him.

"I don't need to."

Taesan already knew who the boss of the 2nd floor was. He had asked the ghost about something else.

"Huh?"

There were two goblins in the boss room.

One was an ordinary goblin, but the other was different.

Unlike the goblins so far, it was dressed in fancy cloth clothes.

It wore a long hat and held a sturdy wooden staff in its hand.

"A goblin with a staff appeared." "A guarding goblin appeared."

"Kekek!"

The goblin swung the staff. At its end, magical power began to gather. A goblin that looked like a bodyguard protected it.

The boss of the 2nd floor was a goblin with a staff.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

Using it is magic.

It was the first time he encountered an enemy using magic in Alone Mode. In Easy Mode, monsters could appear beyond the 40th floor.

"Kyaak!"

While the magic was being cast, a goblin guarding it rushed towards Taesan. Taesan calmly looked on and raised his sword.

Slash!

"Kuk, kaak!"

The goblin was slammed into the ground. Taesan stabbed its back. After about three stabs, the guard disappeared, dead.

[You have defeated the guarding goblin.]

Meanwhile, the spell was completed. Taesan watched impassively.

Normally, this was the wrong approach.

Low-level players have no way to block magic.

Ignoring the guards, or shooting paralysis arrows and dealing with the wizard right away, is the correct answer. Lee Taeyeon had suffered greatly for not knowing that.

However, Taesan deliberately left the wizard alone. The ghost seemed frustrated and grumbled.

"Ah. This isn't how it's supposed to go. You know the skills, but not the tactics."

In his eyes, Taesan seemed to be using the wrong method.

But for Taesan, this was the right way.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

"Kaak!"

The staff glowed.

[The goblin wielding the staff triggered confusion.] [Rolling for check.] [Confusion check in progress......]

Your mind wavers. Something external tries to invade your consciousness. Various images come and go in rapid succession.

[. . .]

The check for confusion magic is extremely strict. Any slight mistake or mental wavering results in immediate failure. You lose yourself and go mad.

"Clear."

Taesan shook his head. The impending confusion is deflected.

[Successful check!] [You withstand with indomitable mental strength!] [All stats have increased.]

"Kyaak!"

The goblin uses magic again. Taesan waits patiently.

[The goblin wielding the staff triggered frenzy.] [Rolling for check.] [Frenzy check in progress......]

"I told you to clear out."

[Successful check!] [You withstand with indomitable mental strength!] [Your action speed has increased.] [Goodbye.]

By this point, even the ghost realized.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

"[So you're just enduring it?] [The goblin wielding the staff triggered a curse.] [No need to roll! You repelled it with unwavering mental strength.]"

Taesan looked sternly at the grumbling goblin. He had never failed a mental check since his previous world. The ghost murmured as if impressed.

"[It's the first time I've seen someone withstand mental magic without skills or items. I couldn't do that either.] [No need to roll! You endured it with unwavering mental strength.] [You have experienced attacks on your mind countless times. You gained the special passive skill [Mental Resistance].]"

A skill that assists in resisting attacks on one's mind. To Taesan, it was also a skill of limited use.

Taesan shook off the confusion and checked the skill.

[Special Passive Skill: Mental Resistance] [Proficiency: 100%] [Very high success rate in all mental checks.]

"So this is the inheritance."

"Huh."

The ghost chuckled sarcastically.

"This is really unbelievable."

Even after gaining Mental Resistance, Taesan remained still without striking the goblin. Instead of urging him on, the ghost lay down on the ground, seemingly annoyed.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

"Darn it. I tried to make him move as I pleased by teaching him this and that, but he turned out to be crazier than I imagined. I never expected things to flow this smoothly."

"Tsk, tsk."

The goblin manifested magic, sweating profusely. The ghost, watching carefully, spoke up.

"They're quite fascinating, these goblins."

"Didn't you use magic in your world?"

"Mages were rare there. I don't know how the maze creator did it, but overall, everyone got stronger. Goblins here are on par with orcs in average strength. Orcs are even stronger than lizardmen."

Indeed, the monsters in the maze seemed stronger than those elsewhere.

"How were the goblins in your world?"

The ghost asked curiously, seeming to guess roughly what kind of person Taesan was and trying to satisfy their own curiosity.

"They didn't exist?"

"...No goblins? Then what about orcs or ogres?"

Taesan chuckled at the names of such popular monsters.

"Why would we have those?"

"Then what did you have?"

"Nothing much. At best, some wild animals."

"That sounds like a pretty easy world."

The ghost muttered strangely.

"Why are you so good at things, coming from a world like that?"
Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

Once again, a confusion check was initiated. This time, too, Taesan succeeded in obtaining the skill he desired.

"You have been affected by magic multiple times. You have acquired the special passive skill [Magic Resistance]."

Magic Resistance. It was a skill that provided damage reduction and resistance against all magic.

It was also a skill that was absolutely necessary for clearing the maze.

Taesan continued to endure and even raised his Magic Resistance.

Only after reaching his limit did he swing his sword.

The goblin, which had been whimpering while casting magic, fell dead.

"You have emerged victorious against the goblin wielding a staff."

"You have received a large amount of experience points." "Your health has recovered by 10." "You have gained 453 gold." "You have obtained a randomly enchanted staff of the mind."

"Oh. A staff?"

To acquire it directly with such low probability was extremely fortunate.

"You have defeated a formidable opponent single-handedly. Your intelligence permanently increases by 2. Your mana permanently increases by 2."
Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

He also obtained rewards for defeating his enemies. Magic was not originally supposed to emanate from the lower levels. Taesan practically had immunity in terms of mental judgment, so he won; otherwise, he would have struggled through various curses and confusions.

In reality, Itaeyeon had come dangerously close to dying here.

"Your spiritual rise has been triggered. Agility permanently increases by 1. Intelligence permanently increases by 2." "You have defeated the boss on the 2nd floor. You obtained the basic reward [Beginner Mana Increase Potion]." "You have identified a hidden element on the 2nd floor. Reward: [???]."
