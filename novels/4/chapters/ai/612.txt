**Chapter 613**

613. Easy Mode. Temporary Time Stop (1)

"This can't be."

Taesan muttered to himself. In front of him were countless scars that couldn't be counted.

All of them were knife wounds he had inflicted on himself.

It was the trace of two months' time.

He had failed to acquire the skill he had invested in for two months. Taesan cracked his neck.

He was currently in easy mode. He was on the 74th floor.

* * *

"I thought it was uncertain, but I really couldn't get it."

Taesan grumbled and put a piece of dried meat in his mouth. At first, he thought it was possible. The conditions were relatively clean, and the difficulty of acquisition was moderate. So, he thought that if he invested time, he could get it, but it wasn't.

Even though he had perfectly fulfilled the conditions, the system window was eerily quiet. It meant that there was no skill to be acquired with those conditions.

Two months of effort had been in vain.

However, Taesan didn't despair or feel disappointed.

"It's cheap to have been deceived for just two months."

"I've invested a year's worth of time, but I've also gained skills that are useless anywhere. It's a waste.

But what's sad is sad.

I wanted to grab someone and vent my frustrations. Taesan looked up at the labyrinth.

This is the 74th floor.

The labyrinth was filled with only silence.

"Is anyone there?"

Taesan muttered to himself. The echo of his voice resonated without an answer.

I wonder if there are still players remaining in easy mode? I don't know. It's been a long time since I last saw a player.

Taesan opened the community board.

And what he saw was a flood of despairing posts.

[Lee Tae-yeon[Alone] : Ahhhhh! I hate it! I hate it! I hate it! I'm sick of it!!!!]

Taesan didn't react and scrolled past the despairing posts. It wasn't surprising anymore.

[Kang Taesan[Ezi] : Why is he like that?] [Choi Gain[Hard] : ……What's up, Taesan? You still haven't left?]

A surprised post appeared.

Choi Gain, a hard mode player who frequently used the community board. He was a player who had a bit of a connection with Taesan. Taesan replied calmly."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Kang Tae-san [Easy]: I didn't go out, so I'm here. Why are you asking the obvious?] [Choi Ga-in [Hard]: Ah, no. Mr. Tae-san, aren't you in easy mode? You didn't clear the stage, did you?] [Kang Tae-san [Easy]: I don't know. I haven't seen another player in years. Maybe they passed me by without me noticing, or maybe they're really not here.] [Choi Ga-in [Hard]: ……Aren't you lonely?] [Kang Tae-san [Easy]: What's it to you?]

Tae-san replied indifferently. Choi Ga-in asked with a curious tone.

[Choi Ga-in [Hard]: Are you still trying to get skills? Geez. Do you really need to do that? We've already won, haven't we?] [Kang Tae-san [Easy]: We won.]

They had won.

There was no need to get more skills.

Tae-san didn't respond and changed the subject.

[Kang Tae-san [Easy]: Then, aren't you going out?] [Choi Ga-in [Hard]: I want to go out, but I don't have the talent. I'm stuck.]

Most hard mode players had cleared the 100th floor and gone out into the world. Geum Jung-geun was among them. The only ones left were those who were left behind, so to speak.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Hardiest [Hard]: I'm going to take it easy going down. We've got time, don't we? If we rush and die, it'll be a real shame.]

[Taesan [Easy]: That's true.]

[Tae-yeon [Alone]: Ahhh! I hate it! I hate it now! Guys, help me!!!]

[Taesan [Easy]: What's wrong with him?]

[Hardiest [Hard]: Is he a guide for sinners or something? He's got a grudge against those guys who are chasing him.]

[Taesan [Easy]: Are those the ones who always make a racket?]

Tae-yeon had written a detailed post on the community about how hard it was and what kind of situation he was in.

Taesan, who had been stuck in the labyrinth for a long time, naturally knew about Tae-yeon's progress.

[Taesan [Easy]: You must be having a tough time.]

[Hardiest [Hard]: Yeah.]

The two of them had a calm conversation.

[Taesan [Easy]: What floor are you on?]

[Hardiest [Hard]: 93rd floor.]

[Taesan [Easy]: Not much left, huh? It's going to get lonely.]

[Hardiest [Hard]: You can come out anytime you want, Taesan. I'll ask you seriously this time.]

Hardiest asked with a puzzled expression.

[Hardiest [Hard]: Why aren't you coming out?]

Taesan was in easy mode. He was special, even among those in easy mode. If he wanted to, he could be the first to clear it in easy mode.

But Taesan was still stuck in the labyrinth.

Hardiest couldn't understand that.

[Hardiest [Hard]: We won, didn't we?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Return to Earth. At first, it was despair itself. Countless people died, and humanity was left with a bleak prospect of extinction.

But as they continued to return, they grew stronger, and the monsters couldn't keep up with their strength.

From the moment all of humanity united, they only knew victory.

And finally, they emerged victorious.

They sealed the gap in the sky and reclaimed the Earth.

That was already a long time ago.

Having savored their victory, they quickly cleared the labyrinth and began to return to Earth. Only the lone mode players and those who had fallen behind in hard mode remained. Easy and normal modes were almost cleared.

Except for one person. Taesan, that is.

[Strongest [Hard] : Of course, we know that Taesan has acquired an unbelievable skill. But we've won. Do we really need to get even stronger?]

They could finally enjoy peace. While it's true that getting stronger is a good thing, it's questionable whether it's worth spending time like Taesan does."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Hardiest [Hard]: I don't think Taesan is someone who's crazy about power, though.] [Gang Taesan [Easy]: I'm not interested in power beyond what it takes to survive. If I need to come out, I can do it right away.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: ……What's going on, Taesan? Are you leaving?]

It seemed like Lee Taeyeon had gained some confidence and intervened.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Don't go, Taesan. I'm lonely. Talk to me. Stay with me in this labyrinth…….]

Taesan smiled faintly, as if he could see the desperation beyond the words.

[Gang Taesan [Easy]: You don't have to worry, I won't be leaving for a while.] [Hardiest [Hard]: Are you going to stay? Why? You said you're not interested in power beyond what it takes to survive.] [Gang Taesan [Easy]: That's exactly why.] [Hardiest [Hard]: ……What do you mean?]

Hardiest couldn't understand Taesan's words.

Taesan couldn't explain it either. It was just his simple intuition.

[Gang Taesan [Easy]: Anyway, I'm not thinking of leaving for a while. Just remember that.] [Hardiest [Hard]: Ah, okay.]

Hardiest looked puzzled but didn't say anything more. Taesan listened to Lee Taeyeon's tantrum for a bit before turning off the community.

He gazed up at the ceiling with a calm expression.

They had won.

They had driven out the monsters and reclaimed the Earth. Now they could return to Earth and enjoy peace.

'But.'"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan felt an overwhelming sense of unease.

It was as if he was caught in a net, deceived by a tantalizing prey, and walked into a trap on his own.

Of course, it was just his simple intuition. The Earth could really be at peace. People could work together to rebuild technology.

But Taesan trusted his intuition.

If the Earth was that simple, why did the Alone Mode, with its impossible difficulty, exist?

Why did even the strongest, Lee Tae-yeon, have to risk his life to clear it?

An inexpressible sense of unease lingered in his mouth.

His intuition and predictions warned him. At this rate, he couldn't return to the Earth.

He needed power.

More powerful.

To do that, what did he need to obtain?

"Am I back to square one?"

Taesan clicked his tongue.

He needed to acquire a powerful skill. Not just a normally powerful one, but an irregular, extraordinary one that surpassed the norm.

He was strong now.

Even in Easy Mode, he had a power that rivaled Hard Mode.

But that was it.

It was ultimately a power within a certain category.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What lies beyond is necessary.

A powerful force that can reach even in alone mode, and can overturn the world alone.

'Is it possible?'

Honestly, I had no idea what to do to acquire such a skill.

The skills he currently possesses. Addition. Forced Duel. Attack Nullification. Great Leap. Landing. Complete Surveillance.

All of them are powerful, but they can't have a huge impact on their own. They're only limited to local effects.

A skill that can overturn everything with just one skill.

A skill that approaches the concept itself.

I need to get that.

Numerous conditions flashed through his mind. Most of them had already been tried and failed. He couldn't acquire the skill or it was completely different from what he had expected.

Tae-san, who had been pondering for a while, scowled.

'...I guess I have to go there eventually.'

He felt a strong sense of reluctance. He had failed there before. He had invested years of time and still couldn't acquire the skill.

But the skill he's about to acquire now is different.

Then, there's a possibility."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan got up from his seat and went down to the 72nd floor. He entered an empty room and pressed a brick.

Rumble!

The sound of the labyrinth moving and the wall opening was heard.

There was a secret room in the labyrinth.

On each floor, if you cleared certain conditions, a hidden room would appear, and there would be an item inside.

Of course, if there was a reward, there would be a corresponding trial. Each secret room had its own unique trap.

And the trap in the 72nd floor's secret room was the most unique one he had ever seen.

Taesan stepped into the secret room.

Thud.

With a pressing sound, thousands of projectiles appeared.

Arrows, balls, throwing stars, flying swords, and even a giant sphere the size of a human body.

Cha-cha-cha-cha-ching!

All the projectiles that burst out of the walls bounced off each other, collided, and moved erratically. The loud clanging sound filled the room.

Taesan looked at the scene with a scrunched-up face.
