**Episode 588**

**588. Extra Story, Arrangement (6)**

They took Hashiangka with them. Originally, they were going to bring all the Narians, but that was deemed too impolite, so they ended up bringing only Hashiangka.

They flew their bodies and arrived at a place far from the city.

A desolate, barren place with nothing around.

He was standing on the cliff there.

"Ah."

Hashiangka unintentionally held her breath.

She didn't feel anything.

If someone who didn't know her saw her, they would think she was just an ordinary person.

But an unknown presence enveloped her.

"Taesan."

Lee Taeyeon, who had approached, opened his mouth. His black hair fluttered.

"You're still here."

"There's nothing else to do."

A low, resonant voice echoed. Taesan's gaze moved, and Hashiangka was caught in its end.

"Ah."

Hashiangka almost stumbled backward unintentionally.

Calm, dark brown eyes.

Even though it was just that, Hashiangka was overwhelmed. And she realized. She realized who the person in front of her was.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Taesan... it's you."

"For a moment."

Taesan snapped his fingers. At the same time, Hasiangka realized.

The broadcast heading back to their home country had been forcibly terminated.

"It doesn't matter to me, but... I don't like being exposed to many people. It's enough now."

Hasiangka barely managed to hold onto her trembling legs and bowed her body as much as possible, showing respect.

"A lowly and small existence like me is honored to meet a great being like you."

The being in front of her was one who had torn apart and killed beings beyond the universe's governance and had saved the universe.

It was not an exaggeration, but a truly powerful existence in the universe.

Hasiangka barely managed to hold onto her trembling body and bit her lip. Taesan opened his mouth.

"You don't need to get my permission. I'm different from other transcendents, and I don't care about that kind of thing."

"Ah, thank you."

Only then did Hasiangka open her mouth. Still bowing her head, she spoke with the utmost respect.

"Great Taesan, sir."

Taesan.

He didn't have any other nickname like other gods.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's just a title, like 'Savior of the Universe.' Only a few people have given him a shameful nickname.

The reason was simple.

It was because Gang Tae-san was Gang Tae-san.

There was no more or less to it. His name itself was a title.

"Gang Tae-san, sir."

Hashiangka stuttered as he spoke, trying his best not to tremble, but his shaking voice was unavoidable.

"We apologize for trespassing on your territory without permission. Please forgive us..."

"Do as you please."

Tae-san cut off Hashiangka's words.

"I have no intention of interfering with Earth. You should stand on your own two feet without relying on me. However... it's a good thing for similar individuals to coexist and help each other."

Gang Tae-san's permission was granted.

Hashiangka let out a sigh of relief, trying not to be heard.

"On the contrary, I should be grateful. I was worried about what to do anyway."

"The development of technology had completely stagnated."

Lee Tae-yeon shrugged his shoulders. Honestly, if Tae-san or the Narai people hadn't come, they might not have acquired technology for several years."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Let's keep in touch and help each other out. That's what I want."

"As you wish, great one."

Gang Tae-san made a direct proposal to her. There was no thought of refusal whatsoever.

On the contrary, it was an honor. To be able to meet someone like her directly and hear her voice.

Ordinary transcenders would have to offer a tremendous amount of tribute just to hear her voice from afar. It was a burden even for the Naria people.

Moreover, making a proposal to them was impossible, no matter how much tribute was offered. It was only possible with the whims of a transcender.

For her, this was an unprecedented honor. She was so thrilled at the thought of returning to her hometown and boasting about it that her breath quickened.

But her good fortune didn't end there.

Tae-san, who was looking down at Hasiangka, opened his mouth.

"Still, from your perspective, it's help without a reward."

"It doesn't matter. Great Gang Tae-san, if you wish it, we will all gladly follow you."

"No. If that's the case, my heart won't be at ease. At the very least, I have to repay you."

"Yes?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Hashiangka's head nodded involuntarily at the unexpected words.

Her dark, piercing eyes were gazing down at her. Those eyes seemed to see through everything.

"Do you have something you want to ask me?"

"......"

"Go ahead and ask. I don't mind."

Permission was granted.

Hashiangka swallowed hard. She spoke the wish she had been holding in her heart to Taesan.

"Oh great and powerful Taesan, can you grant me the permission to witness your power with my own eyes?"

The one who saved the universe.

The one who stood above even the transcenders.

What kind of power did he possess?

Hashiangka was curious to the point of madness. Taesan nodded his head in response to her wish.

"If you want it."

* * *

The spaceship carrying the Narain people takes off into the universe. The main cannon opens, and a massive energy begins to gather there.

"Wow."

Amelia, watching from Earth, clicks her tongue.

"That's not something I can handle. If I got hit, I'd be done for."

"It's not just a matter of getting hit, the entire solar system would be torn apart. This is giving me goosebumps."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This is the culmination of all our technology."

The voice of Hashiangka echoed within the spaceship.

"[If it's a direct hit, even the immortals would be affected, it's the strongest weapon our civilization has built.]"

The main cannon was aimed at Taesan, who was a little distance away from the spaceship.

"[It's a weapon that even we can't control.]"

The power contained within that weapon was something that no defense technology of the Naria people could block.

Originally, it was supposed to be perfectly sealed away, but Hashiangka had secretly taken it out.

"[You are great. Then...…]"

"Alright."

Taesan nodded.

"Fire."

"[Thank you.]"

Kiiiiing!

The main cannon activated.

Countless atoms combined to create a destructive power that exceeded human understanding. Even those who were doing their jobs on Earth looked up at the universe without realizing it.

What gathered there was the energy of an exploding star.

A destructive power that could turn a range of several light-years into a wasteland.

"This technology can reach that far, can't it?"

Taesan muttered to himself. It was a destructive power that left a scar on the universe, just as he said.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If Taesan doesn't stop it, not only the Earth but also Hashiangka will disappear without a trace. Hashiangka closed her eyes.

[Then, please.]

The main cannon was fired.

"Stop."

Taesan said.

And the energy stopped.

[……Huh?]

Hashiangka was shocked. What she had fired was extremely unstable. Once fired, it couldn't be stopped or controlled.

And yet, it had stopped in the middle of space.

Taesan slowly approached the energy. It was shaking as if it would explode at any moment, but it was perfectly controlled by an invisible force.

"The destructive power is certain."

Taesan reached out and grasped the energy.

"That's all."

And it was over.

The energy that could have turned the entire galaxy into ashes disappeared without a trace.

The immense, simple power was like a toy.

[…….]

"Is that it?"

Taesan lightly shook his hand.

* * *

Kiiiiing!

The spaceship left the Earth.

It won't be long before Hashiangka returns. She'll bring many technicians and technologies to make the Earth even more prosperous.

Taesan gazed at her departing figure.

"I guess that's enough to pass the time."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I had a vague idea about the Narrians, but it was the first time I saw them directly.

The technology possessed by the strongest civilization in the universe and their individual strength were stimulating in their own way.

But that was it.

It didn't resonate with Taesan beyond that.

Taesan turned his gaze away. He saw the city developing before his eyes.

As we acquired the Narrians' technology, the Earth would rapidly develop.

We would surpass the past and reach a higher realm.

It would be quite entertaining to watch that unfold.

But that was all.

It wasn't enough to shake Taesan's emotions.

[It seems free.]

A voice echoed.

Taesan turned his head.

He had a massive horn on his head.

His red pupils were like those of a reptile, and a black aura flowed through his entire body.

"Lord Baal."

The only being in the universe who was close to the high gods, a traitor who betrayed his own kind.

[You are revered. You are stronger and more exalted than I.]

"I'm stuck with this title, so I don't know what to do."

[Then, it's only natural to show respect to a being like you.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Great Demon Lord. Baal chuckled. Taesan turned his gaze back to the city.

"What business do you have here?"

[It's finally getting organized.]

Baal spoke lazily.

[The cleaning of annoying things is over. I've got some free time now.]

"You must have been very busy."

[You, on the other hand, are in a rather dull state.]

Taesan didn't respond. Baal opened his mouth as if he understood.

[You've lived a more intense life than anyone. I wonder if there's anyone who's struggled more than you in this world, aside from the God of Struggle.]

In his past life, he sacrificed everything to survive and become stronger. He accumulated achievements that would have made him a god.

It's the same in this life. In the Alone Mode, Taesan did his best to save the Earth. He reacquired the skills from his past life that were nearly impossible to obtain, and even acquired higher-level skills.

If Taesan hadn't been corrupted by the gods, he might have become a transcendent being with three or more divine names.

He fought with all his might, struggled, and ran forward.

In the end, he achieved his goal."

Note: "Alone Mode" is likely a reference to a game or simulation mode where Taesan is operating solo, without the influence of others.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan had achieved peace.

But ironically, he who had achieved peace was in a state where he didn't know what to do. Having devoted his entire life to struggle, peace was extremely unfamiliar to him.

[The Narians might have been stimulated in their own way, but they were mortal beings after all. They meant nothing to you.]

"What's going on?"

Taesan asked again. Baal spoke with a subtle smile.

[Don't you think you can find your own vitality in a free daily life? Even if it's meaningless, it might be somewhat enjoyable.]

"What do you mean?"

[The god is calling you, Taesan.]

Baal's voice echoed.
