Chapter 584

584. Extra Story, Cleanup (2)

Lee Tae-yeon knew. The labyrinth was originally one. The reason why Alone Mode players couldn't meet was because of the interference of the gods.

Now, it was okay to give up on conquering the labyrinth, but among the Alone Mode players, there were those who were willing to risk their lives to go down.

If they could meet each other, they could gain great power.

Lee Tae-yeon wanted to help them.

"Ah, that's it. You don't have anything else to ask me, do you?"

The wizard nodded, as if he had expected it, and stroked his chin.

"Let's get to the point. We can handle it right away. But... I'm having a little trouble."

"What's the trouble?"

"It's the trouble of which one to consider real."

"Real?"

Lee Tae-yeon tilted his head. The wizard continued to mutter.

"If we don't care about them, we can just get rid of them, but that would be too cruel."

"What are you talking about?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's okay if you don't understand. It's a concern for the administrator. It's not your problem to worry about."

"No, that's not it."

Lee Tae-yeon refuted the wizard's words.

"We were supposed to go down together, but because of the distortion, we can't, right? As the administrator, you have to take care of it, don't you?"

"That's... true."

The wizard chuckled.

"As the administrator, I have to solve the labyrinth's problem directly. Let's wait for now. I'm thinking about the solution, and besides, we can take our time, can't we?"

"Well, that's true."

They had won.

Since they could freely roam the labyrinth and the earth, they could just go back into the labyrinth after the wizard handled it.

"It doesn't matter how it turns out, we can't do it right now."

"You guys have won."

The wizard spoke calmly.

"Time is on your side. Enjoy this world at your leisure."

"Enjoy it, then. That's a weird thing to say."

"It seems like you're enjoying it, though."

The wizard looked around and said so. Lee Tae-yeon had a gloomy expression.

"Well... that's true."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, as the administrator, I received the adventurer's proposal as well."

The wizard waved his hand in the air, and a hole began to open in space.

"Are you leaving?"

"I have things to take care of on my own. I can't be tied down forever."

The wizard smiled slyly and stepped into the opened space.

"Then, let's meet again later."

The wizard disappeared.

Lee Tae-yeon let out a sigh and slumped into her chair.

"I'm busy too."

She gazed blankly at the ceiling for a moment, muttering to herself as if recalling a memory.

"I didn't know I could have a conversation with the wizard like this."

In her past life, her relationship with the wizard was far from good. The wizard thought of her as a parasite living in the labyrinth, and she cursed him for being so stubborn.

"I've changed a lot."

But some things remained unchanged. Lee Tae-yeon looked around her surroundings.

This was the house given to her. In a desolate world, she was given a single, intact building as her own.

And she began to decorate her house to her liking.

The house was filled with numerous decorations.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's an extremely magnificent painting. You can feel the traces of time on the sculpture.

Each and every one of them was an artwork that couldn't be measured by value.

In her past life, she had also collected artworks. But that was only a tool to hide her true nature, the timid heart of a coward.

However, in the process of collecting those artworks, a genuine hobby was born.

This place now is very similar to the place where she last faced her demise in her past life.

Back then, she was filled with anxiety and worry, thinking she could die at any moment. But now, she feels extremely comfortable, like she's in her own home.

She was savoring the peaceful moment.

Suddenly!

The door burst open violently. The decorations that had been perfectly balanced were shaken roughly. Iteayeon scrunched up her face.

"Amelia."

"What's going on? Did the magic story end already?"

"It's over. ……But what's that?"

Iteayeon looked at Amelia with a disgusted face.

There was a grotesquely shaped creature clinging to Amelia's shoulder. It was quite large, covering her entire shoulder and still having some left over."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The mucus-like substance flowed stickily, staining her upper body. Amelia said calmly,

"This? A deep-sea creature. It was beautiful when I saw it at the bottom, but it changed like this when it came up."

"Gross. Throw it away."

"Why? It's cute, isn't it?"

"What's with that?"

Lee Tae-yeon looked at the twisted creature with a disgusted face. Due to the pressure difference, it had swelled up grotesquely, and it was impossible to call it cute even as a joke.

"I wonder if the Taesan who saw me in my past life had this kind of psychology."

Lee Tae-yeon let out a deep sigh and opened his mouth.

"So, how was it? The deep sea?"

"It was great."

Amelia smiled brightly.

"Swimming freely in the deep ocean, doing as I please, was more satisfying than I thought."

All the players on Earth had become transcendent beings. And for a deep-sea mode player like Amelia, who had reached the same depth, it was no exaggeration to say that she had become a monster.

She was traveling freely around the world, including the deepest parts of the ocean that human technology couldn't reach.

"The day will come when I'll touch the bottom of the Mariana Trench with my own hands. It's thrilling."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Amelia had a truly satisfied face. She was a person who explored places that others couldn't reach. Especially, she was very interested in the deep sea. In the past, when the Earth was still intact, she would often watch deep-sea documentaries.

Now that she could go to such places herself, she was overjoyed.

"When I went down, I saw creatures I'd never seen or heard of before. Ah, I wanted to bring back each and every one of them. And there was even a fish among them……."

She was bursting with excitement. Lee Tae-yeon listened to her story with a quiet smile, nodding his head.

"I never thought I'd have a relationship like this with her."

Amelia was the strongest player even before Lee Tae-yeon properly entered the labyrinth. She was extremely arrogant and refused to talk to others, using the community only to vent her ego.

By the time Lee Tae-yeon had made some progress in the labyrinth and their conversation became possible, Amelia had already disappeared.

She must have been taken away as a plaything of the God of Fall.

They thought they would never meet again, but now they were chatting together as friends.

"Human life is really unpredictable."

Recalling the old saying, Lee Tae-yeon opened his mouth.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What floor are we on now?"

"88th floor."

Amelia, who was enthusiastically praising the greatness of the deep sea, replied.

"It's getting a bit tough to go down slowly. We have plenty of time, so let's take it easy."

"That's okay."

They had won. They had a lot of time. Lee Tae-yeon, who had been gazing at her for a moment, swiftly pulled out his weapon.

"Then, it's been a while, let's do it once."

"Good."

Amelia laughed joyfully and summoned a deep-sea creature.

* * *

The players on Earth went back and forth between the Earth and the labyrinth, building up their strength and reclaiming the Earth. People were filled with hope.

But there was no problem-free situation.

"Hmm……."

"Yeah."

Kim Hwi-yeon and a few others stroked their chins. Their faces were filled with worried expressions.

"What do we do about this?"

In front of them was a ruined nuclear power plant.

Even in the devastated Earth, it had managed to maintain some form, but its function was broken and couldn't be used.

"We have to revive this somehow……."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Kim Hwi-yeon muttered to himself. The infrastructure itself was already built by gathering technicians. Now, the most important thing was to supply energy.

The problem was that the range they had to supply energy to was a country, which was a problem. They had to somehow prepare an energy source.

And the best option was a nuclear power plant.

Of course, they had become superhumans. With multiple hard-mode pedals attached, they could produce a certain amount of electricity just by stepping on them.

However, there was a limit to the energy that could be generated solely by human power, and it was restricted. They couldn't just keep pedaling all day. If they could use nuclear power, it would be better. So, they had come to a relatively intact nuclear power plant.

"Is there any progress?"

"No."

The blond man shook his head with a tired face.

"All the technicians are gathered and trying to fix it somehow, but there are too many parts that are out of reach."

"I see."

The nuclear power plant was a concentration of modern technology. Many technicians had worked on individual parts to create the whole thing.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As much as it required considerable technical capabilities, it was almost impossible for the current human survivors to restore it.

“Hmm.”

People were deep in thought. To live a more comfortable life, they absolutely needed an energy source.

Someone cautiously asked Kim Hwi-yeon,

“Perhaps Lord Taesan...”

“No.”

Kim Hwi-yeon shook his head.

“He said he won't help us from now on. He said we have to do it ourselves.”

“If you keep relying on me, you'll eventually become cripples.”

At Kim Hwi-yeon's firm but strong words, he couldn't help but nod his head.

“That's right.”

“We have to move forward with our own strength. It's meaningless to borrow Lord Taesan's power anymore.”

“That's right.”

Everyone nodded vigorously.

They couldn't rely on Lord Taesan anymore. They had to be self-sufficient.

But then, they would be back to square one.

As they were worrying, someone murmured as if they had just remembered something.

“By the way, are we okay? We're on top of a broken power plant, aren't we?”

Although it couldn't be seen, the radiation that exceeded the lethal dose was still pouring out continuously."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There were a few people who were momentarily terrified, but Kim Hwi-yeon brushed it off lightly.

"It doesn't matter. Taesan-nim said it's not related to us directly, so it's not a problem."

They were coldly unhuman.

Easy and Normal modes were originally the conqueror's. Taesan had stolen it, but the owner had changed, and the fundamental nature remained the same.

Their very existence was contaminated.

Radiation or the like couldn't tarnish their essence. People let out a sigh of relief.

"That's fortunate."

"But the problem still remains."

How were they going to repair the nuclear power plant?

How were they going to revive the technology?

It was a moment when people were worried.

"And come to think of it," Kim Hwi-yeon muttered.

"When I asked about the power plant, Taesan-nim said something like that."

"Is Taesan-nim saying something?"

People's postures changed. With serious expressions, reverent attitudes, they focused on Kim Hwi-yeon's words as if they were receiving a divine revelation.

"It's not something to worry about particularly. Rather, it's better to worry about something else, I think."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If it were something else……."

They were about to ask the meaning of the words.

The sky opened up.

Note: The last sentence "하늘이 열렸다" is a figurative expression in Korean, which means a sudden realization or a moment of enlightenment, rather than a literal opening of the sky.
