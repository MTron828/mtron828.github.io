Chapter 219

219. The World of Elrics and Humans (2)

When all the elrics disappeared and only humans were left, Tai Shan shook his hand.

"Hello?"

The people who were staring at him reflexively nodded their heads.

"Ah, yes, hello..."

"Where are you going?"

"To the Buranian Plain..."

"Can I come with you?"

"Yes, you can."

They answered subconsciously.

Tai Shan climbed onto the roof of their carriage. They finished tidying up and set off again.

Tai Shan closed his eyes quietly while sitting on the carriage.

A murmur of voices could be heard from inside the carriage. Although it was a soft voice, Tai Shan could hear every word.

"Who is that person?"

"I don't know..."

"So why did you agree?"

"Uh, I don't know. Don't ask. You also nodded your head, didn't you?"

"That's because I was shocked in the moment. What kind of person is that?"

"...I shattered the elric with my bare hands. It was a low-grade elric."

A sound of swallowing a gulp of saliva was heard.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Have you ever met someone like that?"

"No......"

"I just found out that I'm a being who can physically reverse summon a spirit."

They whispered to each other. The conversation gradually flowed to why Taesan was with them and who he was.

"Ask."

"I don't like it. Why would a spirit-user talk to someone who's not familiar with it?"

"Then let's go with someone who knows nothing?"

Their conversation eventually decided to have a conversation with Taesan. From there, the conversation progressed to who was forced to make a choice, and the person who was forced to make a choice was pale with fear and opened the window with a creak.

"Over there......"

A green-haired woman poked her head out the window and said in a dying voice:

"Isn't it uncomfortable? Would you like to come in?"

"No."

Taesan agreed. He was also waiting for them to call him.

He grasped the carriage wall and inserted his body through the window.

A faint gasping sound was heard. Taesan was examining them one by one.

A group of four people: two men and two women.
Here is the translation of the text:

As I looked at the carriage and the attire worn by the occupants, I didn't think they were commoners. They were wearing the same pendant.

"Are you a noble family?"

"Ah...".

A woman with green hair spoke hesitantly.

"I'm sorry. Our spirits were originally well-behaved children, but suddenly they stopped following our control."

"It doesn't matter."

The problem was with the mountain god, who was essentially an enemy of the spirits.

"You've also eliminated your spirits, so can't you summon them again?"

"No, that's not it. You can summon them again if you want to. It's just that you can only reverse summon them."

"I'm glad it's not that. If I had completely eliminated them, I would feel uncomfortable."

The woman with green hair swallowed her saliva at the mountain god's words. The question he asked was something that ordinary people who lived a normal life wouldn't know.

"Uh, do you not know much about spirits?"

"I don't know much. I've only been training and hiding away."

The mountain god's face contorted in a scowl. His expression was an act, but it was true that he was stuck in a predicament, so it wasn't entirely false. Therefore, his expression was quite convincing.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san didn't think they were hostile towards themselves, and their expressions slightly brightened as they judged that they weren't abnormal either.

"'Don't you know about the spirits?'"

"'I've trained somewhere deep in the mountains. I don't even know the exact location. I just escaped in a daze.'"

The woman gasped in amazement.

"I've heard stories about people like that in old tales, but I never thought I'd actually see one……."

She seemed to have regained her speech, and the woman started talking nonstop.

"I'm Akien, the one with the red hair is Perina, the one with the weird hair is Bana, and the one with the good looks is Karunie."

"Are you all from the same family?"

"Yes, we're proud children of the Acacia family."

Tae-san looked them over. Despite having different hair colors, they were all from the same family.

Tae-san seemed to have noticed his uncertainty, and the ghost spoke up.

"This is a world where spirits and humans coexist. The color of one's hair changes depending on the attribute one is born with. If it's fire, it becomes red, and if it's a forest, it becomes green."

Tae-san let out a small gasp. The woman with the red hair, Perina, looked annoyed.

"Well, I suppose I'm just a pawn in the game, anyway."
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's not like we're trying to sell something, right? We just think it's a good opportunity."

"But it's the same as being dragged to go somewhere you don't want to go, isn't it? I just want to stay in bed and rest. The carriage is uncomfortable. And I haven't even washed properly."

"Why are you going somewhere?"

"To the Barren Plains. A strange phenomenon has appeared there."

Tae-san quietly lit up his eyes.

"What's strange?"

"Yes."

Aki-en nodded his head.

"A transparent sphere appeared in the middle of the Plains about a month ago. Since it covered half of the Plains, people were sent to investigate. As a result, they found out that there was a girl inside."

"There's a girl inside the sphere?"

"I don't believe it, but my friends all said it was true."

Aki-en continued talking with an excited face.

"We thought it was just an unusual phenomenon and people came to investigate, but something amazing happened. The natural energy around the sphere became stronger, and the spiritual energy rose. Some even said that the spiritual energy evolved into a higher spiritual energy!"

"That's an amazing thing?"

"Certainly!"

Aki-en went on a tangent.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Until now, the evolution of the spirit was something that only happened in a fantasy world! It's just that it happened right next to me! If I do it well, I can open up a new horizon for spirit magic!"

Aki-en's words made Tai-shan realize. The girl inside the sphere that they were talking about was actually the newly born Spirit King.

And they also said that the inhabitants of this world didn't know this fact.

"I'm honestly opposed."

Ba-an, who had been quiet, opened his mouth.

"That's something we shouldn't touch. It's a higher existence. If we experiment with it and touch it, the angry Spirit God will send down a calamity."

"Another, another one of those voices."

"Let's take a look at it in reality. Since the sphere was born, dark spirits have been born. This is all because humans touched the sphere."

"That's... "

Aki-en's mouth was sealed, as if she had lost her words. Soon, she changed her tone.

"There's no other way, is there? Honestly, I don't like it. Natural things should follow their own will. That's our family's motto, isn't it? But since the Ba-juke family asked us directly, we can't refuse."

"Damn."

Ba-an bowed his head deeply.

"Ba-juke family?"
(Note: Ba-juke and Tai-shan are likely proper nouns in the original text, and their meanings are not clear without context.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"The only clan that has contracted with a high-ranking spirit is our family. Not even a king can open his mouth in front of the Baruk clan."

Aki-en muttered to himself.

"This family is only as strong as its own might, and weak clans like ours are dragged around. We didn't plan to participate this time either, but the Baruk clan is going to conduct a large-scale experiment, so we'll have to avoid trouble. We're being dragged along."

Tae-san understood the overall flow of events through a series of stories.

After the Spirit King's demise, a new Spirit King appeared. However, the new Spirit King's self-awareness was incomplete and fragile, and it was being nurtured in a vessel to build up its strength.

Then, the High God took advantage of that moment. Corrupted spirits were born, influencing the world.

Humans who didn't know about the new Spirit King gathered around it, each with their own desires.

"'The enemy is not just High God,' it seems because of this."

The carriage moved slowly towards its destination.

* * *

He understood where he had to go. However, Tae-san did not rush to his destination immediately.

After hearing the story, he didn't seem to think the Spirit King was in danger. He didn't seem to need to move quickly, so he thought it would be interesting to learn about something he had been interested in for a while.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's the contract with the spirit about?"

As I walked along the windy path, there was a small spark, and Tai Shan had a spirit skill. However, all of these skills were obtained forcefully through leveling up. I didn't get to contract with the spirit directly to gain power.

But it was still a new power, and there was value in learning it.

"Is it a contract with the spirit?"

Aki-en's face, which had been smiling, suddenly looked surprised.

"Are you saying you didn't make a contract?"

"I don't know. I just trained in secret."

"So, you didn't even use the spirit to strengthen your body, but instead summoned it without clothes?"

Aki-en said with a gasping expression.

"What's going on with that?"

"Strengthening the spirit?"

"Ah, I see. Then I need to explain from here."

Aki-en began to explain slowly.

"If you contract with a spirit, you can use its power itself. Although it's weak, it's possible to strengthen your body."

A blue aura appeared on Aki-en's body. As she quickly threw a punch, a gust of wind blew.
Here is the translation of the text:

"There are many other helpful things. Those who have made a contract with the wind spirit can live without being bothered by heat or cold at any time, and those who have made a contract with the water spirit can live without worrying about dehydration even in the desert."

"It's small."

"Really? But it's still very convenient. If you reach the level of a high-ranking spirit, you can create a whirlwind with just a wave of your hand, but I'm not sure if it's really true."

Of course, the stronger the spirit, the more power you can draw from it, and it's a huge difference.

"And the most important thing is that you can summon the spirit itself and work together."

"Like you did?"

"Yes. Spirits are stronger than ordinary humans, and there are exceptions, but in general, they are."

She glanced at the Tai Shan and continued.

"When a summoned spirit is linked to the user, they can support each other and draw out even more power. The stronger the user, the stronger the spirit, and the stronger the spirit, the stronger the user."

"That's fine."

"That's why humans who have made a contract with a high-ranking spirit can take on a mid-ranking spirit on their own, and Tai Shan also knows that."

Akien spoke carefully.

"Do you want to learn about contracts?"

Tai Shan nodded, and Akien applauded with a satisfied smile.
Here is the translation of the text:

"So I'll teach you."

"Is that okay?"

"We helped you, so it's not that difficult. It's not a big deal."

She spoke sharply.

I guessed what she wanted. She probably wanted to make a good relationship with the mountain spirit, which could subdue the spirit with its bare body.

Akiel's wish will not come true. The mountain spirit didn't say anything.

She rummaged through her clothes and took out a small, transparent gem.

"Before making a contract with the spirit, you need to know what kind of properties you possess. Take a look at this gem."

The mountain spirit received the gem. The spirit's aura was being sucked into the gem.

"The color of the gem changes depending on how deep the color is. Depending on the color, you can make a contract with either of the two spirits. Just wait a little, and the change will occur."

She looked at the gem with a fascinated expression. So much time passed.

"It's not changing."

The gem was still transparent.

Akiel's eyes trembled.

"Huh? Wait a minute. Is it defective?"

(Note: Akiel is a female character in the story, and her name is not translated as it is a proper noun.)
Here is the translation:

She took out another jewel from her bosom. However, the jewel still showed no change in color.

"Ba-an, do you have a transparent jewel? Can I borrow it for a look?"

She borrowed the jewel from someone else and handed it to Tai Shan.

But there was no jewel that changed color.

After examining over ten jewels, she scratched her cheek.

"This is the first time I've seen this..."

"How did this happen?"

"Don't be surprised, just listen."

She looked at Tai Shan's expression and said:

"The color of the jewel changes according to the properties of the person who possesses it. If it's fire, it turns red, if it's water, it turns blue. That's definitely the case. Even if it's darkness, it turns dark. But the fact that it didn't change at all... "

Aki-en carefully opened her mouth.

"There's no property at all. It means you can't make a contract with a spirit."
