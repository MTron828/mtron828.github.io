Chapter 234

234. The Fourth Return to Earth (1)

Tae-san was touching the mysterious armor.

A dark aura was flowing through the entire armor, rippling.

Tae-san received a ring and handed over two materials to Harfran: a gemstone from the Giant's World and the will of destruction obtained by defeating the 51st floor's fire elemental.

The two materials combined to form one armor.

[The armor with the will of destruction] [The gemstone from the Giant's World, Barhulbia, combined with the will of destruction. The armor itself emitted a faint aura of destruction.] [Attack power + 300]

This equipment was focused solely on increasing pure attack power, excluding all other factors. Due to the materials used, the increase in attack power was quite significant.

Harfran's face looked older than before, as if he had struggled.

After saying he had worked hard, he would take a break for a while, and then replied, "Come back when you're ready."

Tae-san nodded in understanding.

It was almost time to return to Earth. Community posts were disappearing one by one.
Here is the translation of the text:

Everyone was waiting anxiously for their return, including Taesan. However, he had a greater expectation than anxiety. Uh-uh.

The space opened up.

It was time to return to the earth.

The scenery of the earth that appeared beyond the horizon started to engulf Taesan.

And what appeared was a ruined world.

Crumbled buildings and a huge hole in the sky.

I returned here again.

*

"Finally, we're back again, aren't we...?"

"Even so, this time is different from before. We've grown stronger, and most importantly... Taesan is here with us."

People gathered their determination. Kim Huiyeon quickly appeared in the center and clapped her hands.

"Alright, everyone, let's come this way! We'll make a rough assessment!"

They needed to make a rough assessment of how much stronger people had become since the previous return, and how many had gone down into the labyrinth and met their deaths. Kim Huiyeon's words gathered people together. Taesan also approached her and patted her shoulder.

"Ah, Taesan."

Her face, which had been looking at Taesan with a warm expression, suddenly stiffened.

"...I'm sorry, but what's with the golem next to you?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hmm, it's decent, but... it's weak. Strange. Can you really not even deal with a labyrinth like this with this kind of power?"

"What's that?..."

"My spirit."

Tai Shan simply answered. Kim Hui-yeon's eyes shook even more.

"Is it a spirit?"

"Just for a moment, I'll leave my seat, so I'll leave it like this for now."

"Ah, yes."

Kim Hui-yeon nodded silently. Tai Shan turned around and headed towards the outskirts of the city.

"Ooh, ooh?"

"Ah, monster!"

The people who saw the Barukaza let out a scream and pointed at the enemy. But then they realized it was Tai Shan standing next to them and stared at him with a shocked face.

[Many things.]

Barukaza looked around at the people and muttered to himself.

"But it's weak. There are some usable things, but they don't quite fit. Strange. If I've seen a labyrinth like this before, I don't think I could survive with this kind of power."

"They're different from me, anyway."

Tai Shan arrived at the outskirts.

The hole in the sky above quietly greeted him.

"What's strange? Can you really explain it properly?"

Note: I've translated the text to the best of my ability, but please note that the translation may not be perfect due to the nuances of the original text.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san told Bargcza general information about his world. He said that his world was swallowed by Go-shin and that people entered a labyrinth during this process.

However, he did not explain the detailed process. He judged that it was better to talk about it after seeing it directly.

[You are the Wind King. You summoned Minerva.]

The wind blows. The implemented wind takes shape and creates a woman's form. Bargcza bowed his body.

[Your Majesty.]

"Ah, ah?"

Minerva looked around and was startled.

"This doesn't seem like a labyrinth?"

"That's right."

Tae-san began to explain slowly.

They were living beings in one world. At that time, a monster attacked their world. And they were given a choice.

Minerva and Bargcza made a contract with him. According to the terms of the contract, they would be together forever as long as Tae-san does not die.

So, it doesn't matter what he says. Tae-san explained the overall flow under this judgment.

After hearing the story, Minerva scowled.

"It's all because of those cursed Go-shin. Ultimately."

"Is that so?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Gomgomi thought it was truly the root of all evil. It attacked Auluria, aimed at the world of giants, and destroyed the earth.

Minerva gazed up at the sky.

"...Dark and strong."

A hole in the black sky. Monsters appeared from there.

"And it's directly connected to this world. It's hard to close it. But it's weak considering it's directly connected. Is it because of the intervention of the transcendents?"

[The master has a question.]

"What is it?"

[The master said that the labyrinth was separated.]

"That's it."

Easy, Normal, Hard, and Solo modes.

Barukaza asked.

[Is it because of the gods' intervention?]

Tae-san nodded his head.

In the cases of Easy, Normal, and Hard, it was not a labyrinth created by a magician. It was created as a result of the labyrinth being copied by the gods' intervention.

Barukaza laughed.

[That's quite interesting.]

"I understand the situation roughly. So, what should we do here?"

"We should wait first."

Tae-san looked at the crowd gathered by Kim Hui-yeon. He was checking the people who had gathered.

Not long after returning to the earth, the quest appeared.

And Tae-san knew what this quest was.
Here is the translation of the text:

Kim Hui-yeon looked at the people in front of her and furrowed her brow. The story was that over 100,000 people had died, and the number was not small at all.

"Still, it's good that the survivors have become stronger."

Among the hardcore players, there were a few people who had become twice as strong as they were during the previous return. She, Jin Jung-geun, and Seo Jang-san were among them.

"But what about Senior Tai-san? Where did he go?"

"I called out to him?"

"Ah!"

Kim Hui-yeon let out a scream and backed away. She rubbed her startled chest.

"When did you come?"

"Just now."

"Brother, hello..."

Gold Middle-geun was about to greet Tai-san when he looked at him with a nervous expression.

"Not bad, but too weak. Is this the limit of a separated labyrinth?"

"There are many people. No, I think all the people around here have gathered, so it's not that few."

A woman with a beautiful blue hair, similar to a golem, looked at them and muttered to herself.

Gold Middle-geun asked cautiously.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hey, brother. The two people on either side are..."

"I am the King of the Wind, Minerva. Please take care."

Minerva smiled mischievously.

Kim Jung-geun nodded his head with a stunned expression.

"Eh, yes..."

"Is it confirmed?"

Tae-san's question snapped Kim Hwi-ryeon back to reality.

"Yes. While exploring the labyrinth, many people have died, but everyone has become stronger than before."

"That's good."

Tae-san gathered his strength. A dark aura spread to the people around him.

The people who were looking at Tae-san with a shocked expression burst into amazement.

"Wow..."

"I think I've gotten about half of it."

"It seems that this was the case."

Kim Jung-geun opened his skill window. A dark magic that he had not obtained before appeared in the window.

Tae-san could give the dark magic to the people of the earth as a reward from the gods. He had been unable to obtain the things he lacked due to his lack of strength.

As people burst into amazement, Tae-san opened his mouth.

"And Taeyeon and Kang Jun-hyeok?"

"They went down to have a brief battle and will be back soon. Anyway, I... brother..."

Note: The conversation seems to be taking place in a fantasy world, with characters having magical abilities and exploring a labyrinth. The dialogue is informal and casual, with a tone of excitement and accomplishment.
Here is the translation of the text:

Jin Zhongjun continued to glance at Minerva and Barkazar. The facial expression of Minerva, who had a lot of questions, made Taishan open his mouth.

"Don't worry, we're on the same side."

"I trust my brother, but I think others are a bit uneasy about it."

Minerva appeared as a beautiful woman, but Barkazar looked like a golem. People's anxious gazes were directed at him, similar to the monsters or beasts in the labyrinth. Taishan replied:

"Even if you're worried, you'll soon find out."

The confirmation was over, and the quest appeared.

[The next quest will start two days later.]

A two-day period of leisure was given to the people, and they thought they would rest and wait for the next quest.

However, Taishan knew that there would be no true rest from the fourth return on.

Kururur!

A loud roar echoed from outside the viewing area. The people on watch duty let out cries and ran out.

"Monster! Monster! Hundreds of them!"

"What?"

Kim Huiyan jumped up in alarm.

After checking outside, she frowned at her face.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is a complete wave, isn't it!"

Although monsters approached during the preparation period in the previous return, the number was too small to be threatening.

I thought it would be the same this time and let my guard down, but suddenly 100 monsters appeared.

"...and..."

The monsters' strength, which I could feel from afar, was unbearable.

Occasionally, I saw a monster that I couldn't be sure of winning.

Kim Huiyan exclaimed hastily.

"Everyone, gather!"

"That's unnecessary."

Tae-san stepped forward.

"Baraka, and Minerva."

[Good. We crush the monsters of the gods. There's no more joyful thing.]

"I'm the same. If I can hinder the plans of those detestable things, I'll welcome it anytime."

Both of them rejoiced and stepped forward. The people who had gathered were staring at them in a daze.

The strength of the monsters was mostly D-grade. For the current hard mode players, the monsters that could be defeated with their lives were those that could be defeated with difficulty.

Baraka clapped her hands towards the approaching monsters. A massive wall is implemented around the city, centered around the screen.

Ka-a-a-a!
Here is the translation of the text:

Monsters are pounding on the barrier.

And the barrier is not shaking.

Like a fortress that has withstood attacks for hundreds of years, it has firmly repelled all attacks.

"What?"

"Huh, huh, huh."

People are sighing and the Baruka is slapping his hand again.

Light is born.

The actual light advances, piercing through the monsters' bodies and erasing their numbers.

[It's nothing.]

Right now, Baruka has more than 50 floors of power. It's impossible for monsters like that to be opponents.

Minerva waves her hand.

A gentle breeze arises.

And soon the breeze turns into a storm.

Kaga, kaga, kaga!

"Woah, woah, woah!"

People scream and bend their bodies as they are hit by the storm. The hurricane advances towards the monsters.

Kaga, kaga, kaga!

And when the hurricane has passed, there was not a single monster left.

"What about the spent power?"

"Almost none. If I use this much, I can stay here for a few years, right?"

"That's good."

It turned out to be much better than Taesan's prediction. If it's like this, it's a really big power on Earth.

"...Huh?"
Here is the translation:

Kim Hwi-yeon gazed blankly.

Those monsters that had to be defeated with their lives, were all taken care of with just two attacks.

The power shown by Taesan during their previous return was undoubtedly monstrous. It was as if they were destroying the land just by punching and jumping.

However, it was still understandable. Because they were similar to us. As their stats rose, they were transcending human limits.

But this...

"Oh, oh, oh..."

People bow their knees in awe. They look at Taesan with shining eyes.

[The proficiency of divine power has increased by 1%.]
