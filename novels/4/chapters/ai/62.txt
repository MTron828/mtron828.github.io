63. First Return. Second Wave (4)

There were no signs of monsters outside. Since they were all attacking the city, the exterior was ironically a clean zone.

And the monsters hadn't only attacked Anyang.

There were numerous cities in Korea, and all of them were under attack.

Taesan headed towards a nearby city.

With his extremely high stats, he could arrive in no time.

That city, like Anyang, was also under attack. Ghost was slightly surprised at the desperate fight.

["Huh. Are other cities like this too? How many are there?"]

"Since it's worldwide, there must be hundreds of thousands of zones."

[Hundreds of thousands?]

Ghost was shocked. Taesan aimed his bow at a monster swinging its massive arms.

Thwack!

He pierced through the monster's head with a cracking sound, but nothing happened.

The monster continued to attack people without taking any damage.

"As expected, it's no good."
Here is the translation of the text:

"People in other cities are made unable to interfere. I thought there might be gaps since it's my first return, but they were meticulous here.

Taesan moved to accomplish his original goals.

He moved back towards the vicinity of Anyang, recalling the areas he had discovered in the previous world.

And he found monsters.

Grrrr.

F-grade monsters of various shapes were clustered together as if guarding something.

They were guarding a cracked purple rift.

Monsters were popping out from a huge rift in the sky, but not all monsters came from there. Like expanding their influence, small rifts occasionally opened on the ground, and monsters leaped out from there too.

[Special Quest Started] [Destroy the veins of the Black Swamp] [Different rewards will be given in the labyrinth depending on your achievements.]

If you destroy that, fewer monsters will appear. It was a kind of area elimination.

Grrrr.

Monsters moved to target Taesan.

Taesan wielded his sword.

He knocked them down one by one. Although dozens gathered, they were all F-grade monsters. He could handle them all in a matter of minutes.

As the last monster fell, a beast's hand appeared from the rift.

Grrrr."
Here is the translation of the text:

"[Monster 267511 appeared.]"

A six-digit D-grade monster. It took the form of a black wolf-like figure.

The rift on the ground itself had been discovered since the second return, but it was barely removed during the third return due to this monster.

Taesan moved his sword.

*Kagak.*

Claws of the monster scratch. It's quite strong for a D-grade. To face it alone, you have to clear Normal Mode. Currently, Taesan's stats aren't at that level yet.

But he has skills and experience.

"[78 damage to Monster 267511.] [35 damage to Monster 267511.]"

Critical hit. Strong attack. Continuous attacks. He uses all of them to strike in one blow. The monster retaliates, but the attack results disappear.

"Your first attack's absolute nullification has been activated."

He attacks again beneath the erased attack. The sword leaves a trace as it cuts through the monster.

The monster attacks again.

"Your second attack's absolute nullification has been activated."

The attack is nullified.

Taesan continues to attack.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The monster sinks its teeth in. Taesan evades by letting it pass and activates Frost Arrow while keeping his distance. The monster's black fur freezes.

The monster is undoubtedly strong.

But Taesan has faced many such monsters too many times.

"Considering its health, this is nothing."

Muttering to himself, he thrusts his sword into the monster's mouth. He then triggers Ignition, and an explosion erupts inside the monster's mouth.

[58 damage to Monster 267511.]

Endurance and attack nullification. Utilizing his swordsmanship and everything else, he defeats the enemy. After approximately an hour of fighting, victory is secured.

"Phew."

Taesan catches his breath and stands before the rift.

"Always feels unpleasant whenever I see it."

A discontinuity in the space shimmering with violet.

It was extremely unpleasant. Just being near it evoked an instinctive aversion.

"Definitely different from the gods of the Labyrinth."

Their power may have felt imposing and massive, but it didn't evoke such discomfort.

"This is...?"

The ghost expressed astonishment. Taesan thrusts his sword into the rift.

*Screeeech!*

With an unpleasant sound, the rift disappears.
Here is the translation of the text:

"With this, the immediate task was finished. As far as Taesan could recall, there were no more rifts nearby.

[Special Quest Success] [Differentiated rewards upon returning to the Labyrinth.]

The success window announcing the destruction of the rift.

And then another one appeared.

[Special Quest Success] [Differentiated rewards upon returning to the Labyrinth.]

It appeared overlapped twice. It meant one thing.

"We won, it seems."

It meant that others had cleared the second wave.

* * *

Grrrrr......

Together with Danmalma, the monster collapses. Kim Hwiyeon lands the finishing blow, then collapses herself.

"Ugh."

She slumps down as if collapsing. Sweat pours down her whole body like a flood.

They won. They had defeated that dreadful monster, but she couldn't feel happy about it.

Around them lay a mountain of corpses. She grimaced.

Initially, people desperately fled. Some tried to shake the unyielding barrier and flee towards the city beyond the monster.

But they were all blocked by the monster and died."
Here is the translation of the text:

"By the time hundreds of people were dying like that, people realized there was no other way but to defeat the monster.

If they had attacked without disregarding their lives, not so many would have died. The monster in the second wave was undoubtedly strong, but it also had the disadvantage of not being able to attack multiple people at once.

Yet they hoped someone would step forward.

Instead of stepping forward, they made the worst choice of hiding behind and waiting for death.

A few brave souls stepped up, but they couldn't do much alone.

She did her best, but the monster that appeared wasn't one she could defeat alone. The limit was clear.

In the end, with countless people dead, they could achieve victory.

[Special Quest Success] [Differentiated rewards upon returning to the Labyrinth.]

The quest success window appeared. The colorless barrier that had prevented their approach slowly disappeared.

She snapped back to her senses.

"We need to help."

Taesan was alone."
Here is the English translation of the text:

"He's strong, that much I know, but I didn't think we could win against a monster like this. The barrier disappeared because everyone achieved victory, but she didn't know that and stumbled towards Taesan, clutching her trembling legs.

The pupils of Hwiyeon widened upon arrival.

"You came?"

Countless monster corpses.

Above them, Taesan stood unscathed.

Breathless, she collapsed and let out a hollow laugh.

"We fought risking our lives..."

"We should have fought risking our lives in the Labyrinth too."

Before Taesan finished speaking, a formidable spear appeared.

[Congratulations. You have survived. Rewards will be distributed based on your actions and results.] [Returning to the Labyrinth in 48 hours.]

Hwiyeon murmured blankly,

"It's over."

"For now, yes."

* * *

People died. There needed to be an account.

Originally, those who would have noisily debated in the National Assembly or held a seat in the district would have raised their voices, but they all died to the monsters.

Naturally, attention shifted to those in Hard Mode and Alone Mode, with Kim Hwiyeon garnering the most support among them.
Here is the English translation of the text:

She had previously proposed a rational approach to them, and since they all saw her fight for her life, they followed her words without question.

As she fought risking her life, it was a way to give more trust to those who risked their lives with her.

Hwiyeon was bewildered by the blind support.

In her view, Taesan should have been commanding the people.

But Taesan refused.

"I'm not capable of being that person."

He was not someone who could command others. He had learned that the hard way in his previous life.

"And would they like you more than me?"

Someone so alienated is inevitably excluded from groups. Hwiyeon herself seemed to understand this to some extent, and she smiled bitterly.

Under her command, the situation was quickly brought under control.

"Out of one hundred thousand... only thirty thousand survived."

Hwiyeon bit her lips in anguish. Seventy percent had died. If twenty percent died in a war, it was considered a complete disaster, making this the worst survival rate.

"You did your best."

Taesan said. They had returned with no information initially, not even knowing what the wave was. Furthermore, the mindset of the people was also immature.
Here is the English translation of the text:

Considering that only twenty thousand survived in the previous world, it was a decent survival rate.

"You can't save everyone."

Taesan spoke coldly but realistically.

"It's better to get used to death."

"..."

Hwiyeon bit her lip.

People also seemed surprisingly calm. Too many had died. Those who lost friends buried them with their own hands.

Slowly, they realized. They had come to a world where there was no civilization or order, where those who could comfort them in their deaths might die tomorrow.

The excitement they had felt about returning to Earth had vanished without a trace.

So, even when Hwiyeon spoke of the dead, there was hardly any uproar.

Taesan approached Junggeun.

"Are you okay?"

"Yeah, well. I'm managing."

He was someone who could calmly assess what he could and couldn't do. Perhaps because this time, unlike before, it was a situation they couldn't prevent from the start, he seemed less shocked mentally.

Itaeyeon and Kang Junhyuk were not much different either.
Here is the English translation of the text:

They had grown numb to death, living in the Alone Mode where everyone was dying. Though shocked upon hearing news of several deaths in Alone Mode, they quickly recovered.

[…….]

The Ghost had been silent since looking into the rift, seemingly preoccupied. Taesan did not press the issue, knowing it was something that could be discussed once they entered the Labyrinth.

As time passed and it was time to return to the Labyrinth, Kim Hwiyeon gathered everyone and spoke.

"Many people have died."

Out of fifty thousand citizens of Anyang, only thirty thousand survived. Hwiyeon spoke with a distorted expression at the despairing figure.

"This return won't be the end, right?"

Surely there will be a second, even a third.

"We must survive. For those who have died, for the sake of discovering the truth of everything."

She spoke earnestly. Everyone listened with serious expressions.

"Let's come back stronger than ever."

Taesan listened from afar to her speech.

The first return had been a turning point, where those who had previously descended into the Labyrinth leisurely now approached it with a more serious attitude.

When they meet again next time, they will be even stronger.

"See you next time."

"Yes, Hyung."

"See you next time."
Here is the English translation of the text:

It was time to bid farewell to Lee Taeyeon and Kang Junhyuk. Just like when they returned, the space splits and swallows them up.

Taesan closed and opened his eyes.

The air was humid. Moss-covered bricks.

They had returned here in less than a week.

* * *

He quickly began organizing.

In front of him now was the boss room of the 10th floor. Beyond that, capturing the second boss would make the Ghost disappear.

And beyond the 10th floor, proper equipment would appear in the shop.

As for magic, if he learned only the invisibility spell, he had already learned all the magic that Rilis possessed.

"Alright."

He finished assessing. Taesan reopened the system window he had closed.

There had been mention that each return to the Labyrinth from Earth would result in differentiated rewards. Having returned, it was time to receive compensation.

[Monster Nest Bonus +443] [First Wave Bonus +124] [Second Wave Bonus +435] [Special Quest Bonus +845] [Suppression Bonus +54] [Victory Bonus +75]

.

.

.

[Final Settlement] [482p will be awarded.]
482p. In his previous world, during his first return, he had received at most 20p. At that time, the highest recipient was Kim Hwiyeon, who didn't even surpass 100p, which was an astonishing figure to consider.

Moreover, points had an incredibly wide range of applications.

[The provided p can be used for anything. It can be converted into gold and used to increase stats. It can also increase skill proficiency.]

Perhaps because they were obtained outside the Labyrinth, even things that could only be obtained with tremendous value within the Labyrinth were attainable.

Originally, because he received a very small amount of p, he should have been careful when using it, but the p he received reached 500.

Taesan joyfully confirmed the skills he held.
