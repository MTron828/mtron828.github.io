**Episode 307**

307. The Fifth Return, Earth (3)

"Phew."

People held their breath as they crossed the devastated national border.

Someone murmured to break the tense atmosphere.

"I never thought I'd be stepping on North Korean soil like this."

"I didn't think I'd be coming back either……."

"Huh? Have you been to North Korea before?"

"I'm a defector."

"Ah."

The person who spoke first awkwardly shut their mouth.

They slowly moved forward. Geumjunggeun opened his mouth.

"It's quiet, isn't it? The air feels different too."

It was cool and heavy. The sensation itself was cold and sharp.

Kugugugung!

And soon, a loud roar echoed.

The ground collapsed, and the monsters buried in the earth appeared.

[Monster 113454 has appeared.] [Monster 100045 has appeared.] [Monster 100148 has appeared.]

Six mid-level monsters.

Several C-grade monsters emerged. Taesan took a step back.

"Minerva. Barcaza. Fall back."

[Understood.]

"Yes."

The two of them retreated backward according to Taesan's command. Taesan spoke to the bewildered people.

"I don't intend to intervene. You guys match your strength against the monsters."

"Ah, yes!"

Kim Hwi-yeon nodded his head vigorously and shouted.

"Everyone, move to your designated positions!"

The Japanese and Korean players overlapped and moved together. They stomped their feet and wielded their weapons towards the charging monsters.

Ka-ga-gak!

At this point, if it were a C-grade monster, the hard-mode players could easily defeat it without any problem. It was more important for the Korean and Japanese players to gauge each other's strength and movement while fighting the monster, rather than relying on Taesan's intervention.

At first, their coordination was awkward, but as the battle continued, their movements became more refined.

As they matched their strength, the Japanese players couldn't help but be amazed.

"The average strength is... far higher than ours..."

The Korean hard-mode players had already reached the latter half of the 40th floor. On the other hand, the Japanese players had just arrived at the beginning of the 40th floor. The difference in their strength was significant.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"While marveling at the Korean player's movements, they couldn't help but hide their doubts.

"How can they be so strong, yet only a few of them survived?"

"Ah..."

Kim Hwi-yeon turned his gaze away with an ambiguous expression in response to a player's question. At the end of his gaze was Taesan.

Taesan shook his head, and Kim Hwi-yeon changed the subject.

"Well, there was a bit of a disturbance."

"Ah, I see."

The Japanese player nodded as if they understood. No matter how strong a player was, it meant nothing if they were up against another player. Japan had also suffered many casualties due to conflicts between players, so they didn't find Kim Hwi-yeon's words strange.

"Is that so?"

"Yes."

Taesan responded to Kim Hwi-yeon's quiet question.

They couldn't tell everyone about the backstory of the earth's destruction and the labyrinth. Even if they did, it would be a story for much later.

They could defeat the emerging monsters without any problems. They advanced without any sacrifices.

However, their speed was significantly slower than before.

It was because there were too many emerging monsters.

"What's going on with all these?"

Kwajik."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lee Tae-yeon, who had solo-killed a C-grade monster, was catching his breath. If he walked for a few minutes, a monster would appear, and after defeating it, another monster would appear after walking for a few minutes. It was as if there was no end to it.

It was as if all humans had been wiped out by the monsters, leaving the situation unresolved.

"Is there anyone alive here?"

"I don't see anyone when I check the community... but there's no sign of life whatsoever. Are they hiding?"

Taesan gazed out at the horizon.

[You have activated reconnaissance.] [You have activated the Leraize region detection.]

The reconnaissance and region detection linked together, bringing up information about the surrounding area.

And Taesan detected the presence of players gathered in the distance.

"Minerva, bring them here."

"It's amazing. How do you use your orders?"

Minerva waved her hand, and the wind exploded, carrying her to the other side of the horizon.

"Waaaah!"

And dozens of people flew towards them.

The people who were watching in a daze were shocked by the sudden appearance of these people.

"What's going on?"

"Who are you?"

"Uh, uh, uh..."

About thirty people suddenly flew towards Minerva's outstretched hand.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They were sloppy. Although Korean and Japanese players didn't manage well, they at least tidied up their hair and washed their faces to maintain some level of cleanliness.

But the people who appeared had disheveled faces and uncut hair, covering their entire faces.

Kim Hwi-yeon asked cautiously.

"Are you... North Korean players?"

"...Ugh!"

Late to understand the situation, they were shocked to see the uncountable number of people and drew their weapons.

"Get up! Enemies!"

"We're not enemies!" Kim Hwi-yeon shouted hastily. But the North Korean players, as they seemed to be, did not lower their guard. Instead, they became even more hostile.

"Get lost! Don't come near! If you do, I'll kill you!"

They shouted fiercely.

It was as if they feared human contact itself.

With their strong refusal, Kim Hwi-yeon couldn't approach them easily. Then, Taesan moved.

"Let's calm down and talk first."

[Taesan's non-lethal attack.]

"Ugh!"

Thirty players fell without resistance.

Taesan dusted off his hands.

"When they wake up, I'll talk to them one by one and calm them down. If they still don't understand, I'll call you."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's what I'm going to knock out again," Kim Hwi-yeon muttered.

"You're quite bold......"

"This is the fastest way."

In their past lives on Earth, people who cleared the labyrinth and imagined a happy future returned to Earth.

They all denied reality and went crazy. At first, they tried to persuade them with words and make them feel better, but they wouldn't listen.

It was fastest to knock them out, cool their overheated heads, and then make them accept it. It may seem violent, but it was an action born from numerous experiences.

The people took the North Korean players who had been knocked out and moved forward again.

Before long, they woke up, and when they were slowly explained the situation, some of them were enraged, while others accepted it.

Those who were enraged were knocked out again several times, and soon they listened.

And the stories that flowed out of them were enough to shock people.

The North Korean players initially worked together to win. The situation was too extreme, and it was too much to think about small problems.

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But as the situation was somewhat settled and leisure time was born, they eventually reached one conclusion.

Who would be the leader?

Who would lead the people?

They faced head-on the contradictions inherent in North Korea's hereditary system.

People were divided. Extremely. They killed each other, trying to create the picture they wanted.

The person with the greatest power tried to suppress it with force. But unlike before, the oppressed people also gained power.

No, rather, the oppressed people were now at an advantage.

The oppressed were the majority, and being the majority also meant that there were many talented individuals among them.

Those who were trampled underfoot by oppression and discipline rose up.

As if they would burn everything.

They didn't stop. They judged each other as enemies and tried to kill each other like monsters.

And so, the oppressed became the masters of North Korea.

They killed all those who had oppressed them.

But the chaos didn't end there.

The masters who had been oppressed began to oppress people, just as they had been oppressed themselves.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Power was something that drove people mad. Those who had grasped power in the midst of chaos and battle now wanted to wield it themselves.

They started killing each other again.

Even after they returned to the labyrinth, it was the same.

Their battles continued in the labyrinth.

More people died at the hands of other players than at the hands of monsters and labyrinth traps.

By the time the situation had calmed down, they had already split into dozens of groups, no longer recognizing each other as allies.

Those who had split apart returned to Earth and immediately started killing and opposing each other, heading north first.

Only thirty hard-mode players who didn't belong to any group were left.

People couldn't help but be amazed by their story.

I thought it was possible. Human greed has no end, after all. But when I heard the story from those who experienced it firsthand, my heart grew cold.

China was a country that shared many similarities with North Korea.

Then, what was the current situation in China like?

"...... Let's just keep going for now."

They steeled themselves and pressed on."

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Thirty North Korean hard mode players showed off their strength in a chaotic situation. United, they took down monsters with perfect teamwork.

They kept moving forward.

A week later, they arrived at Baekdu Mountain.

* * *

"Wow..."

People couldn't help but gasp at the breathtaking scenery unfolding before their eyes.

Baekdu Mountain was no different from before, even with monsters occupying the earth. Kim Hwi-yeon muttered.

"This was one of my bucket list items, and I'm achieving it like this."

Baekdu Mountain was covered in snow. Kim Hwi-yeon said calmly.

"Since the quest is likely to take a long time, let's prepare our shelter first."

Unlike in the city, where they had progressed so far, they needed to create a simple resting space in a place without human scent, as they would be proceeding with the quest.

People started to work hard, cutting down trees and clearing the land.

Meanwhile, some of them, including Lee Tae-yeon, Kang Tae-san, and Kim Hwi-yeon, headed towards the sky. They wanted to survey their surroundings from the highest point to ensure their safety.

"Wow."

Kim Hwi-yeon let out a small cheer as he gazed at the sky.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A long-lost pure and beautiful emotion began to revive. Ichika and Geumjunggeun also sparkled in their eyes.

However, Taesan was expressionless. He had come too far to feel the emotion of beauty now. The countless hours had taken away a few emotions from him.

And Lee Taeyeon also had a lukewarm expression.

"Doesn't it move you at all?"

"I don't know. Is this really that touching? I've never been interested in art or beauty from the beginning."

Taesan chuckled at her response.

In her past life, Lee Taeyeon had collected artworks. It wasn't because she was interested in art, but rather it was a device to pretend to be refined.

But now, she didn't need to wear that mask anymore.

Taesan thought that change wasn't bad.

As they looked around, they came down from Baekdusan.

"Where did the North Korean players who left first go?"

When Lee Taeyeon asked the North Korean player, they replied.

"They must have gone to China.""
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

North Korea was divided into dozens of factions. They were in conflict with each other, trying to eliminate the opposing groups.

However, it was too risky for them to handle it themselves.

So, they sought the help of another country.

It seemed they were heading to China. Lee Tae-yeon asked with a puzzled expression.

"In this situation, for what?"

"Don't expect reason. Even in a life-or-death situation, there are many people who would sacrifice their lives for a small gain."

"That may be true, but..."

Kim Hwi-yeon spoke with a hesitant expression, responding to Taesan's words.

"Since the Chinese side hasn't arrived yet, let's prepare for now."

They began to clean up the monsters that appeared around Baekdu Mountain.

With mixed feelings of anticipation and anxiety, they waited for the Chinese players to arrive.

And a week later...

They finally appeared.

* * *

"Here they come."

Taesan muttered, looking far into the distance from the top of Baekdu Mountain. Lee Tae-yeon, who was catching his breath beside him, asked.

"Who is it?"

"The Chinese. There are a lot of them."

"Oh, really?"

Lee Tae-yeon stood up and turned his gaze in the direction Taesan was looking.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$“I can’t see anything.”

“It will still take a few hours.”

“Can you see that distance?”

Itaewon, who had been silent, asked with a look of disbelief. Tesean stood up.

“Tell the people. They’re coming soon.”

“Oh, yes.”

Soon, the news that Chinese players were coming spread to everyone. People gathered and waited with complex emotions.

And the appearance of Chinese players began to be seen.

“……what?”

Kim Hwiyeon’s face hardened.

Her eyesight wasn’t as good as Tesean’s, but it was quite good. She could read the expression of a person who was a few kilometers away.

With her line of sight reaching all the way to the horizon, from one end to the other.

Everywhere she could see with her eyes.

It was filled with people, and yet it didn’t end.

“Wait a minute. How many people is this?”

Others also realized the number and grumbled.

Kwakwung!

The ground shook every time they walked.

Even when a monster rose in the middle and rushed towards them, it was swallowed up by their overwhelming numbers and couldn’t even stop their steps.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

People gazed blankly at the approaching figures.

A massive, magnificent red carriage in front of them seized everyone's attention.

The carriage was extremely magnificent.

It was as if it had gathered all the decorations in this ruined world, and its splendor was overwhelming.

It had taken the Chinese players more than a week to arrive at Baekdu Mountain, but despite the monsters blocking their path, not a single speck of dust had accumulated on the carriage.

Whoa.

Dozens of people were carrying the carriage.

It was a sight reminiscent of an imperial procession.

A scrawny man standing beside the carriage let out a loud shout.

"Behold! The dragon's incarnation!"

He cried out, like a eunuch following the emperor.

"The great and noble one who possesses the qualities of the Heavenly Emperor, who has pacified the vast lands and rules over us! His Majesty the Emperor has descended upon this place! All people, bow your heads and worship the emperor's dignity!"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
