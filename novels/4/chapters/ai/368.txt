**Episode 369**

**369. The 77th Floor, a World on the Brink of Destruction (1)**

While Taesan was descending into the labyrinth, others achieved certain results and encountered various events.

Let's start with Lee Tae-yeon and Gang Joon-hyuk.

[**Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]**: We've descended to the 40th floor.] [**Gang Taesan [Alone]**: You're really fast.] [**Amelia Airin [Alone]**: ……Already?]

Amelia was quietly astonished. While she was clearing the Earth's quest, Lee Tae-yeon and Gang Joon-hyuk had caught up to her at an incredible speed.

[**Gang Joon-hyuk [Alone]**: The things my brother told me were really helpful in many ways. We did encounter some dangerous enemies, but we made it down without much trouble.]

It seemed like they had finally entered a stable zone. As long as they didn't become complacent or overly careless, they would be able to descend without major difficulties for the time being.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard]: We've also descended quite a bit. The fast ones have already reached the mid-60th floor.] [Gang Tae-san[Alone]: That's okay.] [Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard]: But it's getting stuck now. From here on, it's going to take a lot of time.]

It was as if the Alone mode, also known as the "Deep" mode, suddenly increased in difficulty, just like the Hard mode. It seemed like it would be stuck for a while.

[Amelia Airin[Alone]: We need to hurry down. If we don't, we'll get caught up.] [Daniel Darmon[Hard]: We've just returned, so there's nothing we can do.] [Gang Jun-hyeok[Alone]: But if it's like this, when will the next return quest be? From our perspective, it's not an unusual time to start looking for the next return quest.] [Oliver Kan[Hard]: But we've just returned to the labyrinth. I don't think the quest will be given to us that quickly.] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Do you know something, Tae-san?] [Gang Tae-san[Alone]: I don't know either.]

Tae-san also didn't know what would happen. Since many things had changed from his past life, his memories of his past life were no longer of much use.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Kang Tae-san[Alone]: I can call you now, or I can call you later. I'm fully prepared.]

[Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Yes.]

[Kang Jun-hyuk[Alone]: Ah, by the way, how far down did you go, hyung?]

[Kang Tae-san[Alone]: 77 floors.]

[Amelia Airin[Alone]: ……Really?]

The community suddenly became noisy.

[Oliver Kan[Hard]: Huh. It's hard to grasp. With that level of strength, how strong are you?]

[Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Are you really going to clear it soon?]

[Kang Tae-san[Alone]: I still have a long way to go.]

It's possible that I'll need more time than I've spent in the labyrinth so far to clear the remaining floors.

[Kang Tae-san[Alone]: I'll still finish faster than you guys.]

[Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: So, are you going to return to Earth first, or will you wait for us at the 100th floor?]

[Kang Tae-san[Alone]: I'm not sure.]

Tae-san was also worried about that.

After exchanging a few more words, Tae-san turned off the community.

With his current abilities, Tae-san could return faster than anyone else.

The question was, what to do with the time difference.

And how to revive the ruined Earth.

The polluted air. The rotten land. The desolate land and the withered sea.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In their past lives, they didn't worry too much. Their goal was to survive, and that was it. They just had to protect their narrow territory and live among the monsters. There was no need to bother with trivial things.

But it's not like that now.

What Taesan wants now is not just simple survival, but to drive out the evil spirits from the earth and start living again.

Rebuilding civilization, cultivating the land, and having children.

That was his most fundamental goal in turning back time.

The players of the labyrinth could withstand the polluted air with their enhanced physical bodies. Although it was impossible to farm in the rotten land, they could use limited farming methods. However, the newly born children couldn't withstand the polluted air.

Even limited farming wasn't omnipotent.

There were no living beasts, so it was impossible to consume meat.

To live on earth again, not just survive, they had to solve many problems.

They could use the labyrinth's items, but it was only a local power. Since the earth's roots were severely damaged, it couldn't be easily solved.

"What should I do?"

There were many worries. For now, Taesan thought that he could find a solution if he went down to the labyrinth.

Taesan went down to the 77th floor."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[77th Floor Quest Begins.] [Stabilize the world on the brink of destruction by Goshin.] [Reward: The Blood-Soaked Hammer of the Cruel.] [Secret Reward: Changes depending on your achievement.]"

"Hmm?"

Taesan narrowed his eyes after reading the quest conditions.

A world on the brink of destruction by Goshin.

Taesan thought for a moment and nodded his head. As soon as he accepted, his body jumped through space.

Thud.

Taesan landed on the ground.

What he felt was the polluted air.

And the sensation of the rotten earth.

And the extremely dark faces of the people.

Taesan realized that this place was in the same state as the earth on the brink of destruction.

* * *

The polluted air pierced his lungs.

For someone of Taesan's level, it wasn't a big deal. Even if he were an ordinary human with no powers, it wouldn't be a problem for now.

But as time passed and the pollution accumulated, the body would deteriorate and the mind would become corrupted.

[Is this the quest.]

"Do you know?"

[Do you know that Goshin wants to destroy this world? And that as a result, many planets with life have been destroyed?]

Taesan nodded. After clearing the quest of Vesagita, the demon god had told him that 258 worlds had been destroyed by Goshin.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's been a while, so the numbers must have increased by now.

[It's not like the gods are just sitting idly by while being attacked by the gods' enemies. They're trying to protect the world from being attacked and drive out the gods' enemies. You've done similar quests before, haven't you?]

The God of Magic, Zerband's Quest, the world of the arrogant giant.

That world was being invaded by the gods' enemies.

[So, the gods each protect their own world. Sometimes they succeed without a hitch, and sometimes they fail and the world is destroyed. And even if they succeed in protecting it, there are worlds that are left in ruins and can't be fully protected.]

"Is this one of those places?"

There was no hope on the faces of the people walking around. The ghost nodded in agreement.

[This quest isn't mainly about fighting. The goal is to restore and stabilize this broken world.]

Taesan gathered his magic and activated the realm detection in Lelazie's domain. The planet's information flowed into Taesan.

The land where people lived was about the size of a single city. A considerable number of people were living there.

The realm detection extended beyond the city, spreading out."

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The monsters of the ancient god cannot be felt. Considering the vast range of his detection, it's likely that there's nothing around here, and it's not unreasonable to think that they don't exist at all.

The goal of the quest is to stabilize this place.

Then, how can we stabilize it?

Someone called out to Taesan, who was thinking about the method.

"Hey, young man."

An old man beckoned to Taesan from inside a worn-out tent.

Taesan followed the old man's gesture and approached him.

"Who are you? I've never seen your face before. Are you from another city?"

"Another city?"

"......Maybe?"

The old man's eyes widened.

"You... Could you be someone from outside the city?"

It seemed like the old man was asking if Taesan had survived from outside the city and arrived here. Taesan nodded.

The old man chuckled and stroked his beard.

"Haha. I thought all the survivors from outside the city were dead, but it seems there's still one alive. It's fate that we met like this. Follow me. I'll tell you about this place."

The old man led Taesan to a dilapidated hut.

"Will you drink?"

The old man handed Taesan a rusty bowl. It contained some unknown, murky liquid with strange bits floating around, similar to soup."

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan shook his head. The old man chuckled and sat down in a worn-out chair.

"I'm a survivor who's been through a lot. Unfortunately, my luck is bad. I managed to survive, but I ended up in this ruined city of all places."

"Are there many cities like this?"

"Yes."

The old man said, stroking his beard.

"This is one of the last cities of humanity. It's a place where abandoned people gather, called Bereziak. It's a city that's barely alive."

The old man's face was gloomy as he spoke. Taesan realized something from the old man's words.

"I suppose the other cities are in better condition than this one."

"There are a total of five cities."

The old man began to explain slowly.

"Each city is controlled by a different group, and they're all in conflict with each other. The power of the four groups is almost equal. Except for us, that is."

Just as the old man finished speaking, a small commotion approached. A young boy, still in his teens, entered the torn tent.

"Grandfather! I'm here!"

The boy looked at Taesan with wide eyes.

"......Who is this?"

"He's an outsider who came from outside," the old man said.

The boy's eyes widened even further at the old man's words.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is that an outsider? Is there a survivor from outside?"

"I was surprised too."

"Why did they have to come to our city? They should've gone to a different city. They're so unlucky."

The boy opened the package. A moldy bread came out from inside.

"Well, Grandfather. Today, we're lucky to have found bread. We discovered it buried deep in the ground."

The boy handed the bread to the old man as if it was a real treasure. The mold had covered the entire bread, making it hard to find a decent part.

"I'm sorry, but I can't eat this."

The boy looked at the old man with a strong gaze, as if saying that if they didn't take this, they wouldn't be able to survive tomorrow. His attitude was firm, as if he was determined to resist.

The old man said,

"You people are a discarded group, abandoned by another group."

"The old and the children are useless to them, so we were abandoned. Those who tried to resist and fight back were all chased away to this place."

The old man sighed, rubbing his waist.

"We have no power. But since we've managed to survive this far, we can't just give up and die. We're doing our best to live on."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan quietly listened to the old man's words.

* * *

Taesan bid farewell to the old man and wandered around the city.

The inside of the city was more desolate than he had imagined.

There was no proper food, clothing, or shelter, and people were barely surviving from day to day.

It was hard to find decent land. They couldn't produce proper food and were struggling to get by, consuming what little they had left.

"What should I do?"

Taesan thought quietly to himself.

His quest was to restore peace to this place.

Peace wasn't just about surviving; it meant being able to produce continuous food, have children, and dream of the future.

To achieve that, Taesan had to take the lead in managing the city.

He needed to find ways to expand the territory, eliminate air pollution, and create land that could sustain life.

Taesan realized that.

This quest was not only about saving the world but also about how to restore the Earth after everything was over. It was also a test.
