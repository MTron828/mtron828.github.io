Chapter 246

246. The Fourth Return. Earth (13)

The meeting room where people gathered to elect a leader in Seoul.

People had gathered there again.

"What about Sa-young?"

"He's dead."

"Ah......"

The number of people had decreased from before. They closed their eyes for a moment and prayed for the souls of the dead.

"Then, Taesan."

After the moment of silence, Kim Hwi-yeon asked Taesan.

"Can you tell me a rough story about what happened?"

"I came to explain it."

Taesan opened his mouth.

He explained that Go-shin had tried to capture him and kill them, and that he had won in the process.

And as a result of his victory, the gods descended, he said.

The people looked at each other with skepticism and amazement at the mention of the gods.

"What do you mean by gods......"

"Is that the kind of god we're thinking of? Jesus Christ?"

"No, it's different."

Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan shook his head. According to Tai Shan's experience, the concept of a single supreme being did not exist. Each of them had transcended mortality and had different levels of power, and they were all in a good relationship with each other.

They did not harbor hostility towards each other. Instead, they could be seen as allies united against a common enemy.

Tai Shan briefly explained, and people let out a sigh.

"That's what you mean, huh?..."

"It's made with their power... This is indeed heavy."

"It's not important anyway."

Tai Shan opened his mouth.

"What's important is that we survive and win."

His words lit up the eyes of the people.

"That's right."

"That's true. Winning is important."

From the moment they were trapped in this labyrinth, they had expected that a transcendent being would intervene. According to Tai Shan, what was important was their survival.

"Did everyone receive their reward?"

"Yes."

Kim Hui-yeon nodded her head.

The blessing of the god of despair. It awakens one's sense of self-preservation when one falls into despair.

Everyone here was at least a hard mode player. They knew how big an advantage that was.

"Really, thank you, Tai Shan."

"That's all. You guys did well too. Honestly, I thought you would all die."

Note: The text appears to be a scene from a fantasy novel or game, with characters discussing their experiences and strategies in a labyrinth. The translation aims to preserve the original meaning and tone of the text.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The people who survived were exactly half.

If it were big, it would be a big loss, but considering the situation, it would be a small gain. Kim Hui-yeon bit her lip.

"It's because everyone worked hard, you know. We risked our lives just like that."

We cannot make a waste of their sacrifices.

They had to survive. They had to do their part.

They slowly checked the changes.

"So, the first change is......"

"Can we get skills on Earth too?"

Seo Jang-san asked.

"Has it been confirmed?"

"Yes, there were people who got skills during the process of removing the cracks. They all got skills and can use them now."

"Is that really true? Can we learn skills here too......"

Seo Jang-san let out a sigh. It's possible to learn skills on Earth. The implications of this fact were huge.

Surviving on Earth is not easy. Even those who had fought for their lives in the labyrinth had to risk their lives again.

And skills could be obtained with a high probability in extreme situations.

In other words, it was not rare to learn skills while clearing quests on Earth.
Here is the translation of the text:

So far, it was necessary to seal it until we returned to the labyrinth, but now it can be used immediately after learning. Although there may not be a significant change in the short term, it will undoubtedly be a significant advantage in the long run.

"That's good. I've also confirmed the next change."

Kim Hwiyeon took out a red potion from her inventory and threw it to Lee Taeyeon. Lee Taeyeon caught it with a skilled hand.

Lee Taeyeon held the potion with a strange expression.

"It's really okay."

The exchange of consumable items. What was previously impossible has been resolved.

Until now, I had tried to pass the potion, but it would all bounce back and return to its original owner.

However, the potion I passed to Lee Taeyeon has changed from being Kim Hwiyeon's property to being Lee Taeyeon's property. Lee Taeyeon threw the potion back to Kim Hwiyeon, and Kim Hwiyeon put it in her inventory.

"Honestly, this is the best."

A smile appeared on Kim Hwiyeon's lips.

The exchange of consumable items. Its value is immense.

"How many potions do you guys have left?"

"One."

"I've used them all up. It was a close call."

As a whole, we only had one or two left, and we couldn't have any. That's how intense the battle was.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The potions are expensive. We also need to buy other equipment and use them a lot while going down to the dungeon, so we can't bring back much when we return to the earth. But now...‚Äù

"We can make people from the normal mode bring potions back."

"Yes."

Kim Hwi-yeon nodded vigorously.

"After listening to the story, it seems that the place is more stable than hard mode in terms of getting gold. If they bring back a lot of consumables every time they return, they can fight much more stably."

The amount of gold dropped by the monsters was much more abundant in hard mode, but the difficulty was higher.

In normal mode, if we combine our strength, we can catch monsters without using up potions, but in hard mode, we have to use one potion each time we catch a monster.

It was not easy to gather gold in hard mode.

As long as they had a system to protect their vitality, they didn't die even when they had a chance to drink potions.

However, if they didn't have any potions to use, it was insufficient to take advantage of the system's benefits.

One of the main reasons people died in the previous return was that they didn't have enough means to recover.

The problem was solved in the next return.

Then someone said something.
Here is the translation of the text:

"But is that okay? Honestly, you're not going to help those people who are in Ji and Normal mode, so you're just asking for potions, right? Won't they be upset?"

"I've thought about that too... but I can't help it."

Kim Whiyan said coldly.

"There is no way for everyone to live together in satisfaction. There may be resistance, but they have to accept it too."

"The big problem won't occur."

Taesan said. The people in Ji and Normal mode trust Kim Whiyan, who has not abandoned them. They will accept what she says.

"So... then..."

"It's the last one... then..."

They trailed off, looking uncertain.

The most important content was put on hold, and it was unclear how it would change. Kim Whiyan let out a sigh.

"Quests will now proceed by nation... finally."

The system window appeared at the end.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Congratulations! You have cleared the last quest in your region. [The barrier surrounding each country will be removed. From now on, you will be able to move to other countries without restrictions, but be aware that you may face penalties in future quests.] [The next time you return, national quests will be available. Be prepared and get ready.] [The community will expand, and you will be able to communicate with players from other countries, not just those from your own country.]"

"How will it be?"

Kim Hwi-yeon asked Taesan, and everyone's attention was focused on him.

Taesan knew what was to come. He knew what they had to prepare for and what they had to do.

But that was a story from another life. Taesan shook his head.

"I don't know."

"Of course not. Even Taesan couldn't know this far in advance."

"If you knew, you'd be a god. That's what I mean."

"Since the community is open, let's go back to the labyrinth and think about it."

"I guess that's what we'll do."

In the community, people from other countries, including Japan, China, America, and Europe, could communicate with each other.

They could see how people lived and what they did.

The fact filled people's faces with anticipation and anxiety.

"Did we really get wiped out?"

"Ah, no way."

"There's a possibility. Because there's......"

Taesan wasn't there.

The people's attention was focused on his last words.

Taesan, who was leaning against the wall, moved.

"I'll be back tomorrow, so you guys take care of the rest."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Is Taesan here?"

"I have something to attend to."

He went out. Outside, people were rejoicing over survival, mourning death, and discussing their hopes and anxieties for the future.

Just then, they saw Taesan. They jumped up and ran towards Taesan.

"Wow!"

"Taesan, Taesan!"

They cried out with excitement.

They saw Taesan meeting Aphrodite. Although they didn't know what his true identity was, they could infer that he was a being who had bestowed blessings on them.

As a result, they naturally thought that Taesan had bestowed blessings on them.

Their faith grew even stronger.

As Taesan was passing by, a familiar face appeared.

"Taesan!"

A young man rushed towards Taesan, shouting fiercely.

I Changchun.

He was a hardcore player who had been beaten up by Taesan during his last rebirth.

"I'm alive."

Taesan smiled and left the audience area.

He looked up at the sky.
Here is the translation of the text:

The crack in the sky was in a state of dormancy. It was as if it was waiting for the next turn, like waiting for something to happen.

"What was that supposed to mean?"

"If you have that kind of power, you can approach those things in a different way."

Afrodia said that.

But what it meant was still unknown.

"Then, are we going back to the labyrinth again?"

Minerva nodded in response to Minerva's words. She chuckled and said:

"It's been a busy day. I didn't expect to meet the transcendent being directly. I fought with the gods and... it was fun. I didn't expect to have this experience so soon after being born."

Minerva's face was satisfied as she continued to speak.

"I don't know what kind of power the master has, but the master is in charge of it. That's enough."

Minerva's body began to shake like a TV with noise.

The power needed for summoning was almost depleted and was about to be reversed.

"Can't you call me for a while?"

"I'll just keep going down the labyrinth. It's not the time yet? You have things to do too?"

Minerva was the guardian of Araulia. She had to protect that world.

"Right. I'll be away for a while."

Here is the translation of the text:

Minerva gazed at the Barkazza.

"Barkazza, take care of me even when I'm not here."

[I am also the king's lord, but I am also your lord. I must take care of you.]

"I'll trust you. Ghost, you too."

[What would you take care of if you're a ghost?]

"Is that so?"

Minerva smiled. Her body began to disappear along with the noise.

"Well, see you next time, my lord."

[Minerva was summoned again.]

She disappeared.

Taesan looked up at the empty space and said, "See you next time."

And time passed.

[Bonus: 743 points for defeating a monster + 587 points for fixing a rift + 1245 points for defeating a special monster + 255 points for winning]

...

[Calculation complete] [2,830 points will be awarded.]

* * *

Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

The calculated points were 2,800, a considerable amount. There were many benefits that could be obtained with these points.

However, Taesan opened a community.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Kim Hui-yeon [Hard] : Oh, oh...!] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone] : Wait a minute, can you slow down for a bit?] [Adam Smith [Alone] : What's going on? I didn't think you'd be alive at all, let alone thinking.] [Rachel Uchitel [Hard] : Me, me, please slow down a bit. The speed is too fast and we can't have a conversation... ] [Miyuki Kazuya [Normal] : Whoa, there are people! So many!]

The community's posts were rising rapidly, making it impossible to have a conversation.

Tae-san was slightly startled.

"Much faster than before."

In his past life, he wasn't slow either, but now he feels like he's been slowed down.

"Did people in other countries live longer than before too?"

The power of the high-level skill was focused on Tae-san, giving him more leisure time than before.

However, since it was too fast to check anything, Tae-san closed the community.

He planned to talk about it later when he had calmed down a bit.

Tae-san didn't start using the point system either. There was something he needed to check first.

[Boundary] [Proficiency: ?] [Beyond the laws and rules, something in between. It's like pulling out the sacred and black. ?????] [System error. Please contact the administrator of the labyrinth for more information.]
