Chapter 429

429. The 84th Floor, Levienov's World (2)

The girl with ash-colored hair sat quietly, her eyes closed.

She seemed to be trying to sense something, holding her breath and controlling her breathing.

"......I can feel it. You're coming to this place."

The girl murmured, her voice filled with excitement and anticipation.

"How will you react? Will you curse me? Or will you show me pity? Will you rage and tell me to kill you?"

The girl giggled, as if she would be satisfied with any outcome.

"I won't back down. So come quickly to this place. My prince."

In front of the girl was something in the shape of a human.

* * *

Taesan stepped onto the 84th floor.

[84th Floor Quest Begins.] [Defeat the Abyss that Corrodes Everything.] [Reward: Engraving on a weapon.] [Secret Reward: ???]

And at the same time, Balbam appeared.

"We meet again."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It means you've done a lot of things. I can't just send you down to the 84th floor like this. The ordinary 84th floor is too easy for you."

The wizard said. "I'll adjust the difficulty of the labyrinth to match Taesan's level. It seems the 84th floor will become like that."

"It's fortunate that Ainzhart gave you a suitable quest. Ainzhart's quest for you. I'll change it to an 84th floor quest."

"84th Floor Quest Start."
"Complete Ainzhart's quest."
"Reward: Engraving on a weapon."
"Secret Reward: ???"

Kugugong!

The labyrinth changes. It shakes and moves according to Taesan's level. And then it stops moving.

"You'll see it when you pass through the corridor."

Taesan stepped into the changed labyrinth, just as Balbam said.

As he walked through the corridor at a suitable distance and opened the door, he saw a shimmering space corridor.

And beyond that, he saw a world that had collapsed.

The destroyed world of Lebinenov, where everything was dyed black.

It was the first time he had seen a world that had been perfectly destroyed by the gods.

"To be honest, I don't want to send you there."

Balbam said, showing his reluctance as the administrator of the quest.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That place is a world devoured by the gods. It can no longer be called the land of this world. It's close to their realm. That's why the gods' influence is stronger than ours."

The world beyond the portal was very unfamiliar. It was similar to the realm of the gods I saw in Arulia.

"The gods' gaze will be focused on that place. As soon as you take a step, you'll see them move immediately." "Of course, it's dangerous, but isn't it a struggle for life and death, the purpose of the labyrinth?" "He won't die there."

Balbam said so. His voice was filled with calm confidence.

"On the contrary, that's why it's a problem."

"â€¦Does that mean the gods won't kill me?"

When I think about it, it was the same before.

The god I met in the demon world, the old demon god.

He didn't try to kill Taesan.

He was trying to capture Taesan. It was as if killing wasn't their purpose.

"I personally think it's better to leave it like this, but the wizards and gods think differently. They want you to know the truth."

The truth.

"But even if we go to that world, we won't be able to withstand it. So, we'll give you our blessing."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power of Balbam is revealed. As the administrator of the labyrinth, he acts on behalf of the gods to bestow blessings upon Taesan.

[The method is already in your mind. Use this one-time blessing carefully.]

Taesan meets the gods. The blessings of all of them are embedded within Taesan.

[However, even if you activate the blessings, if the high gods have made up their minds to target you, it's meaningless. So, the gods will take direct action.]

Kiiiiik!

A tearing sound echoed from beyond the passage. A massive collision of powers was felt.

[The gods will prevent the high gods from intervening directly. We can't hold out for long, so let's handle it quickly and get out.]

"Is this really necessary?"

It was unprecedented for so many gods to intervene like this since the gods' war. Even if they favored Taesan, it didn't seem like they would go this far to help clear the quest.

[This quest has significance even for the gods. Levienov is a god contaminated by the high gods. Even the transcenders couldn't do anything about it. If it's a confirmation of that possibility, it's worth investing in.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If that's the case, I could understand it clearly. After Levinov took his place in the labyrinth, magicians and transcendents must have tried various methods, but Levinov was not restored.

If Taesan could do it, it would be worth expending enough power from the gods' perspective.

[And there's also the psychological aspect of wanting to know the truth yourself. It's easier to understand when you realize it directly rather than being told by someone else.]

Barbabamba expanded the passage.

[Check the rest yourself. I'll pray for your safe return.]

Taesan put his body through the passage.

At the same time, a very unfamiliar sensation enveloped his entire body. It felt like being thrown into space. It was as if he was falling into a world where the laws of the world didn't apply, gravity disappeared, and friction didn't exist.

Taesan wrapped his body in divinity and crossed the passage.

And he set foot in the black world.

The world looked normal at first glance.

The forest, rocks, and plains all had their original forms, except that they were dyed black.

But nothing could be felt. There was no scent of grass, no natural wind. It was literally empty."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This was a world that was destroyed by God's wrath.

Taesan looked up at the sky.

There, enormous beings were colliding. The shockwaves spreading from the battle alone had the power to shatter stars.

I had to complete the quest before their fight ended.

The quest was to find the relics of Levienov left in the destroyed world.

The destination was not difficult to find. In a world where nothing could be felt, there was a place where divinity could be sensed. That was where Levienov's relics existed.

Taesan flew towards that place.

As he began to move seriously, the darkness that had spread throughout the world started to move. They attached themselves to Taesan's entire body, trying to dye his color.

Taesan tried to counter with divinity, but even divinity was dyed black, and its effectiveness was significantly reduced.

After a moment of contemplation, Taesan manifested blackness.

Blackness enveloped Taesan's entire body. Then, the darkness could no longer approach him."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan quickly headed towards his destination. Although Lebinev's world was wider than the Earth, the physical distance was not a significant problem for Taesan at the moment.

A massive building that looked like a temple appeared in Taesan's sight. Like other places, he could sense the divinity emanating from the dark, mysterious interior.

Taesan entered the building.

And there, someone was waiting for him.

"Nice to meet you."

A black-clad man greeted Taesan.

[The empty, monstrous incarnation appeared.]

* * *

He was a man with a dignified appearance.

In terms of appearance, he was handsome. His refreshing smile was enough to win people over.

But he was not alive.

Although he took on a human form, it was only a grotesque imitation of something terrible.

"Immortal?"

No, it wasn't. Although the remnants of it were visible, it was twisted and mixed with something entirely different.

He looked at Taesan's black attire and burst out laughing.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's amazing. There are many beings in this world who have dedicated themselves to others, but those who can wield their power freely like you are extremely rare. Moreover, you haven't even dedicated yourself to anyone. It's understandable why they're interested in you."

Taesan drew his sword. The being in front of him was from the opposing side, his enemy.

The man hastily raised his hands.

"Don't be like that. You and I, can't we be on the same side?"

"Nonsense."

"Aren't you curious about why the gods sent you to this place?"

The man chuckled.

"What's the hurry? Let's have a decent conversation."

After a brief moment of contemplation, Taesan sheathed his sword.

"Fine."

The man seemed rather relieved that Taesan didn't resist further.

"......Well, okay. You've come to this world, and there's only one thing you desire, right? Come this way."

The man entered the temple.

Taesan followed him calmly.

"Is that what you desire?"

In the deepest part of the temple, there was a sacred relic. It was a small pillar-shaped relic containing the remnants of a transcendent being, with a power level even higher than Taesan's current state.

"That's it."

With that relic, it was possible to restore Levinov to his original state.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Just as Taesan was about to take the sacred object, the man blocked his way.

"Let's talk before that."

"What do you want from me?"

"It's not difficult. Taesan, a mixed existence."

The man smiled and made a suggestion.

"Won't you join us?"

* * *

"Are you taking the side of the high gods?"

"I won't deny it."

"Nonsense."

Taesan rejected him. The high gods were those who destroyed his world and targeted him. There was no reason to join them.

"Of course, I understand your feelings. They are the destroyers of the world, destroying and ruining this world. You must have suffered losses in the process. But think about it differently."

The man raised his hand.

"You're alive. The ones who died are unrelated to you. Let's set aside personal feelings and look at it objectively. There's no problem, right?"

Taesan silently stared at the man. The man twisted his lips.

"More than anything, you're misunderstanding. It's not their fault. This weak world is at fault. Don't you think this world is too fragile?"

The man's face distorted.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"People are dying without any meaning, and even those who have reached the highest realm are losing their lives to the whims of the gods. It's no different even if you become immortal! With a light wave of the Transcendent's hand, everything you've built up and worked for disappears!"

He shouted in anger.

"This world is rotten! It's a wrong world!"

Taesan didn't deny the man's words.

The God of Decline immediately showed the man the reality of his words. He blocked the potential of countless talented mortals and treated them as his playthings.

It wasn't limited to the God of Decline. The demon tribe of Vesgetha, who were considered gods in that place, were driven to extinction by Hamon. And Hamon was crushed by the demon god along with Vesgetha.

In the process, countless lives were lost.

Most Transcendents don't respect mortals. That was the conclusion Taesan had drawn. The demon god only cared for the demon tribe, but had no interest in humans.

Taesan looked at the man.

"You were an immortal."

"That's right. But I almost lost everything due to the damn Transcendent's prank. In the process, a great being saved me."

The man smiled savagely.

"I dedicated myself to them. I became the avatar of the great being, carrying out their will. That's what I am."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, what do you want me to do?"

Taesan said indifferently.

"Gosin is a being that has been expelled. Although they're somehow intervening in the world, they're ultimately losers, and that won't change."

"No."

The man laughed.

"Taesan, you should know. Their influence is growing stronger with time. Do you know what that means? It means the seal of the Transcendents who expelled them is weakening!"

Ku-u-ung!

A massive wave of power burst forth from the distant sky.

Blackness began to engulf the world from beyond the universe. Although the Transcendents suppressed it, the blackness left an indelible scar on the world.

The man burst into a mad laugh.

"They'll be back soon! To this world they were expelled from! And they'll trample everything and restore the world to its original state!"
