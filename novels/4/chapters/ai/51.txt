Episode 52

52. 10th Floor (1)

Route-Ra accepted death calmly. Not only that, he even threw his own weapon directly.

The orcs, like him, did not blame Taesan or erupt in anger.

Taesan checked the hastily made spear.

[Hastily Made Spear] [Attack Power + 10] [A hastily made spear. Very sharp, but it will break quickly if not handled carefully.]

An attack power of 10. It was a considerably high figure. It was a two-handed weapon that needed to be handled carefully, but it was worth changing.

[There are also movements for the spear in the Storm Scar. You probably have it in your head?]

"Roughly."

Accumulated knowledge. It was a problem that could be solved by moving a few times with the body, although it was still awkward.

And the clear reward for the 10th floor.

[Swift Boots] [Defense + 7] [Agility + 5] [Movement Speed + 10%] [Action Speed + 5%] [Light and sturdy boots. Optimized for swift movement.]
The numbers matched well with the name and description. Agility and movement speed, with added action speed. Taesan changed into the boots.

And he confirmed the secret reward too.

[You have obtained the Frostlight Sword.]

"Oh."

It was a sword. The length was not much different from the one he currently used. Finally, it seemed he could change weapons.

[Frostlight Sword] [Attack Power + 11] [A sword that once held the cold of the bottom. It has lost that power now, but the blade still shines with the light of frost.]

High. It reaches an attack power of 11. Taesan happily drew out the splendid sword. Opening the status window, the stats matched very nicely.

[Attack Power + 30] [Defense + 40]

It didn't hold much significance, but personally, he felt good.

And after a long time, he also received a title.

[Title: Cursed by Goblins] [The one who killed their master.] [All stats opposing you by goblins increase.] [All rewards received upon defeating goblins increase.]
Here is the English translation of the text:

"Though the opponent becomes stronger, the title also improves accordingly. You never know when goblins might appear again, but just owning the title activates its effects. There's no harm in having it.

[Title: King Slayer] [The one who killed a king.] [Stats increase and rewards are enhanced when facing lords, kings, and rulers of various species.]

This is a title that wasn't obtained in the previous life because there were no enemies like lords to face.

Increased stats and enhanced rewards. It was the best effect a title could have.

After confirming everything, Taesan returned before moving on to the next floor. He helped Lillis, who was carrying items to the safety zone, with a grunt.

"Phew! Thanks! I guess I should buy a makeshift space at the store."

He handed her a staff and offered a tribute to the panting girl.

[You have learned the veil of concealment.] [Basic Magic: Veil of Concealment] [Mana Consumption: 4] [Proficiency: 1%] [Conceals the body's presence.]

With this, he had learned all magic except invisibility. Taesan, after confirming, said,

"And I won't be here for a while."

"Huh? Going outside?"

"Probably for about a month or two."

"Oh... if you stay here for too long, it gets tiring, so it's good to have a change of pace."
Here's the translation of the text into English:

Lillis nodded with a look that showed she understood.

"Take a break!"

"See you later."

Taesan headed back towards the descending stairs.

As always, the system window appeared.

[Quest on 10th floor begins.] [Defeat the boss on the 10th floor and proceed.] [Reward: Ogre Ring] [Secret Reward: ???] [Ending soon.]

The ghost spoke. Its tone was indifferent, devoid of emotion.

"Alright."

Taesan encountered a dwarf. This time, instead of heading straight down as usual, he explored the shop.

He purchased many things. Arrows. Health and mana recovery potions. Swift, fury, and others. Numerous potions.

Each item went slowly into his inventory. The amount was enough to astonish the dwarf who had been watching.

"How long will these last you?"

"The more, the better."

He had struggled considerably before due to not preparing potions in advance. With his current stats, it shouldn't be a problem, but there was no harm in being prepared.

After selling some of the materials he had, he used half of his total gold to buy potions. The items in the shop seemed noticeably depleted.

"Well then, good luck."
"Good grief."

Ignoring the dwarf's mocking laughter, Taesan headed towards the 10th floor.

"Kuooo!"

[The Ogre has appeared.]

Its massive muscles were visible. Its size fluctuated, almost reaching the ceiling of the labyrinth, as it roared.

Ogre. People called this monster a muscle monster upon seeing it.

In terms of strength alone, it was a monster beyond standard, fitting the role of a deep boss. Even in Normal mode, it was difficult to find someone capable of confronting it, making it a kind of final stage in easy difficulty.

"Kuooo!"

The Ogre swung down with its swollen arm muscles. The pressure from this strike would render a weak opponent immobile.

Taesan calmly extended his arm.

Kwoong!

Wind exploded. Taesan didn't even step back.

"Kuo?"

The confused Ogre's arm was grabbed and thrown. The giant's body flew through the narrow room.

The Ogre was bewildered.

Why am I flying?

Why did this puny thing throw me?

He realized something was wrong, but Ogre lacked the intelligence to deduce what it was
Under the vast intellect, the Ogre once again charged with a roar.

"Kuooo!"

Taesan shook his fist. His hand blurred for a moment as it pounded into the Ogre's chest like crumpled scrap metal.

"Kuuooo!"

The Ogre flew like a thrown baseball.

After that, it was a repetition of the same pattern. The Ogre regained its senses, shaking its head, and charged, only to be knocked down by Taesan.

[You have defeated the Ogre.]

Without a single cut, it was brought down with fists alone. Taesan wore a satisfied expression.

"I caught it like this."

He had faced this Ogre before. It was a monster with strength akin to a beast, and normal weapons couldn't penetrate its hide, forcing him to fight for his life before acquiring higher skills. Even after gaining those skills, it was quite a tough monster until obtaining multiplication.

Now, he dispatched such a monster with just his fists.

He remembered those times when he obsessed over each stat. Of course, he didn't miss them.

Taesan leisurely progressed through the 10th floor. Unlike the 9th floor, he moved at a pace that would make one yawn.
He employed methods such as bringing down enemies only with his fists without using weapons, or conversely attacking critical points only with weapons.

Watching him, a curious ghost asked in a puzzled tone,

"Why are you going so late?"

"I have to time it right."

"Time? What do you mean by that?"

"You'll find out soon."

How would it turn out?

Even Taesan couldn't say.

Later on, while hunting monsters, he found a secret room. Once again, his movements were exceedingly leisurely. He disabled all the traps and opened the chests.

[Ring of Azure] [Mana +10] [Contains a tiny fragment of mana. It seems to be nothing more than debris now.]

He changed his equipment and resumed his leisurely pace.

Slowly and deliberately.

But he steadily cleared the labyrinth.

So a day passed, and Taesan arrived at the boss room.

---

"This is it."

The ghost said in a subdued tone.

"Beyond here, he awaits. Defeat the Ogre Warrior and proceed to the second room beyond. There you will find a large fellow. Once you kill him, it's over."

The ghost's quest was to kill the boss on the 10th floor. That's why it stuck with Taesan.
Once the quest was cleared, all remnants disappeared.

"Thank you."

"For what?"

"I could leave a trace of my existence with you."

The ghost spoke calmly.

"My world has perished, and so have I. We are finished. At least leaving those remnants behind was my role."

The ghost seemed somewhat relieved.

"You should be able to descend deep into the abyss. If you proceed without letting your guard down, just as you are now... Someday, you might even conquer this place. I taught the sword to one such person. That should be satisfaction enough."

A voice tinged with slight regret echoed.

"It's a pity I couldn't teach you the second sword... But with you, someday you'll reach it. Perhaps you'll even obtain it until the end. You're capable of that."

A small laughter spread.

"Hahaha... It was enjoyable like that."

The ghost bid farewell, and Taesan silently opened his inventory.

He applied the Seal of Inscription to the Frostlight Sword. Along with it, he used the Rune of Marnius.
[Hoarfrost Sword] [Attack Power +11] [A sword that once held the chill of the abyss. Now it has lost that power, but its blade still gleams with the frost's light.] [It carries the attribute of lightning.] [When parried, there is a low chance to inflict forced debilitation on the enemy.]

The Seal of Inscription has been applied, causing a forced debilitation effect. This noticeably slows movements, a useful effect that could be employed frequently given the clashes in combat. 

And the attribute of lightning.

"That's good."

This was also close to a jackpot.

Weapon attributes activate upon colliding with something.

And regardless of whether it's a monster or a player, metal weapons are used the most.

The lightning attribute created many openings during combat, as it caused a jolt through the opponent's weapon.

Preparations were complete. However, instead of heading to the boss room, Taesan opened up the community.

[Alone [Eolron]: Huh, this feels weird.] [Lee Taeyeon [Eolron]: Hmm... I wonder what will happen...] [Kim Taejin [Eolron]: We should think positively. I'll go open a can of preserved food for now.] [Kang Junhyuk [Eolron]: But where exactly have we been summoned to? Will we appear in the same place as before entering the labyrinth?] [Moon Jaesung [Eolron]: That should be the case, right?]
The community was bustling with activity. While there was usually a lot of chatter, now there were three times as many posts appearing.

Watching quietly, Taesan posted a message.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Junhyuk, where do you live?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Me? Gyeonggi Province. Do you know Anyang?]

That settled that.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Let's talk in a bit.]

Taesan closed the community. He waited patiently, watching the entrance to the boss room.

An impatient ghost spoke up.

[Why aren't you going in?]

The ghost seemed flustered. Now they only needed to defeat the boss, but instead of going in, Taesan was just standing there quietly.

Without taking his eyes off the door, Taesan asked the ghost,

"Are you a resident of this labyrinth?"

"Huh? Well, I suppose you could say that."

Taken aback by the sudden question, the ghost replied calmly.

"While I wouldn't know if I'm alive, as a dead being, I'm bound to this tomb. Thanks to your existence, I've been freed, but fundamentally, nothing has changed."

"That part, yes. I'm bound to you because of a quest."

The ghost didn't leave Taesan's side for a moment. Perhaps they would stay with him until the quest was completed.

And now, questions arose.
"If I descend without defeating the boss, will you continue to stay by my side?"

"...Probably."

The ghost replied in a stiff, resolute tone.

"But that wouldn't be good. It's abandoning the rightful reward you should receive. Comparing it to the information I possess holds no meaning for you. You're an adventurer who doesn't need my information. Consider your own worth. I appreciate your concern, but it's unnecessary."

"I have no intention of doing that."

Of course, the plan is to defeat the boss and then descend.

He was aiming for a different aspect.

"Regardless, as long as the quest remains unbroken, you'll be bound to me. So which judgment is it after all?"

Bound to the labyrinth.

Or progressing through the quest.

The ghost, still not understanding the English, asked.

"What are you doing......"

Rustle.

At that moment, space split apart. Through the beginning of the distortion, the appearance of the world could be seen.

It was Earth.

The ghost was surprised.

"What is this?"

At the same time, a quest window appeared.

"Starting a special quest." "Prepare for shock."

Rustle!
The gap in the split space widens. It pulls outward with the force to engulf the room. The ghost becomes flustered at the diminishing presence of the labyrinth.

"Wait. Hey. What in the world..."

Taesan closes his eyes.

Crash.

Accompanied by the sound of breaking, wind is felt.

It's the natural wind not felt in the labyrinth. The scent of grass and asphalt fills the air. A rich scent never known before.

Taesan opens his eyes.

Buildings come into view.

Structures of enormous human-made constructs, composed of brick and concrete, either broken or intact, adorned the landscape.

He's returned. To this place.

But he wasn't alone.

"...What?"

The ghost is astonished.
