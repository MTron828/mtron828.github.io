66. 10th Floor, Boss (4)

"Are Transcendents different?"

The gods and great beings who have settled here. Ghost denied the question of whether they were different.

"[They are Transcendents, yes. But their kinds are different. Why do you think they expend power when they do something meaningful? It's because they once were mortals who transcended into Transcendents.]"

"Mortals?"

"Yes."

Ghost said quietly.

"How many beings in your world are both human and divine?"

"There are a few."

Beings like Hercules who became gods, similar to Buddhas. They are stories from mythology but undoubtedly exist.

"The Transcendents gathered here are such beings. Rakhiratas, Valtazaha, Oman, Lebinenov. Once, they were mortals."

"All the Transcendents here?"

"Yeah. Every single one of them without exception. They endured trials and rose up, which is why they like places like this. Once they were either human or animals, beings with lifespans. The domains they oversee are connected to their lives, but this story is getting too long, so I'll pass on that."
"So power consumption occurs?"

"[Whether it's spiritual energy, physical strength, or faith, when something exceeds a certain degree, they become Transcendents. And the moment they become Transcendents, the increase in power stops. They become great and mighty beings, but the power they've accumulated remains fixed. It turns into a power that disappears when used.]"

Tae-san stroked his chin. Ghost responded casually.

"Simply put, it's a disadvantage that acquired Transcendents have. They break free from the constraints of mortality with immense power, but they can't easily recover it. Do you follow up to this point?"

"There must be congenital Transcendents too."

Beings born strong, from the moment they were born.

Ghost affirmed.

"Beings that never had a lifespan. They were simply strong from birth. So when they interfere in the world of mortals, they use their power, but there's no permanent consumption like with acquired ones. Unlike those who acquire it later, they just have the power from birth."

Those who become Transcendents from mortals experience power consumption.

Those who have been Transcendents since birth do not experience power consumption.
"And all Transcendents in the labyrinth are acquired Transcendents."

It sounded like a rough story.

"So, are those who attacked my world congenital beings?"

"[...That's highly likely. Acquired ones wouldn't be able to expend that much power.]"

Ghost muttered with a troubled tone in his voice.

"But why are those beings trampling your world?"

"You called them forgotten gods, didn't you?"

Ghost referred to them as beings of the past. Ghost affirmed.

"To be honest, I haven't seen them myself. I only know them through the legends and information here. Until I see them firsthand, I can only speculate. They're beings that vanished long ago. Sort of like ancient gods."

"They vanished?"

"I don't know why. There were talks of wars among Transcendents, or maybe they just disappeared as part of some cosmic order. Whichever it was, they've been unseen for thousands of years."

Despite hearing the explanation, it still didn't make sense to him.

"Why would such beings attack Earth then?"

"I don't know."

Ghost shrugged his shoulders.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Why do crazy people say such things? But they can't release someone who is too strong, can they? They say there's no expenditure of power, but there are limits, so they can only send down to that level."

Ghost explained lightly, but Taesan couldn't easily grasp it.

"Even someone as strong as Itaeyeon came out."

Itaeyeon, who cleared the Alone mode, was defeated.

And monsters stronger than that were still coming out through the rift until the end.

"Even if there are limits, can they really do that?"

He couldn't easily say, as he still didn't know the true power of a Transcendent. The power he saw was truly extraordinary.

"For now, that's enough."

He stored it in his mind.

He received various rewards for clearing the boss on the 10th floor: titles, achievements, and even clearing rewards.

There were quite a few, but he didn't check them immediately.

Taesan headed towards the second room. Beyond the stairs leading to the 11th floor, there was a small door.

"Finally made it here."

With Ghost's calm voice, Taesan entered the room.

"I remember this place."

Itaeyeon also discovered this place. Unlike the rooms of Ha-ge and Ha, it was impossible not to find it.
However, she didn't enter. She had received the clear rewards, but from the beginning, she had avoided such places, considering them clearly dangerous.

Taesan pushed aside the cloth hanging in front of the door.

Inside the narrow room, there was a single ogre.

It was a smaller ogre compared to others, with no significant difference in size from a large person.

However, its eyes were overflowing with intelligence.

The ogre, looking at him, spoke.

"Have you come, warrior?"

*[You have encountered the Ogre Sage.]*

---

An ogre that seemed to lack any presence of intelligence. And a sage with the title of the enlightened.

Ghost had said he died to the second boss on the 10th floor.

That existence was right before him.

The ogre with an unfitting name spoke smoothly.

"I knew a day like this would come someday, but it seems sooner than expected."

The ogre looked at Taesan and asked.

"Is he your puppet?"

[No.]

Ghost replied calmly. His voice showed little emotion.

"I see."

The ogre spoke leisurely as he sat on a chair.

The ogre before him didn't appear stronger than other ogres, but it was a presence that made it awkward to touch something.
"Shall we have a conversation then?"

[A conversation?]

Ghost scoffed.

[You and me?]

"It seems the adventurer before me isn't someone I can defeat."

The ogre's prediction was not wrong. If he didn't possess strength beyond the 20th floor, he would lose a hundred battles out of a hundred. Najik spoke slowly.

"The outcome is already decided anyway. Then shouldn't we satisfy our curiosity?"

It was a soothing voice, as if pacifying a child. Ghost momentarily showed irritation, but quickly composed himself.

[Do as you please.]

"Oh?"

The ogre raised an eyebrow at Ghost's response.

"That's a different answer than I expected. I thought you'd just tell me to kill you."

[What do you think you know about me.]

"An arrogant, rough, and reckless warrior. That's who you are."

The ogre smirked.

Ghost fell silent.

It was a debate that didn't seem like a conversation between killer and killed.

Taesan looked at the sage with caution and asked.

"Did you kill Ghost?"
"If you ask if I killed him, yes, I did. With my own hands."

The ogre drew a small dagger. Ghost, seeing the dagger with its crimson gem, bristled roughly.

[You bastard...]

"It's your fault, warrior."

The ogre spoke with sunken eyes.

"You didn't kill me when you first saw me. Because I was the only one you could talk to. Those seeking gods rejected you, and the lost king scorned you. You were infinitely weak in a world on the brink of destruction. That's why you spared me, who listened to your story."

Taesan whistled at Ghost's unfamiliar past. Ghost stiffened.

"I'm a monster. You're an adventurer. I only did what a monster should do. You won't resent me for it."

[Enough.]

Ghost said roughly.

"That's enough now. Just kill me."

"No."

[...What?]

Ghost was taken aback by Taesan's refusal. The ogre looked surprised.

"It's different from what I expected."

"What did you expect?"

"I thought you would act as a puppet, reaching this far as the puppet of the warrior's will."
"It was a fairly reasonable thought."

Ghost was the one who had descended deep into this place. If he stuck close to the novice, the novice would naturally have to follow Ghost's words.

Perhaps Ghost was aiming for that too. He simply changed his mind after observing Taesan's actions.

"That must be a fixed attack weapon."

"You know it well."

"Who did you get it from?"

[...Ah.]

Ghost realized belatedly.

A fixed attack weapon is very rare. It's equipment that can penetrate defense and skills, something you can't obtain on the 10th floor.

The ogre grinned broadly.

"So you've changed the warrior."

"Give me an answer."

"Can't you guess, warrior? There are many beings here who despise your arrogance and disdain for others. Not just gods, but adventurers too."

"Surely not."

In a trembling voice, Ghost responded.

"The guides of sin. They gave me the fixed attack weapon. They said if I didn't harm you, they would kill me, so I had no choice but to accept it."

"Those bastards!"

A rough voice echoed.
"Guides of sin."

That group was something even Lee Tae-yeon had heard of.

They were individuals who, more than any monster, zealously sought to kill her.

As Ogre smirked at the enraged Ghost, he spoke with a bitter smile.

"They must have been too afraid to deal with you themselves. That's why they had to borrow the hands of insignificant monsters like me. What do you think?"

[...]

Ghost breathed heavily without responding.

Ogre, nodding towards the surging emotions, said calmly.

"Do as you wish. I've said all I wanted to."

Ogre turned his gaze away from Ghost. As he briefly surveyed Taesan, he couldn't help but marvel.

"...I must have misspoken. You're not an adventurer who wavers before a warrior."

Taesan raised his sword.

Though there seemed to be a conversation between Ogre the sage and Ghost, Taesan, at least, didn't seem particularly interested.

Ogre spoke calmly, refraining from attempting to block or counterattack.
Here is the English translation of the text:

"I have survived here for a long time. Those weaker than me never came here in the first place, and those stronger than me were befriended through negotiation. It wasn't so difficult, given that it's only the lonely who are here. It's not because I want to die."

Thunk.

[50 damage to Ogre Sage.]

It pierces through the defenseless chest of the Ogre.

"But everything has its end."

The Ogre said without changing his expression.

"What do you think the moral of this story is?"

"Don't trust others?"

"That's one way to put it, but there's one core principle."

The Ogre said.

"Strength is the answer here. Have the kind of strength that no one dares to touch, let alone think about challenging."

The Ogre looked at the Ghost with bitter eyes.

"The hero couldn't do that. He was strong, but not strong enough to prevent them from having second thoughts. That's why they targeted his weaknesses. That's my advice."

"I'll do that."

"In that case, I'm glad. I'll wait for you to conquer this place and save us."

With a laugh, the Ogre Sage shook his head.

Something that seemed like a soul flowed down to the ground.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Your level has increased."
"Your Enlightenment has triggered. Permanently increases Strength by 2, Agility by 3, Intelligence by 10."
