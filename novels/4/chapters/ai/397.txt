**Chapter 398**

398. 80th Floor, Lion King (2)

"Uuuuuuuuu!"

A shout filled with anger bursts out.

The Lion King grips his sword tightly and charges forward, filled with rage and hatred. He swings his sword with all his might.

Taesan responds in kind. All sorts of buff skills are activated. The clash of swords creates a loud explosion.

"Kuuuuuuuuung!"

The powers collide. Taesan's stats are currently at 40,000, but despite being far superior to the Lion King, the Lion King is not easily pushed back.

"The power of Acularus."

It's not just his strength, but his speed has also been raised to the extreme.

The Lion King grips his great sword with both hands and takes a step forward.

"Kagagagak!"

The great sword has a long reach. It's advantageous to keep a certain distance and fight. The Lion King is making good use of this advantage.

His straightforward and powerful swordsmanship is overwhelming Taesan. It may look like there are openings, but upon closer inspection, it's clear that everything is a trap. If you try to take advantage of it, you'll end up getting countered.

"Uooooo!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Lion King let out a beast-like roar and swung his sword down.

[The Lion King unleashed all his power.] [You activated a strong attack.] [You activated acceleration.]

Taesan, however, did not back down and instead charged forward. With amplified power and speed, he clashed with the Lion King's great sword.

Kaah!

"Kkuueek!"

As a result, both of them were pushed back slightly. The Lion King gritted his teeth and readjusted his stance, then charged again.

His swordsmanship was rough but powerful, full of gaps but with no gaps. That was the Lion King's swordsmanship.

"You're strong."

His swordsmanship was almost perfect. It was comparable to the swordsmanship of the Storm Scar, and he had reached a higher level than Taesan. 

"But I'm stronger than you."

The opponent's main technique was swordsmanship, and he had already grasped what kind of swordsmanship it was. Taesan took a deep breath and raised his sword.

His movement was extremely smooth.

[You activated a slip-away technique.]

"Whoa!"

The Lion King's sword trajectory was disrupted. The Lion King quickly corrected his trajectory. Having already observed Taesan and other high-ranking officials' battles, he was familiar with the slip-away technique.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If I knew, it wouldn't be something I couldn't handle.

It was the moment when the Lion King was about to reveal his true self and counterattack.

A thick, dark magic flowed out from Taesan.

[You activated the Stormy Arrow of Bisago.]

A black line pierced the Lion King.

The Lion King reflexively raised his great sword. It was an instinctive action, like a beast descending into a labyrinth.

Thanks to that, his heart was not pierced, but his body was severely slammed against the wall.

[Lion King took 6,357 damage.]

"Ugh!"

[You summoned the Wind Spirit King, Minerva.]

"Minerva, attack."

"......A lot has changed without me noticing. I knew it!"

Minerva spoke strongly, unleashing a gust of wind.

The Lion King let out a roar, getting back up.

"How dare you! You're the Spirit King!"

"That's not something to be taken lightly! I'm the guardian of the world, after all!"

The wind and sword clashed. The wind was cut by the sword and disappeared, but it had withstood enough."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The summoning of the Spirit King is restricted by the summoner's power, but Taesan has now reached immortality.

With sufficient power and strength to consume, he was able to summon Minerva in her complete state.

[You activated Asmodeus's Corrupting Chain.]

The chain binds the Lion King, who tries to shake it off with his entire body but cannot easily escape.

[You activated Gaph's Solid Rock.]

The ceiling opens, and the rock falls.

The Lion King, enraged, pours all his strength into his entire body as the rock falls from almost zero distance.

[The Lion King activated the Monster's Power.]

Cha-ja-jak!

The chain breaks. The Lion King grasps his great sword with both hands and swings it wildly. The rock shatters and crumbles.

However, the Lion King was not unscathed. The falling fragments covered him.

"Aaah!"

[The Lion King activated Unstoppable Will.] [The Lion King activated Target Designation.]

The Lion King ignores the fragments and charges at Taesan.

He pierces through Minerva's wind with his body and attempts to thrust his great sword at Taesan.

Taesan looks at him and raises his finger."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the forced exclusion.]

Ku-u-u-ung!

A powerful shockwave envelops the Lion King, repelling him with a force that refuses to allow him to approach.

"Eeek!"

The Lion King's entire body is revealed, his veins bulging. He gathers strength in his legs and slowly approaches Taesan.

Before he knows it, he has reached Taesan's vicinity.

Just as he is about to draw his sword and strike with all his might, Taesan raises his hand.

"Good job."

[You have activated Naberiuse's golden sword.]

The Lion King's body crashes to the ground, his desperate determination and strength rendered meaningless. His body shatters like fragile glass, spreading out in all directions.

"……Uaaaaah!"

A scream erupts.

The contents of that scream were despair.

Taesan responded to it.

Magic and dark magic collide. With just that, the Lion King is unable to reach Taesan. Although his physical strength has increased significantly thanks to Acular's power, he is still on the brink of collapse.

"This can't... be... I...".

The Lion King had not relied solely on the power of the gods. He had prepared many things, recalling his battle with Taesan and taking precautions.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But it all meant nothing.

Taesan gazed at him calmly.

"I'm strong, but... that's all."

The Lion King had clearly surpassed mortality.

However, the realm he had reached by sacrificing himself was extremely distorted and unstable.

On the other hand, Taesan had transcended the realm based on his divine nature, and his pure power and experience surpassed the Lion King's.

There was an insurmountable gap between Taesan and the Lion King now.

"Farewell."

Taesan approached him, sword in hand. Fear filled the Lion King's eyes.

"N-no... I don't want to."

He stuttered and spat out the words.

His voice was filled with fear.

"No! No! No! Oh God, please save me! I beg of you!"

[Despicable.]

The ghost clicked its tongue.

It was a despicable being that had been stuck in the labyrinth for a long time.

The Lion King cried out to the heavens.

"I'll give up everything, please! Just let me escape from this place!"

Then, a laughter echoed.

Power flowed out from the altar, unaffected by the battle.

"Ah."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Lion King's face suddenly freezes.

The divine power within him violently amplifies.

"Sa, sa...".

It has devoured his ego, making it meaningless and erasing it. The Lion King has achieved his own desire to escape from this place. His ego and wisdom have been consumed by power, losing all meaning and disappearing.

[Acular's authority is revealed. As a result, Acular's interference domain decreases.] [Acular's servant loses his reason and wisdom.]

"Hmm."

[For a moment.]

Taesan stops in his tracks. The light in the Lion King's eyes has disappeared. Instead, a corresponding power is violently amplifying.

Even Taesan's current power is not to be underestimated.

[Enhanced trial? But I didn't receive this guy's consent!]

As soon as the ghost's words end, the system window alerts a warning.

[Enhanced trial proposal……@#!@$] [Acular's order collapse is triggered. Acular's interference domain decreases.]

The system window that was alerting the warning shatters.

The laws and order collapse.

"What?"

"I expected it, but it's really coming out like this."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The trial of Rakiratesu that I met on the 2nd floor. Rakiratesu forced a strengthened trial on Taesan without any consent. The ghost said it was extremely unfair and self-centered, and that other gods wouldn't do such a thing.

But in other words, it meant that other gods could also do it.

Not all gods favor Taesan. There must be gods who dislike him. I had expected that something like this would happen someday.

But things were different from the time of Rakiratesu.

The gods who currently favor Taesan are not few.

[Lucifer's Dark Mother is activated. Lucifer's interference domain decreases.]

Space opens, and the demon descends to the earth.

* * *

Power bursts out from Acuerus's altar. What's contained within is astonishment.

The black-haired girl steps into the labyrinth.

[I basically don't interfere with what happens inside the labyrinth.]

A clear voice rings out. The power of darkness gently envelops Taesan.

[Although I favor him, hardships and trials are all his own. If I intervene, it won't be good for either Taesan or me. But this is a different story.]

The demon laughs mockingly.

[Did you want to crush our expectations by using your authority, Acuerus? [……You.]

A voice rings out."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was filled with rage. It was a voice that took away the vitality of all things.

[How dare you interfere with me?]

Power explodes.

This is the sincerity of the Transcender.

Even the current Taesan cannot resist, it is the law itself.

The darkness of the Demon God collides. There is no wave of power, no loud noise.

[That's what I have to say. Don't you think you should at least follow the minimum rules?]

The Demon God laughed.

Anger was etched on his face.

[How dare you try to manipulate my beloved child?]

The magic wildly covers the world.

The light disappears, and the dark world is realized.

[He is my holy child. He may not be a saint, but he is a child I cherish. You must not cross the line. Let's keep the rules.]

The Demon God wiggled his finger.

[But I won't deny your actions themselves.]

Kuku kuku kuku.

The magic that had collapsed is revived. The system window appears in front of Taesan.

[Acularis offers you a strengthened trial.] [Under fair conditions, the trial is always just. It's up to the adventurer to accept it. What will you do, Taesan?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Mashin looked up at Taesan and asked. The confidence in his gaze was undeniable.

"I'll accept it."

Taesan replied.

Mashin's acknowledgment meant that the trial itself was just. Therefore, there was no reason to refuse. Mashin smiled as if he had expected it.

"That's enough. Let's meet again soon, Taesan."

With that, Mashin's body disappeared into the darkness.

Acularus felt frustration and anger.

However, he couldn't intervene any further. In the end, Acularus quietly suppressed his presence.

[Acularus's Trial: Defeat Acularus's sword.]

[Acularus's sword appeared.]

"A sword?"

A sword that was neither a vassal nor a servant.

Although it was the first time he had seen it, understanding its essence was not difficult.

Even the name "Sajawang" disappeared. What was left was only Acularus's authority, singular and unmatched.

Acularus's authority was distorted to manifest itself as a tool.

And to that extent, the power it contained was equivalent to Acularus's power itself.

But it didn't matter. For Taesan at this moment, it was not a problem.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The tool in the shape of a lion king moved its body. The sword moved, rushing towards the great mountain.

[Acular's sword activated its collapse.]

And everything collapses.

The walls of the labyrinth, shocked and shaken, begin to crack.

The great mountain is wrapped in divinity throughout its body.

A light so intense it's hard to open one's eyes envelops the labyrinth."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
