Chapter 408

408. 81st floor, Advanced Magic (7)

A vast, brown space unfolded before him.

Tai Shan was alone there.

The quest had been cleared. Now was the time to verify the obtained items.

[Magic] [Proficiency: 81%] [He can use magic efficiently. He can manipulate mana itself to use various auxiliary powers for magic.]

His magic proficiency had reached 80%.

It was likely that he could handle negative magic to some extent, thanks to his improved magic proficiency.

"19% left until 100%."

However, considering the example of divine power, it was unlikely that he would continue to rise from here.

At 80%, he had obtained new skills.

[Magic Circle] [Proficiency: 1%] [He can use various magic in the form of a magic circle.]

A truth is said to be self-evident. Tai Shan activated the magic.

[You have activated the frozen world's magic circle.]

Kiying!

A magic circle was drawn at Tai Shan's feet.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the magic circle, a chilly air circulated. It seemed to be capable of repelling approaching attacks and freezing enemies. "Has it been changed to a sustained form?"

The magic circle was installed in the shape of a magic circle, occupying the space. After continuously testing the magic circle, it seemed that it could be used simultaneously with three different forms. The possibilities for utilization were vast depending on the skill.

[Magic Interference] [Proficiency: 1%] [Can interfere with the opponent's magic.]

I was already aware of how to utilize magic interference.

Wida blocked the limited blink of the opponent's Tai Shan, making it difficult to approach. Thanks to this, I ate a lot of trouble.

It seemed that it could be used when the opponent tries to cast a spell. Although it may not be able to properly interfere with magic due to low proficiency, the value would greatly increase as proficiency rises.

[Memorize] [Proficiency: 1%] [Can record one's own magic in advance and cast it when needed. Currently, only three spells can be recorded.]

After reading the skill description, Tai Shan immediately tried it out.
Here is the translation of the text:

You have activated memorization. You have activated the frozen world. You have activated the starlight arrow. You have activated limited blinking.

After recording the magic, Tai Shan activated the recorded magic.

Zzzt!

As a result, the frozen world was implemented immediately without any skill activation window or mana wave.

Tai Shan's eyes sparkled.

The starlight arrow and limited blinking, which were activated later, were the same. It was probably because they were pre-activated, so no skill activation window appeared.

"It's fine."

You can use it immediately without any skill activation window. Since there is no mana wave, it will seem to others that you are handling magic without any prior warning.

Although you can only record three types of magic, it was still a useful ability.

And after overcoming the trials, Tai Shan obtained two intermediate-level magic spells.

[Intermediate Magic: Mana Storm]
[Consumed Mana: 1,000]
[Proficiency: 1%]
[Creates a storm made of pure mana.]

The consumed mana was the largest among the intermediate-level magic spells Tai Shan had obtained. Tai Shan expected such great power and gathered mana.

[You have activated the Mana Storm.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The mana bursts forth and is implemented in the world.

The mana, which had swirled around, became a storm and swept across the world.

Kaga kaga kaga!

The fierce mana storm swept away everything around it. The power contained within was as expected by the gods, extremely powerful. From a purely power-based perspective, it was the strongest of the intermediate magic spells possessed by oneself.

"It's a bit different."

The intermediate black magic, Jephar's black storm, summoned multiple small storms and had a profound impact on a wide area.

In contrast, the mana storm took the form of a massive storm and had a significant impact on a concentrated region. Both could be used for different purposes, so it wasn't bad.

[Shining Blue Barrier] [Consumed Mana: 900] [Skill Level: 1%] [Summons the Blue Barrier. Blocks the entry of entities with malice and repels all types of attacks.]

The Blue Barrier had the expected effect. After activation, a translucent barrier appeared over a wide range. According to the skill description, it seemed to defend against all types of attacks without distinction.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The skill seemed to be of great use when used after returning to the earth. 'It's good.'"

The value of the newly obtained magic was extremely high. If it were originally, I would have been greatly pleased, but now it was a different story.

Tae-san gazed at the skill window.

[High-ranking magic: Great Collapse] [Consumed mana: 5,000] [Proficiency: 1%] [Manipulates the nucleus that causes the collapse of all things.]

The consumed mana was unimaginably high.

5,000, which was about a quarter of Tae-san's mana. Although there were skills that reduced intelligence and mana consumption, it was still a vastly different consumption amount from what he had experienced so far.

"Hmm."

After confirming the high-ranking magic, Tae-san checked another skill that was just as important as the high-ranking magic.

[Negative Magic] [Proficiency: 1%] [A negative magic that combines the power of the gods and Jerbrand's magic to create a new magic.]

Negative Magic, created by Tae-san by opposing black magic and magic, had an absolute advantage in terms of synergy.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It was a certainty. Wiraed, who was unable to do anything except disrupt the trajectory with his intermediate magic, was able to neutralize his dark side. It was not an exaggeration to say that his power was equivalent to the authority of an immortal.

However, there was no small risk.

First and foremost, he needed to obtain absolute control over mana in order to use it.

The problem was that he couldn't get absolute control over mana, even with his current abilities. It was like treating mana like a slave, but he was still far from achieving that level.

Therefore, he had to use a partial world alteration on himself in order to handle dark magic.

Partial world alteration affects the world itself. It was possible to intervene in a way that limits one's own abilities or changes the environment for someone else, such as turning it into a negative environment. He had to give up that kind of ability in order to be able to handle dark magic.

It's clear that having an advantage in all aspects is a powerful ability, but partial world alteration was also a valuable ability.

Moreover, the amount of materials consumed when using dark magic was much larger than in other cases.

"'It's definitely useful, but.'

The conditions are demanding and the consumption is large, but the return is also large. A powerful card that cannot be easily used, that's what it was like."

Note: The text appears to be a passage from a fantasy novel or game, and it describes a character's ability to handle dark magic and the risks and challenges involved.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Do you mean you can't mix black magic with other powers?"

"I tried, but nothing worked."

The ghost asked, and Taesan answered. To mix black magic, it was necessary to blend it with other powers, but only magic could do so. In the case of black magic, it would actually become even more uncontrollable, trying to swallow even Taesan himself.

If we were to reach a higher level, it might be possible to combine magic with something else, but for now, it seemed that we could only combine it with the sacred.

Taesan finished his rough check and left the room.

As he walked down the corridor, he met some wizards who had been watching him. They stiffened and gazed at him with intense eyes.

Inside, there was admiration and awe.

And fear.

The battle between Taesan and Wiyard was watched by all wizards.

Taesan, who handled black magic, was interesting and surprising, but at the same time, it felt strange. In reality, none of the wizards, including Ellyana, approached Taesan after that.

"It's dull."

[He made a sound with his mouth.]

The ghost laughed.

Taesan walked down the corridor and arrived at a small room. He opened the door and entered.

"I'm here."

Wiyard was there.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he closed the mysterious book, he thought to himself, "Shall I depart now?"

"I've obtained everything I needed, so I'm all set."

After winning against Viora, Taesan did not immediately return to the labyrinth.

Viora said that he could stay here as long as he wanted, whenever he felt like leaving. This was in line with Jerbrand's intention.

Since there was no reason to refuse, Taesan stayed for a while, accumulating knowledge of magic and organizing the power he had gained.

However, this too was coming to an end. It was time for him to return to the labyrinth.

Taesan said to Viora, "Thank you. I've obtained a lot thanks to your help."

The dark magic had obtained hints from Viora's abilities. It was not an overstatement to say that Viora was the reason for this. Viora responded nonchalantly.

"You obtained what you could because of your own abilities, so there's no need to express gratitude to me."

Viora looked at Taesan for a moment.

"You're not a mage, are you?"

"Yes."

Taesan nodded his head.

He was not a mage who pursued magic and mystery. He was a brave adventurer who had acquired numerous abilities and grown stronger through his adventures.
Here is the translation:

I had admired Wyrad's magic, but as an adventurer, I thought it was more practical to use a shortcut to reach his level. Wyrad smiled quietly.

"Jerbrand said to me, 'I'll bring you into the Tower of Magic.'"

"Is that so?"

"But you don't belong in the Tower. Go back to where you belong."

"May I ask a question before that?"

"What is it? Ask away. I'll answer moderately."

"Your power."

Dimensional Break.

The power to create separate dimensions and handle points, lines, and surfaces.

It was a power close to a law. It was a high-level power, worthy of being called the power of an immortal.

I asked about it, and Wyrad replied.

"This is the Tower of Magic. It's an optimized space for handling magical powers. And I've prepared a few things for our confrontation. Thanks to that, I was able to handle the power that exceeded my qualifications."

Wyrad waved his hand. A black point quietly appeared.

"Dimensional intervention is clearly what I desire, but I can't handle it with this simple power yet. I'll get there someday, but it's impossible for now."

"That's right."

My curiosity was satisfied. Wyrad opened his mouth.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This time, don't ask me questions. You're an immortal. So, what's your power?"

What is your power?

Even Tai Shan himself was unsure. If pressed, it would be a spiritual ascension, but that was a power he had possessed even before he became an immortal. He couldn't call it the power of an immortal.

He didn't think it was divine either. It was a power that anyone could obtain by being revered by others.

Wu La replied, interpreting Tai Shan's silence differently.

"There's no need to say it. Power is the strength accumulated by an individual immortal. It's a secret in and of itself. Instead, don't ask about anything else. How did you handle the black color together with magic?"

"I don't know that either," he said.

He had obtained the black color through spiritual ascension and could use it to some extent from the beginning. That was all there was to it.

"It's amazing. Even within the laws, a being like you, who is an immortal, cannot control the power of the gods. But you not only control it, but also mix it with magic and use it."

Wu La looked at Tai Shan.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's as if their power is mixed into your foundation, isn't it?"

Wiwald's words flashed through Taesan's mind like a fleeting thought.

Wiwald shook his head.

"I'm curious, but you also don't know the answer, so don't worry about it."

"......Understood."

"Jerbrand's trial is over. Then, didn't he get the advanced magic?"

"Yes."

"Hmm."

Wiwald said with an interesting face.

"I've never seen Jerbrand's advanced magic myself."

"Is that so?"

"The mages who have taken up residence here have not been allowed to reach that level yet."

All the mages of the Tower of Magic have been recognized by the God of Magic and have entered this place.

They had talent and passion for magic.

However, none of the over 100 mages had been allowed to reach the advanced magic level.

The advanced magic had great value.

"I pursued my own magic, so I didn't learn advanced magic. I still think the same way, but I'm curious. How about trying it again?"

Note: I translated the text to the best of my abilities, but please note that the translation may not be perfect due to the nuances of language and cultural context.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan nodded his head. He also needed to confirm the power of the advanced magic. If Wira, the immortal, helped him, it would be almost certain. 

Before leaving, Tai Shan moved to the dueling arena with Wira to make a final confirmation.

Wira waved his hand and created hundreds of black dots.

"Then let's start. I'll respond if you cast advanced magic."

Tai Shan nodded his head and gathered mana.

[You have cast the spell of destruction.]

Advanced magic was implemented in the world.

At the same time, the energy condensed.

The space itself collapsed, and a terrifyingly powerful energy became a nucleus and began to manifest itself.

A black sphere appeared in front of Tai Shan.

"Ah."

Tai Shan let out a small sigh. A strong burden was imposed on his physical body.

Wira's face suddenly stiffened. He quickly swung his staff. Thousands of black lines shot towards the black sphere.

Tai Shan fired the sphere directly.

The nucleus of destruction charged towards the black lines.

Kuku, kuku, kuku!

"What's going on?"

Wira was shocked.

Although the black lines were neutralized by the negative magic, it meant that they possessed a power that could neutralize both the negative magic and the black magic mixed with it.
Here is the translation of the text:

The black lines were all torn apart and trampled upon.

The moment they touched, it shattered the power itself, making it disappear without a trace. Nevertheless, there was no tremor at all in the sphere.

Then, he hastily summoned a white dot. The small white dot and the black sphere collided, causing a rough vibration.

* * *

After all the confirmations were over, Tae-san returned to the marquise from the mountain.

At the moment he was about to return to the labyrinth, the space changed. The countless galaxies unfolded into a dark world.

[Was it to your liking?]

Zerbadin stood alone in the black space.
