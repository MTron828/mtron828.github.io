**Episode 269**

269. The Sword and Shield of the Spirit King (3)

The reward settlement has begun.

There were many things to check. Besides the reward for defeating the Spirit King's sword and shield, the reward for clearing the 60th floor had not been checked yet.

First, the stats change. The sword and shield had risen by 5 levels. With the effects of the spirit's rise and the thirst for victory, the increase was very high.

The detailed check could be put off for later. First, it was the skill.

[Special Passive Skill: Guardian's Fortitude] [The power of the guardian who protects the king. Reduces all damage received by 20%. This skill is activated after defense and defense skills are applied.]

"Hmm?"

A 20% reduction. A very high number. Now I understand why the damage was only in the hundreds when I didn't use the absolute judgment on Ha San.

"I would have been in trouble if I didn't have the absolute judgment."

There was a reason why it was called the king's shield.

And the skill obtained from the sword.

Here is the translation of the text from Korean to English:

[Special Activation Skill: Guardian's Barrier] [Consumes Mana: 200] [The power held by the guardian who protects the king, creating a barrier with one's own strength to suppress the opponent.]

I saw a barrier made of flames during the battle. It seemed like I had obtained it.

Looking at Minerva being shattered without mercy, it seemed that if the opponent had a certain amount of power, they could break the barrier. In other words, it was a skill that was only useful against weaker opponents.

"This is just so-so."

It wasn't a bad skill. If the opponent was far weaker than me, it meant I could avoid battle itself.

"There's no equipment..."

The armor, sword, shield, and spear that Hason had used, and the mysterious power that the spear had used.

I hadn't obtained any of those.

It was disappointing, but I accepted it calmly, as I had expected. The drop rate for equipment was extremely low, and they were all rare items. It was normal that I couldn't obtain them now.

But I will obtain them with my own strength soon.

Next, Taesan began to check the rewards he had not been able to check properly due to the battle with the shield and spear.

[You have reached the 60th floor. You have obtained the title "One who advances to the deep."]

Note: This appears to be a passage from a fantasy novel or game, and some terms may not have direct translations. I've tried to provide a natural-sounding translation that conveys the meaning of the original text.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

**You cleared the 60th floor perfectly. You obtained the title [One Who Has Seen a New Realm].**
**You cleared all floors up to the 60th floor perfectly. You obtained the title [Impossible Feat].**
**You have reached the deepest part of the labyrinth. This is a rare achievement in the long history of the labyrinth. The labyrinth praises your achievement and wishes for your success.**
**You obtained the title [One Who Has Reached the Entrance].**
**You obtained the special skill [Transformation].**
**Title: One Who Advances to the Deep**
**Goal: To reach an even deeper place**
**HP + 400, Strength + 200, Attack Power + 70, Defense + 70**
**Title: One Who Has Seen a New Realm**
**One Who Advances Further, with the Impossible in Sight**
**Strength + 200, Agility + 200, Intelligence + 200, Attack Power + 70, Defense + 70**

The other two titles were similar, but the abilities that increased were significantly higher than those obtained at the 50th floor.

Just this made the stats increase significantly. The labyrinth gave a clear reward to those who succeeded in conquering it, and the title was one of them.

"Status window."

[Name: Gang Tae-san]
[Level: 125]
[Shield: 4199/4199]
[HP: 53820/53820]
[Mana: 4280/4280]
[Magic: 659/659]
[Strength: 9651]
[Intelligence: 8361]
[Agility: 9115]
[Attack Power: +3175]
[Defense: +2022]
[Target is in the best condition.]

HP has finally surpassed Lee Tae-yeon's perfect score.

Attack power has also exceeded 3000. Slowly but surely, it's catching up.

And I obtained one skill. It seems to be a reward given by the labyrinth itself for reaching the 60th floor.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

**Special Active Skill: Transformation** **Mana Consumption: 1000** **Can adjust the values of attack and defense. The limit of adjustment is equal to the sum of attack and defense values. This skill can only be used once a week, and the values will return to their original state after the attack.**

Taesan, who was reading the skill description, stopped.

Taesan, who was staring blankly, asked.

"Is this what I think it is?"

**I don't know what you're thinking, but it's probably similar.**

The ghost replied.

**You can change the attack and defense values you have to whatever you want. With your current stats... your attack power can go up to 5197. However, your defense will become 0.**

"Huh."

Taesan laughed.

"Are you giving me this kind of skill too?"

**This is the 60th floor. Don't you think it's a bit too much to give away?**

The ghost's response was nonchalant. Taesan tapped his wrist with his finger.

**Transformation of attack and defense.**

The limit is the sum of his attack and defense values.

It wasn't an unrestricted skill. The mana consumption was 1000, and it couldn't be used again for a week after one use.

Moreover, the fact that the defense value would become 0 even if the values could be freely adjusted was a big problem. It was almost like giving himself a death sentence.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"But Taesan's story was different. He had absolute defense and endurance.

"Hmm."

Lee Taeyeon hadn't mentioned this skill before.

The reason was obvious. Conversion wasn't a significant skill for her, since she didn't have defense nullification.

She, who was quite fearful, wouldn't have felt the benefits of increasing her attack power at the cost of her defense.

It was likely that she didn't consider it important enough to mention to herself.

But for Taesan, it was an excellent skill. With simple calculations, 5197 plus the sword of determination, and the strong strike, he could deal nearly 40,000 damage without even using his golden sword.

And that wasn't all.

'With this... I might be able to get it more easily.'

The substitution of attack power.

The best part was that this was a trigger skill, and it could be reset with just one attack.

This characteristic could be a huge help in acquiring certain skills.

Special trigger skills, like multiplication.

There was still a long way to go. Considering the conditions for multiplication, there were still many skills to be acquired."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"But thanks to the transformation, I'll be able to get it faster than before.

Even if it's fast, it's a story after the depth, but it showed possibility. That one thing was enough.

And now, it was the clear reward for the 60th floor.

[Ankle Guard Blessed by a Nameless God] [+200 Strength] [+200 Agility] [+200 Intelligence] [+200 Defense] [+5% Action Speed] [A relic of a forgotten old god, a blessing bestowed upon those who believe in him, an ankle guard.]

It was a useful equipment that overall increased abilities.

[Black Earth's Soil] [A soil that has never seen light, feared by all existence. The soil, which has never been illuminated since its birth, has power in itself.]

Material item. When I thought of taking it to Halfuran, the ankle guard moved.

Shurruk!

It moved like a whip, stirring the soil. The soil came into contact with the ankle guard, and the power contained within was slowly sucked in."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"[Armguard of Malice.] [Armguard that wants to kill everything except its owner. Made by a witch's whim. There's still something hidden. It has absorbed the thorns of a red rose, the roots of a green vine, the leaves of a curse, and the soil of black earth.] [Attack power + 225] [Defense power + 100]

"Hmm..."

Attack power increased by 100, defense power increased by 90. It was a good change, considering I didn't have to replace my existing equipment.

The armguard was made by a witch's whim, and the black earth's soil was a reward from the 60th floor.

I absorbed that reward without any issues, which meant the witch's power was considerable.

'Am I immortal?'

I wondered again.

I finished checking the rewards. Minerva, who had been waiting quietly, raised her hand.

"Can I go back now?"

"Take a rest. You're reaching your limit, aren't you?"

Minerva nodded.

The king's sword was strong. She couldn't hold back her power either, so she had used up most of her energy needed for the descent.

It was time to go back and recover her strength.

"It's unfortunate... but I accept it. They made their choice. So did I."

Minerva stood up, brushing herself off.

"And the fact that they're here means we'll meet their owner soon, doesn't it?"

Taesan nodded.

**Window and shield. Directly under the king's command. Nothing exists between them.**

**In other words, it's the king's turn now.**

**"Well... how will this turn out?"**

**Minerva smiled faintly.**

**"I'm on your side, though. Cheer up."**

**With that, Minerva turned and left.**

**Taesan gazed at the spot where she had been, then moved his feet and headed down the stairs.**

**[This is the entrance to the deep part of the labyrinth.] [This place is getting closer to the abyss. Those who volunteer to be gatekeepers guard this place and test those who come.] [61st floor quest starts.] [Defeat the boss of the 61st floor and pass.] [Reward: Emperor's Ring.] [Secret reward: ???]**

**Finally, I've arrived here.**

**"Not much left."**

**Taesan walked towards the deepest part.**

* * *

**"Lost."**

**Guide of evil. Conference room of the headquarters.**

**The light of the two gems on the table disappeared. The face of the fiery woman contorted.**

**"Unfortunately, it's come to this, old lady."**

**"Shut up."**

**Ambrosia's words were met with a sharp retort from Vishnu. Her clenched fist on the table trembled with power.**

"Her window and shield. They had been with her since she entered the labyrinth, vowing unchanging loyalty, even unto death.

But those two died.

The flames are stirred by anger. The great magician clicks his tongue.

"This is beyond our expectations."

The king's shield. Hasan gave three deep-layered equipment to Hasan. They asked the demon for help, but they weren't sure if they would really be allowed to use it.

So they expected to win. The deep-layered equipment had enough power. They believed that those who couldn't reach it wouldn't be able to win.

But they lost.

The battle ended too quickly. It meant that their opponent was much stronger than they expected.

"I understand why you laughed."

The demon allowed the use of the deep-layered equipment with a subtle smile. They didn't know what it meant at the time, but they do now.

It was a ridiculing smile, implying "Is that enough?"

The Lion King spoke up.

"No matter what... he's coming here. And we're out of cards."

It was their turn to make a move.

The one who rose from the bottom had now caught up to their necks.

"One fortunate thing is that we're no longer stuck."

74th floor.

"How much time has been invested in this long journey. There were even leaders who died trying to break through.

Finally, they broke through.

They also have the possibility of growth now.

"But the best thing is to kill him before he arrives here."

"I'll do it."

Vishnu spoke harshly, and flames flickered.

"I'll go up and kill him."

"Calm down, Spirit King. We have no choice."

The Lion King said. In the end, the decision was up to the Demon King. If she didn't permit it, they couldn't fight him.

"First... we need to move our heavy butts slowly."

The guide's leaders, the strongest among mortals.

They began to take direct action towards the great mountain.
