Episode 382

382. 78th Floor, Library of the Heavens (7)

[Special Quest Start] [Return to Earth.] [One week from now. You will return to the land you left behind. Survive there and come back. The reward will be determined by your achievements.] [You cannot refuse this quest.]

The Return to Earth quest has started.

Taesan calmly closed the window.

When I opened the community, I saw different reactions from each country. Korean, Chinese, and Japanese players were nodding and starting to prepare. For them, it was a normal return speed since they had quickly returned to the labyrinth.

But other countries were different.

[Oliver Khan [Hard]: It's too fast... We haven't finished all our preparations yet.] [Daniel Darmont [Hard]: We're not mentally prepared yet, it's a bit confusing.]

For other countries, it took a considerable amount of time to clear the Earth quest. From their perspective, the return was too fast, so they couldn't help but be flustered.

However, they eventually accepted it and started preparing.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

There were no players who panicked at this level of variables. Everyone was a veteran who had experienced countless battles.

They exchanged information through the community and prepared for the return, one by one.

[Oliver Kan[Hard]: So, what's the scope of this return? Is it on a global scale?] [Gang Tae-san[Alone]: It's not global.] [Amelia Airin[Alone]: Oh.] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Ah, it's Tae-san.]

As soon as Tae-san appeared, there was a brief commotion. After the commotion died down, Tae-san posted again.

[Gang Tae-san[Alone]: It's still too early to go to the world.] [Oliver Kan[Hard]: That's true. Then, will it expand again this time?]

They had already met with other countries during the previous return, so they could easily infer.

[Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard]: Asia, Europe, Africa, and the American continent, perhaps?] [Daniel Darmon[Hard]: It's highly likely. The problem is that communication with other countries isn't working properly...]

They shared their thoughts with each other. They tried to exchange information with other countries, sending messages and making efforts to communicate somehow.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It seemed like it would take a long time, so Taesan shut down the community and moved his feet.

"Ah! You're here!"

Ainzhar welcomed Taesan with a smile.

"Are we going to spar again this time?"

Taesan nodded and drew his sword. Ainzhar also happily picked up his weapon.

Taesan regularly visited Ainzhar to request a spar. Since Leviathan's outbursts were not frequent, they could spar without any issues.

Each time, Horhe would grumble about how annoying it was, but it wasn't a big deal to Taesan.

Clang!

The swords clashed. Ainzhar laughed and struck down with his sword.

Clang!

A strong pressure crushed Taesan. Taesan twisted his sword and let it slip away.

[The proficiency of his sword slipping skill increased by 1%.]

Ainzhar was a monster.

The current Taesan was absolutely no match for the strong opponent.

And that's how you gain a lot when fighting someone like that.

The proficiency of many combat skills increased.

The proficiency of sense synchronization increased by 20%. His sense of the surroundings expanded, and he could grasp a much wider range than before, as if his hands could reach it."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The proficiency of buff skills, such as those that mock the strong, has also increased, allowing us to obtain even higher bonus values.

With swordsmanship alone, we couldn't counter Ainz's attacks, so we continued to use magic and dark magic as well. The proficiency of numerous skills, including magic overlap and magic release, has increased.

We can now handle the newly acquired magic and dark magic from the library of the gods with even greater proficiency.

[Middle-grade magic: Eternal Flame Bird] [Mana consumption: 400] [Proficiency: 4%] [Summons an eternal flame bird that attacks enemies, but its power is limited by the user's strength.]

This was a middle-grade magic of the fire element. Its basic power was similar to that of the frozen world, and it emitted an intense heat that was terrifying. It was a skill that could be used effectively under certain conditions.

[Middle-grade magic: Forced Exclusion] [Mana consumption: 500] [Proficiency: 5%] [Forces an opponent within a certain distance to retreat. This skill cannot be used for 10 minutes after use.]

Even Ainz was taken aback by its power, which was so great that it was almost palpable. Ainz was also impressed by its effect, which had no warning signs."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**Intermediate Dark Magic: Gaph's Solid Boulder** [Mana Consumption: 800] [Basic Mana Consumption: 350] [Proficiency: 3%] [Summons a boulder in Gaph's domain and drops it on the enemy. It has an unyielding solidity that cannot be damaged, but it is significantly weakened during the summoning process.]

Literally, it's a large and solid boulder that is quickly dropped on the opponent. It's simple but has a certain power, so it seems like it would be used often.

**Intermediate Dark Magic: Astaroth's Dark Absorption** [Mana Consumption: 400] [Basic Mana Consumption: 300] [Proficiency: 3%] [Calls upon the darkness scattered in Astaroth's domain and wraps it around one's body. It greatly reduces the power of most attacks.]

A defensive dark magic. It reduces damage by about half. Although the duration is short, there are no restrictions on movement, making it useful in certain situations.

All of these skills were usable. Originally, they would have required a lot of practice to master, but thanks to Ainzhart, I was able to quickly raise my proficiency to a level where I could use them in real combat.

And among them, the most notable one was the Iraque martial art.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Top-tier Skill: Ayrac Martial Arts] [Proficiency: 60%] [A technique that manipulates weapons and the body. With mastery, there is no loss of power transmission, and it can slightly affect the numerical values of attack and defense. Even with a newly acquired weapon, it can be wielded like one's own limbs.]

With the proficiency of Ayrac Martial Arts reaching 60%, the ability to wield a weapon like one's own limbs has been added.

I took out the scythe I obtained as a secret reward and tested it, and it was able to respond to Ainz's attacks to some extent. At this level, it can be used in actual combat.

"Have you already reached 60%? You're really fast."

Ainz laughed and praised Taesan.

"With your skills, you might be able to reach 100% someday. Are you satisfied?"

"It's overflowing."

The top-tier skill that integrates the attack power of all equipment, Ayrac Martial Arts.

It was one of the most valuable skills I obtained in my previous life. Thanks to this skill, I was able to overcome all sorts of difficulties.

I was amazed by how I possessed such a skill back then, but now I know. Ayrac Martial Arts was completed by Ainz. For an immortal like him, creating a skill of this level wouldn't be difficult.

After the training was over, Taesan told Ainz that he would have to return to Earth in a week and might be away from this place for a long time."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In that process, there was also a story about gods descending to the earth. Ainzhahr had a surprised expression.

"That's amazing. Gods and demons making a deal? That's extremely rare."

"Is that so?"

"Basically, they are beings that are perfectly opposed to each other. They instinctively hate each other. For them to make a deal... it means that there must be a great value there."

Ainzhahr looked at Taesan.

"And that's because of you, isn't it?"

Taesan didn't deny it. He was also aware of it.

Ainzhahr touched the hilt of his sword.

"I'm extremely grateful to you. Thanks to you, I can have hope that I thought was impossible. But... I have a lot of questions."

The gaze Ainzhahr directed at Taesan contained only one thing: a question.

"What is that power, anyway?"

While explaining the reason why he gained the power of the demon king, Ainzhahr also talked about the ascension of the spirit. Ainzhahr was one of the strong among the immortals, so it was believed that he would know something.

However, Ainzhahr also couldn't explain about the ascension of the spirit.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I've searched every corner of the world to find the goddess. Literally, I've searched hundreds, thousands of worlds in the universe. In the process, I've seen many abilities, but none of them had the same power as yours."

"The power of the gods cannot be possessed within the bounds of the law. It's because it's a power that transcends the law."

"The ascension of the divine has stolen the power of the gods."

"And to think that it's mixed with divinity to create a new power, and even control it."

"Taesan, who is not even a true immortal, has accomplished something that even the gods at the pinnacle of the universe cannot do."

"Why haven't you transcended yet, despite having such power? Why are you still trapped in the confines of your physical body?"

Ainzhar continued to ask questions, but it was more like he was reflecting on himself rather than seeking answers.

"Taesan."

Ainzhar gazed quietly at Taesan.

"What kind of realm have you reached?"

* * *

After the conversation with Ainzhar, Taesan wandered around the library of the universe. With only a week left, he didn't want to waste any more time.

"I think I've found everything I need to find."
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$The room of secrets that he had found was a total of twenty-five. This was exactly the same number that Iteawon had found. Despite her numerous attempts, she had not been able to discover the rooms of secrets that she had not found.

Given the circumstances, Taesan could only rely on time and intuition, and he had no other methods at his disposal.

He asked Horhe if it was possible to obtain the secret reward of the floor even if he couldn't find all the rooms of secrets.

"You can get it even if you find just one. It's strange that you're trying to find several," Horhe had said with a fed-up face. In fact, the ghost didn't even know that there were rooms of secrets in this place, so it wasn't strange.

He could easily obtain the secret reward. There was no reason to invest more time in finding more rooms of secrets.

However, Taesan had a strange feeling.

His intuition told him that there was still something important left. Taesan kept looking at the bookshelves.

Since it was a simple labor that only required time investment, he was mentally at ease. Taesan recalled Ainshter's last words.

'The state of enlightenment.'
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan knew that he was unusual.

He wielded the immense power of the gods, which even they couldn't handle. He felt a mental burden, but unlike the goddess, he didn't become corrupted and destroyed.

His spiritual power had even stolen the authority of the immortals.

However, he was a mortal. Although he had become strong and limitedly immortal, everything he had done was during his mortal days.

Where had he arrived?

That was also a question to him.

Taesan recalled the memories of the gods' mortal days, which he had obtained from the celestial library.

The god of victory, Baltazar, had constantly gambled with his life during his mortal days.

He had challenged the elves with archery, the giants with strength, the dwarves with crafting, and humans with strategy.

He had wagered with every living being in the world.

What he always put on the line was his own life.

And in all those battles, he had used every possible method to win without a single defeat.

After winning against all living beings, Baltazar became the god of victory.

Note: Baltazar is a name that seems to be inspired by the biblical figure of Belshazzar, but it's not a direct reference. It's likely a fictional character in the context of this story.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The god of struggle and death, Rakiratas, was born in a world where eternal war unfolded.

He always had death by his side and fought to survive.

After crossing numerous battle lines and gaining immense power, he ended the eternal war.

With the struggle and death coming to an end, peace finally arrived in the world.

And Rakiratas, who had brought peace to the world, started a war again.

In the end, he became the god of struggle and death, bringing eternal struggle and death to the world.

The other gods were not much different. They all went crazy for one thing, sacrificing everything, and in the end, they gained their own domain.

The only exception was Lucifer, the demon god created by the demon tribe to chase away the old gods.

Then, what was he obsessed with?

The answer didn't come easily.

Taesan continued to think and searched for the secret room. As a result, he was able to find what he was looking for.

Click!

Rustle...

It was a bookshelf filled with magical books. When he pulled out several books, the bookshelf itself moved.

[You found it again... You're really amazing.]

The ghost stuck out its tongue.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan stretched out his hand towards the passage.

As the ripple spread softly and simultaneously, Taesan felt the gaze directed at him.

Taesan, who had read the energy contained within, could sense who the owner of this place was.

"The God of Magic, Zelvand."

[The Secret Room of the God of Magic.] [You cannot enter unless the God permits it.]

Zelvand gazed quietly at Taesan.

With a small chuckle, the power of the passage disappeared.

Taesan entered the room.

In the vast room, only a small book was floating in the air.

Taesan grasped the book. He didn't have high expectations. He thought he would just get another intermediate-level magic.

But the system window that appeared surprised him.

[You have obtained the advanced magic, the Tome of Great Destruction.]

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
