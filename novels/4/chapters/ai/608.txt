**Episode 609**

609. Easy Mode. Third Return (3)

He had a considerable number of skills.

In fact, he had more skills than hard mode players.

The problem was that he didn't know how he had obtained those skills.

When acquiring a skill, the system window would inform him of the conditions to clear, but since he had obtained them in extremely urgent situations, he didn't have the time to pay attention to that.

[Special Passive Skill: Expanded Vision] [Proficiency: 14%] [Allows for a wider field of vision, still within human range.]

Expanded Vision. A skill that allows for a wider field of vision.

Taesan rummaged through his memories and recalled obtaining it around the 20th floor.

"How did I get it?"

He remembered being separated from other players by a monster and escaping from there, which was when he obtained it.

And Cold Judgment. He remembered obtaining it on the 2nd floor. He had naturally acquired it while fighting monsters.

"It's not helpful at all."

"I couldn't grasp the condition.

Taesan, who had taken a deep breath, recalled the skills he had recently acquired.

[Special Passive Skill: Insight] [Proficiency: 5%] [Can grasp many things. For now, it seems to only reveal the weaknesses of living creatures.] [Special Active Skill: Evasion] [Mana Consumption: 5] [Proficiency: 11%] [Reduces damage by evading the center of the attack. It seems possible to evade attacks from all weapons.]

Insight and Evasion.

Both were skills he had obtained while facing Choi Jung-hyuk's group.

He had to face hundreds of easy mode players alone. They were determined to kill Taesan and charged at him with all their might. They dug traps, used other easy mode players as bait, and ganged up on him.

He literally overcame countless crises of death.

In the process, he was able to acquire Insight and Evasion.

'Evasion was probably obtained when I faced five people.'"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They suddenly attacked Taesan, who was trying to supply them, and started fighting with swords, dodging, and blocking. In the process, they obtained a hint.

"Is this something you get in an extreme situation?"

But it couldn't be seen that way. When they obtained calmness, it wasn't in an extreme situation.

"There's a part that I can guess, though."

Taesan, who was worried, opened a community.

[Taesan[izi] : Taeyeon.] [Taeyeon[alon] : Oh, yeah? Why?]

The community responded quickly, and Taesan asked her.

[Taesan[izi] : How did you get the insight?] [Taeyeon[alon] : Uh... just a moment.]

Taeyeon, who was searching her memory, spoke up.

[Taeyeon[alon] : That weird old man. I think I got it when I was dealing with that guy.] [Taesan[izi] : The guy you met on the 1st floor?] [Taeyeon[alon] : Yeah!]

Taeyeon vented her anger.

[Taeyeon[alon] : That damn old man! He suddenly swung his fist and left, disappointed! What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything! I'm the victim!] [Taesan[izi] : He's a completely useless, mannerless old man with no consideration.]

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan cut off her words. It was a complaint he had heard hundreds of times before. He already knew what she would say next.

[Taesan [Iji]: Do you remember exactly how you got it?] [Ityeon [Alone]: Uh... I think I got it when you punched me?]

Taesan scowled at Ityeon's response.

[Taesan [Iji]: Is that it? Didn't you react or respond when you saw the punch?] [Ityeon [Alone]: I just stood still?]

Ityeon's response was different from what Taesan had expected. One of them was mistaken. Either Taesan was misjudging, or Ityeon was misremembering.

Taesan asked another question.

[Taesan [Iji]: What skills do you have?]

Ityeon answered readily.

Battle avoidance.

Escape.

Path to survival.

Single calculation.

Rear ambush.

Most of them were skills to avoid battle or hide.

It reminded Taesan of Ityeon's combat style. She always targeted the monsters' backs on Earth.

She avoided head-on battles, dodged, and ambushed.

When asked about the situation in which she acquired the skills, they were all skills obtained while avoiding enemies or ambushing from behind.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan called other players with skills to share their stories.

They weren't much different from Taeyeon. They acquired skills that fit their personalities.

Taesan shut down the community.

"'It's about acquiring skills based on combat style.'

Do you fight monsters head-on?

Or do you use teamwork?

Or do you attack from behind?

Players unfolded various battles and acquired skills similar to their own style.

"No, it's not about combat style being a limited condition."

The path Taeyeon had for living was a skill to determine the possibility of survival, unrelated to combat.

It's about what each person can achieve because of who they are. Taesan can do it because he's Taesan, and Taeyeon can do it because she's Taeyeon.

That's what a skill is.

The inference was complete.

And that was the correct answer.

The wizard hoped that adventurers would use the system of the labyrinth to become stronger. They wanted them to descend into the labyrinth in their own way and acquire their own power.

A skill is something you can achieve because of who you are.

Polish yourself, and acquire your own skill.

That's the message the wizard sends to adventurers.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even those who have reached the depths cannot easily grasp the secrets of the labyrinth, but Taesan has succeeded in uncovering them.

'No way.'

However, Taesan erased the completed inference from his mind. It wasn't because he thought it was wrong.

'This won't do.'

As Kang Taesan, if he could obtain it, the limit was too clear.

In the end, it means that he can only obtain the skills that he can get in easy mode, doesn't it?

Even if he tries to get stronger, he can't reach hard and alone modes.

So, let's dig a little deeper.

The magician starts to dig into unexpected places.

'A skill is something that a person can obtain because of who they are.'

For a warrior who advances boldly, there is the warrior's skill.

For a thief who hides their body and targets the enemy's back, there is the thief's skill.

Then, how does that judgment work?

It's not that you can get a skill just by acting like a warrior. It's about what actions you take in a given situation and condition.

'Lee Tae-yeon got the escape skill.'

He obtained it because he turned his back on the enemy during battle and ran away."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What if I didn't turn my back and instead charged forward? What would have happened then?

The answer was already there.

[Special Activation Skill: Acceleration] [Mana Consumption: 5] [Proficiency: 3%] [Accelerates towards the target.]

When I performed an action similar to the skill's effect, I acquired the skill.

I probably got it by dodging the attacks of easy-mode players during combat.

'There's a difficulty level to acquiring it.'

I got the 'Escape' skill on the 1st floor, but Taesan got the 'Acceleration' skill only after reaching the 50th floor. Even after fighting countless battles against enemies, that was the case. The difficulty level of acquiring the skill was definitely there.

The better the skill's effect, the more stringent the conditions are.

So, what if I artificially fulfill the skill's conditions?

If I endlessly flee from a sufficiently strong enemy, can I acquire the 'Escape' skill?

If I keep stabbing the enemy's back, can I acquire the 'Backstab' skill?

If I defeat a strong enemy solely through ambushes, what skill will I acquire?

If what I can acquire through my own abilities is a skill, then...

If I change myself, can I acquire a different skill?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If I only act to acquire skills, then I'll become like that. What kind of skills can I obtain?

It's not that I become strong by getting stronger, but I get stronger by acquiring skills.

I reverse the order of cause and effect.

My thoughts don't stop and accelerate. Even if a whole day passes, the mountain doesn't budge.

Those who enter the labyrinth are the strong ones.

They believe in their own talent and power. The labyrinth's system is only a supporting tool.

So, they didn't delve deeply into skills. They thought it was just a byproduct of their own strategy, something they could obtain through their own means. Even the magicians thought that was the right direction.

But Taesan is a forced weakling.

He's trapped in this irregular mode and can never become strong.

He uses the labyrinth's system, not as a means to get stronger, but as a goal in itself.

That's an irregularity that even the magicians didn't expect.

"......Let's try it."

Taesan stood up from his seat.

* * *

Taesan descended into the labyrinth.

[The Black Wolf appeared.]

What appeared was a black wolf."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's twice as big as a normal wolf. The wolf is on high alert, wary of its surroundings.

A 54th-floor monster. It wasn't a monster that posed a great threat to Taesan. He had become incredibly strong after fighting numerous easy-mode players.

If it were the old Taesan, he would have stabbed the wolf in the neck right away.

But the current Taesan was different.

Taesan drew his sword and cracked his knuckles.

"Bring it on."

[Grrr!]

The wolf charged. Its sharp teeth and claws were on full display.

Taesan quickly dodged. The wolf's claws swiped through the air, barely missing him.

[Grrr!]

The wolf didn't stop. It recklessly lunged its head and tried to pin Taesan down.

And Taesan dodged all of its attacks.

He carefully avoided making physical contact with the wolf.

"The skill of the labyrinth is obtained when the conditions are met."

What Taesan was aiming for now was a combat evasion technique similar to Lee Tae-yeon's.

But it was more than that.

He was aiming to perfectly dodge the wolf's attacks while being completely unarmed.

That was his current goal."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I dodge, dodge, dodge. The wolf's attack doesn't even allow his clothes to be touched.

[Grrr, grrr.]

An hour later, the wolf is exhausted and can't move anymore.

But Taesan hasn't acquired any special skills.

"Is this not enough?"

He dodged perfectly for an hour. According to his reasoning, he should have acquired a skill, but the system window remained eerily silent.

He doesn't get shocked by the fact that he failed. He had predicted that he would fail countless times anyway.

"Is the difference in power the problem?"

Taesan, who was analyzing calmly, suddenly burst out laughing.

"It's impossible."

[Keheng!]

Taesan takes out his sword and deals with the wolf, then moves on to the next room. A new wolf immediately charges at Taesan.

Taesan holds his sword and looks at the wolf. Unlike before, he doesn't dodge right away. When the wolf's claws get close to his fingers, he finally moves his body.

Just a little, barely avoiding the attack.

[Kuheng!]"

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The wolf moves swiftly. It bares its teeth. Taesan dodges again, feeling the wolf's breath just out of reach.

Unlike before, Taesan doesn't dodge directly, but instead maintains a distance where the wolf's breath can reach and dodges.

Taesan reads the movement of the wolf's muscles through its fur.

Taesan analyzes the trajectory of the wolf's gaze and predicts the future.

"You're doing something stupid."

What Taesan wants is a skill that can surpass easy mode. It's a skill that transcends a certain line. It's not something that can be obtained by dodging normally.

To obtain the power to transcend, one must also perform an action that transcends.

[Rrraaahh!]

The wolf howls and charges. Taesan doesn't flinch, watching until the wolf is close, then takes a step back. The wolf's claws brush against Taesan's hair.

This wasn't a dodge to defeat the enemy and move forward.

It was a dodge solely to acquire a skill.

Not to temper oneself, but to receive a reward through hardship.

Taesan continues to move their body.
