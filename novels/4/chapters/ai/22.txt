23. 2nd Floor, The Buried. Ghost of a Warrior (8)

Did Itaeyeon mention named monsters?

I can't recall. It was one or the other.

Either he forgot, or Itaeyeon never encountered them.

If the latter, it means she avoided them. Taesan slaughtered the goblins.

Atlock. Genesis.

They looked similar to other goblins in basic appearance. Wearing longswords, they kept their distance from Taesan, wary and on guard.

Two pairs of sunken eyes focus endlessly on Taesan. Just from this, it's clear. They are much stronger than other goblins.

"Shall we test it out?"

Taesan charges. The goblins begin to move. They spread out from each other, trying to surround Taesan.

If it moves like that from over there, the action that Taesan can take is simple. Taesan takes out his staff as he continues to run.

[You activated Fireball.]

A fireball shoots towards the goblin referred to as Atlock. Atlock hurriedly dodges the body. Because of that, the surrounding to Taesan breaks down and only one Genesis is exposed.
Taesan swung his sword downward.

Crash!

Genesis blocked with his sword. Taesan adjusted his posture and struck down in a precise stance. Taesan lunged to the left to evade and thrust upward. Genesis moved his sword.

Clang!

The upward thrust blade glanced off the sword edge. It wasn't a reckless swing but a proper use of the sword. Genesis swung his sword. Taesan raised his shield.

Crash!

The shield pressed against it. The force felt from the meeting swords was quite strong.

[You received 7 damage.]

"Quite something?"

It matched the speed and strength typical of a goblin's abdomen. There was a reason he was an elite goblin.

But still, Taesan had the upper hand. He exerted force into the hand holding the shield.

Thud!

"Kick!"

Genesis was pushed back. Instead of charging forward, Taesan pivoted and swung his sword downward. Atlock, aiming for his back, desperately blocked.

Thud!

"Crack!"

Atlock's knee buckled. He gritted his teeth to withstand it, but the sword slowly pressed down. Genesis shouted and charged.

"Crack!"
Taesan attempted to push him back with his shield, but the opponent didn't budge easily. Eventually, Taesan had to take a step back.

"Crack."

"Kick."

The goblins didn't come closer. Their vigilance towards Taesan intensified.

They changed their tactics. Instead of targeting Taesan's vulnerabilities, they complemented each other's weaknesses. Atlock and Genesis charged simultaneously.

He blocked Atlock's attack. Then Genesis came at him. Just as he tried to deflect both attacks and push them away with force, they instinctively distanced themselves. And then they charged again.

Clang!

The swords clashed, shields moved. Intense swordsmanship ensued. A slight sense of admiration crossed Taesan's face.

"Perfect?"

Atlock and Genesis. The combination of the two elite goblins left no openings. Whenever he tried to push one aside and target the other, they countered together fiercely, making it difficult to focus on either one.

The abilities of elite goblins were formidable as well. Taesan found it challenging to face both simultaneously.

He had to take down one first.

So, he braced himself for the inevitable losses.

[You have activated Breathless Attack. You gain freedom of breath for the next 12 seconds.]

Thud!

"Crack!"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

He knocks aside Genesis's weapon and rushes towards Atlock. Genesis immediately charges towards his back but he ignores it.

"[You have triggered Evade. The next attack is evaded.] [You receive 12 damage.]"

Ignoring the pain, he swings his sword heavily. Atlock's arm rises into the air. Taesan swings his sword towards Atlock's exposed torso.

At that moment, a sensation warns him.

"[You have a strong premonition.]"

One warning. This attack is sure to fail. Taesan barely manages to restrain his strength according to his intuition. The sword stops in front of Atlock's head.

And then Taesan's pupils dilate at the sight of the spear that followed.

"[Atlock has triggered Evade. The next attack is evaded.]"

"What?"

"Kick!"

Atlock swings his sword towards Taesan, and Genesis behind his back does the same. He's surrounded. Taesan quickly rolls on the ground. The sword strikes the floor.

Having escaped from the goblins, Taesan burst into a bitter laugh.

"What's going on?"

He wasn't mistaken. The system window still lingered in the corner of his vision.

"[Atlock has triggered Evade. The next attack is evaded.]"

The window that had appeared when players used skills.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

That was also indicated to the goblins.

* * *

"Kaak!"

The goblins charge. Atlock aims for the left, while Genesis targets the right.

Taesan runs to the right. Ignoring the evaded Atlock, he tries to aim for Genesis, but Genesis does the same.

"[Genesis has triggered Evade. The next attack is evaded.]"

"Damn."

Taesan kicks backward.

It's certain. These goblins are using skills.

"Kaak!"

"Kieeek!"

The goblins now charge fiercely unlike before. Seeing their disregard for defense, Taesan realizes one more fact.

Evade is a skill that definitely dodges the opponent's attack. It allows for attacks to be made without defense.

The goblins were fully aware of the effects of the skills they used. It wasn't something they acquired overnight.

"Are all those with names like this?"

With an unsettled expression, Taesan swings his sword.

Thunk!

"Clang!"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

Geneši, who was pushed back by force, bounces off. Taesan knocks Atlock's weapon away with his shield. As his mind is solely focused on attacking, he cannot smoothly evade like earlier. He flies far away.

Taesan kicks backward and draws his bow. Thanks to his increased agility, he manages to shoot two arrows before the goblins can charge again.

"[6 damage to Geneši.] [7 damage to Atlock.]"

"Kaak!"

"Kieeek!"

Arrows graze and brush past the goblins. This won't be easy. The goblins momentarily hesitate.

"Kieeek."

"Kaak......"

Seeing the hesitant goblins, Taesan raises his sword grimly.

"They're nothing special. Judging by their appearance, it seems like they can only use their skills once. If that's the case, it's simple."

"You have triggered Evade. The next attack is evaded."

Just like the goblins did, Taesan triggers Evade and rushes forward. The first attack inevitably misses. The goblins cannot attack recklessly and fumble around. In that moment, Taesan arrives before Atlock.

Swish!

"Kaak!"

Taesan's sword strikes down.

Atlock desperately blocks, but the difference in strength is too great.

Geneši tries to attack belatedly, but it's too late.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

Due to the slip-up, the attack is diverted and Taesan raises his sword again.

"Jjeong!"

Atlock's sword shatters. He thrusts his sword into the goblin whose defenses have vanished.

"[You have triggered Continuous Attack. You attack twice in the next round.] [Atlock is incapacitated. The damage is more severe.] [39 damage to Atlock.] [40 damage to Atlock.] [You have defeated Atlock.] [Your evidence of struggle has activated.]"

"Kaak!"

Geneši, filled with anger at losing a comrade, shouts. Instead of turning back, Taesan triggers a skill.

"[You have triggered Counter. You retaliate against the next opponent's attack.]"

His body moves automatically. He narrowly avoids Geneši's attack and pierces his chest.

[46 damage to Geneši.]

"Kuk, kuk."

He bends Geneši a few more times in agony.

[18 damage to Geneši.] [17 damage to Geneši.] [You have defeated Geneši.] [Your evidence of struggle has ended.]

"That was easy."

Taesan neatly finishes.

He had always said that the players were all allies. But there was always an exception.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

Those who rampage without knowing their own subjects.

Those who try to control with superficial power.

Players in easy mode who believe guilds are everything in their narrow well.

Taesan has dealt with them.

He knew all about the weaknesses of any skill and how to exploit them.

Though surprised by the fact that monsters use skills, the skills themselves were not scary at all.

"Do named ones use skills too?"

Elite monsters wouldn't just be goblins. Orcs, skeletons. Most named monsters probably use skills.

"It shouldn't be too difficult."

If the elite goblins had coordinated and fought each other instead of relying on skills, it would have taken quite some time.

But if the opponent relied on skills, knowing all the countermeasures made it easier for him.

Taesan confirmed the reward.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

[Your Inspiration Rise has been activated. Strength permanently increases by 1. Agility permanently increases by 1. Intelligence permanently increases by 1.] [Your Inspiration Rise has been activated. Strength permanently increases by 1. Agility permanently increases by 1. Intelligence permanently increases by 1.] [Received 458 gold.]

Perhaps because it was a generally exceptional monster, the Inspiration Rise also increased overall. Taesan, who was about to skip over as usual, paused.

"Oh."

[Your Inspiration Rise has been activated. Fumble Mastery increases by 3%.] [Your Inspiration Rise has been activated. Fumble Mastery increases by 3%.]

Skill mastery has increased.

"Since it's someone who uses skills, are they also taking this away?"

Inspiration Rise takes away the strength of the deceased. Its scope is not limited to just stats. It was natural to take away skill mastery when killing enemies who use skills.

It was surprising but good. Raising mastery is quite difficult. Taesan checked Fumble.

[Special Trigger Skill: Fumble] [Mana Cost: 5] [Mastery: 42%] [Reduces damage by deflecting attacks. Seems capable of deflecting attacks with any weapon. Might also work against magic or curses.]

This translation captures the essence and details of the original Korean text.
Here is the translation of the Korean text into English:

---

As I frequently used it, its proficiency steadily increased, and thanks to the rise in Inspiration, it surpassed 40% and its content changed. The additional description involved evading magic and curses.

It was quite good. There are magic spells that cannot be dodged. Since it can only be dealt with using equipment or skills, evading was a skill that could do just that.

Curses could also be evaded to reduce their effects, which was satisfying enough.

Unfortunately, there was no equipment. If it were armor worn by goblins, it seemed to have about 4 defense, which was regrettable. It couldn't be helped with just this issue of probability.

"This is pretty good."

Consecutive attacks. A skill acquired when fighting with the species of Laki Lattas. It was quite useful when I tried it for the first time.

[Special Trigger Skill: Consecutive Attacks] [Mana Cost: 3] [Proficiency: 1%] [Use the next attack twice. Not restricted by time or space.]

It was what they call a copy. It leaves a trace with each attack, causing damage twice.

Unlike copying, the effect of the skill is not copied. After activating addition and multiplication, using consecutive attacks only resulted in meager basic attack power, which is why Taesan discarded the skill.

But now, Taesan was a player in the Alone Mode.

Here is the English translation of the text:

---

Basic attack power will also increase in the future, so there will be much use for it. Mana consumption is relatively low, around 3.

Simple verification was over. Taesan arrived at the tomb with a puzzled expression.

"What's this?"

Goblins were guarding this place. Seeing two elites, it seemed to be quite an important place. Taesan recalled the system window.

[You have discovered the warrior's tomb.] [First discovery bonus] [Intelligence has permanently increased by 1. Mana has permanently increased by 2.]

He hadn't realized earlier, but he had received a first discovery bonus as well. It meant something important, like the Spring of Life or the altar of Laki Lattas.

Taesan placed his hand on the tomb. White mist rose up.

The mist gathered and formed into a shape. It wasn't in the form of a human.

"A ghost?"

The image that people first think of when they think of ghosts on Earth. It formed into a shape wearing a white cloth over its head.

The ghost spoke.

"Hello! Adventurer!"

The ghost turned into mist and dispersed.

"And farewell!"

"..."

Taesan placed his hand on the tomb again. The ghost appeared.

"Hello! Adventurer! Farewell!"

And then disappeared again.
Taesan's face contorted.

He raised his hand. The ghost appeared.

"What are you doing? I told you to go."

"Give me a quest."

"Oh, this. This. Dare you ask me for a quest? Do you know who I am?"

"Who are you to dare speak to the fallen warrior?"

Taesan already knew the ghost's identity from the system window. Whether rendered speechless or momentarily silent, the ghost muttered.

"It's become quite comfortable. No need to walk on your own or risk your life to gather information, the system tells you everything. How convenient."

"There was no system in the previous labyrinth?"

"No. There was, wasn't there?"

"... You're quite picky."

The ghost grumbled. Taesan looked at him suspiciously.

"What's this now?"

None of the NPCs he'd met were ordinary. Whether dwarves or Ainzhar, there was an inexplicable weight about them. But this one was endlessly light.

NPC. And ghost. The dead. They cannot interfere with the living. That's one thing.

"Aren't you going to give me a quest?"
Even in Easy Mode, there were ghost-like things. There, the quests were not with NPCs but were like diaries, yet they were similar to something of the dead.

Quests fulfilling the wishes of the deceased by reading things like diary contents. The ghost in front of him probably isn't much different. Muttering as if the ghost was vague.

"What a strange guy. Asking for a quest out of the blue? Isn't the 2nd floor an area you wouldn't know well?"
