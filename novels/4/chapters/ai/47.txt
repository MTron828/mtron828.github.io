48. 8th Floor, God of Trials. Hubris (2)

[Fourth trial passed. Agility increases by 2 as a reward.]

With each trial passed, one transforms into the adventurer of the next floor.

The shadow takes on a human form, and the fifth trial begins.

Adventurer of the 5th Floor. Correspondingly, it moves at quite a rapid pace. Its sword strike descends upon Taesan.

Clang!

It was powerful. With a force that unmistakably transcended human limits, it could easily send a car flying.

Taesan exerted strength in his arm. The sword held by the shadow screamed and split apart.

[Fifth trial passed. Strength increases by 2 as a reward.]

And thus, the sixth trial begins.

The adventurer of the 6th Floor is faster and much stronger now. Moreover, it has begun using skills.

[The shadow unleashes a fierce thrust.]

"Are they starting to use active skills from here?"

The 6th Floor. It was an area where using a couple of skills wouldn't be unusual.
It wasn't a great skill. It was a skill that only added about 10% additional damage upon a successful thrust, and Taesan knew the method to acquire it but deemed it unnecessary, so he hadn't obtained the skill.

The acquisition method involved thrusting into the air in the same posture 100 times.

Instead of swinging his sword, Taesan spread his stance and waved his hand.

[You have activated Frost Arrow.]

Shooong!

A huge chunk of ice flew towards the shadow. The shadow intercepted it, but it shattered along with its sword.

[You have activated Blazing Sphere.]

Boom!

Two magic spells.

And the shadow disappeared.

[Sixth trial passed. Mana increases by 2 as a reward.]

It was still manageable with just magic. Taesan checked his mana; it had fully recovered from the expenditure.

Every time a trial was passed, all conditions were restored. It felt like even mental fatigue vanished judging by the sensation.

"I can try various things."

Swoosh.

The shadow appeared.

Adventurer of the 7th Floor.

Taat.

Undoubtedly fast. Speed difficult for an ordinary person to track with their eyes alone.

Arrows and the like could probably be easily dodged, but Taesan calmly used magic.

[You have activated Blazing Sphere.]

Boom!

Another ability gained through learning magic.
I gained control over the speed of magic.

Normally, a fireball with a speed similar to an arrow disappears in an instant, it rushes so fast that you'd think it vanished.

The shadow twists its body violently to dodge. However, it couldn't avoid its arm getting scorched as it brushed by.

[You have activated Frost Arrow.] [You have activated Frost Arrow.] [You have activated Confusion.]

Shoojeojung!

It couldn't evade with mental magic activated. It turns into a knot and disappears.

[Seventh trial passed. Strength increases by 3 as a reward.]

"This is quite satisfying too."

Although small, the quantity is significant because there are so many.

The Trial of Arrogance confronts adventurers from the first floor sequentially. With this approach, it's okay to let the community know. You can try it up to the point where it's all right to stop.

For now, it's the story after clearing.

Taesan activates magic against a newly appeared shadow.

[You have activated Blazing Sphere.]

The shadow rushes. Narrowly avoids the Blazing Sphere.

8th floor. In terms of floors, it is on par with it. It seemed that it could avoid at least one magic spell.
The shadow approaching Taesan swung its sword and activated a skill.

[The shadow has activated Feint. The next attack is feinted.]

"Hooh?"

From here on, it seemed to use decent skills. Taesan swung his sword. The moment it touched the shadow, its body forcibly twisted.

In response, he bent his body and swung his arm back. The attack ripped through the shadow in confusion.

[Eighth trial passed. Mana increases by 4 as a reward.]

Feint is a skill that forcibly causes a near miss. The moment of contact, the direction of force is deflected.

However, that direction is somewhat predictable. With enough use, predictions could minimize losses and allow for effective attacks.

[Your Momentum Increase has been activated. Feint proficiency increases by 2%.] [Your Momentum Increase has been activated. Strength permanently increases by 1. Agility permanently increases by 2.]

From here on, Momentum Increase seemed to be activating as well. It was an unexpected rise in stats.

Taesan looked forward to the next shadow with a joyful face, but nothing appeared.

"What's going on?"
If it's over, the clear window should appear, but that's not happening either. Taesan looked at the altar. The power he felt from within was quietly trembling.

"Why isn't it coming out?"

"This is amusing."

The ghost chuckled as if it had a guess.

"The area permitted by arrogance is only the shadows on the same floor. To proceed beyond this trial, you must pay a price. Didn't I mention this before? The gods are very stingy with their interference zones."

"So far, there hasn't been any indication of that."

"Even Rakiratas willingly reduced their domain."

"That's because of your uniqueness. And because they are strong enough to accept such losses."

"Isn't arrogance an exception?"

"The gap between transcendents clearly exists. Your head will hurt now. I wanted to see more of your potential, but I don't want to diminish my domain."

Taesan folded his arms and waited. The power of the altar was still shaking in various directions, seemingly in deep thought.

"Let's just go."

It seemed like he would be in that state all day if he stayed still. It was the moment Taesan showed signs of wanting to escape.

"Arrogance's interference zone is reduced." "Arrogance proposes an enhanced trial for you."
"......"

"This is really amusing."

The ghost burst into laughter.

A sense of urgency, as if pleading not to go, was felt. It was the moment when Taesan's thoughts about the gods he had been pondering shattered. Taesan reluctantly accepted the trial.

"Arrogance feels complex emotions." "Arrogance's Trial: Prove your strength."

The shadows converged again. The sword thrust towards Taesan.

* * *

Adventurer of the 9th floor. The player who reached where others hadn't yet.

The shadow rushed towards Taesan.

Clang!

He felt the weight of the sword. He could parry, but cutting through with the sword was impossible.

But his opponent was not so.

He parried the sword and counterattacked. The shadow attempted to block, but it was overwhelmed by the storm-like onslaught of sword strikes, unable to resist properly, and collapsed.

"Ninth Trial passed. Strength increases by 4 as a reward." "Your Mastery of Spilling increases by 3% due to your Spirit Rise." "Your Spirit Rise activates. Strength permanently increases by 3. Agility permanently increases by 2."
Once again, shadows appear. Upon seeing them take form, curiosity arose.

"What are these?"

They were not mere toys created by the gods. Each shadow had habits and movements of its own. They were remnants of someone.

"They come together on each floor?"

"The history of the Labyrinth is long. There are gods with hundreds of slaves. Right now, Rakyrathas is like that."

The shadows take shape.

This time, it's the 10th floor.

Taesan activates his magic.

"You have activated Conflagration."

The shadows evade the magic and rush towards Taesan with incredible speed.

"If the solo mode is around the 10th floor, is it similar to an easy mode clear?"

Clang!

Taesan parries with his sword.

"You have activated Madness." "You have activated Conflagration." "You have activated Conflagration." "You have activated Frost Arrows."

The magic manifests in the air.

Filling the space, it consumes the shadows.

"Tenth Trial passed. Strength increases by 5 as a reward."
This time, the Spirit Rise was triggered again. It seemed to be an increase in stats that didn't grant experience points, but the satisfaction of enhanced abilities was palpable.

And now, the 11th floor.

Strength that broke through the 10th floor.

The shadow that had been watching him cautiously steps onto the ground.

Kwoong!

Swift.

Certainly stronger. It blocks the sword. The sensation of heaviness is transmitted through the hands.

The Labyrinth changes its theme every 10 floors. If floors 1 through 10 are alive, floors 11 through 20 are the dead. Floors 21 through 30 are the strange. It goes on like this.

As such, breaking through the final floor of a theme greatly increases one's strength.

Taesan deflects the sword.

"The shadow has triggered Slippery. The next attack is evaded." "You have activated Strong Strike. The next attack deals significant damage."

Strong Strike ignores Slippery and attacks.

The shadow that had been pushing with its body is cut down as it is. It struggles in confusion, but Taesan swings his sword. He deflects and repels the defense.

With a small commotion, the shadow falls.
Here's the translation of the text:

"11th trial passed. Strength increases by 4 as a reward. Agility increases by 2."

"Your Spirit Rise has been triggered. Slippery proficiency has increased by 3%."

"Your Spirit Rise has been triggered. Strength permanently increases by 3. Agility permanently increases by 4."

"It doesn't push back one-sidedly. This time, the shadow rushed in without even taking time to assess. Taesan responded promptly."

"Swords clash."

"This time, it's a duel of swordsmanship rather than magic."

"The shadow moves its body without standing still, but it can't easily cope with superior swordsmanship. The shadow disappears five minutes later."

"And now, the 13th floor."

"This time, skills other than Slippery are used one by one."

"Taesan mixed magic into his attacks."

"It took ten minutes."

"The 14th floor was easier than that."

"Although he used various skills, his movements were awkward as an adventurer who relied on them."

"It was simpler for Taesan, who knew how to respond."

"He was able to achieve victory twenty minutes later."

"And now, the 15th floor."

"Kaaang!"

"It's solid. Even if pushed, it doesn't budge easily."

"From here on."

"At the 15th floor level, stats are at par. It meant that only Itaeyeon or Kang Jun-hyuk could barely compete with him at the current level."

"But Taesan has a skill."

"You have activated Ignition."

This concludes the translation of the provided text.
Here is the English translation of the text:

"Magic at zero range. Cannot be avoided. Flames explode.

[You have triggered Kanggeok.]

The attack crushes the shadow. The shadow blocks, but strength is added to Kanggeok. The sword presses down, knees hitting the ground.

The shadow barely slips away and attacks. Taesan does not block.

[Your first attack nullification has been triggered.]

The attack's outcome is erased.

Taesan moves his sword.

[Fifteenth trial passed. As a reward, strength increases by 6. Agility increases by 5. Mana increases by 4.]

Combined with Yeonggeok's rise, stats have increased to nearly 20. The rise in proficiency was a bonus.

"This is insane."

Not just a mere increase.

The increase returns like madness.

Stats noticeably increase with each capture. This had been repeated fifteen times. His stats had risen to over 60 since the first trial.

Originally, it wouldn't have been like this. As long as the trials progressed only to his own floor, it would have been at a reasonable level.

But Taesan has Yeonggeok's rise."
Here is the English translation of the text:

"There, arrogance also enhanced the trial at the end of the drum.

It was too good.

Lakiratasna Baltaja was a considerable reward, but this was added. It was a crazy growth intertwined with his skills.

A new shadow appears with a whistle.

Clang.

Adventurer of the 16th floor.

The shadow strikes. The shadow's stats are higher than Taesan's. With the breathless attack and an unbroken will, the shadow pressures Taesan.

Taesan also moved the sword with a serious expression.

Kagag!

Swinging and deflecting the sword. Using the Stormscar Sword to block the opponent's movements and secure advantageous positions. In addition, magic occasionally manifests, obscuring the opponent's vision and restricting movement.

[You activated acceleration.] [You activated Kanggeok.]

Kagag!

With accelerated body and enhanced strength, he strikes harshly. The shadow smoothly moves the sword to evade and counterattacks.

[Your first attack nullification has been triggered.]

The attack is nullified.

He unleashes all attacks on the bewildered shadow. Utilizing magic, swordsmanship, and all skills.

The shadow falls."
