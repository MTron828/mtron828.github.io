Chapter 432

432. 84th Floor, Levienov's World (5)

[Ah, ah, ah!]

The man's soul is screaming.

He's struggling to break free from Taesan's grasp.

But Taesan easily suppressed his resistance. He forcibly stole the power and strength contained within his soul.

[Your spiritual power has increased. Your health has permanently increased by 10147, your strength by 2278, your agility by 2202, and your intelligence by 587.] [Your spiritual power has increased. Your proficiency in twisted spiritual tuning has increased by 5%. Your proficiency in black magic has increased by 5%.] [Your spiritual power has increased. You have acquired the soul skill [World's Sword].]

The activation of spiritual power.

At the same time, the blessing that was bestowed upon Taesan disappeared.

A feeling of exhaustion enveloped his entire body. He is strong now, but the blessing had been too much. As he forcibly raised his physical strength and spiritual power to an extraordinary level, a considerable burden was placed upon him.

"Is this the sensation of Ainztahar's realm?"

The sensation of reaching the pinnacle of an extraordinary realm.

Taesan clenched his fist. Soon, he too would reach that realm.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I opened the skill window and checked, and finally, the proficiency of the twisted aura tuning had reached 80%, and the proficiency of the black aura had reached 20%.

"It took a long time."

I wanted to check it right away, but there were things I had to take care of first.

Taesan raised his hand.

"Let's go up."

[You have activated the Declaration of Buoyancy.]

The remnants of the temple floated in the air. Taesan discovered a sacred artifact stuck in the gap.

The temple was in the midst of a fierce battle. The remnants were completely crushed, making it impossible to find their original form.

But the sacred artifact was unscathed.

Just like when I first saw it, it was radiating powerful divine energy.

Taesan grasped the sacred artifact. As he looked up at the sky, the battle was slowly coming to an end.

The task was complete. Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

[84th floor cleared.] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [You have obtained the weapon's inscription.] [You have obtained ???.] [I'm back.]

In the labyrinth, Balbambara was waiting for Taesan.

[It doesn't seem like there's any other problem. That's a relief. So, do you think you've learned the truth?]

"Moderately."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan gazed at Balbambar.

Balbambar spoke, expecting an answer.

[Did you get the sacred relic?]

Taesan took out Levienov's sacred relic and showed it to Balbambar, who nodded his head.

[Good. Let's move right away.] [Balbambar activated #000231.]

Kugugung!

The labyrinth twisted. Taesan arrived at the 78th floor, the library of the heavens, in an instant.

[There seem to be many curious things, but let's tidy up after completing Ainzhart's quest. That will be convenient for both you and us.]

"Alright then."

Taesan went to find Ainzhart. Ainzhart was sitting at the entrance of the hidden secret room, resting.

When he discovered Taesan, he jumped up.

"Ah, you're back already. Did you get the sacred relic?"

Taesan showed him the sacred relic.

Ainzhart's eyes widened greatly.

"Oh, oh oh……."

"How is Levienov?"

"He had a fit just a little while ago, but he's recovered now."

"Then we can proceed right away."

Taesan entered the secret room.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The goddess was there. She was in the same posture as before, with a gentle smile.

However, the energy emanating from her was undoubtedly weaker than before. The impure energy emanating from her heart was growing stronger.

I will remove the contamination and restore the goddess to her original state. Taesan held up the sacred artifact.

* * *

[What should we do now?]

Balbam didn't leave. The administrator of the storage room. Horhe also came to watch over Taesan.

"Purifying the contamination of the gods is not an easy task, even for my lord. If it's possible, I'd like to acquire that knowledge."

[Horhe, that's right, Balbam. Why are you still here? Don't you have many places to manage?] [We can't know how the events that occurred here will affect the labyrinth. As an administrator, I have to keep an eye on it.] [Ah, is that the problem?]

The ghost nodded. Ainztzhar asked with trembling eyes.

"What do you plan to do?"

"Although many parts are contaminated, Lord Lebinauf is protecting himself. He has gathered the contaminated parts in his heart. And that contamination is similar to the boundary I possess."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, using the boundary line, I'll clean up the contamination that has invaded Lebinenov's heart.

"I originally thought of purifying Lebinenov's entire world, but that's impossible."

That place had transformed into a perfect, sacred realm. Even Taesan couldn't do anything about it. So, I thought of dealing with the contamination that had taken over Lebinenov's body.

"You'll lose your domain, Goddess. You'll lose most of your power. The possibility of failure is not low either."

"It doesn't matter. Even if there's a slim chance, that's enough for me."

Ainzhaar said with an excited face.

Taesan approached Lebinenov with the sacred artifact.

The impure energy in Lebinenov's heart fiercely resisted Taesan, scattering its energy wildly.

Taesan pushed it back with divine power and raised his hand.

Kyiiiing!

A boundary line appeared above his hand.

Taesan thrust it straight into Lebinenov's heart.

Lebinenov's eyes widened in shock.

[Kyaahhh!]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Levinehoff roars. Like a beast that has sensed a threat to its life, it begins to unleash its power in all directions. Ainshar hastily summons the golden wall and Barbalumbab uses the administrator's power to protect it firmly.

The dark energy embedded in Taesan's hand is fiercely resisting. It is trying to infiltrate Taesan's body and contaminate him.

But it doesn't work.

Taesan's boundary line, which he has drawn with his hand, is instead absorbing the dark energy.

The corruption of the transcendent being that shook the gods is unable to exert any power in front of Taesan. Taesan strengthens his boundary line and digs deeper into the dark energy.

As a result, Taesan is able to see something fluttering deep within the dark energy.

That is the source of the corruption that tainted the goddess.

Taesan breaks through the boundary line. The source unleashes its full power, as if it's going to explode.

Kugugung!

The ash-colored haze covers the field of vision. Ainshar is shocked and leaps away. His instincts warn him that if he touches the ash, his level could be distorted. Barbalumbab uses the administrator's power to its fullest extent.

[Barbalumbab activates #000001.]

Kugugung!

The labyrinth is separated.

Barbalumbab has blocked the connection between the secret room and the labyrinth. This is the authority granted to him. As the administrator of the labyrinth, this is his power.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, the authority that covered the four directions was shaken anxiously by the dark, ashy power.

[Hmm.]

Babalambam pulled its strength even more. As if sealing it, they isolated the secret room where they were.

Kwajik.

Taesan grasped the source.

At the same time, Taesan felt a gaze.

A gigantic, unseen gaze from beyond this world.

It was laughing at Taesan.

Taesan strongly repelled the gaze. With the gaze, he resisted and pulled it back.

The source of the contamination that tainted the goddess was pulled out.

[You obtained a fragment of the divine sword.] [The proficiency of the boundary line has risen significantly!] [You purified the contamination of the divine sword and obtained the special skill [Purification of the Impure].] [Kyaah...].

The scream subsided in an instant. The vitality on the goddess's face disappeared in an instant. Although it was a contaminated part, it was torn out of her body, and her spirit and flesh could not withstand it and were destroyed.

Taesan immediately inserted the sacred object into the goddess's heart.

Kugugugung!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The holy relic merged with the goddess in an instant. Since it was originally hers, there was no resistance. It began to fill in the parts that were contaminated and restore them.

"Ah."

Taesan chose the silk.

As the ash-colored light slowly faded, Ainshar rushed over hastily.

"My goddess!"

He embraced the fallen goddess, who was quietly gasping for breath.

The strange sensation he had felt when they first met was no longer present.

"Ah, ah, ah... ah!"

Ainshar burst into tears of joy, embracing the goddess.

[Sub-quest success] [Ainshar and Levinefov give you a reward.]

* * *

Taesan gazed at the impure object in his hand.

[Fragment of the Ancient God] [A part of the Ancient God beyond the law.]

The fragment continued to emit impure energy, trying to consume Taesan, who held it. However, it had no effect due to the boundary line Taesan had drawn.

"I really did it."

Horhe looked at Taesan with interest.

"There is no knowledge of a being like you even in the Library of the Heavens. My curiosity about you is growing."

Horhe's gaze was filled with deep curiosity.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ainzach held the goddess and wept, then stumbled to his feet.

"Thank you, really, thank you."

Ainzach grasped Taesan's hand tightly.

"I'll definitely repay you."

"It's not yet. We don't know when she'll wake up. For now, let's focus on protecting the goddess."

"That's right. For the time being, I'll focus on Levienov. I'm sorry. When the goddess wakes up, I'll definitely give her a worthy reward."

It seemed that the quest reward was given after Levienov regained consciousness. Taesan accepted it calmly, as it was somewhat expected.

"It's all over."

[……Good.]

Barbarambam was silently staring at Taesan.

[Open the passage.] [Barbarambam activated #000004.]

The space opened up.

What appeared beyond was the space possessed by the labyrinth's mage.

[I don't have the authority. Let's ask the mage directly.]

Taesan stepped into the space beyond.

The space was filled with all sorts of powers, dyed in a rainbow of colors.

The mage was waiting there.

"I'm sorry, but you can't be here. Please leave for a moment."

[What?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The ghost did nothing and disappeared beside the mountain.

"You're the same, green witch. This is a secret that's not allowed to be told to you."

[Wait a minute!]

A voice mixed with surprise was quickly erased. The wizard created a chair and sat down.

"From here on, it's a story about a big secret. I can't tell anyone except you. Do you roughly know what it's about?"

"Roughly."

Taesan sat down in the chair.

"The gods are gradually revealing themselves in this world."

"It'll take a very long time, but they'll come back someday. The thought of repeating that miserable war makes me sick."

The wizard muttered with a disgusted face. He had fought against the gods directly before they were banished, and his tone was one of experience.

"If we're lucky, we might be able to banish them again... but who knows what will happen?"

"He said I'm the key."

Taesan said.

"He said that if I'm here, many things are possible. Do you know what that means?"

"You're guessing it too, aren't you?"

The wizard raised his finger and pointed at Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You're handling black. And that's not a problem at all."

"Is it rare to find someone who can wield the power of Gosin? In the world of Levinov, the avatar of Gosin was an immortal. They handled black well."

"That's a different story. He rose to the level of immortality and then offered himself to Gosin. As a reward, he gained the ability to wield black."

The wizard said.

"But you're handling not only black but also the heterogeneous power of the boundary line, which mixes divinity, without a contract with Gosin."

The eyes, like the abyss, looked at Taesan.

"That makes many things possible. It can sever the connection between Gosin and the avatar, and even purify the contaminated goddess. What can be done with that power?"

"Do you know about me?"

The wizard had said before. Taesan's boundary line. He was searching for an answer to its peculiarity, but it wasn't coming easily.

"I found it, though."

The wizard opened his mouth with a wry smile.

"We waged war against Gosin."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's a war from a distant past that even most transcenders don't know about, and only a few remember.

"Many transcenders died, and were reborn. Space collapsed, and the timeline was distorted. The concept itself was destroyed. The war that seemed to have no end until the universe was destroyed finally came to an end."

The winners of the war were the transcenders.

"But we couldn't kill the Emperor of Sin. We could only exile him. All the transcenders gathered and created a seal with countless laws overlapping. Even the Emperor of Sin couldn't break that seal. The universe was finally free from the Emperor's influence."

However, the seal was breaking. The Emperor of Sin was reappearing in the universe, and their goal was the Taesan.

"Why are you being targeted? It's simple. If you have the boundary, you can release the seal that banished them and free the Emperor of Sin."

Note: "초월자" is translated to "transcender", but it's a term that can be translated to "transcendent being" or "being beyond human" depending on the context. "고신" is translated to "Emperor of Sin", but it's a term that can be translated to "God of Sin" or "Deity of Sin" depending on the context.
