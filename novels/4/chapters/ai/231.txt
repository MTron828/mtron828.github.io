Chapter 232

232. 53 Floor (1)

[Start of 53 Floor Quest] [Defeat the boss on the 53rd floor and pass through.] [Reward: The robe that Barbossi possessed.] [Secret reward: ???]

The monsters on the 53rd floor were changing shadows. The scattered shadows on the floor took on various forms and attacked the mountain.

Of course, it was not possible to match the mountain's strength, so I quickly processed and broke through the labyrinth.

And then the quest arrived.

[Special Quest Start] [Return to the Earth.] [In a week's time, you will return to the land you left behind. Survive there and come back again. The reward will be determined according to your performance.] [This quest cannot be refused.]

"Finally."

[What's up?]

The mountain nodded its head. It was time to return to their hometown.

"What are you saying?"

Barcassa, who was curious, asked the mountain. The mountain roughly explained, and Barcassa burst out laughing after hearing the story.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The owner's world is in chaos, it seems. The world being trampled by the gods... Is it to stop their attacks? "

"Maybe so."

"That's interesting. I'm sorry to say this, but I want to hurry up."

Barukaja muttered to himself with a raised voice.

Tae-san opened the community.

The community was as chaotic as before.

[Kang Tae-san: What's the situation?] [Kim Hwi-yeon: Ah, Mr. Tae-san is here too? I was worried because I hadn't seen you recently.] [Kang Tae-san: I had something to do.] [Geum Jung-geun: The situation is bad, not good, but not terrible either.]

There was a sense of restraint in the midst of the community's chaos. Everyone was confused and scared, but there was a will to survive.

[Kim Hwi-yeon: Since it's the fourth time, everyone will adapt soon.]

They had seen many deaths. They had endured and were still living, having overcome the labyrinth.

All those who had survived so far were only hardened individuals. They wouldn't collapse in despair or fear at the sudden fear that had descended upon them.

[Kang Tae-san: Really?]

It was faster than expected.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was from the fifth return of the gods that people began to become mentally complete. As various things changed from their previous lives, people's mentalities also became more mature at a faster rate.

[Kang Tae-san[Alone]: How are you guys? Lee Tae-yeon, Kang Jun-hyuk] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: We're going down without any problems. We'll arrive at the 20th floor soon.] [Kang Tae-san[Alone]: How fast?]

When he was at the 44th floor, they were talking about the 16th floor. But now they're already at the 20th floor. It was a significantly faster pace than before.

[Kang Jun-hyuk[Alone]: It's all thanks to my brother. Black magic and ability sword. This is really... it's unbelievable skill, you know.]

An unbridled exclamation burst forth from the text. Now, as they're just about to break through the 10th floor, the value of these two skills is almost absolute.

[Kang Jun-hyuk[Alone]: This time, we'll create a different result than before.] [Kang Tae-san[Alone]: Work hard.]

Kang Tae-san glanced at the community. Many people were talking about their returns.

Among their conversations, one notable topic stood out.

[Kang Tae-san[Alone]: Everyone seems to be guessing what this return's quest is.] [Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard]: It's obvious from the flow so far, isn't it?]
Here is the translation of the text:

The first time people gathered in one place. The second time, they gathered around a path. And the third time, people from Gyeonggi Province and Seoul gathered at the Seoul City Hall.

So, it was not difficult to guess what kind of quest would happen the fourth time.

It was possible that the quest would be for all Koreans to gather in Seoul.

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: We're preparing for that, so I think it would be good if you could... help a bit, Mr. Taesan.][Gang Taesan [Alone]: It's fine.][Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: Ah, thank you.][Gang Taesan [Alone]: Then there's no problem, is there?][Kum Jung-geun [Hard]: Ah, that's it.][Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: If it exists, it exists; if it doesn't, it doesn't...][Gang Taesan [Alone]: What's that?]

Kim Hwi-yeon posted a vague message.

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: There's a bit of disagreement. It's not a big deal, but it might bother you a bit, so... there's a slight problem, among us.][Gang Taesan [Alone]: A problem?]

After briefly thinking about the meaning, Taesan suddenly realized something.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Kang Tae-san [Alone] : I understand what you mean. There won't be any problems, so I won't worry about it. Let's just wait and see.]
[Kim Hui-yeon [Hard] : Yes.]
[Geum Jung-geun [Hard] : Older brother, I'll see you later.]
[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone] : Ugh, I'm going to die. I'm going to die.]
[Kang Jun-hyeok [Alone] : I want to go quickly. I want to tear those monsters to shreds.]

Tae-san closed the community.

"What do you mean? After thinking about it, I think things have changed now."

Humans all have something they pursue.

Some people pursue a stable life, while others want to be stronger than others. Some people want mental peace, and others want absolute power.

And some people want to dominate everything.

In the past, there was no problem. Most people had died, after all.

But now, things are different because Kim Hui-yeon is still alive.

"It doesn't matter."

If he just uses his strength, everything will be fine.

Tae-san continued to descend into the labyrinth.

And he found a secret room.

[Here it is.]

A ghost who had been following quietly spoke up.

[Do you remember what I said before? There's a place where you can get the weapon I used. It's a place where you can get the weapon I used.]

"That's right."

[That place is this place. It's the 53rd floor secret room.]

Tae-san looked at the secret room.

It was much wider than before, and next to the staff was a gray-colored sword.

"Is that it?"
Here is the translation of the text:

As I look, I can take it. You won't have any problems. The Taesan put his foot into the passage.

Kurururun!

And then the walls began to move and unrecognizable traps sprouted out.

When you entered the 50th floor, the secret room traps also changed dramatically. Even for a normal adventurer, it would be impossible to overcome these traps.

Of course, it wasn't for Taesan.

"Barukaza."

Barukaza clapped his hands. The wall unfolded, and the traps fell one by one.

Taesan walked towards the reward like taking a stroll.

Taesan grasped the staff.

[Rainbow Staff] [Magic + 80] [A staff with a shining rainbow gemstone that amplifies the power of the gemstones and creates an overwhelming power. It is rumored to be a playful trick of a transcendent existence.] [This staff pushes the user's weapon away.]

Paaang!

The moment Taesan grasped the staff, the sword that was held in his hand was forced out of his hand.

"What's going on."

Kurururun!

And at that moment, the secret room began to collapse.

The wall slowly moved, blocking the passage, and the ceiling came crashing down.

'Trigger?'
Here is the translation of the text:

The trap is triggered when the reward is taken. Tai'an's expression remained unchanged as he kicked his foot.

[You have activated the shoes that allow you to jump to the end of the world.]

Tai'an's body jumped a short distance. He quickly caught the flying sword.

Paang!

He used his strength to suppress the stick that was pushing the sword and put it away in his inventory. He then picked up the iron-colored sword that was lying on the ground.

[You have randomly activated a blink.]

Tai'an's physical body burst out of the tunnel.

[The sword of a seasoned warrior] [Attack power + 120] [The sword of a warrior who had trained relentlessly and never let go of the sword until the moment of death. A bit of his determination is still contained in the sword.]

"Is this it?"

[Yeah, I solved the problem easily. I had a hard time because of this.]

"It's a trap with a bad hobby."

When holding the stick as a reward from the secret room, the weapon in his hand suddenly flew out. At the same time, the walls of the labyrinth began to close.

The walls and floor of the labyrinth were impossible to destroy unless you were at the level of an Einzahrl. The speed of the closing walls was quite fast, making it difficult to recover the flying sword and escape in time.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as he got the cane, he lost his own weapon, which was a trap. [The god of mischief. Not too much mischief.]

"Is there a god of mischief?"

[As I go down, I'll be able to meet you. I don't want to see a god I'm not interested in.]

The ghost seemed to have been struggling, but Taesan was able to escape without any problems.

On top of that, he had a good sword.

Attack power 120. The sword he was holding at the moment was given by the god of mischief, and its attack power was 50 higher than the god's gift. It was definitely a good weapon for a 53rd-floor adventurer.

"That's good."

The cane could also become a good treasure.

Taesan continued to go down the labyrinth, struggling.

The 53rd-floor boss was a long, dark shadow that stretched out like a darkness. Although it was similar to the high-level boss, its strength and power were vastly different. It was not difficult to win.

Both the reward and the secret reward were magical items, so he thought of trading them for treasures.

However, he didn't think about going up for the time being. Since there was only a week left, he thought of getting as much as possible and ending it at the end.

Taesan arrived at the 54th floor.

The monster on the 54th floor was in the shape of the wind. The wind itself had taken shape and become a monster.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Taesan, who had a contract with the Wind God King, was an extremely easy opponent. Without any special attacks, he could barely do anything just by shaking his strength.

Taesan went down like that.

And then he started to see the results of what he had accumulated.

* * *

"Finally, it's changed a lot."

The proficiency of skills increases as they are used, and the content of the skills also changes. For a while, there was no change as he accumulated skills, but finally, what he had accumulated started to bear fruit.

[SPECIAL ACTIVATION SKILL: TARGET DESIGNATION] [PROFICIENCY: 20%] [When attacking a designated weak spot on an enemy, it deals double damage. The same target cannot be re-designated as a weak spot within a day. It can only be designated for a very small area. The judgment for weak spots has become slightly looser.]

The change in target designation at 20% proficiency was a relaxation of the judgment.

Until now, the weak spot attack was at a level where it could only be activated by hitting a single, narrow area. It was at a level where even the slightest movement from the opponent could cause it to fail.

The judgment for weak spots has expanded to the level of a coin's diameter. The difference was quite noticeable.
Here is the translation of the text:

[SPECIAL PERMANENT SKILL: Wielder of the Sword] [Proficiency: 20%] [A person who has reached the level recognized by the god of the sword. When fighting against an opponent wielding a weapon, it is easy to notice their weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and proficiency in wielding the sword increases.]

Tae-san wielded his sword. His created ability, swordsmanship, unfolded.

His movements became smoother than before.

Although the difference was not great, it was a significant change that could block variables in the overall framework of battle.

[SPECIAL ACTIVATION SKILL: Understanding the Essence] [Proficiency: 60%] [Understand the essence of the target. One can know the source of the target's power and its weaknesses. One can also perceive the target's state.]

The content about perceiving the state was added. I tried it out on Barukaza and it worked immediately.

[A high-grade spirit with various colors. Barukaza.] [A spirit contracted with Kang Tae-san.] [At the peak of the highest level.] [Why do you look at me like that?]

"I'm just checking."

It was not a bad change. If proficiency in understanding the essence reaches 100%, one can obtain great power, so it's best to improve it as quickly as possible.

Error also changed.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Special Skill: Ohre] [Proficiency: 40%] [A reward given to those who have proven themselves with a sword. With Ohre, one can handle it at a decent level.]

Compared to regular use, the proficiency increase was slow. However, it became possible to handle Ohre more efficiently. The damage increased, and it was possible to greatly expand the range of attacks or increase the attack range.

Furthermore, the proficiency of the Sword Ability also changed.

[Advanced Swordsmanship: Sword Ability] [Proficiency: 41%] [A unique swordsmanship created by the adventurer of the labyrinth. It is based on the labyrinth's system and was created as a basis for the swordsmanship used by the king of a deceased world. One can use skills perfectly linked with swordsmanship.]

Comparing it to the previously learned Irlak Mu technique, which was still around 30%, it was clear that it had been significantly accelerated. The skill was created by the master himself, and the speed was clearly fast.

With the increase in proficiency, skills that had changed again appeared among the skills that had changed into Sword Ability. Additionally, there were a few skills that had been added to the effects of Sword Ability.
