Chapter 324

324. The Magician Who Created the Labyrinth (2)

Everything that is allowed within the bounds of law and order.

“…If I were to escape mortality and seek eternal immortality?”

“It’s impossible. That would be a power that transcends the law. But it is possible to get infinitely close to eternity. To be specific, until the end of this world.”

“In essence, it’s immortality.”

“Isn’t it different? Eventually, it will come to an end.”

Until the end of the world.

For mortals, it was possible to live a life that was virtually eternal.

“If you want to destroy a galaxy, that’s possible too. You can become the owner of thousands of planets where life thrives, and it’s also possible to revive the dead and move through time as you wish. If you want to become the master of the labyrinth, I can make that happen.”

Taesan closed his mouth.

He had expected it to some extent. Not just clearing the labyrinth, but conquering it. He had achieved an impossible feat, so the reward couldn’t be small.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But the wizard's words exceeded Taesan's expectations.

If I wanted to, I could become the owner of the labyrinth and destroy the galaxy itself, ruling over thousands of planets.

It was like saying I could achieve everything I wanted.

But Taesan's eyes sank.

"It's impossible to interfere with Goshin."

"That's right."

The wizard nodded.

"They are beings beyond the law, disruptors of order. They cannot be the target of wishes."

The creators of the labyrinth were transcendents, gods of the world.

But even they couldn't perfectly block the interference of the expelled Goshin. It was because Goshin was a being beyond the law.

"Unfortunately, it seems I won't be able to easily save your ruined world."

Taesan clicked his tongue. One of the methods to achieve victory had been blocked. He knew it wouldn't be easy, but he couldn't help feeling frustrated.

The wizard said,

"Don't you think they're interesting beings?"

"Interesting?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Their power is infinite within their own limits. No matter how much they use it, it doesn't get consumed. Considering that transcenders find it extremely difficult to recover from power exhaustion, they are indeed unique beings."

The magician muttered in a bright, cheerful voice.

"But they weren't banished from this world because their power was insufficient. What can they do? What's possible? Can they create some phenomenon by bending the laws and order?"

Taesan looked at the magician.

The gods who had been talking about the transcenders were filled with frustration, anger, and hatred.

But the magician was different.

The magician's face, as they talked about the transcenders, was filled with interest and curiosity.

Taesan couldn't help but ask.

"What did you create this place for?"

The transcenders had settled here because they wanted to see the great warrior's fighting spirit and battles.

Then, what did the magician desire?

"A magician is one who explores the unknown."

The magician said calmly.

"I just want to know. There are many things I don't know."

He raised his finger, pointing at Taesan.

"In that sense, you're fulfilling my wish. Didn't I say I'm interested in you?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The magician's eyes, gazing at the Taesan, shone brightly.

"I designed many conditions when creating the labyrinth. Until now, there has never been an instance where my design and calculations were exceeded. But you are different."

The magician's excited voice echoed.

"You have power that transcends my design, even though you rely on the system. That's a surge in spiritual energy. What is it? What allows you to possess power that surpasses mortality, despite being mortal, and defy the laws of nature?"

Taesan didn't know much about the surge in spiritual energy, and neither did the green witch.

It seemed that the magician who created the labyrinth didn't understand the skills Taesan possessed either.

"The source of the power you've obtained ultimately lies in the surge in spiritual energy."

Divine power, black power, boundary power, and command power - all of these skills were obtained due to the surge in spiritual energy.

"What is it?"

The magician's question was one he had been holding in for thousands of years.

"I called you because it's better than leaving you to be trampled. That's all."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The wizard had no expectations about the adventurer from Earth.

Rather than leaving him to die at the hands of Gosin, he thought it would be interesting to call him to the labyrinth and see if there would be even a slight change.

"But you're like that, and that woman is like that too. It's amusing. If I hadn't called you, I would have regretted it."

There was only one woman. Lee Tae-yeon.

The wizard smiled faintly.

"That woman is also very interesting. She went down the labyrinth in a different direction from you. It wasn't what I had hoped for, but she's much better than those incompetent fools."

I had many questions about Lee Tae-yeon, but the wizard seemed to refuse to answer any more questions as he stood up from his chair.

"That's as far as the story goes. I have many questions too, but... I'm not allowed to reveal any more than this."

Taesan's body was trembling anxiously, as if the space itself was pushing him away, indicating that further meetings were not permitted.

"You have many qualifications, but it's still too early. Let's meet again after you've gone down further."

The space began to close in. Taesan's body was moving away from the wizard.

"Ah, just one more question."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Even though the wizard couldn't be seen, his voice was heard as if he was speaking right next to him.

"Is the labyrinth a satisfactory place for you?"

It was a question that didn't require much thought. Taesan replied.

"Yes."

"Hmm."

A satisfied snort was heard.

"That's enough. Go down with enthusiasm. And achieve what you want."

Whoosh!

Taesan's body fell into the labyrinth.

The waiting Barbamba asked.

[Did you have a good meeting?]

Taesan nodded and got up.

Something was in Taesan's hand.

"This is..."

[Is this a gift from the master? You're not supposed to get involved with adventurers, but you're giving a gift? You must have taken a liking to him.]

Taesan confirmed what was in his hand. It was a ball containing magical energy.

[Magical Orb] [A magical orb that would satisfy the magical god if offered as a tribute.]

"A tribute?"

It wasn't bad for a single meeting to yield such a reward. Taesan grasped the orb.

* * *

[How was it?]

"It was unexpectedly ordinary," Taesan replied to the ghost's question.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I created a place like a labyrinth, and it seemed to have a problem with its character, but it was ordinary. I was able to have a more comfortable conversation than I thought.

[Is that so?]

The ghost murmured as if it was dissatisfied with something.

[You're the one who reached that place and created this crazy labyrinth, and yet you're so ordinary...][My job is done. You take care of the rest.]

The body of Balbambara began to collapse.

[Good luck, adventurer.]

He left his last words and returned to the labyrinth's walls.

Taesan organized the things he had obtained.

When he thought about it, he realized he hadn't checked the clear reward for the 70th floor yet.

[Reward: Necklace of the one who reached the depths.] [HP + 1000] [MP + 500] [STR + 500] [AGI + 500] [INT + 500] [Attack Power + 200] [Defense Power + 200] [A necklace given to those who reached the deepest part.]

Taesan was taken aback by the necklace's performance.

"What is this?"

The necklace, unlike armor, was an accessory like a ring, so its stats weren't that high.

However, the Necklace of the one who reached the depths boasted an exceptional performance that surpassed ordinary armor.

[Now it's time for the deep floor.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The ghost said it as if it was obvious.

[From now on, the rewards you receive will be different from what you've gotten so far, so it's easier to understand if you think of them as separate rewards.]

Taesan checked the secret room rewards and secret rewards.

[The staff that calls the dawn] [Magic + 400] [Mana + 2500] [A staff that has captured the light of the sun, which shines thousands of times in the darkness, and has been infused with its power.] [An immortal sword that is close to being indestructible] [Strength + 500] [Attack power + 500] [A long sword that has been tempered by one who has transcended mortality. The energy still lingers strongly within the sword.]

Overall, the stats were much higher than the equipment rewards received from clearing floors so far.

It was on the level of rewards obtained after passing the trials of the gods, or equipment made by entrusting materials to a master craftsman.

"From now on, only equipment of this level will come out, right?"

[This is also entrance-level equipment, so isn't it a bit inferior compared to real equipment?]

Taesan laughed.

He had finally obtained the equipment that his past life's Lee Tae-yeon had possessed, and that his guides had used."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan headed towards the 71st floor before climbing the labyrinth.

He met Release and offered him a tribute. The magic orb given by the magician who created the labyrinth had a value equivalent to a mid-level magic spell.

Thanks to that, Taesan was able to acquire the mid-level magic spell he wanted.

[Middle-level magic: Limited Blink] [Mana consumption: 200] [Proficiency: 1%] [Allows you to jump to a certain distance. This skill cannot be used for 10 minutes after use.]

A spatial jump skill.

Unlike random blink, he could jump to where he wanted without leaving a mark.

The distance restriction was around 1km, which was more generous than he thought. It was a satisfying magic.

And Taesan handed over the collection of injustices to Half-ran. After briefly examining the material, Half-ran said it would be difficult to create something exceptional with just this. He said that if Taesan wanted something proper, he should bring other materials, and Taesan agreed.

And Taesan returned to the 71st floor again.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[71st Floor Quest Begins.] [Break through the realm of the starving shadows.] [Reward: Mythical Ankle Protector.] [Secret Reward: ???]

As I passed by the room where I met Balbam and went through the corridor, the shop owner appeared.

"Welcome."

The shop owner quietly greeted Taesan.

"From here on, it's the deep floor. You know what that means, right?"

"You're selling deep floor equipment, aren't you?"

"That's correct."

He chuckled and muttered in an impressed tone.

"I've seen many adventurers, but you're the first one to come down without using gold."

Taesan had only purchased a few materials needed for his skills and some recovery potions, excluding almost everything else. Except for a ring that increased all stats by a percentage and a witch's wrist protector, he hadn't spent money on equipment.

In other words, Taesan had a tremendous amount of gold right now.

The shop owner asked with a curious tone.

"How much do you have?"

"Roughly... around 650,000 gold."

"Wow."

[You've accumulated that much?]

The shop owner burst out laughing, and the ghost was also shocked.

650,000 gold.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even in the deepest parts, it was gold that was hard to come by. Taesan replied.

"I haven't used gold much since the 40th floor."

At most, he had used a potion to obtain absolute protection, and that was it.

All of it was for this moment.

Taesan, who had disposed of the Heavenly Sword, asked the shop owner.

"Can you show me your goods?"

"Of course."

The shop owner readily opened up his space.

Swords, spears, bows, staffs, magic books, whips, armor, and more.

Innumerable and priceless treasures poured out. Taesan began to examine each one.

[The Red Whip Imbued with Divine Blood] [Attack Power +700] [Deals 20% additional damage to those with divine blood, can activate [Saint Slayer]] [A whip used to torture saints, with their blood infused into its roots.] [600,000G]

Taesan gazed at the whip with a mixture of surprise and admiration.

An attack power of 700. On top of that, it dealt an additional 20% damage to those with divine blood, and even came with a special skill.

This was a weapon on a completely different level from what Taesan had obtained so far.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This time, I checked out the bow. A bow as big as a person's body was hard to even pull.

[The Guardian's Bow, made by cutting the roots of the World Tree and weaving its branches] [Attack Power +600] [The elves cut the roots of the World Tree and broke its branches to protect themselves. They said they were protecting the World Tree, but no one believed them.] [The stronger you pull the bow, the higher the attack power and range increase, with no limit to the increase.] [You can activate [Root Drop] once a month.] [720,000G]

A bow that increases attack power and range as you pull it stronger, with no limits.

I don't know what kind of skill Root Drop is, but considering its cooldown is a month, it's a sufficient performance for a trump card.

Taesan looked around.

Over 100 pieces of equipment were scattered around.

And none of them were inferior to the two weapons Taesan had checked out."
