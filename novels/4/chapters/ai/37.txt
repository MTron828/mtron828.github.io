Episode 38

38. 5th Floor, God of Victory. Baltaja Ha (3)

Charge and Rage.

These were skills that hadn't been shown until now. Other individuals might have hesitated in confusion due to unfamiliar effects, but Taesan was different.

He possessed knowledge.

Taesan immediately rushed at Ratran. This caught Ratran off guard instead.

"Huh."

Thinking Taesan would hesitate in front of an unknown skill, Ratran's sword tip shook. But he quickly steadied and drew his sword.

Kaaang!

A strong force could be felt beyond the blade. In an instant, his arm was pressed down.

"Unbelievable."

Such a vast difference emerged. It was a monstrous strength. Literally, it was not a 5th-floor monster.

The advice to not engage would be the same for ordinary players.

But Taesan was not an ordinary player.

Three skills were activated upon starting the battle with Ratran.

The thirst for battle enhanced all actions, including attack power, defense, and speed, when facing enemies, and Disdain for the Strong provided a bonus to stats against adversaries.
Since it's a 1:1 situation, a fair duel also triggered, boosting their stats.

The Goblin Lord bestowed much upon him.

Taesan confirms the stat increase. With the activation of three skills, all stats had risen by about 20 points.

It was nearly a 30% increase. Taesan rushes towards Ratran.

Clang.

This time, there was no giving way. Their strengths were perfectly matched.

"Hup!"

Ratran swung his greatsword forcefully. It seemed like a demand to be struck back, and Taesan responded in kind. There was no reason to pass up an opportunity to attack without any pressure.

The damage numbers quickly appeared. Over 200 damage was dealt in an instant.

Ratran's eyes gleamed.

The greatsword moved sharply. Gripping it with both hands, he struck down with a precise posture.

"[Ratran has triggered Strong Strike.] [Ratran has ignored Counteraction Negation.]"

It was the same strike as before.

And it had its openings. If countered and retaliated against, it could inflict significant damage, such a clumsy attack.

But Taesan did not block, immediately distancing himself. The greatsword swished futilely through the air, and Taesan drew out his staff.
"[You have activated Fireball.]"

The flames soared towards Ratran. Fireball was a powerful spell, but it was still an early stage story. Given Ratran's stats, he could easily withstand it.

"Hm."

However, Ratran opted to evade the fireball. Taesan, as if anticipating this, had already drawn his bow.

Ping! Ping!

Arrows were shot rapidly.

With agility surpassing 100, dozens of arrows filled the air in an instant.

Even with no space to dodge, Ratran had no choice but to move his sword amidst the barrage of arrows.

Clang!

With a single movement of his greatsword, all the arrows fell. The attack failed, but Taesan remained composed. Ratran wore a bewildered expression.

"Do you know what I'm capable of?"

"Well..."

Taesan sheathed his bow.

Charging to enable the use of specific skills. And the more hits taken, the stronger the damage dealt by Fury.

A skill usable with Strong Strike, dealing damage beyond imagination upon impact.

Additionally, Counteraction Negation. Normally, weapons do not affect damage calculations upon collision, but Counteraction Negation skill can break through that.
If you block without knowing anything, you'd probably lose half your health.

But Taesan knows better.

He knows you shouldn't block that.

Even blocking an arrow affects your strong strike.

"Hmm."

Ratran gripped his weapon with unease. Normally, he would have gained a significant advantage, but thanks to Taesan's perfect response, he only suffered losses.

"This won't work with these means."

Now it's for real.

Ratran moved his sword with a serious expression. Near-perfect swordsmanship unfolded.

Taesan countered. After a few exchanges, Ratran caught on.

"You lack swordsmanship."

Ratran smiled slyly as he moved his sword. A display of extreme technique unfolded.

As he said, Taesan lacks proper technique.

But Taesan has faced more than nine skilled opponents. He has developed adequate responses.

Taesan sends Ratran flying with a shake of his sword.

"[You have activated Counter.]"


The body moves automatically to respond to the opponent's techniques. Seizing an opening, Taesan bends the opponent's thigh. Ratran's face shows surprise.

"Oh?"

The duration of the counter ends. Instead of blocking the sword aimed at his head, he charges forward.

[You have activated Dodge.]

The attack veers off course and strikes Taesan's shoulder. A bruise forms on Ratran's chest.

[You dealt 43 damage.] [Ratran received 45 damage.]

Damage exchange takes place. A smile forms at the corner of Ratran's mouth. He roughly draws his greatsword.

[Ratran has activated Strong Strike.]

Strong Strike. Cannot be dodged with a dodge.

Taesan creates distance. The sword narrowly misses his nose and then swiftly kicks Ratran's leg.

[You have activated Accelerate.]

In an instant, he plunges towards Ratran at double speed. He thrusts the sword into Ratran's chest, who hasn't yet recovered from his previous swing.

[56 damage to Ratran.]

Crash!

Impressed, Ratran pushes Taesan away. 

"You use skills like swordsmanship."

Perfectly timing and matching every move as if it were second nature, activating without any gaps. Truly, it was an ideal use.
"Half a lifetime spent."

Taesan replies as he brings down his sword. Ratran deflects it with a swing.

[Ratran has activated Strong Strike.] [You have activated Strong Strike.]

Clang!

Both have used Strong Strike. The one who used more mana and skill wins.

Taesan presses Ratran with his strikes and cuts him down.

There was no depletion of strength. Mana is also plentiful. If caught, level up and fully recover.

No need to save now. Taesan, who made the decision, pushed forward. He stabs with the sword, strikes with the shield, and pushes with his shoulder.

"Ah!"

Ratran also responds. He strikes with the handle of the greatsword and pressures with his massive body. Taesan's health drops rapidly, but Ratran's decreases even faster.

He deflects Ratran's swinging weapon.

Clang!

"Ugh!"

Effect of the Seal. Ratran's arm rises sharply. He drives the sword into his chest.

[You have activated Accelerate.]

He charges forward. Accelerate is judged even in close contact. Ratran is pushed back by Taesan's strength. Finally, he crashes into the wall.

Kwoong!
"Cough!"

Ratran vomits blood. Taesan draws his sword and steps back.

The battle is over.

Regret fills Ratran's face.

"I should have fought purely. Trying half-heartedly only led to losses."

If Ratran had fought purely with swordsmanship and strong strikes, without using Charge and Rage, it would have taken more time.

But Taesan knew all the skills, so he could easily counter.

That's why it was actually simpler.

"Still, it was a satisfactory fight. This is enough of an honorable death."

Ratran throws a bead with a joyful laugh.

"Thank you. It's a reward for the victor."

The vitality fades from Ratran's face.

"Go now, warrior. Seek victory..."

Ratran closes his mouth.

His soul departs from his body.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You have defeated the boss on the 5th floor. You obtained the basic reward [Splendid Ornamental Sword]. You have discovered the hidden element on the 5th floor. You obtained the reward [???]. Your level has increased. You have acquired the Rune of Strength. Valtazaha is greatly pleased."

---

Victory achieved.

The 5th floor is now complete. You have cleared Valtazaha's trial.

In response, the system window appeared in abundance. Taesan began organizing it methodically.

First, the level-up rewards: Health +30, Strength +7, Agility +5, Mana +4. Notably, there was a noticeable increase in strength and health, likely due to facing orcs predominantly.

Next, the rewards for defeating archenemies: Health +20, Strength +5, Agility +5.

Spiritual elevation rewards include Health +10, Strength +6, Agility +4, Mana +3.

Lastly, fueled by the desire for victory, Health +20, Strength +4, Agility +4.

In total: Health 80, Strength 22, Agility 18, Mana 7. It was an unbelievable increase gained from just one victory.

Furthermore, Ratran is a named enemy who uses skills. The spiritual elevation triggered once again.

"Your spiritual elevation has been triggered. Proficiency in Thunderous Strike increases by 5%." "Your spiritual elevation has been triggered. You have obtained the special activation skill [Charge]."

Proficiency in Thunderous Strike has increased, and you have also gained the Charge skill.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

[Special Activation Skill: Charge] [Mana Cost: 4] [Proficiency: 1%] [Can enhance the power of specific skills.]

Brief description. It could be used when combined with other skills. It gradually became useful from the middle stages.

And the basic reward from the 5th floor.

[Splendid Ornamental Sword] [Attack +5] [Ornamental sword. Unnecessarily sharp.]

"Oh?"

Attack +5. Comparable to Rakiratas's sword. Moreover, its size is small as a one-handed sword.

In other words, it can be wielded in both hands.

"Not bad."

Honestly, right now, there isn't much need for a large shield. It was more advantageous to wield two swords to increase attack power and kill faster.

Satisfied, Taesan checked the other rewards.

The secret reward is postponed. Typically, such things should be checked last.

Since earlier, there had been an impatient presence due to not receiving rewards.

[Valtazaha is greatly pleased. He wishes to give you appropriate rewards.]

It seemed that even the system window was pleased. The ghost murmured as if it were absurd.

"Yeah, he must be pleased. Who else could pull this off?"

Monsters in the 5th floor whose stats exceed 100 in all aspects.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

If it weren't for Taesan, I would have died without clearing the 4th floor.

[Taesan's interference area has decreased.] [Taesan rewards you. You receive [Belt of Fortitude].] [You have cleared the reinforced trial. Additional rewards follow.] [You have obtained the special passive skill [Proof of Victory].] [Taesan proposes the Apostle's Contract to you.]

"No thanks."

Taesan promptly refused. Taesan seemed rather pleased instead.

[Taesan is delighted with your choice.]

It seemed as if missing meat looked larger, and it was easy for an acknowledged person to accept it.

[Taesan awaits the next meeting.] [Received title [Acknowledged One].]

The imposing presence departed. The ghost breathed softly, and Taesan began to verify.

[Belt of Fortitude] [Attack +3] [Defense +3] [Recovers 5 HP and MP after each victory.] [A belt bestowed only upon those acknowledged by Taesan.]

"Indeed, very nice."
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

A belt. It was equipment that could only be obtained much later. Many of them were hard to come by, often with mediocre stats.

Taesan put on the belt with a satisfied expression. The gods were beings who gave definite rewards. The effort was worth it.

And the passive skill that activates constantly. Proof of Victory.

[Special passive skill: Proof of Victory] [Proficiency: 1%] [You have overcome and proven your strength. Choose one stat to continuously increase.]

"Does it mean my stats increase with every victory?"

The exact details needed confirmation, but it seemed to imply that. If so, the skill to choose was already decided.

"Mana."

[Proof of Victory has been designated to mana.]

More mana was better. While other players might not understand, for Taesan, mana was more important than strength or intelligence.

The exact proportion needed verification, but it was a guaranteed win. Skills that increased automatically without needing attention were always right.

And the reward for the secret room.

As the maze changed, a chest was placed in the boss room.

Inside lay a small dagger.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

[Blade of Self-Harm] [A reverse-edged sword that only hurts oneself.] [Can consume health to store.] [Health 0/500]

"Is it some kind of potion?"

Taesan immediately slashed his forearm. The blood that gushed out was quickly absorbed into the blade.

[Health 20/500]

20 health consumed. 20 health restored. It's a 1:1 ratio. Considering the loss, this is a top-tier item.

If stocked up beforehand, it could prove useful in emergencies.

The reward from the secret room was satisfying enough.

He had been checking the rewards for quite some time.

But it wasn't over yet.

There were still many rewards left. Taesan examined the last rune of strength that Ratran had given him.
