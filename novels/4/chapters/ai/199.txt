Chapter 200

200. 45th floor (1)

Tai Shan looked up at the sky.

There was still a huge crack in the sky.

But nothing came out of it.

The giant monster that he had seen in his previous life was nowhere to be seen.

That was the end. The trial of Aphrodite was over.

But he was not going back to the labyrinth yet.

"What's up?"

"Nothing."

Ita-yeon approached him and asked. Tai Shan replied calmly.

She smiled slightly.

"People are getting noisy."

"That's to be expected."

The power Tai Shan showed was a completely different kind of power from what he had shown before. It was enough to make people astonished and bewildered.

"And that's...... the same for me too."

Ita-yeon looked at him with a complex gaze.

She realized that the power Tai Shan showed was the same as the power of the monsters she had met in the labyrinth.

"Are you sure......"

"What's the matter with you?"

Tai Shan said. Her pupils trembled greatly.

"...I thought so, but it's like that too. It's right, isn't it?"
Here is the translation of the text:

She nodded silently.

"That's right. That was... correct."

She smiled wistfully.

"Can I ask how many times it happened?"

"Technically, it was the second time."

The past life and the present life. The Ji mode and the lonely mode. It happened only twice.

"The second time... just that much."

Lee Taeyeon laughed weakly.

"At first, I'm... grateful. Thanks to you, I was able to survive."

She sat on the floor, looking depressed, and hugged her legs.

"In reality, I was a monster that needed to be defeated."

Tae-san was S-grade, and she was S-grade as well. They took turns taking care of each other.

And Tae-san defeated the two S-grade monsters and came to help Lee Taeyeon.

But she couldn't even make a decent attack on the monster.

"I'm... a coward."

She bit her lips.

She didn't win against the monster due to her lack of ability, but there was a bigger problem.

She didn't take risks.

She only tried to fight in the safest way possible. Therefore, she couldn't show her movements and was always stuck in a state of hesitation. This drained her strength.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I'm going to rely on others. Honestly, I'll say it. When you came, I was too happy. I thought that even if we didn't fight, we could get along. I was going to compensate and take what I should have, and only pursue my own life.

She pours out what she had deep in her heart.

"What if the situation between us had changed?"

If she had been weak and timid, she would have received no expectations and been protected as if she was a natural part of the family.

And if the Tai Shan had been alone, she would have had even stronger and more outstanding power.

It was a perfect picture.

In reality, the Tai Shan chose to be alone, and she even obtained black magic that she had never gotten before, and defeated the demon with ease. Since there is evidence, her emotions became even darker.

"All of them expect me, but I can't fulfill their expectations. Look at you. I thought I couldn't beat the monster you are, but I was able to do it easily. What I did was meaningless. What is my value? What does it mean?"

She smiled wryly.

"......I'm sorry. You must be surprised. It's just nonsense."

"It's not surprising at all. I already knew."

"What?"

"That you have such feelings yourself."

Tai Shan said with a stern expression."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Can't you remember that I've talked to you the longest? How could you not know?"

"Uh, uh?"

"I think I've hidden it, but it's not something that can be hidden."

Ityeon's mind is weak compared to the power she possesses.

The hatred she harbored deep in her heart towards herself. The burden of expectation. She wanted to throw everything away and run, but she couldn't.

She couldn't tell anyone about it either. Because she is stronger than anyone and a superior player in solo mode. Everyone expects a lot from her.

Similarly, she couldn't tell Tae-san about it. She was afraid that he would be disappointed in her, or that he would look down on her even though he was in a calm mode.

She was hiding it by collecting luxurious decorations. She said she was fine, that she had the leisure to collect such things.

However, her emotions continued to show through in her conversation with Tae-san.

"Now I understand."

The reason Ityeon gave him the Orb of Urvo's wisdom.

She was afraid.
(Note: I assume "이태연" is a character's name, and "태산" is another character's name. Please let me know if I'm correct.)
Here is the translation of the text:

No matter how many times she goes back in time, she has to lower her solo mode to meet everyone's expectations again.

She couldn't even choose easy mode, let alone solo mode, because the Earth would have been destroyed if she didn't. She couldn't have become that kind of person.

I want to run away.

But I can't leave it alone.

Under the relentless pressure, Taeyeon made a choice.

Not for herself, but for Tae-san.

The woman who was afraid of death entrusted the sacred stone to Tae-san, the one who could save the Earth.

Tae-san laughed as he watched Taeyeon's confused expression.

"I didn't think you could say something like that."

In his previous life, he had no leisure. Therefore, he didn't notice her emotions properly, and even if he had noticed, he wouldn't have paid attention to it.

So he can't tell this to the current Taeyeon. Because she is currently receiving Tae-san's help, following his advice, and descending into the labyrinth. From the start, it was different, so Tae-san's words wouldn't have reached her.

Therefore, this message can only be received by her, who is standing in front of him now.
Here is the translation of the text:

Right now, Taesan is standing in front of him, a kind of fake that has been implemented by God, taking time into consideration. But Taesan still wants to say this to him.

"You've done well. Enough. You've led us here and got us this far. If you weren't here, it would be impossible."

That's not a lie. Taesan's abnormal stats are suitable for defeating a small number of monsters, but he's weak against a large number of enemies. If it weren't for Taesan, they would have perished or survived with fewer numbers.

"So take care of yourself. Don't reproach yourself."

"...?"

Taesan's eyes widened in amazement. He stuttered and asked, "Do you not like me? You've left me with all the responsibility, haven't you?"

"Not really?"

Taesan shrugged his shoulders. Taesan burst into a forced laugh.

"What's the point? I'm the only one who's struggling. I'm the only one thinking, the only one deciding, and the only one choosing..."

She threw her head back and laughed. Soon, tears welled up in her eyes.

"Thank you, Taesan."

The world distorted after that sentence.

When he came to his senses, he found himself back in the labyrinth again.

"Is that the end of the story you wanted to tell?"

Afrodia whispered softly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Are you going to wait for me?"

[It seemed like there would be something to talk about with that woman. Yes, it's true. Are you happy?]

"I'm not satisfied, but it's okay."

There were many things she could have asked me about. For example, the origin of the treasure, how many times she had been there, and other questions.

The answers were still unknown.

[Secrets are valuable when they're hidden. Once you've got the truth, you're bound to get bored and die.]

Aphrodite spoke calmly.

[Not knowing something can also be fun. But it was harder to keep my composure than you might think. After all, the time I've spent with you is a reward for what you've shown me, so I'm satisfied.]

"I'm grateful for that."

[And this isn't the only opportunity. We'll meet again someday.]

As Aphrodite said, the gods could have even twisted time to summon her.

This meant that it was possible to meet Taeyeon again in the future.

Aphrodite laughed.

[It was very fun.]
Here is the translation of the text:

A voice filled with laughter rang out.

[Is this the flow of things? Good stuff.]

"Can Aphrodite not know?"

[You have gone back in time, and you have used something that a snake has vomited. But I don't know what happened there.]

Aphrodite's pleasant laughter kept flowing out.

[Is this so? Those guys are interested in the reason, and I understand.]

The divine gaze turned to Taesan.

[You are special. It's very much, to the extent that even we are surprised.]

"That's right."

[Let's give you a reward first.]

The divine power spread throughout the half.

[You have perfectly cleared my trial. You have won against your own despair. So, take this first.]

The divine energy flowed into Taesan from Aphrodite.

It settled in Taesan's heart, becoming a part of him.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Your special skill [Savior's Wrath [Rakiratas]] has transformed into special skill [Savior's Wrath [Mixed Energy]]. He may not like it, but... I've strengthened the power of the Savior within you. You'll be able to use it for a longer and stronger duration than before."

"Thank you."

Tai Shan bowed his head slightly.

The Savior's Wrath was an essential skill for the upcoming battle. Since the duration of the skill has increased, this must be the reason for the ordeal.

"And this too is a gift."

A small, crimson-colored nucleus from Aphrodia's fingertips merged with Tai Shan.

"You have obtained the special skill [Seed of Despair]. It has taken root within you. When the time comes, it will bloom, and I think you'll be satisfied."

Aphrodia did not stop there and clenched her fist. When she opened her fist, a small arrowhead was revealed.

"You have obtained the Arrow of Despair. The Arrow of Despair, which collects many despairs. [Attack power + 60] It randomly inflicts abnormal states and mental judgments on those hit. However, it is impossible to succeed in this judgment unless the person has a certain level of mental strength and power."

It seemed that Tai Shan could embed the arrow within his own arrow.
Here is the translation of the text:

The attacking power was quite high and effective, and I thought it was a reward worthy of the gods. The Taesan was thrilled and began to draw an arrow.

[I'll be satisfied with this.]

"Very much so. Thank you."

Even if I put aside the other things, I didn't expect to touch the Saodohwa. It was much better than receiving dozens of equipment to strengthen one thing.

[It's a good thing I saw. I can do this much.]

There was a sense of satisfaction overflowing from Aphrodite's voice.

[Honestly, I was worried when the area became greatly reduced, but... since I saw something so entertaining, I'll accept it.]

He suddenly burst out laughing.

[The monsters of the divine realm possess a territory that even the mortal world cannot approach. You, who have been called a saint, are just a little bit removed from the mortal world. How pitiful. A being that was no more than a mortal in the past has fought against someone like that to some extent.]

It seems he was talking about his previous life's Taesan. He fought against the saints, but soon lost, so...
Here is the translation of the text:

[It was fun. Kang Tae-san. I've got something to brag about to those guys. It's not that I'm rewarding them, but... Ask me one thing. I'll answer your curious question.]

A few things popped up in Tae-san's mind after Aphrodite's words, and he organized them into one.

"What's the origin of the gemstone that the snake spat out?"

It was the gemstone of Ur-boros, an item that could turn back time.

Even the ghost didn't know about it, so it must be obtained from a deep place.

[He's asking that, isn't he?]

Aphrodite smiled faintly.

[What a remarkable human! A person who judged us as worthless and thought we couldn't obtain it has actually obtained it. Honestly, I'm surprised. It's about your capabilities.]

The person he's talking about is Lee Tae-yeon.

Aphrodite said.

[The 91st floor. The world swallowed by the snake. You'll find out when you get there.]

After Aphrodite's words, his presence began to fade away.

[And then.]

Aphrodite suddenly said, as if remembering something.

[Valencia. A madman who pursues great spirit. Are you receiving a quest from him?]

Tae-san nodded.

[Madmen always lose their senses and go wild. Just remember that.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"I know."

With that, Aphrodite disappeared.

Taesan gazed blankly at the altar, then sat down.

* * *

There were some questions raised by Aphrodite's words, but it was not a problem that could be solved by him at this moment. He had to meet the gods directly to ask.

There was something that had to be done before that.

He had obtained and received many things while breaking through the trials, and he needed time to sort them out one by one.

First was the transformation of the apostles.

[SPECIAL ACTIVATION SKILL: Apostolic Transformation [Mixed Divine Essence]] [The power of the god of struggle and death, bestowed upon him for the first time after his birth. This power is mixed with that of another god. For 1 hour, he gains a portion of the power of the apostles. This skill cannot be used for a day after activation.]

"Ah."

Taesan couldn't help but gasp in amazement.

The apostolic transformation could only be used for 20 minutes. Therefore, against enemies who could only be defeated in battle, it was necessary to end the battle within 20 minutes, which was a significant drawback.

However, the duration of the apostolic transformation has now become 1 hour.
Here is the translation of the text:

It meant that one didn't have to fight desperately against time anymore.

"Ah, good."

[I've changed it firmly. And I think Aphrodia would like you too.]

The ghost who had been silent until then opened its mouth.

Tae-san gazed at him calmly. The ghost turned around, looking around.

[What... I have a general idea of what's going on. What kind of trial came about and what it's all about, I'll tell you.]

The ghost spoke calmly.

[But I won't ask that first. Once everything is settled, and if I'm willing to talk, I'll tell you. I'll wait.]

"Alright."

The ghost had many questions too.

Who was Lee Tae-yeon? Whether the information about the solo mode she mentioned was true? How time was mixed up like that.

But he didn't ask.

Perhaps it was out of consideration for Tae-san. Tae-san was grateful in his heart and confirmed what Aphrodia had given him.

He put on the arrowhead given by him as a symbol of his own self.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The Arrow of Despair that has its own will] [An arrow that moves on its own to protect its owner. It has its own will and can move within a certain range, but cannot exceed it.] [Current owner: Kang Tae-san] [The user's level is insufficient. Attack power: 1] [The arrowhead of despair is attached, increasing attack power by 60.] [It inflicts abnormal status and mental judgment on the hit enemy.]

Now, three of the four arrows have been imbued with attack power and effects. This should be enough to bring about a significant change in combat.

And the skill given by him.

[Special activation skill: The Seed of Despair] [Consumes 500 mana] [Proficiency: 1%] [Whenever enemies feel despair towards you, you can consume that emotion and grow the seed. When the time is right, the seed will bloom.]

"Is this a growth-type skill?"

It seemed to have no effect at first. It will only be useful after increasing proficiency through repeated use.

I've checked all the rewards given by Aphrodia.

Now was the time to check the skills obtained by clearing the trials.

[Special permanent activation skill: Mind Split] [Proficiency: 1%] [You can simultaneously see, do, and think about many things. However, the limit on the number of things you can do is still unknown.]

"Is this a multitasking skill?"
Here is the translation:

"It was exactly as explained. I tried moving each hand to do different things, just for the sake of testing. And then, my hands moved much more smoothly, as if I had a different body.

It was a skill that I could use to some extent.

[SPECIAL SKILL: Sprouting Curse Branch] [Proficiency: 1%] [It spreads the curse branch that typifies your soul, engulfing the world. If your soul level is low or the total amount is insufficient, the skill will activate using life force as collateral.]

"This is useless."

Tae-san immediately gave up on the skill.

Even using the twisted soul calibration was a heavy burden. But there was a sentence that said it consumed life force openly.

I would probably die before I could see the proper effect.

Even if I used it, it would be a long time later, after I had accumulated sufficient soul power.

As I broke the trial, my proficiency in the skills I possessed also increased significantly. My ability sword, Ilrak's martial arts, and magical proficiency also rose noticeably, and the content of many skills underwent changes.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Special Active Skill: Continuous Battle] [Proficiency: 80%] [I can sustain a long battle without feeling tired. My condition is always at its best, and I can move endlessly without reaching my physical limits.]

My Continuous Battle skill has reached 80%. The changed content was exactly as described in the skill.

From now on, I won't feel tired in battle, and I won't be limited by my physical boundaries. It's a small but definite improvement.

My proficiency in throwing skills has also approached 90%. It won't be long before I reach 100%.

And my Counter skill has also undergone a change.

[Special Active Skill: Counter] [Mana consumption: 5] [Proficiency: 60%] [I counterattack against an enemy's attack, dealing a huge amount of damage. I can also counterattack against attacks that cannot be countered, and projectiles as well.]

I've used this skill frequently in various battles, so I was able to reach 60% proficiency faster than expected.

The effect is that I can also counter projectiles. According to my memories, when I activate the Counter skill against incoming arrows and the like, I can return them at the same speed and force to the enemy.

This skill is useful on its own, but when combined with the effects of the Ability Sword, it will likely become an even more outstanding skill.
Here is the translation of the text:

Consecutive attacks have also undergone changes in their content. The same was true for the strong assault.

[SPECIAL SKILL: Consecutive Attack] [MANA COST: 3] [SKILL LEVEL: 22%] [Uses the next attack twice, with slightly increased damage. Time and space constraints do not apply.] [SPECIAL SKILL: Strong Assault] [MANA COST: ?] [SKILL LEVEL: 23%] [Uses the next attack even stronger.]

The accumulated effects have exploded in a change. It has definitely become stronger before clearing the ordeal.

The Taesan was satisfied and broke through another layer.

Valencia led the way to the place she learned about, gathered the core of emotions, and obtained secret rewards and handled the boss.

Then, she went up another layer and handed the core to Valencia.

"Ah, okay! Not much left! Give me even stronger emotions!"

He exclaimed, his eyes wide open.

Valencia was getting more and more excited as Taesan brought her emotions.

[I should be careful, it seems.]

"I know."

Taesan replied and went back down another layer.
Here is the translation of the text:

The reward for the 44th floor was mostly related to black magic items. Since there was nothing suitable for Taesan to wear, he gave it to Masin.

[That's enough for now.]

Although Taesan offered a considerable amount of Contribution Points, Masin did not grant him a new skill. However, Taesan was still optimistic, thinking that it would lead to a really good skill.

Taesan arrived at the 45th floor.

[It's already halfway.]

Despite the middle-level trial, he moved at a very fast pace.

[Start of the 45th floor quest.] [Defeat the boss of the 45th floor and pass through.] [Reward: Green Lotus Root] [Secret reward: ???]

The monsters of the 45th floor were just empty shells with only the feeling of helplessness left.

Taesan continued to move forward. First, he obtained the core that Valencia told him to get and found the secret room.

Crack.

He broke the trap and obtained the reward of the secret room.

[A statue made of gems] [It is extremely valuable and its value is exceptional. It's likely to be sold at a very high price at the shop.]

Although Taesan obtained the secret room's reward, he did not leave immediately.

[You have activated scouting.]

The scouting swept through the room, but there was nothing unusual.

"Is this really it?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Taeyeon said that there was a secret room on the 45th floor. And inside that room, there was another hidden room, she said.

That place was hidden in a special way, so it couldn't be detected even with skills, she said.

"'Let's go see.'"

Taesan thought back to what Taeyeon had said and examined the wall. Then, she found a small hole.

She pressed the wall with her knife.

Click.

Suddenly, a sound of something fitting into place echoed from somewhere. Taesan searched the walls again and found the new hole.

Click.

When she pressed the wall again, the same sound echoed from somewhere.

After repeating this process five times, Taesan let out a sigh.

"What kind of trick did you use to find this?"

It didn't come out through reconnaissance. It meant that she had found all the holes without any tricks or means.

Although Taeyeon was definitely a coward, she was excellent at finding ways and means.

Click.

The sound of something fitting into place echoed, and a corridor appeared at the end of the secret room.
