108. 22nd Floor. God of Proof, Pafsha (1)

[Pafsha. The god of self-proving.]

The ghost began to explain.

"Quite literally a god. Prove yourself. Show what you've built. That's the god who gives such trials. Last time, I was on a deeper floor, but I've come up here."

"What kind of trial is it?"

"I haven't received one."

It was an unexpected statement. Being confident in their own abilities, the ghost naturally assumed they would receive one. Taesan asked.

"Is it difficult?"

"It's not difficult per se... in terms of clearance rate, it's actually a very easy trial. But it's quite ambiguous."

The ghost said with an uneasy tone.

"Most adventurers I remember have undergone Pafsha's trial. And they've all cleared it."

This too was unexpected. Taesan frowned.

"All of them?"

"Yes, even those who weren't exceptional, those close to average, they all succeeded."

"That's... strange."

In fact, it's impossible.
Here's the translation:

A trial from the gods is an unmatched existence descending for their own pleasure. They do not consider ordinary adventurers.

While the majority may be able to clear it, not everyone can. That has been Taesan's experience of the trials he has seen so far.

"That's the strange part. And some of those who cleared the trials changed a bit. Their mannerisms and behaviors became different."

"...Doppelgangers?"

The most popular monster that mimics appearances. If they changed after clearing the trial, one could only think in that direction. However, the ghost denied it.

"Doppelgangers mimic speech, mannerisms, and behavior perfectly. But those who broke the trial showed a difference. They acted as if they were the real deal. We suspected them as strange, but found no anomalies."

"So they're not doppelgangers."

"They're not. But we called those who changed like that 'fakes.'"

Not real. That was what they thought.

"What happened to the fakes?"
Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

[It was all sorts. Some went deep into the labyrinth, others died a little further down, and there were those who became guides of sin and lingered in their hierarchy. Most met the ordinary end of adventurers.]

That too was a strange tale.

If the impostors were mimicking adventurers, they would have tried to survive by any means necessary. The goal of descending into the labyrinth belonged to the adventurer swallowed up, not the impostor's objective.

Yet the impostors died descending into the labyrinth like real adventurers.

"So they weren't accepted?"

[It's unclear. It can't be measured by the ratio of success and failure, and the information from survivors isn't reliable either. I had no intention of being indiscriminate.]

Taesan looked towards Pavsha's altar.

The energy flowing from there carried a single intent.

Prove yourself.

"What did those who returned say?"

[Their own proof. That's the end of it.]

Taesan pondered.

There was no information at all. It was an unknown trial. There was a reason the ghost had refused. It was akin to walking a cliff edge in invisible fog.

But Taesan had one certainty.

'The gods here seek strength on my level.'

If that's the case, then the trial of the gods is likely suited to Taesan as well.

Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

Pavsha was not a god of death. It was not expected of him to desire his death like Raki Latast.

Taesan placed his hand on the altar.

"[Are you going to...?]"

"I have no intention of removing it now."

"Well... They won't give you a trial that could kill you."

The ghost seemed indifferent, as if it had also thought so.

"[Pavsha's altar] [An altar created by those who serve Pavsha. It is a passage connected to the gods. Pavsha can exert influence through this place.] [Subquest Start] [Pavsha wants to test you, who have come to his altar. If you accept, the trial will come to you. If you overcome it, there will be a reward.] [Reward: Determined by Pavsha based on your achievements.]

"I accept."

With acceptance, darkness enveloped Taesan.

When his sight returned, he found himself in a vast empty space of darkness.

It wasn't particularly large, about the size of three rooms in a labyrinth combined. If he decided to move with determination, he could reach the end in just a second.

In the middle of such a space, darkness began to coalesce. It formed arms, legs, and gradually took on the shape of a face.

"Hmm."

Taesan frowned.

"It's like a doppelganger."

--- 

This translation captures the meaning and nuances of the original Korean text.
A figure resembling Taesan appeared in front of Taesan. At the same time, a quest window appeared.

[Prove yourself.]

* * *

It wasn't a heightened trial. It meant only one thing.

It meant a trial that would adapt to the user.

Taesan calmly drew his weapon as he faced his doppelganger.

Fight and defeat someone imitating yourself. It wasn't an uncommon story in creations on Earth. Out of ten, two or three might show up.

Taesan spared his doppelganger.

Hair that sways. A face close to expressionless.

The watching ghost exclaimed in admiration.

[It's perfectly identical. Like a complete mirror?]

"I'm not sure."

[It looks that way when you see yourself. It's completely the same. The face, height, build, and even the clothing.]

There was no visible difference whatsoever.

Among Taesan's equipment were quite a few good items. The weapon he was currently using was just a sword given as a reward by the ghost, and one of the rings was worth tens of thousands of gold.

The doppelganger also had those equipments. It was nothing difficult for a god's trial to replicate that much.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

Then what about skills? Does he have the skills that I possess? The black magic bestowed by the wizard and the spells permitted by the god of magic, does he possess those as well?

While Taesan pondered, his doppelganger stared at him expressionlessly.

First, let's assess his level. Taesan swung his sword.

And the doppelganger moved.

[The doppelganger activated Strong Strike.]

Clang.

Taesan's sword was pushed back. Taesan quickly attempted to slip past with the Dance of No Return.

At that moment, the doppelganger's sword also changed. It began to strike Taesan like a storm.

"What!"

The first sword. Wolf's Fang.

The doppelganger was displaying the swordsmanship taught by the ghost.

"Oh."

Taesan grinned. His sword began to move. Just like the doppelganger, the Wolf's Fang swordsmanship unfolded.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The blades clashed, creating a tumultuous sound. With the final clash, Taesan distanced himself.

"Do you also possess the skill?"

"...This is insulting to my pride. A deity's doppelganger having my swordsmanship?"

"If you put it that way, it's embarrassing."

The doppelganger revealed this and raised its sword.

"I'm about to become the real one!"

The doppelganger rushed forward.
Here is the English translation:

---

Taesan blocked each attack one by one and slowly stepped back. The doppelganger, judging itself advantageous, burst into laughter.

"Die! Your soul is mine!"

The doppelganger shouted fiercely as it moved its sword. Frost arrows occasionally aimed at Taesan's entire body.

Taesan lightly maneuvered his dual swords. He deflected the doppelganger's sword and twisted the trajectory of the frost arrows.

He countered both magical and sword attacks with just swordsmanship alone. The doppelganger, realizing belatedly that something was amiss, hesitated.

Taesan looked down at the doppelganger with indifferent eyes.

"Not much of a challenge."

[Just an ordinary Level 22 adventurer.]

Even with the same skills and stats, differences clearly existed depending on the user. If Taesan had Itaeyeon's stats and skills right now, he could use them more effectively.

The doppelganger before him clearly possessed his stats and skills, but its utilization was hopelessly crude. The ghost murmured as if finding it interesting.

"So, is the concept to kill and take the soul to become the real one? Interesting. So that's why the personality changed. Since the soul is real, there was no way to find out. It was a trial of this sort of feeling. I wonder if I could have taken it too?"


Actually, it wasn't an easy trial. "Average level" meant literally the average level of the Alone Mode. If we just look at skill, he'd likely be stronger than Itaeyeon of the 22nd floor.

However, Taesan was quite different from the norm. The doppelganger hesitated and stepped back.

Instead of pursuing, Taesan gazed at the darkly shimmering space.

A divine trial had to meet the level of a god's liking. At least at his current level, it didn't seem like it would please Pavsha.

As Taesan expected, the doppelganger's body trembled greatly for a moment.

[Pavsha's authority manifests. At the cost of reduced interference from Pavsha's domain.] [Pavsha proposes an enhanced trial to you.]

Unlike with Rakyratas, this was in the form of a proposal. Taesan nodded his head.

[Pavsha is pleased.] [A separate soul is imbued in the doppelganger's body.]

Something spiritual descended upon the doppelganger in the dark space. The doppelganger's body trembled, then slowly exhaled a deep breath.

"Hoo!"

The atmosphere changed. It had Taesan's face, but a completely different expression. Taesan frowned.

"This feels unpleasant."

Someone was wearing his skin. Though it was a doppelganger, it didn't feel good.
"Long time no see, labyrinth. Nice to meet you, adventurer."

The doppelganger grinned widely as it gripped the sword. It held the sword in an unusual reverse grip stance.

"What brings you here?"

It murmured as if a ghostly presence had surfaced. The soul imbued in the doppelganger introduced itself.

"I am Malisten, apostle of the great Pavsha. A traveler of the depths."

---

An adventurer who accepted the apostle of a god. It was the first time seeing it in reality.

Considering that gods propose apostleship to those who greatly surpass the average, it meant they were once considerably strong in their lifetime. The ghost seemed taken aback, as if recognizing something.

"Where did you go to become an apostle?"

"Hooh?"

Malisten belatedly realized the presence of the ghost and looked surprised.

"Hero? Are you here?"

Examining the ghost's appearance, Malisten realized.

"No, it's different. You're already dead? If you didn't conquer it, there's really no one to hope for."

"I didn't die descending the labyrinth. I died at the hands of others."

"...Guides of sin. So it was them."
Malisten frowned.

"You're insane. If I kill you, they won't be able to descend either."

"So you're still complaining. Good for you," the ghost chuckled. Taesan clicked his tongue.

"Enough with the cryptic talk between you two. Explain who you are."

"Sorry. I was someone who descended the labyrinth around the same time as me. Not affiliated with the Guides of Sin."

"They didn't sit well with me. Weaklings, devoid of spirit," Malisten snorted. His words implied his strength was such that even the Guides of Sin dared not touch him.

"You were an adventurer who surpassed the 70th floor. Used dual swords like you, but one was wielded in reverse. Focused more on swordsmanship than skills."

"Well, now I'm just a slave-turned-apostle. No regrets though. Pavsha is surprisingly kind to possessions."

Malisten shrugged, looking at Taesan.

"Seems like even heroes get tied down. Surprising. I thought you'd have chosen death."
[Originally, that would have been the case. But there was something irritating.]

"Hmm. I'm curious, but... let's stop the conversation here. The protagonist seems bored."

Malisten's eyes quickly dimmed. He stared into empty space as if checking his stats screen. After a moment, he frowned.

"...Which floor are we on?"

[22nd floor.]

"The 22nd floor?"

Shock spread across Malisten's face.

"The numbers exceed 30 floors..."

[This guy is a strange one.]

"Ah, really."

Malisten glanced at Taesan with a look of wonder. Taesan adjusted his posture.

Slowly, he began to guess what Pavsha's enhanced trial might be.

To defeat his apostle who possessed his stats and skills. That seemed to be the essence of the trial.
