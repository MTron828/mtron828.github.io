**Episode 434**

434. 85th Floor, The Ash-Colored Woman. Sosiet Gardenia (2)

Return to Earth.

It was already the seventh time. As soon as the system window opened, chaos erupted in the community. People from each country started discussing with each other.

[Oliver Kan[Hard]: This time, all players on Earth will gather together.] [Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard]: The possibility is high.] [Daniel Darmon[Hard]: Hmm... I don't have a good feeling about this.]

In the sixth return, players gathered in three groups: Europe, America, and Asia. Next, it's highly likely that all players on Earth will gather together.

Anxiety and trembling accompanied the players. But the Asian players were not afraid.

They had confidence. They believed they would win.

[Baek Sang-hoon[Normal]: Lord Taesan is here!] [Gulshan Devaiah[Normal]: If Lord Taesan is here, we can win! We won't lose!]

They were shouting Lord Taesan's name. They showed absolute trust and faith in Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Oliver Kan[Hard]: ……We've actually seen your power before, but even then, you didn't show us your full strength. Can we, like them, come to worship you? It's hard to grasp.]

[Tae-san[Alone]: It's up to you to believe or not.]

Tae-san had never forced anyone to believe in him.

[Tae-san[Alone]: But what's wrong with worshiping? It might even be good for humanity.] [Oliver Kan[Hard]: You mean worshiping you?] [Tae-san[Alone]: Yes.]

The world that was on the brink of destruction because of God.

There, Tae-san received the faith of all living beings and became the master of the world.

It was also possible on Earth.

However, faith couldn't be forced. It required a genuine belief that came from the depths of their hearts, which was something he couldn't control.

Tae-san changed the subject.

[Tae-san[Alone]: How far have you all fallen?]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"One by one, they started to respond. Korean hard mode players had reached the mid-70th floor. In the US, they had reached the early 70th floor. Other countries were similar to the US.

Hard mode had reached the level that Taesan had expected.

The most important thing was the Alone mode.

[Kang Jun-hyuk[Alone]: I'm in the middle of the 50th floor.] [Amelia Airin[Alone]: I'm on the 64th floor.] [Kamal Hasan[Alone]: I've arrived at the late 40th floor.]

Other Alone mode players who hadn't stood out also started to speak up.

Overall, they had progressed deeper than Taesan had expected. At this rate, other Alone mode players could also become notable forces.

[Kang Taesan[Alone]: What's going on? It's much faster than I thought.] [Kang Jun-hyuk[Alone]: We shared information enthusiastically, and my sister's help was huge.] [Amelia Airin[Alone]: I also understood the labyrinth and went down, but someone knew more detailed parts than me. What kind of method did they use?] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Grinding. Whatever.]

Lee Tae-yeon posted a message."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Did I ask about the floor we've reached? I've already arrived at the 69th floor.]

[Amelia Airin [Alone]: ……You're ridiculously fast.]

Amelia grumbled. She believed that no one could compare to her unless it was Taesan. But at some point, Lee Tae-yeon started to climb rapidly and reached a deeper level than her.

However, she didn't feel emotional or jealous. Her confidence had already been shattered by Taesan. And she had also become quite close to Lee Tae-yeon through their frequent conversations.

She was simply curious.

[Amelia Airin [Alone]: There must be some change, but you won't answer me when I ask.]

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: It's just a difference in mindset. There's nothing special.]

[Gang Taesan [Alone]: It's the depth. You wouldn't care, would you.]

As she was now, she could probably break through the depth without Taesan's help and without much difficulty.

After that, many stories came out. Taesan shared some information about the floors they needed to conquer and the methods to acquire his skills.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Kang Jun-hyuk [Alone] :...I don't understand even if I listen again. Is it something that can be obtained?] [Kang Tae-san [Alone] : If you try hard, you can get a few things. Just don't get too attached.]

In reality, Lee Tae-yeon had obtained Philjung and addition. It was also possible for them.

Tae-san explained in detail the answers to their questions and the methods of acquisition, and then ended the community.

Tae-san was also preparing for his return, and he could bring Beldekgia and Diana back to Earth right away.

Diana was a strong person on the borderline, and Beldekgia was at the level of a high-ranking officer even if she was weakened. If the two were together, they would be of great help to many people's survival.

And black magic.

Tae-san had obtained the devil's domain and could create his own black magic.

Then, could he give that black magic to the players on Earth?

The possibility was sufficient, but since he had never tried it directly, it was difficult to say. However, if he succeeded, it would certainly become a great power.

'By the way.'

The labyrinth was separated by the gods.

Although the transcendent level was not affected by the separation, the NPCs were not. Beldekgia and Diana would still be left in someone else's labyrinth, unable to fulfill their wishes."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'll have to ask Balbam once."

The separated NPCs were wondering what would happen to them. I thought I'd check on them later.

Taesan had clearly learned the goals of the high priests. They must know the truth as well, so they wouldn't hide their desires anymore. They would aim for Taesan instead of the world.

And Taesan would emerge victorious against them.

Taesan headed back to the 85th floor. This time, the quest window for the 85th floor finally appeared.

The ghost who saw the quest window was taken aback.

[Huh?] [85th Floor Quest Start.] [Defeat Sosiet Gardenia.] [Reward: Fierce Broken Sword.] [Secret Reward: ???]

Sosiet Gardenia.

She, the guide of evil, was the quest target of the floor.

"Did Balbam change it?"

It seemed that the ordinary 85th floor could no longer stop Taesan, so the labyrinth's quest had been changed.

In other words, if it was Sosiet, it could be a floor quest suitable for the current Taesan.

[…She was a princess of the kingdom.]

The ghost whispered quietly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

One day, without any reason, the planet's god cursed the entire kingdom. Her father sacrificed himself to save the people, but it didn't change anything. Even a single dog was not spared and was killed.

The transcendent being is capricious. Harmon actually tried to annihilate the demon tribe of Vesgate without reason.

It seemed that a similar incident had occurred in Soshiet's world as well.

[She was the only one who survived with the help of others, but no one accepted her. Instead, they put a bounty on her head and tried to kill her. She barely survived and somehow entered the labyrinth. And that's where she met me.]

The ghost let out a sigh.

[I pitied her and felt a sense of camaraderie. After all, we were both royalty who had lost everything and were the only ones left alive. So I helped her, told her many things, and supported her. But... ]

"She killed you."

It was the first leader of the guide, who argued to kill the ghost within.

That was Soshiet Gardenia.

The ghost closed its mouth.

Taesan took a step forward.

He passed through the corridor, opened the door, and entered.

And there, Soshiet was dancing.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Wearing a white dress, she was waltzing alone without a partner. Her movements were filled with an undeniable elegance.

Taesan watched quietly. Before long, the waltz came to an end.

Sosiet smiled faintly and reached out her hand towards the ghost. It was a gentle and elegant smile, like a princess choosing her partner at a ball.

"Hello. My prince. Won't you dance with me?"

[The ash-colored woman, Sosiet Gardenia, appeared.]

* * *

[I'm sorry, but because of someone, I've become like this, and I can't dance.]

"Is that so? That's unfortunate."

Sosiet said, her expression genuinely regretful.

'You're all tangled up.'

Taesan, who possessed the will of all things, could sense it. Sosiet's emotions were mixed up in a way that even he couldn't fully read.

Resentment.

Longing.

Regret.

And.

[I was also blind, unable to see. I never thought you would betray me.]

"You're not the only one. I didn't think that way about myself either."

[Why did you betray me?]

The ghost spoke sharply.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You weren't like other guides, not crazy at all. You were very human.]

The other leaders all had twisted personalities. But Sosiet wasn't like that. That's why the ghost was close to her.

[I don't know what to say, but it seems like our relationship was pretty good.]

"Right."

Sosiet nodded. She wore a sad smile.

"Our relationship was good. Very good. But, well, Bardley."

Sosiet raised her finger and pointed at the ghost.

"You didn't know anything about me."

[…….]

"Hey, Bardley. You felt a sense of camaraderie with me, didn't you? But I didn't feel that way about you. On the contrary, I felt distant from you."

[What?]

"You felt camaraderie with me because I was the prince and princess of the destroyed kingdom. But excluding that one thing, we were too different."

Sosiet bit her lip.

"You told me to save the destroyed kingdom together. But I didn't want to save a kingdom or anything."

[……Why is that?]

"I was a cursed child, that's why."

Sosiet said it calmly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I was a child abandoned in the kingdom from birth. It was because I was born with a power that couldn't be accepted by the world. My existence was erased from the kingdom's records, and my mother, who gave birth to me, was executed. I survived only because my power had the potential to be useful in war.

The ghost's body trembled. Soshiet's eyes were filled with accusation.

"Is this a new story? Well, it's true. I lied to you. I, too, was loved by the kingdom. I was cursed, but everyone loved me."

[Was that a lie?]

"It wasn't my father who said he would sacrifice himself to save the people when the gods destroyed the kingdom. My father dragged me by the hair and threw me off a cliff, shouting, 'I'll offer this child, so please spare their lives.' I just modified the past a bit."

Soshiet snorted.

"The kingdom was destroyed, and I survived. But nothing changed. The entire world didn't accept my existence. I ran and ran and ran, and barely made it to the labyrinth. That much was true."

[……Why.]

After a moment of silence, the ghost asked in a tone of incomprehension.

[Why did you lie to me?]

"It's simple."

Soshiet smiled faintly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Isn't it human psychology to not want to reveal one's true self to the person they like?"

The ghost's body trembled uncontrollably, unlike anything seen before.

Soshiyet, who saw this, had an expression that said "I knew it would be like this."

"Did you really not know? I knew you would be like this. You were obsessed with your goal back then."

[You... liked me?]

"I loved you."

Soshiyet's voice was trembling like a girl experiencing her first love.

"That hasn't changed even now. You were the only one who held me, worried about me, trusted me, and looked only at me."

[Then why...]

The ghost barely managed to speak.

[Why did you kill me?]

"You weren't looking at me," Soshiyet said with a blank expression.

"Your goal was to save the ruined world, and to live with your beloved fiancée. Do you know how terrifying it was for me to pretend to be by your side, listening to her stories?"

Soshiyet gritted her teeth.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was no place for me in your life. After you cleared the labyrinth, I was just a girl who felt a sense of camaraderie with you. That's all I'll be remembered for. Even that will eventually be forgotten in happiness."

Her face was distorted.

"Bardley. You're everything to me."

The girl, who had never been loved by anyone and was hated by everyone, yearned for the affection she had received for the first time.

"I want to remain in you. I don't want to be forgotten in your memories. I want to be something that penetrates your life, not just a fragment of memory. How can I do that?"

[…….]

"I know I'm twisted. I also know I'm not right."

The girl smiled.

"But this is my love, Bardley."

* * *

The ghost didn't say a word.

It just closed its mouth and remained silent.

"It seems like I've achieved my goal, judging by your reaction. You won't be able to forget me. But... this is not enough."

Soshiet smiled crookedly.

"I want you to be filled with me, as if I exist."

Thud.

A dark energy began to emanate from her. It was neither magic nor the energy of a divine being.

It was a deep and profound energy that was entirely different from those.

Soshiet, dressed in a white dress, stood in the darkness.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I love you. More than anything in the world. This feeling is not a lie."

Rrrr!

And corpses rise from the dark energy.

Many knights and wizards appeared. Sosiet said in an unwavering tone.

"So, I'll fill everything of yours with me."

The corpses moved in unison.
