Chapter 381

381. 78th Floor, Library of the Gods (6)

"...What's that supposed to mean?"

Ainz couldn't understand what Taesan was saying.

"There's no such method. I've read all the books here and even asked the administrator of the labyrinth for a way."

It wasn't that he was just standing still. He had tried everything he could to revive the goddess.

But it was all in vain.

Even a transcendent being like himself couldn't touch the current state of the goddess.

However, Taesan continued to speak.

"There is a method that only I can do."

"...You're joking, right?"

Ainz's face contorted in anger. Just as he was about to say something, power burst out of Taesan's body.

It was black in color.

Reflexively, Ainz drew his sword and aimed it at Taesan's neck.

"Whoa!"

He belatedly realized that his opponent was Taesan and barely managed to stop himself, but his eyes were shaking greatly.

"What power is that?"

The power of the gods that had consumed the goddess.

It was emanating from Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan had contained divinity within him. The power of darkness and divinity were mixed, showcasing the power of ash.

Kiiiiing!

"Ah……."

Ainzhaar spoke in a voice.

The power Taesan was currently displaying was similar to the power of a goddess.

Taesan had crossed the boundary line.

"Do you believe me now?"

Ainzhaar stared at Taesan without responding.

* * *

Taesan waited for a little while.

After a few minutes, Ainzhaar approached Taesan with a serious expression.

He asked Taesan about the reason behind his acquisition of such power. Taesan answered his question.

About the Earth.

About the ancient gods who invaded the Earth.

And about the faith he received.

As the story progressed, astonishment and admiration continued to flow. Taesan finished his story.

"I possess the power of the ancient gods. And I also possess divinity. I can combine the two powers to wield another power."

"……Huh."

Ainzhaar let out a dry laugh.

"You... have experienced more than I thought."

"Do you believe that my power is possible?"

"Yes."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ainz hurled his head back. The power shown by Taesan was similar to that of the Goddess's state. However, it was much more stable and under Taesan's control.

In other words, it meant that the Goddess's state could also be controlled in some way.

The method was still unknown, but the possibility was enough. Taesan opened his mouth.

"Then I'll ask you. Why did the Goddess become like that?"

"……."

Ainz remained silent for a moment before opening his mouth.

"I should explain myself properly first."

Ainz grasped the golden sword. A strong power burst out from him, covering the space.

"I am Ainz. A devout follower of the great and loving Goddess, Levineno, and a loyal guardian who protects her side."

Taesan, who felt the power covering the space, was convinced. Ainz was a monster among monsters who could even surpass the current Taesan.

Ainz gazed up at the ceiling with a distant look in his eyes.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Our world was a very peaceful world protected by Lord Levinov. It was filled with love, and people didn't hide it from each other. Those who loved each other were bound together, and those who didn't receive love received it from someone else. It was all thanks to Lord Levinov's blessings. But... at some point, everything went awry."

"Desecration."

Ainzhar nodded his head.

"It was a similar situation to your world. Desecration invaded our world."

The goddess, the ruler of the planet, pushed back against Desecration.

Ainzhar also helped the goddess from the side, defeating the monsters one by one.

At first, it wasn't that difficult. The goddess was also a transcendent being, and Ainzhar was a high-ranking immortal. Even if a demon of the apostle level came down, they could defeat it.

But time was the problem.

Desecration's invasion didn't end.

The world gradually became desolate, and life began to wither away. It was impossible to drive out the Desecration without getting hurt. Their world was slowly being devoured and dying.

"If we had the help of other gods, it might have been different, but at that time, Desecration was launching a large-scale invasion of the world. The gods also didn't have the leisure to help. As a result, our world was gradually destroyed."

Then, Lord Levinov's divinity also began to waver.

Lord Levinov was the planet's god. If the planet was destroyed, the goddess would also collapse.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I pushed away the gods with Levienov. But even that had its limits. I tried to sacrifice myself to save only Levienov, but... instead, he tried to save me.

Ainzhar spoke with a gloomy face.

"In this gray world, he told me that there was no meaning in protecting a world that had lost its gods. He said it was natural for him to perish along with this world. But he told me to forget everything and live on."

"But you didn't do that."

"Do you think there's meaning in life for a believer who has lost their god?"

Ainzhar shook his head.

"After being forced to flee from Levienov, I searched everywhere for him. But I couldn't find any trace of the goddess anywhere. I thought he might have disappeared, but I still felt his power within me. It meant that he was still in this world. So I desperately searched for clues and hints."

Ainzhar let out a deep sigh.

"You know what happened after that. I discovered that the goddess was in the labyrinth, and I came here. And thanks to you, I was able to meet Levienov again."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The story has ended. Ainzhart grasped Taesan's hand with a desperate face.

"Please, I beg of you. I'll give you everything I have. Please, please... save Lady Levienov."

Taesan nodded his head.

* * *

"Can I ask how you plan to save Lady Levienov exactly?"

"I'm not sure yet. But I do have one idea in mind."

His boundary line was a mix of sacred and black, similar to the current state of the goddess.

The difference was that he could control it, whereas the goddess couldn't.

So, he would use his boundary line to take in the contamination that had consumed the goddess and make it his own.

Ainzhart's eyes sparkled as he listened to the explanation.

"Then... it might be possible."

The reason Ainzhart and the gods couldn't do anything about Levienov was that her contamination was a type of power that they couldn't interfere with.

However, Taesan had already learned to wield the power of his boundary line. For someone like Taesan, it wasn't impossible.

"For now, it's difficult."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The goddess's state was similar to being on the borderline, but it was impossible to intervene now. The goddess's own strength was damaged, and multiple conditions were required.

If they were to forcefully erase the contamination, the goddess might not be able to withstand it and could disappear.

"...The goddess was resisting the contamination of the divine punishment."

She was not completely contaminated. Ainzhart nodded with a gloomy face.

"Perhaps it's because I'm still alive. My faith is both protecting and tormenting her at the same time."

Ainzhart had transcended mortality. His faith, as such, held a high level of power. Therefore, it was likely that the goddess, who had lost the world, was still holding on and not crumbling.

Then...

Taesan, who had been thinking for a moment, opened his mouth.

"Is there a way to recover the goddess's self and stability, even if only slightly?"

The problem was that the goddess couldn't handle the contamination.

In other words, if the goddess's state became even slightly stable, it might be possible to do something about it.

"Is it possible?"

"I don't know yet. It's just a guess."

But there was a possibility.

"Just wait for a moment."

Ainzhart thought quietly. After a while, he muttered slowly to himself.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If we take the hidden path on the 84th floor, we might be able to get there."

"Where are you talking about?"

"The world of the goddess that was devoured by Goshin. But as you know, it's an extremely dangerous place."

Ainzhaar bit his lip.

"It's a place where you can't survive without qualifications and power. I can't leave. Lord Levienov suffers periodically. If I, the only god, don't protect him, problems will arise."

Taesan had to make a decision. After a moment of contemplation, Ainzhaar made up his mind.

"Taesan, are you okay with this?"

Ainzhaar drew his sword.

"If you help me, it would be a great favor, but I can't kill you with that. I know you're strong. However, your true power can't be known until you clash swords with me directly. So, let's have a match and confirm your power before making a decision."

"Alright."

Taesan had no reason to refuse.

Ainzhaar grinned and shouted.

"Hoorge!"

A moment later, Hoorge appeared with a reluctant expression.

"What is it?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"For a brief moment, I'll engage in a duel with him, so I'll spread out the curtain."

"Annoying things."

Horhe spat and swung his hand. The bookshelf moved away, and the space between them expanded.

Ainzhar drew his sword.

"Seriously, I'll go all out. I'll move with the intention of defeating you."

"I'll do it."

Taesan activated all his buff skills. In an instant, his stats reached an extremely high level.

Ainzhar laughed and took a step back.

At that moment, an explosion occurred.

His sword aimed at Taesan's neck.

The power contained within was monstrous.

When Ainzhar first met him, the power he had demonstrated by swinging his fist as a test was far surpassed by the strength contained in his sword.

Taesan instinctively raised his sword. With a loud crash, Taesan's body was pushed back.

"Wow! You're blocking it without any difficulty! That's amazing!"

Ainzhar let out a shout of admiration and jumped up.

The golden sword swung down.

The sword strike was unorthodox and wild, but it was enough to threaten Taesan's life.

Taesan gritted his teeth.

This was the power of an immortal, one of the highest-ranking beings.

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Woah!"

The sword and sword clashed. An unimaginable loud noise continued to erupt.

Taesan was being pushed back, but he was still holding his ground.

Ainzhaar couldn't help but be amazed.

No matter how hard he tried to defend himself, Ainzhaar's attack was being blocked like this. Even an 80th-floor adventurer couldn't do such a thing.

"I'll try to block it too."

A light burst forth from Ainzhaar's entire body. The light soon gathered on the sword, transforming into a massive golden sword.

Ainzhaar swung the sword.

Taesan instinctively realized that this was the genuine article of the immortal. A mortal being could never block such a blow.

Taesan could only respond to the attack with his limits.

But it was no use.

[You have activated the Eternal Unwavering Faith.]

Space opens, and faith connects.

Omnipotence dominates Taesan's entire body. Taesan swung his sword. With the collision, Ainzhaar's body was pushed back a little.

With a mortal body, he blocked the immortal's attack.

Ainzhaar's eyes widened.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"......Is it a faith in a complete world?"

Taesan knew what kind of power he possessed right now.

Ainzhar was taken aback for a moment, but soon laughed.

"You might be able to do it."

He took a step forward.

Outside, Horhe, who was watching, clicked his tongue and maintained the barrier even more firmly. If he let his guard down, the barrier would collapse due to the clash of powers.

"It's a monster."

Someone's words scattered into the air, unclear who they were directed at.

* * *

Taesan fought Ainzhar and proved his power. Ainzhar was greatly satisfied.

"You might be able to hold out even there."

Ainzhar handed Taesan a quest.

[Sub-quest starts.] [Ainzhar wants to rescue his broken goddess, Lebinauf. He was slowly giving up, trapped in deep despair, but after seeing your power, he regained a glimmer of hope.] [Go to the world of the goddess who was destroyed by God, and bring back the artifact that holds her power.] [Condition: Restore the goddess to her original state.] [Reward: Many things that Ainzhar can offer and the goddess's blessing.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There's no need to hurry. Although the goddess's condition is slowly deteriorating... if I'm by her side, I can somehow endure it. It's a request, so I can't rush it."

As Ainzhart said, Taesan didn't leave immediately.

He stayed on the 78th floor and continued to duel with Ainzhart.

His opponent was a strong one, even among the immortals, which allowed him to significantly improve his proficiency in various combat skills, including the Airak martial arts.

He still hadn't found all the secret rooms. Since he had to rely on his hazy memories, it took a long time to search through the vast library of the endless sky.

Taesan continued to accumulate knowledge and discovered the secret rooms one by one.

He slowly organized everything he had obtained and made them his own. It took a lot of time to organize everything, given the sheer amount of things he had obtained.

He also offered the rewards he had obtained as tributes and acquired magic and dark magic.

He didn't neglect his duels with Ainzhart either. Whenever he had the time, he dueled with him and accumulated combat experience.

And a month later...

A quest window appeared before him.
