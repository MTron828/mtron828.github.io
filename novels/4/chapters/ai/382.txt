Chapter 383

383. The Sixth Return, Earth (1)

[Wait a minute. Advanced magic?]

The ghost was shocked. Taesan looked at the book held in his hand.

[Advanced magic, the spellbook of great destruction.] [A high-level magic that destroys matter and space, a spellbook that holds the power of great destruction. Only those who have passed the qualification and trial can wield its power.]

Taesan had entered the labyrinth and met many strong people.

Among them, only one person could use advanced magic.

"Have you seen advanced magic before?"

[Yes, but... they were all gods' apostles. The only exception was Shaiyan, whom you faced. He was the first.]

Shaiyan had used the five destructive demonstrations that summoned destruction.

Taesan was much stronger now than when he faced Shaiyan.

Could he perfectly counter that power now?

The answer came quickly. It was impossible.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If we were to deal with boundaries or eternal, unyielding faith, or something beyond boundaries, we could have blocked or counterattacked. But if not, it was impossible. Even if we did our best to block it, it was a power that could inflict damage.

The value of high-level magic was incomparable to intermediate-level magic.

An opportunity to obtain such power had come to Taesan.

"What is this thing called qualification?"

[It's exactly what it means.]

A voice echoed. It wasn't a ghost's voice. A powerful being was revealing its presence through a medium.

"...... God of Magic."

[Hello, adventurer.]

"It's been a while."

Taesan quietly showed his respect. It was rare for the God of Magic to speak directly.

The God of Magic accepted Taesan's greeting and continued speaking.

"High-level magic is a power that has significant meaning even to me. Not everyone can obtain it. To obtain it, one must have the proper qualification."

"What about qualification?"

"It's not that big of a deal. It's just something that pleases my heart. That's all."

Zelvand said it as if it was nothing.

"In that sense, you have the qualification. That's why I opened the path for you."

"Did Shaian also please your heart?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Shayan, the great wizard who was a guide on the path of evil, also wielded advanced magic.

[It's not like I'm fond of him, but he's a child who has devoted everything to magic. If I don't take care of that pitiful child, who will?]

The God of Magic values passion for magic above all else.

Just look at how they gave Relise, who lacked talent, the opportunity to obtain magic by offering a sacrifice.

[More than anything, that child is someone who has taken what I carelessly threw away a long time ago and has obsessively pursued it to the point of madness. It's a shortcut, no matter what. On the other hand, you're obtaining it through legitimate means.]

"I see, so I need to pass a trial for that."

[Advanced magic has its own value. From there, you'll get closer to the fundamental laws. If you can't control your power properly, it'll consume you. You'll understand when you obtain it.]

"What is the content of the trial?"

A trial to learn advanced magic.

There was no reason to hesitate. Taesan was determined to pass the trial immediately.

The God of Magic smiled quietly.

[Finish what you need to do first and come back. You'll be leaving this place soon, anyway?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You know, don't you?"

The return to Earth was only a week away.

[I'm also interested, so keep an eye on it. Resolve it and come back. We'll talk about it later.]

"I understand."

[Then I'll be waiting in anticipation. Maybe we'll even meet there.]

With that, Zelvand's presence disappeared.

[Even a madman obsessed with magic wouldn't grant high-level magic to someone who's not even their disciple...].

The ghost muttered to himself, but he didn't seem particularly surprised.

Having witnessed numerous events by Taesan's side, the ghost had become desensitized to shocking news.

Taesan continued to explore the library of forbidden knowledge during the remaining time.

He accumulated knowledge and gathered information. He tried to interpret the high-level magic spellbook from time to time, but it was as if it was locked, and he couldn't decipher anything.

Time passed like that.

Only a few hours remained until his return.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard]: It's the sixth time, so I should be getting used to it, but I'm still nervous.] [Geum Jung-geun[Hard]: It's natural to be unsure of what will happen. How about Jun-hyeok?] [Gang Jun-hyeok[Alone]: I'm fine. I'm used to it. But it seems like Tae-yeon noona is a bit anxious.] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Ugh, it's noisy.]

People were quietly comforting each other's anxieties. Taesan asked Kim Hwi-yeon.

[Gang Taesan[Alone]: How did it go with the other countries?]

It was likely that they would meet with other countries again, so it was better to discuss and exchange information beforehand.

Above all, Taesan didn't know much about this return either.

There had been too many changes since the previous life. The people who were supposed to die and the countries that were supposed to perish were still alive, making the memories of the previous life useless.

[Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard]: Taesan, that...â€¦]

Kim Hwi-yeon trailed off.

[Gang Taesan[Alone]: Did it not go well?] [Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard]: No, the discussion itself went well. We exchanged some information too.] [Gang Taesan[Alone]: Then what's the problem?]

After a moment of thought, Kim Hwi-yeon spoke up.

[Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard]: They don't trust us.]

Taesan was taken aback by the unexpected sentence.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Don't believe?] [Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: Yes, and the reason is... because of you, Tae-san.] [Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Because of me?] [Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: It's better to see it for yourself in the community rather than me explaining it.]

Tae-san went to the community as Kim Hwi-yeon said. There, players from Korea and India were passionately discussing something.

[Lee Chae-ah [Hard]: So, Tae-san saved us! He's a savior! Why do you keep denying it?] [Gul San Grover [Hard]: It's not denial. As you said, Tae-san is indeed great.] [Lee Chae-ah [Hard]: I know! So... ] [Gul San Grover [Hard]: But don't force your faith on us. We don't worship humans like you do.] [Sajid Khan [Hard]: Worshiping humans as if they're gods. It's pitiful.] [Lee Chae-ah [Hard]: What, what?]

The community was largely divided. Korean players were praising Tae-san's greatness, while players from other countries were expressing their disapproval. There was one thing they all had in common.

We survived with our own strength, and we have our own beliefs.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You didn't abandon everything and flee to someone like you did."

"Is that so?"

Taesan somehow knew what was going on.

Gosin focused his power on Taesan.

As a result, players from Korea, China, and Japan were intensely attacked by Gosin's power.

And Gosin's power didn't focus on other countries as much.

So, other countries had some leeway.

They had the leeway to not abandon what they believed in.

They had the leeway to maintain their human pride.

It doesn't matter. They'll find out when they return this time.

Time passed, and the quest began.

Taesan inserted his body into the space beyond.

What appeared was a collapsed heaven and earth, and numerous players.

"Wow!"

"Lord Taesan!"

Those who discovered Taesan cheered and rushed towards him, bowing their heads in absolute worship.

Deep and profound faith began to flow towards Taesan.

Receiving their worship, Taesan moved his body.

* * *

Kim Hwi-yeon organized the information of the surviving people. Since she had done a rough organization during the previous return, it didn't take long.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is the damage less than expected?"

Kim Hwi-yeon muttered with a bright face. After returning from the labyrinth, the number of dead was not as high as expected. It was a much smaller number than she had anticipated.

"We've received many blessings from God, so if we're careful, we won't die."

Taesan said. The blessings they had received from God were numerous. Even in the Alone Mode, the powers they had gained were not insignificant, and it was even more so in other modes.

"How far have you guys gotten?"

"We've just entered the 70th floor."

The hard mode players had entered the 70th floor. It was certainly a fast pace. In their past life, they had only reached the 40th floor at this point. Now, their past memories were of little help.

"But from here on out, the difficulty suddenly spikes. I let my guard down and almost died."

"Take it slow and steady. That's where the real challenge begins."

"That's right."

Kim Hwi-yeon nodded her head.

Taesan met with Geum Jung-geun and had a conversation, and then went to find Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk.

As Taesan drew his sword, the two of them also drew their weapons in response.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan engaged in a duel with two others. He didn't use magic, not even black magic, and even suppressed his swordsmanship to the maximum. The stats were also equalized, making it a duel where both sides had a chance of winning.

"Whoa!"

"Hmph!"

However, the two couldn't even touch Taesan's hem. Kang Jun-hyuk grumbled and brushed off the dust.

"We've also become much stronger, but we can't even touch him."

"Didn't you say you're around the mid-40s level?"

"Yes. At this rate, we'll reach the 50th floor soon."

The 50th floor.

Taesan thought for a moment about what was there.

"There's a village on the 51st floor. It's a place where people with broken hearts live. It's okay to take a break there for a while, but be careful not to get stuck."

"Ah, a resting place..."

Lee Tae-yeon, who was lying on the floor, muttered to herself. If it were her past life, she might not be able to pass the 51st floor, but now she was strong enough to do so without a problem.

Taesan, who had been observing Lee Tae-yeon for a moment, realized something.

"What's that?"

There was an unknown power inside her.

It was a small power that had transcended mortality, but only barely visible now.

It was different from blessings. It was different from divine rewards.

Taesan, who had glimpsed that power, could understand.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That was a link.

Something was connected to Lee Tae-yeon.

As Taesan gazed at her, Lee Tae-yeon subtly averted her gaze.

"Why, why is that? What's going on?"

Just as Taesan was about to ask her what it was, a quest window appeared.

[Special Quest Start] [This is a continental joint quest.] [Designated Continent: Asia.] [All players from the designated country must gather in one place. Overcome the difficulties you encounter while gathering and meet with players from other countries.] [This quest has no time limit.] [The more influence you have on the encounters between players, the more points you'll receive when you return to the labyrinth.]

* * *

The sudden appearance of the quest window caused a commotion.

Lee Tae-yeon and Gang Jun-hyeok also looked at the quest window.

"Is it the entire Asia region? It's suddenly become enormous."

"It'll take a considerable amount of time just to gather everyone. Ah, Mr. Taesan, weren't you going to say something?"

"No."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan turned his gaze. The power within Lee Tae-yeon was too small to do anything. It wasn't a problem that needed to be addressed immediately.

"Let's talk about it later."

For now, he thought he would sort everything out and check it properly.

Taesan went to find Kim Hwi-yeon. She was also quickly scanning the quest window that had suddenly appeared.

"This is the entire Asia... there are too many. Ah! I knew it would be like this. I should have talked to more countries!"

There were too many problems to sort out. Kim Hwi-yeon quickly scanned the contents of the quest.

And she was able to learn one fact.

"Is the gathering place here?"

She let out a sigh of relief at the fact that they didn't need to move to another location. Taesan also confirmed the contents.

"That's right."

Taesan moved his body and stopped right in front of the sky. The people who saw Taesan all bowed their heads at once.

Receiving their faith, Taesan gathered his power.

This was the exact location of the quest's goal. There was no need to move to another place.

Then, it wouldn't be a problem to make this place a base.

Kiying!

A golden light burst out into the world.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It envelops the heavens and covers the people. The light that shines towards the world is so intense that even those who are far away turn their gaze.

"Oh, ohâ€¦â€¦."

"Ahâ€¦â€¦."

People unknowingly kneel down, overcome with a sense of awe as if they are witnessing a divine miracle with their own eyes.

Taesan unleashed its power. The golden light spread from the center of the heavens, creating a domain.

[You have activated the Creation of the Holy Land.]"
