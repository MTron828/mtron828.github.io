Chapter 135

135. The Guide to Sin's Path (1)

The monsters on the 30th floor seemed to be a collection of various spirits, including fire, wind, and water. Each one was stronger, faster, and more powerful than before.

However, the same could not be said for Taesan's opponent. They easily broke through the maze and obtained the reward from the secret room.

[Ring with an unknown aura] [Attack power + 10] [The ring contains an unknown aura that attacks the owner's enemies. Although it's not particularly meaningful, it's likely to be sold at a high price.]

Attack power was meaningless without a weapon. It was probably an exchange item, but Taesan, who had learned the Air Force technique, couldn't find a better equipment.

I took off the ring, which had 5 strength and 5 defense, and wore it. The attack power and defense matched perfectly.

[Attack power + 228] [Defense + 228]

"I like it."

I felt a little better.

I continued to break through the maze. Since the 30th floor had no special features like the altar of the gods or a different-colored door, I moved quickly.
Here is the translation of the given text:

Thus, I arrived at the boss's place.

[Pyro Spirit Iffrit appeared.]

The giant of flames blocked the path of Mount Tai. It swung its massive arms, summoning a blaze.

Mount Tai raised its hand as if pleased.

"It's just right for a test."

[You activated a small spark.]

As the skill was activated, your senses changed. You felt the flames closer and more familiar, and you gained control over them, realizing this.

Mount Tai stretched out its hand towards Iffrit's incoming punch.

Pffft!

Iffrit's arm exploded. It was the result of Mount Tai's control over the flames. Although the arm was recreated, Iffrit seemed to be in disarray, stumbling around.

"Good."

The 30th floor boss was unable to do anything and was being beaten unilaterally.

From then on, it was a one-sided battle. Iffrit tried to counterattack somehow, but was completely blocked by a light gesture.

"Well, go then."

Mount Tai clenched its fist. Iffrit's entire body exploded, leaving only a pile of ashes. It was a pitiful end for the 30th floor boss.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Your level has risen.] [Your upgraded level has been activated.] [You have discovered a hidden element on the 30th floor and obtained a reward [???].] [You have perfectly cleared the 30th floor and obtained the title [Settled One].] [You have cleared all the floors up to the 30th and obtained the title [One Who Strives for Perfection].] [You have reached a level where you can be proud of yourself as an explorer and obtained the title [One Who Takes the First Step].] [You have not only proven your strength here but also shown more value. You have obtained the title [One Who Continues to Challenge].] [You have reached a position that anyone can recognize and obtained the title [Adventurer].] [Your footsteps will now leave a significant change.]

As before, numerous rewards are given at once.

"Well, then."

Before ending, I should confirm. The mountain has collapsed.

* * *

The 30th floor clearance reward was also a title. Since the increase in stats was obvious, I was satisfied, but since it didn't change much, I felt a bit bored. So, I checked the title.

[Title: Settled One] [You have reached a level where you can settle in the labyrinth. Whether to move forward or stay here is your choice.] [Strength + 40] [Agility + 40] [Intelligence + 40] [Attack Power + 10] [Defense Power + 10]

"Uh?"

The mountain suddenly stopped.

"What's the difference in numbers?"

I had obtained a title when I cleared the 20th floor. The title corresponding to Settled One was One Who Moves Forward.

I remembered that it was a not-bad title that raised each stat by 15 points. However, this title's performance was incomparable.

"What's this? 40 points each and 10 points for attack and defense?"

[You have reached the 30th floor.]
The ghost calmly explained:

"If this were the beginning of the 20th floor, then from here on out, I've gone beyond that. This is no longer the lower floors, so I'll give you a clear reward. It may not mean much to you, but the title's effects on attack power are considerable, even if you don't have a weapon."

"Uh-huh."

It wasn't bad. In fact, it was good. If it were like this, the other titles might have been at this level too. Tai Shan expected this and confirmed his expectations.

And it actually was like that.

Those who pursued perfection raised all their stats by 40, those who advanced to the beginning of the path raised them by 70, and those who kept challenging raised them by 30.

As a result, I got a total of 180 stats as soon as I cleared the 30th floor.

And finally, I got the title, "Adventurer".

Tai Shan was taken aback after verifying this.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Title: Adventurer] [A qualified person. If they lose their qualifications, this title will disappear.] [Strength + 100] [Agility + 100] [Intelligence + 100] [Attack power + 10] [Defense power + 10] [There is a low probability of obtaining double rewards in the Secret Room.] [The skill proficiency increases by 20%.]

Tae-san laughed sarcastically.

"It's too good."

Although the numbers are very high, the special effects are real.

The reward in the Secret Room is double with a low probability, and the skill proficiency increases by 20%. This title is amazing.

"What's this? Is this something that's given at the 30th floor?"

[This isn't an easy-to-obtain title.]

The ghost explained.

"I think none of the guides of the wicked path received it. Only the adventurers who were chosen under their own judgment within the labyrinth will receive it. It's a kind of qualification.]

The gods select those they like and give them a strengthened test, choosing them as their disciples.

This title seems to be playing a similar role.

"Status window."

[Kang Tae-san] [Level: 69] [Shield: 435/435] [Health: 4890/4890] [Mana: 875/875] [Magic: 66/66] [Strength: 2043] [Intelligence: 1601] [Agility: 1875] [Attack power + 248] [Defense power + 248] [The target is in the best state.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Finally, my strength has surpassed 2000. Compared to Taeyeon's incredible stats, I'm still far from reaching her level, but I'm slowly getting closer.

"It's really great."

I've become stronger than myself yesterday, and tomorrow will be even stronger than today.

That was a very enjoyable experience.

Taesan smiled joyfully and slapped the wall.

Kwak!

The wall collapsed. The wall of the labyrinth was extremely sturdy, and it wouldn't have broken even with tens of thousands of attacks.

It's clear that something was hidden inside, which is why it broke so easily.

Taesan, who had already discovered the layout through reconnaissance, calmly entered the collapsed wall.

After descending for a moment, I found a small space, and inside, I saw five silhouettes.

"Hullo. Are we meeting for the first time?"

Taesan greeted them.

Those five, who had not been pursued and had chosen the path of survival over battle, stood before Taesan's eyes.

"Then, let's conclude this."

Taesan drew his sword with a relaxed air. A man who had been parched with thirst and had a dry, stern expression hastily raised his hand.

"Stop! You can't kill us!"

"It's not possible, I think."

"No, you're impossible."

The man shouted boldly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's because the deep-level leaders have been in contact."

The Taesan suddenly stopped moving. The man's face lit up with a bright smile as he opened his mouth.

"It's just a moment ago! I've contacted the high-ranking officials! I'll be here soon!"

Even if they were hiding in a secret room, they could roughly understand the situation in the labyrinth. When they saw Taesan break through 29 and 30 floors in an instant, their faces turned as white as snow.

When Taesan caught the boss of the 30th floor, they almost gave up.

But at the same time, the high-ranking officials of the deep level returned, having finished their attack on the floor.

It was unclear whether it would be a failure or a success, but it was important that they could contact each other.

The man immediately contacted the deep level. The man who was thought to be dead was alive, and he was coming to kill us, he said.

As soon as Taesan arrived, the contact message came down saying he would be here soon.

"You can't kill us! If you kill us, you'll become our sworn enemy!"

The man's face no longer had any fear. It was because he was convinced that Taesan would never be able to touch them.

"So?"
Here is the translation:

And Tai-san shattered their confidence.

Tai-san drew his sword and approached them.

The man was taken aback and took a step back.

"What's this nonsense! Are you trying to provoke the adventurer from the depths?"

He had confirmed that he was still alive because of that.

Tai-san was undoubtedly strong. He could be confident of winning against the five of them, even at the 30th floor. He also had the strength to win against an average 40th-floor adventurer.

However, that was a story up to the 40th floor.

The adventurers from the depths were those who had surpassed the 70th floor. They had the power to transcend dimensions, literally. The difference between the 1st and 30th floors was smaller than the difference between the 30th and 70th floors.

So Tai-san thought that he would no longer fight to survive.

But Tai-san did not think that way.

"After all, I have crossed the unreturnable river. What difference would it make if I killed five more?"

"Oh, no!"

The man exclaimed explosively. His back hit the wall.

"You're strong! You're an unprecedented strength among us! With you, we can enter under the judgment of the upper echelons!"
Here is the translation of the text:

He was not lying.

It is a rare case to find a precedent for the establishment of a guide to evil, but it was definitely possible. In fact, there was one person who opposed the guide to evil even before they entered the labyrinth. The leader of the group came down to him, and without any punishment, he became the guide to evil.

"What?"

"Then, now......"

"But I don't like it. I don't think I'll be able to live peacefully with you people."

The mountain-like person shook his head and approached them slowly.

"You, you......"

"Are those adventurers who have come down 30 floors, risking their lives? You've overcome two trials, haven't you? Choose. Will you win and risk your life, or will you die shamefully here?"

The person's muttering changed their gaze. The man gritted his teeth and pulled his hand away from the wall.

"I'll regret it!"

They got up. Each person's abilities exploded, violently shaking the small space.

* * *

They did their best.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was as if they had been stimulated by the words of Taesan, and they used the skills they had learned and honed by accumulating experience, as well as the items they had held onto until now, to confront Taesan.

Thanks to this, Taesan was also a bit troubled. He had to make a mistake and create an opening, and the guides of the sinful path, who were trying to make him lose his life, had to be a bit lenient towards him.

But that was all.

Tap tap.

Taesan blocked the attack and retreated. The guide of the sinful path, who had seen this, thought they had won and rushed towards Taesan with a excited face.

And then he stepped on the dark aura that had appeared on the spot where Taesan had stepped.

"Eh, eh?"

For a moment, his face was filled with surprise. His physical movements slowed down, and his face turned pale.

Kwa-jik.

"Hah!"

Taesan's sword pierced his chest. He used it as a shield to block the skills.

[You have activated the Deccaravia's Distorted Vegetation.]

Kugugung!

The roots began to stir up and filled the room, and the sudden growth of vegetation blocked their view. The others were startled.

And Taesan was watching all of this.

It wasn't just with their eyes. It was with the eyes of a fellow being. Skills such as sensory enhancement and high-level detection skills showed them things beyond what the eyes could see.

Kwa-ang!
Here is the translation of the text:

With roots shattered, the Taesan appeared. The man searching for his figure pierced through his neck.

"Well, go."

He charged towards them.

Only three of the guides of sin remained, their faces stern, gripping their weapons.

And 10 minutes later.

They were all annihilated.

"Oh, I lasted a long time."

Now, there was an absolute difference between them and the Taesan. Yet, they lasted for 10 minutes, and it was a proud achievement.

Even the last man who fell was smiling with satisfaction.

The Taesan sheathed his sword.

The five guides of sin, three ranks down, were at a level where they could activate their ascension to a new realm. Their level had risen, and they had gained a few skills.

However, there was no time to confirm this.

The Taesan lifted his head.

"Huh, what's going on? Why are they all dead?"

A young man with a puzzled expression, who had just entered from the entrance with a shocked face, was staring at them.
