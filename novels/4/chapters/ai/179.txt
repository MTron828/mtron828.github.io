Chapter 180

180. The World of the Arrogant Giant (6)

The giants stood stiff-faced, holding their weapons. A gust of wind blew past them.

"Is everything ready?"

The giant king's question was nodded to by Tai Shan.

The giant king turned his gaze to the giants.

"Giants, we are the strongest species. No one has dared to defy us, and even the great transcendent ones have been forced to retreat before our power."

The quiet but powerful voice spread to the giants, and their eyes began to gleam.

"Everyone, prepare! Let's crush and tear apart that filthy existence that dared to mock us!"

"Yes!"

A brief shout echoed.

The giant king waved his hand. A massive energy surged towards the palace, and soon the seal of the monster was broken.

Clang!

The giant king clenched his fist.

A giant barrier formed around the palace, and a strange and thick aura rushed in like a storm.

Kaka-kaka-kaka!

The aura pummeled the barrier violently. The giant king's expression grew solemn.

At the same time, the sky split open.
Here is the translation:

As if a massive hole were being pierced, a vast space was formed. The giants there were bolstering their strength with the massive energy flowing out, and Tai Shan's face twisted in anger.

A massive hole in the sky.

It was exactly the same as the rifts that existed on Earth.

Kaka, kaka, kaka!

Monsters fell from the sky. The ones that landed on the ground wriggled and stood up.

Tai Shan examined the monsters, but there were none that were particularly strong. They were all about the level of B-grade monsters.

The problem was that there were hundreds of them.

Ku, ku, ku.

The monsters slowly approached the giants.

The giant king looked at the warriors and said, "Then ask."

"Yes, your majesty," they replied.

The warriors took a stance.

The giants let out a roar and charged at the monsters.

The giant king's gaze fell on Tai Shan.

"Then, human, ask. Please save us."

The giant king's muttering was left behind as Tai Shan entered the palace.

As soon as Tai Shan stepped into the palace, the monster's energy was about to swallow him.

"Get out of here."

Tai Shan strode forward with ease.

The palace was enveloped by the monster's energy, and nothing could be seen more than a few inches ahead. However, Tai Shan navigated the path with ease, relying on his keen sense of direction and spatial awareness.
Here is the translation of the text:

Meanwhile, outside, giants and monsters were engaged in a fierce battle.

"Ugh!"

Umberak struck his sword downward. The monster's body was split in two and fell to the ground.

"Ha ha ha!"

He burst out laughing.

The instinctual sense of combat that had been dormant in him boiled over. Not only that, but the other giants seemed to be doing the same, fighting the monsters with a sense of ferocity.

However, their strength was not particularly remarkable. Giants and monsters were locked in a fierce battle, and sometimes they even retreated.

The decisive blow in a fierce battle was the job of the war wizards.

A war wizard with his eyes closed, gazing into the distance, waved his hand. As if performing a grand magic, a space opened up and a column of light fell.

Kuoooong!

The monsters that were directly hit vanished without leaving a trace.

Another war wizard shot a transparent sword. Dozens of monsters were cut down.

The giant spectators were amazed.

"That's magic, isn't it?"

The power they had forgotten, which they had forgotten due to the monsters.

And the power they could regain.

Their eyes blazed with excitement.

The monsters began to be quickly cleared away.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san arrived at the place where the monster was seated.

Crackle.

As Tae-san approached, the monster reacted. Tentacles began to slither out and move towards Tae-san.

Tae-san gazed at the monster with a sense of awe.

[Judgment of sanity in progress...] [Death judgment in progress...] [Frenzy judgment in progress...] [Madness judgment in progress...]

.

.

.

[Judgment successful!]

This judgment was not as high as the one when Tae-san saw an S-grade monster before.

This time, the monster Tae-san faced was even stronger.

'It's S-grade or above.'

If it were a normal monster, Tae-san wouldn't be able to win.

But Tae-san held his sword.

[The opponent is an enemy who cannot be defeated.]

Tae-san's stats skyrocketed with skills and mental judgment. Feeling his strengthened power, Tae-san gripped his sword again.

This monster was specialized in fighting giants, unlike monsters on Earth.
Here is the translation of the text:

And the most powerful mental ability, the psychic barrier, did not work on Tai Shan. The condition that giants cannot be killed, which was also nonexistent for humans like Tai Shan, was equivalent.

So, the only thing left was the monster's physical abilities.

Even Tai Shan, as he is now, could have broken through that.

[You have activated your essence perception.]

The momentary vision opens up.

Information about the monsters enters Tai Shan's mind, humming like noise.

While it's unclear what exact information, the general aspects can be perceived.

The monster's physical strength was unimaginably high.

It was several times higher than the A-grade monster Tai Shan had faced before. Tai Shan gazed at the writhing tentacles emanating from the monster's body.

Those were the monster's main attack methods.

Wooo.

Just as Tai Shan was analyzing the monster, it suddenly shook its body. A psychic wave enveloped Tai Shan's mind, and a shockwave that had turned giants' brains upside down and pounded their hearts concentrated on Tai Shan.

"Can't take it."

Tai Shan shook his head and cleared his mind. The monster, realizing that its psychic attack was ineffective, moved its tentacles.

Tai Shan took a step back.

At the same time, the tentacles descended and struck.

Kuuuuummm!
Here is the translation of the text:

Climbing beings struck the ground and took control of the space. Tai Shan wielded his sword to repel the climbing beings and dodged the unstoppable attack by stepping back.

Tai Shan quickly arrived at the climbing beings and thrust his sword into them.

Whoosh!

The sword was stuck in the climbing beings.

However, it did not penetrate deeply. Tai Shan confirmed that they were quite sturdy and avoided the whiplash of the climbing beings, then charged forward again.

Kuooong!

The climbing beings fell to the ground.

Tai Shan drew his sword.

[You have activated the Strong Blow.]

Whoosh!

Tai Shan struck down each whiplashing climbing being and advanced. Soon, he reached the monster's doorstep.

[You have activated the Vital Point Identification.]

Tai Shan identified the vital point where the climbing being and the monster were connected and thrust his sword into it.

Whoosh!

The sword penetrated deeper than before.

Tai Shan twisted his sword.

The climbing being dropped.

Tai Shan stepped back.

There was no need to worry.

The monster was originally designed to kill giants. While it surpassed S-grade in terms of mental power, it was only on par with an A-grade monster in terms of physical strength.

The climbing beings, like thorns, suddenly shot out towards Tai Shan with sharp edges.

Tai Shan did not dodge.

[You have activated Random Blink.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san's body moved through the air.

He had already branded a mark near the Chok-soo earlier. As soon as he moved, he swiftly struck down his sword like an axe.

Hmph!

The Chok-soo shook violently. As Tae-san continued to strike down, the Chok-soo detached and flew away.

Guggugung!

The Chok-soo's trajectory was distorted, and it was stuck to the floor and wall. Tae-san swept away all the Chok-soo that were charging towards him and then swung his sword again.

Tae-san gradually removed the Chok-soo one by one. As the Chok-soo decreased in number, it became easier for him to fight the monster.

And the same was true outside.

"Uaaaaa!"

A giant roared loudly and infused strength into the monster's hand that was holding it. The monster let out an uneasy sound and was torn in half.

The giant kicked the monster's corpse away and shouted.

"Not a big deal, huh?"

The giant's dominance was overwhelming.
Here is the translation of the text:

The giants' help was immense. With one wave of their hand, dozens of monsters fell, and the giants didn't feel like they were at a numerical disadvantage. It was the monsters who were at a disadvantage. At that moment, the giants were almost finished dealing with the monsters.

The giant king who was watching muttered to himself in a low voice.

"Is this the start?"

Whoosh!

A massive shockwave spread from the sky. The giants, who had been rushing forward with a loud roar, suddenly stopped.

The monsters began to fall from the crack again.

And the monsters that appeared then seemed to be even stronger than the ones the giants had dealt with before.

"What's this?"

One giant shouted and charged forward. The monster in front of him swung its long arm. The giant confidently held up its shield.

Thud.

The shield was shattered, and the giant flew away to the other side.

Monsters stronger than B-grade.

If the Mountain King had seen them, he would have said they were A-grade.

Hundreds of A-grade monsters charged forward at once. The giants gripped their weapons with stiff faces.

* * *

Thud.

The Mountain King dropped the tentacles. Now, there were only three tentacles left. Almost finished dealing with the monsters.

Wooo.

A space opened up above the monsters.

From there, dark and thick energies poured down like a waterfall, sticking to the monsters.

"What's the point of this?"

"That's annoying again. That's it, that's it, it's getting annoying, isn't it?"

The ghost-like being muttered to himself with a sense of awe.

The gods had used every means to kill Taesan.

It was no different here. Since Taesan expected a slight change, he was not surprised.

Kaka!

The monster's tentacles, which had been severed, began to twitch and sprout small thorns.

At the same time, the thorns on the tentacles grew into sharp spikes and shot out.

Papapap!

The thorns were stuck in the ground. Taesan leapt out and swung his sword.

Kaka!

The thorns all snapped off at once. But again, the thorns sprouted out and attacked Taesan.

There were too many thorns to be taken down with a sword.

Taesan quickly made a judgment. There was no need to use two swords. Instead, he drew out the shield of Aigi.

Tzetzet!

The thorns battered the shield. It felt like a powerful force, but it was manageable. There was no damage.

Taesan put his strength into his legs.

[You have activated the White Rune Shield.]

Kuuuu!

Here is the translation of the text:

A white shield summoned before Tai Shan. The thorns that had flown in battered the shield. Although the shield could not withstand for long and was shattered, it had given Tai Shan enough time to move.

Ka ka ka!

Tai Shan wielded his sword. The thorns broke off like bamboo shoots. However, the tendrils continued to sprout without stopping.

Cutting the thorns was meaningless.

The thorns were emerging from the tendrils. They had to be cut off.

To do that, they had to approach the tendrils again, just like before.

Chū jiā jiā zuò!

The tendrils spread out in all directions, forming a multitude of tendrils. And then, tens of thousands of thorns flew towards Tai Shan.

Tai Shan strengthened his legs.

[You have activated the Sadohwa (Rakiratas) technique.] [You have activated the Marble's Black Wave technique.]

Kūng!

The sword wave overflowed the space and surged forth. The waves fiercely raised their bodies and charged towards the thorns.

The thorns were swallowed up by the waves and disappeared. The sword wave did not stop.

It devoured everything in its path and seemed to be trying to engulf everything in its bosom.

Tai Shan rode the waves and rushed forward. The monster gathered the tendrils and shot out the thorns all at once.
Here is the translation of the text:

Thorns were stuck in the dark wave. The wave seemed to hesitate for a moment, then suddenly surged with energy.

Whoa!

The wave burst open.

Instantly, thousands of thorns disappeared.

Because of that.

The mountain god arrived, its foot planted firmly on the ground.

The mountain god, which had arrived in front of the tentacle, raised its sword above its head.
