**Chapter 323**

**323. The Magician Who Created the Labyrinth (1)**

[I am the manager of the labyrinth.]

The sound of bricks colliding echoes loudly.

[And I also play the role of a guide who leads those who seek the labyrinth. 71st floor. Adventurers who will descend to the depths, I have something to explain to you. It's up to you to listen or not. What will you do?]

"I'll listen."

Taesan responds.

[You must have experienced many things while descending into the labyrinth. You must have roughly understood what kind of place the labyrinth is and how to conquer it. But it's different from the depths.]

These are the words that Itaeyeon had said to him. Balbam was saying the same thing.

[Until now, the labyrinth has been divided into new themes every 10 floors. But in the depths, each floor is independent. There can be a floor as vast as a single star, or a small floor that only one person can barely enter. You can even move to a completely different world, or the concept of time can become distorted.]

"Layers that have escaped the concept of narrow spaces, which can no longer be called labyrinths.

[This place is deep. The strategy you've used so far will be very different from now on.]

Balbam said, gazing at Taesan for a moment.

[But it might be meaningless to you.]

"I know it well."

Taesan couldn't be considered an ordinary adventurer. He had been to other worlds through the gods' strengthened trials and had completed several quests on Earth.

It wouldn't be difficult if he thought of it as similar.

"Is that the end of the story?"

[What I need to do is over. You can figure out the rest by going down the labyrinth yourself.]

Taesan tried to brush past Balbam and head towards the passage.

But he stopped in his tracks at Balbam's next words.

[But before that, my master wants to meet you.]

[What?] The ghost stopped. Taesan turned his body to face Balbam.

"Your master?"

[Really?] [I don't lie.]

Balbam said bluntly.

[The wizard who created the labyrinth. The being who created me wants to meet you, adventurer.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!

* * *

A meeting with the wizard who created the labyrinth with the help of the gods.

However, the ghost spoke in a tone that seemed ambiguous.

"[Is the wizard going to meet with an adventurer who has just entered the depths? That's weird.] [Don't ask me. I've been tired of my master's whims for a long time.]"

Bavalbambara spoke in a tone that seemed annoyed.

"Answer me, human. What are you going to do?"

"Can I refuse?"

"[If you want to, it's possible. Then I'll just tell the wizard that you refused, and that's it. Will you do that?]"

Taesan thought for a moment.

Iteyeon didn't talk about the wizard.

It was unclear whether he deliberately didn't say anything or didn't know anything, but Taesan knew very little about the wizard.

After finishing his thoughts, Taesan spoke.

"I'll go."

He had to meet the wizard eventually for his goal. It was just that the timing had been brought forward, so it wasn't bad.

"[This is a hassle. But I'm his tool, so I can't refuse. Wait.]"

Kuuuung!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A powerful force burst out from Balbam. It was a wave of power that could suddenly pull up even the mighty Taesan.

The spreading power began to twist and distort space.

Taesan, who had gained immense power, realized something.

It wasn't just distorting space, but was interfering with the fundamental laws of the labyrinth itself.

It seemed like a power granted to Balbam, the administrator of the labyrinth.

[Balbam activated #000004.]

Kwajik.

Space was completely distorted, and a twisted dimension appeared.

[The wizard is outside the labyrinth. Creating a passage from the inside to the outside is a very difficult task.]

Fatigue was evident in Balbam's voice.

Taesan looked beyond the space. Balbam spoke in a tired voice.

[Hero, you are not permitted. Only that human can go.]

[That's right. Take care.]

As if expected, the ghost quietly separated from Taesan. Taesan began to insert his body into the space.

[It's okay if it's you, but I'll give you one piece of advice.]

Balbam spoke in a low tone.

[The wizard is the creator of the labyrinth. Keep that in mind.]

Let me know if you have any further requests!

"With those words, Taesan entered the space.

What appeared was an endlessly unfolding, twisted, and distorted space.

The place was extremely disorienting, with countless colors mixed together.

He looked around, but couldn't see anything.

Taesan slowly took a step forward. If he observed his surroundings carefully, the owner of the place would reveal themselves.

No matter how far he walked, the space seemed endless. The colors changed constantly, like a rainbow, and twisted with immense power.

'Different.'

Taesan had visited numerous divine realms and worlds. With his specialized ability to observe and grasp the essence of things, he had a certain understanding of the characteristics of each realm.

The realm of the demon god was dark yet gentle. The realm of Pavsha was intensely self-assertive, and the realm of the spirit god Beatrix was harmonious, with everything working together.

But in this rainbow-colored space, the characteristics of the realms Taesan had seen so far were all mixed up.

'Can it be mixed up like this?'"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a separate issue from simple strength. If one was a strong person who could possess a domain, it was natural that they had built something that showed the characteristics of their domain.

But this place was different.

Despite being a magician's domain, there was no sign of the magician themselves.

"Hello."

Taesan's feet stopped as he heard the sudden voice behind him. The distance between them suddenly grew.

Taesan, who had been holding his breath, looked up.

The owner of the voice had gray hair.

With an ordinary physique and an ordinary face, he was someone who would be easily forgotten if seen on the street.

"Nice to meet you. Adventurer."

He was smiling brightly.

And from him, nothing could be felt.

Not the scent of a human, not the will to live that should be felt from a living being, not even the aura of someone with a certain amount of power.

Nothing at all.

If you closed your eyes, you wouldn't even know he was there.

"Do you know who I am?"

"A magician."

Taesan replied. The magician who created the labyrinth. The man nodded.

"I am the magician of the labyrinth. I created this place and built it, and I am the owner of this vast space."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan quietly observed the wizard.

But no matter how hard he looked, he couldn't understand anything.

Taesan instinctively activated his skill.

[You have grasped the essence $#!@#]

The graphic seemed to break, and the system window distorted. The wizard smiled and waved his finger.

"No way."

The system's activation itself was blocked.

"I am the wizard. I created and designed this place. There have been those who, intoxicated by their own strength, tried to kill me and become the master of this place. But they didn't even know where their power came from."

The wizard's eyes narrowed. Taesan realized why he had said such a thing at the end.

The wizard was the creator of the labyrinth. The skills born from the labyrinth wouldn't work on the creator.

"I won't attack, so let's be generous. Sit down."

Two chairs appeared in the dimly lit space. The wizard sat down and said,

"Are you curious? Why I wanted to meet you."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan nodded his head. Judging by the ghost's reaction, it seemed that the magician had never met an adventurer who had just entered the deep layers.

"The magician..."

"Feel free to speak your mind. I'm tired of dealing with those who think they're superior just because they're good at something."

"...Why did you want to meet me?"

"I'm interested in you."

The magician replied.

He lazily rested his arm on the armrest.

"Attack invalidation. Simple time stop. Forced duel. Addition. Multiplication. Absolute judgment..."

The magician's words flowed out, listing the skills Taesan had obtained.

"It's not about strengthening one's own strengths, but about understanding the system of the labyrinth and creating skills that can intervene with it."

The ghost was amazed, and even the high-ranking officials didn't notice the power.

"Many people have come down to the labyrinth and obtained many skills. But there are hardly any who, like you, analyze the system itself and create skills. You know, don't you? What kind of skills they have."

Taesan realized the meaning behind the magician's words.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$The formidable Shan possessed skills related to defense, with abilities that affected defense and protection. The king of elves, on the other hand, managed skills that influenced spirits and nature.

Likewise, Eehyeon also did not differ. She descended the labyrinth by avoiding and bypassing battles. As a result, most of the skills she possessed were for evasion, concealment, and escape from the battlefield.

Indeed, those who could descend the labyrinth had their unique abilities.

However, Taechan was different.

Skill to neutralize attacks. Skill for absolute judgment. Instant time stop.

These were not abilities derived from individual power, but rather, skills obtained through the analysis of the labyrinth's system itself.

"While others enhance and strengthen their abilities through skills, you manipulate and utilize the labyrinth's system itself. You seem to have a more fundamental understanding of things."

The magician's face showed interest.

"Is that due to the inherent limitations of your world? Quite interesting."

He opened his mouth again.

"You must have more questions. Ask away. I will answer what I can."

Taechan organized his thoughts and opened his mouth.

Perhaps it was a question that could tie up all loose ends, a question that could lead to the climax of the story.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If you conquer the labyrinth, your wish will be granted, didn't I say that? But how far can that wish be fulfilled?"

"It's a wish."

The magician muttered quietly.

"I can't tell you if you can't clear the 100th floor, but... you might be okay. You know the qualifications for a wish, don't you?"

"Conquering the labyrinth."

It's not just about clearing it. You have to conquer the labyrinth itself as a space.

And now, Taesan is approaching the conquest.

"I created the labyrinth. It wasn't just my power alone. Many gods, immortals, and powerful beings collaborated with me."

The magician tapped the armrest with his finger.

"All of them, who can create and destroy the world on their own, collaborated on the creation of the labyrinth, and this place was made."

The deep, deep labyrinth.

A place where even those who have reached the end of their mortal lives can't guarantee clearance, where many transcenders reside.

"I will grant the wish of those who reach the end. We made that promise."

The magician continues.

"The wish that can be fulfilled is limited to the extent of those who were involved in creating the labyrinth."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The eyebrows of the great mountain trembled. The wizard smiled quietly.

'Everything allowed within the bounds of law and order. That is the reward of conquest.'"
