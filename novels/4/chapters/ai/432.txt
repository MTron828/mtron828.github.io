**Episode 433**

433. The 85th Floor, the Ash-Colored Woman, Sosiet Gardenia (1)

"Even if the seal that banished the gods is weakening, it will take a very long time to completely undo. It's enough to hold out until a shining star loses its light. But if we use the boundary line, the story changes."

If it's the boundary line of Taesan, we can forcibly release the seal.

"That's something no transcendent being in this world can do. That's not all. Do you know about the gods' purpose?"

"The death of all transcendent beings."

The empty, grotesque avatar of the painting said that was the condition, and that was something it would never compromise on. The magician nodded in agreement.

"They hate the existence of transcendent beings. They want to erase that existence from this world. But it's difficult for them to do so with their power alone. No matter how much they contaminate us, they can hold out like Lebinevoff."

Lebinevoff's domain was polluted, and his body was also contaminated, but he didn't disappear. He was holding out against the pollution.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even if Rakiratesna Maria, a powerful god, were to exist, she might not allow the contamination itself. But... if you were there, who knows?

The wizard sent a strange gaze to Taesan.

"The boundary you possess denies the laws and destroys them. If it's a boundary, it could erase the realm of the transcenders themselves from this world."

"I don't have that kind of power."

"Of course, not now. But if the gods were to lend their power, what would happen? If other gods were weakened like Levienov, would it still be impossible?"

"……."

Taesan didn't answer. He couldn't easily deny it either.

The wizard shrugged.

"Honestly, we don't know much about the boundary either. We know everything within the range allowed by the laws, but we can't know what's beyond that. The gods might know, but they won't answer."

A figure flashed through Taesan's mind.

The Great Demon King, Baal.

A being closer to the gods than anyone else.

"You called me the one who mixes with the gods."

He seemed to know something about Taesan. He might know the answer too."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But I won't answer you. If I had intended to answer, I would have done so already. I couldn't rely on Baal.

The wizard said with an ambiguous expression.

"The one thing that's certain is that you have the power to destroy the current world. That's why many transcendents are hoping for your death."

"You're too interested."

But I could understand. It's a being who can summon the difficult-to-expel High God again. Taesan was a thorn in their side, so they couldn't tolerate it.

The wizard chuckled playfully.

"There are many transcendents who rule the universe and want to kill you. How do you feel?"

"It's not good."

Not only the High God but also many unspecified transcendents were on their mind. If they were weak-willed, they would have gone crazy immediately.

"Don't worry too much. There are people who care about you, including me, who will stop them. There won't be a big problem."

"Are you trying to protect me too?"

"I don't intend to participate in such foolishness. They're transcendents, but they think too one-dimensionally."

The wizard's gaze at Taesan was filled with strong interest."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You can release the gods from their seals. And you can even kill them. But you can also kill the avatar of the gods, who are beyond our power to expel, and purify the contamination of the sealed goddess."

The abilities of the boundary line were still largely unknown.

The magician revealed this.

"Then, is it possible to banish them forever and prevent them from interfering with this world again?"

The curiosity in his eyes was close to madness.

"If you use your power, can you kill the gods who couldn't be killed?"

The magician laughed mockingly.

"You... can create change. Perhaps it's the first step towards a new era. To think that such an existence is dangerous and try to eliminate it is foolish. There's a limit to foolishness."

The magician scornfully criticized the transcenders.

In the end, everything started from the boundary line.

And the trigger that allowed him to gain that power was the soul upgrade.

[You have entered a state of mental immersion. Your body and mind are unified.] [A miraculous power is engraved on your soul. You have acquired the soul skill [Soul Upgrade].]

This was the status window that appeared when he acquired the soul upgrade.

"What is the soul upgrade, anyway?"

A soul skill that steals the power of the gods, the power of the immortals.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"To be honest, I don't really know about that either."

The wizard replied with an ambiguous expression.

"I understand that you've reached a high level and obtained the skill of spiritual ascension, but I have no idea what level that is."

The wizard shook his head.

"If you've obtained the skill of spiritual ascension, it can't be a low-level realm. But you didn't achieve that realm. You reached somewhere, but the traces of it have completely disappeared. Are you an immortal or a transcender? If you're a transcender, what kind of realm was it? Or is it something else entirely?... I don't know either."

According to the wizard's words, Taesan from his past life had reached a high level and obtained the skill of spiritual ascension as a result.

However, that realm did not remain with Taesan. Only the spiritual ascension remained.

"It's being obscured by the boundary line, but... I'm more curious about that side. What could have stopped you from reaching that realm? And if it was possible, how did you do it?"

The wizard's gaze held an unmistakable curiosity.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You should also keep thinking about it. You have the power. You can find the answer yourself."

"That's right."

"Then that's enough. I've told you all the truth I know. So, what are you going to do now?"

"Nothing has changed."

Taesan said calmly.

He was still an adventurer in the labyrinth.

He would continue to descend into the labyrinth and become stronger. The relationships between gods and gods, and interests, were not important to him.

The wizard smiled faintly.

"I won't block your path. You can continue to descend into the labyrinth like you are now. That's enough."

Kugugugung!

The realm collapsed. Taesan's body returned to the labyrinth.

"Please show me. What will be at the end of your path?"

With his last words, Taesan arrived at the labyrinth.

[What's going on? Is the story over?]

"It's roughly so."

[Did I also chase away the secrets and make it a mysterious story?]

"I won't deny it."

Taesan clenched his fist.

Although he had learned many new facts, the fundamental things had not changed.

That was enough. He was unshaken.

* * *
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What's going on? What did I say to make you chase me away like that?"

The voice of the Green Witch echoed. Taesan shook his head.

"I can't tell you."

"Hmm... Well, if it's something a wizard has decided, it must be a secret worth keeping. Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do about it. I'll just keep watching."

The voice of the Green Witch disappeared again. Thinking back, she had seen Taesan's uniqueness and made a contract with him. Even now, at the midpoint of the 80th floor, her wish was still far from being fulfilled.

"I'll find the answer if I keep going down the labyrinth."

With his thoughts organized, he opened his skill window.

[Special Passive Skill: Distorted Spirit Tuning] [Proficiency: 82%] [Distorted beings can manipulate their own spirits. They can control the spirits within themselves or those they possess, and can even use their spirits to directly influence the world.]

The proficiency of Distorted Spirit Tuning had reached 80%.

As a result, he gained the ability to influence the world with his spirit.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"My sense of the boundary has changed. Taesan has mastered the spiritual boundary. It's not just about using his physical body, but about unfolding it towards the world.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

Then, Taesan's spiritual boundary spread across the world. Taesan immediately realized what he had unfolded.

"It's similar to a partial world change."

[You have activated the Unjust Arrow.]

Zee-ja-ja-jik!

Even though he didn't activate the partial world change, he could use the unjust magic.

He had forcibly pulled up his dominance over mana using his spiritual boundary.

Now, even without materials, he could bring out the effect of partial world change within a certain range.

If he uses partial world change together with this, he could exert an even stronger influence.

And black.

[Transcendence: Black] [Proficiency: 20%] [Consumption??? :???] [?#$@!! #$!!@# @#@!!@#!!!]

Finally, his proficiency has reached 20%.

Although the description is still unreadable, there has been a definite change in his control over black.

Taesan scattered black.

The black overflowed from the labyrinth's floor, starting to devour the space.

[…It looks a bit dangerous.]"

Note: There are some parts that are difficult to translate due to the use of onomatopoeias and made-up words, but I've done my best to provide a faithful translation.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The ghost let out a sigh.

The space dyed black was difficult to call a labyrinthine space.

This place was no different from the realm of the gods.

"Is this the feeling?"

Taesan controlled the black color. He didn't just use it to dye his body or weapons, but could spread it widely to the extent that he could control it.

"......Can I use the boundary line in this way too?"

Until now, Taesan had only used the boundary line as a weapon.

He had used boundary repulsion to surround his entire body, but ultimately didn't stray far from his physical surroundings.

However, now he could manipulate the black color over a wide range.

Then, could he use the boundary line to control his own realm?

The possibility seemed sufficient.

However, it was too dangerous to experiment with it right away. The labyrinth might collapse, and the "Balbalba" might come rushing in, so he thought he would observe the situation and try it out.

"It doesn't have to be the boundary line."

The demon was a being similar to the gods.

In the demon's realm, he could use the black color, mixing it with the magic of injustice, like a curse, and use it together with his magic.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The method was diverse. Taesan organized his thoughts and checked other skills.

[Soul Skill: World Sword] [Proficiency: 1%] [Summons a sword made of the world itself and wields it. Due to the user's lack of strength and qualifications, it takes time for the sword to recover after being used once.]

The enormous sword, like a mountain, that the avatar was wielding.

It seemed possible to summon it.

Considering its power, it was a meaningful skill. Although the sword was consumed just by wielding it once, it was enough just with that.

[Weapon Engraving] [An engraving that is used on a weapon. Although it has no pattern, it contains an unstoppable strength within.]

An item used on a weapon. Taesan had it engraved on the relic of Carbert.

[Carbert's Relic: Sword that has absorbed the blood of ancestors] [A relic of a world that has now been destroyed. It took the lives of many imperial families.] [Attack Power + 1000] [Attack Power + 150 when facing all enemies]

"Wow."

The attack power had increased by 500. It was a higher increase than changing one piece of equipment.

The secret reward was a material for black magic, and I decided to offer it as a sacrifice."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**Special Active Skill: Purification of Impurities** **Proficiency: 1%** **Consumes ??? : ???** **Can purify the impurities that pollute the world. However, there aren't many types that can be purified yet.**

A skill obtained by purifying the goddess's contamination.

It seemed to be a skill that could purify the god's contamination. To find out what kind of effect it had, I would have to use it directly on the contamination.

After roughly checking, Taesan took out a black fragment.

"What do I do with this?"

**God's Fragment** **A part of the god that exists beyond the laws.**

God's Fragment.

It wasn't an easy material to handle. When I thought about it, the crystallized divine blood was still sleeping in my inventory.

How could I handle these two things?

Taesan thought about the method while putting them in his inventory.

He headed towards the 85th floor.

However, the system window announcing the 85th floor's quest did not appear. Instead, a different system window appeared.

"Is it time?"

**Special Quest Start** **Return to Earth** **One month from now. You will return to the land you abandoned. Survive there and come back. The reward will be determined by your achievements.**
