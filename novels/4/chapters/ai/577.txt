Chapter 578

578. Confirmation (2)

Taesan read the system window's description and tapped his fingers on the floor.

He could perfectly control and manage the labyrinths of Easy, Normal, and Hard modes.

Taesan closed his eyes. His consciousness and vision left the earth and headed towards another place.

And Taesan began to observe.

The three labyrinths copied by the Duplicator.

The players in the labyrinths were all on earth now. There were no humans in the labyrinths.

"This is the first time I've seen Normal and Hard modes."

The basic appearance was not much different from Easy mode. Compared to Alone mode, it was simple and ordinary.

The monsters residing on each floor appeared.

Of course, the monsters in Easy mode were the weakest, and they grew stronger as they went up to Hard mode.

Taesan, who had been gazing at the scene for a moment, unleashed his power.

Quadruple destruction.

Taesan's power affected the three labyrinths.

And all the monsters in the labyrinths were crushed and destroyed.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It didn't take even a second. All the monsters in the three labyrinths were annihilated.

Except for NPCs, nothing existed in the labyrinth.

Now, even an ordinary person without any powers could reach the 100th floor of the labyrinth as if taking a stroll.

Taesan activated his power again, and the monsters that had disappeared from the labyrinth began to reappear.

Taesan could perfectly control the labyrinth.

If he wanted to, he could create a labyrinth filled only with S-grade monsters. But he had no intention of doing so.

And there was a sentence about being able to intervene in the lives of dependent beings under certain conditions.

It was probably referring to the people of Earth.

"Indeed, there were conditions."

The usurper was the master of Easy, Normal, and Hard modes. He could have taken the players of Earth hostage and threatened Taesan, and Taesan had actually considered that possibility.

But the usurper didn't do so.

He barely intervened in the labyrinth, and his only intervention was to forcibly return people to Earth."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The usurper was ultimately just mimicking the concept of the universe. It seemed that there were definite limitations to that as well.

But it wasn't the end.

Because he had a higher level of power, or because he was a being of the universe, he could influence the players on Earth by resolving just a small limitation.

In other words, he could now forcibly clear the players.

'Let's talk about this part.'

The rough confirmation was over. Taesan continued to verify the remaining powers.

[Transcendence: Sovereign of Control] [Proficiency: 99%] [You can control and manipulate everything within a certain range of yourself.]

A simple explanation. It wasn't hard to understand. It was just a matter of controlling the surroundings based on oneself.

Perhaps the usurper used this power to control the merged powers he had absorbed.

Simple, but incredibly powerful.

And finally, there was one last power. This power wasn't a divine power.

It was a power of the universe.

[Transcendence: Fall] [Proficiency: 99%] [A collection of concepts of the universe's downfall.]

The usurper had devoured the god of fall."

Note: "Taesan" is a proper noun, likely a character's name, and I've left it untranslated.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's correct to say that the God of Fall has sacrificed himself.

The concept of Fall is how to deal with it. He already knew it, having fought against the God of Fall himself.

"My head hurts."

He had obtained too much power at once. Taesan felt that he could do too many things by combining his powers.

Let's think about it slowly. Taesan organized his thoughts like that.

And Taesan stood up from his seat.

He was trying to control his power, but he could feel many gazes on him.

Taesan looked up.

There, he saw the leaders of each country and the players of the Elon Mode, all staring at him.

* * *

"Have you been waiting?"

"It's a bit awkward to start talking first."

Oliver Kan, the leader of the labyrinth, spoke. The eyes of the people looking at Taesan held joy and ambiguity.

"Let me ask one thing, Taesan. Did we... really win?"

The system window that declared their victory appeared.

But they couldn't feel at ease until they heard Taesan's confirmation. They had been betrayed too many times before."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan nodded his head.

"I won. At least for now."

"Ah."

"Ahah."

Only then did the tension seem to dissipate, and people sat down. Daniel let out a sigh of relief.

"Really... we won."

"But what does 'for now' mean? It's unsettling."

"There's still more to figure out."

Where did the gods go?

What were they planning next?

Until the transcenders confirmed it, there was still an element of uncertainty.

"But... at least the Earth is safe. We don't need to worry about that part anymore."

The crack in the sky had closed, and even if the gods tried to intervene on Earth, Taesan alone could stop them.

The faces of the people who received the confirmation finally showed genuine joy.

"We... won."

"Can we live on Earth now?"

They chatted happily, but Ichijo suddenly looked puzzled and muttered.

"But... how do we live now?"

At that question, people fell silent.

The Earth was in ruins.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There were no surviving animals. Insects were the same. At least, according to their detection, not a single cockroach had survived.

And Taesan knew this for certain.

There was no life on Earth, including plants and insects.

Even if the players were gone, the monsters remained, roaming the entire Earth and killing all life.

It wasn't just the life on the surface, but also the fish in the deep sea and the ocean floor.

Since there was a way to cultivate food, there was no problem with food supply. Plants could be grown somehow.

But the number of plants that could be grown was too small.

They could survive, but it didn't seem like they could live the same life as before.

"That part is taken care of, so you don't need to worry about it," Taesan said, dismissing their concerns.

"Is that something you've thought of?"

"I don't get it."

How could they revive a completely dead Earth?

At least, it was incomprehensible to their common sense.

But Taesan always showed them things that went beyond their common sense. They trusted Taesan.

"And I have something to tell you."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is it up to us?"

"This isn't a problem that can be decided by my own will, it seems."

Taesan said, referring to the control he had gained over the labyrinth.

And then, there was silence.

"Is that... really true?"

"I wouldn't lie to you now that we've come this far."

"That's right."

Oliver rubbed his face.

"The labyrinth we risked our lives to clear... has become yours."

"I can make it possible for you to clear the labyrinth."

There's no need to risk your life. You can literally take a stroll and clear the 100th floor to return to Earth.

"I'll clear it for you if you want."

"...Hmm."

The labyrinth is dangerous.

You have to risk your life to enter it, and many sacrifices have been made in the past.

But they couldn't give a straight answer.

The labyrinth is clearly dangerous. You can barely make it out alive after overcoming the threat to your life.

So, they didn't want to leave it up to Taesan to clear it, even more so.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Compared to Taesan, they were insignificant, but they had cleared it with their own strength. They had pride in themselves. They didn't have the desire to clear it in a cheat-like way now.

"I thought it would be like that."

They also had pride in their own strength and effort. They didn't rely on Taesan.

"Still... the meaning is significant, isn't it?"

"There are those who gave up on conquering it, too."

Not all players were able to conquer the labyrinth.

Some had given up from the start, and others had stopped in the middle of the labyrinth. Originally, they wouldn't have survived, but thanks to Taesan, some of them were able to survive.

It was a great story for them. They could clear the labyrinth without risking their lives. Lee Tae-yeon suddenly thought of something and asked.

"Then, do you also have control over the Alone Mode?"

"No."

Taesan shook his head.

"It's not the Alone Mode."

The Alone Mode belonged to the wizard. Lee Tae-yeon murmured with a hint of disappointment.

"That's unfortunate. That's what we need the most."

The players of the Alone Mode were enthusiastically descending into the labyrinth. There were many players who had reached the 20th and 30th floors.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But if there was a problem, it was that they had almost no chance of clearing the alone mode.

Even the strongest players in numerous worlds couldn't clear the labyrinth and became guides of sin.

To be honest, the current ratio was also strange. Amelia, Lee Tae-yeon, Kang Joon-hyuk, Kang Tae-san. And even the Indian player. Many players were running towards clearing the alone mode.

Considering the difficulty of the alone mode, it was an abnormally high ratio.

"I'm thinking about that too."

Tae-san replied calmly. He was also devising various plans.

"It's not over yet, so."

He decided to put off talking about that part.

After that, they exchanged various trivial conversations.

Most of them were stories about small lives.

What would they do after everything was truly over?

How would they live from now on?

Lee Tae-yeon said to Tae-san,

"Tae-san, did you know? Before the world became like this, my occupation was a teacher."

"I'm hearing it for the first time.""
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What was important to them was how to survive and conquer the labyrinth. They never shared stories about what they did or what kind of life they lived.

"'Teach someone. It was a meaningless ability. But...'

"Not anymore.

"She could teach someone history, life, and morals.

"A smile spread across Lee Tae-yeon's face.

"And a little while later...

"The wizard reappeared.

"'Sorry, I'm a bit late with the confirmation. Before I explain, let's take care of the reward first.'

"[99th floor cleared.] [The reward will be decided by the wizard.]

"'What are you going to give me now?'

"The wizard shook his head.

"'Let's just keep it simple.'

"[You have obtained 10,000 attack power.]

"The increase in attack power. Tae-san accepted it calmly, as expected. It didn't matter what other rewards he received now.

"'And... how do we do the 100th floor?'

"The 100th floor.

"The end of the labyrinth.

"Tae-san had finally reached the end.

"The wizard looked at Tae-san with an ambiguous expression.

"A quest is a trial.

"A trial is being given to Tae-san.

"It was a ridiculous thing to say. A weak person giving a trial to a strong person. What kind of trial could be given to Tae-san now?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was impossible for the wizard to give a satisfactory quest.

And Taesan knew that fact too.

"It seems you haven't decided yet."

"Unfortunately, that's the case."

"Then, I'd like to make a proposal."

Taesan said calmly."
