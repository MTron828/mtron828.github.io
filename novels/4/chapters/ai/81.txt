82. 14th Floor, Guide of Sin (5)

"To you? I don't really want much. If I had to say, experience points and stats?"

Taesan drew his sword. The adventurers recoiled in fear, screaming.

But the youth who had shown himself first looked at Taesan with unwavering eyes.

Taesan chuckled.

"You find it easiest to talk? Are you their representative?"

"For now, yes."

The youth replied calmly.

If Taesan wished, he could tear them all apart and kill them. Escaping would be futile. Their refuge on the 20th floor was obvious. They wouldn't live long.

However, instead of thrusting his sword, Taesan called out to them. The youth thought he wanted something from them.

And the youth's assumption was correct. Taesan stroked his chin and asked.

"What's your name?"

"I am Gagorat."

He said the name. If he were to kill him right away, there would be no need to know, meaning he intended to let him live. The youth breathed a sigh of relief inwardly.
Taesan sheathed his sword.

"Originally, I planned to kill them all, but it wouldn't be particularly meaningful now that their levels have risen significantly. There's not much difference between us anymore. Even if I were to defeat them all, my level and stats wouldn't increase much."

"Do any of you want to die?"

Everyone nodded. They were all prepared for death, but they didn't want to die meaninglessly like this.

Taesan continued, "Instead of killing you, I'll give you one command. Do not send information about me to the Guide of Sin."

"What do you mean by that?"

"Exactly as I said. Keep those at the bottom unaware of me."

Those at the bottom won't care about events in the second hierarchy.

But if an adventurer over twenty dies, there will be no indifference. Moreover, one adventurer from the third hierarchy has already died. Taesan's information must have already been passed on to some extent. So, you'll realize that thirty floors in the thirteenth floor side
Then, no matter how arrogant they are, they won't just sit back and watch. Whether it's out of interest or hostility, they'll take something. They might even come down themselves.

That's when it gets tricky. Even if he's strong, he's not at a level to deal with those below.

So, let's confuse them with this information.

Gagorat organized his thoughts with a calmer look in his eyes.

"You mean to pass on false information."

"Correct. They won't care much whether the information you give them is true or false. Feel free to mix in some lies before sending it."

"Understood... Yes."

Gagorat had never seen the leadership directly. They only communicated through intermediaries, so it was entirely possible to lie.

"So, tell them. Say that I died by your hands. That I conspired with the adventurer from the 30th floor."

Gagorat swallowed hard. It wasn't impossible. It was entirely feasible.

But if so, it was akin to assisting Taesan in going down below.

He was the Guide of Sin.

It was an act diametrically opposed to the group's purpose.

As if he could read his mind, Taesan smirked.

"After all, you didn't join us willingly, did you?"

Gagorat managed a wry smile.
태산's words were never wrong. There was no obsession with protecting them. They disappeared the moment they were blocked at the 20th floor, even if they were absent.

Just because he was about to die, he accepted it because he had received a proposal for the contest. Gagorat neatly organized his thoughts.

"I'll accept it."

"Good."

Taesan smiled.

They breathed out when the energy was released.

"I'm just saying that if you send information to the floor, the number of them." offsetY
[Why do you resent what you did? I'm not interested.]

Ghost said with a snort.

[You may not know about the piss, but you know. Who is the one who ordered me to die?]

The one who did the most work in killing the hero.

[Don't say you don't know. There's no way you, as a manager of hierarchy, didn't get that much information.]

Gagorat opened his mouth after a moment of silence.

"We didn't like you. You must have known that."

[How could I not know? Weaklings like them show such jealousy.]

The ghost chuckled. In a relatively short time, he had descended deep into their depths. For a long time, he had been an object of admiration, jealousy, and hatred to them, trapped on a particular floor.

"But there weren't many who wanted to harm you. Strong ones, and they could have helped us too. One person proposed."

Gagorat looked at the ghost.

"To kill you. There was some resistance at first, but before long, your death was decided."

[Who the hell is that guy?]

"You might be better off not knowing."

[That's for me to decide.]
Gagorat spoke calmly in response to the irritated question.

"The woman who inherited the cursed kingdom's bloodline. The ashen woman. Sosieta Gartentia."

The ghost's body shook visibly.

[...She ordered me?]

"At least that's what Baron said, from what I've heard."

[Why?]

There was only uncertainty in the ghost's voice.

Gagorat nodded.

"I don't know. So I was surprised when I heard it too. He was the only one in leadership who had a good relationship with you."

[...]

The ghost closed his mouth, clearly shocked.

"If you follow him, you'll meet her. I hope it satisfies your curiosity," Najik said as Gagorat turned away.

Other individuals began to slip away with relieved expressions.

Taesan caught them.

"Where are you going?"

"Huh?"

"There's still more to be done."

[...]

Gagorat swallowed hard. Taesan shook his head at their fearful faces.

"Information up to the 20th floor."

"Ah..."

Gagorat's expression shifted as he realized.
They had permission up to the 20th floor, so they understood everything up to the 20th floor. Taesan, who was in the position to go up, naturally expected that.

They spilled out all the information they knew. From secret rooms to altars of gods. And even the existing NPCs.

"When you reach the 16th floor, there should be an empty room. There's a blacksmith there," Taesan's eyes gleamed.

It was finally time for him to meet the reason he had been gathering materials all this time.

"Alright. You can go now."

"...Yes. Thank you."

They left. It wouldn't be long before news spread to the leadership that Taesan had died.

All that remained were Taesan and the ghost who had fallen silent.

* * *

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Congratulations.]
[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Yes, yes...]
[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: We did it! We won! We did it!]

Somewhere, a deflated Lee Taeyeon responds. Kang Junhyuk leaves a message, clearly excited.

The reason for their reactions was simple.

They were the gods of victory. They had passed through the trials of Valtahar.
[Kang Taesan [Alone]: How are you feeling?]
[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Um... I feel a bit dazed. Honestly, I still can't quite believe we cleared it.]
[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: It's great! We cleared that crazy thing! We even got rewards for it! I'm so happy!]

Taesan chuckles at their completely opposite reactions. Lee Taeyeon shows relief after making a fuss and calming down.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Somehow, we managed to survive.]
[Kang Taesan [Alone]: What was it like for you to be like that?]

The trials of Valtahar were not enhanced. Taesan was curious too. Lee Taeyeon answered.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: It was about facing what I feared most. A giant spider came out and attacked me. Ugh. It was terrifying.]
[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: I had an elephant.]
[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: An elephant scared you? It's cute, isn't it?]
[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: You can't say anything until you see it in person. Do you know how scary it is to see that shape come down?]

Watching the trivial conversation, Taesan thinks.

‘Win against what scares you the most. Is this a trial worthy of the god of victory?’

At the moment of seeing an opponent who cowers in fear, huddled up, breathing fast and sweating, it seemed to be a matter of calming their heart and proving victorious. It was quite understandable.

‘What would have come out if it had been me?’
Here's the translation of the text:

---

It might have been an apostle seen at the end. Or perhaps a giant monster seen in the sky.

With a slight doubt, Taesan posted his thoughts.

\[Kang Taesan \[Alone\]: Are the rewards sufficient?\] \[Lee Taeyeon \[Alone\]: They're overflowing.\]

God of Victory. The basic reward from Valtahar is the Belt of Determination. It enhances attack and defense by 3, and upon victory, restores health and mana.

Attack power is meaningless unless it's Taesan, but recovery holds great value. Especially since Lee Taeyeon and Kang Junhyuk lack significant recovery skills, it holds even more meaning.

\[Lee Taeyeon \[Alone\]: I understand why Taesan insisted we take it. The rewards for difficult victories are substantial indeed.\] \[Kang Taesan \[Alone\]: Still, don't overdo it. Since the capricious god exists, it's best to receive in moderation.\]

After giving some appropriate advice and sharing information such as secret room locations, Taesan closes the community.

Taesan speaks up.

"Are you ready to speak?"

"Do I have to?"

"You have to."

In a sharp tone, Taesan calmly replied.

"I dislike quests I've worked so hard on failing due to the whims of the parties involved."

--- 


The quest of the ghost is determined by the ghost's heart from the explanation.

Taesan had no intention of leaving variables behind.

The ghost trembled quietly. Amidst the wavering remnants, a voice echoed.

\[It's not a great story. I came here from a world that perished. All that exists here are monsters, and the only ones worth conversing with are lunatics or idiots, so I didn't want to talk.\]

Though not spoken properly, it must have been quite painful. Humans are social creatures, and not engaging with others can lead to mental issues.

\[She was the only one I could communicate with somewhat. We had some sense of camaraderie due to our similar circumstances.\]

"Did you like her?"

\[... There were feelings. It wasn't to that extent, though.\]

The ghost spoke calmly. The emotion in the voice had diminished compared to before.

\[But if she made the biggest contribution to killing me, then I have my own tasks to do. I'm just curious. Why did she do it?\]

"Then it's settled."

You might meet when you go down.

Taesan went down a floor and met a dwarf. The dwarf looked surprised to see Taesan.

"Oh, you came?"


"From here on, they said they'd give me a new quest. I've come to accept it."

"Instead of penalty play, a different quest. That's what the dwarf said. But after hesitating, the dwarf barely opened his mouth."

"Sorry, but I can't give it to you."

"What?"

"No, it's not like I didn't want to give it to you."

The dwarf explained defensively.

"I told you. I'm a restricted existence here. It was fine until now, but when you were about to descend a floor? Suddenly I couldn't do it anymore. So I'm quite bewildered right now."

"Suddenly?"

"Yeah."

Taesan lightly poked the dwarf's cheek. He had a rough guess as to why.

"Is it because of my level?"

Currently, Taesan's level is 41. It's not a level that can be obtained on the 14th floor. It's because he defeated adventurers as he descended the floors.

Even if it's about stats, there might be restrictions due to the imbalance in levels. Understanding this, Taesan nodded his head.

"Well, then there's nothing I can do."

"Hmm... Even though it's a promise, it's not much to say it's a substitute. How much gold do you have right now?"

"I have about 30,000 gold."
"Alright, I'll take 20,000 gold then. Take this."

The dwarf tossed a ring. Taesan instinctively caught it.

[Purple Ring: Hongyoung] [All stats + 3%] [A ring received from a rock when the sun's energy falls on it until the rock is crushed.]

"...Really?"

"You couldn't keep the promise. So I have to compensate for that."

The dwarf calmly explained.

Taesan received the ring in a daze. Even though it reduced the penalty play by 50%, he hadn't imagined he would gain this much, 50,000 gold. He thought he could buy it after descending about 20 floors.

"Thank you."

Still, it was a good thing, so he quietly accepted it. A profit of 20,000 gold. He didn't know what kind of quest it was, but it felt stronger than this.

"So are you going down now?"

"That's all I have to do."

The dwarf, who had been observing Taesan for a moment, chuckled.

"I see why there are restrictions. It won't take an hour."

"See you next time."

15th floor. Taesan thinks as he clears the entry quest.

'There's nothing to gain.'
Skills can only be obtained when the opponent's level is somewhat comparable. So far, it was possible to acquire them because the levels weren't that high, but now they're too high. Acquiring skills became impossible.

That's why he descended quickly. Until he could obtain the skill, until the floor where the spiritual increase activates normally.

There was no need to be blocked by second-tier adventurers. He knew the location of all the secret rooms up to the 20th floor.

Taesan, who had been descending leisurely, hurried through the rooms.
