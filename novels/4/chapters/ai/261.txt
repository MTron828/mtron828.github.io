262. The Old Monster (Part 1)

A colossal presence.

As it appears, space contorts. The laws of the world crumple, and everything begins to twist.

[Urgh.]

The ghost swallowed a breath in an instant. Soon, its figure vanished.

The link wasn't severed. It seemed to have been momentarily bounced outward, unable to endure.

Taesan looked at the monster.

It, too, turned its gaze towards Taesan.

Despite having no head and no visible eyes, Taesan could feel its gaze directed at him.

Along with the sensation of its gaze, its overwhelming presence also strikes.

Kwoong!

Overwhelming vastness.

The end of unimaginable strength. A vastness akin to seeing the ocean for the first time. It was a force that even risking one's life and giving everything could not reach.

Simultaneously, all the feelings of despair that humans can feel rush in. Waves of despair that could turn even those who have endured suffering into fools in an instant.

"Enough, stop."

It commands.

It gathers its spectral power.

Shaking off overwhelming force and will, it rises.
The gaze toward Mount Taesan is imbued with a mysterious light.

Mount Taesan empowers the hand wielding the sword. Despite the sensation of one's entire being crumbling, they gaze upon the ancient mastiff.

"[You.]"

It wasn't language. Language is something created to converse with others. The ancient mastiff had no such need.

It was simply a declaration infused with determination.

"[It is mine.]"

Kwoong!

The world distorts. Space itself bends and forces move to fulfill the will of a great existence.

It was a sort of law. Reality itself shifts, phenomena occur to fulfill the ancient mastiff's intent.

The physical form of Mount Taesan draws closer to the ancient mastiff. Space opens, attempting to engulf Mount Taesan and erode his spirit.

"Get lost."

Mount Taesan roughly kicks.

The gathered energy within his body explodes.

Like a wild beast, he breaks through the distorted reality, shattering the storm of energy. The surroundings collapse and the distorted reality subsides.

"I haven't done anything, and mere will cannot subdue me."
Here's the translation of the text you provided:

He overcame numerous trials and gained unimaginable strength. Even if he were a deity, relying on sheer will alone cannot conquer Mount Tai in an imperfect state.

"If you were trying to kill me, the story might change... but you have no intention to kill me, right?"

Mount Tai chuckled softly. The deity wanted to subdue him.

"Then this is nonsense. I won't submit to you."

The mortal boldly declared in front of the transcendent being.

The ancient deity's gaze remained unchanged.

"Then fall."

With those words, reality twisted.

The laws of change rushed to kill Mount Tai. Distorted space turned into thorns, attempting to pierce Mount Tai like poisonous air infiltrating his respiratory system.

Mount Tai roughly waved his hand.

"You have triggered the ember of calamity."

The inferno of a beast that could annihilate the world exploded.

It swept everything in its path to burn.

But the being before him literally sought to destroy the universe.

The raging flames were trampled upon by the twisted reality and faded away like a small ember.

Yet time was gained. Mount Tai gathered his spiritual energy into one sword. He swung it fiercely, dispelling the pressure that approached.

It was the moment Mount Tai launched himself forward.

*Sound of a crack!*

(Note: The text ends abruptly with an onomatopoeic expression, suggesting a sudden impact or action.)
The earth collapses.

As the ground gives way, the body begins to descend. Taesan, tongue lolling, peers down below.

And his pupils dilate.

There seemed to be no end to the collapsing earth.

His body began to plummet into the abyss without end.

"Damn it."

Taesan curses as he rolls his tongue.

* * *

"Ah, no!"

The contract between spirit and human was a kind of link.

Humans could sense the spirit's perspective and power, and could also detect its movements.

Likewise, the spirit could do the same. It could see the approximate strength and perspective of the contracted human.

That's why Minerva could see it now.

The colossal presence before Taesan.

"No!"

When power gathered from the first forsaken land, she thought the entity before the thorns was enhancing its power to the level of a mortal's domain. It was dangerous, but within the realm of mortals.

But this was different.

An ancient god. A transcendent being. Its true form descending directly.
Minerva gathered the wind. It was a rough aggregation, with no thoughts of reverse summoning. She swung at the black barrier bristling with thorns.

"Pa-a-a-ng!"

But what dispersed was the wind. Machin, standing on the ground, spoke.

"It's futile. Spirit child. That's a concentration of power. You can't even scratch it with your strength."

"Aaaa!"

Minerva ruffled her hair.

Her master, the one who had helped her, was engaging in confrontation. It seemed likely to drive her mind crazy.

"Machin!"

She shouted at Machin.

"Please save my master! Don't you cherish my master too?"

"Yes. I cherish him."

Machin nodded.

"But I won't save him."

"Why?"

Minerva opened her eyes wide.

"Why! Why would you let my master die like this!"

"Calm down."

Machin raised a finger to Minerva's forehead.

In an instant, her body collapsed. Barkaja hastily wrapped around her.

"Machin... You've put her to sleep for a moment. It's good to see her caring thoughts, so forgive her rudeness."
He shouted directly at the transcendent being. If it had been a filthy transcendent being, it would have immediately turned to dust.

"[... Thank you for your mercy.]" "[Are you also worried about him?]" "[... Yes.]"

"Master Mashin, is there truly nothing you can do to help him?"

Anetsha asked with trembling eyes. Standing before the Mashin she admired, she could barely keep herself together; otherwise, she might have gone mad like Minerva.

"First, one thing."

The Mashin raised his hand towards the black barrier.

"I'm not refusing to save him. It's that I cannot save him."

"You mean, Master Mashin?"

"This black space has gathered and condensed the energy that was spread across the entire abandoned land. In other words, it's the space beyond, the realm of gods. It can no longer be called the demon world."

The Mashin licked his lips.

"Of course, unlike the abandoned land, this is a temporary aggregation that can be dispersed with force... but then, everything inside it would be erased."

"Ah..."

If the Mashin tampered with the space, even Mount Tai would perish. Understanding this fact, Anetsha closed her mouth.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"The rest should be left to him. And even if I could have saved him, I wouldn't have."

"Excuse me?"

"You need to trust him a little more."

Mashin smiled.

She couldn't see beyond the space. But she could guess what was happening inside with the energy she felt.

"Not a proper descent, but a trickery. Literally just managed to slip in the body. There's no way he'd die from just this, right?"

She said, with the assurance of a princess awaiting the return of a hero.

"He will return victorious. Just like he always has."

* * *

Falling, Taesan spread his wings.

Instinct warned him about what lay below. He shouldn't descend. Everything he had would vanish if he reached down there.

As he tried to soar, something sprang up from below.

Taesan instinctively raised his sword.

"You triggered a release."

Bang!

The sprung-up thing bounced away, revealing itself.

Taesan frowned.

"A hand?"

It was a black hand.
The scene unfolds with countless hands rising up as if cursed. They reach out towards arms and legs in an attempt to grasp Mount Taisan.

Mount Taisan pivots its round body.

It captures Aura on the tip of its sword and swings it.

Aura scatters like waves. Hands that had been rising up move to avoid the Aura.

"Tsk."

Mount Taisan clicks its tongue, focusing its mind and swinging its sword.

Clang!

It knocks away hands one by one. It kicks away hands reaching to grasp its feet and throws punches. Gathering wind and flames, it bursts downward.

Mount Taisan glances briefly upward.

The ancient shaman quietly gazes down at him.

"You have triggered Frost Arrow."

Frost Arrow flies towards the ancient shaman, but vanishes before reaching him, as if erased by an unseen force below.

Mount Taisan knocks away hands aiming for its limbs once more.

"...Weaker than I thought."

A power that collapses space and bites into reality. Certainly powerful, yet not the power of a transcendent being.

In other words, the ancient shaman had significantly weakened upon crossing into this realm.

The ancient shaman descended here, borrowing the power of Ilarion.
There might be some time constraints. In other words, surviving until then would be a great victory.

However.

"I don't like it."

Taesan muttered.

He wanted to give a blow to the old master looking down on him from above.

There was a moment of hesitation, but the decision was quick. As Taesan plummeted, he twisted his body upwards. Dozens of hands reached up simultaneously.

Taesan's arms and legs were grabbed. Intense force tried to drag Taesan deeper into the abyss.

"You have activated the frozen world."

Crackle!

A bitter cold surged. The hands were covered in frost.

But the hands did not stop.

They grasped Taesan, breaking through the ice.

"You have activated the frozen world again."

Once more, cold surged.

The grip of the hands weakened compared to before.

Taesan did not stop.

He continued to activate the frozen world, investing all remaining mana.

"Phew."

He breathed deeply.

As he exhaled, he froze and fell.

The surroundings were covered in transparent ice.

Crackle.

The ice began to slowly crack. The hands moved forward towards Taesan, inch by inch.
태산은 아이기스의 방패를 꺼냄과 동시에 주먹을 쥐었다.

He drew out the Aegis shield and clenched his fist at the same time.

[당신은 아이기스의 방패를 사용했다. 1초 동안 모든 피해에 면역이 되지만 움직일 수 없다.] [당신은 마법 폭발을 발동했다.]

You used the Aegis shield. For 1 second, you are immune to all damage but cannot move. You triggered a magical explosion.

냉기가 깨져나갔다. 두 자릿수 이상 중첩된 얼어붙은 세계가 일제히 터져나가며 사방을 뒤덮는다. 달려들던 손아귀들도 마나 전체를 투자한 폭발에는 견디지 못하고 깨져나간다.

Coldness shattered forth. Frozen worlds overlapping by double digits burst forth simultaneously, covering every direction. Even the charging claws could not withstand the explosion invested with all their mana and shattered away.

하지만 깊은 곳에서 손아귀들이 다시 올라온다.

But from deep within, the claws rise once more.

밑바닥뿐 아니라 이번에는 양 벽에서도 슬금슬금 손아귀들이 일어난다. 모든 방향에서 태산을 붙잡기 위해 달려든다.

Not just from the ground, but now from the walls too, claws sneakily rise. They rush from all directions to seize Taesan.

태산이 방패를 집어넣고 마기를 모았다.

Taesan put away his shield and gathered his magic.

마법 폭발로 인해 냉기가 사방으로 흩어져 손아귀들의 돌진은 느렸다.

Due to the magical explosion, coldness scattered in all directions, slowing the charge of the claws.

가지고 있는 모든 마기를 통로로 집어넣는다.

He channels all the magic he possesses into the conduit.

너머의 시선이 보였다.

A gaze from beyond appeared.

그것이 태산을 보고 웃었다. 마기가 바닥이 남과 동시에, 태산은 통로에서 힘을 끄집어냈다.

It smiled upon seeing Taesan. As magic flowed from the ground and beyond, Taesan grasped power from the conduit.

[당신은 데카라비아의 일그러진 식생을 발동했다.]

You unleashed Dekaravia's twisted flora.

열린 통로에서 뿌리가 일어난다.

Roots arise from the open conduit.

그건 여태까지 태산이 소환한 그 어떠한 뿌리보다 굵었다.

They are thicker than any roots Taesan has summoned before.
Here's the translation of the text you provided:

And it was real, and it was firm. Taesan instinctively realized. The roots he had called his own until now were merely a part. This was the root itself that pierced through the world.

Kugugugugung!

The roots he held rose upwards.

Taesan soared along with the roots. Approaching hands were trampled and crushed by the momentum of the roots.

Energy flowed from the ancient shaman watching from above.

A very small energy, the moment it flowed out, amplified and amplified, becoming a huge wave.

Like a beast rushing in, the wave shattered the roots. The core of the roots that pierced through the world crumpled and distorted like a toothpick in an instant.

Overwhelming power and force. Mortals could not possibly comprehend, a kind of barrier.

Such a wave does not stop but continues to advance, aiming to engulf Taesan.

Taesan did not run away. He did not step back, nor did he try to evade; he moved forward.

[You have activated acceleration.]

He spread his wings and charged towards the ancient shaman.

He drew his sword.

At its tip, Taesan pours everything he has. Spirit, strength, or whatever else he gathered.

[You have activated blackness.]

A color as dark as ink spreads out. And a bright light begins to mix with it.
Here's the translation of the text:

"The gray light converges into darkness.

Enduring the sensation of limbs twisting, the sword is swung.

The waves of the ancient demon clash and are erased by gray.

Mountains give strength to the whole body, pushing forward even more.

The crashing waves attempt to twist the body with their mere approach. Nausea strikes at the dreadful intensity and strength, shaking the mind.

But the mountain presses onward.

Crushing and overcoming the transcendent power and intensity, moving forward.

Erasing and shattering the crashing waves. The transcendental intensity slowly fades beneath the gray.

Kugugugugung!

Space collapses. Abandoned land. The space formed by all that energy collapses gradually, unable to withstand the clash of forces.

And at the end.

The mountain arrives before the ancient demon.

Kaaang.

A small sound echoed.

The mountain's sword had touched the ancient demon's body.

The mountain smiled.

"I have won."
