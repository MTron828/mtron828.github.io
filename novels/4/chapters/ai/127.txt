Chapter 128: The Will of the World (1)

128. The World's Will (1)

Crashing sounds.

The sword clashed.

The palm of the mountain shook.

The second sword of the scarred battlefield unfolded. The dance of the spirits unfolded.

The trajectory was smoother and harder to read than before. Kang Jun-hyeok could not block for even 2 seconds and was hit in the arm.

"Uh, I can't block anymore."

Kang Jun-hyeok let out a tired face and shrugged his arm. Taesan also had a satisfied face.

The movement itself had changed. It was like the first time he learned swordsmanship and experienced a significant change. The movements he didn't understand or couldn't follow were now easy to follow.

In battle, especially in close combat, he had become much stronger than before.

It was a change worthy of being called the blessing of the gods.

"I also received it, but nothing changed. Instead, it seems like I'm losing more easily than before."

"Still, you've become stronger, haven't you?"

"That's okay, I guess."

Kang Jun-hyeok also felt that he had become stronger. He looked at Taesan with a gaze that was filled with admiration.

"You're going to crush that monster, aren't you?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The B-tier monster appeared, scattering its power.

Jang Joon-hyuk was overwhelmed. His confidence was shattered and he was paralyzed with fear.

However, Tae-san won against that monster.

He also received the recognition of the god of the labyrinth, and blessings from the god to all humans.

It was on a level where he couldn't even compare himself.

"Really... you're amazing."

"It's fine."

Tae-san shook his sword.

"Now, there's not much time left, so come quickly."

* * *

The blessing from the god of the labyrinth. It was a power given not only to Tae-san, but to all humanity.

Those who had completed their training began to fight each other and analyze their changes. And they were shocked. They couldn't help but be amazed at how strong they had become, and they were excited.

For those who had to go down into the labyrinth, becoming stronger was equivalent to increasing their survival rate. They expressed infinite gratitude to Tae-san, who had achieved this feat.

"Thank you!"

"Ah, Tae-san! You're here!"

Tae-san, who was overwhelmed by people clinging to him, went up to the rooftop of the building.

"This is too much of a burden."
Here is the translation of the text:

I hadn't received such a positive emotional response from others many times. Taesan received their greetings and went to find Kim Hui-yeon.

"What's the damage?"

"Not too much."

Kim Hui-yeon smiled wryly. However, there was no despair on her face.

"We've become stronger. Thanks to Taesan."

She also started to spar lightly. Just by doing so, she could feel the difference from before.

"When we return next time, I'll be much stronger."

She clenched her fist.

It was not a bad story for Taesan either. Not only ordinary players, but also hardcore mode players who had survived until the end, had become stronger.

Even if he was strong, he couldn't handle everything on his own.

As more people survived, more was possible, and the survival rate increased.

"It's a good thing."

He felt a sense of accomplishment from defeating the monster after struggling.

Most of all, he received not only divine blessing but also other skills.

And it was time to return to the labyrinth.

"So don't die and let's meet again next time."

Taesan closed his eyes, and the cracks in the labyrinth's walls swallowed him up.

When he opened his eyes again, he was inside the labyrinth.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Bonus for defeating a monster + 383] [First wave bonus + 53] [Second wave bonus + 45] [Third wave bonus + 50] [Fourth wave bonus + 8] [Secret quest bonus + 525] [Punishment bonus + 104] [Victory bonus + 112]

.

.

.

[Calculation complete] [1,280 points will be awarded.]

* * *

“Ah.”

1,280 points. The number was so laughable.

Taesan finally obtained this number after a long time. He sat down happily.

“Let's think about it calmly.”

[Gold is converted at a ratio of 1:10.] [Stats are converted at a ratio of 5:1.] [Skill proficiency is converted at a ratio of 10:1.]

The conversion ratio was like that. Taesan prioritized his thoughts. It was a very enjoyable deliberation.

‘As before, gold is useless.’
After converting the 1,280 points, it was only 12,800 gold. The stats were similar as well.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the current level, I could have become significantly stronger, but compared to my skills, my value was too low.

"Is it about skills again?"

I could have increased my skills by a total of 128%. It means that even after reaching the peak level of 100% for one skill, I still had room to grow.

The last time I returned, I had increased my magical skills. All aspects, including damage and casting speed, were enhanced and I have been using them effectively until now.

"What if I reach 100%?"

[Magical Skills] [Current level: 48%] [I can handle magic properly, and I can control fire, adjust temperature, and manipulate the wind.]

I had previously increased my skills by 44% using points, and I had been using them like that until now, but it only increased by 4%.

The skills obtained through points are usually used for skills that don't increase easily. Tai-san was trying to use points to increase his skills.

[Note: The ratio of point conversion changes when the skill level exceeds a certain level.]

"Uh?"

Tai-san's face twisted in disappointment.

"This didn't happen last time..."
Here is the translation of the text:

Even before the regression, I've had experiences where I've reached 100% using points, but there were no problems. But this is the first time I've heard that the ratio has changed. 

Tae-san thought for a moment before answering.

"It's because of magic, I suppose."

Rilis said. Magic's proficiency has increased very slowly. There are even those who would cut off their fingers for 1%.

Just looking at the skills Tae-san had obtained, it was clear that the proficiency had increased slower than any other skill.

And it would only get worse as proficiency increased. If it's possible to reach 100% with just one point, the balance would be broken, and it would be a kind of balance patch.

"Is it the same for other skills too?"

Airak's skills, such as the Black Wind's Sword, and the Dark Magic, etc. from the Labyrinth, all had limits like magic.

"It's a pity."

Tae-san understood, but it was a sad story to him. The path to increasing magic's proficiency was blocked. After thinking, he made a decision.

"This time, I'll strengthen everything overall."

He distributed 75% of the points and invested them in meaningful skills in small amounts. It was Tae-san's decision.
Here is the translation of the text:

It wasn't bad to invest all in one skill. If the proficiency of all skills increased by 5%, it would be strong enough. It was like betting on the potential of one skill.

However, there was no skill that could be invested in at the moment. The holy power was a skill that didn't know how to use, and the dark magic was still uncertain whether it was worth it. Therefore, the overall investment was correct.

Taishan made a decision and started distributing the points.

If distributed 5% at a time, a total of 25 skills could be strengthened. He invested based on the proficiency, starting from the skills that could change their content.

As a result, the content of many skills changed.

[The proficiency of the "Vision Secure" skill reached 100%. It evolved into a special passive skill [Eye of Harmony].]

The vision secure finally reached 100%, and it evolved into the eye of harmony.

[Special passive skill: Eye of Harmony] [Proficiency: 1%] [A shared view with all things. It can see not only what's outside, but also what's invisible.]

Taishan immediately tested it out.

[You have activated the Blazing Furnace.]

Boom!
Here is the translation of the text:

The system notification window and the blazing flames erupted simultaneously. Tai Shan, who had watched the entire process, was impressed. "Is this the case?"

Just a moment before the skill was activated, a mana accumulation was visible. Until now, I could only feel it, but I couldn't see it directly. The shock wave that was visible before my eyes was the real deal.

This level of power would make a significant difference in battle. The gap between what I felt and what I saw was huge. It was natural that the accuracy would be high if I confirmed it with my eyes and responded accordingly.

[I activated the skill: "Wind Sprint".]

After confirming the divine skill, I became even more certain. The wind was gathering, swirling, and moving forward, and I could see the power that was accompanying me throughout the process.

On the 29th floor, it would make a big difference in battling the divine.

[Special permanent activation skill: Battle Continuation] [Proficiency: 60%] [I can sustain a battle for a long time. Fatigue will not accumulate easily. I can fight in the best condition for a longer time. The time it takes to reach my physical limits has become much longer.]

The part about the time it takes to reach my physical limits has been added.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was a good change. I didn't get tired even after fighting for a few days, just like I said. It was all thanks to this skill, which allowed me to grab onto the S-grade in the previous world.

[Skill: Enhanced Sensitivity] [Proficiency: 61%] [Enhanced sensitivity. I can feel life and death. I can also sense the presence of others. I can sense things that are not visible even better.]

I can sense things that are not visible even better. If I combine it with the eyes of the wise, even a feeble attack would not have reached the Taesan.

The evidence of the skill battle left by Raki Ratas also changed its content. However, it was just a number added, and there was no significant change, so I was disappointed.

[Skill: No-Breath Attack] [Consumes 2 mana] [Proficiency: 62%] [I can move without breathing during combat. It lasts for about 30 seconds and allows me to move with full strength.]

I also noticed that the No-Breath Attack, which I had been using unconsciously, had changed.

First, the duration has become 30 seconds. Additionally, it now allows me to move with full strength.

In short, it's a change that allows me to move my body with all my might without feeling fatigue in my muscles, which has had a significant impact on combat.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Special Skill Activation: Acceleration] [Mana Consumption: 5] [Proficiency: 21%] [Accelerates towards the target.]

The acceleration effect has been further enhanced.

This skill, which rapidly attaches to enemies, has also undergone significant changes.

[Basic Magic: Frost Arrow] [Mana Consumption: 6] [Proficiency: 22%] [Launches a frost arrow. The target will receive significant damage if it lacks immunity. Attempts to apply the status effect [freeze] to the target. The strong cold can freeze the air.]

The frost arrow, which I have always favored, has also been strengthened. Considering the frequency of use, the speed was extremely slow. The proficiency of the magic skill has also increased slowly.

Let's try activating the frost arrow. The cold has become even stronger. Now, even the air beside me is frozen.

If the enemy is low-level, it will receive damage just by trying to dodge. I was satisfied.

In addition to this, there were also the battle's longing, the righteous duel, the proof of limits, the disrespect towards the strong, and the pseudo-religion, and so on.

Most of the skills that affect combat have had their proficiency increased. Although the content has not changed, the strengthening is certain.

I was satisfied. And I also gained a new skill.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Special Skill: Sadoha [Lakirata]] [The power of the god of battle and death, which is granted to the Lakirata's apostles for the first time after their birth. For 10 minutes, they can wield a part of the power. This skill cannot be used for a day after activation.]

The contract with the apostle that I've received so far.

It was a skill that could partially draw out the power that could be obtained when receiving the contract.

[I've seen many apostles who have received the contract, but I didn't know it could be reduced like this. It's amazing. Amazing.]

When I heard the ghost's words, which were full of excitement, it seemed that the skill was something I had never obtained before.

If what the ghost said was true, it would be a skill that could change the world.

"'It's enough as a reward for a B-grade monster.'"

With a happy face, Taesan checked the skills and two skills appeared in his eyes.

"What's the point of using this?"

[Divine Power] [Proficiency: 2%] [The power of the god. It is a blessing given by the god when someone is trusted and followed. It seems to have no meaning yet.]

I obtained it while defeating Hamon's angel, but there was no change. The ghost muttered vaguely.

[I've never heard of learning like this before. Is it a skill that can be used only when one has received divine power or divine authority?]

"I don't understand."
Here is the translation of the text:

At that time, the skill that increased the number of digits was meaningless. However, it was easy to understand. The power related to the gods was not usable by Taesan, who was not a god. I accepted it that way.

There was a skill that was truly unknown.

[Concept Skill: ???] [Proficiency: 12%] [Will of ??? Descends.]

"What kind of skill is this?"

[......Hmm?]

The ghost also seemed to be unclear about it.

"...I defeated the monster while my spiritual level rose."

The content that the proficiency increased by 8% was added.

However, the skill was still unknown. In the world of the master craftsman Half-ran, I was able to obtain the power of nature by defeating the monster, and then my proficiency increased. There was no consistency.

"I'll go check it out."

Taesan headed towards the master craftsman.
