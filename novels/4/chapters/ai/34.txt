Episode 35

35. 4th Floor, God of Victory. Valtaja (4)

[Aha?]

Forced out by the maze's changes, the ghost, belatedly realizing, chuckled.

"So you were living uncomfortably together?"

"Uh... why did the maze suddenly change..."

Seeming truly aggrieved, the woman sobbed. While living in her abode, she was suddenly chased out and found herself in the same room as an orc warrior. It must have been extremely bewildering.

"He's the one behind that."

"Huh?"

The woman's pupils widened in shock. Glancing briefly at Taesan, he vaguely blurred his words, as if it were unbelievable.

"She seems like an adventurer who just entered the maze..."

"Well, for now. Let's talk about it later. Let's handle this first."

The warrior drew his sword. Taesan faced him.

"Uh, um..."

The woman murmured, interrupting the atmosphere.

"Just a moment. The adventurer..."

"Is it okay?"

With a voice filled with trust and belief, the ghost spoke.

"For now, observe."

Despite making a fuss from behind, Moore's noise was barely audible to Taesan's ears. His gaze was fixed solely on the orc warrior.

"Krrrk."

The warrior grinned contentedly as he swung his sword. The massive greatsword, fitting for his robust frame, aimed at Taesan.

"Are you my target?"

Since the maze had changed, he could kill the woman at any moment if she remained here.

But the warrior ignored her like a bug.

Only after Taesan approached did he move and thrust his sword towards him.

They accepted the trial of the gods. It meant Taesan was the sole target.

So he intended to respond in kind.

Taesan stepped forward.

"You activated Acceleration."

The wind slapped his face.

Already swift due to high agility, he became even faster thanks to Acceleration.

The warrior hastily raised his sword, but Taesan had already passed by.

"31 damage to Orc Warrior."

"Krrrk!"

The warrior shook his greatsword roughly. Taesan confronted him. The clash of swords echoed loudly throughout the maze.

Indeed, he was a boss. The power he felt was slightly insufficient compared to before. Despite entering the 4th floor and significantly increasing in vitality and leveling up, he was not overmatched.
And the warrior also possesses swordsmanship.

The greatsword moves smoothly, aiming for Taesan's openings. Seeing the trajectory aimed to sever his arm, Taesan activated a skill.

"You activated Counter. You retaliate against the next opponent's attack."

His body moves naturally. He parries the warrior's sword and thrusts back into his chest.

However, the warrior does not take it quietly. He moves his hands and feet to minimize the damage.

But his stance inevitably crumbles, and Taesan doesn't miss the opportunity.

"Kaaang!"

The sword strikes down on the orc. The orc's knees buckle, but he doesn't fall. No matter how much force is applied, he maintains his stance.

"You activated Heavy Strike. The next attack deals significant damage."

Heavy Strike.

A powerful attack.

It's not just increased damage; it literally adds weight and force. It was a hidden attribute unknown to most users.

"Kiiiiick!"

Under the added force, the orc is pressed down as if crushed.

Desperately resisting to break free, but hindered by Taesan's movements.
Unable to withstand the weight, his body slowly begins to be cut by his own sword.

The warrior's face turns red.

"Kururruk!"

[The orc warrior has entered a frenzy state.]

Frenzy triggered from the warrior's level. Its effects include reduced cognitive abilities and doubled strength stats.

The orc forcefully pushes the sword. Due to the sudden reversal in strength difference, most players panic and lose their lives.

But Taesan already knew the conditions for triggering frenzy.

As soon as frenzy was activated, Taesan widened the distance, causing the warrior's sword to futilely slash through the air.

The disoriented warrior staggers with weakened strength.

"You activated Acceleration."

The accelerated body pierces through the warrior's chest.

"Kururruk...."

With a face filled with admiration, the warrior disappears.

"You have defeated the orc warrior." "You have defeated the boss on the 4th floor. Basic reward obtained: Ashen Wristguards." "You have identified hidden elements on the 4th floor. Reward obtained: ???" "Your level has increased." "You have acquired the Heavy Greatsword."

Taesan sheathed his sword.

* * *
Even though it was a boss, victory wasn't that difficult.

I easily defeated the Goblin Chieftain on the 3rd floor.

The Goblin Lord was irregular, but even an enhanced normal boss with about 30% increase wouldn't be a match for Taesan. It wasn't just simple stats; it was a difference in experience and information.

Unfortunately, there was no victory reward from the archenemy. It meant that opponents of the warrior's caliber were no longer classified as difficult, and indeed, that was the difficulty level.

However, it didn't mean the rewards were meager.

With all the rewards from vitality increase and level up combined, health increased by 50 points, agility increased by 4 points, strength by 6 points, and intelligence by 1 point.

Already, in terms of strength stats, he was almost approaching the stats he had achieved before.

Even Lee Tae-yeon didn't reach these stats before reaching the 10th floor, and considering the exponential growth as he descended deeper into the dungeon, it was a remarkably fast pace.

The shield had also increased by 10% of health, so it was now at 17.

And due to continuous fighting, the contents of several skills had changed.
[Special Passive Skill: Endurance in Battle] [Proficiency: 20%] [Can sustain battles for extended periods. Fatigue accumulates slowly. Increased ability to fight in optimal condition for longer durations.]

Endurance in Battle is a skill that doesn't increase proficiency easily. However, perhaps due to numerous battles with formidable enemies, Taesan reached 20% proficiency by the 4th floor.

Now, he wouldn't easily tire out from ordinary tasks. Even without rest, he could fight for over an hour continuously. Achieving 20% proficiency signifies just that.

[Special Passive Skill: Enhanced Sensory Perception] [Proficiency: 21%] [Sensory perception is enhanced. Can sense things like vitality. Can even sense squares.]

Square confirmation has been added. Now, it was practically safe from being hit from behind.

There were more rewards yet to be revealed, but they couldn't be confirmed immediately. Perhaps due to enhanced sensory perception, he continued to feel suspicious gazes directed towards him.

"Oh, how could an adventurer from the 4th floor defeat a warrior, and so easily..."

The woman muttered as if it were impossible.

"...Who are you?"

"The player."

Taesan replied solemnly.

* * *

The woman, who had been saying it was unbelievable not long ago, seemed to regain her composure after hearing from the ghost and approached Taesan with a calm expression.
"Ah, well. Thank you. Thanks to you, I survived."

Taesan mumbled as he chewed on goblin meat, nodding slightly. The woman looked at him as if intrigued.

"Someone actually eats that... Is it tasty?"

"It's not."

It tasted awful, but it could roughly fill his stomach. There were times when the goblin's humanoid form made him feel queasy, but now he couldn't even remember those moments.

"So, who are you?"

The warrior knew. He must have survived here for quite a long time.

The woman with blue hair brushed dust off her robe.

"I'm Rilis. A seeker of magic. I came here to learn profound mysteries."

"Magic?"

"It seems you come from a world without magic, as the warrior told me... Such a fascinating world."

Rilis replied with a look of wonder.

"Magic is something only those with the talent can learn. It's innate. I didn't have the talent, but I wanted to learn magic more than anyone else. That's why I came here."

She murmured with a wistful expression.

"This place is a labyrinth. A place where you can find dreams. Thanks to it, I've achieved results."
[Very slight, truly like a firefly.]

Rilis's face wrinkled at the comment mixed with laughter.

She waved her hand. Light shimmered. And filled the room.

Within the brightened view, Rilis grumbled.

"Yeah. I couldn't go further than this. This damn labyrinth discriminates against people."

[But still, you gained something you thought you wouldn't, right? You should be satisfied enough.]

"It's still not enough? I didn't come all this way just to obtain this."

Taesan looked at her with a serious expression.

She said her achievements were very slight.

But the light magic she manifested was a magic that most people desired but would not obtain except for the lucky few.

Since the effects on the staff were random, the chances of obtaining the desired magic were very low.

Taesan was no exception to this.

Rilis, who didn't notice Taesan's gaze, continued to grumble incessantly.

"So, I've been stuck here researching, and suddenly the room was wrecked and I was driven out. Why did this happen?"

[I told you. It's because of this guy.]

"Don't lie to me."
Rilis frowned.

"Yes, I'll admit it's strong. But it doesn't seem like it's at the level of manipulating laws, right? Even you, sir knight, said it was impossible."

[Well, this one is impossible.]

The ghost replied calmly.

[But there are those for whom it is possible, right?]

Rilis's pupils dilated as she pondered deeply.

"Surely not a god?"

[Knows it well.]

"But to change the labyrinth, they would also have to sacrifice their own domain."

[To him, it's worth it.]

"Ah..."

Rilis sent a gaze filled with wonder towards Taesan.

"Who gets stuck trying to learn magic and complains endlessly..."

[Now you bring that up?]

"It's just a complaint. This world is truly unfair."

Rilis sighed and stretched her waist.

"Sigh. If the labyrinth is in this state, I need to find a new vantage point."

[Going down?]

"Are there any other options? I need to go and find the secret chamber to settle in. If the 5th floor is like this, I'll have to go up to the 6th floor." 

[Can you go down?]
5th floor has turned into a straight line. As stronger monsters appear on the 6th floor, breaking through without any issues will likely be tough.

"It shouldn't be much of a problem."

Rilis clacked her fingers. An opaque curtain enveloped her, hiding her figure from view.

"Invisibility magic? You've learned that too?"

"If you can't tell until the 9th floor, you just have to go down with this."

Before she left, she looked at Taesan.

"Thanks for helping me out. I'd like to repay you somehow, but... I don't have anything to give."

"I do."

Taesan said calmly. Rilis looked puzzled.

"Am I really penniless? Even the catalysts and materials are all gone."

"The power you possess."

Rilis' face hardened.

"Magic. I want to learn that."

* * *

"Um..."

She trailed off. Her face showed reluctance.

"Sorry, but this is something I've dedicated my whole life to learning. I'm grateful for your help, but this is something I can't just give away."

She declined Taesan's offer.

He had expected this reaction to some extent. Judging by her words, she must have entered here to learn magic. He couldn't teach something like that to just anyone.
From here on, it was a time for negotiation. When Taesan was about to speak, the ghost spoke first.

"Just tell her?"

"Huh?"

Rilis looked surprised and glanced at Taesan. He also looked at the ghost.

The ghost began calmly.

"You have nothing, right? Is there anything you can repay with?"

"Well, that's..."

"You have one thing: your magic. I understand its value to you, but objectively, it's nothing special. Isn't it enough as payment for saving your life?"

"Well... that's true, but..."

Still, she hesitated. Value is relative, and her magic was undoubtedly precious to her.

"And it's not a bad deal for you."

"Huh?"

"How far down have you gone?"

"Uh... to the 9th floor."

She replied quietly, seemingly embarrassed. The ghost spoke as if expecting such an answer from a hero.

"Right. With your skills, you probably can't go any deeper. But he's an adventurer delving into the labyrinth, recognized by the gods. Naturally, he can go deeper and find things that are deeper. Isn't this an opportunity for you to learn magic you haven't learned?"

"Oh."
Rilis's pupils dilated.

["I think it's a mutually beneficial deal, what do you think?"]

"Hmm, let me think...."

Rilis's face brightened.

"Then it's settled! Alright! I'll teach you!"

Taesan nodded hesitantly. He glanced at the ghost. The ghost said nothing.

Rilis spread her arms with joy.

"Hey! I just realized you're an adventurer! This will make life more fun. Right now I don't have anything to teach you because I'm at level 6, but let's meet then!"

"Sure."

She clapped her hands. There was no sign of the aura. Her body slowly disappeared until nothing was visible.

"See you on level 6!"

She left. That thought came to mind. There was nothing really to feel and nothing to expect. If she doesn't say anything, she won't be able to detect her.

'That's magic.'

It seemed well worth the investment.

Taesan looked at the ghost with suspicion.

"What?"

["What's up?"]

"Why are you suddenly being nice?"

["What? Am I doing well?"] 

The ghost grumbled.
