Chapter 480

480. 91th floor, Uroboros (1)

Clearing the quest.

At the same time, the tense body collapses. The burden of forced resistance to an unbearable power overwhelms it.

Tae-san sat down, unable to deny his condition. Although there was no physical damage, his body had reached its limits due to the strong burden.

The Puppeteer's limbs trembled and collapsed. The space opened up, and the mage appeared.

"Ah, that's too fast, isn't it? I thought it would take at least a few months, but..."

The Puppeteer or decoy was actually the mage's true self.

The mage, who appeared, tried to restore Tae-san using his creator's authority.

However, not all of the mage's powers were infused into Tae-san's body.

"Now, I'll be going my separate way."

The mage let out a sigh.

"I'm unable to restore him. Let's take a break first."

Tae-san nodded and closed his eyes.

The holy and black colors rapidly filled the floor.
Here is the translation of the text:

The speed was so fast that it couldn't be compared to the past. Tai Shan's physical body was recovering at an incredible rate.

Not long after, Tai Shan's condition had improved to some extent. The magician who had been watching him couldn't help but ask:

"Is that the power of the new boundary line you've discovered and understood?"

"Yes," Tai Shan replied affirmatively. The magician smiled wryly.

The true ability of the boundary line was not to break the laws, but to intervene, corrupt, and interfere.

Using this ability, he made the blood of the newborn and the world-crushing god harmonize with each other, and even corrupted his own domain to create a boundary line. The magician said:

"Is that the true nature of the boundary line? I didn't think it was just about breaking the laws, but it's even more surprising than I imagined. With your current abilities, you might be able to wield your sword against other transcendent beings as well."

"Well," Tai Shan said noncommittally.

Although the words were filled with pure praise, Tai Shan shook his head.

"In reality, it's almost impossible."

Tai Shan could corrupt the laws.

Just as he had done to the magician, he could intervene in his own domain as a transcendent being, forcing a path and making it possible.

Note: The text appears to be a scene from a fantasy novel or story, and the translation is based on my understanding of the context and language used.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was undoubtedly a remarkable feat. No one could accomplish such an extraordinary feat. In fact, it was as if we were on the verge of being attacked by an unblockable sword.

However, ultimately, we had to plunge the sword into the situation to make it meaningful.

After activating the dissonance, we could use it relatively stably, but the range of corruption was limited to our physical body and his sword.

It meant that we had to fight a close-range battle against an overpowered opponent, and it was unlikely that he would surrender willingly.

Moreover, the burden falling on him was immense. It was as if he was breaking the rules or altering the laws the moment he entered an unauthorized area. It was like using a trump card in a battle that could only be used once. 

"Even so, the power is still unchanged."

However, the emotions locked in the magician's eyes did not change.

The effects of the boundary line that the mountain had handled until then were powerful, but they were not on the same level as being unable to respond. It was enough to respond to the gods when facing them.

However, if we intervened in the laws and altered them, then the response method would be useless. Would any defense be effective in twisting one's own domain?
Here is the translation of the text:

If one approaches Tai Shan, even the strongest transcendent being in the universe would have to risk their life. It was an achievement that couldn't be put into words.

The mage's eyes narrowed as he gazed at Tai Shan.

The boundary was stronger than he had thought, with an otherworldly power that was incomprehensible.

He had realized that by purifying the high-ranking official's corruption and freeing him, he could create a new law. But who would have thought he could actually change the law itself and create a new one?

The current state of the universe was a force that denied its own existence.

This kind of power couldn't be obtained through sudden enlightenment or a fleeting epiphany. It was only possible through accumulating and accumulating the fundamental energy of one's own being.

"'Is it starting?'"

The mage also had some understanding of Tai Shan's essence.

After a brief moment of contemplation, he applauded.

"Well, you did well. You cleared the quest and achieved the results I was hoping for. So, I should give you a reward that's commensurate with it."

Clearing the 90th floor.

When you clear the final floor of each theme, you're rewarded with a reward that's commensurate with your achievement. Just as expected, numerous system windows appeared in front of Tai Shan.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [You have obtained the wizard's hat.] [You have obtained ???.] [You have reached the 90th floor and obtained the title "One Who Heads Towards the Height".]

[You have perfectly cleared the 90th floor and obtained the title "One Who Steps into Another Area".] [You have perfectly cleared all floors up to the 90th and obtained the title "The Perfect One".] [You have grown and accumulated numerous powers and abilities, and have arrived at this place. Your experiences so far have crystallized and become your power. You have obtained the title "Understanding of Skills".] [You have stepped into a deep and profound place. The beings that will appear before you are cosmic beings. You must break through them with your own power alone. You have obtained the special active skill "Alone and Unwavering".] [Many cosmic beings are watching your actions.]

"And this is a service."

The wizard waves his hand, and his power is infused into the mountain.

[You have escaped the labyrinth system and obtained your own things. The labyrinth system has begun to be subjugated by you, and you have obtained the special active skill "Your Own Thing".]

"Please check once."
Here is the translation of the text:

The wizard made a gentle gesture. Tae-san confirmed the reward he had obtained.

"...This is it."

[Titile: One Who Heads Towards the Heights] [Currently moving towards the high places that almost no one can reach.] [Strength + 5000] [Mana + 2000] [Vitality + 3000] [Attack Power + 1000] [Defense Power + 1000]

The numbers were extremely high.

Another area had also reached a similar level, with the title of "Perfect One". Tae-san looked at the wizard. The wizard spoke with a natural tone.

"You have reached the end of the labyrinth. Then, you should give a corresponding reward."

"...Do all the people who reach the 90th floor get this kind of reward?"

"That's not it. Your labyrinth difficulty is particularly high, so I think it's a corresponding service."

Then, Tae-san could understand. He had cleared the quest on the 86th to 90th floors.

In reality, he had almost cleared the original labyrinth, so it was natural for the reward to be strengthened.
Here is the translation of the text:

[SPECIAL PERMANENT SKILL: Alone and Unwavering] [Proficiency: 1%] [A person who is not affected by anything. They possess a strong resistance to any interference that tries to affect them.]

It was said that this skill was something that could affect everything. The system was referring to everything, and it really was everything.

This skill seemed to have the effect of resistance all at once. Although it wasn't particularly noticeable, it was a skill that could provide consistent help if possessed.

[Title: The Enlightenment of the Skill] [The enlightenment of many things that you have accumulated] [The limit of the skill's proficiency is removed.]

"What?"

The great mountain gazed at the mage.

"This system of the labyrinth is originally limited to mortal existence."

The mage smiled wryly.

"I could somehow cover even immortality, but now you have transcended the realm of the extraordinary. Normally, the proficiency of the skill should have risen to a normal level, but it was blocked by the system's limitations and therefore stagnated."

The system that was supposed to assist and help the adventurer was actually a restraint for the great mountain.

"That restraint is broken."

"Good."

The great mountain was also thinking about it. His expectation was that the skill's proficiency had risen too high.

The great mountain opened the skill window.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was unclear whether the skill had increased due to the removal of restrictions or the accumulation of expertise. Some skills had increased by over 10%, while others had only increased by around 3-4%. The important point was that the expertise of almost all skills had increased.

Some skills had also undergone changes in content or had reached 100% and evolved into new skills.

"Is this skill also a skill that can remove restrictions?"

"It's okay to think that way."

[Special permanent activation skill: Your own thing] [Expertise: 1%] [This skill was obtained by assisting the maze and became yours, leaving the magical realm where it was created by the maze's creator. It can only exert a small influence at this point.]

"Now, skills obtained through assisting the maze, which were not fully yours, are now perfectly synchronized with you and can be used according to your intentions, carrying your prestige."

The skill had become Tai Shan's own possession.

"Of course, it's still a weak influence, but... the foundation has been laid. When you become stronger and reach a high level, the skill will completely break free from my grasp and become fully yours."
Here is the translation of the text:

This change was also acceptable. The skills he created using the laws of the labyrinth, such as addition and copying, were not unique to him. Although he put in a lot of effort and strength to create those skills, it was difficult for him to claim full ownership.

Getting the ownership of those skills was definitely a gain.

"Verify the specific changes yourself."

"Now, shall I leave?"

"I have a lot to do, including external matters and designing things for the levels ahead. It's very busy, you know."

The mage opened the space.

"We'll definitely meet again on the 91st floor. It's self-explanatory."

"Thank you."

The mage revealed that he had intentionally moved himself to take on the quest of the floor to help him realize his new abilities. It was clear that the mage's help was necessary for him to discover new powers.

"There's no need to be grateful. I just created a space for you. I also thought it was ambiguous, but you're the one who realized it."

The mage looked at Taesan, who was half-turned away, and asked:

"You used the blood of the Shinhye and the World Annihilator this time. Do you have anything else besides that?"

"I do."
Here is the translation of the text:

From Levienov, he obtained the fragments of divine soul and sacred soul, which were still dormant in his inventory.

"'It's still premature to take a shot. Let me take a look first.'"

Just now, he was exhausted from dealing with his physical body. He was planning to strengthen himself a bit more and then try again.

"'But I've learned one thing from this incident.'"

"'What is it?'"

"'I'm unable to reach the same level as you.'"

The mage did not deny his words with confidence.

The mountain was twisted.

He harmonized his vital energy and blood essence to elevate his physical body to a higher level. It was impossible for him to reach that level in this world, at least.

"'I am not twisted.'"

He was twisted in his fundamental nature.

Begin.

The answer was there.

The mage laughed.

"'Search diligently. I'll help you.'"

The mage inserted his body into the space.

* * *

The mountain did not descend to the 91st floor. First, he needed to properly confirm the things he had obtained.

The first thing to be confirmed was set.

Skills.
Many skills' proficiency levels have risen, and their contents have changed. Moreover, the proficiency levels of some skills have reached 100%.

As a result, he was able to regain the skills he had obtained in his previous life.
