Chapter 144

144. 32nd floor, advanced martial arts. Ability Sword (1)

As Taesan moved to the next room, the ghost asked with a curious tone:

[You've been thinking about something for about an hour, right? What were you thinking about just now?]

"It's nothing. I just went back to thinking about my basics."

His strength's foundation is his skills. Martial arts or stats are all supplementary.

However, this trial is a martial arts trial. He couldn't use his skills.

So, Taesan naturally thought he couldn't use his skills.

But soon, Taesan remembered one thing.

"Since I've already pulled that effect into my body, I can use it."

He had used it all along, even before he learned the skill.

So, he doesn't need to be attached to the skill. If he can't use it, he can pull the effect out himself.

Thinking this, he started the battle and naturally found himself able to use a few skills.

[That's...... surprisingly good.]
Here is the translation of the text:

When the ghost heard the story of Tae-san, it burst out laughing, as if it had undergone a transformation of thought. The ghost had never thought of things in such a way before.

Clang!

Just as it was telling the story, a monster appeared.

Tae-san faced the armored knight.

* * *

Clang!

The knight drew his sword, and the ghost spoke in a nervous tone.

[I'm going to die from frustration.]

"Let's take our time and check," Tae-san said.

Tae-san pulled out two swords.

He charged at the knight.

Ka-ching!

The swords clashed. Tae-san's movement was rougher than before, unlike his usual smooth and refined technique.

[It seems my swordsmanship has changed. It's a bit rougher and clumsier than before.]

The ghost's swordsmanship was refined. It had few weaknesses and its movements were precise.

However, Tae-san's current movement was rougher and clumsier, with weaknesses visible all over.

[But it's not bad.]

"This is my swordsmanship."

It's not something he received from someone else, but a technique that Tae-san himself created.

As he becomes more skilled, his technique will only become more refined. If he reaches the pinnacle, it will be a skill that suits him better than the sword of the Storm-Scarred Knight.
Here is the translation of the text:

"If this is solved by raising the proficiency level, I'll be fine with it."

"This is settled."

From now on, this is the real thing.

The ability sword he created was a sword technique that linked with skills as its name suggested. Of course, the content of a few skills had changed.

One of them was the acceleration that had been triggered for the first time.

[Special trigger skill: Acceleration] [Mana consumption: 5] [Proficiency level: 21%] [Accelerates towards the target.]

[Condition: Advanced sword technique [Ability sword] [Not only does the body accelerate, but the speed of the sword also accelerates. This effect continues to trigger after consuming additional mana when the timing is correct.] [Oh oh oh.]

The ghost couldn't hide his emotions and let out a sigh.

[It's really changed. And it's really attached to the condition of the ability sword. This is really outside the specifications.]

The ghost, who had been reading the content with great interest, read the next sentence.

[Does it continue to trigger when the timing is correct?]

"That's what the condition is. I roughly understood it earlier," he said with a casual tone.

Kaang!

The peak of the mountain gave strength to the sword. He kicked the fleeing article towards the back.

[You have triggered acceleration.]
Here is the translation of the text:

As his physical body accelerated, so did the speed of his sword. Taesan drew his sword towards the journalist.

Hmph!

The journalist blocked it. At the same time, Taesan moved his other hand's sword.

Whoosh!

The journalist's body was pierced.

[This is really amazing.]

The ghost let out a mocking laugh.

In essence, the speed of wielding the sword had doubled, which meant that his agility had also increased by a significant amount. It was a skill that was almost impossible to compare to others without any constraints.

Taesan didn't stop attacking, and the ghost, who had been watching calmly, noticed that there was a certain interval in his movements.

[Was it necessary to synchronize the timing of the sword strikes?]

"It's quite troublesome to activate."

The interval between the sword strikes and the journalist's blocking, or the interval between the two, had to be synchronized. Although it was relatively easy to learn when adding numbers, it was different from adding numbers because the conditions changed according to the opponent's response, making it not so easy.

[Since we need to synchronize the timing, it's not easy to make significant changes... The pattern will become fixed.]

"Maybe so."

Note: The text appears to be a conversation between two characters, Taesan and a ghost, discussing Taesan's sword fighting skills and the complexity of synchronizing the timing of his sword strikes.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan slowed down the speed of his sword for a moment. As a result, his acceleration was immediately restored, and his body speed returned to its original state.

He struggled to maintain his posture and drew his sword towards the knight.

[You activated the Strong Impact.]

Caaang!

The knight was sent flying far away.

The Strong Impact also required coordination with acceleration. Since the knight flew backward, he couldn't attack and was unable to synchronize his attacks, so the Strong Impact ended.

The ghost judged calmly.

[It's clear that it's powerful, but its weaknesses are also obvious.]

He drew the skill's effect to swordsmanship. If we just look at it, it's unbelievable. The Strong Impact and acceleration alone can bring strength and agility to a level close to perfection.

However, the constraints were too severe.

[It depends on whether the opponent responds or not. It's a passive swordsmanship. I'll take the initiative.]

If the opponent is a mage, he couldn't properly activate it. It's because approaching was difficult in the first place.

It was the same even if the opponent was a monster as strong as a giant. It's hard to attack a powerful enemy with a single timing.
Here is the translation:

In addition to the above situations, it seemed difficult to use in various scenarios where the opponent is a ghost-type or uses natural forces like a spirit. [Are other skills similar?]

"All have specific conditions attached."

The case of the Flowing Technique was similar. The opponent's attack had to be within a certain time frame to swing the Heavenly Sword, and then it would activate consecutively.

Each jump, consecutive attack, and so on, had its own conditions.

[It's troublesome.]

"However, it's a usable sword technique."

[It's a good sword technique.]

The ghost nodded in agreement. Although the conditions were demanding and passive, it was still an excellent sword technique.

If the conditions were met, the skill could pull stats up by almost double.

Moreover, the opponent could not know what skills the Heavenly Sword possessed. If they were to retaliate, they would likely be caught off guard, just like the ghost.

As a result, the opponent's movements would naturally be limited, allowing the Heavenly Sword to seize the initiative.

If things went as planned, it wouldn't be that hard to fulfill the conditions.

And the stronger one becomes, the more difficult it will be to counter the Heavenly Sword's skills.

Those with skills like acceleration, jumping, and consecutive attacks know the activation effects of their skills.
Here is the translation of the text:

Based on the information he had, he was going to respond, but he was definitely going to get caught up in the skills of Taesan, which had a completely different effect.

"It's satisfying."

Quack.

Taesan wrote the article and laughed.

This level was beyond what he had initially expected.

He was still immature. His martial arts skills were clumsy, and the activation of his skills was not yet familiar.

However, as time passed, he would gradually improve.

As his proficiency increased, the conditions would gradually ease.

The effects of his skills would also gradually increase, and he would affect more skills.

As Taesan became stronger, many things would change. It was likely that his ultimate main skill would become a perfect addition and multiplication.

"Good."
He was very satisfied.

* * *

Taesan continued to practice martial arts while navigating the labyrinth.

Despite the large difference in stats with monsters, he was still not very skilled in martial arts, so he could gradually become more proficient even with just light battles. He gradually increased his proficiency and explored the 32nd floor.

[Magic Stone Enfused with Strength] [Magic + 30] [A magic stone that hates those who use magic, yet the magic power within still remains.]

"It was good."
Here is the translation of the text:

I received a reward for entering the secret room, which was a magic equipment. I had thought of giving it to Rilise as a gift and learning magic from him.

Taesan continued to advance and arrived at the boss.

The boss was a knight wearing black armor. He had a fierce and swift movement, and his intelligence was on the level of a beast. He had a strength that would make anyone who faced him for the first time feel astonished.

"Perfect practice partner."

[I activated my ultimate technique.]

Kaang!

The knight was knocked back, and Taesan immediately chased after him, swinging his sword again. Since the timing of the attack was synchronized, my ultimate technique was continuously activated.

Through several attacks, Taesan defeated the 32nd-floor boss.

[My swordsmanship skill with the Abililty Sword has increased by 1%.]

Taesan successfully activated his ultimate technique continuously until he defeated the boss.

[I'm getting used to this speed quickly. It seems that my swordsmanship is well-suited to me. The speed is comparable to that of a storm.]

"Very good."

It was a swordsmanship that didn't allow for any laughter.

Another advantage was that it was enjoyable. After satisfying the conditions, I enjoyed the process of activating and maintaining it.

It was a feeling I hadn't felt in a long time.

Taesan confirmed the 32nd-floor clear reward.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Pi-tu-so-neui gab-oe-seum] [Defense + 40] [This armor was worn by a forgotten person who died. Its soul has flowed into this place.]

Defense 40. It was a high number. Taesan wore the armor and muttered to himself.

"This is nothing special."

40 was similar to the total effect of all equipment when he cleared the hard mode.

It's amazing that one piece of equipment can now handle all that. It felt like a long time since the gap had been felt again.

[??? was used.] [A thorn from the red rose bush was obtained.]

"Is this a material item?"

It didn't show up as equipment.

[Red Rose Thorn] [I pulled out a thorn from the red rose bush that guards the witch's garden. It will become very sharp if attached somewhere.]

"Ah, it's a material."

If taken to the blacksmith, it will be turned into equipment. When Taesan tried to pick up the thorn, the whip on his wrist slapped his arm tightly.

"...What do you want?"

The whip seemed to be urging him on, wrapping around his arm. Taesan threw the thorn away, and the whip suddenly sprang to life, catching the thorn.

[The arm guard with a life force has caught the red rose thorn. Attack power + 20]

"Oh."
Here is the translation of the text:

The attack power rose sharply, and a sharp thorn grew on the whip. It seemed to be enjoying itself as it struck the arm with a "thwack-thwack" sound.

"Ah, it's a bit too much."

Although the damage was slight, the thorn pierced the skin and made it bleed.

"What's this?"

This equipment is a self-strengthening tool that swallows its own items. I've never heard of such a thing. Even a ghost would be taken aback, trembling with fear.

[Is this a self-strengthening equipment? I've never seen anything like this. Is it really good?]

There was no need to bother the blacksmith with such a trivial matter, and the stats were already quite high. It was definitely useful, but it was still a mystery.

"I'll ask about this later."

The shopkeeper might have known the secret. After completing the task, Taesan headed back up before descending to the 33rd floor.

The divine battlefield spoken of by Barigan was located on the 33rd floor.

Before going there, I thought I would be fully prepared.

Taesan returned to the 31st floor to find Relis. She greeted him with a bright smile.

"Ah, you're back? I thought you'd forgotten about me!"

"I didn't find anything worthy of offering."

Taesan handed over a magical stone. Relis received it with a single smile and began to pray.
Here is the translation of the text:

It wasn't long before the aura of the god of magic was felt.

Tae-san gazed at the aura with a blank expression.

"'It feels different from before.'"

A skill that has evolved one level higher in the world of Half-ran.

Although its true identity is unknown, the ghost said that one can sense its intention.

As a result, the power of the gods, which had previously felt distant, now felt slightly closer.

While Tae-san was trying to grasp the power, the release came to an end and he took a deep breath.

"'It's over.'"

[You have learned the beginner magic [Seal].]

"'It's still beginner magic.'"

"'Ah, I have something to say about that.'"

"What is it?"

"'This is it.'"

Rilissa's face was ambiguous, looking both happy and scared at the same time.

"'I don't know if this is a joke from God or a serious matter, but I think it's a joke, since we're only at the 30th floor, it's impossible.'"

"'Explain it clearly. What are you talking about?'"

She said with a very ambiguous expression.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The God of Magic said when receiving this tribute. He will provide a higher level of magic soon."

"Is it higher than the primary level of magic?"

"Yes, it is. Relic nodded his head."

"Now you have been granted intermediate-level magic!"
