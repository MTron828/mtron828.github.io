84. 16th Floor, Harfran the Dullahan Who Refines Dreams (2)

Blacksmith Harfran.

Lee Taeyeon mentioned that he rarely showed emotions and was rather blunt. She also expressed deep gratitude for him, saying she wouldn't have made it through her tough times without him.

While NPCs and gods looked at her with disdain and scorn, Harfran viewed her not with contempt but simply as a trading partner. He had been one of the few respites during her difficult times.

"I am a blacksmith. Do you know what kind of job that is?"

Taesan nodded. Harfran continued,

"Monsters here drop two things: equipment and materials. There are several ways to handle materials. One is to sell them at shops, and the other is to use them as materials for equipment. That's basically it."

Clang.

The sound of hammering echoed. Heat shimmered.

"Bring me materials. Then I'll craft the equipment you desire."

This was precisely why one would seek out a blacksmith.
Monsters or secret rooms can yield equipment, but the type is random. Whether a ring, weapon, or staff appears is entirely unpredictable. The chances of obtaining the desired equipment are extremely low.

However, using a blacksmith changes the story. As you can choose the desired equipment yourself, reliance on chance diminishes.

While the equipment made by the blacksmith may not be as high in quality as drops, it is still useful. Lee Taeyeon had received a lot of equipment because of this.

"How much?"

"It's your first time, so I'll provide a service. It's free."

"Oh."

It wasn't bad considering she was already short on money. Harfran continued his explanation.

"If you intend to trade with me further, remember this. I don't discriminate against trading partners. Whether poor or guiding the path of sin, it doesn't matter to me. What matters are materials and equipment. If you want to talk about that, do it right now."

"Was there someone like that?"

"There was. They were quite noisy about wanting to be exclusive."

Harfran frowned. He seemed to be referring to someone guiding the path of sin. Overcoming that meant Harfran himself wasn't weak.

"I have no intention of doing that."

"Alright then. What do you want?"

After a moment of thought, Taesan replied.
"Wrist guards."

Among the armor Taesan was currently wearing, wrist guards were the least valuable. Harfran nodded.

"Give me the materials."

Taesan opened his inventory and took out various materials: numerous pieces of leather, tooth fragments, and the like scattered about.

"...Quite a lot."

The dwarf glanced at Taesan with a slightly disgusted look and collected the materials.

"Come back in thirty minutes."

"So soon?"

Taesan was somewhat surprised; he had expected it to take at least a day. Harfran replied gruffly,

"It's not deep-level materials nor something rare, so there's no reason for it to take long."

Thirty minutes. It was enough time to tidy up a floor and return. Taesan left the room. Harfran took out the materials and said,

"Come back later."

Thunk.

The door closed. Taesan began to break through the rooms.

His pace wasn't particularly fast. Thirty minutes was a considerable amount of time. Yet, with determination, he could advance swiftly enough that it wouldn't take even ten minutes.
However, even considering that, the speed was unreasonable. Thirty minutes per floor. Junhyuk would burst into laughter if he saw this, taking several days to clear just one.

He broke through the secret room and secured his reward.

[Sturdy Cross Shield] [Attack +5] [Defense +20] [An extremely sturdy shield. It looks like it could even block a ballista.]

Right now, the shield didn't hold much meaning for him, but if he sold it at a shop, he could fetch a decent price. Alternatively, he could take it to Harfran. Since he mentioned not just materials but also equipment recombination.

After finishing the secret room and defeating the boss, he noticed it was larger and more colorful than other races. Although it was a monster that exerted physical strength, it disappeared when he sharpened the frost arrow.

[Hammer] [Equipment repair is now possible.] [Someone lost a hammer. A craftsman considers his equipment as precious as his own life. Then who could have lost this?]

"Equipment has durability too?"

[Yes.]

"I didn't know."

Taesan, who broke through the labyrinth, didn't know this fact at first. The equipment he obtained here boasted durability that remained unchanged, at least for one durability.

[But it doesn't mean much. Weapons and armor are things that often change, and their overall durability is incredibly tough, so they usually change before they're broken.]
"Of course, as expected."

Nevertheless, he discovered information about durability that he hadn't known even in his previous life. Based on Taesan's experience, even seemingly useless information always found its way to be useful eventually.

Taesan also checked the secret reward.

[Ring Embedded with Many Gems] [Attack +8] [A ring that, aside from being decorative, can't be used for much else. It seems quite painful to strike with the overly embedded gems.]

Originally, it would have been close to worthless. Since attack power applies only to the attacking part, the attack power of a ring often holds little significance. Perhaps the secret reward was meant to be sold at a shop to earn capital.

However, for Taesan, equipped with Elric's swordsmanship, it was difficult to find better equipment than this. Removing the Attack 1 ring he was wearing, it was equivalent to a weapon with Attack 7.

After completing the clear, Taesan returned to Harfran.

"You're just in time. We've just finished."

Harfran handed him ankle guards made of leather.
[Ankle Guards Made from Ogre Leather] [Defense +13] [Crafted by a master's hand. Still new, so it has a slight smell.]

"Wow."

Quite high.

It's impressive to reach 13 using only ogre leather without any special materials. And it was made in just thirty minutes. It was thoroughly satisfying.

"From now on, I'll charge for these. Understand that the price will vary depending on the item's value. First, I'll keep the materials."

"As you wish."

Even if Taesan held onto the materials, it wouldn't matter. It just cluttered his inventory unnecessarily, so it was convenient for both of them if Harfran held onto them until Taesan came looking to craft. The immediate crafting was finished. Harfran confirmed what level of equipment he could make.

"See you later."

After going down to some extent, he thought about coming back with better materials and money. The dwarf nodded. As he left, a ghost caught him.

"You can make something better than this, right?"

* * *

Harfran calmly said.

"I can make it. But we don't have enough money or materials."

Even if Taesan had the best materials, it would still be ogre leather. To make anything better, they would first need more materials.
[Not that. Don't you know what I'm trying to say?]

"......"

Harfran frowned. The ghost spoke again.

[Things that only you, not others, can create. Equipment with special powers. Items made from materials found in a place only the chosen can enter.]

"......Hero."

[I assure you. With him, it's possible.]

"Hmm."

Harfran stroked his chin. Then he spoke.

"You know the value that place holds, right? You know what that place means to me."

[Better than anyone else. You told me yourself.]

"And yet you speak of it so lightly knowing that?"

Harfran's gaze sank deep.

The hero responded confidently.

[Possible. That's what I'm saying.]

"......"

Harfran remained silent. Taesan, leaving him lost in thought, asked.

"What are you talking about?"

A place of permission. Equipment with special powers. From what he remembered, Lee Tae-yeon hadn't said anything like that.

It was one of two things. Either he had forgotten, or she hadn't been allowed to say it.
[Do you remember why I came here?]

"You said the world had ended. That you came to revive it."

[Similar to me. The difference is, Harfran can return to his own world.]

After a long pause, Harfran spoke.

"I told you that myself. I didn't mention it to anyone else. They didn't possess enough value."

Harfran looked into the hero's eyes with solemnity.

"And you didn't make it to the end either."

[I did. But he can.]

It was a statement filled with certainty.

[Especially he can, for sure.]

Harfran frowned.

"......I know he's strong, but he's still a rookie who hasn't even reached the 20th floor yet. It's impressive to surpass the 20th floor with the body of the 13th floor, but whether he's worthy of revealing my secret..."

[30th floor.]

"What?"

[He defeated an adventurer from the 30th floor.]

Harfran's pupils dilated. For the first time, astonishment crossed his face.

"......Are you lying?"
[Have I ever lied to you?]

"But..."

Distrust did not fade from Harfran's eyes.

It was indeed remarkable to defeat the 20th floor with the strength of the 13th, but not entirely impossible. Harfran had been here for a long time, occasionally witnessing those who overwhelmed their stats with talent and skill.

However, such occurrences were rare. Only those with exceptional talent could occasionally prevail against opponents who delved deeper, and even then, there were clear limits. No one had ever defeated an opponent with a difference of more than 10 floors.

Yet to overcome someone from the 30th floor...

After a long moment of deliberation, Harfran spoke up.

"I need verification."

[Verification of what?]

"That he defeated someone from the 30th floor."

Harfran said with a subdued expression.

* * *

Ghost unexpectedly apologized to Taesan, who had suddenly been put to the test.

"Did I rush things too much? Sorry. But it seemed difficult to find the right timing if not now."

"That's okay."
If he gains profit, Taesan could accept a proportional trial. There was one thing Taesan was curious about.

"Is what you're saying worth it?"

"It's overflowing."

Ghost spoke with confidence.

"If you gain Harfran's recognition, you could become stronger in various ways."

"In that case, it's settled."

To grow stronger externally in the labyrinth meant more than just physical strength—it was advantageous in other ways. It meant discovering entirely different paths. Perhaps he could even acquire new skills.

"And you want to reach them."

Taesan hesitated at Ghost's softly murmured voice.

"Have you noticed?"

"It's hard not to."

Shortly after meeting Maria, Taesan showed not awe nor fear, but rather a readiness for struggle. Ghost, with considerable experience, could read that much.

"Well, I do wonder if you're aiming too high... But if that's what you want, it could be quite a valuable experience."

As Harfran appeared holding a scroll, seemingly prepared.

"The summoning scroll?"

At Taesan's words, Harfran's eyebrows twitched.
"Do you know? It's almost a forgotten item now."

"Because of the connection."

Taesan had used it in the past too.

A summoning scroll. It was a scroll that summoned sealed monsters. Depending on the grade of the sealed monster, its value could skyrocket.

"There's a Balrog sealed here."

"What?"

Ghost gasped. Even in the Alon mode, it was a demonic creature that barely emerged from the depths. It rivaled dragons in existence. Harfran shook his head.

"It's been heated and heated again, a creature that hasn't even held a speck of dust, so there's no need to worry."

"Wow, surprised you."

"But it's still not weak. At least it'll be a boss-level monster in the late 20th floor. Will you really accept it?"

Taesan nodded.

Harfran tore the scroll with a suspicious look.

"Kuuuuuaah!"

A cry echoed through the labyrinth. A black monster with horns and wings appeared.

"The sealed Balrog has appeared."

Suddenly freed into the world, the Balrog looked around in confusion. Taesan, meeting its gaze, drew his sword.
Here is the translation of the provided Korean text into English:

"For countless hours trapped, intellect and spirit plummeted endlessly, but instinct remained undiminished.

The human before him antagonizes him.

Antagonizers are killed.

With a roar, the Balrog rushed at Taesan.

* * *

The ghost briefly left Taesan and approached Harfran.

"Do you still doubt?"

"...."

At the ghost's words, Harfran was speechless.

Though sealed, the Balrog is formidable. Judging by its imposing presence and special skills even when weakened, it could be considered on par with a level 30 foe, not just the late 20s.

"Kuuuh!"

The Balrog screamed in agony.

Facing such a presence, Taesan was overwhelming." 

It seems there was some corruption in the text towards the end.
