Episode 81

81. 14th Floor, Guide of Sin (4)

It was strange. A flame that ignites flames. With that intensity, Taesan should have melted away just from residual heat.

But he only suffered burns. Upon contact, there was a sensation akin to touching a substance.

So, he thought it was a substance, and he was correct.

Taesan raised his sword, and Jagan looked at Taesan in disbelief.

He had just realized through those two spells. Taesan had perfectly discerned a countermeasure against magic.

"It can't be!"

Demon magic is exactly thatâ€”their own magic. It's a perfect power accumulated over countless ages.

"And you think you can!"

[Jagan invoked Decarabia's twisted lifeforms.]

Darkness erupted violently. The manifestation of this magic was perfectly identical to what had been manifested before.

Jagan, having descended to the 30th floor in this place, wasn't foolish enough to change the manifestation of the magic just because there had been feelings of denial and contempt, as doing so would have wounded his pride.

That was very favorable for Taesan.
[Kang Taesan activated mental acceleration.]

Time subtly slowed down. A very slight difference. But it provided enough time to think.

Black magic. Intuitive and obscure magic never seen in his previous life.

"Only emerges from the darkness."

Magic manifested only in the swirling darkness around Jagan.

Twisted lifeforms, countless tree roots rushing. Quietly looking into the darkness, signs appear. The tips of the roots protrude sharply.

By seeing that, one can read the trajectory.

Taesan moves his steps. Three to the left. Two steps forward.

Magic manifests, roots thrashing around the room.

Yet Taesan suffers no harm. It surrounds only Taesan as if avoiding harm.

Jagan opens his mouth, and Taesan raises his finger.

Scorching.

The roots burn and disappear, leaving the room empty. Taesan accelerates. Passing through the flames, he stabs his sword into Jagan's chest, who stands dazed.

Thunk.

"This, this!"
Jagan hastily tried to create distance, but Taesan closed the gap. When facing a wizard, maintaining proximity is crucial. He grabbed Jagan's arm, pulled him closer, and swiftly moved his sword again.

"As expected."

The specter watching couldn't help but admire.

Insight. Understanding the essence of objects or phenomena, deducing the most rational methods and solutions. And reaching conclusions.

It was the most important ability anyone delving into a labyrinth should possess, and Taesan excelled at it more than anyone else.

In the midst of battle, he even promptly identified the activation and evasion methods of unfamiliar dark magic. Not only did he succeed where others had failed, but he didn't even consider evasion tactics in his haste to avoid danger.

Yes. Not even the specter could.

"Indeed, this was his greatest strength."

He realized the separation between static and trajectory states in magic, learning basic spells like Ignition and Frost Arrow, which he wouldn't have known otherwise.

He understood the compatibility of skills like Impact, Diversion, and Counter.

And his swordsmanship. Assessing roughness in Storm Wounds' swordsmanship, he moved to eliminate it. In doing so, he acquired the Dance of the Second Sword.
Even if it's the first time seeing it, he grasps its essence, deduces, and tries to move accordingly. It's an ability everyone has, but Taesan stands out.

"Talent... isn't it."

The light of talent that is not simply violent did not appear.

Thousands, tens of thousands of efforts. Countless efforts that could be seen as arrogance and madness.

It must have originated from there.

While the specter inwardly admired, the fight continued, and it was one-sided.

Taesan couldn't do anything and was pushed back because he didn't know anything about dark magic. But now he had figured out to some extent its activation methods and countermeasures.

From there, it was simple. Just block the magic and show determination.

"Ah, Aik!"

Jagan tried desperately to manifest magic somehow, but it didn't work. It was blocked by magic, blocked by skills, blocked by swordsmanship, blocked in every way. In the meantime, he had already received over a thousand damage.

"Hmph!"

Eventually, Jagan gave up. He spat out with a rough face.

"I admit it. But not from here!"

Jagan gathers magic. The magic quivers and begins to envelop Jagan's body.

[Jagan has activated Advent.]
Here is the translation of the text from Korean to English:

"A skill unique to demons that converts magic and mana into stats. With a high conversion rate, once activated, it completes stats that can overwhelm even Taesan.

Naturally, Taesan couldn't just stand by.

He stepped on Jagan's foot and punched his chin. Due to the loss of concentration, the activation of the descent is canceled.

"Ah, how..."

"Why are you stupidly activating it so openly?"

Taesan sent a contemptuous look.

Dark magic can be canceled at any time due to external stimuli during implementation. Taesan, who had blocked countless spells from Jagan until now, couldn't just stand idly by.

Realizing this fact belatedly, Jagan tries to distance himself. However, there is a clear difference in physical ability between them.

While their stats are not vastly different, it goes without saying which side has the advantage between Jagan, who is a mage, and Taesan, who is closer to a swordsman.

*Squelch.*

*Cough.*

Finally, the sword pierces through Jagan, leaving him dead. Taesan thrusts a dagger into the fallen Jagan.

"If you act foolishly, I'll kill you. So behave."

"To think I... would be treated like this by a human like you..."

Jagan looks up with a pathetic expression. The specter let out a suppressed admiration.

[Impressive. Even though he's an amateur, I didn't expect to win this easily.]
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Even though it's complex, it's less than ten spells. It would have been difficult for Taesan too if he had skills that could alter spells, but since he didn't, it was simple."

For example, magic acceleration. Magic explosion.

If there were skills that could change activation and implementation like that, Taesan would have struggled. However, perhaps due to lack of skill, only raw, unrefined magic was activated.

"Oh, really?"

The specter chuckled.

Typically, wizards on floors 30 or 40 use no more than ten spells. And most of those spells cannot be altered.

It's not that they are weak. Magic is a form of strategy. Up to the 30th floor, ten moves are sufficient.

But to Taesan, they probably look immature. Essentially, unless one delves deep, it meant that a wizard of equal or similar level to Taesan couldn't defeat him.

"I wonder about the mastery of insight."

Simply put, Taesan learned the ultimate evolution of insight, Complete Scouting, but the specter did not. The difference was significant.

"If he hadn't done something stupid, it wouldn't have been this easy."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Jagan is a pure wizard who does not use his body. He had to manifest numerous spells to prevent the approach, but due to his negligence, he did not. The moment he gave him distance, the outcome was more or less predetermined.

"Well then."

Taesan thrusts the tip of his sword into Jagan's throat. Blood gushes out.

"How can I learn dark magic?"

* * *

Dark magic. A form of magic entirely different from regular magic.

The dark magic Jagan showed was extremely intricate and at the same time, fascinating. Even though he didn't know much about magic, to achieve such range and diversity, he would have to learn quite a lot of spells.

If he were to learn, it would become a useful card.

Jagan responded to Taesan's question with curses. He dared to seek out demon magic on a human subject. He cursed Taesan with all sorts of insults, saying he should have the curse of the demon king.

Taesan's response to him was simple. If you don't answer, I'll just offer your soul as a sacrifice to the gods.

The statement was incredibly effective, causing Jagan to quietly shut his mouth. With a terrified face, he began to answer Taesan's questions.

He tried to mix lies in between, but the ghost cut him off beforehand. Since he had delved deep, he had a rough idea of dark magic and was comfortable discussing it.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Finally, the story was sorted out.

"So, can I learn it in the end?"

"Yeah."

Jagan nodded wearily.

"Dark magic operates with magic and mana. Mana is fulfilled, so you just need the magic."

"Magic is something only your kind possesses?"

It was a kind of energy that demons naturally acquired from birth. According to the ghost, other races couldn't obtain it no matter how hard they tried.

"Typically, yes. But this place is a labyrinth. It's where forces that distort all sorts of strangeness and laws are categorized as skills. If the conditions are met... obtaining magic isn't something that cannot be done."

Indeed, I've seen a few who have achieved it. Jagan added.

"That's how you go to find your god."

"...Just like the god of magic, our god has also taken a place here. He's abandoned all of us, too."

Jagan said with a twisted face. His expression contained both reverence and betrayal.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"He loves those with abilities. If you win his heart and pass his trials... you might receive privileges granted only to us. It's an endlessly improbable feat, but still."

Jagan smirked. The demon god had never allowed humans access to magic even once. It was as futile as trying to move a mountain, in his opinion.

"That's not for you to judge."

He had to find the demon god. That was the goal. Taesan asked the ghost.

"Do you know the location?"

"My memory's hazy... but it shouldn't be too far. Just a bit further down."

Learning seemed faster than expected. But now he had one lingering question.

"What's the relationship like between the followers of the god of magic and the demon god?"

He was learning magic from the god of magic. It was possible only because the god of magic showed him favor.

If their relationship wasn't good, he might have to choose one over the other. The ghost hesitated.

"Um... I'm not sure. Transcendents often have strained relationships. I should check directly."

Taesan sighed in relief that there wasn't a definitive negative answer, and organized his thoughts.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"With this, Taesan had obtained all the information he needed from Jagan. He immediately drove the sword into him. Jagan's energy disappeared along with a desolate expression.

The power he had built up transferred to Taesan.

[Your Gift has been triggered. Strength permanently increases by 26. Agility permanently increases by 27. Intelligence permanently increases by 34. Stamina permanently increases by 50. Mana permanently increases by 70.] [Your Gift has been triggered. Obtained novice dark magic [Marcorias's Fake Flame].] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.]

Despite the Gift not triggering properly due to level increase, as an adventurer of the 30th floor, it was a significant boost.

He didn't obtain any equipment, but it was acceptable. It was unethical to covet equipment on the 30th floor.

[Novice Dark Magic: Marcorias's Fake Flame] [Mana Cost: 13] [Basic Magical Consumption: 5] [Proficiency: 1%] [Demon. Summons a substance resembling the flames controlled by Marcorias. Its temperature is so intense it could melt the sun and freeze ice.]

"It certainly was material."
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"A section about magical consumption was added. It won't be usable until acquiring magic.

So.

Taesan spoke up.

"Don't hide and come out."

But there was no movement from the hiding figures. Taesan lazily scratched his hand.

"Should I pull each one out and kill them? Try to run if you can."

"...I'm sorry."

With a quiet voice, figures of people appeared. One. Two. Altogether twelve.

They were adventurers of the 2nd tier.

* * *

The youth gritted his teeth and bowed his head. Others also trembled, their heads bowed.

"Seems like I'm the one bothering you."

"Really similar, isn't it?"

"What's similar about it? I took the first hit."

Taesan muttered.

"Even if I were to kill them all, they wouldn't have anything to say."

At his words, they trembled even more. The youth bit his lip.

"No... It can't be done. The adventurer on the 13th floor is a monster. A presence that cannot be resisted."
Here's the translation of the text into English:

The adventurer on the 30th floor has died. Although Jagan had not focused on tormenting them for long and managed his power, it was still the 30th floor. On the 20th floor, even over ten could not touch the power of existence.

That's what the one on the 13th floor killed.

And it wasn't particularly difficult; it was overwhelming.

Don't rebel. The youth barely collected his thoughts and asked,

"What do you want from us?"
