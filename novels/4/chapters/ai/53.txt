54. Earth. Return (2)

Taesan looked at Junggeun's face.

A rather ordinary face.

Utterly forgettable if seen on the street, fading from memory within five seconds.

Yet, there was something about his pleasant smile that inexplicably drew Taesan's favor.

Seeing Taesan staring at him blankly, Junggeun scratched his head with a bewildered look.

"Um... uh..."

Junggeun was flustered. He was seeing the man in front of him for the first time, yet he was being stared at as if he were being recognized from somewhere before.

Junggeun cleared his throat awkwardly. Gathering his thoughts, he recalled the reason he had come here.

"The City Hall Quest. You accepted it, right?"

Taesan nodded.

"Would you like to follow me? It'll be quite difficult for you to go to City Hall alone."

Taesan nodded again. Junggeun grinned.

"Great. Then follow me. Oh, you're not coming with anyone else?"

The ghost was still beside Taesan. But Junggeun didn't seem to notice.

Taesan replied shortly.

"No, I'm alone."

"Alright. Stick with me then."
Junggeun lowered his posture and spread out his hands.

[Junggeun activated Stealth Decrease. Junggeun and Kang Taesan's presence decreased.]

Stealth Decrease. As the name suggests, it's a skill that reduces one's presence. It's a skill that could be somewhat useful, allowing one to hide from enemies' sight for up to an hour.

In an instant, Taesan and Junggeun's presence diminished. Junggeun momentarily frowned.

"Taesan? ...Ah, really?"

Coming to a conclusion on his own, he spoke in a low voice.

"Follow me slowly. Keep your noise to a minimum."

Taesan nodded quietly.

Carefully surveying the surroundings, Junggeun moved forward, with Taesan quietly following behind. The ghost spoke up.

[Looks like I can't see anyone but you. If you're an adventurer, you should be able to recognize me. Why is that?]

The ghost, seemingly amused, touched its chin.

[Did you come to see him?]

Taesan silently nodded.

He hadn't formed strong bonds with others. Part of it was due to his nature finding relationships troublesome, but it was also because they held little meaning to him.
Today, someone I knew is gone forever tomorrow. It was something that happened all too often.

Moreover, he was a player in Easy Modeâ€”the easiest difficulty level of a human. Everyone he grew attached to or formed good relationships with ended up dying. From a certain point on, he didn't give his heart to anyone unless they were likely to survive until the end.

One of them was Junggeun.

A human who conversed with him in his final moments.

Even amidst despair, he never lost his sense of humor.

The ghost muttered in a puzzled tone.

"Hmm. Doesn't seem like you're just here to say hello. Seems like you've got something to do with him."

Taesan didn't respond. The ghost continued on its own.

"Well, he's somewhat useful, I guess. If luck's really on your side, you might even reach the depths."

It was reluctantly admitting.

After following Junggeun for about thirty minutes, murmuring sounds were heard. Numerous presences were felt inside a small building.

"Are you all okay?"

"Yeah."

"Mr. Junggeun!"

Countless people rushed over with delighted faces.

Hundreds of people.
Among them, there wasn't a single face I recognized.

* * *

"The person I've rescued this time is Kang Taesan. He appears to be in Normal Mode, so please get along well with each other."

"Um, I don't think I've seen him before..."

Someone who seems to be in Normal Mode murmurs quietly. The people around him snicker at his words.

"How do you know so many people in Normal Mode?"

"Well, I guess that's true."

The man who was pointed out scratches his head with a slightly embarrassed look.

"Nice to meet you. Take care."

Taesan nods silently.

"Well then, let's start moving."

Junggeun claps his hands to lighten the mood.

"I think we've gathered everyone nearby. Let's head to the City Hall now."

The expressions of the people stiffen. Anxiety is evident on their faces.

"It's okay, everyone."

Junggeun reassures them with a confident smile.

"I'll protect all of you."

They start moving towards City Hall, hesitantly at first.

About a hundred people slowly move forward. They advance cautiously towards the rear to avoid the monsters as much as possible.
"What are these things?"

The ghost mutters with a gloomy tone.

"Are these weaklings all we have? Are these the ones who entered the labyrinth?"

Except for Junggeun, everyone else seemed feeble and fragile. At a glance, there were even those who didn't seem much different from ordinary humans, unable to surpass human limits.

"I roughly understand now. Junggeun must be leading us to the destination. You're one of them now."

"Yeah, that's right."

Taesan replied quietly.

F-rank monsters are weak. However, ordinary humans have the strength to tear them apart easily. At this point, only Hard Players or higher can compete. And among them, only the top players.

Junggeun was leading these weaklings towards City Hall.

"Quite literally."

Junggeun had led them to City Hall even in the previous world. Taesan remembered vividly what had come of that.

As they were moving forward, a girl who had been sending curious glances his way approached him.
"Did you come from Normal Mode?"

A girl with impressive freckles and brown hair, looking freshly adult. She chattered next to Taesan.

"I'm An Junghee. And you?"

"Oppa. It feels strange hearing that after decades," he replied with a wry smile.

"Kang Taesan."

An Junghee grinned.

"I thought I was quite well-informed, but 'Taesan' is a new one for me..."

"How do you know everyone from Normal Mode when there are nearly tens of millions just in Korea?"

In a country where nearly tens of millions were in Normal Mode, preventing overcrowding there meant splitting the space, much like game servers, into dimensions. Knowing everyone was impossible.

"If dimensions weren't split, entering the maze in Easy Mode would have been impossible."

"Still, I know everyone who's considered strong. For example, that guy."

She pointed to a muscular man with tattoos on his fingertips.

"He's a senior in the Athens Guild, quite strong. He's a bit of a dirty character, but with Junggeun Oppa around, he behaves."


Players gathered to form guilds. There were Easy, Normal, and Hard modes.

The Athens Guild wasn't the only one existing. As people gathered, societies formed, often resulting in groups, sometimes named guilds, other times revolutionaries.

Of course, Taesan didn't belong anywhere. Instead of playing such trivial pranks, understanding the maze was more important.

The girl seemed to need someone to talk to, as she kept talking. Eventually, the conversation turned to why Junggeun started hanging out with them.

"He was watching a performance."

It was an amateur, small-scale performance by a fairly popular band, so many people gathered. Naturally, a lot of people appeared when they returned.

"When everyone was confused about what to do, Junggeun stepped in."

He calmed down the confused people and suggested they go watch a play together. Some people resisted, asking who he was to order them around, but when he said he was a player in Hard Mode and showed the strength to bend steel with his bare hands, they shut up.
This group was formed that way. Taesan's story from the past wasn't much different from Junggeun's.

As Junggeun moved forward, he raised his hand. An Junghee shut her mouth.

"[Monster 5699425871 has appeared.]"

Grrrk.

A black monster with massive arms and legs appears. Faces of the people show fear. Junggeun, with a determined face, grips his sword.

"Wait here for a moment."

Junggeun slowly approaches the monster. The monster, still unaware of his presence, wanders around.

Junggeun stabs its back.

"[Dealt 6 damage to Monster 5699425871.]"

Grrrr!

The monster roars, swinging its massive arms to attack Junggeun.

Clang!

"Ugh!"

Driven by strength, Junggeun grits his teeth. He's a player who can defeat even Grade A opponents in the future, but for now, he's still in the stage of adapting. He had to fight quite a tough battle against a Grade F monster.

He dodges the swinging arms and strikes.

After a fierce battle, Junggeun emerges victorious.

He catches his breath and speaks to the people.

"I got it. Come this way."

"Wow...!"

"Junggeun!"


People cheered with moved voices. They rushed to Junggeun and praised his strength.

Junggeun smiled and waved his hand, trying hard.

"For now, let's keep moving."

People were as cautious as possible, holding their breath and keeping low profiles. However, with over a hundred people moving, it was inevitable that they would catch the monster's attention.

As they fought against the Grade F monster that appeared, another monster suddenly appeared.

Grrrr!

"Ahh!"

"Sir Junggeun!"

Junggeun couldn't respond either. As it became clear he couldn't help them, over a hundred people screamed and scattered in panic.

The Grade F monster wasn't that strong. If they all gathered their strength and fought together, they could easily win, but instead, they were busy fleeing in a panic.

[......]

The ghost watched them with great displeasure. Taesan picked up a fallen rock from the ground.

"Ahh!"

An Junghee screamed and ran away. It was the moment the monster was about to strike her head.

Thunk.
The monster that hit its head on a small stone flew far away. It rolled on the ground, hiding its appearance amidst the loud noise. People who were fleeing in panic suddenly widen their eyes at the disappeared monster.

"Oh, uh?"

"What's going on?"

People stutter. Junggeun, who barely defeated the Grade F monster, rushes over panting.

"Where did the monster go?"

"We don't know either. It suddenly disappeared."

"What?"

Confusion crosses Junggeun's face. He scans the surroundings but can't see the monster anywhere.

"Who defeated it?"

"There was no damage indication. There's no one capable of defeating it..."

Even in Hard Mode, the monster that Junggeun barely managed to catch is difficult. The only ones here are weaklings who would struggle even in Normal Mode.

Junggeun glances briefly at Taesan.

Taesan stood expressionless. He seemed unaffected by the current chaos and fear, almost appearing relieved.

"No way?"

He raises his head in suspicion.

Taesan had claimed to have encountered the monster, but Junggeun thought he had hidden and avoided it. In Hard Mode, those at the top tier like him could guarantee victory in a 1:1 battle. And such individuals were not likely unknown to Junggeun.
"Um... Let's keep moving for now."

Unable to solve the mystery, Junggeun eventually heads towards the City Hall.

The path was repetitive. When a monster appeared, Junggeun would confront it. The rest would just watch from a distance. Occasionally, Taesan would throw rocks to drive them away when things got precarious.

After repeating this several times, the ghosts couldn't bear it any longer.

---

"These scavengers!"

A loud voice echoes. Only Taesan can be heard amid the thunderous roar.

"How can there be such useless creatures! They don't even have the will to do anything themselves, let alone fight for their lives! They're just scavengers relying on others!"

Anger-filled voices.

It was also a new experience for Taesan to hear such emotions for the first time. If people could hear the ghosts' voices, they would have stiffened in response.

"They dare to enter the Labyrinth? Ridiculous."

A voice resonates like a beast.

"This is an insult to us. We cannot tolerate such creatures attempting to challenge the Labyrinth."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

To the ghosts who had risked their lives to break through, those who gave up on fighting themselves looked particularly disgusting. Taesan quietly waited until the ghosts calmed down.

"[...I can't understand them.]"

The ghost muttered with a more annoyed tone than before.

"Strength isn't the issue. There's no one strong from the start. Everyone becomes strong by risking their lives and fighting."

It was true as the ghost said. Taesan himself wasn't strong from the beginning. After risking his life against Big Rat and challenging Ha-ge-Ha, he had come this far.

"But these guys lack will. They don't try to do anything on their own, nor do they seek information or knowledge. They're just eager to run away. Are these weaklings who have survived so far?"

"Don't be like that. If you look closely, I'm the weird one."

They were from an ordinary world. The fight for their lives was the story of a creation. Those who quickly grasped the situation and moved forward were extremely rare.

Moreover, as long as Junggeun was there to protect them, it was natural for them to use their strength to flee rather than to fight.

"It's not a world merciful enough to save such people."

Taesan looked at Junggeun. He was comforting the troubled people.
"Yes, yes. It's okay. Just hang in there a little longer."

Kim Junggeun.

One of the few players Taesan had a close relationship with.

He was comforting people.

In the previous world, Junggeun led a hundred people to City Hall on their first return.

And the only one who arrived was Junggeun.
