**Chapter 510**

510. 94th Floor, Easy Mode (3)

[Multiplier?]

Bardray thought about the meaning of the word "multiplier". Although he didn't know its exact dictionary definition, he understood what it implied.

[Adding is... doubling.]

It increases the attack power by two times. That's the effect of adding.

Then, what about multiplying?

[Wait a minute.]

One possibility flashed through his mind. Bardray's hair stood on end.

[...Is what I'm thinking correct?]

"I don't know what you're imagining, but it's probably right."

[Wow.]

Bardray couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.

[That's... a really cool phrase. If we multiply, how much will it multiply by?]

"Square."

[So if we square, we're multiplying the current attack power?]

"That's right."

[Ha.]

Bardray finally burst out laughing.

[What nonsense is this?]

Bardray had seen numerous skills next to Taesan, including Add, Absolute Judgment, Attack Nullification, Forced Duel, and so on.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even if you only have one, skills that can change the outcome of a battle, irregular skills. Every time Taesan acquired one, Bardray couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.

But now, the multiplication that Taesan mentioned was clearly a skill that surpassed them.

Increasing attack power exponentially? In reality, it means that the opponent's defense and HP become meaningless. If you can just hit them, you can take them down with a single blow, no matter who they are.

[Wait, so if my attack power is around 30,000, and I multiply it...].

"It's not just basic attack power. You can also multiply attack power that's been increased by skills or equipment effects."

In simple terms, it means you can add to your attack power and then multiply it by two, making it even stronger.

Bardray was speechless.

[Just a moment.]

If you add to 30,000, you get 60,000. If you use the Passionate Blade, you get 180,000. And then there are all the other miscellaneous skills.

If you multiply all of those...

[The calculation is impossible.]

Bardray gave up trying to calculate the damage. The numbers were meaningless.

[What's this 'Skill Initialization' thing?]

"A skill that initializes skills."

[Oh, initialization. I can kind of understand that.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan had several equipment that could reset skills. It was as if the skills themselves were being reset. Bardley thought that was the case, but Taesan shook his head.

"The concept of skill reset is a bit different."

[Is that so?]

"You can reset skills that are already in effect."

The typical cooldown reset effect allows you to use the skill again after its effect has ended.

For example, it was impossible to use the "Dedication Blade" skill twice in one attack by activating it and then immediately resetting it.

However, the skill reset feature made it possible. You could use the "Multiplication" skill again in the same attack after activating it.

[That's... doesn't make sense.]

Bardley couldn't even laugh at the absurdity.

So, did that mean you could use the "Multiplication" skill twice in one attack?

But there was one question.

[Isn't this ultimately a discarded timeline? Can you bring skills you've obtained with you?]

"I've already discussed that part with the wizard."

The wizard said that as long as you had the proper qualifications, you could bring skills you've obtained yourself.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It meant that the skills obtained by directly fulfilling the conditions would remain even if they returned to their original time.

[You've calculated everything.]

Bardley let out a dry laugh. At the same time, one thought flashed through his mind.

[Then, the skill I asked Barbalamb to grant me...].

"This is because of this."

Multiplication was a simple skill that multiplied damage. No matter how high the damage was, if it didn't hit the opponent, it had no effect.

But the skill obtained from Barbalamb could change its effect itself.

I was extremely curious about what kind of result would come out.

And to do that, I had to acquire the skill first.

Quaddup!

Taesan pushed aside the monster blocking the path and continued down. He had already entered the latter half of the 90th floor.

[...I understand everything. What you want and what your purpose is.]

But there was still one unanswered question.

[Why did you come to this place? The acquisition conditions are difficult, but in the original world, you couldn't fulfill them, right?]

"There's a problem. I've become too strong.""
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The acquisition of skills is proportional to the adventurer's abilities. That's why Taesan was able to easily obtain the skills of endurance and forced duel when he was in a state of nothingness, but if he were to try to obtain them again now, it would be several times more difficult.

Currently, his most basic attack power is 30,000.

With that number, there was no way to obtain the multiplication skill.

"I even thought about a method to seal my own power, but it seems like it wouldn't be resolved with that, and ultimately, I couldn't obtain skills through normal means."

That's why Taesan hadn't acquired any skills recently.

Taesan stabbed a monster that was approaching him with his sword.

"And even if that's not the case, it's likely that the conditions can't be met."

[You know the conditions are difficult, but... can they be met here?]

The effects of skills are proportional to the conditions for acquiring them. The more powerful the skill, the harder it is to acquire.

If it's at the multiplication level, it's practically an impossible condition.

Is it possible to acquire such a skill in easy mode? That was Bardley's question.

"It's not impossible," Taesan replied.

"But it's not possible either."

[What do you mean exactly?]

"Honestly, I'm not sure myself."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I didn't have the confidence to acquire the designated skill. It was the same with many other skills. Most of them relied more on luck than ability.

To be honest, it took an enormous amount of time. I couldn't know if I had enough leisure time.

"But it's possible to multiply. That's not a skill you can acquire normally."

[Is that not normal?]

Taesan didn't respond and went down the stairs instead.

The door opened, and a strong wind greeted Taesan.

Whoosh!

The strong wind roughly shook Taesan's hair.

Taesan was now standing on a steep cliff.

"I'm here."

This was the 98th floor.

This was the floor where Taesan acquired the multiplication skill.

* * *

[Is this a cliff?]

Taesan stood at the edge of the cliff. The ground below was visible.

The clear condition for the 98th floor was simple.

All you had to do was jump down from the cliff to the bottom. It was a simple but difficult condition.

"I've had a hard time."

The cliff was extremely high. If you jumped normally, it would take over 10 minutes to reach the ground. Even players in easy mode had reached the realm of the gods, but at this height, life was at risk."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was a way to slowly climb down the cliff by holding onto the wall, but it was impossible due to the monsters' interference.

After deliberating, they decided to push forward with a large number of people. They gathered a massive amount of people to fill the space, tied a rope, and jumped down all at once. As they slowly descended, they were able to clear the monsters.

The peculiarity of having to fall was a first for the easy mode. It was also the level where Taesan learned to jump and land.

Taesan opened his skill window.

[Add] [Big Jump] [Super Acceleration] [Landing] [Absolute Judgment] [Copy] [Forced Duel] [First Attack Nullification]

...

...

Many of his skills were displayed.

However, a few skills, including multiplication and skill reset, were missing.

"Then let's go."

Taesan stepped into the air. His body, affected by gravity, began to fall towards the ground.

As he looked down, he saw dozens of small dots.

And the dots began to grow larger.

[Kagak!]

The beast's roar. And the feeling of hostility and killing intent.

Taesan grasped his sword.

Kwajik!

[Kiek!] [66 damage to Spore.]"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A monster that looked like a bat was slashed by a sword and disappeared.

They were Spores. They were monsters that blocked the path of descending adventurers.

[Kagaga!] [Kieeek!]

Dozens of Spores rushed towards Taesan at once. Taesan swung his sword.

Quadduk.

He pierced the Spores' heads and dodged their attacks, making them collide with each other.

He kicked and twisted his wrists, using the falling speed to trample them.

Originally, they would have been quite troublesome, but for Taesan, who had many experiences, it was not a big deal. He cleared all the Spores in an instant.

Hwaaah!

But it didn't end there.

More Spores flew in from the ground.

Taesan, without any emotional change, cleared the Spores again.

Quadduk!

It was a floor he had already cleared once, and a floor he had repeated hundreds of thousands of times. There was no problem with clearing it.

After more than ten minutes of falling, the ground finally reached Taesan's nose. Taesan adjusted his posture.

[You have landed.]

Thud.

Taesan stepped onto the ground.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The thing that welcomed me on the ground was dozens of cannons.

The cannons were embedded in the 98th floor of the ground, firing spoilers at the adventurers coming down from above.

Once I landed on the ground, the cannons stopped working. They only interfered when I was descending.

"Is this the feeling?"

It wasn't bad.

But it was still far from enough.

My weakened body couldn't keep up with my spirit, and I couldn't get the multiplication I needed. I had to handle the spoilers more cleanly and perfectly.

So, I first adjusted my body and spirit.

[You activated a great leap.]

My body soared into the sky. In an instant, the cliff passed by at an incredible speed. The mountain peak stepped on the cliff wall once more.

[You activated a great leap.]

Whoa.

The mountain peak reached the top of the cliff.

It was literally an instant. The cannons didn't even have time to fire another spoiler.

[Wow.]

Bardley let out a sigh of amazement. At a height where it would take over 10 minutes to fall and barely reach the ground, I arrived in just two leaps.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Is this the extent of the Great Leap skill?]"

"It was one of my main skills, after all."

The greatness of the other skills was overshadowed, but the Great Leap was also an incredible skill. It was impossible to fly in the sky with the weak stats of Taesan, but...

"Then..."

Taesan took another step forward, into the air.

His body began to fall towards the ground.

"[Kaahhak!] [Kieeek!]"

With a loud crash, the spoilers rushed towards Taesan. Taesan grasped his sword.

"Kwaduk."

He swung his sword, splitting his opponent's head in two, and then bisected their body. His movements were much more refined than before, to the point where he seemed like a completely different person. Bardray was amazed.

The power to tear through the sky and destroy planets, which was once at an extraordinary level, had been reduced to a normal superhuman level. The disconnection between his body and mind would take a long time to recover from, like an old man undergoing rehabilitation.

But Taesan was perfect.

At this point, Taesan was not an easy opponent for the spoilers, and he handled them flawlessly, without a single injury, and landed back on the ground. From Bardray's perspective, there was no longer any room for improvement.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Despite achieving a nearly perfect result, Taesan had a dissatisfied face.

"It's still lacking."

[You have taken a big leap.]

He climbs up again.

And falls again.

The movement of handling the spores was a bit better than before, but still not satisfactory.

And Taesan climbed up again.

Slowly but surely, he raised his proficiency. Bardley couldn't help but be curious about his appearance.

[How can you get this kind of result with such conditions?]

It was very ordinary.

The condition of descending from a high place to the ground was hard to find in Alone Mode, but it wasn't impossible. Taesan had even cleared a similar quest with similar conditions before.

It didn't seem like the acquisition condition for the Multiply skill.

Taesan replied.

"It won't work with these conditions. But you can get it here."

[I don't understand what you mean.]

"It's simple."

Taesan took a big leap again and stood on the cliff, looking down at the ground and opening his mouth.

"There are quite a few bugs in Easy Mode, you know."
