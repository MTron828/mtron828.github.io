28. 3rd Floor (2)

"Is it good or bad?"

"It's not bad. As much as the Transcendent favors you, you can gain numerous abilities. They'll give you something better than what you received as a reward. It greatly helps in clearing the labyrinth."

Proof of struggle. A ritual sword. It's something better than this. If you accept it, you might even be able to run all the way up to the 10th floor without stopping.

"What about the drawbacks?"

A contract with the gods. It can't be all advantages. The ghost said.

"Your soul belongs to the Transcendent. And the other gods don't particularly like that, do they? There are many Transcendents in the labyrinth. They all want different things."

Rakiratas is the god of struggle and death. Levinef is the goddess of love.

Among the Transcendents, there was no chance of them playing nicely together like children.
Here is the English translation of the text:

"Rakiratas is particularly hostile. There are quite a few gods who don't like free-spirited movements that diminish their authority. You might encounter troublesome situations as you descend, right? And another thing. As much as it grants you power, you must follow the dictates of the Transcendent. No matter how unreasonable it may be, you cannot refuse."

"There are quite a few drawbacks."

Above all, the loss of freedom in action was significant. It means that if the god desires, they could drive you into sacrifice.

Especially with a capricious god like Rakiratas, it was even more dangerous.

"I've had a few calls, but I didn't take them. It makes you stronger, but also imposes limits on growth. It might not be bad from an elder's perspective, but it's not particularly attractive to us."

"He really hates it."

The ghost showed disgust at every mention of calling the dwarf. Taesan couldn't understand why he hated it so much.

"He only cares about debasing his slaves. How can anyone like that? You better ignore his words. He considers people like you and me as enemies."

A warrior. The deceased who went down to conquer the labyrinth.

He referred to the shop owner as an enemy.

"That's how it is for now."

The idea of accepting the apostle's contract faded even more. Except in dire situations, he didn't plan to accept it.

With things like this, one question arose.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"This is a labyrinth created long ago by a great sorcerer, and there's a rumor that it grants one wish to those who conquer it."

When entering the labyrinth, the system window spoke thus. At the time, he brushed it off, but thinking back now, it was rather strange.

Conquering must mean clearing it, right? Itaeyeon had cleared the labyrinth. However, he hadn't heard that she had made a wish.

"Could the Philosopher's Stone of Ouroboros be the wish?"

A stone that turns back time. It seemed plausible as a price for a wish, but Taesan dismissed his own thoughts.

If he knew Itaeyeon, she wouldn't be satisfied with just turning back time; she would ask to eliminate monsters or for a safe place instead.

"Hmm."

It was puzzling.

* * *

Taesan continued descending deeper into the labyrinth. He kicked away the goblin charging at him, causing it to fall.

"[Dealt 7 damage to the goblin with the staff.] [You have defeated the goblin wielding a staff.] [Huh?]"

The ghost paused.

"[...I kicked it and it took damage? What's this? Did you learn that from Ainz Ooal Gown?]"

"I know about it."

"[Because I was an old woman who went down into the labyrinth. It was very noisy every day, crying out for a god to find it.]"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"The ghost of the hero seemed to have been lingering in the labyrinth for quite some time.

And Ainz Ooal Gown had been lingering even longer than that ghost.

The ghost murmured as if displeased.

[That darn picky guy. I passed the benchmark too, but he didn't seem interested in helping me much.]

"Couldn't you receive it?"

[â€¦No, I couldn't.]

The ghost said, sounding annoyed.

"Hmph. No matter how good your skills are or how much information you have, strategy is a different matter. Now that you've entered the third floor, don't get too arrogant."

"I know. I'm not planning to ignore you."

"Huh, huh?"

The ghost was a player who had descended to the 85th floor. Unlike Itaeyeon, who had run in a conventional manner, he might be stronger than Itaeyeon was at the time of clearing.

There was also a sufficient possibility that he could lose to the hero of the past. Somewhat embarrassed, the hero spoke energetically.

"Huh, well. That's right. Activation skills are important, but I had swordsmanship!"

"Swordsmanship?"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"[It's the swordsmanship of our empire! There were numerous knights, but none could defeat me. I even earned the prestigious title of Swordmaster!]

Swordsmanship.

It was a skill that I thought was unnecessary in the previous world. However, my perspective changed when facing the breeds of Rakiratas.

Here, swordsmanship is just as important as activating skills.

"Can you teach it to me?"

[Huh?]

The ghost, seeming oddly pleased somewhere, let out a sigh.

[...I'm sorry, but I can't. Even if you were to ask in exchange for a gamble, some things just can't be done. I only teach those whom I acknowledge.]

"The constraints of the labyrinth?"

[In a way, yes.]

There seemed to be constraints when it came to imparting skills, despite no restrictions on information.

In a way, it was natural. If there were no such constraints, it would mean freely bestowing top-tier skills as one pleases.

"You're alright. Your skills aren't bad. I grumbled too sharply earlier, but you're strong enough now."

The ghost spoke calmly.

It was a more composed demeanor. The sharpness that had been visible until now had somewhat faded away.
[But you haven't proven yourself enough yet. You haven't faced a formidable opponent.]

The ghost had witnessed Taesan overwhelming with his dominating stats. But he hadn't seen him face a strong opponent. Taesan asked,

"If I prove myself?"

[Then I could teach you.]

"Alright then."

10th floor.

There was plenty of time. Taesan continued to advance through the labyrinth.

* * *

He continued wandering without much stimulation. Unlike the 2nd floor, where he didn't see any altars or orange doors, it took about an hour to explore freely on the 3rd floor.

And finally, it was time to return to the shop.

[Your inventory is full.]

"It's full."

The inventory has a total of 20 slots. Including arrows, roughly 15 pieces of equipment could fit inside. After wandering around the labyrinth, he managed to fill his entire inventory.

"Now, are you going back?"

"Of course."

Taesan returned to the shop. The dwarf frowned when he saw him.

"... Again?"

"Show me all the equipment."

At Taesan's composed words, the dwarf sighed.

"Ugh. This isn't good."

[Why do you judge whether it's good or bad?]
The dwarf's eyebrows twitched at the ghost's babbling. Instead of fighting, he opened a portal.

"Open up. Gate of Gold."

Numerous pieces of equipment rained down.

"There. Take your time and decide."

Taesan began inspecting each item. There were better equipment pieces scattered about compared to before he entered the 3rd floor.

[Necklace of the Strong] [Attack +2] [A necklace worn by a strong individual. It may contain their strength.] [1,000G]

Although the prices were higher, they held corresponding value. Taesan opened his inventory.

"How much for these?"

"...... Huh."

The dwarf chuckled dryly at the deluge of items. Soon, he started appraising them one by one.

"With these... it'll come to about 3,000 gold."

"I'll take them."

He had obtained a decent staff as well, all of which were staffs of confusion. Confusion was the lowest of the mental judgments. As long as there were random mental staffs, there was no need to use them.

Including the 2,500 gold he had, it amounted to 5,500 gold in total. It was more than enough to be more than enough. All the body's ornaments were worth buying
Taesan began selecting equipment. Thirty minutes later, his choices were finalized.

[Metal Ring] [Attack +1] [Your hand might hurt a bit more.] [600G]

He bought two metal rings. Rings can be worn on every finger. Buying a lot wasn't bad.

[Thorn Ring] [Attack +2] [The ring has thorns attached. The reason for its creation is unknown.] [1,000G]

He wanted to buy more rings, but attack power accessories were very rare. He looked everywhere but only found three.

[Necklace of the Strong] [Attack +2] [A necklace worn by a strong person. Its power might have been preserved.] [1,000G]

He bought four accessories like this. Total: 3,200 gold. Attack power increased by 5.

[Attack +16]

Current attack power figure. Now goblins are just two rooms. It wasn't a figure that could reach the 3rd floor. The watching ghost murmured as if impressed.

[Seriously, are there such skills?]

Even the ghost that went down to the depths saw a skill close to cheating. That's the art of Aylock weapons.

Remaining gold is 2,300G.
Taesan looked for more accessories, but there was nothing noteworthy. The ones that increased attack power were scarce and expensive.

Taesan changed his plan. He picked up a shield made of bronze.

[Bronze Shield] [Attack +1] [Defense +5] [Seems capable of blocking many attacks. It can even withstand very strong ones once.] [1,500G]

It was a one-handed shield with stats identical to the Tower Shield. Although it was about three times more expensive, it was worth buying.

Attack power 17. Defense 9.

It was a satisfying improvement. Remaining gold was 800G. He looked around the shop some more but found nothing else to buy. Taesan decided not to buy anything else and left.

"Then, until next time."

"Yeah. Farewell."

The dwarf gave a cold look to the ghost. The ghost responded with a smirk.

Taesan ignored them and left the shop.

---

The sword swung. The goblin wielding the shield tried to block it with his shield, but it was cut through.

"Kieeak!"

[20 damage to the goblin wielding the shield.] [You have defeated the goblin wielding the shield.] [Your level has increased.]

Taesan sharpened his sword.

"Is it over?"
[Maybe? Looks like a boss room up ahead.]

"There's nothing special here."

Unlike the first and second floors, there weren't any notable objects. Thanks to that, they could pass through quickly, but it was a bit boring.

"Beings like me or gods aren't enemies, but it's not like every floor is filled. Sometimes there are empty floors like this."

Itaeyeon had said that when they first entered. She had been very grateful for floors like this with nothing at all, but Taesan found them quite boring in contrast.

Nevertheless, it wasn't entirely without gains. By selling the equipment they obtained at the shop, they were able to significantly increase their attack power.

And their level had also increased.

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 9] [Health: 245/245] [Mana: 44/44] [Strength: 34] [Intelligence: 55] [Agility: 50] [Attack +17] [Defense +9] [Target is in optimal condition.]

Even though the experience points didn't rise easily, the goblin wielding the staff was worth a fair amount due to its magic. They had gone from level 7 to 9.

"I should start looking around soon."

Taesan wandered through the maze. The ghost realized at the meaningless steps they seemed to take.
[Secret room? It's going to eat up more time.]

"Because it's worth it."

Flame Staff. Ring that increases mana by 5.

Everything obtained in the secret room is an item that cannot be obtained on that floor. It was well worth investing an hour or two.

But it was just boredom. Since it was a truly meaningless repetitive act, there was no choice but to clear one's mind and proceed.

Taesan continued to wander through the labyrinth. However, unlike before, he didn't see any rooms that were completely empty.

"This is getting annoying."

Taesan frowned.

Secret rooms are usually hidden in rooms with nothing but one passage, but there were always exceptions. They could also be hidden in just ordinary rooms.

This time might be one of those cases.

If so, he would have to inspect the entire floor, so it was practically acceptable not to find it.

Taesan sighed with regret.

[You felt a strong intuition.]

"Huh?"

A single brick caught Taesan's eye. Outwardly, it looked like any other brick, one that Taesan wouldn't have paid attention to.
However, it can be understood.

That's the passage to the secret room.

Following his intuition, Taesan pushed the brick.

*Shhh*

As the brick moved, a passage was revealed.

[Perception skill increased by 5%.]

The ghost murmured in dismay.

"...This feels like a cheat. Why does intuition always kick in when finding secret rooms?"
