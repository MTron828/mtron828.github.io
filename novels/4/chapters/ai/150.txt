Chapter 151

151. Outside. The Battlefield of the Gods (7)

"Kuk!"

Kain's face, which had been distorted as he backed away, was full of despair.

"You didn't believe in God, did you? You said you were not a saint, didn't you?"

"I'm not a saint. I received it, that's all."

"Don't be ridiculous!"

Kain let out a loud roar.

Kain could not accept the words of the Taesan.

He was the greatest war hero in his own world.

He possessed a power that was unmatched even among all the countries, and even the emperor dared not speak out of turn in front of him. Everyone he met would bow down to him and worship him with their gaze.

Even hundreds of exceptional warriors gathered together could not defeat him, and natural disasters would subside before him.

He had confidence.

In the present generation, no one could match me, and in the previous generation, I was so powerful that I was barely counted among the fingers. This confidence.

However, even such a person had not received the saint's contract yet.

The saint is a position that guards God's side for a lifetime.
Here is the translation of the text:

Those who were evaluated as even greater than Cai had failed to ascend to the position of a savior throughout their entire lives in some cases.

Even Cai had barely managed to form an alliance to topple Tai Shan, which was a special exception.

However, Tai Shan's words were different.

He said that he did not believe in gods and that the gods had only shown him favor.

Cai could not accept this at all.

"This is an insult to us!"

"Whatever it is, it's an insult."

Tai Shan showed no interest.

Cai revealed his intense emotions, drawing his sword.

Although it was a forced position, it was still a blow from a savior. The power was hard to resist, making it difficult to dodge or avoid.

Tai Shan wielded his sword.

Clang.

Tai Shan's sword struck Cai's sword, and Tai Shan's sword passed through Cai's chest.

"Hah!"

It was a sudden counterattack, so Cai burst out laughing and dodged his body while raising his sword.

Cai's hilt was aimed at Tai Shan's head.

Kaang!

The tip of Tai Shan's sword collided with the blade of Cai's sword.

Screech.

And Cai's wrist was cut.

"Ah, ah?"

Cai grasped his wrist with his other hand, widening the distance. His face was pale with anxiety.

"How did this happen?"
Here is the translation of the text:

He deliberately evaded Taesan's counterattack and counterattacked instead. However, Taesan blocked his attack.

But suddenly, his arm was cut.

It was an incomprehensible incident, but Taesan seemed to have expected it, and immediately rushed at him.

"Ugh!"

Kain ground his teeth and swung his sword.

The sword clashed again.

[You have activated your counterattack.]

Just like before, Taesan deflected Kain's sword strike. Kain slowly gathered his strength and counterattacked, leaving Taesan with no choice but to defend.

Screech.

[Kain has taken 150 damage.]

However, just like before, a wound appeared on Kain's arm.

Taesan swung his sword again.

"This time, the damage gauge is up."

It didn't appear until now. If I think about it, the damage gauge also appeared when I was hit by an angel, but not when I was hit by a normal person.

"Is it a damage judgment attempted by those directly involved with God?"

"What, what's going on..."

Kain couldn't understand.

Clearly, he was supposed to be in a favorable situation, but he was getting injured instead.

Kain's face contorted in frustration.

"...You're using dirty tricks, aren't you?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan is not using martial arts, but magic or dark magic instead. Cain accepted it as such.

From Taesan's perspective, it was an unjust misunderstanding.

"This is my martial arts!"

"Don't be ridiculous! Is there even such a thing as that kind of martial arts?"

"It doesn't matter what I say."

This was Taesan's martial arts.

He created it in front of the god of the sword, and it was authenticated by the ghost.

[You have activated the Quake.]

"Ahahah!"

"Wow!"

Cain's arm was pushed back. Although their powers had been similar until then, the sudden difference was so great that Cain couldn't help but be shocked.

Taesan immediately grabbed Cain and swung his sword again. Cain hastily adjusted his stance and blocked the attack.

For Cain, this was the best response, but at the same time, it was also Taesan's plan.

"Ahahah!"

Cain's arm was pushed back again.

The Quake could be continuously activated by timing it with the acceleration of the attack, or by blocking the opponent's sword.

Ka ka ka!

Cain couldn't resist and was pushed back. Since the difference in power had suddenly increased by two times, it was a natural consequence.

"Kkkk!"

Taesan's sword cut through Cain's neck. He grasped his neck and retreated.
Here is the translation of the text:

Kaine's hand was injured and blood was flowing between his fingers, but he didn't have the mental capacity to care about it.

"What is this nonsense!"

[He accelerated.]

Paba-baba-ba!

Kaine's sword sliced through the air and tore off his armor.

Kaine's armor, once majestic, had become torn and tattered, resembling trash.

The mountain god wielded his sword.

"It's surprisingly robust."

It felt like he was facing an adventurer in a maze. Despite being an ordinary person, Kaine seemed to have the energy to keep going.

"Is that the power of a saint?"

More than anything, the wounds inflicted by the mountain god were slowly healing.

It seemed that these small attacks wouldn't be enough to bring him down.

[It was abnormal for the attacks to be effective in the first place.]

The ghost chuckled to himself. Although the mountain god had received divine power, he was only using a part of it. From the ghost's perspective, the mountain god's divine power was lacking in many ways.

The mountain god was simply relying on his superior status.

[But it's almost over.]

"I know."

The duration of the divine power was now only three minutes left.

He would end the battle with a single blow.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan had assumed a stance. Cain had also had sufficient time to prepare himself, but he was so disoriented that he couldn't.

"What, what's going on...?"

He couldn't resist anything.

Unfamiliar powers that were beyond his understanding were continuously bursting out.

However, he didn't have time to indulge in his thoughts. Meanwhile, Tai Shan was swinging his sword at him.

"Kkuk!"

Ka ka ka!

Cain finally focused on defense, bending down like a turtle and trying to block with minimal movements.

Tai Shan was thinking of breaking through Cain's defense.

[You launched a continuous attack.]

Kaaaa!

"Heh!"

A powerful vibration traveled through the sword and into Cain's arm.

Cain's hand, which was holding the sword, suddenly relaxed. Tai Shan plunged his sword into Cain's chest, and Cain hastily blocked the attack without even grasping the sword properly.

[You launched a jump attack.]

Kwa-jik.

Unprecedented power was packed into the sword.

Cain lost his grip on the sword.

He looked at the golden sword flying far away with a shocked expression.

A sword that has been dropped is worthless to a swordsman.

Tai Shan's sword pierced Cain's chest.
Here is the translation of the text:

He poured all his strength into rushing forward and colliding with the wall.

"Kuh!"

[Kain suffered 1989 damage.]

Similar damage piled up in rapid succession. Tai Shan drew his sword.

"It's my victory."

The divine aura surrounding Kain was gradually disappearing. It meant that his physical body and soul were unable to withstand the power of the gods.

At the same time, the duration of the Sadoization had come to an end.

As the powerful energy embedded in his body disappeared, he felt a slight sense of relief.

"This can't become a habit."

The knowledge, information, and power that had entered his mind, surpassing human understanding.

Everything was fascinating.

If he gave in, he would be able to sell his soul and become a Sado. It was even possible that Rakiatas had given him the Sadoization in order to achieve this goal.

Tai Shan calmed his mind.

The boiling excitement and passion had subsided. He looked at Kain with a genuine smile, and then burst into laughter.

"Ah, ah ha..."

The energy that had been embedded in his body just moments before had disappeared without a trace.

"It's... the end of my life..."

His words trailed off.

Kain died in this way.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Your prestige has been activated. Your vitality has permanently increased to 500, your strength to 85, your agility to 88, and your intelligence to 97.]

[Your prestige has been activated. The proficiency of Ability Sword has increased by 3%.]

[The proficiency of Holy Power has increased by 4%.]

[The proficiency of ??? has increased by 3%.]

In addition, the proficiency of various skills has increased.

You have also acquired a new skill.

[You have defeated the divine messenger and obtained the special skill "Slaughterer of the Divine".]

"Can I get the Slaughterer of the Divine if I kill the divine?"

[... Ah, no.]

The ghost didn't answer properly. It just murmured with a vague voice.

Tae-san also didn't pay much attention to it and looked at the system window instead.

[You have defeated the last divine messenger of the beautifully decorated sword. The beautifully decorated sword's divine messenger has been banished from the battlefield of the gods.]

[The gods of the labyrinth are pleased.]

[The sword's divine messenger smiles quietly. He is very satisfied with your actions.]

A powerful force is being released through the crack in the sky.

It's probably the beautifully decorated sword's divine messenger.

That's the end.

You are the only one left in the battlefield of the gods, Tae-san.

[Special Quest Success]

The success window and a golden light spread across the world. It's as if the world is shattering into pieces like a mirror.

[You return to the labyrinth.]
Here is the translation of the text:

As the world was crumbling, Tai Shan finally entered the labyrinth.

It's finally over.

Tai Shan inserted his sword.

* * *

"It's a quest that can't be cleared without me."

[I think that's what happened.]

Kain obtained the power of the Sages.

Even if Tai Shan wasn't there, the existence of the labyrinth threatened to destroy the world, so the Sages' authority was likely to be granted.

Or I would have descended and killed him myself.

Tai Shan, who possessed the Sage's power, was an enemy that couldn't be defeated.

And Kain was strong in and of himself.

Although Tai Shan was defeated without any resistance, his sword skills were never low.

Objectively speaking, Kain's power had reached the level of a mid-level adventurer in the early 40th floor.

It was an enemy that couldn't be defeated by a mid-level adventurer who had cleared the 30th floor.

[I think it was a test of his sword skills. In reality, his sword skills were quite high. It was just that his technique was not polished, so it was easy.]

The ghost seemed to think so too.

[Since I didn't know any countermeasures for your sword skills, it was even easier.]

"My greatest advantage with my sword skills, you know."
(Note: The last sentence is a quote from Tai Shan, and it seems to be a response to Kain's statement.)
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The first opponent encountered cannot find a counterattack method at all. This was a characteristic of Taesan's swordsmanship.

The speed of the counterattack suddenly doubles.

The strength also suddenly doubles.

In the case of a counterattack, it's even more so.

A ghostly voice muttered in a tone of awe.

"[Is that how the counterattack changed? Is this really not to be blocked swordsmanship?]" [Special skill: Counterattack] [Mana consumption: 5] [Mastery: 39%] [Counterattacks an enemy's attack and deals greater damage. Even attacks that cannot be countered can be countered.] [Conditions: Advanced swordsmanship [Ability Sword] [Condition 1: When attempting to counter an opponent's attack and failing.]
[Condition 2: After failing to counter, when the opponent attempts to attack within a certain time frame.]
[If both conditions are met, the opponent's attack and defense can be ignored and an attack can be launched. However, it is impossible to inflict a critical hit.]

Thanks to the effect of Ability Sword, it is possible to use counterattacks more actively.

The variable of failure rather than success is something Taesan can adjust to some extent, and as a result, the subsequent attacks will hit as a sure hit, making the opponent disoriented.
Here is the translation of the text:

In reality, Cain did that.

He tried to block Taesan's counterattack and launch an attack.

However, Taesan ignored the attack and counterattacked Cain, causing him to become greatly flustered and unable to launch a proper attack.

The damage itself was not particularly significant, but it was a skill that could create a major variable in the battle.

"It's not easy anyway."

The risk of failing to counterattack was great. Even if I tried to attack from this side, it was not a condition that could guarantee a 100% success rate.

"It's okay, but it's like playing a card game."

Taesan muttered to himself. It was like playing a card game, fulfilling conditions and pulling off effects.

"What about the reward, when will it come?"

It had been a while since we returned to the labyrinth, and nothing had changed.

However, just as Taesan's words were about to end, a system window appeared.

[Many gods question the decision of a few gods.]

"What's the question?"

Before I could think about that, the window popped up.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The realm of the god of selection has shrunk. The realm of the god of proof has shrunk. The realm of the god of victory has shrunk. The realm of the god of magic has shrunk. The realm of the god of struggle and death has shrunk. The realm of the god of the sword has shrunk. The realm of the god of magic has shrunk.

The Great Mountain has stopped."
