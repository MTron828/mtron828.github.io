Chapter 545

545. The Treasure Box of the Usurper (3)

[Is this real?]

Akasha was shocked.

[I didn't remember anything...…]

"That's the same for me. I still can't remember who I was before or what I was. But... I remembered where it is."

Arirnan smiled with satisfaction.

"It's all thanks to you, Akasha. You're indeed my apostle. No, I should say you were my apostle."

[I apologize.]

"There's no need to apologize. It's all because of my own fault."

Arirnan didn't mind at all.

She was enjoying herself right now. Very much so.

"Just knowing that what I lost is there is enough to make me satisfied."

"Where is it?"

Arirnan said it was in the Treasure Box of the Usurper.

Then, where is the Treasure Box?

Arirnan answered.

"The Treasure Box of the Usurper. Everything of mine is left there. Not just mine, but everything that was stolen from the Usurper is gathered there."

"......Is this real?"

Taesan was shocked.

According to Arinlan's words, it meant that she had discovered the place where all the things stolen by the thief were gathered.

"This is something even the thief didn't expect."

Arinlan said with a cheerful tone.

"Those who were stolen from by that guy lose everything. Their very existence is erased from this universe. But I wasn't."

Arinlan had clearly forgotten everything.

However, her apostle, Akasha, remained in the labyrinth, having lost herself. Neither the wizards nor Arinlan knew how this was possible or why Akasha remained in the labyrinth.

But Akasha appeared before Taesan in the labyrinth.

And Taesan defeated Akasha, used the materials to create a ring, and revived Akasha.

As a result of continuously giving Akasha power, Akasha remembered Arinlan.

Arinlan was able to reappear in the world. It was a miraculous event that occurred through numerous coincidences.

"I can finally take revenge on that despicable existence. What a delightful thing."

Taesan gazed at the wizard.

"Do even the transcenders know?"

"I just found out. It's amazing... but it's a good thing. We can now take advantage of their weakness."

The wizard's face also looked extremely pleased.

"We've always been on the defensive when fighting against the gods, getting attacked first."

It was an unavoidable situation. The gods couldn't be killed, and they were limited beings. Moreover, they were the winners. We had no choice but to defend ourselves.

But now, we have the opportunity to strike first. The wizard was overjoyed.

"I don't know how much the usurper has usurped, but looking at Arin's case, it's not insignificant. If we can destroy them all, it's a great opportunity. It means we can take away one of their cards before the war starts."

From Taesan's perspective, it wasn't bad either. He could now take revenge on the usurper. It was a good thing.

And a memory flashed through Taesan's mind.

In the past, when he was still unable to escape from the usurper's grasp.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He had a dream.

In that dream, all the noble concepts and materials of the world were scattered around like trash.

And there was a distorted existence guarding that place.

Perhaps that place was the treasure chest of the usurper. If his dream was correct, Arin's words were the answer.

But there was one problem.

"So, where is that treasure chest?"

"……."

"……."

The wizard and Arin simultaneously shut their mouths.

Seeing their reaction, one possibility was drawn in Taesan's mind.

"Impossible."

"Yes, as you expected. The treasure chest of the usurper cannot exist in this world."

The wizard let out a dry laugh.

"The realm of the exiled usurpers. The treasure chest of the usurper is there."

* * *

The gods won the war.

The losers were the usurpers. They were banished from this universe and sealed away in a distant realm.

And the treasure chest of the usurper was inside.

Taesan, who had been silent for a moment, asked.

"Can we enter?"

"Uncertain……"

The wizard couldn't give a clear answer.

"That place is unknown even to us."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The transcenders banished the high gods beyond that point.

And they didn't intervene anymore.

There was no need to enter the prison that held all the evil in the world, where they only had to catch the occasional escapees and deal with them.

So, they didn't know what was on the other side of the high gods' banishment.

"Then isn't this a meaningless story? You guys can't even cross over."

"That's right. That's not this world. The concept of the universe doesn't apply there. The transcenders can't cross over."

"Then..."

Taesan, who was about to speak, closed his mouth.

The wizard and Arirnan were staring at Taesan.

Taesan scowled.

"What if..."

"There's only one person in this world who can cross over."

Arirnan muttered.

Taesan let out a dry laugh.

"Are you telling me to cross over?"

"It's not that I'm telling you to cross over. It's just that you're the only one who can."

The wizard said with an ambiguous tone.

"After all, you're the only one who's free in this world, even in the realm of the high gods."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The treasure chest of the plunderer is in the realm of the gods.

And only those who can surpass the great mountain can reach it.

It was a simple elimination method. It wasn't a wrong statement either.

"You don't know what's on the other side, do you?"

"Nothing."

The wizard shook his head.

"But I know about the past."

"The past?"

"We won the war against the gods and banished them. We gained ownership of the universe. What do you think that means?"

"......Did this world originally have a realm of the gods too?"

"That's right."

The wizard nodded.

"You've seen the realm of the old gods, haven't you?"

"I did. It was ridiculously weak, though."

"Think of it as an expansion pack. It was terrifying and alien. The existence of this world was a place where we couldn't set foot. We won and banished their realm along with them to the other side, creating the current universe."

What exists on the other side is the realm of the gods that once existed in this world.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We also have memories, but... it's been too long, so I'm not sure how things have changed now."

"There are not only gods there. There are also many corrupted beings that originated from them, and among them, there are those with pure intellect who can converse with you."

"Like traitors?"

"Similar, but different. Traitors were beings of this world who sided with them, but those beings originated from the gods. They have a different nature."

What lies beyond?

And what kind of world is that?

It was unknown. The wizard spoke as if making excuses.

"I'm not telling a story that's impossible. Rather, the probability is high. Even if you cross over to that world, the gods won't be able to target you."

"Why is that?"

"They're quite busy, you see."

The wizard lightly waved his hand, and the space jumped, expanding his field of vision.

What appeared beyond the space was the world of the gods and the boundary that separated it from this world.

The boundary now had cracks, and gaps were visible.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was precarious, as if it would collapse at any moment, but it was holding on. This was because numerous transcenders were manifesting their concepts to protect the boundary.

"'The plunderer and the god of downfall touched the boundary, but it didn't break easily. If the transcenders hold on, even the gods would have to use all their might to break it.'

"'This is an opportunity to trample the universe again, so they'll also go all out. They won't have time to worry about internal affairs.'

"'Can't you hide your body with the boundary you have?'

"Taesan nodded.

"He knew one thing now.

"If he wrapped his body in ash-colored clothes and concealed himself, he could hide from the gods as well.

"It was impossible to detect Taesan unless the opponent recognized him or approached within a certain distance. Otherwise, it was sufficient. Simply taking a step forward was not enough to detect Taesan.

"'I understand why you suggested it.'

"Taesan muttered to himself. While the gods were using all their might to break the boundary, he would sneak past and break the plunderer's treasure box.

"It was a rational plan."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But ultimately, I don't know what's beyond. Taking on the risk was a heavy burden. The wizard also knew that, so he spoke with a calm face.

"This isn't an order or a trial. It's a proposal."

From the start, the current Taesan couldn't even give orders to them. Even if they were equal existences, it was pointless. They were counterparts who needed to make a deal, not undergo a trial.

"If you don't accept, the 96th floor quest will change."

"I'm not being stubborn either. It's unfortunate, but this isn't the end. I'll fight them anyway. There's always an opportunity."

That was a world where concepts didn't apply. Even transcendents couldn't help. The wizard and Arirnan thought it was highly likely that Taesan would refuse.

"Okay."

But Taesan accepted it right away.

The wizard's face was filled with surprise, as it was extremely unexpected.

"Really?"

"Didn't I propose it because I wanted to accept it?"

"No. That's true, but the risk is too great."

"It's a risk we'll have to take someday. The seal will break anyway."

In the end, it was just a matter of time. The seal would break, and the gods would reveal themselves to the world.

And among them, there would be usurpers."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The plunderer has set his sights on Taesan.

It wasn't just a simple desire or curiosity. He had a clear and strong greed, and he was determined to make Taesan his own.

"Then, as you said, this is the opportunity."

The gods took advantage of the plunderer's momentary lapse and drained his power. It was the perfect answer.

But that was only the story from an outsider's perspective.

When you become the main character, there was no such luxury. You would enter the unknown realm of the gods, and even the plunderer's treasure box, without knowing the location or the way back. You wouldn't even know if you could return.

But Taesan didn't show any particular excitement.

"I have to do it anyway."

While the gods were distracted, the plunderer organized his treasure box. It was the perfect answer. Then, Taesan just did what he had to do.

"What's with the surprise now? I've always been like this."

Taesan thought it was strange that the wizard was surprised. Even if Arirnan didn't know Taesan well, the wizard shouldn't be surprised. He should know that Taesan had always been like this and had reached this place in the same way.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's... right."

If it were Taesan, he would calculate the possibilities and act accordingly. But Taesan has already reached a solitary, unshakeable realm.

At the very least, it was a kind of milestone for other transcendents. They no longer needed to challenge themselves or take risks. That's why many transcendents stopped challenging themselves after reaching the realm.

But Taesan was different.

To him, reaching the realm meant nothing.

He was still the same.

So, he just did what he had to do.

"That's right."

The magician chuckled.

In fact, it was true. Most of them had reached the end and forgotten themselves.

"It's as if I'm rediscovering myself anew."

The magician thought to himself, his eyes becoming serious.

"Alright, then I'll accept it?"

Taesan nodded. Arirnan chuckled.

"This... I'm sorry. I have nothing to give you now."

"It doesn't matter. It's also for my own sake."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No. Even if you're a transcendent being, you have to pay the price."

Arirnan raised her hand with a serious face.

"I, as a goddess who has lost herself, declare this. If you retrieve what's mine, I'll give you what's yours."

A declaration that sets the name of the nameless one. The moment the name is recovered, the declaration gains absolute binding power.

The magician applauded with great enthusiasm.

"Then let's get ready right away. To cross over into the unknown realm of agony, where no one knows what lies ahead."
