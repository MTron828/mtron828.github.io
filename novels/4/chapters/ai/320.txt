Chapter 321

321. 70th Floor, the Fire Spirit King, Vishnu (4)

Taesan infused power into the sword stuck in his chest.

[You activated the Branch of Despair.]

"Kkkkkuuuu!"

At that moment, a sense of despair flooded Vishnu's mind. Vishnu barely withstood it and swung his arm.

[Vishnu activated the All-People Exclusion.]

Kyiiiing.

Vishnu's bracelet shone, and Taesan's body was pushed back a great distance. It was not a physical force, but a way of moving that warped space itself to create distance.

[You activated Random Blink.]

However, the moment Vishnu stabbed the sword into his chest, the seal was already engraved. Taesan immediately moved in front of Vishnu. The sword came down, and Vishnu hastily blocked it.

Kwaaaang!

Vishnu's arm was pushed back. Just as Taesan was about to slam him to the ground with all his might, Vishnu's body disappeared.

[Vishnu activated the Space Transfer Shoes.] [You activated Acceleration.] [You activated Skill Acceleration.]

Tap.

And Taesan arrived right in front of the landed Vishnu.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Vishnu barely dodged the direct attack and let out a cry of surprise.

"How did you...!"

"It's obvious."

Vishnu's pattern of spatial leaps, estimated location, and principles of action had all been figured out. It was clear where Vishnu would move to in any situation.

"Can't you leap anymore?"

And the restrictions of the spatial transition shoes had also been grasped. As a charging-type equipment, it could be used up to three times in a row, and after using all three, a certain amount of charging time was required.

Vishnu activated the shoes three times in a row. For a while, it was unavoidable.

Kwaaaang!

The sword came crashing down, brutally pressing down on Vishnu.

Vishnu was also taking a beating, but he didn't back down and swung his sword to counterattack.

The two exchanged blows.

"Kkkk!"

As their health decreased, Taesan had a forced health drain, making it a beneficial exchange for him.

Kagagak!

Taesan swung his sword, knocking away Vishnu's sword. As Taesan counterattacked, Vishnu dodged and swung his sword back.

[You have activated a counterattack.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Ability Sword, triggered by Taesan, ignored Vishnu's black sword and pierced her chest.

"Kkoolruk!"

She twisted the sword and put strength into her feet.

Kwaaaang!

She activated her acceleration and slammed into the wall. Vishnu tried to unleash flames, but only managed to produce a small spark.

She had almost exhausted all her strength.

"Ha, haha..."

Vishnu, bleeding, collapsed to the ground. Taesan retrieved his sword.

"You did well."

Taesan praised Vishnu.

It wasn't an empty compliment. At the point where Vishnu's strength had dropped to the level where she couldn't even summon flames, her chances of winning were zero.

She had to fight with her pure physical strength and swordsmanship, but as a spirit, she couldn't defeat Taesan with her sword skills. Even in terms of simple stats, Taesan surpassed Vishnu.

It was thanks to her deep-seated equipment that she was able to hold out this far, and that in itself was proof of her abilities.

"It's humiliating. I'm not in a position to receive pity from anyone."

Perhaps because she knew that, or because she had given up everything, Vishnu accepted it calmly.

"I... am going to die here."

Vishnu smiled wryly.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$In nature, there is no self. Therefore, the spirits with a self will eventually, when their self becomes muddied, fall into corruption.

That is the death of a spirit.

She, being a spirit king, possesses a lofty position and an unmeasurable lifespan, but still, she will one day face certain death.

She feared it greatly.

She did not want to die.

And so, she entered the labyrinth, forsaking all else, in order to obtain a perfect self.

But she was defeated by Taisan.

Her self gradually fades away. She begins to return to being a part of nature.

It was the moment when one of the oldest spirits in the world was dying.

It was the moment she had feared so much, but surprisingly, there were no great emotional upheavals.

"Quiet,"

Vishnu looked at the ghost, not releasing his anger or fear.

"Hero, do you bear a grudge against me?"

The ghost had not said a word since meeting Vishnu.

The ghost finally spoke.

[I thought about mocking you, but... you have no enmity with me. That's why I've been quiet.]

"I see."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Vishnu was someone who, even among the top brass, had no connection with the ghost. They had hardly exchanged a few words. As such, the ghost didn't show any particular emotions towards Vishnu either.

[The one I really want to meet is just one person.]

"......Sosiet Gardenia. Is she the ash-colored woman?"

Vishnu smiled quietly.

"It's a shame that I won't be able to see that."

Vishnu leaned his head against the wall. She closed her eyes.

"My god, I will return to you."

With a soft voice, Vishnu's body was engulfed in flames.

The scattering sparks in the air left behind a small orb before disappearing.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**Victory Achieved**

[You have defeated Vishnu.] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [Your spiritual power has increased permanently, with HP increasing by 5011, strength by 629, agility by 532, and intelligence by 643.] [The desire for victory has been activated, permanently increasing HP by 1066, strength by 358, agility by 333, and intelligence by 240.] [The seed of life has been activated, permanently increasing HP by 501, strength by 62, agility by 53, and intelligence by 64.] [The proficiency of the green witch's magic has increased by 2%.] [The proficiency of partial world transformation has increased by 3%.] [Your spiritual power has increased, and you have acquired the special skill [Avatar of Nature].] [Your spiritual power has increased, and the proficiency of spirit magic has increased by 5%, spirit contract: Wind King, and the proficiency of natural harmony has increased by 4%.] [You have obtained the core of the Fire King.] [You have obtained the ancient essence of nature.]

It's over.

Taesan grasped the orb.

* * *

It wasn't an easy opponent. The moment the partial world transformation occurred in the king's world, Taesan was unable to do anything and was attacked one-sidedly.

If there was no partial world transformation, he would have had to risk danger and use the boundary line.

"I did well to hold back."

Thanks to that, he was able to push back Vishnu's domain and confront him.

Of course, this time the situation was special.

Vishnu's trump card was transforming the domain.

But Taesan also had the power of domain transformation. And the power Taesan possessed was that of an immortal.

If they had similar abilities, Taesan, who possessed the power of an immortal, would have the upper hand.

However, there was no disadvantage.

"The consumption of catalysts is high."

In the battle against Vishnu, he had almost exhausted the catalysts obtained from the green witch. To use them in this way, he would have to obtain more catalysts again.

Furthermore, the consumption of mana was also high. The more laws he added to counter the opponent's domain, the more mana was consumed exponentially.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If the crazy spirit hadn't been there, the mana of Taesan would have been depleted in an instant during the battle of consumption.

'I need to do some research.'

Methods to reduce catalyst consumption, and standards for the areas where mana is consumed, etc.

It was a skill worth having.

Taesan opened his status window.

[Level: 141] [Shield: 7799/7799] [Health: 90820/90820] [Mana: 7540/7540] [Magic: 1128/1128] [Strength: 15939] [Intelligence: 14441] [Agility: 16095] [Attack Power +5792] [Defense +3942] [The target is in the best condition.]

As I descended from the labyrinth, my level kept rising, and after winning against Vishnu, my stats increased rapidly. Now, even compared to Lee Tae-yeon, there's a significant difference.

And I also acquired a new skill.

[Spirit Skill: Avatar of Nature] [Mana Consumption: 1500] [Proficiency: 1%] [Duration: 1 hour] [It transforms into nature itself, turning the surrounding energy into one's own power. During the duration, dominance over nature is gained, and the caster's abilities and strength are enhanced.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Avatar of Nature. When Vishnu used this skill, its power rose to the level of Taesan. 

[You have activated the Avatar of Nature.]

A fierce energy burst forth.

The surrounding nature began to move according to Taesan's will. Along with it, Taesan's speed, strength, and power increased. Everything was enhanced.

"Is this it?"

Taesan had previously obtained the spirit skills of a deer walking on the wind and a small spark.

The Avatar of Nature seemed to be the highest-level spirit skill among them.

It was extremely useful. It was a skill that would be of great help in battle, like the Sadohwa or the King's Vessel.

[Core of the Fire Spirit King] [Core containing the power of the Fire Spirit King. What is embedded within is absolute dominance over flames.] [Ancient Essence of Nature] [The energy of nature that has existed since the creation of the world has taken shape.]

Two material items obtained by defeating the Fire Spirit King.

[You have summoned the Wind Spirit King, Minerva.]

The wind howls, and Minerva appears. Due to the aftermath of the battle, she seems to be in a state where her power is barely perceptible.

"Ugh... why did you call me? I was resting..."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She gazed at the two orbs in Taesan's hand with a dying face, muttering to herself.

"I won. I thought I could win, but..."

Minerva's face was a bit complicated.

"Winning is naturally joyful, but it's also a bit bittersweet."

Although the Fire Spirit King was hostile towards Taesan, he was still the Spirit King. As the same Spirit King, Minerva couldn't simply be overjoyed.

Of course, this wasn't a particularly meaningful conversation for Taesan. Taesan handed over the orbs.

"Here. Can you use these?"

"Those orbs? Let me take a look."

Minerva took the two orbs and examined them from all sides.

"These can be used right away."

She pointed to the ancient natural essence.

"This isn't something imbued with the will or power of something, but simply a natural essence. As time passes, the power that has accumulated to the extreme can be absorbed, so I can use it."

"Then you use it."

"Is it okay? It's a very valuable item, after all."

"It doesn't matter."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan said. Minerva was not enough to fight against the headquarters. She needed to become stronger. Minerva grasped the orb and crushed it.

The power of nature within began to dwell in her. As her power grew, she let out a triumphant cry.

"Oo……."

Minerva, who had gathered her strength, clenched her fist. The wind scattered around her.

"……It's incredible."

"Can you now use the abilities that Vishnu used?"

"It's not that much, but... I've become quite strong. I think I can withstand the King's World even if it's activated now."

That was a satisfactory change. Taesan pointed to another orb in Minerva's hand.

"What about that one?"

Inside that orb, flames were flickering.

Minerva touched the orb with an uncertain expression.

"I can't handle this carelessly either. It's the first time I've heard that the dead Spirit King left a core."

The Spirit King, who was defeated by a mortal, left behind his core.

It was an impossible event, and even Minerva, who had gained much knowledge in the process of becoming a king, couldn't find an answer.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Can I absorb the power of another attribute? And does Father allow it... It's something I don't know at all. I should check it out first."

"Then you should have it for now."

"Got it. And I'll take this too."

Minerva opened her other hand, and a very small energy was gathered there. It was a power that couldn't be compared to the essence of nature or the core of the Spirit King.

Taesan was able to easily identify its true form.

"A crazy spirit."

A small spirit that had been bound to the labyrinth, seeking revenge and fulfilling its own desires.

"Wasn't it dead?"

"Similar, but... a strong sense of self remains. Since I received help, I can do something about it."

"It doesn't matter."

The crazy spirit did more than Taesan had thought. Minerva smiled faintly.

"Then I'll go rest again. See you later."

Minerva disappeared with the Spirit King's core.

Finally, Taesan checked his sword.

The crazy spirit had fulfilled its desire and disappeared.

Therefore, the ability to face the spirit inside the sword was gone.

Instead, something new was born.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[The crazy spirit has fulfilled its own wish by entering the labyrinth. A reward is given to you for making it happen.] [I obtained the "Collection of Negativity".] [Collection of Negativity] [A collection of emotions containing all hatred and anger. It seems like I can create equipment by processing it as a material.]

It's unclear whether the spirit is giving a personal reward or if it's a reward from the labyrinth dimension for fulfilling the wish, but it's not a worthless reward.

The rough cleanup is over.

Taesan turned his gaze. The sound of applause was heard.

Broken Man, who was leaning against the wall, was looking at Taesan with a satisfied face and applauding.
