Chapter 217

217. The 30th Floor, the ring of white and black (1)

The note was asking him to come back to the place where they last met.

Taesan had last met Halfdan on the 30th floor. It was 22 floors away from the 52nd floor.

In the end, Taesan had to climb the floors one by one.

"What will be created?"

He used an incredibly large number of materials. Each one was worth surpassing the 50th floor. It was expected to be that way.

[When I think about the materials, I wonder if I will need a ring that can clear the labyrinth until the end. But Halfdan has never dealt with such materials before, so I don't know what will happen.]

The ghost was also uncertain.

[If that person's skills are sufficient, it may be possible, but I don't know.]

"What will happen?"

New equipment was necessary to deal with the strong enemies and powerful existences that would appear in the future.

Expectation and anxiety. Taesan held both feelings and arrived at the 30th floor.

"I'm here."

Halfdan was waiting for him at that place.
Here is the translation of the text:

He was extremely exhausted, unlike his usual state of remembrance of Tai Shan. His entire body was as limp as a deflated balloon, and his skin was as dry and cracked as the earth.

However, his eyes shone brighter than ever before.

"Are you okay?"

"It's fine. My physical body may not be in top shape, but mentally I'm in a state of clarity like never before."

Hafran nodded.

"What you're looking for is there."

Tai Shan gazed at the place he was pointing to. There was a pillar there.

The pillar had a pair of rings on it.

One was spotlessly pure and white, while the other was black and seemed to be able to swallow everything.

The rings emitted a faint aura. It was clear that they were not ordinary equipment.

As Tai Shan approached the rings, Hafran warned him, "Be careful."

Tai Shan picked up the ring.

In that instant, a powerful energy burst out of the ring.

It was as if he was pushing away everything that was approaching him. Tai Shan reflexively withdrew his hand.

Tai Shan gazed blankly at the ring.
Here is the translation of the text:

The two rings emitted a peculiar aura, similar to that of a hedgehog.

"What's this? This thing?"

"This cursed ring decides its owner. It won't accept anyone who doesn't meet its standards. Thanks to that, I couldn't even approach the ring, let alone talk to it."

Half-ran muttered to himself. The ghostly being let out a sigh and nodded in admiration.

"Did you make that ring? Like that?"

"Not that much. But I do think it has a certain degree of self-awareness. Since it's made of materials, I expected something like that, but I didn't think it would be so finicky."

Half-ran put a dry cracker into his mouth and said, "It's hard to suppress the ring with brute force, so just wait a bit. I'll make a tool to help you."

"You don't need that."

Tae-san approached the ring. Half-ran tried to stop him.

"Just a minute..."

[You don't need to stop me.]

The ghostly being spoke calmly.

Tae-san grasped the ring at the same time as a surge of power hit him.

The power that repels everything that approaches him.

That's more than just a simple power; it's a kind of pride.

"So then..."
Here is the translation of the text:

The suppression was extremely simple. Tai-san had elevated his own spiritual level.

Kuuuung!

The intense energy from the ring was being crushed by Tai-san's energy.

Tai-san had suppressed the energy with his hand.

"Stay calm."

He could have suppressed this level of energy without using the Sado spell, relying solely on his own energy.

"I am your master. Treat me as a tool and use me as I wish."

Kwajik.

Tai-san gripped the ring tightly.

The rushing energy suddenly stopped.

Tai-san raised his hand. A pair of rings were quietly hovering above his palm.

Half-ran's face was filled with surprise.

"That's so easy……."

"Of course, I've become that strong. That's why I can suppress it easily."

He could have easily suppressed the energy of the 30th floor-grade Graimen.

"Really strong, huh……."

Half-ran smiled satisfactorily.

"Then let's confirm it. These are the rings I've poured all my energy into."

At this moment, he could easily suppress the resistance of the ring. However, he would have had to struggle with the 30th floor-grade Graimen or rely on the assistance of others.
Here is the translation of the text:

The meaning was that it possessed the power to refuse adventurers of a level that could handle simple equipment, with a strength of 30 to 40 floors.

Tae-san examined a pair of rings.

One was a black ring.

From there, a rough aura was felt. Although Tae-san acknowledged it, it didn't seem to have been fully accepted, and it emitted a subtle rebellious aura.

[A dark ring with a powerful and majestic aura] [The user's level is not high enough to fully utilize its effects.] [Attack power + 500] [A ring forged from the claws of a dragon and the ashes of a divine king. It's just strong. The two great auras collided to form a single ego, but this ego is not pure, is violent, and does not recognize anything except for the twins. Only those who can fully tame this ego will gain another power.]

"Uh."

"What?"

Tae-san and the ghost spoke simultaneously.

Half-ran was satisfied with their reactions.

"Are you satisfied?"

"No... This is it."

Tae-san couldn't continue speaking. The ring was so shocking that even someone who wouldn't normally be flustered was taken aback.

The ghost spoke on his behalf.

"What's this? This ring, right?]
Here is the translation of the text:

"Yes, as you can see from the explanation."

"No, that's not it. That's not it either."

The spirit also read the explanation, but it couldn't understand the performance that was attached to it.

"...Attack power 500? Is this attached to the ring? I've never seen such a level in the depths..."]

"That's a warrior. You didn't go down to the depths properly, so you can't find such equipment."

"That's not it either."

The spirit repeated the same words foolishly.

It was clear that he had been killed by the guides before he could properly descend to the depths.

However, the performance was still hard to understand.

Tai Shan laughed mockingly.

"One ring is almost half of my attack power."

"Of course. You gave me materials worthy of that, so I should have such equipment."

"That's definitely right."

The spirit let out a snort and a sigh.

"...Is this okay?"]

"Will there be a problem? He only received payment for a just cause."

Half-ran said it was no problem at all.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Even if he has the strength he has now, it's not a problem if he can obtain this level. He cannot be denied, so the ghost kept silent."

This is a match for the gods' apostle. And it's a monster born from the high gods. A fragment of a monster that destroyed the world. It's not a monster that a 50th-floor adventurer can handle.

So, it's not strange for such a Taesan to have equipment that surpasses the 50th floor. It's just that his thoughts were stuck on the ring with unparalleled performance.

"What's the other one?"

The white ring, which was in stark contrast to the black ring, also had a completely opposite aura.

The black ring was rough and rebellious, while the white ring had an elegant aura, like a noble. It seemed to submit to Taesan's touch and acknowledge him.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The ring is imbued with a subtle and mysterious aura, as if it is a pure and untainted thing. However, the user's level is still low, and they are unable to fully unleash its true power.]

[This ring is a creation of the source of light and the source of the messenger. Despite the great disparities between them, they have merged into one. It possesses a strong sense of self and dignity, and is also able to accept others, excluding only the twin souls. Once someone has fully mastered this ring, they will gain even more power.]

[There was no obvious effect like a black ring. However, just by having it, one can already feel the power of the ring.]

["Equipment with a spiritual attribute..."]

From the equipment itself, one can feel an unparalleled power. This power is helping the mountain.

The mountain decided to test the spiritual attribute and pulled it out. Then, it twisted and manipulated the spiritual attribute into three proofs and scattered them in all directions.

Kwa-jik.

A type of power was scattered in all directions.

Normally, it would take a great deal of fatigue to manipulate the spiritual attribute. However, the mountain did not feel any burden. It was only slightly fatigued, but it was not a burden.

Therefore, after writing the messenger's script, it would be even more effortless to manipulate the spiritual attribute.

One has gained a certain advantage in utilizing the spiritual attribute. Although it is not obvious like a black ring, it has a similar effect.

Another effect is that it can store power, but I don't know exactly what kind of effect it is, but it's not a simple effect.

"Too good, isn't it?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san was astonished.

Even these effects were not perfect effects. There was a sentence written that Tae-san's power was still lacking to fully master the ring.

The more he went down, the stronger he became, and the ring's performance would also grow accordingly.

It was a ring that exceeded his imagination. Half-ran was also smiling with satisfaction.

"I always wanted to create a great equipment that would be worthy of being called great. Since this was the opportunity to realize my dream, I poured all my heart into it."

Tae-san wore both rings.

Since he needed to replace a new ring, he had to take out the two good rings, but since the performance was not disappointing, it didn't matter.

As soon as he wore the ring, the energy contained in the ring began to resonate with Tae-san.

[You put on a pair of rings dyed with colors. Set effect activation. Strength, agility, and intelligence increase by 5%.]

With the set effect, all stats increased by 5%. It was truly laughable.

"Status window."
Here is the translation of the text:

[Kang Tae-san] [Level: 113] [Shield: 3469/3469] [Stamina: 36520/36520] [Mana: 3458/3458] [Magic: 582/582] [Strength: 7401] [Intelligence: 6281] [Agility: 6788] [Attack Power +1958] [Defense Power +1322] [The target is in its best state.]

Attack power is now just 2000 away.

It had suddenly become stronger to the point where it was incomparable to before.

"'Are you satisfied? I am too. It was a happy time.'"

He held his hammer nonchalantly.

"'Take it with you again next time. I'll make it entertaining.'"

"'Alright, I'll take it.'"

"'What?'"

Tae-san passed on the will to perish, which he had obtained by defeating a giant and a dragon in the world of giants.

At first glance, the equipment he was wearing seemed to be emitting a strange aura.

"'What is this thing again?'"

He examined each item and let out a loud laugh when he saw the will to perish.

"'This is... another one. I've got a fun one.'"

"'What is it?'"

"'The will to bring about the destruction of the world. I'm well aware of it. Since my world has already been destroyed by this, I will.'"

It occurred to him that Hafren's world was actually the one that had destroyed them.

He smiled happily as he gathered materials.

"'This will be a warm-up for later. I won't have a moment's peace, come find me again later. I'll make something else.'"

Note: Kang Tae-san is likely a character in a game or a fictional story, and the text appears to be a conversation between him and another character, likely Hafren. The story seems to be about Tae-san's progress in the game or story, and his acquisition of powerful equipment and abilities.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan left the half-finished labyrinth and went back down again.

He arrived at the 52nd floor once more. He found a transparent snake and immediately thrust his sword into it.

[Dealt 3423 damage to the transparent snake.]

The damage increased significantly.

The snake couldn't withstand the attack and disappeared instantly.

Even if it hadn't been fast, it would have been even faster to break through the labyrinth.

He quickly broke through the secret room and caught the boss.

The rewards on the 52nd floor were all related to magic. He gathered them and took them to Rilis as a gift.

"Fast... The next intermediate magic is almost gone. Just a little more, and you'll be fine!"

She encouraged Tai Shan with shining eyes.

And then Tai Shan arrived at the 53rd floor.

The monster on the 53rd floor was a centipede. It was a monster with a tough, thick web and a raised head, but it was no match for Tai Shan.

50th floor and above.

New things appeared, but nothing changed. The power Tai Shan had accumulated so far did not decline even when entering a new layer.
Here is the translation:

Just like before, the only things that can stop him are special things. Altars of the gods. Immortals. Guides. High-ranking spirits, etc.

And it has appeared.

[You have discovered Beatrice's altar.]
