**Chapter 399**

399. 80th Floor, Lion King (3)

Everything begins to collapse centered around Acylus' sword. Even the walls of the labyrinth, which boasted an absolute defense, cannot withstand the power of collapse and start to crack.

However, Taesan does not back down.

With the divine power firmly embedded in his body, he charges towards Acylus' sword. The power of collapse engulfs Taesan, but it is blocked by the divine power and absolute protection, unable to reach him.

"Minerva, retreat."

"It seems I won't be able to help you from here. Good luck."

Acylus' gaze is filled with frustration and anger.

Acylus' sword, as a tool, begins to carry out its master's will.

Kwaaaang!

The sword swings, containing the power to collapse everything.

[Acylus' sword has activated collapse.]

Tzeeeong!

"Uh."

Taesan, who clashed with the sword, let out a small groan. He didn't take any damage, but a strange sensation flowed through the sword.

If it hits directly, his physical body will collapse. It was an instinctual premonition.

"It doesn't matter, though."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Acular's sword did not feel any intelligence.

Then, the way to break through was extremely simple. Taesan dug deeper into Acular's sword.

[You activated Limited Blink.]

Taesan moved behind Acular's sword. Acular's sword twisted its body and swung its sword. Taesan dodged by twisting his neck and thrust his sword deeply.

[You activated Plus.] [You activated Vital Point Designation.] [You activated Absolute Judgment.] [Acular's sword took 54,231 damage.]

Even without using the Soul's Blade or Transformation, the damage was extremely high.

Taesan gripped his sword tightly and thrust it even deeper. As it was an all-out attack, Taesan also exposed an opening.

Acular's sword did not miss that opening, which was exactly what Taesan had hoped for.

[You activated Selective Exclusion.]

Acular's sword's attack was erased.

It was rewound to before the attack. Acular's sword looked utterly bewildered.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Selection Exclusion. With Maria's authority, one of the opponent's attacks is selected and erased. The effect is almost identical to attack invalidation.

While Acular's sword was wavering, Taesan continued to thrust his sword towards the designated vital spot. Acular's sword, which had finally regained its senses, swung its great sword again.

But that too did not reach.

[Your first attack has been absolutely invalidated.]

Acular's sword returns to its state before the attack.

Taesan put even more strength into his sword.

The Lion King had fully understood Taesan's power.

If the Lion King had observed Taesan's battle, he would have analyzed and countered Taesan's abilities. However, he couldn't execute it due to a lack of power.

On the other hand, Acular's sword was clearly stronger than the Lion King, but it had lost its intelligence and reason, leaving only its instincts.

Taesan's ability shows almost absolute power under the assumption that the opponent is unaware of it. Especially against an enemy that charges in without reason, relying only on its instincts.

Acular's sword begins to rampage. The power of destruction spreads through the great sword, scattering like a whirlwind in all directions."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power to destroy everything that stands in the way. Even the leaders of the evil path cannot resist and will be annihilated.

But the current Taesan is strong.

Even if it's the will of the Transcender, the power of a tool like that can be overcome.

Taesan took a step forward and plunged his great sword downward.

[You have activated the Dash skill.]

Your body floated in the air. Using the dark magic, you strongly pressured your opponent. Acular's sword wielded the power of destruction, shattering and crushing everything, but Taesan was not one to let his guard down.

[You have activated the Call of Destruction skill.]

You immediately grasped the power of destruction.

The will to destroy the world itself. The intensity contained within was by no means low. In essence, it surpassed the power of mortality.

Acular's sword scattered the power of destruction in all directions, but the Call of Destruction devoured it greedily. Taesan aimed for the gap and pierced through the opponent's head.

Kaang!

He blocked the swung great sword and created distance.

"I made a mistake."

Taesan muttered to himself.

Originally, it wouldn't have ended at this level. To kill Taesan, Acular would have used an even stronger method."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, due to the intervention of the gods, interference beyond the established line became impossible. Thanks to that, Acular's sword was only using its limited power.

The sword pierced through the vital spot once again.

However, Acular's sword did not fall. With its initial and unchanged movement, it swung its great sword towards Taesan.

Taesan twisted the sword and pushed it away, dodging it.

"You're ridiculously tough."

Despite dealing damage in the millions, it did not fall. 

But it seemed to be reaching its limit. The lion king's form was crumbling.

Kwaduk.

At the same time, its power exploded.

As if it no longer needed to maintain its physical form, its body collapsed, and only its power was expressed.

Taesan sensed it. This was the end.

Then, he no longer needed to hold back his cards.

Taesan's sword created a boundary line, mixing the black and divine powers, with a grayish hue.

The distorted power of collapse rushed towards Taesan to devour him.

Taesan raised his sword and swung it towards the boundary line.

Kuuuuung!

The powers clashed. Taesan's eyebrows twitched. The power of collapse that collided with the boundary line did not easily back down.

That was the authority of the transcendent.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When I reached that level, I could even resist the boundary line.

Taesan pulled out even more of the black color. Now that I've reached immortality, I can handle it much more skillfully than before.

I unsheathe the sword with a grayish tint. The aftermath of the power alone shakes the labyrinth. I break through the collapsing power that's trying to devour Taesan and shatter it.

And so, Taesan reached the core of the collapse.

Taesan stabs the sword. The core lets out an even stronger power, as if it's screaming. Taesan responds in kind, pulling out even more of the black color.

As the grayish tint deepens, the collapse is consumed.

The power explodes, shaking the labyrinth.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The floor of the labyrinth shakes, and the walls crumble. Taesan has regained control of the sword. Only Taesan remains here.

[Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your spiritual power has increased, and you've obtained the special skill [Collapse].] [Your spiritual power has increased, and your physical strength has permanently...].

Taesan looks at the altar and opens his mouth.

"It's all over."

[…….]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

What Acularus felt on his altar was anger.

He had a strong will to kill Taesan. If an ordinary adventurer were to be exposed to that emotion, they would lose their life.

But that story didn't apply to Taesan. Taesan took it calmly.

Acularus didn't want to accept the result, but since the demon god was watching, he couldn't do anything more.

The demon god was the god of the demon world itself, the god of all demon tribes. He had immense power.

Acularus himself, as a transcender, had sufficient strength, but the demon god was an existence on the same level as Rakirates or Maria.

In the end, Acularus suppressed his anger and fulfilled his duty.

[Acularus's interference domain decreased.] [Acularus rewards you. You received the [Crumbling Helmet].] [You cleared the strengthened trial. Additional rewards followed.] [You obtained the [Necklace of the Jewel from the Crumbling Origin].]

Quest clear.

And that meant he had cleared the 80th floor.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[80th floor cleared.] [Obtained the Fragment of Collapse.] [Obtained ???.] [You have reached the 80th floor. Acquired the title [Deep Walker].] [You have perfectly cleared the 80th floor. Acquired the title [Ruler of the New Realm].] [You have perfectly cleared all floors up to the 80th floor. Acquired the title [Throne of the Deep].] [You have not only reached the depths but also achieved outstanding results. Your achievements are worthy of respect and admiration from all beings in the world. Acquired the title [Unyielding Body and Mind].] [The place you will go to next is where beings who have transcended mortality reside. They will show you direct interest and sometimes hostility. Acquired the special passive skill [Unwavering Heart].]

It's all over.

Taesan leaned against the wall of the ruined labyrinth, taking a break.

* * *

[Only one is left now.]

The guides of the sinful path, who had been fighting fiercely, were now down to just one.

The last one was the ash-colored woman, Sosiet. She was the ghost's target.

[I wonder where she's waiting. It's getting curious.]

Taesan opened his skill window.

[Special Active Skill: Collapse] [Mana consumption: 2,000] [Proficiency: 1%] [Destroys the object in contact with your weapon. If the user's strength is insufficient, it cannot be used properly. This skill can only be used once per battle.]

It was a skill similar to Maria's Selective Exclusion, approaching divine power. Even when Acular's sword used it, it had an effect on Taesan, who was protected by divine power. The skill's value seemed sufficient.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Helmet of Collapse] [Attack Power + 500] [Strength + 500] [Defense + 500] [A helmet that holds the power of collapse. If the user's strength and vitality are insufficient, it will collapse the user's body.] [Necklace of Collapse's Origin] [Health + 2,000] [Strength + 500] [Attack Power + 250] [Defense + 250] [Reduces all damage received by 10%.] [A necklace made from a gemstone obtained in a place where everything collapses, and is said to collapse the user's body if their strength and vitality are insufficient.]

There was a brutal description written on it. Taesan put on the equipment.

Then, a strange sensation enveloped Taesan.

It was a feeling as if his internal organs were being crushed, little by little.

"Whoa."

Taesan lightly exerted his strength. The power flowing from the equipment was neatly pushed back.

It wasn't a problem for Taesan. Judging by their performance alone, they were excellent items worthy of a divine reward.

[Title: Walker of the Deep] [Continues to prove his strength as he walks deeper.] [Health + 800] [Strength + 500] [Attack Power + 200] [Defense + 200]

The title itself hadn't changed much from before. The overall stats had increased, but that was all. The titles of the ruler of the new realm and the throne of the deep layer also raised the stats to high numbers.

The interesting part was the two things obtained afterwards."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Title: Unyielding Body and Mind] [A title given to those who delve deeper. Their body and mind have reached an extremely high level, making them unshakeable and as solid as a fortress.]

As I looked at the description, it seemed like a title that would transform me into a strong body and mind. But Taesan didn't feel any changes.

The passive skill was the same.

[Special Passive Skill: Unwavering Heart] [Proficiency: 100%] [When you face an existence that has surpassed mortality, your mind will not be shaken, and you will be able to withstand their pressure.]

The common point of the two skills was that they were skills for those who had surpassed mortality.

But Taesan had already reached immortality. Since he had already surpassed mortality, there was no reason for him to feel pressured when facing them.

The title "Unyielding Body and Mind" was the same. Since he had already surpassed his physical and mental limits, reaching a high level meant nothing.

"This is also a problem."

Indeed, after reaching immortality, various errors were occurring in many areas.

It was the moment when Taesan was about to check the last layer's clear reward.

Dudududuk."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The floor of the ruined labyrinth rose up. It was the appearance of Balbambara. He looked around, let out a small sigh, and said:

'[I'm going to have a hard time again.]'

'Sorry about that.'

'[At this point, this is the least troublesome thing you've done, so it's okay. Let's celebrate first. You've cleared the 80th floor. You're getting closer to the end of the labyrinth.]'

Balbambara said, looking at Taesan.

'[And the wizard has returned.]'

Balbambara had said that the wizard was absent when he met Taesan on the 79th floor.

'[He told me about you. So let's go see. Follow me, adventurer. The wizard wants to meet you again.]'"

Note: Balbambara and Taesan seem to be names of characters, and the wizard is another character mentioned in the story. The story appears to be set in a fantasy world with a labyrinth and magical elements.
