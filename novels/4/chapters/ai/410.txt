Chapter 411: The World of Halfra's Destruction (3)

Tai Shan was not only protecting his body with magic and black magic, but also with divine power.

However, the three catastrophic events that had descended upon the world were piercing through even his divine power and affecting his physical body.

If he didn't have the shield of Igi's, he would have died instantly from the overwhelming power.

Kugugukung...

The concrete cores of the three catastrophes were advancing towards the world.

Kiying!

The world did not retreat, but instead countered. It sent out a gemstone that had condensed the essence of the world, aiming at the concrete core.

The gemstone flew towards the concrete core and released its power.

Kugukung!

Wind, earth, fire, water, and all the elements that composed the world were swept away. It was not the end there. The powers that had burst forth continued to gather their strength, harmonizing with the world.

Everything in the world was gathering at this place.

Kakakak!
Here is the translation of the text:

As the power burst forth, the solidified fragments of the collapse began to distort. Although it was slowly advancing without being pushed back, the fragments of the collapse were trembling violently under the force of the world.

The world was gathering even more power.

Ku-kuk-kung.

A powerful fragment of the collapse shattered in all directions, filling the space with the natural force that obscured one's vision.

The world trembled with joy, its body quivering with excitement.

It had blocked the feeble external force. It was the master of this world, and no one could match it.

And then, in that instant...

Kwa-ddeok.

The scattered fragments of the collapse and natural debris were swallowed up, and the remaining two fragments of the collapse shot upwards.

The world was startled. It had clearly blocked the collapse. But what was this?

"I'm sorry, but I've only blocked one."

Tai-shan whispered calmly. The world was taken aback, subconsciously taking a step back.

If it were to be swallowed up, it would perish.

The world felt fear for the first time.

However, the world did not retreat.

It was the master of this world. This land, this realm, all belonged to it alone.

To run away from that external force in fear? The world's ego would not allow it.

All the power of the world converged, racing towards the collapse.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Kikiing!"

The unstoppable collapse came to a stop.

The world, seeing this sight, gathered its strength further.

Now, it had become impossible for the world to maintain itself as a world.

Kuguguk.

Despite this, the collapse began to move forward again.

It was like a press that slowly but surely crushed everything, heading towards the world. The world, in a desperate attempt, exerted all its strength, but was unable to stop the collapse.

The world thought of escaping belatedly.

However, it was already too late. The collapse had already reached the world's doorstep.

As the collapse engulfed the world, a massive explosion occurred.

* * *

The two collapse bodies brought about a massive explosion.

As the collapse's strength was met, Tai Shan took out his shield.

[You activated the shield of Igis.]

For one second, you were immune to all damage. As the shield was activated, the collapse engulfed Tai Shan.

"Ah."

Despite being in an immune state, a sense of pressure was felt. The vision turned black. The only thing felt was the power of collapse.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the blink of an eye, destruction did not cease. Tai Shan wrapped his body with sacred energy and used magic and dark magic.

Cuguuguung!

However, it was not effective.

[You take 21,230 damage.] [You take 11,212 damage.] [You take 14,543 damage.]

Tai Shan's vitality was exhausted by more than half in an instant. Despite being nothing but a side effect, the damage was immense. Tai Shan judged that he couldn't defend against this with his own strength and grasped his sword.

The sword became a mixture of black and gold, turning into a grayish color.

Tai Shan activated the boundary line and swung it down.

Kwaga ga gang!

The power of destruction was scattered in all directions, fragmented by the grayish color.

"This is a monstrous power."

Tai Shan needs to master the boundary line to defend against the side effects. Even the ghost was shocked.

"...I also thought it was possible to copy high-level magic skills like this."

"I didn't expect it to turn out like this."

Tai Shan was always thinking.

A skill that doubles the results of actions. Copy.
Here is the translation of the text:

In his past life, he could only increase damage by copying. He couldn't possess skills like magic because of that.

However, things are different now.

He has obtained various powers, including magic, dark magic, and black magic.

So, what if he copies those powers?

At first, Taesan tried to copy the boundary or black magic.

But those two were impossible.

Copying itself was possible, but Taesan couldn't handle the increased power.

He couldn't use copying well because he couldn't fully control it.

But magic was different.

Magic was a power that Taesan had obtained from the god of magic, and he could fully control it.

So, copying was also possible for him.

However, there was a problem. There was no need to use copying because it was not worth it. It was better to copy the attack and increase damage to twice the original.

That's why Taesan has been dealing with copying in a way that increases damage.

However, the Great Destruction is a high-level magic.

The power contained within it is a power that approaches the law.

And it was a power that Taesan received directly from the god of magic, under his control.
Here is the translation of the text:

Then, it seemed possible to copy the collapse. It was a judgment close to certainty, and it actually turned out to be possible.

And the result unfolded right before my eyes.

The world had collapsed.

The sky, the earth, and the ground, down to the deepest depths, everything was collapsing and twisting.

Space was distorted, and matter had lost its original shape, melting away like wax.

The very concept of the world was collapsing.

"Good."

A smile crept onto the face of the Taesan.

Now, it was not just a simple copy-and-paste, but dealing with the original effect. The Taesan was satisfied with that fact.

The Taesan took a step forward. In the collapsed world, there was nothing that was intact.

"It hasn't been destroyed."

The appearance of the world below the collapsed ground surface was revealed.

Had it succeeded in defense, the world was struggling to rise again.

However, it was a pitiful sight. It was as if the world's power had melted away, like a withered leaf. The strong, formidable world's power had dwindled to a mere shadow.

"I'll make it comfortable."

The Taesan drew his sword.

The world, which had been staring blankly at the Taesan, burst into anger, pouring out its strength.

The Taesan responded.

Gugu-gung!
Here is the translation of the text:

The power of nature bursts forth. Tai Shan has also consumed quite a bit. The consumption of mana for the destruction of the world is immense, and despite having high intelligence, it has not decreased much. Mana is almost depleted, and physical strength has greatly decreased.

However, the world is already on the brink of collapse.

[You have activated the "Overwhelm" ability.]

You move the sword to direct the bursting power and use it to overwhelm the world, moving it backward.

[You have activated the "Asmodeus's Corrupting Chain" ability.]

You bind the world with black magic, extending your hand to it.

[You have activated the "Despair's Branch" ability.]

Despairing emotions spread throughout the world's mind.

Tai Shan continues to channel his strength into the sword, imbuing it with a faint light and striking it with great force.

[You have activated the "Addition" ability.] [You have activated the "Sword of Unyielding Spirit" ability.] [167,544 damage to the world.]

The faint light turned the world upside down. Although the world tried to withstand by gathering all its strength, it was ultimately overwhelmed. As the world collapsed, the power contained within it scattered.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your prestige has been triggered.] [The proficiency of the concept skill [Willpower ???] has increased by 25%.] [The concept skill [Willpower ???] has evolved into the concept skill [Universal Will].] [Your prestige has been triggered. The proficiency of the incantation has increased by 5%.] [You have killed the world. You have obtained the special permanent skill [World Killer].] [You have obtained the world's core.]

At the same time, the world changes.

The air, which had been filled with poison and aimed at living beings, slowly subsides. The withered earth turns to dust and scatters in the air. The dark gray sky slowly collapses.

As the ruler of the world falls, this world has become a dead world.

"It's over faster than I thought."

The world of Half-Ran was never weak.

The world, which had been handling the mysterious blue orb, had counteracted the catastrophic collapse caused by the magic accumulation to a certain extent.

However, from the perspective of combat, the world was too weak.

If it could have made a spatial leap, it would have needed to handle it more freely. If it had kept a safe distance from the beginning and pressured the enemy, and then jumped again when the enemy approached, it would have been a tough fight.

But the world did not fight in that way. Instead, it stubbornly insisted on a frontal attack and failed to fully utilize its strengths.

The reason is clear. The world was the world, literally. The ruler of this world.
Here is the translation of the text:

"As the world was destroyed, no one could have resisted. Since I've never fought against an opponent of the same level, the battle was bound to be futile.

That's it, I suppose.

I felt a strange sensation all over my body, probably because I obtained a new skill through ascension. However, there was something that had to be done first. Tai Shan returned to the labyrinth.

"Already?"

Halfdan's eyes widened. Tai Shan nodded.

"It's all over."

"...I'll move together with you. Let's confirm it."

Halfdan pulled out a black gem from his pocket. Tai Shan and Halfdan's bodies moved together to the world that had been destroyed.

"Ah."

Having arrived in his own world, Halfdan laughed mockingly.

Dead air. The earth crumbled into dust. The sky was crumbling.

"Really, I've fallen. Then, did I find what I said?"

"It's what you're saying."

Tai Shan handed him the will of the world.

It was a bright blue gem.

[The Core of the World] [Everything in the world. This small gem contains the world itself.]

With trembling hands, Halfdan received the gem and unleashed his power."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Haha! Good! It's perfect! Finally! Finally! I can achieve my dream!"

In a dying world, only Halfaran's laughter echoed.

[Sub-quest completed.]

* * *

Halfaran's laughter gradually subsided after a while. He tightly grasped the core of the world.

"Good. There's no more business here. Let's leave."

"What about the other materials?"

This is Halfaran's world. There were many useful materials here. However, Halfaran shook his head.

"If our goal was to conquer the world, we could have taken them. But our goal was to crush the world's will. Now, this world is dead."

The planet itself was rapidly cooling. Looking up at the sky, the atmosphere was rapidly disappearing.

Sooner or later, this place will become a giant rock abandoned in space.

"If the world dies, so will everything inside it. No matter how hard we try to gather them, we'll exhaust our strength before we can make them into equipment."

Ultimately, we had to give up on the many materials here.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although it was a pity, it wasn't a major problem. After all, it was equipment that could be made using materials available in this world, so it wasn't something that would impress the current Taishan.

They left the dying world behind and returned to the labyrinth.

Halfdan fondled the gemstone with a happy face.

"I've always wanted to create exceptional equipment. Equipment that is flawless, beyond reproach, and beyond the reach of ordinary people. If I have this, I can create equipment that transcends mortality with your help."

He chuckled.

"You said you wanted to combine the twin rings I made into one. Take out the other materials, too."

"Here."

Taishan took out the materials one by one.

The fragments of will, the essence of the world, the crystallized blood, the battle scar, and the shattered reality.

It had been a long time since I obtained these, but due to lack of ability, I couldn't process the materials.

"Can you make the twin rings into one using these?"
