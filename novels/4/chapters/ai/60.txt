61. First Return. First Wave (2)

"Duel?"

"It's a basic skill. You should be able to use it too, right?"

"It wasn't listed in my skills..."

"There are a few skills that aren't listed. Dueling is one of them."

"You seem to know a lot."

Kang Junhyuk murmured in admiration, his face filled with awe. Itaeyeon smirked.

"What kind of skill is it?"

"A skill where two people can duel. No one except the participants can interfere, excluding quantum. It can only be accepted if the other side agrees."

Taesan pointed his sword towards Kang Junhyuk.

"So if you accept, it means we'll have our own fight."

"Um..."

Kang Junhyuk withdrew with a troubled expression.

"Wouldn't it be meaningless for me to fight with you?"

The difference in their stats is too great. He wouldn't be able to learn anything from fighting in his current state where he couldn't even keep up with Kang Taesan's movements.

"That's why there's a sentence after that, right?"

Taesan remarked casually.
"In a quantum-equivalent state, the duel takes place. It's a duel where everything—stats, attack power, defense—is adjusted to match the weaker opponent. In this fight, you and I are equals."

"What about skills?"

"We won't use activation skills."

It's not perfect equality, but it's nearly the same conditions. The only differences are in experience and skill.

"You don't have the right to refuse. Accept it."

"Well, okay."

Kang Junhyuk accepted with shining eyes.

[Duel initiated.] [Kang Junhyuk and Kang Taesan begin their duel.]

"But can you die in this?"

"In a normal duel, you could die, but this is a conditional duel. Even if your health depletes, you won't die."

"That's good."

Kang Junhyuk steadied his breathing and drew his sword. He took his stance and aimed at Taesan.

"If our stats are similar, I have a good chance."

Taesan is monstrously strong. It's not just high stats and numerous skills; his sense and movement are exceptional as well.

But Kang Junhyuk isn't bad either. No, he considered himself more than adequate. His confidence had grown stronger as he navigated through the labyrinth.

In this duel, he intended to prove to Taesan that he isn't weak, that he is sufficiently strong. Kang Junhyuk saw this as an opportunity, and his determination showed on his face.
Taesan smirked inwardly as he saw Kang Junhyuk's excited expression.

"I'm coming."

As Itaeyeon blankly watched, Kang Junhyuk dashed forward confidently. He swiftly swung his sword down.

It was a decent move. At this level, he shouldn't lose to a player with similar stats.

Taesan moved his sword.

Clang.

The swords clashed. Taesan flicked his wrist. His sword grazed Kang Junhyuk's blade smoothly, leaving a scratch.

A cut appeared on Kang Junhyuk's forearm.

"[Kang Junhyuk receives 8 damage.]"

"...Huh?"

Kang Junhyuk paused. He looked down at his forearm. A fairly deep wound had opened up, blood trickling down.

"W-what?"

"Keep going."

Taesan moved his sword again. Kang Junhyuk, still in a daze, hurriedly blocked. Their blades collided.

Taesan pulled his wrist back. Their swords parted. As the sword tip emerged, he immediately thrust forward.

Thunk.

Kang Junhyuk's shoulder was pierced.

"Aren't you going to block?"

Taesan lazily remarked as he moved his body. Kang Junhyuk's expression hardened. He gritted his teeth, sharpening his senses and preparing to defend himself with his whole body.
Clang.

But he couldn't block it.

As if alive, the sword disregarded Kang Junhyuk's defense and slashed through. In an instant, large and small wounds appeared all over his body.

"W-what...?"

Kang Junhyuk couldn't accept it.

Their stats were supposed to be equal. He should have been able to block the first attack without any problem.

However, he couldn't block any subsequent attacks at all.

No matter how hard he concentrated and tried to block, the sword blade was slicing through his flesh.

"Why is there such a difference...?"

"Stats and skills aren't everything."

Taesan drew a diagonal line. Kang Junhyuk hurriedly blocked. At the moment their blades clashed, Taesan lowered his stance and thrust downward towards Kang Junhyuk's lower body.

As Kang Junhyuk moved, Taesan's sword smoothly grazed past Kang Junhyuk's sword and cut his thigh.

"You're weak."

Kang Junhyuk gritted his teeth.

As he attempted to kick Taesan away, Taesan stepped on his knee to block him. Quickly, he grabbed Kang Junhyuk's wrist as he tried to swing at him, then tripped him up and brought him down.

Taesan swung his sword down.

Crack.
Kang Junhyuk swung his sword fiercely at the ground right beside Taesan's face.

Drawing his sword, Taesan spoke lazily,

"Sensitivity, judgment, exploiting momentary weaknesses. Such physical elements can create significant differences. You're not weak, but still lacking too much. You're not yet capable of surviving in Alone Mode. Moreover, you haven't even properly mastered your stats."

They gained power beyond human limits through stats. They had trained to wield power that could break the ground and explode the sea.

Since they hadn't trained to make the power their own, they couldn't help being inexperienced in transmitting strength and movement.

They could control their bodies perfectly only through endless physical training, but Kang Junhyuk had not undergone any special training.

"Even so, such a difference just from that..."

"It's not just from that. It's a very big difference."

Taesan brushed Kang Junhyuk away. Kang Junhyuk groaned, clutching his stomach.

"It's not over yet. Get up."

With a flushed face, Kang Junhyuk gripped his sword.

Thirty minutes later, Kang Junhyuk, reduced to a ragged mop, collapsed.

[Victory for Kang Taesan.]
"Do you have a sense of it now? What level you're at."

"Yes. It's damn frustrating."

Kang Junhyuk spat out in a weary voice.

He hadn't dealt a single point of damage.

All his attacks were blocked, and he took every one of Taesan's attacks head-on.

His confidence shattered, replaced by self-doubt.

"Compared to the named ones in the Labyrinth, I'm not that outstanding."

Taesan won against them based on skill and information, not by overwhelming them with moves.

"Confidence is good. But maintain that line. With your current self, you wouldn't even pass the trial of the 2nd floor's Laki Lataus, let alone what awaits ahead."

Seeing oneself objectively. It's essential for survival.

Kang Junhyuk was done. Taesan pointed towards Itaeyeon. She, who had been watching absentmindedly, startled.

"Wow."

"..."

She approached hesitantly, her expression troubled.

[Duel challenge. This duel is conducted on equal terms.] [Duel begins.] [Itaeyeon and Taesan start their duel.]
"I don't need to do this. I know well enough that I'm weak, so I don't think I'll ever cross that line."

"It's the other side that's the problem. You lack confidence."

Itaeyeon and Kang Junhyuk had similar skills but opposite issues.

Itaeyeon was timid.

That's an undeniable truth. Thanks to that, she survived until the end, but conversely, she gave up everything she could have achieved.

Her personality suppressed her potential. Taesan approached readily and swung his sword down. Itaeyeon screamed as she blocked.

"Respond!"

"Hiieeeek!"

She frantically blocked Taesan's sword with erratic movements. Her face showed no trace of calm, but her movements were efficient. Even a slight hesitation would have been exploited, but she somehow managed to block.

In an instant, Taesan pushed forward and grabbed her wrist, spinning and throwing her.

"Whoa!"

She flew and sprawled on the ground as Taesan turned his wrist.

"How about that?"

"Wow..."

---

This passage seems to depict a tense combat scenario between Itaeyeon and Taesan, highlighting their contrasting personalities and combat styles.
Itaeyeon shakes off the dust and staggers. She looks down at her hand with a strange expression.

She managed movements she didn't think she could do.

"You're not as weak as you think."

If she had only been a coward, she wouldn't have cleared it. There is a possibility that she could become stronger than her previous self.

"Of course, confidence is good, but don't be too reckless. If it doesn't feel right instinctively, you have to withdraw immediately. There's no one right answer."

Taesan. Even he had to rely on instinct when pushing through with the odds against him.

What he taught was how to increase the chances of survival and become stronger.

After finishing his rough instructions, Taesan began sharing information.

"You guys haven't started using feints and counters yet, have you? Maybe you haven't had the luxury until now, but it's time to learn. Skills that you use all the way to the end, depending on how you use them."

Along with skills, he teaches how to survive. He imparts basic information, not revealing perfect responses but providing fundamental hints. Kang Junhyuk and Itaeyeon both listen intently with serious expressions.

"That's it for now. You can pass this on to the others."

"...Thank you."
Kang Junhyuk expresses his gratitude with a serious face.

"I'll tell you after we survive until the end. Both you and Itaeyeon. Don't die."

His words are calm yet earnest.

Both Kang Junhyuk and Itaeyeon look slightly moved as they gaze at Taesan. Taesan flinches.

"Why are you looking at me like that?"

"Oh, no reason. It's just unexpectedly warm words... I thought you were much more cold-hearted."

"Would a cold-hearted guy share information with you guys?"

"Haha."

Kang Junhyuk scratches his head. It wasn't the information but the usual tone and indifferent attitude that made him think so.

And Taesan himself hadn't realized that.

To him, they were all once dead. And most of them would end up dead.

No matter how hard he tried to save them, it wouldn't change. Players like Iji and Normal Mode would die just from the aftermath of battles. It was an unconscious attitude of not showing emotions from the beginning.

Itaeyeon changed the subject.

"But what's happening inside?"

Six hours have already passed. In another six hours, the wave starts.

"I don't know. We'll have to go in to find out."

Taesan stood up indifferently.
* * *

"Huu."

Kim Hwiyeon rubbed her head as if she had a headache. Depending on the importance of her role, she even received a private cell, but she wanted to let go of everything.

"This is driving me crazy...."

"What happened?"

She quickly turned around at the voice behind her. Swallowing her saliva, she smiled.

"When did you come in?"

"It's better to keep the windows closed. If your stats are high, you can just break through."

Taesan stood by the window and looked at her.

"I see."

Hwiyeon murmured softly.

She was slightly embarrassed by Taesan.

She didn't have hostility towards him, and she knew he wasn't a bad person, but his indifferent attitude and his calmness in killing people scared her a little.

She hid her emotions and spoke. She knew Taesan could see that attitude, but she didn't point it out.

"First, they said they were coming in your direction, so I'm planning to divide and deploy. Some people resisted and asked why I had to do that, but what could I do? Eventually, they complied."

"Blocking from inside?"


"No."

Hwiyeon shook her head.

"I think it's best to block from the outside, so I'll go out before starting the quest."

Wave. She didn't know what it was exactly, but judging from the tone, it meant enemies were attacking.

Inside the City Hall, it was cramped for ten thousand people to move. Rather than that, she thought it would be better to go outside and respond in a wider space.

And that turned out to be the right answer. Hwiyeon had arranged things like this in her previous world as well. Thanks to that, quite a few people had survived.

"About ten thousand survived."

It was a decent survival rate. Taesan spoke.

"I'll take care of one direction."

"Excuse me?"

"I'll handle it. Redirect that group to somewhere else."

"Um, are you sure you're okay?"

"I'm saying I'm okay."

A moment of complex emotions flickered across Hwiyeon's face. She silently nodded her head.

"Thank you. ...Thank you very much."

"Let's meet again, alive."

Time passed.
People waited without speaking. Some bit their lips, others gnawed at their fingernails. There were those who were glowing, but they were quickly subdued.

Six hours passed like that.

Monsters appeared.

Seeing them approach from the horizon, Taesan gripped his sword.
