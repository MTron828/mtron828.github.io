**Chapter 534**

534. 95th Floor. Essence (8)

[Transcendence: Physical Strength] [Proficiency: 100%] [Master of Physical Strength itself. The universe's physical strength is under your control. You can directly intervene in the concept of physics, amplify, control, and manipulate it. The effect of your power changes according to your abilities.] [Hoo…….]

Bardley, who read the skill description, couldn't help but let out a sigh of amazement. Unlike the descriptions of spiritual invasion or boundaries, this was an explanation that could be understood immediately, and therefore, he could appreciate the value of the power more than anything.

Now, physical strength can no longer have any influence on Taesan.

Even if you were to attack the planet itself, or gather all the physical strength in the universe to attack, it would be possible to make it all disappear with a light flick of Taesan's wrist.

No. Beyond simply erasing it, it would be possible to reverse that power and strike back at the opponent with the same force.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a natural thing to happen. Because Taesan controlled the physical force itself. Like other transcendents, Taesan could now exert an absolute influence on the concept of physical force.

"'Then... it's easy to deal with guys like that.'

"The World Destroyer.

"A giant physique that crushed the world itself. Its power heavily relied on physical force.

"Of course, the World Destroyer didn't follow the laws of this world, so its concept might be different, but Taesan was the same. If he utilized his boundaries, he could make the World Destroyer unable to land a hit on him.

"In fact, it could become an absolute superiority.

"It wasn't just a simple ability to eliminate physical force. He could directly intervene with the concept of physics and manipulate it.

"He could directly intervene with and control physical force.

"Then, Taesan raised his finger and lightly tapped the air.

"BOOOOOOM!

"A massive physical force was contained at the tip of his finger. The space was torn apart, and the shockwave swept through the labyrinth.

[You have activated the internal world.]

"Taesan activated his internal world, suppressing the influence of his power on the labyrinth. The rough physical force shook his internal world.

"KUUUUUUUUUUU..."]

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"His physical strength had finally stabilized.

Taesan wiggled his fingers.

"Is this the basic feeling?"

His physical strength itself had become incredibly high.

It was overwhelmingly superior to before. Even compared to a three-year-old child and a skilled martial artist, it was still lacking.

And with just a light wiggle of his fingers, he could bring out the physical strength that he could only achieve with all his might.

Taesan thought for a moment, then raised his hand.

And he snapped his fingers. The five fingers moved smoothly back and forth.

Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

And every time he moved his fingers, a massive physical strength shook the space and sent out shockwaves.

His entire power was contained in a single finger movement.

"This is... okay."

Taesan had a pleased expression.

No matter how strong he became, if he wanted to attack with all his might, he would have to step forward, move his waist, and swing his arms widely. Not only did this series of movements take a considerable amount of time, but he also needed a platform to exert his strength.

This was an unavoidable and natural movement for someone who controlled their body."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But the transcendent [physical power] made the entire process unnecessary.

It didn't even require fingers; just wiggling his toes was enough to unleash his full power.

Moreover, there was no delay or energy consumption in the process. It meant that he could apply pressure with his full power just by moving his fingers, as if he was right next to his opponent.

This alone was an effect close to the top among the skills he possessed. It was only natural, given his authority.

But that wasn't all.

If Taesan grasped several marbles and threw them, controlling the physical power, it was also possible to imbue them with his power. There was a possibility of that happening as well.

If he could control the concept of physical power itself, he could do even more diverse things.

"Is this also possible?"

Taesan cancelled the activation of his internal world and returned to the labyrinth. He clenched his fist and shook it.

A powerful attack infused with his power. This alone could collapse the layers.

Boom!

But his fist swung around, and nothing happened.

No physical power was released outward, and it was all concentrated in his fist.

"This control is also possible."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Compression of Physical Power.

By controlling the physical power that spreads out and naturally dissipates, without letting a single bit of it scatter, and containing it all in one fist.

Delivering 100% of one's power to the opponent. This way, one can handle physical power beyond their limits.

'Can it be used for multiplication as well?'

The power of multiplication would also become even stronger.

Without releasing the power of multiplication, I contain it in my sword and wield it.

Compressing all power into one sword, crushing everything that stands in the way, and advancing forward. This is not a one-time thing, but rather a sustained ability.

It wasn't an impossible story. Now that he has acquired the authority, it's possible that he can control the physical power of multiplication, and the possibility is sufficient.

'Not only that.'

One of the effects of authority. You can put your full power into every movement.

Then, if you use this authority to put your full power into every action, what would happen?

Lifting your feet, stepping on the ground, putting strength into your waist, gripping your sword, pulling your arm, and moving your fingers.

Putting your full power into each and every one of these, and using the authority to focus on a single attack..."

Note: The text appears to be describing a fictional ability or power that allows the user to compress and control their physical strength, and potentially use it for multiplication or other effects. The translation tries to convey the sense of excitement and possibility that the original text conveys.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What extent of power will it reach?"

"This is also curious."

It's not just this. He hasn't thought about it yet, or he can't control it perfectly, but there are many possibilities. The dominance over physical power itself was meant to be that kind of thing.

If he can just handle this one thing properly, he could have an equal fight with the great beings he's met so far.

"I can't handle everything right now."

He needed training and discipline to master the power itself. He had to learn how to properly wield the power over a long period of time, dedicating himself to it.

[But then, what should I call you?]

Bardley muttered in a puzzled tone. [God of Domination and Boundary, and Physical Power? Something's weird.]

The essence of handling the power of downfall was called the God of Downfall.

Rakiratas, who handled the power of struggle and death, was called the God of Struggle and Death. Then, it wouldn't be strange to call Taesan by a similar name, as Bardley said.

But Taesan denied it.

"That doesn't seem right. Can I be called a god?"

[That's... ambiguous.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"God is an existence within the concept of this world.

But Taesan was not. He was still stuck on the boundary.

That's why he became not a god, but something else.

[Boundary's Master] [The newly born ruler of the boundary. The boundary that exists because of you has finally gained its own self. It follows your orders and shows hostility towards your enemies.]

"Is this self?"

The beast's roar that I felt when I tried to hold it back. I felt the emotion of wanting to break free from Taesan's inside and reveal myself to the world.

The boundary itself had taken on a strange and powerful form.

As described, it seemed to be following Taesan's orders, but something felt uneasy. It was like trying to tame a beast that doesn't listen to words.

"I'll check it out properly later."

There was still one thing left.

The Savior.

To be honest, the boundary's master was predictable. The concept of the boundary itself had always been controlled by Taesan, and only he could control it, so it was natural.

But the Savior was something that even Taesan didn't expect.

[Savior] [ ]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"...Hmm?"

Taesan scrunched up his face.

There was no explanation. There was no writing about what this was, how it happened, or what kind of effect it had on Taesan.

"What is this?"

He expected something to be written like a boundary owner, but it was empty.

"Why?"

Several possibilities flashed through Taesan's mind.

Was it to fill in the empty space?

Or was it something that couldn't be expressed in the language of this world from the beginning? Considering that the Essential couldn't read it, it wasn't impossible.

He thought he needed to slowly figure it out himself.

He came to a certain conclusion, and Taesan let out a dry laugh.

In the end, he didn't find out anything for sure.

He was in a state where he couldn't understand it himself.

"A test is needed."

He couldn't come up with an answer on his own.

So, he needed an opponent.

An opponent who was equal to him, or even stronger.

An opponent who could bring out his full power and truly reveal the level he had reached.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But it was impossible to easily find such an opponent. Only a perfect transcender or a high-ranking noble could be a worthy opponent for Taesan.

"What should I do?"

Along with his thoughts, Taesan confirmed the clear reward.

[A stable, singular essence] [A pure essence in and of itself. By manipulating this, one can create something close to perfection.]

95th floor clear reward. It was a material item. Taesan, who had been gazing at the essence for a moment, clenched his fist.

Whoosh.

Perfectly controlled physical power manipulated the essence. It shook and controlled, recreating something new.

The labyrinth's system assisted Taesan's abilities, creating a piece of equipment.

The material in Taesan's hand took on a single form.

[You have obtained a ring made of physical essence.] [Ring of Physical Essence] [Attack Power +3000] [A being that governs the concept of physical power has created this ring by dominating the essence.]

"Good."

Now, as long as he had usable materials, Taesan could create equipment as he pleased. He had finally reached that level.

Attack Power 3000. It was an extremely high number. The??? reward was also a ring related to attack power.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I used it." "I obtained the ring created by the magician." "The ring created by the magician" "[Attack power +1500]" "[Defense power +2000]" "This is one of the first rings created by the magician when he made the labyrinth. Due to the balance of the labyrinth, it was sleeping, but now it has finally found its original owner."

"Attack power and defense power were attached. For the current Taesan, defense power became attack power. In fact, it was a ring with an attack power of 3500, which was not bad at all."

"A total increase of 6500 in attack power.

This was a huge gain for Taesan, who governs the concept of physical strength.

"It's ridiculous that the labyrinth's equipment still has an effect."

The system for the mortal had reached a transcendent level for Taesan, and it had significant value. It was not a small value, but a considerable one.

"It wouldn't have been possible originally. But thanks to Balbambara's strange gift, I didn't expect to become like this."

Someone responded to Taesan's muttering. The space split open, and a figure began to appear.

Taesan spoke calmly.

"Hello."

The magician who created the labyrinth appeared.

* * *

"I'm sorry for being late."

The magician looked exhausted, very much so.

He had the expression of a laborer worn out from the toil of life.

"You must be very busy."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's too big of an incident that suddenly exploded. I'm barely managing to keep it under control, but... it's impossible to completely suppress it."

He shook his head. His eyes had a quiet, cold anger.

"A dirty traitor is causing chaos."

"You're having a tough time."

"It seems like we both have a lot to talk about."

Taesan nodded his head.

He had reached a transcendent state.

It's hard to say he's reached it exactly, but it's similar, so it's not a problem.

Can he also descend into the labyrinth now?

The magician had said it was possible before, but that was before he reached transcendence, so it might be different now.

"I also have a lot to ask."

The magician's gaze at Taesan was very subtle.

Taesan, who had been looking at him for a moment, realized something.

He could understand the magician's level and power.

He was even able to read the emotions within him.

Inside the magician, there were emotions of admiration, surprise, and curiosity, as well as distrust and many others.

"But before that, there's something we need to resolve first."

"What is it?"

"The universe is shaking, and you're also involved in it."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The wizard said calmly.

"So, the gods of the universe are calling you. Gang Tae-san."

[The wizard's invitation.] [The Temple of All Gods is calling you.]
