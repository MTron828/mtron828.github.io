**Chapter 430**

430. The 84th Floor, Levienov's World (3)

"'Considering I was expelled, I've come out too much.'"

Taesan didn't show any surprise. The gods were revealing their ambitions in this world and were trying to cross over somehow.

If the transcendents had really perfectly expelled the gods, they wouldn't be able to appear in this world, or they would have a hard time chasing them away.

But they needed Taesan's help.

It meant that the gods' power was growing stronger.

"There's nothing eternal in this world. Eventually, everything will fade away. Even the transcendents' seals won't be an exception."

The man wore a twisted smile.

"But they're different! Their power and dignity are eternal! Even the transcendents couldn't handle them and had to resort to expulsion as a temporary measure! This world belongs to them!"

A voice filled with conviction rang out loudly.

Taesan spoke in a low tone.

"You've sacrificed yourself for that, haven't you?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Don't you think it's more beneficial to worship eternal and unchanging beings rather than those that will eventually fade away?"

The man chuckled.

"Let's abandon this weak world and worship them instead. That's the right flow."

"If such great beings exist, then someone like me would be unnecessary."

Even if the current Taesan is strong, he's not at the level of an immortal. He can't reach the transcendent. From the outside, it seemed like there was no value in him that would catch the interest of the gods.

"I think so too, but their thoughts are different, it seems."

The man also opened his mouth with a puzzled expression.

"My master said so. You are the key. With you, many things are possible, he said."

The key.

It seemed that Taesan had something that was extremely attractive to the gods.

And it wasn't hard to figure out what that was.

'The Boundary.'

A power that mixed the sacred and the black, destroyed laws, and was beyond the understanding of even transcendent beings.

What the gods wanted from Taesan was precisely the Boundary.

"Come to me, Taesan."

The man stretched out his hand.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They will promise you eternity. If you want, they'll even give you a great throne."

"Is that all there is to it?"

"Of course not. If you desire, they won't touch your small world anymore. If you want, they'll even make the labyrinth your own possession. In the world they rule, everything you desire will come true."

The man whispered temptingly.

"Even if they rule the world, the world around you will remain the same. The people you know will live happily and die. Strangers you don't know are worthless, aren't they?"

"It sounds appealing."

There was no harm to Taesan and his surroundings. Only the unknown beings he didn't know suffered.

"If they're going to do all that, what about the condition that they shouldn't touch the transcenders?"

"No."

The man shook his head, speaking with firm denial.

"All existing transcenders will die. Their realm will be tainted, and their names will be erased from everyone's minds. That's one thing they'll never compromise on."

"The goal of the gods is, after all, the transcenders."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They only see mortals as toys, anyway. There's no reason to take them seriously."

Taesan stroked his chin. The man waited leisurely for Taesan's response.

After a moment, Taesan opened his mouth.

"Do you think I'd accept your proposal?"

"Don't be ridiculous. I'm not that foolish."

The man laughed mockingly.

"My master said so, so I made the proposal, but I know that in this world, I've reached immortality. Someone like you would never accept such a proposal."

"I know that well."

Lee Tae-yeon, Kang Joon-hyuk, Kim Jung-geun, and the people of Earth.

It was all Goshin who killed them.

"I don't think transcendents are particularly good. Most of them think of mortals as nothing more than entertainment. I won't deny that."

Taesan drew his sword.

"But that doesn't mean I have a reason to take your side."

From the beginning, Taesan's response was rejection. He had only been asking questions to gather information.

The goal of the Goshin was Taesan's boundary, and the death of all transcendents.

He had obtained enough information.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's right. So I'm worried now."

A fierce energy emanates from the man.

"You can't kill me. But someone like you won't surrender mentally either. So I'll make it simple."

The man lets out a dry laugh and moves his body. He grasps the hilt of the sword stuck in the temple floor.

"I'll make your mind a blank slate!"

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

As the man pulls out the sword, the temple begins to collapse. The ceiling, unable to withstand the force, crumbles, and the floor gives way.

Taesan quickly escapes outside the temple. The man is buried under the collapsed temple in an instant.

[It's not self-destruction... or not.]

Ku-gu-gung!

The collapsed temple slowly rises.

And it reveals its form.

In the man's hand is a sword. But it's not an ordinary sword.

The black sword, shaped like the Bastard Sword, pierces the sky.

Taesan has to tilt his head all the way back to see the sword's tip.

It's literally as massive as a mountain.

The man looks like an ant in comparison.

[... Wow.]

"Phew."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The man took a deep breath and grasped his sword. The enormous sword, as large as a mountain, moved smoothly in the man's hand.

"I am the avatar of the empty existence! I am the traitor who has joined hands with the gods and killed many immortals, destroying multiple worlds!"

The man laughed. It was a crazy, overflowing smile.

"I will grasp the world in my hand and wield it! Let's do it! I am the dog of the gods! I will be the cornerstone that announces the destruction of this wretched universe!"

[The opponent is an unbeatable enemy.]

The great sword cut through everything and swung towards the mountain.

[You have activated the "Sadohwa" (Corrupted Chaos).] [You have activated the "King's Vessel".] [Your enemy's god has been activated.]

.

.

.

Numerous activation windows filled the view. The mountain flew towards the sword.

* * *

The flying great sword created a massive storm by itself.

The mountain did not back down. Instead, it charged towards the great sword.

[You have activated acceleration.] [You have activated a powerful strike.]

With both hands strengthened, he swung the great sword.

KA-BOOM!

A deafening sound echoed.

And the one who was blown away was the mountain.

Note: "Sadohwa" () is a Korean term that can be translated to "Corrupted Chaos" or "Tainted Turmoil". It seems to be a special ability or power in the context of the story.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not that I'm being pushed back, but rather, I'm unable to withstand the force and my body is sent flying.

[You have activated your landing skill.]

With a tremendous force, my body is forcibly brought back down to the ground, and I dig my feet deep into the earth to steady myself.

Quadruple impact!

The ground cracks and splits apart, collapsing like an earthquake.

"It's a monster."

Taesan has given up on the idea of facing it head-on, realizing that even with his stats rivaling those of a mountain, he's no match for its power.

A gigantic sword, as massive as a mountain.

It's not that I can wield it, but rather, I feel like I'll be overwhelmed by its size.

How far can I go with this?

[You have activated your perfect fairy's wings.]

Taesan's body takes to the sky, accelerating rapidly as he approaches the man.

"Hmph!"

The man chuckles and moves his wrist slightly.

A very small, almost imperceptible movement.

But that alone is enough to alter the trajectory of the great sword.

The sword swings towards Taesan, who is flying in the air, with precision. Although he narrowly avoids it, he won't be able to hold out for long."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The great sword was enormous. But to put it another way, if you could get inside the great sword's reach, it would be easier to deal with.

It accelerated the movement of its entire body. The great sword smoothly chased after the mountain, guiding it to a hair's breadth distance before leaping through space.

[You activated a limited blink.]

The mountain suddenly drew close to the man.

In that state, it activated a landing and arrived right in front of the man's nose.

The man sneered and moved his arm.

Ka-ga-gak!

The man blocked all of the mountain's attacks with just the sword hilt.

"Everyone thought my weakness was close combat. But from my perspective, it's actually a blessing."

Thanks to the size of the sword, the hilt was also as long as a decent spear. The man roughly pushed the mountain back and turned his sword around. He used the sword's surface to try and knock the mountain down.

[You activated designated mark acceleration.]

In the end, the mountain didn't gain any significant advantage and created some distance.

But the size of the great sword was like a mountain.

In reality, it was impossible to create distance.

The mountain changed its strategy. Instead of evading and defending, it would launch a barrage of attacks.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the Frozen World.] [You have activated the Mana Storm.] [You have activated the Great Collapse.] [You have activated Marbas's Dark Wave.]

Magic and dark magic are being implemented in succession. Taesan has clenched his fist.

[You have activated Magic Separation.]

The magics are branching out in dozens of directions.

[You have activated Certain Hit.] [You have activated Skill Acceleration.]

And with that, he charges straight at the man.

It's literally a power that's pouring down from all directions.

The man reveals this and pulls his arm back.

The atmosphere distorts. The sky begins to tremble anxiously.

The man swings his pulled-back arm.

The great sword sweeps across the entire front.

As a result, the atmosphere explodes. The blackness contained in the sword sweeps across in all directions, trampling all of Taesan's skills and charging towards him.

There was no room to dodge. It was like the explosive power of a sun burning the earth's surface.

It could be blocked, but it would require consuming a considerable amount of energy.

Taesan quickly makes a judgment and gives up on evasion and defense.

[Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.]

The attack is erased.

The man is amazed.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You have an amazing ability. But if that's all, you'll never be able to beat me!"

"It seems that way."

Taesan nodded his head.

He couldn't deny it.

The man was undoubtedly stronger than Taesan.

In terms of level, he seemed to be on par with Ainshar.

He was handling the great sword with perfect mastery, as if it were his own limb. If it were just a matter of physical strength, it wouldn't be difficult to deal with, but the sword contained the man's dignity. Perhaps the sword itself held the power of the man's immortality.

That wasn't the end of it. The great destruction was a high-level magic. Even Ainshar wouldn't be able to easily block it, but the man blocked it with ease.

The reason was simple. The great sword contained blackness.

"It's similar to the magic of denial."

Absolute superiority over all attributes.

Unfortunately, Taesan couldn't use the magic of denial now. He had consumed all the materials needed for partial world transformation.

The chances of winning seemed very low.

If the man swung his great sword with full force, Taesan would be defeated without being able to do anything. Both the man and Taesan knew that fact.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They abandoned you. They're foolish beings. They don't know your worth, and they're throwing you away like this. What's the point of risking your life to fight for such beings?"

The man grasped his great sword.

According to Taesan's response, he seemed ready to strike at any moment.

"It's not too late. I'll be with my master from now on."

"No."

Taesan replied, his answer firm and unwavering.

"Unfortunately, I seem to be quite different from you."

The man said that he had almost lost everything due to the transcendent being's prank, but Goshin had saved them.

Taesan was the opposite. Taesan was put into easy mode, and it was Goshin who almost killed him.

And the beings who cherished Taesan and granted him power were the transcendent beings.

They bestowed their blessings upon Taesan.

Taesan prayed to them in his heart, and the gods responded to his prayer.

[Rakiratas has bestowed upon you the owner of the crying struggle.]

It was Rakiratas' blessing.

It was his authority.

The struggle itself was embedded in Taesan's body. The man's pupils grew larger.

"Rakiratas' blessing?"

A blessing is a power granted by the gods.

It consumes the transcendent being's interference domain.

Note: The translation may not be perfect, and some nuances may be lost in translation.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The transcendent being is extremely selfish. It never does anything that would consume its own domain. Very rarely, it would occasionally bestow its blessings upon its apostles. Even that was extremely rare.

Therefore, the man couldn't help but be astonished.

Taesan didn't seem like an apostle of Rakiratas. It was unthinkable that a god would bestow its blessings upon someone unrelated to itself.

'...It seems like I've offered a lot of tributes.'

After much contemplation, the man came to a conclusion.

He offered all sorts of tributes to Rakiratas and barely managed to receive its blessings. The man came to that conclusion.

'But one blessing alone cannot reach me.'

'I know.'

The god's blessing was certainly great, but the difference between the man and Taesan was even greater.

And the blessings Taesan received were not just one.

[Maria has given you an unchanging choice.]

The blessing of Maria, the goddess of choice.

[Zerban has given you the fundamental elements of the universe.]

The blessing of Zerban, the god of magic.

[Lucifer has given you a precious child of darkness.]

The blessing of Lucifer, the demon god.

[Ehil has given you the master of the sword.]

The blessing of Ehil, the god of the sword."

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Aphrodia has bestowed upon you a desperate despair that has driven you into darkness.] [Baltazar has bestowed upon you a victorious fate that will grasp victory.] [Oman has bestowed upon you an infinite trial.]

Countless blessings are being bestowed upon you. The man stared blankly at the sight, unable to even think of attacking during the brief moment of blessing.

"Why do the gods...”

"They are fond of me, unlike you."

[The labyrinth's wizard has bestowed upon you the labyrinth's blessing.]

Finally, the labyrinth's wizard's blessing takes hold.

"Phew."

Taesan took a deep breath.

The gods' blessings dominate his entire body. His strength and vigor have reached an unprecedented level, surpassing even the peak of his abilities.

"Let's try it once more."
