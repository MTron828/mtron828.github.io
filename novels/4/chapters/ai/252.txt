Chapter 253

253. The Underworld (2)

“Uh…….”

Her long, curly hair, which reached down to her waist, was shaking.

Her eyes darted back and forth, unable to find their way.

Aren was a little more grown up than Tai Shan's memory.

Although not much time had passed, she seemed to have matured in a peculiar way due to the many events that had occurred.

“Is that the person the Lord of the Underworld spoke of? Tai Shan himself?”

“Ah, you two know each other?”

Quanede asked in surprise, and Aren looked around nervously.

“Ah, how did you find out? Did the Lord of the Underworld send a trial to make you realize it?”

“Quanede, don't you know Tai Shan too?”

“Yes.”

Quanede nodded positively.

“I told you before. There was someone who saved me from the labyrinth. That was Tai Shan.”

“Uh…….”

Aren suddenly realized how she was related to Tai Shan. Quanede was shocked and amazed.

“Tai Shan is the person the princess spoke of. Ah, then…….”

“Qu, Quanede. Be quiet.”

Aネット샤 hurriedly blocked Conor's words.

She took a deep breath and calmed down her mind.

"Lord Taesan... it's been a long time."

"Yes."

"I'm glad to see you."

She bowed her head respectfully.

In her eyes, which were filled with confusion, joy was visible.

* * *

Aネットシャ seemed to have a lot to say to Taesan.

However, she restrained herself. She pressed down her desires and sat down opposite him, saying:

"Shall we exchange information first? Lord Taesan, you came to the mortal realm on a mission from Marishin, didn't you?"

Taesan nodded his head.

"And that mission is to deal with those who believe in the old Marishin."

"Do you know?"

"Marishin appeared to us in a dream yesterday and told us about it."

"Yesterday?"

Aネットシャ nodded affirmatively.

"Yes, yesterday."

If it was yesterday, then Taesan had not received Marishin's quest yet.

Marishin did not think that Taesan would refuse the quest.

"Go on."

"Marishin said that a helper would come, and we are the helpers."

She pointed to Conor. Conor smiled and raised his hand.

"The Well-Being."

Tae-san gazed at Kwaneud.

"You're weaker now."

From the moment he was first seen, Kwaneud was a strong adventurer who could descend from over 50 floors.

However, Kwaneud's strength is now only at the level of 20 floors. Although he appears incredibly powerful to outsiders, he seems pitiful when compared to the strength he once had.

"There's no way. You helped me break Petricia's contract, but in the process, I lost my strength. The mastermind behind it all said it was impossible to recover, so I had no choice."

"...".

Tae-san was able to guess the reason.

Breaking Petricia's contract was a form of ascension.

In other words, Tae-san had taken away some of Kwaneud's strength.

It seemed that Kwaneud had lost his strength as a result of this backlash.

"It feels like I'm sorry about it."

His strength, which was once 50 floors, had dwindled to 20 floors. It was a mentally heavy burden.

However, Kwaneud seemed to take it calmly.

"It's a pity, but it's not bad. Living peacefully like this is also good, I think."
Here is the translation of the text:

As Quanecdw thought, he was looking for someone who would acknowledge himself. Therefore, he was entangled in a contract that was as useless as a guide's words.

At that time, Mashin took care of him directly and met Annetsha. Annetsha's personality was not bad, so he wouldn't treat him poorly.

Since he didn't rely on strength, the current situation seemed satisfactory.

"'Even if I'm weak, I can still be at the same level as the demons in the Underworld. Don't worry, I can take care of myself.'"

"'Annetsha, are you worried?'"

"'You don't have to worry.'"

Annetsha spoke calmly.

"'The powerlessness I felt back then has become a bone-deep feeling, and I've grown stronger. Without Master Taiyuan's help, there won't be any problems.'"

In reality, Annetsha's aura felt significantly stronger than when I last saw him.

While it's hard to achieve significant results in a labyrinth, he seemed to be able to take care of himself.

"'Those who believe in the old Mashin... there have been stories about them for a long time.'"

Annetsha continued his words like a folk tale.
Here is the translation of the text:

"A long time ago, there was a cruel demon. A young girl who couldn't tolerate his tyranny led the demon clans and chased him away, and she herself became a demon. As a result, the old demon was banished from the underworld. However, there were still those who believed in the old demon and they did not disappear. They lived on abandoned land, waiting for their lord to return.

"'Abandoned land?'"

"There's a place in the underworld where demons cannot live."

Quaned said.

"A twisted place, and a place where strange things exist. A place sealed off from us. It's said that the old story is living there."

Tae-san guessed where the place was.

The demon said that he couldn't completely chase away the power of the old demon during the banishment process.

It seemed that the space where the power of the old demon remained was called the abandoned land.

"'Let's go there first. Where is it?'"

"It's beyond the castle of the demon king."

"'The castle of the demon king?'"

Tae-san's eyes sparkled. Annetsha nodded her head.

"It's beyond the castle of the demon king. Sealed off at the northern end. That's the abandoned land."

* * *

After the destination was decided, they began to prepare to leave. Annetsha and Quaned gathered the elderly people of the village and talked about various things, while Tae-san waited at a distance for the conversation to end.

"'Demon king.'"

Tae-san muttered to himself with expectation.

The world of the spirits said that the demon king had destroyed it.

If it was strong enough to destroy the world, it must be very powerful."
Here is the translation of the text:

And this place is the Demon Realm. It was the stronghold of the Demon Tribe.

So, how powerful must the Demon King be?

Perhaps he could have been an Immortal. Meeting an existence transcending mortals was a good experience, so I expected it.

“Ah…….”

“Princess…….”

“I'm sorry. Everyone. I have to leave now.”

Arenetsha apologizes with a sorry face to the old men. The old men nod their heads.

“No, it's thanks to the Princess's kindness that I can live on as an old man. You don't have to worry about us.”

“……I'm sorry.”

Arenetsha folds her hands together.

A pure black light bursts out from her and envelops the old men.

“Oh, oh, oh…….”

The old men's faces regain vitality. Their bent backs straighten, and their white hair becomes slightly darker.

After a little more conversation, Arenetsha approaches Taesan.

“Is it over?”

“Yes.”

Arenetsha nods her head.

“Let's move. Now.”

They start moving on horseback.
Here is the translation of the text:

She didn't use words to move the carriage, so there was no need for a driver. In the carriage, Annetsha and Quaned were sitting, and also Tai Shan was sitting.

"How far is it?"

"It's about a week or so."

A week.

It wasn't a short time.

I thought of just grabbing Annetsha and Quaned and running, but I discarded the idea.

Mashi said that they were assistants.

It's not impossible that Tai Shan, who was alone, is going through a trial.

Annetsha, who had been quiet, opened her mouth.

"What did Tai Shan do after that?"

"I was going down the labyrinth nonstop."

"How many floors did you go down?"

"58 floors."

"Ah, oh oh."

Quaned was amazed.

"It's just as fast as expected."

Quaned had met Tai Shan for the last time at the 40th floor. The 18 floors he had gone down in between meant something.

"That's enough to meet the leaders soon. Is it okay?"

"It doesn't matter."

He had prepared for that.

"What about you?"

"I'm here?"

Tai Shan's question was answered calmly by Annetsha.

She had been settled in the demon world by Mashi.

However, she didn't know what she should do herself.
Here is the translation of the text:

The people she knew had all died. In the end, the people she trusted betrayed her, and she was unable to even say goodbye to the person who had protected her until the very end.

She was confused.

She had survived, but her survival was meaningless because she had failed to achieve what she had been hoping for.

It was like walking endlessly across a vast plain without a destination.

The spirits had been concerned about her, but this was a problem of her own heart, so they couldn't help her either.

So she decided to find her purpose.

As she wandered through the afterlife, she arrived at a village. The village was one where all the young people had left and only the old people remained, slowly dying.

She settled down in the village.

She took care of the old people and sought the meaning of life.

During this time, she found a man named Kwandae who was on the verge of death. She nursed him back to health and took care of him.

After Kwandae's recovery, he and Arnetsha worked together to manage the village.

"One day, the Lord of the Spirits gave us an order. A new existence is about to descend, and we are to help it by eliminating those who still believe in the old spirits."

"I'm sorry."

Looking back, it seemed that the small peace of mind Arnetsha had found had been broken by the mountains. However, Arnetsha shook her head.

"No, I'm actually happy now."
Here is the translation of the text:

She smiled brightly.

"It's a joy to be able to see the Taesan again."

Her laughter was pure and clear. Quanede blew a whistle.

"The atmosphere is good, but I think there's something that needs to be done before that. Princess."

The carriage, which was moving due to Quanede's magic, came to a stop.

Looking outside, I saw black beasts approaching the carriage.

"Those are monsters."

Anetsha said.

The monsters were similar to monsters. They lived in the underworld and preyed on passing nomadic tribes.

"I'll take care of it. The Taesan doesn't need to worry."

Anetsha stood up bravely.

"Princess, shouldn't I move too?"

"No, I'll do it myself."

She stepped out of the carriage.

The monsters had a lion-like appearance. They approached Anetsha with sharp fangs, moving stealthily.

Anetsha waved her hand.

A dark wind gathered at the location.

Ka-kak!

The wind swirled and shot off in all directions. The monsters jumped back, avoiding the sword.

Anetsha calmly controlled the wind.

Ku-ung!
Here is the translation of the text:

The wind condensed and spread, pushing away the hand. And then, it grasped the hand like a fist and restrained it.

The Taesan looked at it with a strange expression.

The dark wind handled by Arnetsha was the same dark magic possessed by Taesan, known as Seir's dark wind.

However, Taesan was unable to handle this dark magic in the same way. Arnetsha was holding only one dark wind and was able to do everything, including combat and restraint, all at once.

It looked like she had a higher proficiency in dark magic than Taesan in a pure sense.

Quack.

The wind split the hand-possessed ones.

She, who had just finished arranging everything, took a small breath and turned her body around.

"Is it okay?"

She looked like a young child who wanted to show off her growth.

Taesan nodded his head.

* * *

The carriage moved on.

There was night in the Maky Territory as well. It was soon getting dark. Quadne, who had stopped the carriage, said:

"It's getting dark, let's take a break for the day."

"Yes."

They started preparing for a meal.

Arnetsha, who took out a pot, giggled.

"I suddenly remembered the old days. We also had a meal like this with Taesan back then."

"It's a bit different this time."
Here is the translation of the text:

"It was a terrible and painful memory, but I enjoyed it when I was with Master Tae-san. She smiled.

Arnetsha suddenly slapped her hand.

"Yes. Master Tae-san. Can you handle black magic at all?"

"Now I can."

After clearing the quest of Vespera, I was able to properly handle black magic.

"So, how high are you skilled in black magic?"

"I can handle a lot of black magic, but my proficiency is not very high."

[You activated Seir's dark wind.]

The wind gathered on Tae-san's hand.

Black magic is different from magic in that its power changes as it consumes mana.

However, I couldn't do anything beyond that. It was impossible to control the dark wind that Arnetsha showed me like a pet.

My proficiency in black magic also reached a bottleneck at some point. It seemed that it would increase as I became more skilled at handling it.

"Still... black magic is something that belongs to the demon race, isn't it? As a human, Master Tae-san, it's hard to master it."

She smiled with a sense of accomplishment."
Here is the translation:

"If it's okay with you, would you like to learn from me? The difference is enormous depending on how you handle black magic."

"I'm fine, right?"

"I'm definitely fine. The Tai-san saved me, you know. Consider it as a repayment."

"I've already received a repayment."

"No."

Annetsha shook her head. She smiled wryly.

"This is a repayment I want to give personally."
