**Episode 280**

**280. Amelia Airin (2)**

Whoaaa!

Amelia was slammed into the ground. Taesan shook his hand.

"It's not enough... but that's as far as it goes."

Amelia was clearly strong.

With this level of power, she could surpass the 40th floor.

However, Taesan currently had the power to reach even deeper levels.

No matter how hard Amelia struggled, she couldn't even withstand a single blow from him.

Taesan gazed at Amelia, who had been knocked down. Her limp body disappeared.

**[Quest Complete] [You have become the winner.] [Settling...] [You have earned 1,250 points.] [Forced Invitation Activated.] [You are moving to the realm of the gods.]**

The space distorted in an instant.

A massive power crushed everything and forcibly moved Taesan's body.

"Hmm."

Under the pressure of the massive power, Taesan looked around.

A dark, muddy-like darkness spread out in all directions, making a screaming sound.

Taesan scowled.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I could feel it. The darkness that was like mud, what was it?

It was a human soul. Not just one, but thousands.

And the emotions of those souls were filled with despair and betrayal.

'This is...'

A mortal. A place where their souls and emotions were mixed.

Taesan looked around calmly and saw the shining darkness.

The soul was not completely broken, so it wasn't black. It was closer to gray.

But the gray soul was being eroded by its surroundings, trembling as if it would collapse at any moment.

'That is...'

[You.]

Just as Taesan was about to approach the gray soul, a massive voice thundered.

A massive presence began to crush Taesan.

[How dare you, insignificant being.]

It was shining more brightly than anyone in the darkness that was like mud.

The souls that touched the light screamed and fled. A massive being, like a mountain, revealed its teeth to Taesan.

[A mortal like you dares to disrupt my plan.]

Anger was directed at Taesan.

In an instant, his breath was cut off. His entire body was consumed by fear and trembled."

Note: The translation tries to maintain the original tone and atmosphere of the text, but some nuances may be lost in translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the Sadohwa [Darkness and Chaos].] [You have activated the King's Vessel.]

The aura surrounds your body, protecting it. Your breathing returns, and the tremors throughout your body subside.

Taesan opened his mouth.

"I don't understand why you're doing this. God of Descent, Essence."

He laughed.

"I have won according to the rules you set. I didn't do anything to offend you."

[Pathetic.]

The God of Descent's voice was tinged with annoyance.

[You're a worthless mortal who believes in your insignificant power and acts recklessly. Die.]

With the declaration, power surged towards Taesan. The God of Descent's power attempted to kill Taesan.

"No."

Taesan denied his words.

"I'm not relying on my own power, but on something else. God of Descent."

As soon as Taesan finished speaking, space split apart. A small, white hand appeared.

[That's it.] [How?]

The God of Descent's voice was filled with surprise. The God of Descent smiled, revealing his appearance.

[Hello, Essence.] [……God of Descent, young god.]

The God of Descent spoke in a voice mixed with annoyance.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[This is my territory. How did you get in here?] [That's right. It wasn't easy to break into your territory. But... there's a mortal who's connected to me.]

The god gazed at the mountain with a hint of anger on his face.

"[You're going to stand against me to protect a mere mortal?] [Don't say that.]

The god smiled coldly.

"[We weren't on good terms from the start, were we? What's with the sudden concern? And he has a value far surpassing yours.] [God!] [I don't think about meddling in other gods' business, but... this is too embarrassing.]

The god's face was filled with ridicule.

"[You're going to toy with a mortal and then try to take out your frustration on me when it fails? As a transcendent being, your actions are meaningless, but this is too much.] [Shut up, God.]

The fallen god growled.

"[Didn't you do everything for your beloved mortal?] [No. What I did for him was a fair reward for his work. I didn't force him to do something and then reward him like you did.]

The god continued to speak."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[And I'll just observe from afar. I didn't think you'd try to play tricks on me like that.]

The power of the demon god began to envelop the mountain.

[No need to say much. Essence. He's a mortal I cherish. I won't let you touch him.]

The demon god smiled faintly.

The god of destruction was enraged.

In response, the power went wild, and the powers of the two transcendents began to clash.

A power that could destroy the world several times over was unleashed.

And the one who gained the upper hand was the demon god.

The darkness, like mud, was pushed back by the pure blackness.

In the unstable, trembling space, the demon god waved his hand.

[Then we won't meet again. Farewell.] [You!]

The space closed.

The pure black darkness appeared in the world.

[Be careful. A god isn't just someone who favors the capable. There are also gods who act arbitrarily, like immortals.]

"Thank you, Demon God."

The demon god said to borrow his name, but I didn't think he'd actually descend and protect me.

The demon god smiled slyly.

[Then will you become my apostle?]"

"That's not it."

Taesan cut in sharply. Even he himself didn't think what he said was serious, and he took it back.

[It's just that I made the first move. There were many gods who would have stopped me anyway.]

The number of gods who favored Taesan was not small. They moved to stop the God of Destruction, and that was the story.

[It's possible because you built it up in the labyrinth. So, there's no need to be grateful. It's your achievement.]

The demon god looked at Taesan and said,

The demon god waved his hand, and space began to distort.

[Then, it's farewell. I'll look forward to seeing you again later.]

"There's one more thing I'd like to ask before that."

[What's on your mind?]

"If I were to approach the God of Destruction, how would he react?"

[He'll be extremely displeased and give you a tough trial, but... he won't refuse to give you a trial. Even gods need deep trials, and he won't openly try to kill you. I've declared that I'll protect you, after all.]

The demon god smiled.

[Is it because of the pitiful child on the 61st floor?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I've received a quest, so I can't ignore it."

[Don't worry, there won't be any problems related to that. And Amelia, that kid, is the same.]

Taesan gazed at Mashin.

"Did you know?"

[The actions of the Fallen God are quite notorious even on our side. It's not a god with a good reputation.]

Thinking about it, it's no wonder the other gods didn't like it.

The fact that they had descended to the depths of the labyrinth meant they had considerable talent and power.

To use a mortal like that as a plaything and discard them? When you think about why the gods settled in the labyrinth, it's strange that they didn't reject it.

[The Fallen God values talent and ideology. If you don't meet either of those criteria, they'll immediately lose interest. In other words, depending on what you do, you might get abandoned by the Fallen God.]

Mashin smiled wryly.

[Go ahead and try. I'll enjoy watching.]

"Thank you."

The space distorted, and Taesan stood firmly on solid ground.

Note: " Fallen God" is a literal translation, but it could also be translated to "Degenerate God" or "Corrupted God" depending on the context of the story.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The murmurs from the surroundings also reached my ears. When I looked around, I saw an uncountable number of people gathered together.

"No. That's not it."

"Of course, you'd do anything to survive. But isn't that the same for us? With the most people, we have the highest winning rate, so what's the point of this?"

Oliver's excuses and Kim Hwi-yeon's sharp retorts were on display. It wasn't just her; the gaze of other countries towards American players was also cold.

The United States was openly combining their strength to eliminate players from other countries to ensure their own victory.

It was a situation where a fight could break out at any moment.

"I'm sorry."

Oliver raised both hands and apologized. Lee Tae-yeon, who had been quietly listening from the side, opened her mouth.

"Mr. Tae-san?"

"Yes?"

"Where did Mr. Tae-san go?"

Her voice was devoid of emotion.

Oliver was taken aback by her icy cold tone.

"That... we don't know either."

A fierce energy burst out from Lee Tae-yeon. Oliver was startled and waved his hands in defense.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I asked Amelia, who had returned, but she was in a daze and couldn't answer. Since Taesan was declared the final winner, I thought maybe she was getting some kind of compensation."

"So, you're saying that you did this kind of trickery and you don't know anything about it?"

I-Taeyun gripped his sword tightly, and Oliver's face turned pale.

"What's going on?"

"Huh?"

I-Taeyun turned his head in surprise. The coldness that had been in Taesan's eyes earlier was now gone.

"Mr. Taesan!"

Her voice and gaze focused on Taesan.

* * *

[Colosseum has ended.] [Final Winner: Kang Taesan] [Country with the most surviving players: USA] [Rewards will be given to those who achieved results.] [Quest has ended. The adventurers from Korea, USA, France, and Japan gather at the meeting square.] [In two days, they will return to their own labyrinths.]

The quest had ended. But if it had ended like this, everyone would have been dissatisfied.

In the end, they had finally met people from other countries, but all they did was fight and compete to determine the winner.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, after the quest was over, we were given two days to talk to people and exchange information. During those two days, we could see each other's faces and share stories.

'It would have been a place to further boost Amelia's pride, but...'

It wasn't the case anymore.

Everyone's attention was focused on Taesan.

A young man with gray hair and sharp features, who looked like a model, approached Taesan and greeted him.

"Hello."

"Daniel Darmont?"

"Do you know me?"

Daniel's eyes sparkled. Taesan replied.

"Roughly."

"Well, I suppose it's natural. There were rumors about me in the community, so you must know about me."

Daniel nodded alone, drawing a conclusion. Of course, it wasn't the case. Taesan knew him because they had talked a lot in their past life.

"Ah, hello."

A woman with short hair that reached her shoulders, who looked a bit older, bowed her head and approached. Kim Hwi-yeon, who saw her, was taken aback for a moment before exclaiming.

"Could you be Ichijo Eika?"

"Y-yes..."

She scratched her head awkwardly.

Among the many people, leaders from each country had all gathered."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You look much younger than I thought. Is it because you were an idol originally?"

"Don't talk about age."

Aika was startled and waved her hand. Daniel, who was quietly laughing, opened his mouth.

"Anyway... I came to scold you."

Their gazes gathered on Oliver.

Oliver hesitantly opened his mouth.

"Can I make an excuse?"

Daniel smiled wryly.

"No, you can't."

"......"

"We'll talk about the details later. For now, there's a pressing issue that needs to be addressed."

"......That's right."

Daniel and Aika's gazes turned to Taesan. Kyung was among them.

"I knew you were strong, but not to this extent......"

You've beaten dozens of hard mode opponents and even defeated Amelia, known as the strongest in the US and an alone mode player.

Their country also had alone mode players, but most of them were around the same level as hard mode. Rarely, there were those who could beat dozens of hard mode opponents, but it was not a huge difference.

I thought Taesan and Amelia were stronger, but not to that extent.

Note: "Alone mode" and "hard mode" seem to be referring to some kind of game or competition mode, but the exact context is not clear.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But if I had to tell the story, it was more than that.

Oliver shook his head.

"I'm also surprised."

Taesan was stronger than Amelia.

Much stronger.

Overwhelmingly so.

Just looking at the speed at which the final winner was determined after he dropped out, it was clear that Amelia wasn't even a match for him.

"How strong are you, exactly?"

It was a pure curiosity as a fellow player. Everyone except the Korean players sparkled their eyes at his words.

Taesan turned around.

"I'll show you soon."

He had received permission from Masin. Taesan took a step forward, and the people watching made way for him, murmuring in awe.

Amelia, who was on the other side, saw Taesan approaching her and took a step back, giving him a cat-like gaze.

"...What's this? Are you here to mock me?"

Taesan responded with actions instead of words."
