Chapter 365

365. 76th Floor, The Child of God's Blood (5)

The guard led Taesan and the child, stumbling and staggering. Shortly after, a middle-aged man with a gentle face, dressed in magnificent attire, appeared.

"Ah, you're the child who has received the curse of all things. Nice to meet you."

"Yes."

The child nodded silently. The man smiled brightly.

"I am Horai, the god of great order, serving the holy one. So, you're the cursed child. You've overcome all the trials, haven't you?"

"I've passed all the trials that the Emperor has bestowed upon me and have come to this place."

"Amazing!"

The holy one suddenly exclaimed in a very loud voice.

"You've endured your own suffering and guilt and have come to this place! You will surely receive the Emperor's mercy!"

"……."

The child forced a twisted face to remain calm.

The holy one, unaware of the child's emotions, clapped his hands.

"Come this way, then."

As he said so, the holy one glanced at Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'm sorry, but... this is where the Emperor resides. Outsiders are not allowed to enter. Please leave."

"No."

The child shook his head.

"I'll go with him. If not, I won't let him go either."

It was a small but firm voice. The priest's face wavered for a moment as he looked at Taesan and the child, then made a decision.

"......Very well. As a final request, I'll allow it. It's normally impossible, but I'll make an exception."

The priest spoke with an air of immense benevolence, his chin held high.

The priest led the way, and the child followed behind him with a gloomy expression.

The temple was extremely lavish.

It was a place that didn't fit its name, "God of Rules," as it was decorated with gold to the point where it hurt one's eyes.

As they passed through the corridor, the priests they met bowed their heads. When they belatedly noticed the child, they trembled and involuntarily took a step back.

"Please calm down. He has come to offer himself."

The priest comforted them and led the way deep into the temple.

He opened the large door and entered, and inside, there was the Emperor.

A man with a cold, youthful appearance, who looked like he was just about to turn twenty.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He sat on the high golden throne, gazing down at the child with an expressionless face.

"Your Majesty! The apostle of Horai has arrived!"

The saint knelt down and wailed.

"That cursed child! They have come to offer themselves to you, having passed through their trials! Please, accept their original sin!"

The emperor nodded silently.

The saint's face was filled with emotion as he clasped his hands together. Divine power began to manifest.

Kyiiiing!

A device synchronized with the divine power began to activate in front of the child.

"You are cursed!" the saint shouted at the child.

"You, who are cursed by all things, bring death to the lives around you just by existing! Not even great magic can control it, nor is it possible with the power of faith! Alas, even your parents died because of your curse!"

The saint spread his arms wide.

"But His Majesty the Emperor is different! The great one can subdue your curse!"

The saint's voice, which had been filled with fervor, suddenly dropped to a whisper.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Of course, the price is your life... but it's an unavoidable fate, isn't it? If you continue to live, the entire world might be cursed. It's a truly noble sacrifice."

A pillar of light formed in front of the child.

"Please enter. His Majesty the Emperor will lift your curse. Then, everyone can be happy."

The child had come to this place after going through trials for this purpose.

However, the child only stared at the pillar of light and didn't enter.

"...Lord Taesan."

The child spoke slowly.

"Can you say it again?"

"If you want to."

Taesan opened his mouth.

"You said that if you stay in one place for a day, you'll be cursed. But that's impossible. The blue blood you possess is divine blood. It's a power that humans can't handle. Such a curse won't occur."

The saint's face hardened. Taesan continued speaking.

"But you're suffering from the curse and your life is being distorted."

"You... who dares to speak such words in His Majesty's throne room? Right now...!"

"Shut up."

Thud!

The saint's mouth closed with a short word. He tried to say something with a flustered face, but his closed mouth wouldn't open.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You, who were suffering, found a solution from the Emperor, and a prophecy was fulfilled."

"I myself... must become a sacrifice for the Emperor."

The child glared at the Emperor sitting on the throne.

The Emperor gazed down at them calmly.

"Your curse is the Emperor's doing. Your prophecy is also the Emperor's doing. He is the source of all evil."

"What's the reason?"

"The blue blood you possess is a power that transcends mortality. If a strong person like the Emperor obtains it, they may gain even greater power."

Of course, it's just a possibility. There's no guarantee that obtaining the divine blood's power will lead to greater strength.

And the child's life was distorted by that slim possibility.

"If the Emperor hadn't intervened, you would have had the blue blood, but you could have lived a normal life."

"......It's not me, but those around me who are targeted."

"You must offer yourself willingly to obtain your power."

Taesan replied.

The child's face, which had been staring blankly at the Emperor, contorted in anger.

"Your Majesty, is what you're saying true?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The emperor did not respond. He seemed uninterested in the child, as if he could control everything, and only gazed at the mountain.

The child's face became even more distorted.

"It wasn't my curse that killed my parents! Is it you?! Your Majesty the Emperor!"

The child's angry voice echoed in the palace.

The emperor did not respond. His attitude alone made the child realize that their words were true.

"Haha, haha, hahaha!"

The child burst into laughter. The young child who had been tormented by guilt and self-blame was no longer there. Only a child consumed by endless anger remained.

"You! You!"

The anger overflowed.

The mountain quietly opened its mouth.

"You know everything now. From now on, whatever you choose is your own decision."

"......If I make a choice, will you help me?"

The mountain nodded. The child shouted with a distorted face.

"I don't want to die!"

That was the child's true heart, buried deep within. It was their own will, which they had suppressed, thinking they were cursed.

"I want to take revenge on the emperor!"

"That's your choice, then."

The mountain raised its hand.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Depending on the content of the quest, I make my own choice.

This was the choice of Taesan.

“Ugh!”

The power that had sealed the Saint's mouth was released, and the Saint cried out hastily.

“What have you done!”

[You had unleashed Jephar's black storm.]

Kuuuuuuung!

The space opened, and the storm swept in. A powerful force descended upon the earth, destroying everything.

“Oh, oh, oh!”

The Saint's face turned pale as he unleashed his divine power.

But the black storm swallowed it all, taking it into its abyss.

Kugugugung….

When the storm subsided, the temple was completely destroyed. Only the emperor and the throne he sat on remained intact.

The emperor had protected only himself from Taesan's storm.

“I left them all to die.”

“It doesn't matter.”

The emperor spoke indifferently.

“Anyway, they're just inferior humans and their tools. With time, they can be restored. The human next to you is the same. No matter what that insignificant tool does, if you torment it and cause it pain, it will eventually surrender. It's just a bit troublesome.”

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The emperor's gaze did not leave Taesan.

"What's important is you. To be honest, I was taken aback at first. I thought another god had intervened to disrupt my plans."

But as I watched, I realized. Taesan was not a servant of another god. He was just an extremely powerful being.

"I don't know how you came to my world, but I'll crush you and proceed with my plans."

The emperor's power began to manifest.

"Ah."

The child's face turned pale. An overwhelming power was suffocating the space itself.

"Back off."

"Yes, yes..."

Taesan used his power to protect the child. The child looked at Taesan with a mixture of fear and awe, slowly backing away.

Taesan drew his sword.

This was the first time he was fighting a true transcendent servant without any conditions or restrictions. Along with the emperor's overwhelming power, Taesan raised his sword.

"Die under the power of the great god."

* * *

The power explodes.

The emperor's divinity charges at Taesan with the intention of devouring him. Taesan takes a step back.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the "Corrupted Saint" [Dark Chaos].] [You have activated the "Avatar of Nature".] [You have activated the "King's Vessel".]

Your power and strength suddenly reach an unprecedented level. You unleash your power towards the divine, rivaling the might of a mountain.

Kuuuuung!

The shockwave generated by the clash of powers envelops the surroundings.

The mountain-like figure points its sword at the Emperor.

[You have activated the "Saint Slayer".]

"Hmm."

Even the Emperor can feel his power dwindling to a level that's palpable.

"Are you interfering with my power?"

The Emperor scowls, clenching his fist.

The Emperor's body leaps towards the mountain-like figure.

The mountain-like figure holds up its sword.

Kaang!

The sword and fist collide. The power emanating from beyond the sword is something even the mountain-like figure cannot underestimate.

The mountain-like figure realizes that the Emperor is also someone who walks the thin line between power and destruction.

The mountain-like figure takes a deep breath and moves its body.

Kagak!

The sword and fist collide again. The Emperor uses a brutal and powerful martial art. Although the movements are rough, the power contained in each strike is enormous.

But that's all there is to it.

The martial art itself is not that impressive. It can be easily pierced through.

The mountain-like figure's eyes narrow.

Tzok!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan infused his sword with power. He pushed back the Emperor's fist and struck back. The Emperor tried to respond with his body, but Taesan blocked everything and struck down with his sword.

Kwajik.

The Emperor barely managed to block it, but he couldn't help being pushed back.

It was the moment when Taesan was about to strike even deeper.

"Ah, I see. You are a being from the labyrinth."

Kiying!

The light surrounding the Emperor suddenly exploded.

It was a divine amplification that even Taesan couldn't handle. Taesan quickly created some distance.

"I acknowledge it. You are strong. You have exceptional talent and have been created by the gods to conquer the labyrinth and possess the power to rival me."

The Emperor clenched his fist. The divine power surrounding him grew even more intense.

The intensified divine power took shape.

It was a kind of realm.

The Emperor was a god's apostle, and each god had their own realm.

"But even so, it's just a fleeting power. Even if you're on the boundary, you can't obtain the power beyond that."

The Emperor sneered, wearing an arrogant and proud smile, and gathered his power.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I am the God of Rules. The Apostle of Horai. A being who wields the power of God. It's impossible for you to reach me with just that level of power. Foolish human. I will show you the power of God."

*Kiying!*

"Divinity explodes. The realm of the Transcendent is realized in the world, borrowing the power of the Apostle.

[The law of rules is enforced upon you.]"

Note: "Horai" is likely a proper noun, possibly a name or a title, and "Kiying" is an onomatopoeic expression, often used to describe a powerful or explosive sound.
