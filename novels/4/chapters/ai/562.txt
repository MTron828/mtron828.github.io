Chapter 563

563. 98th floor. A complete existence. God's (6)

The Mujoe-ri's power, which has been wounded, swings wildly. The black ink-like substance devours everything and runs wild.

Tai-san does not retreat.

Setting a boundary, Tai-san dashes together with the boundary's beast. The beast's body grows, taking the form of a massive wave, trampling and suppressing the black ink-like substances.

Tai-san also wields a sword to break through the boundary. Kwa-a-a-a!

The boundary and the black ink-like substances burst forth. Mujoe-ri trembles. The massive body made up of flesh and blood separates.

And the separated flesh and blood explodes, sweeping forward like a claymore.

"Block it."

The boundary's beast changes its form, taking on the shape of a massive curtain. It collides with the flesh and blood.

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung!

The aftershocks shake the surroundings. The boundary's beast does not retreat even against the flesh and blood.

The boundary has now taken on the form of a living being, materialized from matter.
Here is the translation of the text:

At that time, the physical strength and boundaries could truly blend together. Although it was possible, it was not a perfect fusion.

The collision subsided. Although it was blocked, the impact of the boundary's beast was not insignificant. It was in a state of being torn apart and disintegrating.

However, it circulated.

The parts that were distorted and broken gradually recovered. There was no intervention from the mountain. It was like the beast was licking its own wounds and recovering on its own.

The beast, which had recovered itself in an instant, rushed towards the Muzhang again.

The mountain followed behind. Using the path created by the boundary's beast, it approached Muzhang.

Together with the boundary's beast, it launched an attack.

Muzhang was not affected by any attack from the mountain. Its flesh and blood lump simply swallowed everything.

However, this time it was different.

The boundary's beast collided with it, and the flesh and blood lump was shaken.

Muzhang, although infinite, could not consume everything. It could not eat beyond a certain degree of intensity.

And the mountain has now met that condition.

There was no longer a reason to avoid battle.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san didn't stop. Mu-jeok-gang was also enraged and moved its body.

Tae-san and Go-sin faced each other and refused to back down.

Cuccuccuccu!

A shockwave spread. The boundary beast launched its body at Mu-jeok-gang and struck it. A massive chunk of flesh trembled.

Mu-jeok-gang was not still either. It swung its dark viscous liquid to try to swallow the boundary beast. Tae-san quickly issued an order to dodge, but it wasn't successful. Some of the boundary beast's body was devoured.

Although it recovered quickly, it was a clear loss.

Tae-san spat out his tongue.

"It's not yet under control."

The boundary beast, which had a pure physical body, was slowly slipping out of Tae-san's control once again.

It was necessary to focus one's mind only on controlling it. Therefore, Tae-san himself was unable to move properly.

It was still impossible to fully control that boundary beast.

Then,

Tae-san made a quick decision.

"Ah."

The boundary beast, which was about to rush at Mu-jeok-gang, stopped in its tracks and returned to Tae-san on its owner's command.

Tae-san stroked the slimy boundary beast.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Surround me."

And an order is given.

The beasts of the boundary obeyed their master's will. They slowly climbed onto the body of the mountain god and wrapped their entire body around it.

It looked like a gray armor.

Of course, it was impossible for the underground demons to watch this scene calmly. They burst forth, trying to swallow the mountain god whole from the hole.

Wrapped in gray armor, the mountain god drew his sword.

The will of the beasts and the mountain god converged, causing a massive explosion. The abyss shattered with a loud noise, and the fragments covered the mountain god. However, the beasts of the boundary, who had wrapped themselves around the mountain god like armor, rejected everything.

If control is difficult, they make themselves one with him. They force him to obey their actions.

This is the correct way to handle it.

The mountain god, wrapped in armor like a beast, regained strength in his legs.

The underground demons moved their massive bodies directly.

A massive collision occurred. The gods who had been guarding from the outside suddenly felt a strong burden.

[I find it hard to bear.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Masin murmured to himself along with a sigh. His role was to suppress the influence of the abyss and the resonating power of the mountains on the universe, so as not to affect it.

It was the same role as the one he played in the past as a magician on Earth.

However, he felt a significant burden. Every time the mountains and the abyss collided, the barrier he had set up would shake greatly. If he didn't concentrate his energy, it seemed like it would break apart at any moment.

Masin, who had strengthened his resolve, gazed at the battle.

A massive chunk of flesh moved. It flowed with a dirty abyss, polluting the universe and trying to swallow the mountains.

And the mountains responded without retreating even one step.

It broke apart the abyss face-on and struck the main body of the abyss.

[What a wonderful... one!]

Masin let out a pure admiration.

Although Masin was assisting, what he was doing was to prevent the pollution from spreading to the outside of the universe. He was not involved in the battle.

It meant that the mountains were standing alone, opposing the abyss in a pure way.
Here is the translation of the text:

That kind of transcendent being was truly rare. Even someone like Rakiratas, who was on par with the gatekeeper, couldn't win against a superior being like Muozhang. It was almost impossible for them to win against a being like Muozhang.

However, the peculiarity of Tai Shan was advantageous against superior beings, but it was an unbelievable sight.

[A victorious cry, strong one.]

The demon whispered softly to himself. The collision between the dim light and the abyss caused a resonance that shook the space.

* * *

Kuuuuuung!

The battle continues.

Tai Shan did not retreat from Muozhang.

And that fact was unexpected even to Tai Shan himself.

'I never thought I could fight so evenly.'

He had undoubtedly reached the same level as Muozhang.

However, he had just reached this unstable position. He had obtained the life cycle's burden, but he couldn't fully control it, so he was forced to cooperate with it.

The life cycle's beast had obtained self-awareness, and its greatest advantage was its power, but it was possible for it to act independently. However, it was abandoning this advantage.

Despite this, Tai Shan did not retreat from Muozhang.

No, Muozhang was gradually weakening.

Tai Shan soon figured out the reason.

Gurgle.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the hole pierced by Tai Shan through multiplication, the abyss flows out. The leakage does not stop. It seemed to have the power to truly defile the entire universe.

The hole created by Tai Shan's multiplication inflicted irreversible damage on the divine being.

The divine being's immutability. They were born with that strongest characteristic, never changing from the moment they were born.

It was damaged by itself.

The Underworld could no longer exist as the Underworld. At the bottomless abyss, the bottom suddenly appeared.

The Underworld's body was a collection of powers. The hole pierced through that collection meant something like that.

"...Hoo."

Tai Shan raised his upper lip.

He was actually thinking.

How could he crush the Underworld?

It was not enough just to create a hole with an attack power of over three times. Physically killing it was almost impossible.

He tried hitting it a few times using the beasts of the boundary, but it didn't seem to have much meaning. He couldn't think of a suitable method to crush it.

However, now the answer has come.

Quaaa!

He speeds up, with the boundary wrapped around his body.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Underworld's power is unleashed. It scatters the abyssal depths, blocking the path and devouring the Taesan.

Taesan stops moving, releasing the boundary beast.

Hmph!

The armor that covers Taesan rises. It spreads to all directions, filling the boundary area. It collides with the abyss and breaks apart.

Hmph!

The Underworld's power trembles. A mass of flesh expands, engulfing everything.

Hmph!

The boundary beast that covers Taesan is torn off. It rapidly circulates and replenishes itself, but is consumed even faster.

However, Taesan did not retreat.

Instead, it stretched out its hand towards the abyss.

[You have activated the Divine Succession.]

You seize the Underworld's power itself.

Taesan had never used the Divine Succession against the Underworld.

To be exact, it was almost impossible.

The Divine Succession is not perfect. During the succession, Taesan is left defenseless.

And the opponent is in a state of complete integrity.

Whether one can properly control the succession is hard to promise. It was judged that it was better to half-seal the succession and fight.
Here is the translation of the text:

But now it was not the case.

The abyssal pit had lost its inviolability.

Its power had fallen, and the bottom had appeared.

Then, it could have seized the opportunity at any time.

The abyss was placed under the control of the Heavenly Emperor, like a powerful force that was not a burden.

And the Heavenly Emperor seized the abyss that had been seized.

The abyssal pit and its power collided.

There was no ripple or aftermath.

Each abyss had swallowed the other, and it was over.

And then, the abyssal pit came to a standstill.

It just stood there, as if it had been struck.

And then, a moment later.

Power exploded. The abyss, filled with rage, turned everything upside down. It was the rage of one who had lost their own possession.

"Try it."

The Heavenly Emperor laughed and galloped away. He dodged the black ink that was flying towards him and arrived at the front of the abyssal pit.

And then, he stretched out his hand to the abyssal pit.

[You have activated the abyssal pit's usurpation.]

Suddenly.

The abyssal pit's power itself was seized.
Here is the translation of the text:

And then, the power that had been seized, was poured back into Mujo-gang. The abyss of Taesan and Mujo-gang's abyss collided, causing a commotion.

!!!!!

Mujo-gang violently shook its body. It rejected and denied Taesan in order to shake it off. The abyss rose up and tried to engulf Taesan.

It was impossible to conquer everything.

Therefore,

"Rise and block it."

The boundary that had been drawn with Taesan was born, and it swept aside the abyss, shattering it.

Taesan did not remain still. It quickly moved to avoid Mujo-gang's abyss and grasped its hand again.

[You have activated the Divine Seizure.]

The Divine Seizure seized the abyss and wielded it.

In the process, it was clear that Mujo-gang's power had decreased slightly. At that moment, Bardray also understood Taesan's strategy.

"[...Taesan, you won't understand.]"

"The power that exists at the bottom is a power that is consumed and eventually reaches its end."

The Divine Seizure seized Mujo-gang's power. The moment the bottom was reached, it was destined to meet its end at some point.

Therefore, it was consumed completely. Mujo-gang's power was consumed.

To the point where it could no longer be grasped, Mujo-gang's power was consumed and concluded.

That was Taesan's judgment.
Here is the translation:

"Is that really possible?"

Badriel instinctively knew that what Tae-san was trying to do was correct.

However, being correct and being able to achieve it were two separate things.

Even if the bottom of the abyss had formed, it was impossible to guess what level it would be. It was certainly not a low level. It would still be an infinitely deep and bottomless level.

And I'll consume it all.

In that process, I had to avoid and block all of God's attacks. It was a virtually impossible task.

But to Tae-san, it was not a difficult thing.

S-grade monster.

A monster with hundreds of thousands of wounds, incredibly strong to the point of being terrifying. It could kill Tae-san with a single blow.

Tae-san defeated such a monster with a mere 50 points of damage.

And at the end, he gained the ability to transcend his limits.

It was already done.

The only thing that changed was that the opponent was no longer an S-grade monster but a God. The fundamental things remained the same.

"Actually, I'm more capable than before."
Recalling memories and experiences from the era of ease. The eyes of Tai Shan have calmed down. His physical body is rushing towards the underground prison.
