**Chapter 380**

380. 78th Floor, the Library of the Gods (5)

Although something felt off, there was no reason to reject Ainzhart's proposal. Taesan followed Ainzhart to a deep part of the library.

"It's all thanks to you that I found Lord Levienov."

Ainzhart hummed as he walked ahead. He didn't even know that Lord Levienov was in the Library of the Gods, so if it weren't for Taesan's help, he would still be searching for the goddess.

"That's why I think it's only fitting to give you the opportunity to meet the goddess."

"Is that so."

Taesan quietly gazed at Ainzhart.

His attitude and reaction were clearly unusual. He looked very different from the Ainzhart of the past.

"This way."

Ainzhart led Taesan to the edge of the library.

[Hey, old man. Congratulations. You finally found her? You've been stuck in this labyrinth longer than I have, haven't you?]

The ghost spoke to Ainzhart. Only then did Ainzhart notice the ghost's presence, and he let out a loud "Oh!" and a sigh of relief.

"Brave warrior! You were here too! It's all thanks to the great mountain that's been by your side! Thanks to that, I was able to fulfill my wish to enter this place!"

Ainzhaar chuckled and moved the location of the books. Before long, the bookshelf moved, revealing a secret room.

"Come in. Lord Levienov is inside."

Ainzhaar entered the passageway. After a moment, Taesan, who had been watching his back, also moved forward.

The library of the great mountain was bright even without a single candle, but this place was dark. It was as if it was separated from the outside world.

Above all, the further they went into the passageway, the stronger they felt an otherworldly power.

[...Hmm.]

The ghost sensed something was off. Taesan scrunched up his face.

"This is..."

It was extremely strange.

The energy felt in the realm of the Overlords was diverse, but it had a clear individuality.

However, the power they felt now was jumbled and unclear, like something that couldn't be grasped.

And Taesan was handling a power similar to that.

"Boundary line?"

But it was different. The boundary line was jumbled, but at the same time, it was separate and could be controlled to some extent. However, the power felt beyond the passageway was literally twisted.

Note: "용사" (yongsa) is a term used to address a brave warrior or a hero, and "자네" (jane) is a polite way to say "you" in Korean. "태산" (taesan) is a name, and "아인츠하르" (ainzhaar) is also a name, likely of a character. "레비네노프" (levienov) is likely a name as well.

Taesan steeled himself and passed through the corridor.

Ainz Ooal Gown smiled faintly and opened the door.

"Ah! It's Lord Lebienov!"

What he saw beyond the door was his beloved goddess, Lebienov.

She was quietly lying down in the vast, empty space of the room.

Her face was extremely soft and gentle. Just looking at her made his heart feel at peace.

Taesan had met many gods in the past, but among them, she appeared to be the most benevolent and merciful.

However, the aura he sensed was completely different.

It was something twisted and impossible to exist in this world.

The aura emanating from the goddess's heart was like a corrupt and foul energy.

[Ugh.]

The ghost, Taesan, instinctively covered his mouth. Although he was already dead and didn't have a physical body, he felt a strong sense of revulsion. The aura in front of him was unbearable.

[What is this?]

Taesan suppressed his chest. As a living being, his instincts were disturbed by the scene in front of him. It was as if a masterpiece created by a craftsman had been brutally defiled.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The goddess's appearance was beautiful, but it was too unnatural. At the very least, it couldn't be called a god.

"Ah! Kneel down and pay your respects to the goddess!"

Only Ainzhart, with empty eyes, spread his arms wide.

"My goddess, it's Levinefov!"

[You discovered Levinefov, who had been possessed by a high god and was now in a confused state.]

* * *

[……Inspiration.]

The ghost asked in a trembling voice.

[What's going on.]

Levinefov was clearly abnormal.

Ainzhart asked in return.

"What's wrong?"

[What's wrong? It's about the goddess's state. How did this happen...?]

"Ah! You're talking about that."

Ainzhart smiled brightly.

"The goddess is currently in a bit of a rough state. Don't worry about it. With time, she'll return to her original form."

[……Return? To her original state?]

"Yes. She'll definitely do that. So don't worry about it."

Ainzhart said it with conviction.

But his words sounded more like they were directed at himself than the ghost.

[Then there's nothing to say, but...…]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The ghost trailed off. Ainzhahr was a believer of Revinefov. The ghost couldn't say anything because Ainzhahr knew more about the goddess's state.

But it was too unsettling.

The ghost couldn't be sure if that was a recoverable state.

"Ah, it seems the goddess is also a bit tired. I'll take my leave."

Ainzhahr left with a worried expression, taking Taesan with him.

"I'm sorry. I finally got to meet the goddess, but I couldn't even offer a single prayer. I'll come visit again whenever I get the chance. I'll always keep the door open for you, unlike others."

"......Thank you."

"What's there to thank? I'm the one who should be grateful."

Ainzhahr chuckled.

After parting ways with Ainzhahr, Taesan continued to flip through the books in the library, but the contents didn't sink in.

His mind was only filled with thoughts of Revinefov.

The distorted and twisted goddess, and the power he felt within her.

Taesan opened his mouth.

"Balbam."

Rumble.

The floor shook, and Balbam appeared.

[Why did I call him?]

"Ainzhahr, do you know?"

[......I think I met him. Now that I think about it, it was you who told him the goddess's location.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Barbaramba bit his tongue.

[It might have been better for Ainztahar if he hadn't told us. If so, we could have at least had an unshakable faith and lived our lives.]

"What's that supposed to be?"

Inside the broken goddess, the power of the gods could be felt.

Barbaramba thought for a moment and then spoke.

[It doesn't matter who you are now. But you're not that person. You're a hero. You need to take a step back.]

[Can't I hear the story? You're being stubborn.]

The ghost grumbled but obediently kept its distance. Barbaramba gathered his strength. A veil covered the two.

Only then did Barbaramba begin to tell the story.

[The gods are trying to destroy this universe. In the process, countless worlds and transcendents have died.]

Taesan already knew this story. The demon had said that over 200 worlds had been destroyed by the gods.

[Many beings have perished. Mortals, immortals, and transcendents who had obtained their own domains. The Levienov you see now is also one of them.]"

Note: There may be some nuances or cultural references that don't translate perfectly, but I've done my best to provide an accurate translation.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Was it because we blocked the invasion of the High God and suffered damage?"

[But if we go into details, it becomes much more complicated, but to put it simply, that's what happened.]

"Still, that state is strange, though."

Levinehoff was ruined.

The power of the Goddess and the power of the High God were mixed and twisted infinitely. It couldn't be explained simply as taking damage.

[Because the High God is an existence beyond the law.]

Balbam said calmly.

[An transcendent being with their own domain will not die as long as their domain itself does not disappear. However, many transcendent beings have disappeared in front of the High God. The reason is simple. They can contaminate their own domain.]

"Contaminate?"

[For a transcendent being, their divine name and domain are everything. The High God contaminates that domain itself. It's extremely fatal, shaking the foundation of the gods.]

"......Is that possible?"

A god's domain is absolute. No one can intervene or touch it.

It's hard to imagine that it can be contaminated, unlike destroying it with a stronger power like a demon god.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[I said it. It's an existence beyond the laws. The domain and the divine name are also a kind of law in the end.]"

"What's with that law, anyway?"

The law and the law beyond, it was a phrase that had been repeated over and over. But I still couldn't understand its meaning.

"[It's the most fundamental principle that makes up this universe. If you're a being born in this world, you can't escape its absolute truth.]"

"...... Wait a minute."

The law is the principle that makes up the universe. If you're a being born in the universe, you can't escape it.

But the high god was an existence beyond the law.

A thought flashed through Taesan's mind.

"[That's as far as it goes.]"

Balbam quietly organized his thoughts.

"[This is all the information you can know.]"

"It seems like you've told me quite a lot, though."

"[You, who are currently limited but have transcended mortality, are allowed to know this much. Now you should understand why I said it's an unattainable faith, right?]"

"Roughly, yes."

The power beyond the law had contaminated the transcendent's domain. And it was no exaggeration to say that the domain was everything to the transcendent.

Even the same gods couldn't adjust the transcendent's domain.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Although the God of Knowledge has protected Levinov in the sacred repository with his own will, even the gods cannot do anything about this situation.]

Babambam spat out his tongue.

[To be honest, I want to get rid of Levinov right away. It's too unstable.]

As soon as he finished speaking, a powerful wave burst forth.

It was a heterogeneous wave that mixed the power of the gods and the divinity of the goddess.

[It burst again.]

Taesan quickly flew to the location where the wave had burst, which was the secret room where Levinov was situated.

As soon as he arrived at the secret room, he saw Ainshar's figure desperately exerting her power.

"Oh, Goddess! Please!"

The gentle expression on the goddess's face had disappeared.

With her eyes wide open, she was shedding black tears.

Her darkened chest was pouring out a thick, heavy energy.

[Aaahhh!]

A painful scream burst forth. Ainshar's face contorted in an instant. It was a scream that shook her very soul.

Chachachach!

The goddess's wound opened, and a grayish energy burst forth.

It was an energy that contaminated everything it touched, filled with heterogeneous power.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan has revealed his divinity. His divinity is suppressing the dark energy and starting to purify it.

[This is not a mess.]

Balbambara is fiercely unleashing his power. The labyrinth is starting to distort with the goddess at its center.

Kukukukuku!

He is strongly suppressing Leviathan's power, as if sealing it away. After some time passes, Leviathan closes his eyes again.

[Ainz, is this the ending you desired?]

“…….”

Ainz is sitting down, staring blankly at the goddess.

Balbambara leaves, saying:

[Although I got involved this time, I have no intention of interfering with the goddess. If there's a problem, Jorge will take care of it. But leaving the goddess in that state, wouldn't it be better to make her comfortable as her sole believer?]

* * *

"You've shown me a pitiful sight."

Ainz apologizes to Taesan with a gloomy face.

"I'm really sorry. I've gotten you involved in this."

"It's not your fault."

Taesan shakes his head. He asks quietly:

"Did you know the truth?"

"……I couldn't not know."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ainz's face was gruesome as he nodded his head.

Ainz was a monster.

He was stronger than the current Ta-san by far.

If we were to compare him to the strongest, he would be among the top-tier immortals. It was only natural that Ta-san, who had caught a glimpse of his power, would be unaware of his true abilities.

He was simply avoiding reality and turning a blind eye.

"Lord Lebineon is suffering. I want to help, but there's nothing I can do."

His face was filled with a sense of powerlessness.

"The fact that I was saved by his sacrifice, but I can't return the favor, is utterly despairing. He's still holding on with his own strength, but... there's no way."

The goddess was not yet completely consumed by the power of the gods.

The black tears and screams from earlier were proof of that. It meant the goddess was still resisting.

But, as Ainz said, there was no solution. It was futile to expect Ainz to solve a problem that even the gods couldn't. It was a meaningless struggle.

"Perhaps, as Balbaroy said..."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Isn't it my job to make her comfortable?"

Ainzhar clenched his fist with a painful expression. His fingernails dug into his palm, and blood began to flow.

Taesan thought quietly to himself.

The goddess was still resisting the power of the divine punishment, her purity not yet completely tainted.

And Taesan knew of a power similar to the goddess's state.

"It's a very unlikely story."

"Huh?"

"If, with a low probability, there's a way to resolve the corruption that has consumed the goddess."

Ainzhar's pupils dilated. Taesan spoke.

"How do you plan to do it?"
