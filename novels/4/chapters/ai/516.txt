**Episode 517**

**517. The Eighth Return, Earth (2)**

Whoa!

The guardians all knelt down at once. The earth shook greatly, as if there was an earthquake.

Taesan silently gazed at them.

"Wow……."

"Amazing……."

People whispered to each other, looking at their appearance. Although it was a small murmur, it became a big noise due to the enormous number of people.

One of the kneeling men scowled.

"It's unpleasant. Those things dare to look at us like we're clowns……."

"Hey."

Akrasian stopped the man.

"We're in the presence of a great person. Let's show some respect."

"I apologize."

His attitude didn't seem very sincere. It was more like a warning out of courtesy since Taesan was in front of them.

"This doesn't seem like a suitable place for conversation. Can we change locations?"

"There's no need."

Taesan snapped his fingers.

The earth moved.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was as if a rail had pushed away everyone except Taesan and the Guardians. And a massive wall began to rise.

Kugugugugung!

In an instant, a vast space was created, with only Taesan and the Guardians standing inside.

The Guardians' pupils grew larger. Taesan applauded. Hundreds of Guardians felt a sense of being forcefully suppressed, as if someone was holding them back.

Thud.

Before they knew it, chairs made of earth appeared, one by one, in their places.

They all sat down in their chairs, regardless of their own will.

The entire process unfolded naturally, as if the world itself belonged to Taesan.

No, it was actually true. Taesan was now the god of the earth.

"Sit down, your legs must be tired."

"......Yes, yes."

Akrasian's voice trembled. Multiple emotions were visible in his gaze towards Taesan.

"So."

Taesan spoke without any emotional change.

"Who are you people?"

"We are the Guardians."

"What do you guard?"

"The universe."

Akrasian spoke confidently, with pride.

"We are a group that guards the universe from the threats of the gods."

Taesan gazed at them with a calm expression.

Not weak at all.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They all had tremendous power. Especially, Arkrasian was the strongest among them.

'The great one is...'

'Gang Tae-san.'

'Thank you for allowing us to call you by your title. Gang Tae-san also knows, doesn't he? The fact that Gosin is invading numerous worlds.'

The number of worlds destroyed by Gosin exceeded 200. It might have reached 300 by now.

'And in the worlds invaded by Gosin, even the great ones cannot intervene carelessly.'

When the transcendent beings intervene directly, an imbalance occurs. As great power intervenes, Gosin also gains the opportunity to intervene.

So, the transcendent beings used Tae-san as their representative and sent him to numerous worlds.

Tae-san was able to learn about the existence of the guardians.

'You are the representatives.'

'It's an honor that they chose us. We are following their will and protecting the worlds that are being invaded by Gosin, and defending them.'

Arkrasian's face was filled with pride and self-satisfaction."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We moved to a world being invaded by Gosin according to their instructions, and we protected many worlds."

"This time, this world has become the target."

"Yes."

Akrasian nodded his head.

"We have come to this place to close the crack in the sky and save this world. Great ones."

They were the magicians who had come to help.

The general situation was understood. But Taesan couldn't help but have doubts.

"You're going to block the crack in the sky?"

"Of course, it's not impossible. But the Transcendent Ones have given us their help."

As Akrasian muttered briefly, the space opened up.

Kiiing.

It was a small orb.

The orb had many intricate, geometric patterns etched onto it. The power of the Transcendent Ones could be felt within it.

It was extremely powerful. Even Taesan, who was present, couldn't analyze it immediately. Akrasian picked up the orb and said,

"The Transcendent Ones cannot intervene directly, but intervening through sacred relics like this is possible. We will install a total of four orbs directly below the crack in the sky, and after performing a ritual for a certain period of time, we can seal the crack."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If it's sealed, how long will it last?"

"As long as the transcendent being who gave us the sacred artifact does not disappear, it will be eternal."

Arkashian said calmly.

The annoying crack in the sky could be closed.

The earth could be freed from the threat of monsters.

"......Really?"

It was a very good thing. Once this return was over, the earth would be freed, and he would be able to fulfill his long-held wish.

But something was off.

Like having a foreign object stuck in his throat, it was annoying. A small intuition was bothering him.

Seeing Taesan's silence, Arkashian confidently patted his chest.

"Don't worry, great one. We are the guardians."

The voice was filled with unstoppable pride.

"We have protected many worlds. The great being is far more powerful than us, but in this field, we are the experts."

Confidence.

And arrogance.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If a great being were to lend us a hand, we could easily save this world."

Taesan, who was gazing at Arkashian, opened his mouth.

"How much do you know about this world?"

"Yes?"

"Do you know what kind of place this is and what it is?"

"Isn't this a world that is being destroyed by Gosin?"

His face was as if asking what else there was.

Taesan could tell what kind of beings they were. He didn't even need to use reconnaissance.

There was no need to say it explicitly. It wasn't worth it, nor was it necessary.

Taesan opened his mouth.

"Please help us."

* * *

[They're guardians. They didn't come when my world was being destroyed.]

"The universe is vast, after all."

Diana responded to Bardley's question.

"There are many worlds that have been destroyed by Gosin. And there are even more worlds that are being invaded. Even if we're guardians, we're just a group of a few hundred. We can't protect every world."

"There are things that don't sit well with me."

Veldeki's face scrunched up in distaste. His face towards the guardians was filled with hostility.

[He seems to know something.]

"Yes."

Diana affirmed.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They came to our world too."

[...Huh? Didn't your world get destroyed by the gods?]

"That's right. Our world was destroyed due to an unpredictable environmental change. But... I think they didn't quite understand, and the guardians came to find us."

[But your world...]

Diana and Beldegencia's world was destroyed in the end due to indulgence.

Diana wore a sorrowful smile.

"I can't like them. They are clearly righteous people. But, they're not exactly kind, either."

* * *

"Wow..."

"Amazing."

A massive crowd had formed around the guardians.

People whispered and gazed at the guardians.

Their eyes were filled with admiration and wonder.

They were aliens. Diana and Beldegencia were also aliens, but the feeling was different between the two individuals and the group.

Moreover, these were the guardians who had come to save them.

They were the ones who had saved numerous worlds. Most people knew about it since Taesan had told Kim Hwi-yeon, so they had a rough idea.

The players had curiosity and goodwill towards the guardians.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

One person who had gathered their courage approached them first.

The guardians were all chatting with each other and taking a break.

"Uh, hello?"

A quiet voice echoed through the group of guardians.

"……."

There was no response.

The guardians continued to chat with each other.

The face of the person who had mustered their courage turned bright red in an instant.

"Uh, excuse me?"

Even when they asked again, there was no response. It wasn't that they couldn't understand the guardians' language. They could understand it just fine. It was as if they were deliberately ignoring them.

In the end, the person who had spoken up couldn't do anything and turned back.

It was the same even after that. There were people who had gathered their courage, but there was never a response. They were perfectly ignoring them, as if they didn't exist.

"This is unbearable."

Amelia scowled.

"What's with this attitude? It's like they don't want to talk to us, like we're beneath them or something. Do they think they're nobles or something?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Hmm... Well, since you've come to help us... We should at least maintain a good relationship. You're Suho, right? You must have considerable power, so you'll definitely be a big help."

Those who have protected numerous worlds must have such strength. Kim Hwi-yeon thought to himself under his breath.

However, Amelia's reaction was different.

"...Help? Hmm. I suppose it's possible... but I don't know."

Amelia muttered softly.

"Well, it can't hurt to have you around, I suppose."

Kim Hwi-yeon desperately tried to rally the people. He controlled the confusion and anxiety, preparing them for the upcoming quest.

Although they didn't reach a consensus, a new quest appeared.

[Special Quest Begins.] [You must move to the location of the rift in the sky. Defeat the monsters that appear, advance, and reach the bottom of the rift.] [Condition: All players, including the Guardian, must arrive at the location of the rift.] [Reward: The reward will be given according to your achievements when you return to the labyrinth.]

The quest has appeared.

This time, they had to move directly below the rift. Kim Hwi-yeon quickly called out to the people and assessed the situation.

"Where is the rift located?"

"It's in Greenland,"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Greenland……."

It wasn't that far away. At least it was much closer than the other side of the Earth.

After confirming the location, Kim Hwi-yeon organized the formation and prepared to lead the people out.

And at that moment.

"What are you doing?"

Akrasian spoke to Kim Hwi-yeon.

Kim Hwi-yeon was taken aback. She had spoken to Akrasian before, as a leader, to coordinate their opinions.

But Akrasian didn't respond at all.

In the end, she had to return without any significant results.

But suddenly, Akrasian spoke up. Kim Hwi-yeon quickly regained her composure.

"We need to move through the heavenly rift, so I was organizing the formation. If it's okay with you, you can also……."

"No."

Akrasian cut off Kim Hwi-yeon's words.

"We don't need your opinions."

"......Yes?"

"Your job is to follow our orders. That's all."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The cold words resonated. Kim Hwi-yeon was taken aback. Akrasian's tone was one that even enemies would feel intimidated by. She barely managed to compose herself and opened her mouth.

"What do you mean...?"

"We have saved over a dozen worlds from the grasp of destruction. On the other hand, you are stuck in this barren world, unable to even save one. You're just struggling to survive."

His voice was filled with deep contempt.

"What's more, there is a great being present here. Yet, the situation still hasn't been resolved. That means you're not of any help to that being."

Kim Hwi-yeon couldn't refute his words.

She also felt the same way. In the end, Taesan was the one who solved everything. They hadn't been of much help to him.

"We have saved numerous worlds."

Akrasian declared confidently.

His voice was devoid of any doubt.

"Your experiences and advice are like the babbling of a three-year-old child to us. Your only task is to follow us. That's all."

A declaration filled with conviction resonated. Only someone who had achieved numerous accomplishments could make a statement with such confidence.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Everyone's mouth was shut tight. There was an arrogant tone in that voice that crushed everyone.

"There was something I was curious about from the moment we first met."

Amelia's voice echoed in the silence.

"Are you the ones who saved countless worlds from destruction?"

"That's right."

Akrasian confidently affirmed. Amelia couldn't help but feel even more suspicious.

"Only you people?"
