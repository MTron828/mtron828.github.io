**Chapter 522**

522. The Eighth Return, Earth (7)

Ugh...

My body is crumbling. The immense physical power is completely destroying the original form of the apostle.

Kiiiiiiing!

The apostles are exerting their power. They are apostles, the direct subordinates of God, who have destroyed countless worlds. Their strength is unparalleled, and there is no one who can rival them, except for the transcendent being.

Two apostles combine their powers. They create a black aura and transform their bodies to resist the physical power inflicted upon them.

Ududuk...

But it's not working.

The physical power is crushing their resistance like a steamroller. The immense, concept-transcending beings are being torn apart by simple physical power.

[#@!!!! takes 4,561,159,434 damage.] [#@!!!! takes 4,561,159,434 damage.] [!@%^&&& takes 4,112,111,688 damage.] [!@%^&&& takes 4,112,111,688 damage.]

The apostles' resistance is completely broken, and the physical power is spreading out into the world.

Tzzzzt!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The physical strength and the colliding perception collapse.

The mantle begins to appear, and the earth's crust starts to reveal itself.

If this continues, the planet Earth itself will collapse.

Taesan raised his hand.

[You have activated the internal world.]

A realm created by power and vigor expands. It grabs onto physical strength, preventing it from affecting the world.

Kwaaaah!

And the condensed physical strength explodes.

With a loud noise, it sweeps through the internal world. Taesan lightly brushed his sword.

"End."

Before him, two apostles lay sprawled out.

They didn't die. It was impossible to kill them with simple physical strength.

But in the state just before, it was possible to make them that way.

The two apostles were in a state of near-death, unable to do anything.

[…It's giving me the chills.]

Even without a physical body, Bardray got the chills.

Bardray had thought that copying was a powerful skill.

To double the effect of the skill without any penalty. It was an extremely excellent skill that could change the situation.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But I thought that value was lower than addition or forced duel. The cooldown was quite long, and only magic or dark magic could be copied, which didn't mean much to Taesan at the time.

But that was his misconception.

Copying required multiplication to unleash its true power, a skill that was far superior to addition and forced duel.

"Ah, very good."

Taesan murmured, not sending out any random, mediocre apostles. The two apostles were optimized to block physical attacks.

In front of the amplified attack power boosted by multiplication and copying, the concept of attributes didn't exist.

The apostles were never weak. Even if Taesan had fought while manipulating the boundary, it would have taken some time. He had pushed his enemies to the brink of death with just two attacks.

Taesan manipulated the boundary.

Quadruple.

He finished off the apostles. A massive power burst forth and settled within Taesan.

[Your dark attribute proficiency has increased by 3%.] [Your dark attribute proficiency has increased by 4%.]

The guy who flew into space couldn't be confirmed, but the Transcendents must have handled it. Taesan cancelled the internal world's activation."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And what appeared was a sky filled with countless monsters, to the point where there was no empty space.

"There are too many."

It seemed that this time, there were an enormous number of monsters, with several S-grade monsters among them.

People were desperately trying to hold them back, but they were being slowly pushed back by the endless horde.

Taesan, who was watching the scene, raised his hand.

"It's just in time."

Whoosh. Mana burst out of Taesan's body.

[You have activated a colorful, rainbow-colored dash.]

The magic that the labyrinth-creating mage had given him, which had been forgotten by everyone, was now being realized.

And seven-colored light beams appeared in the world.

The light beams rushed towards the monsters.

"What?"

The people who were fighting the monsters suddenly stopped.

The rainbow began to cover the world.

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung!

Hundreds, thousands of light beams pierced through the monsters. In an instant, all the monsters that filled the entire sky were erased, dropping to the ground.

Quadd-thud.

[Uuuuah!] [Oooooh!]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There were even S-grade monsters there. A single-digit monster tried to resist the pouring light, but hundreds of light beams crushed its resistance and shattered its body.

Taesan cancelled the magic activation.

"It's usable."

The sky, which was filled with monsters, was torn apart.

Again, pouring monsters began to fill the gap, but he annihilated all the monsters that poured down on Greenland in less than 3 seconds.

This is an extremely powerful magic. And its range is wide. The pouring rainbow-colored light easily covered the entire Greenland and still had some left over.

Its power is also considerable. Within the range of the rainbow-colored light, there were also dozens of S-grade monsters. All of them were unable to resist and were annihilated.

"Mana consumption is also less than I thought."

During the 3 seconds the skill was activated, 2000 mana was consumed. Considering its power, it would not be strange even if it consumed three times that amount. Since it's possible to control the rainbow-colored light beams and concentrate power, it's a skill with many uses.

"It's fine."

If he could use it by mixing it with the boundary line or black magic, it would be more valuable than any magic he possesses.

He was satisfied.

"You guys take care of the rest."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A quiet voice echoed across Greenland. People's faces were filled with reverence and faith towards Taesan.

"Oooo!"

They held up their weapons and shouted loudly.

"Taesan, sir!"

His name resonated throughout the land. A massive faith exploded.

* * *

The monsters were powerful and numerous.

But they were not weak either. With their faith in Taesan and their past experiences, they were able to take down the monsters one by one.

Quadduduk!

And finally, they were able to finish dealing with the monsters to some extent.

"Oooo!"

"We won!"

The people erupted in joyful cheers. Of course, the battle was not over yet. Monsters were still descending from the cracks in the sky.

But they were able to respond adequately, taking turns.

They won again. The people began to relieve their fatigue accumulated from the battle.

And then, Lee Tae-yeon, who couldn't hold back anymore, came to find Taesan.

"Taesan, what's that?"

Lee Tae-yeon knew Taesan better than anyone else here. After thinking deeply, a natural answer came to him.

"......Did you get multiplication?"

"You're right. Multiplication doesn't have physical power or anything."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's not it, and that kind of talk is nonsense. It's because it's impossible to reduce its influence."

Lee Tae-yeon could feel it. A physical power that could even destroy a planet.

It was a power that couldn't be obtained with any skill or item.

If there was a possibility, it was only one.

Multiplication.

And he had obtained a skill that contained physical power. There was no other way. Taesan nodded his head.

"That's correct. You have a good sense."

Without saying a word, he approached the truth. It was clear that Lee Tae-yeon had the ability to clear the Alone Mode.

"Ah... really."

When he realized that his prediction was true, Lee Tae-yeon let out a dry laugh.

"How did you get it again? I thought it was impossible to get multiplication, at least."

Lee Tae-yeon knew the conditions for obtaining multiplication. Since Taesan hadn't hidden it from the start, most players had figured out the conditions.

And Lee Tae-yeon was a player who had cleared the Alone Mode.

So, he understood better than anyone else.

That obtaining multiplication in Alone Mode was impossible.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is there a floor in Alone Mode that meets such conditions? No, isn't it at least minimal? Is there a way to square the attack power numbers?"

"It's impossible in Alone Mode."

So, I turned back time.

Taesan took out a piece of Uroboros. As Taeyeon watched, her pupils grew larger.

"That's..."

"I got the material while clearing the floor."

"Huh."

Taeyeon understood what Taesan had done and where he got it.

She let out a dry laugh.

"You turned back time to get the multiplier. This is ridiculous."

It was an extremely foolish thing to do. But aside from that, there was no other way to get the multiplier, so it was close to the correct answer, but also close to impossible.

Her face showed pure admiration and respect.

"You're amazing, as always. So, can you go back as many times as you want?"

"No, that's not possible."

It took a considerable amount of power to go back once. If time passed, the consumed power might recharge and become possible again, but that was still a distant story.

"That's a shame. So, how did you convert it to physical strength?"

"I received a skill from Balbam."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's a skill obtained with administrative authority. Considering its effect, it's a skill that can't be obtained, so it's reasonable."

She concluded, looking at Taesan with a fresh face.

"Then, your damage can reach tens of billions, hundreds of billions, right?"

"That's right."

"Haha."

A laugh escaped. But Lee Tae-yeon had a somewhat convinced expression.

"......Yeah. That's correct."

Multiplication.

A skill that exceeds the irregular range, making damage square.

However, Taesan couldn't utilize that skill properly. With his weak and lacking stats, no matter how hard he tried, it was difficult to see damage in the billions.

The value of Multiplication wasn't just that.

In Easy Mode, his physical body was trapped, and the skill couldn't even show 1% of its effect. Lee Tae-yeon was deeply saddened by that fact.

Now, that great skill was finally revealing its true power under the proper stats.

"Finally, everything is going right."

Lee Tae-yeon muttered to himself, smiling.

Time passed.

Monsters continued to appear, and people fought.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But it didn't become a big problem. The monsters that appeared were at a level where they could be defeated by themselves, even without Taesan's help.

Time passed easily like that. The pillar of light that blocked the crack grew bigger and bigger.

'...What's going on?'

Taesan scowled.

Gosin had sent down three saints after that, but there was no movement. If things continued like this, the crack would be blocked, but it was too quiet.

[Are you giving up? Honestly, with your multiplication ability, it seems like they can't do anything.]

Gosin was trying to lure Taesan into using the boundary line.

I don't know what he was planning to do, but he was probably aiming to break the orb.

However, thanks to the physical strength of multiplication, Taesan was able to defeat the saints without using the boundary line.

Gosin's plan itself was twisted. They had sealed Taesan's leg on the other side, but suddenly, he was flying around with wings.

It was impossible to predict multiplication, so from Gosin's perspective, it was a perfect backstab. Bardley's words were not wrong.

But there was something strange.

'That doesn't mean you can't send anything down, does it?'"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The demon king cannot come down. But the apostle's level is not that. At the very least, a fragment or a piece could be sent down.

However, even as the pillar of light grew wider and covered the cracks in the sky, the demon king did not show any unusual movement.

As the pillar grew larger, it became increasingly difficult for the demon king to exert its influence on this world. It would have been better to respond beforehand, but after sending down the three apostles, there was no unusual movement.

'…….'

There's something.

It can't end like this. The unease I felt when I received an explanation from Akrasian has been growing.

"Let's investigate."

Taesan took a step forward. His body jumped over the empty space.

Taesan disappeared from the earth."

Note: "문지기" is translated to "demon king", but it can also be translated to "gatekeeper" or "doorkeeper" depending on the context.
