55. Earth. Return (3)

They all died. The ghost continued to mutter.

["How did they survive so far if they couldn't catch even one Big Rat?"]

"They had easier labyrinths than mine."

["Easier labyrinths? Where are those?"]

Taesan explained. They were given choices like Easy Mode, Normal Mode, Hard Mode, and Alone Mode. They chose one and entered the labyrinth.

After a moment of silence, the ghost spoke up.

["There are different labyrinths?"]

"Yes."

["...What are you talking about?"]

It was a very perplexed voice.

["There is only one labyrinth. It can't be separated into modes like that. That's impossible."]

"But what if it actually is?"

Easy, Normal, Hard, Alone. Each mode had different monsters and bosses on each floor. Everything was different. The only thing in common was the shape of the floors and that there were 100 floors.

After a long pause, the ghost finally organized its thoughts.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"At least as far as I remember, labyrinths were not separated. Occasionally, dimensions were separated by gods, but it was extremely rare, and most returned to their original state."

Taesan looked up at the sky.

Monsters were flowing out from the wide-open hole.

"Was it made by someone?"

Easy, Normal, and Hard modes were created by someone other than the sorcerer.

So, the only true mode is the Alone mode.

It was an unknown truth, but Taesan wasn't surprised. He had already suspected it. NPCs, Named, and gods existed only in the Alone mode, so he predicted that they were originally different.

"Is that possible?"

Great wizards and transcendents intervened in the design of the labyrinth. The ghost said dismissively.

"The design of the labyrinth was difficult because of that density. Each floor is like a dungeon itself. If you copy and paste clumsily, nothing is impossible. Still, it would require a lot of power."

At least a transcendent.

Perhaps something more than that.

"But it's fascinating. Even if you remove the essence, it would still require a lot of power due to its size... And you made three of them? What was the purpose?"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The ghost that Najik spoke of distorted its voice.

"Can't we just run straight to our destination? I don't want to see those things."

"No."

Taesan replied calmly.

"There's nothing we can do about it anyway."

The new quest wouldn't start until the majority of the group arrived at City Hall. There was no reason to rush.

"Sigh."

The ghost let out a deep sigh.

* * *

It wasn't much different afterward.

The ghost remained silent as if displeased, and Jung-geun defeated the monsters.

When occasional revengeful monsters appeared, Taesan threw rocks at them.

As this pattern repeated, people began to realize something strange was happening.

"Don't the monsters seem to disappear strangely?"

When Jung-geun confronted one, the other monster that was about to attack suddenly vanished. It was clearly odd.

However, their stats weren't high enough to see Taesan's movements, and since rocks were not targets of Eye Rock Weaponry, they couldn't find an answer.

"Can't multiple monsters move together?"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Due to lack of information, they could only speculate in that manner.

As they continued freely, the ghost spoke.

"Why are you helping them so strangely? Just take everyone and run straight to the destination. You like helping anyone."

"I'm not particularly fond of that."

"Huh."

The ghost asked as if puzzled by his response.

"You help just about anyone else with great enthusiasm."

"I don't help just anyone. I help those who have potential."

"Then why not just let these guys die?"

"I can't do that."

He was someone who did various things for the people he gave affection. Jung-geun was one of them.

It wouldn't matter if they died, but then Jung-geun's spirit would collapse.

With plenty of time, it was a good time for small talk.

It was mealtime. Everyone started eating with bored faces.

"Ugh... tasteless."

"Couldn't you get something from the convenience store?"

"What if we meet a monster on the way there?"

For safety, everyone roasted the meat of monsters they had brought from the labyrinth.
Taesan pulled out a can of spam. He had managed to get it from the convenience store. When An Jung-hee saw the golden tin can, she exclaimed in admiration.

"It's spam! Where did you get it?"

"Before I joined up."

"Wow...."

She looked at it with envy, but didn't say anything more.

Players who survived in the labyrinth were weak but still alive. They were well aware that there were no exchanges without a price. Someone like Jung-geun was particularly unusual.

"Ugh... I want to trade but I don't have anything to trade."

Not just her, but others too looked at him with envy, but said nothing more. Those who did so were shameless indeed.

"Hey. Hand it over."

A muscular man approached Taesan. He confidently extended his hand as if it were his own. The rose tattoo on his forearm was impressive.

Taesan looked at him sideways and popped another piece into his mouth. The man's face twisted.

"Are you insane?"

"Who are you?"

"I-I...."

An Jung-hee looked pale and speechless. The man puffed out his chest.

"I am Chang-seok Lee, a high-ranking member of the Athena Guild, the strongest guild in normal mode!"

"And?"


Taesan asked casually. Chang-seok burst into a sarcastic laugh.

"Hey. Do you want to go back and die? Do you really think you can challenge the Athena Guild?"

"Well..."

Taesan muttered under his breath.

"Can you go back?"

"What?"

The Athena Guild. It existed even in the previous world. It was said to be the largest guild in Normal Mode, attempting to control the labyrinth through bullying and domination, or so he heard.

'They all died the second time they returned, right?'

That was the Athena Guild Taesan remembered.

When Taesan didn't react, Chang-seok's face turned red.

"This guy... really wants to die."

Chang-seok raised his hand.

"That's enough."

* * *

"Ah."

An Jung-hee's pale face brightened.

"Mr. Jung-geun..."

Jung-geun approached expressionlessly. Chang-seok flinched for a moment but soon boldly stood his ground.

"Why?"

"Stop it."

Her subdued voice echoed. Her cold face turned towards Chang-seok.

Chang-seok grimaced.

"Who do you think you are?"

"...."

"Just because you brought him, do you think you can say anything? Why should I listen to you?"
Chang-seok was confident. And he had some calculations in mind.

"This guy is a sucker."

He didn't expect anything in return as he brought them along. Always cheerfully making sacrifices for them with his life.

Chang-seok thinks that those with power have the right to do so. However, to offer without any expectations is inexplicable and not something he wanted to understand.

Geum Jung-geun is a good person. Even if he leaves strongly, he is someone who cannot do anything.

They were people who occasionally appeared in the previous world, and Chang-seok sucked them up. People say they're good, but to him, they're no different from suckers.

"This is our personal business. You're out."

"Ha."

Jung-geun sighed.

His eyes contained annoyance.

He reached out and grabbed Chang-seok's head.

"Hey, you! Aren't you going to let go of this?"

Chang-seok struggled with a stiff face, but his hand didn't shake. Jung-geun raised Chang-seok. The muscular man felt very light.

"Hey! You!"
"I know what you're thinking."

Tae-san watched quietly.

If Chang-seok had one thing wrong in his thinking.

Jung-geun wasn't the sucker he thought he was.

"However you feel is your freedom, but if that crosses a line..."

Jung-geun struck Chang-seok's chest with his fist. Chang-seok staggered back, gasping.

"I can always discard you."

"Ugh, ugh."

Though the damage from the punch didn't affect him much, the impact itself was substantial. Unable to even scream in pain, Chang-seok looked up coldly as Jung-geun stared down at him.

People flinched and turned their heads. Unable to meet their gazes, Jung-geun smirked bitterly.

---

Tap, tap.

The fire crackled.

Although City Hall was within a few hours' distance, the sheer number of people meant they wouldn't arrive until nightfall.

Tae-san approached Jung-geun sitting by the fire.

"Are you taking turns keeping watch?"

"Everyone must be tired."

"You must be tired too."
Jung-geun had engaged in fights more than five times since he arrived.

Others either watched or fled in fear.

Jung-geun responded with a bitter smile. Tae-san sat across from him.

"People seem afraid of you."

Since Jung-geun attacked Chang-seok, people had been very cautious. It wasn't just avoiding the monster but also watching Jung-geun's every move.

They had only seen Jung-geun's gentle face before, so now it was strange and frightening. They had all believed deep down that Jung-geun would surely protect them, so they were scared to do anything to jeopardize that belief.

"There was no other choice. It was something that had to be done."

He stirred the fire with a stern expression.

"There were too many people. It could have been dangerous many times."

If Tae-san hadn't been there, over twenty people might have died.

"I had to make them listen to me as much as possible once I caught them. Thank you. It gave me a good opportunity."

Jung-geun was suspicious of Tae-san.

His demeanor was too calm and his face showed no hesitation, unlike normal mode.
When monsters appeared, there was not a hint of hesitation. His demeanor was overly stable to be considered ordinary. There was even suspicion whether he was feigning composure like a monster.

But no abnormality beyond that was found.

When Tae-san threw a stone, it wasn't a moment of intense fighting.

Even if there was room for composure, he wouldn't have noticed the big difference in stats.

"Just useless thoughts."

Jung-geun chuckled. Tae-san is an ordinary person. There's no way he could be a pretending monster. It was when he dispelled suspicion.

"Is there a need for that?"

"Huh?"

Tae-san said absentmindedly.

"You could easily make it to the city hall."

"...Are you saying we should abandon all of them?"

Hundreds of people.

Jung-geun asked with a trembling voice at Tae-san's words about letting them die. Tae-san looked at Jung-geun with sunken eyes.

"If you're a human in hard mode, you would know. Those who can live, live; those who will die, die."

Jung-geun bit his lip.

Hard mode is a mode with a survival rate of 1%. After surviving there for three months, one naturally learns.

That the ones who can live, live, and the ones who will die, die.
Here is the English translation of the text:

"Even if someone helps, the criteria don't change. Even if it might temporarily extend their lifespan, they'll die soon enough.

"You can go alone, right?"

As they actually headed towards the city hall, they encountered several players. Confident in their own strength, they glanced at Jung-geun and his group, scoffed, and left without looking back. Some openly called them crazy.

"Why cling to a life you're going to lose anyway?"

"You..."

Jung-geun looked at Tae-san with an emotionless voice.

Creepy.

Jung-geun felt a chill for a moment.

He could somewhat gauge a person's character by looking into their eyes. It was an ability he had acquired growing up, though he had always dismissed it as superstition akin to physiognomy.

Tae-san's eyes were deeply sunken.

A human who had faced countless deaths and could not empathize with them. A human who had let go of everything facing the end.

He was not an ordinary human in normal mode. Jung-geun gripped his sword.

"Who are you?"

Eyes filled with caution.

Eyes that scrutinized others.

There was no Jung-geun who warmly greeted him with a smiling face.

'Never seen him before.'

"Well."


Here is the English translation of the text:

Tae-san stood up. Jung-geun was taken aback by seeing his back.

"We're going to city hall anyway, right? I'll tell you then."

"..."

Jung-geun slowly lowered his sword.

The day broke.

They started moving again. Their expressions brightened as they only had about an hour left to travel.

But there was one thing they didn't know.

Monsters had received orders to attack humans heading towards city hall. In other words, once they reached city hall, the monsters wouldn't attack them.

Those moving alone were either already there or dead.

Naturally, the monsters began to gather.
