Chapter 409

409. The World of Half-Ran's Destruction (1)

"'I'm satisfied with the reward, but I have one question.'"

Taesan looked at Jerbrand and said.

"'How long do you plan to keep me in the mausoleum for this quest?'"

Wira's power was impressive. With just a dimensional definition, it would be difficult to win, and on top of that, he had also handled dimensional destruction. If Taesan couldn't obtain the dark magic, it could take years.

Jerbrand also knew this fact. He opened his mouth with a calm tone.

"[That place is the mausoleum. Only the magic users I have recognized can enter, and they can research magic there. In other words, it is the optimal place for learning magic.]"

"'Are you saying you want to learn magic?'"

[The original plan was like that.]

Taesan invested a year's worth of time in magic, increasing his magical proficiency and learning many spells.

That was Jerbrand's intention.
Here is the translation of the text:

[You wanted to grasp the essence of magic and create new magic, but perhaps you also hoped to become a disciple of mine, but it didn't turn out that way...]

Gerald muttered with a regretful tone. Tae-san shook his head in response.

The gods were certainly unpredictable.

Although they favored Tae-san, it was not necessarily beneficial to him. Tae-san realized this once again.

[But don't dislike it too much. If it weren't for this kind of trial, I wouldn't have been able to obtain advanced magic.]

Tae-san didn't deny his words.

Tae-san experimented with advanced magic on Wyrda, which was called "Great Destruction". The power contained within was undoubtedly something that couldn't be obtained through ordinary trials.

"'Advanced magic is... a power that exists within the concept of laws.'"

[Yes.]

Gerald laughed.

[It's not just simple magic. It's a power that pierces the essence of the world. That's why it could cancel out Wyrda's white magic.]

The level of magic contained within was different from before. Even Tae-san didn't expect it to be this powerful.

[But since you've already obtained forbidden magic, it's not surprising to you. Too bad.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Zervalnd spat.

There was a mix of power and rules beyond the negation magic.

Tai Shan quietly waited for Zervalnd's words.

The magic he possessed was Zervalnd's power.

He mixed it with blackness to create a new magic. And Zervalnd was a god opposing the high gods.

It was easy to predict that Zervalnd would not like the negation magic.

However, Zervalnd did not show any unusual reaction.

[I know what you're thinking, but I don't care. It's also a new path for magic. If those fools directly touched my magic, I wouldn't know... what you're handling is none of my business.]

"Thank you."

The only anxious element disappeared. Tai Shan expressed gratitude. Zervalnd leaned back in his chair with a relaxed expression.

[If you want to get another advanced magic, you can just offer sacrifices like this.]

"It seems to take a long time."

Even just mastering the intermediate magic required a large amount of sacrifices. The advanced magic was beyond his grasp.
Here is the translation of the text:

As you exchange favors, you'll eventually get it. There's no need to go through the trouble of releasing it. That child is having fun with the child on the 61st floor.

Belbangia, an NPC who has taken up residence in the labyrinth. His wish was to save the princess who was seized by the god of downfall.

And the god of downfall was residing on the 83rd floor.

The god treated Belbangia's princess and Amelia like toys.

It was not long before they met.

[Work hard. I'll be watching.]

"I understand."

[Is it really over now?]

Jerbrand shook his hand, intending to send the mountain back to the labyrinth. The mountain suddenly opened its inventory.

"Can only magic items be used? Are these impossible?"

The mountain's hand held materials similar to the essence of the world and divine blood.

Jerbrand shook his head.

"It's not possible. Although it's valuable, I'm a god of magic. I have no use for it. Even the gods will react similarly, right?"

"That's right."

These materials can only be used by the mountain directly. We've confirmed everything, so it's really over now.

[Then, if the opportunity arises, let's see each other again.]

With a soft voice, the mountain returned to the labyrinth.

* * *
Here is the translation of the text:

Zervalnd's plan was shorter than expected, but still a considerable amount of time has passed. I stayed in the Mahtap for more than a month.

Tae-san opened the community and checked other players. Most of them were going down the labyrinth without any problems.

In particular, Lee Tae-yeon was really fast.

He had already reached the 62nd floor. Kang Jun-hyeok and Kim Hwi-yeon were worried, and Amelia was confused.

[Gum Jung-geun [Hard] : Brother, is everything okay?] [Kang Tae-san [Alone] : It's fine.]

Tae-san didn't worry. He knew Lee Tae-yeon. Although his memories of the present life were mixed and changed, the essential part remained the same.

He's still being cautious and going down, you know. The speed of reaching the 62nd floor was not particularly fast, and there were no problems.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Special permanent skill: Path of Magic] [Proficiency: 1%] [A person who is advancing towards a higher level of magic. By understanding the essential part of magic, they can obtain the qualification to handle advanced magic.]

[Blue Light Mana Earrings] [Health + 1,000] [Mana + 3,000] [Strength + 300] [Agility + 300] [Intelligence + 1,000] [Magic + 100] [Defense + 400] [A earring formed by the concentrated blue light mana. The mana inside is particularly pure.]

Although there was no attack power, the magic stats were extremely high. As the stats related to the power of magic, it was much more valuable than ordinary attack power stats.

Before checking everything, Taesan moved.

But it was not below, it was above.

He searched for Halfian. Halfian, who was greeting Taesan, froze.

"...Why don't I feel any strength?"

"Ah, I was still activating it."

Taesan released the authority seal. At the same time, the sealed existence and its intensity surged.

"Ha."

Halfian's face turned pale.

Taesan slowly absorbed the existence. After a while, Halfian managed to calm down and laughed.

"Really... it's not possible. I thought it would take a long time to reach this point, but it seems I've reached it so quickly."

Taesan was a monster.

As long as he looked at his own destroyed world, he could understand how to conquer it. Halfian predicted that he would transcend his mortality one day.
Here is the translation of the text:

But I didn't think I had already reached the 80th floor, let alone exceeded the 90th floor.

Halfdan laughed out loud and started hammering away.

"You're a monster, aren't you? But what have you come for this time?"

"To confirm something."

Tae-san took out a pair of rings from Halfdan and showed them to him. White and black. The ring was one that Halfdan had made. After examining the ring, Halfdan nodded his head.

"You're completely under my control."

"This ring said it was a twin, that it was equal to the other. So, is it possible to make this ring into one?"

"...?"

Halfdan closed his mouth.

After a moment of thought, he spoke up.

"It's impossible. It's already become a twin. Trying to merge it again is impossible..."

"If there's a skill to merge it, then?"

"What?"

If I could get a skill that lets me crush twins and make one, I could make the ring into one.

After listening to the explanation, Halfdan closed his mouth again.

"...then it's not impossible."

A long time later, he came to a conclusion.
Here is the translation of the text:

"But the initial characteristics of the materials were too intense, causing a backlash, so they were made into twins. To combine them into one and enhance their effects, you need materials that can suppress their individual characteristics to a certain extent...".

Before Halfdan finished speaking, Taesan showed the materials.

The essence of the world, crystallized blood, the seal of struggle, and the reality of collapse.

These materials were only obtainable by transcending the depths, and perhaps even impossible to obtain within the depths. Halfdan was speechless.

"Are these materials sufficient?"

"...They are sufficient."

Halfdan shook his head.

"But the problem still remains. Unfortunately, I am not skilled enough to handle these materials."

Halfdan had said the same thing before.

He was undoubtedly a brilliant blacksmith, but ultimately a mortal being. It was impossible for him to handle materials beyond his level.

Taesan also knew this.

However, it was impossible for Taesan himself to refine the materials and create equipment. Nor could he abandon them as meaningless.

He couldn't bear the thought of leaving the materials without meaning.

So he thought of a way to do it.

"If I become your hands and feet, can I handle these materials?"

Halfdan's eyes widened.
Here is the translation of the text:

Halfran can make equipment, but lacks the expertise to handle materials.

Taesan has the expertise to handle materials, but cannot make equipment.

Therefore, Taesan becomes Halfran's hammer and anvil.

"Is this method possible?"

Taesan asked Halfran.

"It's possible."

After listening to Taesan's words, Halfran remained silent for a while before suddenly speaking up.

"The eternal being's hands will help me refine it. Although it's rare, it's not impossible. If I follow that method, I'll be able to handle materials that I couldn't handle before. Given your current situation, there won't be any actual problems..."

He muttered to himself, seemingly searching for a way.

Finally, his voice trailed off, and he burst out laughing.

"That's possible. Definitely possible! With that, I'll be able to make the most outstanding thing in this world!"

The passion and lifelong dream were embedded in that voice.

"I'll be able to achieve my dream!"

Halfran exclaimed loudly, sending a profound emotional shockwave through the space.

* * *

Halfran enthusiastically accepted Taesan's proposal.
Here is the translation of the text:

"But there is a condition. While it is possible to create equipment by using your hands, I also need to accept your power to some extent. If not, it's not just about hands, but it's equivalent to a mere third party. So, I need materials for that."

"What kind of materials?"

"You know it well."

Half-ran pointed at himself and raised his finger.

"My destroyed world. The will of the world that exists there. It's definitely transcendent, but I was a resident of that world. Although we destroyed it, it remains unchanged. Using that, we can create a connection between you and me."

Half-ran spoke very quickly in an excited tone.

He chuckled.

"There's a problem. It's the will of the world itself. It's not just about transcending mortality."

When he actually met the will of the world, Half-ran had anticipated his own death.

The will of the world had suffered harm just by showing its hostility. If there was no boundary, there was a high possibility that he would have died there.

But now, Half-ran was an immortal.

He had risen to the level of the will of the world that had tried to kill him.

"This is my final quest. I'll go to my destroyed world, defeat the will of the world, and come back."
Here is the translation:

[Sub-quest starts.] [Halfaran proposes the final quest to you. Enter his ruined world, crush the world's will, and bring back its core. If you succeed, a reward will follow.] [Reward: Halfaran's perfect trust and faith. With this, you can obtain various equipment.]
