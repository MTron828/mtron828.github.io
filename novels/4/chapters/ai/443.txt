Chapter 444

444. 87th Floor. Ma-gyeong (1)

My attack power has increased by 500 compared to before.

And Bardley could also move on his own to attack the enemy.

"You can act alone if you want to."

[It's possible, but... I'm still too clumsy in my movements. Even if I'm only at my usual level, I should be able to handle it without any trouble, right?]

Bardley couldn't fully control his body, which had turned into a sword.

[If that happens, you won't be able to use me as a weapon. That's a big disadvantage.]

"Still, it's worth using when the time comes. We need to prepare a spare weapon."

I also confirmed the shape transformation a little while ago. Bardley had transformed from a sword shape to a human shape. Although there was a limitation of only being able to maintain the human form for one hour a day, it was a big advantage to be able to take on a human form.

And Bardley had become a growth-type equipment.

Considering Kosrun's goal, it was only natural, but the fact that my attack power increases every time I defeat an enemy was unexpected.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But you'll have to try it out for yourself to know the exact extent of its power, but even at a moderate level, it's more than enough."

[Is that okay?]

"I'm sorry to say this, but it's amazing."

The sword had a value that exceeded its worth as a weapon.

After finishing his rough inspection, Taesan went to find Coslun. Coslun didn't appear, even though he was taking a rest. Taesan waited quietly.

The next day, Coslun appeared with a refreshed look on his face.

"Good, good. So, you've thought about what to ask of me? I'll do everything I can within my abilities."

Coslun examined Taesan's equipment. His gaze stopped at Taesan's fingers, one by one.

"That ring..."

Coslun's gaze was fixed on the black and white ring that Taesan had. Coslun let out a sigh of admiration.

"......That's impressive. What is it? It doesn't look like equipment from the labyrinth?"

"Hafuran made it for me."

"Hafuran? He's a skilled guy, but can he really make equipment like that? Can I take a closer look?"

Taesan handed the black and white ring to Coslun. Coslun's eyes were filled with wonder as he examined the ring carefully.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Amazing. But there's still room for improvement. Shall I modify this ring for you?"

"I have a favor to ask of Half-ran. There's no need to touch it before that."

Using numerous precious materials, I combined the black and white rings into one. That was the request Half-ran had made to me.

It wouldn't be strange even if things were settled slowly. I thought I'd visit once before returning to Earth.

"Really? That's a shame."

Cos-rune returned the ring to Taesan, smacking his lips.

"Then, is there anything else you need besides this?"

"Yes, there is."

Taesan took out the arrows.

[Self-aware Arrows] [Arrows that move on their own to protect their owner. They have self-awareness and can move within a certain range.] [Current Owner: Gang Taesan] [Current Attack Power: 3421] [The arrows have reached their limit.]

Taesan had obtained several self-aware arrows previously.

They were quite useful since they could move on their own, but at some point, he stopped taking them out altogether.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The reason was simple. Using an arrow alone had no significant meaning. The arrow had to be controlled by the user's will or intent, but doing so required a considerable amount of mental energy.

Moreover, in most battles, the mental energy spent on using the arrow exceeded the benefits gained.

That's why the arrow had not been used properly until now.

Taesan wanted to modify the arrows to make them more useful.

"Hmm."

Kosrun examined the arrows with an interested expression.

"Who made these? In the case of equipment like this, the creator's intent is usually visible, but there's none of that here. The quality is extremely high, though... that's all."

"Is it possible?"

"It should be possible."

Kosrun fiddled with the arrow.

"Just wait a moment. I'll make something suitable."

Kosrun took the arrows and entered his own space.

And didn't come out for a while. Taesan waited patiently.

He also had a lot to do. First, he had to adapt to the changes in Bardley. Taesan grasped the sensation of the Storm Sword, which he had obtained by wielding Bardley. Bardley, too, began to adapt to its own body, which had become a sword.

After about three days, Kosrun reappeared.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

In his hand was not an arrow, but a spear.

[A fusion of self-awakened throwing spear] [A throwing spear created by fusing an arrow that moves on its own to protect its master. It has a self and can move. It can move over a wide range and can recover on its own. It can synchronize with its master to increase its power and strength.] [Current master: Gang Tae-san] [Current attack power: Gang Tae-san's attack power] [Deals various abnormal status effects to the enemy it hits.]

"Wow."

The attack power had become the same as his own attack power. Kosrun said with a pleased face.

"It's a level of equipment that surpasses my imagination. I wonder who made it. Since it has limitations when used alone, I made it into one. It should be usable to that extent."

"That's enough."

Tae-san threw the spear. The spear thrown into the air drew a fast trajectory and made a piercing sound.

Tae-san didn't need to control it with his will or intentions; it moved on its own, synchronizing with Tae-san. This level of power was enough to handle future enemies.

It was a result worth investing time in.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Are you curious? Who made that?"

"Hmm."

It was when I obtained the arrow with a will that I defeated the forgotten assassin.

It was equipment related to the goddess who had lost her name and was forgotten by everyone. Since I hadn't met the goddess since the last altar, I had even forgotten about Taesan.

"There must be something."

It wasn't like there was a meaningless labyrinth with an altar for no reason. Taesan had even received a quest about the goddess.

The quest was to find those who worshiped the forgotten goddess and restore their faith.

But after that, nothing happened. Even though I was already in the late 80s, I didn't see any signs.

I didn't know how to proceed, so I just waited until the time came.

After finishing his preparations, Taesan bid farewell to Coslun.

"Then I'll look forward to seeing you again."

Coslun saw Taesan off with a happy face.

Taesan headed towards the 87th floor.

[87th Floor Quest Start.] [Conquer the Devil's Realm.] [Reward: A snake statue with a dark aura.] [Secret Reward: ???]

The goal of the 87th floor quest was to break through.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

As I tried to take a step forward, Barbalbaba appeared.

[Before heading to the 87th floor, I'll put one restriction on you. I'll seal your immortal level and bring it down to a mortal level.]

"Whatever."

There was no reason to refuse, since I couldn't even get the reward I wanted at an immortal level. Barbalbaba used the authority of the labyrinth to bring down the level of Taesan.

"But isn't it supposed to be raising the level of the labyrinth, not lowering my level?"

I'll create a labyrinth worthy of Taesan. The wizard had clearly said so.

[You're an immortal now. Do you think it's easy to find a floor that suits you? If the gods aren't involved, it's almost impossible.]

Barbalbaba's voice was thick with frustration, as if he was under a lot of stress.

[If it takes you a long time to clear one floor, you'll have some leeway, but that's not the case. A floor that restricts you will inevitably come out. The wizard's careless words are causing me trouble.]

"You're having a hard time."

[This floor won't be that difficult.]

Barbalbaba said.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[I'm close to the floor where I need to stall for time to create the next floor.]

"'Can I say something?'"

"[It doesn't matter anyway. Saying this won't change anything. But I won't be able to clear this floor quickly.]

"'Even so, after clearing this floor, I'll have some leeway.'"

"[...And when I think about it, it's already become like that.]

"It takes a considerable amount of time to clear one floor.

And by the time I cleared the 87th floor, it was time to return to Earth.

"[From the 90th floor onwards, the wizards and gods will take care of it, so I only need to worry about the remaining floors.]

"Having said that, Barbalumbaba returned once again.

"[In this Earth, I hope to stay as long as possible.]

"'That's not for me to decide.'"

Taesan entered the 87th floor.

What he saw there was a bright moon hanging in the sky.

And it was a vast battlefield.

Countless monsters were killing each other."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan stepped into the world. At the same time, a knight in a twisted armor, who was lying on the ground, got up. He swung his half-broken sword at Taesan.

Taesan swung his sword. The knight, still in an attacking stance, was cut in half.

Ku-u-u-ung!

Just as the knight was about to fall, a massive hammer swung down. It was an attack from a giant one-eyed ogre, as big as a house. Taesan swung his fist.

Kwaa-a-a-ang!

The hammer shattered and flew away.

Taesan threw Bardley. Bardley pierced the ogre's chest and returned to Taesan.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

And it didn't end there.

As the fog cleared, countless monsters were rushing towards him.

Broken knights, barbarians, beasts, monsters.

Taesan, looking at them, raised his hand.

[You have activated the Great Destruction.] [You have activated the Magic Explosion.]

A sphere that could destroy everything appeared in the world and exploded.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

Everything was swept away. When the power subsided, there was nothing around Taesan.

But within his sensing range, he couldn't see the end of the monsters.

The number was countless.

"What is this place?"

[You have activated the Realm Detection of Leraje.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Kiiiiing!

The wave of detection swept through all directions. The power of magic, imbued with detection, continued to spread without stopping.

And it seemed to have no end.

Taesan stopped his detection, his tongue clicking in annoyance.

This place was incomparably vast, unlike anything on Earth.

And every inch of it was packed with monsters, leaving no empty space.

Just like Balbam's words, it was a layer designed to waste time.

"Can I finish this before I return?"

Taesan muttered to himself, taking a step forward.

* * *

And at the same time.

Iteayeon was biting her lip, her face filled with anxiety.

"Maria-nim is being too harsh, isn't she? She's being too cruel to her beloved mortal?"

Iteayeon grumbled, but soon shook her head.

"No, I have to try at least once. If not now, when will I?"

She steeled herself and took a step forward.

[72nd Floor Quest Begins.] [Pass the Trial of God.] [Reward: A belt made by the owner of the brutal space.] [Secret Reward:???]

As we passed through the 72nd floor corridor, a vast empty room came into view."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And there, a being was waiting.

It was a woman made of flames.

Lee Tae-yeon smiled faintly.

"Have you been waiting?"

[The Fire Spirit King, Vishnu, appeared.]

The Fire Spirit King.

Vishnu gazed at Lee Tae-yeon with a stiff, hardened face.

"You."

She sent a furious gaze towards Lee Tae-yeon.

"How dare you betray us?"

"Betrayal? I never collaborated with you in the first place. You forced me to follow you. That's not betrayal, is it?"

Lee Tae-yeon replied lightly, drawing his sword. He took a confident stance, ready for battle.

"No need to talk for long, let's get started."
