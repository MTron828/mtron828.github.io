Episode 277

277. Colosseum (2)

It was a number beyond expectation. Kim Whiyuen thought that if half of the players survived, it would be a blessing.

With 100 players, it wasn't unusual to have two or three hardcore players. It meant that Korean hardcore players had defeated them and won.

"I was surprised too. Other country players are strong, but... it wasn't that difficult."

The winners were also astonished. They thought that hardcore players from other countries had similar strength to theirs.

But when they actually fought, it wasn't the case. There was a clear power gap between them and Korean players.

Kim Whiyuen realized late.

"Ah, that's right. We received help from Taesan...…."

God's grace.

That one thing was not small. The blessing of struggle and death increased their talent for battle, and their concentration in combat changed.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"As a result, Korea was about two to three levels ahead of players from other countries. In hard mode, the difference was palpable.

"Not bad."

She looked around at the people and asked, "Has anyone met Amelia?"

"……."

There was no response. Kim Hu-yeon wasn't surprised, as she had expected it. If someone had met Amelia, it would mean they had beaten her, which was nearly impossible.

"How strong is she?"

Amelia Airin, the woman who cleared the alone mode. Even they were curious about her strength.

They would find out when they reached the end. Kim Hu-yeon changed the subject.

"So, what's the country's ratio?"

"The US was overwhelming. You hardly saw anyone from other countries."

"That's right...…."

The US had 150,000 hard mode players, a vastly different number.

"Hmm."

Kim Hu-yeon had a vague expression.

"Special rules... the second one...…."

"Why's that? Miss."

"No, it's pointless to mention it. And it might not even be true."

She shook her head dismissively."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Tae-san could guess what she was thinking. With her quick wit and sharp judgment, it was obvious.

And her thoughts were correct.

But there was no need to speak according to her words. Even if he knew, it was a situation where he couldn't respond.

Kim Hwi-yeon examined the faces of the remaining ones and asked,

"What about those who are left behind? Min-soo, where did this guy go?"

"Ah, I met him. He was struggling and panting, fighting with other hard modes, and I just ignored him."

"If I meet him again, I'll try to kill him?"

As they passed the time with idle chatter, the designated time suddenly arrived. The light began to envelop them, and their faces became serious again.

"Let's meet at the next location."

"Yes."

Tae-san moved again to the vast plain.

He opened his magic.

[You have activated the detection of the Leraje's domain.]

His magic spread out in all directions, and information entered his mind.

This time, there were 100 people. After this battle, only 106 out of 1.06 million people would remain.

Tae-san didn't move right away."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They walked leisurely across the plain. They could feel the presence of others moving around them from all directions.

And that movement was clearly different from the first battlefield.

They were systematic. They moved in groups, and started to eliminate those who were alone.

Before long, dozens of people were moving together, and only one person was left alone, Taesan.

And they began to approach Taesan.

Sensing their movement, Taesan sat down on a rock. Soon, he waved his hand at the people who were revealing themselves.

"Nice to meet you."

"……."

They surrounded Taesan.

Taesan checked their faces one by one.

"Are all of you Americans?"

"Yes."

The muscular man at the front nodded.

"We are using the optimal method to win. Don't resent us."

The man said, drawing his sword. The dozens of people behind him also drew their weapons.

Taesan smiled and looked at them.

"Right. Oliver wouldn't miss this opportunity."

Special rule. The second one.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The country with the most players remaining when the quest ends will receive additional points.

In other words, it was beneficial to eliminate players from other countries. And the United States had the most players in the world.

Even if it was randomly assigned, it was natural that the majority of players on the battlefield would be from the United States.

And most American players were able to work together to eliminate players from other countries first.

"As expected, they're smart. There must be a reason why they survived until the end."

What happened after the quest ended? Did Oliver survive?

Taesan couldn't know. After clearing the quest, he couldn't know what happened in other countries. He was too busy trying to survive himself.

As Taesan sat on a rock, muttering to himself, Liam, a muscular man, scowled at him.

"You're too calm."

The players from other countries they had met so far were shocked to see them working together, their faces red with anger as they shouted.

"This is cheating! This can't be happening!"

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"All those who won on the first battlefield were hard mode players. Dozens of hard mode players joined forces, and no matter how hard an individual tried, they couldn't win.

Liam didn't have any special thoughts about it.

The numerical advantage was a clear power. There was no problem with using that to win.

If they had any complaints, they could just survive and live on.

The plan was to finish off the remaining players and have the survivors fight each other to determine the final winner. It was all over once the man in front of them fell.

But something was off. Only then did Liam notice the yellow cloth hanging on Taesan's shoulder.

"...Who are you?"

"What are you talking about? Just die!"

The three men who had been waiting behind Liam charged at Taesan simultaneously, their eyes bloodshot.

"Be a stepping stone for the great America!"

The hard mode trio's attack was swift and precise. With Taesan's current health at 100, even one hit would be fatal.

But Taesan didn't move, even when the opponents rushed towards him.

As he watched the enemies closing in, his hand moved the moment the sword was about to strike his head.

Kwajik."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"The three of them, who had been rushing at him, were instantly crushed. Liam's pupils, which had been watching the scene unfold, widened.

There was no sign of the fist's movement.

And then, the damage window appeared.

[4355 damage to Jackson.] [5332 damage to Lucas.] [4123 damage to Grayson.]

"You...".

"I am Gang Tae-san."

Tae-san smiled and stood up, causing a ripple effect among the onlookers.

"Show me. Show me the violence of your proud numbers."

* * *

Tae-san took a step forward. In that instant, they lost sight of his movement.

Quack.

Tae-san, who had descended from the sky, trampled the head of the hard player.

The player whose head was trampled disappeared.

They were unable to move and were defeated.

Liam shouted belatedly.

"Everyone, move!"

Boom boom boom!

They all quickly distanced themselves from Tae-san. A woman who had been standing next to Tae-san tried to turn around and run away, but her head was caught by Tae-san.

"Where are you going?"

Tae-san slammed her to the ground. The woman's movements stopped.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

Taesan didn't stop. He pierced the backs of those who tried to create distance with his fists. In an instant, over ten players disappeared.

"What the...!"

Liam was shocked. With just one move, over ten players fell. Each and every one of them was a hard-mode player!

Taesan waved his hand. He could have taken them all down at once, but he chose not to. He wanted to see their skills.

They gritted their teeth and started pressing Taesan from all sides.

"Not bad."

Taesan murmured. All eighty of them were hard-mode players, but their skills were slightly lower than those of Korean players. However, they weren't bad.

But that was it.

There was no need to draw a sword or use skills.

Just overwhelming power and speed.

Taesan swept aside the man's attitude and sent him flying far away. The man's hand bent, and his body rolled across the plain.

Whack!

Taesan's fist pierced the man. Taesan turned around and kicked him away. The man who had been targeting Taesan's back rolled across the plain, still in a defensive posture.

Whoosh!

Taesan stomped his foot.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

The ground explodes. Those who were running towards it suddenly lose their footing and stumble.

A strong gust of wind blows. They can't withstand the wind that has risen and are blown away.

[Dealt 934 damage to Logan.]

Liam was incredulous.

"What the...?!"

It wasn't even a punch that hit him. It was just a simple gust of wind. Yet, an unimaginable damage of 1000 was inflicted.

It was an unacceptable situation, but it was happening. Taesan was knocking down those who were stunned one by one.

"Just once!"

Liam shouted desperately.

"If I can just land one attack!"

Even if it's just the tip of the sword or a grazing punch, it's enough. They are hard-mode players. If they use their skills, they can easily deal 100 points of damage.

The faces of those who were confused by that fact became calm. Their movements changed. They moved to kill Taesan, even if it meant becoming unable to act themselves.

"It's useless, though."

Even if their attacks land, the attack invalidation skill will activate. There is no possibility of them defeating Taesan.

He knocks away the swinging sword and kicks it away. He counters the punch flying towards his face and sends it back.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Dozens of them attacked Taesan at once, but not a single attack hit him.

Their experience and stats were overwhelming, but Taesan was unstoppable, even in hard mode. They couldn't do anything against Taesan, who didn't even use a single skill.

"I've got a rough idea of his level."

Taesan opens his hand, and a chilling cold begins to spread. Liam, feeling the ominous atmosphere, hastily shouts.

"Everyone, get back..."

[You have activated the Frozen World.]

Zzzt!

The cold spreads, and the players respond to Taesan's power. Some try to protect themselves with skills, while others try to melt the ice with magic. Some try to run away, but it's no use.

The cold freezes them all equally.

Only Liam is left.

Liam looks at Taesan with a blank expression.

"This is...".

Liam thought that even if Taesan was strong, he was still within the bounds of common sense. He believed that he could never reach Amelia's level.

But this was out of bounds.

Taesan deals an unbelievable amount of damage, thousands of points at once, and continuously. This was what Taesan's normal damage looked like."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He's even stronger than Amelia. Liam realized that fact.

"Are you really... human?"

Those were his last words. Taesan's fist headed towards his head. When he came to his senses, he found himself summoned to the Losers' Plaza.

* * *

[Quest Complete] [You have become the winner.] [Settling... ] [You earned 380 points.] [Returning to the Winner's Area.]

380 points. It was a relatively high score, probably because all the opponents were hard-mode players, unlike the first space.

Looking around, there was still no one in sight. Taesan waited quietly.

After a while, Lee Tae-yeon appeared, panting and catching her breath.

"Phew, we barely won."

Soon after, Gang Jun-hyuk also appeared, with a similarly exhausted face.

[All winners have been determined. Moving on to the next battlefield in one hour.]

"Taesan, something's weird. The American guys seem to have lost their minds..."

Lee Tae-yeon muttered, looking around and making a worried expression.

"What? Why are we the only ones here?"

"They all got knocked out, I suppose."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan replied. Late to realize the meaning, Lee Taeyeon's face distorted.

"...... Really?"

"You'll know if you look around?"

"It's crazy."

Lee Taeyeon muttered blankly. She also knew why this had happened.

"Damn special rules. Why did they create such a thing?"

"The reason is obvious."

Taesan raised the corner of his mouth.

The special rule that didn't exist in the previous life was added somehow.

The reason was simple. The God of Fall didn't want Taesan and Amelia to meet. They wanted to take down Taesan somehow before that.

So, they made the physical strength 100 and removed the defense. They even added a rule that gives additional rewards to the country with the most players left at the end, so that the American players can team up to remove Taesan.

"But it's a bit disappointing. You're trying to kill me with just this?"

Trying to take down Taesan, who is in hard mode, is a sloppy plan even if it's directly planned by a god.

"Is there something you're aiming for?"

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was also a possibility that Amelia would aim for me when we met directly. If Amelia were to defeat me herself, she would become even more arrogant.

But it wasn't a bad story for Taesan either.

If God does something directly, it means that many things can be gained.

It was the first time that the transcendent being had tried to crush himself like this.

So, I looked forward to it. The time to meet Amelia."
