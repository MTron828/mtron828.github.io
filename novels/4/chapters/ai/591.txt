Chapter 592

592. Outer Story, Mashin (4)

"We are the demon race. We were supposed to rule over the demon world and be the masters of this place."

[But it was Mashin who created this place.]

"No. This planet was born naturally in the universe. Mashin just tainted it with his own domain."

The man knew the history of how the demon world came to be.

The man clenched his fist, his hand trembling with anger.

"We were born here. This is our land."

With a voice filled with determination, the man declared, "We will not back down."

"We will reclaim our hometown. We will return to our rightful place as a species!"

[Is that so.]

Ba'al showed no particular reaction, only asking in a calm tone.

[Do you think it's possible?]

"It's impossible with my power alone... but it's possible. I have a card for that."

[A card, you say.]

"The Savior left, and a miracle came down."

[How ridiculous.]

Ba'al let out a small chuckle.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Is this broken device also one of your cards?]

“Yes. It’s still under preparation, but it’s almost done. Come back in a few days, and I’ll explain everything to you then.”

[Whatever, do as you like.]

Baal stood up.

The two of them left the small model garden. Baal asked Taesan,

[How do you think it will turn out?]

“It will fail.”

The man is strong.

He has the power to be called immortal.

But that’s all.

Baal chuckled.

[This small model garden has experienced countless destructions. There have been many such destructions.]

Leaving the small model garden that protects himself, he advances to grasp the vast world in his hand.

And in the end, he meets a miserable destruction.

[The talented ones always appear. He is strong. This small model garden has overflowing power that it can’t contain. But that’s all. That level of talent has appeared dozens of times already.]

They all went out to save the demon tribe, saying they would do so.

And they died.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Like a child who builds a sandcastle as tall as themselves and rejoices as if they've accomplished something great, they overestimate their own power and underestimate the greatness of the outside world.]

"What do you plan to do?"

[Nothing.]

Ba'al said lazily.

"I'm not doing anything. I'm just watching. It's not like I can have a significant impact at that level. It's just a simple amusement. If it's destroyed... I'll just make it again. That's all there is to it.]

Taesan silently gazed at Ba'al.

He was stronger than Ba'al.

The difference in their levels was clear.

That's why he could understand Ba'al's mental state.

He read the distortion and contradiction in Ba'al's words.

And a few days later,

Taesan and Ba'al found themselves back at the model garden. The man was waiting with a tired face.

"You're here."

* * *

[So, is your pathetic preparation finally over?]

"There are still many parts that need to be fixed, but it's basically complete."

[So, what do you plan to do? Let's hear it.]

In response to Ba'al's words, the man spoke in a subdued tone.

"I am strong."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It wasn't just an empty boast. In this narrow, cramped environment where it's impossible to accumulate proper experience, I reached the realm of immortality. That in itself speaks to the level of talent I possess as a man."

"But I'm not strong enough to surpass the outside world."

[Hmm.]

Baal's face shows interest.

[I see.]

"I've searched for many things. I've uncovered numerous pieces of information about those who were destroyed before we settled here. As a result, I'm well aware that this place has been destroyed multiple times."

The man's face distorts, filled with feelings of powerlessness and despair.

"And there are many others who have made the same choice as me."

The man's talent, which occasionally appears, is undeniable.

"To cover the vast universe, it's impossible at my level. It's not just about individual strength, but about having an impact on the universe itself."

Not just a simple immortal.

A being that governs the concept of the universe.

I must reach the realm of the conceptual gods. Only then can I shake the demon world.

The man's face is tinged with powerlessness.

"But that's... impossible here."

To become a being that governs the concept of the universe, I need to accumulate enough power and achievements.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"After experiencing many things, fighting against the strong, and risking one's life, one must...

But all of that is impossible in this small model garden.

"Even if someone with the talent to reach the transcendent realm is born, they won't be able to bloom and will wither away. That's why I changed my mind."

The man laughed. His laughter was tinged with madness.

"I'll force that flower to bloom!"

[How ridiculous.]

Baal sneered.

[Do you think you can force it to bloom? If it were that easy, this universe would be filled with transcendent beings.]

The transcendent being is one who governs the concept of the universe itself.

It's not something that can be created by others. It must be born alone and uniquely. The man nodded as if he knew.

"I know. It's impossible for a weak existence like me to bloom. Normally, that is."

The man smiled quietly.

"Don't you know, Baal-nim? There are also flowers that bloom not with one's own power, but with the power of others."

[……Faith God.]

The transcendent realm reached through faith. Faith God.

Note: "Baal-nim" is a polite way of addressing Baal, and "Faith God" is a term that seems to refer to a deity or a higher power that is reached through faith.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If that's the case, it would have been possible, but Baal shook his head.

[But it's also impossible. How can we accumulate enough faith?]

Their numbers are extremely small.

Even if we gather everyone's faith, we can't obtain the faith worthy of a god. Even if we somehow manage to achieve it, it would be too weak, and we couldn't even call it a god, it's that fragile.

"I don't deny it. It's the only way, but it's also impossible. So, I've thought a lot and found a method, and finally, I did it."

The man wore a distorted smile.

"I will curse you. Save us, Lord."

* * *

[It's a curse.]

Baal laughed.

"Let's hear it. How grand a plan have you prepared?"

He didn't think much of the man's plan. He was just an immortal, and the plan he came up with in this narrow space couldn't be that grand.

The man said."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power of faith grows stronger as the number of believers increases and their faith deepens. It becomes even more powerful when it's collective faith.

Taesan once received faith from all beings on a planet. Although their numbers weren't great, they gained immense power due to the uniqueness of being revered by all beings on the planet.

"The demon race is just one species."

Like humans, dwarves, or elves, they were a distinct species born in the universe.

"Then, what kind of power would the demon race, as a species, gain if they received faith?"

The unified faith of all demons in this universe.

If they received that collective worship, what level could they reach?

The answer wasn't difficult.

That power and prestige would even reach the conceptual gods. Baal stroked his chin, looking interested.

[Then... it's possible. But it's impossible. Your numbers are too few. If you want to achieve it, you'll have to receive worship even from demons living as livestock. Moreover, it's impossible with ordinary faith.]

You'll have to send a faith that values something more deeply than your own life, a faith that's truly eternal and immortal.

[How do you plan to solve those problems?]

"I don't plan on going to receive worship."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The man said calmly.

"They didn't have wisdom, so I desire a faith for the future."

[…….]

A spark of curiosity appeared on Baal's face for a moment.

[Future?]

"It's a curse. Savior, please. From now on, all demons born will have absolute faith in someone. That faith will be more precious than their own lives. They will receive absolute faith that will never waver, no matter what they lose or are abandoned."

The man's face turned red as he passionately exclaimed.

"The demon tribe's god of faith will be born! It will save and lead us, an absolute existence!"

It's not that one becomes a god by obtaining faith, but rather one becomes a god by being promised faith.

It was a kind of paradox. Baal scrunched up his face.

[The theory sounds plausible, but there's a huge problem. How do you plan to cast that curse? You'll have to pay a price worthy of receiving a promise of future faith.]

"I will offer the present as a sacrifice."

[Present?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I've already obtained consent from everyone. If we were to sacrifice all demons existing in this universe, we could place a curse on our own kind itself."

[Consent is something we can't obtain anyway.]

There are many demons living as livestock outside. The man shook his head, seemingly unable to understand Baal's words.

"What are you saying, Lord Savior? Their consent is not necessary."

[What's that supposed to mean.]

"They're livestock. They don't have intelligence, and they act on instinct. They don't even have a proper language. And yet, we couldn't even obtain their consent."

[…….]

From the start, those distorted, broken livestock.

They don't have the qualifications to give consent, nor do they have intelligence or dignity.

So, their consent is not necessary.

The demons with intelligence existing in this universe, the demons who can have faith, were all the ones in this small model garden.

By sacrificing the present, we can obtain faith for the future. This was the only possible method for the current demons. Baal was astonished to realize that it was possible.

[Amazing.]

Baal was purely amazed. It was the first time a man had reached this solution after a long, long time.

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But the problem still remains. You will all die. Your souls will be bound to the demon tribe forever and never be free."

A curse about the future.

It's not something that can be easily obtained. The demon tribe, with all their current intelligence, will scatter and engrave their souls.

You will never be able to attain eternal peace. You will not be able to be reborn again.

"It doesn't matter. That part has already been agreed upon."

"And there's an even bigger problem. A being with such faith will be extremely powerful."

The faith of the tribe itself.

If one obtains that faith, they will not be inferior to the conceptual gods. It's no exaggeration to say that they will govern the concept of the demon tribe. They will become one of the transcendent beings in the universe.

"And to obtain such power, one must have the corresponding qualifications. If not, they will simply become a madman consumed by power."

It's not the position that makes the person.

Only those who are qualified to sit in that position from the start can achieve it.

"That's also impossible for you."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The faith of the species. Even if you receive it, it's impossible to have a complete mental state at the level of an immortal. You had to have the talent to reach the transcendent level from the beginning.

[Those who have already reached the transcendent realm are impossible.]

They are alone and unadulterated. Even if they reach the realm through faith, it's only distorted.

In the end, it means you have to find a vessel that can become a transcendent being while being mortal, which is an impossible task. Baal asked without expectation.

[What do you plan to do about that problem?]

"I already said so. A miracle has descended."

The man stood up from his seat.

"Follow me."

The man took Baal and Taesan to the center of the village.

He rolled up his sleeves and released the seal, and then began to descend underground.

"Look."

The man proudly spread his arms wide.

"This is our miracle."

And at the center of the underground, there was a girl.

A black-haired girl.

Her languid, black eyes gazed at them, and Baal's face stiffened for the first time.

"I've never seen anyone like you two before."

The soft voice of the girl resonated.

"One is unusual... and one is unknown. What are you? You're neither this nor that."

An ordinary girl who didn't feel anything out of the ordinary.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But Baal could see it. The possibility that the girl possessed. The girl smiled brightly.

"It's nice to meet you. My name is Lucifer.""
