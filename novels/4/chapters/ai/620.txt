Chapter 621

621. Outer Story, The Mage of the Labyrinth (4)

"You're saying it's artificial? That sounds like a bad thing. It's a reward for those who have conquered the dungeon. If you want a different reward, I'll give it to you."

[But isn't that what you're saying? You're talking about your domain.]

The man didn't deny it and shrugged his shoulders. Arilnan burst out laughing.

[Hahaha... A transcender creating a transcender? That's crazy. Many transcendents have tried before, but they all failed. Do you think it's possible?]

"The reason they failed is because they're already beings who dominate concepts. No matter how strong they make their own servants, they ultimately desire something that's already dominated by a concept. It's impossible for them to become transcendents. But this place is a blank domain. There's no concept to speak of."

If a qualified person appears, they can become a transcendent. Arilnan also knew that fact. She laughed and asked.

"Then, it's inevitable that we criticize. To become the master of a realm, one must ultimately possess the qualifications to do so.

Even if you can't dominate a concept, you must have the strength to not be defeated.

You must surpass the ordinary gods and immortals.

[Does that mean that if you conquer my dungeon, you can reach that level?]

"That's how I'll design it. I need your cooperation to make it happen."

A space created with the cooperation of numerous transcenders.

If you perfectly conquer that space, you'll surely reach the realm of transcendence. The magician had planned to design it that way from the beginning.

[If someone who has reached that level appears, won't you lose everything?]

The dungeon is a vast, empty realm created by a man.

If you give it to him, he'll be left with nothing.

But the man laughed heartily.

"That's what I wanted."

[Is that so.]

Arilnan thought with a chuckle.

He gathers valuable mortals from across the universe.

And they stake their lives to challenge the dungeon.

He watches over their lives, struggles, and deaths."

Let me know if you have any further requests!

"[It's going to be interesting, isn't it? Yeah, you're hoping for that.]

I watch the adventures of mortals and enjoy their growth and death.

That's a man's desire.

But as the god of adventure, I couldn't enjoy it. Because, as the owner of the concept of adventure itself, I knew exactly how their adventures would end.

So, I abandoned the concept of adventure and recreated my own domain.

[You're thinking of realizing your desired adventure in the form of a dungeon, aren't you?]

"That's how it'll be."

[It's a fascinating idea. If it's realized according to your plan, your emptiness will disappear. But abandoning your domain and seeking the cooperation of transcendents is... ]

Arilnan laughed joyfully.

[You're the first transcendent to come to the same conclusion. I doubt there will be anyone else like you in the future.]

"If you're satisfied, that's fortunate. Arilnan-nim will have to become a great collaborator."

[It seems like a cycle is necessary.]

"Ultimately, it's a limited space, after all."

The dungeon is an empty domain."

"In order for the cycle of life and structure to take place within it, Arin's cooperation was essential. Since she governs the cycle of all things, if one can grasp that concept, the design becomes overwhelmingly easy.

[The loss is great, but... it'll be fun. Really fun.]

Arin murmurs. She gazes at the man with sparkling eyes, nodding her head.

[Good. You were a god of adventure. You won't cooperate with me.]

The man smiles.

* * *

The man grasped the concept of the cycle.

The empty space slowly began to cycle. The man laughed in satisfaction.

But it didn't end there.

A dungeon had to be created here.

It was a dungeon so difficult and complex that even mortals could reach the realm of the transcendent.

The concept of the cycle alone was impossible. Many concepts were needed.

The man went to find other transcendent beings and said,

"I'm creating a grand dungeon."

"I want to summon numerous warriors and heroes from across the universe to break through it."

"I want to watch their struggles and battles, and their fleeting deaths."

"If you wish, I can directly observe their struggles and choose the one who pleases me as my disciple."

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The God of Struggle and Death. Rakiratas accepted it with a smile. He was so willing to hand over his domain that the man was taken aback.

The God of Choice also accepted it with great interest, without much hesitation. She asked if she could watch over the adventurers searching for the dungeon one by one, and the man accepted it as a matter of course.

The God of Victory seemed a bit hesitant, but he accepted it with interest.

In addition, he received the cooperation of numerous gods and obtained their domains.

Unfortunately, he was unable to obtain Death.

He went to see Dersha, but she couldn't understand why she had to waste her domain on such a thing.

As someone who had transcended from birth, she had emotions closer to a device than to life.

It would have been much easier to design if he could obtain Death itself, which was unfortunate.

However, he obtained the domain of death that occurs through struggle, so it wasn't a big problem.

After that, he mixed and matched various domains to create a single form. Although it was a fragment, it required considerable effort since each universe had a different concept.

And so, a long time passed.

"It's done.""
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The area that shimmers with rainbow colors, where even the fundamentals cannot be found, has been completed.

The man laughed with joy. This is just the beginning. This place needs to be remodeled into a dungeon.

The structure is a labyrinth. The hierarchy will be changed to 10 floors. The depth will be determined as we design it.

However, it's difficult for him to handle everything alone.

An administrator is needed to assist him and manage the labyrinth.

The man snapped his fingers.

"Come out."

Ku-ku-ku-ku-gung......

A device is born in the distorted area. A being made of metal slowly reveals its form.

"Your name is Balbambara. Help me manage this place."

[As the master wishes.]

Balbambara replied quietly.

The man, who was sitting in the rainbow-colored area, tapped his chin.

How should we design the labyrinth?

The overall framework is set, but the specific details have not been decided.

First, we need a reward for the labyrinth. A visible carrot is necessary.

And that carrot must not be obtainable anywhere else.

Only if it can be obtained here will strong individuals gather.

The man traveled the universe to find that reward.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And I found an interesting concept in a world where magic was replaced by machines and technology.

"A system, perhaps."

In that world, there was a virtual world. There, human abilities were displayed as numbers and quantified under the name "stats".

There were special skills to master, and equipment to strengthen oneself.

It was a concept that could only be obtained in the virtual world, impossible in reality.

But if this distorted space could bring such a system into reality...

"Good."

There was nothing that captivated people as much as visible, quantified strength. I decided to make it the basic system of the labyrinth.

So, I invested a considerable amount of time in setting up the system in the labyrinth and conceptualizing the numbers.

And finally, the basic structure was complete.

Now it was time to design the floors.

"What should I do?"

The man muttered to himself with a smile. He didn't think of making the first floor too easy. He would put his all into each floor.

First, the first floor wouldn't be too difficult..."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not just the strong ones who gather. Those who have talent but lack extraordinary power will also come. They too can defeat monsters if they give it their all.

The man traveled the entire universe to find suitable life forms.

And several years later...

"I've found them."

It was a giant rat.

A beast that lived in a twisted forest on a planet, extremely intelligent and fast. Even talented humans would have to give it their all to defeat this monster.

This beast would be sufficient as a monster for the first floor.

He released dozens of them into the first floor of the labyrinth.

Then, what would be good for the second floor?

He traveled the universe again.

The process wasn't boring or tedious. On the contrary, it was enjoyable and he couldn't help but look forward to it. This labyrinth would exist for an eternity, and he would make it enjoyable.

And he would create such a space.

What's boring about creating such a space?

After traveling the universe, the man found what he was looking for.

On a planet, goblins had started a war.

Their goal was to conquer the world.

With a intelligent, speaking goblin as their leader, they charged forward and trampled the world."

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The goblin attempted to conquer the world. It was a rare sight even for an old man who had lived for a long time.

However, in the end, the goblin was defeated by the combined forces of humans and was chased all the way to the forest on the outskirts.

After watching the entire process, when only a few hundred goblins were left, the old man revealed himself.

"Hello?"

The goblin, startled by the sudden voice, swung its large sword wildly and kept its distance. The old man calmly observed its behavior.

The goblin, with a wary gaze, opened its mouth.

"Human?"

"What do you want?"

"......No."

The goblin lowered its sword. The old man asked,

"What's your name?"

"I'm Goblin Lord, Gemusu."

"Gemesu. You've lost. In a few hours, humans will raid this place and kill all of you. Do you understand?"

"I understand. We wanted to conquer the world and create our own, but we failed in the end."

What an ambitious goblin. It was indeed unusual.

The old man, who had been gazing at the goblin for a moment, spoke up.

"Would you like to enter the labyrinth?"

"......What are you talking about all of a sudden?"

The old man explained about the labyrinth. Gemusu listened silently to the story."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When you enter the labyrinth, you can become the master of the layer you're in. You can even kill outsiders who intrude."

"But you can also be killed by them. Is that what we're hoping for? A being that governs the labyrinth's layers?"

"You're right again. That's the correct answer."

"Why do I have to accept this?"

"It's better to die with a purpose here than to die meaninglessly. At least there, you can get the death you desire. You can live a life close to eternity until you're defeated. And you can also train yourself."

Being trapped in the labyrinth is equivalent to becoming a part of the realm.

As long as the labyrinth itself doesn't collapse, Gem-Su's soul won't disappear.

"......What about refusal?"

"Do as you please. I won't force you. I'll just leave."

Gem-Su smiled wryly. They were already at their wit's end. All they could do was put up a final resistance, but even that would be meaningless and lead to their downfall.

"There's no choice. I'll accept it."

"Excellent choice."

The man smiled faintly.

The contract was made.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The goblins, including Gemae-su, were in charge of the 2nd floor of the labyrinth.

If they become even stronger, they may be able to climb to deeper levels.

For them, death is not complete death. It's just the death of the physical body. The soul will circulate within the labyrinth and be reborn in another form.

Of course, as they lose their physical bodies, their memories will not remain, but the experiences etched into their souls will influence their actions.

It will be interesting to see what changes the monsters in charge of each floor will bring about.

That too will be a joy.

The design of the labyrinth is slowly taking shape."
