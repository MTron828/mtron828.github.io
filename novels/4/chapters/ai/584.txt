**Chapter 585**

**585. Extra Story, Cleanup (3)**

Ku-gu-gu-gung….

It was as if a meteorite had fallen, and numerous craters were scattered across the ground. The change in the terrain was so significant that it could be seen from space.

And the ones who had caused such a phenomenon were only two women.

“Huk, huk.”

Amelia was gasping for breath. A sword was stuck right at the base of her neck.

“…Surrender.”

Amelia shook her head.

Iteyeon smiled faintly and pulled out the sword.

“Good job.”

“You still can’t win.”

“I came down more, but I couldn’t win. It’s still very dangerous. You said it was a boundary, right? That really gets on my nerves.”

The absolute superiority of the Saint. There was no choice but to block it. The methods to counter it were extremely limited, and as someone who wasn’t a Transcender, she had no other option.

Still, in a pure fight, Iteyeon had the upper hand. Above all, she was also a disciple of Maria. Even with the boundary, she wouldn’t be easily pushed back.

Above all, Lee Tae-yeon had a card that only she possessed.

"Everything else is fine, but how can I not eat that?"

Amelia grumbled as she got up.

"What's with the thousand possibilities? What's that?"

During battles, it allowed her to instantly check a thousand possibilities and choose the optimal move. It was a skill that enabled her to make nearly perfect moves, as if mistakes didn't exist in battles.

It was truly an unbelievable skill. When fighting against Lee Tae-yeon, who possessed this skill, it felt like all her actions were being read, and she was being countered even before she made a move.

It was probably true in reality as well. Lee Tae-yeon must have checked the possibilities in advance.

It wasn't just a matter of being one or two steps ahead; she was a thousand steps ahead, making it impossible to pressure her.

Moreover, the skill's cooldown time wasn't long either. Thanks to the "thousand exclusions" skill, it was as if there was no cooldown time at all.

It was unthinkable that Lee Tae-yeon, with that skill, would lose to anyone.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lee Tae-yeon smiled faintly. Although she still lacked proficiency, with 10,000 attempts, the limit of this skill was 10,000 possibilities. It was her proud skill.

Amelia's eyes shone with desire.

"How did you get it? I want to get it too."

"Uh... I don't know how to explain it."

Lee Tae-yeon scratched her head, looking troubled. It wasn't that she didn't want to explain, but she really couldn't.

"Even if I explain, you might not be able to get it? This is a unique skill that I, Lee Tae-yeon, have acquired."

The condition for acquiring a skill in the labyrinth was to directly perform an action similar to the effect of that skill.

And what action to take in each situation was different for each person. Therefore, many labyrinth adventurers had their own unique skills that others couldn't possess.

Even the guides of the evil path had their own unique skills.

The 10,000 possibilities represented Lee Tae-yeon as a person. It was a skill that only she could acquire.

"Taesan couldn't get it in the end either. I guess you'll find it difficult too?"

The skill that Lee Tae-yeon had acquired was precisely the 10,000 possibilities. It was almost impossible for others to acquire. Even Taesan, who had worked tirelessly, couldn't get it in the end.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a kind of wall that couldn't be helped, where Kang Tae-san was Kang Tae-san and Lee Tae-yeon was Lee Tae-yeon.

"...That's right."

Amelia's eyes sparkled. Lee Tae-yeon, who guessed what she was thinking, smiled wryly.

"Want to try? I won't stop you. I'll tell you the conditions."

"I can't not try."

Kang Tae-san couldn't acquire a skill, but she had obtained it. It was an unprecedented achievement.

"There's no need to try so hard. Don't you have your own unique skill?"

Amelia had acquired a skill because she was Amelia.

She must have had it too.

"I do, but it's not very useful against you guys. It's not that special, and it's simple."

"It's not useful against us?"

Lee Tae-yeon tilted his head. Come to think of it, he had never seen her use her own skill properly.

"What is it? I'm curious."

"I'm too embarrassed to say it out loud. Anyway, the condition to acquire a thousand possibilities. I'll tell you later. Try it once."

"Okay. But are there many skills to acquire besides this?"

"There are many... I suppose?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan told them about most of the skill acquisition methods he had obtained.

Additionally, there were skills like time stop, multiplication, forced duel, and endurance. There were many skills that required specific conditions.

The problem was that fulfilling those conditions was almost impossible.

"How did you get that?"

"I heard that forced duel and endurance were obtained at the entrance of the labyrinth. I don't know how to get them now, but I did manage to get a few."

"I want to get them all. I'll risk my life to try......"

"Think about it calmly? We have plenty of time, don't we?"

"That's true."

Amelia smiled faintly.

They really had a lot of time. Whatever they did from now on was up to them.

"Okay, let's try again."

"Again? Aren't you tired?"

"I'm not tired from just one try."

Amelia's determination ignited, and she grasped her sword. Taesan shook his head and got into position.

Amelia put strength into her legs, preparing to jump at Taesan.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The sky split open. Amelia froze.

"What's going on?"

"Huh?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lee Tae-yeon looked up at the sky with a blank expression.

"...A spaceship?"

* * *

"Wait, just a minute!"

"What's that?!"

The clouds parted, and it revealed its appearance.

A massive iron lump, blocking the sun, slowly descended to the ground.

People panicked and rushed to Kim Hwi-yeon.

"Mr. Kim Hwi-yeon! What is that?!"

"I don't know either!"

Kim Hwi-yeon also looked bewildered. It was something he had never seen before.

"Uh, a spaceship?"

The iron-made object had a cylindrical shape. From the outside, several lights flickered, making it look like a spaceship.

"Ah."

"I think so."

"Tae-yeon! Amelia!"

Lee Tae-yeon and Amelia landed beside Kim Hwi-yeon with uncertain expressions.

"Is this your first time seeing it on Earth?"

"Is it not the first time? Didn't those weirdos come last time?"

"...Ah. I did, didn't I? I forgot."

"Do you two know what that is?"

"I don't know exactly, but I have a rough idea."

Amelia said, looking at the slowly descending iron lump.

"Don't you know that we're not the only ones in this universe?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

“……Ah.”

It was only then that Kim Hwi-yeon realized who they were.

“Aliens?”

“Can I say that?”

The giant tribe and the demon tribe, adventurers who had settled in the labyrinth. And the knights who had come to help them during their previous return.

When you think about it, they were all aliens. They themselves didn't realize it, but there were more connections than they thought. It was no surprise to find out that they were aliens now.

“What are those people doing here?”

“That's what we'll find out from now on.”

Lee Tae-yeon narrowed his eyes.

Ku-gu-gu-gung…….

The spaceship slowly descended. Kim Hwi-yeon barely managed to calm down the panicked people. Only a few hard-mode and alone-mode players stood in front of the spaceship.

Ku-gung.

And finally, the spaceship landed on the ground.

People held their breath and grasped their weapons.

Ki-ying.

And the door opened.

With the sound of footsteps, a figure appeared. Kim Hwi-yeon furrowed his brow.

“……A person?”
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The reason for the question mark was simple. It was because the opponent was wearing a mechanical armor suit. Amelia whistled.

"Wow, that's cool."

It was a sleek suit made of machinery, like something you'd see in a movie. You could roughly see the shape of the opponent's body, with the curves and contours visible.

The basic outline of the body wasn't much different from a human's.

The only difference was that they seemed to be around 2M tall.

Thud, thud.

There were ten of them, and they slowly walked up to stand in front of Kim Hwi-yeon. Kim Hwi-yeon tried to remain calm and opened his mouth.

"......Who are you people?"

Instead of an answer, the helmet opened.

What was revealed was a purple iris.

Skin as white as flour, and black hair that swayed. Except for the iris, they had the appearance of a beautiful woman.

"Who is your leader?"

The voice was clear and crisp. Kim Hwi-yeon regained his composure and tried to answer.

"Our leader is......"

"Excluding Taesan, of course."

"......"

Kim Hwi-yeon knew Taesan.

Kim Hwi-yeon turned around to look. Lee Tae-yeon, Amelia, and other players in the Alone mode nodded their heads.

"That's us."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Kim Hwi-yeon stepped forward and said,

The other person gazed at her for a moment, their bordeaux-colored pupils, like the universe, fixed on Kim Hwi-yeon.

"Is that so."

"Who are you people?"

Their attitude didn't seem hostile. A quiet voice soon followed.

"We are the Narians from the Acrosia system of the Fantaria galaxy. We're a species that analyzes the universe."

* * *

"Hmm."

The woman who introduced herself as a Narian tapped her finger on the wooden table.

"A wooden board. It's been a while."

A strange silence flowed. An Earthling and a Narian were together in an old building.

"A Narian. This is the first time I've seen one."

"Oh, you know about us? I heard we're from a peripheral planet."

"There's a place with a lot of information."

Lee Tae-yeon murmured. The Library of the Universe. It's a place where the god of knowledge has gathered all the information in the universe. It also contains information about the numerous species in the universe, including the Narians.

"Even on a universal scale, there aren't as many advanced species as you'd think."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The universe is chaotic and dangerous. On the other hand, the development of technology is extremely slow and stagnant. Only a handful of civilizations have properly understood the concept of physics.

Above all, most planets have gods.

The gods did not like mortals becoming stronger through unauthorized means.

In the end, only planets without gods could attempt to develop technology, but the chances of success were extremely low.

The absence of gods means that no one is watching over them.

Even if they managed to develop, there were many cases where they were destroyed by asteroid collisions, nearby supernovae explosions, or wars among themselves.

As a result, the civilizations that survived and focused on technology were mostly extremely advanced civilizations.

And the Narain people in front of us were the strongest among them.

Excluding transcenders and immortals, they were the strongest group in the universe. They were just extremely powerful individuals, but as a group, there was no stronger group than the Narain people in the entire universe.

"'They blocked even the sincere attacks of the high gods with their own power, without the help of transcenders and immortals.'

"'I know that well. It's an event that hasn't been widely known outside.'"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Those who grasp the galaxy, shake it, and use the energy of black holes. A species that even immortals cannot touch carelessly.

The strongest species in the universe. The Narians.

Lee Tae-yeon tilted her head.

"What's going on with you guys on Earth?"
