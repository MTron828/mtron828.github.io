Chapter 178

178. The World of the Arrogant Giant (4)

"......That's enough."

Umberak nodded reluctantly.

"That's not enough, though."

"Fine, then."

Tae-san returned to the village again.

Umberak, who had taken care of the wounded, returned to the estate with the soldiers.

Due to the sudden strengthening of the monsters and the resulting threats, Umberak had stayed up all night with his eyes open.

When everything was settled to some extent, he found Tae-san again.

"Ah, I'm sorry. At the time, I was too flustered to show respect. That's why I couldn't set an example."

Umberak bowed his massive body.

"You saved everyone from death. I thank you."

When considering the strength of the monsters, it was not unusual for a giant who had died on the battlefield to appear. However, thanks to Tae-san, everyone was able to escape with their lives, so as the lord, I am extremely grateful.

However, the gaze of his eyes as he looked at Tae-san was complex.

"Can I have a moment to talk?"

"That's fine."
Here is the translation of the text:

The giant sat down. Despite the difference in their sizes, Tai Shan had to tilt his head to meet the giant's gaze.

"We are... giants. I believed that there was no one stronger than us in the world."

Tai Shan was strong, but he thought that his strength couldn't reach them. So, he thought he had to protect them when he took them to the crack. However, this was a futile thought, a foolish judgment.

But Umbraak laughed with a sarcastic smile.

"First, show me your strength. You have the qualifications to meet our king. As I said earlier, it's impossible to block the crack without a power equivalent to a war god. You've shown me that kind of power, so now it's my turn to help."

Tai Shan nodded. Umbraak continued to speak.

"But it will take a little time. The palace is far and the king is busy, after all."

"It doesn't matter," Tai Shan replied. He had expected to wait for a few days from the beginning.

After a brief silence, Umbraak spoke up again.

"What makes you so strong?"

"You just keep fighting and winning, that's all," Tai Shan replied. Umbraak sent a complex gaze and asked again.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Are there many people who possess as much power as you?"

"Not many, but there are some stronger than me too."

Umberack's eyes widened in surprise.

"Stronger than you?"

"Not yet, that is."

At some point, he would be able to catch up, but at the current moment, the leaders of the guidance were holding powers that he couldn't match.

Umberack let out a mocking smile.

"What are we fighting for?"

A sense of disappointment and shock washed over him, as he realized that the world he knew and believed in was crumbling.

Staring blankly at the floor, he opened his mouth to speak.

"In the distant past, a giant who was heading towards the labyrinth was known. He was a warrior who was stronger and larger than anyone else. He headed towards the labyrinth and was gone for a long time. We thought he had conquered the labyrinth, but..."

Umberack's smile turned into a smirk.

"If your words are true, then that's not the case. He fell in the labyrinth."

"I was also shocked. You guys fought against gods, didn't you?"

Based on this story, the giants of the present are nothing but weaklings.
Here is the translation:

"That's a story we all know. It's about the giants of the world gathering to destroy the world, but they were defeated by the transcendent being."

If the transcendent being's power is what Taesan knows, it would be a nearly impossible feat. It's ridiculous to think that the descendants of those who achieved such a feat would be unable to even deal with a B-grade monster.

"Everyone thought that was just a legend. There was no one who really believed it. But if it's true, then... we must have forgotten something."

Umberak furrowed his brow.

"You said you came to our world by the will of the magical god."

"Yes."

"But we don't know anything about magic. Neither do most of the giants. If you think about it, it's a strange thing."

Umberak scowled.

"A very long time ago, I read almost-forgotten ancient books. They mentioned giants who can use magic."

I had forgotten it until now, but after hearing Taesan's words, I was able to recall it. Umberak realized that something was strange.

Note: I removed the unnecessary phrases and tried to make the translation more concise while keeping the original meaning intact.
Here is the translation of the text:

"There was a book that said magic existed in the past, but we didn't know about it. But now, no one knows about magic. Why is that?"

Umberak was taken aback, but Taesan could guess the reason.

"Whenever magic is used, it seems to have a negative impact."

Dead silence.

Suddenly, someone knocked on the door.

"Come in."

A maid with a very surprised face entered the room. Umberak sat up.

"What's going on?"

"Ah, Your Highness."

The maid swallowed hard and said:

"The war heroes have arrived."

"Hmm?"

Umberak's expression was visibly shocked.

"I thought we hadn't even had a day to communicate yet, but they're already here?"

Too fast.

It was still too early for the messenger to have arrived at the castle. It was an incomprehensible speed.

The maid nodded her head.

"Yes, and it's not just one person, but four."

Umberak's eyes widened.

Umberak rushed out of the room.

Following behind him, they headed towards the reception hall of the lord's mansion, where four giants were seen.

The giants all had their eyes covered with bandages. Umberak, having seen them, quickly knelt down.

"War heroes!"
Here is the translation of the text:

The giants with veiled eyes gazed at Umbra for a moment before shifting their gaze. Although they were wearing glasses, they did not feel any discomfort when looking at the mountain.

"'Human, our king has summoned you.'"

The giant nodded its head.

The war heroes put aside their reception at Umbra and prepared to leave for the palace immediately. Umbra was unable to alleviate his wistful feelings.

"'This is a pity. I was unable to treat the great warrior properly, even if it was just a small token of my appreciation.'"

Umbra handed a small pebble to the giant, who looked at it with a sorrowful face. From his perspective, the pebble was small, but it was as big as the giant's body.

"'This pebble is precious only to our world. It can be alloyed with any pebble and is harder than steel, yet it has elasticity. Take it.'"

"'Can I take it?'

"'You have saved our lives. This is a small price to pay.'"

Umbra smiled wryly. He bid farewell to the departing giant.

"'I wish I could see you again. Little warrior.'"

The war heroes and the giant left the city.

"'How long until we reach the palace?'

"'Doesn't matter.'"

The war hero wearing glasses stretched out his hand. A mysterious aura began to envelop them.

It was magic.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san grasped his fist. Their bodies jumped through space.

"Arrived. Human."

The surroundings had completely changed.

The place Tae-san had arrived at was a huge building inside, so huge that it made him look like an ant.

Tae-san scowled.

"I heard you forgot magic, didn't I?"

According to Umbra's words, the castle and his territory were quite far away. It was a sudden jump through space.

The space jump Tae-san had was incomparable to Umbra's Blink. The Great Sage remained calm and answered.

"We have paid the price for that. We have covered our eyes and limited our senses to prevent interference."

The Great Sages began to retreat one by one. Before they disappeared, they left a final word for Tae-san.

"Our king is waiting for you inside."

Tae-san was left alone in the wide corridor.

A ghost muttered to himself.

"So fast, so urgent, isn't it?"

"I'm not bad, I'm not bad."

Tae-san approached the huge door and pushed it lightly.

Clunk.

The door creaked open, revealing a vast battlefield inside.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the end of the throne was an old giant.

The giant had a face that looked like it had been exhausted, but an immense and unstoppable power was emanating from his body, filling the entire hall.

Tae-san instinctively knew this.

The giant in front of him was an immortal.

Tae-san naturally took a fighting stance. Given his bad memories of immortals, it was only natural for him to prepare.

The giant king looked at him and said lightly.

"I don't have any intention of doing anything to you, so there's no need to be cautious."

He looked tired and rubbed his temples.

"Rather, I'm grateful to the god of magic for giving me this opportunity."

The giant king showed no hostile intentions towards him. Tae-san relaxed, and the giant king continued to speak.

"Those gauntlets are familiar."

His gaze was directed at the gauntlets Tae-san was wearing.

The god of magic said that he had used those gauntlets before, and that they were the gauntlets that had been sealed with magic.

"A long time ago, there was the strongest being in our world. He was the most brutal of all, but no one dared to challenge him."

The giant king spoke like an old man telling an ancient story.
Here is the translation of the text:

There was a small one among us who was weakest and smallest, yet similar to humans in size. Everyone ignored and mocked him. But he didn't give up and gradually became stronger. Eventually, he defeated the tyrant and shattered his gauntlet to claim his spoils. Now, it's all just a old story.

It was unclear who the strong one was, but it was possible to guess who the weak one was.

'The God of Magic.'

The God of Magic was a giant.

The giant king, gazing at the vast mountain range, muttered to himself.

"Ah, you're the proxy of the gods, aren't you? If that weren't the case, the God of Magic wouldn't have sent you here."

"What do you mean by proxy?"

"The gods each have their own domain. Even if they're called gods, it's not easy to intervene in other domains. The gods who reside in the labyrinth are even more so."

This was a fact that the mountain range was aware of. After all, the gods who resided in the labyrinth had left the gods of the outside world alone until the mountain range conquered their domain.

"I've heard that they disappeared after a long time ago, but who would have thought they'd appear again? It seems that those peculiar existences are quite pleased with themselves."

The giant king stood up.

"Curious? Why did we become like this? How did we, who once surpassed even the transcendent ones, become so weak?"

The mountain range nodded its head.

(Note: There are some names and terms that may not be familiar to non-experts in Chinese culture, and some phrases may not be directly translatable to English. This translation aims to convey the general meaning and context of the text.)
Here is the translation of the text:

The Giant King departed from Daejeon, heading somewhere. Tai Shan followed behind.

Although the two had a tremendous difference in strength, Tai Shan was able to easily chase after the Giant King because something magical was processed within his body.

The Giant King said:

"We were a powerful existence. Not only was our physical strength formidable, but we were also close to the realm of mystery. That was the peak reached when the smallest giant became a god of magic."

The magic possessed by the god of magic was a power that could elevate its own level. One could see this by looking at the magic wielded by those who claimed to be magicians in the world of B-grade monsters. Their most outstanding magic was ranked as low-level magic in the labyrinth.

"We were strong. Even the Transcendent Being, who once attempted to crush us and make us his subordinate, was defeated by our power to the extent that he could not. But what we are now is something you also know well."

"Enough."

The strength was sufficient to defeat even B-grade monsters, but it was not absolute. It was far from reaching the level of their past achievements.
Here is the translation of the text:

"We have lost magic. Only a part of our innate abilities can change all our senses and receive my blessing to repel interference. The reason is that you too will probably guess it."

"Ah, a wise saying."

The mountain god murmured. The giant king, who was walking ahead, laughed mockingly.

"The wise are cunning. It's not easy to break us with just strength. We have been making people forget about our powers for over a thousand years, judging that it would be difficult for them to break us."

After a while, the two people arrived at a deep place in the palace, in front of a transparent curtain.

"Look at this."

Inside the curtain, a giant black sphere appeared.

The sphere was surrounded by countless writhing tentacles, emitting a disgusting appearance.

[A monster appeared.]

"It's not that the monster itself is very strong."

The giant king said.

"But the problem is the wave emitted by the monster."

The giant king's brow furrowed in pain. A subtle power was spreading from the writhing monster through the transparent curtain.

"Over 2,000 years ago, this monster came down to our world. Since then, it has been exerting influence over the entire planet, hindering our ability to use magic."

As the giant king was speaking, he suddenly turned his gaze towards the mountain god.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The closer this monster gets, the more intense its aura becomes. Even if it's a powerful and extraordinary giant, if it approaches me, it will all collapse. But you're fine, aren't you?"

"I'm not worried about that."

The Giant King laughed at the words of Tai Shan.

"Our ancestors have sealed this monster with magic and built a palace on top of it, managing it generation after generation. However, even in a sealed state, we couldn't completely eliminate the monster's aura. I, who am immortal, could only suppress it with my strength. But you, a human who hasn't even shed your mortal coil, don't seem to be affected by this aura at all. Isn't that strange?"

Note: Tai Shan is likely referring to a giant or a powerful being, and the Giant King is likely the ruler of a land or a kingdom. The conversation appears to be between two powerful beings discussing the nature of a monster and its aura.
