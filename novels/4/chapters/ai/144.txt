Chapter 145

145. Outside. God's Battlefield (1)

[Mid-level. Can you already give me that?]

"Yes, so I don't really understand. Are you serious?"

[The god of the sword and similar gods don't seem to make such jokes... Are you outside the rules? It's 30th level or higher magic, right?]

"Can you explain it to me a bit better?"

Tae-san waved his hand to interrupt their conversation.

"What does it mean to learn mid-level magic?"

[Ah, and now I see that you've never learned mid-level magic before. You've also tried using magic, so you should know. What level of magic is the beginner level?]

"I know it well."

The value of magic in the labyrinth was extremely high. Even with only beginner magic, it was possible to clear up to the 30th level.

Outside the labyrinth, the value of magic increases even more.

The magic users who saw the magic he used at the Be'zseta were shocked beyond words. In their world, the top-ranked magic user could only use it, or even couldn't cast it at all.

And that was just beginner magic.

So what level is mid-level magic?
Here is the translation of the text:

The ghost answered the question.

"It's a magic that can affect even the deep-seated. Simply put, do you have guides who have committed the same sin as you? They too are avoiding this magic."

"Hoo."

Taesan's eyebrow naturally rose.

It's a skill that can deal damage to those who have stepped into the deep-seated, and even to those who can cause physical interference with their emotions. If it can cause harm to the strong, it's definitely valuable.

Ririsu muttered with an ambiguous face.

"Originally, I thought it would take more than 50 floors, but..."

"Yeah. This guy is just too special."

"I'm fine with it, but it's true. It's just too good."

Ririsu grumbled. Taesan, who still had unanswered questions, asked again.

"So, what about the advanced level?"

Just by advancing from the first to the second level, the value is so different. It's clear that it would make a huge difference beyond that.

"Even only a few people in the guide's leadership can use it. It's a level where magic can be used to conquer the deep-seated. The rest who are not as good can't do it, but that's not the case."

"So, what about the highest level?"
Here is the translation of the text:

I don't know that far either.

The ghost shook its white hair.

[Even the one writing this can't see it. Is it even there in the first place? I don't know, but I don't think so.]

"That's something I'm not good at either..."

Lilis, with an ambiguous face, scratched her cheek. If she didn't even know if a hero who had dedicated his life to magic and a deep-level warrior existed, then it was truly a mysterious realm.

"Is it higher than the top-level skill?"

Tae-san had the top-level skill. He had the Eye of Ra's martial arts. The ghost was surprised that he got it, but it was not amazed by the skill itself.

It meant that he already knew about the existence of top-level skills. It was unexpected that he didn't know about the existence of top-level magic.

The ghost spoke calmly.

[Magic is harder to learn than a simple skill and is more valuable. Skills or martial arts can be approached by anyone, but magic is cut off from the beginning by talent. And among them, it's the top-level.]

"Is it above the deep level?"

[I don't know. I've met some saints of the magic god, but I've never met anyone who can use top-level magic.]

Note: The text appears to be a dialogue between several characters, including a ghost, a hero, and a warrior, and it seems to be discussing the nature of magic and its difficulty.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san settled the matter there. Although he was curious and asked, he didn't have the interest to delve deep.

"So, when can I learn intermediate magic?"

"Not yet. When the time is right, God will send a test, and if you pass it, you'll be qualified."

"Not yet?"

Then, Tae-san decided to prioritize clearing the labyrinth. He said goodbye to Riris and headed to the 33rd floor.

[Start of 33rd floor quest] [Defeat the boss of the 33rd floor and pass through.] [Reward: Shield of Protection] [Secret reward: ??]

As usual, the quest window and reward window appeared. Tae-san cleared the notification and went down the stairs.

The shop owner tilted his head in confusion.

"Why do you keep coming and going?"

"I'm here to learn magic."

"You're just a useless child."

The shop owner looked uninterested, only caring about breaking through the labyrinth. To him, Riris, who was living off Tae-san, was a worthless existence.

"Are you going to give up again?"

"I won't give up, but I have a question."

"What's your question?"

"What does this mean?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san held his arms up. A whip with thorns was tightly attached to his arm.

The shop owner frowned his face.

"What's going on with that?"

"It seems to have changed itself by consuming materials on its own."

"...Is that so?"

"Is that something you did?"

The shop owner looked puzzled, as if he didn't know what was going on. He spoke vaguely.

"I did make it, but I didn't make it myself. I got it from someone else. Look, it's written there."

Tae-san remembered the explanation of the whip.

"It was made by a witch's whim, as it was written."

"Ah, I got it from that woman too. After glancing over it, I didn't find anything unusual, so I put it on sale. I don't know the details."

"Did you know her well?"

"Not really."

The shop owner scowled.

"She wasn't bad, but she had too strong an opinion of herself. There were people who liked her, but I wasn't one of them. But why did she do that?"

"It's because that person came here too."

A witch who created equipment that could be used anywhere, even in a labyrinth. If someone had that kind of ability, it was possible that they entered the labyrinth.
Here is the translation of the text:

The store owner was lost in thought as he listened to Taesan's words.

"Of course, there is a possibility... Yes, there is a possibility. Although I said I wouldn't do it, since she's a woman known for her unpredictable nature..."

"That's enough."

The sign on the door read that the house was guarded by a cactus-shaped charm that could be taken to protect one's arms.

The store owner seemed to be unaware of this, and it seemed to imply that he had taken a different path and entered the labyrinth.

Taesan turned around and moved to another room.

"I should check if there's a new spell."

Taesan checked the spell.

[Basic Spell: Branding] [Mana Consumption: 10] [Proficiency: 1%] [It brands the caster's location. Any subsequent spells will be directed towards the branded location.]

"Is it more suitable as a support spell rather than an attack spell?"

Taesan immediately tested it. After activating the branding, he moved forward and cast the spell.

[You have cast the Frost Arrow.]

Pfft!

The moment the spell was activated, it pierced through the location where the branding was applied.

"What should I do with this?"

Initially, Frost Arrow or Blaze Bullet could have been shot in the way Taesan wanted. However, branding the location would actually incur a penalty.
Here is the translation of the text:

Taisan thought for a moment and came up with a magic spell.

"What if I do this?"

Taisan drew a seal and moved away again, taking a certain distance before activating the magic.

[You have randomly blinked.]

The seal drew a random blink.

"This is good, isn't it?"

The disadvantage of the random blink was that the location of the instantaneous movement was random, but it was solved by the seal.

The problem was that the seal could only be drawn on the spot where one's own foot had been, but it was a flaw that could be solved by leading the battle.

Taisan was satisfied and moved forward.

The 33rd floor was a knight wielding a hammer. The wind blew as the hammer was swung, and it was filled with a power that would be difficult for an ordinary adventurer to block.

Kaga kaga!

But Taisan blew off the hammer easily.

And then, he immediately activated the acceleration and easily knocked out the knight.

"This floor is fine, isn't it?"

It was perfect for practicing the new sword skills.

Taisan broke through the room.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san continued to practice his swordsmanship. Instead of immediately dealing with the monster, he focused on increasing his swordsmanship level as much as possible and perfecting his ability sword.

And the results were undeniable.

[Advanced Swordsmanship: Ability Sword] [Level: 12%] [A unique swordsmanship created by the Adventurer of the Labyrinth. It is based on the Labyrinth's system and was created by the king of a destroyed world who used to wield it. He can use a few skills perfectly in sync with his swordsmanship.]

"Already 12%?"

He was able to increase his level by 4% just by passing one floor. Compared to Tae-san, he was still quite weak, but he was surprisingly fast. Even the ghost was impressed.

[I think it's because I made my own swordsmanship. It's really fast. If it's this fast, I'll reach 20% by the middle of the 30th floor.]

It didn't stop there. A few skills related to swordsmanship also increased in level and changed their content.

[Special Activation Skill: Aura] [Level: 20%] [A reward given to those who have proven themselves with a sword. He started to understand Aura.]

The aura on Tae-san's sword began to glow.

Aura was not like a spark, but a flame that burned like a firefly. It was the result of his increased level.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's been a long time."

It's hard to say what kind of effect it will have, but since it's a skill with no additional consumption, the possibility of increased damage is high.

And the rapid attack also changed.

[Skill: Continuous Attack] [Level: 20%] [When attacking the opponent's vital spot, it deals greater damage. It adds a slightly increased damage.]

Except for the additional damage, there were no significant changes. However, it was a useful change, so Taesan received it with a happy heart.

The reward from the 33rd secret room was a golden bow.

'"Since I have magic, I can sell this at the shop."'

Soon, the boss arrived.

[A black knight with only his instincts appeared.]

Kuuuung!

A massive hammer swung down. The hammer contained a force that felt heavy to Taesan, fitting for the floor.

However, his movement was extremely slow. It seemed that the boss was telling Taesan to dodge and counterattack instead of blocking the attack.

Taesan swung his sword roughly.

Kaang!
Here is the translation of the text:

A thin sword and a massive hammer collided, and the hammer flew out. Tai Shan continued to attack the hammer or struck armor with perfect timing.

[You have won against the black hammer article, relying solely on instinct.] [The proficiency of Ability Sword has increased by 1%.] [Your level has risen.]

It was a long time since my level had risen. Since the level difference between the monster and Tai Shan was too large, I thought I wouldn't be able to do anything for a while, but it seemed that I had accumulated a decent amount of experience.

[Shield of Protection] [Defense + 50] [Made with great effort, but unable to protect the person it was meant to protect. It's not just a simple, sturdy shield that can protect someone.] [??? was used.] [Obtained the cursed hammer of Parma] [Cursed Hammer of Parma] [Attack power + 70] [A massive hammer that can barely be held with two hands. It was made to destroy ghosts, but because of that, it has been possessed by countless ghosts.] [Attribute: Ghost, Attack power + 20]

"There's nothing useful."

The shield is not being used. The hammer's attack power is high, but according to the description, it's a two-handed weapon. Tai Shan dislikes using two-handed weapons, even if their stats are extremely high, as it would force them to use their hands.

Therefore, it's time to go shopping.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san returned to the entrance and sold the equipment and miscellaneous materials he had collected to the shop owner.

"Then, let's go."

Bargain said to go to the 33rd floor on the left side. As he instructed, I arrived at the last room on the left side and saw a small door.

When I entered, a small altar appeared.

Two small stones were placed a short distance apart, giving the impression of a corridor.

"Someone will come to take us out of the top."

The whispering of the ghost ended, and a strong energy began to gather on the altar. The familiar feeling of the energy was unsettling.

"Rakiratas?"

[A reunion, Kang Tae-san.]

A voice with a hint of curiosity echoed from the scattered energy like mist.

"Are you responsible for this?"

[I don't think we fit together, do I?]

"It's the same."

The realm of struggle and death was suitable for the battlefield.

Rakiratas asked with a cheerful tone.

[Aren't you headed to the battlefield of those things?]

"I don't think there's anyone else who can do it."

[It's the same. Thanks to the insignificant limitations set by the outside things, it took a long time to find a suitable person.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Rakiratas' voice was gentle. Taesan felt that his voice was filled with kindness.

Taesan was deeply shocked. Even when they met on Earth for the last time, Taesan didn't seem to have a good feeling towards him, nor did he smile or speak in a gentle tone. His voice was only plain and straightforward.

But now it was completely different.

What was most striking was that Taesan was addressing him with his name, not as a mortal.

[I don't care about what's happening outside. There are also people who get annoyed and complain, but to me, it's all meaningless. Whatever they do, it's not bad to me.]

Rakiratas is the god of struggle and death. If the gods outside create a battlefield and lead their followers to death, he would be satisfied with that.

[But this is just what I expected. It's not just the foolishness of a mortal.]

Rakiratas spoke with a smile.
Here is the translation of the text:

"[Will you accept?] [Start of special quest] [Participate in the divine battlefield existing outside and show the grandeur of the labyrinth to the gods.] [Condition: Conquest of the battlefield] [Reward: The gods of Barigan and the Labyrinth will give a suitable reward according to the results.]"

"I accept."

Tae-san nodded his head. Lakiratas chuckled.

"Ah, I'm happy. Very happy. It's been a long time since I've felt this kind of emotion since I've been sitting here."
