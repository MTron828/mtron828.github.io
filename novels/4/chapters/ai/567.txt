Chapter 568

568. The World Crusher (4)

Kuuuuh!

The World Crusher's body was pushed backward, unable to withstand the power. A black root had been embedded deep in his chest.

However, it did not reach his heart.

The heart was located in a very deep place, fitting for the massive body. Simply stabbing it with a sword would not be enough to inflict damage.

Kuuuuh……

The World Crusher straightened his posture and clenched his fists. He was trying to crush the Great Mountain like squeezing out juice from a tomato.

Wa-lak!

A massive vortex erupted.

A huge curtain unfolded around the Great Mountain, with the power to swallow everything. The World Crusher could not easily approach it.

Just barely making it through, he was hit with a counterattack that negated his attack. Originally, a high-level opponent like a God or a Transcendent would not have been affected by the counterattack. He could ignore the attack, but reversing it before it happened was impossible.

However, the current Great Mountain was able to turn back even a God's attack, just a little.

At that moment, he had reached a level worthy of that.
Here is the translation of the text:

Concentrating his mind on the sword for a long time.

He gathers and focuses all his physical strength amplified by skills, including the underworld, the boundary beast, the boundary denial, and the physical strength.

He gathers everything and focuses on a single sword, solidifying it and controlling it.

And then he unleashes it.

Woooaaaah!

The accumulated energy becomes a sharp sword and he sprints. The energy released from the deeply embedded sword deeply pierces the internal organs of the World Crusher.

And then the energy that has advanced like this reaches the heart of the World Crusher.

Thud!

The World Crusher's body trembles.

Tae-san pulls out his sword and creates distance. Although the World Crusher had not reacted strongly to Tae-san's attack until now, it reacted differently this time.

Wooo...!

The World Crusher's body trembles again, as if it had received an irreparable wound.

"It's over."

Tae-san's lips curled up.

He inflicted a mortal wound. His energy pierced the World Crusher's heart, and it didn't end there.

"Pollute, flood, ruin."

Wooo...!

The World Crusher's body trembles once again.
Here is the translation of the text:

The process of striking the heart has allowed the boundary-breaking monster to infiltrate the inner world of the world-destroyer. The monster was devouring the internal organs like a parasitic worm, stirring up chaos within.

The world-destroyer's invincibility was only a cover for its physical body.

The internal world was completely defenseless.

It was impossible for anyone to discover this weakness, as it was not supposed to happen.

The heart was pierced, and something distorted was stirring within.

If this were a normal existence, it would have collapsed and met its demise.

Kuuhuuu!

But the world-destroyer did not collapse.

Its immense power and physical body allowed it to move without problem, even with a fatal wound.

As expected, it was not surprising. From this point on, it was a battle of endurance. The sword was straightened.

And the battle continues.

The flailing fist tore through the universe, stirring up all things.

The mountain did not retreat. It blocked the fist, repelled it, and turned the physical force into its own.

And then it hurled itself towards the world-destroyer.

Quaaaang!

The world-destroyer's body trembles.
Here is the translation of the text:

As time passes, the power of Tai Shan is slowly consumed. He has not yet accumulated enough power to engage in a protracted battle of wills with a strong opponent.

However, that was irrelevant.

[You have triggered the Overdrive.]

Kaga, kaga!

He dodges the punch and scratches his hand. He seizes the opportunity to usurp the power contained within.

If he were in his true form as a World Crusher, he might not have been able to be defeated. But since he was injured and shaken, he could have been usurped at any moment.

He replenishes his consumed power and launches another attack.

The eyes of the transcendent beings who protected the universe with their powers are filled with surprise.

Tai Shan is truly fighting the World Crusher alone. He is slowly advancing towards victory.

[Monster... what a joke.]

Someone muttered to himself. All the other transcendent beings denied his words.

Kuuuung!

The battle continues.

The World Crusher's movements are becoming increasingly sluggish. Although his powerful abilities and physical strength allowed him to move despite his injuries, there was a clear limit to his endurance.

It's almost over. Tai Shan has made up his mind and clenches his fist.

"Go ahead."

The boundary beast waits, as if anticipating it, and opens itself up to him.
Here is the translation of the text:

The life-giving boundary area filled the interior of the World Crusher. The World Crusher's movement came to a halt.

Taesan gazed at the moment, and inserted his sword once again. He repeatedly circulated the multiplication, inserted his sword into the wound once more, and concentrated his power to stab it into a formation.

Quadruplicate!

And his heart was pierced once again.

!!!

A scream echoed. The vacuum state of the universe trembled and shook only with the howling sound.

* * *

Kuuuung……

The battle continued.

And finally, it ended.

The World Crusher barely moved its arm, but its speed was extremely slow and lacked any power.

Taesan flicked his finger lightly.

Kuuuuuung!

Along with the wave, the World Crusher's body was pushed back. Its massive body was about to collapse.

If such a small existence collapsed, it would have an impact on the universe.

Taesan gathered his power and spoke.

"I ask for your assistance."

[......Understood.]

The transcendental beings watching moved. They handled their own powers.

Taesan and the transcendental beings' powers combined to forcibly grab the World Crusher's collapsing body.

[We've truly won.]

Here is the translation of the text:

Ehilria muttered to herself in a peculiar tone.

The World Crusher had completely broken down from the inside, and there was no longer any strength to move its physical body. It was essentially half-dead.

Tai Shan had won against the World Crusher.

"[You... have fallen. What...?]

The god of constraint spoke in a voice resonating with awe and trepidation, his eyes flashing with disbelief and praise, and also filled with fear.

And the transcendent being, who was governing a complete concept, was now afraid of Tai Shan.

"[It's not about the method. What's important is that he's on our side.]"

Ehilria calmed the atmosphere. The transcendent beings, who had been agitated, adjusted their emotions in response to her words.

"[Yes, that's right.] [Thank you, Tai Shan. You've done what we needed to do.]"

"Since those things are also hostile towards me, it doesn't matter."

"[Then... what about this massive body? How do we deal with it now?]"

The transcendent beings let out a sigh.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Holding on to his power, but it was impossible to keep it up forever. The unchanging self, still lingering, was stuck in this state. There was no way to deal with his physical body.

Although he had won, the aftermath was still left. The transcendental beings were deeply troubled.

And Taesan couldn't understand their troubles.

"It doesn't matter. I'll take care of it."

"[You're going to take care of it... Ah.]"

As Helirir spoke, he realized what power Taesan possessed.

Taesan placed his hand on the chest of the world-crushing being. The boundary beast was still stirring within him.

The world-crushing being was half-dead, having lost his consciousness and forgotten himself. He was essentially dead.

So, it was possible to usurp him.

"Give it to me."

Suddenly.

The world-crushing being's body trembled.

His physical body, wrapped in power.

His unchanging self began to transform into Taesan's possession. He seized everything.

"[Ah.] [Eh.]"

The transcendental beings, who had been watching, suddenly froze.

The mighty and enormous power of the soul.

It was contained within Taesan's small physical body.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was a vastly alien and distorted landscape. The transcendents felt a strong sense of unease. It was as if they were beholding a grand miracle.

And soon, Tai Shan had absorbed the power of the World Shatterer.

"Huu."

Tai Shan took a breath and the enormous power was contained within him.

[You have triggered the Overlord's usurpation. The Self-Immutable has usurped the Self-Immutable.] [The Self-Immutable has integrated with the Self-Transcendent.]

"It's done."

The Self-Immutable, which had wrapped itself around the World Shatterer's body, had become Tai Shan's possession.

"Now, it should be possible to handle the matter without any problems."

At this point, the World Shatterer was virtually nothing but a hollow shell. It was nothing more than a massive entity, and handling it was not difficult.

[……and so on.]

After a brief silence, the transcendents moved. Their powers engulfed the World Shatterer.

And the World Shatterer's physical body began to disintegrate into dust. Although it took a long time due to its enormous size, it eventually disappeared without leaving a single trace.

[……it's gone.]

Eihil muttered to himself.

From the old wars, I've killed countless transcendents, ruined the universe, and even now, I'm still causing significant harm to the universe.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's impossible to kill, so I managed to suppress it and chase it out into outer space. The World Destroyer.

That existence has now met a perfect death.

* * *

The Transcendents have taken a rest. They wish they could go and confront other high-ranking beings immediately, but their current state is not good enough.

They rested, and the Great Sage stayed by their side.

"I don't know if it's necessary, but I'll take care of it."

[I'm grateful for that.]

Ehilir quietly recovered his powers. As he had suffered greater losses than the other Transcendents, he needed a good rest.

Ehilir slowly recovered his powers, muttering to himself as if suddenly remembering something.

[You've defeated the high-ranking beings, haven't you.]

The Great Sage nodded silently. Ehilir smiled wryly.

[Those high-ranking beings, are you done with them?]

There aren't many high-ranking beings.

Compared to the Transcendents, there are significantly fewer.

However, each one is strong enough to confront multiple Transcendents, and they do not die or waste their energy, making them eternal and unchanging entities, which is why the war has been evenly matched.
Here is the translation of the text:

Swallowing everything and spitting it out, if one has the time, one can even contain the entire universe within oneself, the bottomless pit.

Having the largest physical body, tearing and crushing the universe itself, the World Crusher.

Many transcendent beings died and the universe was shaken by the two high-ranking gods, who are now meeting their eternal demise.

[Thanks to you, we have definitely gained the upper hand.]

The demon has gained freedom. The gods of constraint, compression, and control, who can now help other transcendent beings.

As the two high-ranking gods have disappeared, there is even more room for freedom.

The transcendent beings of the universe can now definitely pressure the high-ranking gods.

[And... you are also.]

Facing the high-ranking gods alone, can overcome and defeat them.

And can give them eternal death.

[War will finally end.]

That's what it was, regardless of the direction.

For a moment, the mountain that watched over them returned to the labyrinth, as it was necessary to confirm the power it had obtained.

And the next day.

The high-ranking gods disappeared from the universe.
