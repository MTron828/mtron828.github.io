75. 13th Floor, Guide of Sin (2)

"What... what are you!"

"I'm an adventurer, aren't I? Figure it out yourself. Ah, can't you call someone who gives up an adventurer?"

Taesan lazily says as he thrusts his sword. Lebebvas clenches his fist with a twisted face.

It's his first time fighting a proper adventurer. Taesan's expression grows serious.

Lebebvas grits his teeth.

"Yeah, but you're just the 13th floor!"

Although he seems to have special means, he's still an adventurer who hasn't cleared beyond the 13th floor. He has no reason to lose.

With confidence, Lebebvas charges. He presses himself against Taesan and swings his fist.

Clang.

The sword and fist collide, sparking. Taesan blocks Lebebvas's attack and thinks to himself.

"He said he cleared up to the 20th floor? Not weak."

There's a considerable weight to it.

No, it's comparably stronger than an ordinary 20th floor.

Perhaps he pushed himself to the limit through endless repeated hunts. While Taesan calmly organizes his thoughts, Lebebvas feels like he's having a nightmare.

"What is this!"
He screamed inwardly. His fist was being perfectly blocked.

"How can a 13th floor like this!"

Lebebvas had cleared the 20th floor. The difference in stats between the 13th and 20th floors is overwhelming to the point of being insurmountable.

With every punch, the opponent deflects and he can't keep up with their movements. There exists a difference that under normal circumstances would guarantee an absolute victory.

Yet he couldn't catch up.

Moreover, he was even being pushed back. His punches felt numb, and his movements were preemptively blocked. Lebebvas was losing his mind.

If Taesan was intentionally controlling his strength to some extent, he would really lose it.

Taesan swings his sword. He avoids the opponent's gauntlet and bends his arm.

"[12 damage to Lebebvas]."

"Ugh!"

Lebebvas staggers back with a groan. Taesan swings his sword and mutters.

"Indeed, your defense is high."

Having descended to the 20th floor, he must be wearing even better armor. At this rate, it could take a while.

"Profit!"
Looking down, Lebebvas grits his teeth and charges forward, but the same result unfolds. He can't block the wavering sword and sustains a wound.

"How... how is this possible..."

"His movements aren't that impressive."

Though systematic, his movements clearly pale in comparison to the monsters he's seen here. Ghost answers the question.

"I heard he came from humble origins. Probably never learned proper martial arts. Likely just a third-rate mercenary."

"Can't he learn here?"

"He could learn, but who would teach him? No one gives away their cards for free. He didn't pay that price."

"Shut up!"

Lebebvas shouts roughly and swings his fist. Taesan doesn't evade.

"Kang Taesan activated Parry."

The skill activates. Lebebvas's mouth twists.

"Lebebvas activated Strong Strike." "Kang Taesan activated Counter."

He deflects the fist and stabs the sword into Lebebvas's chest. Lebebvas staggers back, blood trickling from his mouth. He glares back dazedly.

"...What?"

It wasn't unconscious. Taesan activated Counter in response to Strong Strike.

"You knew?"

Impossible.
Dropping can't beat strong, and strong can't beat counter. It's a hidden balance that took three years of countless attempts and clashes to barely discover. It's something even a rookie on the 13th floor could hardly grasp.

In contrast, Taesan wore a grim expression.

"If this is barely graspable, what's an average level like?"

"..."

Lebebvas flushed and retrieved black powder from his inventory.

[Lebebvas activated Powder of Fascination.]

Powder of Fascination. An item that induces illusions upon inhalation, a high-grade item worth over 2,000G.

He also pulled out a robe.

[Lebebvas activated Robe of Shadow.]

Robe of Shadow. A highly valuable equipment he had acquired. Its effect: invisibility for one second.

Psychic attacks and invisibility. A combination of two. Lebebvas closed in on Taesan while avoiding the powder. As he raised his fist, Taesan ducked.

[Successful Judgment!]

Not even Maria's presence could sway Taesan's focus. Such powder wouldn't create any meaningful impact.

[Taesan activated Robe of Shadow.]

Taesan's body, too, vanished.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

Lebebvas, who never imagined that Taesan would possess a stealth skill, flinched as time passed and Taesan's invisibility wore off. Taesan approached Lebebvas.

"Take this!"

[Dealt 6 damage to Lebebvas.]

"Really? That's all?"

Taesan muttered as if annoyed, and Lebebvas was astonished, coughing.

"I took damage from a kick...?"

There was no visible attack power on the shoes. Knowing about Ainz Ooal Gown and their weapon skills, Lebebvas couldn't help but think in that direction naturally.

That arrogant old man who scorned and trampled upon them gave him this skill?

Lebebvas still couldn't forget the scornful gaze sent by Ainz Ooal Gown.

"What are you!"

Lebebvas shouted and rushed forward.

Taesan calmly retaliated. Without landing a single effective hit, Lebebvas only received blows. Given the fundamental difference in stats and the disparity in learned weapon skills, it was a natural outcome.

However, Lebebvas didn't fall easily.

"He's tough and has a lot of stamina."

Even hitting him only resulted in around 10 damage. Lebebvas had about 1500 health. By simple calculation, he would need to hit around 150 times to bring him down.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

Naturally, his movements showed gaps unlike before. Lebebvas's eyes gleamed.

"Finally!"

Despite being toyed with, he cleared the 20th floor. In this place where ordinary people couldn't pass the 1st floor and even talented individuals mostly perished before the 10th floor, reaching the 20th floor was no easy feat.

Lebebvas put strength into his fist.

His gauntlet possessed a hidden function.

Its effect was a skill that dealt damage five times the basic attack power, but it could only be used once.

This was an effect unseen on the 20th floor. Despite the drawback of the gauntlet losing all effects for a month after use, it was still a significant piece of equipment.

Originally, such equipment was not permitted to him up to the 20th floor, but Lebebvas had desperately hidden the gauntlet.

"Just one strike!"

He lunged with bloodshot eyes. Taesan smirked at the obvious intention.

He deflected the punch.

Clang!

Then swung his sword. Lebebvas's thigh was cut.

Lebebvas's eyes gleamed. Whether it was due to complacency or Taesan's large swinging motion creating an opening, a gap appeared.

"An opening!"
Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

Lebebvas pressed his body close. Whether by chance, Lebebvas was skillfully seizing opportunities, or for some other reason, he was able to cling without any resistance to the ground.

Sparks flew in Lebebvas's eyes.

"You're dead!"

[Lebebvas activated Strong Strike.] [Lebebvas activated Gauntlet of Explosion.]

In addition to consuming all mana, it adds five times the base attack power. If it hits properly, it's enough to be fatal.

[First attack nullification by Gang Taesan has been activated.]

But it's meaningless.

When his fist returned to normal, Lebebvas's pupils trembled.

"Huh?"

"Is that all?"

Taesan thrusts his sword. Normally, Lebebvas would quickly create distance or counterattack, but he lacks the composure to do so now.

"What is this...?"

He barely feints a punch.

[Second attack nullification by Gang Taesan has been activated.]

Lebebvas let out a bitter laugh.

"What was I even fighting against?"

Despair overwhelmed him.

* * *

"It's over."

Lebebvas collapsed. Seeing the nullification of attacks, he completely lost morale, feeling utterly defeated.
Here's the English translation of the text:

---

Now, one more hit and he would be at death's door. Taesan looked at the collapsed Lebebvas with cold eyes instead of finishing him off.

"There's really nothing special about you."

Still, he's an adventurer of the 20th floor. He thought he could handle it to some extent, but from the moment his spirit broke, he did nothing. He helplessly took blows like a severed doll.

Even now, he showed more helplessness and frustration than fear of death. The ghost answered.

["It wasn't supposed to be like this. If it had been like this, I wouldn't have made it to the 20th floor. I used to be sharper and fought better..."]

"Did I lose my fangs?"

He said the 20th floor was his limit. Perhaps he had lingered here for a long time without suitable opponents.

Beasts without enemies tend to become lazy.

"Well, then."

He gathers information.

He did hear from the ghost about the guide of sin, but the information he knows is ancient, information from before he died. He mentioned that there was such a group, but he didn't go into detail.

Lebebvas belatedly regained his senses as Taesan approached.

"You know what to ask, right?"

"...If I answer, will you spare me?"

"No. I'll kill you."


Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

He doesn't tell lies. He has no intention of leaving any remnants. Lebebvas let out a bitter smile.

"Do I have a reason to answer?"

"You should."

Taesan gestured towards the ghost. He knew it wouldn't answer easily. So he hesitated, but the ghost intervened.

["You bastard. Do you know what the transcendent beings of this place receive as offerings?"]

Lebebvas trembled slightly. Fear filled his eyes.

[If you don't answer, you're worthless to this guy. Your soul will just be used most valuably. You don't have to answer if that's what you want.]

"Oh, no. That's not it."

He grabs Taesan's clothes.

"Please..."

"You just have to answer."

Taesan was slightly surprised.

To say that he would answer as soon as he heard about offerings to the transcendent beings. The fear of that action was unmistakable.

'Is that really so frightening?'

At least with the gods he had seen, there was no indication they would treat him so badly, so it was unexpected.

Either way, he could listen to the answer. It didn't seem like he would tell a lie. Taesan began his questioning.

"How many of you are there?"

"...I don't know either."

--- 

This is the translated text. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
Lebebvas shook his head.

"I told you. I've only been permitted up to the 20th floor. The further down you go, the more there are, and I haven't been there."

Lebebvas smirked bitterly.

"You're strong, but there are many stronger than you. Since you've touched me, you too..."

Taesan struck Lebebvas on the head.

"Stop the noise and just answer."

"...Roughly hundreds."

Taesan was slightly surprised at the pained expression in the answer.

"So many?"

"Most who come here are accepted."

Upon hearing this, Taesan understood.

This place was dangerous and challenging. Even Taesan, with his knowledge and rising spirit, faced numerous dangers. No matter how hopeful one might be, reality had a way of crumbling before it.

Those who remained unbroken either perished in the labyrinth or were killed by them. Those who ventured as deep as ghosts were an extreme minority.

After organizing his thoughts, Taesan asked,

"You mentioned limits to how far down one can go. How does that work?"

"It's like floors—20th, 30th, 40th. Mostly 30th and 40th floors."
"So that's what 'rock bottom' means."

"..."

Lebebvas sealed his lips. Indeed, there was no real response he could give.

"Novices," Taesan sneered at them.

To come this far and yet have limits imposed on oneself, not by choice but by others—it was incomprehensible to Taesan.

"You don't know," Lebebvas replied in a trembling voice to Taesan's scorn.

"You're strong."

Taesan is a monster. Lebebvas still found it hard to believe. Nullifying attack skills, and not just one but two.

It wasn't just about skills. His combat abilities were superior, and he knew all about skill compatibility.

If the revealed skills weren't everything, he must have something more. He might even be able to win without a problem up to the 30th floor right now.

It was truly unbelievable.

"But not all who've made a place here are like you. They're... monsters."

There was a fear in his eyes that he couldn't hide.

Taesan snorted.

"You'd better know more than I do."
"He knows those who have cleared this place. There's no way anyone, even ghosts, could be stronger than those who haven't even touched Lee Taeyeon.

"But they are stronger than I am now."

Taesan had the confidence to catch up at any time, but not immediately. As you descend the floors of the labyrinth, the acceleration changes the dimension of strength.

Over 50 floors. Maybe the ones under 60 floors. Adventurers who could be called the brains behind the path of sin.

"Did they come all the way up here to catch me?"
