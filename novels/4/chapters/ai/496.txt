**Chapter 497**

**497. 92nd Floor. Faith (8)**

Taesan was receiving the faith of a planet with over 100 stars.

It was clear that he had the faith to reach the realm of a perfect deity.

However, that didn't happen. Taesan himself didn't fully understand, but the reason was simple.

It was because Taesan had borrowed the name of Remidaos.

A name is a value that represents an object. However, when Taesan received people's faith, he took on the appearance of Remidaos, borrowed his name, and acted like Remidaos.

People's faith was directed towards Taesan, who was mimicking Remidaos.

In the end, it was a faith bound to the concept of Remidaos. It couldn't be considered Taesan's personal faith. Therefore, he couldn't reach the realm of transcendence in the true sense.

But now, things are different.

People's emotions towards Remidaos have changed. They no longer worshiped or sent their faith to Remidaos.

Their lost faith was gathering towards Taesan.

Not towards Remidaos, but towards Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[This is it.]"

"Hmm."

Taesan and Remidaos both sensed the change. Taesan raised the corner of his mouth.

"Was it like that?"

[These trash-like things!]

Remidaos exploded in anger. The transcendent being's emotions stirred up the minds of the people. The people screamed and trembled with fear, and began to worship Taesan even more.

Remidaos gritted his teeth. His plan was going awry. Taesan was stronger than he had expected, and he couldn't instill overwhelming fear in the people.

[...It doesn't matter. I'll just kill you in the end!]

"Bring it on."

Taesan spread his arms wide.

Remidaos gathered his divine energy and fired it straight at Taesan. The divine energy, like a galaxy, filled the space. Taesan grasped his sword.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

He repelled the divine energy with his condensed chaos and created a path. Taesan charged towards Remidaos, and Remidaos tried to block Taesan's approach.

Ki-ii-ii-ing!

The divine energy took on a curtain-like form and filled the space.

[You have activated the Great Collapse [Chaos].]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The orb of chaos is summoned. It slowly pushes the curtain and creates a path.

Remidaos waves his hand. The curtain, pushed back, moves according to its master's will, enveloping the great collapse and the mountain. The mountain gains strength in its feet.

[You have activated the magic explosion.]

Kugugugugu!

Chaos explodes. The compressed divine power cannot withstand it and is torn apart. As a result, a small gap is created, and the mountain escapes through it.

[Where to!]

The curtain collapses.

It transforms like a thorn, rushing towards the mountain's entire body. Each and every one of them is extremely compressed, capable of piercing through chaos.

[You have activated the World's Sword [Chaos].]

You grasp the sword and wield it. You wildly swing the enormous sword, comparable in size to a mountain range, and crush the thorns. Before long, the sword becomes worn out and rusty.

However, you gain the opportunity to dodge. The mountain wraps chaos around its body and escapes.

And what welcomes the mountain is, once again, the divine power that fills the field of vision.

'Really, there's too much of it.'"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even with an unimaginable amount of divine power being used, Taesan didn't show any signs of exhaustion. The amount of divine power he had was even more than expected. If this continued, the duration of the Chaos Call would end before his divine power ran out.

Taesan's eyes sank.

It was when Remidaos directly struck the divine power that had been significantly consumed that the real attack began.

Simply erasing the manifesting divine power didn't have much meaning. He had to directly attack the main body.

To do so, he had to take a risk.

But it was worth it.

Taesan was feeling the faith that was pouring into him.

Every time Taesan blocked Remidaos' attack and counterattacked, the faith towards him grew stronger.

It was always like that. Whenever someone achieved a remarkable feat, their faith would surge like an explosion. If he could directly strike Remidaos like this...

He would be able to truly reach the pinnacle.

The preparation was over. Taesan put strength into his legs.

[You have activated acceleration.] [You have activated skill acceleration.]

His body accelerated. Remidaos wielded his divine power. Taesan focused even more on the ash-colored aura that surrounded his entire body."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You activated Stealth [Chaos].] [You activated Baal's Overlapping Darkness.] [You activated Random Blink.] [Uh.]

Remidaos is taken aback for a moment.

In the brilliant, shining divine realm, Taesan perfectly concealed himself. Even with his senses, Remidaos couldn't find him.

[But still!]

Remidaos stomps his foot. The divine wave shakes the surroundings, sending shockwaves that could shatter planets with a simple display of power, rivaling that of a concept god.

But it doesn't reach Taesan.

Attacks that can't detect Taesan are all erased and excluded. That's the skill he possesses. The ability of one who hides in the shadows.

Taesan closes the distance in an instant without any hindrance. Remidaos, who belatedly confirms Taesan with his naked eye, hastily summons his divine power, and Taesan does the same.

Kwaaaang!

All sorts of powers burst forth.

Magic, dark magic, destructive power.

They fill the space and block the view. Remidaos's divine power clashes with Taesan's. In an instant, they collide and shatter, but create a small opening.

Taesan aims for that opening and approaches Remidaos even further.

[Foolish act.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And Remidaos ridiculed that mountain.

He didn't expect to be approached perfectly from his blind spot.

But that was all. Looking at it calmly, it was like a beast getting its head caught in a trap. No matter how chaotic it was, he could break through it now.

Remidaos gathered his strength strongly.

The divine energy condensed and condensed, taking on a white hue.

Ku-u-ung!

He launched himself straight at the mountain. There was no space to dodge, and he had no choice but to break through head-on.

And the mountain had never intended to clash with him directly from the start.

[You have activated Selection Exclusion.]

The white divine energy flying towards the mountain disappeared.

It was as if it had never happened, leaving no trace behind.

[What!]

Selection Exclusion.

The authority granted to the mountain by the goddess of selection, Maria. It could erase a single attack, selecting it to be deleted.

Concept gods or high gods might be able to resist, but Remidaos was ultimately a faith god, and he had no way to resist Selection Exclusion.

The path has opened up.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan accelerates even further. Remidaos hastily gathers divine power, but it's already too late. In the end, Remidaos fails to fully harness the divine power and attacks Taesan.

[You have activated the Fall of All Things.]

Remidaos's divine power crashes down. Taesan fills his sword with chaos and swings it.

Kwaaaang!

He destroys and rejects, charging forward. The divine power that's being pushed back tries to erase the chaos, but Taesan doesn't budge.

[You have activated the Denial of Possibility.]

Kwaddduk!

He denies all possibilities that don't lead to victory.

And Taesan opens a path.

Remidaos hastily spreads the ripples of divine power to push Taesan back, but Taesan isn't foolish enough to fall for the same trick again.

"Stop."

He declares, gathering black energy.

Time in the world comes to a halt.

Remidaos also can't escape the interference of time.

The time that can be stopped is not long, but it's enough. Taesan stabs his sword, tainted with chaos.

Kagagagak!

The divine power is torn apart.

It's consumed, transformed, and destroyed. The divine power is exhausted to protect its master from chaos.

[Ugh, aaaaah!]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Time that had stopped begins to flow again. Remidaos unleashes his power with anger. The divine energy violently covers the mountain range.

[Your second attack has been absolutely nullified.] [Your third attack has been absolutely nullified.] [You have taken 198,754 damage.]

Piercing through the chaos, the attack nullification is triggered in an instant. The damage is exponentially increasing.

The mountain range quickly puts some distance between them. It recovers its dwindling vitality with divine energy.

"Not bad."

He had also consumed a considerable amount. He had used up the authorities of the Transcendents and all the attack nullifications had been exhausted. The consumption of black and divine energy was also significant.

However, Remidaos had suffered even greater damage.

The divine energy he possessed had decreased by more than half. Of course, even with that decrease, the remaining amount of divine energy was still absurdly large, but it was undeniable that a significant amount had been consumed.

[You... You... You!]

And Remidaos was feeling intense anger.

The faith he had accumulated until now, the faith that had been constantly accumulating since he became a Transcendent, had disappeared by more than half. It felt like his head was burning with rage.

[I'll kill you!]

"What's the point of continuing like this?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan replied calmly. At the moment when Remidaos was about to unleash his divine power with distorted emotions, he realized something.

He no longer felt the emotions of the people directed towards him.

Their fear and reverence, mixed with awe, were gradually disappearing.

And that faith was gathering towards Taesan.

"Oh oh oh!"

"Please! Please!"

The moment Taesan struck Remidaos, the faith directed towards Taesan exploded.

They didn't want to see it. They didn't want to hear it. But Remidaos' anger and his voice could never escape from them.

Fear and dread crawled into people's minds. They begged Remidaos to forgive them.

If things had gone as planned, Remidaos would have gotten the result he wanted.

But Taesan did not fall as Remidaos had intended.

Instead, he pressured Remidaos and inflicted damage on him.

It seemed as though people were confronting an existence that they couldn't possibly defeat, and gaining the upper hand.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

People's faith naturally gathered towards Taesan, and it exploded with a single blow.

[The proficiency of the divine has increased by 17%.]

At the same time, Taesan's divinity reached its peak.

* * *

Taesan is gathering faith. His divinity is piling up and growing. And it becomes, eventually, a single form.

Senses are changing.

The feeling of omnipotence is spreading throughout his body. Taesan has felt this sensation before.

It was on Earth.

The realm of a perfect transcender. A place where no one can deny, even outside the realm of faith, the seat of the divine.

The faith of over ten planets is perfectly filling him up.

[……Don't laugh!]

Remidaos denied that fact.

[Even if you've reached that place, it's just a clumsy state you've just reached! You can never reach me!]

Remidaos wielded his divinity. Just like before, his divinity was compressed like the sun. Until now, Taesan would have been perfectly blocked by the chaos even with his confusion.

But it's not the case now.

Taesan is covering his entire body with chaos.

His divinity has reached the dark, thick ash.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

It's not piercing through.

"No. On the contrary, the ash-colored darkness devours the divine. The divine, which was as bright as the sun, gradually becomes tainted with darkness, transforming into a dusty, faded color.

Taesan clenched his fist.

The divine, tainted with ash, disappears without leaving a single trace. Remidos can't speak.

[……What's going on.]

"It's good."

Taesan smiled in satisfaction.

"Let's end this now."

He grasps the sword. The ash-colored darkness spreads rapidly, like a spider's web, engulfing the space and expanding its size in an instant.

The world begins to be tainted with ash-colored darkness."
