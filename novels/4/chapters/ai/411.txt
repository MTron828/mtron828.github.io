Chapter 412

412. 82th floor, Remegaton (1)

"The reason I created twins is because their individuality was too intense to be combined into one. But if I had materials like these... it would be possible."

Harfran examined the materials.

"Are you thinking of using all of these materials?"

"I don't know how much material is needed, so I'll just take everything out for now."

"Hmm."

Harfran stroked his chin.

"All of these... are unnecessary. Even if the twin rings' individuality is intense, what you've shown me is more than that. It's even excessive."

As Harfran examined the materials, he felt a surge of energy.

"This is unnecessary. It's too intense. It could even harm the ring's individuality."

The material was an item that could elevate a mortal existence to that of an immortal.

It was definitely too much to use as a single equipment.

"More than anything, if it's related to the gods... I won't touch it. I don't know how the gods would react."

Harfran handed the material back with a worried face.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Even if the materials are different, it's possible. The world's core is used, so the world's harmony is good. Let's start exploring the maze first."

"Is it really going to take a while?"

"With materials like these, it's going to take a significant amount of time to plan how to use them. After all, we need your help to make the equipment. Once everything is ready, I'll call you. Got it?"

"Okay."

"By the way, are you going to use this too?"

Half-ran had mentioned a material related to willpower.

"This is a material related to willpower. It's better to entrust it to Cosrun than to leave it to me."

Half-ran had mentioned something earlier. There was a master blacksmith who was optimized for making equipment related to willpower.

A mad blacksmith. Cosrun. He said he was hiding deep down.

But Taesan shook his head.

"I'm sorry, I haven't seen it."

"Really?"

Half-ran was taken aback.

"Are you saying you haven't exceeded the 80th floor? But you can't find Cosrun?"

"It's not that I missed it, but it's not here."

And Taesan couldn't have missed it. It was clear that Cosrun was not seen up to the 82nd floor.

Half-ran rubbed his jaw.
(Note: I did not translate the character names as they are likely to be specific to the story or context)
Here is the translation of the text:

"I heard that I had secured a spot on the 70th floor, but it's possible that I've already changed it. Anyway, I'll keep this. It doesn't seem like I'll need it, but..."

Taesan took out the fragment of intention.

Half-ran took out a hammer with a happy face.

"Well, then, I'll prepare. It's fine to expect a lot."

Taesan gazed at Half-ran for a moment.

Half-ran's eyes widened as if she was looking at something suspicious.

"Why is that?"

"No."

"Is it joy, excitement, and madness?"

Taesan turned around and went down to the labyrinth.

The things he had left with him were materials that were impossible to obtain even in the depths of the labyrinth.

If he gathered those things and made a device, it would be a device that surpasses any device he had obtained before.

Maybe it would even surpass the device handled by his past self, Taean.

Taesan turned around and went down to the labyrinth.

* * *

The matter with Half-ran was over. Now it was time to confirm the power I had obtained this time.

I didn't obtain as much as I had expected, but a huge change had occurred.
Here is the translation:

Concept Skill: [Will of All Things] [Proficiency: 1%]

It can feel and read the will of everything in the world, and if desired, can adjust and control it according to one's own will. However, it can only have a very weak influence at this level.

This skill was effective in reading intentions.

I could anticipate what the opponent would do and think, and respond accordingly. It was a skill that helped me consistently in battles, although it didn't make a big difference.

As I used this skill to dominate the world, it evolved into the "Will of All Things" skill.

Tai Shan gazed at the ghost. The ghost trembled with fear. Tai Shan's gaze seemed to pierce through him.

"Why do you look at me like that?"

"There's something I need to confirm."

When Tai Shan faced Half-ran and gained insight into the ghost's emotions, he could read not only the surface-level emotions but also those deeper feelings.

It was as if he could read people's thoughts.

He also sensed something similar from the ghost.

'Hope.'

Perhaps Tai Shan could reach the end of the labyrinth and obtain something.

'Anxiety.'

And perhaps he might fail in the process.

'...A very small despair.'
Here is the translation of the text:

His own quest was going to be achieved soon, and after that, he would have to part ways with Taesan, filled with despair.

Even the ghost himself didn't know about the level of emotions he was showing.

Taesan closed his eyes. The ghost was taken aback.

"What's wrong? Is there a problem with the new skill you've acquired?"

"There's a problem, I suppose."

Taesan explained vaguely. The ghost who had listened to the story remained silent.

"...Can you read all my emotions and Half-ran's emotions?"

"It's not just you."

Everything in the labyrinth felt close and familiar.

The skill itself was understandable. He had broken through the world itself, and the world was the master of all life.

So, with the power of ascension, he had gained the ability to read and control all things according to his own will.

However, Taesan was human.

Although the skill had become stronger, it was not good for unnecessary parts to be read. "I need to adjust a bit."

"That's good. It's quite uncomfortable to read only what's right next to you."

The ghost said with a troubled tone. Taesan looked at the wall of the labyrinth with a calm expression, focusing his mind.

The ghost's emotions, which had been lingering, began to be blocked out.
Here is the translation of the text:

If Taesan had wanted, he could have blocked unnecessary information and only read the intentions and emotions of the desired person. It was not a kind of power that was impossible to control.

How helpful it would be, I'll have to wait and see, but it wasn't a bad change.

And the mastery of the incantation had exceeded 20%.

[Special permanent skill: Incantation] [Mastery: 24%] [Concrete manifestation of will. By uttering a language that contains one's will, one can make a declaration that affects the world, and more diverse and detailed declarations are possible.]

The incantation is a useful power, but it was difficult to control. However, as the mastery increased, it became possible to control it to some extent, making it a useful change.

Taesan activated the authority seal and stepped onto the 82nd floor.

[Start of 82nd floor quest.] [Pass through the trials of the devil.] [Reward: Waistcloth that drinks dark water from the depths] [Secret reward: ???]

"Is it the devil?"

The owner of the black magic possessed by Taesan.

The rewards and secret rewards of the 81st floor were all related to magic equipment. Similarly, this time it seemed to be related to black magic equipment.

Taesan discovered an altar.

It was just black in color.
Here is the translation of the text:

There was no pattern or decoration whatsoever. Only a black corridor stood in the middle of the room.

Taesan quietly scanned the corridor.

As a result, he discovered something.

In that corridor, he felt a power similar to that of a god.

"'It's definitely similar to the existence of a god,' I thought."

Although it was weaker than a god, it was similar to the existence of those who were born with strong powers. It was a demon.

And Taesan had a skill related to it.

[Remegeton] [A contract with a demon. You can directly make a contract with them if you want what they want, and they can use black magic. It's still a privilege and has no effect yet.]

The right to make a direct contract with a demon.

He had obtained it a long time ago, but he had never had the chance to use it. Now was the time to use Remegeton.

Taesan took a step towards the corridor. It was a moment when he was about to put his body into it without hesitation.

[Just wait for a moment, won't you?]

A massive darkness descended between Taesan and the corridor.

Taesan stopped in his tracks. The descending darkness was now familiar, a power he had faced many times before.

"Ah, demon."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Let's take a look again? Tai Shan."

Lucifer and Mars appeared quietly.

* * *

The black-haired Mars shook his hair. Mars, who appeared in the labyrinth, landed barefoot.

"It seems like I've obtained many divine powers."

"That's how it is."

The negation magic was a force that affected all living things. Mars spoke calmly.

"Do you know why I came to this place?"

"It's because of that."

Remegeton. A right that allows direct contracts with demons.

Mars nodded his head.

"Originally, I would have left it up to your choice whether to use it or not. Of course, you would definitely use Remegeton, but it was still a choice. However, the situation has changed a bit now. Tai Shan, have you made a contract with a mage?"

"Yes."

Tai Shan nodded his head. The contract with the mage. Tai Shan had raised the difficulty level of the labyrinth for his own use, and as a result, he received a corresponding reward.

And the best way to raise the difficulty level was indeed Remegeton.

Tai Shan accepted it calmly.

"I don't care. I was going to use it anyway."
Here is the translation of the text:

With a satisfied smile, Ma Xian clapped his hands.

[The Remegaton was activated.]

Kuku ku ku!

The black tunnel and Remegaton merged.

The sound of screams and the tunnel began to distort, starting to take shape.

Kwad dwid!

And then the tunnel changed.

Beyond the tunnel, like a dark abyss, I sensed dozens of gazes.

That was a demon.

The demons, each with their own territory, were staring at Tai Shan.

[Originally, a low-ranking demon would have been in charge of the trial. Even a low-ranking demon could test an adventurer to some extent. But you, now, don't have any demons that can defeat you, excluding those with territories.]

Tai Shan quietly gazed beyond the tunnel.

It was as if he could feel their power more closely because Ma Xian had directly connected with them.

The demons were strong.

Definitely stronger than the current Tai Shan.

However, if we consider their fundamental nature, they were on the same level.

‘Are they immortal-level?’
Here is the translation of the text:

These are the most powerful of the 72 devils, beings that possess their own domains. You are the master of black magic, and they will bring you trials.

They seemed to be about to burst out of the tunnel at any moment.

A subtle, dark energy began to flow out of the tunnel.

[Stay still.]

The demon waved its hand, and a massive shockwave shook the tunnel beyond. The gazes that had been heading towards the Taesan suddenly scattered.

[Annoying things. They are bound by contract, but they keep trying to act on their own accord.]

The gazes that had fled began to creep back one by one.

The demon seemed to have read the thoughts of the Taesan.

[These beings are similar to gods. They were born with strong powers from the start. Of course, most of them are weak compared to gods, but... if you look closely, they are closer to the existence on the other side. You will face a trial that is meaningful to you.]

The devil's power had subsided, perhaps because it had been suppressed once.

The demon inserted its hand into the tunnel beyond.

[As I said, these beings are similar to gods. So, the trials will also be quite cruel.]

The demon seemed to be displeased, and its tongue flicked out in distaste.
Here is the translation of the text:

[You don't want to go through something like torture, right? I'll filter it out for you.]

"Thank you."

Unexpectedly, Taesan received it gratefully.

As the demon said, it seemed that the demon was close to the demon he was thinking of. He didn't want to kill a normal person or torture him like that.

He was grateful that the demon would filter it out for him, so Taesan waited quietly.

Time passed.

After ten minutes, Taesan quietly asked the demon, "Is it still undecided?"

"Just wait a little longer."

The demon's face twisted.

[I'm not strong enough to give you a challenge at this level.]

It seemed that the demon's heart was not in the challenges proposed by the demons, as his voice was firm. Taesan shut his mouth and waited quietly again.

After another ten minutes, twenty minutes had passed. During that time, the demon continued to insert his hand into the tunnel, searching for a suitable challenge.

"It's almost time to receive a suitable challenge..."

[Hmm, I don't think it's okay yet. Even this level of challenge is too comparable to Jerubandal.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Mashin murmured discontentedly with a dissatisfied face.

From the perspective of Tae-san, it was a kind thing that Mashin was so concerned, but it seemed that even if they went on like this, the ordeal would not end in a day. It was a moment when Tae-san was about to ask Mashin to tidy up.

[Then, I'll let you do it.]

A deep-voiced man's voice echoed from beyond the corridor.

Suddenly, one arm shot out.

[......Why have you come here?]

Mashin was taken aback. The being that appeared seemed to speak calmly.

[If we go on like this, it won't end. I know what he likes, but it's not good to settle for something mediocre.]

The owner of the voice had a massive horn on his head.

His red eyes were like those of a reptile, and a black aura flowed over his entire body.

He looked exactly like a demon.

And the feeling of power that radiated from him was different from that of other demons.

"This is..."

It's different.

If you really have to compare, it's transcendent.

Above all, the kind of power that radiated from him was not from this world.

A being with a high level of existence.

The being looked at Tae-san and smiled with a sly grin.
Here is the translation:

[It's great to see you. The existence is mixed up.] [The great evil. Baal has appeared.]
