Chapter 367

367. 76th Floor, Child of the Gods (7)

The ice, the earth, and the starlight are pouring down. The Emperor hastily opens his mouth.

But now, even Taesan knows. If the Emperor wants to impose his rules on the world, he must declare it with his mouth.

And the time it takes for that declaration to take effect is not short for Taesan.

In an instant, dozens of magic spells are realized in the world. The power of destruction is unleashed, and the Emperor is overwhelmed.

"Kkkk!"

The Emperor amplifies his divine power, wrapping his entire body in it.

The divine power, which has collided with magic, slowly begins to dissipate.

"In the realm of this holy Lord, whenever you use magic, you must clasp your hands together and offer a prayer!"

The Emperor endures the magic and declares again. Dozens of magic spells simultaneously lose their power and disappear.

But Taesan had expected everything.

Before the Emperor finishes his declaration, Taesan approaches him with a limited blink and activates a starlight arrow. Taesan neutralizes the divine power surrounding the Emperor's body with the starlight arrow and places his hand on the Emperor's body.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the Branch of Despair.]

“Ugh!”

A massive emotional whirlpool suddenly sweeps through the Emperor's mind.

All sorts of negative emotions try to dominate him. Taesan activates another skill without hesitation.

[You have activated Forced Fall.]

The Emperor's movements slow down noticeably. Taesan quickly creates distance and gathers his hands.

Zzzt!

Magic is unleashed.

According to the rules, magic and dark magic are manifested. Although it's extremely slow, the Emperor can't take advantage of the opening.

“Ugh ugh ugh!”

The Emperor's face distorts in response to the overwhelming emotions.

“Don't laugh!”

He lets out a furious cry.

“I am the Emperor! I am the messenger of God! A mere emotional whirlpool can't stop me!”

A strong sense of determination and divinity arises within the Emperor.

However, the emotional whirlpool doesn't disappear.

It continues to gnaw at his mind deep within.

The Emperor grits his teeth.

“What is this? Why won't it disappear?”

The Branch of Despair is a skill directly granted by the God of Despair.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The seed of despair, which had evolved to the next level, was a skill that ranked among the top tier of Taesan's skills, with a pure value that couldn't be compared to anything else.

Its power was unmatched, even when compared to the Emperor's. The guides of evil paths also couldn't handle the seed of despair and chose to resist it with their will.

The Emperor, too, was unable to focus on the battle due to the pain.

Taesan didn't miss that opportunity.

[You activated acceleration.] [You activated skill acceleration.]

In an instant, Taesan rushed towards the Emperor. Quickly kneeling down, he launched himself into a jump.

Kaahhh!

"Ugh!"

The Emperor, who had barely blocked the attack, shouted with a distorted face.

"I declare! I am Horaim's property! As long as Horaim doesn't permit it, mental interference is impossible for me!"

As soon as the rule was engraved, the effect of the branch of despair disappeared.

And the rule regarding black magic also disappeared. Taesan quickly gathered his magic.

Kukukukuku!

Black magic manifested continuously.

Chains bound the Emperor, and stormy arrows tore through space. A black wave engulfed the world.

[You activated Amun's dark seal.]

Tzeeeer!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Using the anchor, I struck the Emperor. The Emperor's body was blown back by the strong impact.

The Emperor gritted his teeth and declared again. With the rules in place, the dark magic lost its power.

"You!"

The Emperor, filled with anger, charged at Taesan.

With the rules in effect, it was difficult to block the Emperor's attack. So, Taesan didn't plan to block it.

[You activated the designated marker acceleration.]

Taesan's body moved rapidly backward. It was as if he had transcended space, and the Emperor's pupils dilated in shock.

"How!"

Taesan stomped his foot.

Using the designated marker acceleration, he traversed space in all directions. The Emperor was flustered and couldn't respond properly. It was an unprecedented ability.

The Emperor, who had been momentarily stunned, shouted roughly.

"This is the land of Lord Horai! To transcend space, you must first declare your position!"

A restriction was placed on space.

The Emperor charged roughly.

[You activated the designated marker acceleration.]

And Taesan moved back to the marker's location.

It wasn't about transcending space, but moving through space at high speed. There was no reason for the restriction on transcending space to apply.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The emperor's face contorted in anger.

"I did! I set the rules!"

As the new rules took effect, the restrictions on the spirits were lifted.

[You are the Wind Spirit King, and you summoned Minerva.]

"How dare you chase me away like that! That's too much!"

Minerva, filled with anger, unleashed a gust of wind. The divine aura surrounding the emperor was slowly thinning.

Taesan ridiculed the emperor.

The emperor was undoubtedly strong.

Even with a pure, straightforward attack, he wouldn't back down against Taesan, and the coercive power of his rules was an extremely selfish ability.

In reality, it was a power that could bind the opponent's entire body and fight.

If he could use it well, he could block most of Taesan's actions.

However, the emperor couldn't do that. He could only use his rules in a very simple way, and he couldn't properly grasp Taesan's power, wasting his strength.

It was because his battle experience was too lacking.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It wasn't an unusual thing. Even the strongest people in the outside world were only around level 30 or 40. But the Emperor, who was standing at the boundary, couldn't possibly have an equal fight with someone.

Maybe, after becoming a saint, he had never had a proper battle.

"It would have been harder to be a guide for sinners."

If they had the power of discipline, which came from their numerous experiences, they might have been able to knock down a mountain. The power of discipline was that great.

Power is not just about having it; it's about how you use it.

You need to learn how to utilize that power, how to respond to your opponent, and how to handle variables.

Only when you've mastered all of that can you truly be said to wield power.

That's why the gods created the labyrinth.

Power without experience is not intimidating at all. The Emperor declared and chased Minerva away again. Taking advantage of the opening, Taesan approached the Emperor.

[You activated acceleration.]

You thrust your sword strongly. The Emperor chose to dodge instead of blocking.

[You activated certain hit.]

Kwajik.

The sword's trajectory curved and pierced the Emperor's shoulder.

"What is this?! What is this?!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Emperor shouted fiercely. He couldn't understand the power that Taesan possessed. His ignorance led to confusion, and his confusion slowed down his actions.

Quadduk.

Taesan swung his sword, unleashing his power.

[You have activated the Call of Destruction.]

The power of destruction burst forth into the world.

The Emperor trembled with fear and wrapped his body in divine energy.

The Call of Destruction. This power, obtained by defeating the Demon King in the Ghost Realm, was far stronger than the spark of calamity.

Until now, he couldn't even control it properly, but now he could somewhat grasp it.

The all-consuming destruction engulfed the Emperor's divine energy. The divine energy began to visibly dwindle.

"The power of destruction can't be unleashed in a world that's not its origin!"

The Emperor barely managed to shout.

But as a result, the restrictions on his swordsmanship were lifted.

Taesan fiercely swung his sword.

[You have activated the Sword of Tenacity.]

The Emperor punched forward.

Zzeeeer!

The fist and sword clashed, and the divine energy was devoured. The Emperor's eyes widened as he summoned his power.

"Die!"

Kwaaaang!

The exploding divine energy engulfed Taesan.

But by then, Taesan was already gone.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan, who had moved to the side, gathered his magic. He had already prepared for the black magic.

The Emperor was enraged and charged at him. His anger clouded his mind. He thought he could ignore Taesan's black magic with his divine power and attack him.

Until now, Taesan's black magic had only scratched his divine power, but had not been able to harm him.

The Emperor rushed towards Taesan.

Taesan unleashed his magic.

[You have activated Beyond the Boundary.] [You have activated the Storm of Unthinkable Arrows.] [You have activated Forced Amplification.]

The storm of arrows, imbued with the power of the mortal realm, charged forward.

The Emperor instinctively realized that the power contained within could pierce his divine power.

But it was too late to respond. He tried to raise his divine power further, but the arrow pierced his divine power before he could.

Thud.

The storm of arrows pierced the Emperor's heart.

Kugugugung…….

"Cough."

The Emperor spat out blood. He stared blankly at his pierced chest.

He was a saint of Horai. Even if his heart was pierced, as long as his divine power was not completely consumed, he could recover.

Note: "Horai" is likely a reference to a fictional world or realm, and "saint" is used to translate the Korean term "사도", which can also mean "disciple" or "follower".
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, the heart pierced by the storm's arrow was not recovering.

The power contained in the arrow had a higher level than the emperor's own divine power, which was bound by the boundary.

"Hah."

The emperor let out a dry laugh. If it was this level, he could focus on recovering and would be able to recover in no time.

But the opponent in front of him wouldn't just stand by and watch.

"Is this all you've got?"

The emperor recalled the transcendent realm he had unfolded to the world.

Kiiiiing!

The power of the sacred artifact was concentrated into a single fist.

All the restrictions that bound the Taishan were released.

This was the power used in a desperate situation.

That was the emperor's trump card.

If he could just block this attack, it would all be over. There was no need to hold back anymore. Taishan grasped his sword.

 Clash.

The emperor leaped forward, swinging his fist to destroy everything.

Taishan also raised his sword to meet him.

The sword was dyed black.

And then, it was covered in gold.

As a result, a gray color was formed.

Kaang!

The power of the sacred artifact and the boundary line collided. The mixed gray power wildly opened its jaws and devoured the power of the sacred artifact.

"What is this?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Emperor was shocked. As a servant of God, he realized what the power of gray was.

That was a power that existed beyond mortality.

No, perhaps even more than that.

His thoughts were cut off. The gray exploded and engulfed his entire body.

* * *

"I've lost."

The Emperor, whose body was crushed, acknowledged his defeat. There was no great anger or despair on his face.

"I must apologize to Horai-nim for returning in such a state..."

A servant of God was a being who had offered their soul to God. For them, death was not the end. It was just a matter of abandoning their physical body and returning.

The Emperor's soul was released from his lifeless body.

"Oh..."

The sky opened up.

A powerful being appeared. The power that could be felt was extremely cold and devoid of warmth.

That was the God of Regulation, Horai.

"Oh, God..."

The Emperor gazed at Horai with a dazed expression.

Horai gazed back at the Emperor with a cold, unyielding stare.

The light in that gaze was extremely cruel.

"Oh, God?"

The Emperor was taken aback. Horai's gaze was never benevolent.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The emperor, who felt a sudden sense of fear, tried to flee, but there was nowhere to escape.

"Aaaaah!"

The power forcibly seized the emperor's soul, without any mercy, compassion, or pity. It was as if he was a tool that had outlived its usefulness, crushed and discarded.

The emperor let out a scream and disappeared.

[Your spiritual power has increased.]

The spiritual power increase system window appeared. Taesan slowly restored his divine energy and recovered his physical body.

"It's over now."

"Ah."

The child trembled with fear.

Taesan had controlled his powers during the battle to ensure the child was not harmed. As a result, the child did not have a single wound, even in the midst of the ruins.

Taesan said to the child, "The curse that tormented you is now gone."

The curse was one that the emperor had placed.

Now, the child was just an ordinary child with the pure blood of a god, nothing more.

"……."

The child stared blankly at Taesan, still unable to comprehend the reality.

"……Everyone around me has died."

The child's family had lost their lives at the hands of the emperor.

"The world will still hate me, won't it?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The child was still a cursed child to the world. Perhaps the reason the temple was destroyed and the emperor disappeared was because of the child's curse, and they could have been even more oppressed because of it.

"I'm still a cursed child. That hasn't changed. But..."

The child looked up at Taesan.

Taesan had fought against the emperor for the child's sake, for their own sake.

"Still... I'll survive in this world."

Trials would still come to find them, but they would live on for Taesan's sake.

That was the child's final decision.

Taesan nodded.

"That's your choice, then."

At the same time, Taesan's body disappeared.

The quest had ended, and they had moved to the labyrinth.

"Taesan-nim?"

The child looked around the place for a moment, then slowly took a step forward.

They would suffer and struggle, but they would survive in the world. The child had decided.

But there was a problem.

What would they live for?

They had no purpose.

They had wanted a normal life, but that was no longer possible. And the child no longer desired normalcy.

As the child pondered for a moment, one place flashed through their mind.

"Did I say labyrinth?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The child and Taesan wandered around, sharing many stories.

Among them was a story about the labyrinth.

A place where strong warriors from all over the world gather. A place where you can become stronger if you can survive.

Taesan said he was going down to that place.

"...... Maybe."

The child had decided on a goal to live for. With an unwavering step, the child moved forward.

* * *

[It's over.]

"...... If only you had waited a little longer."

[Don't you think that's a good ending too?]

The voice of the god of choice, speaking with a smile, was filled with satisfaction.

[That child will live on and make countless choices in the future... and eventually, they'll end up here. It'll be an interesting time.]

Maria chuckled.

[You did very, very well. You showed me everything I wanted to see.]

So, she was going to give him a fitting reward.

Maria said that, and with a flick of her wrist, a powerful energy began to manifest on Taesan's hand.
