Chapter 544

544. The Treasure Box of the Usurper (2)

"That's the answer."

Taesan murmured. The green witch quietly lowered her body, waiting for Taesan's response.

"Reaching a high position is correct, but our situations are very different."

Taesan could have reached the top alone from the beginning.

It was just that the usurper's existence had blocked him from doing so.

Therefore, by abandoning his usurper-tainted self and filling himself with a new self, he could reach the pinnacle.

However, the green witch was not the same. She had not been tainted by the usurper's corruption. Her pinnacle was that of an immortal.

Taesan's solution could not be applied to the green witch. The green witch's eyes sank as she listened to the story.

"That's...right."

"If I say that the path to becoming a transcendent is unknown...even I don't know."

Originally, Taesan was not a transcendent. The green witch's desired destination was in a different realm.

Although they seemed similar, there was a fundamental difference, making it impossible to explain.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Then... can you see one thing?"

"What is it."

"It's me."

The green witch lifted her head.

"Can you read me?"

She spoke with a very desperate tone.

Taesan, who had been gazing at her for a moment, nodded his head.

"If you want to."

"Thank you."

The green witch laid everything bare in front of Taesan. Taesan gazed at her, revealing himself.

There was no need to activate any skills.

At this moment, Taesan could observe all things.

Moreover, if he were to reveal himself like the green witch, he could grasp everything about her.

Taesan's gaze pierced through the green witch.

"Ah..."

The green witch's body trembled for a moment. Every organ, every muscle in her body was exposed, without a single thing hidden.

But she didn't back down and revealed herself.

And Taesan saw it.

The thing she had built up over her entire life.

It was by no means a small quantity or quality. It was like a massive tower. The green witch had more than enough qualifications to reach immortality.

'…….'
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But that was all."

"There was nothing more to see."

"The tower was grand and majestic, but its limits were clear."

Taesan looked away.

"How do I explain this?"

"Did you see...?"

Taesan thought for a moment and spoke directly.

"You've built a lot and reached immortality. But... what you've built isn't enough to reach greatness."

"Then what's the solution?"

"There isn't one. At least, not for now."

Taesan said calmly.

The tower built by the green witch had reached its limit.

It couldn't be built any higher, and if they tried, it would collapse and everything would be lost.

"Is that how limits are created?"

"If you build something wrong from the start, you'll soon hit a wall and can't reach the top alone."

Taesan had expected this to some extent, but seeing it firsthand was a new experience. Taesan said to the green witch:

"......"

The green witch's eyes trembled greatly as she listened to the story.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Reaching the highest realm. She had been longing for it her whole life.

But now, she received an answer that the possibility itself was blocked. Her head drooped to the ground.

"......Then."

The green witch's lips slowly opened.

She lifted her head and gazed at the towering mountain.

Her eyes still held an unquenchable passion.

"You're saying my tower is the problem?"

"At least, that's the case for now."

"I see. This is the problem. This is......"

The green witch muttered to herself alone. It seemed she had come to a conclusion, and she stood up from her seat, bowing her head.

"I sincerely thank you. Great one."

What the towering mountain had just revealed was a precious value of the world.

It was one of the secrets known only to the transcenders.

The fact that she had been told this because of her contract was a miraculous opportunity for the green witch,

"Then, may I make one request?"

"Go ahead."

"If, later on, I make one request...... will you grant it?"

"If it's not too much trouble. Anything is fine."

"Thank you for agreeing."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The green witch said so and waved her hand.

[The contract with the green witch has been terminated.]

The contract of gaze that had been connected between Taesan and her was severed.

It was the green witch who had given up herself.

"Is that okay?"

"I've received the answer I wanted. Sharing a gaze with someone as great as you is a waste."

The green witch slowly backed away. Taesan asked her.

"What are you going to do now?"

"I'll find an answer based on what the great one has said. And if it doesn't come out... I'll come back again."

With those words, the green witch left.

It was easy to guess what she was going to do. And what she wanted from Taesan.

"I hope it goes well."

Taesan also supported her, having received something from her.

And Taesan confirmed the power given to him by Lakiratas.

[Death born from struggle] [Death's violence that seeks to kill everything except its own master.]

"How can I use this?"

Since it was a power in itself, it couldn't be used carelessly. He became worried.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I thought about creating a direction with equipment, but I didn't think there was a material that could hold the power.

After a moment of contemplation, Taesan made a decision.

He merged part of the power with the power of transcendence.

Taesan made the death that occurred through struggle touch his chest.

Kwaddduk!

And death and self-transcendence collided.

The two opposing concepts resisted each other, rejecting and pushing each other away.

It was a natural resistance. Mixing the power of the gods and the transcendent was impossible from the start.

But Taesan had a boundary.

"Listen to me."

With a quiet word, the beast arose. It brutally suppressed the death that occurred through struggle and self-transcendence, overpowering them.

Kkugukkukuk.

The two concepts that refused to be controlled and resisted were forced to become one.

And soon, they transformed into a new power.

[The death that occurred through struggle and self-transcendence transformed. They obtained transcendence [boundary negation].]

"It was easier than I thought."

It wasn't difficult to suppress the backlash. It seemed meaningful that self-transcendence had changed to be perfectly controlled due to the boundary."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Transcendence: Boundary Denial] [Proficiency: 13%] [Denial of all interference. This world's, and not this world's. Rejecting and denying everything that interferes with you, and trying to kill.]

The dark energy that had enveloped the mountain range had turned into a grayish hue.

And its nature had also changed. While self-immutability had calmly and coldly blocked external interference, boundary denial was more violent.

Ka-ga-gak.

The boundary denial that had enveloped the mountain range was now hostile towards the concepts of the world that tried to reach the mountain, trampling and trying to kill them. The mountain had grasped boundary denial. Only then did the swaying gray energy settle down a bit.

"Aggressive, indeed."

A power that opposed everything that approached the mountain. As it had changed from black to gray, its intensity and strength had also increased.

"I think I can block Rakiratas's attacks a few times with this..."

I wasn't sure about its full power, but I thought I could block attacks with sincerity at least two or three times.

If it was effective to that extent, it was a great change. The mountain was satisfied.

"Then..."

I had confirmed everything I needed to.

It was time to head down to the labyrinth now.

But the wizard still hadn't appeared.

"How long do I have to wait?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was the moment when Taesan was murmuring to himself.

Suddenly.

The space was torn apart just as he finished speaking.

* * *

"There's still work to be done."

The wizard who created the labyrinth appeared, looking exhausted.

"It's still... now it's finally organized. The direction is set too. Sorry to keep you waiting."

The wizard, who had stepped into the labyrinth, looked at Taesan and was taken aback.

"...I see something strange."

The boundary that surrounded Taesan was showing hostility towards the wizard.

"Wait."

Taesan spoke quietly, and the boundary slowly dissipated, following its master's will.

"Hmm... I got something strange again in just a moment."

The wizard muttered to himself, but didn't ask any questions. Anyway, he couldn't understand Taesan's power and scope, so there was no need to try to accept it.

Taesan asked the wizard:

"Can I go down to the labyrinth?"

Even Taesan, who had become a cultivator, could go down to the labyrinth.

In response to that question, the wizard nodded.

"It doesn't matter. As I said before, I'll create a new floor just for you."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Now that it's come to this, I wonder if I can really do it."

It's possible to confront Rakirates as well. But to do that, the quest in the labyrinth has to be of a certain level, and finding something like that was almost impossible.

The magician nodded in agreement, with a wry smile.

"I've had a lot of worries about that too. But since I've said it, I have to keep my promise. And... although it's a bit uncertain, I've found something suitable."

The magician pointed to the stairs with his hand.

"Go ahead. There's someone waiting for you."

Taesan went down the stairs.

[96th Floor Quest Begins.] [Find the Origin of Arilnan.] [Reward: Arilnan's Authority.] [Secret Reward: ???]

Arilnan.

It was a name that existed in Taesan's memory.

Taesan opened the door. There was a single woman with snow-white skin inside. Her hair and eye color were a dull, ash-like gray.

She had an exotic, yet ordinary appearance, with features that were somehow different from others.

Akasha spoke quietly.

[Oh, Goddess.]

"It's been a long time. You're the child who was my apostle."

[The Forgotten Goddess. Arilnan has appeared.]

* * *

Arilnan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's been a long time, hasn't it? My benefactor."

"It has been a long time."

Taesan was slightly surprised. He hadn't expected Arinlan to be waiting for him on the 96th floor.

And as the system had explained, the 96th floor quest was related to Arinlan.

Arinlan, who had been gazing at Taesan with a piercing stare, opened her mouth.

"The smell is gone."

The smell was one thing. Arinlan had said that she had detected a faint scent of a usurper when she first met Taesan.

The fact that it was gone now meant...

"It's become even stronger, but... at least that smell doesn't come out. It's a good thing from my perspective."

Arinlan looked satisfied. Taesan looked at the wizard.

"Is she the one who gave you the 96th floor quest?"

"Yes."

The wizard nodded. His expression as he looked at Arinlan was very subtle.

"I knew you. I saw you right in front of me, but I couldn't remember anything."

"I remember you, wizard. But the you I remember is very different from the one now."

Arinlan said with a mysterious smile.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even before, I was different from other transcendents, pursuing strange things on my own, but I never thought I'd create a space like this. Back then and now, I still can't understand you. For mortals, to abandon oneself like that..."

"......Only someone who truly knows me can say that."

However, the magician still couldn't understand Arilnan.

Arilnan said calmly.

"It's because the usurper usurped me. It's natural that you can't know me."

Arilnan had lost everything. If it weren't for Akasha, she would have been forever forgotten.

But Taesan, who saw Arilnan after a long time, realized one fact.

She was more deeply etched into this world.

"Did you remember something?"

"Ah, yes."

Arilnan smiled satisfactorily. She looked at Akasha.

"It's because you've become more distinct. The memories of those who remember me have become clearer. As a result, I was able to recall one fact."

"What is it?"

"Me."

Arilnan revealed her teeth.

"The me I was before I lost myself, my own concept that the damn usurper stole. That's what's in the usurper's treasure box."

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
