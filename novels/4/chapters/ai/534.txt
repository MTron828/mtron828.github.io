**Chapter 535**

**535. The Temple of the Gods (1)**

The Invitation to the Temple of the Gods.

Taesan gazed at the wizard, who began to explain slowly.

"Do you know that the balance has been broken?"

"I couldn't not know."

The usurper and the essence had broken the seal of the transcenders, who had expelled the high gods.

As a result, the energy of the high gods was slowly spreading throughout the universe.

"For now, the transcenders are gathering to try to suppress it, but it's impossible to restore the broken vase to its original state. It's likely that their influence will only grow stronger over time. So... we need to prepare too."

The wizard spoke calmly.

There was only one preparation to be made.

The war against the high gods.

"I knew it would come back someday, but I didn't expect it to start so soon. Essence, it's not enough to tear it apart and throw it to the other side of the universe."

"I understand the situation, but what does that have to do with me going to the Temple of the Gods?"

"You're involved too," the wizard replied briefly.

The wizard's gaze at Taesan was tinged with a hint of difficulty.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Most of the gods in the labyrinth, including myself, like you. It's not an exaggeration to say that we adore you. There's no reason for us to be hostile towards you. But... the gods outside are a different story."

This wasn't a new conversation. The god of death had already tried to kill Taesan, and it wasn't unusual for other gods to do the same.

"You're an irregular, Taesan."

His finger points at Taesan.

Distorted and twisted, neither a being of this world nor the other side. Even transcendents couldn't accurately describe what he was.

"More than half of the gods think you're on the side of the high gods."

"Me?"

Taesan spoke quietly, and the magician shook his head.

"Of course, we who have watched you from the side think differently, but at least they believe that. The transcendents outside claim that you need to be dealt with. As the crack grows and the high gods begin to appear, they say we need to eliminate the internal instability factor."

It wasn't a completely wrong judgment.

If the high gods directly influenced the world, Taesan's existence would be a source of anxiety. The transcendent Essence had already betrayed the universe, and it was natural to suspect Taesan, who was even more unusual.

"This is going to be a hassle."
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$"So that there are no more problems, then."

The magician waves their hand, and a door appears in the space before you. Through it, you can feel a brilliant golden aura.

"If you can prove yourself before the gods, they will no longer interfere with you."

"Is this some kind of trial, then?"

"Yes, that's right. To be honest, I think I need your help."

A warped existence.

Taesan was able to kill the god and purge the world's corruption. Although the magician doesn't know where the boundary of this otherness lies, they are confident that it will be of help to them at least.

"If things go well this time, even the transcendents won't interfere with you anymore. It will be liberating."

From Taesan's perspective, it wasn't a bad deal.

In the end, if you leave the maze, you will have no choice but to continue to collide with the transcendents. It would be better to tidy things up now if possible.

"Alright."

Taesan nodded his head. The magician smiled broadly.

"Alright. But there is one problem... Do you have the qualifications to enter the trial?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Do you need qualifications? When Maria called me before, I went without any problems."

"That's because Maria called you, a mortal, to her own shrine. It feels a bit different. This time, she's calling you to the entire pantheon. Those who don't have qualifications can't enter."

The wizard looked at Taesan with an ambiguous gaze.

"I think you have the qualifications now."

"You don't know either."

"I don't know. I can't read it."

Like the fundamental gods, the wizard couldn't understand Taesan either. Where was he reaching, and what was his exact level? It was unclear.

"Since you have the power of physical strength, I suppose you have the qualifications."

"Physical strength, huh? I suppose that's enough, but..."

The wizard had a strange expression.

The power of physical strength. In itself, it wasn't that surprising. What Taesan showed on earth was a physical strength that even the wizard had never seen before.

It was closer to a kind of authority than physical strength. It was natural that Taesan had acquired that authority.

However, the fact that Taesan could dominate the concept of physical strength was possible because the system of the labyrinth existed.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was not unreasonable to think that a transcendent being was born through his system.

"Amazing. This is it."

The magician muttered to himself. Taesan stepped forward towards the door. The brilliant golden light enveloped Taesan.

Taesan arrived without any resistance.

"I'm here."

And Taesan had arrived.

In a vast space with dozens, hundreds of temples shrouded in darkness.

[The Pantheon welcomes you.]

* * *

It was different from when he came at Maria's invitation before. Back then, he only saw Maria's temple, but this time, he saw temples of other gods as well.

"......There are many."

The number was enormous.

The number of temples scattered at a certain distance exceeded several dozen, reaching into the hundreds.

All of them were transcendent beings who governed concepts.

And as soon as Taesan arrived, he felt the gaze of the transcendent beings.

Most of them were filled with hostility, wariness, and killing intent.

The direct killing intent of the transcendent beings enveloped Taesan.

That in itself was a single attack."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If you're an immortal, you can't even resist and your body will be trampled to death. Even if you're a god, it's no different. Dozens of beings with high levels of power are sending standardized emotions. Even if you try to hold on with your divine power, you'll be consumed in an instant and crushed.

"Hmm."

But Taesan didn't show any particular excitement.

The self-immutable aura surrounding his entire body didn't waver.

It turned the malice of the transcenders into something meaningless. Taesan muttered calmly.

"It's brutal."

"Don't worry about it too much. Those who are already showing their emotions don't have the authority to decide your fate anyway."

"......I see."

The transcenders sending malice to Taesan right now weren't that strong.

There was a huge difference in power compared to Mariana Lakiratas, not to mention Essence.

Taesan realized what kind of transcenders they were.

They weren't transcenders who governed a grand concept, but rather small ones. They were the ones sending malice to Taesan right now.

"Don't mind them. Just follow me for now."

Taesan walked through the black and white space. A large building stood before him.

"We have something to take care of right now, so wait for a bit. I'll handle it quickly and call you again."

"Can I wait here?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's just talk. This is a temporary shelter I made for you. I'll call you soon."

"Is that okay?"

Taesan turned his gaze away.

The enemy's hatred and murderous intent towards him still existed.

The magician spoke in a nonchalant tone.

"Don't worry about it. I don't plan on making it a problem. If it bothers you, you can handle it yourself. That's your freedom."

"Then that's fine."

Taesan nodded his head.

* * *

The interior of the building was extremely luxurious.

The walls shone brightly. The curtains seemed to be embroidered with light. The sofa was springy and elastic.

It was the most superior room one could imagine.

But there was no chair.

Taesan thought so, and in that instant, a chair was created in front of him.

"Wow."

Taesan's eyes widened in surprise.

The fact itself was not surprising. It was likely the power of a god residing in the temple. Even if a transcendent being with the power of creation existed, it wouldn't be unusual.

What surprised him was that he had momentarily grasped the process of how his thoughts were synchronized with the power, and a chair was created through the operation of that power and concept.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$It could be read.

"Where have you reached."

Tae-san sat down on the chair. Bardei mumbled in a trembling voice.

[I didn't know I would enter a state of utter devastation...]

"You've been here before, haven't you?"

When I met Maria, Bardei was also there. But when Tae-san spoke, Bardei denied it.

[It wasn't a state of utter devastation back then. It was just that we only saw Maria at that time. If we include Lakyrathas who came later, there were two of them. But here... it's truly a state of utter devastation.]

A place where all the gods of the universe gather, their abode. Bardei's voice showed no sign of subsiding.

[The most important and magnificent space in the universe. I never thought I would come to this place in my life...] [I don't have any memories of coming here either.]

"Only those who are qualified can enter. I don't know if I am qualified or not."

It was vague.

The sanctuary accepted Tae-san, but he couldn't be called a god.

'What a coincidence, I have some free time.'
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan tried to observe himself again, to understand himself better.

‘…….’

But it didn't work out.

He could read his own inner self and know what he was, but he couldn't make a correct judgment about his own state.

‘I need an opponent.’

Taesan thought so and released his observation. The blocked senses around him began to feel again.

And as a result, Taesan realized.

Someone was approaching him.

And that person had hostility towards Taesan.

‘It's a feeling in my memory.’

Taesan opened the door. There was a man with a distorted face. A being adorned with gold appeared.

[You.]

A gaze filled with hostility was directed at Taesan.

[You are the beautifully adorned god of swords. You have encountered Mantra.]

* * *

Mantra.

He had a human-like appearance, except for the fact that he had no hair. He had a typical handsome face.

The difference was that every part of his body was made of gold.

His fingertips, eyes, and lips were all gold in color.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It felt like I was seeing a massive castle made of gold.

"It's been a while."

Taesan said calmly. He was a transcender who had clashed with the gods on the battlefield of the gods and ultimately failed to achieve his goal.

Taesan's response made Mantra's face distort.

"[It's been a while?]

Anger was brewing. The emotion was taking shape and began to press down on Taesan.

"[You, a twisted existence, dare to set foot in this place. You don't even know your place.]

"I didn't come in. The wizard invited me."

"[How dare you talk back?]

The anger was overflowing. A rough energy was rushing towards Taesan.

When they first met, Taesan had felt pressured by Mantra.

He had felt an absolute power and dignity that was impossible to reach, an unyielding force.

But now...

Taesan gazed at Mantra with a calm expression.

"You're getting annoyed."

"[What did you say?]

"You're getting angry and impatient. It's not just simple hostility or anger towards me."

"[...What are you talking about?]

"I understand."

Taesan nodded.

"You're afraid of me."
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Previously, in the battleground of the gods, he had tried to kill Mantra, the titan.

It wouldn't have been strange for Tansan to seek revenge.

And it's usually best to not interfere with the conflicts among transcendents. Tansan had determined to kill Mantra, and there was no one to stop him.

So, Mantra was afraid.

He feared that Tansan would turn hostile and attack him. It was as if he was barking like a frightened dog.

'This is being heard.'

Mantra could perceive a tiny bit of emotion from the transcendent. It was a very strange sensation. Tansan said, cutting off his thoughts,

"There's no need to worry. I don't have any interest in you anymore."

[........you.]

"No, can I speak informally to you now?"

Tansan spoke softly.

"I don't have any interest anymore, so you don't have to worry."

That incident was too trivial for the current Tansan.

Mantra's expression stiffened.

Kiiiiying!

Golden swords were materialized. The brilliant things started to fill the world.

Mantra's power was targeting Tansan.

And the fact was, it didn't stir any emotion in Tansan.
