Chapter 196

196. The Earth on the Brink of Destruction (1)

Taesan closed his eyes and began to gather his thoughts.

First of all, it's not a fantasy. He's savoring the flavor of the melon.

The rough sensation of the table against his buttocks.

The wind blowing against his cheeks.

And the ominous aura coming from beyond the sky.

All of these things cannot be false. This is not a fantasy or a lie, but real.

But what kind of real was the problem.

Taesan looked at Joo-geun. Joo-geun's body subtly hid as Taesan's gaze pierced through him, as if he had stopped eating.

"Why are you looking at me like that?"

"Just that."

Taesan gave a vague answer, and Joo-geun's expression suddenly changed.

Taesan realized from Joo-geun's reaction that it was not just a simple reenactment of his memories. Joo-geun's reaction was completely different from before.

This was truly realized. The world before the destruction.

Of course, it's not really that time. Taesan thought about the methods one by one.

'......Is it a kind of realization?'

Interfering with time itself...
Here is the translation of the text:

At that time, I called up the time and temporarily implemented everything. Then, the explanation was complete.

"What is the power of the gods? Is it possible to achieve that much?"

I twisted time itself to summon it. I knew that their power was close to infinite, but I didn't think it was possible to achieve that much. I was shocked.

However, it seemed that even the gods found it difficult.

There was a sentence that said that Aphrodite's area of influence would greatly decrease when she implemented the time of her past life.

Until then, no other gods had shown such a sentence. It meant that they had to suffer significant losses to achieve that.

Tai Shan looked at Jin Zhong with an awkward expression while holding a potato.

Jin Zhong was a rough and boisterous person.

He wanted to save people.

However, as time passed, he had seen too many deaths and became exhausted. His face was filled with fatigue.

"I didn't think I would see this face again."

Tai Shan smiled wryly.

"It's good to see you, brother."

* * *

"......brother."

Jin Zhong put down the potato with a trembling hand.

"What's wrong?"

"I'm fine."

Here is the translation of the text:

"No, I think you've made a mistake. You're not really saying that, are you?"

"Shut up."

As Tae-san's worried face appeared, he trembled with fear.

It had been a long time since he saw the old, worn-out face of Jung-geun. He was clearly happy and joyful, but Tae-san thought coldly.

"This isn't real."

They had already died. The earth had perished like that.

This is what God had distorted time to temporarily manifest. It was just a mere puppet.

But Tae-san didn't feel bad.

The ghost had stopped speaking suddenly.

Tae-san thought as he ate the potato again.

God had brought them here for one reason.

They had lost. They had been exterminated by monsters, and Tae-san had also failed to defeat the demons.

They had perished, and that was his despair.

So, this time, let's win against that despair.

It was a trial with a hidden meaning.

Tae-san strengthened his grip on his hand.

"No, it's definitely strange."

Jung-geun looked at Tae-san with a creepy gaze, and Tae-san snapped his fingers.

"It's done, it's done already."

Kuuuung!
Here is the translation of the text:

At that time, a commotion was heard from the other side. The commotion was getting louder and louder, with no signs of stopping.

"...Brother, is that a hard mode player over there?"

"Yeah."

Tai Shan got up from his seat and went out under the awning. Middle-aged man was watching him blankly, and only followed him later.

"Brother, you're always complaining about something, but today you're being unusually quiet. It seems like something's wrong..."

"Yeah, that's right."

Tai Shan clenched his fist. Middle-aged man slightly bowed his body.

"No, it's just a strange feeling."

"It's just a mental change."

A man was shouting at the commotion-filled location.

"Don't laugh! This is ridiculous! This is a hidden camera! Don't play around!"

"Young friend, this is the Earth. While you were trapped in the labyrinth, the world has changed a lot..."

"Don't laugh!"

The man roughly swung his fist. The middle-aged man who was calming him down let out a sigh and stepped back.

"Tai Shan, you're here?"

The man who looked like he was about to get a headache rubbed his forehead, looking pale when he saw Tai Shan.

"I was going to bring you, but you got here first! What's going on?"

"That's what I mean. Your brother has changed somehow."

"Really?"

(Note: I translated "형님" as "brother", but it can also be translated as "older brother" or "senior" depending on the context.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"Chung-geun ran away in a hurry."

Tae-san smiled slightly and approached the man who was walking quickly.

"What's your name, young man?"

"...I Chang-chun."

"Ah, Chang-chun."

Even thinking about it now, the man was pitiful. They had defeated the monsters on their last return and closed the gap in the sky.

But now, he believed that it was possible to rebuild the earth, and he had been working hard to conquer the labyrinth, only to return to a earth that was about to perish.

"I'm sorry, but this is a earth that's about to perish. The situation has changed, you know. If you can't accept it, you'll have to take it like a punch."

"...Who are you?"

"Kang Tae-san."

"Kang Tae-san?"

"That guy who always talks big but can't back it up?"

Tae-san nodded his head. Chang-chun jeered at Tae-san.

"Ha! Is the easy mode player going to take on the hard mode player?"

"But until now, that's how it was. But now, it's a little different."

He's not the easy mode player anymore.

Tae-san took a step back. In an instant, his body disappeared.

The speed was so fast that Chang-chun's eyes widened in amazement.
(Note: The translation may not be perfect, please let me know if you have any further requests.)
Here is the translation of the text:

But he was still a hard-mode player who had risked his life to train. He moved his sword according to his instincts.

Ka-a-ang!

"It's blocked...!"

It was when people believed in him the most. Ichangchun flew straight at the block, and people's eyes widened in shock.

Kuu-uuu!

Ichangchun rolled around, colliding with the destroyed buildings.

People stared blankly at the mountain.

The mountain calmly walked towards the place where Ichangchun had flown off.

"Ugh...".

Ichangchun struggled to get up, and after seeing the mountain, he let out a fierce cry and swung his sword.

The mountain lightly extended his hand to restrain Ichangchun and pinned him to the ground.

"Eek! Ah!"

The mountain spoke softly to Ichangchun, who was struggling.

"You're the same, aren't you? You're going to deny it. You only imagined a hopeful future, but suddenly this happened."

There was resentment and a sense of powerlessness in Ichangchun's eyes.

The mountain released the hand that had restrained him.

"But we're like this now. What can we do? We have to make an effort to survive again. We've always done it that way, after all."

"...Damn it."

Tears welled up in his eyes.

People who had arrived late cautiously consoled Ichangchun.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan turned around. Zhong Jun spoke carefully.

"Brother, you've definitely changed."

"Are you just talking nonsense again?"

"No, it's not that. There are some weak points, too."

Zhong Jun slapped his face. Tai Shan subdued I Chang Chun with only simple movements without using any skills.

Tai Shan is a player who takes the lead with skills. Considering that I Chang Chun is a hard player who is difficult to subdue, it was an impossible feat.

However, what Zhong Jun was saying was not that.

"It just seems like you've become something bad. Until now, I've been making everyone into a half-dead state and making them listen to me. This is the first time I've seen you simply subdue someone and then release them."

"Ah."

Tai Shan realized what Zhong Jun was trying to say and laughed.

In his previous life, he had only hidden it and was furious with everyone.

Why are you all so weak?

Why can't even a self-proclaimed expert like yourself win?

Why do you avoid learning and acquiring skills, saying it's difficult?

Is that why we didn't perish?
Here is the translation of the text:

He was filled with only that emotion. Until his last moment, he had been harboring anger towards others.

That was because he regretted his wrong choice of choosing the easy mode and it overlapped with his emotions, making him feel anxious.

As a result, he had always become irritable.

Although he knew it was wrong, he couldn't control himself. He thought that if he didn't release his emotions, he would go crazy.

"What, now my emotions are released, aren't they?"

"Really?"

Middle-aging's expression seemed to calm down.

Taesan looked at Middle-aging's face, realizing that he had been constantly watching him. In his previous life, he had been unaware of the anger that had filled him.

'This is as expected.'

It wasn't bad. Still.

Just then, a commotion came from the other side again.

"Looks like another hard mode player has arrived, doesn't it?"

"No, that's Taeyoung."

Taesan looked at the end. Then he said,

"I'm sorry, but can you hide for a bit? I'm not sure if it's visible or not."

"Okay?"

"What, not to you. It's to the one who can't see."

* * *

Taesan entered the only intact house.
Here is the translation of the text:

There were various decorative items and wall paintings at that place. The house was decorated in a tasteful manner, but in this crazy world, no one cared about decorations.

If there was one, it would be an abnormal person.

Or maybe someone who wanted to hide something.

“Did you come here?”

A woman with long black hair sat on a luxurious red leather sofa, looking discontented. She proudly raised her index finger.

“Isn't that pretty? I brought it back from the art museum this time.”

On the tip of her finger was a large portrait.

The portrait, which was as big as a person's torso, had not a single speck of dust or a single crease.

In a world where all kinds of monsters overflowed, and one couldn't even predict what tomorrow would bring, she had brought that portrait back to this place, cherishing it like her life.

Tae-san nodded his head in approval.

“It's not bad.”

“……”

Ite-yun's face trembled.

She asked hesitantly, her voice trembling.

“…… Did something go wrong?”

“No, I just said it's not bad.”

“Huh…… Is that so?”

Ite-yun buried her face in the sofa, looking flustered.

Tae-san looked at her.

Ite-yun, who was usually feeble and always screaming, was now mature and refined, like a woman who had gone through the flow of time.
Here is the translation of the text:

She was lying on the chair with a relaxed expression, but her face was filled with anxiety. Her eyes seemed to be rolling around as if she was frightened by something.

I didn't know her reaction in her past life. She was at her limits, after all.

But now I know.

She was terrified.

She looked at me with a nervous face and spoke.

"Hard mode player, did you get scolded?"

"Yeah."

"That's amazing. A hard mode player, getting scolded by an easy mode player...".

She sent a strange gaze and opened her mouth.

"Status window."

[Itealyen] [Level: 258] [Health: 45810/45810] [Mana: 7020/7020] [Strength: 10152] [Intelligence: 9899] [Agility: 13254] [Attack power + 5421] [Defense power + 8456] [Target is in a state of fear.]

The numbers were high. A normal hard mode player would be able to deal a fatal blow with these stats.

But now Taesan knows. These stats aren't that high after all.

'As expected, I missed a lot.'
Here is the translation of the text:

"Currently, Tai Shan's level is 91, but his vitality has dropped to around 20,000. His stats are also all around 4,000.

Thinking about what I got from the depths, I thought Tai Shan had abandoned everything and fallen.

But he still had the strength similar to his past life.

"'Show me your status window.'"

"'No way.'"

Tai Shan refused.

I didn't expect him to refuse, so I frowned.

"'Why? It's not worn out. Show me.'"

"'I'm sorry, but it's not possible.'"

He's not in the same mode as now. If he shows it, it would be a considerable confusion.

Tai Shan looked at me quietly, and I scowled.

"'You're acting strange. Show me your status window.'"
