**Chapter 419**

**419. 83rd Floor, the Essence of Falling God (1)**

First, I had to figure out how to deal with the devil's domain. I had to confirm that first.

Taesan expressed his will. As a result, the domain changed its form in various ways according to his will.

Kugugung!

Cliffs emerged, and massive mountain ranges rose up in the distance. When I waved my hand, the mountain ranges collapsed, and a vast plain was created.

This was Taesan's domain.

No matter how I changed the terrain, it was all according to Taesan's mind.

Taesan, who had been changing the domain, realized that his actions had no meaning.

The domain's appearance changed, but it was only superficial. There was no change in power.

A different power was needed.

It wasn't hard to guess what that power was.

Magic flowed out of Taesan's body. The magic that flowed out spread throughout his domain.

Kugugung!

At the same time, the domain began to change fundamentally.

This was a different, essential change from when I changed the domain with just my will.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a sensation as if he was expanding his own body and adjusting it to his will.

Taesan focused his will on the magic that was spreading throughout the territory.

What he desired was a sharp, heavy, and dark wind that could cut through mountains and divide the sea.

The spreading magic responded to his will and began to change.

Whoosh!

Then, the wind blew. Its color was black.

A thick, dark wind that overflowed with static electricity began to swirl around the territory.

"Is this the feeling?"

Right now, Taesan was thinking of the beginner-level black magic, Seir's black wind, which he had acquired, and was using his magic.

Then, a real black wind began to blow in his territory.

Taesan swung his hand. The scattered black wind gathered, and soon became a storm.

Rrraaah!

A rough, dark storm swept away everything in its path. In an instant, a vast open space was created.

Using magic to inject power into the territory and create a phenomenon, and then summoning that phenomenon. That was what black magic was all about.

But for now, it was not easy to use. Taesan opened his status window."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**Status**

* Level: 171
* Protection: 25,162/25,162
* Health: 260,901/260,901
* Mana: 23,558/23,558
* Magic: 3,244/5,798
* Strength: 47,027
* Agility: 47,558
* Intelligence: 42,221
* Attack Power +12,238
* Defense Power +7,422
* The target is in the best condition.

"It's too expensive to use magic."

Creating a black wind required 2,500 magic points.

It seemed difficult to use it perfectly right away.

However, it was possible to create his own black magic. The advantage was that he could create the necessary black magic according to the situation and conditions.

[……Huh.]

The ghost lost its words and let out a sigh.

He had acquired the domain of the devil. The domain of the 72 devils that had existed since the creation of the world.

It was an astonishing event that was different from anything that had happened before.

[You're not human, are you? You're not a transcendent being or a devil's incarnation?]

"I'm human."

Taesan replied with a hint of humor. He was human. Even if he was mixed with something else, his essence didn't change.

[Then, can I consider you a transcendent being?]

A transcendent being who rules over their own domain.

However, Taesan denied that as well.

"No. This is clearly a domain I possess, but it's not my own domain."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Finally, the devil's realm. It was a realm that only he could build and possess. He was now close to being an immortal with a realm.

"Hmm."

He was troubled.

What kind of dark magic should he create?

The power that only he could use, Taesan's power.

The answer didn't come easily.

"I'll think about it later."

What could he do with his realm? He needed to understand it all.

Recovering the magic consumed by his realm wasn't difficult. Taesan recovered the black wind.

From now on, what he needed was to increase the total amount of magic. Fortunately, he had obtained a skill that would greatly help him with that.

[Special Passive Skill: Dark Lord] [Proficiency: 1%] [The master of darkness itself. When you defeat an enemy, you acquire magic. Moreover, you absorb the faint darkness around you to constantly acquire magic.]

It was a skill that assisted in acquiring magic.

When he defeated an enemy, he acquired magic, and even when he just stood still, he absorbed the magic around him, causing his magic to increase. It was the most suitable skill for his current situation.

And now, Taesan had obtained the devil's realm and taken the 72nd seat of the devil. He had essentially become closer to being a dark magician."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, the restrictions on dark magic were lifted.

[Special passive skill: Master of Dark Magic] [Dark magic is the power to summon the power that exists in the demon's realm. As the master of that realm, you have no restrictions on using dark magic.]

There was only one restriction. Taesan raised his arm.

[You activated the distorted ecosystem of Dekaravia.]

Kwagagaga!

The roots that penetrate the world. His entire body is summoned. Taesan's realm spreads roughly, filling the space.

A smile appeared on Taesan's lips.

Dark magic is the power to summon the power that exists in the demon's realm.

In other words, to wield the true power of dark magic, one must open a path to the demon's realm.

However, opening that path took a considerable amount of time. So, until now, we've been using magic first to buy time and then linking it to dark magic. It's powerful, but it's a significant restriction that forces our actions.

But now, the restriction of opening that path has disappeared.

"It's good."

This alone was worth clearing the trial."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan opened the space and returned to the labyrinth.

At the same time, a system window appeared, announcing the clear.

[Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [You obtained the Belt of Dark Water, which was made from the skin of a creature living in the deepest part of darkness.] [You obtained ???.]

Level 3 upgrade, and you received the floor clear reward.

[The Belt of Dark Water] [Black Magic +50] [Magic +500] [Strength +400] [Intelligence +400] [Attack Power +300] [Defense +300] [A belt made from the skin of a mysterious demon living in the deepest part of darkness. The darkness contained within is so thick that an ordinary person would go mad if they touched it.]

This equipment had high black magic and magic stats, and its attack power was also respectable.

As for the secret reward, it was a potion that permanently increased magic by 500 without any conditions. This was a useful reward, especially since the total amount of magic became important from now on.

And finally, the last remaining reward.

Ba'al personally handed over two mid-grade black magic spells.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Middle-grade Dark Magic: Baal's Dark Space Invasion] [Mana Consumption: 2,000] [Magic Consumption: 800] [Proficiency: 1%] [Summons a dark space that exists in Baal's realm, which distorts the concept of objects and laws, and only has physical power.]

The mana and magic consumption of this dark magic were higher than others.

Baal was a great demon. Even though it was a middle-grade dark magic, its power was significantly different. Taesan decided to try it out immediately.

[You have activated Baal's Dark Space Invasion.]

Mana and magic burst out, and a dark space was summoned.

The distorted space, condensed into a dark vortex, rushed forward like a wave.

Zzzt!

A loud noise erupted, and everything began to distort. The advancing space collided with the walls of the labyrinth.

Kuuuung!

A massive sound wave spread out.

When the distorted space returned to its original state, a deep mark was left on the walls of the labyrinth.

"It's incomparable."

Taesan compared it to any dark magic he had obtained so far, and it was a whole different level of power.

Of course, it was still inferior to high-grade magic, but unlike the Great Destruction, which took time to gather its power, Baal's dark magic had a remarkably fast manifestation speed.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Although the consumption value is high, it was useful enough to use. The satisfied Taesan also checked other skills in a row.

[Middle-grade Dark Magic: Baal's Overlapping Darkness] [Mana Consumption: 1,700] [Magic Consumption: 700] [Proficiency: 1%] [Summons multiple layers of darkness from Baal's realm to cover the body, allowing it to hide even from the transcendent's gaze. The darkness is extremely exhausted.]

A darkness that covers the body. It was a skill that required an opponent to be present to confirm. Taesan summoned Minerva and Valkazar.

"What's going on?"

"Master, it's been a while?"

Minerva, who appeared in the labyrinth, looked at Taesan and let out a dry laugh.

"Master, you've really gone too far, haven't you?"

Now, there was a huge power gap between Minerva and Taesan. She let out a sigh.

"It's good that you're getting stronger, Master, but as a spirit, it's a bit sad that my value as a spirit is disappearing."

"You have your own things to do, don't you? As a spirit, your sensing ability is quite exceptional, isn't it?"

"That's right? I think my sensing ability is just below that of an immortal."

"And since we have a contract, I'll be able to sense you even better."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Where's the contractor?"

Minerva muttered as if it was obvious. Taesan nodded his head.

"Then it's perfect."

[You activated Baal's overlapping darkness.]

Multiple layers of darkness overlapped and covered Taesan's body.

And his presence disappeared. Minerva was taken aback.

"......Lord, are you there? I don't feel anything?"

Minerva was a spirit contracted to Taesan. She could mostly understand where Taesan was, what he was doing, and what powers he possessed.

But now, Taesan, shrouded in darkness, was beyond even her perception.

"This is it."

Taesan moved his arm. The overlapping darkness changed smoothly in response to his movement.

If he showed intense movement or was attacked, it would break, but maintaining the darkness while moving was no problem at all.

A power that even Minerva, who had a contract with him, couldn't grasp. It seemed like it could be used in conjunction with the Shadow Concealment skill.

"It's fine."

It was a satisfying skill.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan, who had finished the confirmation, began to descend into the labyrinth again.

[83rd Floor Quest Begins.] [Pass the Trial of Essence.] [Reward: A ring that falls into the endless abyss.] [Secret Reward: ???]

"From the 80th floor, it's all God's trials."

Taesan muttered to himself. 83rd floor. Essence.

He was the God of Descent.

As he passed through the corridor and opened the door, the altar of Essence came into view.

The altar of Essence had the same shape as the altar where human sacrifices were performed.

The power emanating from within was extremely deep.

It was an eerie, unsettling feeling, as if falling into an endless abyss.

Finally, he was the God of Descent. The god who had devoured the princess of Beltingkia and treated Amelia like a toy.

He was one of the few evil gods that Taesan had seen so far.

Taesan placed his hand on the altar. A powerful wave of energy enveloped him.

The space was distorted, and Taesan's body was transported. Minerva and Barcaja were somehow summoned back. Taesan instinctively knew that he had arrived in the realm of Essence.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And in the realm, there was a master who was waiting for him. Taesan turned his head.

It was enormous.

Its size was impossible to comprehend, and its entire body was writhing. It was an unnatural, mixed-up appearance, as if all life forms had been forcibly combined.

At this moment, Taesan was able to see the true form of the essence, which was shrouded in a veil.

This was the God of Fall. This was the true form of the essence.

The evil, childish gaze of the essence turned towards Taesan.

At the same time, Taesan felt himself falling.

The power and strength, the body and mind, were about to plummet into the abyss. The essence's power was capable of making its target fall just by gazing at it.

"It won't work."

But Taesan was able to shake off the essence's power just by lightly tensing his entire body.

The power that was falling regained its original state.

The essence's gaze, which was directed at Taesan, was filled with emotion. Taesan met its gaze.

The gazes of the two beings, who had transcended mortality, intersected.

A feeling of discomfort flowed from the essence, but it did not have a direct impact on Taesan. In the end, it was the essence that spoke first.

"[Let's make a deal, adventurer.]"
