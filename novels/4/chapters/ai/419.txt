**Episode 420**

**420. 83rd Floor, The Essence of the God of Falling (2)**

"It's not a particularly attractive sound."

The quest on the 83rd floor is to clear the trial of the God of Falling.

Essence could have imposed the trial on Taesan without making a deal.

However, the reason Essence suggested a deal was one thing.

It was to impose a strengthened trial that would require staking one's life, a trial that was almost impossible to clear.

Even if the god suggested a strengthened trial, the adventurer could refuse it.

But Essence couldn't force it like Lakiratas did. The demon god was still watching over Taesan.

So, it was a deal.

Essence said,

[The condition of the deal is that you don't refuse my trial.]

"What reason do I have to do that?"

A deal requires mutual agreement. If there's no sufficient reward, there's no reason to accept a deal that requires staking one's life.

[If you accept my deal, I won't interfere with other mortals.]

"……."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan's lips tightened at the sound of Essence's voice, which was like a gentle whisper.

Most transcenders didn't care about mortals who they deemed worthless and didn't bother to pay attention to them.

However, there were also gods who existed solely to torment and mock mortals for their own amusement.

And Essence was one of those gods, in Taesan's judgment.

Alone, Amelia was descending into the abyss, along with other players from different countries, including Gang Joon-hyuk.

Transcenders couldn't directly intervene in the affairs of adventurers, but if they wanted to, they could easily interfere.

Maria had forcibly invited Taesan to her domain with an unreasonable choice, and Lakiratas had imposed a strengthened trial. There was no reason why Essence couldn't do the same.

It was okay for Lee Tae-yeon, who had received Maria's blessing, but other players who didn't have the protection of the gods could be hindered by Essence at any moment.

"You're poking at the part that hurts."

What Essence had just said was something that Taesan had been worried about too.

Even if Taesan himself was fine, others would have a hard time dealing with the gods' malicious interference.

But...
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Do as you please."

Taesan rejected Essence's proposal.

[…….]

Essence's true self trembled. Taesan spoke calmly.

"Do you know which god favors me? It's Mashin. They're trying to make me their own. If I make a deal with them, they'll likely protect other adventurers from your hands."

In reality, Taesan didn't know if that would happen. Mashin was fundamentally a laissez-faire god.

But the important thing was that the possibility was sufficient.

"Don't you think it's a more rational judgment to make a deal with the one who's protecting me instead of trying to kill me to ensure the adventurers' safety?"

[You.]

Displeasure was evident in Essence's voice.

A much thicker and clearer killing intent was directed at Taesan than before.

But that was all.

It couldn't manifest its will or exert physical influence.

"As expected."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

When Taesan freed Amelia earlier, Essence revealed its displeasure and tried to trample Taesan. However, the Demon God appeared and chased Essence away.

There was a clear difference in power between the two.

That's why Essence wanted to obtain Taesan's consent in the form of a deal.

[……Speak.]

In the end, Essence suppressed its anger. With a tone mixed with annoyance, Taesan spoke calmly.

"What do you want to say?"

[ Mentioning the Demon God's name means you're asking for something more. Unpleasant. State your conditions.]

"I didn't think that far, but if you insist."

Taesan laughed.

From the beginning, he had no intention of refusing.

Even if it's strengthened, the fundamental trial of the labyrinth is difficult to clear. It's not impossible, but it's a quest that requires a suitable reward. Taesan had intended to accept the proposal from the start.

"But I'll take everything I can get."

"What I want is to not interfere with other adventurers and your authority. That's it."

* * *

After the Earth Return Quest ended, Maria granted Taesan the skill "Selection Exclusion".
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's a skill that surpasses even attack nullification, allowing you to select and erase one of your opponent's attacks. It was a portion of Maria's authority that was bestowed upon Taesan.

Its performance was extremely high. The skill's effectiveness was so great that it was one of the top skills Taesan had acquired in his current life.

Essence was also a transcender. His authority would likely have a similar effect to selective rejection.

What Taesan desired as a reward was precisely the authority of a transcender.

[...What's with you? You're going to give me your authority?]

Essence's voice trembled with anger.

His breathing became labored.

The emotion that surfaced was anger, and only anger.

But Taesan spoke calmly.

"If you don't like it, you can refuse."

It didn't matter whether Essence accepted or rejected it. It was a proposal made with that mindset.

Essence silently suppressed his anger.

After a while, his voice rang out.

[Alright.]

Essence had accepted Taesan's proposal.

Taesan was slightly surprised. Essence had accepted it more readily than expected.

[I accept your proposal.]

"Uh... if that's the case, I'm fine with it."

Ku-ku-ku!

The deal was struck.

In response, power began to surge within Essence's domain."

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Sub-quest starts.] [The God of Decline, Essence, wants to give you a strengthened trial at its altar.] [Condition: Clear Essence's model garden.] [Reward: Non-interference with other adventurers, Essence's authority, and rewards according to trial clearance.]

"Ah, I have one more thing to add."

Taesan opened his mouth, having read the system window.

"I want to include the princess's soul, which Belvendia had, in the reward."

[It doesn't matter. And I will seal one of your abilities.]

Essence's power began to envelop Taesan.

"What ability will you seal?"

A calm voice echoed.

[I will seal your immortal's aura. You will only have a mortal's aura when you enter my model garden.]

Essence laughed.

With a joyful expression, as if certain that Taesan would never come back alive.

[Many talented individuals, my toys that I've collected, none of whom have escaped my model garden. You must clear it.]

Ku-u-ung!

The power roughly grasped Taesan's body.

Taesan's body began to fall into Essence's realm, deeper and deeper.

And Taesan arrived in a desolate world.

The ground was dry and cracked, and a dry wind brushed past his cheek.

"Hmm."

Taesan let out a small sigh.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His level was plummeting. He had transcended mortality and possessed an extremely high level, but this was the realm of the Transcendents. The level of Taesan, an immortal, suddenly dropped to that of a mortal.

His plummeting level came to a halt at the boundary.

"This is it."

Taesan looked up.

The withered earth and sharp wind brushed past his cheek.

There was nothing around, only a desolate wasteland in sight.

* * *

[You're quite bold, aren't you? Proposing a deal to a Transcendent with a grudge.]

The ghost spoke in a tone of admiration. He couldn't say a word in front of Essence's anger. But Taesan didn't back down and took advantage of the situation.

"There's no reason for me to yield to someone who hates me."

Taesan said, checking his overall condition.

The sealed power was the level of an immortal. It was still there. The power he possessed remained unchanged.

While his ability to wield divine power was inferior to when he had the level of an immortal, it wasn't like he couldn't use it at all.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$"It's a bit much to seal the level of an immortal," he said calmly.

"I agreed to the deal, so it doesn't matter," he added.

Taesan spoke calmly. He was now too strong. It was easy to predict that the maze's difficulty would rise to Taesan's level or that his power would be sealed.

"What are we doing here then?"

[...] It was called his "garden of models," if I recall correctly.

A small garden filled with toys, so to speak.

It didn't take long to find out what toys were in this garden. As Taesan walked through the desolate plain, several figures approached from a distance.

$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$“Is this your first time hearing this?”

Tae-san nodded. A sense of confusion was etched on their faces.

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The man drew his sword. The others behind him also grasped their own weapons in their hands.

"I'm sorry to show you a harsh sight as soon as we meet, but this will be a good example."

The man gripped his sword tightly.

"It's not that bad for you, either. Don't worry. There's no death here, so don't be desperate."

With that, they surrounded Taesan, trapping him so he couldn't escape.

"Who's next?"

"I'll go. Captain."

"Have we reached halfway? There's still a long way to go."

Taesan, who had been watching them with a calm gaze, asked.

"Are you aiming for my life?"

"Unfortunately, yes."

"It doesn't seem like it from your expression."

Taesan didn't see any contempt or greed in their faces, nor did he sense any murderous intent. But they were trying to kill him.

"This is a place like that."

The man smiled wryly.

"I'm sorry I can't explain. You'll find out soon enough anyway."

The man's exhausted face twisted as he spoke.

"Our only hope is this one thing."

Note: Taesan is a proper noun, likely a person's name, and I've left it untranslated.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As soon as they finished talking, they rushed towards Taesan.

Windows, swords, and bows flew in from all directions at the same time.

It was an extremely fast and powerful attack, with a speed comparable to that of the guide's top leaders.

Taesan drew his sword.

Ka-ga-gak!

"Ugh!"

"Ack!"

A scream erupted. The man who was pushed back by Taesan's counterattack was staring at his own hand in horror.

In just one moment, his palm was torn apart and blood was flowing.

"I don't know."

They had tried to kill Taesan, but there was no malice in it.

It was as if it was only natural.

"Despairingly, I said there was no death. I wish you would answer my question."
