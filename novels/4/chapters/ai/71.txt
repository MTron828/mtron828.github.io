72. 12th Floor, God of Choice. Maria (4)

[Amidst confusion judgment......] [Madness judgment......] [Fear judgment......] [Instant death judgment......] [Lost soul judgment......] [Faint judgment......] [Complete judgment success!] [Amidst confusion judgment......] [Madness judgment......] [Fear judgment......]

The judgments succeed and are repeated. Even after a successful judgment, it is attempted again.

The judgments do not stop.

[Heuk, heuk.]

The ghost was in worse shape than Taesan. Somehow managing to endure, its white body flickered like static on a television screen, seemingly on the verge of dissipating.

Taesan glanced up at the woman who was playfully smiling. Her smile deepened.

Taesan frowned.

"Is this how you treat your invited guests?"

Instantly, the pressure of power diminished.

The clamorous judgments also vanished.

[Heuk.]

The ghost barely managed to breathe. The woman chuckled.

The ghost bowed its head.
[I, I offer my thanks. You are divine.] [Do not thank me. Those are his words. It's been a long time.] [It has been a long time......]

The woman and the ghost seemed to recognize each other. The woman chuckled softly.

[Yes. It's been since our last unpleasant encounter.]

It was a playful remark, but the ghost didn't dare to speak out of turn.

After a moment of looking at the ghost, the woman turned her gaze to Taesan.

[Oh, you must know who I am.]

"The God of Choice, Maria."

There was no mistaking it.

The mental judgment that had caught earlier was thicker and endless, more than any Apostle he had ever seen.

[I am the Goddess of Choice. Repeating vile choices to reach here, a god who forces choices upon mortals.]

The title attached to the god announces what she is in charge of.

[Welcome to my temple. Precious child.]

* * *

The goddess looked down at Taesan with a smile.

Filled with kindness, Taesan was bewildered and amazed.

‘This is……’

He had never thought deeply about gods.

He knew they were powerful, but not necessarily this much powerful individually.
He thought they were only two or three times stronger than an apostle at most.

But the god he directly confronted was on a different level.

"There are dozens, hundreds of beings like this?"

As Taesan inwardly chuckled, the ghost spoke cautiously.

[Great one. May I dare ask a question?] [Go ahead. You're already a dead child.] [Wasn't it because we were not invited to the god's temple? Not acceptable as mortals......] [No. Child. You can't endure our existence, but that can be solved. It's a different problem.]

Maria smiled.

[You weren't called because you are not worthy of wealth.] [...….]

The ghost shut his mouth. This time, Taesan spoke.

"Do I have value?"

[Sleep.]

The ghost swallowed his breath with a bold question. In his view, Taesan's behavior was very disrespectful.

But Taesan did not think that.

The goddess in front of him was unlikely to think this behavior was disrespectful.

As expected, the goddess smiled.
[You exist. You are quite intriguing to us. I wanted to see you in person.]

The god showed direct interest.

The ghost couldn't help but be amazed at this fact.

In all the centuries he had lived in the labyrinth, he had never heard of such a thing.

[Rakiratas was making such a fuss, so I was considering being picky and giving it a try... But you had enough value.]

Maria. Not many accepted the trial that forced her choice.

And there were hardly any who overcame it.

Moreover, there was not a single person who had endured the trial she had personally reinforced.

Taesan passed the trial.

Moreover, he achieved results that satisfied her.

Maria looked down at Taesan with eyes that saw a precious treasure.

[I was disappointed to settle in this place, but now I think it was a fairly good choice.]

"I have one question. If I had deceived in the choice of the
[If the guy next to you did that in the past.] [Ha, hahaha......]

The ghost chuckled wryly.

It was the right answer not to deceive. If he had done so, there was a possibility that the goddess would not have shown him such favor.

The goddess brought up the main point in calling Taesan.

[My child, do you really have no intention of becoming my disciple?]

She liked Taesan.

She is the goddess of choice. She does not like coercion. Maria's trial gives freedom of choice to those who undergo it.

But that was the problem. Adventurers who underwent her trials spoke falsehoods.

That too was a choice, but she did not like it.

She favored straightforward choices and the strength and wit to overcome them.

It was a matter of taste. That's why, since the design of the labyrinth, she had not created a single disciple. None had pleased her.

But Taesan was different.

He made a truthful choice, and in a situation close to impossible, he drew out logic and wisdom to achieve a perfect victory.

She liked Taesan very much.
If you accept, you will become my first apostle. Your desires will be fulfilled, and you will descend into the labyrinth as my representative. No one will dare to speak lightly to you, even if they are apostles of other gods.

Maria had that much power. And she had the intention towards Taesan.

"What do you say?"

"I'm sorry."

Taesan calmly declined.

Maria's offer was certainly appealing. With that much power, he could descend through the labyrinth faster.

But that wasn't the path he sought.

Maria withdrew gracefully with a smile.

"That's not bad either. I respect your choice."

Contrary to expectations, she didn't seem upset. Perhaps he could ask another question.

"May I ask you a question?"

"Ask away, child."

"How much do you know about me?"

Maria chuckled at the piercing question.

"I know more than you think. This isn't your first time here. And I know about what the serpent vomited."

She knew. She knew that Taesan had come back in time.

"Poor child. Led astray by choices. Caught up in their tricks."


It wasn't exactly surprising. From the outset, the pedestal of Ouroboros obtained by Yitae-yeon was acquired here, in the labyrinth.

The gods would not place an item even they couldn't control.

Moreover, if Taesan could interfere even slightly with time, it didn't seem likely that a being with such power would be bound by something as trivial as time.

But there was a catch.

"...Caught up in their tricks?"

"It's not just tricks. I gave you a flawed choice. I prevented you from reaching where you should rightfully come. Hasn't that tormented you?"

Taesan's eyes narrowed.

"Tricks, meaning, Normal, Hard mode. The goddess knew what choices were given to them."

"Do you know who I am?"

With a calm but emotionally charged voice, the goddess chuckled.

"The answer to that...would be if you were to accept my proposal."

"You mean you can't tell me?"

"We do have stories about our errors that are infeasible
[You're impressive now, but still feeble. Descend further. There's something you must receive.]

"To ordinary me, this is too much attention."

[Your inability to speak of it is because you don't know this place. Adventurers like you have no idea what they're doing here. We stayed here because of childhood games, but not peaceful or mundane ones. It's a game of life and death.]

A hint of irritation flashed in the goddess's eyes. That alone thickened the air significantly.

"I'd like to crush it all, but... it wouldn't be fun. I'm not so childish as to throw a tantrum."

The goddess smiled knowingly.

"You'll find out soon enough. Yes, that should be amusing too. Your struggle with them."

At that moment, a voice echoed from outside the temple.

"Ah, they're here. The troublesome ones have arrived." [Sigh.]

The ghost swallowed a breath. A tremendous presence rushed in. It was hardly inferior even compared to Maria.

"Until next time, child."

With a farewell, Taesan's form began to depart from the temple.

*Crunch.*
The walls of the temple cracked open. A massive iris appeared through the gap, filled with deep irritation.

"You." [Are you angry? You should have moved first. I wanted a piece of the action too, you know?]

With a cackling laugh as a final remark, Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

*Sigh...*

The ghost still seemed visibly shocked, mouth agape. Taesan appeared equally shaken.

But their shocks were different.

"This is serious."

Taesan believed he had no enemies if he only focused on his stats.

It wasn't arrogance or recklessness. He had cleared the alone mode, but that could be seen as the same as the previous one.

  When lifted cosa E Scared got many
There were several crises, but they weren't particularly impressive to him now because they were crises he faced due to being weaker than his former self.

He focused solely on maximizing his stats and returning to Earth.

However, the gods were overwhelmingly powerful.

Not just Maria, even the gods who appeared last were at a level beyond comparison. Even if his former self had done everything, he would never have been able to overcome them.

Even if his stats were at Itaeyeon's level, it wouldn't be much different.

That was shocking to Taesan.

"What about here then?"

Taesan's eyes flickered.

They said the other modes were fake. Taesan had possessed stronger power than anyone else in such a fake mode.

If he could obtain everything in a place that could be called real, could he even confront the gods? Or would it still be impossible?

"I want to try."

Taesan muttered.

He had a deeply personal goal now.
