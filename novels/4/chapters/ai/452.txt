Chapter 453

453. The Seventh Return, Earth (5)

My proficiency is gradually building up.

The high plateau that seemed out of reach is now within sight.

When my divine power proficiency reaches 100%, what level will I reach?

It's not easy to grasp.

Taesan calmed the turbulent divine power within him and examined the numerous pillars that had emerged on the mainland.

This quest was one that even he didn't know about.

In their past lives, the only place they had to defend was Las Vegas. But with Taesan's intervention, things had changed.

The quest description stated that the more pillars that were destroyed, the more penalties they would receive in the next quest. The gods would do their best to destroy the pillars.

They could be summoned from outside the United States or from anywhere within the country.

"Let's prepare for it."

Although he had set up a barrier, it was insufficient. Taesan used his skills to set up a defensive magic circle on each of the pillars that Beldegkia couldn't install a spatial movement magic circle on.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"At that moment, the leaders of each country began to deploy their people.

There were many places that needed to be defended.

They were struggling to decide how to allocate their personnel.

Fortunately, Diana and Belvandia were present.

The two of them were extremely strong. They were capable of blocking a pillar each without any issues. The leaders deployed their people, centering around Diana, Belvandia, and the strong players of Elron Mode.

First, they deployed many people on the outer perimeter, and assigned a suitable number of defenders to the pillars inside. And if monsters appeared from within, they would use spatial teleportation magic to respond immediately. That was the conclusion they reached.

The other people were practicing their combat skills, preparing for the upcoming battle.

Among them were also players of Elron Mode.

"Whoa!"

Amelia swung her sword wildly, creating dozens of afterimages around her.

She charged towards Diana with the afterimages.

Diana gently extended her hand.

Amelia's sword was caught by Diana's fingers.

"Kkkk!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Diana lightly waved her hand, and Amelia, who had been sent flying, barely managed to land on the ground.

Diana spoke with a calm face.

"I'll use an afterimage to hide my real attack. It's not bad, but against someone stronger than you who doesn't have skills, it won't work."

"......I guess that's true."

"You have talent. That's why the God of Decline chose you."

Amelia had been chosen by the God of Decline. It meant that she had talent worthy of the god's attention.

"But you're relying on your talent to win without experience and judgment. It may work against those who are less talented than you, but against someone with similar talent who is stronger than you, it won't work. You should fix that part."

"I've thought about it too, but it's not easy."

"Don't worry. I'll make sure you understand this time."

Diana smiled faintly and drew her sword. Amelia, with a nervous expression, drew her sword to face her.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It wasn't just her. Victor, Hasan, and Kang Joon-hyuk were also there. The strong ones who stood out in the Alone Mode were all preparing for the next quest by sparring with Diana or Beldegia.

As they were all exceptionally talented individuals among humans, they possessed outstanding skills.

However, the Alone Mode was a solitary labyrinth.

It was difficult to find someone to spar with and train themselves.

Although the guides of each level's sin could theoretically spar with each other, they were wary of each other and tried to prevent each other from getting stronger, so actual sparring was rare.

In the end, the time on Earth was their only opportunity to spar with each other.

They continued to gain experience by making their abilities equal, sometimes fighting with all their might, or even fighting one against many.

And Taesan was watching their forms.

"What do you think?"

"Ah, Taesan-nim."

Diana smiled softly and said, "You're already complete on your own, so you don't need my help much. Amelia-nim is impressive. She can adapt quickly even when pushed to her limits."

Amelia was exceptional.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In some ways, she could be considered superior to Lee Tae-yeon. She also had the potential to develop her own abilities by deeply understanding and utilizing her strengths, just like Lee Tae-yeon or Taesan."

"Besides, other people also have great talents. Thanks to Taesan, they also possess unique powers."

During the process of clearing the Earth's quest, various divine blessings were bestowed upon the players.

Those blessings greatly amplified the power and abilities of the people.

"If it's to that extent... if we challenge ourselves hundreds of times, we might be able to clear the labyrinth, don't you think? I can't guarantee it, though."

Those who recognized Taesan's existence greeted him lightly. Amelia approached Taesan with a solemn face.

"Taesan, can I ask you for a favor?"

"What is it? Go ahead and say it."

"Can you spar with me? With all your might."

Taesan looked at her. Amelia faced him with an unwavering expression.

If he went all out, Amelia would be unable to do anything. She would also know that.

Taesan nodded.

"Okay."

[Taesan has challenged Amelia Eirin to a duel.]

Taesan drew his sword.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Amelia took a deep breath and charged at Taesan.

Taesan lightly swung his sword. Amelia tried to block it with her sword.

Clang.

But she couldn't block it.

Taesan's sword broke through Amelia's defense and struck her, sending her crashing to the ground with a loud thud.

[Duel ended.]

"......I expected it, but I couldn't even block one hit."

"You knew that too. Why did you ask for a duel?"

"Just because."

Amelia stood up, brushing off the dirt.

"I wanted to clear my mind. It's done. I feel relieved now."

Her face was brighter than before, as if she wasn't just saying it.

After that, Amelia changed. She actively engaged in conversations with people and participated in discussions, even approaching Diana first to talk to her.

Taesan could see the change in her emotions.

She had been worried about her role until now.

She had been overshadowed by Taesan and Lee Tae-yeon, but she too could be a main character. She could stand in front of people and lead them.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In her past life, she had taken on the role of Kang Tae-san, who is now standing before her.

But it was no longer the case. There were four people stronger than her: Kang Tae-san, Lee Tae-yeon, Diana, and Beldencia.

This had brought confusion to Amelia, who had always been the main character until now.

But just now, she had made up her mind to support Kang Tae-san and Lee Tae-yeon in their duel. She would become a supporting character.

Amelia was clearly growing stronger in every way, both physically and mentally, compared to her past life.

Time passed, and the day of the quest's start was just one day away. People moved to their assigned regions to prepare for tomorrow.

Kang Tae-san was not assigned to any region.

He was free to move around and planned to fight against the monsters that would appear.

Kang Tae-san was killing time in Las Vegas.

"What's up?"

Lee Tae-yeon suddenly flew in and landed beside Kang Tae-san.

"Nothing. But why did you come? Shouldn't you be waiting in your assigned region?"

"I was just bored. It doesn't matter anyway, since we can move around before the quest starts.""
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She sat down on the floor, gazing blankly at the crack in the sky. She said,

"I've always wanted this."

"What are you talking about all of a sudden?"

"It's the atmosphere where people come together, believe they can survive, and move forward."

Taesan could understand what she was saying.

In the past life, many people died.

It wasn't just because of the monsters.

People excluded each other, trying to gain an advantage, and killed others to benefit themselves.

When all the players in the world gathered in the past life, people constantly clashed to become the representative, and many died in the process.

But now, under the overwhelming power of Taesan, everyone had come together in harmony.

There was no despair in the eyes of those waiting for battle.

Everyone believed that if they worked together, they could survive, and they held onto hope.

"We can... do it."

"Yes, we can do it."

Taesan replied.

The next day arrived. The quest began.

* * *

[Oh oh oh oh!]

A scream echoed from beyond the outskirts. People cried out in terror.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What's with so many of them?!"

It was literally endless.

The forest was being destroyed, the sea was being torn apart, and monsters were rushing about.

[Monster 213 has appeared.] [Monster 144 has appeared.] [Monster 146 has appeared.]

...

...

...

Countless B and C-grade monsters.

And there were over hundreds of A-grade monsters as well.

Among them, there were even monsters they had defeated before.

"As expected, they're reviving."

Lee Tae-yeon wasn't surprised by this fact. Monsters with numbers attached to them were essentially mass-produced by Gosin, so it was only natural that they would keep appearing no matter how many were defeated.

[Oh! Oh! Oh!]

And among them, there were monsters with extraordinary powers.

[Monster 4 has appeared.] [Monster 12 has appeared.] [Monster 5 has appeared.]

S-grade monsters.

They were scattered all over, rushing towards the United States.

It was a scene that seemed to herald the end of the world, and Oliver shouted with a stiff face.

"Then I'll take care of it!"

"Haha."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lee Tae-yeon threw her body forward. She charged straight at the S-grade monster that was rushing towards her.

The S-grade monster gathered its irregular bodies and fired a purple beam of light.

The target of the beam was a pillar.

The people inside screamed as they were engulfed by the destructive light.

Lee Tae-yeon didn't back down. Her sword clashed with the beam of light. The light scattered in all directions, and the shockwave alone was enough to annihilate hundreds of monsters.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

Lee Tae-yeon swung her sword wildly, deflecting the beam of light.

"Oooooh!"

A loud cheer erupted. She smiled as she gazed at the monster.

"You. You're the one?"

[Monster 9 appeared.]

It was the S-grade monster that had driven Lee Tae-yeon to the brink of death in her past life.

"Good. Let's do this properly."

Lee Tae-yeon charged at the monster. The monster responded with a purple beam of light.

Belvandekia was also doing his best in his assigned role. He waved his hand, and dozens of magic circles appeared in the air at once.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

And within them, magic was realized.

In an instant, thousands of monsters were erased. The people gazed at Belvandekia with awe-struck eyes, marveling at the extreme power of his magic.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Amelia was not yet capable of facing an S-grade monster, but she was holding her ground against hundreds of A-grade monsters without retreating.

Minerva was also summoned, wielding wind and flames to take down numerous monsters.

The people were shouting and rushing to block the approaching monsters.

And Diana was blocking an S-grade monster.

"This one monster alone could easily destroy a weak world. It's terrifying."

Kyiiiing!

Diana muttered to herself, dodging the pouring light and blocking the slashing blades. She swung her sword smoothly, cutting off the upper body of an S-grade monster that was charging towards her.

Krrr...

The monster's upper body flew off, and it quickly regenerated. Diana clicked her tongue and applied rapid pressure.

[Woooh!]

From a distance, three more S-grade monsters were approaching. Diana intended to quickly take care of one of them before they arrived. She was about to apply rapid pressure when...

Quack.

The monster's head was crushed.

Diana's pupils enlarged.

It was Gang Tae-san who had crushed the monster's head.

"Tae-san?"

Tae-san had thrust his sword into the monster's body.

[Dealt 56,334 damage to Monster 5.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan used magic and dark magic in succession.

Other monsters tried to intervene, but Taesan dispelled them all with his divine power. In an instant, an S-grade monster was unable to resist and disappeared.

"It's done. Leave the rest to me."

Diana, who had been robbed of her enemy, opened her mouth in surprise.

"......You're not going to participate in the battle?"

Taesan had been watching the battle, deciding to move only when a strong or dangerous monster appeared.

"I originally intended to do so, but this one is special."

Monster 5.

It was the opponent Taesan had risked his life to fight in his past life. Now, it was nothing to him, but he still wanted to deal with it personally.

"And I had some time. It's coming down now."

"Ah."

In that moment, Diana's face trembled.

Her instincts warned her of danger. Something was amiss. If she stayed here, she might lose her life.

Suddenly.

A massive darkness fell from the hole in the sky.

It was a sticky, gloopy substance.

A formless entity descended upon the earth.

Taesan calmly drew his sword.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$It seems like you have a mix of Korean text and English keywords. Here's a breakdown of the translation and explanation:

**Korean text:**
“처음부터 사도인가.” translates to "Have you been a saint from the beginning?" or "Were you a saint from the start?" The phrase "사도" (sado) means "saint" or "disciple," and the sentence is likely a rhetorical question or a humorous remark.

**English keywords:**
The list of English keywords appears to be unrelated to the Korean text. It seems like a collection of words and phrases, possibly from a marketing or product context:

* Bridal Sets: likely referring to wedding ring sets
* Cctv: abbreviation for Closed-Circuit Television, a type of surveillance system
* Combinations: unclear context, but could refer to product bundles or pairing options
* Combine: unclear context, but could refer to combining products or services
* Company Profiles: likely referring to business profiles or company information
* Confirm: unclear context, but could refer to confirming orders or transactions
* Consider: unclear context, but could refer to considering options or products
* Adblock: a type of software that blocks online advertisements
* Ascension: unclear context, but could refer to a brand or product name
* Bridal ring sets: similar to "Bridal Sets" above, likely referring to wedding ring sets

**Korean sentence with special characters:**
[$!@xx!이 등장했다.] is a sentence with special characters and is difficult to translate accurately. However, if we ignore the special characters, the sentence "xx이 등장했다" can be translated to "xx has appeared" or "xx has emerged." The special characters [$!@] may be used for emphasis or to convey a playful tone.
