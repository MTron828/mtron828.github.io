**Episode 484**

484. 91st Floor. Oroboros (5)

"This is amazing."

The world's time was reversing.

It was a kind of enormous law. If Taesan hadn't been at the boundary, he wouldn't have been able to resist and would have been dragged back.

Taesan looked at the immortal.

His body was reversing time.

His expression was infinitely distorted, as if he was trying to resist to some extent, but that was all. He couldn't do anything about his reversing self and was just suffering.

And finally...

The reversing time had ended.

"Phew."

The immortal let out a held breath. Taesan turned his gaze back outside.

The plaza was extremely clean, as if it had been cleaned just the day before.

But the people weren't. As soon as the flow of time returned to normal, their faces distorted again. Madness erupted, and crazy behaviors were seen.

"Infinite reversing time."

"We are trapped here."

The immortal said, his face more exhausted than before.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You may not have been here for long and are not yet bound, but the longer you stay, the more you will be caught. I hope you can escape from this twisted world."

Taesan didn't think he could escape easily. He asked the Immortal.

"How long has this world been like this?"

"……."

The Immortal didn't answer.

He closed his eyes and let out a quiet sigh. Everything seemed empty.

Taesan, who had been staring at him for a moment, approached him.

The Immortal, who was mentally broken, was physically perfect, without any damage. Taesan, who stood before him, opened his mouth.

"I can grant your wish."

"……."

The Immortal's eyes slightly opened.

Taesan drew his sword.

"I can kill you."

The air trembled.

Ash-colored reality was realized in the world. The Immortal's pupils grew larger.

"……Ah?"

"Did I say that earlier? My mind must have been gone to not notice."

The Immortal stared at the boundary line as if mesmerized.

"Is it the power of the ancient god? No, it's not that. It's not the power of this world either. It's……."

"It's hard to explain specifically. You must be feeling it too. What can we do with this?"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The effect of the boundary line is the distortion of the law and interference.

By removing the immortal who had become one with Ouroboros, they could cut off its life.

A sense of desperation suddenly appeared on the immortal's face. It stumbled and got up from its throne, grasping the hem of Taesan's robe.

"Please, I beg of you, great one. Please, please kill me..."

It bowed its head to the ground.

"Have mercy on me, I beg of you..."

The great immortal, the ruler of this world. It must have received the worship of countless people. It must have overcome countless obstacles and hardships to reach its position.

Yet, it was begging for Taesan's mercy like a child.

"If you truly wish for it, I will grant it. But there's a condition."

"W-what is it...?"

"The information of this world."

Taesan said.

"Everything you know about this place."

"Then... does that mean you'll kill me?"

"Yes."

The immortal's face was filled with hope.

* * *

"Where should I start from?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"From the beginning. How did you guys end up like this?"

"From the beginning, if you will..."

The immortal stuttered and continued speaking. It was a slow and rusty process, as if they hadn't thought in a long time, but somehow, they managed to convey their thoughts.

"...One day, a snake suddenly swallowed us whole. We don't know why. We just came to our senses and found ourselves inside the belly of Ouroboros."

"When did this happen?"

"I don't know. I can't count how much time has passed. I only know that a very, very long time has gone by."

Even the immortal was pushed to the limits of their mental endurance, forgetting the flow of time.

The immortal, who was still trying to gather their thoughts, spoke as if they had just remembered something.

"Come to think of it... I heard a story just before we got eaten by the snake. The war of the universe had ended, they said."

"...The war is over?"

"Yes. I don't know what kind of war it was, but that's what was circulating among the immortals. Our star is located on the outskirts, so I don't know the details."

The war of the universe.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

One memory flashed through the mind of Taesan.

"The War of Gods and Transcenders."

A long, fierce war was fought between two opposing existences for dominance over the universe. The Transcender emerged victorious, and the defeated God was sealed away to the farthest reaches of the world.

However, that was an extremely long time ago.

It was an event from an era that even most Transcenders couldn't remember, except for a select few.

They had been alive since then, up until now.

Even the Transcenders found it difficult to comprehend the passage of time, so it was understandable that mortals couldn't endure it. It was also understandable that their minds would be severely damaged to the point of being unable to recover their divinity.

"Continue talking."

"We didn't notice at first. Some strong individuals felt that something had changed, but they didn't know what. Only those who had achieved immortality realized that the snake of cycles was devouring us. But... we didn't know anything beyond that."

The snake of cycles moves at the end of the cycle. Except for that one fact, we knew nothing about the Ouroboros.

"Since nothing had changed significantly, we lived our daily lives as usual for the time being."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They sell things, dress up elegantly, and dance.

They were just like usual.

"But... after being eaten by a snake and a day passed, the world returned to its original state."

The immortal's voice was trembling as if recalling a nightmare they didn't want to remember.

"Since then, we've been repeating the same eternal day."

"Are they all going crazy?"

"The revolving time didn't return our sanity. At first, there were people who enjoyed it. But around the 100-year mark, those who kept their sanity disappeared. And after 500 years, reason itself vanished."

Crash!

A sound of something breaking came from outside. The immortal wiped their face.

"They themselves don't know what they're doing. They're just repeating like a broken machine."

The immortal's words gave Taesan confidence in their thoughts.

What was affecting them was the same as the effect of the crystal.

The crystal was influencing not just a specific target, but the entire world."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Originally, it was used to circulate the world, but something went wrong and it was being used in a twisted way like this."

"Didn't there used to be strong ones like you?"

The immortal nodded slightly.

"It wasn't just us who were eaten. As much as a part of the universe entered the belly, there were immortals who existed accordingly. Among them was a planetary god as well."

"I don't feel anything in particular."

"This place is just the outskirts."

The immortal smiled wryly.

"I didn't give up on finding a solution either. At first, I wasn't completely consumed, so I could resist the forced circulation to some extent. Along with other immortals and planetary gods, I searched for the cycle's snake to find a solution."

"You're saying you're searching for the cycle's snake inside the snake?"

"I thought so too. But a transcendent being told me that what consumed us was just the snake's power. The true body of the snake is deep inside."

"......Is there a transcendent being who knows that?"

Even the wizards didn't know about the inside of Uroboros. But a transcendent being trapped here knew about it.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I don't remember the name, but... that person wasn't an ordinary person. They were extremely powerful. We listened to their words and moved together."

The result was obvious without needing to ask. The immortal opened their mouth with a stern face.

"As we went deeper, it became increasingly distorted. That place is... the abyss. I gave up halfway and returned, but those who didn't give up couldn't come back."

"That's right."

"That's all I know."

The immortal looked up at Taesan.

Their eyes were filled with an extremely desperate emotion.

"Now... can you kill me?"

"Just one more thing. You said you saw a woman. What did you mean by that?"

"Ah..."

The immortal's words trailed off. They squeezed out their memories with difficulty and said,

"I don't remember correctly, but... a woman came to see me once. I was very scared and couldn't calm down, but... I don't remember exactly."

"Was she a woman with black hair and black eyes?"

"Maybe... that's what it was like."

It was Lee Taeyeon. Taesan's eyes sank.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a time before time went back. But the immortal remembered Lee Tae-yeon. It meant that the time in this place flowed differently from the outside world.

"Good."

Taesan nodded his head. The immortal's face brightened for the first time.

"I'll grant your wish now."

"Ah, thank goodness......"

Taesan drew his sword. The ash-colored mist rose and covered the sword.

"Thank you......"

Taesan held out his sword.

"Do you have any last words?"

"I... I am their king."

The immortal looked out the window.

There, countless mortals were stuck in the reversing time.

"I am the ruler of the world. I have the responsibility to lead them. But I'm tired. I want to rest."

"That's right."

Puuk.

The sword pierced the immortal's chest.

The immortal's face was filled with relief, as if he could finally rest.

The boundary line excluded the power of the ouroboros that had been entwined with him, leading him to death. The power contained within him was passed on to Akasha and Bardley.

[This is... it feels strange.]"

Note: Ouroboros is a mythological symbol of a snake eating its own tail, often representing cycles and eternity. In this context, it seems to be a powerful entity or force that is connected to the immortal.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Bardeley muttered in an ambiguous tone. He had not reached the state of immortality in his lifetime. To him, immortality was a great and lofty realm.

Those who reached that realm chose to die themselves. Taesan organized the information he had obtained by sharpening his sword.

'Uroboros's body.'

Uroboros, who had devoured the universe, was simply power. Uroboros's true self was deep within this place.

'The deeper you go, the thicker it becomes.'

It's not just a matter of time turning back, but something entirely different. Even the immortals couldn't withstand it and returned.

'And the Transcendent.'

That too was an extremely high-level existence. Perhaps a Transcendent who governed the concept itself.

He was here.

A very long time had passed, so he might have died, but it was more likely that a being of his caliber would have endured.

For now, the goal was set to two things. Taesan gathered his mana. The condensed mana was mixed with divine and black colors.

[You have activated Teleport [Chaos].]

Taesan's body leaped to an even deeper part of Uroboros."
