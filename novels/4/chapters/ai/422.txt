**Chapter 423**

**423. 83rd Floor, the Essence of Falling God (5)**

"Bel... Deng... Ki... a?"

Diana repeated the name.

It was a voice that was extremely awkward, as if she couldn't even imagine saying the name out loud.

"Is he...?"

"He made a contract with a wizard to save you. He's stationed on the 61st floor, testing adventurers who come to find him."

Taesan opened his inventory.

"He gave me a quest. He asked me to rescue his princess, and in return, he would give me everything he has. I accepted the quest."

An music box appeared from the inventory.

A wizard's music box, made for the princess held captive by Bel Deng Ki a.

The music box started playing, and a song began to resonate.

A very powerful, morning-like song.

Diana's pupils grew larger.

"That's...".

"That's an item Bel Deng Ki a gave me along with the quest. He said it could heal your soul."

"...Just as you said. I never thought I'd come this far and hear my country's song again."

Diana smiled.

"My world was destroyed. Only I and Verdentia know that song. There's no lie in your words. Haha... it's unbelievable. You told me to forget and live my life. To live my own life. But in the end, you made a contract with a wizard..."

She spoke as if scolding, but her expression was filled with undeniable joy.

After taking a moment to process her emotions, Diana opened her mouth.

"May I ask, if it's okay with you, to hear a story about Verdentia?"

"Please do."

Taesan told her about the Verdentia he knew. About the trials he faced, what he did, and why he gave Taesan a quest.

Diana listened to the story with a very pleased face.

"He hasn't changed at all. I'm relieved."

She smiled softly.

"Thank you, Taesan-nim. I never thought I'd hear about him again, something I thought I'd never see or hear again."

Note: Verdentia is likely a proper noun, possibly the name of a country or kingdom, and 벨뎅키아 (Beldeongkia) is the Korean pronunciation of it.

"Diana's tone had changed. Taesan shook his head.

"You can speak comfortably."

"No, you are the brave warrior who came to save me. I should show you the proper respect. Thank you sincerely."

She got out of bed and took a dignified posture, perfect as a princess.

Their relationship had been settled once. Diana asked with a calm face.

"So... you're not affiliated with the God of Decline, are you?"

"I came here on my own. I made a deal, though."

"...I'm sorry to say this, but are you really okay? There are many strong people here. Some of them are even stronger than me. But no one has been able to clear the Colosseum."

"It doesn't matter."

Taesan said calmly, without any concern.

Diana, who was momentarily taken aback, spoke cautiously.

"I understand that you're a considerable strong person, hiding your power. If possible, could you show me your power?"

It turned out that he was still in a state of authority seal activation. Taesan released his skill."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

“Haha.”

At the same time, Diana's expression turned stern.

Her face turned pale, and she reflexively grasped the sword placed beside her bed. With great effort, she took a deep breath.

"You're amazing."

Her expression revealed an uncontrollable sense of wonder.

"That's an unimaginably high level. If it's you... it might be possible."

The way to clear this place is to defeat the four heavenly kings in the Colosseum.

The power Taesan showed just now was stronger than the four heavenly kings. If they fought head-on, they could win.

"No."

But Taesan denied her words.

"It's probably difficult. It was designed that way from the start."

"......Is that what you said a little while ago?"

"You know it too. From the start, this was designed to be unbeatable. The intense battle that continued was just to give false hope. It's not like I'm any different."

I don't know the exact principle.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There's one thing I can know. The apostle will never lose. That's the rule that's been applied.

Of course, if it were the perfect Taesan, I could have crushed him with my strength, but right now, he's in a state where his immortal strength is sealed.

It's likely that the God of Fall deliberately lowered his strength to a mortal level for this very reason.

"Indeed, that's the case."

Diana nodded. She had suspected as much. Everyone else, excluding her, had given up hope.

The reason was simple. They had already tried hundreds, thousands of times and realized it was impossible.

She was also trying to deny it, but deep down, she knew it was true.

"There's no other way out, is there?"

"Probably not. Everyone here has tried, after all."

In the end, to clear the challenge, they had to pass through the Colosseum.

But winning in the Colosseum was impossible.

Why did the God of Fall believe he couldn't come back? The reason was this. The only way out was blocked from the start."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Let's gather information first, Princess. Can you tell me about the battle with the apostle?"

Diana opened her mouth with a calm face.

* * *

"I've held forty-seven Colosseum battles so far. At first, I lost miserably, but as the number of challenges increased, I got more used to it. From the thirtieth Colosseum, I was able to fight almost evenly. But from that moment on, the apostle kept revealing new powers."

Whether it was a special skill, a unique movement, or an entirely different technique.

Every time I thought I had grasped the opponent's abilities, something unexpected would emerge.

"Those who watched from the audience seats thought that the opponent had hidden powers and that they could win next time... but I, who fought directly, thought differently."

Diana bit her lip.

"The newly emerging powers of the opponent were too fitting for the situation."

"Fitting?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"My stamina was abundant, but when my skills were exhausted, I brought out an unstoppable technique. In the opposite situation, my stamina suddenly recovered. It wasn't a dramatic change, but it was an important shift that could change the flow of the entire battle. This pattern repeated itself in over ten battles.

Something felt off.

It wasn't just a matter of revealing hidden strength; the situation was too coincidental.

"It was a part that only those who directly experienced the battle could understand. But as I listened to Taesan's story, I realized that it was designed that way from the beginning."

Diana spoke with a bitter tone. Taesan stroked his chin.

As I listened to Diana's story, something came to mind.

However, since I had only experienced the battle once, I couldn't be certain. After a moment of contemplation, Taesan made a decision.

"Can anyone open the Colosseum if they collect 100 points?"

"Yes. However, there are few strong individuals who can collect 100 points, so they form cooperative relationships with each other."

"I see."

"I'll have to try it myself."

Taesan left the room.

* * *

Taesan, who had left the village, ran across the plain.

Before long, he saw a group of five people gathered together.

They appeared to be the ones Diana mentioned, collecting points and forming cooperative relationships with each other."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan drew his sword. By the time they approached him, they had already noticed Taesan, but it was too late.

Quadruple slash!

"Ugh!"

A scream and a loud crash erupted. It was just one strike. Five people fell in an instant.

Taesan stood still, his foot planted firmly on the ground.

Not long after, he discovered another group. This time, there were four of them.

Taesan attacked them head-on, just like before.

The enemy couldn't respond to his simple yet effective attack. The four of them couldn't even block a single strike and fell.

[It's an obvious result, but he's really a monster.]

The ghost nodded in agreement.

The ones who had fallen to Taesan were not weak. The fact that they were chosen by the God of Fall meant they had the talent to reach at least the 83rd floor.

And yet, they were falling to a single strike. Taesan jumped up and said,

"The basic stat difference is too great."

Right now, Taesan's stats were far superior to theirs. He had better equipment, and there was a fundamental difference in their combat power.

Although the Immortal's combat power had decreased, it was still on a different level from mortals once it had been achieved.

Note: "Quadruple slash" is a literal translation of "콰드드득!", but it's likely meant to be an onomatopoeia for a powerful sword strike.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And yet, they were people who couldn't even reach the boundary line. There was no reason to be anxious.

Taesan quickly cleaned up the mess.

And so, without even a day passing, he accumulated over 40 points.

And around that time, rumors began to spread. The revived ones said that they had been defeated without being able to put up any resistance. The story of who it was spread, and soon, a new rookie who had just joined began to talk about Taesan.

A monster had entered.

The rumor spread quickly, and soon everyone knew.

Then, those who had been quiet began to move.

"Is this 60 points?"

Taesan organized his points. It seemed like he could open the Colosseum tomorrow. Taesan, who was about to continue moving, stopped.

Five powerful auras were approaching Taesan.

And their power was superior to those Taesan had defeated so far.

Strong ones similar to the princess.

They were people who had crossed the boundary line.

Surrounding Taesan, they said in a low voice.

"......Strong guy."

Taesan was currently in a state where his authority seal was released. His power was spreading freely into the world.

"Why did you come here?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"For confirmation."

They each revealed their powers.

The diverse powers pressed down on Taesan.

"You must be thinking of clearing the Colosseum. Before that, let's test your power."

"Is this a test for losers?"

"I won't deny it. We've given up in the end."

A calm voice echoed.

Taesan examined each of them one by one.

One was holding a sword.

Another was grasping a spear, and the remaining two had powers of magic and dark magic.

And the last one had the power of the spirit.

All five of their powers were diverse.

Taesan quickly organized his thoughts.

"The conditions are met. It's going well."

"......Going well?"

"You're testing me, and I also had something to test."

He was not invincible at this point.

If I had to say what level he was at, he was on the borderline.

Then, could he obtain skills in this state, where his abilities were so lacking?

"Let's see."
