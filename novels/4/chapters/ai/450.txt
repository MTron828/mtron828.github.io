Episode 451

451. The Seventh Return, Earth (3)

The American players were waiting in Las Vegas.

They had set up a defense line, blocking the approaching monsters and preparing to greet the people who would come.

Quadduk.

Amelia's sword pierced the monster's head.

She quickly advanced forward. In an instant, dozens of monsters were cut down.

She swung her sword, shaking off the sticky liquid.

"This is annoying."

"It looks like this area has been cleared."

A man with golden hair and blue eyes, Oliver Khan, the leader of the labyrinth, approached her.

"It should be safe for now. Thank you."

"Try to do better. How long are you going to rely on me to survive? You should do it with your own strength."

"I'll try."

Oliver didn't react much to Amelia's words. He knew from experience that she wasn't saying it out of malice.

She was genuinely worried about them.

If she weren't there, they would be wiped out by the monsters, so she meant to encourage them to try harder.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was just that her tone was aggressive.

Originally, it was worse than this, but it had softened a lot since the duel with Taesan.

Oliver turned his gaze to the sky.

"By the way, if we have to come to the US from Europe and Asia... I wonder how long it'll take and how we'll get here."

"Can't we come through Russia from the Asian side?"

"Well, I've heard that Gang Taesan can split the sea, so... if we go through Russia and cross over to Alaska, it might be possible, but the distance is considerable, don't you think?"

Oliver suddenly let out a laugh.

"Split the sea? Is that really possible?"

"There's nothing impossible."

Amelia said it nonchalantly. Oliver shook his head. It was a power that went beyond his common sense, which could penetrate mysteries.

"But, it's not a bad story. Once things are settled, I'll send someone over there."

Oliver grasped his weapon.

While people were coming from other regions, they couldn't just sit still. They planned to take care of the monsters near Las Vegas one by one and wait for those who would cross the sea to arrive."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

As Amelia and Oliver were quickly organizing the districts, a man with a pale face came to them.

Oliver was taken aback when he saw the man's face.

"Anton? Why are you here? You were supposed to go to San Francisco for reconnaissance."

Anton was skilled at hiding his body. Oliver had sent him to San Francisco, which was adjacent to the Pacific Ocean, to gather information on the surrounding area.

It was impossible for him to return here already.

The man took a deep breath and stuttered.

"P-please follow me. Something is strange."

Anton struggled to speak, still in shock.

Oliver listened to the story in silence, and Amelia frowned.

"......I didn't expect that either."

"Let's go check it out."

Oliver deployed sufficient defense forces in Las Vegas and headed towards San Francisco.

Thanks to Amelia's efforts, they soon arrived at a location where they could see the North Pacific Ocean.

And they were left speechless.

Everyone stared at the sea with shocked faces.

"No way......"

"What the... This is..."

Everything in sight, all the way to the horizon, the sea was frozen.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

No one, not even Amelia, could easily open their mouth. Oliver said in a trembling voice,

"......Is this the work of the gods?"

He told Amelia about the existence that was invading the world.

The scene before their eyes was impossible unless it was a transcendent being.

"No."

Amelia approached the frozen sea, her eyes closed, and her senses expanded.

"Ha."

After a while, she let out a hollow laugh.

Even with her sensing abilities, she couldn't fully confirm the extent of the frozen sea.

And if the cold was enough to freeze the sea, it should have had an effect on them as well, but there was none.

It meant that the one who created the frozen sea was suppressing it.

Amelia knew whose power it was.

"Gang Tae-san."

"I don't care, but I can't believe it. This is really......"

"A miracle of God."

Amelia smiled wryly.

"It's ridiculous. Really."

* * *

Somehow, the American players, who were in a state of confusion, quickly cleaned up the monsters between the North Pacific and Los Angeles.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

As they went through the process, the number of people who saw the frozen sea increased one by one. They all couldn't help but be speechless.

And before a month had passed, a massive crowd appeared on the other side of the frozen sea.

"I'm here."

Oliver Kan and Amelia moved forward. He headed to the front of the crowd.

"Hello."

Kim Hwi-yeon greeted them calmly.

"Oliver Kan, and you're Amelia Airin, right? Nice to meet you."

"You're Kim Hwi-yeon. I'm sorry about what happened at the Colosseum."

"That's already in the past, isn't it? Let's get along well from now on."

They shook hands.

After exchanging greetings, Oliver turned his gaze away with an awkward expression.

"......Gang Tae-san."

"Why."

Tae-san replied. Oliver tried to say something but eventually turned his words around.

"There are many things I'm curious about, but first, let's finish the quest and then we can talk. Follow me. I'll guide you."

They followed the players of the labyrinth.

Amelia kept glancing at Tae-san as she walked ahead. Beldegkia, who was standing next to her, looked at her and let out a sigh of admiration.

"What's with that woman? She's not bad, is she? She's not as good as Lee Tae-yeon, but she's still top-notch."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Amelia arrived around the 60th floor. She had passed the trials of Belvanki.

Belvanki tilted her head.

"But... I sense a familiar aura."

"Amelia, like you, was a adventurer who received the blessing of the God of Fall. She's free now."

"What?"

"Let's talk about it with the princess later."

Before that, Lee Tae-yeon moved. She smiled brightly at Amelia.

"Long time no see, Amelia."

"Oh, it's Lee Tae-yeon?"

Amelia's face, which had been gloomy, brightened up. Soon, Gang Joon-hyuk also joined in. They started chatting happily.

Meanwhile, the American players continued to gaze at Taesan.

Their eyes held awe and fear.

And a faint sense of faith could be felt. Taesan accepted their faith.

Thanks to the American players having cleared the monsters in advance, there were no particular problems.

And they arrived in Las Vegas.

Kim Hwi-yeon was surprised by the city's appearance.

"It's more intact than I thought?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Many buildings were maintaining their shape. Considering that it was hard to find a decent building in Korea, it was a truly amazing thing.

"We had the luxury of doing it differently from you guys. People with confidence in architecture gathered and rebuilt. With many superhumans, it was extremely easy."

Hard-mode players were far stronger than medium-grade equipment. With countless people like that, there was no problem in building structures.

"Over 100 million people will gather, so we need to prepare in advance. But it still might not be enough."

Oliver gazed at the Asian players with a tired face.

There were too many of them.

The number was overwhelming, even in a city like Las Vegas.

Moreover, European players hadn't arrived yet. The city needed to be expanded.

Taesan said, "That part is no problem. I'll take care of it."

"......Is that also possible?" Amelia muttered. Taesan nodded in response. After gazing at Taesan for a moment, she opened her mouth with a determined face.

However, Taesan moved first.

"I'll be gone for a while, so you guys figure it out."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Are you leaving? Where do you plan to go?"

"I'm going to help the players in Europe."

"Ah."

They realized it.

It was easy to cross over to Asia thanks to Taesan, but Europe was a different story. For them, even crossing the ocean was a huge ordeal.

Taesan's help was necessary. Everyone agreed with Taesan's words.

"I'll take care of things here. I'll be gone for a bit."

"Got it."

Amelia also stepped back with a helpless expression. Taesan glanced at them for a moment before taking off.

His destination was Europe.

From afar, he could sense the numerous presences of the European players and already knew where they were.

They were gathered in France.

Taesan traversed the ocean. Monsters kept appearing to block his path, but Taesan eliminated them all.

And as Taesan defeated the monsters, some kind of power began to flow into Bardley and Akasha.

"What's going on?"

Akasha grew stronger and enhanced her abilities every time she defeated an enemy.

There might be memories involved as well.

[...I still don't know.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Akasha, who had been silent for a moment, replied.

[Every time the master defeats an enemy, I feel something. But it's too weak.] [These guys are too weak. No matter how many of them gather, they can't be a match for you. Of course, neither I nor Akasha can obtain any special power.]

"It seems we need to deal with a strong enemy in the end."

And such an enemy will appear in this return.

Taesan needed to prepare for it.

One of the preparations was to raise the proficiency of his divine power to 100%.

If he received worship from all beings on earth, he would naturally become the god of the earth and reach 100% proficiency.

But how could he receive worship?

Taesan was thinking of one way to do it.

Taesan flew away.

* * *

The European players were having a hard time.

They had to cross over to the United States.

But the problem was how to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

"Should we go through the UK? If we pass through Iceland and Greenland, it'll be much simpler!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No. Then we'd have to cross the ocean too many times. It's safer to go through Africa and Brazil."

"That's too long a detour. The risk is too great!"

They strongly argued, each convinced that their opinion was correct. They were still stuck in France, unable to move.

"Hmm..."

Daniel Darmon, the leader of Europe, stroked his chin with a troubled face.

Neither side could be considered right, and so he couldn't easily make a decision.

But it was time to make a choice.

After much deliberation, Daniel was about to speak when...

"What?"

"What's that?"

A murmur spread. Following the gaze of the people, a small dot appeared in the distance.

"Is that a bird? But it's too big..."

The dot was rapidly growing larger.

Daniel's pupils dilated.

It was a person.

The person who had flown in at high speed landed in front of Daniel. When everyone was stunned and unable to react to the sudden event, the person opened their mouth.

"Daniel Darmon?"

"...Ah."

Daniel realized who the person was.

It was a face he had seen once at the Colosseum.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Mr. Gangtaesan?"

"Gangtaesan."

The surroundings suddenly became noisy at the mention of that name. Only French players had seen Gangtaesan in person. Others had not seen him.

But everyone knew that name.

The strongest in the world, an unbeatable superhuman.

"How did you get here?"

"I crossed the ocean to help you."

"The ocean... crossed... No, if it's Mr. Gangtaesan, that's enough."

Daniel, who had regained his composure, looked at Gangtaesan with a hopeful face.

"If Mr. Gangtaesan is here, it will be much easier."

"What are you worried about?"

"I'm worried about whether to go through Brazil or take a detour through the UK to Greenland. What do you think, Mr. Gangtaesan?"

"Neither is necessary."

"What?"

"We'll cross the ocean."

"...What?"

"Follow me."

Gangtaesan walked forward. Daniel, who had been stunned, hastily followed him.

"If we cross the ocean..."

"We'll take the shortest route across the Atlantic."

"Is that possible?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Daniel's face was filled with dismay.

He also knew that Taesan had parted the sea.

But that was a relatively short distance between Japan and Korea.

The one between Europe and America was the Atlantic Ocean, one of the five great oceans of the world. No matter how great Taesan was, it was hard to believe that he could do it.

"It's possible, so follow me."

"......If it's Taesan's words, I'll follow first."

Daniel replied with a calm face.

He told the people.

The strongest player, Gang Taesan, had come to help them.

We're going to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

Naturally, doubts and skepticism erupted. They knew he was strong, but they claimed it was impossible to cross the Atlantic Ocean directly.

That was something only a god could do, they said.

Daniel desperately tried to convince them.

"It's not that far from here to the Atlantic Ocean anyway. Let's go that way first."

"......Alright."

They reluctantly agreed, but their eyes, looking at Taesan, were still filled with distrust.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$It was only natural. People couldn't believe in something they hadn't seen with their own eyes. And if it was something close to miraculous, they were even less likely to.

Of course, Tsunami didn't really care.

What he wanted was the faith of all people.

They needed to believe in Tsunami and follow him.

But how could he make that happen?

Tsunami came up with an answer.

It was quite simple.

He just needed to show them what he could do.

Shatter their disbelief and show them power beyond their imagination.

He did have the ability to do so.

They had arrived at the sea.

People looked at Tsunami with a mix of emotions.

Expectation, disbelief, suspicion, curiosity.

Tsunami opened his mouth.

"Freeze."

[You have initiated the freeze declaration.]

Amazing!

The sea froze in an instant.

Everything within sight turned into ice.

"....."

"What?"

No one could open their mouths. All those emotions had turned into one - awe.

"Then let's go."

Tsunami stepped onto the ice.

And a month later.

Tsunami had arrived in Las Vegas without losing a single European player.
