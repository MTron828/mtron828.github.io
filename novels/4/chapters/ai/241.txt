Chapter 242

242. The Fourth Return. Earth (9)

The battle that lasted for a whole week continued without a break.

As they relentlessly eliminated the monsters that kept appearing, they filled in the cracks. There were also some dead bodies, but their number was not too large.

They believed they could win.

And after a week, the generation of cracks suddenly stopped.

People believed they had won. They celebrated with the limited resources they had.

However, Taesan knew that this was not the end.

He waited patiently for the right moment.

And three days later, Taesan got up from his seat in the room.

"Master?"

[Ah, have you finally come.]

Minerva and Barcassa also sensed something was off and got up.

Taesan left the room and went outside.

A tremendous power was felt coming from the east.

People also felt it and were looking towards the east. Taesan arrived at the location where the power was felt most strongly.

There was a crack there.

But its color was not the same as the crimson light.
It was a red light similar to scarlet.
Here is the translation of the text:

And the shape of the crack itself was abnormal. Until now, the crack had been a concentration of power, but now it was like a sticky liquid.

"Hmm."

Minerva swung her arm.

The wind became a sword and rushed towards the crack.

Kaaaang!

The sword that hit the crack bounced back.

"...Not taken."

Even Minerva's genuine attack did not take effect.

Tae-san approached the crack with his hand.

The crack was like a heart beating rapidly.

Tae-san strengthened his hand.

Kuuuung!

A massive shockwave erupted. Although the sacred vessel and the king's vessel were not used, they still gathered strength and struck.

However, the crack did not move at all.

"Is it time to prepare?"

[Quest starts] [In an hour, the final crack will open.] [Fight and achieve victory.] [Condition: Defeat the monster that appears from the crack.] [If you return to the labyrinth, the reward will be distributed differently.]

The quest appeared before them. As people began to gather, understanding the abnormality.

"Ah, elder brother."

The gold-seeking gold that had been found, Tae-san, turned pale. Kim Hwi-yeon, Lee Tae-yeon, and Kang Jun-hyeok also appeared.

They looked at the crack and swallowed their saliva.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Danger... is coming."

"What are you going to do?"

"I don't think we can handle this existence, but... ."

The people of Seoul knew this because they had experienced it before. At the end of the return, a monster that couldn't be opposed always emerged, and we had to face it.

Kim Hui-yeon spoke calmly.

"I don't know what will happen, so I'll prepare here."

"Do it as you want."

Kim Hui-yeon quickly gave orders to the people. They adjusted their formation, kept a distance, and surrounded the gap.

Crackle.

The gap began to expand gradually.

And the passage was opened.

* * *

The dark space beyond the red-lit passage.

A monster began to appear there.

"Ah... ."

Although the monster was not fully visible yet, people were already trembling. Goosebumps rose on their bodies, and sweat began to flow. Their instincts screamed.

Gggg.

The monster squeezed its body into the narrow passage.

The passage was only the size of a fist, but it was still too small for the monster to pass through. The monster's entire body began to compress.
Here is the translation of the text:

But the monster continued to squeeze its body into the space.

Clang.

In the end, the monster revealed its complete form outside the crack.

It had a concrete shape, but it was damaged.

As it passed through the tunnel, half of its body was crushed and it was in a state of complete disintegration. Even its own form was distorted.

However, it still had an overwhelming presence that overwhelmed them.

"Ah, ah..."

People's eyes met. A chill ran down their spines.

Bing-bang.

The monster's gaze turned towards them.

Instantly, they stopped breathing.

[Judgment in progress... ]

"Uh, uhuh!"

"Eeek!"

People screamed in terror. Their souls and bodies were about to be torn apart.

"Minerva."

"I understand. This will be tough."

Minerva's serious face appeared, and the power of the Spirit King enveloped the people.

[Judgment successful!]

"Uhuh!"

"Ah! Ah!"

The people who had succeeded in the judgment gasped for breath.

"Ah..."

Fear spread across people's faces.

Instant death judgment. If the judgment fails, they will die immediately. Defense and physical strength are meaningless.
Here is the translation of the text:

And that kind of monster was S-grade and above.

[Monster 10 has appeared.]

"Whoa."

Tai Shan raised the corners of his mouth.

I didn't think it would be real, but it's really S-grade. This is beyond my expectations.

[What's that...?]

The ghost swallowed saliva.

"Don't you remember meeting the God of Despair during the trial of the gods? It's similar to that guy."

[But it's not comparable to that time.]

"That's because things that cannot be perfectly implemented even with divine power are like that."

"It's one of the best toys among the divine toys."

Minerva narrowed her eyes.

"A being that can crush the world by itself. Just facing it makes a mortal being unable to withstand and collapse, and without the blessing of the gods, it can collapse the world."

Minerva's evaluation is not an exaggeration. After all, no one except Tai Shan and Iteyan has been able to survive the judgment.

Hard mode players who have cleared the game are as strong as monsters. Even they cannot survive the judgment, which means that for ordinary beings, it is impossible to respond at all.

S-grade.

He who has lived before has to risk his life to crush it.

Note: The text appears to be a dialogue or narration from a fantasy game or story, with characters discussing a powerful monster known as S-grade.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was weaker than before. There was no way to win by fighting.

However, the face of the Great Mountain did not show any fear.

"It's a pity I didn't kill him. I'll send this kind of guy down."

The monster emerged from a crack, its entire body trembling and suffering severe injuries. If it was not going to retreat, it would have to bear the loss and deliberately sent it down.

Therefore, the S-grade monster was weakened. If it was in its normal state, it would have been impossible to block the judgment of instant death with Minerva's power.

So, the current Great Mountain was also sufficient.

[You have activated surveillance.] [You have activated essence perception.] [Monster 10] [Summon type, special type.] [The tenth toy of a great existence.] [It's in a state of disrepair after passing through a narrow place.]

"I'm guarding it."

"Yes, let's do it."

[Understood.]

Hmph.

The Great Mountain grasped the sword and jumped.

[You have activated acceleration.]

The ground cracked, and debris flew towards the people. Minerva deployed a barrier to protect them.

The Great Mountain arrived in front of the monster in an instant.
Here is the translation of the text:

People were shocked by the incredible speed. The sword of Taesan was lowered and struck.

"What the heck!?"

The monster's body shook violently. A black fluid flowed out from the damaged area.

[The monster took 3403 points of damage.]

It's possible that the difference in levels is the reason why the damage is not trivial. However, the effective damage was still entering. If it were a normal S-grade, the damage would not have been so severe.

The creature's body was shaking.

The monsters that had been hiding there jumped out. Dozens of monsters with various forms, such as those of tigers and snakes, rushed towards Taesan.

"'Summon-type', I said."

Taesan's sword moved.

He struck the monster with his head and activated the crystal arrow, sending it flying. He also used his ability sword to parry the monsters' charge.

"Ka-ka-ka!"

Dozens of monsters fell simultaneously.

The onlookers were astonished.

"Wow!"

"Of course!"

They were convinced of their victory, but Taesan's expression was not that bright.

There was no way he couldn't defeat such a monster. If he had, the gods would not have been so calm.
Here is the translation of the text:

But this was too weak.

The summoned monsters were only at the level of B-grade. Even if there were thousands of them, they couldn't deal a significant blow to Taesan.

Taesan realized.

This monster was not a monster that came to kill him.

It was a monster that came to capture him.

Ugh.

The head of the monster in a concrete form opened.

[The internal world was activated.]

A endless darkness flowed out of the head. The darkness that flowed out blackened the ground and enveloped everything around it in an instant.

The scattered darkness pulled Taesan towards it.

Taesan put his strength into his feet and resisted the suction force.

But the darkness crushed his resistance and tried to swallow Taesan.

"Still..."

It would be possible to hold on for a while with the power of the S-grade suction force, but it's just a matter of time.

Although the monster was damaged and lost its strength, the suction force itself was still at the level of S-grade.

"Taesan, Taesan!"

Kim Hwi-yeon rushed towards Taesan's figure as he was being pulled in.

As Taesan sank into the darkness, he said:

"I'll leave the rest to you."

The darkness swallowed Taesan.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san first sensed something. He realized that there was no problem and looked around.

All he saw was endless darkness.

It was an eternal darkness that couldn't be seen to the end.

"I've experienced entering a monster's body for the first time."

Is everything okay?

"What's wrong?"

It's about my mind. I've entered the monster's body, so it will have an impact on my mind, but I think I'm fine.

He felt a slight pressure, but it was at a level that could be ignored. Tae-san stepped on the ground.

It was solid.

He drew his sword and struck it down, but not a single scratch appeared.

[1 damage to the monster.]

"Ah, indeed."

The monster broke through the narrow passage and collapsed. It was unnecessary to say.

It's likely that it had given up on the external part and was only protecting the internal part to catch Tae-san.

Tae-san turned his gaze.

He saw thousands of monsters beyond the darkness.

He took a step forward.

* * *

Meanwhile, people outside were in a state of chaos.

"Ah, ahah?"

Tae-san disappeared.

People were shocked by this fact. Minerba frowned.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, are you planning this? It's not bad."

"Minerva, what's going on with this...?"

"It's simple."

Minerva pointed to the monster with her finger. The enormous monster was fixed to the ground like a pillar.

"I judged that they couldn't kill my master, so I chose a much easier method."

Hssss.

Small monsters emerged from the big one.

The number was over a hundred. People's faces turned pale.

"So, they'll catch their master inside and kill you all during that time."

The monsters moved.

Minerva and Barkazar exerted their strength. Light and wind simultaneously occurred, sweeping away the monsters.

In the instant when hundreds of monsters were swept away, the enormous monster suddenly rushed forward.

The monster swung its massive arm.

Kaaaang!

The powerful force and the collision of wind and light exploded and scattered.

The enormous monster gave a fierce gaze.

From there, Minerva felt a powerful force that was not to be underestimated by the monster.

"It'll be fun."

Even Minerva, who was now facing this monster, felt a sense of power that was not to be underestimated.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Can we do it? We need to clear a spot for a little while, you and I."

"We'll do it together. Your Majesty."

Barkaza and Minerva flew towards the giant monster.

Tae-san, Minerva, and Barkaza - all the entities that protected them vanished. This realization sent a wave of panic.

"Aaaaah!"

"Save the people!"

"All calm down!"

Kim Hui-yeon shouted as she charged towards the monster. The monster's attack flew towards her.

"Ka ka ka!"

"Ugh!"

She was blown away with a groan.

"...Strong..."

She was stronger than any monster she had ever seen.

There were hundreds of them.

Her eyes wavered for a moment, but she quickly regained her composure and shouted.

"We can win!"

Kim Jung-geun stepped forward. I Tae-yeon and Kang Jun-hyeok quickly launched an attack on the monsters.

"Ka ka ka!"

The two of them didn't get blown away like Kim Hui-yeon. The sight of them pressuring the monsters made the crowd's confusion settle slightly.
Here is the translation of the text:

In that situation, Kim Hwi-yeon shouted loudly.

"Everyone, stand together!"

"Yes, yes!"

The people moved hastily. Kim Hwi-yeon bit her lips.

Taesan trusted her and entrusted her with his hopes. She couldn't disappoint those expectations.

"Taesan will come soon and help us! Just hold on until then!"

"Yes!"

The people calmly took up their weapons. Kim Hwi-yeon strengthened her resolve.

"Alright, let's do it."

She charged forward. The people followed her.

"Watch me!"

"Give me strength!"

They rushed towards the monster, shouting like people praying to a god or knights battling in a holy war.

Their faith became a source of strength, flowing to someone.

[The level of divine power increased by 1%.]
