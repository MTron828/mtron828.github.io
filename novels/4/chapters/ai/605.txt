**Episode 606**

**606. Extra Story, The Story Ahead (1)**

"Alright, bring it on."

Lee Tae-yeon leisurely draws his sword. Hashiangka charges at him with a stern face.

**Whoosh!**

The battle between Hashiangka and Lee Tae-yeon begins.

The loud noise and collision erupt. Kang Joon-hyuk, who was watching from a distance, mutters to himself.

"You're fighting well."

**Rumble, rumble, boom...**

The aftermath of the battle settles quickly. Hashiangka lies on the ground, half-paralyzed.

"Good job."

The Narai people had decided to help the Earth.

Hashiangka remained here as a connection point. Hashiangka, who was lying on the ground, opens her mouth.

"......You're really strong. I couldn't even touch you."

It was as if Amelia had an impenetrable wall, but Lee Tae-yeon was simply untouchable. It felt like he could read all her thoughts, senses, and instincts.

"Is that how you feel?"

Lee Tae-yeon had a skill that could turn possibilities around.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

At least within the variables she could control, there was no such thing as something she couldn't understand.

"Let's try again."

"……."

Hashiangka silently ignited her struggle. The moment she stood up.

"You're working hard."

"Ah, Lord Gangtaesan!"

"Oh, you're here?"

Hashiangka trembled and prostrated herself on the ground.

"How's the Earth?"

"It's good. It's developing very well."

Lee Taeyeon smiled brightly.

The Narains sent their technology and technicians.

Although they struggled with the highly advanced equipment at first, they gradually adapted and learned to handle it.

The Narains' technology, which replaced nuclear power, brought electricity and light to them. In an instant, the broken equipment was restored, and infrastructure began to take shape.

They were making progress.

"We've found a comfortable state. I don't think there will be any big problems from now on."

"That's fortunate."

"Yes. We have plenty of time to talk leisurely."

Lee Taeyeon, who was smiling single-mindedly, looked out at the city.

"We've survived. Taesan."

They had once been destroyed.

And now, they were living again.

Only Lee Taeyeon and Taesan remembered that. Just the two of them.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It seems like that."

Lee Tae-yeon's eyes lit up as if he had remembered something.

"Do you remember what we talked about at Taesan previously?"

"What talk?"

"You know, when you said you'd tell me what you did in the labyrinth."

What did Taesan do in that mode?

Taesan tilted his head, puzzled.

"I told you, didn't I? The method to acquire skills."

"Not that. I'm talking about your own story."

"Ah."

Taesan understood what he meant.

"My own story."

His own story, which he had never told anyone properly. He had only shared the method to acquire skills, but the trials and errors he went through, and the mindset he had when challenging the skill acquisition, only he knew.

"......I'll tell you later."

Originally, he had no intention of telling the story. He thought it was a past that had already gone by and was unnecessary.

But after seeing the demon's past, his thoughts changed slightly.

"Later, when my thoughts are a bit more organized."

"Alright. Ah, and Taesan, I have some good news!"

"What good news?"

"Someone who has a child has appeared!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taeyeon said with a happy face.

* * *

Humanity will advance.

We will restore the Earth, utilize the technology of the Narin people, and move forward. We will have children and tell the next generation how we survived and what we sacrificed.

And someday, their story will become history.

They will move forward.

Snap.

Space is torn apart. Taesan lightly landed on the ground.

"It's been a while."

A medieval-style village.

This was the entrance to the labyrinth.

As soon as Taesan appeared, the labyrinth's administrator appeared.

[Taesan.]

"Hello. Balbambara."

[...What's going on here?]

There was a hint of warning in Balbambara's voice.

"It's nothing. I just wanted to take a look. You won't do anything troublesome, so don't worry."

[It's the first time I've heard such an unreliable statement.]

Balbambara grumbled and stepped back. Taesan, who had been looking around the village, took a step forward.

"Ah."

And a black-haired man greeted him.

Broken Man. The one who gave up on entering the labyrinth and sat down.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Long time no see."

"It's been a long time."

The Broken Man bowed his head respectfully.

"Conqueror of the labyrinth and our savior, you may speak freely."

"Is this okay? Can I come in?"

"Anytime."

The Broken Man straightened up.

"You are the legitimate conqueror of the labyrinth, after all."

He entered the labyrinth.

It seemed that the Barbambara had written the numbers. The monsters didn't appear. Thanks to that, Taesan was able to descend into the labyrinth without any hindrance, as if he were traveling. Even if they had appeared, it wouldn't have mattered.

And Taesan met a familiar face.

"Oh, Mr. Taesan."

"Long time no see, Halfan. Have you been doing well?"

"Yes."

Halfan wore a very satisfied smile. There were exceptional weapons around him that he hadn't seen before.

"Thanks to Mr. Taesan, I've reached a higher level. At this rate, I think I'll be able to make weapons of the same level as yours someday."

[Don't even dream about it. Do you think I'll become such a mediocre person?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not that I'm cheap. I'm just reaching a higher level."

Harfan smiled faintly.

Taesan continued to descend. He was the 51st floor's Gremリン. He met Barija. Barija greeted Taesan with a familiar face.

"Welcome!"

Taesan stayed with Barija for a few days.

They exchanged various stories.

And Taesan descended into the labyrinth again. He soon met Lebinafov and Ainshar.

"Oh! Taesan!"

"Nice to meet you. Savior of the universe."

Lebinafov bowed politely.

"How have you been?"

"Thanks to you, I've been living a comfortable life with my apostle."

Lebinafov smiled quietly.

"It's all thanks to you, Taesan."

"You look comfortable, that's good."

"Ah! And there's good news!"

Ainshar's eyes sparkled.

"You know, the aftermath of the war hasn't ended yet. Many gods have died, and there are many unstable planets. Lebinafov-nim is planning to go to one of them!"

"Are you gathering faith again?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's right! We're protecting the planet and receiving their faith! Lord Levienov can regain his former power!"

"It's still an uncertain story. They might not believe in me."

Levienov smiled at Ainzhart, but his expression wasn't bad.

"That's great news. Congratulations."

Taesan sincerely congratulated them.

As he went back down to the labyrinth, he saw the guides of evil. They were startled when they saw Taesan and retreated.

"Don't worry. I'm not thinking of doing anything to you now."

"Huh, then..."

"It seems like you're going down into the labyrinth."

"Yes, yes."

Ambresia nodded her head with a mixture of emotions.

"It's still difficult, but we're making progress little by little."

They were each working hard to conquer the labyrinth in their own way.

As Taesan went further down, he met Diana, Belvendia, and Lirris.

"Oh, Ta... no, Lord Taesan!"

Lirris greeted him with a friendly face.

"You're here!"

"Why are you being so polite?"

"I don't know. It feels a bit awkward, but it seems right to do so."

Lirris scratched his head.

"Just do as you like."

"Okay. Then I'll speak informally."

"Alright."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You're here."

Diana and Belvandia also welcomed Taesan.

"Have you been resting well?"

"So-so."

Belvandia said calmly.

"I was taking a break for now."

The god of downfall. The wound that Essence left on Diana was not small. She needed to heal her mind, so she was taking a break here with Relis and Belvandia.

"There's some good news."

"What's the good news?"

"I talked to the wizard. We can go down to the labyrinth again."

"Is that possible?"

"It was originally impossible. The princess failed, and I was bound by a contract. But since we're trying to save the universe, it's an exception, I suppose."

Belvandia smiled faintly. The two of them had been helping to defeat monsters on Earth. The wizard seemed to appreciate their help.

"Not now, but... I'll go down to the labyrinth again too."

Diana's eyes quietly burned with determination. Relis muttered, looking disappointed.

"So, I'll be alone again?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Release. Aren't you the contractor of the labyrinth? We'll meet again in the labyrinth anyway."

"Hmm, that's true..."

"You're doing well on your own."

"Great! Look!"

Lis releases her arm, and a type of mana takes shape, soon to be realized.

Whoa!

The fireworks explode.

Lis has unleashed an incredibly dense magic that's hard to believe.

"Look! We've reached this far!"

Lis spins her body around and shouts.

"It's all thanks to you, Taesan!"

* * *

Taesan continues to descend into the labyrinth.

He meets many people, including Coslun, whom he encountered in the labyrinth.

He sees them again and talks to them.

Many beings are living their lives for their own desires, for their own lives, in this universe that he has protected and saved.

It was a meaningful thing for Taesan as well.

And finally, Taesan arrives at the end.

The end of the labyrinth.

On the 100th floor.

"Goodbye."

The wizard is there.

"What's with the labyrinth?"

"Just... I wanted to see the path I've taken again."

"How was it?"

"Not bad."

"That's a relief."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The mage gazes at Taesan with a smile.

"Did you hear that from Mashin?"

Taesan nodded his head.

Before leaving, Mashin said to Taesan:

"The Transcenders will find you.

Not because of some grand, universal problem, but for a deeply personal, solely individual reason.

"The universe is slowly getting organized, and the Transcenders have gained some leisure. So... we also want to fulfill our own desires."

The mage speaks in a low tone.

"Taesan, do you know how one becomes a Transcender?"

"It's about dedicating oneself to that concept."

Exactly that. Dedicating oneself. One must sacrifice everything.

Mashin received the faith of all demon tribes and reached the realm of the Concept God.

In other words, if one does not reach the realm of the faith level of all demon tribes alone, one cannot become a Transcender.

"We Transcenders, including myself, have sacrificed everything. At the end of that, we became Transcenders. As such, we have absolute pride."

The pride of being the greatest in the universe.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Of course, there is a certain gap in power and prestige among transcenders, but they don't think they are superior to anyone. So, they don't reveal themselves to anyone, nor do they have any intention of doing so. Why? Because in their own concept of dominance, they are the greatest.

The God of Fall. Essence dominates the concept of fall in the universe. There is no being that surpasses it in fall.

The God of Victory. Baltazar dominates the concept of victory in the universe. There is no being that surpasses it in victory.

No one can reach their concept.

That was a common thought shared by all transcenders.

"But paradoxically, they have a desire to boast about what they have achieved. They want to show off what they have built to others."

I have reached this realm.

I dominate the concept of the universe.

How did I get here?

I am so great.

"Am I that target?"

"Because you are the absolute ruler of the universe, recognized by everyone."

The finger points to Taesan.

Taesan is greater than any transcender and has reached an unparalleled realm.

That fact is an undeniable truth.

So, Taesan can reveal himself.

"The Demon God probably showed you the past for the same reason. She also wanted to open up to someone about herself."

Note: "초월자" is translated to "transcender", but it can also be translated to "transcendent being" or "being beyond human". "개념" is translated to "concept", but it can also be translated to "domain" or "realm".
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The magician waves his hand. The concept of the labyrinth is condensed there.

"I am the lord of the labyrinth. I have abandoned my own concept and grasped this small realm with my hand, a lofty being."

The magician's eyes shine like starlight.

The universe is contained within.

"What kind of transcendent being was I?"

A low, murmuring voice is heard.

"What did I create the labyrinth for? It's a desire that only I know, unknown even to other transcendent beings. I want to show it to you and hear your thoughts."

The magician leans back in his chair.

"It's not just my own wish."

Many gazes are felt, each containing a concept.

Struggle and death.

Victory.

Choice.

Sword.

And many more, each governing a concept that penetrates the entire universe, transcendent beings.

"Let's see."

"This could be seen as another one of our desires."

An opportunity to prove oneself to someone stronger and greater than anyone, to demonstrate what one has built up.

Until now, they had to receive trials from the mountain and prove themselves.

But now, the relationship has been reversed.

"Will you accept it?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A quiet question. Taesan closed his mouth.

Feeling numerous gazes and emotions.

Taesan opened his mouth.

'I won't accept it.'"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
