Chapter 225

225. The King of the Wind Spirits, Minerva (3)

"Ah......"

Hasak stared blankly at the remaining aura of the spirit that was disappearing.

The high-ranking spirit he had contracted with.

His absolute power.

The strongest power in the world that no one could deny.

It has been shattered to pieces now.

"...This can't be!"

Hasak shouted involuntarily.

"No matter how! No matter how! Even the existence of the labyrinth! It's impossible to erase a high-ranking spirit so easily!"

"That's not a problem for you to judge. It's a problem for me to judge."

Tae-san approached Hasak calmly and grabbed his head.

Hasak glared at Tae-san with bloodshot eyes.

"You're a cheat! I don't know what trick you used, but you dare to reverse summon my spirit! You'll die!"

"What's going on."

It seemed like Tae-san had used something to reverse summon a spirit from the labyrinth.

[Is this a reality denial due to shock? Although it's not uncommon, cases this extreme are rare.] [This despicable human.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Hask is constantly belching and denying the actions of Taesan. Holding Hask's head, Taesan looked down at him with a vacant expression.

It's not a problem to kill someone.

However, the Spirit King said, "They are beings that I must protect." He told Taesan to scold them properly.

"Are you going to snap out of it?"

Taesan's body began to gather power.

The people who were watching from a distance were shocked and took a step back.

Three seals were activated.

Using twisted magical resonance, he gathered the magical energy.

And then, he unleashed his will using conceptual skills.

Taesan's presence overwhelmed them.

"Ahh."

The faces of the people turned pale.

Their breathing began to stagnate as they were crushed by the power emanating from Taesan. It was not just a simple pressure of power. His aura was also incredibly high.

A presence that they couldn't approach, an overwhelming existence.

"Ahh, ahh, ahh..."

They bowed their heads in reverence, as if worshiping a great god, towards Taesan.

"What's going on?"

Taesan's reaction to their response was a mixture of emotions.

He deliberately excluded physical pressure. At their level, if they were to touch him, they would be instantly crushed and killed, so he only showed his presence.

Note: The text appears to be a scene from a fantasy novel or manhwa, and the translation may not be accurate without more context.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I thought he would be overwhelmed and intimidated, but I couldn't anticipate a response like this kind of worship. [You're not even close to my level among these people.] Sado's concept skills and divine skills are all mixed together, and his power is approachable to the gods.

Even in a world where the strongest is a high-ranking angel, Sado's presence is almost an unstoppable force.

Taesan, who had gathered his strength, looked down at Hask again. His face, pressed against the rank, had turned white like a blank sheet.

"This, this isn't right."

He stuttered.

"This can't be. You're lying, you're lying."

[Oh, you're still denying it even after being crushed by the rank? That's amazing. And here, my emotions are twisted. I have a distorted self-belief. Is it possible that all these things are mixed together? It's like a miracle.]

"Annoying."

Taesan spat out his tongue.

This guy is not a threat. With this level of power, how could he possibly deal with me and the angel king?

But if I leave him alone, he'll probably come looking for trouble tomorrow.

That's annoying.

'What to do?'

Taesan narrowed his eyes."
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan was gazing at Hasak calmly, and he could sense something within him.

"What's this?"

This was a connecting link. Taesan focused his energy and analyzed where the link led.

"Is it a spirit?"

It was connected to a different dimension.

Taesan realized that this was a contract between Hasak and a higher-ranking spirit.

"Is it possible?"

[You have activated the Sadohwa [Mingled Energy].]

Taesan's power reached a higher level. Barkaja was shocked.

"[Who's the master? What's going on with this power...]."

Taesan touched Hasak's connecting link.

However, the link was shaken but not caught.

This was a contract between a spirit and a human, formed by itself. No matter how powerful the strength or how exceptional the level, it couldn't be touched.

But if it's the power of a god, the story is different.

From the beginning, the power of the perfect and now abandoned existence has been twisted.

Twisted energy adjustment moves the spirit. The spirit that moved in this way touched the connecting link.

"What?"

Hasak's eyes trembled.
Here is the translation of the text:

It didn't seem to be possible to grasp what Taesan was trying to do, but it was clear that he was touching on something extremely important.

"Don't do it!"

"It's too late."

Taesan poured his strength into the spirit.

The connection was severed.

"Ahh, ahh, ahh!"

Haska fell to the ground, covering his head. The important thing that was sustaining him was slipping away.

"What's going on? [Master, did you just tamper with the contract?]"

Baruka was shocked. The contract was made directly between the divine being and humans. No one else was allowed to touch it, unless the divine being itself permitted it.

That's what Taesan had done.

"This feeling, is it?"

Taesan recovered the wavering spirit.

He could vaguely sense how the banished nobles were still interfering in this world.

Their power was distorted.

"It's not perfect."

The severed connection was trying to reconnect. Perhaps it would be restored in just a week.

Interfering was possible, but breaking the law itself was impossible.

However, Haska, unaware of this, was staring blankly at his own head.

"...What did you do to me?"

"Shut up."
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san dropped Hak-seok from afar. The people who were watching from a distance were shocked and received it.

"This is something you shouldn't touch. There's no such thing as that."

Tae-san said. His small voice was clearly heard by their ears.

"If you continue to approach, you will pay the price too."

Tae-san's voice echoed through the stillness.

"Ah, I'm back!"

A girl with sky-blue hair from the white space. Minerva welcomed Tae-san.

"Well done! You're still a human sent by my father!"

She hugged Tae-san's waist and twirled around.

The people who heard Tae-san's last words took Hak-seok and backed away.

Although they didn't seem to be leaving immediately, most of them had lost their intention of how to deal with the situation. Most people probably wouldn't approach anymore.

The group led by Aki-en, who was backing away, looked at Tae-san with a strange gaze.

Fear, respect, and gratitude.

To those who knew the truth of the sphere, it was natural to be grateful to Tae-san for protecting the sphere. Minerva twirled around again. She pulled out a ball and laughed.

"So let's play again!"
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's okay."

Tai Shan nodded his head.

Asking someone to play cards was pointless. Tai Shan threw the card, the Spirit King received it and threw it back, it was a simple repetition.

However, the Spirit King was very happy with this simple repetition.

"It's fun!"

"It's okay. It's okay."

"Having more people to play with would be nice, don't you think?"

She looked at Baruka and laughed.

"Why don't you play with us too?"

[As the king wishes, so it shall be.]

Baruka joined in.

She didn't stop talking to the ghost either.

"Why don't you play with us too?"

[I'm bored. And I can't do that kind of thing.]

The ghost was a floating existence without a physical body. It was impossible for him to touch a tangible card.

However, the Spirit King waved his hand lightly.

"Then I'll make one for you!"

[What?]

A thick aura was infused into the ghost's spirit. The aura took shape, forming a physical body, and the ghost was embodied in it.

[......huh?]

The ghost was embodied in a mannequin-like form.

He seemed to be startled and moved his body around awkwardly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"[Body?] 'Is it okay now? Let's play together!'

'[Can I make a body even at the level of a spirit king?]'

The ghost was startled. He had received a body before, but that was a trial of Fabcash, which was achieved through the power of God.

'This is a space that protects me until I grow up. I can do many things here.'

Minerva smiled wryly.

'I can lend you a temporary body, even if it's not perfect. But it's limited to within this space only.'

'It's definitely like that.'

The ghost waved his hand, and the hand fell apart and fell off.

The body was extremely fragile.

But it seemed that it would be enjoyable to play around.

Minerva shouted.

'Then let's play together!'

'Ah, I didn't know I could take care of you, but...'

The ghost complained, but followed obediently. It seemed that he was enjoying having a body for the first time.

'[It's better than just watching without being able to do anything.]'

Barcas and the ghost, the spirit king, and the mountain god started throwing a ball.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

The numbers had only increased, but it was the same as just throwing a ball. Minerva seemed to be having the most fun.

And time passed. The white space gradually darkened.

"Zzz..."

Minerva nodded off, her head bobbing up and down.

"I'm doing well... See you tomorrow."

She waved her hand. The white space receded, and Taesan returned to the outside world.

Taesan sat down in front of the crystal. Barzag opened its mouth.

[The spirit is a solitary existence. Therefore, a newly born spirit relies on the existence around it and does not cling to it. This is no different from the king. Originally, one would rely heavily on the creation and defense after growing up, but... this king seems to have chosen to rely on the owner.]

"Not bad. It feels like I'm seeing a child for the first time."

The system of the labyrinth is fair to both the old and the young. Whether one is old or young, the stats are equal.

However, the young and immature spirits who were not yet mature were unable to survive in the labyrinth. Even those who survived mostly died during their return to Earth.
Here is the translation of the text:

Since it was a long time since he had seen a pure and innocent spirit king like his child, he had lived in the world devastated by struggle and had found some solace for his mind.

"Aaaa!"

And at that time, Hasak was going crazy.

His office was completely ruined.

"Come out! Come out! Let's go!"

He shouted loudly.

But nothing happened.

"A, aaaa..."

The presence of the high-ranking spirit who had been with him for his entire life was no longer felt.

"What's going on..."

The connection that had been severed was being reconnected again. Although it would be possible to summon the high-ranking spirit again after just a week, Hasak, who didn't know that, thought that the mountain had already broken the contract.

"Hah, hahah..."

He sat down dazed.

He hung his head and muttered to himself.

"It's over."

The rumor that his contract with the high-ranking spirit had been severed was already spreading.

People would soon understand the truth of the rumor and learn that it was true.

Then, they would ruthlessly abandon Hasak.
Here is the translation of the text:

He knew it himself. It was because he had made a contract with a high-ranking spirit that no one would punish him. Without the shield, he felt that nothing was valuable to him anymore.

"......it's okay."

Haskur patted himself on the back, trying to reassure himself.

"You only need to enter the labyrinth. You can get the power to be worthy of a god."

In the labyrinth, one can obtain the power to be worthy of a god. All you need to do is enter it.

Haskur, who was obsessed with the labyrinth, thought that as long as he entered it, he could obtain power.

"Mi, how do I get into the labyrinth?"

However, there was a problem. He didn't know how to enter the labyrinth. He stood there for a long time, his face twisted in frustration.

"......aha! That's the entrance to the labyrinth! That scoundrel is blocking it because he's afraid of me getting stronger!"

The one who had obtained power by occupying the labyrinth was afraid of Haskur getting stronger, so he was blocking the entrance.

"You little scoundrel! Dare to challenge me who has become great!"

Suddenly, Haskur's mind was convinced that this was the answer. He began to go crazy again.

"Power! Power!"

The great power! The power to become a god!

Haskur shouted with all his might.

The god granted his wish.
Here is the translation of the text:

The room was in disarray.

Suddenly, darkness engulfed the office. The fluorescent light, which had been shining brightly, suddenly stopped.

"What's going on?"

He swallowed hard.

The darkness in the office was sucking in everything like a vacuum cleaner. And then, a dark figure appeared at that location.

Haska took a deep breath.

This was a darkness that had a physical form, yet it was also wavering like a shadow and dispersing like smoke. The darkness had countless shapes and stretched out its body long.

"Ah, ah..."

He instinctively closed his eyes. He was afraid of looking at the existence in front of him, which seemed to be able to corrupt his soul and drag him down into a deep abyss just by looking at it. He had a premonition that this existence was the kind that could corrupt his soul and drag him down into a deep abyss just by looking at it.

Haska realized.

This darkness was not a permitted existence in the world.

It was a being that could swallow up everything and create a black world.

The darkness asked him.

Do you want power?

Haska couldn't answer immediately.

He was scared.

Even he, who wanted power so much, felt a primal fear in the face of the darkness, which seemed to contain his own fear within it.
However, Hasak nodded his shaking head.

He wanted power. He had lived only for that.

By nodding his head, the agreement was established. Originally, something that was not supposed to exist in this world had received permission to exist in this world.

Darkness covered him.
