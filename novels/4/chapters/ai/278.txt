Episode 279

279. Amelia Airin (1)

Taesan opened his mouth.

"You'll find out soon enough."

"...Yeah. I'll find out soon enough."

Amelia controlled her emotions. The ghost approached her as if it was curious.

"This is strange. It's strong, but... it feels artificial. Like a manufactured strength?"

"You?"

Amelia's eyes shook when she saw the ghost.

"Why are you here?"

"Huh? Do I know you?"

"You weren't supposed to end at the 10th floor, were you?"

Amelia seemed to know the ghost. And when she saw that the ghost had been following Taesan all along, she was taken aback.

Taesan realized something from Amelia's reaction.

Amelia had also received a quest from the ghost.

In retrospect, it was only natural. The ghost wouldn't have passed up someone with talent recognized by the gods, like Amelia. The ghost must have given her a quest.

However, the fact that they parted ways at the 10th floor meant that Amelia hadn't received any quests after that.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I defeated the ogre and obtained the information, and it was a quest to confront the leader of the guide group."

The ghost seemed to have realized something and let out an interesting voice.

"Hmm, I had a rough idea, but this is amazing. Your counterpart was separated from me on the 10th floor, right?]

“…….”

[I understand the reason.]

The ghost laughed single-mindedly.

[I think your counterpart was judged to be unable to reach the leader, so I ended it there.]

"You."

Amelia's face distorts.

Ignoring Amelia's emotional expression, the ghost flew towards Taesan.

"This is fun. The divine energy is very strong. Is this how you're going to push me away?"

The ghost said that Amelia was judged unable to reach the leader, but that may not be the case. Amelia had enough talent to reach the depths.

However, it was likely that the ghost, who knew the true nature of the fallen god, was wary because Amelia was too close to the fallen god.

"…Hmph, whatever."

She turned her body, her movement similar to a cat's tantrum.

"We'll talk after the battle."

She closed her eyes with a sharp tongue.

Amelia has a very strong sense of pride.

But that pride is not perfect. It may seem solid, but it's a fragile pride that can easily crumble like a sandcastle. That's why the god of downfall chose her.

Taesan intended to crush it.

Oliver, who had been quietly listening to the story, tilted his head.

"Why is Amelia talking to herself and looking into the air?"

He was in hard mode. He couldn't see ghosts. To Oliver, it seemed like Amelia was muttering to herself and suddenly distorting her face.

"You don't need to worry about it."

"The alone mode has many secrets. Anyway, nice to meet you. I'm Oliver Kan, the leader of America."

He offered Taesan a handshake. Taesan extended his hand.

A strong force was felt in the firmly grasped hand.

Oliver asked with a stern face.

"Do you think we're cowards?"

Taesan knew what Oliver was asking.

The method of using brute force to make only Americans win. It was clearly a cowardly way. But Taesan shook his head.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"There must be many people who think that way. I don't think that way."

"It's only natural for anyone to use any means necessary to survive. It was obvious that Oliver, the leader of the group, would use methods that favored their own survival."

Taesan's response seemed to relax Oliver's face a little.

"That's fortunate. It's really fortunate that one of the strongest humans thinks that way."

Amelia, who had been gazing at Oliver with a betrayed expression, turned her gaze to Taesan. When Taesan looked at her, she quickly shifted her gaze away.

"Taesan."

Oliver spoke with a calm face.

"You said we wouldn't be cowardly. So... you won't think that way about what happens next either, right?"

"Whatever, I don't care."

It didn't matter anyway.

Oliver chuckled at Taesan's response.

"Good. I feel relieved to hear that. Amelia."

"Do as you please. It's not like it matters anyway."

Amelia spoke bluntly.

Taesan gazed at the remaining players. They had a mix of wariness and curiosity towards him.

And among them, the one with a yellow cloth on their arm was Amelia alone.

"There's no one like her."

"Not everyone is as strong as Amelia. Of course, they're stronger than your average hard mode player, but... they're still far from our level."

The growth potential of the alone mode was significant, but that was a story for after they had fallen to a certain extent. In the early stages, hard mode players who could cooperate and progress quickly had the advantage.

As Oliver spoke, time passed, and they all began to be summoned to the battlefield.

A vast plain stretched out before them, and a towering mountain range stood in the distance, its peaks reaching for the sky.

Far-off presences began to gather one by one, and all of them except for one surrounded the mountain.

The mountain gazed at the faces of those who appeared and muttered,

"Amelia's not here."

"She said she'd rather sit out than fight alongside us. What a proud woman. Not that we have the luxury to worry about that now."

Oliver spoke bitterly. They were fighting for their lives, and pride had no value.

"Taesan. You said it's not cowardly.

Oliver nodded. Thirty players simultaneously took out a potion from their inventory.

Ka-ching!

And threw it on the ground. A thick, poisonous gas began to spread.

[Oliver was poisoned.]

A system window notifying of the poisoning appeared with a beep. Oliver's face turned purple, and he drew his weapon.

"You've made it this far, so you must be very strong. But you must have spent a lot."

Taesan is a Korean solo player. He has been fighting his way up with Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Jun-hyuk.

It's unclear exactly how strong the two of them are. They were obscured by Taesan's presence, and no one could get a clear read on their abilities.

But even with the limited information available, it was clear that the two of them were incredibly strong, beyond what could be compared to hard mode.

Taesan had been fighting them, and Oliver suspected that Taesan must have spent a significant amount of energy to get this far."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"His speculation stemmed from the fact that Taesan had appeared last. Having fought against the two for over an hour, it was natural to assume that his physical and mental energy had been depleted to some extent.

So, he decided to use poison to deplete his remaining energy.

The poison they used was not very potent, consuming only 1 point of energy every 5 seconds.

However, Taesan's energy was currently fixed at 100. This made the situation extremely threatening.

Oliver planned to poison Taesan and flee as far as possible, slowly draining his energy. Either Taesan's energy would be depleted to 0 due to the poison, or he would be left with minimal energy and be defeated by Amelia in battle. Either way, Amelia would emerge victorious.

The poison hit Taesan. It was the moment Oliver was certain of his victory.

[Poison judgment in progress...]. [Judgment successful! Poison resistance has been activated.]

"What?"

Oliver's pupils dilated in surprise.

Despite being engulfed in poison, Taesan's face did not turn purple.

"Is this how the judgment goes? I've learned something new again."

When faced with continuous damage like poison, does the absolute protection activate first, or does the poison resistance activate first?"

Here is the translation of the text to English:

The answer was the latter. It seemed that if you tried to resist first and failed, the absolute protection would kick in.

"Can I use it?"

Taesan stored the relevant information in one corner of his mind.

"Let's finish this quickly."

"......"

[You activated Marbas's dark wave.]

* * *

One remaining energy signal. Taesan walked towards it. Soon, Amelia's figure came into view.

Amelia, looking at Taesan, opened her mouth.

"I'm strong."

Amelia said.

"I'm the strongest. Even if you've gone deeper than me, my skills are still superior!"

"Really?"

Taesan smiled coldly.

"If you think so, that's fine."

Taesan took a step closer to Amelia.

At that moment, a huge power pressed down on the battlefield.

At the same time, the system window appeared frantically.

[Forced rules are added.] [1. Taesan's shield becomes 1.] [2. Taesan's health becomes 1.] [3. Taesan's mana becomes 1.] [4. Taesan's magic becomes 1.] [5. Taesan's strength becomes 1...]

"At that moment, the system window distorted. It felt like a tremendous force was colliding and canceling each other out.

Taesan opened his status window. From his health to his magic, everything was at 1.

But his strength, agility, intelligence, and attack power remained the same as before.

Taesan gazed up at the sky for a moment and said briefly, "Thank you."

After leaving a word of gratitude to the being who had helped him from afar, Taesan approached Amelia again.

"Amelia Airin, I declare it here."

Taesan spoke with absolute truth, as if it was bound to happen.

"I won't use any skills. And I will take you down with a single blow."

Amelia's face contorted.

She gritted her teeth and drew her sword.

"Bring it on!"

[Amelia activated her anger.] [Amelia's just and rightful duel began.] [Amelia activated her highest authority.] [Amelia activated the weak blessing of the gods.]

Numerous powers surged into Amelia. Among them were skills that Taesan had not acquired."

"The skill that the God of Falling directly bestowed upon her, a skill that only Amelia can receive.

Taesan nodded his head.

"It's okay."

He was definitely stronger than Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk.

But that was all.

Taesan took another step closer to Amelia. Amelia tried to respond to Taesan's movement, gathering her determination.

She was confident.

She was strong. Even if her opponent was stronger than her, she could still counterattack and win.

In fact, the losers of the labyrinth, who were higher-level than her, couldn't block her attacks.

Taesan was no exception. He seemed to have fallen deeper, but the difference wasn't that big. She was strong enough to transcend levels. She believed so.

And she also had a skill that was worthy of that belief.

[Amelia activated the Path to Victory.]

The Path to Victory. A skill she obtained by passing the God of Falling's trial.

This skill finds a way to turn even the most desperate situations into victory."

"Even in the most extreme situations where no one could win, the path to victory always led her to triumph.

Amelia focused her mind on Taesan after activating her skill.

“…….”

And then she realized.

Taesan was approaching her with a casual attitude, with more openings than she could count.

But her mind warned her. She was certain that if she attacked the opening, she would be the one to get hit, like a prophecy.

Amelia's eyes wavered.

“Are you going to stay still?”

Taesan had already arrived right in front of her.

Sweat trickled down her cheek.

There was no answer.

He looked very relaxed, full of openings, but she couldn't attack. Taesan raised his fist.

“Try to block it.”

His fist moved, but it was very slow. Any ordinary person could easily dodge it.

[Amelia's death line was activated.]

She had to avoid it.

And counterattack to win, like she had always done before.

But it was impossible."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The path to victory, which had always been a source of confidence for her, was not working. It was as if no matter what she did, she couldn't win, even if she tried thousands or tens of thousands of times.

Amelia's mind raced with dozens of strategies, but none of them seemed to work. Every plan she came up with ended in destruction and failure.

'...Move!'

Just before the punch landed, Amelia barely managed to dodge it. She moved her body to avoid the blow, and then countered with a powerful strike.

The sword left behind dozens of afterimages.

It was a movement that surpassed her own limits, something she couldn't have achieved on her own. In a desperate situation, she had exceeded her own capabilities.

But Taesan easily corrected the trajectory of his punch.

Dozens of sword trajectories were shattered by his fist. Amelia's eyes widened in shock as she raised her sword. The punch collided with the sword.

*Crack*

The sword snapped in two. The punch broke through her defense and landed on Amelia's face.

"Rest for now."

Her consciousness ended there.
