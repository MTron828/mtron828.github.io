Chapter 199

199. The Earth on the Brink of Destruction (4)

[You have activated the Sado's form, Raki Ratis.]

The divine power infuses into the body of the mountain.

At the same time, the sado completes its shape.

There appears a human figure with a reversed robe.

It holds a massive scythe.

The sado, taking on a human form, moves the scythe.

Despite the great distance, it swung the scythe as if the mountain was standing before it. At the same time, the mountain stumbled.

Ka!

The space where the mountain was standing was torn apart. If it had remained still, its head would have fallen off.

The sado was a phantom. It had no fixed form.

Therefore, the sado changed into numerous forms and used different abilities.

It is unclear, but it seemed that the sado had absorbed the forms of numerous existence that it had trampled upon in countless worlds.

In his previous life, he was defeated by the sado's transformed form.

The mountain revealed this.
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have activated the apostate killer.] [The desire for battle has been activated.] [A fair and square duel has been activated.] [The proof of one's limit has been activated.] [You have activated the scorn of the strong.] [The theory of the opposite has been activated.] [The Giant Killer has been activated.]

Kuuuung!

He charged forward. The apostate slowly moved his sword.

Simultaneously, dozens of spaces split apart. The apostate grasped his fist, shouting "Ahahah!" as he cut off everything passing through the spaces.

Kwaaaang!

He threw a fist packed with the power of the spirit, aiming it forward. The power of the soul, contained within the punch, shattered the divided spaces and crushed them.

Kwajik.

The apostate planted his foot, creating a crater on the ground and causing it to collapse.

As the apostate approached, his appearance changed once again. The apostate, now transformed into a knight wearing a sturdy armor, drew down a sword as small as a chopstick.

The apostate swung his sword.

Kaaahah!

A heavy sensation entered the tip of the sword. The apostate twisted his wrist, and the sword changed direction.

[You have activated the flow of power.]

The sword, pressing down on the apostate, momentarily twisted.

Kagagag!

The apostate twisted the sword, drawing closer to the apostate once again. The apostate did not change his form, instead unleashing a massive sword in a storm-like manner.

He cut through the ground and air, crushing everything approaching with the power of the sword.
Here is the translation of the text:

The sword technique was as complete as a stormy scar.

Kaka!

Tae-san moved his hands roughly. He drew out the arrow, blocked the stormy sword, and slowly approached.

Puuu!

The sword was lowered by the shaman. Tae-san twisted his body instead of blocking it.

[You have activated the white rune shield.]

The white rune shield that collided with the sword broke apart instantly. The sword that was lowered struck Tae-san's armor, shattering it.

Tae-san narrowly escaped and inserted his sword into the shaman's neck.

Kaka!

The shaman's head drooped. The sword shattered the armor that wrapped around the shaman's body.

The attack failed, but Tae-san smiled wryly.

The shaman dodged his attack deliberately.

This means that if it were a normal situation, he could have given the shaman a fatal blow.

"Ah, indeed."

This type of shaman is versatile and can change in many ways. However, he has consumed a lot of energy and is relatively weak in defense.

In his previous life, he couldn't even defend against this kind of attack, but now he can.

Kaka!

Tae-san continued to wield his sword. The shaman also moved a massive sword to respond.

Kuung!
Here is the translation of the text:

The saint's physical body changed again as he pushed the Tai'an with his shoulder.

The man who had transformed into a giant with muscles punched out with his fists wrapped in gauntlets. Tai'an drew his sword.

[Your skills have been triggered.]

The trajectory of the punch suddenly wavered, but quickly corrected itself.

In the end, Tai'an had to block it with his sword.

Kaaa!

[Your first attack has been nullified.]

The repression struck Tai'an, nullifying the first attack.

Tai'an felt a sense of burden as he sensed the weight of the opponent's arrow beyond his grip, and took a step back.

As Tai'an took a step back, the saint's appearance changed again.

This time, he took on the form of a woman holding a small bow. The saint strung an arrow and grasped the bow tightly.

Kuku.

The string was tautly drawn. No matter where Tai'an moved, the bow continued to chase Tai'an.

The man with a sickle, the man with a great sword, and the muscular man and the woman with a bow.

They were all once adversaries of the saint.

And they would have lost like the previous Tai'an.

Perhaps even the previous Tai'an would have lost without the power of the Urbo's crest.

‘It's just as difficult as expected.’
Here is the translation of the text:

The apostle, who can change his appearance and abilities freely, was unable to tackle this issue in his previous life. His abilities were too unbalanced, making it impossible for him to handle various situations. However, he was able to summon dozens of abilities because of this.

But now it's different.

The mountain stopped moving.

As he stopped moving, an arrow shot out.

A very fast arrow, flying towards him at a speed that made it impossible to dodge or defend.

[You have randomly activated Blink.]

The mountain suddenly teleported next to the apostle, and the arrow flew over the horizon.

Before the apostle's form changed, the mountain inserted his sword.

[You have activated the sword of courage.]

[@#!%$@ damage.]

The apostle's body suddenly twisted.

The apostle quickly widened the distance and rapidly transformed into a savage warrior wielding a double-axe.

Kuuuung!

The axe swung wildly, with a brutal and crushing movement that shattered everything in its path.

However, this power was not that extraordinary. The mountain, who had grasped the apostle's tactics, swung his sword again.

[You have activated Whirlwind.]

You use Whirlwind repeatedly. The swinging axe blades all wobble and become distorted. The mountain then stabbed his sword deep into the apostle's abdomen once again.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the apostle's appearance changed again, this time he was an old man with a long beard.

The apostle held a staff. As a strange, ominous magical aura began to rise from it, Tai Shan immediately took out his pipe.

[The pipe that calls for silence has been activated. For 10 minutes, it prohibits the use of magic within a certain range.]

The magical aura dissipated.

Tai Shan put away his staff and pushed the apostle aside. Just as he was about to stick his sword into his neck, the apostle's appearance changed again.

He was now a small, prepubescent woman with a mysterious aura. She lay on the ground with her back against the earth, and waved her fingers.

Suddenly, shadowy figures appeared in mid-air. They rushed towards Tai Shan like flames.

Tai Shan, who had figured out the apostle's magical form, responded immediately.

[You have activated the Wind Walker.][You have activated the Small Spark.]

The wind, infused with flames, rose up. It began to trample and suppress the shadowy figures.

Magic.

Black Magic.

Magic.

Swordsmanship.

Skills.
Here is the translation of the text:

Currently, he has obtained a nearly omniscient level of ability. He can respond to any situation to the extent that he can say it.

No matter how he changed his appearance to target the weaknesses of the Taesan, he could respond to everything.

The Sado's body was pierced by the Taesan's sword.

Kukuk.

The Sado suddenly transformed into a gigantic form and pushed the Taesan away.

And again, the distorted Sado's appearance made the Taesan laugh mockingly.

"What kind of Asura nobleman are you?"

The Sado, with different forms on both sides, charged forward.

On the left side, he wielded a sword with a style of fencing, while on the right side, he wielded a rapier-like sword with a sharp blade.

The Taesan concentrated its mind.

Kaang!

With one hand, he blocked the fencing-style sword on the left side, and with the other hand, he responded to the sharp sword on the right side.

The appearance was ridiculous, but it couldn't be ignored. Since the attacks from both sides were of entirely different types, he had to use a completely different method to block them simultaneously.

Ka-kak-kak!

He couldn't block everything. The attacks were quickly neutralized, and small wounds appeared on his body.

He thought this was the Taesan's weakness, so the Sado intensified his attack even more.

The damage accumulated slowly, but the Taesan didn't seem to care.
Here is the translation of the text:

At present, he has extremely high physical strength. Unlike in his previous life, he can easily overcome a few experiments or mistakes without any issues.

He concentrates his mind entirely.

He expands his field of vision. He separates his physical movements.

Even the Tai Shan's sword, like the one wielded by the Sado, begins to show completely different movements.

Ka-a-a-a!

Tai Shan simultaneously blocks all the attacks and inserts the dual swords.

The Sado's body shook greatly. The yin and yang energy that formed his body was severely depleted.

Gurgle.

The Sado's body twisted violently.

Tai Shan instinctively realized that this transformation was the last one.

The transformed Sado had a young man's appearance.

He wore a neat armor and held a beautiful dual-handed sword.

And he wore a luxurious cloak wrapped around his body.

He looked like a hero, just like a dragon warrior.

The Sado moved his body. His speed was significantly faster than before. Tai Shan responded immediately, but couldn't stop him.

[You took 3423 damage.]

"Ugh."

Tai Shan bit his tongue and wrapped his injured area with a cloth.

He was a completely different and stronger opponent compared to the Sado who had changed before. He was an enemy that could not be defeated, even if he used everything he had.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san lifted his spiritual energy.

Ka-a-a-a!

The sword and the sword clashed. The shaman smoothly moved the sword to target Tae-san's armpit. Tae-san lowered his elbow and knocked the sword down.

Ka-ka-ka!

He swung the sword.

He activated the "Flowing Water" technique and sent the opponent's sword flying away. However, the shaman quickly adjusted his stance and blocked it.

[You have activated the Great Wave.]

The swords clashed. Tae-san, having judged that the opponent wouldn't be able to withstand the Great Wave, clenched his fist.

[You have activated El'goroth's Thorn of Roses.]

The thorns of the underworld's rose flew down from the sky.

The shaman dodged all of them and continued the battle. There were no gaps.

Therefore, Tae-san planned to create a gap.

[You have activated Marbas's Black Wave.]

Kuu-uu-uu!

The sword was swept away by the black wave. The shaman grasped the sword with both hands and lowered his stance as if praying.

Then, the shadowy figures stretched out like light and suppressed the black wave.

Tae-san didn't stop.

[You have activated the Frozen World.] [You have activated the Expansion of the Pebbles.] [You have activated the Pursuit.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"The chill has descended. Small ice fragments have formed there and are rushing towards the demon.

Kka-kka!

The demon has moved its sword to strike, but its movement was slower than before due to the cold.

Ka-aa-ang!

Tae-san did not miss the opportunity. He wielded his sword, disrupting his stance and pushing his body forward. The demon resisted, but began to be pushed back.

Ki-ee-ying.

As the demon was pushed back, a small impurity was formed on its hand.

The place felt the strength of a terrifying force.

Tae-san did not run away. Instead, he inserted his sword into the demon's chest.

The demon also responded by stabbing the impurity into Tae-san's heart.

Kwa-jik.

[You have taken 50432 damage. Your Counter has been activated. The attack that would lead to death has been invalidated. All damage for 1 second becomes 0.]

He had only 1 second left.

Tae-san twisted his sword, exerting great force and holding it firmly.

Kwa-jiji-jik!

The demon was split in two.

The impurities that had taken on the shape of humans began to collapse."
Here is the translation of the text:

"You have defeated your despair. Aphrodite will reward you by taking you back to the labyrinth."

"Your ability sword's proficiency has increased by 3%."

"Your combat endurance's proficiency has increased by 4%."

"Your Iralac's non-technical proficiency has increased by 1%."

"Your nameless index's proficiency has increased by 1%."

"Your magical proficiency has increased by 1%."

"You have demonstrated a movement that seems like your body and mind have separated, as if you are a completely different person. You have obtained the special always-on skill [Mental Separation]. Since you have escaped the labyrinth, the skill is temporarily sealed."

"Your ascension has triggered. You have obtained the special trigger skill [Branch of Curse]."

"Your ascension has triggered. The proficiency of your twisted ascension adjustment has increased by 12%."

“Ah.”

Tai-san couldn't help but laugh.

He had defeated the monster that had killed Lee Tae-yeon and led to the destruction of the Earth, and it was a clear victory.

Although it was not the real thing, but a fake, the monster's power was still lacking, but it was a clear victory.

If Tai-san continued to grow stronger and stronger, he would be able to defeat the real thing as well.

That was the reason he had gone back in time.

Tai-san turned his body back to the city.

There, Lee Tae-yeon was staring at him with a blank expression.
