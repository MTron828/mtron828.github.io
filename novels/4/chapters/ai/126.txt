Chapter 127

127. B-grade Monster (4)

"Ah, ahah?"

Kim Hwi-yeon, who was in a state of shock, was startled for a different reason. It wasn't just her, but the people who had fallen and those who were struggling to get up were all the same.

A tremendous power began to envelop their bodies. Kim Hwi-yeon looked at her fist with widened eyes.

Crack!

She clenched her fist. The power coursing through her arm. The scale of it. And the ways to deliver power more efficiently.

Everything flashed through her mind. Countless methods she had never known or even sensed suddenly burst forth like fireworks.

"What's this?"

Middle-Grade, who was also sensing something similar, was the same.

"Stat, leveling up? ...That's not the concept. This is...".

Kim Hwi-yeon swallowed her saliva.

This was talent.

Inborn power that had been innate in their bodies was manifesting itself.

And so was the same for Taesan. He let out a sigh as he felt the power coursing through his body.

"Ah, how wonderful."

Taesan quickly threw a punch. A loud sound echoed through the air, like the cracking of a whip.
Here is the translation of the text:

With a series of movements, extending, pulling, and retracting, the process was much faster and more accurate than ever before.

"Is it your... strength?"

[I have obtained the blessing of the gods [the talent of struggle and death]. It is a blessing given only to a tiny minority of those who trust and follow me. Be grateful and respectful. Mortals.]

Rakiratas boasted proudly, and Tai Shan couldn't counterargue.

Pffft.

He clenched his fist. His senses changed. It wasn't just that he got faster or stronger, but a fundamental part of him had changed.

'Talent.'

A power that can't be obtained through external means, but is possessed from the very beginning. It was a feeling of having obtained it.

'Is this power...'

It can make me stronger. Not just stronger now, but a power that has the potential for growth.

He was amazed. He was thrilled. And that was not the end.

"Is this not just for me, but for all surviving humanity?"

[Yes. Originally, this power was not meant for you insignificant ones, but it's become interesting, I suppose.]

Rakiratas muttered to himself, but Tai Shan was so astonished that he couldn't even respond.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This level of power was granted to all humanity, and this was not a small matter. In some cases, even players in easy mode could become twice as strong as before.

It's a happy event, but there was something that didn't make sense.

"Why is this so?"

Rakirata said, "I am a god. As long as I don't acknowledge someone, I will scorn them and give them nothing."

But he granted power to all humanity. At least, this was not what Taesan had expected.

Rakirata said calmly:

"It's a contract. It's also a trade. I won't be bad-minded, so you can infer it."

Taesan remained silent, his head bowed. He would soon know the answer.

"Is this related to monsters and nobles?"

[It's correct.]

The energy emanating from the throne shook. It was as if a joyful turmoil had erupted.

[They were trying to cross the line, so we made a contract.]

"...B-grade monster."

At least, it wasn't a monster that could appear now. If it were possible, it would have been released in the previous world.

But that wasn't the case, and there was something special about this time.

"You have responded to our expectations very well. Don't praise us. Mortals..."]

"...""
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan gazed at the throne. Rakirata's tone was as if he had witnessed their entire battle.

As Rakirata's gaze fell, he spoke.

"Don't misunderstand. You're mortal. We're not your enemies, at least not yet."

"What's going on?"

I need information. Why did Rakirata come to this place?

Rakirata fell silent, deep in thought.

"If you were the one now, it wouldn't matter. We created a labyrinth. We want to see the great hero and warrior's struggle. But our gods didn't approve of it."

"That's why the world was crumbling."

According to the god's words, 258 worlds were destroyed by the gods' hands.

It would be very unpleasant for the gods who took up residence in the labyrinth. Rakirata's voice was mixed with annoyance.

"Are you just going to admit defeat and go crazy? Those disgusting ones are tearing apart the worlds that could possibly enter the labyrinth and trampling them. Did we think we could just watch them do that? "

"So you summoned us?"

The people of the world that was about to perish, were summoned to the labyrinth because they were worried about the possibility of them entering the labyrinth.
Here is the translation of the text:

As expected, the shock was not great. There was only a feeling of "this is really the case".

[However, there is a question.]

The ghost who had been quietly standing suddenly opened its mouth.

[May I dare to ask a question? Great existence, yes.]

[Ratata's gaze was directed at the ghost. Just that made the ghost's body tremble nervously, starting to vibrate like a TV with noise.]

[Don't be bold enough to make a statement without looking at my courage. Speak, you are dead.]

[...Thank you.]

The ghost swallowed its saliva and opened its mouth.

[Even if you are saying that, it's difficult to summon all the humans in this world. Originally, it was not like that. But it was intervened and created a hole. Thanks to that, the conversation became easier.] [Anyway... it happened like that.] [I didn't want to make a statement for such a meaningless story. Keep talking.]

According to my understanding, most people here did not enter the labyrinth. They entered a different place that imitated the labyrinth instead.]

The Taishan understood what the ghost was trying to say.
Here is the translation of the text:

Ah, normal, hard mode, and so on. Humans on Earth have been divided into countless modes. In the past, they thought it was natural, but as they entered the solo mode, their thoughts changed.

In reality, there was only one solo mode, and the others were all fake.

The ghost was asking about that.

[Originally, you all would have entered our world. But it was annoying because they interfered. A rift appeared, and the dimension was distorted.]

The interference of the gods.

That was how the mode was separated.

[So, in the past, I was quite annoyed, but... at least this time, it's not.]

Rakirata said with a joyful voice.

Her gaze was directed at Tai Shan.

[That's all. If you want to know something, come find me yourself. I'll be waiting in the depths.]

"I understand."

Tai Shan replied, but Rakirata did not disappear. The throne was still on the ground.

"What's going on?"

Tai Shan was momentarily taken aback when Rakirata spoke.

[Eternal one. Become my apostle.]

* * *

"That proposal was rejected in the past, you know."

When Rakirata received strengthened trials at the altar, God had proposed a covenant to him in the past.
Here is the translation of the text:

Lakiratasu is a capricious god and doesn't think about being bound to anyone, so Tai Shan refused.

[At that time, it was like that. But the situation has changed. The nobles are defeated, but they are not strong enough to be managed by a mortal. The bandits are also plotting against you. And I don't want to be reduced to nothing, unable to even have a name.]

Lakiratasu said proudly, like a god.

"[I will grant you the glory of being able to protect my side. Accept it, mortal. A mortal like you.] [Hmph.]"

The ghost was startled and took a breath.

That reaction was a concern, but the priority was to respond first.

"I understand your answer."

There was no thought of being bound to the god. Moreover, one of his goals was to become stronger alongside the gods. If he became a disciple, the possibility of having a limit set was high.

[Hmph. That's right. I knew I would refuse. If I had accepted it, you would have been reckless as an infant.]

Lakiratasu muttered to himself, as if he didn't expect much.

[But it was still fun. I'm looking forward to your spirit.]

Lakiratasu's power began to dwindle slowly. The throne started to sink back into the ground.

[Ah, that's right.]

Lakiratasu suddenly exclaimed, as if he had just remembered something.
Note: The text appears to be a conversation between Lakiratasu, a god, and Tai Shan, a mortal. The conversation is about Lakiratasu's proposal to make Tai Shan his disciple, but Tai Shan refuses, citing his own limitations and the potential risks of becoming a disciple.
Here is the translation of the text:

You have won against the tool of the demon. It was a surprising event. I am fully satisfied with the result. Therefore, I will give you a gift.

The power separated from the throne and was bestowed upon Taesan.

[You have obtained the special skill [Sadoha [Raki Ratas]]]. Please go back to the labyrinth and confirm it. It may be a great help to your plan.]

Taesan laughed at the ominous words.

"Did you know?"

[No, but I'm happy anyway. You can use my name too.]

"Thank you."

Taesan nodded his head. If I receive the permission of Raki Ratas after drinking, there's nothing to be afraid of.

[Let's look forward to a more joyful appearance. Mortal.]

And Raki Ratas disappeared. I couldn't feel his existence anymore.

[Huh!]

The ghost barely held back his breath.

[Even just thinking about it makes me feel like I'm going to die.]

"Why did you open your mouth?"

[Did you open it because I wanted you to? You're curious about what I said, aren't you.]

The ghost muttered. He was definitely grateful for the information he had spoken.

"It's because of the interference of the gods' will."

Here is the translation of the text:

Eiji and Normal, Hard Mode. I don't know the details, but it seems that all the difficulties were created by the gods. At least, the gods of the labyrinth didn't seem to want that.

The ghost murmured in a tone of awe.

[Well, isn't it funny? Does Rakirata suggest that a mortal take the position of guarding his side?]

"What kind of position is that?"

[It means exactly what it says. You'll be responsible for one of God's fingers. It's a kind of divine entity, beyond mere trivialities.]

"Then you'll become a god?"

[Similar, right?]

The ghost's words were mixed with humor, but he replied seriously.

The mountain-like being was taken aback.

"Really, a god?"

[While it's not a complete position, I've certainly broken free from the fetters of mortality. That's what's funny. According to what I know, Rakirata's finger has only been born three times, and that's given to an adventurer who has not yet reached the 50th floor, right?]

"God."

You become an immortal being. I was shocked, but I still didn't think it was something to be accepted.

"Then I'll go back."

The mountain-like being returned to the battlefield. There, people were filled with confusion, looking at their bodies and clenching their fists.
Here is the translation of the text:

Taisan, who had been searching for a clue, suddenly appeared with a surprising expression.

"It looks like half of them survived."

I had expected around 20% to 30% to survive, but the actual number was much higher.

"What kind of nonsense is this?"

"Ah, Taisan!"

Kim Hwi-yeon's face turned pale with shock.

"What's going on with this... something seems to have taken hold of our bodies..."

"Let's settle things first."

The blessing of the gods didn't disappear. We can confirm it by returning to the labyrinth.

But there was something we needed to do. Kim Hwi-yeon nodded glumly, her face downcast.

* * *

Two days had passed. After leaving the day before, the settlement finally ended. Half of the people had died, with most of them being in easy or normal mode.

Hard mode players also didn't have a small number of dead, but they managed to survive by repeating the pattern of striking and retreating, so at least minimal sacrifices were made.

Everyone was gloomy. With half of them dying in the expected easy return, it was inevitable that they would be devastated.

But they didn't collapse.
Here is the translation of the text:

Now that they have gone through many hardships to the point of being buried in death, those who survived are paying homage to the dead and discussing the strength they have each gained, and starting to debate. Taesan also adjusted its movement by training with Iteyan, Kang Junhyeok, and Sulryeon.

The blessing of Rakiratas. The talent for struggle and death.

[Divine Blessing: Talent for Struggle and Death] [One can acquire all talents related to struggle and death.]

It was a simple explanation, but its effect was astonishing.
