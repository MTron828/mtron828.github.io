Episode 77

77. 13th Floor, Guide of Wickedness (4)

A massive round table. This is the conference room of the Guide of Wickedness. Seated there is a woman.

Her fiery red hair. It wasn't a metaphor; it was actually burning. Flames flickered, illuminating the room brightly.

The woman absentmindedly tapped the table with her fingers.

Creak.

The door opened, and a puzzled voice echoed.

"What's this? Only an old lady here?"

A middle-aged man, brushing dust off his clothes, settles into a chair. Glancing at the man with a smirk that seemed out of place, the woman said,

"You've come. Young one."

"Hey, I'm old enough to be called mature, at least?"

"Compared to me, you're still a young soul."

"Who wouldn't seem young compared to an old lady like you?"

The man grumbled dismissively.
The woman with burning hair. Her identity is that of a fire spirit. Spirits are natural beings that exist from the birth of stars until the flames disappear from the stars. Compared to such a woman, the man, who had not yet lived for even a hundred years, was like a fetus.

The man lay down on the table.

"What about the others? Where did those who were always making noise here go?"

"They're busy conquering the 74th floor."

"Is that so?"

The man's eyes sparkled.

"How do you think it will go?"

"I think they'll fail again this time."

Disappointment flashed across the man's face.

"Well, it's not surprising. Is it a lack of strength or a lack of qualifications..."

For a very long time, they had been unable to pass through the 74th floor. The woman spoke softly.

"It could be both. We are lacking something."

"Tsk."

The man frowned.

"What about those above? The child of the demon clan is still only third rank, but isn't he worth considering?"

"He has talent. He has skill, and he is objective about himself. But reaching our level is another issue altogether."

Even those who have everything must invest decades to barely reach depth.

Leaning his chin on the table, the man muttered,

"Should we turn our attention elsewhere altogether?"

"Are you talking about those who are awake?"
Adventurers not affiliated with the guides of sin. They are few but certainly exist. The leaders of the guides of sin called them the awakened.

The woman chuckled softly.

"Ainzhar. Are you thinking of calling him?"

"Ah, that old man irritates me, so don't even mention him."

The man grimaced deeply.

A few days ago, Ainzhar passed by them. He seemed to take pleasure in knocking them down one by one and casting scornful glances.

"I had wondered, but they truly are worthless."

That's what Ainzhar said to the man.

"Why did he suddenly descend?"

"I don't know. Perhaps he found his purpose."

The woman remarked calmly.

"In any case, it's unfortunate. They won't be able to pass the 74th floor for decades like this."

"Ugh..."

The man groaned.

"Shouldn't have killed the hero..."

"No."

The woman shook her head in denial.

"Do you think he would listen to us?"

"I doubt it."

The man replied succinctly, not entirely serious. After a moment of thought, he spoke again.

"By the way, there was trouble in the second rank. Did you know?"

"The second rank? I don't know. I don't care either."
"If they're from the second rank, they're weak beings allowed only up to the 20th floor. The woman who surpassed the 70th floor wouldn't care."

"Adventurers have arrived."

"Are they rookies after a long time?"

"I heard one from the second rank died there. Did someone worthwhile come?"

"Oh?"

The woman's eyes flickered with slight interest.

"Did a mid-level 10th floor adventurer defeat someone from the second rank?"

"I don't know the details, but it seems likely, right?"

"Not bad."

"But they rejected us."

Anyone who rejects the offer is killed. That was the law of the guides of sin.

"Unfortunately... there's no other way."

"There are only two of us. Shall we decide among ourselves?"

Meetings are held with all the leaders gathering. The woman spoke lazily.

"It's just a second rank incident at most. There's no need to gather everyone."

"That's true."

The man nodded.

"Then let's issue a wanted notice for now. Instruct the second rank to take care of it themselves."

Casual words.

Those words climbed higher and higher, reaching even those in the second rank.

* * *

"What are we going to do?"
Adventurers from the second rank gathered and murmured among themselves. Those in their twenties exchanged stories with faces filled with both anxiety and anticipation.

"Should we kill him?"

"But he's the one who defeated Levevas. Shouldn't we be cautious?"

"Hmph!"

A man with gray hair, larger than others like a beast, snorted.

"He's weakened! That's why he's dead!"

"Well..."

A woman with long black hair muttered.

"He might have been stronger than you? In skill and strength."

"What?"

The beast-like man twisted his face.

"How dare you say such things, you lowly creature?"

"I know you're born noble and arrogant, but still, you should know your place. Barely comparable to us beasts, how dare you mock us like this?"

The woman chuckled mockingly at the man. Their relationship was far from amicable. Especially between the woman and the beast-like man, others were familiar with their tense exchanges.

The beast-like man curled his lips.

"Come to think of it, you were always hanging around Levevas. It's quite pathetic to see lowly beings sticking together."

"...Are you suggesting something?"
Life presses hard. The man stands his ground, unyielding.

A young man, pressing his forehead as if in pain, sighs heavily.

"That's enough."

A soft voice rings out. The beast-like man sharpens his gaze but slowly relaxes his grip. The woman also furrows her brow but reins in her strength.

They are all adventurers of the second rank, somewhat similar yet each uniquely strong. The young man with a noble air embodies such strength.

"We're all at the bottom together, might as well get along."

The young man smiles wryly.

"Doesn't seem like anyone's willing to compromise."

"Of course not!"

The beast-like man declares.

"The leadership has issued a direct warrant! With success, we could even ascend to the third rank. Who would compromise now?"

They strive to become stronger. Initially accepting the proposal out of despair in the labyrinth's strength, time has faded that fear.

Moreover, they were once hailed as geniuses from the outside. Forced to halt at the second rank by leadership, they had never been satisfied at the bottom.

"So it's the same as always."


The young man takes out a 36-sided die from his pouch.

"The one with the highest number gets priority. Does everyone agree?"

Twenty heads nod in agreement. One by one, they start rolling the dice.

Clatter.

And finally, the number 36 is revealed.

"It's your turn first. Aldoarta."

The beast-like man, Aldoarta, bares his teeth.

* * *

While they deliberate, Taesan descends deeper into the labyrinth.

Not much changes. As always, he seeks out secret rooms for rewards.

[Deep Sea Fang: Earring] [Defense +8] [A necklace made by subduing creatures living in the deep sea. It emits a faint odor.]

"All sorts of star items."

Despite the odor, the high defense makes it worth changing. He removes his previous earring and wears the Deep Sea Fang, which increases his defense by 8, though it costs him 5 strength.

"I'm starting to want to learn new skills."

Taesan muses, tapping his fingers.
He had learned numerous skills so far, around fifty including magic. Considering that Taeyeon had 50 when clearing alone mode, it was an incredibly large number.

However, there were still many skills he hadn't acquired yet.

Among them were several main skills.

"Even though multiplication is impossible, I want to gain addition or essential strikes, or even absolute judgment......"

The ghost muttered as if incredulous.

["You think you can gain more here?"]

"Because it's possible."

The conditions for acquiring powerful skills were also very demanding. So Taesan planned to go down at least to the 40th floor before acquiring them.

However, contrary to Taesan's expectations, the increase in stats was tremendous. Not only that, but the items and consumables visible in the store were also things that weren't easily obtainable.

"It's impossible right now anyway."

There were many conditions to meet, and few were fulfilled. But now he could prepare sufficiently.

Only the boss remained now. Taesan encountered the boss.

["A zombie legion has appeared."]

"Woaaaaah."

The boss was not just one but a group of hundreds of zombies. It was impossible to deal with such a large number head-on. Perhaps the designer intended to annihilate them using traps or fire and the like.
"Annoying."

Taesan sighed deeply.

He swung his dual swords, deflecting dozens of reaching hands aimed at him. Limbs of zombies were severed and scattered around.

Thirty minutes later, Taesan succeeded in clearing the stage.

"[You have defeated the zombie legion.]" "[Your level has increased.]" "[You have defeated the boss of the 13th floor. Basic reward: [Ring of Severing].]" "[You have identified the hidden element of the 13th floor. Reward: [???].]"

Taesan was about to confirm his rewards.

"Hahaha!"

A loud laughter echoed. Taesan grimaced at the ringing sound assaulting his ears.

A figure appeared on the stairs leading to the 14th floor.

"So, you're the one who defeated Lebevas!"

"And what if I did?"

"Then I'll have to kill you!"

Aldoata glared at Taesan with madness in his eyes, swirling his club.

Thud!

With a resounding crash, Aldoata's body disappeared. As he crashed into the wall and descended towards Taesan, Aldoata thought to himself,

"Even if you're strong, it's just the 13th floor!"
There exists a world of difference between the 20th floor and the heavens and the earth. Lebevas lost, but that was because Lebevas became overly complacent, not because he was overpowered.

Aldoata swung his fist with his knuckles clenched like a hammer.

Taesan mocked him with an annoyed expression.

In an instant, the fist disappeared.

Crunch.

Aldoata's face crumpled and flew away. Taesan looked down at Aldoata squirming on the ground and asked indifferently,

"What's this one now?"

[Um... hold on a moment.]

The ghost hesitated as it recalled memories.

"There was probably a noisy guy named Aldoata. He's not particularly remarkable."

"Is he related to the Guide of Sin?"

[I thought it would take two days to ignore him as a second place.]

"He, uh..."

Aldoata, who barely regained consciousness, staggered to his feet.

What just happened? Aldoata didn't know. The moment he thought the opponent's fist was shaking, his memory disappeared.

"You!"

He suffered something cowardly. Aldoata, with a flushed face, flew towards Taesan. Taesan lethargically swung his fist again. Aldoata crumpled up and flew away again.

"This, this..."

"Stupider than Lebevas. Weaker, too."
Here's the translation of the text into English:

Aldoata's face contorted deeply under Taesan's scornful gaze.

"Only made it to the 13th floor and dares to laugh at me? Comparing noble-born me to the likes of lowly Lebevas!"

"How dare you! Such a base creature!"

With anger, Aldoata's body swells up. His clothes tear apart as hair grows all over his body.

"Oh?"

Taesan's eyes spark with interest. Despite Aldoata being ridiculously large, he transforms from a human form into a werewolf.

"A werewolf? You can transform like that?"

Taesan had never seen anything like it before. Not a monster, yet taking on the appearance of one, Aldoata's overall strength had noticeably increased.

"Base creature..."

Aldoata grits his teeth. While transforming into a werewolf carried considerable risks and was not used often, it was necessary against opponents he couldn't defeat otherwise.

"I admit it. But that ends here!"

The werewolf Aldoata charges forward. Faster than before, his claws slice through the air, aiming for Taesan's head.

Taesan's fist trembles.

Crunch.

Aldoata's chest caves in. This time, he doesn't fly away. He doubles over, coughing up blood.
"Though I sped up a little, is this the end?"

As Taesan's fist descends, Aldoata's consciousness fades away.
