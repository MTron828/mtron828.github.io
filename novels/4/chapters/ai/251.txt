Chapter 252

252. The Underworld (1)

Taesan realized the reason why the god of the underworld was looking at him with an uncomfortable face.

[It's a powerful force, and it's really annoying that you're handling it... but you can understand it now. It's because it's now your strength. And it's no longer possible to interfere with it.]

The god of the underworld twirled his hair with his fingers.

[No, I should be praised instead. Thanks to you, one of the gods will not be able to appear here for a while. But... that's different.]

The god of the underworld's eyes narrowed.

He glanced at Taesan's internal state.

[Gray. A power that transcends boundaries. What does it mean?]

Taesan shook his head. He knew that he could interfere with the god's power, but he didn't know anything beyond that.

[It's a power that can distort the laws. And it's also possible to interfere with what's beyond the laws. That is, it depends on how you handle it, and it can be beneficial or detrimental to us.]

On the contrary, the gray power could be beneficial to the god of the underworld.

Taesan's face scrunched up at these words.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Is that so?"

[Meaning that you can go either way, regardless of which side you're on. I wish I could seal it away, don't you think? But it's not possible.]

"It's not okay."

The Taesan said that sharply.

The boundary is the power of the individual who has not grasped the system of the labyrinth. I didn't think of getting rid of a precious card as a burden.

The demon also ended his serious words at the point of murmuring.

[Oh, I respect your opinion. Be careful with it.]

"Can I seal my own power?"

[Even gods were banished, but what can't be done? The only thing is that the consumption of power is quite significant. As long as you receive protection from the labyrinth's system, it's possible with your consent. It's unlikely that another god will seal your power, so you don't have to worry about it.]

Barakza was watching the conversation between the two of them silently. Barakza couldn't easily accept the current situation.

Barakza is an old spirit. Although there aren't many, he has been involved in several events related to transcendent beings.
Here is the translation of the text:

Since I knew what an Overlord was, I was not surprised to see the Demon Lord standing before me. It was a God. A being that ordinary mortals could not even gaze upon its true form.

The words of the Overlord were law to mortals, and whatever they desired would inevitably be fulfilled.

There was no room for the considerations or opinions of mortals in this. The rules were enforced strictly, and mortals had no choice but to be swept away by them.

To the Overlord, mortals were like a mere wave on the surface of the ocean, insignificant and powerless.

But now, the Demon Lord was taking my opinion into consideration and bending its will to mine.

It even went so far as to say that it would listen to my requests with great care.

The fact that this was so confused the Barakan.

Ignoring the confusion of the Barakan, the Demon Lord continued to speak.

[Do you think you know why I came?]

The Taesan nodded its head.

The Demon Lord said that the time had come. It was time for me to receive something equivalent to a mid-level magic. The time had come for me to receive something.

The Demon Lord opened its mouth.

[I will bestow a new dark magic upon you. Of course, there is a condition. I will impose one trial upon you.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"What is this?"

[I've been very busy lately. That's the truth.]

"That's right."

When Taesan offered sacrifices to the gods, his appearance would always manifest. However, recently, he only brought the sacrifices without appearing himself.

It seemed that this was due to the gods' circumstances.

[My reason for being busy is because of the things you also know.]

"Are you aware of the high-ranking gods?"

[Yes. Recently, I've been entangled in them excessively. I'm struggling to stop them. This ordeal I'm about to send down to you is also related to those ordeals.]

"It seems that the recent ordeals are mostly related to that side."

The gods of magic, the gods of spirits, and the ordeals of the gods were all connected to the high-ranking gods.

[I'm helpless. You're involved in it, and it's starting to move on its own. That means the power you possess is unexpected for them.]

Taesan stretched out his hand.

The labyrinth expanded. The distance between them increased, and dark space was born. Walls flew away far into the distance, creating a dark and gloomy space.

[I am Taesan. A god of the demon clan.]

A black spherical object appears on Taesan's hand.
Here is the translation of the text:

A dark and profound darkness was there.

[Hell is the world of demons. I am ruling this place, but... there exist beings who defy my will.]

The demon sneered with a face mixed with annoyance.

[The demons who believe in the old demon that was banished to the other side after I became a demon. Can you take care of them?] [Start sub-quest] [Lucifer, the demon, wants to clean up the demons who believe in the old demon that was banished from hell.] [Conditions: Clean up the old demons that exist in hell.] [Reward: The demon will decide according to your achievements.]

"Old demon......"

[Those who were beyond the era from the beginning. They are called High Beings. The old demon is the same. He was a demon from the beginning. Although he has been banished to the past and has disappeared, there are still those who worship him.]

Tai Shan read the quest window and asked:

"Is the demon directly guarding hell? Can the demon not take care of it?"
Here is the translation of the text:

[Originally, it was impossible. The ancient demon was banished from the underworld and lost a lot of its influence. It's not even the demon itself, but rather the problem lies with those who worship it.]

The demon smiled wryly.

[But it's impossible. I and those who have directly received my power cannot interfere with the ancient demon and the existence that is involved in it. If they collide, a problem will arise.]

"What kind of problem are you talking about?"

[Hmm.]

The demon seemed to be thinking for a moment before snapping his fingers.

At the same time, the ghost and Barkaraga disappeared.

[Don't be surprised. I just temporarily excluded them. It's a story that's a bit too complicated for them to understand.]

The demon scratched his cheek.

[The ancient demon was literally a god of the devil clan, and the underworld itself was a place created by its power.]

The demon spoke in a small voice like an old man telling an old story.

[The devil clan wanted to banish the brutal ancient demon. So, they forcibly made a young and small child into a vessel for the demon.]

A young and small child.

Tae-san looked at the demon.

He had a black-haired, childlike face that was not yet fully grown.

Here is the translation of the text:

[However, I was not mentally complete enough, and problems arose. I couldn't completely exclude the power of the ancient demon that had spread throughout the underworld. Its remnants still remained. The moment I directly got involved with it, part of the underworld would collapse.]

"That's why I'm here."

[You haven't received my power directly, after all.]

Tae-san could handle black magic, but she was not a demon's apostle. She was excluded from the target she mentioned.

[I wanted to escape from the old demon and become a demon myself, but now I don't believe in myself and believe in the old demon directly, and refuse my will and hide, and others are born. It's quite ridiculous.]

The demon grumbled.

[So, will you accept it?]

"Yes."

Tae-san nodded.

The demon smiled satisfactorily and snapped her fingers again. Barkaza and the ghost who had been exiled returned.

["Lord, lord?" [......I will say it first and be banished, thank you.] [I'm bothered.]]

The demon answered the ghost's discontent and opened a space.

A dark, misty corridor appeared.

[You can go that way.]

"Do you have any information?"

Where to go and who they are. It was impossible to go without knowing anything.

The demon replied.
Here is the translation of the text:

[As you enter through the corridor, you'll find your allies waiting for you. Ask them for an answer, and you'll be fine.]

"I understand."

Tai Shan inserted his body into the corridor.

A dark and dense aura jumped through space, drawing Tai Shan to the underworld.

Thud.

Tai Shan stepped onto the ground with his feet.

For the first time, Tai Shan felt a sense of darkness.

It wasn't just the absence of light. The entire atmosphere was thick and oppressive.

It was the opposite of the magnificent world of spirits, which shone brightly.

He looked up at the sky. There was something similar to the sun, but its color was as dark as the sun during an eclipse.

This was the underworld.

* * *

[As a spirit, I'm entering the underworld for the first time. I'll often have a different experience when I'm with the master.]

Barakaza smiled slightly. It wasn't an unsatisfied smile, but rather a satisfied expression.

"Barakaza. I'm sorry, but I have to go in."

This is the underworld. I don't know what kind of reaction the spirits will have.

Barakaza seemed to understand.

[There's no choice. If the battle is about to start, I'll call you.]

Here is the translation of the text:

Barkaja revealed itself.

The Great Mountain surrounded its vicinity.

A small village appeared. The buildings' appearance was not much different from those of the medieval era.

The Great Mountain walked towards the village.

He said that there was a demon assistant.

As I entered the village, I saw people who looked like demons.

I had seen demons before. In the Abyss and in the Labyrinth, I had seen them many times.

Their appearance was not much different from that of humans. Except for the aura they emitted, they were the same.

The villagers saw the Great Mountain and bowed their heads in respect.

The Great Mountain also bowed his head in response.

[You must have realized that I'm not a demon, but I won't be hostile. Did the demon tell you beforehand?]

As I entered the village, I saw more and more demons.

And they were all old.

Even the ones who looked difficult to deal with seemed to be over seventy years old.

"Is it a nursing home? Why were we sent here?"

The Great Mountain muttered to himself as he entered the village.
Here is the translation of the text:

As I was walking, I could feel a strong energy wave coming from inside.

Taesan's face had changed.

It was really strong.

I had a level of strength that could produce significant results even inside the labyrinth.

And the energy wave felt somehow familiar. Taesan realized who the ally that the Master had spoken of was.

"'Is that the person the Master spoke of?' I thought, 'but they're much stronger than I expected. Maybe it's...the one from the labyrinth...'

As the demon approached Taesan's face, it was taken aback.

'...what?'

'...where did they go? And here they are.'

Taesan fought many demons in the labyrinth.

And among them, the one that was most memorable was the Quaneder demon, whom he fought on the 40th floor.

He was strong, but inexperienced. Therefore, he made a contract with a guide and bound his soul to Petricia.

Taesan broke the contract through his ascension to the spiritual realm.

The soul was freed, and Quaneder was about to die, but the Master took him away.

And now he is standing in front of Taesan.

'...hello?'

Quaneder greeted with a vacant expression.

'* * *

Ah, thinking about it, it's only natural. If the Master commissions a labyrinth adventurer, there's no one else but you.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

Quanede scratched his face. The last wound he saw on the devil-like being who looked evil was not visible.

"...... shall we go in first?"

He pointed to a building that looked like a cathedral with a gesture.

Since they had nothing to talk about, Taesan nodded his head.

Quanede led Taesan into the cathedral and guided him to a study. He followed behind, speaking.

"I didn't even get to say thank you because I was out of my mind back then. I'm grateful."

Quanede was a savior to Taesan.

He was bound to his soul by Petricia's contract. If he had stayed that way, he would have lived as a slave to the guidance spirits even after death.

Taesan had solved that problem.

"I'm able to live here because of that."

"Have you given up on the labyrinth?"

"I haven't given up, but I've failed once."

Quanede handed Taesan a glass.

As he said, Quanede had failed. He should have died long ago, but he had lived thanks to many blessings and good luck.

"It's not so bad just living like this. Even God doesn't seem to be encouraging me to go back. Just living like this is not so bad."

He opened his mouth with a sigh and a nod.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is a village that takes care of demonic beings who cannot live alone as they age. I'm having fun doing various things with the princess, and I also feel a sense of accomplishment.

"Princess?"

"Yes, the princess. Ah, the princess from the demon world isn't it? She's from another world. She'll be arriving soon."

A demonic being flashed through Taesan's mind.

The door to the office room opened.

"Quenad? The guest mentioned by the Lord of the Demon has arrived?"

"Yes, the princess."

"Don't call her princess. Hello...".

The girl's face stiffened as she bowed her head.

A ghostly voice echoed.

[This is how it's going. Did the Lord of the Demon plan this?]

Taesan opened his mouth.

"It's been a long time, Arnetsha."

The first time Taesan received the Lord of the Demon's trial, he was sent to a world that was about to be destroyed.

The quest he received there was to protect the princess of the demonic beings.

The princess of the doomed world, Arnetsha.

She was standing in front of Taesan now.
