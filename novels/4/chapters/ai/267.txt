Chapter 268

268. The Sword and Shield of the Spirit King (2)

[Uggghhh!]

A scream that seemed to tear the air rang out.

It was the first scream that Ha San had let out in hundreds of years. His body exploded and crashed into the wall.

Kugugugugugung......

A sound like the collapse of a labyrinth rang out. Of course, not a single scratch appeared on the walls of the labyrinth. Only Ainzhaar's attack could barely scratch the walls, so it was impossible for Taesan to do so.

But it was strong.

It was an overwhelming power. The ghost let out a dry laugh.

[Thirty thousand... I can't even see the damage.]

Taesan's attack power had already reached the deepest level due to the Irak skill. And with the addition of an absurd skill, even the ghost who had reached the deepest level couldn't help but take damage.

But Taesan had an unsatisfied expression.

"It's lower than expected."

[Lower? This?]

"If it were normal, the damage would have reached 80,000."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Naberius's golden sword's basic attack power was around 10,000. Add to that the damage tripled by the fierce blade, and it's a total of 30,000. And then, he unleashed a powerful strike.

Including the additional damage to the spirit, it could have reached 100,000, but it stopped at 40,000.

The reason was easy to guess.

"As expected, it's a matter of endurance."

The absolute judgment ignored the opponent's defense and defense skills, and piercing through it was a fundamental attack. In the end, he had to learn to pierce through the fundamentals to deal perfect damage.

Still, it was a considerable amount of damage. No, it was an amount of damage that couldn't be described as considerable. In simple numerical terms, it meant that even Taeyeon could be defeated with this one blow.

[Thud. Thud.]

And Hasan stumbled and fell.

Taesan was surprised.

"Are you not dead?"

40,000 damage. It was an amount of damage that a player who hadn't even reached the mid-level of the game's depth couldn't withstand. But Hasan, despite appearing to be on the verge of death, didn't die.

[The opponent is a spirit, so the system checks the race too. The basic stamina is much higher than humans, and the increase rate is also high. And that guy is a shield, after all.]"

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The shield that protects the king from external pressure. His physical strength is also unprecedentedly high, unmatched by anyone else.

[Ugh... ugh...]

But the situation was far from favorable. He struggled to get up, stumbling.

Taesan struck his foot.

Hasan gritted his teeth and wielded his weapon.

Keeeing!

[Hasan unleashed his Golden Destruction.]

A golden sphere engulfed the space.

Taesan clicked his tongue and retreated again.

'As expected, it's troublesome.'

He attacked the shield, but as long as that sword was present, it didn't seem like he could easily knock it down.

[Ah... ah...].

Hasan barely regained his composure and trembled.

He was terrified.

He felt the fear of death at the moment the blade struck, the same overwhelming fear he had felt when he first stepped into the depths.

[Ah...].

And the fear confirmed one fact to Hasan.

This guy is dangerous.

His sword can reach the king.

[No...].

He is the shield that protects the king.

He had to protect the king, even if it meant sacrificing his own life.

As his body, which had been trembling with fear, steadied, his gaze filled with determination turned to Taesan."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Hasan activated the Spirit Amplification.] [Hasan activated the twisted dragon's armor.]

* * *

Oooooh.

A massive power descended upon Hasan's body.

It was a flame that burned with a life of its own.

And the armor began to melt away. The golden armor permeated Hasan's entire body, becoming a part of him.

Hasan grew about twice as large.

And his strength increased proportionally.

Hasan grasped his shield. Taesan clicked his tongue.

He seemed to be denying reality, clinging to his shield, but he didn't seem foolish enough to do so.

[Spirit Amplification. I'll definitely kill you this time.]

"The armor was also a profound thing."

As the armor melted away, its power settled into Hasan. It seemed to have been absorbed completely, rendering Taesan's defense useless.

The amplified spirit's power and strength were being consumed at an alarming rate.

It seemed to be in a state of frenzy. The enlarged Hasan moved his body.

Kugugugugug!

Just moving caused a massive shockwave that shook the room violently.

If it weren't for the absolute protection, the attack would have been nullified just by the shockwave. Taesan instinctively swung his sword as if warned by his instincts.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"Ka-aw-ang!

Taesan's body is blown away.

Hasan moves again, dashing towards Taesan at an incredible speed that's hard to follow with the naked eye. He moves his sword not by sight, but by instinct.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

[Hasan has activated his Golden Annihilation.]

A golden sphere is about to engulf Taesan.

Taesan tries to dodge, but it's too late. The sphere engulfs him.

As time rewinds, Taesan quickly gains distance. Hasan immediately gives chase.

'I'm faster and stronger than him.'

A being who has reached the depths is using all their might to kill Taesan. They're even synchronizing their armor to increase their power, making it hard for Taesan to catch up. And the special power of the sword is also difficult to counter.

Speed.

Strength.

And the sword.

He's trying to kill Taesan with these three cards.

'Is that all you've got?'

Taesan laughs.

Lee Taeyeon is faster than Hasan, and stronger, and her equipment is all superior to what Hasan is using now."

And she had such equipment all over her body.

However, despite having the stats of an easy mode, Taeyean couldn't gain a clear advantage over him, who was even weaker than the equipment.

"In the end, the battle is a card game."

Who has more cards, and who has stronger cards.

Taesan mutters to himself as he dodges Hasan's attacks, which are overwhelmingly powerful, but none of them land on Taesan.

Kuwooong!

Whenever Hasan charges, Taesan's instincts warn him, and the line of death also activates, concentrating all his senses and allowing him to predict Hasan's movements.

Kagak!

The swords clash.

Taesan's enemies in his past were all fast and strong, but he managed to defeat them. It wasn't just a matter of speed that allowed him to pressure Taesan.

[You activated Starlight Arrow.]

The arrow of light is summoned and fires. Hasan dodges at the same time Taesan casts his magic.

[You activated Magic Explosion.]

The light explodes and spreads in all directions.

"Even Minerva, who was fighting from a distance, got hit by the fireball. She shook her hand with an unbelievable expression and brushed it off.

[This is terrible.] [Ugh!]

Hassan's voice is filled with pain. No matter how fast he is, if the starlight arrow explodes in this narrow space, he can't avoid it.

Hassan, ignoring the pain, drew his sword.

[Hassan activated Golden Destruction.]

The golden sphere was about to engulf Taesan, but Taesan activated his skill.

[You activated Forced Duel.]

Forced Duel is a skill that designates one target and allows only the two to attack each other, preventing outside interference.

So Taesan targeted Minerva, who was fighting the king's spear, with Forced Duel.

The golden sphere engulfed Taesan, but he appeared unscathed. Hassan swung his sword in a hurry, but it was all deflected by the effect of Forced Duel.

As the duration of Forced Duel ended, Taesan, who had dug his feet into Hassan's ground, placed his hand on Hassan's body.

[You activated the Branch of Despair.] [Ugh!]

A torrent of terrible emotions suddenly overwhelmed Hassan."

"The skill given by the God of Despair to Taesan. The Branch of Despair. Its effect is to instill despair in the opponent it touches.

It was the first time using it, but the effect was quite useful. As Hasan struggled in pain, his movements slowed down noticeably.

[You activated Amun's Black Stake.]

A black stake materialized in Taesan's hand. He swung it and collided with Hasan's sword.

Kuūung!

Hasan's sword was knocked away.

Hasan stumbled back, unable to expect that he would be overwhelmed by Taesan's superior strength. Taesan took advantage of the moment and struck with his sword.

[Kaaack!]

Hasan was on the verge of collapse.

Every time they fought, Taesan continued to pull out new techniques.

It felt like Taesan had an endless deck of cards, while Hasan had only five.

The fear of the unknown made Hasan hesitate, and he became more cautious, which gave Taesan an opportunity.

Taesan confirmed that Hasan's strength and vigor had decreased to some extent and summoned his magic.

[You activated Marbas' Black Wave.]"

Here is the translation of the text to English:

**The Dark Wave Covers Everything**

Hasan is suffering from the effects of the desperate branch, and is protecting himself with a golden demise.

And Taesan has activated his concealment.

Hasan, who momentarily lost sight of Taesan's movement, is on high alert.

And Taesan is at a distance, far away.

A black passage has appeared in his hand.

A passage leading to the devil's realm. Hasan feels that he must stop it, but it's too late. He has become passive and is excessively cautious, letting Taesan slip away.

**You have activated the golden sword of Navarius.]

The golden sword that has been activated is unlike anything Taesan has used before.

It shines brightly like the sun, radiating a golden light.

The power of a being beyond mortal existence is there.

Hasan, who was about to retreat, stops in his tracks. He is here on the king's orders, and it is his duty to kill the enemy in front of him for the king.

He cannot retreat.

Hasan grips his sword, and Taesan charges at him with a fierce cry.

Hasan trusts in his inner strength.

"I felt fear for the first time, and I thought that I would never be able to overcome it, that even my own king couldn't overcome it.

But if I'm unarmed, I can kill the enemy in front of me.

[Hasan activated the Golden Annihilation.]

A golden sphere engulfed the space.

And the moment it collided with the golden sword, it shattered like glass.

The golden light enveloped Hasan.

* * *

"That was fun."

Taesan said, piercing his sword into Hasan's chest as he fell.

All the opponents he had faced so far were related to the Emperor's Guards, and it had been a while since he had a fight where he could show off his skills one by one like this.

"[Your Majesty, I'm sorry. I couldn't protect you...]."

Hasan disappeared, saying this in a gloomy tone.

The power he possessed began to dwell within Taesan.

[Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your desire for victory has been activated.] [Your spiritual power has risen. Your permanent stats have increased: HP by 5200, strength by 320, agility by 401, and intelligence by 350.] [Your spiritual power has risen. You have obtained the special passive skill [Guardian's Fortitude].]

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"It wasn't an easy enemy.

If he hadn't learned the absolute judgment, it would have taken a considerable amount of time to defeat him.

Mashin told Taesan that the enemy was waiting on the 60th floor, but it was the 58th floor. And Taesan learned the absolute judgment on the 59th floor.

Mashin probably didn't expect to obtain a skill that would change the rules in just one floor either.

Anyway, he won. And it wasn't over yet.

"Want some help?"

Taesan approached Minerva, and she laughed.

"Then thank you."

[Ah, ahh...].

The king's sword let out a despairing cry.

Taesan grasped his sword.

From the start, it was an opponent that even Minerva couldn't defeat alone. When Taesan joined, Quayla was overwhelmed by the crushing power difference.

Quayla seemed to have equipment with special abilities, but it didn't matter. Taesan ignored it and attacked, and Quayla slowly died.

And soon, Taesan won again."
