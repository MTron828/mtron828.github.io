110. 23rd Floor. Wind Spirit. Kashfa (1)

"I refuse."

He was the first to reject the Apostle's Contract. Fabsha withdrew obediently. Knowing Taesan's actions so far, he didn't cling heavily.

[Fabsha looks forward to the next meeting.]

Kugugung......

As darkness faded, the labyrinth appeared.

"Just let me go, really."

He was the simplest god he had seen. Taesan quickly confirmed his reward.

"I saw a strange system window."

It was an absurd sentence stating that proficiency in all skills had increased. Taesan reopened the system window.

[Your Enchantment Rise has been triggered. Proficiency in all skills except the soul skill [Enchantment Rise] will increase.]

"...Really."

Taesan stared blankly at the sentence and then opened the skill window.

The contents of the system window were indeed real. Proficiency in all skills he possessed had increased.

"Ha."

It was unbelievable.
It wasn't just one, but all skills. His magic, continuously active skills, triggered skills, and even rarely used black magic had their proficiencies increased.

Although the increase in proficiency for each skill was quite small, around 2-3% individually, when viewed as a whole, it was an unbelievable rise.

Currently, Taesan possessed around eighty skills. A simple calculation showed an increase approaching 200% overall.

"This is bizarre."

It wasn't incomprehensible. Enchantment Rise was a skill that stole the opponent's proficiency. The soul of Maresten, a powerful warrior whose depths he had vanquished, was his, and it was virtually indistinguishable from its own entity. Therefore, it seemed reasonable to gradually pilfer everything he had.

However, even considering that, the rise was nonsensical.

Indeed, due to this recent rise, there were several skills that had reached 100%.

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Composure] [Proficiency: 100%] [The spirit of this existence has reached the last moment of mortality.]

Composure. The skill he had possessed from the beginning finally reached 100%. Upon reaching 100%, the lengthy explanation was condensed into a single sentence.
[Composure's proficiency has reached 100%. Composure has evolved into the special continuous activation skill [Clarity Index].] [Special Continuous Activation Skill: Clarity Index] [Proficiency: 1%] [Unshakable mind. Unwavering determination.]

The evolution skill of Composure. Clarity Index.

A skill that affects the overall mental state, reaching its peak makes one unwavering in any situation. It doesn't directly impact combat but is tremendously important.

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Line of Death] [Proficiency: 100%] [Can sense the moment of approaching death. Activates in all crises.]

Line of Death also condensed into a simple sentence. Yet, there was no exhilaration. A good skill for detecting mortal danger, but since most of Taesan's trials were considered mortal dangers, it held little value for him.

Although proficiency reached 100%, it had not yet evolved. Line of Death evolved only under special circumstances.

If only he could raise his field of view a little more, it would reach 100%. Even the Ilik combat technique, which had been slowly climbing, was up by 2%.

"I wish I could receive it once more."

At this level, he could endure countless trials. Taesan felt a twinge of regret as he checked the remaining rewards.
[Proof of the Dagger of Proof] [Attack +25] [Reward bestowed by the Proof God. Among them, exceptional equipment.]

An impressive 25 in Attack power. It was 10 points higher than the transformed weapon previously equipped.

There was no reason not to wear it. And the skill.

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Proofbearer's Soulblade] [You have triumphed against another version of yourself. When faced with death, your soul undergoes the Trial of Fabsha. This skill can only be used once.]

"Hmm?"

Undergo the Trial of Fabsha? That was a difficult explanation to understand.

"Do you know what this is?"

"Uh...,"

The absent-minded ghost came to his senses.

"...Even if I don't know what the trial is, I understand facing death. Many times, it's a skill that extends your life."

"A second life? Is that what it is?"

"Probably a high possibility, right?"

If so, it was a very good skill. Nullifying attacks, enduring, and even the Proofbearer's Soulblade. To kill Taesan, you would have to overcome countless obstacles.

"Phew."

Confirmation was complete.

Taesan finished organizing and looked towards the altar. The strength he had felt was almost gone, as if the work was done.

"Is this all?"
Even after death, a contract binds the soul to the god.

The ghost spoke solemnly.

"Clearing the Labyrinth is near impossible even for those with talent, luck, and skill. Some who have lost heart or fear death accept the Apostle's offer."

"Why?"

Their soul becomes bound to the god. Taesan saw no reason to accept. The ghost explained,

"Because their power remains intact."

Taesan understood.

"Do they become unwilling to give up what they've built?"

"When you die, you lose everything. But if you accept the Apostle's contract, you can retain your essence forever bound to the god. Which is more agonizing, I cannot say. Malasten chose the latter."

The ghost shrugged.

"It's not a bad story. But it's not a good one either. So think carefully. At least I see no need to accept it."

"Neither do I."

At least, for him, it wasn't a good story.

Taesan began to move.
They defeated the spirits they encountered and arrived at a secret chamber. They disabled the traps and received their rewards.

[Black Rune Necklace] [Defense + 5] [Magic + 3] [Strength + 10] [Intelligence + 10] [A magical necklace. The power of the runes contained within is quite usable.]

Although the necklace they currently wore had lower attack power and no agility, all other stats were significantly higher. With rare magical attributes included, it was definitely worth the switch.

They then proceeded to the boss room. The boss was an intermediate ice spirit. Stronger than the intermediate fire spirit encountered earlier but not enough to stop Taesan.

[You have defeated the intermediate ice spirit of the Labyrinth.] [Your level has increased.] [Acquired Cold Shards.] [Activated Spiritual Enhancement.]

Cold Shards were refining items like Spirit Gems. They checked the rewards for the 22nd floor.

[Scroll of Obsidian Secrets] [A book containing dark magic secrets. Sells at a high price in shops.]

A dark magic item. It was said that offering dark magic-related items would grant access to dark magic. However, Taesan had no intention of making such offerings yet.
"I haven't even properly mastered the dark magic I just learned, so there's no need to learn more already."

I roughly understand how to use it, but I don't know details like exact damage calculations, elemental affinities, or skill combinations. If I try to learn more here, I might just confuse myself unnecessarily.

I planned to sell it to the shop if the price was right.

[Used ???] [Forearm Guard Made of Dragonhide] [Defense + 30] [Attack + 10] [Forearm guard made from dragonhide. The tough and sharp leather will protect its owner.]

It had high defense and even added 10 to attack power. The equipment that appeared after surpassing the 20th floor definitely showed a significant improvement.

And then they descended to the 23rd floor.

[Start of 23rd Floor Quest.] [Defeat the boss of the 23rd floor and proceed.] [Reward: Snake Skin Belt] [Secret Reward: ???]

They showed the Scroll of Obsidian Secrets to the shopkeeper at the entrance to the 23rd floor.

"How much is this?"

"Ten gold."

The shopkeeper replied casually after a quick glance.

As it fetched a fair price as described, they sold it. The shopkeeper accepted it with a dubious expression.
"Didn't you offer it to Mashin?"

"There's no need to offer it right now."

There were still many things to buy at the store. Basic items cost tens of thousands, even up to a hundred thousand, so having money was advantageous. They judged that it was better than dark magic, which they might not use when they needed it.

"From a practical standpoint, that's true... It shouldn't matter. Even if one's heart is narrow, it should work."

Mumbling, the shopkeeper saw them off.

Taesan arrived at the 23rd floor.

The monster on the 23rd floor was a wind spirit. It moved without a proper form, relying on sensation to be cut down.

Although Itaeyeon said that he had a lot of trouble attacking properly, Taesan was able to deal with it right away because of his high skill in sensory enhancement.

He moved four times straight ahead and five times to the right. He arrived at a plain empty room.

This was exactly where the crazed spirit spoke.

"You have triggered scouting."

One brick entered Taesan's field of vision. He went through the passage that opened when he pressed there.
As they proceeded down the corridor, the smell of moisture thickened. By halfway, it was difficult to breathe.

[Human?]

A clear voice echoed, tinged with confusion.

In a room akin to a tropical forest, a blue deer appeared.

[Senior wind spirit of recording, Kashpa has arrived.] [What brings a human here?]

"I was commissioned by the White Spirit."

Kashpa fell silent at Taesan's words. After a moment of shaking its antlers, Kashpa spoke again.

"You speak of the crazed spirit. That wretched thing asked you to kill me."

A deep sigh echoed.

"It's broken. A distorted spirit without proper sanity. If you follow its words, destruction will eventually find you."

Kashpa raised its antlers.

"So go back. Human. Go back and complete your mission. That's what a human like you should do."

"Sorry, but my mission is this."

Taesan drew his sword. Flames imbued within Calvert's artifact began to engulf the surrounding recordings. Anger tinged Kashpa's voice.
[You...!] [Kashpa summoned the wind-walking deer.]

Sharp winds blew from the blue deer, extinguishing the flames.

"Though the pitiful human showed mercy, daring to scorch my land for your meager purpose!"

"Mercy?"

Taesan chuckled lightly.

"That's not something you lot have to grant me."

[Human.]

With a stern voice, wind rushed in.

"Die."

The wind's edge rushed forth. Taesan swung his sword. With a sharp sound, the wind shattered and dispersed.

"Hm."

Taesan moved swiftly, and Kashpa sent wind blades towards him. Unseen forces shook the walls.

"You triggered scouting."

As the skill activated, wind blades began to appear one by one. Taesan stopped moving and waved his hands. With gentle motions, he deflected each blade.

"Human..."

Kashpa sharpened its resolve. Wind blades were attacks of unseen nature. No matter how acute the senses, one couldn't block them all, but Taesan parried them as if they were visible.
[He thinks he can defeat the golem created by the king. However, if that's all he's got, he can't defeat me.]

In an instant, the wind gathered. Then it shot towards Taesan like a massive cannon. Taesan wrapped his arms around himself to withstand the attack without any delay.

"Phew!"

[Your first attack nullification has been activated.]

The wind exploded, shaking Taesan's body all around. Taking advantage of the nullification, Taesan swiftly rushed towards Kashpa.

"Ugh!"

Seeing Taesan charge as if unaffected by the attack, Kashpa shook its horns slightly in confusion. A barrier of wind cut between Taesan and Kashpa.

"Kwang!"

Taesan swung his sword. The barrier swayed greatly but did not break.

"So resilient."

[Impressive skill, but still human.]

With a sneer, air burst out. Activating scouting to confirm, thousands, tens of thousands of wind needles were being shot towards Taesan.

"Is this the spirit's technique?"

Except for the first time when the skill activation window appeared, it hadn't popped up again. Before skill activation, the system window appears, allowing for preparation. However, it was completely impossible with the spirit's attacks.
"I'd like to learn this too."

Taesan laughed joyfully.
