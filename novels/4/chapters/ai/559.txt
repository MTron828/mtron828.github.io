**Episode 560**

560. 98th Floor. A Complete Existence. High Priest (3)

[It's good, but... it's hard to like it unconditionally.]

"Why is that?"

[No.]

The demon lord smiled wryly.

[It's nothing. Just a light plan that went awry.]

She raised her finger and pointed to Taesan.

[Do you remember? The little child I saved, your child.]

"I remember."

The young lamb of Vesetesa, Anetsha.

Taesan, who had saved the demon child.

She knew that Taesan had feelings for her.

[I was thinking of using her to get you to settle in the demon world.]

"......Did you?"

Her words surprised him a little. The demon lord had said similar things before, but he didn't think she had gone that far.

[In the end, it's emotions that bind strong people. Well... it's a story about where you stop, whether it's at the level of mortal or immortal. You've come too far now.]

The current Taesan was no longer a being bound to just one mortal.

[Heh.]
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$"Masin stood up with a short sigh.

'Have you recovered completely?'

[Well, not completely. It's impossible to be perfect since it takes too long. Besides, I can't make it take less time.]

The contamination that had spread throughout the universe was getting bigger.

[I should sort things out before it becomes too difficult. But... I do have time for a light test.]

Masin spun around and looked at Tae San.

[Tae San. How about sparring with me lightly?]

"Sparring?"

[Just a little bit. A power struggle that doesn't put a burden on each other's strength.]

"If that's what you want."

Tae San didn't refuse. Masin smiled broadly.

[I thought you would agree.]

Masin gathered his strength. Darkness gathered, engulfing the world.

Masin flicked his finger, and at the same time, darkness rushed to swallow Tae San.

It was all the darkness in this world.

The absolute power that the master of ma himself could wield, controlling ma."

Tae San let out a sigh.

'Even though you said it would be light.'

It was not light at all."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Immortal cannot even respond. Faith is not different. Even the Transcendent who dominates small concepts is the same. The only one who can counter it is the Transcendent who has reached an extremely high position.

However, even they cannot respond easily. The concept possessed by the Demon God is a concept that stands at a remarkably high position, encompassing all concepts in the universe.

The Demon God. Lucifer.

She was a being who had reached that realm.

But Taesan did not back down. There was no fear in his eyes.

Tremble.

The ash-colored figure appears in the world.

Darkness and ash-colored collide. The concept of the world and the concept that is not a concept clash and become distorted.

Kaaaaaaa!

And, darkness and ash-colored shatter.

Taesan did not back down at all against the power of the Demon God. The Demon God smiled mockingly and dominated the darkness.

[You've reached a stable state. You're invincible. You can defeat that existence and win. Moreover, you can kill many high gods and bring stability to the universe.]

"It's still a distant story."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[I don't feel like it's that far away. Whether I like it or not, if this war drags on, there's nothing good for us. Other transcendents will also try to settle it as quickly as possible. In the previous war, we couldn't end it, but... this time, you're here.]

Taesan can kill Goshin.

He can bring an end to this tedious war.

[We might lose. Maybe the universe will fall back into their hands. But somehow, a conclusion will be reached. Whether it's beneficial to them or to us. So I'll ask you one thing.]

"What is it?"

[Where will you rest your body when everything is over?]

* * *

Where will you rest your body when everything is over?

That was a question the previous god asked Taesan.

Back then, it was a story that was too far-fetched. I didn't understand Goshin or transcendents, and I didn't even know my own origin.

So the story I told back then didn't have much meaning. Taesan didn't pay attention to it.

But it's not the same now.

Now, the end is really approaching.

[Back then, I said you were heterogenous and that mortals wouldn't be able to accept you. But... it's not the same now. You will receive the reverence of all, and reign as their god.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He distorts concrete and demolishes a house with his bare hands, a superhuman.

Such an existence receives both fear and admiration from people. He can never get close to them.

But if he is an existence that surpasses the line, ruling the entire planet by parting the sea, opening the sky, and demolishing mountains.

Such an existence only receives pure faith.

Taesan was in that state.

[But in the end, it's faith. They will never be able to truly get close to you.]

"You've said similar things before."

[That's right. My thoughts haven't changed since then. They find it hard for you to be a resting place for their bodies.]

They don't see Taesan as a fellow human.

They only see him as a great transcendent being who watches over them as a god.

[That place... is hard for you to be a resting place.]

"What do you want to say?"

Mashin smiled faintly.

[I think that even the demon world can become a resting place for someone like you.]

"……."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Anetsha will be waiting for you in the demon world. She regards you as an idol, not a god. She'll watch over you and protect you by your side. I'll do the same. Doesn't it sound enjoyable?"

Although it was said in a casual tone, it ultimately meant that they would be going to the demon world. Taesan couldn't help but ask, gazing at Mashin.

"Why are you being so kind to me?"

At first, Mashin didn't particularly like Taesan. She had even considered crushing his spirit with a single glance.

However, after Taesan passed her trials, her reaction suddenly changed. She began to offer him various forms of help, and her favor towards him became evident to anyone who saw them.

It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that she was the most benevolent transcendent being towards him.

"What's the big deal, anyway," Mashin said with a playful smile.

"As I said before, I just like you."

* * *

"Alright, let's go then."

Mashin waved her hand. Before her and Taesan was a dark, swirling aura that was growing larger.

"There's a divine being inside. But it's quite deep, and there are many obstacles. I'll open the path for you to get there."

Taesan, who would have to face the divine being directly, was himself.

"Then..."]
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Tesan nodded his head and lifted his sword. The smoldering ashes gathered around the sword.

Harnessing physical force and boundaries, he swung it.

The black ink and Tesan's power met.

Kwuuuuung!

A hole is torn open.

The other side of the black ink is seen, as if the picture is ripped apart.

And Tesan saw.

The myriads of distorted existence in the hole.

Literally countless, divine tools, monstrous beings of Sado level are seen.

They all rush towards Tesan. Each wielding the power bestowed upon them, they swing it towards Tesan.

[Your opponent is me.]

The divine being snaps his finger. Darkness rushes in. The approaching Sado beings are torn apart and instantly disappear in the darkness.

[Gather.]

The divine being raises his hands. The essence of darkness gathers in his hands.

It is the marrow of the world. That itself.

The divine being stretches out his hand. The condensed darkness explodes.

Kwagaagaagang!

And the black ink is torn open.

The black hole that swallows the universe is the absolute power. It opens up, pierced by the power of the divine being.

The divine being clenches his fist. A strong force enters his hand.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Kagakagakagakagak!"

The open hole is forcibly maintained by the authority of the demon god.

Thanks to that, Taesan was able to see it.

The enormous existence at the end of the road.

The demon god had chosen its breath. Its power had been greatly consumed due to its recent actions.

Choralala.

And the black ink-like substance slowly approaches.

It approaches to exclude Taesan and the demon god. The demon god stomps its foot. The dense darkness collides with the blackness and shatters.

[Then, I'll leave the rest to you.]

"I understand."

The demon god breaks through the road and blocks external interference.

Taesan's role is to kill the gods until now.

[You have activated acceleration.] [You have activated skill acceleration.]

Accelerating its body, it dashes forward. It penetrates the path created by the darkness.

And the presence felt from beyond grows stronger and stronger.

"Goodbye."

[You have activated magic overlap.] [You have activated Great Collapse [Boundary].]

With a farewell, the ash-colored gathering begins.

The condensed gray boundary, just as it is, flies towards the existence beyond.

And the existence beyond responds.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It expands its own body.

Inside the expanded body, a massive, ash-colored collapse is swallowed.

There is no sound, no wave of power.

It's as if it never existed from the beginning, and it's gone.

"Is it different from the worthless ones?"

The worthless ones had erased the power of Taesan. They had filled it with value, only to erase that value itself, making it as if it never existed.

But Mujogang was different.

It wasn't erased.

It just contained it within itself, devouring the influence itself and making it disappear.

[Mujogang has appeared.]

The lord of the abyss.

The administrator of the bottomless pit.

Taesan stopped in front of Mujogang.

Mujogang looked like a massive lump of flesh.

Its dark, stained form wobbled grotesquely, like fat. It had no legs, no arms, no head. Only its enormous body was visible.

Its size was comparable to a mountain. Compared to the World Destroyer, it wasn't that big.

But its bottom couldn't be seen.

Mujogang was empty, like a monster that devours everything.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The abyss gazes at Taesan. The gaze of the abyss feels like a god's. And the emotions contained within are also spoken.

It was a feeling similar to despair. It felt like it could swallow everything, the universe, and still feel an endless void.

Shudder.

The abyss begins to move. With its massive flesh as the center, the black ink that devours everything starts to spread.

[The opponent is @#@@#@@#@$$$%%$^%%^^%&&*&*]

The opponent in front of me is a complete abyss.

Taesan is also encountering this existence for the first time. It's difficult to make a direct comparison with the beings beyond, but in terms of pure power and strength, Taesan has fought against someone who surpasses even Rakirates. It's not an exaggeration to say that Taesan was above Rakirates.

The number of abysses is not that great. The number of transcendents who dominate a complete concept is several times that.

However, being overwhelmed means that one abyss can overpower multiple transcendents. It may not be the case with Rakirates, but generally, that's how it would be.

And now, a complete abyss stands before Taesan.

Taesan may have had a good fight against Rakirates, but Rakirates had still been holding back against Taesan. However, the abyss is genuinely trying to kill Taesan."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"An opponent I've never faced before, not even once.

But Taesan revealed this.

In other words, if I win this battle, it's likely that I can defeat any other strong opponent, no matter who it is.

"It's a great opportunity, instead."

A low, murmured voice resonates. The black ink-like aura rushes towards Taesan.

Taesan took a step back."

Note: "고신" is a term that can be translated to "strong opponent" or "formidable foe", but it has a connotation of being a worthy or respected opponent.
