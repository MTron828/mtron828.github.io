Chapter 115

115. 24th Floor. Boss

[SPECIAL QUEST START] [Return to Earth.] [In a week's time, you will return to the land you abandoned. Survive and come back. The reward will be determined based on your performance. This quest cannot be refused.]

This was the second return quest. Even the ghost realized it late.

"[Are you going back again?]"

"Yes."

"[It seems like a long time, but we're being called back quickly.]"

I didn't know before, but now I know that the gods are involved. The gods were making the player return to Earth continuously.

"What's the reason?"

"I don't know what their crazy intentions are."

It's unclear for now. Tai Shan opened the community.

[Crazy[Lazy] : Ah... I'm going crazy.] [Ultimate[Normal] : What are we going to do this time? Are we going to break into the monster's nest?]

The community was in chaos. Unlike the first return, there was no expectation or hope, only despair and fear.
Here is the translation of the text:

They already knew what state the Earth was in. The place was occupied by monsters, and they couldn't respond to it with their own strength.

Their return was not a blessing, but a curse.

[Kim Na-yeon [Lee Ji] : I don't like it! I don't like it! I like this place! Don't want to go back!]

This was especially true for players in easy mode.

Easy mode is extremely easy. As long as they don't waste their time on unnecessary adventures and pay attention to safety, they can clear most levels.

As a result, the maze is not a desperate space for them. On the contrary, it feels like a nursery.

So, for easy mode players, the Earth will feel like hell.

Tae-san knew it. He had come from there, after all.

"Still, it's okay for now."

As long as they don't go back a second time, it's doable. Even easy mode players can survive if they're careful and stick together with others.

The problem is after clearing, not now. Tae-san wrote a post.

[Kang Tae-san [Erlon] : How are you feeling?] [Lee Tae-yeon [Erlon] : Ah, Mr. Tae-san.] [Kang Jun-hyeok [Erlon] : Older brother.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The players in lone mode were also despairing. Even if it was difficult and tough, why did they have to return to Earth again, and they were bursting with frustration.

However, only Taeyeon and Kang Jun-hyeok were calm and comforting the others.

[Kang Tae-san [Lone] : You're more calm than I expected?] [Taeyeon [Lone] : Well, I had expected that the beginning was not the end. However, I didn't expect it to progress this quickly.]

[Kang Jun-hyeok [Lone] : Still, we're in a relatively good situation.]

The two of them made a concerted effort. By clearing the labyrinth and becoming stronger, they finally obtained a power that far exceeded hard mode.

[Kang Tae-san [Lone] : Are we breaking through the 7th floor?] [Taeyeon [Lone] : Yes. It's a level that's embarrassing to compare to, but it seems like we're doing well.]

The 7th floor was a floor where the Lizardman Inspector appeared. I thought it would be a tough fight, but it turned out to be manageable than I expected.
Here is the translation:

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone] : We've become stronger. We can't just leave others to die.]

[Kang Jun-hyeok [Alone] : Ah, my heart is racing. I'm going crazy.]

[Kang Tae-san [Alone] : There's still a week left. Let's go down to the 8th floor and take on the trials that are worthy of receiving the divine test of God's wrath. That way, we can grow stronger without taking unnecessary risks.]

The divine test of God's wrath. That trial was one where we didn't have to risk our lives to recognize our limits and give up. We could become stronger without taking big risks.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone] : Is that really so?]

[Kang Jun-hyeok [Alone] : Yeah, that's true... Thanks, Hyung. It's going to be tough, but I'll go down.]

[Kang Tae-san [Alone] : But don't die unnecessarily. Let's see what happens a week from now.]

With two of them, there wouldn't be a big problem. Tae-san left a parting shot and turned his gaze towards the hard mode.

[Kang Tae-san [Alone] : How are you two?]

[Kim Jung-geun [Hard] : I'm doing all right, I guess... But my mother is a problem.]

[Kim Hui-yeon [Hard] : ...It's going to be tough.]

The burden felt even from outside the text made Tae-san smile slightly.

[Kang Tae-san [Alone] : Think about it in a more relaxed way. It's better to make your own decisions rather than leaving your life in someone else's hands, isn't it?]

[Kim Hui-yeon [Hard] : What do you mean? I have the lives of three million people in my hands. How can I think about it in a relaxed way...?]

[Kang Tae-san [Alone] : Ah?]
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san remembered that Kim Hwi-yeon managed tens of thousands of people.

[Tae-san: Even so, I know what needs to be done, don't I?] [Kim Hwi-yeon: ...Yes, I know. It's just a matter of adjustment. What's the problem?]

Tae-san swept aside his doubts and asked.

[Tae-san: How's the hard mode?] [Kim Hwi-yeon: It's okay. There are still people dying, but the number is decreasing and we're making progress slowly.]

It wasn't a bad story. Hard mode was the top players, excluding solo mode. Each of them was precious.

After verifying, Tae-san spent a few minutes chatting and said goodbye.

[Tae-san: Then let's meet again in a week.] [Kim Hwi-yeon: Ugh, I don't want to. I don't want to... I just want to know what I'll be doing when I go back.] [Kim Jung-geun: You won't know unless you can predict the future.] [Kim Hwi-yeon: Yeah, it's just complaining.]

Tae-san closed the community chat window.

He already knew what to do when he came back for the second time.

However, he was not confident that it would be the same as before.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's going to happen this time?"

Something was bound to change.

No matter what, it was already a week later. He thought he would get stronger by then.

Tae-san had finally broken through the maze. He had defeated the 24th floor boss and confirmed the reward.

[Baal's Staff] [Black Magic + 10] [A staff made by Baal, the wicked one, for his own amusement. Those of low level will go crazy just by touching it.]

"This can be traded with Ma Shin, I suppose."

[He used it.] [Ring of Sam Water] [Attack Power + 5] [Defense Power + 5] [Strength + 5] [Agility + 5] [A ring containing the power of nature, allowing for the summoning of clean water. Although the amount is small, it can summon a small amount of water.]

"Ah, oh."

The stat boost is quite high. Plus, it has a special ability to summon water.

Let's try it out. About three bottles of water flowed out.

This amount is not bad. Considering the situation on Earth, clean water is absolutely necessary.

"Then..."

Now he was thinking of learning a new black magic. Tae-san held Baal's staff with an ambiguous expression.

"What do I do now?"
Here is the translation of the text:

No matter how hard I tried to learn, I didn't know the method. Since the master didn't explain it clearly, I had to try various ways to figure it out.

At first, I knelt down and started praying like the master had done. I continued to pray, offering sacrifices to the master, and my energy began to surge.

The dimensions of the labyrinth began to unfold, and a powerful energy was felt from the other side. Darkness spread, and the master appeared.

[Excitement.]

She had a face full of annoyance, with her arms crossed. The master was taken aback by the sudden outburst of dissatisfaction.

"Why are you doing that?"

[...No, no, I won't say it. What can I say that I haven't said?]

The master narrowed her eyes.

[But from now on, I'll take it from you. Got it?]

"Ah, yes."

I didn't know the reason, but since I had to accept it, there was no reason to refuse. As soon as the master responded, my mood improved, and the master spoke in a higher tone.

[You know the reason. Are you preparing to leave?]

"I understand."

[I wouldn't know your business. It's really annoying and beneath me. I've used up all my annoying tricks.
Here is the translation of the text:

The face of the demon had a mixture of mockery and scorn. It was as if he knew the reason why Taesan was returning to the earth.

"Maybe...?"

[I know. I won't tell you.]

"You still have to go down, don't you?"

[I won't, but if you go down 50 floors, I'll explain it to you. Work hard and come back.]

The demon waved his hand. The staff held by Taesan floated up into the air and flew towards her.

[This is enough for basic dark magic. I want to play a trick on those guys, so I'll give you what you need. You've learned basic dark magic, "Prayer to the Demon".]

"What is this?"

[You'll definitely need it when you go out.]

The demon smiled slightly.

[I think I'll have a chance to use dark magic effectively. Will you thank me for it?]

"Thank you."

It seemed to be a thoughtful gift, so I expressed my gratitude in advance. The demon clenched his fist with a happy face. Darkness began to spread.

[Don't forget. I, the demon, will be taking care of you the most. You understand, right?]

"I understand."

[Then don't die and come back. Those things won't just stay still, you know. It'll be quite tough... ...quiet.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The demon's face contorted as it turned around.

[And then, even those who didn't care before might get involved. I should declare my intentions in advance.]

With the demon's final words, it disappeared. The ghost, who had been silent until then, muttered to itself with a strange tone.

[Wow, this is really weird.]

"What's going on?"

[No, I shouldn't have said that. I'll get scolded. What did I receive?]

"It's a skill like a charging type."

[Basic Black Magic: Prayer to the Demon] [Proficiency: 1%] [You can call upon the demon and draw out her power. When using this skill, you will enter a meditative state and your mana will recover at a faster rate. While in a meditative state, all stats and action speed will be halved.]

"Recovery skill?"

Since mana was different from magic, it seemed like the demon had provided a recovery method. In reality, it was impossible to level up after returning to the earth, so the demon's recovery was difficult.

Thinking about this, the skill was useful as the demon had said. I expressed my gratitude to her and was convinced.

'The demon knows.'

About the earth, that he would return, and his past...
Here is the translation:

Then, the high-ranking officials would probably know about it.

Taesan moved to the next floor, the 25th floor.

[Start of 25th floor quest.] [Defeat the boss of the 25th floor and pass through.] [Reward: Dark Robe] [Secret reward: ???]

"Did you come?"

At the entrance of the floor, the shop owner was waiting. Taesan, instead of passing by as usual, asked:

"Can you show me some equipment that I can use now?"

"Why suddenly?"

"I'll be leaving for a while, so I need it."

"...Ah."

The shop owner also realized it.

"Are you leaving again? That's absurd. Wait for a moment."

The shop owner pulled out the equipment, one by one. Let's check each one to make sure it's definitely much better than the equipment we saw at the 11th floor.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Treasured Gauntlet] [A gauntlet adorned with treasures. Despite its appearance, it is also suitable for actual combat. A worn-out treasure created by a tired old warrior.]

[Attack power + 45] [50,000G] [The Piper's Flute] [A flute used by a musician who loved silence. When used, it prohibits the use of all magic within a 10-minute range and can only be used once a day.]

[70,000G]

The price has increased to an unimaginable level. I'm sure if I had bought a different equipment at that time, I would have regretted the price I paid.

Tae-san now has 40,000 gold. He has earned a lot of money by catching guides.

As Tae-san was browsing around, his eyes landed on a wristguard.

"Karl."

The wristguard, covered in thorns, seemed to be alive, and its thorn ended was striking the ground.

[A Wristguard with a Soul.] [A wristguard that kills everything except its owner. It was created by a witch's whims. There is still a hidden secret.]

[Attack power + 25] [Defense power + 1] [40,000G]

"What's wrong with this?"

"That's it."

The shop owner, who had witnessed Tae-san's words, said it naturally.

"Would you like to buy it?"

"Yes."

The wristguard's attack power is 25. Despite the drawback of having no defense power, it still compensates for its shortcomings. The shop owner also realized this fact belatedly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"...I thought, you had no experience with equipment. It's not a common case. Think about it. The attack power can only be applied with the relevant equipment. There are various attack power buffs, but most of them are rare and expensive. At least that's not the case."

From a typical adventurer's perspective, there was no reason to use equipment with no defense and only mediocre attack power. I understood it.

But not for Taesan.

"I'll do it."

"What, you'll be fine with that? Do you have the money?"

"Yes."

Taesan gave gold and put on a forearm guard. The whip wrapped around his arm, shaking back and forth as it struck Taesan's arm.

"It seems to suit you. Use it well."

"Do you have any sense?"

"Yes, but it's not normal. The direction is abnormal, but the equipment itself is high-quality. If it were a proper equipment, I couldn't have bought it now?

Ka-rak.

The whip gently wrapped around Taesan's arm.
