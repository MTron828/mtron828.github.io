87. The Ruined World of Harfran (2)

"Should I take all these roots?"

[You can cut them and take them. It's quite large, but since you have inventory, there shouldn't be a problem.]

Taesan adjusted his posture. At the same time, the forest began to move with a loud noise.

Kwoong!

The ground collapsed, and the roots rose up. The surrounding trees surged and struck Taesan.

Taesan stomped his foot, leaping through the air, trampling the roots and landing haphazardly on the ground.

Thud!

Haphazardly shook back and forth, and the branches began to twist into curved shapes. With a booming sound like a slingshot pulled to its limit, it impacted.

Jjajak!

Taesan, again, stomped his foot and spread out the legs he hit forest spread beyond
[You triggered a backlash.]

A skill that spreads intangible force in the surroundings. Backlash.

However, the roots only wavered slightly, continuing to target Taesan without losing momentum.

Realizing that backlash had little effect, Taesan changed tactics. He gripped his sword and focused all his mind.

[You activated mental acceleration.]

Time in the world slows down.

He swept away the roots aiming for his left foot. Dodging branches trying to pierce his head, he moved his hands skillfully. Roots and branches rushing to grab his arms fell apart in pieces.

Despite the unstable ground crumbling beneath him, Taesan was compelled to act.

In situations where his actions were restricted, this skill enabled him to move to a certain extent. In this case, even with the crumbling ground, it proved effective.

He pushed them away, again and again. As if unable to endure, a tree seemed to flatten Taesan entirely, but he deftly moved his sword to cut it to pieces.

In the midst of battle, Taesan calmly surveyed everything around him.

"There's... no ashen aura."
Here is the translation of the text from Korean to English:

"Whether it hadn't been discovered yet or simply couldn't be seen, unlike the cliff, it didn't appear visible.

'Are they hiding within the trees?'

In any case, slashing wildly was the objective. Taesan, having deflected all attacks aimed at him, rushed towards the wild forest.

The branches of the wild trees tightened again and exploded.

Crack!

A sharp cracking sound struck Taesan. Frowning, he stepped back.

It wasn't an attack judgment but a repelling judgment, so the nullification of attacks didn't trigger, making it too difficult to approach.

Then he changed tactics. He induced physical attacks from the opponent's side.

Taesan redirected his attacks towards the surrounding trees.

The trees tried to push Taesan away using roots and branches, but such minor attacks couldn't stop Taesan. In an instant, the trees began to break into pieces.

Crack!

The wild forest attempted to drive him away, but from this distance and not head-on, Taesan was able to withstand it.

In a flash, the trees were cut down. The small forest visibly vanished.

'How do I get out of here?'"
Here is the English translation of the text:

"He won't simply move according to orders. Judging from the intense attack as Taesan approached the cliff, there is a strong possibility of his own will.

And Taesan's prediction was accurate.

Despite the madman pulling tree branches and swinging them wildly, Taesan cut through the trees without any discomfort. After a few more swings into thin air, the madman began to move with a loud noise.

The madman's tree branches gathered into one, forming a massive thorn that pierced Taesan.

Taesan quickly turned his body and blocked with his sword, but unable to withstand the force, he staggered back.

Realizing the effectiveness of his attacks, the madman continued gathering tree branches and started attacking.

That was what Taesan had hoped for.

Grrr.

As the branches gathered and shot out again, Taesan kicked off the ground and rushed towards them.

[Your first attack nullification has been activated.]

The tree branches returned to their state before shooting out. The madman was visibly startled enough for Taesan to notice. Quickly recovering from his surprise, he shot out again, but the same result repeated.

[Your second attack nullification has been activated.]"
Here is the English translation of the text:

"Taesan drew his sword. The madman fell apart and collapsed.

[Your Attack Boost has been activated. ???'s proficiency has increased by 1%.]

"Indeed, he was inside."

As the madman fell, the movement of the trees also stopped. Taesan put the madman's roots into his inventory.

"It's not that difficult."

[I told you. There's nothing too difficult for your level. It might be better to return faster than that.]

"Seems like it."

Taesan looked up at the sky.

From the perspective of the stars, an existence like Taesan's would be very small and weak. So they probably wouldn't pay much attention to him.

You can tell just by looking at the sandstorm or the cliff. They aimed at the naturally appearing Taesan, but there was no thick flesh there.

But not now.

In the ashen space, there was unmistakably a focus of flesh towards Taesan.

Kugugugugung......

A huge sound echoes from the world itself. An overwhelming sensation begins to overwhelm Taesan.

He can be sure.

If he continues here, he will die.

"See you next time."
Here is the English translation of the text:

"Taesan waved his hand. He immersed himself towards the fractured space.

Just as when he entered, after a short while, he could return to the familiar labyrinth.

"You're back?"

Hafran greeted Taesan. Taesan opened his inventory.

[Sub Quest Completed]

* * *

[Root of the Madman] [From a ruined world. Alone, it amounts to nothing. If planted in the right environment, it seems it would grow.]

Taesan handed the Root of the Madman to Hafran. Hafran received it with longing eyes.

"To me, it looks like an ordinary root."

"It might seem so to you. You're not a resident of that world. But to me, it's different. ...I haven't been able to make something enjoyable in a long time."

Hafran, looking at the swaying root with shimmering eyes, said.

"So, what do you want?"

"On the contrary, what can you create?"

"I can make anything for any part you can wear."

It was a straightforward offer to ask for anything.

Taesan pondered deeply.
Here is the translation of the text:

---

I don't know what level of quality it will be, but it should be a pretty good piece of equipment. So, I'll probably end up wearing it for quite a while. In other words, there was a possibility that when I obtained some equipment later on, I might not end up using it at all.

It wasn't a loss, but it felt like a loss.

"I've had a similar experience in the previous world."

In a game, when you choose equipment as a quest reward, and then immediately after, a good piece of that same equipment drops in the next dungeon.

Having had such experiences quite frequently, I felt an instinctive reluctance.

Taesan, who had been pondering, reached a conclusion.

"Can you mix it with the weapon I have?"

"It's possible."

Surprised, Taesan asked again.

"Really?"

"Of course it's possible. If I couldn't do that much, I wouldn't be able to call myself a blacksmith."

Hafran replied calmly. Since Taesan had asked without much expectation, he felt like he was gaining something.

And so it was settled.

"Does it matter?"

[I don't mind. It's yours. Do as you wish.]

He had the ghost's permission. Taesan drew his sword.

"Then mix this with it."

[Cabert's Relic: Sword Bathed in Ancestor's Blood] [Artifact of a world now in ruins. Claimed the lives of countless nobles.] [Attack +20] [When facing enemies of noble lineage, Attack +10]
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

Cabert's Sword. It was the sword given by the ghost as a quest clear reward. Since there was no need to change it for a while, he intended to use this sword.

Hafran, who received the sword, gave a curious look to the ghost.

"Is it okay?"

[It's fine. Do as you wish.]

"If you say so..."

Hafran nodded.

"I'll do it."

"Do you need to entrust the weapon?"

"No need for that. I'll create it here using the roots and combine it later. You can keep holding onto it."

"How long will it take?"

"Roughly... about two days."

Two days. It could be long or short, depending on how you looked at it.

"Then come back in two days."

"Take your time."

Hafran waved happily as he touched the roots.

[What are you going to do?]

"Since there's still time, I'll go as far down as I can."

With two days, he could descend even to the 20th floor and still have time left.

Taesan descended to the 17th floor.

The 17th floor was Dura. He remembered Itaeyun almost dying here as a knight without a head.

'Come to think of it.'

Recalling it, she had said there wasn't a single floor where she almost died. She had mentioned the risk of death on every floor.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

He descended through the floors, reminiscing on trivial memories. Dura was undoubtedly home to strong monsters, but as always, it held no special significance. He smoothly cleared through the secret rooms and tidied up the boss room.

The rewards were an earring, armor, and a shield.

The shield was equipment he didn't use, thus held no meaning, but the earring and armor proved quite useful.

[Earring of Blood Mist] [Strength + 10] [Agility + 10] [Defense + 5] [An earring abandoned in a blood-red mist. No one knows who its previous owner was.]

The earring of a wandering soul. He discarded an earring with mana of 10. With high intelligence and proficiency in magic, mana shortages were rare, making it less valuable.

[Leather Armor Steeped in Lava Dew] [Defense + 20] [Slightly increases success rate of resistance against burns.] [Armor steeped in dew formed under lava. It provides resistance to flames.]

Since it was better than his current armor, he decided to switch and wear it.

Having finished the 17th floor, he headed towards the 18th. He met a dwarf and sold unnecessary equipment before continuing downwards.

"Farewell."

The dwarf said calmly. Despite knowing that Taesan had met the blacksmith, he said nothing. Their relationship seemed distant.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

The 18th floor was similar to the 3rd floor. There were several Skeleton Mages and Skeleton Knights gathered in one place. Naturally, Taesan handled them without any difficulty and continued descending.

He obtained a staff, a shield, and a ring.

[Super Ring] [Attack Power + 5] [Defense + 5] [Strength + 5] [Super-Ring]

"What's this?"

[...Hmm?]

The explanation was in a language he didn't understand, but the effects themselves were good. He replaced a ring with mana 5 and wore it.

Even though the experience points that hadn't been increasing due to his high level barely went up, he finally reached level 42 after passing through this many floors.

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 42] [Shield: 183/183] [Health: 2160/2160] [Mana: 475/475] [Strength: 677] [Intelligence: 459] [Agility: 597] [Attack Power + 79] [Defense + 93] [Condition: Optimal]

Thanks to the Hongyeong Ring, Strength, Intelligence, and Agility increased by 3%. As a result, Strength increased by 20, Intelligence by 13, and Agility by 17. It was a satisfactory increase.

The 19th floor.

From here, the experience points began to increase slightly. It meant that his level had gradually risen to a similar level.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

The monsters on the 19th floor were Liches. They were monsters that used various magic, making them a bit tricky, but Taesan swiftly trampled them down with his superior stats. Unfortunately, perhaps because they were ordinary monsters or because the magic of the dead was entirely separate, he did not acquire any new magic.

And finally, he discovered an altar of the gods.

[You have discovered the Altar of Lucifer.]
