Chapter 187

187. 40th Floor. The Child of the Devil (1)

[There's something I need to tell you.]

She tied her hair back with a messy face and opened her mouth.

[There is a presence waiting for you at the end of the 40th floor.]

"Are you a guide for the path of sin?"

[If you think so, then so be it.]

The Heavenly God understood the demon's words.

"You seem to be one person."

The Heavenly God had already defeated all the 4th-tier adventurers on the 40th floor.

So, the next ones would be the 5th-tier adventurers, but it would take too long for them all to come down.

Therefore, it was likely that only one person,

A talented individual.

Someone who had grasped many things in the labyrinth and overcome many obstacles to obtain many things.

Unlike ordinary adventurers who were satisfied with just clearing a floor, the Heavenly God focused on skills and strategies themselves.

Such an outstanding individual had a high chance of coming down.

The demon nodded his head.

[Yes, he's coming for you. And he'll fight and kill you, or you'll kill him.]

The demon's face was pitiful.

[He's... my child.]

"Are you a devil?"
Here is the translation of the text:

[Okay. He doesn't have exceptional talent. But he has very little experience and made a wrong decision. Poor kid.]

The magician's eyes narrowed. The air suddenly grew thick.

[Honestly, I want to kill him all.]

A chilling sensation enveloped the mountains.

[But that's not possible.]

The magician shook his head. The oppressive atmosphere that had filled the entire space dissipated.

[The labyrinth's affairs are the concern of the labyrinth's adventurers. That's our code. Even if that poor kid was deceived, it's their own choice. I can't do anything about it. So, do as you please. Strong Mountain.]

"I agree."

Strong Mountain replied.

The magician disappeared, leaving behind a troubled expression.

"It seems I've given you a good lesson."

[The magician has a great deal of affection for his own child. If he's a talented magician, it will be even greater. But I won't interfere, so I won't worry about being bothered.]

If she can say something like that, she must be a very powerful magician.

Strong Mountain descended the stairs with a prepared heart.

The monster on the 40th floor was a golden knight with a single sword. The knight grasped the sword with both hands and rushed at Strong Mountain.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Tae-san wielded his sword and trampled it. This kind of enemy was useless against his spear. He charged in without thinking of dodging, and it was almost the same as not having a spear.

When he saw the spear shine, it would probably be when he was facing an existence waiting at the end of the 40th floor.

Tae-san began to rapidly break through the floors with his sword in hand.

The golden knight of the 40th floor was significantly stronger than before, but there was no significant difference against Tae-san, so he easily descended into the labyrinth.

He found the secret room and broke through the trap, and obtained the reward.

[The Shoes of Leap] [Defense + 40] [The shoes that the one who wanted to fly high in the sky had worn. He died from being burned to death by the sun.] [It can jump 20% higher.]

It was a well-equipped defense gear, but Tae-san's current shoes were too good, so he put it away in his inventory.

Tae-san advanced forward again. Since there were no special trials or NPCs on the 40th floor, he could reach the boss without any obstacles.

Clang.

[A shining golden knight appeared.]
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The boss, as his name suggested, was a golden knight who filled the room with the brilliance of armor.

The knight drew his sword and charged at Tai Shan.

Kaga!

40th floor. As the boss at the end of this floor, he was definitely strong. It was a formidable opponent that would require an ordinary adventurer to risk their life.

Kwa-jik.

Tai Shan struck his sword down. The knight blocked it with his sword and was knocked to the ground.

Tai Shan waved his hand.

[You activated the Frost Arrow.]

Dozens of arrows were drawn in mid-air.

They pierced the knight. A cracking sound and holes began to appear in the armor.

Thus, the knight fell.

This marked the end of the 40th floor.
Here is the translation of the text:

You have written a golden article that shines brightly. Your level has risen. Your ascension has been triggered. You have obtained the majestic pendant of the great one. And you have obtained [???]. You have reached the 40th floor. You have obtained the title "[Unstoppable One]". You have cleared the 40th floor perfectly. You have obtained the title "[One Who Cannot Be Satisfied]". You have perfectly cleared all floors up to the 40th and obtained the title "[One Who Has Laid the Foundation for Perfection]". You have reached a place that no one can deny. You have obtained the title "[One Who Is Acknowledged]". Your footsteps will now leave many traces and can serve as a guide for those who come after you. You have reached the entrance of the desired floor created by the creator of the labyrinth. As a reward, one benefit will be given to you.

The creator of the labyrinth, a mage who has reached this level, has appeared. I have seen this system gate at level 55. A being appeared together with it.

The floor tiles are rising from the ground, taking shape in mid-air as if solving a puzzle.

The administrator of the labyrinth, Valvatorez, has appeared.

Valvatorez moved his stone-like eyes.

"Have you forgotten?"

[I am a tool. I am a being who does not forget. I remember everything. And since only one person, not you, has reached this place recently, I remember it even more.]

The floor tiles clinked and collided, making a loud noise.

"Human, you have reached the floor that the mage wanted the adventurer to reach. I will give you a reward for it. Choose between treasure or valuable equipment."

"This time, you have few choices, don't you?"

"Don't ask me. It's the mage's will."

Treasure and equipment. It seemed like you would choose one of Gold and items. The Great Sage began to think.

Note: The text is a scene from a game or a novel, and some parts may be unclear or ambiguous.
Here is the translation of the text:

If I had to choose, I would have definitely chosen equipment until now. However, the level of equipment that Taesan is wearing is too high. Even if I tried to receive something ordinary and replace it, it would not make a significant difference, or I wouldn't be able to replace it if it's not worth it.

Taesan made a decision.

"For the sake of the treasure of the abyss."

Slowly, they surpassed the 40th floor. The goods at the shop would also change soon, so I thought of buying something that fits.

Balvabamba's eyes gleamed.

[Good. I will give you a treasure that is valuable to you, as per the will of the mage.] [You have obtained 90,421 gold.]

Wow, it's more gold than I expected. With this amount, I can buy the equipment I want at the shop.

Balvabamba said to Taesan, who was smiling satisfactorily.

[Then, keep going down. Human, you can reach the place your master wants you to go.]

"That's what I'm thinking."

The stones scattered again and turned into the floor. A ghost murmured.

[That numb guy is saying something like this... .]

Expectant words. Balvabamba, who had seen countless adventurers from the creation of the labyrinth, had never heard of Taesan's words, which were outside the norm.

Taesan began to check the floor-clearing rewards.
Here is the translation of the text:

"[The Necklace of a Great Person]" [A necklace that is merely decorated with gold and is extremely valuable. Its value is immeasurable.]

"Is it for sale?"

There was no price tag attached to it. It seemed like it was an item that was worth a value equivalent to a clear reward, and it was bought to be sold at a store.

"[I used it.] [I obtained a colorless ring.] [Colorless Ring] [Strength + 200] [Magic + 100] [Vigor + 30] [Agility + 30] [Intelligence + 30] [Attack Power + 30] [A colorless ring with no pattern or color. The user's identity and the ring's creator are unknown.]"

"Ah, oh!"

It was a very good ring.

Compared to the ring given to me by Baragan after completing the divine battle quest, the stats of this ring were lower. However, that's not because this ring was ordinary, but because Baragan had given me an extremely good ring.

Considering that this ring was usable until deep into the depths, it was a ring that could be used up to the 40th floor.

Tai-san replaced the ring with an attack power of 8 with the colorless ring.

And then, at the 40th floor, a theme was cleared, and a reward was obtained.
Here is the translation of the text:

**Title:** [Unstoppable One]

[You have reached the 40th floor without stopping, with an unbroken spirit and unwavering determination. Your attack power increases by 30, and your defense increases by 30.]

**Title:** [Unsatisfied One]

[Despite having settled down, you are still not satisfied and continue to venture into the unknown, seeking greater achievements. Your strength, agility, and intelligence increase by 60, and your attack power and defense increase by 20.]

**Title:** [One Who Has Reached Perfection]

[You have reached the 40th floor without leaving anything behind, a feat that is almost impossible. Your attack power and defense increase by 50.]

**Title:** [One Who Is Recognized]

[You have reached a place where your achievements are recognized by all, and no one can deny your abilities. Your attack power and defense increase by 40, and the prices of items in the shop decrease by 10%. You are also well-liked by NPCs and gods.]

**Special Active Skill:** [Piercing Defense]

[As you have increased your attack power, you have also obtained this skill.]

**The Ghost's Words:**

"It seems like you have increased your attack power quite a bit."

[There are limitations to increasing your attack power, so it's not a big deal to me.]

**Taesan's Current Stats:**

[Level: 88]
[Shield: 1599/1599]
[Health: 17920/17920]
[Mana: 2582/2582]
[Magical Power: 312/312]
[Strength: 4298]
[Intelligence: 3854]
[Agility: 4083]
[Attack Power: 809]
[Defense: 638]
[The target is in the best state.]

**This is Taesan's current stats.**

**He has already followed the growth curve of 1/3 of Itaeryeon.**

**And this is not the end.**

**There is also a skill attached to the title "One Who Is Recognized".**

**Special Active Skill:** [Piercing Defense]
**Mastery Level:** 1%
**Neglects the target's defense by 10%.**
Here is the translation of the text:

Defensive power decreased. It was a bit unexpected, but I guessed why it was given.

"Is it an advantage when fighting with adventurers from deeper places?"

The attack and defensive powers of the labyrinth are calculated by addition and subtraction. In other words, if the opponent's defensive power is higher than one's own attack power, it is impossible to deal damage. It's not that we couldn't attack at all, but it's not an easy difference to make up. Even Tai Shan, without the Ai Lai Mu skill, would have had to struggle to win.

"It was given later than expected."

[From now on, it's not just that we can't win, but we really can't win. The gap will become noticeable at this point.]

A different change from 40 floors and above.

I expected it. What item will I get and what skill will I acquire?

However, there was something that needed to be done before that.

I felt the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs. Tai Shan muttered to himself.

"I'll wait until the end of the check. Good."

"The most enjoyable time while descending the labyrinth, but I can't ruin it."

He was a man with black hair.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he looked, he still seemed a bit immature. Compared to the feeling of Tai Shan, he seemed to be around the same age as the Annetsha he met in Beixueseta.

He had a very listless expression. It was as if he didn't have the will to fight, and he waved his hand.

"It's great to meet you again."

"Okay."

Tai Shan replied calmly and looked at the demon.

The appearance was different from what Tai Shan had expected.

As one would expect from the guides of the sinful path, Tai Shan thought that the demon would immediately detect his hostility and attack as soon as he saw him. Therefore, he had prepared to activate all his skills as soon as he sensed any movement.

However, there was no apparent hostility from the demon in front of him.

"I truly dislike it. I dislike it."

On the contrary, a wave of negation was even visible.
