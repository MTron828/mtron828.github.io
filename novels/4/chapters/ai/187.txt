Chapter 188

188. 40th floor. The Child of the Ma Tribe (2)

"What are you doing? Ambreasia."

The Spirit King frowned on his face. In front of her, Ambreasia lay on the floor like a corpse.

Ambreasia opened her mouth without moving a muscle.

"There's no point, right? Let's just pass the time like this."

"You should have maintained your dignity in terms of strength."

"Dignity is nonsense."

Ambreasia grumbled and got up.

"How many times have we failed to break through the 74th floor? Now, even centuries are annoying. We're just wasting time doing meaningless things, so what's the point?"

They had never been able to break through the 74th floor since they arrived here. Now, they were too used to failure. The Spirit King also smiled wryly, understanding Ambreasia's mood.

"Don't be too discouraged. There's a child coming down from above, working hard. If we include that child, who knows what will happen?"

"...That guy."

Ambreasia frowned.

"Are you going to fight that guy who's favored by that Ma King?"

"Yes."
Here is the translation of the text:

The Spirit King nodded his head slightly.

"We've come to kill that person who opposes us. It's almost time to meet."

"Now that I think about it, is it okay? That person receives the favor of the God of War and is a demon, isn't he? If we combine our strength and fight together, what will happen?"

Ambresia's worried words were met with the Spirit King's nonchalant response.

"There's no need to worry. That person is foolish."

"Then you can say they're pure. They're too pitiful."

Ambresia spoke with a hint of annoyance.

"But a foolish person is still foolish. And they're clinging to the recognition we gave them. So, they made that kind of agreement."

"What...?"

Ambresia remained silent, unable to argue further.

"Don't you wonder why someone with such ability is so desperate?"

"People who lack ability don't understand those who have it. It's common for someone with the level of ability like Kwane to be oppressed and not receive recognition."

The Spirit King spoke calmly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"In fact, among the humans I had contracted with, there were humans like that. Most of them had destroyed the country they belonged to."

"Is that so?"

Ambresia looked puzzled. The Spirit King suddenly realized something.

"You see, you are a being from the world of Utopia. You wouldn't understand it."

"What... I came here because I didn't like it there."

Ambresia shook her head.

"Even if there's betrayal, it's okay, right? It's over when you die. Honestly, whether we win or lose is unknown to us."

As for the strength of Tai Shan, it's unknown because the demon blocked the information.

It's likely that the demon allowed the battle, but Ambresia thought so.

However, the Spirit King's expression did not change.

"That's not a problem. Even if Quanede dies, Quanede's power will return to us."

"...Really?"

Ambresia's eyes widened. The Spirit King spoke calmly.

"We made a contract. His power will be inherited by us even if he dies."

* * *

"Is that the adventure you're going to take against us?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The Great Mountain nodded his head. Even in the middle of conversation, his entire body was tense, as if he was prepared to respond to any sudden attack. Whenever his opponent might make a move, he had adjusted his physical condition to be ready.

"Ah..."

However, his opponent showed no such intentions.

The demon with black hair, worn out, let out a deep sigh.

"I am Quand. What's your name?"

"...Kang Tae-san."

"Kang Tae-san? That's a peculiar name."

Quand showed no signs of malice or hostility. Moreover, he did not assume a fighting stance.

As a result, Tae-san felt like a fool for being on high alert. Even if he activated his concept skill, he couldn't detect any hostility from Quand, so he relaxed his fighting stance.

Quand wiped his forehead.

"Honestly, I don't want to fight you."

"Then don't fight."

Tae-san also made an agreement with the demon in front of him and decided not to fight.

The demon had done many things for him. He had given him many favors and rewards, cutting down his territory and granting him many benefits.

Therefore, Tae-san felt gratitude towards him.

Given that the demon was pitiful, Tae-san didn't need to defeat him, and it wouldn't be a bad thing from his perspective either.
Here is the translation of the text:

"However, I can't do that. I'm a member of their group, after all. I really don't like it, but..."

Quanede took a deep breath and drew his sword.

Tai Shan couldn't help but feel puzzled by his attitude.

"If that's the case, why did you come in? You wouldn't have to come if you didn't want to, and they wouldn't be able to do anything even if you didn't."

Ma Shin was fond of his child. He had a deeper affection for Quanede, a demon, than anyone else. When he defeated the demon Jagan in the past, Ma Shin didn't pay much attention to it, but this time, he appeared directly and showed a worried expression.

If someone like that refused to join the guide, the upper echelons wouldn't be able to do anything.

Ma Shin said he wouldn't get involved in the affairs of mortals and the mysteries of the underworld, but mortals couldn't be reassured. If a demon's mood changed suddenly, all of them could die. If Quanede had refused strongly, they would have likely retreated willingly.

"...?"

Quanede clenched his teeth. Tai Shan raised his head in response to Quanede's unwilling expression.

"Then just step aside. Even if you refuse to fight, they won't be able to do anything."

"I'm sorry, but that's impossible."
Here is the translation of the text:

Quaned said gloomily, "I made a contract, didn't I? It's a contract that cannot be rejected if their orders are deemed reasonable."

"...Why do that?"

Tae-san was taken aback.

His expression showed that he didn't do it of his own accord. Quaned spoke as if he was protesting.

"I didn't know, I didn't know. I said that to fit in with the organization, that you have to do things like that. It's impossible for an organization member to defy the group's intention."

"That's true, but there's no reason to tie it up with a contract like that."

Quaned's expression turned suspicious, and he tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword.

"...Shut up."

The voice was barely a whisper, but Tae-san could hear it. He spat out his words.

It was clear why the demon was pitiful.

"[Even a mediocre person can break through with talent alone.]"

"Shut up."

Quaned spoke harshly.

Quaned was a mere existence with talent but no knowledge, no matter how well he was expressed.

A ghost burst out laughing.

"[I can guess what's going on. You're a human, not a demon, from outside. You didn't get treated like a demon, did you?]"
Here is the translation of the text:

Quaned's eyes flashed with a momentary tremor.

[Other people must have been afraid of you. You couldn't have a decent conversation with anyone and didn't receive any love. Did they believe that the reason people were afraid of themselves was because they were wrong?]

It was as if he had seen a ghostly figure, which began to wrinkle one by one. With each progression of the ghost's story, Quaned's pupils dilated greatly. Tai-san asked.

"What's the story?"

[It's not difficult. People are afraid of beings that are different from themselves. If someone has a level of talent that is beyond ordinary, maybe they won't know... But if someone has talent that can go deep into the labyrinth, that's inherently alien.]

Tai-san suddenly understood the meaning.

Inherently gifted, extremely talented individuals are often rejected. Even those who had been guiding the path of sin and were stuck in their own world considered themselves to be exceptional.

And even more exceptional, a talent that was beyond what they could comprehend.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I was similar too. Rumors spread that I was the descendant of a demon king. Although I was a member of a noble family and could use my strength to some extent, if I had been ordinary or poor, I would have been beaten by the same hardships. 

Maybe the ghost laughed at the thought of the hardships I would have faced.

People who haven't accomplished anything can't understand talent. There's no place where talent can grow, and their self-esteem is crushed. They enter a maze and realize that the outside world is strange. And they discover that they have talent, and that the outside world is wrong. In such a situation, they enter a maze and are praised by the powerful, feeling good. They meet people who recognize them.

A person who has never received love, who has never received anyone's love, meets someone who recognizes them.

These people, who have shown outstanding abilities in the maze, would feel even better. They're people who acknowledge my worth, so I feel like I'm a valuable person. So I just listened to what they said? Because that's what I need to make them happy. Because I feel like I'm worth something."

Note: This text appears to be a monologue or a passage from a novel, and the translation is done to the best of my abilities based on the context and the language used.
Quaned shut his mouth. His pupils were trembling violently.

From his demeanor, it was clear that the ghost's words were genuine. The ghost licked its lips.

[You've seen people like you before. They're always getting manipulated by those guys and getting devoured.]

Tai-san shot a cold gaze at Quaned. Quaned bowed his head deeply.

[It's not a rare story. Even talented people can't help but make mistakes. It's surprising how often people get caught up in the wrong things and get hurt. Even if they survive, their personalities are often distorted. But that's the way it is.]

"Shut up."

Quaned said gloomily.

"What are you trying to get from me with that kind of talk? It's all over with."

[There's nothing special about it. I just said it because I was thinking about the past. If you're given a chance, don't make a mistake then.]

The ghost's voice was laced with a sense of unease.

"Whatever happens... I have to fight according to the contract."

In an instant, Quaned's aura changed towards him.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just like a rock that has stood firm for thousands of years, the stalwart giant had a majestic aura. Tai Shan also straightened his posture.

The young monk, who had looked naive and innocent, suddenly disappeared.

[It's good to be careful.]

The ghost whispered softly.

[Of course, the young monk in front of us is foolish and innocent and doesn't know anything at all... but he's also hinting at something else.]

Despite his shortcomings, he has surpassed 50 floors and received recognition from the upper echelons, and even received permission to go deep.

This meant that he had the ability to overcome his deficiencies.

The battle began. Quan and Tai Shan moved at the same time.

* * *

When Tai Shan saw Quan moving, he felt a sense of clarity for the first time.

The adventurers before him had been awkward and awkward. They were certainly strong and fast, but there were still gaps in their movements.

However, the young monk in front of him showed no gaps. He approached Tai Shan like a flowing stream, unsheathing his sword.

Kaaaaah!

The swords clashed, producing a loud sound. It was the loudest collision sound Tai Shan had ever heard.

And it was strong.

Tai Shan was pushed back, ever so slightly.

It's because of this.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tàishān put his foot between the legs of Kwaneudae and pushed his body forward to restrict Kwaneudae's movement.

Kwaneudae did not retreat, but instead responded by butting his knees against Tàishān.

The two were unable to move their swords freely. Tàishān tried to strike Kwaneudae's jaw with his elbow. Kwaneudae quickly drew his sword and used his palm to block Tàishān's elbow, then pulled out his dagger and stabbed his side.

Tàishān dodged by twisting his body.

He moved his other hand to strike the hilt, and Kwaneudae blocked the attack with his sword.

Ka ka ka!

The two did not use any skills, but only relied on physical movements to respond. It was like a reconnaissance mission.

As a result, they could sense each other's intentions.

"'Strong.'"

Tàishān thought to himself, "Kwaneudae is really strong."

He did not feel any openings or weaknesses in Kwaneudae's movements, unlike the guides he had faced before.

Kwaneudae's movements were perfectly coordinated, and he even counterattacked. There were no gaps or openings to be seen. He was superior to the guides he had faced so far.

And Kwaneudae was surprised in a way that was unique to Kwaneudae.

"'Did I block your attack?'
Here is the translation of the text:

He had been descending to the lower levels with permission from the upper echelons, and naturally, he was a thorn in the side of each guide. However, no one dared to touch him, for he had been directly authorized by the upper echelons.

Of course, there was no collision. As long as he was backed by the upper echelons, no one dared to provoke him.

But looking at him with anger and resentment in his eyes, Conan felt puzzled.

Why did he use such great power to get angry with me?

From Conan's perspective, all the guides except the upper echelons were weak. If he had really fought, he wouldn't have been able to resist and would have been killed by those pitiful creatures.

So, he didn't take the guides' orders to fight seriously. He just thought that he was a bit stronger than them.

But it wasn't that way.

Taisan was really strong. Conan was a 51st floor adventurer. He had explored the labyrinth and gained many things, so he was far above the average adventurer.

However, Taisan did not yield even when they fought on the 40th floor.

This was a shocking event for Conan, who looked down on all adventurers except the upper echelons.

Wow!

The shoulders of the two men collided, and the distance between them grew wider. After a brief stalemate, a ghost blew a whistle.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Despite being inexperienced, I have the strength to survive. Am I really strong? Compared to my past self, I don't think I'm too bad. I've got one talent, at least.]

It was a dangerous battle. I couldn't be certain of winning.

However, there was a smile on the tip of the mountain's nose.

The ghost who saw the smile nodded its head.

[That's right.]

"That's it. I've been too boring so far."

This place is a solo mode. It's a labyrinth that summons outstanding warriors and fighters from various worlds.

Given the theme, all the adventurers who appeared were too ordinary.

From the perspective of the outside world, they were undoubtedly strong, but in the labyrinth, they were all weaklings who couldn't even make it down. They were all failures who couldn't even make it down.

He had gambled with his life many times while descending the labyrinth, but he had never had a guide from a higher level. No matter how great the gap was, he could easily win.

The leaders were so different that it didn't even cross their minds.

But then, a truly exceptional adventurer appeared before his eyes.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Reaching to the depths, advancing to the conquest of the labyrinth.

There is someone who possesses the talent and strength to conquer the labyrinth, and they are fighting with him.

"But I'm the one who will win."

The Tai Shan (a mythical mountain) has bestowed strength upon him."
