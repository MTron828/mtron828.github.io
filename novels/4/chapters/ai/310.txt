**Chapter 311**

**311. The Fifth Return, Earth (7)**

The monsters continue to appear.

Their numbers are increasing, and they're getting stronger. The number of people dying is also increasing, and the battlefield is slowly being pushed back.

And Taesan is still fighting the monsters at the front lines.

**Whoosh!**

He stomps his foot. The ground collapses, and the monsters' bodies fall into the underground. He swings his sword and cuts them down, then stomps his foot again.

[You have activated acceleration.] [You have activated skill acceleration.]

**Whooooosh!**

His accelerated body, like a bullet, pierces through the monsters.

Dozens of monsters disappear in an instant.

Cheers erupt from the surroundings.

"Lord Taesan!"

"Ooh! Please protect us!"

Among those who worship Taesan, there are also Chinese players. A considerable number of them show reverence and admiration towards Taesan.

[The proficiency of Divine Power has increased by 1%.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The divine power also began to rise slowly. Already, a considerable number of Chinese players had faith in Taishan. Naturally, most of them were easy mode players.

Chinese easy mode players had been given the title of 'Nobi' and had lived like slaves. They worshipped Jinyong because he had overwhelming power. It was nothing more or less than that.

But Taishan showed even greater power. Moreover, unlike Jinyong, he protected himself.

It was only natural that their faith would shift.

Nobi-ranked players shared stories about Taishan among themselves. The stories spread, and even those who had never seen Taishan began to believe in him.

Meanwhile, Minerva and Valkyrie were also scattered across the battlefield, defeating monsters.

The power they displayed was also monstrous, and their faith in their master, Taishan, grew even stronger.

Jinyong watched this trend with a scowl.

"Insignificant things."

He wanted to kill them all, but he couldn't. They were still following Jinyong's orders, not interacting with players from other countries."

Note: 'Nobi' is a term used in the context of online games, particularly in Korea and China, to refer to players who are considered weak or inferior. It is often used in a derogatory manner.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They didn't directly defy the rules, but simply worshiped the Taesan. They couldn't be carelessly touched.

But emotions were boiling over.

Their anger and frustration towards the Taesan grew even stronger. The True Dragon, who had defeated monsters and returned to its heavenly abode, called out to the players.

"What's the reason for calling us, Your Majesty?"

According to the True Dragon's orders, the hard-mode players who had arrived at its abode swallowed their saliva.

They were not as strong as the True Dragon's elite guards, but they were proud of their own strength. In reality, even the True Dragon's elite guards couldn't easily defeat them.

However, they were now trembling with fear. There was a rumor circulating among the nobles that those who had gone to meet the True Dragon had not returned.

People dismissed it as a baseless rumor, saying they must have died fighting monsters, but deep down, they couldn't help but feel fear.

The True Dragon on the throne spoke to them.

"Become mine."

Power erupted.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A powerful force engulfed the tent. They tried to flee in terror, but it was no use. Without any resistance, they were all crushed by the force of the True Dragon.

Rumble.

The sound of something being devoured echoed, and the force was withdrawn.

The power of the hard-mode players he had devoured was now mixed within him.

"Ugh..."

The True Dragon, having gathered his strength, shook his head. His head hurt as if it would crack. Every time he devoured a life, he felt a wave of nausea.

The True Dragon calmed his headache and unleashed his power.

The explosive force that burst forth was significantly stronger than before.

With this power...

The True Dragon revealed his true form.

But even so, it was still not enough.

[Gang Tae-san activated Marbas's Black Wave.]

The black wave, which seemed to engulf the entire world, trampled and crushed all the monsters.

Everyone's gaze was fixed on Tae-san. They exclaimed in admiration and astonishment.

Meanwhile, the True Dragon, who had just destroyed dozens of monsters with a single blow, was completely forgotten.

The True Dragon's face stiffened.

People's faith was gradually shifting towards Tae-san.

And the proficiency of his divine power visibly increased, reaching 60%.

* * *
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**[Divine Power] [Proficiency: 60%] [God's Power. It originally had no meaning, but with the faith of many people, it became divine. The faith and devotion of people can have a significant impact on the world.]**

"It's faster than I thought."

I had expected it to take 60%, but it's only been 4 days since we started the quest. As expected, the number of Chinese players is overwhelming, and the growth rate is incredibly fast.

Kim Hwi-yeon, who was taking a break, approached Taesan, who was checking his skills.

"Mr. Taesan, what are you doing?"

"Checking my skills."

"Your skills?"

Instead of answering, Taesan raised his hand.

**Keying**.

A golden light appeared above Taesan's hand. Kim Hwi-yeon's eyes widened in surprise.

"What...?"

The light itself was not surprising. The starlight arrow's light that Taesan had shown before was so bright it could burn one's eyes.

On the other hand, the golden light now was weak and seemed like it could fade away at any moment.

But Kim Hwi-yeon was surprised for a different reason.

"Where's the activation window?"

When using a skill, a system window always appears before activation. But now, Taesan had clearly created a golden light with his skill, yet the activation window did not appear.

"And..."

Kim Hwi-yeon stared at the golden light in a daze.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's an extremely fragile, tiny light that seems like it would go out if you touched it with your hand.

But in Kim Hwi-yeon's heart, something swelled up as she gazed at the light.

A pure sense of reverence. And a feeling of faith was born. She wanted to bow her head and worship towards the light.

There was no coercion.

It was just that her heart wanted to do so.

'...What is that? I've never seen it before.'

It's not a common skill. A sensation she had never felt before was felt in that golden light.

Taesan replied.

'Your faith. To be precise, it's not the first time.'

Rakiratas and Mashin had descended upon the earth. But Kim Hwi-yeon was too weak to fully sense their divinity, so she thought it was the first time she was seeing it.

'What? What's...'

Kim Hwi-yeon, who didn't understand at the moment, tried to ask again, but shut her mouth.

'...People's faith?'

'You understand quickly.'

'Heh.'

Kim Hwi-yeon let out a dry laugh.

'I don't believe it. Is that originally possible?'

'Originally, it would be impossible, but I'm an exception.'"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He obtained divine power by defeating the angel of God in the Berserker Set. Therefore, he could gather people's faith and combine their power.

If it weren't for that, the power of people's faith would have been scattered and lost like the True Dragon.

Then, what could be done with this golden light?

Taesan looked at Kim Hwi-yeon. She had a tired face and her entire body was trembling slightly.

"Are you here to rest?"

"Ah, yes. I'm a bit exhausted."

She flexed her arm. Kim Hwi-yeon, along with other Korean El'ons and hardcore players, were fighting monsters with all their might. They must have come to rest after barely holding out against the monsters until their physical limits.

"Just stay still."

Taesan sent the golden light to her. A faint pillar of light enveloped her entire body.

"What are you... uh?"

Kim Hwi-yeon's eyes widened in surprise.

Her darkened complexion began to take on a pinkish hue, and her twitching muscles stopped trembling.

Her exhausted mind regained its energy, and her strength was replenished.

"Uh..."

And her physical strength, which had been depleted from the battle, was restored.

Kim Hwi-yeon was extremely surprised.

"No, this is..."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was almost no way to recover from physical and mental exhaustion unless you leveled up or drank the water from the labyrinth's spring.

Taesan gazed at her transformation with interest, just like Taesan.

"Is this a recovery of physical strength and fatigue? It doesn't seem to be a full recovery."

Unlike when you leveled up, not all physical strength and fatigue were recovered. However, you could fight again.

After checking on Kim Hwi-yeon, Taesan once again manifested his divinity. The golden light appeared, but it was weaker than before.

"I won't be able to use it often."

The amount was limited, and the consumption value also varied depending on the strength of the target receiving the divinity. If it was at Kim Hwi-yeon's level, it wouldn't be a problem even with a hundred people, but at Taesan's level, it would almost be depleted with just one use.

As time passed while receiving faith, it would replenish again, but it would take a considerable amount of time.

However, even considering that, it was a magnificent power. During the labyrinth battle, it was difficult to find an opportunity to use a potion. But with divinity, you could recover your physical strength at least once.

The specific effects would need to be confirmed after entering the labyrinth, but it was magnificent. The ghost also let out a cheer."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A guy who hasn't even reached the level of divinity granted by the gods is handling it like it's nothing. This is really ironic."

"Amazing, Taesan...,"

Kim Hwi-yeon muttered in awe.

"You're really a god of the earth."

Even Kim Hwi-yeon, who didn't think of Taesan as a god, felt a sense of reverence.

Seeing her reaction, Taesan stroked his chin.

Her reaction showed that divinity was a power that inspired reverence and worship just by being seen.

Then, what would happen if he used his divinity on the battlefield?

The thought was fleeting, and the action was swift. Taesan used his divinity to defeat the monsters, spreading its power. Those who were exhausted and about to collapse on the front lines regained their vitality with the golden light.

"Oooo!"

"Oh, God! Oh, God!"

People wailed in the golden light. Their physical strength was restored, and their fatigue disappeared. And they felt an overwhelming sense of reverence emanating from the light.

Even those who had doubted Taesan's power bowed their heads in reverence when they saw his divinity. Their faith grew stronger.

"Master, if it's like this, we might be able to get a proper divinity after all."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Minerva, who had been watching, was laughing so hard that she was about to cry, as the divinity of Taesan was growing stronger by the minute.

And when Jinryong heard the news, he was on the verge of going crazy.

"Shut up!"

Jinryong yelled harshly at the person who had brought him the news, his body trembling with rage.

"I'm sorry, I apologize! Please forgive me!"

"You should die for your sin!"

The power surged out of control.

The pale-faced person was swallowed up by Jinryong's anger.

"Hah, hah."

Jinryong let out a rough breath. There was no one around him. Even those who had always flattered him and stayed by his side had begun to distance themselves from him as he grew more and more violent.

Gritting his teeth.

Jinryong was furious.

The gaze of the people around him, which had once been filled with respect and admiration, was now filled with fear and distrust.

That was unbearable for Jinryong.

"How dare you!"

Those foolish people!

They had forgotten who had protected them all this time, and were now relying on such power!

The power that was mixed within him was slowly consuming his mind.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Jinryong was going crazy little by little.

He was still maintaining his sanity on a thin line, but even that was nearing its limit.

He had devoured even his own elite guards, whom he had personally selected to protect himself.

Although he had become stronger and swept away the monsters, the fear people had towards him only grew greater. Just yesterday, his elite guards, who had been by his side, had received Jinryong's call and ascended to the heavens, never to return.

Until now, he had been able to control himself to some extent, but now he had lost all reason to judge himself.

As the days passed, rumors about the disappeared players spread.

And so, time passed, and the final day arrived.

The monsters did not appear. It was eerily quiet, as if everything had come to an end.

But no one was happy about it.

Instead, they were fearful and quietly gripped their weapons.

And then, the portal opened.

Dark and dense portals appeared endlessly beyond the battlefield.

'Everyone, get ready!'"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Kim Hwi-yeon shouts loudly. The divided passageway expands, and monsters appear.

[Monster 351 has appeared.] [Monster 121 has appeared.] [Monster 945 has appeared.]

Dozens of A-grade monsters reveal themselves. People's faces turn pale. Although they don't know the strength corresponding to the numbers, they can feel the immense power emanating from the monsters.

Kuuuung!

And the earth shakes.

A gigantic, black-skinned giant appears, like a mountain.

With a club in one hand, the giant looks down at the humans and opens its mouth.

[——-!]

A scream echoes. People cover their ears and writhe in agony. Their trained bodies, tempered in the labyrinth, tremble and falter.

[Monster 14 has appeared.]

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
