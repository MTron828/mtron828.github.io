Chapter 351

351. 74th Floor, the Battlefield of the Immortals (4)

The guides of evil confronted each other.

Should they fight Taesan or hide and wait for him to pass by? Many emotions clashed.

After a discussion that involved physical strength, a decision was made.

"Shall we call the demon and have a direct conversation?"

"Yes."

The young man with the arrogant expression and platinum hair nodded his head.

"It's not difficult to escape from Taesan, who's coming down to this place. That's not the important issue."

They could use the secret key to jump floors or hide in the vast floor. Hiding from Taesan wasn't that hard.

"But my pride doesn't allow it."

The young man was from a royal family that had a legendary bloodline, said to have received divine blood from outside. Although his bloodline didn't have divine power, his pride was extremely high due to the brainwashing-like education he received from a young age.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You can't run away from something like that. But, calmly analyzing it, I realize I can't beat him."

"Is it okay to push with numbers, is it a matter of pride?"

"There's no need to fight seriously against something like that. The superiority of numbers is also a clear advantage."

The young man said confidently.

"So, let's call the demon and resolve the restriction."

Only those who have been permitted by the demon can fight against Taesan, and this restriction is lifted.

The Lion King looked at him with an ambiguous expression.

"Will the demon consider us?"

"There's no way to know without trying."

The young man opened his mouth.

"Even if it's the demon, it can't kill us. We're adventurers who have descended into the labyrinth they created. There's no harm in checking the possibility."

It wasn't a wrong statement. Even though the gods disliked them, they could descend into the labyrinth without any problems because they were adventurers.

"Do as you please. The conclusion is up to you."

More than half of the people present shared the young man's opinion. The reality that one couldn't win against Taesan one-on-one, and the pride of those who had reached the depths, collided and led to this outcome.

They prepared to call the demon.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The young man offered many tributes and equipment, and shouted towards the sky.

"Please come! Great existence! We will offer you tributes!"

Rustling.

Space collapses. A powerful existence descends upon this place, fitting the tributes and call.

The guides bowed their heads.

"We pay our respects to the great god!"

The voice echoes. The god, who has appeared, waves his hand as if bothered.

[You know why I've been called, so let's get to the point.]

"……I see."

The young man swallowed his saliva and slowly opened his mouth.

"God, you have placed a restriction between us and Taesan, the adventurer favored by you."

If they're not at a level where they can kill each other, a battle cannot take place.

It's because of that restriction that we've been fighting Taesan one by one.

"But we can no longer fight him alone. You have given him many advantages with the restriction. So, we beg of you. Please grant our request."

[You're good with words. Go on.]

The god spoke lazily. The young man took a deep breath and brought up the main topic.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Please, I deeply wish that you would release the restraints between him and me. Oh, God."

[Hmm.]

The young man's words made God gaze at him with a puzzled expression.

The young man's chest tightened with tension.

God opened his mouth.

[Good.]

"Will you, will you grant my request?"

The young man's eyes widened in surprise. He had made the proposal, but he hadn't expected it to be accepted so easily. He had thought it would take countless offerings and pleas to get it accepted.

[It's not a big deal if you accept that kind of proposal. It's not a major issue anymore. Do as you please.]

With that, God disappeared.

The young man, relieved of his tension, sat down. He twisted his lips.

"......It's done."

The restraints were lifted.

He jumped up.

"It's over. Now I just need to kill him."

The young man's words made a few guides' eyes sparkle.

However, there were also those who refused.

"I don't want to fight him."

It was the man who had previously clashed with the Lion King.

While more than half of them wanted to fight Taesan, there were also a significant number of people who refused to fight and chose to flee.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He is an existence like a tsunami. There's no need to deliberately choose to oppose him. Just hide your appearance and wait for the tsunami to pass, and then you can break through the labyrinth again."

"Do as you please. Cowards."

The young man sneered at them.

"What are you going to do?"

The young man asked the Lion King. The Lion King scowled.

"...It's strange. The demon king accepted too easily."

The demon king favors Taesan.

Even if it's a desperate battle to the death, dying under the overwhelming violence of the demon king's power is not what the demon king desires.

Yet, the demon king's acceptance means that even without any restrictions, Taesan has a chance of winning.

"I don't know. Maybe the demon king has lost interest in the current Taesan. Gods are all capricious, after all."

"Hmm."

The Lion King took a step back.

"I won't get involved in this battle."

"Do as you please. We'll win anyway."

There was not a single trace of anxiety on the young man's face.

It's a joint attack by several adventurers who have reached the depths. No matter how strong Taesan is, he believes they can't win.

The Lion King looked at Sosiet.

"What are you going to do? Will you cooperate with them?"

"I'm the same as you."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She spoke bluntly.

"I'll prepare in my own way."

She smiled quietly, the first smile she had shown since the warrior's death.

"I've come this far."

With a bright voice, she muttered to herself, then asked the Lion King.

"What will you do?"

"I'll find my own way too."

The Lion King replied, a gemstone held in his hand.

Ambresia watched them with a thoughtful expression.

* * *

The broken machinery began to operate, and the immortal's remains started to move.

[Why is it moving?]

The ghost was also shocked. The immortal had clearly died a long time ago. Taesan examined the immortal calmly.

'The black pillar that fell from the sky.'

The moment it touched the immortal, the immortal opened its eyes.

An unusual power could be felt emanating from the immortal in front of them.

"It's the divine punishment."

During the process of recovering its power, the divine punishment had intervened, making the immortal's remains its puppet.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan gazed up at the sky. Beyond the sky, the transcenders and the divine beings had begun to clash. It seemed like there was no time to spare.

The immortal, who had opened his eyes, was targeting Taesan right in front of him.

But there was no will within him.

[Ugh...].

The ghost let out a sigh. Immortal. The current Taesan was an opponent who couldn't be defeated.

[How can I find an opening and escape into the labyrinth?]

It was a reasonable suggestion, but Taesan didn't back down.

He quietly gazed at the immortal who had risen.

"There's no will."

He was already a being who had died. The divine being had forcefully connected its power to Taesan, making him a puppet to control.

"And it's broken."

The immortal's remains were literally torn apart.

It was hard to find an intact part, and the power bursting out was extremely unstable.

Even if Taesan's boundary reaction was shaken, it wouldn't break, and that was clear.

With an opponent like that, he could win.

"I can't turn my back on those who only look for openings."

[You activated the Apocalypse [Darkness and Chaos].]

Taesan activated all sorts of buff skills.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It erases the boundary rebound that had been wrapped around its body. Taesan's skill level is not high enough to handle a head-on confrontation with an immortal.

As soon as the boundary rebound is erased, a massive pressure tries to engulf Taesan.

The fragments of the immortal that were scattered throughout this world were collected by the transcendent, but the immortal in front of Taesan is exerting pressure on him. He can endure it, but a prolonged battle will be difficult.

Let's end this as quickly as possible.

Damn it.

Taesan charged towards the immortal.

The connection of the divine punishment linked to the broken immortal is extremely unstable. It seemed like just one proper strike would be enough to take it down.

Of course, a normal strike wouldn't be able to deal any damage to the immortal.

It was clear that anything less than a sacred, black, or boundary-level attack wouldn't work.

Kiiiiing!

The power of the immortal, which had been in a boundary state, was activated to suppress Taesan.

The command of the divine punishment engraved on the immortal's relic was simple.

Subdue the enemy in front of you.

The power explodes.

Dozens of beams of light destroy the earth and erase space.

The speed was so fast that Taesan couldn't respond in time. As soon as he saw the power explosion, he jumped, but the beam pierced his leg."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Your first attack absolute nullification has been activated.]

"This speed is decent."

Although the first attack nullification was consumed, it allowed me to grasp the extent of the Immortal's power and speed.

"It's a close call."

Even if I tried to dodge the moment I sensed the power, I couldn't guarantee that I would avoid it.

The beam of light started pouring down again, and Taesan spread his wings.

[You have activated a selfish choice.] [You have activated the perfect fairy's wings.] [You have activated skill acceleration.]

Taesan accelerated. His speed was so extreme that even the Guide of Evil couldn't keep up.

But the opponent was an Immortal.

Exactly, the power poured down towards Taesan. The earth trembled, a tsunami formed, and a rainbow-colored beam of light poured down, blocking the path.

[You have activated distortion.]

You distorted space. You bent the trajectory of the beam in a different direction.

Kkkkddd.

The Immortal's power even pierced through the distorted space. The distortion was destroyed, and the beam charged towards Taesan.

Taesan also knew that he couldn't block it with distortion. What he needed was just a little more time.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You activated Limited Blink.] [You activated Aerial Leap.] [You activated Acceleration.] [You activated Skill Acceleration.]

Taesan's body suddenly flew towards the Immortal.

The Immortal slightly flinched its body.

The power within the Immortal burst out, sweeping everything in its surroundings.

[You activated the Aegis Shield, which grants you invincibility for 1 second, but you can only move.]

Aegis Shield, a skill that ignores all damage and allows you to approach the Immortal's power.

But the moment it touched the shockwave, Taesan's body was pushed back far away.

"Ugh!"

Taesan hastily put away the shield and swung his sword down. The sword's energy burst out and collided with the shockwave.

Taesan, who landed on the ground, scowled.

"Is this shockwave just meant to push me back?"

The Absolute Protection, Attack Nullification, and Aegis Shield, all skills that activate when attacked and take damage. In other words, they don't activate against a simple, damage-less shockwave.

Kiiiiing!

A beam of light poured down.

Taesan moved his wings and quickly dodged the attack by flying away.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

There was no room to spare. He had to use all his strength to avoid the overwhelming power.

The Immortal's entire body shone brightly.

Dozens of missiles poured out from that place. Even if Taesan tried to dodge, they flew straight at him with precision.

Taesan gathered his strength. Since the Transcender had collected the scattered fragments of the Immortal, there was no problem with manifesting his power.

[You activated Magic Overlap.]

You overlapped the frozen world and the starlight arrow, and released it.

The cold and light collided with the missiles.

The light burst forth, dyeing the world.

A red dot was embedded in Taesan's chest amidst the clash of powers.

Taesan reflexively activated his skill.

[You activated Random Blink.]

Taesan's body jumped through space, and an explosion erupted at the spot where the red dot had been.

The explosion that occurred was extremely powerful, capable of covering Taesan who had jumped through space.

[You activated Calamity's Ember.]

A flame of destruction arose, colliding with the explosion's aftermath and devouring each other, disappearing in the process.

Kiiiiing!

The beam of light attacked again. Taesan gritted his teeth and moved his body.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Everything is burning, and space is starting to distort.

An overwhelming, pure power that cannot be approached. It's an opponent who is difficult to even dodge, let alone counterattack.

There was no clear will visible in the immortal. It was moving according to the reactions programmed into its body.

Still, the opponent was an immortal. It was a being that had transcended mortality.

But.

'I can win.'

Only one attack had been nullified.

Magi and mana still had some leeway.

The possibilities were sufficient.

Taesan opened his mouth.

'Stop.'

[You have activated the Declaration of Stop.]"

Note: "Magi" and "mana" are likely terms from a fantasy or game-like setting, and may not have direct English equivalents. I've left them untranslated to preserve the original context.
