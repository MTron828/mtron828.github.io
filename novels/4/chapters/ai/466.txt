**Episode 467**

467. 88th Floor, Those Who Want to Become Gods (6)

The ash-colored realm descends upon the world.

At the same time, their realm, which was built over hundreds of years of battle, begins to collapse.

[What, what is this.]

This ash color couldn't be considered part of this world.

It was heterogeneous. It was a realm where all laws and order did not apply.

[You have activated the Great Collapse [Rejection].]

A black sphere materializes in the world and flies towards Paragum. Paragum hastily defends its entire body.

Kuuuuuuung!

"Kkeeeeurk!"

But it can't be blocked.

The black sphere pierces through the defense and deals a blow to his essence.

"Uuuuh!"

He tries to withstand the shock by resonating with the power of the earth. However, the land, which has been consumed by the ash color, does not follow his will. Paragum's authority begins to malfunction.

"This is ridiculous…….”

[Wow! Wow! It's a crazy thing to say!]

Keboruak flails his wings wildly. He's thinking of gathering the energy of the sky and blowing the ash color away.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But the energy didn't gather. It was as if the world was blocked by a curtain, unable to resonate with him.

The sensation that was discarded in the cradle covered them.

Thud.

And the master of the ash-colored realm, Taesan, approached them.

Paragup's eyes trembled. His emotions, which had always been suppressed, surged like a wave.

"U, uaaaah!"

He couldn't withstand the fear and charged forward. Keboruak also spread his wings, trembling all over, and rushed towards Taesan.

Taesan welcomed them with a swing of his sword.

Kwaaaang!

The battle unfolded. The two, whose domain had been erased, panicked and couldn't respond normally.

"There's nothing left to save."

Taesan decided to finish them off.

[You activated the frozen world [Chaos].]

Zzzt!

The ash-colored chill enveloped the immortals. Despite their panic, their instincts tried to respond to Taesan's attack.

But it was futile. The ash-colored energy broke through their defenses, nullifying their powers and striking at their essence.

"Kk."

"Ugh, ugh."

They couldn't even scream properly. Unhealing wounds remained on their bodies and souls.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"At the same time, the Chaos Realm was extinguished.

The gray world that had swallowed the hole disappeared from sight.

'...This is unbelievable.'

Taesan, who had checked the consumption value, let out a hollow laugh.

The Chaos Realm he had unfolded was only about one or two kilometers in diameter, and even that was limited to within the hole, a very narrow range in terms of the entire world.

But with that alone, he was able to reveal the black and divine power he possessed.

'It's not a power that can be used recklessly.'

But the effect was certain. The gray realm covered the world, erasing the realm that the immortals had possessed in an instant. The immortals, who had been fighting somehow, could no longer resist.

The battle was over.

It was Taesan's overwhelming victory.

Taesan approached the immortals who were frozen in ice, looking at him with dull faces.

'You shouldn't exist in this world...'

Paraguide spat out the words with difficulty."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He had seen the Transcendents a few times before. Therefore, he knew to some extent about their power and realm. He was familiar with that kind of thing.

But the power that Taesan showed was unlike anything he had ever seen.

It couldn't be called the power of a Transcendent. It was something entirely different, something that didn't belong to this world.

"You're... a being that destroys the universe. You shouldn't exist..."

He muttered to himself, looking like a person who had lost his soul.

Taesan didn't react and placed his sword on his chest. Taesan slightly lifted the remaining divine energy and blackness.

The ash-colored energy touched Paragup's chest.

But Taesan didn't thrust the sword. Paragup, who had resigned himself to death, stared blankly at Taesan.

The ash-colored energy began to seep into Paragup's entire body.

At that moment, Paragup felt a chill run down his spine.

Something mixed and unclear touched the deepest part of him.

The strange thing was touching his very essence.

"Stop, stop."

He had resigned himself to death, but an unbearable fear still overwhelmed him.

"Stop, please don't... I beg of you..."

He trembled and pleaded.

Taesan, who had been watching him for a moment, withdrew the ash-colored energy.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The boundary line distorts and shatters the laws of the world. It could eliminate the contamination of the singular, divine being that had absorbed the transcendent being.

Then, with the boundary line, the authority of the immortal being.

Could it not erase itself?

Could it not forcibly bring down the authority of the immortal being and erase it?

It was not an impossible story. After all, the Chaos Realm had temporarily erased the realm created by these beings.

So, Taesan tested the paralyzed Paragup.

But it was impossible.

It seemed that it was not allowed to reach the deepest part, as if it was blocked.

"This won't do."

But at the same time, Taesan realized that it was not impossible.

Although it was still a distant story, there was a possibility.

After finishing the confirmation, Taesan sheathed his sword.

Paragup, even as it was dying, had a relieved expression.

[Your spiritual power has increased. Permanently…….] [Your spiritual power has increased. You have obtained the soul skill [Treader of the Earth].]

And Bardley and Akasha also underwent a change. The two of them let out a small sigh as they felt the enormous power dwelling within them.

Taesan also took care of the unconscious Keboruak."

Note: There may be some nuances or cultural references that are lost in translation, but I've tried to provide an accurate and natural-sounding translation.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Your divine power has been activated. Permanently…….] [Your divine power has been activated. You have obtained the soul skill [Lord of the Sky].]"

"It's over."

The two immortals, who had been opposing each other for hundreds of years and causing suffering to the world, finally met their deaths.

* * *

Taesan emerged victorious against the combined forces of the two immortals.

Moreover, he didn't suffer any significant damage. Despite experimenting with various tactics during the battle, his victory was overwhelming.

And this was despite him being in a very unstable state after just becoming a transcendent.

"Overwhelming, indeed."

Once you reach the level of a transcendent, the gap between you and an immortal is fundamentally different.

However, even Taesan, who had transcended, couldn't reach the level of the top-tier transcendants. Taesan, who had a boundary, was clearly an irregular, but that alone couldn't bridge the gap.

Gradually getting stronger had its limits.

Something big needed to change.

And Taesan had the things that could bring about that change.

For now, he was thinking about how to utilize them, but to some extent, he had a plan in place.

After taking a moment to organize his thoughts, Taesan checked his skills.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Soul Skill: Treader of the Earth] [Proficiency: 1%] [One who steps on the earth and stands on it. When standing on the earth, one can synchronize with the earth and make a part of the world their own. The longer one stays in one place, the stronger the influence becomes.]

[Soul Skill: Lord of the Sky] [Proficiency: 1%] [One who dominates the sky. When the body leaves the earth and takes its place in the sky, one can control the sky at will. Additionally, one can fly freely in the sky without any restrictions. The longer one flies in the sky, the stronger the influence becomes.]

The two immortals' characteristics were the earth and the sky. Except for these two, there was no significant difference.

Taesan focused his mind and stepped on the earth. Then, the earth began to synchronize with Taesan.

Rumble!

The earth rose up and wrapped around Taesan's entire body like armor.

"This is the feeling."

Just by stepping on the earth, the power was activated. The conditions for activation were not difficult, and there was no significant consumption of energy.

Paragup used this power to create an infinitely recoverable armor.

Taesan couldn't handle it to that extent, but it was a power that provided significant help in defense.

And Keboruak's power was extremely efficient. Taesan stomped his foot. His body rose into the sky.

As he focused his mind, he could fly freely in the sky like a bird.

Until now, he had to use the wings of the fairy to fly, but now he could move freely in the air without activating the skill.

And he could use the energy of the sky to freely control the wind and accelerate his body.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Both skills had no consumption value. Since they were activated in opposite areas, it wasn't difficult to utilize them. It was a useful authority.

And because I was facing an immortal-level strong enemy, Bardray's attack power increased significantly.

[The Prince of the Destroyed World: Bardray] [The Empire of the Destroyed World. The Prince of Kabert. Bardray. He was reborn with a sword as his physical body.] [Attack Power + 3012]

His attack power increased by 150 in an instant.

Akasha also underwent some kind of change.

[No... this is... no...]

"What's going on?"

Akasha was muttering to himself, his voice filled with confusion. After a brief pause, Akasha spoke in a bewildered tone.

[Enemy. Ally. Chaos... everything is mixed up. My memories... my memories...]

Akasha let out a pained sigh as he spoke.

"Just... just wait a moment. I need to sort things out.]

"Okay."

Taesan left Akasha alone.

The quest was over. Taesan used the authority of the Lord of the Sky to exit.

"Oh, oh, oh!"

The people waiting outside were overjoyed and cheered when they saw Taesan's figure."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Those who forced their faith upon you have disappeared.

Taesan said to them. People bowed their heads in respect and reverence.

"I will leave. This world is entirely yours. Harmonize with each other, and sometimes compete to make the world peaceful."

"Yes!"

"We will do as Taesan says!"

How long will the worship of this world continue?

They will leave this place and tell people about what they saw and experienced.

It is said that a god named Taesan appeared, destroyed the world, and punished those who forced their faith upon others, and then suddenly disappeared.

And they will worship Taesan. A religion and group that reveres him as a god will be established.

And when they have children, grow old, and die, they will tell stories like old tales.

Once, this world was very noisy.

Two terrifying beings forced their worship upon themselves.

But a sudden appearance of a savior freed people from them."

Note: Taesan is a name that appears to be a proper noun, possibly a deity or a figure of importance in the story.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And it will continue to be passed down. As generations go by, the existence of Taesan will be etched in people's minds as a god.

The existence of Taesan in this world will never be forgotten.

That was enough.

Taesan's physical body disappeared. Taesan was no longer in this world.

But people did not lower their heads in respect. They continued to stand in place for several hours.

* * *

[Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [You have obtained the staff of a gear-turning something.] [You have obtained???.]

Floor clear reward.

The staff of a gear-turning something was equipment related to black magic. The secret reward was the same.

"I think I can get at least one mid-level black magic spell with this."

There was no reason to hesitate.

Taesan immediately went down the stairs.

[89th floor quest starts.] [Destroy the vanguard of the universe's high gods.] [Reward: The ring of eternal echoing screams.] [Secret reward:???]

Let me know if you have any further requests!
