Chapter 278

278. Colosseum (3)

The God of Fall selects a talented adventurer and bestows great favor upon them.

Taesan doesn't know the details, but if the God personally appears, it's not a small blessing.

Perhaps the chosen adventurer received a reward worthy of their talent.

And when that adventurer comes to Taesan, they reveal their true colors.

Taesan thinks they are the best chosen by the God, and their expectations are shattered.

The God of Fall is a fitting name for a God who does this.

And as such a God, they will choose an adventurer not just based on talent but also personality.

A heart that believes itself to be the strongest.

They will choose an arrogant adventurer.

Amelia would be the same.

So Taesan thought to crush Amelia's faith first.

"I'm fed up with those Americans. Can't they just be moderate?"

"I suppose they're desperate too. They can't promise they'll survive the next return."

Kang Joon-hyuk responds to Lee Tae-yeon's grumbling.

Taesan's thoughts are broken by their conversation.

"There's no problem at all. Since there's no rule that says we can't combine our powers, right?"

Taesan didn't think that the American way was entirely wrong.

They were in a situation where they might not even survive till tomorrow.

Prioritizing themselves over others was only natural.

"Ah, if this continues, all of us will become Americans... it's going to be tough."

"Don't be ridiculous."

Kang Joon-hyuk laughed and said, looking at Lee Tae-yeon's gloomy face.

And soon, they were summoned back to the battlefield. Lee Tae-yeon arrived at the vast plain, where no one was in sight, and walked with a heavy heart.

"Hmm?"

She discovered a player walking across the plain.

A large nose and piercing eyes. They were Americans. The three Americans were taken aback when they saw Lee Tae-yeon.

"......I've never seen an Asian player like you in hard mode. Are you from a different country?"

Lee Tae-yeon nodded. They started whispering to each other.

"What's going on? Did we kill them all off?"

"Is this guy a lucky survivor? If we hide and stay quiet, it's going to be hard to find us, right?"

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with!

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"......Is it not that guy? That Kang Tae-san?"

"He said he's a man. Does he look like a man to you?"

"You can hear everything, right?"

Lee Tae-yeon grumbled. The Americans' faces turned gloomy.

"......Should we take him out now?"

"I said we'd move after gathering everyone?"

"It's just one person. If it's not Kang Tae-san, we'll lose, don't you think?"

"That's...true."

They drew their weapons against Lee Tae-yeon. Lee Tae-yeon sighed and drew his sword.

One American laughed mockingly.

"You're no match for us."

They rushed towards him. One aimed for Lee Tae-yeon's head, another for his stomach, and the last one for his legs.

Lee Tae-yeon moved his sword with a look of annoyance.

"Whoa."

The sword aiming for his head was deflected, the spear aiming for his stomach was knocked away, and the dual-bladed sword aiming for his legs was trampled and stuck in the ground.

Lee Tae-yeon swung his sword again, and one of the hard-mode players disappeared.

"What, what!"

The Americans were shocked.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"They combined their strength to eliminate players from other countries, but the final winner was determined by pure skill.

The three who emerged victorious were among the strongest in the hard mode players. If all three attacked at the same time, even Oliver would be overwhelmed.

But not only did they block everything, they even counterattacked! In fact, they didn't even see the attack coming.

As the two were stunned, Lee Taeyon quickly slipped between them. The American player tried to respond hastily, but Lee Taeyon didn't allow it.

[Lee Taeyon activated her skill.]

The trajectory of the American player's sword wavered. Lee Taeyon passed through them, and they fell.

"This is something I've never seen before..."

"I'm speechless. Have Junhyuk and I been too forgotten?"

Lee Taeyon smiled wryly at the last remark, filled with awe.

She and Kang Junhyuk had reached the mid-levels of the 20th floor. And their strength was now beyond comparison to hard mode.

At this point, she was confident she could defeat 100 hard mode players single-handedly."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"But because Kang Taesan existed, she had relatively little interest in her. She looked around the community for several days, but there were hardly any stories about her.

It was ironic that in her previous life, she had been burdened by the attention focused on her.

But now, Taesan was there. Everyone's expectations were pouring onto him.

So, Lee Taeyeon began to want to be recognized by people more than in her past life.

"I'll be known a little if I stay until the end."

She muttered to herself, confident that she could win against anyone except Amelia and Taesan.

She thought so and moved forward. She was strong, but if all the hard modes came together, it would be difficult. She planned to find and deal with them one by one before that.

But her feet stopped. Lee Taeyeon's pupils shook violently as she stared ahead.

"……Mr. Taesan?"

"Hello."

Taesan waved his hand casually.

* * *

"……This is ridiculous."

Lee Taeyeon muttered gloomily, understanding the situation.

"What are the chances of running into Taesan among 1,600 people? What is this……."

"Don't worry, you're not the only one who met him."

"Ah…… older sister, nice to meet you."

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"...Junhyuk? Are you here too?"

Taeyeon burst out laughing.

"It's like you're not even trying."

Her determination to win had vanished into thin air.

"And there's a woman named Amelia too, right?"

"Probably not."

Taesan replied.

He had detected a total of 50 players in this space through his realm detection, out of 1,600 players. The fact that Taesan, Taeyeon, and Junhyuk were all here was not just a coincidence.

"It's crude, but certain."

There was no mention of random assignment from the start. The system had assigned them arbitrarily, which meant that the God of Falling could divide the space at will.

And Taeyeon and Junhyuk were people who could reach Amelia.

Although it was virtually impossible due to the difference of over 10 levels, it was not entirely impossible. In the current situation, where their strength had reached 100 and their defense had disappeared, there was a small but clear chance of winning.

So Taesan was going to make it happen.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

As their thoughts were about to end, several popular players approached them. Dozens of American hard mode players had gathered.

"What's going on? Are there three of you? Didn't you take out everyone except Taesan?"

"Sorry, but I don't have time to play with you."

Taesan raised his hand.

[You fired a starlight arrow.] [You activated magic separation.]

The light arrows separated and poured down on the hard mode players. They tried to run away in surprise, but the light arrows flew faster.

Kugu kugu kugu kung!

"Uh!"

Lee Taeyeon covered her body in shock.

Each of the bursting light arrows contained an unimaginable power.

When the light faded, no one was left. Dozens of hard mode players disappeared in an instant.

"Well done. This time, you also have a chance to beat me."

Taesan smiled and drew his sword.

"Let's try it once. Together."

"Ah……"

"There's no chance of winning no matter how you look at it."

Although they grumbled, determination appeared on their faces. They began to think seriously about how to defeat Taesan.

Taesan was satisfied with their appearance.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Despite facing an overwhelming enemy and thinking that they can't win, they don't give up and strive for victory. This was the mindset necessary in Alone Mode.

'I've got the criteria.'

Taesan approached Itaeyeon, who lowered his stance and charged at Taesan.

[Itaeyeon activated his acceleration.]

Gangjunhyeok also didn't stand still. He quickly moved behind Taesan's back.

One targeted the front, and the other targeted the back. It was a textbook move.

Taesan drew his sword against the charging Itaeyeon. Itaeyeon gritted his teeth and tried to defend himself.

[Itaeyeon activated his slide.]

The sword came down and struck. Taesan's sword, which had clashed with Itaeyeon's, was about to be pushed back.

Itaeyeon aimed for the opening, and Gangjunhyeok stomped his foot.

Taesan put strength into his hand.

The sword, which had been deflected by the slide's effect, was forcibly straightened by the strength. Itaeyeon was shocked and rolled on the ground.

Taesan pulled his sword back. Gangjunhyeok, who had been charging, quickly blocked it with his sword.

*Clang.*

And they were amazed by the difference in strength they felt."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I barely managed to defend myself without taking any damage, but my hand was shaking. If I had clashed swords with him a few more times, I might have even dropped my sword.

It wasn't even his full power. Taesan moved his sword very slowly.

"The Ability Sword's power is certainly strong, but it's not invincible. If the opponent has overwhelming strength, it can be negated."

Taesan picked up his sword.

"Come back again."

* * *

Taesan taught Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk how to deal with an overwhelmingly strong enemy. As a result, the two of them were pushed back, but their faces were bright.

"Then, Mr. Taesan, please take care of the rest."

"Hey, those guys are getting on my nerves. I can't help but get angry."

Taesan waved his hand and finished them off.

[Quest Complete] [You have become the winner.] [Settling up... ] [You have earned 760 points.] [Moving to the final location.]

The place that was summoned this time was different from before. Taesan was summoned to a room with a blue finish.

It wasn't very big, about the size of a basketball court.

Taesan looked around the interior and turned his gaze.

There, several Americans were gathered.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

**[All winners have been decided. Moving to the next battlefield in one hour.]**

Taesan had spent a considerable amount of time training Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk. That's why Taesan was the last one.

Let's count them one by one: a total of 31 people. Including Taesan, that makes 32.

Among them, a blond man approached Taesan.

**"Uh... nice to meet you."**

**"Hello."**

Taesan replied, his eyes fixed on the man in front of him, who was familiar.

Blond hair and blue eyes, a man with a stereotypical Western appearance.

He was always steadfast and confident. He was the one who had gathered Korean players and led them when Kim Hwi-yeon died. And he had survived to the end.

Oliver Khan. The leader of the United States and the world.

Oliver spoke.

**"Your name is Kang Taesan, right?"**

Taesan nodded, and Oliver let out a sigh.

**"... I heard rumors, but you're indeed strong. But it took longer than expected."**

**"There were two particularly strong guys on our side."**

**"... Are you talking about the two Korean Alone Mode players?"**

Berikut adalah hasil terjemahannya ke dalam bahasa Inggris:

Oliver's eyes shone brightly. It seemed like he was misunderstanding something, but it wasn't important to Taesan.

He could feel a gaze piercing through him since earlier.

Taesan turned his gaze.

Blue hair came into view.

Brown eyes were fixed on Taesan. A beautiful woman who resembled a wild cat was gazing fixedly at Taesan.

She wasn't saying anything, but her energy was revealing herself.

I am the strongest.

No one can approach me.

It was an aura that made such a claim.

Amelia Erin.

The woman who was the strongest solo player. And perhaps a player who was buried in the labyrinth by the God of Destruction.

Taesan smiled and opened his mouth to her.

"Hello?"

There were many emotions in her gaze towards him.

The woman who had been gazing piercingly at Taesan opened her mouth.

"For real?"

"What?"

"The fact that you've cleared over 50 floors."

Taesan laughed.

"How does it look?"

Amelia's face contorted as Taesan didn't answer.

Here is the translation of the text from Korean to English:

"The atmosphere resonated with emotion. Oliver's face, standing next to the mountain, hardened.

She had reached the point where she could control people with just a simple emotional outburst.

But that was it.

Tae-san couldn't help but laugh at the atmosphere that was being imposed on him.

Amelia Erine. The strongest solo mode player. He was the greatest player who had been believed to be untouchable all his life.

But no longer."
