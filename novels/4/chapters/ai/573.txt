Chapter 574

574. The God of Fall, the Usurper (5)

The two swords converge. Everything he has built up until now.

The sword merges with the boundary and the abyss, and the heterogeneities blend together to become one.

Kkkkkk.

Naturally, a backlash occurs.

Combining the two complete authorities of the sacred sword into one is not an easy task, even for the current Taesan. It becomes distorted and broken.

"Look."

So, he uses the boundary beast to control the instability.

The boundary beast. The boundary itself, as a domain, covers the sword. It forcibly controls and suppresses the distorted backlash.

Kagagagak!

Everything Taesan has is converged into the sword.

And in it, physical strength is also contained.

The four complete authorities are mixed and blended, becoming one.

Kiiiiing.

And it is accomplished.

A complete one is formed.

[You have obtained !@%$$^%$.]

"Whew."

Taesan took a deep breath.

Everything he has is embedded in the sword. The usurper has taken on a new form.

[… Amazing.]

Everything Taesan has is embedded in that sword.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was originally impossible. But the boundary of the different dimension made it possible. If I limit it to that sword, Taesan could wield a power higher than his own strength.

With that sword, he could have inflicted damage on the usurper.

But the usurper laughed.

[You were in a state of complete defenselessness.]

As much as Taesan put in his full strength, his physical body itself was in a state of complete defenselessness. Although the boundary was distorted, it was only a fragment.

It was a form that had abandoned defense and focused all its energy on offense.

[Nothing has changed. I still stand in a higher place than you.]

The usurper's body moved.

Taesan momentarily lost sight of that movement. His intuition moved, and he grasped his sword.

Ka-a-a-a-ang!

The collision spread throughout the entire realm. Taesan's sword and the usurper's black sword clashed.

And Bardley did not back down.

The four authorities wrapped around Taesan's sword made it possible to respond to the usurper's sword as well.

But Taesan's physical body was not. His body was pushed back.

He had barely managed to reach the same level as the usurper by focusing all his energy on his sword, but that was a story limited to his sword. Taesan was still no match for the usurper in terms of strength."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And the usurper didn't need to be obsessed with just one sword like Taesan.

The usurper wielded the sword lightly.

And within it, a sword wave erupted.

The dark, entangled power of the usurper's authority enveloped Taesan. It was an extremely wide and space-dominating attack. One sword couldn't block it.

No matter how much Taesan focused on his sword, if the usurper attacked like that, there was no answer.

Of course, Taesan had also thought of that.

He still had one more skill he hadn't used.

[You activated Essence Destruction.]

The power to destroy the essence of the sword was embedded. A new skill he had acquired, Essence Destruction.

He swung it straight at the usurper.

Whoa!

Destruction occurred. The usurper's essence was shattered and scattered.

[What.]

The usurper was shocked.

Taesan's sword was certainly powerful, but it wasn't capable of destroying his power to that extent.

As his power dispersed, an opening appeared for Taesan to escape.

Taesan inserted his body into that opening.

Of course, Taesan's entire body couldn't fit through it. The usurper's darkness clung to Taesan's body.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You take @!#%!! damage.] [You take %^&& damage.] [You take!!^*&* damage.]

...

...

His body is worn out. Taesan shakes off the contamination that has invaded his boundaries and recovers.

The distorted contamination falls off from Taesan's body.

"Can I recover?"

Although he can't completely block the contamination, it's difficult to directly affect his body. As long as he avoids a fatal blow, he can recover enough to continue fighting.

And he was certain.

The essence destruction was effective even against the usurper.

Of course, he couldn't destroy the usurper's concentrated sword, but he could respond to the swinging force.

[Hmm.]

The usurper let out an unexpected sound, but soon calmly grasped his sword.

[Even so, nothing changes.]

The usurper charges. The swords clash. Taesan's body is pushed back.

Even if he could block the swinging force, the usurper is still stronger than Taesan.

The usurper's body moves quickly. His sword aims for Taesan's entire body.

Taesan focuses his mind.

More sharply, he polishes everything.

Ka-ga-ga-k!"

Note: The text appears to be a fantasy or action scene, with Taesan fighting against a usurper. The dialogue and sound effects are written in a stylized way to convey the intensity of the battle.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Swords clash.

First, we need to narrow the gap between power and speed.

[You activated a powerful strike.] [You activated acceleration.]

Whoa!

Swords clash. The usurper felt it. The fact that Taesan's power and speed had increased.

[Something strange.]

The usurper muttered to himself. Taesan's current speed and power were actually at their limits. It was impossible to increase them further from there.

Yet, Taesan's speed and power were clearly increasing.

[But even so.]

It didn't matter. The usurper was confident in his own power.

He had surpassed many masters. He was overwhelmingly superior to Taesan.

Kwaaaang!

Swords continue to clash.

And as the battle continued, the usurper realized one thing.

Taesan was getting faster and stronger.

Powerful strikes and acceleration were ordinary skills in the labyrinth. Once activated, they were over.

But Taesan had an ability sword.

If the timing was right, he could continue to activate it. Moreover, its power continued to rise.

Note: "Usurper" is a literal translation of "찬탈자", but it may not be the best fit in this context. It could also be translated as "rival" or "opponent".
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Kagagaga!"

Taesan caught up with the speed of the usurper at some point.

"Kaahhh!"

The usurper's sword was pushed back.

[What.]

Just as the usurper was about to mutter something, Taesan swung his sword. The sword blade covered Taesan's body.

[You activated stealth.]

And his figure and presence disappeared.

The usurper momentarily lost sight of Taesan.

But it was only for a moment. The high-level opponent could grasp the existence of the opponent's strength in an instant. The usurper quickly swung his sword towards the sky.

Taesan struck down with his sword.

[You activated landing.]

"Kaahhh!"

[Whoa.]

The usurper let out a groan.

He felt a burden on his sword that was beyond his expectations. Taesan scratched the sword blade as it was.

Landing quickly, he thrust.

The usurper blocked the attack and counterattacked. The series of processes was extremely fast. Taesan struggled to respond.

But it didn't matter.

He didn't even think about responding.

[You activated counter.] [You activated essence destruction.]

"Kwajik!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The sword of Taesan was lodged in the shoulder of the usurper.

Taesan was also not unscathed. The usurper's sword had created a long gash on Taesan's thigh.

"The counter didn't activate properly."

Normally, Taesan would have been able to perfectly ignore the usurper's attack. But since the opponent's strength was higher, he couldn't help but take damage. He recovered from the wound using his boundary, but it wasn't perfect.

But this was enough.

The distorted power in the usurper's shoulder was scattering like smoke.

[It's an Ability Sword. I had something like that.]

"I realized it too late."

[I thought it was a useless skill.]

The Ability Sword was undoubtedly powerful.

It was a unique swordsmanship that could connect skills and sword techniques, based on the system of the labyrinth.

But in the end, it was swordsmanship. It was the ability to wield a sword.

Now, Taesan had surpassed the realm of transcendence.

He could influence universal concepts.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was no reason to be obsessed with small concepts like a sword now. The Ability Sword was certainly powerful, but it wasn't worth anything in the realm of transcendence.

So, the usurper knew of the Ability Sword's existence, but had forgotten it in their mind.

And with that reaction, Taesan realized.

The usurper didn't know the effects of the Ability Sword.

When Taesan fought against Goshin's underlings, he had used the Ability Sword. It was unclear whether the information hadn't been transmitted or if it had been ignored.

But that was an opportunity for Taesan.

[It's clearly my mistake, but it doesn't change anything.]

Even if the Ability Sword existed, the usurper was confident in their victory.

[Swordsmanship is ultimately for the weak.]

Swordsmanship is meaningless. It's just a futile struggle for the weak to resist the strong. They can't do anything and are just trampled.

The usurper didn't change their form. And Taesan knew that the usurper would do so.

They were strong from the start, only wielding their own power and not learning anything from humans. Goshin wouldn't think that human swordsmanship was meaningful.

"Do you think so?"
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$And Tae-san mocked such a plunderer.

The plunderer rushes in.

The plunderer is undoubtedly faster and stronger than Tae-san.

But that movement, in the end, is simple. It is more like overwhelming force and speed to crush the opponent.

In the end, it's all about the sword.

[You activated a parry.] [You activated an acceleration.]

Clashing of swords. By timing it right, you further increase the speed of the skill.

[You activated a reduction.]

Aah-ooo-ng!

The effect of the ability sword. Reduction. It reduces the burden on the sword when it collides with the opponent's sword. The pressure on Tae-san decreases significantly.

[You activated a continuous attack.]

And the sword leaves a trail.

Tens of sword strikes overwhelm the plunderer.

[A trick play.]

The plunderer scoffs and wields the sword greatly.

And swings it.

The sword strikes all shatter and break. Tae-san slips in a real attack in between.

[You activated a feint.]

Clashing of swords again. This time, the sword of the plunderer is slightly deflected. Tae-san tries to thrust his sword into that gap.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But the usurper quickly tightens their body. The sword's attack barely grazes past.

[You.]

You don't give them an opening.

You immediately cling to them. From below, you thrust your sword upwards.

[You have activated a dash.] [You have activated a forced fall.]

Forced fall.

The effect of the Ability Sword is that the weight of the opponent's sword increases as the swords clash.

If it were just a simple weight, it would be meaningless, but the Ability Sword resonates with the mountain's energy. As the swords clash, the usurper's sword is clearly slowing down.

There is no such thing as something meaningless.

The reason Taesan hadn't used the Ability Sword until now was that a suitable situation hadn't arisen.

No matter how useful a card may be, if it's not the right time to use it, you can't use it. It's not that the card's value is low.

And now is the time to use the Ability Sword card.

[You have activated acceleration.]

Kagakagak!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I accelerate and accelerate. The usurper realizes the activation condition and tries to deflect the sword's trajectory, but it's no use. The usurper simply swings the sword, and there is no such thing as swordsmanship. I could adjust it to my liking, no matter what.

[You have activated stealth.]

Taesan's presence suddenly disappears. The usurper immediately turns around and thrusts the sword. Taesan catches the sword.

[You have activated evasion.]

The sword's trajectory is slightly altered. A very small correction, almost imperceptible.

But that was enough. I dodged the attack and applied pressure.

The usurper was confused.

He was clearly stronger than Taesan.

His skills were undoubtedly superior.

Yet, he couldn't overpower Taesan. Instead, he was being pushed back.

Ka-ga-gak!

Taesan continues to charge forward.

The opponent is an obvious superior swordsman.

I was pushing forward with only swordsmanship against such an opponent. It was an impossible feat.

And when I achieved that impossible feat, my proficiency level rose.

[The proficiency level of Ability Sword has increased by 1%.] [The proficiency level of Ability Sword has increased by 3%.] [The proficiency level of Ability Sword has increased by 2%.]

The proficiency level of Ability Sword begins to rise exponentially."
