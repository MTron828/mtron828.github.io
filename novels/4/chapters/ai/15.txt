Episode 16

16. 2nd Floor (1)

Laughter erupted on the overwhelmingly long system window.

Proof of becoming stronger always put him in a good mood.

Taesan checked methodically.

Victory reward over enemies. Agility increased by 2, and mana increased by 3. As he would increasingly use skills in the future, the rise in mana was always welcome.

And the rewards for leveling up improved. Agility increased by 3 and Strength by 1. That's a total of 4 stats. The rise in Strength, which hadn't increased until now, was rare good news.

"I expected it, but it's satisfying."

Rewards based on level depend on what you did while accumulating experience, what stats you used. If you mainly used Strength stats, Strength increases; if you mainly used Agility stats, Agility rises.

Fighting against a Giant Rat involved quite a bit of strength, so the increase was natural. It's still in single digits, but when the level goes up, dozens of stats will come in as level-up rewards.

He could accept it calmly as it was something he had expected so far. But the story was slightly different when it came to the increase in soul.
"What kind of skill is this, anyway?"

Soul increase. Agility increased by 3, and Strength by 2. It's more than the increase due to leveling up. No matter how much I look back on my memories, it's an unbelievable skill.

Simply put, it's far superior to endurance or attack nullification. It's a skill that can barely be compared on a multiplication level.

"Yeah. This kind of reward should be given."

Even as an Easy Mode player, they managed to defeat two S-rank opponents. There should be some kind of reward for that, shouldn't there? Taesan whistled while checking the status window.

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 4] [Health: 155/155] [Mana: 15/15] [Strength: 14] [Intelligence: 16] [Agility: 30] [Attack +2] [Defense +7] [In peak condition.]

"Ha."

He couldn't help but marvel at the stats. In his 30s after breaking through the 1st floor. Memories of futile attempts to raise stats in Easy Mode came flooding back.

Lost in nostalgia, Taesan began checking his rewards.

[Random Stat Increase Potion] [Increases one random stat.]
As described, it had the intended effect. The value of stats never changes. Even for high-level players, it was an item worth coveting. With no reason to delay, Taesan consumed the potion.

"[Strength permanently increases by 1.]"

"Yes."

Taesan clenched his fist lightly. The stat he needed most had increased appropriately. Now, only one remained.

"You used ???." "Obtained two designated stat increase potions."

"Wow."

Taesan, confirming the description, let out a sigh of admiration.

[Designated Stat Increase Potion] [Increases designated stat by 1.]

It had the literal effect, and was an item rare to find even beyond the 50th floor. The basic way to increase stats is through leveling up. Other methods are too difficult or variable, relying on luck.

Moreover, the increase in stats due to leveling up depends on what was done while accumulating experience points.

In other words, higher stats are easier to raise because they are used more often, while lower stats are harder.

At least passing the minimum benchmark could balance it out, and the designated stat increase potion was the best potion to make it.

It overflowed with rewards. Taesan drank the potion.
[You drank a designated stat increase potion. You must specify one stat to increase.]

"Strength."

Taesan immediately replied. There was no reason to increase any other stat. He drank the remaining potion to raise the stat of strength.

In an instant, his strength increased by 3 points. Taesan checked his status window with satisfaction. With this stat, he could defeat a Giant Rat without using arrows.

"I also learned a skill."

Taesan confirmed.

[Special Trigger Skill: Counter] [Mana Cost: 5] [Proficiency: 1%] [Counters enemy attacks, dealing greater damage to the enemy.]

"Counter? Got it faster than I thought."

If the opponent's attack can be avoided, it activates a condition-free evasion. Moreover, it counters. Counterattacks are usually two or three times as powerful as normal damage.

As a skill comparable to dodging, it was advantageous in different ways. The large mana cost was the only downside, but it was worth it.

"Phew."

Taesan stretched and sat back down.
The rewards of leveling up don't alleviate mental fatigue. Before entering the second floor, he planned to let his mind recover a bit. While taking a break, he checked the community.

"I wonder how it turned out?"

A few days ago, he had posted a guide on the community for tackling Floor 1 of Alon Mode. He had written down the shortest route to the Fountain of Life.

However, the likelihood of his words being believed was slim. Locked in an unknown space, would someone really write a guide? And so soon after being trapped? Even Taesan would doubt and check it cautiously.

With little expectation, Taesan opened the community.

"Huh?"

A surprised voice escaped him. Several posts had been made in the community. Most of them were about Alon Mode.
[Translated text to English]

[Park Chan-woong [Alone]: Is there anyone who can show me the route to the Fountain of Life? I'm too anxious to go on my own.]

[Moon Jae-seong [Alone]: Even if you're anxious, there's no choice. Since everyone's positions are different, you have to follow what the shop owner says.]

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Once you arrive, it becomes safer, so it's best to grit your teeth and run. If you stay here longer, it might become difficult to move due to hunger, you know?]

[Kim Tae-jin [Alone]: A race where lives are at stake. It's really fun. ㅋㅋㅋ…….]

[Kang Joon-hyuk [Alone]: But where is there even a possibility?]

"Huh."

It was completely different from the Alone Mode community he remembered.

Previously, there was only despair in the community.

Every day, people hid their faces, and no one discussed tactics.

Later on, everyone seemed either dead or broken-hearted, and no one spoke up.

Only Lee Tae-yeon had been lively and noisy.

But now it was so different.

[Lee Sang [Alone]: I've arrived at the Fountain of Life! Thank you for cheering me on!]

[Kang Joon-hyuk [Alone]: Congratulations. As long as you're careful, there won't be any reason to die on the 1st floor.]

The community was lively. While traces of despair and fear were sporadically visible, it wasn't completely dead. The hope of surviving was evident in the posts.
[Translated text to English]

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: By the way, that person. Kang Taesan, right? Where did he go? Haven't seen him since he posted that.]

[Lee Sang [Alone]: I've been checking the community every day, but haven't seen him.]

[Kang Joon-hyuk [Alone]: Is he dead?]

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Nah, surely not. Someone who broke through just a few days ago wouldn't be dead already, right? They're probably descending by now.]

"...What's this?"

* * *

Taesan descended to the 2nd floor. There, a dwarf was waiting.

"Caught anything?"

"Yeah, I've come back."

The dwarf, checking Taesan, grinned happily.

"Looks good. Just as expected. Planning to use the shop?"

"Of course."

Before entering the 2nd floor, preparations needed to be made. The dwarf asked about supplies.

"Buying what you need, selling what you don't. By now, you've probably gathered a few things to sell, right?"

"You know it well."

"Sick of seeing it. Selling?"

"Yes."

Taesan took out meat from his inventory.

"I'll sell this meat."

Meat would spoil over time. Low-quality food wouldn't provide adequate disease resistance, so selling it quickly was best. Up to the 10th floor, most enemies were creatures, so there was no reason to save it. The dwarf examined the meat and assessed its value.

"This should fetch about five hundred gold. Not selling the leather? If you've caught a Giant Rat, you'd have its teeth too, those would be worth something, right?"
"Not selling."

The monster's leather and teeth were useful. The dwarf, realizing what he was aiming for, chuckled softly.

"The blacksmith is looking for these."

"Yes."

"If you go a bit further down, you should find what you're looking for. They usually die before getting there, but I guess you won't have to worry."

Perhaps because he had broken through the 1st floor, the dwarf's face showed stronger trust than before. Taesan, now having a rough idea of who they were, wasn't flustered.

When he met the dwarf, a system window had appeared.

[Encountered the Lost Dwarf King.]

The lost dwarf king. He had drifted into the labyrinth from his fallen kingdom.

That must be the dwarf's true identity.

"So, what are you buying? Show me roughly?"

"Yes, thank you."

He had plenty of money. Combining the selling price, it was twelve hundred gold. It wasn't the money collected on the 1st floor. Even if it was an item a step above, he could buy it without any burden.

The dwarf raised his finger, seeming to notice Taesan's thoughts.
"Let me say one thing. I'll only sell what's strictly defined. I won't sell you something that you can buy on the 4th or 5th floor just because you've gathered more money than needed. It's better to snuff out unnecessary expectations."

"Understood."

The dwarf was similar to Ainz in some ways. He would extend a certain amount of generosity, but never to the point of indulgence in benefits. He seemed intent on maintaining a certain standard.

"Alright. Here they are for now. If you need anything else, just let me know."

The dwarf laid out his goods. Taesan inspected each item carefully.

Once again, he skipped the potions. Even though he couldn't use the Fountain of Life outside the 1st floor, there was no need to buy potions when he could save his money by purchasing something else that would conserve his health.

Taesan checked the arrows. He had plenty of basic arrows in stock. What he needed were different types of arrows.

[Paralysis Arrow] [Attack Power +2] [Inflicts paralysis on the target. Success rate may vary depending on level and stats.] [30G]

The dwarf, who had been observing, asked him.

"Are you buying that?"

"I'll take thirty of them."

"That's quite a lot?"

"I need them."

If the information from Itaeyeon about the 2nd floor was true, then he needed these by now. The dwarf handed over the arrows again, looking satisfied.
"Here, take it. So now you have 300 gold left, what else are you going to buy? Personally, I recommend equipment. It'll be tough entering the 2nd floor with just your current gear, you know?"

"You have no armor and barely any additional attack power. You can't rely on Tower Shield's defense forever. Buying weapons or armor is the right answer."

Fortunately, among the items the dwarf showed him, there were several spears, shields, and armors. He could buy all of them for less than 300 gold.

"It's regrettable."

However, Taesan hesitated. Monsters drop what they have. The Big Rat drops leather and meat, and enemies carrying equipment drop their gear.

The enemies on the 2nd floor are those who use weapons and armor. In other words, you can get both things. It felt like a slight loss to buy them in advance.

As Taesan pondered and looked around at the goods, his eyes fell on a pair of gloves.

[Gloves of the Martial Artist] [Attack Power +1] [Protects your hands. Seems like it could make enemies slightly uncomfortable when you hit them.] [300G]

Gloves of the Martial Artist. In the past, he wouldn't have given them a second glance. Gloves only deal damage when you hit with your fists.

But now is different. Taesan picked up the gloves.

"I'll take these."
"The gloves of the martial artist? Are you going to use your fists? Why buy those?"

"Because I can use them."

The dwarf, who had been giving him a puzzled look, realized.

"Oh, the old man must have given you that Irai martial arts. I see. You seem to like that crazy stuff. Still, it's unexpected that he gave you martial arts skills too."

"Do you know him?"

"We've been rotting together here, so I know him. Not particularly fond of him, though."

"You don't like him?"

"Who likes zealots who go crazy trying to find gods?"

The dwarf frowned. Taesan realized one thing from the disgust evident on his face.

NPCs in the labyrinth are aware of each other. But they're not exactly friendly. In fact, they seemed closer to being hostile.
