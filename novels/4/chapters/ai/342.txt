Article 343

343. 73rd floor, special activation skill. Copy (1)

[First, I will give you the most powerful and exceptional magic I possess.] [You have obtained magic stacking.] [You have obtained magic release.]

Magic Stacking.

This was the magic used by Shayian. Akisha said proudly.

[The magic I created is a combination of many magic cores, separated and merged, allowing me to use multiple types of magic at once. It's not just about increasing power, but also inheriting the characteristics, which will be very helpful.]

"I know."

Akisha was taken aback.

[Do you know?]

"I saw Shayian use it."

[...Yes, that's right.]

Akisha smiled.

[So you wanted to get it and ended up making it yourself. Then there's no need to explain it to me. Try using it yourself and see.]

Akisha then handed over the cane and robe he had used before. Tai Shan checked the level of the equipment he received.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The Staff of the Almost-Great Magician]

[Magic + 300]
[Mana + 5000]
[Speed of Incantation + 12%]
[The staff of a great magician who was about to become, but was killed by a treacherous betrayal. The grudge and talent are deeply embedded in the staff.]

It was not a equipment that could be obtained from the level of Akisha who had died. The equipment level seemed to rise according to the level of the quest.

The robe was also at a similar level. It was not suitable for the equipment of a judge like Taesan, but it could be a good offering to the god of magic.

[My reward has ended here.]

Akisha's body began to disperse slowly.

[The wish has been fulfilled, but it's more disappointing than I thought...]

Akisha muttered to herself with a bitter tone.

He eventually died.

He could not be reborn again. His talent, ability, and potential were all over.

[It's really pitiful. Are you also trapped in the labyrinth with a similar wish?]

The ghost quietly nodded to Akisha's question. Akisha let out a wry smile.

[It seems we're fellow travelers. It's good to prepare ourselves. This ending is... really pitiful.]

After he spoke, Akisha's body disappeared.

His soul was no longer here. With the wish fulfilled, the contract was completed, and he had left the labyrinth.

[...]
Here is the translation of the text:

The ghost looked at the place where Akisha had disappeared in silence.

**Magic Stacking** **Proficiency: 1%** **You can use multiple magic spells stacked together. Currently, you can only stack spells of the same type, and the number of spells you can stack is very limited.**

**Magic Release** **Proficiency: 1%** **Releases the stacked magic spell.**

Akisha had given him the skill, Magic Stacking.

After testing various magic spells, Taesan realized.

"It seems I can use it similarly to Black Magic."

Black Magic is the power of demons. By opening a portal and obtaining their permission, I can summon the true power of Black Magic.

However, it took time to open the portal, and the consumed mana increased.

Magic Stacking was similar. You can maximize the power of magic by stacking it together, but due to the lack of proficiency, it took time to stack the magic.

However, the power increased significantly.
Here is the translation of the text:

As a double-casting Taesan, I could use it according to the situation. As my proficiency increases, I can use it without delay, just like Xi'an did. It was a good skill.

Moreover, I also obtained skills while defeating Xi'an.

[Forced Magic Alignment] [Proficiency: 1%] [Can force magic to be aligned.]

It's a very simple explanation. Xi'an can use defensive magic as an attack and attack magic as defense, so it's a skill that can be used by Taesan, who mostly uses attack magic. The ability to handle magic in various ways means that its applicability is broad, and it will be very helpful.

And, I also obtained a mid-level magic.

[Mid-level Magic: Distortion] [Proficiency: 1%] [Mana consumption: 150] [Distorts space. It can only distort a very limited and narrow range for now.]

Taesan used the skill directly.

[You have activated Distortion.]

Quake.

Space is distorted.

Although it's a very small space, just large enough for a fist to fit, it's definitely distorted.

"It won't have a significant impact."
Here is the translation of the text:

Just like Shayan did, using the skill to block the attack itself was impossible. It was only effective in a very small space. It didn't seem to have a significant impact during battles.

However,

Tae-san stroked his beard.

He could make the space conform to his will. While he couldn't touch the range, he could specify the position and size.

If I had such a skill, it could be helpful in obtaining skills from my previous life that I had not yet obtained.

For now, I'll just experiment with it and try to understand its exact effects.

[Skill: Quick Judgment] [Level: 1%] [Assists in making quick decisions during battles.]

Quick Judgment. It was one of the skills I obtained the latest in my previous life.

During battles, I had to consider multiple possibilities and quickly find the correct answer to make a decision and move quickly.

Quick Judgment was a skill that helped me make judgments quickly, just like how sensory enhancement enhanced my senses.

As I looked at this skill, another skill came to mind.

"The One Thousand Possibilities."

A skill that calculates the one thousand possible outcomes to find the correct answer.

This was a skill that only I, Taeyoung, possessed, and even Tae-san couldn't obtain it.

Now, as a gran, I can obtain the One Thousand Possibilities.
Here is the translation of the text:

In addition to increasing the proficiency of magic and advanced magic, the proficiency of other skills also increased significantly.

After verifying, Tai Shan moved his body.

*

Before descending to the labyrinth, Tai Shan searched for the Relic and offered a tribute to it.

[Advanced Rune Magic: White Rune Shield] [Proficiency: 1%] [Mana Consumption: 700] [Summons three Rune Shields that protect the user's body and respond to incoming attacks.]

The advanced Rune Magic was obtained as a result of clearing the Giant's World. The White Rune Shield, which was once almost never used, existed because there were no attacks that could be blocked by a beginner's magic.

The Magic God strengthened this magic.

As a result, the magic became advanced, and the proficiency also increased, so the protective power also increased. This skill was very helpful for Tai Shan, who continued to move and fight.

There was a significant difference between beginner's magic and advanced magic.

The advanced magic that Shaiyan had handled suddenly came to mind.

The advanced magic, which could bring about destruction, had the power to easily kill Tai Shan.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was not just once, but five times that such an attack was possible. Although Taesan had survived by dealing with various skills, he would have died immediately if he had been a little short. It was definitely not a skill that a mortal could obtain. I was sure of it this time. High-level magic is only allowed when one surpasses the mortal realm.

Taesan descended into the labyrinth.

He had not yet cleared the 73rd floor.

Beyond the location where he defeated Shayan was the entrance to the cave.

Taesan inserted his body into it.

The cave was filled with the thick, damp air of the moss and the dark, dense darkness.

Taesan recalled the clearing conditions for the 73rd floor.

[Start of 73rd Floor Quest.] [Defeat the owner of the dungeon, who is deep in the dungeon, by conquering the dungeon...]. [Reward: The shoes of the one who has left footprints on all land]. [Secret reward: ???]

Dungeon conquest.

Taesan raised his hand to the cave floor. He gathered magic, opened the path, and activated the "Lera's Area Detection" skill.

"Kiying!"

The detection wave spread throughout the cave, and the information entered Taesan's mind.

As a result, Taesan learned that this was a cave with five floors and was quite large.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Must we tackle another dungeon within the labyrinth?"

Tai Shan grasped his sword and entered the dungeon. As he went in a certain distance, monsters appeared.

[The solo swordsman was rotten. The drain appeared.] [The solo mage was rotten. Bian appeared.]

They were all withered and twisted skeletons.

Each grasping their own weapon, they charged at Tai Shan.

Ka ka ka!

Tai Shan moved his sword. He parried the arrow aimed at his head and dodged the sword aimed at his waist.

He was quick. His movements were as refined as a seasoned warrior's. When Tai Shan counterattacked, he received it skillfully.

Tai Shan realized who they were.

"'Adventurers who died on the 73rd floor.'"

The deeper they went, the more difficult each floor was. Although they had just broken through, it was clear that the guides of the guilty path had lingered in the 74th floor for a long time.

So many people must have died.

They were the corpses.

Kaang!

Tai Shan put strength into his sword. The skeletons tried to block him, but he flew away with the sword still in hand.

They were ultimately failures.

They couldn't block themselves.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san charged towards them. The skeletons, with their experiences etched on their bodies, tried to respond, but Tae-san was faster.

Kwajik.

In an instant, he defeated two monsters.

Tae-san sharpened his sword with a sinister look.

"His movements are not that great."

It seemed that his soul had already left his body, which was why it wasn't that impressive. It seemed that he had some degree of self-awareness, but it was limited. Unlike the guides he had faced before, he didn't have his own unique abilities.

Tae-san continued to descend.

He broke through the first and second floors and arrived at the third floor in an instant.

The dead adventurers continued to appear, but it was impossible to stop Tae-san.

"[It's not like this was made for this place, right.]"

A ghost muttered to himself, comparing Tae-san to someone who had descended the labyrinth with common sense. He knew.

Tae-san's words were that the dead adventurers didn't have the strength they had in life, but they were still capable of reaching the 73rd floor.

As many of these people appeared, an ordinary adventurer would have a lot of trouble with the strategy.
(Note: Tae-san is likely a character's name, and Kwajik is a sound effect or an onomatopoeia.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"It would seem that the original design goal for the 73rd floor was to meticulously analyze the movements of deceased adventurers, one by one, and then spend a long time plotting against them.

However, the time required for this task would be enormous, depending on one's ability or skills.

But Taesan didn't care about any of that.

He was plotting against the 73rd floor, strolling through it as if taking a walk.

It was impossible to think about how this place was created and what its purpose was.

Taesan's footsteps didn't stop.

There was a secret room here due to the dungeon's characteristics, and he quickly detected it using area detection and confirmed the rewards.

[Shield of the Igis with an acquired nature] [Defense + 150] [This shield was used by the great adult Igis when they left their human seat and ascended to the divine seat. For 1 second, it grants immunity to all damage. This effect has a 1-month cooldown.]

"Is this the strengthened form of Igis Shield?"

Taesan's Igis Shield grants immunity to all damage for 1 second, but it also prevents the user from moving during that time."
Here is the translation of the text:

The penalty was gone, like a shield. I could feel the effect of immunity when using the Igias shield. This shield is indeed excellent.

Taesan put the shield in his inventory and entered the dungeon again.

He descended quickly. For an ordinary adventurer, it would take a long time to reach the end of the dungeon, but Taesan reached it in less than an hour.

And he met the 73rd floor boss.

[A lone, withered Richie. Malakos appeared.]

A skeleton holding a staff and wearing a black robe.

An undead Richie, who becomes a wizard when he dies.

"Another wizard?"

Taesan drew his sword. Richie's jaw dropped as he held his staff.

A clear enemy arrow was aimed at Taesan.

[Malakos activated the frost arrow.]

Taesan dodged the incoming arrow with his body. Malakos then aimed his staff at Taesan, who was approaching quickly.

[Malakos activated the frozen world.]

Ting-ting-ting!

The cold air rushed in. The narrow cave began to freeze.

"Can you use a middle-grade spell?"

Taesan gasped in surprise. It was indeed deep. Even monsters were using middle-grade spells.
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have launched the Starlight Arrow.] [You have launched the Compulsory Amplification.]

But it wasn't that impressive. The Starlight Arrow shot by Tai Shan shattered the coldness, and Malakos hastily drew his staff.

[Malakos has launched the Shield of Protection.]

Hmph!

The blue curtain and Starlight Arrow collided, and a wave of power spread.

Tai Shan immediately attached himself to Malakos.

Malakos responded by wielding his staff.

Malakos was not weak. He skillfully handled intermediate-level magic and pressured Tai Shan.

However, Tai Shan was facing someone who had mastered the Way of Shai'an, a method of absorbing magic, just a moment ago.

Given the basic difference in strength, Malakos was soon defeated by Tai Shan.

Thud.

The scattered bones fell to the ground. Tai Shan was about to kill and loot the enemy when he suddenly...

Thud thud.

The broken bones began to rise again. Although they had exhausted their energy and collapsed, they reformed and once again maliciously gazed at Tai Shan with a fierce intent.

[The lone Rich has decayed. Malakos has revived.]

Note: Rich may refer to a person or a creature with magical powers.
