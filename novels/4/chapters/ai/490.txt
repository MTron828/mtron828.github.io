**Chapter 491**

**491. 92nd Floor. Faith (2)**

Every time I entered a new floor, the first person to greet me was the shop owner.

He was always waiting for adventurers at the entrance of the floor.

But this time was different. Even after passing the entrance of the floor, the shop was nowhere to be seen. Taesan went forward and opened the door. A small noise sounded, and the room on the 92nd floor appeared.

"I'm here."

And inside, was the shop owner.

He was smiling at Taesan with a warm expression on his face.

"Finally, it's you."

"Yes."

The shop owner revealed his teeth. His face was filled with emotions that couldn't be hidden.

"What is your wish?"

Taesan spoke quietly.

The shop owner had a wish. He was playing the role of the shop owner in the labyrinth to fulfill that wish.

However, no adventurer, not even a ghost, could catch the shop owner's attention except for Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Only a strong person at the level of Taesan could fulfill the shop owner's wish, and that was the implication. Even in the strengthened labyrinth based on Taesan, the fact that he was staying on the 92nd floor was proof enough.

"Yes, my wish. I've been stuck in this dump for so long because of my wish. It's all for my wish."

The shop owner laughed kilkil.

"I said it's my wish. It's simple."

He clenched his fist with his blazing eyes. His beard trembled.

"I am the lost king."

"What did you lose?"

"Everything!"

The shop owner shouted.

"My kingdom! My glorious treasures! My people! And the heights I reached! I lost everything! Dammit! They stole it all from me!"

The shop owner raged like a madman. His intense emotions shook the space.

A level where emotions alone could have a physical impact on the surroundings. It meant he was a strong person who far surpassed the guide's top-level leaders.

Taesan received the emotional explosion with a calm expression. He already knew the shop owner wasn't weak. Taesan asked without changing his tone.

"So, what is your wish?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's something that's been worn out. It's a goal that's scattered everywhere. But to me, it's a value that's more important than anything else."

The shop owner chuckled.

"I want revenge."

[Sub-quest starts] [The shop owner of the labyrinth wants you to achieve their revenge.] [Condition: The death of the Transcender.] [Reward: Rakirata will determine it based on your achievements.]

* * *

Revenge.

It wasn't surprising. The shop owner was a lost king. If someone of that level of strength had lost everything, it was likely that there was external interference.

"I was a resident of a world where only dwarves lived. We called our planet 'Dverja'."

The shop owner, who had poured out his emotions, spoke with a calm face.

"That place... was a beautiful place. If you dug into the ground a little, you'd find ore deposits like rocks, and if you entered the mine, all sorts of precious minerals would pour out. Dverja was the ideal world for dwarves. We made countless weapons there, competed with each other, and lived."

The shop owner's eyes were filled with longing.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I was the king of that place. I had been so for hundreds of years. I obtained the only jewel in the deepest part of the underground, where no one dared to enter, and created an unbeatable weapon that even the greatest blacksmiths said was impossible to make. I was the master of Dverg. Everyone worshiped and respected me. I received their absolute faith.

The shop owner's face suddenly distorted.

"Yes! I could have become a transcendent being! I could have received the faith of all people! If I had reached the pinnacle, I could have truly become the master of the planet!"

Taesan listened quietly to his story. The shop owner couldn't hold back his emotions and shouted violently.

"But! That damn thing invaded my world! It made me a slave and turned my people into dogs of faith!"

"Is that the interference of a transcendent being?"

"Yes."

The shop owner gritted his teeth.

"It trampled on me and forced me to create a weapon for itself. I refused! I'm the king! I'm the master! But... in front of that damn thing, everything was meaningless."

He let out a dry laugh and spread his arms.

"I lost everything. But I don't want to become its slave. That's why I abandoned everything and came here."

"Is your wish the death of the transcendent being?"

"Yes."

The shop owner twisted his mouth."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'll kill the one who took everything from me and reclaim what's rightfully mine. That's my wish."

The conclusion of the story was that everything was lost due to the intervention of the Transcender.

I could have reached great heights, but it was all ruined by external interference. Thinking about the futility and sense of loss, it was only natural that he sought revenge.

It was a simple and predictable story, but that's what made it a solid motive.

"There must have been a reason why I couldn't achieve my wish until now."

No matter how excellent an adventurer you are, you'll eventually hit a wall as an immortal. But the shop owner's goal was to kill the Transcender. There was a reason why other adventurers didn't notice. The ghost spoke in a tone that was both amazed and impressed.

[Do you think that's possible? There must have been a reason why I was ignored. How many adventurers do you think can achieve that?]

"That's a ridiculous thing to say. It's right in front of me."

The shop owner smiled deeply. The ghost couldn't refute his words.

Taesan quietly organized his thoughts.

The goal of the quest was to kill the Transcender who had stolen the planet.

"It's not going to be any different from the quests I've done before."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan had been handling planets governed by someone. Right now, it was the 88th floor quest to deal with immortals who wanted to become gods. The opponent had become stronger, but the basic method was similar.

"It won't be that difficult."

If it were a strange and unusual wish, it would have been a struggle, but the shop owner's wish was one that could utilize his experience.

The shop owner also spoke about it with a calm face.

"Just recall the quests you've done so far. The scale has increased, but it's not that different. There's just one difference."

"What's the difference?"

"That damn transcendent being governs not one, but multiple planets."

* * *

"......A transcendent being governing multiple planets?"

"That's right. I don't know them all, but at least five, I'm sure."

"Wait a minute."

Taesan raised his hand. Suddenly, his head became complicated. The scale had become much larger than he had expected.

[From here on, I'll explain.]

At that moment, a voice rang out.

The floor of the labyrinth collapsed, and Balbalbaba appeared.

[I thought it wouldn't be necessary, but it seems this quest needs a rough explanation.]

Balbalbaba began to speak to Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Do you know the criteria for distinguishing between transcenders?]

Taesan nodded his head.

A transcender who has reached that state through faith.

And a transcender who has reached that state by grasping the concept.

While there may be differences in detail, they can be broadly categorized into these two types.

[Let's simply call a transcender who has reached that state through faith a "faith transcender," and a transcender who has grasped the concept a "concept transcender."]

"Is that a real title?"

[No, there isn't a fixed title, but I've come up with it for convenience. Categorizing is quite a hassle.]

Taesan chuckled at Balbam's grumbling.

[Go on. A faith transcender can reach that state by receiving the worship of many for a long time. You've also reached that level.]

"It's still unstable, though."

Taesan could only exist as a complete transcender in a place where he was worshipped. In other spaces, it was difficult to say that he had truly reached the state of a transcender.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No matter what, it's a position that has transcended the wall. A rare phenomenon that appears in the universe. And another one. The Concept God, who dominates concepts and governs the laws of the world. They are truly the transcenders in the true sense of the word."

Rakirates, Maria, Baltazah, and others.

"They are the ones who dominate the concept of victory and struggle, and the concept of choice itself."

"They are literally transcenders."

"They can engrave their own concepts onto the world, free from the constraints of time."

The current Taesan is also aiming for that realm.

"It's an extremely rare realm even on a universal scale. That's how powerful it is. It has a power that refuses to be compared to the Faith God."

Taesan couldn't say that he could defeat them. Balbam said quietly.

"The one who invaded the planet of the shop owner is the Faith God. You, who received the worship of many mortals on your own planet, rose to the position of the Faith God."

"Does the Faith God also invade other planets?"

It was an unheard-of thing. Balbam replied.

"It's simple. That Faith God certainly reached a realm, but it demanded more. It didn't intend to stop at the realm it had reached."

"So, it invades other planets and steals their faith?"

"He wanted to become a Concept God."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The one who has transcended to a realm beyond the concept of the universe.

[I wanted to escape the place where I relied on faith and reach a place where I could stand alone. But you know, that's something that can't be achieved through one's own efforts. So, I changed my goal. If I couldn't become a concept god, I would gain the power to rival them as a faith god.]

"Is that possible?"

[It's not impossible. You're also stabilizing your own realm by accumulating faith on multiple planets. Think of it as an extension of that.]

It wasn't a wrong statement. The planet that received Taesan's faith wasn't just Earth. During the process of clearing quests, planets that worshipped him began to emerge.

[That transcendent being invaded many planets. He drove out or killed the owners of those planets and plundered their faith. He accumulated a great deal of faith that way. The difference in realm itself might not be significant, but he would be far stronger than any ordinary faith god.]

"How many planets do you dominate?"

[I don't know. But... it's over ten.]

"Hmm."

Taesan let out a dry laugh. The gaze of Balbam, the shop owner, turned towards him."

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When he came in, he repeated what he said. He said that there was no adventurer who could fulfill that wish. He said it was meaningless to enter the labyrinth. But... he somehow managed to obtain the possibility."

"I'm doing it for revenge. That's my only value."

The shop owner sneered.

"I can do anything for that."

"I acknowledge it. You're a lunatic, but you're a lunatic who obtained the possibility. However, it's just a possibility in the end. It's up to him to accept your quest."

"Do I have the right to refuse?"

"There's always the right to refuse. The labyrinth doesn't force you. You can avoid the battle and go down. It's the same this time. If you want, you can ignore the quest and go down."

A transcender who receives the faith of over 10 planets.

If you look at it simply as a divine being, he would overwhelm Taesan. Even now, he couldn't guarantee victory. From a probability perspective, it could be even lower.

But...

"...he looks like he's enjoying it instead."

"That's the kind of situation it is."

Taesan smiled.

The fact that the opponent was strong meant that there was much to be gained from him.

Taesan looked at the shop owner.

"What's the reward?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'll give you everything I have, within the range allowed by the labyrinth."

If it's everything, that includes the equipment from the store too.

"It's not bad, is it?"

"Then..."

Taesan nodded his head.

"I accept."

[Quest accepted.]

A joyful light appeared on the face of the store owner.
