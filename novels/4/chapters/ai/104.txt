105. 21st Floor. The Mad Spirit (Part 1)

Taesan opened the community chat as he descended. It had been quite some time since he entered Vekweseta. It was a moment when other Alone Mode players were also experiencing changes.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Are you alive?] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Huh?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: What's up? You didn't say anything, so I thought you went back.] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: I was just somewhere for a moment. So, how is it?]

As Taesan expected, Kang Junhyuk and Lee Taeyeon were descending quickly.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Have you reached the 6th floor?] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Yes. I'm dealing with the Lizardman right now. The swamp area is annoying, but it's manageable.]

Taeyeon posted calmly. He seemed to have matured a bit after overcoming the trial of Valtaja.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Come down quickly. There's something to discuss on the 8th floor.]

On the 8th floor lies the Trial of Hubris. It exists with its own arrogance. Since his trial could be abandoned on his own, the danger was minimal. It was a trial worth discussing enough.
[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Yes. Thank you, Taesan.]

Afterwards, they chatted about various things. It seemed Lee Taeyeon and Kang Junhyuk had many questions for Taesan, as someone who had descended deeper than them and was curious about the information on the lower floors.

Taesan answered their questions and naturally, conversations about other players also came up.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: I hear there are a few people who have cleared the 2nd floor now.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Yes. ...There are also many who have died.]

Clearing the 2nd floor. Compared to before, it was much faster and in greater numbers. However, reaching the clear point was still elusive. No matter how hard they tried, reaching around the 20th floor seemed to be the limit. Descending all the way to the end of the labyrinth was practically impossible.

Unless a special method emerged, returning to Earth was also impossible except during forced return.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Well then, take care.]

Taesan closed the community chat and arrived at the 20th floor.

There, in the safety zone, was Lelis.

"Oh? You're still alive? I haven't seen you for a few days and thought you were dead."

"I had somewhere to go for a moment."
"Phew. That's a relief. Can't afford to die just yet. Still plenty to do."

Lelis waved cheerfully.

"See you next time!"

Taesan left her farewell behind and headed towards the boss room on the 20th floor.

There, stood the guide of sins he had spared, Gagorat.

"...You've come."

"Yeah."

Taesan nodded. Gagorat swallowed his saliva.

"Now... Are you going down?"

"I have to go down."

They entered the labyrinth for strategy. Gagorat smirked once and spoke.

"Well then, I have something to tell you."

"About the guides of sins on the 21st floor?"

"Yes."

Taesan agreed not to relay information about him to the adventurers below on Gagorat's request.

But those were adventurers up to the 20th floor. The agreement was only with the adventurers of the 2nd tier. His next destination was the 21st floor, where adventurers of the 3rd tier awaited.

"Adventurers of the 3rd tier may think highly of you, Taesan, but they may also believe you're dead. So meeting them could be tricky for you."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"The one thought dead appeared alive. Adventurers of the 3rd tier, who realized the falsehood spread by the 2nd tier adventurers, will soon inform the leadership of this fact.

That's the end of it. There's no way to defeat the leadership that has descended to the depths.

So Gagorat was considering a way to avoid the adventurers.

"It doesn't matter."

But Taesan did not heed Gagorat's words. A flustered Gagorat urgently pressed on.

"Do you intend to kill them all? You can't do that. If the guides of sins die, the information is automatically transmitted to the leadership. Then they will come down."

Meeting them is not allowed. Killing them is not allowed either.

"Above all, even if it's Taesan, adventurers of the 3rd tier... are not weak."

Jagan died by Taesan's hand, but it wasn't because he was weak. It was because he underestimated and let his guard down. If many from the 3rd tier rushed in, Taesan was also in considerable danger.

"Avoiding them is the correct answer."

"I know, but I have no intention of avoiding them."

Avoiding the adventurers is not impossible. Unlike the 2nd tier, who need to find rookie adventurers, they would be gathered in one place. So all Taesan had to do was figure out how to pass through that place."
However, sneaking past meant giving up on rewards. Taesan had no intention of suffering unnecessary losses.

Gagorat tried desperately to stop him with a worried expression. If Taesan went wild, it would also be known that he had spread falsehoods. In that case, his own life would be forfeit.

As he tried to persuade him somehow, Taesan spoke.

"I have prepared the means."

"Means... What do you mean?"

"Yeah. So just stay still. Don't interfere for no reason."

After the warning, Taesan descended to the 21st floor.

[This is beyond the entrance of the labyrinth.] [There are beings here that won't die even if stabbed with a sword or hit with magic. This is a space where darkness and light are mixed.] [21st floor quest begins.] [Defeat the boss of the 21st floor and proceed.] [Reward: Spirit Gem] [Secret Reward: ???]

21st floor. Referred to by adventurers as the 3rd tier.

Now considered to have left the lower levels behind, Taesan knew what awaited him here.

Taesan broke through the labyrinth. As he opened the door, a searing heat was felt.

[A lesser fire elemental of the labyrinth appeared.]

There was a flaming sphere shimmering in the air. Taesan raised his sword.
**Spirit.**

Itae-yeon had mentioned their appearance. She had also said that spirits like the Spirit King would appear if he descended, but that was a story for later.

As Taesan recalled her words one by one, the spirit recognized Taesan.

The spirit's body swelled up, and soon fireballs shot out like a shotgun.

Taesan kicked the ground and flew through the air. He leaped towards the spirit and swung his sword down.

However, it dealt no damage. The fractured spirit merged back into one.

"As expected."

It was just as Itae-yeon had said. Taesan didn't panic and kept his distance.

Itae-yeon had said that physical attacks wouldn't work. She had tried all sorts of methods but nothing worked, so they had to find another way.

Taesan swung his sword a few more times afterward, but it was ineffective. Even his skills yielded the same result.

As Itae-yeon had said, physical attacks seemed entirely useless.

"Then how about this?"

A blue light emerged from Taesan's sword.
**Power obtained from the Bequesta. Taesan cleaved the spirit in half with a sword infused with Ora.**

Crackle.

The form of the spirit momentarily distorted but soon returned to normal.

"Still no effect."

Taesan backed away and activated Frost Arrows and Blazing Orb. Flames and ice pierced through the Fire Spirit.

Similarly, it had no effect. The spirit remained floating just as before.

"Just as described."

It had been written that they wouldn't fall even with magic on the 21st floor. I just tried to understand it easier by confirming it.

There was a different way to deal with spirits. And Taesan knew that way.

Before that, he thought he would try using what he had.

"How do I use that force
**[Simple.]**

The spirit clarified Taesan's question.

[Spirits are beings of nature. Therefore, attacks originating from nature won't work on them. Ora, being something bestowed by the gods upon the world, also doesn't work. However, black magic is magic derived from demons.]

"So damage goes through because it's not natural?"

[It's a bit more complex, but that's the basic idea. That's why demons find it easier to descend to the third rank.]

The conclusion was that black magic could defeat spirits. Taesan cast black magic again, this time using all of his stored magical power.

[You have activated Marcothias's fake flames.]

Flames erupted. The spirit tried to dodge, but the fake flames engulfed the entire room, impossible to evade.

Uuuuuuu!

[302 damage to the Lesser Fire Spirit of the Labyrinth.] [You have defeated the Lesser Fire Spirit of the Labyrinth.] [Obtained the core of the spirit.]

"Alright."

It was an unexpected victory.

Taesan quickly began to assess the situation.

"Still, not quite at the level to use effectively."
Currently, Taesan's magical power was too low. He had barely managed to defeat one using all his magic, so descending further into the labyrinth was out of the question.

"I should move according to the information."

Taesan broke through the rooms of the labyrinth. Although Lesser Fire Spirits appeared occasionally, he ignored them all and pressed forward without issue due to the basic difference in their stats.

Before long, Taesan reached the outer chamber.

"You know well. There's no need to explain. This is the strategy for conquering the 21st floor."

The ghost didn't seem surprised, perhaps accustomed to this by now.

Physical force and magic were ineffective against spirits. Taesan could defeat them using black magic, but it was more like a loophole.

So, there was another way.

Taesan opened the door to the outer chamber. A mad laughter echoed.

"Hehe! Hehehe! Hehe!"

A white spirit was spinning round and round in the middle of the room. Its design was reminiscent of a simplified character, with an impression that could be called cute, but contrasting with that was the mad laughter flowing out of it.

"Hehe! Welcome, guest! Hello!" [You have encountered a mad spirit.]

* * *

"Hello! Nice to meet you!"
The white spirit screamed with mad laughter. Taesan calmly responded.

"I want to descend into the labyrinth."

"Descend?"

The spirit tilted its head, not fully understanding Taesan's words.

"To defeat the spirits in order to do so."

"Spirits? Defeat?"

A moment of intense hatred flashed in the spirit's eyes.

"Defeat them! Defeat those who abandoned me! Kill and take from those who are not rightful! Make them pay!"

The white spirit shouted angrily, its face filled with madness and hatred.

"This one hasn't changed."

The ghost muttered, recognizing the white spirit. It had encountered one before.

The crazed white spirit waved its hand.

"Straight five, third to the left! There's a hidden room there! Inside lies the core made by the king who abandoned me! Bring back the hidden core while avoiding the trap! Then I will give you power!" [Subquest initiated.] [The crazed spirit hates everything that made it this way. It wishes for you to bring back the source of nature protected by the trap.] [Reward: Skill to attack spirits.]
