Chapter 397

397. 80th Floor, Lion King (1)

[Ring of the Victor of the Struggle.] [Attack Power +300] [A ring worn by one who has overcome their own struggles. Although they did not ultimately reach the highest level, their power cannot be ignored.] [Used ???.] [Obtained the Proof of Struggle.] [Proof of Struggle.] [A proof that one has dedicated their life to struggle. This proof holds strong power in itself.]

One ring and one material item. As a ring with high pure attack power, its performance was considerable. Although it needs to be confirmed with Half-ran, the power it exudes is not something to be underestimated.

And I obtained a special skill.

[Special Passive Skill: Absolute Authority] [Proficiency: 1%] [Enemies with lower levels than you will feel absolute authority from you and lose their will to fight. Resistance is impossible unless one has extremely strong mental power and strength.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A skill that can be obtained without using any power and dominating the floor. Maybe no one has ever achieved it. It was a unique skill that only he had obtained.

[There are all sorts of amazing skills out there.]

The ghost let out a sigh.

[Considering that even the boss of the 79th floor couldn't resist, it's likely that most of the undead couldn't resist either. It's a real headache.]

The labyrinth is a place for the undead.

The 80th floor will likely have a similar outcome to the 79th floor. The significance of each floor has almost disappeared.

Barbarbaramba went to meet a wizard for him.

I'll come back when the conclusion is reached.

Taesan took a step forward. The beasts quietly bowed their heads to bid Taesan farewell.

And he stepped into the 80th floor.

[80th floor quest started.] [Pass through Acular's trial.] [Reward: Collapse's Reality.] [Secret reward: ???]

As he passed the shop owner and arrived at the floor, there was a black orb there.

[You have discovered Acular's altar.] [First discovery bonus] [Your strength has permanently increased by 100.]

A terrifying power was emanating from the black orb."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan had met many gods' altars before, but it was the first time he had encountered an altar that emitted such a strong, intense aura. Even a weak person would have their body and mind collapse just by being near it.

[Acularus, the God of Destruction.]

The ghost's low, mournful voice echoed.

The transcendent being who governed the realm of destruction. That was Acularus.

[Among the gods residing in the labyrinth, he was the one with the most evil tendencies.]

"More evil than the God of Fall?"

The God of Fall, who treated all mortals like toys, was undoubtedly closer to being an evil god from a human perspective.

[In some sense, Acularus was even more extreme.]

"What's the point of this?"

[Acularus literally desired the destruction of the world. He wanted the collapse of order, the disappearance of laws, and the shattering of the minimum human dignity that humans should uphold, as well as their faith in gods, the contracts that bound souls, and everything else. He wanted the destruction of all things.]

The destruction of all concepts and matter.

That seemed to be the principle behind the God of Destruction's actions.

[From a mortal's perspective, he was an evil god. Nothing more, nothing less. I've had a hard time dealing with him too. He really gave me the chills.]

The ghost shuddered violently.

[As a god, Acularus had a terrible relationship with other gods as well.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Then, of course, I wouldn't like it either."

[Maybe... that's how it is.]

Taesan approached the altar of Acylus. A strange power rose up and enveloped Taesan.

Without any hesitation, it quietly proposed a deal, its tone implying that it was unavoidable.

[Sub-quest starts] [Acylus wants to test you, who have come to its altar. If you accept, a trial will come to you. If you overcome it, a reward will follow.] [Reward: Acylus will determine it based on your achievement.]

"I accept."

Taesan nodded his head.

The clear condition for the floor was to pass Acylus' trial. Refusal was not an option. The power flowed out from the altar, and soon a figure began to take shape.

It had gray hair like a lion's mane, and its entire body was muscular. The large sword it held seemed to prove its strength.

[...Huh?]

The ghost let out a voice of disbelief.

The power slowly dissipated, and the manifestation of the figure was complete.

The being that appeared in the labyrinth opened its eyes.

[Acylus' servant, the Lion King has appeared.]

* * *
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Hooh."

Taesan's voice trembled. The Lion King. It wasn't the first time they had seen each other. They had met the guides and had seen his face once before.

"If my memory is correct, you weren't one of Acular's kind, were you?"

The Lion King opened his mouth, looking at Taesan and the ghost.

"It's been a while, brave warrior."

[You, what's going on.]

The ghost asked in a tone of disbelief.

[...Did you sacrifice yourself?]

"The result is already right in front of us, what are you asking?"

The Lion King said calmly. The ghost let out a sigh.

[You crazy guy. You went down to the labyrinth and ended up becoming a servant of a god, not even a saint?]

A servant of a god. Taesan had a memory of seeing one during the trials of Rakiratas. Now, as an immortal, he could fundamentally understand what kind of existence that was.

"A tool, huh."

A saint was a relationship established through a contract.

In exchange for a mortal offering themselves to a god, the god would grant them appropriate power and authority.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The number of contracts made with mutual consent was extremely small. Immediately, Maria didn't make any offers to anyone except Taesan and Iteayeon.

To that extent, God also cherished His apostles. He respected their opinions and sometimes even risked His life to protect them, like Levienov.

There was an exception, like Hora, but that was a special case. The general relationship between an apostle and God was one of mutual respect.

But God's servants were different.

They were just God's tools.

They were used according to God's will, and could be sacrificed at any moment. All the power, values, and experiences they had accumulated until now would become meaningless, leading to the worst possible outcome.

That's why the ghost couldn't understand.

[Is that the ending you wanted? Giving up everything and being used by God without a care?]

"Impossible," the Lion King denied lightly.

"Even if I became Acylus's servant, I am strong. No matter how powerful God is, I won't be discarded like a disposable tool."

[It doesn't matter how you look at it, your essence won't change. To Acylus, you're worthless. You've only sacrificed yourself for that.]

The ghost spoke sharply.

The Lion King fell silent."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ha! There's no way Acularus would accept someone like you as a disciple. The same goes for other gods... But I still can't understand. Do you have to go that far just to kill Taesan?..."

"...... Shut up."

The Lion King gritted his teeth.

His eyes were filled with rough anger.

"I won't tolerate it! I won't accept it!"

His loud voice echoed through the labyrinth.

"That guy has only been in the labyrinth for less than three years, and yet he's already reached the 80th floor! I won't tolerate it! Such an existence shouldn't be allowed! It's a mistake!"

His face was filled with anger, resentment, and jealousy.

"And inferiority complex, too."

"You, an existence that disrupts the order of the world, shouldn't be in this world! I'm just correcting the order of the world!"

His voice was filled with strong determination, making the listener's heart shrink and emotions waver.

Taesan received it calmly.

"In the end, you're just jealous of me."

"What, what?"

"Isn't that right? I, who have only been in the labyrinth for a short time, have already reached this place. You guys have invested an enormous amount of time and effort, but you still can't reach this place."

It was an astonishing feat. Even the ghosts were amazed by Taesan's rapid growth and couldn't help but admire him.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Lion King hated such a towering figure.

[……I see. As I thought, you always said that. We are the strongest in the world. It's just that this labyrinth is ridiculous, but we are the greatest warriors in the world.]

"Hero……."

The Lion King's face distorted.

Those who reached the depths of the labyrinth were mostly stronger than anyone else in the outside world.

The Lion King was no exception. In reality, he had confidently descended to the depths without any obstacles. During that process, he had been confident that he was the strongest.

But the depths did not allow him to pass.

It completely shattered his confidence and talent.

As he struggled with feelings of inferiority and self-loathing in front of the depths, others similar to him began to appear one by one.

They all had exceptional talents like the Lion King, but they couldn't overcome the depths and were stuck.

The Lion King felt deep relief in his heart. He wasn't the only one who was struggling. Even those who were extremely talented were stuck here. This was the inevitable limit of mortals.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Lion King thought to himself and gathered them together, creating a guide for evil.

He was the one who led the creation of the guide for evil.

As he was comforting himself and maintaining his confidence, a being named Taesan appeared.

Despite not having exceptional power, he broke through the labyrinth at an unimaginable speed, and even the deepest parts couldn't stop him.

The Lion King couldn't accept it.

"It's amazing, if you think about it."

Absolute authority was being exercised.

The Lion King was resisting the effects of absolute authority with his twisted pride and inferiority complex.

[But I still can't understand. Did you sacrifice yourself for that?]

"Shut up."

The Lion King spoke harshly.

"You don't know anything. I can't accept that."

"You're throwing away your life because of your confidence. It's not an unusual thing."

It happened often on Earth as well.

Especially for someone like the Lion King, whose existence was derived from his own strength and the confidence that came with it, it would be even more so.

It wasn't a surprising thing.

The Lion King sneered, baring his teeth.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Your words are not wrong. I am a tool. But thanks to that, I gained power."

Ku ku ku ku ku......

The labyrinth trembles.

The Lion King's power amplifies. His entire body begins to distort as if it's about to collapse.

[The Lion King has activated the Collapse Oath.]

Taesan could sense it.

That was the authority of Acylurus.

The Lion King reaches a high level of enlightenment. He breaks through the boundary of the mortal wall that had been holding him back with his power.

"Oh! Oh! Oh!"

The Lion King forcibly corrects his crumbling mind and swings his great sword with all his might.

"Hahaha!"

The Lion King bursts into laughter.

A sense of omnipotence that he had never felt before was dominating his entire body.

Although his body and mind were slowly collapsing, it didn't matter. The current sensation was just too enjoyable.

"Is this immortality!"

He had reached a place he couldn't reach even if he had given up his life, a place he could only gaze at from afar.

It felt like he could do anything.

The Lion King looks at Taesan with a smile.

"Die! You wretched...".

His words trail off.

"...Ah?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is it possible to surpass the limits by offering one's body and mind as sacrifices?"

Taesan was gazing at him calmly.

It was as if he was saying that obtaining immortality meant nothing.

And surprisingly, the Lion King also sensed it.

When he met Taesan, he realized that Taesan had reached a high level.

But he thought it was an unstable, beginner's stage.

It was only natural. Taesan had become too strong too quickly. In fact, he had already reached immortality. It was an impossible feat by normal standards.

He must have used some kind of shortcut. The Lion King didn't doubt it.

So he thought that if he became immortal, he could overpower Taesan.

But now that he had actually reached immortality, he realized.

The level of immortality Taesan had reached was different, a stable one.

"......This can't be! How did you...how did you get there already!"

"Shut up."

Taesan drew his sword and sheathed it.

"Let's end this quickly."
