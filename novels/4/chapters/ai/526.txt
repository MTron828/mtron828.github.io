Chapter 527

527. 95th Floor. Essence (1)

Tat.

Taesan stepped into the labyrinth. The wizard was waiting for him.

"Good job. You cleared the quest wonderfully."

According to the rules, he should receive a suitable reward.

However, the wizard's face looked troubled.

"What should I give him...?"

At this point, a mediocre reward didn't hold much significance. Taesan had become too strong, exceeding the system's boundaries and entering a new realm.

There weren't many rewards that held meaning for him.

Above all, his achievement this time was killing a single god.

It wasn't a proper god, but still, it was a god. A suitable reward was necessary, but even the wizard couldn't easily calculate what would be a fitting reward for killing a god.

After much deliberation, the wizard made a decision.

"I think you don't need simple equipment right now. Let's keep it simple."

The wizard snapped his fingers. The system's power enveloped Taesan.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have acquired the special passive skill [Conversion of Defense to Attack].] [Special Passive Skill: Conversion of Defense to Attack] [Your defense will be converted to attack power.]

A very simple explanation.

It was easy to understand. Taesan let out a small sigh of admiration.

"Is this the passive version of the conversion skill?"

"Similar."

A conversion that can switch attack and defense values. That's what became a passive skill.

"Anyway, defense doesn't mean anything to you right now, does it?"

Taesan nodded. The attack power value was meaningful because it had obtained physical strength conversion. But defense wasn't. Defense had no value whatsoever.

If there was an opponent who made defense meaningful, they couldn't be Taesan's opponent. It meant they couldn't escape the system's concept. From the start, if they were at that level, they couldn't even scratch Taesan's self-protection.

All the enemies Taesan was currently facing were at least at the high divine level.

The defense value was meaningless. Even if it was all converted to attack power, there was no loss.

Taesan's current defense was around 30,000.

The attack power suddenly increased by about 50%. For Taesan, who had a multiplier, this change was more valuable than any skill or equipment.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But if it's like this, the conversion skill will be meaningless, so I'll change the conversion skill in a different way."

[Special Activation Skill [Conversion] has evolved. Cooldown has been reset.] [Special Activation Skill: Conversion] [Mana Consumption: 1000] [Can adjust attack power by up to 10%. This skill can only be used once a week, and the value will return to normal after the attack.] [Condition: High-Rank Swordsmanship [Ability Sword]] [When attacking with a sword after adjusting attack power with Conversion, an additional 10% value is added.]

"The additional value has decreased."

"It can't be helped because of balance issues. But it's still satisfying, isn't it?"

"That's true."

It's not just a simple 20% with the addition of the sword of addition and the sword of multiplication.

In simple calculations, the normal attack power is 15,000, and when using full power, it increases to 25,000.

If I use the multiplication power again, its might will be incomparable to when I defeated the gatekeeper.

"I wonder how far this absurd power can go?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A physical power that even a wizard couldn't predict. It had already gone far beyond the realm of its designer.

But the wizard was thrilled.

"Show me. How far can you go with my concept and dominate it?"

The wizard muttered to himself. The reason he created the labyrinth was to multiply his magic. It was undeniable evidence.

The reward processing was complete.

Now it was time to resolve the curiosity.

"How did this happen?"

Why did Bright die?

And how did Goshin know about it?

Taesan aimed to consume the boundary line. If he hadn't predicted Bright's death from the beginning, it would have been an impossible strategy.

The wizard smiled wryly.

"It's easier to show you directly rather than explaining it in words. Follow me."

The wizard grasped the air and pulled it. Space opened up, and the wizard and Taesan entered it.

It was a vast universe.

There were no stars or meteorites in sight, just an empty space.

And in the center of it, there was a massive golden wall.

"......This is."

Taesan was overwhelmed in an instant."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was a wall made of perfect divine energy. It wasn't just a simple metaphor, but it was truly like the sun.

'Can I pierce through it?'

He wondered if he could compress the boundary line he possessed and turn it into a blade to pierce through.

The answer came immediately. It was possible.

However, the moment he tried to pierce through, the divine energy would backlash and engulf him.

Even if he surrounded his body with the boundary line, he couldn't withstand the divine energy's collective power. He would soon meet his demise.

And that wasn't the end of it.

The golden wall had multiple layers of concepts surrounding it.

A transcendent being who observed a single concept would unfold the concept's protection with all their might.

It wasn't just one or two, but over ten concept gods had combined their powers to create this golden wall.

"I understand why even the high gods can't pierce through it."

This was the safest place in the world, at least when it came to the high gods.

Taesan looked around the perimeter of the wall.

"Is there no one else but us?"

"There's no reason to protect a castle with no one to protect."

The wizard flew away, and Taesan followed behind.

As they moved along the wall, Taesan could see it.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Part of the wall was devastatingly destroyed.

Teian touched the ruined wall.

There was no sign of a new beginning. Only the concept of this world could be felt from the traces of destruction.

"Come in."

The magician went inside.

Within the golden wall was a dwelling prepared for one existence.

There was a corpse inside.

The corpse of a goddess.

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Diana and Veldegki were being used, and Amelia was being treated as a plaything, while Taesan directly confronted the Transcendent Being.

"As expected."

There were several gods who were hostile towards Taesan. However, they didn't seem to be able to shake the universe itself, even if they joined hands with the gods of destruction.

Even the god of death tried to kill Taesan, but only to the extent of maintaining the balance of the universe.

But the god of downfall was different.

He was distorted. Even when he was a mortal, his distortion was visible to the extent that it could be recognized.

"It was a flawed concept from the start."

The wizard said with a scrunched-up face.

"It wasn't a complete downfall that earned him his divine name. He wanted to throw away many things, the world itself, and even himself into the abyss. It was a transcendent being who reached that point through such emotions and actions. But... even if he was distorted, I thought he would at least maintain a minimum level of goodness."

But that wasn't the case.

The god of downfall had crossed that line.

"I don't know when it started, but he made up his mind."

"Made up his mind?"

"If he had simply betrayed this world and killed Bright, he wouldn't have been able to do it alone."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You can break through the wall of gold, but you can't kill Bright. Bright is also a transcendent being. It's impossible for the master of one concept to kill the master of another concept unless there's an overwhelming difference in power.

So, the God of Fall shook hands with Goshin.

"That means we've been preparing for this for a very long time... at least several decades ago."

The magician shook his head.

"I don't know, but at least we can't survive."

A calm but cold voice echoed. There was a cold, calculating intent in his eyes.

"I don't know where you are now, but I'll find you and tear you apart. Even if you're a transcendent being, you need to be shown what happens when you betray the world."

"Will I never meet you again?"

Several transcendent beings moved on their own. It seemed unlikely that they would meet the God of Fall again.

But the magician couldn't give a clear answer.

"I don't know."

The magician gazed at Taesan with an ambiguous expression.

"He's definitely watching you."

The God of Fall was hostile towards Taesan.

"Goshin is also targeting you. I don't know what will happen, but... I'll make sure it doesn't become a problem."

Taesan nodded."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Then, I'll show you and explain it roughly."

The magician clapped his hands. The space opened, and a passage leading to the labyrinth appeared.

"I have something to do. The earth's rift is currently unmanageable, but at least there won't be any problems. You've sealed it by defeating the gatekeeper. We'll need to clean up later, but... not now. Let's go down first. I'll tell you again when it's settled."

"There's something I want to ask before that."

Taesan looked at the magician. The magician quietly smiled, as if he had read something in Taesan's gaze.

"Don't worry. You'll find out what you're curious about on the next floor."

"......"

"Then, let's see you next time."

The magician jumped through space. Taesan, left alone, looked around for a moment before returning to the labyrinth.

He went down the stairs.

A system window appeared, announcing the start of the 95th floor.

[95th Floor Quest Start.] [Discover Your True Nature.] [Reward: A Stable, Unified Digit.] [Secret Reward:???]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A transcendent being flashed through Taesan's mind. Taesan opened the door to the 95th floor.

Inside the 95th floor, there was only one door.

Creak.

The door opened.

And Taesan arrived in a new world.

It was a world, but no longer a world.

Everything was corroded by the flow of time, except for one thing. There was no life anywhere.

As soon as Taesan touched the ground, the floor caved in. Everything began to crumble and scatter into dust.

"This is a place I've never seen before."

It wasn't a world that had died due to the pollution of the gods.

It was a world where everything had corroded and turned to dust due to the pure flow of time. The planet's shape was barely maintained, but if someone were to tap it lightly, it would crumble into cosmic dust.

"It's time for a planet to turn to dust. It's been a long time."

Taesan took a step forward.

In this dead world where nothing could be felt, one existence was sensed.

Taesan flew through the air. In an instant, he had traversed half the planet and arrived at his destination.

"......Oh, I see. So it was someone who did this."

There was an old man there.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan said calmly.

"It's been a long time."

"It hasn't been that long."

The old man smiled faintly.

[You have met the god of essence. You have encountered the Essential.]
