**Chapter 538**

**538. The Pantheon (4)**

[What?] [Lakiratas. What does that mean?]

The transcenders looked bewildered. Lakiratas didn't react and spoke to Taesan instead.

[What should I call you now? It's ambiguous whether to call you a transcender or a god.]

Taesan also hesitated for a moment. Was he the master of the boundary or a savior?

After a brief thought, Taesan spoke.

"You can call me a savior."

His name, empty and devoid of anything.

But Taesan instinctively knew that this name revealed himself better than the title of boundary master.

[Is that a savior? It's a fitting name.]

"Lakiratas, I need a story."

The magician asked with an ambiguous expression. Lakiratas denied it.

[There's no need for a story. I'll give him a trial.]

"Why does it have to be you?"

[You guys don't have the qualifications.]

Lakiratas spoke calmly.

[I have goodwill towards him, but I don't have affection like you do. Nor do I harbor malice.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

There was no transcendent being who could refute that statement.

It was because it was actually true. The gods of the labyrinth, including Mashin and Maria, favored Taesan. They showed him kindness and wanted to give him many things.

Their feelings were close to affection. It was difficult for them to sincerely want to kill Taesan.

On the other hand, transcendent beings like Derusha, who opposed him, wanted to kill Taesan no matter what. Even if it meant crossing the line.

[Then are you neutral?] [I don't think I need to explain that myself.]

It was a calm, but unrefutable statement. Rakiratas gazed at the wizard.

[Strong individuals need to be given trials that match their strength. That's how they can realize their own abilities and move forward. Isn't that why we entered the labyrinth in the first place?]

“That’s… correct.”

The wizard quietly affirmed.

Why did they create the labyrinth?

It was because they wanted to see capable individuals risk their lives to prove themselves.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"To prove the current him, it's not possible with an ordinary opponent. Only those who have transcended can prove it. It means I'll be that opponent."

"Hmm."

"What needs to be done will be done. There's no problem."

"That's that."

What has Taesan achieved?

"It was necessary for them to understand that as well. If Lakiratas confirms it through trials, they wouldn't be bad either."

"What's important is whether he accepts it or not."

Lakiratas gazed at Taesan with a subtle smile.

That smile had a sense of certainty.

"What are you going to do, Ascetic?"

Taesan nodded his head.

"Good."

* * *

"Good."

Lakiratas was satisfied with Taesan's answer. He applauded.

"Then the story is over. Let's disband this meaningless meeting. We need as many Transcendents as possible to see and accept him, so I'll leave that to you."

With that, Lakiratas left, as if he had no more reason to stay.

The Transcendents showed signs of disturbance and confusion.

Even to them, who had reached a high level and possessed power close to absolute in the universe, Lakiratas' current behavior was extremely unsettling.

"Are you okay?"

Mashin asked Taesan, who replied calmly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I thought it was necessary, so I did."

He had to fight with all his might to understand himself.

But until now, he hadn't found an opponent worthy of him. He had tried with Mantara, but Mantara was far too weak. It wasn't worth exerting himself.

But if it was Rakiratas, he would be a sufficient opponent.

A transcendent being who governed two concepts, and even searching the entire universe, it was hard to find an equal opponent.

If Rakiratas became his opponent, he had no reason to refuse.

He would have to risk his life, but that was always the case.

Taesan turned his gaze.

"This will do."

At the end of his gaze was Dersha.

Dersha, who was close to being the representative of the transcendent beings hostile to Taesan, looked at him with a scowling face.

[Hmph.]

Dersha's face was dissatisfied, but she didn't say anything more. She turned her body and left the temple grounds. A few transcendent beings followed her.

"How long do you think it'll take?"

"Um..."

The wizard was flustered, but quickly thought and came up with an answer.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's about creating a realm where two transcendents can fight... but Rakirates is a problem too. Your power and strength are unknown. It'll probably take about a week, I think."

"A week?"

"It's just the right amount of time."

"Then, can you create a personal space for me?"

"A personal space?"

"It's necessary for the test."

To see how he handles his power, what's at the bottom of it.

The wizard let out a sigh. But his eyes soon calmed down.

"Well... okay. I won't refuse. I'll create one of a suitable size. And I'll help you with it."

[Hmm.] [I'm worried, though... Rakirates. Is he going to try to kill me?]

The wizard muttered with an ambiguous expression.

But in the end, there was no opposition.

Under the tentative agreement, the duel between Taesan and Rakirates was set.

And Taesan was in a white space.

"It's vast."

An endless, infinitely expanding closed space. Taesan lightly tapped his foot. The action was light, but the aftermath was not.

Kuuuuuuuuung!

The physical force spread throughout the entire space through the platform. It was enough to destroy the foundation of a planet and bring it down.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But nothing happened.

The white space perfectly absorbed the aftermath of Taesan.

"It's sturdy."

A space created by many gods, including the wizard, Mashin, and Maria, for Taesan.

As many transcenders combined their powers to create it, it was extremely solid. Even if it was a divine power, it seemed like it could withstand it without any issues.

There was no need to control his power. Taesan could unleash his full strength here.

"I'll experiment for a week and see."

[Rakirates... or something.]

Bardley let out a sigh.

The god of struggle and death.

One of the strongest transcenders, ruling over two concepts.

Taesan was determined to fight that being with all his heart.

[Is that okay?]

"If I count by the concepts I govern, I have three. There's nothing to be pushed back."

Spiritual domain invasion. Boundary. Physical strength.

He had three transcendent powers. If he included the ones he obtained through spiritual domain elevation, he had even more. There was no reason for him to be pushed back by Rakirates.

[That's... true.]

Bardley also realized that fact. Now, Taesan could be said to be on par with Rakirates.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No, that's right. This is what I've been forgetting."

He had become overwhelmingly strong, too quickly. Until he entered his own inner self, Taesan was strong, but his limits were clear. He couldn't reach the transcendent being who dominated complete faith or certain concepts.

However, after fighting against the usurper and spewing out his true self, Taesan had become extremely strong.

"That's wrong."

Taesan denied Bardley's thoughts.

It wasn't that he had become strong suddenly.

He had simply reached the place he was supposed to be.

"Of course, the probability of winning is virtually zero."

He had only just obtained his authority. He hadn't reached the high realm for long.

On the other hand, Lakiratas was an ancient transcendent being who had survived the war with faith from the beginning.

Taesan, who had obtained authority, realized that it wasn't just about possessing it, but about how to handle it that mattered.

Accordingly, the limits of the authority that could be drawn out were different.

Lakiratas would be able to control his concepts almost perfectly.

"So, I need to learn to control my power properly."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ash-colored energy flowed out from Taesan. He had thought of awakening the beast that was sleeping within him. If it were anywhere else, the aftermath would be unpredictable and impossible to control, but in this place, it was possible.

Grrr.

The ash-colored beast appeared in the white domain. Its power surged, and the domain trembled with anxiety.

"......Just for a moment."

Taesan scowled. He had tried to control it, but it was too late. The beast, thrilled to be free, broke out of its restraints and revealed itself to the world.

Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!

A crack spread through the absolute domain, created by numerous transcenders.

* * *

Taesan stood before the vast land.

It was a boundless expanse.

The horizon was invisible, and it was enormous. When Taesan touched the land, he felt a massive energy.

"It's solid."

[You and I can go wild to our heart's content.]

And before Taesan stood Rakiratas.

With his brown hair, he wore clothes similar to those of a barbarian. His expression seemed languid, but his gaze was fixed clearly on Taesan.

His size was not much different from Taesan's.

The god of struggle and death, Rakiratas, in his true form.

[Good.]

Rakiratas, who had surveyed the domain, smiled in satisfaction.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's enough at this level, isn't it? No, it might be lacking. You've already broken it once, so..."

"I didn't mean to do that."

The white domain was shattered in Taesan's hand.

Although the Transcendents restored it, it meant that Taesan had broken a domain with overlapping concepts.

"It's impossible with simple powers... I wonder what method he used."

Lakiratas opens his hand.

"I can find out this time."

The space splits, and a handle appears.

Quadruple click.

A massive double-edged axe appears, large enough to cover a person's body and still have plenty left over.

It's not small, considering the weapons Taesan has faced so far. The immortal who sided with Goshin wielded a heavenly sword that reached the sky.

But Taesan could feel it.

The axe's aura.

It contained struggle and death itself.

"This is my own sacred artifact, which I've been using since my mortal days."

Oooh.

The ripple spreads, and the typed aura tries to engulf the space.

"There's no need to wait. There are also those who are watching."

He feels hundreds of gazes directed at him.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Each one of them was a being that had reached a great realm. They were Transcenders.

[Then let's start right away.]

A strong sense of pressure.

Rakiratas had now genuinely decided to kill Taesan.

The world itself was changing. A great and lofty concept was directly targeting Taesan.

"This is...".

The world was targeting Taesan.

Although he had fought against Transcenders several times before, the pressure was much greater than ever before.

If he couldn't transcend, his life would be in danger just because of this.

"It's burdensome."

Taesan took out Bardley.

[Oh, this doesn't feel right. This doesn't feel right.]

"Be quiet."

Taesan said briefly.

He focused his mind. A gray aura enveloped his entire body.

Rakiratas revealed a faint smile.

[It's changed. The feeling is different from when I saw him before. I could read him back then, but... now I don't know.]

Rakiratas smiled in satisfaction.

[It's really good.]

The battle was about to begin.

"There's one thing I'd like to ask before that."

[What is it?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You wanted to fight me from the beginning, didn't you?"

When discussing how to handle other Transcenders, Rakiratas had a face that showed no interest.

Only his enthusiasm and struggle towards Taesan were visible. Rakiratas laughed.

[I can't read you. Neither can other Transcenders, including myself. You're not a Transcender, nor a high priest. You're a completely new concept.]

Emotions are typified and appear in the world.

[What kind of struggle are you showing us?]

His voice was extremely excited.

[Can the new you, who is struggling, accept death? If you don't accept death, what will be your ending?]

Rakiratas revealed this. The boiling emotions even heated up the surrounding air.

[I just want to see it. Your struggle and death.]

Rakiratas is the God of Struggle and Death.

He has devoted himself to those two concepts and has reached his current state.

Taesan recalled the words Bardley had said about Rakiratas in the past.

The God of Struggle and Death is the most unusual god.

Note: "Transcender" is a term that seems to be specific to this story or world, so I've left it untranslated. It appears to refer to a group of powerful beings.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As a god, I act very lightly, break contracts, and give power to those who please me, and help them.

It meant that I, as a god, act according to my own heart.

Rakiratas wanted to see the struggle and death of Taesan.

So, I gave Taesan a trial.

That was all. Taesan gritted his teeth.

"The principle of action is simple, isn't it?"

[What's difficult to think about? I've reached the end, and I'm here.]

Rakiratas laughed loudly, holding an axe.

[Come on, savior. I am Rakiratas, the god of struggle and death.]

The atmosphere became intense. Rakiratas spoke calmly.

[I will seriously try to kill you. Prove your struggle and death to me.]

* * *

Taesan put strength into his legs. In an instant, his body moved away from Rakiratas.

First, he created some distance. He needed to understand how to handle the concept of struggle and death. Mana gathered in Taesan's hand.

[You've activated the frozen world.]

Zzzt!

A wave of coldness swept in, enormous and huge, as if it would swallow the world whole.

[Oh.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Rakiratas was amazed.

Each small fragment of ice contained the physical strength of a mountain.

[Is this the controller of physical strength? This is a new concept I've never seen before.]

There were thousands, tens of thousands of physical strengths. The mountain had conducted many experiments on its authority over the past week. Among them was an experiment to see if physical strength could be infused into magic.

I tried it, and the answer was correct.

Each fragment could contain its own physical strength. Even the small snowflake contained the mountain's power. That in itself was a tremendous force.

Kukukukuku!

The physical strength imbued with coldness was heading towards Rakiratas.

Only those who could manipulate physical strength itself could wield such enormous violence.

If the opponent was a mantra, this alone could render them on the brink of death.

But the opponent was the god of struggle and death.

Rakiratas didn't even swing its axe.

It simply flicked its finger lightly.

And within that, the aura of nothingness spread its ripples.

Zzzzzz!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And with that, the cold energy is shattered. The cold energy containing the power of Taesan is broken as if it were nothing. In an instant, the cold energy and the physical force within it disappear.

"What is this."

Taesan bit his tongue. He knew it wouldn't work, but he didn't expect it to be so easily nullified. This was beyond his expectations.

[But it's not enough.]

Rakiratas holds up an axe.

The power within it converges.

And Taesan senses it. If he touches that power, he will die. Taesan's ashes-colored aura appears, and a boundary forms around his entire body.

[Show me everything you have.]

The axe swings down. Rakiratas's power covers the world.

[Rakiratas has initiated the world's struggle.]

The world itself changes.

Everything within the realm and space is dominated by Rakiratas's power.

And the world itself begins to fight against Taesan.

It attacks Taesan with a force smaller than air and wind, down to the atomic level.

If it were just a simple attack, it wouldn't be a problem. Taesan can fight against the world itself.

But this time it's different.

Each and every atom contains Rakiratas's fury and power.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The pressure was far greater than containing physical strength in the frozen world that Taesan had controlled. The world itself had changed into Lakiratas's possession.

Kagagagak!

Atoms stuck to Taesan, tearing off his boundaries, and tried to directly strike his physical body. His boundaries began to crumble.

Taesan gathered his ash-colored aura.

And expanded it into a domain.

[You have activated the Boundary World.]

Transcendence. While obtaining boundaries, the chaotic domain also changed into the Boundary World. The world made of boundaries covered the world. A certain range was placed under Taesan's control.

Kagagagak!

Each individual's boundaries clashed, competing for control of the world. Even in the space of fluttering ash, Lakiratas's struggle did not back down.

Ka-a-a-a-ang!

And it burst out.

Lakiratas's struggle, which covered the world, and Taesan's Boundary World were together.

Taesan dodged the scattered fragments and clicked his tongue.

'Is the Boundary World also limited in its suppression?'

The boundary was a power that stood in the middle. From a superior perspective, it was clearly dominant. Yet, it was barely suppressed, which meant the opponent's power was overwhelmingly strong.

[Hoo.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Rakiratas was amazed, just like Rakiratas.

[No extra burden, just blocking it. I thought I'd take some damage.]

"The burden was overwhelming."

If the boundary world hadn't been activated, his life would have been in real danger.

If he didn't respond aggressively, he would die. Taesan drew his sword. The boundary covered Bardley.

Just like that, he drew a line. The boundary cut through the world like a sword and charged forward.

Rakiratas didn't dodge and instead wielded his axe.

Kaang!

The axe and boundary collided. The boundary didn't budge and tried to slowly devour the axe.

[Hmm.]

Rakiratas let out an interested voice and unleashed his authority. The struggle wrapped around his axe.

He created a kind of wall to prevent the boundary from overflowing.

Karluk.

But the boundary didn't budge.

It clung to him like a living beast, trying to dye the struggle with its own color. In the end, Rakiratas swung his axe. The boundary bounced back.

[Can't destroy it, I guess. Is it something stronger than me?]

Rakiratas, who had been muttering in amazement, soon came to a realization.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No, it's not a concept of strength, but rather something entirely different. This is amazing."

Rakiratas smiled, seemingly very satisfied with the fact.

"Good."

Boom.

The axe wavered. Rakiratas spoke, facing the towering Taesan, who was on guard.

"Just remember one thing. As long as my struggle doesn't stop, I am unbreakable. Nothing can bring me down. Not even the gods could corrupt me."

"......What's that supposed to mean?"

Taesan let out a dry laugh.

Unbreakable as long as the struggle doesn't stop?

The struggle of the god of struggle would never cease. It was equivalent to saying that he was absolutely unbeatable.

"That's what it means to have two powers. It's a unique power that only I possess, unlike other transcendents. Well, if you have your own dark powers, it might be different."

Rakiratas smiled confidently.

"That's also a kind of entertainment. Go ahead and show me."

There was anticipation in Rakiratas' eyes.

"......That's right."

Taesan's eyes narrowed. He gripped his sword tightly.

"Very well."

He put strength into his legs. Taesan charged directly at Rakiratas.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$The translation of the given text to English is:

"And Rakira laughed as if he was very pleased with that action."

Here's a breakdown of the translation:

* 그리고 (geurigo) means "and"
* 그 행동이 (geu haengdong-i) refers to "that action"
* 라키라타스 (rakiratasu) is a proper noun, likely a name, so it's left as is
* 무척 기껍다는 듯 (mucheok gippeumdaneun deus) is an idiomatic expression that means "very pleased" or "delighted"
* 웃었다 (useotda) means "laughed"
