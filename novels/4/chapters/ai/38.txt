Episode 39

39. 6th Floor, A Humble One Seeking Magic (1)

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: The 6th floor is nothing special. It's just an easy floor, so we can pass through without trouble.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: ... That doesn't sound like good news for us.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Doesn't it just mean there's always a risk of death as usual?]

* * *

[Rune of Strength] [Increases strength.]

A brief explanation. It was exactly as described. It immediately boosts strength upon use.

There are no conditions or restrictions for enhancing stats, making it a meaningful item even in higher floors. Although it loses some significance in the early stages, it's still much better than ordinary equipment.

[Used Rune of Strength.] [Strength + 10]

Strength increased by 10. It was a significant figure, more than enough as a reward from the boss, even overflowing.

And after a long time, a title was also obtained.

[Title: Recognized One] [The gods have acknowledged your determination and strength.] [The gods favor you.] [Mana + 2]
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

There's also a small amount of mana attached. Considering that gods show clear favor to those they like, it was a meaningful title in its own right.

And here's another one.

[Title: Adapting One] [You have achieved significant results in the labyrinth.] [Strength + 2] [Agility + 2] [Intelligence + 2]

A title obtained upon clearing the 5th floor. Effects include a +2 to all stats. It's a basic title received by everyone, but its value is not insignificant. Simply put, it's like gaining an increase of 6.

And a secret clear reward.

[You used ???] [Obtained Robe of Shadows.]

"Huh?"

Robe of Shadows.

That word rang a bell. Taesan confirmed the information with a puzzled look.

[Robe of Shadows] [Equipment held by a humble thief. It allows you to evade death in insignificant situations.] [Turns invisible for 1 second.] [Can only be used once per hour.]

"A true invisibility robe."

Invisibility for 1 second. Unless there's a detection skill or some innate sense to read through it, your location cannot be tracked.

"Pretty good, huh?"

With a 1-second limit and a one-hour cooldown, its value doesn't diminish.
Here is the translation of the text:

---

Originally, obtaining the Robe of Shadows wasn't something easily achievable even beyond the mid-levels.

The state of invisibility. The value inherent in that word is immense.

Taesan whistled as he put on the black robe.

"Is it roughly over?"

With so many rewards, it was a bit confusing. It seemed like he had confirmed everything bit by bit.

And now, he was thinking of changing his weapon.

He swapped out his magnificent sword and shield. His defense decreased by 5 but his attack power increased by 4.

Without a shield, there might be a slight issue with defense, but with his current stats, he didn't really need 5 points of defense.

He judged that it was better to increase attack power and quickly clear things up. Even ghosts seemed to agree.

"Dual swords? Good choice. My swordsmanship leans that way too."

"Then will you teach me quickly?"

"You can't do it right now? You'll die using it with your stats?"

"...Is that really swordsmanship?"

With nearly 150 strength, dying while using swordsmanship was hard to grasp. The ghost chuckled.

"I made and refined that swordsmanship myself. Don't worry, you'll rank high even in the labyrinth."


Here is the translation of the text:

---

Speaking so confidently, there shouldn't be any issues with that part. Taesan opened his status window.

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 16] [Shield: 32/32] [Health: 655/655] [Mana: 87/87] [Strength: 146] [Intelligence: 77] [Agility: 105] [Attack +25] [Defense +17] [In excellent condition.]

"Good." Taesan nodded. He was definitely stronger than before. With acceleration in growth thanks to numerous skills, catching up to Lee Taeyeon wasn't such a distant goal.

Taesan descended to the 6th floor.

[6th Floor Quest Start.] [Defeat the boss of the 6th floor and proceed.] [Reward: Scroll of Engraving.] [Secret Reward: ???]

"So, the basic reward for the 6th floor is the Scroll of Engraving."

Muttering to himself, he opened the door. The dwarf who had been waiting greeted him.

"You're here early?"

"There wasn't much else to do."

The path straightened out and the enemies grew stronger. That was all. There was nothing to search for or analyze.

The dwarf chuckled at Taesan's response.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

"Only you would say there's nothing much to it. Cleared the 5th floor. Normally, I'd congratulate you on starting to adapt, but I guess there's no need for such words from you. Keep pushing down."

Taesan glanced at the dwarf expressionlessly. The dwarf spoke up.

"Do you have quests or something like that over there?"

"What do you think?"

The dwarf grinned mischievously.

"No need for an answer, huh."

The dwarf said it wasn't out of kindness but investment. Seeing Taesan's expression, the dwarf clicked his tongue.

"I know the answer. They say you're smart, but there's still a long way to go."

The dwarf quietly pointed at a ghost.

"What happens when you go farther down than that guy? Don't worry until then."

The ghost had gone down to the 85th floor. The dwarf said his investment would pay off if they went down even further.

"Are you going to buy something?"

"I'm not sure."

Taesan looked around at the items, but nothing seemed worth getting.

Basic equipment had mostly been prepared.

Buying more here would only result in a difference of +1 Attack, +2 Strength, or so.

Equipment obtained while navigating the labyrinth would suffice; he didn't want to spend money unnecessarily.

"Do you have any Dust of Blessing?"


Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

"I don't have any right now. I originally thought they were useless, so I just bought them as a last resort."

"Well then, is there really nothing worth buying?" Taesan asked, stroking his chin.

"When will good equipment come out?"

Even the items the dwarf showed now are good enough. According to Jung-geun's words, in Hard Mode, you have to pass the 10th floor to find them in stores.

However, there are no items that drastically reduce the damage received, as Itaeyeon had mentioned.

The dwarf pointed below the labyrinth with his finger.

"So we have to pass the 10th floor first?"

"Then I'll come back when that time comes."

Such equipment would be quite expensive. Since there was nowhere in particular to spend money, he was thinking of saving it. The dwarf noticed Taesan's thoughts and waved his hand.

"They say you're smart. Good luck."

Taesan arrived at the beginning of a new floor.

Under his feet was a sticky swamp.

"Just as the stories go."

6th floor. It's the floor where Lizardmen appear. In terms of strength, they are not much different from orcs.

However, the entire floor is covered with small swamps that hinder movement.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

According to Itaeyeon, Lizardmen were quite challenging due to their lack of movement restrictions in swamps.

Of course, Taesan didn't care about that.

He drew his staff.

"[You cast Fireball.]"

The fire collides with the swamp.

"Sssss!"

The swamp screams. It writhes violently like a living creature, then gradually quiets down.

"[You have defeated the swamp.] [Proficiency in Penetration increased by 4%.]"

In this way, the swamps on the dungeon floor are considered living beings. They are immune to physical damage but vulnerable to fire, easily cleared with a fire staff.

"You really know everything. How do you not know this?"

The ghost muttered in a puzzled voice. Taesan moved through the room.

Before long, he could spot a Lizardman.

"Kaaak!"

If you were to make a lizard look human, it would look just like that. The green monster thrusts a trident.

Lizardman. A monster equivalent to orcs, barely manageable in Easy Mode only after descending further down.

Taesan reaches out solemnly.

*Thud.*

The quickly hurled spear is lightly caught. The Lizardman's pupils dilate.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

"Kak, kaaak!"

Grunting, he tries to pull out the spear, but it remains motionless as if stuck in a wall. Taesan swiftly pulls it out.

[20 damage to Lizardman.]

"Kaaaak!"

The Lizardman collapses with a scream. Taesan steps on it smoothly. After a few stomps, the Lizardman disappears.

"Kaaaah......"

[You have defeated the Lizardman.] [Easy as expected.]

"It shouldn't be difficult against ordinary monsters."

He had gone through countless trials of gods and secret chambers. His stats now allowed him to run without stopping up to the 10th floor.

It didn't make sense to struggle against just one Lizardman.

[Your Spiritual Growth has activated. Agility permanently increases by 1.]

Spiritual Growth. Always a refreshing rise. And there was one more thing to check. Taesan confirmed his mana increase.

[Mana: 88/88]

Proof of victory. A designated stat rises every time an enemy is killed.

Mana has increased by 1.

"1 point per kill? Not bad at all."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

Usually, there were about ten to twenty monsters per floor. Each time you passed a floor, it meant mana automatically increased by 20.

The ghost murmured gloomily.

["You brush that off as not bad. In my opinion, it's a truly insane skill."]

Each time you passed a floor, designated stats increased by ten, twenty. It was a skill that no one else possessed.

However, Taesan had a similar skill. Spiritual Growth. Thirst for victory. Proof of struggle, and so on. Relatively, its value could only diminish.

Taesan continued to sprint through the labyrinth.

* * *

["Your level has increased."]

Halfway through the labyrinth, Taesan leveled up. He could obtain at least one skill.

[Special Constant Activation Skill: Forced Action] [Proficiency: 1%] [Can move a little despite situations that would hinder action.]

Actually, whether Taesan erased the swamp now or not didn't matter at all. So, without erasing it, he acted and gained an additional skill.

Forced Action.

Once proficiency reached 100%, it would be a good skill without any constraints, even underwater.

In addition to Spiritual Growth, the increase in stats was quite high.

The ghost spoke as if bored.

["Boring."]

This translation captures the essence and details of the original Korean text.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

"It's easier said than done."

There wasn't a single crisis. Sometimes three lizardmen appeared simultaneously, but I managed to deal with them smoothly.

Trial of the gods, Secret Rooms, and Named Monsters.

The differences were enormous. I was starting to understand for sure.

"If I hadn't faced the trial of the gods, what would have happened?"

["I would have been much weaker. I wouldn't have gotten through this easily, right?"]

That's the point. Of course, gods exist in the mode. They impose trials and give appropriate rewards to those who pass.

Those rewards are significant, making a big difference, preventing the gap from narrowing between those who cleared the trial and those who didn't.

Ghosts are the same. NPCs and monsters with names. If Itaeyeon didn't see it, it meant that if you pursued safety thoroughly, you might not even know their existence.

Gods and NPCs. And Named Monsters.

Three realizations.

The gap could be larger than the difference between Hard and Alone modes.

"That's tough."

If there's a problem, it's that sometimes you can't do anything even if you know about it.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

God is an arbitrary existence; he does not impose trials based on the strength of those who come to his altar.

In the end, others had no choice but to ignore the gods and named monsters as much as possible.

But is that really the right approach?

Even though Itaeyeon cleared it, she wasn't sure she could clear it again herself. It was half necessary even for a safe clear.

As I descended, I thought I would look for it.

What kinds of people are the gods?

Do friendly NPCs really exist?

* * *

Taesan wandered through the labyrinth. He encountered lizardmen, killed them, and wandered again.

His current defense is 35.

There are skills to be gained. But there was something else he needed to find first, rather than skills.

Before long, he found the secret room.

"You're being obvious about it."

The secret room was perfectly hidden, but right in front of Taesan now was a half-protruding brick.

As Taesan pressed the brick, a passage appeared with a clicking sound.

"Monsters can't find out with just that much. I know that well as I've lived long enough."


Taesan entered the passage. Inside, there was a small room. On the floor, there were a table and numerous magical tools scattered around.

"Oh, you're already here?"

A tangled mess of blue hair was visible. Lillis grinned widely and waved her hand.

"Yahoo! Hello!"
