Chapter 255

255. The Realm of Hell (4)

The Hell King's Palace was imposing.

The walls were covered with a dark gray color that was as smooth as charcoal, and the guards standing at the door looked like they were at a high level.

The Great Mountain approached with high expectations.

The Hell King's Palace.

The place where the Hell King resides.

Will he be an immortal or a transcendent being? Or maybe he is a powerful mortal being. Whatever he is, he won't be weak, so I have high expectations.

"Great Mountain, from now on, I'll take care of things. I'm sorry, but from now on, no matter what happens, please don't move, Great Mountain."

Annetsha bowed her head with a guilty face. Great Mountain didn't plan to move first, so he nodded.

The carriage stopped in front of the guards.

The guards raised their windows.

"Who are you?"

Annetsha and Cuined stepped out of the carriage. The guard's face contorted when he saw Annetsha's face.

Great Mountain scowled.

The guard's face looking at Annetsha was filled with discomfort.

"The Princess of the destroyed Vespera...... What business do you have here?"
(Note: "Melhan" in the last sentence is translated as "destroyed" to maintain the context of the story. It seems that Vespera is a kingdom that has been destroyed.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"I have come to see the Demon King."

"Who is the Demon King?"

The guard asked, his tone akin to that of an interrogator.

Annetsha seemed familiar with such an attitude and spoke.

"I have come by the command of the God of the Gods."

"The God of the Gods?"

The guard's face trembled.

Annetsha gave a subtle nod to Taesan, and Taesan appeared.

"...Human!"

Kaga!

The sword moved.

The guards stared at Taesan with eyes full of caution. Annetsha separated the two.

"I have come to this place by the command of the God of the Gods. We are not your enemies."

"...Wait. I will summon someone to make a judgment."

One of the guards ran inside.

The remaining guards kept their guard up and glared at Taesan and Annetsha.

At least, their attitude towards the princess was not like that.

After a short while, the guards returned with people who looked like knights.

They wore black armor and were formidable. From an outside perspective, it was an impressive level, similar to Quanved at the present moment.

"Annetsha. I have come by the command of the God of the Gods."

"Yes. I will make a request to the Demon King."
Here is the translation of the text:

Annetsha spoke calmly. The knight in armor sneered.

"Really, you're making me annoyed. Come along."

The knight roughly turned his body around. His attitude was completely lacking in consideration or courtesy.

Annetsha smiled wryly.

"Come, let's go this way. Lord Taesan."

Taesan followed the knight, looking at him with a distant gaze.

As they walked through the inner courtyard of the Devil's Castle, the attendants and maids who were busy with their work noticed the knight and looked at him with disdain. They then looked at Annetsha and cast a scornful glance.

After exchanging greetings, they murmured to each other. Although their voices were very soft, Taesan's hearing was so sharp that he could hear the sound of a conversation from a distance of several kilometers.

"Really, have you come to ask for favors from Lord Ma again?"

"You've abandoned the people you should have protected and now you have no conscience."

Annetsha's words were not kind.

As they walked on, the knight spoke up.

"You should be protecting the old man's village instead of wasting time. You're making trouble by using the name of the Lord of the Devil."

"Ah."

Cwaneq smiled with a hint of a smile on his face.

"Are you going to follow me? You seem to be holding back because you don't like the situation, but that's just a limit."

Note: The text appears to be a scene from a novel or a fantasy story, and the characters and setting may be fictional.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, the aura is flowing out."

The knights face each other, pumping out their aura and responding.

"'Is it really the blood of a lowly being? Dare to reveal one's aura within the Marquis's mansion? What are you trying to do?'"

"'That's something I'll say. I understand that you all dislike the princess, but this is a bit too much, isn't it?'"

Quanad clenched his teeth.

"'You're really the kind of person who would have been defeated if I hadn't lost my strength.'"

"'You're just making empty noises. You're a failure who can't even descend into the labyrinth.'"

The knight mocked Quanad.

"'She is not a demon from the Underworld, but a demon from another world. Originally, she should have been banished and made a slave. But she was spared by the benevolence of the Marquis and left alone. And now, she keeps coming back to the Marquis's mansion, using the Marquis's name. Be grateful that she's not in prison.'"

The knight spoke harshly.

"'You're the same, Quanad. If you received the blessings of the Marquis, be satisfied with that. Be grateful that you're here and don't take it for granted.'"

"'Hah, these guys are the real deal.'"

Quanad laughed sarcastically. The knight's gaze turned to Tai-san.

"'You're the same, human.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

The cold black gaze of the demon looked up at Taesan.

"I came here according to the Lord's command, so I won't touch anything, but if I create chaos, I won't forgive it."

Taesan looked at his eyes blankly.

The demon's eyes were cold.

The knight suddenly felt a chill. Reflexively, he reached for his sword and looked around cautiously.

They were led to the throne room. The knight said he would go and report to the Lord of Darkness.

Quaneda sat down on the sofa and grumbled.

"The princess is also quite strong. She can come out strong if she wants to. Since it's the Lord's command, we have to follow it unconditionally, but why is she acting like this?"

"It's impossible. Their words are true."

Annetsha said with a bitter tone.

"I'm not like you, a demon from the underworld. Here, I'm just a foreigner."

"Princess..."

Taesan fiddled with the tea cup.

It was filled with various gems. Even Taesan, who didn't know their value, knew that they weren't ordinary things.

Even though it was the Dark Lord's palace, it was unnecessary to have such high-quality items.

"You all are being treated quite well, aren't you?"

"Really?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Quaneed nodded his head with a gloomy face.

"'The demons of the underworld place great importance on their nobility. They look down on demons from other worlds and despise those who don't inherit noble bloodlines.'"

"'You're no different from humans.'"

"'That's the characteristic of those who claim to have wisdom. And the princess is in a rather peculiar situation.'"

Quaneed spat.

"'The noble-blooded princess you're talking about. But demons from other worlds look down on her as if she's inferior. No, it's even more severe. They believe that if they had noble bloodlines like that, they would be superior.'"

Tai Shan listened to Quaneed's story calmly.

"'After all, the Lord of the West directly summoned you to the underworld. It's natural that those who are jealous of the Lord's choice are numerous.'"

He values bloodlines and looks down on those from other regions.

He was really just like a human.

Tai Shan's face turned cold.

"'There's no fun in that.'"

"'Sorry, Tai Shan.'"

Annetsha bowed her head deeply with a guilty face.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It seems that Lord Tae-san is not a demon, so if we try to do something, the other side might try to intervene and grab the reins. That's why I asked you to be quiet first."

"You don't need to apologize."

They waited.

But even after an hour, no one showed up. Kwane'd shook his head in laughter.

"This is really getting strange. Are you not embarrassed?"

"Ah... Lord Tae-san, Kwane'd."

Annetsha stood up with a flushed face.

"May I leave my seat for a moment?"

"Okay."

Lord Tae-san nodded, having realized what was going on.

"Come back."

"Okay."

Annetsha left the room.

The room was left with only Lord Tae-san and Kwane'd. Kwane'd opened his mouth.

"I'm grateful anyway."

"What's that?"

"That you're showing such a bright face. It's the first time I've seen it."

"Really?"

"Yes. I don't know what the queen was like before I came, but when I met her, her face was always gloomy. She would smile in front of demons, but when she was alone, she looked sad. To be honest, I was a bit worried. But since you came, she's always been bright."

Lord Tae-san listened quietly to Kwane'd's words and then asked:

"Does the devil not interfere?"

The devil, Lucifer, had personally summoned Annetsha to this place.
Here is the translation of the text:

Looking at the thing that was given to Tai Shan as a trial, it seemed that she cherished it greatly.

However, after that, there was no sense of care for her. Conan said it as if it were obvious.

"The Lord of Heaven is a transcendent being. We are all His children. Is it possible for Him to take sides in the existence of one being? Unless it's a physical harm, He won't directly intervene."

This was a statement that was easily accepted. The Lord of Heaven was indeed their god. Even the demons who hated Arnetsha showed respect for the Lord of Heaven without any change.

Under such circumstances, it was impossible for the Lord of Heaven to favor Arnetsha who was suffering. Unless it's a direct harm, He wouldn't intervene.

It was a direct statement.

"What do you want from me?"

The Lord of Heaven knew that Tai Shan would never give up.

However, he still showed this. It was hard to understand what she wanted from him.

A little later, Arnetsha returned.

Tai Shan looked at her.

She had lost everything in the world where she originally lived, thanks to the gods.

Her family, friends, and everyone she knew had all died. Finally, she was betrayed by the people she had trusted.
Here is the translation of the text:

And then she was summoned to the underworld.

Alone, without anyone knowing, she fell here.

And even here, she was despised. She was the only one who survived, but she couldn't protect the ones she should have protected.

What was her heart like?

She noticed the gaze of the Tai Shan, who was looking at her, and Annetsha smiled bitterly.

"I'm fine."

Her eyes, looking at the Tai Shan, were filled only with faith.

"There is the Tai Shan."

"...".

He expected the Demon King's mansion. But what he expected was power and strength.

This kind of problem was not of his interest.

The door opened. A knight appeared.

"Ho, the Demon King summons you."

* * *

"Enter here."

The giant door welcomed them. The knight who guided them warned.

"The one sitting here is the Demon King. I'll punish anyone who does something foolish. Be careful."

Snap.

The door opened.

At the end of the long corridor, the Demon King was sitting on his throne.

A man with a black, curly hair grown to the tip of his head was looking at Tai Shan with a displeased face.
Here is the translation of the text:

Around him, dozens of knights were guarding him. He was not weak. All of them were at least 20 floors high in terms of strength, which meant that they had a power similar to the world's strongest outside. There were dozens of them. And as for the Demon King, he was infinitely stronger. "I wouldn't be able to win against someone like him even at the peak of my strength," he thought. He had power that exceeded 50 floors.

However, that was all. The Demon King's eyes narrowed even further.

"I came here by the order of the God of the Mountain," he said.

"Yes," Annetsha replied, nodding. The Demon King opened his mouth again.

"I'm going to abandon this land. You know what kind of place it is."

"I'm fully aware," Annetsha said. "Many demons left to eliminate the wicked people who believed in the old God, but no one has returned. How can you be sure you won't be like them?"

The Demon King's face grew annoyed.

"The God of the Mountain has personally taken care of you. No matter how much it's the God's command, it's impossible to let you die in vain."
Here is the translation of the text:

The Demon King twisted his face.

"I felt sorry for you, no matter how many times I thought about it. Come and help me take care of you."

There was jealousy on his face.

It was an unpleasant face, as if he was worried that the demon he believed in was paying attention to other demons in other worlds.

The face of the Great Master of the Mountain was as cold as it could be.

All my expectations had been met. Annetsha spoke calmly.

"So, what do you want?"

"Prove it. Show me your strength."

Kuung!

The knights drew their swords simultaneously.

Their powers resonated with each other, pressuring Annetsha, Kwaneed, and the Great Master of the Mountain.

The Demon King clenched his fist. The Demon King's power was also beginning to overwhelm. Annetsha's expression became rigid, and Kwaneed let out a forced laugh.

"Looks like it took a long time to make such a pitiful seal, didn't it?"

The seal of the demon tribe, amplified by each individual's power.

The knights, numbering tens, and the Demon King's power converged to pressure the Great Master of the Mountain and his companions. Annetsha's face became rigid, and Kwaneed was also struggling to breathe.
Here is the translation of the text:

"If you can't hold on, I'll tell the Lord Marshal. You'll die there, relying on your strength. Please show mercy, I beg of you."

The Demon King laughed.

He hated Arnetsha.

She was a half-breed from another world, but she was a descendant of the Demon King. As a rival who threatened his legitimacy and succession, he couldn't tolerate her.

Moreover, she was someone who received the Lord Marshal's favor, which made him even more angry.

The Demon King couldn't accept this fact. He believed that he was the Lord Marshal's most favored servant, and that the Lord Marshal loved him more than the apostles. He had no doubts about this.

In this situation, the Demon King's descendant from another world, the demon, was brought to this place by the Lord Marshal himself.

The Demon King hated this. Arnetsha wanted to make the Lord Marshal angry somehow.

Her strength was no match for the Demon King's. Even Quaned, who was standing beside her, was no match for the Demon King. The Demon King thought that no human could surpass him in strength, no matter how powerful they were.

So, he decided to crush them first.

And then, he would tell the Lord Marshal.

As the Demon King's words carried weight in the Netherworld, he believed that the Lord Marshal would not ignore him. He planned to make Arnetsha disappoint the Lord Marshal somehow.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he was planning and feeling delighted with his gaze, the Taesan was caught by the Mountain God.

"Um?"

The Demon King's face stiffened slightly.

Taesan was looking at himself with a blank expression in the midst of the pressure of strength.

It was as if he didn't feel any burden at all.

The Demon King further amplified his strength and turned it towards Taesan.

The amplified strength within the seal was something that even the Demon King himself couldn't withstand.

However, Taesan's expression didn't change.

The Demon King's face trembled.

Taesan muttered to himself.

"It's all below expectations."

It's boring.

The Demon King and the humans were not so different, and the Demon King was not stronger than his expectations.

A ghost spoke up.

"The Demon King who destroyed my world is abnormally strong. Even if he's at this level, it's not bad, is it?"

Said in a calm tone, it wasn't wrong. With strength at the level of 50 floors in the labyrinth, he was almost like an absolute ruler of a world.

"You just expected too much."

"Ah, yeah."

Taesan looked at the flustered Demon King.

"I asked you to show your strength, didn't I? Show it to me."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

With the ability to handle magic becoming more comprehensive, there was something that could be done.

Tae-san pulled up the magic.

The magic pulled up by Tae-san began to mix with the aura.

[You have activated the Sadohua [Mixed with the aura]!] [You have activated the emotional turmoil of the Lao family!]

"What?"

The demon king opened his eyes.

The seal cracked like glass, and Tae-san's aura began to spread out gradually.
