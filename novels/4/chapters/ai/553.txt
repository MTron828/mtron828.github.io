**Chapter 554**

**554. 97th Floor. Moebius's Lizard (1)**

**Cycle. The God who governs itself.**

There was a being that naturally passed through the mind of Taesan.

The snake that governs the cycle of all things. Uroboros.

[There's no need to talk about this in this narrow space.]

Arirnan says so and claps his hands.

At the same time, the world changes.

Arirnan's aura covers everything.

And they arrived.

A vast, empty space that is extremely thick and intense.

[This is...].

Akasha lets out a sigh. She, who was once Arirnan's disciple, had memories of this place.

This was Arirnan's domain.

Arirnan's longing face swept through the empty space. The energy surrounding the domain warmly welcomed Arirnan like its owner.

[It's been a while. Rise up, my temple.]

Kuku kuku kuku!

The domain resonates with its owner's will. The massive temple, composed of cycles, fills the space in an instant.

Arirnan sat on the throne at the center.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Self. Then, where should I start the story from.]

She slowly bowed her head while sitting on the throne.

[First of all... I'll express my gratitude once again. Thanks to you, I was able to find the reason for my existence as myself. It's not perfect yet, but I think this is enough to be satisfied.]

Arilnan's face showed a genuinely satisfied emotion.

[I can regain what I lost. Akasha. You too, right?] [I...].

Akasha trailed off, and Arilnan nodded as if she knew.

[It's done. You are now his possession. It's unfortunate that you lost a faithful servant, but unless you and he want it, I won't think of making it mine again.]

Arilnan spoke calmly.

[You live your life as yourself, Akasha. What's the point of calling it life, anyway? It's just a tool. But if you're satisfied, then that's all that matters.] [……Thank you.] [I should be the one thanking you. It's no exaggeration to say that I was able to return thanks to you. You're indeed someone worthy of being my servant.] […….]"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A deep emotional response was felt from Akasha, who was silent. Arirnan's gaze turned back to Taesan.

[How should I put it into words? I think it's better to be straightforward. You must have many questions for me. Go ahead and ask. I'll answer.]

"Very well."

Taesan asked the question he had been holding onto since he learned of Arirnan's true identity.

"What is your relationship with Uroboros?"

Uroboros, the snake of cycles. It was also a transcendent being that governed the cycle of all things.

Arirnan's concept overlapped with that of Uroboros. It was an impossible coincidence if you thought about it normally.

[You must have seen something similar. You must have seen two transcendent beings governing the same concept.]

The god of death, Derusha.

The god of struggle and death, Rakirates.

Both governed the concept of death. The difference was that Derusha was related to all deaths, while Rakirates governed deaths that resulted from struggle.

"Is that the concept?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not the same, but it's similar. Uroboros is a device-like existence that governs the cycle of all things. It can't be seen as a single object. It's a part of the vast universe. That's why its power is great and immense.

Literally, it could twist the entire universe's time and dominate the cycle. And even the transcenders couldn't do anything about its intervention. It was because of its enormous concept.

"Uroboros is the cycle of the entire universe, then I can be seen as an independent cycle. It's hard to express in words."

"Isn't it similar to the relationship between Dersha and Lakiratas?"

"Well... I won't say it's wrong, but... saying that hurts my pride."

Arilnan's face was unsatisfied with the mountain's analogy.

"I'm different from Lakiratas. I'm the god of cycles."

Arilnan had the power to intervene in the entire cycle.

His level was higher than Lakiratas or Maria. Even now, he could feel the difference in their levels.

That's why the mountain was puzzled.

"Did you, an existence like you, lose to the usurper?"

"Lose... saying that hurts my pride, but it's true, so I can't say anything."

Arilnan grumbled.

"How..."

How did he lose to the usurper?
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

In response to that question, Arirnan spoke calmly.

"[It's because I clashed with it. I fought it, and after an unimaginable amount of time, it emerged victorious. And it took control of me. That's all there is to it.]"

"Did you, an existence like yourself, lose to the usurper without any external interference?"

Arirnan is strong.

Even in his current imperfect state, he possessed a higher level of power than any god he had seen.

If we were to categorize him as a transcendent being, he would be considered one of the highest, unmatched even by the concept of the universe's beginning and end. It was only natural, given that the concept of circulation referred to the universe's alpha and omega.

And yet, such an existence lost to the usurper.

"[I am strong. I won't deny it. But the usurper had its own secret technique.]"

"A secret technique, you say?"

"[It's something that could temporarily engulf this world.]"

"Wasn't that originally possible?"

The usurper could engulf the concept of the world and store it in a treasure chest. And it was possible to wield it.

"[That's right. But it's a bit different. It can completely devour it.]"

Arirnan's gaze, thin as a thread, turned towards the distant mountains.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You clearly defeated the usurper's faction and emptied their treasure chest. The usurper must have been greatly weakened. However, even when they defeated me, there was nothing remarkable in that treasure chest. The grand concept was only one or two things.

At that time, the usurper was in a state of infinite weakness. Nevertheless, it meant that they had defeated Arirnan.

[It's going to target you. I'd like to tear it apart and kill it myself, but...]

A cold, murderous intent dwelled in Arirnan's eyes.

As someone who had been robbed of everything by the usurper, she must have felt immense hatred towards them.

However, she restrained her emotions.

[It's shameful for the defeated to rise again. I'll leave it to you. Don't let your guard down.]

"I understand."

Taesan silently engraved Arirnan's words in his mind. Taesan also didn't think of leaving the usurper to someone else's hands.

With that attitude, Arirnan smiled satisfactorily.

[Is there anything else you're curious about? I'll answer anything.]

"One thing."

Taesan looked at Arirnan.

"If you're in your current state, you must know about my past."

[I know enough. What you've done is related to me, after all.]

"So I'll ask. Can you, Arirnan, also do the same thing?"

[…Oh ho.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Arilnan's lips curled up.

[You know what I'm asking, don't you? Let's get to the conclusion. It's not impossible.]

"Is that so."

[You must be feeling uneasy. I, on the other hand, govern an independent cycle. But... that doesn't mean it can't be done.]

"Then it's settled."

Taesan nodded his head. Arilnan laughed joyfully.

[You're thinking of something interesting, aren't you? Let's put that off for later enjoyment. It seems like the curious thing has ended... Then, I should do what I need to do.]

Arilnan stood up from her throne. She slowly descended and approached Taesan.

[Do you remember? When you accepted my quest, what I said back then.]

Taesan nodded his head.

Arilnan had declared it back then.

If she could retrieve her own thing, she would give it to Taesan.

And the reward for the 96th floor quest was Arilnan's authority.

[Great achievements require corresponding rewards.]

Arilnan's finger touched Taesan's forehead.

[Receive it. It is 'mine'.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

At the same time, Arilnan's power dwelled within Taesan.

It was enormous.

Taesan struggled to bear it, and it was a burden that was hard to endure.

"This is...".

It was Arilnan's power. It had taken root within Taesan. Just that alone made his foundation shake. His body and soul couldn't withstand the power and were distorted with anxiety.

Taesan set up a boundary. The beast howled and suppressed Arilnan's power.

How much time had passed? Taesan barely managed to tame Arilnan's power.

[You have obtained the Transcendence [Cycle].]

And Taesan realized.

He had gained control over the concept of cycle. Arilnan let out a surprised cry.

[You're really accepting it,]

The cycle was Arilnan's complete and utter power. It was the pinnacle she had achieved by sacrificing everything.

No one else could accept it, and it was even more impossible for someone to make it their own.

But Taesan had assimilated it into himself without any major issues.

[Is that the power you possess? The eyes of the usurper are spinning.]

"Is it okay?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The transcendent being, unlike God, has a limited domain.

It meant that a loss equivalent to the power granted to Taesan had occurred.

It wasn't a small part, either. It was considerable. Although it's hard to judge accurately, it seemed that Arirnan would also suffer a significant blow.

[I said I'd give it to you. I want to give you everything, but... I think it wouldn't be good for you either, so I only gave you that much. If you need more, I'll give you more.]

"No, this is enough."

The concept of circulation resonated within him.

It was grand and enormous.

If mishandled, it could swallow Taesan itself, and it was satisfying enough. The reward was overflowing.

[Well, then...].

Arirnan was about to say something when...

KUUUUUUUUUNG!

Arirnan's domain shook like an earthquake. But it wasn't limited to Arirnan's domain alone.

The entire universe shook.

The concept of the world and all things trembled, and the world was filled with anxiety.

[It's broken.]

Arirnan muttered calmly. Taesan realized what had happened.

The boundary that separates the world and God."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It has broken now.

* * *

[Hmm.]

Blame.

Arilnan opened the space and arrived at the boundary.

There, a deep blackness was invading the universe.

Many transcenders were trying to block it with their powers, but they were slowly being pushed back.

[It's broken.]

"Ah."

The mage who created the labyrinth and found Arilnan let out a sigh.

"……Arilnan-nim."

[Remembered.]

"I just remembered. I had forgotten about you too. This is amazing."

The mage's attitude towards Arilnan was extremely respectful, like they were treating an elder.

[Not just me, but many gods would have remembered as well.]

"Yes. It's really…… many."

[Well, there are many things to talk about, but we don't have the leisure to do so now.]

Kukukukuku…….

The world was being contaminated.

Arilnan, who had been gazing at the scene for a moment, spread their hands.

[Let the flowers bloom.]

And red flowers covered the world.

Note: Arilnan-nim is a polite way to address Arilnan, similar to saying "Mr./Ms./Mrs./Miss Arilnan" in English.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was a red flower of a size that could cover a part of the universe. It absorbed all the power of the corrupted universe and the gods' strength that was polluting it.

[Fall, flower.]

And the flower falls.

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung….

The part of the universe that was being corrupted and the gods' strength were buried and disappeared in the falling flower.

The transcenders' cheers echoed. Taesan was also amazed.

The flower had single-handedly eliminated the corruption that many gods' strength couldn't handle, even with multiple transcenders.

"And yet, I lost to the usurper..."

Arilnan's face was unsatisfied.

[It's just this much. No matter how much I gave, it's still weak. It's been a while since I've done this, so maybe that's why. It's a bit frustrating.]

"What I gave..."

The wizard's gaze turned to Taesan.

[I kept my promise. It's not a big deal. What will you do now?]

Arilnan's gaze turned to Taesan.

[I will protect this world like I did in the past. What will you do?]

"My wish is the same as always."

His first wish.

To save the Earth.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In the end, we had to kill the invading enemies and drive them out. From the start, there was no other choice but to confront the God of Fall and the Usurper. Arilnan smiled satisfactorily at that answer.

[Good. That's enough.]

"That's a grateful word. Are you planning to head down to the labyrinth now?"

"That's how it'll be."

Dealing with the gods was important, but they didn't think about skipping the labyrinth's clearance either.

"Then it would be convenient to give the 97th floor quest here."

The magician waved his hand. At the same time, a system window appeared in front of Taesan.

[97th Floor Quest Start.] [Defeat the Moebius' Lizard.] [Reward:???] [Secret Reward:???]"
