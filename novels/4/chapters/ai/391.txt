Chapter 392

392. The Sixth Return, Earth (9)

And at that moment, people could feel it too.

Something about Mount Tai had changed.

I can't explain it exactly, but something had changed. Mount Tai no longer felt like a life that was the same as theirs.

People who were praying gazed blankly at Mount Tai. Maria smiled quietly.

"[It's over.] [Ah...]."

A ghost-like spirit let out a sigh.

He gazed blankly at Mount Tai with a dull face.

"[That's...]."

Mount Tai looked at my hand. It was easy to realize that everything about him had changed from the fundamental concept.

Snap.

The broken apostle's body regenerates. Four arms move and power is manifested.

Ku Kuru!

The crumbling power envelops Mount Tai. It's an attack from an immortal that cannot be blocked, no matter how much power is used.

Mount Tai gripped the sword in his hand.

He drew his foot back, twisted his waist, and swung his arm. The sword and crumbling power collided.

Kuuuuuuu!
Here is the translation of the text:

The sound of collapse burst forth. The energy of collapse shattered like glass and scattered.

It wasn't because one had used the power of destruction, activated the boundary beyond, manipulated the boundary line, or used partial world transformation.

One had only swung the sword strongly to block the energy of collapse.

"What's this?"

This was an extremely high-level move.

Taisan was standing in the same place as the sage. Taisan revealed this.

"Let's try again."

Taisan took a step forward. The sage's four arms moved roughly.

The battle began again.

The energy of collapse enveloped Taisan. Taisan kicked his legs and launched himself into the air.

Until now, one had been unable to avoid the energy of collapse. It was as if it was inevitable, and it had hit with precision every time.

But it was not the case this time. The energy of collapse did not reach Taisan.

The sage raised his four arms high into the sky.

The energy of collapse poured forth, as if it would destroy the entire world. There was no space to dodge, and it was a wide-range attack.

Taisan gathered mana.

[You have activated a magic spell.]

Concentrating cold, light, and fire, and then releasing them.
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have activated the magic release.] [You have activated the forced amplification.]

The combined energy is spreading in all directions. The power contained within it is not significantly different from what it was before. However, the intensity is different. The destructive power and magic are clashing with each other, opposing each other.

As for yourself now, you can break through with your strength. The mountain is certain about this.

[You have activated the acceleration.] [You have activated the skill acceleration.]

You imbue your feet with power and leap. Your physical body quickly reaches the footsteps of the devil.

The devil also begins to respond. Unlike before, it actively moves its body and tries to escape from the mountain.

Kwa-ddeok.

You swing your sword, breaking apart the destructive power, and dispel the magic and dark magic, creating a path. You chase after the devil, separating and releasing your strength.

As the world collapses, the mountain slowly approaches the devil.

The devil hastily moved its four hands. It forcibly consolidated the destructive power, as if it were a pillar, and brought it down.

This power had no ripple effect or influence. It was as if it had the power to destroy everything it touched, approaching the absolute.

Here is the translation of the text:

However, Tai Shan did not retreat. He and the apostle were at the same level. There was no reason to flee.

[You have activated the sword of courage.]

He grasped the sword with all his might and swung it directly. The pillar and the sword collided, and the space around them shattered.

Ki-i-iing!

The space was collapsing, eroding Tai Shan's physical body.

[Damage to you!@#!@@] [Damage to you!@xxxx] [Damage to you:^$%%$@]

A distortion that cannot be blocked by any absolute defense, caused by the space itself.

However, he did not fall.

Even if he received damage, he would not die. He could have held on.

Tai Shan protected his body with his divine power and grasped the sword with all his might. He poured his strength into his entire body and swung the sword.

Along with the sound, the pillar of collapse shattered.

The distorted space returned to its original form.

"You try to block it too."

He gathered his magic. He opened the path to the devil and unleashed the true power of black magic. The process was faster than anything that had happened before.

[You have activated the solid stone of Gaf.]

The stone fell from the sky onto the apostle.

The apostle could not handle the power of collapse, but the stone was not easily broken.
Here is the translation of the text:

Xiaodao finally brutally whipped his four arms and struck the stone with all his might. The stone broke apart and scattered like a meteor shower.

Then, Taishan inserted his sword into Xiaodao's chest.

[Damage!]

He swung the sword and cut Xiaodao's upper body in half.

Xiaodao tried to respond by whipping his arms, but there was no way to allow it. He was pinned and fell to the ground. Xiaodao's body trembled and collapsed. Taishan kicked him and struck him with his sword.

In an instant, Xiaodao's entire body was torn apart.

And that attack was extremely significant. Xiaodao's entire body was distorted with fear.

Crack.

Taishan inserted his sword into Xiaodao's neck and swung it fiercely. It was a moment of intense strength.

Xiaodao's appearance collapsed.

His figure distorted and became a bizarre shape. At the same time, a dark color began to cover the surrounding area.

Danger. Taishan's instincts warned him. Taishan escaped from the darkness with a limited blink.

Gurgle.

Taishan, having widened the distance, looked at Xiaodao's appearance.

Xiaodao had transformed into a bizarre shape like a human.

The dark energy surrounded Xiaodao's surrounding space.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san could see it. That was the last.

The sage judged that it was impossible to block Tae-san with the power of immortality, so he abandoned everything and returned to his original form.

The blackness condensed. The power contained within it could destroy the entire world if it spread out.

Tae-san drew the sword. The divine energy began to condense onto the sword.

Ki-ki-ki!

It was incredibly bright.

If the divine energy he had been handling up until now had been a firefly, this was like the light of the sun. He had obtained qualifications and rights, and was now able to handle the divine energy more directly.

People covered their eyes and trembled with fear. The ghost watched the scene with a vacant expression.

And the golden light gradually turned into a dull color.

It was a dull gray.

The sage wielded the blackness he had condensed. Tae-san held the gray light and charged forward.

The blackness was the power of the gods.

It was a power that distorted laws and destroyed reality. It was impossible for entities within the law to stop it.

But Tae-san didn't care.

Ka-ka-ka!
The text describes a battle between a character named Sado and a being named Taesan. The two are engaged in a fierce fight, with Taesan's black energy clashing with Sado's gray energy. Despite Sado's efforts to resist, Taesan's attack is too powerful and Sado is struck down.

As Sado's body disintegrates, his internal energy is absorbed by Taesan. This energy is described as being unlike anything Taesan has encountered before, and it seems to have a transformative effect on him. The energy is so powerful that it could potentially destroy millions of people.

However, Taesan's internal energy is eventually absorbed by Sado's gray energy, causing him to become quiet and motionless. The outcome of the battle is unclear, but it appears that Taesan has emerged victorious.
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have won against !#$!.] [Your aura has been activated.] [The skill proficiency of the distorted aura has increased by 5%.] [The proficiency of the black aura has increased by %$#$%.] [The proficiency of the boundary aura has increased by 1#%.] [The proficiency of the divine aura has increased by 3%.] [The proficiency of the ??? aura has increased by 4%.] [The proficiency of the seed of life has increased by 13%.] [The proficiency of the apostle killer has increased by 7%.] [You have obtained the soul skill [Destroyer].] [You have defeated the high-ranking servant and obtained the special permanent activation skill [High-ranking Enemy].] [You have defeated the existence of destruction and saved the world. You have obtained the title [Savior].]

The mountain has sharpened its sword. The faint light has faded, and everything has become clear.

Only then could people see.

The mountain standing alone.

The earth-shaking cry burst out. A deep and profound faith poured into the mountain.

* * *

[One week later, we return to the labyrinth.]

The system window that appeared was only one.

It meant that everything was over.

The mountain was far away from the people, in a place where they couldn't reach. Their cries were quite loud, so I ran away.

He had won. And this victory was a significant gain, a rise in his true nature. There was too much to confirm.

[Immortal] [The one who has transcended mortality. He is in a state where he is free from the bonds of life and death and is alone. He has become closer to the law.]

The skill he obtained through people's faith. Immortality.

[Do you feel something has changed?]

The ghost asked quietly. The mountain replied.

"How many things have changed."

First of all, his concept of himself has changed.
Here is the translation of the text:

Until now, I was barely clinging to the category of being human, but now I feel like I've transcended that realm.

"And... something in my perspective has changed."

"What do you see?"

"I can't put it into words, but I think I've seen something more fundamental. Other than that, nothing has changed significantly."

The ghost spoke in a tone that was both aware and unaware.

"This is the first time I've seen someone become immortal. I'm at a loss for words."

Although the ghost knows many things, it doesn't know the differences that occur when a mortal becomes immortal.

"Time will naturally reveal it. But one thing is certain: I am still myself."

He was like a mountain.

His concept had changed, and his perspective had shifted, but he was still the same. That hadn't changed.

There was no significant change in becoming an immortal. He had only become stronger and more powerful.

The ghost let out a sigh.

"You... are truly amazing."

It was truly amazing to have reached the realm of immortality. It didn't even take a long time. Compared to the time spent by the guides of sin in the labyrinth, it was almost instantaneous.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's only natural that one of us would reach that place."

But Tai Shan had a calm and composed expression.

It was only a matter of time before he would reach that level. Thinking about his purpose, he couldn't be satisfied with just being immortal.

The concept of "highness" refers to the existence beyond mortals, even for transcendental beings.

If you look closely, he had just arrived at the starting point.

The important thing is what he could do after reaching immortality.

There was a lot to be confirmed. Soul skills, divine power, the crystallized divine blood and the essence of the world. The flower ornament given by Maria.

Tai Shan was about to confirm each thing.

"[It seems very busy, doesn't it?]"

Maria quietly appeared beside Tai Shan. She smiled and asked, "How do you feel?"

"I'm not bad. I'm getting close to the good side."

Tai Shan replied calmly, looking at Maria.

"...It's absurd."

After reaching the level of immortality, he could see Maria's power more fundamentally than before.

Her power had no end.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

If the current Tai-san is strong, Maria was like a vast ocean in herself. There was a significant difference between the two.

Even that was not fully understood. Tai-san was still far from being able to grasp Maria, lacking in both power and wisdom.

That was the power of the Transcendent.

It was a force comparable to the Raki-ratas, which possessed two realms.

["You have reached immortality, but you are still just beginning. I have been here for an eternity-like period of time.]

Maria spoke quietly.

["Originally, I could have remained there forever, but it's not related to you. Whatever the case, congratulations. You have reached a solitary position.]

"Thank you."

["Then, as a congratulatory gift, I should give you a gift.]

Maria's power began to spread, enveloping the entire world.

["You have thwarted the heavenly plan. And you have perfectly dealt with the troubles that have bothered us for a long time. That is the repayment.]

And the most profound thing had seeped into Tai-san.
