Chapter 500

500. The Forgotten Goddess (2)

The goddess appears in this world.

Her face was exotic. It was undoubtedly beautiful, but it felt out of place compared to the common facial features.

Thinking back, the goddess had disappeared during the war with the gods. It was a very long time ago, so it wasn't strange that the human skeletal structure had changed a bit.

"The other gods didn't have any sense of discomfort. Is it because they're all adjusted?"

It wasn't strange, considering that external appearances could be changed at will.

With that thought, I looked at the goddess.

Her skin was as white as an albino's, and her hair and eye color were a dull, dusty gray.

It was strange, but not unpleasant. It felt like looking at a masterpiece of art.

The goddess stepped onto the floor of the labyrinth. Akasha let out a sigh.

[Ari...l-nim.]

"Akasha."

The goddess's gaze turned to Akasha. The emotions in her eyes were affection and longing.

"You've become a ring. What happened?"

[Many things... happened.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I wonder what happened. Anyway, it seems like my self is still intact. I thought I'd lost myself and was wandering alone, but fortunately..."

[Is that really... you, Arirnanim?]

"It's me."

Arirnan declared confidently.

"I am your one and only master, and you are my servant. I am Arirnan."

[Is that so...]

Akasha's words trailed off. Seeing her expression, Arirnan's eyebrows furrowed slightly, as if she had noticed something.

"Something's off. This isn't the reaction I expected. Did you not fully recover your memories?"

[I apologize. I remember that you were my goddess, but aside from that, my memories are still fragmented.]

Arirnan's face looked genuinely disappointed as she muttered.

"I did so much to save you, but the person themselves doesn't remember."

[I apologize.]

"Whatever. It's fine."

The goddess raised her hand, and the white palm entered her line of sight.

"I didn't expect to come back like this either. It's a small thing that my beloved servant doesn't remember me."

The goddess's gaze, which had been examining herself, turned towards Taesan.

"I suppose it's all thanks to you."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The goddess gazed at Taesan.

Inside, she felt nothing.

To transcend, one would need to possess a certain energy, a high level of skill, and immense power. But none of that existed. It was completely empty, just as the words implied.

However, there was one thing she could sense.

Nobility.

Even if she couldn't feel anything, it was clear to anyone who saw her that she was a goddess.

"......You."

In that instant, Arirang's gaze towards Taesan distorted, filled with hostility and wariness.

[Arirang-nim?]

Akasha reacted reflexively, exerting her power to protect her master.

Arirang, who had seen this, looked back and forth between Akasha and Taesan, as if she had come to a realization, and nodded her head.

"I see. I'm not your master anymore."

[I apologize... ]

"It's fine. I'm nothing now."

Akasha looked at Taesan again and muttered softly.

"I don't need to worry about it."

[Yes?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This is my story. If anyone else were my master, I wouldn't be able to acknowledge it. But since you're the one who summoned me to this world, I suppose I have no choice. It's a bit uncomfortable, but I won't dwell on it too much."

Arilnan stood up straight, her dignified demeanor unwavering even in her movements.

"First, let me express my gratitude. What is your name?"

"I'm Gang Taesan. You can call me Taesan."

"Ah, Taesan. Thanks to you, I've been able to return to this world."

"It's not me, but Akasha. She's the one who remembered you, Arilnan."

"No, Akasha's current master is you. Ultimately, it's all thanks to you. Please accept my gratitude humbly."

Arilnan spoke lightly.

"Very well, then."

Taesan nodded and opened his mouth.

"When you gave me the quest, were you conscious?"

"No, I wasn't fully conscious at the time. I was just a wandering, unconscious soul... but your prayer definitely reached me. Thanks to that, I was able to make contact with you."

Arilnan looked around, taking in the walls and structure of the labyrinth. Her face was filled with wonder as she muttered to herself.

"What is this place, anyway? It's giving me a very strange feeling."
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$The magician's place, it is.

A magician?

Yes, the one who designed this place. You might know them as Ariel now.

Hmm.

Ariel approached the maze's wall and examined the bricks with interest.

Tae-san spoke up,

"Ariel-"

"Formality isn't necessary."

Ariel moved the maze's wall aside and said,

"I am not a goddess now. You seem to have reached a transcendent level, so if we're comparing, you are above me. In fact, I should be the one showing respect."

"No, I don't think that way."

Tae-san immediately declined. Ariel chuckled.

"Thank goodness. I was contemplating whether I should really show respect."

'They are more playful than I thought.'

Akasha's tone and mannerisms showed cruelty and indifference. So, Ariel thought they would be similar, but they weren't. Ariel had a playful personality instead.

"You seem to have many questions for me. Ask away. I will answer whatever I can."

"If you insist."

Tae-san quickly organized his thoughts and opened his mouth.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What did the goddess originally govern?"

Essential said, "If Akasha, who was left in a state of being devoured by the usurper, was a being that originally governed concepts, then..."

Arilnan replied, "I do."

"Some parts of language are erased from the world."

"It's as if the concept doesn't exist in this world, and it can't be spoken. I tried to read the shape of the mouth, but even that was impossible."

Arilnan murmured without any agitation, "I only got the name. The usurped concept cannot return."

"......That's unfortunate."

"It's as expected. I didn't think I could regain my original power. For now, this is enough."

"Who made the goddess like that?"

"The usurper."

A name that didn't deviate from Taesan's expectation came out of Arilnan's mouth.

"I lost everything in the war against Goshin, and my followers, the apostles, were all erased from the universe, leaving only Akasha behind."

"That's right, isn't it?"

"What's going on? Did you know?"

"I wasn't sure, but I had a hunch."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan asked again.

"Then, do you remember something about that?"

"You're asking strange questions. I'm not weak enough to forget the one who devoured me."

Taesan's eyes sparkled.

The usurper.

He had fought directly with that being and had memories of it. He could know more about the usurper than Essential.

"It seems you're curious about the usurper. I'll answer your question."

"Thank you."

The usurper.

The one who usurps the world.

Taesan had a hunch that it was related to himself.

"What should I say? Excluding the superficial, that guy can take control of this world, including concepts and everything in the universe. It may be just an imitation, but other gods can't do it."

Up to that point, it was information that Taesan had learned from Essential. Arirnan continued.

"Other gods may know up to this point. But from here on, it's information that only I know."

Arirnan smiled.

"That's the one who admires this world."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

“……Do you admire him?”

“I didn’t know that fact at first either. But when I was consumed by the usurper, a part of his emotions entered me. As a result, I came to know. The usurper admires and longs for this universe.”

Admiration.

It was a word that didn’t match well with the noble god.

“There must be a reason why he wants to usurp the world. But it’s an impossible task. After all, he’s a noble god. He’s a being that’s fundamentally twisted. No matter how hard he tries, it’s just a pale imitation.”

Arilnan laughed scornfully. Her laughter showed deep contempt towards the usurper.

“And besides, I was going to say this after your questions were all over, but I just can’t hold it in.”

Arilnan looked at Taesan with a smiling face.

“I don’t know why, but I can smell the usurper’s scent on you.”

* * *

“……Are you talking about me?”

“I’ve lost my power now. But I once became one with the usurper. That’s why I know a lot about him and can sense many things.”

Her narrow, slanted eyes gazed at Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I can smell that guy's scent on you. It's a faint smell that you wouldn't notice if you're not focused, but... it's definitely there."

"......Is that so."

"Do you have any idea what it might be?"

"It's not nothing."

Taesan's thoughts flashed through his mind.

"It's not a huge deal. It's just a scent, after all. But originally, it shouldn't even exist."

Arirnan smiled faintly.

"That's why I suspected you at first."

The initial hostility and killing intent towards Taesan were because of that.

"I thought the thief had hidden their identity and snuck up on me. But that's not it. It's twisted, but... at least it's not on that side. I can't be certain, but it doesn't seem like something I should get involved in."

Arirnan stretched her back.

"It's your own problem, so figure it out yourself."

"Thank you."

"What's with the thanks? I'm the one who should be thankful."

She chuckled.

"You saved me. That fact won't change. So, I should repay you for that."

The goddess's finger pointed towards Taesan's head. A gentle warmth touched and then left.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I think this is possible. Take it."

[The blessings of the gods [Blessing of the Rebirth of the Forgotten Goddess], [Blessing of the Soul of the Forgotten Goddess], [Blessing of the Will of the Forgotten Goddess] have evolved into the blessing of the gods [Arilnan's Blessing].]

All the blessings that Tae-san has received from her so far are integrated into one. And its power and strength become even greater.

"I want to grant you my true authority, but it's still lacking."

"Is it impossible to recover? If it's people's faith......"

If it's the current Tae-san, she could create a faith for Arilnan. But Arilnan shook her head.

"You can't handle me with such a small concept. Even if I've been distorted and lost, my foundation is one concept."

"That's right."

"But that doesn't mean there's no way. I said I became one with it. As a result, I learned a secret."

Arilnan smiles quietly.

"A usurper usurps the universe, but cannot make it their own. Then, where do the things they usurped go?"

Tae-san's eyes trembled.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not yet."

Airlan murmured quietly.

"I still need time. I'm too weak right now, and my memories aren't complete like Akasha's. So, for now, I'll have to ask for your favor."

[Special Quest Begins.] [Goddess. Airlan wants to retrieve what she has lost. To do so, she needs to stabilize her strength and power.] [Condition: Airlan must recall what she has forgotten.] [Reward: Airlan's enhanced blessing and a connected quest.]

Taesan nodded his head.

The story has been settled for now. At the same time, Balbambara appeared.

[I've kept you waiting. It took some effort, but we've finally settled things. Now, let's get to the main point...].

Balbambara stopped.

Airlan was in his gaze. Airlan greeted Balbambara with a curious face.

"Is that a tool made by a wizard? This is amazing."

[...What's going on now?]

Balbambara's voice, mixed with surprise and dismay, rang out.
