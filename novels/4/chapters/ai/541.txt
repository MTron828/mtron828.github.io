**Chapter 542**

542. The Pantheon of Gods (8)

"It's not like I've taken it all. It's just a very small part, not even a fragment. And that will disappear soon anyway."

[But it's clear that I've been robbed. My domain has decreased, even if only slightly.]

It wasn't uncommon for the domain of a transcendent being to decrease permanently.

By giving trials to mortals and rewarding them, the domain would suffer losses.

However, that was a choice made by the transcendent being themselves.

But now, Taesan has taken a part of the domain without the transcendent being's consent.

"I don't understand it myself."

The last domain invasion. What process did Taesan go through to take over Lakiratas's domain and make it his own?

Thanks to that, Taesan was able to block Lakiratas's attack.

However, Taesan himself didn't know how he did it. It was different from his boundaries or physical strength. The two were still immature and hadn't reached the bottom, but they could control and manipulate it.

However, it wasn't a domain invasion.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It wasn't that he understood and acted, but rather his body moved naturally. There was something instinctive within him.

[You don't even know how to handle yourself.]

"At least for now, that's the case."

If similar conditions were given again, I might not know, but for now, I couldn't freely control the domain invasion.

[What a shame. I wanted to try again.]

Rakiratas had a truly pitiful face.

Trying again meant that Rakiratas' domain would be invaded, but he didn't seem to care about that.

[No, that power took over my domain. It's not invasion, but rather occupation. It's a completely different concept from contamination or tainting. Moreover, the process was so natural that even transcendents couldn't notice.]

Rakiratas himself, who was being invaded, didn't even realize that his authority was being taken away by someone else.

The boundary was clearly strong, and it was a power that they couldn't understand.

Still, they could accept and recognize that it was unusual and dangerous.

But it wasn't domain invasion.

That wasn't unusual. It was extremely natural, as if it had always existed as a concept in their world, and had blended in seamlessly among them."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is that a collection built solely by your pure self, unlike physical strength or boundaries? That's interesting. I'm curious."

Rakiratas leaned back in his chair.

"I did well. The insignificant adventurer I met for the first time has disappeared without a trace. I've become strong enough to rival you."

"There's still a long way to go," Taesan said, denying the praise. It was clear now that the battle was over.

Rakiratas looked at him.

Of course, it didn't mean he had taken Taesan lightly. Throughout the battle, Rakiratas had genuinely tried to kill Taesan.

But it wasn't with full power.

If he had used his full power, he would have killed Taesan before he could even do anything. If he had synchronized his spirit, body, and ki to make the universe itself his own and charged at Taesan, Taesan would have had no way to counterattack.

Even if that wasn't the case, Rakiratas didn't need to engage in a head-on battle. Taesan still couldn't fully control his powers, so Rakiratas could have easily won by targeting his weaknesses. If he had just aimed for those weaknesses, he could have easily defeated Taesan.

However, Rakiratas had deliberately faced Taesan's immature attacks head-on.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was only when Taesan's power reached a level that could rival mine that I decided to take him on.

In reality, it was as if I had tailored my strength to match Taesan's.

[Even so, I was sincere. The fact that I fought him alone is proof of his strength. Who knows what will happen when you become even more accustomed to your own abilities.]

Rakiratas had a genuinely joyful expression.

[I wonder what you'll be able to achieve. What will be at the end of your struggles? How will death come to you? Watching that is also a kind of entertainment.

"Thank you."

[The gratitude is appreciated. I also had a joyful entertainment. Then, I should give you a reward for that entertainment.]

The battle between Rakiratas and Taesan was Rakiratas' trial.

And Taesan successfully cleared that trial.

Then, Rakiratas had to give him a suitable reward.

[I wondered what to give you... but this seems fitting for you.]

Rakiratas waved his hand, and a part of his domain was torn off.

[Rakiratas' interference domain has decreased.] [You have obtained a death that arose from your struggles.]"

Note: The text appears to be a fantasy or RPG-style dialogue, with characters named Rakiratas and Taesan engaging in a battle or trial. The language is formal and somewhat poetic, with a focus on the themes of power, strength, and reward.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a death that occurred as a result of a single struggle to kill all living things.

Rakiratas had given away a part of his authority.

'...Is that okay?'

Taesan had received authority before. Being chosen by Maria or being forcefully fallen by the God of Decline were among them.

But that was only one way to utilize authority.

Now, Rakiratas was giving away the authority itself. The reward was on a different level.

I had expected a reward of around one sacred artifact, but I didn't know he would give away a part of his authority.

[You have passed my trial. You did very well. I must give you a fitting reward.]

Rakiratas laughed as if it was no big deal.

[We will call upon you. We need you for the upcoming war.]

'I know that.'

[But that doesn't mean you have to be on our side. We can cooperate temporarily, but you don't have to be our ally.]

It was unbelievable to hear a transcendent being who ruled the universe say that they didn't need to be on their side."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan gazed at Lakiratas. Lakiratas spoke calmly.

["You go your own way. Don't get tangled up with us. You're a wanderer. You have your own path, different from ours and theirs. That's my simple advice to you."]

"I understand."

Taesan nodded his head.

Lakiratas smiled contentedly.

[Then it's farewell. We'll meet again soon.]

* * *

Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

"Phew."

Taesan sat down first.

The wizard didn't appear. He had said he would take care of some things before returning to the labyrinth, so it wasn't surprising.

Until then, there was nothing Taesan had to do.

Meanwhile, Taesan suddenly thought of the community.

He hadn't properly checked the community since his return. Taesan opened the community for the first time in a while.

"......huh?"

And Taesan was taken aback for a moment.

Taesan had thought that the community would be filled with stories about the labyrinth. Now that he had returned, it was only natural that people would be talking about the labyrinth.

But that wasn't the case.

The community was overflowing with stories about Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Yoo Young-seok[Easy] : Uh... what's going on? What do we do? Something's happened.]

[Gang Dong-joon[Normal] : When will Taesan-nim appear? I have no idea what to do about this.]

[Oliver Khan[Hard] : Calm down for now. We're all in a state of panic. Let's figure out what to do.]

There was a sense of panic and confusion. But it wasn't fear or terror, nor was it confusion about the unknown. It was just pure panic.

[Oliver Khan[Hard] : Do you know something, Amelia? You and Gang Jun-hyeok are his disciples, right?]

[Amelia Eirin[Alone] : That's true, but... if Taesan doesn't say anything, I can't say anything either. Let's just wait for now.]

"...What's going on?"

Taesan scowled.

* * *

Taesan, who had been gazing at the community for a moment, posted a message.

[Gang Taesan[Alone] : What's going on.]

As soon as Taesan's message went up, the responses poured in. Thousands, tens of thousands of messages flooded the screen.

Conversation became impossible.

Taesan moved to the chat window where the core members of each country were gathered, as he always did.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Gang Tae-san[Alone]: What's going on?] [Amelia Airin[Alone]: Tae-san!] [Daniel Darmon[Hard]: I've been searching for it.] [Gang Tae-san[Alone]: What's going on?] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: A system window has appeared.] [Gang Tae-san[Alone]: System?] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Just wait a moment.]

Lee Tae-yeon opened a system window a little later.

[The one you serve has reached the pinnacle of solitude. Your faith will become more directly connected to him.] [Additionally, he can grant his followers his authority, allowing them to wield some of his power.] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: There's more, but the important part is this.] [Gang Tae-san[Alone]: I understand why this is happening.]

Tae-san stepped down from his position as a god and reached the pinnacle of solitude.

And this fact could not help but affect those who served Tae-san.

Every player on Earth worshipped Tae-san. It was only natural to call them his followers.

And until now, Tae-san's followers had often used some of the god's authority.

Now, Tae-san could also grant them that power.

"I can't call myself a god, but is this also possible?"

Tae-san thought for a moment and then wrote something.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Will you come down?] [Oliver Kan [Hard]: What?] [Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: No, I'd be grateful if you did, but... is this for real?]

People were half-believing, half-doubting. But Tae-san didn't care much.

"[Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Wait and see.] [Geum Jung-geun [Hard]: ...Is this for real?] [Daniel Darmon [Hard]: Just a moment, I'm not mentally prepared yet.] [Gang Tae-san [Alone]: I'm the one giving it, what's there to prepare for?]

Tae-san focused his mind.

The power gathered. Strong and solid.

And that gathered power spread out into the world according to the master's will.

It transcended space and time, scattering its power to the gods who served him, beyond the labyrinthine place.

"[Lee San [Easy]: ...What?]

The community suddenly became noisy. Tae-san, who had confirmed their reactions, realized that things had gone as he had wished.

"[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: What, Tae-san. This is.] [Gang Tae-san [Alone]: You got it too.] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Which side is it? I'm also one of those who serve, but this...][Amelia Erlin [Alone]: Physical control? What is this?] [Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Is that what it's called.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$The blessings of power that the gods had given to Taesan,

He has now bestowed the power to all players on Earth.

*[Strong Taesan(Solo) : Try it once. I'm curious too.*]

Taesan has indeed passed it on, but even he does not know how it will become a strength for ordinary players. There was a brief stir in the community.

And in the meantime, Taesan checked his own power.

What he has just passed down is the power of physics.

And the power of the transcendent is consumed permanently when the transcendent bestows it upon the chosen one or imposes a trial.

So, how much of Taesan's power has been consumed?

He has passed it down to all players on Earth. The number is in the hundreds of millions. It is clear that it will be consumed to a great extent.

Having prepared himself for this, Taesan calmly checked.

“……hmm?”

And he was surprised.

It was not that the consumption value was high.

It was that it was consumed too little.

It felt like he had spilled a pot's worth of water in the ocean. It is not a small amount for an ordinary human to see, but when viewed from the perspective of the entire ocean, it is an insignificant level.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even if I give you a fortune, if you're an individual, you wouldn't even be worth a single drop of water.

"What's with this stinginess?"

Taesan let out a cold laugh. The transcenders he had met so far were extremely reluctant to spend their own resources. So, unless it was someone he truly acknowledged, he wouldn't give them anything.

So, he had expected some level of loss, but it was a level that didn't even amount to dust.

"There was no need to worry."

He had thought about the extent of the loss, but it was a level that didn't exist. It wasn't bad.

Taesan waited quietly.

And before long, the posts started coming up one by one.

[Lee Tae-yeon[Alone] : Um... Taesan.] [Kang Taesan[Alone] : Why.]

After a brief silence, Lee Tae-yeon posted a message.

[Lee Tae-yeon[Alone] : What's this?]
