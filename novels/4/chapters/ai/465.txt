Chapter 466

466. The 88th Floor, Those Who Want to Become Gods (5)

The golden realm spreads violently. It pushes away the realms of Paragup and Keboruak and creates its own sacred territory.

[Don't make me laugh!]

Keboruak resists violently. His realm rises to push away the divine. Paragup also rises to resist.

[You who have escaped your own world! You want to assert your own realm in my world? I won't tolerate it!]

"What's it to you?"

Taesan responds lightly to the overflowing anger.

In an instant, the golden world covers the entire world.

[This, this...].

The realms of Keboruak and Paragup did not disappear. However, they were suppressed by the sacred territory, and their size and realm were significantly reduced.

"A realm at the level of an immortal can be suppressed to some extent with just a sacred territory."

As it was a sacred territory that unfolded in a place that was not the earth, it was questionable how much power it could exert, but it seemed that there would be no problem against an immortal.

"It's perfect."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Transcender and the Immortal. What level of gap is there between the two?

Taesan didn't know specifically. He thought he would take this opportunity to properly understand.

"You."

Paragup's face hardened as he gathered his strength.

Kuuuuuuung!

The earth rose like a tsunami, trying to swallow Taesan. Paragup also flew his body and swung a massive fist towards Taesan. Taesan also clenched his fist.

Kwaaaaaaang!

The collision sound spread. The one who was pushed back was Paragup. Taesan shook his hand.

Keboruak, enraged, swung his domain. The wind and sky moved. He tried to tear Taesan's entire body apart from all directions.

Kugugugugung!

Taesan moved his fist and kicked, crushing Keboruak's power.

The fierce battle continued. Paragup's face hardened.

Taesan wasn't using any power right now.

He was only using his physical strength and his own abilities to respond to their attacks.

It was like fighting bare-handed on the battlefield without any equipment.

But even so, their attacks couldn't harm Taesan.

"This can't be.""
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Paragoupe spews out words of denial. The earth trembles like a wave. And then, a massive shockwave covers the Taesan.

Kuuuuuuung!

Taesan has firmly defended his entire body. The strange power that wrapped around his body wavered.

Taesan muttered, calculating the consumption value.

"This is not enough to deal with the Immortal."

Transcendence. Self-Immunity.

A skill that excludes and denies all interference based on laws. However, every time he blocked an attack, his Self-Immunity was consumed a little.

The attacks of Diana and Beldegencia, who had not reached the level of Immortal, could not actually consume his Self-Immunity.

But at the level of Immortal, it seemed that something was different, and his Self-Immunity was being consumed every time he blocked an attack.

"I can block it at least ten times with this level of power."

The verification of Self-Immunity was over.

Next was his own strength and power.

[You have activated the Great Destruction.]

A sphere that announces the destruction of all things appears. The Paragoupe roughly stretches out his hand and grabs the Great Destruction.

Kuuuuuuung!

With a loud noise, the Paragoupe lets out a small groan.

But the armor that covered him was not pierced. The destroyed parts were restored in an instant."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Paragup is an immortal of the highest order.

He possessed a defensive power that focused on defense.

If he were Taesan before becoming a transcendent, he wouldn't have been able to pierce his power without using black magic.

But what about now?

Can he pierce the immortal's power with pure magic and dark magic alone, without using black or divine magic?

[You activated magic overlap.]

You created three massive explosions simultaneously and overlapped them into one. The aftermath alone was enough to distort everything and cause destruction. Keboruak hastily blew away the wind, but the overlapped massive explosion didn't budge.

[You activated magic release.]

The massive explosion headed towards Paragup.

Paragup hesitated for a moment. His instincts warned him.

You can't block that.

You have to dodge.

"...What a ridiculous idea!"

But Paragup denied his instincts.

In the hundreds of years of battle against Keboruak, his power had never been pierced once. To him, his power was the strongest defense in the universe, one that no one could pierce.

Not even a transcendent could pierce it with a single blow."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Paragup believed in his own power.

And he had to pay the price for his faith.

Ku ku ku ku ku!

Paragup's armor and the great destruction collided. At the same time, his armor crumbled like a sandcastle. Paragup's pupils enlarged.

He hastily gathered his strength.

He concentrated the power of the realm and wrapped it around his entire body. He made his armor even stronger and increased its repair speed.

But even so, he couldn't keep up with the destruction speed.

The great destruction pierced through his armor.

Kwaaaang!

"Kuhhuhh!"

Paragup spat out blood and flew away.

The power that had never been broken since he became immortal was now shattered.

[You!]

Keboruak, filled with rage, gathered the energy of the sky. He wrapped the power of the realm around his entire body and amplified the wind.

And then, he charged straight towards the great mountain.

Keboruak was the ruler of the sky. If Paragup could create the strongest armor by controlling the earth, then he could increase his speed to the limit by controlling the wind.

Piiiiing!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He was getting closer to Taesan in an instant. An extreme speed that surpassed his usual speed by tens of times. Although he couldn't penetrate Paragup's defense, Paragup couldn't even see him.

Keboruak believed that Taesan would not be different from Paragup. It was the moment when he was about to fly in and attack.

Keboruak realized.

Taesan's eyes were precisely following him.

Oh no.

Chills ran down his spine, but it was already too late.

[You activated Baal's Dark Space Slash.]

The space, dyed in darkness, burst out.

The dark magic covered Keboruak entirely. Keboruak tried to protect himself with wind, but the darkness dyed the wind black. The wind, which was meant to protect him, twisted and attacked him in an instant.

[Aaagh!]

Keboruak screamed and was blown away. Taesan smiled.

"It's working."

It was certain.

Without holy power or divine authority, he could pierce the authority of the immortals with just magic and dark magic alone.

In fact, this meant that he could defeat them with just this.

The two immortals stumbled and got up. Although they suffered damage from Taesan's attack, their will was not broken. They attacked Taesan again with anger and resentment.

Taesan welcomed them with pleasure.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They couldn't fall easily. They had to withstand him as long as possible and become his experiment subjects.

He grasped his sword tightly.

Kwaaaang!

This time, he didn't use anything. He only responded with his swordsmanship.

The sword, which had reached the extreme of the storm's fury, ripped through the armor with a loud tearing sound.

Kwaaaang!

"Ugh!"

Paraigu was slammed back into the ground. Although he controlled the earth itself, he couldn't absorb all the damage.

Keboruak was no different. He desperately resisted and tried to counterattack, but he was blocked by the divine power and couldn't reach him.

They were at their wit's end.

Taesan was not responding seriously. He was using various powers in turns, as if conducting experiments on them.

It was extremely humiliating. They wanted to find Taesan's weakness and crush his arrogant pride.

But even that was impossible.

The power that was lightly wielded was enough to threaten them, and their full strength couldn't pose a significant threat to Taesan.

There was an overwhelming difference in power.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They couldn't accept that fact.

[Unbelievable!]

Keboruak shouted with a tone of denial.

The two immortals shared a common thought.

The thought that they were the strongest.

And the thought that no one could surpass them.

They had been rivals for hundreds of years, trying to become gods, but they still believed they were stronger.

However, the mountain in front of them was, no matter how they looked at it, stronger than them.

They couldn't accept that fact.

[How did I end up in this situation!]

Keboruak gritted his teeth.

He had killed his family with his own hands. He had annihilated his own kind. He had burned his entire body. He had overcome thousands of near-death experiences.

That's the power I've obtained! No one can touch me! I am the strongest!

With that emotional outburst from Keboruak, Taesan lazily stretched out his hand into the air.

"What's the point of that?"

[You've activated the World's Sword.]

The sword was grasped in Taesan's hand.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan swung his sword with all his might. Paragup and Keboruak combined their strength to block it, but he shattered their defense with ease. The two of them spat out blood and fell to the ground.

"With this, I can pierce the power of the Immortal."

Taesan nodded in satisfaction and unleashed his power once again.

[You have activated the Frozen World [Divine] skill.]

Whoa!

A wave of golden ice crashed down, filled with the thick, dense power of divinity. Keboruak burst out laughing, and Paragup covered his entire body with armor.

Kwaaaah!

And everything was destroyed.

The attack, imbued with the power of divinity, shattered all their efforts and strength. The cold energy froze the earth's armor and left deep scars on their bodies. Keboruak's wings froze and fell to the ground.

[Ugh!]

"With divine magic, I can crush them completely. It's satisfying."

Overwhelming.

It was neither more nor less than that.

Keboruak struggled to get up.

[I... I sacrificed everything...].

"You, who have killed countless mortals, must have worked hard in your own lives. And you killed them all and controlled their minds."

They trampled on people's efforts and lives, only to fulfill their own desires.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You guys should have been prepared to have your efforts trampled by someone stronger than you."

Taesan said indifferently.

Everything had been confirmed. At this point, even if multiple immortals came at him, he could win easily.

It was almost time to end this.

Taesan thought he would confirm one more thing.

Blackness began to flow out. The sacred land that enveloped the world was being dyed in darkness, gradually turning to ash. Paragup, who was about to get up, froze.

"......This, this is..."

This was their territory.

After hundreds of years of trying to kill each other with all their might, Paragup had taken the earth as his territory, and Keboruak had made the sky his own.

But their territory was starting to distort.

It wasn't just a matter of simple strength or concept of respect. It was as if their territory itself had never existed from the beginning, being consumed by the ash and disappearing from this world.

"What's going on?"

Paragup trembled with fear.

What he had built, his achievements, were disappearing. It was as if they had no value at all.

Paragup was afraid. It was the first time he had felt fear in his life.
