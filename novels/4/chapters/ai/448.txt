Chapter 449

449. The Seventh Return, Earth (1)

As Taesan showed interest in the wrist guard, the shop owner said,

"Good equipment. Are you interested?"

"I don't have the money."

The wrist guard cost 2 million gold, but Taesan only had 1.5 million gold. Even if he sold all his spare equipment, he couldn't afford to buy it.

"What a shame."

The equipment that could reduce damage by half without any conditions was priceless.

When used with the "Strong" skill, it would only take 25% of the damage.

Its value was comparable to the best equipment that Lee Tae-yeon wore.

However, Taesan lacked the gold. With the return to Earth imminent, he needed to buy one more piece of equipment, but he couldn't save up more.

"Even if I sell it, it's uncertain."

The problem was the wrist guard. Taesan already had the world-changing wrist guard.

The wrist guard that interfered with the world's laws was not inferior to the dark wrist guard in terms of value.

"But what was regrettable was regrettable. Taesan shook off his thoughts and examined the other equipment.

After looking around overall, the equipment to be used was decided.

'Accessory.'

Among them, a ring.

By combining the twin rings into one, he could wear an additional ring. The empty slot needed to be filled.

Taesan focused on the rings.

And he chose one.

[Ring of Multiple Blessings] [Strength + 10%] [Agility + 10%] [Intelligence + 10%] [Attack Power + 500] [A ring bestowed by the ruler of multiple realms to their beloved. It accumulates damage received and can be released at will. It resets after the battle.] [1,500,000G]

The basic stats were already superior, and it had a special effect. It could accumulate damage received and wield it as a single power.

It would be certain after trying it out in actual combat, but Taesan's current HP was over 300,000. If he accumulated that much damage and released it, he could show a power rivaling a fatal blow.

"I'll go with this.""
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What's that? Like it."

Taesan paid for the gold and bought a ring. The shop owner, who was organizing his goods, shook a dark-colored wrist guard.

"This looks interesting."

"I don't have gold, and the equipment slot is uncertain, so it's okay."

"Well, we'll talk about it later. Depending on what you do for me, I might just give it to you."

The shop owner chuckled.

Taesan left him behind and opened the community.

There wasn't much time left until the return. Many conversations were going on in the community.

The unity of all humanity.

People were excited about that fact.

Taesan also participated in it.

The leaders of each group, along with Alone mode players, were discussing their experiences on Earth, when Oliver Kan posted a message with a hint of irony.

[Oliver Kan[Hard] : Saying this might sound old-fashioned, but humanity has become one.] [Daniel Darmong[Hard] : ……That's right.]

Among the surviving countries, there were also those that had been hostile to each other.

However, under the common enemy, Goshin, they all became one.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Oliver Kan[Hard]: If we defeat all the invaders, can we find peace?] [Amelia Eirin[Alone]: Don't be ridiculous. Do you know how many people we've killed and died to get here? That's not going to happen.] [Oliver Kan[Hard]: Can't we have some hope? I'm tired of thinking that even after everything is over, we'll still have to fight.]

They continued their conversation.

They organized their emotions and discussed their strategy.

The time was not short. It was very long.

And now, there wasn't much time left until their return to Earth.

[Oliver Kan[Hard]: Then, let's get ready. Let's all survive and see.] [Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard]: See you later, Taesan.] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Let's meet on Earth. I'll tell you a surprising story.] [Amelia Eirin[Alone]: I'm looking forward to it, Gang Taesan. I'll show you my changed powers!]

Taesan smiled faintly.

[Gang Taesan[Alone]: I'm not looking forward to it.]

He replied briefly.

At the same time, the world distorted.

The labyrinth disappeared, and his world, Earth, appeared.

Taesan did not resist the force pulling him.

And he arrived on Earth.

[Special Quest Start] [You have two days. Establish order and prepare for the upcoming movements and battles.] [The more influence you have, the more points you'll receive when you return to the labyrinth.]

"Two days, huh."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan turned his gaze.

What he saw was a ruined heaven and earth, and numerous people.

The people were not confused. They steeled themselves and moved quickly.

Some people, who had discussed beforehand, quickly gathered around.

After about seven times, the people became experts.

And they discovered Taesan.

"Wow!"

"Lord Taesan!"

They shouted towards Taesan, trying to offer prayers, but they hesitated.

"What's with this many?"

"Is this your world... I can feel a terrible energy coming from all directions."

Beldechia stuck out her tongue, and Diana looked up at the sky with a gloomy face.

The people were shocked by the sudden appearance of the two, who looked out of place.

* * *

Kim Hwi-yeon quickly gathered the people and collected information.

And he gathered the people in charge in one place.

But they couldn't bring themselves to talk.

They glanced around, looking at Taesan's side.

There, Beldechia and Diana were present.

"It's different."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Beldegkia, who was observing them, murmured. Kim Hwi-yeon asked cautiously.

"Uh, Mr. Taesan. The people next to him are...".

It was clear that they were not ordinary people at a glance.

Beldegkia had a Western appearance, but she was a person from a completely different world. She didn't feel like the same human being.

Diana was even more so. With her long golden hair, she was extremely beautiful and had an aura about her.

She really looked like a princess.

What was more, her presence was palpable.

The two of them were trying to suppress their powers as much as possible, but it was clear that they were not ordinary beings.

Taesan replied.

"Helpers."

"Helpers... what?"

"There are beings called NPCs in the Alone Mode. We made a contract with them. They promised to help us when we return to Earth."

"Hmm. So they're aliens?"

"That's how it is from our perspective."

A sudden thrill ran through them.

NPCs only exist in the Alone Mode. They had heard about it through Gang Taesan or Lee Taeyeon's stories, but this was the first time they saw it for themselves."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I knew we weren't the only ones in the universe, but it's strange to meet like this."

"There's no need to be surprised. We're here to help you, after all."

Diana spoke softly, and her gentle smile captivated everyone's attention.

Lee Tae-yeon gazed at the two of them with a puzzled expression.

Kim Hwi-yeon quickly regained his composure and greeted them calmly.

"Please take care of us from now on."

"Let's overcome this together."

Diana said, and Kim Hwi-yeon nodded.

"Then let's get started. Fortunately, not many people have died on their way down from the labyrinth."

In their past lives, after a certain point, many people got severely injured or died, but since there were many of them, they could solve the problem. The difficulty of the labyrinth increased gradually, but they could overcome it.

"What floor are you on now?"

"The hard mode players have reached the 77th floor."

"I'm on the 58th floor."

"I'm on the 72nd floor."

Kang Joon-hyuk and Lee Tae-yeon replied, and everyone's attention turned to Lee Tae-yeon.

"Really... you're fast."

"There are people faster than me, so what's the big deal? Taesan, what floor are you on?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"87th floor."

Taesan replied.

A quiet sense of awe spread.

"...... It's really not far away."

"I've said it before, but you don't know. From the 90th floor, it's going to change again."

The rough confirmation was over.

The rest was about command, so Taesan didn't get involved. He took Belldandy and Diana and headed towards the outer area.

"You heard it roughly, but it's really different."

Belldandy clicked her tongue.

"We arrived at the 77th floor? That's a level where even the tip of our toes can't reach. It's like a labyrinth that's been separated. It's more than the God of Falling. How far can this punishment go?"

Taesan told them about Easy, Normal, and Hard modes.

But he didn't mention that there was also an Alone mode.

The fact that NPCs were also copied might be hard for them to accept. Since the wizard found a way, Taesan was going to leave it to him.

So, when he met Iteon, there was a twist in the story.

"Ah...... It's strange to see it like this."

Iteon looked at Belldandy with a strange expression.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She also met Belldandy in her past life and current life. She met Belldandy twice.

However, she couldn't grant Belldandy's wish.

That Belldandy was now fulfilling her wish and was here. She couldn't help but feel a strange emotion.

Belldandy also seemed to think it was strange and asked Lee Tae-yeon.

"You're doing pretty well, aren't you? No, you're at a considerable level."

"That's obvious. I'm really clearing the labyrinth."

"Huh? But I don't remember meeting you."

"That's because there's a reason for that."

Lee Tae-yeon changed the subject with an awkward face.

She started talking to Taesan.

"You said it was the 87th floor? Maybe it's a floor I know?"

"No, all the floors have changed completely."

"I see... Well, if it's you now, I'll be able to clear the floors I've cleared easily. It's only natural."

"If it's the 72nd floor, you would have met the guides of sin, right?"

"I did. We fought. And I won."

Lee Tae-yeon said proudly.

Taesan was slightly surprised.

In his judgment, the current Lee Tae-yeon didn't have the level to defeat the guides.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Who did you fight?"

"The Fire Spirit King, Vishnu."

"Could you handle the King's world?"

"I had Maria's power, so I was able to erase it."

"......Is that a selective exclusion?"

Vishnu wasn't that great except for the King's world.

Taesan also struggled after using the King's world, but before that, he was able to gain the upper hand in battles without using any special cards.

However, it was still an amazing feat to have won. Lee Tae-yeon had become strong enough.

"Why don't you fight Beldechka over there? She'll be a suitable opponent for you."

"I don't think I can win against her...... but I'll give it a try."

Lee Tae-yeon replied hesitantly.

Lee Tae-yeon went to challenge Beldechka to a fight, and Beldechka readily accepted.

The battle began, and Lee Tae-yeon fought desperately, but ultimately lost.

However, she continued to challenge Beldechka to fights.

"That's amazing."

Kim Hwi-yeon, who was watching the two fight, exclaimed in admiration.

"Did you say Diana? Is she similar to that person?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's much stronger. Even if Taeyeon and Beldegeia combine their powers, it won't work."

"Really? That's amazing."

Kim Hwi-yeon clenched her fists tightly.

"If those two are there, we can survive without any problems."

Taesan didn't say a word.

The past life and present life were vastly different. The quests on Earth were no exception.

The memories of the past life were likely to be of little use.

The gods would also target Taesan seriously, trying to kill people.

But they would win. As they always did.

And so, two days passed.

A new quest began."
