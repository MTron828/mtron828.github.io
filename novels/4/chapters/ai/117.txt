Chapter 118

118. The Second Return, Gathering (2)

"What?"

"Going to Yongin?"

People realized that there were others besides them at a place that was not far away, where they could walk to.

"I have a friend in the Yongin area!"

"I had a family!"

As people with different difficulties or situations couldn't meet friends in the labyrinth, they raised their voices. Hope wrapped them around.

"But then..."

"Should we go to Yongin from here?"

At the same time, despair also trampled them down.

As they walked towards Ansan City Hall, they saw countless monsters. Many people who barely survived, having been chased to the brink of death, were numerous.

Kim Hui-yeon comforted the people who were quickly becoming dark.

"Don't worry! You all got stronger while going down the labyrinth, didn't you?"

She shouted out with a bright face.
Here is the translation of the text:

"And we'll also protect you! When we arrive in Yongin, many more people will gather. Then we can combine our strength! We can survive!"

Under her fervent whisper, the people gathered their minds.

Kim Hui-yeon, who had barely managed to muster some enthusiasm, quickly gathered the people. They left behind unnecessary burdens and put food supplies into their inventory, and formed a line.

Then they set off. Leaving the city hall, they headed towards Yongin.

"'The map is...'

'I got it with the quest. The road is no problem. It's very kind too.'"

They walked cautiously, muttering to themselves.

Tae-san laughed mockingly next to the mountain.

"'One week. Actually, it's a bit too long, you know.'"

Considering that the national territorial strategy took about 15 days, the distance from Anyang to Yongin was surprisingly short.

Although there were tens of thousands of people, their physical abilities were not ordinary. Even the weakest mode had reached the human limit.

Originally, we would have arrived with plenty to spare, but there were entities blocking their way.

[Monster 441623321 appeared.] [Monster 126887995 appeared.]

The monsters pounced on them.

"'Aiya!'"

"'Die!'"

Here is the translation of the text:

People wielded weapons wildly. After their first return, they all made an effort to get stronger. Even those playing on hard mode could defeat F-grade monsters.

However, there were too many of them.

Monsters that were twice as many as them charged at them. People resisted, but those who were overwhelmed were crushed. 

"Ah!"

"Save me!"

The cries for help echoed through the four directions as Kim Hwi-yeon rushed to unsheathe her sword with a worried face.

Whoosh!

Several monsters fell in an instant. But another monster took its place.

"Mid-range attack!"

"I also want to help!"

Other hard mode players were no different. They were in a hurry to deal with the monsters pouring in.

However, there were some who stood out.

"Ah!"

Kang Jun-hyeok, with a still-innocent face, unsheathed his sword and struck down all the monsters rushing towards him with their residual shadows.

Kang Jun-hyeok then stepped forward and crushed the monsters' heads, helping to drive back the encroaching area.

"Are you okay?"

"Th-thank you!"

Lee Tae-yeon was similar. He let out a loud "Hi-ik!" and cried out in pain, but didn't sweat a drop as he defeated the monsters.

His performance was clearly noticeable even compared to hard mode.
Here is the translation of the text:

Despite their struggles, there was no way to prevent the emergence of a gap. Compared to the numbers that had to be reached, the numbers of hard mode and solo mode were too small.

"Aaaaah!"

Outside the group, An Jung-hee let out a scream.

As a normal mode player, she trusted her physical strength and blocked the monsters' attacks in formation.

However, she received too much damage and her health was now at a critical point.

"I hate it!"

She burst into tears and trembled, showing excessive fear and movement, which caused her to become separated from the group and trapped among the monsters.

"Ah......"

The monster raised its massive arm. The woman closed her eyes, her face pale.

Just then, the wind blew.

A muffled sound echoed in her ear, which was still closed.

Her pupils dilated slightly as she opened her eyes.

All the monsters surrounding her were muffled.

"Oh, it's been a long time."

She smiled as she saw the person who was hitting his head, and her face brightened.

"Old Mountain Brother!"

* * *

"Stay back."

"Yes, yes."

She hastily joined the group. Old Mountain looked straight ahead.

The monsters rushed towards him.
Here is the translation of the text:

The innumerable violence of the numberless beasts covered the mountain like a sea. Since they were isolated, there was no way to rescue them. The onlookers sealed their mouths in shock.

"It's too dirty."

The mountain's face twisted into a scowl as it clenched its fists.

Suddenly, the fist shook, and an explosion occurred.

The monsters that were running towards them scattered and disappeared. All the monsters that were approaching, numbering in the dozens of meters, flew up into the air.

"What?"

"What, what?"

The mountain's voice was hoarse with shock as it moved.

The whip tied to its wrist was still moving. It tore apart all the approaching monsters to death.

"About two meters, the speed is not bad. It's still usable."

The mountain muttered to itself as it waved its hand. Several arrows of ice were generated, piercing the monsters.

Hundreds of them flew out at once.

And then, an even larger number of them rushed towards it again.

The mountain's eyes widened.

"I want to have a wide-range technique."

There was something similar. Darkness spread behind the mountain.

[You have activated the Decarabian's Distorted Vegetation.]

Kukuung!

"Wow!"

"What, what?"

The giant roots rose up and trampled the monsters. When people regained their composure, they found that the roots had blocked the monsters' approach.

[You have activated the Ice Arrow.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"The frost arrows are gathering in the air, and their size is growing as they spread cold air in all directions.

'Ahh...'

A sufficient amount of power has gathered to the point where even weak players can sense it.

In no time, a massive ice meteor forms in the sky.

'Well, go ahead.'

[You have activated magic acceleration.]

The meteor drops down amidst the monsters.

With a loud explosion, dust covers the people.

"What's going on just now?"

Mid-Range, who has tidied up his area, rushes in urgently. He gasps at the shocking sight.

"...Brother?"

"Did you come? It's over here."

Tai-san wipes his hands.

A massive crater has formed in front of him.

Tai-san's expression turns solemn.

"Hurry up and get out of here."

Tai-san continues to move away. He tramples and kills the monsters.

During this process, countless people witnessed Tai-san's strength.

And they realized what level of monster Tai-san is."
Here is the translation of the text:

Although everyone knows that Tae-san is strong, they didn't actually feel it in their bones. When they fought against Tae-san's group, they were shocked to see people killing each other in reality. When they tried to stop the wave, they saw that Tae-san had killed all the monsters and then confirmed it, which didn't feel real.

They have finally realized Tae-san's strength.

With their hearts racing, they barely managed to subdue the monsters with a single blow. The monsters that were struggling against their light finger technique flew away and revealed strange skills, causing hundreds to be dragged away.

"Ugh..."

Astonishment.

And fear.

Many emotions were directed towards Tae-san.

Tae-san handled the monsters carelessly.

After handling all the monsters, they moved again. And it became night.

"It seems everyone is tired, let's take a break."

"We need to find a location. Let's go into a building somewhere."

After searching around, they found a building that could fit about ten people. After assigning seats, Kim Hwi-yeon said with a tired face:

"Let's set up the night watch. Let's arrange the order among ourselves..."

"That's not necessary."

Tae-san stepped out of the building and raised his hand.

[You activated the distorted vegetation of Dekarabia.]

Gugugugu!

The roots rose up and wrapped around the building.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san did not stop using his magic and continued to grow, eventually wrapping the building perfectly around him.

"It's enough until tomorrow. A normal monster can't break through, so I can rest assured and sleep."

"Ah, okay..."

Kim Hui-yeon nodded her head with a worried expression.

The fearful gaze towards Tae-san grew stronger.

Tae-san went out without worrying about anything.

* * *

Almost all of the magic was used to wrap the building. It needed to be replenished.

[You had activated the prayer towards the magic.]

Suddenly, his body felt heavy. He opened the status window. All his stats had decreased by half. After waiting for three minutes, the magic was restored once.

"It will all be restored by tomorrow."

The people inside the building were finishing their meals and gradually taking a nap.

Tae-san was resting against the wall outside the building.

Just then, Kim Hui-yeon came to him.

"Tae-san."

She hesitated and apologized.

"I'm sorry."

"What's there to apologize for?"

"......Because of the people, I'm outside, you know?"
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Those who saw Taesan's strength trembled whenever he approached. When he summoned the roots to wrap around the entire building, they looked at him as if they were gazing at a monster.

If they were in the same place, they would have suffocated from fear. Taesan had to come out.

"What have you done to save us?..."

"It doesn't matter. I'm used to it."

It was the same everywhere in the world. Even though he was in a different mode, he surpassed the hard mode, and they thought he was strange, so they rejected him.

Sometimes, he even attacked them like a monster's whip.

Compared to that, he was very gentle now.

"But..."

Kim Hui-yeon bit her lip. Taesan's strength was extremely abnormal. But with that power, he helped them. He had the ability to arrive at his destination alone, leaving everyone behind, but he didn't.

So, he shouldn't be thanked. That was her thought.

Taesan, who had noticed her expression, smiled slightly.

"Useless thoughts are over. But I'm not clingy."

It's inevitable that time will naturally resolve itself.

"Rather, go and bring back Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Jun-hyeok."

"Those two? Okay."

She quietly entered the building, and a short while later, she returned with the three of them.
Here is the translation of the text:

“Why did you come?”

“I couldn't sleep and was bored, so I wanted to talk to my brother for a bit.”

Lee Joon-hwan's expression turned innocent. Taesan's eyes narrowed as he drew his sword.

“There's no time to talk. Kang Jun-hyeok, you first. Draw your weapon.”

“Okay.”

Lee Tae-yeon let out a sigh of relief. Kang Jun-hyeok's eyes gleamed.

“…Are we going to do it like last time again?”

“Where's the time to rest?”

Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Jun-hyeok were in a solo mode, with no other players at the location.

In other words, there was no way to strengthen themselves by dueling each other. The only time they had was when they returned to Earth.

Lee Tae-yeon didn't plan to waste this precious time. Kang Jun-hyeok drew his weapon with enthusiasm.

“Alright! This time, I won't get caught off guard like last time!”

[A duel request. This duel will be fought in a state of mutual equality.] [Duel established.] [Kang Jun-hyeok and Taesan start the duel.]

Kang Jun-hyeok was confident.

As he descended into the labyrinth, his skills had improved even more. Not only did his stats rise when he passed the trials of the gods, but his movement and combat skills had also seen a significant boost.
Here is the translation of the text:

The stats for this duel are identical for both Kang Tae-san and Kang Jun-hyeok. With the intention of producing a different result from last time, Jun-hyeok took a step forward.

And as expected, the result was the same.

"Boom!"

Jun-hyeok fell to the ground in just one minute. Tae-san shook his sword without a speck of dust on it.

"Is that it?"

"Why, why..."

"You're still far behind me. I'm a human who has surpassed what you've achieved in the past."

Even if the stats are equal, the result doesn't change.

"I've improved slightly compared to before, but I still have the habit of neglecting defense when attacking. If I don't correct this, I'll be counterattacked and killed."

"Eh... yeah..."

Jun-hyeok hit his head. Tae-san pointed his sword at I-tae-yeon. She shuddered.

"This is yours. Come."

"Ah!"

I-tae-yeon let out a scream.
