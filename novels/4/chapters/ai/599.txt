Episode 600

600. Side Story, 1st Floor, Lee Tae-yeon (2)

[Rumors say that this labyrinth, created by a great wizard long ago, will grant one wish to those who conquer it.] [This is a confined space.] [Fearsome creatures move silently, and living things die. Everything here exists to oppress you.] [Eternal glory awaits those who break through the deep and dark labyrinth.] [This is the entrance to the labyrinth.] [It's a place where things that would die from a single stab come back to life. The power here isn't that strong.] [Main Quest starts.] [There are many hidden places and secrets here.] [You'll receive rewards based on the secrets you discover.] [1st Floor Quest starts.] [Defeat the 1st Floor boss and pass through.] [Reward: Random stat-boosting potion.] [Secret Reward:???]

The system window that appeared was very long, but I didn't have the mental energy to check it.

Lee Tae-yeon barely calmed his trembling legs and moved forward.

"What, what the...?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She was in a state of panic. It was a dull but extremely peaceful life. Although there was a war going on in a distant country, she thought it was a story unrelated to herself. She didn't believe she would ever feel threatened or in danger.

But suddenly, she was thrown into this situation.

She knelt down, hesitating several times.

But in the end, there was no answer.

If she went outside, the Broken Man would kill her. In the end, she had no choice but to take up a weapon and move forward.

"......Huu."

She took deep breaths, repeating the motion. She barely managed to calm her trembling body.

"I don't know what's going on, but..."

She had to fight. She had to move forward.

She didn't know what would happen, but she had to survive.

That was the most important goal.

She wasn't the only one who had entered this place alone. The choice was given not only to her but to all people on Earth.

Then, someday, she would be able to meet again.

People from the same Earth who were not hostile towards her.

Until then, she absolutely could not die.

As she slowly calmed her mind, she began to feel something she had never felt before. Lee Tae-yeon lightly shook her hand, which was holding a sword.

"......It's changed."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She had a physical ability equivalent to that of an average woman. The shape of her sword was ordinary, at the level of a long sword. It wasn't too burdensome to hold, swing, and run with, but it did require some effort.

However, she didn't feel the weight of the sword as much now.

It wasn't that the sword was light, but rather her body had changed.

"Status window."

[Lee Tae-yeon] [Level: 1] [Health: 100/100] [Mana: 10/10] [Strength: 10] [Intelligence: 10] [Agility: 10] [Attack Power +1] [Defense Power +1] [Target is in a frightened state.]

"Strength and agility."

Those stats must have brought about the change. It was just like a game.

First, she adapted to her changed body.

Lee Tae-yeon took a stance and swung her sword down.

Her completely transformed physical state was unlike anything she had experienced before. Her strength, reaction speed, and everything else were different. It was a more unfamiliar feeling than wearing clothes that didn't fit.

Ordinary players usually took a few months to adapt to their changed bodies.

But.

"Is this enough?"

Lee Tae-yeon moved her sword smoothly. The trajectory of her sword was perfect, without a single deviation.

She had perfectly adapted to her changed physical abilities with just a few swings of her sword.

"Ugh……."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lee Tae-yeon stood with a gloomy expression, grasping her sword with both hands, and slowly advanced.

And finally, a door came into view before her.

"……."

She hesitated in front of the door dozens of times. But eventually, she steeled herself and carefully opened it.

"Bring it on!"

She shouted roughly, grasping her sword with both hands.

And what greeted her was a contemptuous gaze.

"What's with you?"

"Eh……."

A face with a long white beard, looking annoyed. His body, sitting in a chair, was barely half the size of a human. Lee Tae-yeon muttered to herself without realizing it.

"A dwarf?"

[You have encountered the lost king.]

"Are you an adventurer?"

"Ah, yes."

Lee Tae-yeon nodded her head awkwardly. Seeing her attitude, the dwarf let out a deep sigh, as if he had confirmed something.

"I didn't have high expectations from the start, but you're quite foolish."

That was the end of it.

The dwarf lost interest in Lee Tae-yeon.

"Um... who are you?"

Lee Tae-yeon asked cautiously, not seeing him as an enemy.

"A shop owner."

The dwarf puffed on his pipe.

"Not for you, though."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

There was nothing around the dwarf.

"Over there... something..."

"Do it yourself."

A careless voice.

Lee Tae-yeon's face fell at the dwarf's attitude, which seemed uninterested in her.

It wasn't an atmosphere where she could get help. In the end, Lee Tae-yeon had no choice but to move forward.

She passed through the room and entered the next corridor.

And then she saw it.

A beast hostile to her, one that couldn't be found on Earth.

"Kkiiiik!"

[Big Rat appeared.]

Lee Tae-yeon's pupils dilated.

'A rat?'

But it was too big to be a rat. It was the size of a small dog, lightly jumping around.

Its appearance was similar to a capybara's, but it wasn't cute like one.

Its black, bristly fur and the eerie, protruding teeth made an impression.

There was no need to think.

It was an enemy.

Lee Tae-yeon gripped her sword tightly, her hand trembling.

Big Rat let out a mocking laugh, as if there was no need to hesitate, and charged towards Lee Tae-yeon.

Thud.

[You took 10 damage.]

"Ow!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Her flesh and muscles were torn apart. She reflexively swung her sword down, but Big Rat had already created distance between them.

Ka-ching!

Her sword struck the ground in vain.

It was too fast.

In the blink of an eye, Big Rat had bitten her leg. Her late reaction only gave Big Rat more confidence, and it charged at her again.

[You took 9 damage.]

"Ugh!"

She swung her sword down again, but it was the same. Lee Tae-yeon's eyes wavered.

"What's going on? It's too fast!"

She blinked, and Big Rat had already bitten her ankle. If she reacted to its movement, it would have already escaped.

"Kiiik!"

Big Rat didn't stop. It continued to bite her ankle. Unbearable pain flooded her brain.

It hurts.

The pain was so intense that she felt like she was going to lose her mind. When she glanced at her wound, she saw that her bone was exposed.

"Hu, huu."

But she gritted her teeth and endured.

She couldn't run away. Given the speed, ignoring it and passing by was not an option.

She had to defeat the enemy in front of her.

She had to survive and meet people.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Under that thought, Lee Tae-yeon's mind was racing quickly.

"There's no way to react."

Thanks to the strange system called "stats," all of her abilities had increased. To her, it felt like she was even stronger than a professional athlete.

But despite that, she couldn't block it.

So what should she do?

The answer came out.

Predict it.

By understanding the principles of Big Rat's movements and actions, she would move first. Lee Tae-yeon's mind was racing at an incredible speed.

"Kiiik!"

She gritted her teeth a few more times. Lee Tae-yeon endured. She had grasped Big Rat's actions to the maximum.

And finally...

"Now!"

Lee Tae-yeon swung her sword down. She was a little faster than Big Rat's movement. She aimed exactly at Big Rat's trajectory.

She succeeded.

Lee Tae-yeon was certain.

But no, it wasn't. The sword only scratched Big Rat's skin.

"Aaah!"

Lee Tae-yeon screamed in pain.

"Kiiik!"

Big Rat was surprised.

That weak and slow human had left a wound on its skin. Big Rat stumbled back.

But Lee Tae-yeon didn't have the mental capacity to notice that.

"Ah, ah."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She had clearly succeeded in her attack. When she moved her body, she was certain.

But she failed.

The thought that she could never win began to dominate her mind.

"Ugh, ah."

She stumbled and checked her status window. She had only 15 health points left.

If she got hit twice more, it would be all over.

What would happen if her health points dropped to 0?

In the game she knew, the result was always the same.

Death.

A permanent end.

Fear trampled and tore apart her determination and will. She couldn't hold on anymore.

"Aaaaah!"

She turned around and ran away like a coward, stumbling and bleeding as she went.

Normally, Big Rat would have immediately chased after her.

It would have bitten her ankle and finished her off.

But Big Rat was also caught off guard by Lee Tae-yeon's attack. Thanks to that, Lee Tae-yeon was able to survive and escape.

Phew!

"Heh, heh."

Lee Tae-yeon roughly closed the door.

She had survived.

With a sigh of relief, she collapsed onto the floor.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**Initial Battle**

You fled from the first monster you encountered. [10 gold obtained.] [Acquired the title "Cowardly One".] You felt the fear of death and acquired the special passive skill "Death's Line". [You fought a great battle in your first fight, but ultimately lost and fled in fear. However, you managed to survive in a desperate situation and acquired the special passive skill "Path to Life".]

* * *

She looked at her ankle.

"Ugh, ugh."

It was terrifying.

The flesh was torn, and muscles and bones were visible. As the adrenaline wore off, she felt an unbearable pain.

If she didn't receive treatment immediately, she would die from the wound.

But surprisingly, the wound was slowly healing.

It was probably due to the system's assistance. At least, there was no threat of death. Lee Tae-yeon felt a deep sense of relief in her heart.

As she regained some composure, she looked around.

The first thing she saw was a scornful gaze.

"You're weak, cowardly, and a scaredy-cat."

The dwarf spoke with a tone of contempt. Lee Tae-yeon couldn't retort and just hung her head.

She sat there for a whole day.

Fortunately, her health was fully restored, and her HP returned to 100.

However, she couldn't bring herself to move.

She had almost died.

It wasn't just a simple analogy or a game's death. Her life had really been on the line, and it was a situation where her life could have ended.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I didn't have the will to go back down.

Grrr...

“……I'm hungry.”

I could feel the hunger pangs. It was natural, since I had gone a whole day without eating. The thought of starving to death like this was worrisome.

But even so, I didn't have the thought of moving.

The wounds and fear had strongly taken root in her brain.

I wanted to meet people. Not weirdos like dwarves or broken men, but people who could be with me.

But there was no one here.

As she sat with her head hung low in despair, she suddenly remembered.

“……Status window.”

The system window covered the screen.

There, her status was displayed.

If I looked closely at the sword I was holding, a description window for the sword appeared.

I couldn't understand, but a game-like system had taken hold here.

Then.

“Dialogue window.”

Nothing appeared.

But she didn't give up.

“Talking. Chatting. Discussion room……”"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"She continued to spit it out. The dwarf seemed to be noisy, but she didn't stop. Like grasping a thin thread of hope, she recited the memorable words one by one with a desperate face.

And finally.

"Community."

She had found the answer.

Numerous system windows.

And the chat window appeared.

There, she was overcome with emotion, tears streaming down her face, as she sensed the scent of a person. Lee Tae-yeon, without realizing it, reached out her hand towards the system window.

And in front of her, one chat window caught her eye.

[Kang Tae-san[Easy] : What's going on? What is this?]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
