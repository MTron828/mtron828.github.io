**Chapter 431**

431. The 84th Floor, Levienov's World (4)

"Wow!"

The man shouted as he swung his great sword. The sheer force of the swing created dozens of storms.

Taesan didn't back down.

He put strength into his legs and charged forward. Compared to the great sword, his own sword was like a toy, but he swung it with all his might.

"Whoa!"

The collision sent shockwaves in all directions.

The man's face contorted in anger.

Unlike before, Taesan didn't fly backward. He was pushed back, but he dug his feet into the ground and resisted. The man seemed to dislike that, and he moved his hand.

"Clang! Clang! Clang!"

The great sword moved to crush Taesan. Taesan strained every muscle in his body to the limit.

"Rooooar!"

The two clashed, and clashed again.

And then, at some point, Taesan stopped being pushed back.

He was now fighting with all his might.

The blessing of Rakiratas, the master of the howling struggle, was activated. His speed and strength increased exponentially.

"Rooooar!"
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Tesan raised his foot. He lifted his sword to meet the sword falling towards him.

Kwaaaaang!

"Kuwen!"

A man's body was pushed back. The man quickly braced himself, holding back the force.

"Damn it, the blessing of a god!"

[You have activated a forced drop.]

Forced drop.

The effect of the sword ability is to increase the weight of the opponent's sword when it collides with it.

"Hmm."

After several collisions, the man quickly realized something. The weight of his greatsword was getting heavier and heavier.

"Don't make me laugh! This isn't just an ordinary sword! It's my power! Do you think such tricks will work on it!"

"Well, it's still a sword shape, so it'll have some effect."

There was a very slight slowing of the greatsword's movement. Tesan prepared his magic.

[You have activated Baal's Onslaught of Darkness Space.]

The Onslaught of Darkness Space is powerful, but due to insufficient skill, it has not been able to exert its full power.

But this time was different.

The blessing of the god of darkness. The precious child of darkness. Its effect is dominance over all dark magic.

Chwachachachachacha!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The space tainted by darkness accelerates. Within it, there was a power that crushed all objects and interfered with the concept itself.

The man swung his great sword to strike, but the dark magic did not back down easily. It clashed fiercely with the sword, making the man falter.

And Taesan took advantage of the man's opening. In an instant, he pierced deeply into his side.

There was no hesitation in that action. With conviction, he chose to target the opening.

Maria's blessing was activated. The power of God dwelled in Taesan's sword.

Ka-a-a-ang!

"Kuh!"

The man barely blocked the attack by moving his sword hilt, but his body was pushed back.

"This is the blessing of God."

Each and every one of them possessed the ability to change the tide of battle. The overwhelming avatar of the high god, which was thought to be invincible, was no longer feared.

"…Don't laugh!"

The man let out a furious roar.

He filled with rage, raised his great sword high into the sky. The air currents rose, and the atmosphere began to collapse.

Note: "고신" is a term that can be translated to "high god" or "supreme deity", but the context suggests that it might refer to a specific entity or character in the story.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You damn transcenders! You're unreasonable! You give a lot to those you favor, but don't even spare a glance at the rest, treating them like mere ants! You're not gods! You're just powerful troublemakers!

The man gritted his teeth.

"I won't tolerate you! Beings like you shouldn't exist in this world!"

The man declared, his voice echoing like a resolute cry of defiance against the world.

Taesan, meanwhile, moved his body with a nonchalant expression.

"So what's the big deal?"

"What, what?"

"The gods are unreasonable. I know that too. But it's not like they're the only ones who are, right?"

Taesan was an easy-going player.

No matter how strong he became, there were clear limits, and ultimately, he was forced to rely on skills as a shortcut to become stronger, a desperate and unreasonable fate.

But he didn't give up.

The unreasonable thing was this world. The man's words didn't resonate with him at all.

"And you shouldn't talk about unreasonableness. You're the one who said it yourself. You've killed many worlds and countless immortals with the power you received from the gods. You're a testament to unreasonableness yourself."

"Sacrifices are necessary to oppose great beings. They're necessary sacrifices."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In the end, you acted according to your desires, didn't you? Then what's the difference between you and the Transcendents?"

"……."

The man's face turned red, but he couldn't come up with an answer.

"From the start, Transcendents are beings who have risen to their positions on their own from the mortal realm. They weren't born with the role of protecting mortal existence. You can't demand absolute goodness from them."

"Shut up!"

The man swung his sword, unleashing an attack driven by emotions rather than reason. He spat out the words.

"So what's the point?"

"You're acting according to your desires, just like the Transcendents."

In the end, the man's true intentions were simple.

He just wanted to take revenge on the Transcendents who had treated him like a toy and ignored him.

"It's just a simple story, so let's not dress it up unnecessarily."

* * *

"Die!"

The man, whose values had been denied, let out a wail. His sword, filled with pure malice, moved wildly. The space distorted under the overwhelming physical force.

Taesan didn't back down. Having received numerous blessings, he had acquired transcendent power.

However, he didn't back down, but he couldn't overpower the opponent either.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Due to the size of the great sword, it was difficult to win in a frontal battle, as it would easily take away the initiative.

The strategy was to use a close-range combat approach from the beginning. Taesan, who had made up his mind, gathered his mana.

[You activated the Great Collapse [Abnormal].]

The abnormal magic was a partial world change that couldn't be activated unless it had control over mana.

However, thanks to Zelvand's blessing, the condition was met. The black magic, mixed with the sword, was realized in the world.

The great sword and the Great Collapse collided.

With a loud noise, the space began to collapse. The two forces clashed fiercely, neither able to easily overpower the other.

It was Taesan who created a crack in that balance.

[You activated the Magic Explosion.]

The Great Collapse exploded, covering everything in its surroundings.

The man quickly used the great sword to defend himself. A black sphere engulfed everything, blocking his vision.

"It's probably the goal to block my vision!"

It's amusing. He's an immortal, and among them, he has superior power. Vision isn't that important of an ability.

[You activated Baal's Overlapping Darkness.]

However, Taesan's body was overlapped with darkness.

The man's pupils trembled.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan didn't feel anything anywhere.

'...That's right!'

The man fiercely wielded his great sword, spinning it like a windmill to sweep away everything around him.

If he couldn't sense his opponent, he would destroy everything in his surroundings. It wasn't a wrong judgment.

But Taesan also had a skill to counter him.

The great sword didn't reach Taesan. The aftermath was the same. The power that shook the surroundings precisely avoided Taesan.

Taesan arrived behind the man without any resistance.

The man, who belatedly realized Taesan's presence, hastily moved his sword hilt.

The situation was the same as before, but the circumstances were completely different. Close combat was no longer advantageous to the man.

[You activated the Sword of Tenacity.]

Kaah!

"Kkuueeek!"

The ability effect of the Sword of Tenacity increased the shock contained in the sword by threefold.

The man's body trembled. Taesan dug in even deeper.

[You activated the Whirlwind Slash.]

He fiercely swung the sword held in both hands. A storm-like sword attack instantly inflicted wounds all over the man's body.

"This is ridiculous!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The man tried to regain his posture to counterattack, but the weight of the great sword had increased significantly due to the forced fall. It was difficult to quickly regain his posture, and Taesan didn't give him a chance to do so.

He stepped on his foot and pushed him back, making him stumble.

He activated the Great Collapse at zero distance.

Kuuuuuuung!

The man who was hit by the Great Collapse was buried deep into the ground.

Taesan trampled on the man's hand that was holding the great sword. The man spat out blood.

"Ha, haha! Good! I acknowledge it! You, who have received blessings, are stronger than me!"

But there was no sense of defeat on the man's face.

"But I am the avatar of the empty, hollow vessel! Your proxy is waiting here! Grant me the power to empty everything, and bestow it upon me!"

Something enormous began to dwell within the man. A sense of omnipotence appeared on his face.

"No way."

[You have activated Selection Exclusion.]

The enormous entity that had dwelled within the man suddenly disappeared, as if it had never made that choice.

"What the...!"

"The method to counter the Card of the Hollow is something I also possess."

The man was the avatar of the Hollow Vessel.

It was predicted that he could borrow the power of the Hollow in some way.

Taesan had intended to block the activation of the Card of the Hollow itself.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan stabbed a sword into the man's chest.

[You have activated Collapse.]

"Khhk!"

The effect of Collapse is to destroy anything that comes into contact with the sword.

The man's body trembled.

[You have activated Universal Downfall.]

And everything fell. In an instant, the man's strength dropped to the ground.

[You have activated Forced Duel.]

And Forced Duel.

When both parties wield swords, nothing else can be used except the sword. The black sword blocked everything.

"Ah, ah, empty monster... I..."

[You have activated Sacred Creation.]

Kiiiiing!

A golden light enveloped the world. The blessings of the transcendent beings strengthened to an even higher level, allowing the creation of a sacred land even in a world transformed by the gods. The authority to descend upon the man was blocked by the divine.

An environment was created where the gods could not intervene.

"Ah, ah..."

The man's face turned pale.

Taesan imbued the sword with divinity and unleashed it. The light engulfed the god's avatar.

* * *

Taesan gathered his strength.

"It's done."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan tried an experiment this time.

Gosin had intervened many times during battles.

Taesan found it quite annoying.

Could he block the intervention itself?

Although he couldn't do anything about the power that had already descended, he could intervene in the process of its descent.

Taesan quickly made a judgment and took action.

He used the collapse of all things to destroy his opponent's strength, and forced a duel to block other powers. He used his divine power to create a sacred zone and expel Gosin.

After sufficiently weakening his opponent, he judged that he could block the intervention with his divine power, and the result was a success.

Taesan looked down at his feet.

"You're still alive, huh."

The man was still breathing even though his limbs were torn off.

However, he was no longer a threat. Taesan couldn't sense anything from the man anymore, and he could block Gosin's intervention with just his divine power.

"......Can I block the descent of power itself? I'm glad I learned that this time. From now on, I'll make sure to descend it from the beginning."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The man spoke with a calm face. He didn't show any signs of despair from defeat or fear of death.

"Finish it. This time, it's your win. But next time, I'll definitely kill you."

"It sounds like you're saying there's a next time."

"You can't kill me."

The man's voice was filled with confidence.

"I am the empty vessel of a monster, my essence mixed with my master's. Even if you're a transcendent being, you can't expel me."

Indeed, the man's interior was completely empty.

His essence was not here.

"After all, time is infinite. Our goal is not to kill you, but to make you one of us."

The man sneered.

"We won't give up on you. If we take down one, two will rise, and if we take down two, three will rise. We'll constantly target you, using all the means at our disposal to analyze and counter you. How long can you hold out?"

The man ridiculed Taesan.

"Try your best. Let's see what happens next. It won't be like this time."

"There is no next time, that's for the best."

Taesan drew his sword. The man waited calmly.

Swish.

Taesan's sword was imbued with divine energy.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The man ridiculed Taesan.

"With such a shabby divine power, you can block my descent, but you can't cut off my true essence."

"The gods called me the key. I think it's because of this. I want to confirm it with my own body."

The divine power mixed with blackness.

The atmosphere of ash. The boundary was dyed black.

The man's face stiffened.

"...What?"

"That's correct."

Taesan was convinced by the man's reaction.

"What, what is this?"

The man was shocked. He didn't know much about Taesan. He was only protecting the world of Levinov because his master had told him to.

He thought that the gods were targeting Taesan because they received the favor of the gods and could handle blackness.

It was enough to make them stand out and make them their own.

But this...

The man was terrified.

He was afraid now.

That ash-colored thing was neither within the laws of the universe nor was it the gods'.

It could separate his true essence, mixed with the gods', from himself.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The long-forgotten fear of death has revived once again.

"Ah, spare me......"

"You've killed many people, haven't you? Then you should have been prepared to die too."

The ash-colored man pierced through him. The man let out a scream. The thing contained within him exploded and seeped into the depths of the mountain."

Note: The translation tries to maintain the dark and ominous tone of the original text. The phrase "잿빛이 남자를 꿰뚫었다" is particularly vivid, with "잿빛" meaning "ash-colored" and "꿰뚫었다" meaning "pierced through", creating an image of a pale or ghostly figure piercing through the man.
