Chapter 146

146. Outside. The battlefield of the gods (2)

[Expect a joyful battle this time. Kang Tae-san, come in here.]

There was a deep sense of goodwill in that voice.

As Rakirata's presence disappeared, a path appeared on the altar. Tae-san trembled and said:

"What's going on?"

Rakirata's demeanor had changed too greatly. Not only was his name being called, but he, who rarely revealed his emotions, had a full cup of goodwill in his voice.

A ghost spoke:

[I think you've chosen to fight against the guide of sin and that's why you're like that. There's also the option to cooperate together.]

"Why choose such an option?"

It will ultimately lead to a fight against the guide of sin. One cannot coexist with them.

[You may accept it like that, but most people are not. The strong ones are too powerful for a 30th-floor adventurer to handle. It's unclear when one will reach that level. Given this reality, choosing to cooperate with them is not an unusual thing.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The ghost spoke calmly. The guide of sin's path had an influence on the entire labyrinth, so it was a dangerous choice to oppose. It was only natural to form an alliance with each other.

[I didn't think that was bad, but...]

First, we form an alliance. And while descending into the labyrinth, we strengthen our power and stab each other in the back. That was the most clean choice.

[But you chose to oppose them. It's a path of struggle and death, and neither side will be satisfied.]

"Is that because you have a good impression of me?"

[From now on, your path will only be filled with struggle and death. You'll just keep going without rest or repose.]

"That's how it was from the beginning."

He had never stopped his steps.

[It's because I'm going in the direction that Larakitas likes better. It's not bad. If I do this, those guys won't be able to do anything.]

"It's not bad."

The favor of the gods always brings benefits.

Taesan stood in front of the passage. When I put my hand in, I felt a sense of searching for Taesan along with a slight backlash.

[The path to the gods' battlefield] [Level limit: 75]

"Do you have a limit?"

[Ah, that's why I found it on the 30th floor, right? It's really disgusting?]

Note: The translation is a bit rough, and some parts may not make sense in English. The original text seems to be a conversation between two characters, with a fantasy setting and a storyline involving a labyrinth and gods.
Here is the translation of the text:

The ghost laughed eerily.

"I don't think it's even worth mentioning the level limit, is it? It's already at a level of 75. And the level limit is the only thing, there's no limit on stats or skills?"

"Do you know nothing about the system of this labyrinth?"

"It's unlikely. This place is completely different from the outside world. Even gods wouldn't be able to get information about this place from the outside. We can only get information from adventurers who have fled and been caught, but it's impossible to get accurate information from those who have given up."

"It's a good story for me."

Tae-san put his hand into the void. An unpleasant sensation enveloped his entire body, and the space around him was distorted.

When his vision cleared, Tae-san found himself in a forest.

The first thing he noticed was that it wasn't natural. The trees and ground seemed to be artificially created.

Tae-san looked up at the sky, furrowing his brow.

A massive hole, similar to one that had appeared on the earth, was visible in the sky.

Several unpleasant gazes were felt from that place.

"Are you gods?"
Here is the translation:

"There must be some kind of rule here, so I won't be able to intervene directly with you."

In other words, indirect intervention is possible.

"Is this a created world?"

"It seems so." ["You have triggered a leap."]

The Taesan pushed aside the trees and jumped into the sky. Looking around, he saw a faint, transparent wall in the distance.

Even from a distance, it seemed wider than an ordinary city.

After landing on the ground, Taesan walked slowly.

* * *

Taesan walked through the grass, feeling the presence of many people.

"It seems like there are many people nearby."

He could sense the sound of a fierce battle from a distance, and it seemed that many people were fighting.

I was thinking of heading towards that place first.

"Ugh, I don't like it."

A hole in the sky appeared, and the memories of the earth surfaced, making me feel uneasy.

After walking slowly, I finally arrived at the place where the battle was taking place.

"Die!"

Hundreds of people wearing red armor and blue armor were fighting each other.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was a fierce battle. They clashed, breaking each other's armor and thrusting their swords into the gaps. About five men in green leather armor cowered with frightened faces between them.

"Can we escape...?"

"It's not impossible, but without support, it's going to be tough,"

"Are we all done for?"

"...".

Their faces turned as black as charcoal.

The man on the mountain approached them, bowed, and greeted them.

"Hello?"

The man in green leather armor was startled when he saw the man on the mountain.

"Who are you?"

"A stranger?"

"I'm here for the first time. Why are you fighting?"

First, they needed to get information. What was their purpose here, and how should they attack?

"First?"

The man's eyes changed suddenly. He asked cautiously:

"Ah... are you alone?"

The man on the mountain nodded, and the man in green leather armor smiled wryly.

"Then die! Heretic!"

All the men in green leather armor charged at once, moving with precision and thrusting their short swords at the man on the mountain.

And then they returned to their previous state before the attack.

"What's going on?"

"What's this again?"

The man on the mountain clenched his fist.

Boom!
Here is the translation of the text:

The people wearing green clothes flew away, excluding the man standing at the front.

"Ah, ah?"

"Why do you ask questions without answering and attack instead?"

It was an attack that was not worth fighting back against. The giant Tai San slapped the head of the only surviving man.

"Go to sleep."

"Ugh!"

The man fell to the ground, uttering a short cry.

Tai San stood up and turned around.

The red armor and blue armor paused their fight and stared at him.

"Shall we continue?"

Tai San leaned against a tree. The most magnificent red armor-wearing person frowned.

"Who are you?"

"I am Tai San."

"That's not something to drink. What god do you believe in?"

"I don't have one."

Lakirata, Masin, and Maria don't believe in it either. Tai San has a close relationship with them.

The magnificent armor-wearing person was furious at Tai San's response.

"Don't joke! This is the battlefield of those who believe in gods! The unbeliever cannot enter!"

"But you have actually entered."

Tai San shrugged his shoulders. His calm demeanor made the man clench his teeth in frustration.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Is it really true that the believers of the god of blue-green grass have been crushed? I'm a believer of the sun god born from the sky! I believe in a high god, not some trivial god!"

"Ha! You're saying that a god born from the sky like the sun god is a high god? Don't joke around!"

The man who wore a magnificent blue armor seemed to disagree with this statement and snorted.

"Our god, the god of the land, is the true high god!"

"You're believing in a god who has lost its fundamental nature? You're just spewing nonsense!"

"You're spewing nonsense without even having a foot on the ground!"

The eyes of the men wearing red and blue armor grew fierce.

"Die!"

"Return to the side of your god!"

They started fighting again, and the existence of the Great Mountain seemed to have forgotten itself, with the two sides killing each other. The Great Mountain spat out its tongue at the sight.

"This is a normal human being, I guess not."

The green-clad one recognized that the man was alone and intended to kill him, saying he was a heretic. The blue and red ones talked to each other for a few words and then started killing each other.

"[Fanatics are all like that. Normal people wouldn't enter such a place.]"

"I need to get information."

The Great Mountain ultimately struck the cheek of the defeated man.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Wake up."

"Ah!"

The man with a green face suddenly jumped up. He looked around with a blank face, then saw the giant and let out a loud shout.

"You heretic! Daring to kill the divine being! You will receive divine punishment!"

"This is really annoying."

The giant roared again. It was a struggle to control his strength so he wouldn't die.

Despite being beaten, the man with a green face didn't die and let out a loud shout again.

The giant scowled at him.

"I don't understand. Do what you want."

If they didn't listen, he didn't plan to resolve the issue with words anymore.

The giant got up. He was still pointing his fist at the red and blue people who were about to die.

"Die!"

"Aaaa!"

However, the sound was extremely small and couldn't be heard by them. The giant shook his head and clenched his fist.

"Waaa!"

Pfft.

The man's head, which was screaming with a bloodshot face, was flattened.

Suddenly, the battlefield fell silent.

"Eh?"

"Eh, eh eh?"

"Would you please listen to my words when you're done being angry?"

Note: The story appears to be a fantasy or adventure scenario, with a giant, a man with a green face, and a conflict between them. The dialogue is informal and colloquial, with some phrases and words that may not be commonly used in modern Chinese.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san said. It was an unbelievable calmness, as if he had just killed someone.

A red-armored man, who had regained his composure late, let out a loud shout.

"You! Dare to..."

Kwah!

The man's head was also crushed. Tae-san shook his hand.

"Just listen to me, okay?"

"What?"

Kwah!

"Are you kidding me?"

Kwah!

All those who opened their mouths were crushed.

When five people had died, they finally closed their mouths.

Tae-san smiled satisfactorily and clapped his hands.

"Alright, I'll only let the ones I choose open their mouths. It's not that hard, right?"

"...What?"

Kwah!

"I'll only let the ones I choose speak."

Everyone froze like a fawn in front of a lion, and Tae-san raised his finger.

"First, you."

The most luxurious red-armored man, who was grasped by Tae-san's finger, twitched his body.

"...?"

"You can talk. I won't kill you."

"...Why?"

"I told you, I'm here for the first time. So, just tell me one by one, okay?"

Tae-san sat down on a rock and glared at the pale man with a stern expression.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What is this place for? Let me explain it to you."

"What is this place for, you ask?..."

"You're asking why we're here and what we're fighting for?"

I roughly heard the story from Baigan, but I also need to know the detailed information.

The man's face trembled as he spoke to Tae-san.

"Is this really the first time you've been here?"

"Yes, it is. Won't you answer?"

Tae-san clenched his fist. The man quickly regained his composure and began to speak rapidly.

"This place is the battleground of gods. People who believe in various gods gather here to prove the greatness and strength of their gods."

"Is proof just a matter of killing each other?"

"It's the easiest way. By killing those who believe in other gods, one can spread the greatness of their own god."

As he spoke, the man's face grew flushed with excitement.

"Only those who possess exceptional strength among those who believe in gods are qualified to enter this glorious battleground. No one can refuse this glory."

His words were filled with an uncontainable sense of pride. Tae-san scrutinized the man.
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have launched a reconnaissance.] [Malakas Half] [Fanatic]

The existence inside the labyrinth is not visible, so I couldn't see your physical condition or level, but I could sense your strength and prowess.

"It's strange..."

"So, what level are you at here?"

"We are strong."

Malakas said proudly.

"No one can ignore us. We want to resolve conflicts through dialogue rather than battle, and no one can block our path."

Although it was a grandiose statement, the people wearing red armor as well as those wearing blue armor looked approving.

Tai Shan was perplexed.

"What kind of people are you?"
