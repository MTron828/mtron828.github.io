348 (Side Story). Earth on the brink of destruction. Lee Taeyeon (3)

Everything around begins to vanish. The depths of the labyrinth. The highest level equipment that can be obtained at the edge of it.

The overwhelming force does not discriminate against its target. Lee Taeyeon also struggles to breathe in the rising heat.

But it doesn't matter.

[You have activated the Immortal Shadow.]

Lee Taeyeon's body was covered in shadow.

Even in the light and heat that engulf the world, the shadow that surrounded her did not disappear.

It was a part of the darkness itself that has existed since the creation of the world, symbolized by the shadow. It could not be erased with simple power.

The outer shells of the monsters are scorched by the overwhelming heat. Their bodies collapse and deteriorate.

Kuuuuung!

If they had stayed there, all the monsters would have burned to death, but three monsters with double digits flew in front of the red giant.

Whack!

The bodies of the two monsters grew larger. Their expanded and enlarged bodies endured the heat of the red giant pouring down on them.

Crackling!
As the power of the red giant was fully absorbed, the monster's body instantly turned into sand and disappeared.

And a single-digit monster writhed in the gap.

Gathering the negative substances that make up the body, it emits a violet beam that penetrates the world.

The violet power clashes with the red giant.

Kuuung......

The red giant, which manifested power as if to burn the earth, slowly subsided.

Itaeyeon, who had collected the shadows, frowned.

"I could only erase three?"

The two single-digit monsters that blocked the red giant with their entire bodies disappeared without a trace.

But the remaining four monsters had suffered considerable damage but did not fall.

The three monsters defended and one single-digit monster neutralized the red giant with the beam.

"Damn. It was a trump card."

She put the staff that had turned ashen back into her pocket.

The red giant's staff was only usable once. And if used, it would activate the immortal shadow that could not be used for a while. She had intended to send at least four, but could only bring down three.

What remains are two single-digit monsters.

And one single-digit monster.
Here's the translation of the text:

"Various things. Really."

Her cold tongue makes a quick judgment.

She cannot deal with four at once.

First, she needed to reduce the numbers.

[You triggered the breath of the hidden mouse.] [You triggered a hidden story that no one knows.] [You triggered an invisible shadow.]

Without leaving a trace of presence or existence, she disappears.

The monsters that were on guard pause.

Itaeyeon quietly flew and arrived at the double-digit monster.

In her hand was a black gem.

"See you later."

[You triggered the forced seal of the distorted space.]

Kiiiiing!

The gem shines and swallows one of the double-digit monsters.

Itaeyeon quickly seized the falling gem.

Forced seal of the distorted space.

Seals a presence below a certain level for an hour. Though she wanted to use it on a single-digit monster, her power wasn't sufficient to seal such an existence.

Three left. Itaeyeon swiftly took out another item from her inventory.
She clenched a handful of items and scattered them into the sky.

"You used remnants of an adult who cried out for peace."

As the dust scattered, it enveloped a single-digit monster, quickly forming an colorless prison. Despite the monster's attempts to move, the prison made of dust showed no sign of wavering.

The remains of an adult who cried out for peace. An item that forcibly excludes designated targets from battle.

Just a fragment of that dust alone was worth more than ten thousand gold.

Now out of the labyrinth, it was an item she couldn't find again if lost, causing a pang in her heart. Yet if it could exclude single-digit monsters, it was a bargain.

"If only there were forced duels, it would have been so much easier."

Now, there were two double-digit monsters left.

She steadied her breathing. The equipment covering her body began to emit light.

"You activated an attack power boost." "You activated time-running shoes." "You enforced mandatory mental tranquility." "You activated negative emotion attack power conversion." "You..."

She activated numerous pieces of equipment and skills she possessed.
Here is the translated text:

Itaeyeon soared through the air. With a sword in one hand and a shield in the other, she sprinted faster than usual.

Swish.

She kicked off the ground.

In an instant, she moved above the monster's head and struck down with her sword.

"[Critical hit activated.]" "[Additional damage activated.]"

Kwaaaah!

With a thunderous roar, the monster's body shook.

[32,421 damage to Monster 43.]

Clang! Clang!

She continued to swing her sword. The gigantic monster, compared to Itaeyeon who was merely dust in size, was constantly pushed away.

Meanwhile, another monster relentlessly pressured Itaeyeon. It swung numerous arms to strike her down.

Swish.

Itaeyeon kicked off the ground and raised her shield.

Kaaaah!

With a recoil of strength, the monster was repelled. Itaeyeon seized the opportunity and thrust her sword into the monster's chest as it flew back.

She could handle the two-digit monsters alone. She drew her staff towards the fallen monster on the ground.

"[You activated the remnants of countless stars.]"

Light began to pour like a waterfall onto the monster.
The entire body of the monster shook roughly from the impact. Although not at the level of a red giant, its power was significant, being an upper-class wand.

Itaeyeon quickly dealt with one monster.

Then, like a tank, she charged towards another monster and raised her shield.

Kaaaang!

"Ugh!"

She let out a small groan. A formidable force was felt beyond her shield.

But it wasn't enough to push her back. She put strength into her legs and pushed the shield.

Kwoong!

The monster was knocked back.

The shield she bought on the 100th floor had the effect of deflecting attacks without damage if she could withstand them with her physical strength.

She kicked off. She ran towards the bouncing monster and pressured it.

Kwaack.

A long scratch was drawn on the monster's chest. It was the moment she aimed to deliver the finishing blow.

"[Your Death Line has been triggered.]"

Chilling.

In an instant, her instincts warned her.

If she moved like this, she would die.

She gritted her teeth. The ring on her left hand glowed.

"[You have activated limited spatial teleportation.]"

Itaeyeon teleported behind the monster and simultaneously, light burst forth.
The prison made of adult malice fell apart, and a violet beam surged forth.

Crack!

The monster struck by the beam vanished instantly.

She hastily raised her shield against the monsters that couldn't even serve as shields themselves.

Kaaaah!

The violet beam collided with the shield, causing her pupils to dilate.

The shield was melting away in an instant.

"This!"

She quickly opened her inventory. Twisting a fragment of distorted space, she threw it towards the beam.

"You activated the Fragment of Distorted Space."

Space twisted, and light warped.

The Fragment of Distorted Space: an item that distorts space itself to perfectly block the opponent's attacks. It was a trusted item that had never failed her before.

But in that chilling moment, she swiftly activated her skills.

"You activated Resilience." "You activated First Attack Weakness."

Kiiiiing!

The beam split into dozens of pieces, collapsing everything around.

Her pupils widened.

The Fragment of Distorted Space was collapsing under the violet beam.

"You received 32,421 damage."

"Grrrr!"


She barely managed to plant her feet on the ground, groaning in pain.

"...Ha."

She let out a bitter laugh.

A breach was made in the distorted space.

There, she activated her resilience and first attack weakening, but it was only 32,000.

If it had hit normally, it would have meant enough damage to kill her several times over.

"Haah."

She sighed deeply and looked at the single-digit monster.

An enemy with unpredictable odds.

Fortunately, dealing with the remaining monsters put her in a 1:1 situation.

"You have activated ten thousand possibilities."

The simulation kicks in. Cases flood into Taeyeon's mind.

Countless possibilities are calculated in an instant, and a conclusion is drawn.

This is her skill, one that not even Taesan could possess. It predicts the future and calculates ten thousand possibilities, paving the way to victory.

First. Battle relying on the magic of the staff. Result: her death.

Second. Battle using all the pieces of distorted space. Result: her death.
Third. Using various potions in battle. The result is her death.

...

...

...

7822nd. Constantly targeting the monster's weak points while shielding her body, she fought for a long time.

The result is her victory.

The answer appeared.

"No."

But she erased the answer.

Her hiding skills also elude the monster's detection. Based on previous experiences, she knew that as well.

By shielding her body and constantly harassing the monster, slowly depleting its stamina, victory is possible.

But then the monster would turn its attention to others, not just Itaeyeon.

No single-digit monsters can be stopped by others instead of Taesan.

So, facing the monster head-on without stepping back.

With that condition set, she triggers the possibility ten thousand times again.

Ten thousand simulations. Every result ends with her death.

"[You have triggered ten thousand exclusions.] [You have triggered ten thousand possibilities.]"

Simulate again. Exclude all the scenarios where she failed and recalculate. The result remained unchanged. Only her death was visible.

She did not stop.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the blink of an eye, she triggers tens of thousands of possibilities. The process took less than 2 seconds.

"[You have activated tens of thousands of possibilities.]"

Another ten thousand simulations.

The result: 9,999 deaths.

And one victory.

"Let's go."

She stepped forward. There was no time to hesitate. To reach the single possibility among tens of thousands, she could not afford to waver.

Without hesitation, onward.

Blame.

She dashed towards the monster. Opening her inventory, she scattered powder.

"[You have activated an intricately woven countless piece.]"

The powder dispersed into the world, spreading even to the monster. Simultaneously, it melded with her senses.

Everywhere the powder spread became within the range of her senses.

The amorphous monster's body quivered. No omens were visible, but Itaeyeon, who meticulously scattered the pieces, could discern what the monster was after.

Blame.

Itaeyeon twisted her body.

Simultaneously, dozens of violet beams pierced through the earth and spread in all directions.
Sure, here's the translation of the text:

---

Kugugugung!

The power to kill her with each and every touch. Suppressing the eerie sensation, she rushes towards the monster.

The monster's beam is almost instantaneous, impossible to foresee, but her heightened senses allow her to anticipate even that.

She manages to evade the firing beam somehow and closes in on the monster.

The monster's attack is a straight purple beam. It was not difficult to dodge once she closed the distance.

She grits her teeth.

Kiiiiing!

The beam fires again. Itae-yeon narrowly evades by reading the signs.

"Got it!"

Approaching within a certain distance, Itae-yeon raises her staff.

"You have activated the Lightning Strike of the Needle Thunder."

Kurrring!

Lightning strikes, piercing through the monster.

The monster momentarily freezes in its tracks.

Needle Thunder. It always hits and temporarily immobilizes the struck target. It's highly effective but has a short range, so she had to get close enough.

This translation captures the action-packed scene described in the original Korean text.
Here's the translation of the text:

"So far, so perfect. She immediately engaged the stiffened monster. Pulling out her sword, she thrusts it into the monster.

Squelch.

The sword pierces through the monster.

The dark entity gathers strength. Recognizing the signs, Itaeyeon swiftly maneuvers her feet.

[You have triggered the pace of time.]

Instantly, time seems to slow down. Itaeyeon swiftly moves behind the monster.

Time starts flowing again, and the united rays turn the direction where she stood into dust.

She deeply embeds the sword into the monster's body and throws a potion there.

Chiiiiing!

The sound of corrosion is heard as the dark entity begins to crumble.

She raises the corners of her mouth.

The potion she used is Saint's Divine Blood. It ignites the flesh and soul of beings denied by the gods.

Indeed, it had an effect on the monster too. Its movements, visibly in pain, slowed down.

She continues to thrust the sword.

The monster continues to emit rays, but Itaeyeon, who can read the signs, evades them all.

'I can win!'

She grips the sword.

With a heightened spirit, she continues to attack the monster."
Throughout, crises struck intermittently. Unable to evade the raging beams, she was hit repeatedly, but each time, she endured thanks to the effects of the gear she wore.

Numerous wounds began to mark her alien body. She narrowly dodged the onslaughts and slowly accumulated damage.

Then, the end came.

Instinctively, she realized that with just this one strike, she could defeat them.

"Kiiing!"

Avoiding the pouring light, she raised her sword.

The moment when she felt victorious filled her mind.

Thunk.

"Huh?"

Someone grabbed her arm.

Turning her gaze, she saw a monster gripping her arm.

"Ah."

She was forcibly sealed in a distorted space.

The monster sealed with that gem. After an hour, it broke free from the seal.

Ten thousand possibilities, based on her simulations, turned back.

No calculations considered external intervention.

"Kiiing."

The alien monster prepared to emit light. She urgently tried to move, but her response was delayed.

Before she could dodge, the light shot out.

All the equipment meant to save her life had already been used up.

She dies.
Here's the translation of the text:

It was the moment when that thought filled her mind.

[Kang Taesan activated a temporary time freeze.] [Time within 100 meters around you stops for 2 minutes.]

The monster that was about to unleash light stopped.

"Huh?"

Itaeyeon twisted her hand. She swiftly defeated the two-digit monster that had grabbed her arm.

"That was close."

Itaeyeon absentmindedly looked in the direction where a voice echoed.

There stood Taesan.

"Taesan...."

"The temporal freeze didn't distinguish friend from foe. I was a bit delayed due to measuring the distance. Sorry."

Taesan approached with a weary face.

"Let's finish this."

"Yeah. Okay."

Itaeyeon drove her sword into the frozen monster.

The entity burst, its force scattering in all directions.

One two-digit monster charged, but Taesan and Itaeyeon moved together and swiftly defeated it.

"We won?"

"We won, so we're here. We managed to secure victory in the end."

"...I see."

They had won.

They survived. Itaeyeon felt a faint sense of relief in her chest. Taesan looked at her as she sank down with a bitter expression.
"Unfortunately... I don't think there's any room for celebration."

"Ah..."

It was only then that Itaeyeon realized. The number of life force signals from the other side had noticeably decreased.

They had undoubtedly won this battle.

But that didn't mean everyone had survived.

"Well, a victory is still a victory. We can be happy about it for now. Let's go back."

Taesan turned his body. Itaeyeon stared blankly at his back for a moment, then staggered to her feet.

The outcome of the battle.

The extermination of all the monsters.

And the complete destruction of the city that she and the others had worked so hard to build.

They had achieved a victory that left nothing but scars.
