**Episode 464**

464. Those Who Want to Become Gods on the 88th Floor (3)

The next day.

People started moving again.

Their goal was to escape from the Immortals' grasp and obtain their own village. The leader of the group said,

"As Mr. Taesan said, it seems that the west side is not yet fully under their control. We should head there."

"I know a place. It's a remote area where no one goes, so they probably haven't reached it either."

People started sharing their knowledge of hidden forests and rugged terrain. After organizing their stories and deciding on a location, they headed towards their destination.

Taesan naturally joined them.

[Should we just follow them like this?]

"No."

Taesan shook his head in response to Bardray's quiet question. He didn't need to move. The other party would come to them soon enough.

Hehehe!

A horse's neighing sound could be heard from afar. And the sound was getting closer and closer.

People's faces changed rapidly. The leader shouted with a pale face.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Everyone! Run away to the forest!"

People rushed towards the nearby forest. But their pursuers were faster.

"You scoundrels!"

A loud shout echoed.

"You wicked unbelievers! Where do you think you're running to?"

"Aaahhh!"

The knights surrounded the people in an instant, causing them to scream and fall to the ground.

"Ah, ah......"

The leader's face turned pale.

Taesan quietly watched the scene unfold.

Hehehe!

The dozens of knights on horseback wore blue armor.

The one with the most extravagant armor stepped forward.

"I am Kantarada, the loyal knight commander serving the great Lord Paragup!"

The people's faces filled with despair at his declaration.

"Knight Commander......!"

The immortals didn't personally come to catch the unbelievers.

They used their minions to capture those who didn't believe in them, forcing them to come along.

When caught, they had to fight for their lives or scatter and flee. Not all minions were strong, so they had managed to overcome several crises in this way until now.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But among those cowards, there was no escape for the one called the Knight Commander.

The Knight Commander was a superhuman who had directly received power from God, and could single-handedly annihilate them.

In the end, people gave up trying to flee and trembled with fear.

Kantara gazed at the people with a gloomy face.

"Many. Lord Paragup will be pleased!"

He raised his large sword and swung it down.

Kuung!

"You, who don't believe in Lord Paragup and try to flee! I'd like to kill you all, but..."

He spoke as if it was a special opportunity, with a tone of false kindness.

"The great Lord Paragup will show mercy even to you wretches! Follow us to our holy land! We'll let you experience the greatness of Lord Paragup!"

"……."

There was no response.

Everyone knew that those who were taken away would either become strange or never return.

People tried to back away from Kantara, but the knight guarding the rear threatened them, pulling on the reins.

Kantara clicked his tongue.

"I don't understand. There's no happiness like believing in God. I'll have to drag you along by force if necessary."

Ssruung.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Kantara grasped his sword with a twisted smile.

"Bring them here!"

"Aaahh!"

"Save the people!"

The knights dragged a few people by their hair and threw them in front of Kantara.

"We don't have enough men to take all of you, so..."

There were dozens of knights, but their group numbered in the thousands. No matter how strictly they were monitored, some were bound to escape.

Kantara raised his sword with a cruel smile.

"So, I'll show you what happens when you try to escape. Let's start the torture."

"Aaahh!"

"No!"

The people wailed and struggled. Kantara's face lit up with great pleasure at the sight.

He enjoyed watching people suffer and writhe in agony.

He wanted to torture them himself and hear their screams. The pretext was to set an example, but in reality, it was his hobby.

Kantara chuckled and moved his sword. Fear appeared in the people's eyes.

The blade was getting closer to their skin.

It was the moment he was looking forward to, imagining the screams that would follow and enjoying himself.

Suddenly.

His arm was grabbed by someone.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Kantara made a disgusted face.

A black-haired man from the group of unbelievers was holding his arm with a blank expression.

"Where do you think you're going?"

Kantara's face contorted in anger.

"You want to be a hero, huh? I'll make you one myself."

Kantara swung his sword with a frustrated face, moving at an incredibly fast speed that surpassed human comprehension.

Ka-aang!

"Ugh!"

But Kantara's sword, which had clashed with Taesan's neck, bounced back.

Kantara's hand, which couldn't withstand the force, was torn apart. He stumbled backward with a shocked face.

"What, what's going on?"

Taesan didn't respond, instead gazing at Kantara with a piercing stare.

In that instant, Kantara felt a chill run down his spine as if everything was being revealed.

"I sense divinity."

"What?"

"It's not right. I said the battle has been going on for hundreds of years. It seems to be partially moving on to the next stage. But it's still far off."

"......What nonsense!"

Kantara shouted, clutching his hand.

"Everyone! Kill that unbeliever!"

"Yes, yes!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The reporters replied, but they were all hesitant and couldn't take a step forward. They could also sense that something was off about Taesan.

"Let's keep it simple."

His goal was to find stability.

The goal of the immortals was to become gods through faith.

Then, he would crush that faith.

Taesan had released all the seals he had kept hidden. A massive presence began to etch itself into the world.

"What?"

"Yes."

People who couldn't keep up with the situation and were flustered opened their mouths.

They had lived every day feeling the clash of power between the immortals. Therefore, they knew well about their powers.

The power of the immortals was enormous and overwhelming, but they didn't feel any sense of reverence or worship. It was just like looking at a massive monster.

However, the power and aura Taesan showed now were different.

Just by looking at him, they felt a sense of reverence, and their bodies and souls naturally submitted.

They were seeing a true god for the first time.

As Taesan revealed himself, the continuous clash of powers between the immortals ceased.

The gaze of the two massive beings turned to Taesan.

What was contained within was awe.

"I am a god."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A solemn voice resounded. A grandiose and arrogant declaration. Cantara wanted to deny those words.

But his lips wouldn't open.

Taesan revealed his divine power. A massive aura that enveloped everyone.

Everyone realized that Taesan was the true god.

Taesan spoke calmly and took a step forward.

The wind gently wrapped around the people.

Nature moved according to Taesan's will.

Until Taesan placed his hand on Cantara's forehead, Cantara couldn't resist at all.

Taesan could see Cantara's will and soul.

He was an extremely evil being. Even if he didn't believe in Paragup, he was a being capable of killing countless people.

"I will punish you."

With those solemn words, Cantara's body crumpled like a broken doll.

The knights couldn't even breathe as they watched the scene.

Taesan approached them, and even if he were to stab them directly in the chest, they wouldn't be able to do anything.

"You believe in a false god. I should punish you, but... I will forgive you."

"Ah, thank you..."

The knight stuttered and knelt down. His faith in Paragup was shattered. And Taesan took his place.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I have come to this place to punish those who dare to claim to be gods. Go. Go and tell them. The true god has come to restore the world to its original state."

"Yes, yes."

The knights fled in a hurry.

Taesan turned his body, gazing at their backs for a moment.

People were staring at Taesan in a daze. The leader and Jelatin were no exception.

Taesan spoke to them.

"Follow me."

He moved forward.

"Follow me, and watch as the world changes for the better."

People nodded their heads as if in a trance.

* * *

Taesan moved forward.

He revealed his full power and advanced.

The people following him gazed at him in a daze as they moved forward.

[Did you intentionally change your tone?]

Taesan nodded. Bardley asked in a puzzled tone.

"What, now that you're a god, you can use a tone fitting for a god, but... that's not your personality, is it? What are you aiming for?"

"Yes. I need them to believe I'm the real god, so it's better to adjust my tone accordingly."

[Like gathering the faith of all humanity on Earth?]

"I'm not aiming for that. The words of Balbam came to mind."

Note: Balbam is likely a character or entity mentioned earlier in the story, but without more context, it's difficult to provide a more specific translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Balbam said. There are many ways to become a god, and one of them is to be remembered as a god in people's minds and to be engraved in the world."

"He was the god of the earth. However, as the faith of all humanity reached an extreme level, stability was still lacking."

"So, he thought of stabilizing it by making the people of Mariseion remember him as a god."

"And I also want to destroy it."

Taesan soon arrived at a massive city.

"What city is this?"

"Ah, it's a commercial city."

The leader spoke cautiously, with a very humble attitude.

"It was the largest commercial city on the continent, where many technicians and merchants gathered. But now..."

"Intruders!"

"Non-believers have come!"

The city was in chaos. Soon, people wielding hammers and axes burst out of the doors.

"Capture them!"

"Make them serve Lord Keboruak!"

"...It has become like this. This place is called the holy land of Keboruak."

"The holy land?"

Taesan sneered.

"What's with this?"

The fanatics glared and rushed towards him. And when they confirmed Taesan's appearance, they stopped in their tracks.

"Huh...?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Uh, ah."

[You have activated a limited blink.]

Taesan jumped through space and grabbed the one in front of him.

He couldn't do anything, and his face was trembling with fear and awe.

Taesan examined him. And he realized that something unusual was lodged in their minds.

"Brainwashing, huh."

It's not easy to gain their faith.

So, the immortals brainwashed them, forcing them to believe in themselves.

Then, the solution was simple.

Kiying!

A golden light burst out from Taesan. In an instant, the expanded golden space enveloped the entire city.

Zzzeojeojeo!

The worthless divine power that Keboruak had received was shattered to pieces using his own divinity.

Taesan unleashed his power just like that. The divine power that enveloped the city took root in the people.

"Ooh!"

"Aah!"

The power of Keboruak that had taken root in people's minds was destroyed.

"Uuh……."

"My head hurts……."

"Where is this place?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

People are in agony and regain their senses. They no longer see the same madness in each other's eyes. The leader's pupils enlarge.

"What is this?"

"It's those insignificant things that have become gods by spreading dirty things."

Taesan enters the city.

The people who have regained their senses look at Taesan one by one.

Taesan says to them,

"Follow me. You who have been oppressed and suffered."

At that moment, the sky trembles. A massive power begins to dwell in the sky.

The emotion of anger contained within it is something that everyone can feel.

It is the power of Keboruak.

People's faces turn pale. They cry out in fear.

"Oh, it's divine punishment!"

The condensed wind from the sky, like heavenly retribution, tramples the city.

It is the moment when people are prepared to face death.

Taesan raises his divinity. A golden power shoots up to the sky, blowing away the wind.

In an instant, the divinity pushes away the wind and creates a hole in the sky. The golden light that spreads across the sky illuminates the world in a magnificent way.

"I'll be right back. Just wait a little."

Taesan mutters to himself, facing the dispersing power of Keboruak.

"Ah……."

"Ah……."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the given Korean text to English:

"They gaze at Taesan as if they are mesmerized. Taesan moves forward.

'I will show you, I will make the world change for the better.'"

Note: Taesan is a proper noun, likely a person's name, and it's difficult to translate it accurately without more context.
