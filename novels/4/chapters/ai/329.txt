**Chapter 330**

**330. The World of the Destroyed Ghost (2)**

[After receiving recognition from the will of the world to save the world,

and passing the trials of those who have reached the center of the world,

and obtaining qualifications from the dragon dwelling in the deep valley,

and acquiring the root of the world tree in the elf's domain,

and retrieving the fragment of God in the sacred land,

I will finally obtain the weapon to defeat the Demon King.]

The ghost finished explaining and continued speaking.

[This is a pretty straightforward prophecy. If you fulfill all these conditions, you'll get the weapon to defeat the Demon King.]

"Did you fail to do it? Or did you do it but still lose?"

[The former.]

The ghost spoke gloomily.

Taesan pondered over the ghost's prophecy.

Before long, Bardley came to find Taesan. He sat down in a chair and opened his mouth.

"Now that I think about it, I didn't ask your name. You're a descendant of Kariat. What's your name?"

"It's Taesan."

"Taesan? That's a strange name. Is it a name for hiding and living in secret?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Bardley tilted his head and said,

"I am Bardley Alkerait, the rightful heir to the great empire and the successor to the throne."

Bardley was confident, with an attitude that seemed to boast of his own achievements.

"Let's confirm once again, Taesan. You came here to defeat the Demon King, didn't you?"

Taesan nodded, and Bardley's eyes narrowed.

"Then how much do you know?"

"I know about the prophecy and that the Demon King will soon appear."

"You know a lot. You're indeed a descendant of Kariat..."

Bardley's expression changed to one of surprise, and then he became serious and said,

"Yes. I don't know the exact timing, but the Demon King will soon appear. The fools of other kingdoms think it's not a big deal and live lazy lives, but our empire is different. We've been preparing for this for a long time."

The training of soldiers, understanding the contents of the prophecy, and identifying the location where the Demon King will appear... The empire had made sufficient preparations.

But there was still one crucial thing missing.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Demon King is an existence that destroys the world. And the one who defeats the Demon King is always the chosen hero."

Bardley gazed at Taesan and continued speaking quietly.

"Originally, I wanted to become the hero, but... my thoughts have changed. I will recommend you to His Majesty as the hero, with the qualifications to do so."

"Is that okay?"

Taesan was slightly surprised by Bardley's words.

The ghost he saw was not the type to yield his position to someone else. He didn't have the consideration and understanding to entrust his life to others.

But now, Bardley was yielding his position to Taesan.

Bardley spoke calmly.

"You are stronger than me. Overwhelmingly so."

In just one battle, Bardley realized that Taesan's power was something he couldn't win against, no matter how many hundreds of times he fought.

"It's only natural for the strong to obtain the qualifications. More than anything, don't you want to become the hero, shake off the oppression and contempt your bloodline receives, and gain recognition in the world?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I won't deny it."

"Then there won't be a problem. A weak person trying to take my place would only be laughed at."

Bardley smiled slyly and patted Taesan's shoulder.

"Alright, let's go. I'll go pay my respects to His Majesty."

* * *

Bardley walked confidently down the corridor. The maids and servants saw Taesan and were momentarily startled, but they immediately bowed their heads towards Bardley.

Absolute authority and power were on display. Bardley also seemed to take it for granted.

"You were always like that," Taesan muttered to the ghost standing next to him, who let out a faint snort.

[This is kind of embarrassing.]

After passing through the long corridor, Bardley arrived at the throne room.

He opened his mouth, facing the throne.

"Great Majesty, ruler of the empire. Your bloodline pays its respects."

"The stiff formalities are over. Look up. You, too, the one behind you."

Taesan raised his head and looked at the throne.

Two people were sitting on the chairs: a middle-aged man and a woman who looked slightly younger than him.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With a gaze filled with affection towards Bardley, the two of them could sense that Bardley was their child.

[……It's pitiful.]

The ghost murmured, its voice filled with emotions that couldn't be hidden.

But its voice didn't reach the two of them.

The Emperor looked down at Bardley and opened his mouth.

"So, Bardley. Are you saying you'll move to fulfill the prophecy?"

"It's not exactly me."

Bardley sent a gaze towards Taesan.

"He will become the hero."

"I've heard the story. The previous hero. The descendant of Kariat. I knew that his bloodline had survived, but I never thought it would still be maintained to this day……."

The Emperor looked at Taesan with a surprised face, but soon his eyes sank.

"I know you're strong, Bardley. But how can I believe you won't fall?"

Kariat defeated the Demon King, but fell to corruption. Even now, after many years, the horrific damage he left behind is still talked about.

It was a natural question if Taesan was really Kariat's descendant.

Taesan responded."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'm trying to convince you, but you won't accept it, will you? I'll just prove it with my own power."

"Hmm."

The emperor stroked his chin. He gazed at Taesan for a moment, then smiled faintly.

"As you like."

He slapped the armrest of his throne with his palm.

"If you had tried to package yourself poorly, I would have rejected you. There's nothing as worthless as someone else's words. What's important is power. Simple, but certain power."

Taesan, who had been preparing three proofs, thinking the emperor would refuse, hesitated.

The emperor nodded.

"So, I'll test your power. Come out."

Clank.

The knights who had been hiding behind the pillars appeared at once. The emperor clenched his fist.

"If you're truly as strong as Bardley's words, you should be able to win easily. Prove it."

Whoosh!

The knights charged at Taesan. Taesan dodged.

Clang!

Swords and shields pressed in on Taesan, as if trying to crush him. Dozens of people formed a perfect union, putting pressure on Taesan.

"It's okay."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With this level of power, I couldn't clear it, but I could descend into the labyrinth meaningfully. The overall strength of the world was higher than Arulia and Vesgeta.

But that was it.

The emperor's pupils, which had been watching, grew larger.

Taesan, who had been avoiding the attacks of dozens of knights with ease, without moving a single step, was staring at Bardley.

Bardley was looking at Taesan with an astonished face.

I had obtained the information from the prophecy. Since there was a ghost who knew the knowledge, there was no need to proceed with the quest alongside Bardley.

However, the reward for this quest changed according to the emotions of the owner of the destroyed world.

The god of regret, Legrite, didn't simply want to defeat the demon king.

He wanted to proceed with the story together with Bardley by his side.

Then, it would be beneficial for him as well.

Taesan pointed his finger at the shield that was charging at him head-on.

With a ripping sound, the knight was blown away. The impact caused other knights to stumble and crash into the wall.

"...Cough."

The knight whose shield had been touched by Taesan's finger spat out blood.

His shield had been completely destroyed and had turned into a scrap metal lump."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is this enough?"

"......Hah!"

The emperor, who had been gazing intensely, suddenly stood up.

"You've rendered the empire's proud knights powerless with just one finger! That's incredible!"

He applauded, his face beaming with joy.

"Well done! You're a descendant of Kariat! You've earned the empire's recognition. We'll call you a hero and spread your achievements far and wide."

* * *

After that, the emperor grasped Taesan's hand and asked him all sorts of questions.

How did he acquire his power, where did he come from, what did he encounter, and what did he defeat?

Like a noble eager to hear an adventure story, he asked numerous questions, making Taesan struggle to answer them all.

Taesan, who was finally released, muttered to himself.

"It seems more harmonious than I thought."

While the emperor asked Taesan various questions, Bardley also continued to chat beside them.

The woman who seemed to be his mother also sent him a warm gaze, suggesting a good relationship between family members.

This was unexpected for Taesan.

"I thought you'd be cold towards each other, considering you killed your brothers."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What's going on? Did you remember?"

The ghost said it had six brothers, and that it had killed them all.

The ghost spoke.

"The Cabert Empire extremely values power. Here, those with noble bloodlines kill their brothers to gain qualifications, it's only natural."

"That's amazing."

From the Earth's perspective, it was an unacceptable story.

"Did you have any regrets?"

"There was none. I was overwhelmingly stronger than them. Just... as they were dying, they told me to make the Empire immortal and grant it immense power."

However, the Empire was destroyed before the ghost became the emperor.

The energy emanating from the ghost grew even more intense.

An hour later, Bardley visited Taesan.

"Are you going to hold a ball?"

Taesan asked, and Bardley nodded.

"Yes. It will be held in an hour, so please attend."

"...... Is it really necessary to do so?"

Taesan had received the emperor's recognition. He wanted to quickly proceed with the prophecy, but Bardley denied Taesan's words.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There is a need. What is the first condition of prophecy?"

"It was to receive recognition from the world's will to save the world."

"That will is at the bottom of this palace."

Bardley pointed to the floor with his finger.

"A powerful force has been sealed away for a very long time. We need time to release it."

"Is that so."

Bardley gazed at Taesan for a moment, then placed his hand on Taesan's shoulder.

"You seem worried."

"What do you mean?"

"Are you worried that the people at the party will see you and feel negative emotions?"

Thinking about it, Taesan was currently set as a descendant of Kariat. It was natural to be afraid of standing in front of people.

Bardley seemed to be saying that.

"Don't worry. You have great power."

Bardley spread his arms wide.

"This is the great empire of Kavert. Unlike other kingdoms, we don't pay attention to trivial things and worship power. Your ancestors or your bloodline are not important."

He smiled faintly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Be confident. Recognize your worth and don't hide it. That's what you need to do."

With those words, Bardley dragged Taesan to the ballroom.

There, Bardley said, "I am a descendant of Kariat," but he had immense power and acknowledged it himself.

Indeed, as he said, the people at the ball didn't ignore or fear Taesan.

On the contrary, they struggled to shake off the noble ladies who were flocking to him.

If Taesan was truly a descendant of Kariat and had been oppressed, he would have been deeply impressed by Bardley.

Taesan stepped out of the ballroom and was taking a break on the terrace.

Bardley approached him.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes, thank you for your concern."

"What's that? If you're happy, that's all that matters."

Bardley swirled his wine.

"Those with power should be treated with respect. There's no need to get caught up in petty details. That's what I've always said."

"I see."

Taesan listened silently to Bardley's words.

At that moment, a faint noise approached.

"Your Highness Bardley, are you here?"

"Yes."

Bardley's face changed in an instant.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The darkness had brightened to the point where it could be seen.

[Ah.]

The ghost let out a sigh.

The person who approached was a woman. She wore a white dress, had luxuriant golden hair, and possessed sparkling blue eyes like precious jewels.

She was a beauty that shone like light.

And when the woman appeared, the ghost's emotions, which had never wavered even when seeing its family, began to fluctuate.

Bardley laughed.

"Levancia. You also participated in the ball, didn't you?"

"I couldn't refuse when the king called me."

The woman called Levancia covered her mouth and laughed. She looked at Taesan with a curious expression.

"Is he the descendant of Kariat who caused a commotion this time?"

"That's right."

"Nice to meet you."

Levancia grasped the hem of her dress and greeted Taesan.

"I am Levancia Coriejei, a noble of the great Kavert Empire and the fiancée of the person standing next to you."

Levancia smiled brightly.

And the ghost stared at her blankly.

Note: Please let me know if you need any further assistance or clarification on any part of the translation!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

After the ball, Taesan returned to his room.

During that time, the ghost didn't say a word.

Until Levancia left, he silently gazed at her.

The silent time continued. The next day, Bardley came with an ambiguous expression.

"I'm sorry, but it's going to take a little more time. The imperial wizards can't lift the seal."

"Can you guide me there?"

"If you want to."

Taesan followed Bardley's guidance to the underground of the imperial palace. There, numerous wizards were sweating profusely in front of a massive magic circle.

"Ah, Your Highness the Prince."

"What's going on?"

"......I don't want to admit it, but the wizards of the past were better than us."

The wizard bit his lip in frustration.

"The understanding necessary for lifting the magic seal is blocked. I apologize, but it will take some time."

"I see."

Bardley didn't blame them.

He silently accepted the situation and began to tidy things up.

"It's no use blaming the lack of ability. We might need to call upon those who have secured their position at the center of the world."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But will they come to the empire...?"

"They are also part of the prophecy. They won't refuse to fulfill the prophecy, just like us. It's just that it will take some time."

"There's no need for that."

Taesan stood in front of the magic circle. He raised his hand, and the watching mage was shocked.

"Don't touch that carelessly!"

Kyiiiing!

A backlash occurred, pushing Taesan away.

The magic circle, which rejected and tried to eliminate those who approached, sent a thick, murderous intent towards Taesan.

Taesan activated his skill.

[You have activated magic cancellation.]

Kaang!

The magic circle shattered and fell apart. Taesan shook off his hand, and the mages who were trying to stop him froze, their eyes wide open.

Taesan spoke calmly.

"It's done now."
