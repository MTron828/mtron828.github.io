20. 2nd Floor, God of Struggle and Death. Laki Ratas (5)

The knight presses on like a storm. Taesan barely manages to block the swinging sword.

Clang!

At the moment their swords clash, the knight's wrist shakes. The blade descends, aiming to cut Taesan's wrist.

Taesan hurriedly tries to create distance, but the weapon sticks to him like adhesive.

"Oof!"

[You receive 20 damage.]

His forearm is slashed. Taesan swings the sword forcefully to shake it off and checks his arm's condition.

"No issues."

His muscles and bones are unharmed. It stings a bit, but it's not an injury that would affect the battle.

"What's this?"

He's surprised.

What the hell is that? It's skill. Truly, it's the swordsmanship of a knight trained systematically.

Taesan has never seen such skill. Most players called accumulated combat experience weapon skill, but they didn't possess something as sophisticated as the knight before them.

That was true for Taesan as well.
All of his techniques are haphazard swordsmanship without any formal training, learned through real combat experience. He moves based on his accumulated experience. He's unsure how to deal with this unfamiliar type.

The knight swings his sword. Taesan meets it roughly. The clash of swords echoes loudly.

The knight presses on. Taesan tries to redirect the force to counterattack, but is lightly overwhelmed as the knight sweeps him aside.

[You receive 11 damage.]

"Wow."

Now admiration escapes him.

It's his own weapon in his hand, yet he feels like he has no control. Despite experiencing many battles, he hadn't thought much of skills, but his perspective has changed now.

To think such extremes are possible with skill. It was a fact he didn't know. The knight before him is an opponent where the answer isn't in the sword, and even after thousands of clashes, he can't figure out how to win.

"I want to learn."

Taesan murmurs.

Greed is evident in his eyes.

* * *

Every action in the labyrinth is evaluated, and if it surpasses a certain level, it is labeled as a skill.

The swordsmanship before him has exceeded that line. Surely it must be a skill. At the very least, an advanced skill.

I want to learn it.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"If I learn that swordsmanship, I can overcome many obstacles he anticipated.

Although I'm planning to acquire many skills, swordsmanship isn't among them. Like an unsatisfied Scrooge, I greedily aim for the knight. Momentarily retreating due to deep longing and desire.

"You're good with the sword. I'll admit that."

He's the player. The one who breaks through the labyrinth.

"But that's not all there is to it."

He has skills.

Up until now, the picture was always of the knight attacking and Taesan retreating. Given the clear difference in swordsmanship, it was natural.

But this time, Taesan charged forward. Instead of a sword, a red staff was in his hand.

[You activated Fireball.]

A red sphere flies. Taesan immediately changed his weapon to a sword. Following right after the fireball, he rushed towards the knight. The knight swung his sword downward.

Fwoosh.

The fireball disappears as it is cut by the sword. Taking advantage of the sword's descent, Taesan swung the sword in his left hand.

[6 damage to Rocky Lattice's descendants.] [You activated Breathless Attack. You gain freedom of breath for the next 10 seconds.]
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"He immediately thrusts the sword in his right hand. The same 6 damage is dealt.

The knight corrects his posture and thrusts the sword. Taesan does not block. Instead, he rushes towards the sword. If he had stayed still, Taesan's head would have been perfectly pierced.

[You triggered a dodge. The next attack is evaded.]

As the sword reaches Taesan's head, the trajectory twists. It forcibly tries to avoid hitting Taesan.

The bewildered knight desperately pulls the sword, but it doesn't listen.

The sword grazes Taesan's shoulder.

[You receive 15 damage.]

The knight's body is drawn towards the sword, which is out of his control. Taesan roughly moves the sword towards the knight, who is now completely defenseless.

[6 damage to Rocky Lattice's descendants.] [5 damage to Rocky Lattice's descendants.] [...]..

In less than two seconds, he struck six times. With the breathless attack, he could attack without adjusting his pace.

Boom!

The knight flicks his foot to knock down Taesan. Taesan smoothly retreats backwards, swinging through the air, and kneeing him.

In his hand was a red cane."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"[You activated Fireball.]"

A crimson sphere emerges into the air. The knight tries to block, but this time it was too close.

[13 damage to Rocky Lattice's descendants.] [Burn judgment in progress......] [Judgment successful! Rocky Lattice's descendants are now burned.]

"Good."

I didn't know what would happen with the armor, but I succeeded in the burn judgment at once. The knight began to take continuous damage.

Clang!

The knight didn't lose sight of the target. He rushed towards Taesan and swung his sword. It was like a bull's charge. If it hit head-on, Taesan would have no chance.

So there was no intention of taking it.

"[You triggered dodge. The next attack is dodged.]"

Miss.

The sword forcibly alters its trajectory. The knight seems determined not to be hit this time, exerting even stronger force. Essentially at full power. If it had hit directly, the remaining health would have been gone in one blow contained in the sword.

But it misses.

The sword grazes past Taesan's chest.

[11 damage to you.]

Skills are absolute power in the labyrinth.

Dodge is a technique to evade the opponent's attack.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Even if Ainz Ooal Gown were to deliver a blow that shatters mountains, it would be avoided. Unless countered with a superior skill, there is no way to block it.

The sword twists and the knight's body is exposed. Taesan moves the sword.

[You activated Breathless Attack. You gain freedom of breath for the next 12 seconds.]

6. 6. 5. 5. 6.

[You attacked the opponent consecutively. You acquired the special activation skill [Consecutive Attack].]

Along with a long damage window, the skill acquisition window appeared.

"When will you die?"

There's no way a human form has higher health than a giant rat. However, the knight showed no signs of dying.

Almost all mana has been used.

Intelligence reduces consumption, but at the level of the 20s, it is not significant. The remaining mana is barely about 5. One or two more skills would be the end.

And Taesan's remaining health is 71.

There's nowhere to retreat. Taesan digs deeper and thrusts the sword.

[5 damage to Rocky Lattice's descendants.]

The knight raises the sword. Kneeling, he strikes down Formelo Taesan.

[You triggered Counter. You retaliate against the next opponent's attack.]
Here is the translation of the text into English:

His body moves automatically. He dodges Formelo's descending strike. He directs the sword towards the knight's power. Using both hands, he drives them into the knight's neck one by one.

[22 damage to Rocky Lattice's descendant.] [21 damage to Rocky Lattice's descendant.]

But he doesn't die. The knight swings at Taesan.

"Urgh!"

Taesan grits his teeth. If he gets hit this time, there will really be no answer. By forcibly giving strength to his stomach and enduring the outcome, he did not retreat.

Taesan wildly swings his sword. The knight's armor begins to show signs of damage.

The knight also doesn't stay still. The sword draws a diagonal line. Taesan bows his body to avoid it. Bending down almost to the ground, he uses that force to stab under the knight's neck. The helmet breaks.

A pale face is revealed.

Although he had a fairly handsome appearance, there was no time to calmly appreciate it.

Taesan thrusts the sword towards the head. The knight also counters, stabbing Taesan's abdomen.

Taesan deflects it with his remaining sword. Due to lack of strength, he couldn't perfectly deflect it, but he managed to barely evade a direct hit.

[32 damage to you.] [15 damage to Rocky Lattice's descendant.]

He drives it into the neck once more. The knight retaliates.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

This time, he doesn't evade.

The sword pierces Taesan's chest.

[65 damage to you.] [Your Endurance has activated. The deadly attack has been nullified. All damage is reduced to 0 for 1 second.]

Endurance.

Nullification of all damage. This is the last one.

[16 damage to Rocky Lattice's descendant.] [15 damage to Rocky Lattice's descendant.]

In an instant, the knight's armor shatters. Life returns to his face. Regaining his composure, the descendant smiles faintly towards Taesan. His lips twitched.

"It was a good match. Brave one."

Taesan felt the knight said that.

The image of the knight disperses into mist, rising towards the ceiling of the labyrinth. Gradually, the landscape of the maze returns to its original state.

[You have triumphed over Rocky Lattice's descendant.] [Rocky Lattice is greatly satisfied.]

"Satisfaction is bullshit."

Taesan clicks his tongue. The knight, once rational again, was truly strong. His mana was restored, but his health was barely holding on.

"Where's the sudden change of quests? Aren't you just a rascal?"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Itaeyeon had once said that the gods were all shameless. Taesan felt he understood a bit of the reason why. He nervously checked the system window that had been turned off.

[You have emerged victorious against the descendant of Rocky Lattice.]

[Received a massive amount of experience points.] [Health has been restored by 30.] [Obtained 253 gold.] [You have triumphed solo against a formidable foe. Strength permanently increases by 2. Agility permanently increases by 2. Mana permanently increases by 2.] [Your Determination Rise has activated. Strength permanently increases by 4. Agility permanently increases by 3.] [Your level has increased.] [Reached the optimal state.] [As a reward for leveling up, health has increased by 25.] [As a reward for leveling up, Strength permanently increases by 3. Agility permanently increases by 3. Mana permanently increases by 3. Health permanently increases by 5.]

"Ha,"

Taesan let out a hollow laugh. The surge in stats was beyond belief.

"Just a simple calculation, and my stats alone increase by 17? Health by 30 and mana by 5? That's no joke."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

It was clear to Taesan what kind of opponent the descendant of Rocky Lattice was. In Taesan's estimation, facing this foe on the 15th floor or higher in Normal mode wouldn't be surprising at all. Just by seeing the experience bar completely empty and leveling up right away, he could tell.

"Status window."

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 6] [Health: 190/190] [Mana: 22/22] [Strength: 27] [Intelligence: 25] [Agility: 40] [Attack +5] [Defense +2] [In optimal condition.]

His stats suddenly ballooned. He couldn't help but chuckle at the endlessly increasing numbers.

"No equipment... huh."

Regret tinged Taesan's expression. The weapons and armor used by the knight were both overwhelmingly powerful. He hadn't expected the quest monster to drop equipment, but it was disappointing nonetheless.

A reward awaited him to soothe that disappointment.

[You have overcome the trial of Rocky Lattice. Based on Rocky Lattice's evaluation, you are rewarded.] [Rocky Lattice is greatly satisfied with your struggle. Rocky Lattice wishes to give you a fitting reward.]

"Satisfaction my ass."

Who changes the quest details so suddenly? One small mistake would have meant death.
In Taesan's heart, animosity towards Rocky Lattice began to grow. Whether Rocky Lattice knew it or not, it started processing the rewards.

[Rocky Lattice's interference zone has decreased.] [Rocky Lattice rewards you. You have received [Rocky Lattice's Ritual Knife].] [You have cleared an enhanced trial. Additional rewards follow.] [You have obtained the special passive skill [Proof of Struggle].] [Rocky Lattice proposes a covenant to you.]
