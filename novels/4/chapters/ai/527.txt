**Chapter 528**

**528. 95th Floor. Essence (2)**

Taesan looked around. It was a world of dust that barely maintained its form, where nothing could be felt.

"Is this your planet?"

"It was once. It was radiant, filled with those who served me. My apostles protected the planet from the outside, and my blessings covered the planet. It was a place filled with happiness and joy, without a single sorrowful person."

But it was a story from a very distant, long-forgotten past. Now, this place was completely dead.

"It's pitiful."

Essential wore a bitter smile. The countless mortals who had served him. The apostles he had personally baptized. They had all disappeared without him noticing. How many times had they cried out his name as they vanished? Thinking about it made his heart ache.

But it was already a past event.

Essential's face became calm.

"There's not a single mortal who remembers me. It's a strange feeling."

"Are you sad?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not sad. But, well, gods gather too. Disciples are the same. It's natural for people to gather around a great person. That part is not a problem."

Essential smiled faintly.

Essential was different from Levinovna, the god of Akasha. Essential was a god who governed concepts themselves. To him, the faith of mortals was only a secondary aspect.

If one wanted, they could gather faith and strengthen their divinity at any time. There was no problem with that.

"By the way, it's already come to this. I told the wizard, but I thought it would take a lot of time."

"Is this the place?"

Essential had said that to see the essence, an altar and a shrine were necessary. But it was uncertain whether they would be managed or whether mortals would remain.

This planet seemed to be the one with the altar and shrine.

"It doesn't look like much, but is it still remaining?"

"It's my sacred relic. As long as I don't disappear, it won't rust or decay with the flow of time. But... it has collapsed."

Essential kicked the ground. Dust flew everywhere, revealing the surroundings.

In the vast sight of Taesan, numerous pillars and decorations scattered on the ground came into view.

"As you can see, it's in this state. Won't you help me a little?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Do you need my help?"

"This is my altar and shrine. It's a building for myself. In other words, if I make it myself, the meaning of the altar and shrine will be distorted."

"Is that a problem too?"

"Someone else made it for me. Or did I make it for myself? Or did I make it for those who serve me? Depending on each of those, many things you touch will change, so it's good to be aware of that."

"I see."

The conclusion was that Taesan had to make the altar and shrine himself. Essential smiled faintly.

"I'll explain, so take your time and make it. Ah, by the way, you have to use your physical body to make it directly. If you use your abilities, the meaning will be distorted."

"This is quite troublesome."

"That's the way concepts are born at the end of such trouble."

In any case, the altar and shrine were necessary to understand the essence. Taesan picked up the pillar.

It wasn't that difficult. With Essential's advice, Taesan slowly began to make the altar and shrine.

"You seem to be worried."

As the shrine was being built, Essential asked Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Have you thought a bit more about yourself?"

"Somewhat."

Taesan lifted a pillar and swung it. A pillar larger than a mountain was lightly lifted and slammed into the ground.

Taesan grew stronger and gained many experiences. Even in easy mode, he didn't return to his original state, but he fought against Goshin and won.

And through that process, he learned many things about himself.

"There's something inside me."

What was half-doubt had now become conviction.

"And that's probably related to Goshin's existence."

Taesan felt unease in easy mode, and a sense of familiarity. Easy mode was a place created by Goshin. There was no reason for him to feel a sense of closeness.

He defeated the gatekeeper, and something happened inside him. It was as if he had stolen the gatekeeper's power, saying it was originally his own.

And then, forced arrival.

At that time, there was no blackness inside him. What was left after gathering everything to the bottom was only a fragment that couldn't take shape.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Forced arrival is impossible, and it's not something that can be achieved. Originally, black wouldn't have flowed out. Taesan expected that and was about to use a different method.

But black did flow out.

More than he expected, and thicker too.

It was as if something entirely different inside him had been pulled out.

"You want to know the essence, ultimately because you want to know it."

"That's correct."

Taesan replied and continued building. The shape was gradually becoming complete.

Essential, who had been staring at Taesan, opened his mouth.

"I saw what's inside you."

Taesan's body froze. Essential continued speaking calmly.

"I'm sorry to say this, but I couldn't help my curiosity. I tried to see your essence without you noticing. I'm sorry."

"......It's fine."

It was pointless to get angry, and it was also half-expected. The god of essence wouldn't be unaware of his own essence.

Anyway, Essential was bound to find out naturally, so Taesan didn't mind.

"Thanks. Anyway, I was curious about what you said. About your existence."

It's clear that you exist in this world."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But you can harness the power beyond, merge it, and create a distorted concept.

Taesan was an enigmatic existence to Essential. That's why he couldn't help but try to peek into his inner self.

"But something inside you chased me away."

Taesan's eyebrows twitched.

"Your inner self was twisted. It was broken and distorted. And there was something inside. It was trying to read my inner self, regardless of your will, and rejected me."

Kuuuuung!

The altar and the sacred place began to take shape.

"I don't know what's inside you, but at least it's not related to your will. If you had noticed, you could have chased me away and read my essence. Because it's ultimately your essence. Others can't see it carelessly. But it wasn't you who chased me away."

There was something else inside Taesan.

"What does that mean?"

"......I don't know."

"It means that what's inside you has the power to chase me away."

Taesan gazed at Essential. His piercing gaze, which saw through to the essence, was directed at Taesan.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The God of Essence. Only the owner of the original can block Essential from reading their inner self. It's impossible for anyone else.

For that to be possible, the other person would have to be on the same level as the God of Essence or be an even higher existence.

Kuuuuung!

The last piece has been put in place.

"It's complete."

Essential stood up from its seat.

"Then let's start."

* * *

Essential entered the inner sanctum. In the middle, a mirror the size of a person floated in mid-air.

"I am the God of Essence. I govern the concept of the universe's essence itself. Even if a transcendent being shows me their own essence, I can see everything."

This was a concept given to Essential. A transcendent being who governs the concept of essence naturally has the power to do so.

"But you can't."

The tip of the finger points to the distant mountains.

"You can't read it in that way. There's something heterogeneous within you. That denies my intervention. As much as it's dormant within you, I can't forcefully resolve it either."

"......Then?"

"That's why we need the altar and the sanctum."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Essence applauds. The altar, which had been dormant for a long time, begins to operate according to the owner's will.

Kiiiiing!

"I cannot solve your essence for you. I can only provide a place and possibilities. What's inside you and how it relates to you is for you to figure out yourself."

Thud.

Fingers snap. The altar and the shrine resonate, amplifying Essence's power.

"What I'm about to do to you is similar to the trials I gave to my apostles. You must vomit out your inner thoughts and shatter the turmoil in your mind. Of course, you won't have such turmoil."

For beings who have transcended, there is no such thing as turmoil about themselves. Even if they have reached a high level of enlightenment through faith, it's almost impossible for them to transcend.

"What you need to shatter is your inner thoughts."

"……."

Taesan's eyes sank. Essence clenched its fist.

"Place the mirror on your back, relax your entire body, and don't resist."

The power contained in the fist envelops Taesan.

At the same time, Taesan's true essence is revealed to the world.

Kuuuuung!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was enormous. An enormous, world-encompassing imagination burst forth, too big to be contained in one world. And it was sucked into the mirror.

"Hmm."

Essential's face stiffened. It was bigger and thicker than he had expected. Essential swiftly swung his hand. In an instant, the interior of the mirror expanded hundreds of times.

Thick and dense, something unseen in this world was being sucked into the mirror.

Taesan felt a strange sensation. It was as if his own was being pulled out from the outside.

And at that moment.

[That's enough.]

A voice echoed. This time, Taesan could hear it clearly.

A languid, yet greedy voice. It was also tired and worn out, like an old man's voice.

Ka-ching.

Blackness exploded, trying to sweep away everything in its path. It was trampling and crushing the inner self that was being expelled.

"Hahaha!"

And Essential welcomed it with a crazy laugh.

"It's come out! Something unknown! I was defeated before, but not now!"

Essential raised both fists and swung them.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

It was the power to dominate the very essence. It was crushing and suppressing the distorted thing that was resisting in harmony with the sacred place.

"Be still and obey!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Essential grasped both hands and slapped them together. He perfectly crushed the resistance and put it into the mirror.

"Whoa!"

Essential turned his hands with a refreshed face.

"It's all tidy now. I've been bothered by it since last time."

"......It's strange."

It was a feeling of emptiness inside. Something that had filled him up had disappeared.

"All your thoughts are inside that mirror. If you want, you can retrieve them anytime. That is, if there's no interference."

Taesan gazed at the mirror.

It was filled with a grayish color. Essential nodded.

"Go in. And check with your own eyes what's inside you. And what you're made of."

Taesan took a step forward. The mirror swallowed Taesan's body.
