Chapter 285

285. 62nd Floor (2)

[Taesun Kang[Alone] : So, how's it going?] [Oliver Cannon[Hard] : Everyone is making an effort, but... it's not easy.]

After Taesun told the leaders of each country about the skills, they spread the word to the players about how to obtain the skills.

Skills such as the ability to make quick movements without taking a breath during battle, and the determination to continue fighting even after being injured.

Since each skill was extremely valuable, many players made an effort to obtain the skills.

However, it was not an easy task.

[Ichijo Eika[Hard] : We haven't learned much.] [Oliver Cannon[Hard] : We're similar. Although there are rumors that some people have obtained skills, it's extremely rare. It's not like the US is saying it's easy.]

As expected, Taesun gazed at the community without changing his expression.
Here is the translation of the text:

At first, even the most basic attack couldn't be obtained. No matter how many times I faced the brink of death, choosing to die was a completely different issue.

Amelia suddenly spoke up. The mountain-like person, Kang Tae-san, smiled slightly.

Kang Tae-san: "Really? You're fast. You're still Amelia, after all." Amelia Erina: "Shh, don't make a noise."

It was a short conversation, but I could sense a hidden emotion. I started to wonder how to deal with Amelia.

Kang Tae-san: "It's good to get out of the labyrinth as quickly as possible, but it's even more important to fully understand it. If you go down once, you won't be able to get what you can only get there. You have to get everything you can get and then go down." Amelia Erina: "I understand. ...I'm grateful." Kang Jun-hyeok: "Ah, older brother. I have something to ask. Are there any skills that change into ability sockets that you taught us?"

Kang Tae-san: "Yes. The skills for jumping and landing also change."

Kang Tae-san shared a lot of information. In the middle, Lee Tae-yeon also joined in and got information from Kang Tae-san about solo mode and skills.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the conversation was coming to an end, Amelia suddenly asked, "Have you reached the bottom yet?"

[Amelia: Where have you reached so far?] [Gang Tae-san: 62 floors.] [Amelia: ...Almost reached the bottom.] [Kang Jun-hyeok: Oh......] [Lee Tae-yeon: That doesn't make sense.] [Kim Jung-geun: Wait a minute. When did you reach the 62nd floor?]

The community suddenly became noisy. Tae-san gave a rough answer and closed the community.

"What's the matter with this speed?"

Tae-san was too fast.

At this speed, it would have been possible to clear the labyrinth around the time Lee Tae-yeon reached the bottom.

For now, it was a useless concern. It was unclear how much time it would take to reach the bottom in the labyrinth. But it seemed better to prepare in advance.

Tae-san took a step.

As he walked through the narrow path blocked by walls on both sides, he saw multiple paths diverging.

"Ah, the 60th floor is indeed unique."

The 62nd floor quest was different from the other floors. The sentence read, "Clear the labyrinth and defeat the owner of the labyrinth."

As expected.

The 62nd floor was a labyrinth.
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have activated the region detection of Leraaji.]

Magi flowed along a narrow path. It informed Tai Shan about the information of the maze.

There were multiple paths. From there, multiple tens of paths branched out, and then multiple hundreds of paths branched out again.

Among them, Tai Shan checked the blocked paths and moved on.

Tai Shan had been exploring the maze for two days.

"It's really vast."

It was not a slow pace. Although it's a process of breaking through the maze without encountering enemies, and only finding paths through reconnaissance and region detection, the destination was still not in sight.

As Tai Shan continued on the path, another path that branched out into tens of paths appeared again.

[You have activated reconnaissance.] [Blocked path] [Blocked path] [Path that may be blocked] [Unblocked path] [Blocked path]

The reconnaissance did not reveal all the information, so it was necessary to find a path leading to the tunnel while using Leraaji's region detection in conjunction.

[The proficiency of reconnaissance increased by 1%. The proficiency of Leraaji's region detection increased by 1%.]

"It's not bad."
Here is the translation of the text:

The combat skills of the scout, which had been stagnant, could be significantly improved.

The 61st floor is a place where the overall strength of the adventurer who has descended until now is tested. And the 62nd floor is a place that tests the adventurer's ability to break through, scout, and analyze abilities.

[The deeper you go, the more diverse it becomes. It really requires a lot of abilities. Even I, who haven't reached the 90th floor, can sense it. The 60th floor is a place where you can grasp these abilities.]

The ghost said:

[While all floors of the 60th floor are not like this, there are quite a few unique floors.]

[You have activated the zone detection of Rera.]

I can read the path.

By excluding blocked paths and gradually reducing the number of possibilities, the combat skills of the scout can be significantly improved.

[The combat skills of the scout have increased by 1%. Special skill: Scout [Level: 60%] [Evolved form of scout. Can gather a lot of information about the target.]]

As the skills increase, the sentence changes, and now it can be understood that many information can be obtained.

[You have activated the scout.

 Blocked path] [Blocked path] [Blocked path]

[The Path to the Corridor]

"I found it."

Taesan walked towards the corridor.

A ghostly cry echoed.

[The reconnaissance has already reached 60%.]

The ghost had also evolved its reconnaissance to obtain it. However, it was still stuck at around 50% in terms of reconnaissance proficiency.

Taesan's reconnaissance proficiency was incredibly fast, even considering the help of points.

"Ah, it's true. There are hardly any who can fully understand and tackle this labyrinth like this one."

The level of proficiency was not simply a matter of using the skill a lot. The speed of level advancement also depended on how efficiently the skill was used and how well its effects were led.

It was a natural consequence, then.

Taesan advanced through the maze without obstruction. He continued to activate his reconnaissance to find the secret room. The reward was a black magic staff, which he planned to give to the demon. After obtaining the reward, Taesan broke through again.

"At this rate, even if I get stuck in an infinite maze, I can still escape without a problem."
Here is the translation of the text:

The ghost thought about the one floor that could barely be cleared just before dying. Not long after, Taesan arrived at the entrance of the tunnel.

"Uoooo!"

[You met the owner of the maze.]

The owner of the maze was a monster of the Somerian. Taesan drew his sword and rushed forward.

"Uoooo!"

The Somerian monster swung its axe with both hands and charged towards Taesan.

Taesan swung his sword.

Kaang!

The monster, several times larger than Taesan, was repelled by the force and flew back. Taesan continued to dash forward, striking the axe and piercing his chest.

"Uoooo!"

Even after reaching the 60th floor, there was no change. The monsters in the ordinary maze were no match for Taesan. The monster soon collapsed.

[Your level has risen.] [Your spiritual power has surged.] [You have cleared the 62nd floor.] [You have obtained Athena's Scarlet Cuff.] [You have obtained ???.] [Athena's Scarlet Cuff] [Strength + 200] [Attack power + 120] [Defense power + 200] [A cuff used by the goddess of war when she descended to the earth. The blessing of a weak god is bestowed upon it.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"It had good stats, high attack power, and defense. It was a great equipment."

"[I used it.] [I obtained a pure magic book of pure magic.] [The pure magic book is a collection of pure magic, and the magic contained within is beyond human comprehension.]"

"Ah."

It was good. It would be perfect if I exchanged it for something.

Tai Shan reached the 61st floor. After clearing the 62nd floor, the maze disappeared, leaving only a vast space, so there was no problem.

There was a Relis and a bewildered Bellnecia in that place.

"Ah, Tai Shan!"

"Uh? Do you know who I am?"

Tai Shan looked at Relis, who turned pale at the sight, and Bellnecia asked. Tai Shan replied:

"It's a relationship where we help each other while moving through the labyrinth."

"...Ah. So that's a contract? I thought it was strange that such a weak person came all the way here, but I understand now."

Bellnecia, who had figured out the situation, showed no special interest in Relis. However, Relis was looking at Bellnecia with sparkling eyes.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Waaaah……."

"What are you doing?"

"You're a magician who has learned intermediate magic and gone all the way down to the depths, aren't you? You're my idol!"

Relis smiled satisfactorily.

"It seems that our agreement was correct."

"Good. Then, can you handle this?"

Tae-san handed over the staff and magic book. Relis received it quickly and prepared to offer sacrifices.

She closed her eyes and prayed. The gods of magic took the sacrifices.

"Ah?"

Belkniya, who was watching from a distance, lit up her eyes.

After a while, Relis opened her eyes.

"There are quite a lot of sacrifices... If I can bring just one more equipment like this, I can learn intermediate magic."

Tae-san nodded his head. Belkniya spoke up to Tae-san, who was about to go back into the labyrinth.

"How did you learn intermediate magic, then? You're making a way for that kid to learn, aren't you?"

"Yes."

"Of course. The gods of magic are merciful to those who trust themselves. That kid has that kind of trust... "
Here is the translation of the text:

Baelbek's gaze was fascinating towards Relic. He approached Relic and spoke to him, and although Relic was at a loss for what to say, he opened his mouth.

At least, it didn't seem like it would be an uncomfortable relationship. Tae-san went back down the labyrinth.

[Start of 63rd floor quest.] [Defeat the boss of the 63rd floor.] [Reward: Magubania's Red Boots.] [Secret reward: ??]

Tae-san started the 63rd floor strategy. The 63rd floor was unlike anything he had seen before, except that it was a bit larger. It was an ordinary labyrinth.

The monsters that appeared were giant black crows. Tae-san didn't know what connection they had to the gatekeeper, but they scattered their feathers, obstructing his field of vision, and attacked with their beaks.

Quack.

It wasn't difficult to fight against them, so Tae-san advanced.

As he went further, Tae-san discovered an altar.

*[You have discovered the altar of pride.]*

Ohman. It was a name that was remembered. He was also the god who had tested Tae-san on the 8th floor.

The god of trials. Ohman.

The altar was radiating power towards Tae-san.

"Let's see each other again."

[Have you come this way? It's rare for the altar to change.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Yu-ryeong-do muttered to himself, "I don't often have to deal with such things." As Taesan approached the altar, the system window appeared.

[Sub-quest start] [Oman wants to test you, who has come to his altar. If you accept, trials will come to you. If you overcome them, rewards will follow.] [Reward: Oman will decide according to your achievements.]

Familiar system.

Taesan nodded his head.

[Sub-quest start] [Oman is preparing for your choice.]

Taesan felt a massive power approaching and thought, "What's going on this time?"

Oman is the god of trials. When I met him, the trial I underwent was to confirm the level of strength I had reached.

I think it's similar this time, and Taesan prepared.

Kuuuung!

[Start of maze change] [A great will is shaking the maze.]

Kung!

The maze is trembling. Taesan lowered his posture. It seemed like an earthquake was occurring in the maze, and it was rocking back and forth.

"This is it."

Taesan narrowed his eyes.

The maze was flipping over.

A massive power was starting to twist everything.

Kugukugug...

The building collapsed like a house of cards, and everything was crumbling and falling apart. Taesan lowered his posture even further to stabilize his center.

Kugukugug...
Here is the translation of the text:

As the commotion subsided, Tai Shan lifted his head.

The scenery of the labyrinth had changed.

The stone walls had vanished, leaving only a space filled with thick, black, sticky liquid. The floor was also covered with the liquid.

Tai Shan put his strength into his feet.

Splorch.

The sticky liquid splashed out with a strong rebound, pushing Tai Shan's feet back.

"I'll find it hard to move."

Tai Shan took a deep breath. The air had also changed. The stale air was pressing down on Tai Shan.

"It's definitely different."

The changes in the labyrinth were familiar to Tai Shan, who had experienced them in his previous trials with the god of victory, Balta Zaha.

However, this was different.

This was not the 63rd layer.

[Wow... Did I really...?]

The ghost's voice trailed off. His voice was filled with astonishment.

[I never thought I'd bring this...]

"Where are we?"

Tai Shan pressed against the wall. The sticky liquid splashed out. As Tai Shan moved, he muttered to himself.

"This feels like the inside of my life."

[Right.]

"What?"
(Note: There are some unclear or ambiguous parts in the text, and the translation may not be perfect. Additionally, the story seems to be a part of a larger narrative, so the context may not be fully understood without more background information.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"I've heard about this before. I haven't seen it myself, but it's still stuck in my memory. I heard it's disappeared now......"

"Where is it?"

"Previous 71st floor."

The mountain stopped suddenly. A ghost burst out laughing.

"If I brought this, I'd bring this kind of thing. It's probably divine."

"Explain it in detail."

"Just as I said. I was probing the depths and knew what I was talking about, didn't I? Each floor in the depths is unique, so it's definitely distinguishable. That's for sure."

The ghost spoke confidently.

"This is the previous 71st floor. The depths are..."
