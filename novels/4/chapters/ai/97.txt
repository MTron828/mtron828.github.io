Episode 98

98. Vekweseta, Young Lamb of the Ma'eshin (8)

The red-haired man who was watching Taesan frowned.

"Such a youngster."

At most, he's in his twenties. Age usually correlates with strength. Even if he trained in his twenties, it wouldn't exceed a dozen years.

"We have to come along with this greenhorn."

The white-haired man chuckled.

"Think I came here because I like it?"

They are Swordmasters, the strongest humans in this world. Even a master might not be their match.

But the four of them have to unite to face one opponent. It was a blow to their pride.

Moreover, they belong to different nations. It was not a pleasant feeling to cooperate in a competitive relationship.

The purple-haired man said calmly,

"It's a direct order from above. Don't complain."

"Hmph."

The white-haired man snorted uncomfortably.

"Ho!"

The blonde-haired man looked at Taesan brightly.

"Are you the knight protecting the princess? Brave of you!"

Unlike the other Swordmasters, he sent a friendly glance towards Taesan.
The red-haired man stepped forward roughly.

"Step aside, Atria."

"Hm? You plan to do this alone?"

"Should we charge at him together then? Against this little squirt?"

"That would be unpleasant."

Atria, the blonde Swordmaster, known as such, obediently stepped back.

They knew Taesan was a magician. And at the level of Swordmasters, even against a master, they could hold the advantage.

"I'll go first."

"As you wish."

The other Swordmasters also withdrew.

The red-haired man drew his sword. It was an ordinary longsword with no particular features. A blue light surged above it.

Thicker and larger than Galant's. The red-haired man poised himself.

"Shall we give it a try?"

"Sounds good."

Taesan smiled.

Now, they would see proper use of Ohr.

Clang!

The swords clashed. The red-haired man's pupils slightly dilated.

"A fine sword."

Despite the clash with Ohr, Taesan's sword showed no sign of yielding. Greed flickered in the red-haired man's eyes.

"We'll have to take it as our spoils."

Clang!
The blue light flickered as it aimed at Taesan's body. It moved much faster than Galant.

"It's not just physical speed."

It seemed to enhance physical abilities with Ohr and the like.

But it wasn't that great. It's a speed that can respond even if you move leisurely.

"Wow, amazing."

The enemy, who didn't know that Taesan was controlling his strength, was impressed.

"I heard you were a magician, but have you trained your body too? Impressive."

The enemy chuckles.

"I'll have to take this seriously too."

Clang!

Five swords on the enemy's back were drawn. The blue light swords floated in the air without a bottom.

"I heard rumors. The attack is gone. How many times can this happen?"

The swords accelerate. They move freely as if they have life to aim at Taesan's body.

The enemy runs to Taesan.

'Winning Sword?'

In martial arts novels, the swordsmanship that freely controls the sword.

That was unfolding now.

Taesan moves his body. He avoids the sword aimed at his legs and twists his waist to pass by. Then, he makes a move to bounce the sword.

Craang!
However, he couldn't block every attack. Allowing attacks from all directions.

[Your first attack's absolute nullification has been triggered.]

The blue sword returns to its previous state before being struck.

"It really feels like time is turning back."

The enemy controls the sword with an impressed look.

This time, aiming for the upper body, lower body, and head. Despite soaking his body and trying to block with sword movements, the blue sword attacks following Taesan's evasion as if it had life.

"Hmm."

All nullifications of attacks are gone. Once again, swords aiming for the whole body move roughly to block, but one sword passes by his shoulder.

[You received 52 damage.]

'There's not much difference in damage.'

The enemy's weapon is much better than Galant's, but if the damage is the same, it means the damage is from Ohr itself, not the weapon.

"Is magic limited to three times? What should I do now?"

The enemy continues to pressure Taesan with a smirk. Taesan moves the sword roughly.

Clang!

With a loud noise, the enemy is knocked back.

"What?"
The enemy clenched his tingling hand. If he hadn't momentarily reinforced his body with Aura, he would have been knocked down entirely.

Taesan looked at the enemy with an intrigued expression.

"So this is Aura."

It was fascinating and intricate. Five blue swords moving freely as if they had life couldn't be blocked without magic or skills.

"It's more like a skill than swordsmanship. Quite unique."

But it wasn't something he couldn't counter.

"I understand the concept."

[You activate Acceleration.]

He charges at the enemy at a speed unmatched so far.

At a speed breaking the air, difficult even to follow with the eyes, but the enemy is a Swordmaster. A lifetime of training with swords. Reflexively swinging his hand, he tries to thrust the blue sword into Taesan's body.

Taesan swings the sword roughly. The blue sword shatters like glass.

"Eek!"

The enemy clenches his fist roughly. Once again, newly formed blue swords aim at Taesan.

Blocking or avoiding them all is nearly impossible.

Then, he'll just have to take them with his body.

Taesan tries to fend them off again, but some swords that he couldn't block strike him.

Swoosh.
The brightness briefly faded from the enemy's face, contorting into a grimace.

"What!"

Taesan's speed didn't falter at all. Despite swords embedded in his arms and legs, he rushed towards the enemy as if unaffected.

Clang.

Swords clashed. The enemy was overwhelmed.

Taesan deflected the enemy's sword. His own sword pierced through the enemy's heart.

"Me... me!"

The enemy cried out, coughing up blood.

That was their final word.

[Your Heroic Spirit has activated. You have gained the special skill [Qualification: Proof of the Sword].]

"If this is the level, Heroic Spirit activation is obtained."

Judging by the stats not gained, it seemed like a very close call.

Taesan looked up.

The Swordmasters gazed at him in astonishment.

"This... is..."

"...I heard he's a magician."

"Faster and stronger than us?"

The enemy Swordmaster belonged to a hostile nation. While his death should have been a cause for celebration, Taesan's displayed power was so superior that mere satisfaction seemed one-dimensional.

"...Incredibly strong, like a monster."
When using magic to surpass Swordmasters in physical prowess, it was a level of strength that was hard to accept.

Moreover, Taesan hadn't even used magic. The blue-haired youth groaned.

"Where did someone like you come from?"

"The Labyrinth."

"The Labyrinth?"

The blue-haired and white-haired ones had faces that didn't understand English. But the golden-haired one, called Atria, had a face that suggested she was piecing something together.

"The Labyrinth... could it be?"

Taesan watched their reactions closely. The blue-haired one bit his lip.

"It seems so. It hurts my pride... but you're far stronger than us. I guess we can't call you cowardly?"

"Do as you please."

They assumed their stances. They began to surround Taesan.

As a blue light arose, they charged forward.

Clang!

Taesan moved his twin swords to deflect and parry. First the Sword of the Wolf's Fang, then alternating with the Sword of the Dance of the Silent. He pressured the Swordmasters.

"So you're not only superior in magic but also swordsmanship."

The blue-haired one swung his sword fiercely with a grim face.

Clang-clang-clang!

Crescent-shaped auras shot out from the swords. They struck Taesan's arms and legs before he could react.

"Your first attack nullification has been activated."
Here is the English translation of the text:

"The shot-out aura returns and flies back again. Taesan quickly distances himself.

Kwung!

The aura shatters the trees. The blue-haired youth's eyes sink even deeper.

"...As rumored, it seems the time-reversing magic applies individually to each person. Where on earth did he learn such magic?"

The blue-haired youth looked dismayed, while Taesan was just as surprised as himself.

He never imagined he could shoot out an aura.

"Hup!"

Atria moves her greatsword with an intrigued expression. The aura enveloping the greatsword was several times larger than the sword itself.

Kuuung!

The sword, as massive as a tree trunk, clashes with Taesan's sword. Taesan's feet slide slightly to the side from the force.

The white-haired Swordmaster swings down at Taesan. The blue aura entwined around the sword wriggles like a snake, aiming for Taesan's throat.

"You activated Repulsion."

An intangible force spreads out from Taesan's center. The Swordmaster is pushed back slightly, and at the same time, Taesan widens the distance.

'This feels just like a martial arts novel.'

Taesan dodges the shooting aura with a wry smile.
Here is the English translation of the text:

"His strength and speed overwhelmingly dominate. Compared to the Swordmasters, who were adventurers he had slain on the 20th floor of the labyrinth until now.

It was surprising that he had become so strong without the aid of the system, but it was not threatening to the point where it could not be easily crushed with just his strength and speed.

However, it was quite troublesome.

Aura shooting like swordsmanship. Aura moving like a living being from the sword.

And surpassing the greatsword, aura growing to the size of a building.

Due to the uniqueness and defense of the aura, Taesan could not easily overwhelm it. Unless he was willing to take damage, he couldn't break through.

Swoosh!

The aura shoots out like a storm. Taesan tries to push it away by distancing himself but cannot completely block it.

One aura bends Taesan's thigh.

[You received 56 damage.]

"Huh!"

A giant sword made of aura swings down. Taesan blocks it but is pushed back and hits a tree.

'Are they similar to me.'

Taesan has won against enemies with superior stats using information and skills.

They were the same. They were pressuring Taesan using their superior skills with aura despite their inferior stats.
Here is the English translation of the text:

"However, there was a crucial difference between Taesan and them.

[You activated the Robe of Shadows.]

The Robe of Shadows, which cloaks the body for one second. As it activates, Taesan's body disappears. Even their presence vanishes, causing the Swordmasters to pause their attacks in confusion.

During that moment, Taesan sidles up next to the white-haired Swordmaster wielding the greatsword.

Swoosh.

"Ugh!"

Instinctively sensing danger, the white-haired Swordmaster turns their aura into a shield, deflecting Taesan's sword.

Taesan swings his sword again.

[You activated Strong Strike.]

Crash!

The aura shatters. The white-haired Swordmaster is left vulnerable.

"No!"

Despite being three against one, they couldn't overpower him. If one were to fall, the outcome was clear.

The blue-haired Swordmaster swiftly shoots numerous auras, but Taesan deflects their trajectory with ice arrows.

However, he couldn't evade all of them, and some pierce into Taesan's body. His shoulder is brutally pierced.

Taesan remains calm, gripping his sword.

[You activated Unyielding Will. For 10 seconds, you can fight ignoring your injuries.]
Here is the English translation of the text:

Taesan's sword pierces through the white-haired Swordmaster, who coughs up blood and collapses.

The blue-haired Swordmaster shouts in frustration,

"Why won't you just die!"

Aura penetrates Taesan's body. Despite the severe blow, Taesan does not fall.

"I'm different from you guys."

Taesan mutters grimly and charges towards the blue-haired Swordmaster. The blue-haired Swordmaster grits their teeth and uses Aura. Aura, which cuts through everything in its path, flies in a crescent shape.

Taesan's response was simple. He dodges attacks aimed at his head and heart, taking hits elsewhere as he charges forward.

Unable to block Taesan, who disregards defense, the blue-haired Swordmaster dies like that.

"It hurts."

Taesan pulls out the sword stuck in his abdomen and checks his stamina.

[Shield: 0/192] [Health: 1522/2250]

"It's quite worn out."

Even with a sword in his head or his heart pierced, Taesan won't die. As long as his health doesn't reach 0, he might as well be immortal.

In contrast, they were extremely fragile, dying if their chest was pierced or their head severed.

The difference was clear.

"Nevertheless, it's fine."
In reverse, it meant having to fight against an endlessly falling enemy, enduring the loss of health due to just one Aura.

Of course, Taesan wasn't at full strength either. If he had utilized all his skills, he could have easily subdued them.

Simply triggering a forced duel would have made it a 1:1 situation, making handling much easier.

However, there would certainly have been depletion of health. Aura had that much value.

"You're the only one left."

Taesan pointed his sword at the blonde Swordmaster, Atria. Atria chuckled and raised her hand.

"Surrender."
