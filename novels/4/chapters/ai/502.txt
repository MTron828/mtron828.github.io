Chapter 503

503. 93rd Floor, Demons (2)

Demons.

Taesan had only sensed their gaze, but had never met them directly. However, he knew what they were and what kind of existence they had.

Beings with their own domains, similar to gods.

"It's a gathering."

[It's not a big deal. You could even call it a simple tea party. Since I'm hosting it, all the demons with their own domains will come. You're a demon too, so it's good to participate at least once.]

"Is that all?"

Participating in the demons' gathering.

In response to the question of whether that was the 93rd floor's quest, Baal answered with a laugh.

It's not just a simple gathering. Baal had something else in mind after that.

Taesan nodded his head.

"I understand."

He didn't know what Baal was expecting, but he had no reason to refuse. Since the gods were directly involved, the possibility of things going in an unreasonable direction was low.

Baal stood up with a satisfied expression.

[Then let's get started right away. We need to create a space for the gathering.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ba'al lightly swung his arm.

A thick, dark magic was unfolding in the world. Darkness was pushing out the space and filling it with a new one.

Cha-cha-cha.

Like a piece of paper unfolding, the darkness rapidly expanded its size.

Like a sponge that had absorbed water, it rapidly expanded. The darkness became vast and a huge world was realized in the space.

It was a desolate plain.

There were no mountains, no rocks, just a flat plain that stretched out as far as the eye could see.

[It's a bit big, but I guess this size will do.]

Ba'al muttered indifferently. But Taesan knew. What he had just done was not something that could be easily overlooked.

Ba'al had just created a new realm.

He had created an incredibly vast world without any burden, in an instant. Taesan thought that if he couldn't maintain the Chaos Realm for long, it was a clear difference.

If he were just a simple believer, he wouldn't have even noticed what Ba'al had done. But Taesan had become stronger than that. So he could understand the level of what Ba'al had done.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Baal was undoubtedly a being worthy of a high god or a conceptual god.

[Don't be surprised. You'll get there someday. It won't take long.]

Baal snapped his fingers.

The domain moved according to the master's will. The earth rose, and in an instant, a magnificent building was created.

[That's a building for gatherings.]

Baal lightly waved his hand.

[Go in first and rest. Other demons will come soon. My tools inside will guide you to your room. It'll take about... a day or so.]

Taesan walked towards the building.

The building was enormous, rivaling the size of a small mountain.

As he approached the door, it opened automatically. A mask floating in mid-air was waiting for Taesan.

[Please come this way.]

The mask, with an emotionless voice, guided Taesan to his room.

[When the time comes and all preparations are complete, I'll visit you again.]

The room was huge and luxurious at the same time. Taesan patted the bed, which could accommodate ten people. The soft and elastic sensation transmitted to his hand."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The quiet Bardley muttered to himself.

"[This is a gathering of demons, isn't it? I never thought I'd be able to participate in such a place.]"

"There's no reason to be surprised now."

"[Is that so? My senses are getting weird.]"

The demons were also clearly powerful beings. They had given the dark magic power to the demon tribe.

However, Taesan had encountered powerful beings, including the Concept God and the High God, and Bardley had watched everything from beside him, so the greatness of the demons seemed relatively low.

As time passed idly, a few beings with distorted powers, not from this world, were felt approaching the building where Taesan was.

"Demons."

They were beings with twisted powers, not from this world.

The demons started entering the building one by one. After some time, over ten demons had entered the building.

They went into what seemed to be their own rooms.

Taesan was sensing all of their movements and powers.

It was the same with the demons.

They also knew about Taesan.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Many gazes were fixed on Taesan, each carrying a certain emotion as they watched him.

Taesan opened his mouth.

"Shut up."

Kwaddduk!

The gazes converged and were trampled.

The gazes that had been directed at him, along with the malice, completely disappeared.

"You're quite popular, aren't you?"

[It doesn't seem like a friendly gaze, though.]

Every demon that had entered this place was staring at Taesan, and the energy in their gazes was far from friendly.

[You ate Baal's domain, didn't you? So, you're being resented for stealing your fellow demon's power?]

"It doesn't seem that simple, though."

Taesan recalled the gazes that had been directed at him.

There was little malice or anger in them.

Rather, it was arrogance.

A gaze that looked down on Taesan, like a noble gazing at a commoner.

And that made Taesan feel uneasy.

"You can't look at me like that."

He was curious, but he would soon find out anyway. Taesan lay down on the bed.

Baal said it would be good to take a break and rest.

Then, he could catch up on his sleep.

He relaxed his tense muscles and released the tension in his body. The demon's aura enveloped Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan hadn't slept for months.

From the moment he gained divinity, his physical and mental state transcended the human realm. During his journey through the numerous planets in the previous layer, he never once took a nap.

So, Taesan had a dream for the first time in a long while.

In the dream, Taesan was in a certain space.

It was a distorted realm where his physical form was unrecognizable, and its essence was impossible to grasp. There, numerous powers and concepts were visible.

Among them were grand, universe-encompassing concepts that the current Taesan couldn't reach.

It was like a treasure trove filled with the most precious things in the universe.

However, all of those things were scattered around the realm like trash.

Something was sitting in the midst of it.

Its form was not human, but it wasn't a monster either. It couldn't be said to be from this world or from beyond. It was something that existed in between.

Taesan stared at it intently.

And it also stared back at Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

In an instant, it distorted. Taesan felt his face change. Joy and greed, longing. He felt all those emotions.

Something with an unknown form collapsed.

It transformed into a fog-like shape and rushed towards Taesan, engulfing him and covering him with a mist.

At that moment, Taesan opened his eyes.

"[Are you awake?]" "[Have you awakened, Master?]"

A voice was heard. Taesan slowly got up, feeling the silky texture on his fingertips.

"……How much time has passed?"

"[It's been quite a while. About eighteen hours?]"

"Really?"

Taesan pressed his forehead. The ghost, who realized something was different, asked.

"What happened?"

"I don't know."

He had a dream.

No, it wasn't a dream. For him, who had obtained divinity, the concept of dreams no longer existed. It was something else, not a dream.

But he couldn't remember. Something was blocking his memory, making it hazy.

"What's going on."

Taesan shook his head. His mind cleared, and his senses began to return.

As he expanded his senses, he felt demons moving one by one towards the center of the building. And he sensed one presence approaching him.

Thud. Thud.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The knock sounded. When I opened the door, I saw the mask that had guided me to Taesan.

[It's time. Follow me.]

* * *

Taesan followed the mask and moved.

As we walked a little inside the enormous building, I saw a huge door in the center.

I could sense the presence of over a dozen demons inside.

[Everyone is waiting. Please come in.]

The mask stepped back. Taesan quietly opened the door.

Creak.

The door opened.

At the same time, dozens of gazes fixed on Taesan.

There were demons there.

Their appearances were all different. Some had the form of muscular men, while others had the form of captivating women.

There were also those that didn't have human forms. Distorted, abnormal creatures, giant black birds, and so on. They were all different.

It was supposed to be a simple gathering, but it looked like a party with numerous tables. On top of them were strange things that looked like food.

[The protagonist has arrived.]

And at the highest seat, Baal sat.

He laughed and held a cup filled with red liquid.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Self. Let's start the meeting. Laugh, drink, and enjoy yourselves. It's the only positive thing you can do.]

The voice of Baal contained scorn and contempt towards the demons.

The meeting began. The demons started laughing, chatting, and enjoying themselves.

Taesan gazed at them with a cold eye.

Demons with territories. The masters of dark magic that Taesan possessed.

It was the first time he was seeing them directly. Among them, he could sense familiar energies.

And as Taesan watched them, they too were secretly gazing at him.

What was contained in their eyes was interest and scorn.

And a gaze of disdain.

But they didn't move. They pretended to be uninterested in Taesan, as if saying, "You're nothing to us." Their attitude was so obvious that it was almost laughable.

Participating in the meeting was the 93rd floor's quest. If we just kill time, it'll be over soon.

When Taesan didn't show any signs of moving, one of the demons, whose face was red with excitement, opened his mouth.

"[You have no manners.]"

A voice with a mocking tone rang out."

Note: "Baal" is a name that appears in various mythologies and religions, often associated with demonic or evil beings. In this context, it seems to be a powerful entity that is addressing the demons.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan turned his gaze away. He was enormous, at least ten times the size of a normal person. His entire body was covered in bulging muscles, and just looking at him was enough to evoke a sense of disgust.

Taesan muttered to himself in a low voice.

"Amon."

The devil, Amon.

Taesan was also somewhat skilled in dark magic, just like Amon. Amon curled up the corners of his mouth in distaste.

[You should be the first to come to us and express your gratitude. Instead, you're just standing there. You have no manners at all.]

"Me, express gratitude to you?"

Taesan was taken aback by the sudden remark. Amon clicked his tongue in annoyance.

[You're using our power as if it's your own. It's all thanks to our favor. We're the ones who allowed you to reach this point. So, of course, you should be grateful.]

"I didn't obtain dark magic because you gave it to me, but because of my contract with the gods."

It was just a simple contract. The devils didn't directly grant him the power. But Amon looked displeased, as if Taesan's words were arrogant.

[Even so, you were able to become stronger thanks to us. So, it's only natural to show your gratitude.]

"……."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan stared at Amon without a word. Amon's eyes trembled for a moment under Taesan's quiet gaze.

[... Whatever. Let's just say that's how it is. But we can't allow you to be impolite. We are demons.]

Amon's voice was filled with unmistakable pride.

[We are eternal and immortal beings. No one can trespass on us. The fragile, mortal beings of this world cannot reach us.]

Taesan's fingers, as thick as his wrist, pointed at Amon.

[You're the same. A being of this world. I acknowledge that you're strong, but you're a being that will eventually disappear. But we're different. We're eternal and immortal, unrelated to the universe.]

"So?"

Taesan's voice dropped.

"So what do you want me to do?"

[Show some respect.]

Amon replied as if it was obvious.

[We are eternal beings. We existed before you were born. You should show respect to us, who have existed for so long. That's what you should do for us.]

A chuckling laughter was heard. Other demons were watching with amusement.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"All the demons were the same. Not a single one was missing, and they all showed an attitude similar to Amon's.

Taesan's eyes grew cold.

'It's different from what I expected.'

He was curious about the demons.

How they saw themselves, what kind of relationship they had with Gosin, and what perspective they had on things.

He was curious about their point of view, having lived for a long time, and the information they knew. So, he had been looking forward to meeting with the demons.

But the demons did not meet his expectations.

There was no wisdom or calmness unique to those who had lived for a long time. They were just emotional, full of pride and self-confidence.

It would be meaningless to have a meeting with such beings. That was a fact that anyone, not just Taesan, could understand.

Taesan turned his gaze away.

Baal was quietly watching them with an unreadable smile."
