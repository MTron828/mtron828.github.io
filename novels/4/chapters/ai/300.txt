Chapter 301

301 (Outsider). 100th floor, Lee Taeyong

[Lee Taeyong [Alone] : Hello?] [Lee Taeyong [Alone] : Is anyone here?] [Lee Taeyong [Alone] : Let me see, let me see, let me see.]

There is no response.

Lee Taeyong, who had been repeatedly shouting without a echo, let out a deep sigh.

* * *

[Lee Taeyong [Alone] : Hello? Is there anyone alive around here? Can you please respond?]

However, there is still no response. She turned off her community.

From behind her, a faint, mocking laughter echoed.

[Are you looking for understanding and comfort from others? You're not even a brave adventurer who has come this far, but rather a coward.]

"Don't remind me of what I already know, just be quiet for a while."

Lee Taeyong collapses to the floor with a groan.

"Is there nothing to do? Are you just going to stick with someone like me forever? It's been over ten years, hasn't it?"

The identity of the voice's owner is unknown to her. All she knew was that there was someone who had been following her for a long time, saying all sorts of things.
Here is the translation of the text:

It seemed to be a divine existence, but the voice didn't properly reveal its true identity.

At first, I was bewildered, but now I've gotten used to it. I won't intervene beyond just talking, so I don't need to worry about anything.

[There's time left for beings like us. You're talking like that.]

"Are you willing?"

She gazes up at the ceiling of the labyrinth, muttering to herself.

The labyrinth of darkness. A small space.

She has thoroughly examined every nook and cranny of this place. She's spent a lot of time here.

[What to do, kid.]

"Ah, well... "

Lee Taeyeon murmurs to herself dazedly.

"What should I do?"

How much she's said already. Now she's about to utter those words again.

She gazes calmly at the ceiling. One hour, two hours, and a day.

And then a week.

After a week, the girl who had been sitting still got up.

[What to do?]

"It's not like I can just sit still again, so I'll make one more attempt."

She takes a step forward, and an endless maze appears beyond the corridor.

She steps into the maze.
Here is the translation of the text:

That place was a maze that even a seasoned explorer couldn't fully understand after mapping it out for hundreds of years, a labyrinth of despair.

Lee Taeyoon walked through the maze with ease.

Her steps towards the tunnel seemed to repeat themselves countless times, with no hesitation.

In fact, it was almost as if she was being forced to do so.

"Can't I shorten this a bit? It's getting annoying to walk."

As she complained, a quiet chuckle echoed through the maze.

How long had she walked? She had finally reached the end of the maze. There was a dark-colored door there.

And a guardian was standing in front of it.

Lee Taeyoon smiled wryly and raised her hand.

"Hello?"

[...and so on.]

The guardian's voice was laced with a stern tone.

"Don't be so reckless. It's not like it's going to be fun around here?"

Lee Taeyoon chuckled.

"Ah, I'm a real adventurer, aren't I? What's there to be happy about?"

[If it's the first time you've seen a face, I don't care about you.]

Lee Taeyoon moved her body, which was composed of brick-like structures, with a hint of annoyance.

[Is it because I came here to clear it?]

Lee Taeyoon nodded her head. The guardian, who had been silent for a moment, asked again.

[Do you remember how many times you've tried this?]
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, really?"

Taeyeon stared blankly into the air.

"How many times is this? Do you remember?"

[I don't know. It's pointless to remember a meaningless number.]

"Why did you ask?"

Taeyeon raised an eyebrow. The voice in her head spoke up.

"It's a matter of the mind."

"Ah, so you asked that."

Taeyeon shook her head.

"It's okay. I have a very bright future waiting for me, so just open it up."

[But it's not like that... if that's what you wanted.]

Kuku kuku kuku!

The door opens.

Taeyeon takes a deep breath and steps inside.

This is how many times? She didn't remember the words she said to the voice in her head. She had been here for a long time, unable to leave.

But each experience filled her with fear.

Her breathing quickened and her skin went cold.

The possibility that everything up until now would disappear like nothing was overwhelming, and death loomed over her.

But she refused to accept it.

She endured her fear and pushed her body into the room.
Here is the translation of the text:

As she gazed at him, the entity watching her felt satisfied.

[Hang in there.]

The door closed with a faint sound.

[Starting the 100th quest.]

The light turned on, revealing the inside of the floor.

Numerous treasures lay before him.

A sword, a bow, a shield, a halberd, a crossbow.

Thousands, tens of thousands of treasures were buried in the ground.

"Let's try again."

[You have activated the breathing of a hidden mouse.] [You have activated an unknown hidden story.] [You have activated an invisible shadow.]

Her presence disappeared.

The sound of her breathing, a small movement, the rustling of her clothes.

Nothing can be heard.

It was as if the existence of Lee Tae-yeon had vanished here.

[You have activated the possibility of a hundred times.]

Lee Tae-yeon slowly began to move.

* * *

[Quest failed]

Kuku-kuku-kung……

The door opened, and Lee Tae-yeon appeared in a worn-out state.

The voice asked, sounding familiar, as if it had become accustomed to it.

[It's a failure again.]

"Why do you ask when you already know?"

[But it took the longest today. I lasted for two days. No congratulations.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"The noise is loud."

YoonA pouts and puts away her phone.

She walked back into the gray room again, looking exhausted. She collapsed onto her bed, her tired face buried in her pillow.

She opened the community.

[YoonA [Alone] : Hey.] [YoonA [Alone] : Can someone answer me?] [YoonA [Alone] : Please.] [Lee Chang-chun [Hard] : ...What's going on? Is there still an alone mode player alive?]

A shocking response came back. YoonA turned pale.
Here is the translation of the text:

[I Chang-chun [Hard] : Miss Lee Tae-yeon, did you still not clear it? Are you still not going to go down with me?]

[I Tae-yeon [Alone] : It seems that someone is still alive! What about the others?]

[I Chang-chun [Hard] : There are a few more people besides me. They're all half-mad, though.]

[I Tae-yeon [Alone] : Is that so?]

[I Chang-chun [Hard] : Anyway, the community is still alive. No, to be precise, only one side was still writing. Well, there's no reason to write in the community anymore. The others will just talk to each other in their own mode.]

[I Tae-yeon [Alone] : So I'm getting bored, right? Can't we chat a bit?]

[I Chang-chun [Hard] : There's no time for that. It's a mess. If I'm not careful, I might take even longer than being in alone mode.]

I Chang-chun wrote a harsh post.

[I Chang-chun [Hard] : I'll get out of here quickly. I'll return to Earth. I won't write in the community anymore.]

[I Tae-yeon [Alone] : Don't do that, let's chat a bit…….]

But there was no response.

She let out a deep sigh and closed the community.

"……How long have I been here?"

[At least your human lifespan is far beyond the time I've been here.]

It was an unbearable, incredibly long time.

The reason there was no response in the community was simple.

Most players had already returned to Earth a long time ago.

The remaining ones had survived the return to Earth each time, but due to the limitations of their abilities or their fear of death, they had given up and collapsed.
Here is the translation of the text:

They had no reason to write a community because they were completely consumed by their desire to return. They would focus solely on navigating the labyrinth safely.

She sighed and closed her eyes.

* * *

The next day, she woke up with a start, letting out a loud groan. As she walked towards the maze, someone asked her:

[Where are you going?]

"I'll just do some grinding. There are still a few pieces of equipment I need to upgrade."

She let out a loud groan as she entered the maze.

Even if you walk in the right direction, you won't encounter any monsters in the maze, but if you make even the slightest mistake, monsters will appear. Iteyan was deliberately taking a different path to summon the monsters.

"Kaaah……."

As she rushed towards the monster with a scream, Iteyan carelessly swung at it.

This was the hundredth time she had defeated the monster. Now, she could even fight it with her eyes closed.

Kia!

After defeating the monster and collecting her reward, she did it again. She defeated the monster and collected her reward again.

For a week, Iteyan only fought monsters, without taking a single break.

"Still not enough, I think."
Here is the translation of the text:

But it was not enough to buy equipment. It was still a long way off. She kept swinging her sword at the monsters.

"Wouldn't it be better if our positions were reversed?"

[Are you talking about that kid you always talk about?]

"Yes, Taesan. If it were that guy, he would have done well here too. The gods would have liked him a lot."

Taesan.

He taught I-tae-yeon countless skills. Most of them were ones she couldn't obtain, but she got a few more. Without those two skills, she might have given up on clearing.

Although everything was over and they could return to Earth together, he remained in the labyrinth and created countless skills.

The gods of the labyrinth wanted someone like Taesan.

[...That's to be expected.]

He burst out laughing.

[If what you said is true, the gods here will like him very much. They will pamper him and make him their disciple. Perhaps they will even give him more than that.]

"It's different from me, you know."

I-tae-yeon sighed with annoyance. The gods looked down on her. Every time she passed by, she would get annoyed and let out a sigh.
Here is the translation of the text:

"She could understand that they didn't want someone like Taeyeon. But she couldn't help but get annoyed too.

'Who came here because they wanted to?'

She gritted her teeth and lowered her sword.

Crack.

The monster was torn apart and shattered.

She still thinks about it occasionally.

If she had been in the easy mode, it would have been different. And if Taesan had been in the easy mode, it would have been different too.

If that had been the case, she would have been perfect. She could have transferred the responsibility to Taesan and lived a normal life, struggling to survive.

I've thought about it tens of thousands of times since entering the labyrinth.

But it's a meaningless story. They had already made their choice.

'Come back alive.'

It was something Taesan left behind for her a few years, or maybe a few decades ago.

She clenched her teeth.

She caught a monster for a year and managed to assemble new equipment with the gold she gathered. She collapsed onto her bed to rest and recover from her accumulated fatigue.

She was too tired.

If she could just close her eyes and rest, how good it would be."

Note: The characters' names, Taeyeon and Taesan, are likely references to K-pop idols Taeyeon and Taesan, respectively. However, without further context, it's difficult to determine the exact connection between the characters and the K-pop idols.
Here is the translation of the text:

She murmured to herself.

"……Is the Earth happy now?"

They closed the rift in the sky during their last return.

The only thing left was to restore the civilization.

Many people had died, but those who survived had obtained the power of the gods. Among them, there were also skilled technicians.

If people around the world could combine their strength, they could recover the civilization quickly. Maybe they could have already returned to the Earth of the past.

"Didn't everyone die?"

They didn't know how long their lifespan was. They had exceeded the limit of human lifespan the moment they entered the labyrinth.

However, it seemed unlikely that their lifespan had already ended. Everyone would be alive on Earth.

If they cleared the 100th floor and returned, everyone would welcome her. They could also scold her for taking so long or tell her to hurry up.

But in the end, they would all smile and welcome her.

They could live a peaceful life again under the developed civilization.

"It's only natural."

It wouldn't be possible otherwise.
Here is the translation of the text:

The only hope that was holding on to her crumbling mind was that one thing.

Lee Tae-yeon huddled her body like a child.

And then, an unknown existence quietly watched her.

* * *

The next day, she challenged the 100th floor again.

The result was, as always, a failure.

[ Congratulations, you've lasted three days. If you keep going, you'll be able to clear it in a few decades.]

"Tsk, tsk."

Lee Tae-yeon grumbled and returned to her bed.

Her expression was not bad. She had definitely lasted longer than before because she had changed her equipment.

If you keep going, you'll surely clear it someday.

A sound of laughter was heard.

[The gods and the magician don't like you very much. They didn't want you to clear it like that.]

The gods and the magician wanted a great challenge from the great ones. It was a fight to the death and a step towards becoming stronger.

But Lee Tae-yeon was not like that.

She only sought a safe way.
Here is the translation of the text:

They don't want to obtain power beyond what they have calculated using the labyrinth's system. But... you're different.

The laughter grew even thicker.

[They searched for loopholes in the quest conditions and discovered errors in the system. Ah, you're parasitizing the labyrinth's system.]

The one who parasitizes the system.

To call this person "Iteyan" in one word, that would be accurate. Iteyan also had a calm expression.

"I'm not denying it. But I'm also unhappy, right? They're making it so that others can't parasitize it either."

[That's not a wrong statement either.]

The voice said that with a laugh mixed in.

[The gods judge you as someone who parasitizes, and they dislike it very much... but I'm different. I like you. In fact, I think they're foolish.]

Iteyan was lying on the bed, listening to the conversation with a calm tone.

[You're amazing.]

There was a sigh that couldn't be hidden in the voice.

[This place is a place created by the gods and magicians, and transcendent beings. None of the many adventurers who have come here have been able to reach the 100th floor by exploiting loopholes and parasitizing the system.]
Here is the translation of the text:

It was not the case that no one had cleared the labyrinth.

But only one person, Lee Taeyeon, had reached the 100th floor in the same way.

[You have the possibility of clearing the labyrinth in a unique and abnormal way. In my opinion, you are worth more than a novice adventurer.]

"So, what's the point? No one recognizes it anyway."

She muttered to herself, her voice trembling with a hint of laughter.

She repeated this over and over.

She attempted to clear the 100th floor, and then changed her equipment when it seemed lacking.

The number of attempts changed from hundreds to thousands. Her equipment became perfect, with no more room for improvement.

As a result, she began to buy an immeasurable number of consumable items.

Even the shop owner couldn't keep track of the countless potions and items she bought.

She continued to repeat this process, and finally...

Kurururur!

[100th Floor Cleared] [Reward Received]

She had finally reached the end.

* * *

[……It's utterly ridiculous.]

The shop owner let out a dry laugh.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Not even other adventurers, but someone like you, could really clear the 100th floor, so it's worthy of respect to this extent."

"Shh."

Lee Taeyeon let out a gasp and sat down on the floor, exhausted.

Her body was battered, and she couldn't even speak properly due to exhaustion.

But she had won.

She had cleared the labyrinth.

She smiled slightly.

"I've met the conditions, so you know?"

[Ah, it's impossible to deny that. Congratulations. You, a mortal adventurer.]

Bulba declared.

[You have cleared the labyrinth and obtained the qualification to meet the wizard. Wait, I will summon him.]

As Bulba left, Lee Taeyeon lay down and began to recover her strength.

She let out a tired laugh.

"I did it."

She had done it.

She had cleared this hellish labyrinth.

Now she can return to the earth.

Now she can live a happy life with many people, including Tae-san, Chung-geun, and others.

Lee Taeyeon opened the community with a smile.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone] : I'll go first.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's been too long. I don't know if there are any left who still exist. Around the time when the 100th floor clearance was in sight, she didn't use the community anymore.

However, if there were any, she could have boosted their enthusiasm by revealing the fact that she had cleared it.

[Congratulations. Ah, yeah.]

"Thank you."

Lee Taeyeon was extremely happy. As a result, her emotions of gratitude towards her voice rose to her throat.

"For the time being, thank you."

Her voice was calling out to her. If she hadn't been there, she would have really gone crazy.

[What is it. I also had a happy experience. Now I'll go back to Earth.]

"Yes."

She said it strongly.

Now, a happy life was waiting for her.

She was filled with hope, and the voice was asking her.

[But I'm curious. Ah, yeah. Are you looking forward to death?]

"Perish the thought."

Lee Taeyeon shook her head.

She didn't want to die. Therefore, she had endured the inexpressible time, and had repeatedly wanted to give up, but had arrived here.

[Then, Ah, yeah. Do you want to start over from the beginning and pass through the maze again?]

"What's with the question?"

Lee Taeyeon said with a tired face.

"Of course, I don't want to."
Here is the translation of the text:

Even now, I'm willing to risk my life. I've been parasitizing on the system, looking for loopholes, but I never had to worry about dying. It was only because of the coincidence and good luck that I barely cleared it. Even if I had to do it again, I didn't think I could do it.

Would I dare to break through this place again?

I definitely didn't think so. She.

She laughed with a "tchk tchk" sound.

[So, what will you choose?]

"What are you saying suddenly?"

[It's a story from the future. Whatever it is, I'll respect your choice.]

She furrowed her brow, unable to understand what she was saying.

She often spoke in a language she didn't understand herself.

This time, she didn't sound any different. I thought, It's probably like that.

She smiled happily.

Now, I think the magician will appear soon, and ask me what I want.

What should I talk about? She kept imagining a happy scenario.

I'll return to Earth.

And live with everyone together.

She was filled with hope.

It wasn't until a short time later that she realized the meaning hidden in the voice's words.
