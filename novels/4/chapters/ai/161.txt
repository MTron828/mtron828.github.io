Chapter 162

162. The 36th floor, a mysterious being who pursues twisted secrets (2)

[Since there is no clear domain or purpose, I only move for my desires.]

"It doesn't seem to be any different from the gods."

[It's not the same because the gods have desires for the domains they are responsible for, while we have desires for ourselves.]

The gods are bound to their domains, whether good or bad. Therefore, their actions are restricted and can be somewhat predicted.

However, immortals are different. They are free. Thus, it is difficult to predict their actions and what they will do.

"What level is Raki-Ratas compared to?"

[If we compare immortals to Raki-Ratas, Raki-Ratas is very merciful. Although they act on their own, at least they only act in the domain of struggle and death, right? So, their actions can be predicted and responded to. But these ones are different.]

During the ordeal, a mysterious being spoke up, saying, "..."
Here is the translation of the text:

[You're a free spirit, and there will be those who dislike you and those who like you.]

"Is it a trap this time?"

The gaze towards Taesan was felt.

It was filled with annoyance.

A great intention was revealed at the ancient site.

[The power of the distorted mystery, which the fox-like being had pursued, has weakened.]

[The fox-like being, who had pursued the distorted mystery, proposes a strengthened test to you.]

Taesan gazed at the system window calmly.

Unlike before, it was a quest that was entirely unpredictable.

Taesan nodded his head.

"I accept."

[Sub-quest starts. The fox-like being tests you. The labyrinth begins to change. The distorted intention covers 36 layers.]

A sudden chill ran down my entire body.

Taesan instinctively realized something.

The feeling of a scattered aura was a kind of blessing. It was similar to the blessing of the gods, which strengthened the power of mortals and granted them new power.

[The power of the distorted mystery, which the fox-like being had pursued, is manifested. The distortion is activated.]

"Ah."

The power faded away. The labyrinth looked ordinary, just like when I first came.

However, Taesan scowled.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's not good."

"What's going on?"

The ghostly figure was also trembling with an eerie feeling.

Whatever happened, we had to confirm it first. The mountain god grasped his sword and left the ruins behind.

As a result, we could see a monster.

"This is again."

The 36th-floor monster was a knight who wore a blue armor and wielded a sword.

His movements were swift and precise, making him a challenging monster for ordinary adventurers.

However, what was before the mountain god's eyes was entirely different.

The knight's body was twisted.

The sword had merged with his arm, and the armor was corroding, with rust flowing out.

[A knight who had received the blessing of the twisted mystery appeared.]

"What's this called a blessing?"

The knight's aura had undoubtedly become stronger.

However, that was not all. He lost his normal appearance as a price for his power.

[Because he is not a god.]

The ghost let out a sigh.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unlike gods, the immortal ones did not have a dignified aura. Therefore, they could force their power into mortal beings, but they could not bestow divine blessings like gods. Despite that, many people sought to become immortal and pursue the power of the immortal ones, but...

"What's the result?"

Everything was twisted and collapsed into existence.

That was the words of someone who had received the power of the immortal ones.

"This is not good."

The ghost murmured, and the knight moved simultaneously.

Holding a sword merged with his arm, he charged at the mountain with a rough movement.

At the same time, a chill ran through the knight's entire body. The cold air had a magical aura that seemed to freeze his internal organs.

Kaang!

The swords clashed.

However, the knight was able to block Taesan's sword and prevent it from striking back.

If it were a normal 36th-floor monster, it would have flown away just by clashing swords, but the knight was struggling to hold back against Taesan.

"What's this?"

Taesan thrust his sword into the knight's chest.

Kaang!

[222 damage to the blue knight who had received the blessing of twisted divine power.]

Taesan looked at the damage gauge and widened the distance. The ghost seemed to be confused, muttering to himself.

"What's this? Why can't it penetrate?"

"Still unusual, isn't it?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The attack was a powerful one, with the addition of a fierce blow. If it were Taesan's attack, it would have dealt at least a thousand points of damage.

[Just looking at it would have strengthened the body and reduced physical damage. Could even an immortal have given such a blessing?]

The ghost was shocked. "This is too strong."

[This is really strange, but this is the real deal.]

The ghost muttered to himself. Taesan looked at the knight.

The previous attack didn't deal much damage. Despite using the addition and fierce blow, it was as if the knight's physical defense had become extremely high.

The blessing was given by a twisted divine being.

And Taesan knew that the divine being meant magic.

Blame.

Taesan's foot stopped.

[You have activated the blazing fist.]

Hongyeong is implemented next to Taesan, who is running with flames. It blocks the knight's sword and unleashes the blazing fist.

Pffft!

[The blue knight, who received the blessing of the twisted divine being, took 201 points of damage.]

'Ah, yes.'

It became clear. The knight had a high defense against physical attacks, but took normal damage from magical attacks.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Great Mountain once again created some distance. The ghost seemed to have grasped the situation, and it said something that was utterly unbelievable.

"This is a bit too much, don't you think?"

It seemed to be implying that one would have to pass through the layers using only magic, without using martial arts or skills.

It was certainly not an easy ordeal.

The Great Mountain had not often used magic before. To him, magic was a supplementary area, so he was not very skilled in it.

Additionally, all the monsters in the entire layer had been blessed, making it difficult to pass through easily.

"'But I'm not that helpless either,'"

[You have launched the Frost Arrow.]

Thud-thud.

The ice arrow that could freeze space appeared, and the Great Mountain hurled it straight at the knight.

The knight swung his sword to deflect the arrow, but just as he did, the Great Mountain used magic.

[You have launched a magical explosion.]

Boom!

The Frost Arrow exploded, and fragments scattered everywhere. The knight was caught off guard and was pierced through his entire body.

As the stumbling knight approached, the Great Mountain used magic again.

[You have launched a lightning bolt.]

Kzzt!

The lightning bolt struck the knight. The knight trembled and rushed at the Great Mountain.

The Great Mountain waved his hand.
Here is the translation of the text:

You have triggered a gust of wind.

The wind bursts forth in front of the article. The article's body shakes suddenly and stops its charge towards Tai Shan.

Tai Shan, who confirmed that the gust of wind can block the charge, triggered the gust of wind again and again. The article shook and was pushed around.

"It seems like you're misunderstanding something."

Tai Shan wasn't using magic as their main attack because they were strong enough without it, not because their magical level was low.

Thanks to the points from the Earth Return Reward, Tai Shan's magical proficiency had exceeded 40%. Compared to the strength of the guiding wizards who used magic, it was a very high level, equivalent to 30 floors.

"Well, that's good."

It wouldn't be a problem to use magic against the opponent. It would just take a bit more time, but it would be no issue.

However, with the upcoming intermediate magic, Tai Shan thought about increasing their magical proficiency even further.

The mischievous little devil, who was pursuing twisted mysteries, was eager to make Tai Shan use magic. "So, do it that way."

Let's just use magic to pass the test. Tai Shan decided that way.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan wore the equipment that had been left behind, which could enhance his magical abilities. Then, he successively cast spells, and the knight was defeated.

The massive aura that had been watching Tai Shan suddenly shook.

Tai Shan realized that there was a slight commotion in that place.

"What's going on?"

Tai Shan was puzzled and approached.

* * *

The same knight was waiting for Tai Shan in the next room, twisted and turned. Tai Shan used the same spells to defeat the knight.

Although the damage from the magic was not very high, it took some time, but it was easy to defeat the knight without any major problems.

However, the massive aura shook again.

The emotions contained in it were intense enough for Tai Shan to sense them.

Anger and frustration.

"Strange."

Tai Shan muttered to himself. The gods he had seen so far had each revealed their emotions abundantly, but they had a unique calmness and serenity that transcended human nature.

However, the twisted god was different. He was like a normal human, getting angry at Tai Shan's actions.

It was not a behavior that could be expected from an immortal being. A ghost explained the reason.

"It's simple. Immortals are twisted beings, after all."
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's with that?"

As I said earlier, they possess the power to transcend the limits of mortals, but they lack the corresponding dignity. It's like giving a sword to a foolish child. They may be incredibly strong, but mentally they are weak.

"Can something like that be possible?"

If one is immortal, they should at least be far stronger than mortals. The leaders of the guiding spirits I met possessed powers that exceeded imagination, but they still couldn't penetrate the depths. It was clear.

But they're mentally weak and unstable. It's hard to understand.

There are two types of immortals. The first type has built up their strength through legitimate means but lacks the corresponding dignity, so they can't transcend. The second type has built up their strength from the beginning through unfair means. The latter is unlikely to occupy the seat of the transcendent.

I didn't feel any awe or respect when speaking to the ghostly voice.

Unfairly built-up strength has its limitations. It's just a bunch of nonsense from those who have built up their strength through unfair means. Maybe it's a figure who has pursued twisted mysteries.

All that was left was a sense of contempt.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Do you want to know one thing? Those who use underhanded methods love guides who lead them down the path of sin, because they are similar to themselves, and they dislike others who are similar to them, because they are walking a path that others cannot take.

"Is that a bad memory?"

"I too have had my share of experiences. I didn't stop others from going through trials and tribulations, but to be honest, I don't like things that don't go well.

"A being with eternal life, who has amassed power through unscrupulous means, lacks the dignity and intellect corresponding to their strength. They are only strong, but they use their power to oppress and torment those with talent, and that's all they are. Just look at that.

"A knight appeared in front of Tai Shan. Tai Shan manifested his magic and pushed the knight away.

"Are you saying that the blessing that reduces physical damage and allows you to withstand your strength has spread throughout the entire team, even if you are an eternal being? That's excessive. I think you were going to give me a trial and test my strength, but since that didn't work out, you're getting frustrated.

"Why so?"

"Because you're chasing after distorted mysteries. You, who have already been granted a high-level magic by the gods of magic, are detestable."

Tai Shan paused."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Definitely, he has been allowed to learn advanced magic from the god of magic."

"What's the point of that?"

[Those who use tricks to kill mortal beings just because they show a slight interest in them are indeed despicable.]

The ghost spat out its tongue.

[Those who rely on tricks to gain power. Therefore, those who are unprepared. With such a nature, they are prone to being consumed by jealousy and resentment, and their emotions are poured out on mortal beings. It's good to be cautious. There are many immortal beings who dislike you, after all.]

Just as the ghost finished speaking, another tremor shook the space.

[The power of the distorted magic, which the foolish old man had pursued, had greatly diminished.] [The manifestation of the distorted magic, which the foolish old man had pursued, had become even more distorted.]
