Chapter 121

121. Appoint the King (2)

Those who had experienced the quest were shocked. It was because the system window was different from the previous ones, which had been about moving and blocking.

Appoint the King. The King can give roles.

And the King can issue orders.

People gathered to hold a meeting. Since there were too many normal and easy modes, they were excluded. Among the hard mode players, the strongest ones, including Lee Ji-ah, Kang Jun-hyeok, and Kang Tae-san, gathered together.

Although some people were reluctant to join, there was no way to stop them, so they glared and took their seats.

"How do you think?"

Seo Jang-san asked from his chair in the meeting room. Kim Hui-yeon thought for a moment, her lips pursed.

"Isn't it just the same as saying it directly? If we simplify the meaning, it means the leader, or administrator. Isn't it just saying to systematize what has been there so far?"

"It's probably that way."

The group needed someone to lead them. The more people there were, the greater the need became.

With over 10,000 people, someone had to become the leader.
Here is the translation of the text:

"So I'll do it."

Seo Jang-san said so confidently, as if the decision had already been made.

"Is there anyone who's dissatisfied?"

The hardcore players nodded their heads in agreement, as if it was a natural assumption. They were all players from Yongin City.

Kim Hui-yeon was taken aback.

"Are you going to make me do it?"

"Yes, even if there's dissatisfaction?"

"No, there's none, actually......"

"There is."

Gang Jun-hyeok sneered.

"What do you believe in, telling me to be a king?"

"Because I'm the king, of course."

Seo Jang-san said confidently.

"I am the king of this place. You all came here like refugees. Wouldn't you follow the words of the lord of the land?"

"King? Refugee?"

Gang Jun-hyeok revealed his intentions.

"Don't joke! The purpose of the quest is just here, and you don't have the right to give us orders!"

"But this place has become the destination. Then, of course, you have to follow my words."

His words were filled with unwavering confidence, with not a hint of doubt. Gang Jun-hyeok twisted his lips and laughed mockingly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I know. You're already being called the king here, aren't you? Is that your word? Do you want to let go of that?"

"Yes."

Seo Jang-san looked at him with a questioning gaze as if asking what that meant.

Jang Jun-hyeok's face twitched in annoyance at his expressionless tone.

"That's why I'm the king, isn't it? The world is chaotic. A strong ruler is needed. I'll take on that role."

"Is that your duty?"

"Then who else would do it? You?"

Seo Jang-san scowled.

"No matter how strong you are, you're still just a child who hasn't grown up. Will people follow your words?"

......

Jang Jun-hyeok's mouth fell silent. He was definitely not yet an adult, and he was quite young among the players.

His words carried no weight. Although the world was full of strength, human nature was not that easily changed. People were more likely to ignore and not follow him because of his age.

Seo Jang-san said sharply.

"Then will you follow the words of a woman who can't even express her own opinions?"

"Me, me?"

Itealy, who had been quietly listening, jumped in surprise and pointed to herself.

She lacked the qualities of a leader. That was a proven fact from the previous world.
Here is the translation of the text:

He... is sufficient.

Tae-san smiled wryly.

Seo-jang-san turned his gaze away with effort.

"Who can trust a group with only three legitimate powers? Although there are many players in solo mode, they are not all weak. Are you sure you won't sacrifice us for your own sake?"

"Just a moment."

Kim Hwi-yeon, who had been listening quietly, scowled.

"Isn't it too much? Do it moderately."

"Hmm, I'm sorry. I got a bit carried away."

Seo-jang-san withdrew calmly and slapped the desk with his palm.

"There is none. Only I have the qualifications to govern and rule people."

His words were full of confidence, and there was no argument against them. Seo-jang-san looked at Tae-san with a scowling face.

"...Why aren't there any words?"

Tae-san was sending a joke without speaking. He had been prepared to hinder him in some way, but there was no movement at all.

Although he was anxious, there was no sign of interference. This was good for Seo-jang-san.

"I am the king. Is there any argument?"

"I don't have any, actually."
Here is the translation of the text:

Kim Hwi-yeon had a bright face.

Seo Jang-san's words were a bit harsh, but they were correct. Kang Jun-hyeok was too young, and Lee Tae-yeon was too indecisive.

On top of that, Tae-san flatly refused, so Seo Jang-san was reasonable.

"[The king has made a decision.] [Hard mode player. Seo Jang-san.]"

"Okay."

Seo Jang-san raised the corner of his mouth and moved his hand.

"Then I won't issue an edict."

"Huh."

Kim Hwi-yeon took a deep breath. She had a happy face.

"'Finally, I can take a break.'"

Managing the lives of everyone was a heavy burden. Tae-san said there was no one else suitable besides her, but she wanted to put it down.

Now, she thought she could entrust it to Seo Jang-san and move on.

After Seo Jang-san finished operating, he said:

"This is our law."

"[The king has issued an order.]"

A system window appeared before them. Kim Hwi-yeon's face stiffened with a light heart.
Here is the translation:

[As for the players in easy and normal modes, they will be allowed to eat. If there is no significant achievement, they will only be given one meal a day.]

[Do not refuse the words of hard mode players. If you refuse without a valid reason, there will be punishment.]

[Food supply and external reconnaissance are exclusive to either easy or normal players. If you don't comply, food will not be provided.]

[When playing as a hard mode player, you must bow your head and show respect. If you refuse, there will be punishment.]

...

There were more than ten commands like this.

It was all similar content.

“......What's this?”

“Uh......”

Kim Hwi-yeon asked with a trembling voice. Kim Jung-geun stared at the system window with a stiff face. Kang Jun-hyeok scrunched up his face, and Lee Tae-yeon turned pale.

“This is the king's first decree.”

“What nonsense is this?”

Kim Hwi-yeon stood up from her seat. Her eyes were filled with confusion.

Kim Hwi-yeon knew that the king demanded laws from people, and that he claimed to be the king.

However, she didn't think much about it. To manage tens of thousands of people, someone had to take charge.

Various noises and self-proclaimed opinions emerged. It was not an easy task to control them all.

It might be a bit extreme, but it's necessary to govern people. She thought that way.

But this was beyond her expectations.

Each command was too extreme and authoritarian. Restricting food, refusing words, showing respect and bowing one's head...
Here is the translation of the text:

"'This is a completely class-based society! You're just assigning roles!' Kim Hui-yeon shouted roughly.

The normal mode players of Yong-in's Ji-ah had refused to talk to her before. She realized that something was strange and investigated various things.

However, nothing unusual came out. The hard mode players said there was no problem, and Seo Jang-san said that this was the world, so how could they be happy?

Kim Hui-yeon accepted it without thinking.

It wasn't that she was foolish, but rather a problem with her values.

Since she believed that everyone should work together to overcome desperate situations, she didn't think that such oppression would exist.

"What's wrong with that?"

Seo Jang-san's face was one that couldn't understand.

"Of course. Hui-yeon."

"Hui-yeon!"

Kim Hui-yeon's voice rose. She barely composed herself and began to talk slowly and calmly.

"What's the point of allowing people to eat?"

"We don't have much food. It's impossible to provide enough for tens of thousands of people. So, we're setting limits.""

Note: The context of the story seems to be a post-apocalyptic or dystopian setting, where the characters are struggling to survive.
Here is the translation of the text:

"...don't say that, what's the point?"

"We're protecting them, so they need the benefits, you know."

"There's no reason to send them out to Jiya and Normal, we can make a better outcome for ourselves..."

"Why do we have to do that?"

"What?"

Soo-jang-san stared at Kim Hui-yeon with a puzzled expression.

"The outside is dangerous. Monsters are everywhere. Even the hardest mode players can't guarantee 100% safety."

"...so you're going to ask someone else to do it?"

"They can only show their value by doing that, that's all."

Soo-jang-san spoke flatly.

"Players in Jiya and Normal mode can't win against monsters. Even if they win, the efficiency is very poor. So they can only do one thing: gather food outside."

"...and many people will die in the process?"

"What's the point of that?"

Soo-jang-san's face was completely bewildered.

Kim Hui-yeon finally understood the meaning of his words.
Here is the translation of the text:

Until now, Seo Jang-san had been quite arrogant, but he had maintained a certain boundary. Therefore, Kim Hwi-yeon did not have any particular thoughts.

However, this was because the opponent was a player who played in the same hard mode as him, and he was considered to be on the same level as himself.

On the contrary, if the opponent was not considered to be on the same level, it meant that there was no boundary.

Kim Hwi-yeon clenched her teeth.

"So, I'll kill them all?"

"No, I won't kill them. I'll just do my own job."

Seo Jang-san spoke calmly.

"We are in hard mode. We are the ones who lead everyone. It's a natural right."

"You, you guys."

Kim Hwi-yeon looked at the other hard mode players with a horrified face.

"Do you think the same?"

"What...?"

"It's not a wrong statement...".

Everyone did not directly express their agreement, but they showed signs of agreeing with Seo Jang-san. Only Kim Hwi-yeon and Geum Jung-geun were bewildered.

"Ah...".

Kim Hwi-yeon suddenly realized. She and the other hard mode players who had come to Yongin with her had had a long conversation with Seo Jang-san.

"You guys!"

Kim Hwi-yeon couldn't help but shout.

"So, what's the difference between us and the beasts? If we're weak and abandoned, what's the difference?"

Note: The text appears to be a dialogue between two characters, Kim Hwi-yeon and Seo Jang-san, and possibly other characters, and is likely from a Korean novel or drama.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Different. We're human beings."

Seojang-san responded. Kim Hwi-yeon gritted her teeth.

"You and I are just different people."

She realized that her values and Seojang-san's values were fundamentally different, and that they couldn't come together in some areas.

"I understand your values. But... treating them like slaves is something I can't accept."

"Do it your way."

Seojang-san looked at Kim Hwi-yeon expressionlessly.

"But this is the right answer. If you only survive in hard mode, you'll be fine."

"Hmm."

Tae-san murmured quietly.

A sudden silence fell. Seojang-san asked, "What did you say?"

"Really? Is this the right answer? You're mistaken."

"...Is that what I meant to say?"

"That's not something you can say. The fact that normal players are weak is true. But... is there a big difference between you and them?"

Tae-san remembered.

As time passed, a stronger monster emerged. Hard mode players who faced saints and S-grade monsters were unable to resist.
Here is the translation of the text:

The problem is how long they can last, and even hardcore players ultimately became useless.

Their goal was victory. From this perspective, it's like they both failed.

"And what a foolish thing to do. You're not strong enough, you know."

Even at the moment of clearing, the difference between easy, normal, and hard modes wasn't that great in the middle process.

As an individual, the difference was significant, but as a group, it wasn't.

The majority of players were in easy and normal modes. It's hard to find a hardcore player among 1,000 players.

"Can you resist if all easy and normal modes are targeting you? If they trample you and tear you apart, can you survive?"

The group trembled at the whisper of the mountain.

Without a skill like a block, even an attack below their defense would deal 1 damage.

If they're pushed with sheer violence, the current hardcore players would be helpless and die.

'The one with a good head is indeed.'

Easy mode player. Choi Jung-hyeok.
Here is the translation of the text:

Lee Ji and the normal mode players formed an alliance, and when the time was right, they launched a rebellion. They killed many hard mode players, including Seo Jang-san.

Although Lee Ji and the normal mode players had suffered heavy losses, they were able to win.

"'And it was over'."

Countless people had died. Especially, many hard mode players had died. They were unable to block the incoming waves and only a few survived.

So, when they returned next time, they couldn't withstand it, and Kim Hwi-yeon sacrificed herself to save the people.

Seo Jang-san left behind a miserable failure and was forgotten.

In this world, Choi Jung-hyeok was no longer around, but the accumulated anger and resentment would somehow burst forth. Seo Jang-san had a high probability of failing again.

"'I don't care about your lives or deaths.'"

He barely paid attention to the lives of Lee Tae-yeon, Kang Jun-hyeok, Geum Jung-geun, Kim Hwi-yeon, and a few others.

When people realized that Kang Tae-san was truly indifferent to their lives, they felt a chill run down their spines.

"'But what do you think?'"

Kim Hwi-yeon's lips tightened as she looked at Seo Jang-san.

After a moment of contemplation, Kim Hwi-yeon spoke up.

"Seo Jang-san, I cannot accept this. So, I will request a change in the king's decree."
Here is the translation of the text:

"I'm sorry, but that's impossible."

Seojang Mountain had a bold attitude.

"What did you read in the explanation?"

[There are a few cases where the king can be replaced.] [Condition 1: The king's death.] [Condition 2: The request of a majority of players with qualifications.] [Condition 3: The king's voluntary resignation.]

"I don't think I'll go down on my own. The second condition is the same. Hard mode players are all on my side, excluding you two."

Seojang Mountain raised his upper lip.

"Or are you thinking of killing me? Will you accept the penalty?"

It was written in the quest explanation that the one who killed the king would have a great penalty. Since the system said so, it meant that it had a significant impact.

"So, all hard mode players will be your enemies."

"...I don't know the way."

Kim Hui-yeon bit her lips. At first, there was no way to send the king down. That's why Seojang Mountain revealed his true nature as soon as he became king.

"But someone knows."

Kim Hui-yeon turned her gaze solemnly.

"This... is what you said, right?"
Here is the translation of the text:

As Kang Tae-san headed towards Yongin, he told her, "Even if I'm strong, I can't lead people well just because I'm strong. It's because of their choice."

She understood the meaning of his words.

"Now, I'm done. I've understood enough."

Kang Tae-san nodded and said to Seo Jang-san, who was confident of his victory, "Why is there no method? There's a second one, isn't there?"

"Ah, all the hard mode players except for two support me. You're just making empty noise."

Seo Jang-san teased Kang Tae-san.

"That's not what I said."

Kang Tae-san raised his hand, as if swearing an oath.

"I request a change of the king."

And the system window appeared in front of everyone.

[A player with qualifications requested a change of the king. If the majority of players agree, the request will be granted.] [There is no other qualified player. The request has been accepted.] [You can change the king using various methods such as debate, duel, or struggle. Please make your choice.]

Seo Jang-san's eyes widened as the system window appeared in front of him.

Kang Tae-san smiled coldly.

"I told you, didn't I? Next time, I'll kill you."
