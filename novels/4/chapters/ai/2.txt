Episode 3

3. Easy Mode Player (3)

Taesan sees the monsters.

Monster 7, as big as a house-sized jellyfish.

And Monster 5, floating in the air with tentacles like an octopus.

"As long as it's not a defensive type."

Attack type, defense type, ranged type, melee type, brainwashing type, etc. Monsters come in various types.

The monsters' information is concealed, so it cannot be determined. The only way to find out is to fight, and in the process, many people have died.

Of course, it didn't matter to Taesan.

"You have activated full reconnaissance." [Monster 7] [Defense Type] [Health: 148,551,233/148,551,233]

Taesan's face twisted.

"148 million? Are they really playing around?"

What's that? Isn't it a blood bag that can't be killed even if all of humanity gathers together and attacks at once?

Taesan barely contained his anger and checked the remaining one.

[Monster 5] [Ranged Attack Type] [Health: 1,255,212/1,255,212]

"Well, at least this one seems manageable."
Still, it's 1.25 million. Thinking about a normal monster, there was no answer.

"Ugh."

Taesan let out a deep sigh.

If the one here was Itaeyeon, it would have been easier.

She, who cleared the Alone Mode, has innate stats and legendary equipment.

Since defense types cannot deal damage to Itaeyeon, she would quickly clear out the ranged attackers first and either ignore the defense types altogether or deal with them slowly.

Clear the attack types first and handle the defense types later. It's an extremely textbook approach. Other players would likely act the same.

Unfortunately, Taesan is a malformed player.

His stats are at the Easy Mode player level. His equipment remained the same as when he entered the labyrinth, where player-to-player exchanges are impossible.

All he could rely on was one skill.

"Hoo."

Taesan controls his whole body.

Unstoppable power, immune to all abnormal statuses for five minutes. Dealing with that side was easier.

Thump.

Taesan slammed the ground.

[You activated Physical Time Acceleration.]

Taesan's body speeds up. The body itself accelerates to an incomparable speed compared to usual.

Zoom zoom zoom.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

Monster 5's tentacles moved towards the speeding Taesan. The tentacles aimed at Taesan, their tips glowing with a green light.

"Kiiiiing!"

A beam shot out from the tentacle's end. Moving at the speed of light, it hit Taesan directly, erasing everything in its path.

[Your first attack nullification has been activated.] [You received 0 damage.]

Clearing the system messages, Taesan thought to himself.

"So it's a form of attack aimed directly in the direction the tentacle points. No delay. It seems impossible to dodge once seen. All I can do is predict."

He quickly grasped the situation. The longer he hesitated in understanding his opponent, the lower his chances of survival.

Taesan made a swift decision.

"In that case..."

Taesan changed direction. Instead of running straight ahead, he moved sideways, confusing the monster.

Ssshluk.

The tentacle moved, its tip glowing with green light. Taesan swiftly leaped away.

"Kiiing!"

The light of destruction erased everything in its path. Its power reached several kilometers, enough to erase even hard players in a single blow.

Taesan evaded the attack.

"If I'm determined to evade, I can avoid it after all."
However, it's difficult to approach that way. What if he minimizes evasion and tries to approach? The answer quickly came out.

"No evasion."

The density of the light emanating from the tentacles is high. If you approach closely, you will definitely be hit at least once.

There were a few answers.

The first is to deliberately evade. By using several skills, all attacks can be avoided, and by approaching slowly in this way, eventually, you can reach it.

It's orthodox, but at the same time, it's an impossible method for Taesan.

Skills are consumable. His weak mana pool is being slowly but surely depleted. He had to tidy up as quickly as possible.

"Tsk."

In the end, as always, he has to take a gamble. Taesan hunched down and unleashed his gathered power.

[You have activated super-acceleration.]

The air bursts. Taesan's body speeds up.

Super-acceleration. A rushing skill that easily surpasses the speed of sound. Taesan often used it because it allowed him to quickly close in on his opponent.

But the drawback was clear. During the rush, he couldn't use evasive movements. Monster 5's tentacles were aimed at him.

"Kiiing!"

A green beam fills Taesan's field of vision. Taesan kicked off and accelerated even more.
[Your second attack nullification has been activated.] [You receive 0 damage.]

Squirm.

Monster 5 was taken aback. It had no face, but Taesan could sense it.

'The attack nullification is over now.'

Unfortunately, he couldn't create any further nullification skills. But thanks to that, he had come within reach. Taesan gripped his sword.

Just as he was about to attack Monster 5, Monster 7 appeared with its massive body.

Kuung!

Monster 7 assumed a posture that seemed to envelop Taesan. When long-range attackers are in danger, defenders protect them. That must be their combination.

However, Taesan smiled.

"You fell for it."

[You have triggered Forced Duel. For the next minute, except for Monster 7, no one can deal damage to you.]

A golden barrier enveloped Monster 7 and Taesan. Monster 5 fired a beam, but the barrier didn't even waver.

To Taesan, whether it's a defender or an attacker doesn't make much difference. "Endurance" is just a term in hardcore or solo player stories. With his weak stats and equipment, even if he were a defender, he would go down in one hit.

So, he'd rather take out the annoying defender with high health first.

Taesan gripped his sword.
[You have activated Addition. Your current attack power is doubled.] [You have activated Multiplication. Your current attack power is squared.] [You have activated Absolute Judgment. It ignores the opponent's defense skill.]

Addition that doubles your attack power.

Multiplication that squares your attack power.

Truly overwhelming skills.

But it's not enough.

With my basic stats being so low, even with addition and multiplication, it only amounts to 9,604. It's not enough to penetrate the monster with billions of health.

So, once again.

[You have activated Skill Reset. This skill cannot be activated for a month.] [You have reset Multiplication.] [You have activated Multiplication. Your current attack power is squared.]

9,604 squared.

But it's still not enough.

I still can't reach billions.

So, to the limit.

Taesan grits his teeth. Mana drains out of his entire body.

[You have activated Copycat. The next attack is applied twice.] [Your attack.] [92,236,816 damage to Monster 7.] [92,236,816 damage to Monster 7.] [Monster 7 has been defeated.]

It disappears without leaving a trace. Taesan barely holds onto his trembling body. Monster 5 points its tentacles at him.

Keiiing.
The beam swallows Taesan.

[You take 22,543 damage.] [Your Endurance is activated. The fatal attack is nullified. All damage is reduced to 0 for 5 seconds.]

Unlike nullifying attacks, there is only one Endurance. Taesan quickly charges towards Monster 5. The tentacles move, but if it's this close-range, it's actually easier to dodge.

From now on, it's not difficult. It's a simple repetition of dodging and attacking.

But Taesan's expression wasn't good.

[Mana 21/820]

A weak mana flow emerged. Multiplication cannot be used.

He had to reduce 1.25 million purely through normal attacks.

Taesan swung his sword.

[48 damage to Monster 5.]

Simply put, he had to strike 25,000 times.

"I feel like I'm losing my mind."

With only the minimum defense-piercing skills, a long and grueling battle began.

* * *

[54 damage to Monster 5.]

The sun and moon appear and disappear in the world repeatedly. At some point, Taesan lost track of the concept of time.

"Damn it."
Suddenly, Taesan regains his senses and looks at the opponent's health.

[Health: 655,212/1,255,212]

There's a saying that you should think there's only half left, but as far as Taesan is concerned, it's nonsense. It's already torturous enough. The thought of having to repeat this much makes him nauseous.

"Sigh."

But with just a sigh, Taesan moves.

He dodges the beam and swings his sword.

[50 damage to Monster 5.]

Time passes.

Once again, the sun and moon appear in a repetitive cycle. Players are resilient to desires, but at this rate, Taesan is starting to get hungry too. Due to lack of sleep, the tip of his sword trembles.

But his determination remains unchanged.

Time continues to pass. At some point, it reaches a stage where it's not the mind moving the body, but the body moving the mind.

And it comes to an end.

[You enter a state of total immersion. Body and mind become one.] [A miraculous power is engraved in your soul. You obtain the Soul Skill [Soul Strike Enhancement].] [Since you have escaped the labyrinth, you did not acquire the skill. [Soul Strike Enhancement] is sealed.]

"It's noisy."
He shuts down the system window in English that he doesn't understand.

Taesan barely holds onto his trembling legs. Looking around, it was a ruin. Everything was smashed and collapsed, the cityscape vanished without a trace, replaced by a valley.

Taesan spat on the ground.

"Damn it."

[48 damage to Monster 5.] [Monster 5 has fallen.] [The gods across all dimensions cannot help but be astonished by your feat.]

The cost of cutting down 1.25 million health purely through time was substantial. Even standing up was a challenge.

Taesan managed to move his trembling lips.

"...Status window."

[Gang Taesan] [Level: 57] [Health: 1/1021] [Mana: 2/820] [Strength: 105] [Intelligence: 100] [Agility: 98] [Attack +49] [Defense +58] [Target is in a critical condition.]

It was a dire status window.

It felt like he had fought for well over a month.

"Damn stats deficiency."

Even a normal player would have found this easier.

But he emerged victorious.

He had defeated two S-rank enemies, a feat even Itaeyeon couldn't guarantee.
He moved his body with trembling legs. Since he had no mana left to use for a big leap, he had no choice but to walk back.

Fortunately, his mana and health recovered somewhat as he walked. When his mana reached around 20, the city came into view.

There were no monsters in sight.

But Taesan's face twisted in distress.

[You have activated Full Reconnaissance.]

All information about the surroundings is visible in map form. Blue dots represent humans. Red dots represent monsters.

There were no blue dots in sight.

The only visible dot was a large red dot within the city.

"Damn it all."

Taesan cursed as he headed towards the city. As he got closer, he saw corpses.

Familiar faces. They were the ones he had spent time with, having casual conversations until recently.

They were all dead.

"You boasted about being one of the rare hardcore players, and yet why am I the only one alive in this easy difficulty? Why did I win and come back to find everyone dead?"

He vented his complaints. With an exasperated expression, he entered the city.
Inside the city, there were even more corpses. Among them was Jung-geun's body. His face was peaceful.

"Looks like he went just like he said."

Next to him was also the body of Lee Chang-chun.

Judging from his expression, it seemed he had come to accept his fate in the end.

Taesan passed by the bodies. At the end of the trail of bodies lay one more corpse.

"Lee Tae-yeon."

The lone survivor in a world cleared on the Alone difficulty. Evaluated as the strongest human in the world.

She was lying there, miserably dead.

And the monster that killed her is here.

*Grrrr.*

A horrifying something creeps closer. An indescribable creature stares at him beside Lee Tae-yeon's corpse.

Something beyond S rank. People dubbed that monster with the name "Apostle."

[!#$!# gaze.] [You die instantly.]

An absolute gaze with no room for judgment. It's a declaration of instant death that even players on Hard difficulty cannot resist. It's known that Lee Tae-yeon was the only one who managed to endure it.

Taesan clenches his fist nervously.

"Clear out."

[Resistance Successful.]

*Grrrr.*

Taesan picks up his sword. He strikes the monster with nervous determination.
The ultimate monster that not even Lee Tae-yeon could defeat.

"[You have triggered Essence Strike.] [$#!!!# damage.]"

*Grrrr!*

The monster writhes in agony. Taesan clenches his fists roughly.

"Come on. Bring it on, you bastard."
