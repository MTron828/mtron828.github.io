Episode 34

34. 4th Floor, Guardian of Victory. Valtahara (3)

To achieve that, leveling up is the priority. A barrier of 12 won't suffice.

Taesan enters the next room.

*Gulp.*

[An orc wielding a spear appears.]

The orc rushes towards Taesan as if it had been waiting, spear in hand.

*Clang!*

The sword and spear clash. The intense pressure conveyed that the opponent's stats were considerably high.

Through Valtahara's Trial, the orcs had also been strengthened.

As they progressed through the rooms, they grew stronger and stronger, and the orc before him now possessed enough strength to handle about two ordinary orcs effortlessly.

Of course, it wasn't easy.

Taesan's stats were at a level that even hardcore players would barely reach after delving deep.

What was a challenging opponent for him now would be considered impossible for other players to handle.

Even though it was an enhanced trial, it wasn't a boss, and the sixth monster shouldn't be this difficult.

Yet, he was struggling to defeat it easily.

The spear spins around. It tries to grab Taesan's sword and deflect it away.
The Pinnacle of Technique. There's no chance against an opponent countered with technique.

*You've activated a counter. You retaliate against the next opponent's attack.*

Your body moves naturally. The sword pushes aside the spear and bends the orc.

*Krrrr...*

The orc falls. Counter. Forced counterattack technique. If techniques that the body doesn't naturally respond to can also be countered, they will be countered.

The problem is, this process leaves no trace on the body. No matter how much it is used, it could not be used without the skill being activated.

"It's difficult."

Despite having stats overwhelming against orcs, he couldn't do it all because of spear and swordsmanship.

He didn't know where he learned it, but all orcs had considerable skills.

He easily brushed off Taesan's sword with swordsmanship he had learned from training and practice rather than actual combat.

Gradually, he seemed to recognize the importance of systematic techniques. Weapon techniques learned through training and practice are not bad, but they are clearly limited. Here, they are expressed through skills.

So far, have communicated
But I can't learn it. Despite trying to mimic the orc's actions, seeing that it doesn't manifest in the form of a skill, it seemed that he needed to learn from someone's teachings for the skill to appear.

[…….]

The ghost said nothing.

Taesan headed towards the next room. This time, an orc with an axe awaited him.

*Krrrr.*

Taesan raised his sword.

* * *

As he passed through the rooms, the orcs became stronger and their skills improved, but they couldn't stop Taesan.

His stats still gave him the upper hand, and no matter how skilled his opponents were, he could still counter them.

Taesan managed to reach the boss room without much difficulty.

"It's over quickly."

The god of victory turned the labyrinth into a straight line to sprint through. With things like this, he became curious about one thing.

"How do you find these secret rooms?"

There is one secret room on each floor.

But with the labyrinth changing like this, he couldn't know what would happen in the future.
Once I clear the 4th floor, I was thinking of looking for it. Since there are only ten rooms, I thought I might find it eventually if I keep repeating the process.

*Ding.*

[Kang Junhyuk invited Lee Taeyeon and Kang Taesan.]

When Taesan tried to enter the boss room, he received a call.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: What's up?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Oh, you answered right away. What were you up to?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: I was about to go boss hunting.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: So are you already on the 5th floor... You're really fast.] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: So what's up?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Well, it's about me and Taeyeon noona. We cleared the 1st floor. I wanted to tell you that.]

Clearing the 1st floor. It meant they finally caught the Giant Rat. Coincidentally, Lee Taeyeon appeared as well.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Oh, I thought you were dead.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Noona's here too. How's the 2nd floor?] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Why are there so many monsters popping up like this? Is this really the 2nd floor?]

Lee Taeyeon grumbled for a moment and soon recognized Taesan and greeted him.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Hello, Mr. Taesan.] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: How did it go?]
Taesan asked about how to catch the Giant Rat.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: I just oiled it up and threw a Molotov. Upon closer inspection, it seemed the boss couldn't leave its room. It lasted a few minutes before it died on its own.]
[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: I didn't like that either, but there didn't seem to be any other way. So, I had to grind it out.]

Taeyeon implemented the method she had used in the past. She threw fire and ran away to wait. It was a safe method where she could catch it for sure without risking her life. With this method, she could handle most crises.

However, Taesan didn't do that.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: But maybe it's because it's a dirty trick, but there's no reward for a difficult enemy like Taesan. The level-up rewards are also not much higher than expected.]

The reward for defeating a difficult enemy is obtained by fighting them head-on. The rewards for leveling up are not significantly increased just by setting fire and running away.

It was a safe act, but it took away the future.
[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Well, there was no other way, so I had no choice. Where else could I have caught it?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: So, did you gain any skills?]

Taesan had discussed skills in the community.

It was time to check if there had been any progress.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Um... I gained Breath Control and Pain Reduction for now.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Me too. How do you acquire Unyielding Will and Endurance? Even trying to fight, I couldn't concentrate because of the pain.]

Taesan was surprised when he saw Taeyeon's post.

"Learned Breath Control?"

Taesan had discussed Breath Control in his previous world. But Taeyeon hadn't learned it. She had already delved deep and had refused, saying she didn't want to take risks.

"Is it because of the situation's difference?"

Was it the time when he had finished adapting to the labyrinth or the time when he was just beginning to adapt?

That difference seemed to have made Taeyeon make a decision.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: What about the others?] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: ...None yet. I'm sorry.]

She looked apologetic, but Taesan had already anticipated it, his expression grim.

To live or to die.
Before standing at that crossroads, they wouldn't have seemed like they would act. Kang Junhyuk left a heated comment as if he couldn't understand it.

[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Even if you say it's good, she wouldn't try to learn it.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Breathless attack is really good. I didn't imagine that gaining freedom in breathing would be this beneficial.] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: Did I tell you to learn it for no reason? It's good to have unyielding will or endurance, but if you can't master it, there's nothing you can do.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Because I felt like I was really going to die while doing it... It just wouldn't work.]

They roughly confirmed the skills and cleared the area. Taesan began to talk about the second floor they had arrived at.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: It seems like we've seen the monsters on the second floor, how was it?] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: ... Are you telling me to break through this?]

Taeyeon said in disbelief.

It was a natural reaction after seeing the second floor. The Big Rat was difficult, but had low damage and usually moved alone. If you were determined to respond, it wouldn't be impossible.

But the second floor had four goblins in one shot. It was very difficult to overcome them because each one had strength similar to Taeyeon's.
[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Figure it out yourself. You should be able to come up with something.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: ... Do you trust me that much? We barely made it through the first floor using tricks.] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: It's a simple fact. You are perfectly capable.]

Taeyeon had cleared the solo mode. Even though it was through trickery, the results spoke for themselves. After a brief silence, Taeyeon responded.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Thank you.]

After that, Taesan roughly explained about the goblins. He couldn't reveal the exact answers, but he could discuss their characteristics to some extent.

During their conversation, the topic shifted to an altar.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: While wandering the second floor, you might come across the Altar of Rakiratas. They might offer a quest. Don't accept it.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: ... Seems dangerous. Alright.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: What do they give? I want to take it if they do.]

Through their discussion, it became clear. Kang Junhyuk and Lee Taeyeon had completely opposite personalities.

Taeyeon avoided anywhere she deemed dangerous. She missed out on a lot, but it helped her survive.

In contrast, Kang Junhyuk wanted to challenge everything at least once. Perhaps due to his young age, he had no fear.

It wasn't clear which approach was better. If Junhyuk's methods allowed him to survive, he could gain a lot, making it closer to the correct answer.
However, the Altar of Rakiratas was not part of the correct answer.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Don't do it. If it's another god, fine, but not Rakiratas. If you accept, you're a hundred percent dead, so filter it out.]

Even defeating the fake types of Rakiratas was impossible. They were capricious opponents. The judgment was that the risks outweighed the rewards.

However, Kang Junhyuk remained unsatisfied until the end.

[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Um... I'm tempted... but how can I not do it?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: It's a problem if Taeyeon is too scared and it's a problem if you're not scared. Let me give you a simple example. You didn't get it because you were too scared to endure it, right?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Yes. How on earth can I get it?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: If you accept it, maybe you can get it?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: What... Ah.] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: Gain it or lose it. It's one or the other. If you're confident, take the quest.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: ... Okay.]

Only then did Junhyuk seem convinced. Taesan frowned.

"If I don't take care of this for sure, it'll cause trouble."
Having a sense of challenge is good. However, he should have known his limits. If he continued like this, Kang Junhyuk would most likely die.

"I should do some training."

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Then good luck. I'm off to clear the rest.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Where are you now?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Right in front of the 5th floor.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: ...Wow.]

Taesan closed the community window. A ghost that had been waiting boringly now stirred.

"Is it over now?"

"Yeah."

Taesan entered the room. Inside, an orc was waiting for him.

[An orc warrior appeared.]

The warrior. Among orcs, only the chosen ones can reach this position, and their strength surpasses that of ordinary orcs.

"The boss is the same."

Taeyeon had also encountered a warrior on the 4th floor. However, strengthened by Valta's trial, this one was much stronger. As Taesan prepared himself, something caught his eye.

"Uh..."

A woman was trembling in a corner of the wall.
Here is the translation of the Korean text into English:

It was a person. Taesan's eyes flickered. With long, blue hair tied back, she was crouched like a squirrel. Her impressive golden robe covered her entire body.

"Hey, why is she here?"

"Do you know her?"

"I do know her... but how is she still alive? I thought she'd die soon."

A human known to the warrior. That meant she was likely an NPC. The question was why she was cowering and trembling in the boss's room.

"Uh... huh?"

The trembling woman nervously glanced around and locked eyes with Taesan.

"...An adventurer?"

"Hello?"

"...Warrior?"

She suddenly stood up and rushed over, clutching a wooden staff in one hand.

"Please save me!"

She urgently hid behind Taesan. The ghost chuckled.

"Why are you acting like this here?"

"I-I don't know. The maze suddenly changed, and I was chased out. When I came to my senses, there was an orc right next to me. Oh, God. What on earth is this?"

The woman stammered and muttered. Taesan realized.

"This secret room must be an NPC."

Forced out as the maze changed, she appeared to be an NPC.

"You have encountered a lowly one seeking magic."
