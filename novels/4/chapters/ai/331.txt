**Chapter 332**

**332 (Extra Story). The Earth on the Brink of Destruction. Lee Tae-yeon (2)**

Lee Tae-yeon made an effort.

She started by cleaning up the city. She single-handedly took care of all the monsters lurking near the residential areas where people lived.

Next, she organized the city's interior. She led people, selected those with construction experience, and began building. Until now, they had no time to spare due to the monsters' attacks, but with Lee Tae-yeon around, they could finally take a breather and tidy up their homes.

After that, she started managing the people who appeared. She showed them hope, preventing them from falling into despair, and gave them the confidence to survive on Earth.

She gathered people with good eyesight and survival-related skills to form a defense team. She also used the items she had without hesitation.

"Let's install one of these at each corner of the territory."

She handed four small, black stakes to Taesan.

"What's this?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"An item that forms a barrier to block intruders. If an enemy breaks through the barrier, it sends a warning."

The depths were extremely unique. There were cases where monsters overflowed in the jungle, and one had to survive for several months.

It was an item purchased at a high price for such a situation. Taesan planted a stake in the corner of the territory.

Weak monsters were blocked by the stake's power and couldn't enter, and if strong monsters that could overcome the stake entered, a loud warning sounded. Thanks to this, people could prepare in advance.

Not only was Lee Taeyeon's personal strength great, but the many items she possessed also exerted tremendous power.

As she returned to Earth, various problems were quickly resolved.

"Wow!"

"Lee Taeyeon-nim!"

"If Taeyeon-ssi is here!"

The gaze of the people towards her grew even stronger.

Lee Taeyeon barely endured the rising district's gaze and said to them:

"I'll protect you all."

No.

In reality, she wished someone would protect her.

She didn't want to lead people or take responsibility for their lives.

But she couldn't say those words.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She always wore a mask of laughter and confidence.

The only thing she could do was to scream at the top of her lungs when she was alone, venturing out of her territory.

"Aaahhh...."

She let out a dying scream and collapsed onto the broken sofa.

As soon as she heard her own voice, a monster burst out of the wall.

[Monster 978 has appeared.]

"Get lost."

Kwaaaang!

She swung her arm while sitting on the sofa, and the three-digit monster that was charging at her was defeated.

"No way..."

She bit her lip. The monster that had charged at her had already disappeared from her mind.

She was also reaching her limit on acting. If she continued like this, she would eventually show her weak side to people.

That couldn't happen.

The object of trust must not be shaken. She had to be always confident and full of herself. That was the only way people would believe they could win.

As she was thinking of a way, a painting on the wall caught her eye.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The place she had just entered was the ruins of a high-rise building, which was originally a luxurious residence for the wealthy.

Perhaps that's why the undamaged decorations and paintings were still visible.

The paintings were like those created by a famous artist.

“…….”

Although she wasn't particularly interested, she carefully took the painting with her as she returned to her territory.

“Tae-yeon, what's that?”

“It's pretty, so what? Isn't it cool?”

Tae-yeon smiled brightly as she held up the painting.

“In a world that's falling apart, it's precisely because of these small hobbies that we can find hope. They become a thread of hope in our desolate lives.”

“Ooh…….”

“That's right!”

People nodded their heads vigorously in agreement.

From then on, people began to find their own hobbies. Some carved decorations out of concrete, while others painted.

Just as she had said, these small hobbies had a profoundly positive impact on people. The voices calling out to Tae-yeon grew louder.

Everyone revered her.

Everyone trusted her.

They believed without a doubt that she would save them.

Only Taesan, however, gazed at her with a skeptical expression and asked, “Are you okay?”

“What's wrong?”
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She smiled faintly.

"I'm supposed to do this, right? It's not that hard."

"......Is that so."

Taesan spoke calmly.

She was nervous. Had she been found out? No, she thought she was good at acting. In reality, everyone else trusted and believed in her.

It was just that she was really worried about herself. Lee Taeyeon thought so.

"I'll go rest for a bit. Call me if you need me."

"Okay."

Taesan replied.

Lee Taeyeon returned to her quarters and buried her face in her pillow.

"Hooooo......"

She let out a sigh and stretched her body, releasing the accumulated fatigue.

"It's hard."

She blurted out. She turned her body and gazed at the crack in the sky visible through the broken ceiling.

Chilling.

Just looking at it sent shivers down her spine. The power contained within was truly terrifying. She turned her gaze away.

'No one knows.'

Only she knew that she had no chance of winning.

The beings beyond the crack were not moving, but they would eventually.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, that's how it was.

Taeyeon clenched her fist.

After that, she continued to save people and wore a confident mask.

A year passed like that.

* * *

"Ah, Mr. Taeyeon."

A man standing in front of a huge wall greeted Taeyeon brightly. His complexion was good, and his hair was neatly arranged.

"Are you going on a reconnaissance mission? You've been going out frequently lately."

"Yes, I'll be back soon."

"Okay, come back safely."

Taeyeon received a sendoff and stepped out of their territory. She muttered to herself, confirming that she was alone.

"I've managed to survive somehow."

During the past year, Taeyeon had done her best.

As a result, the people's circumstances had improved significantly. Their territory had expanded, and the number of survivors was increasing.

Hope began to flicker on people's faces, and they started to believe they could survive.

However, Taeyeon was becoming increasingly anxious.

The power contained in the cracks in the sky was becoming more turbulent, as if it would burst out at any moment.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Something enormous was approaching. As she cleared the labyrinth, her senses, which had been honed, sounded an alarm.

"......Let's go take a look."

[You activated the hidden breath of a sleeping mouse.] [You activated a hidden story that no one knew.] [You activated an invisible shadow.]

Her presence disappeared.

Even if she was the guide of evil paths, or even the leader of the group, she couldn't detect the current Taeyeon.

The woman, who had hidden her body, took a step forward.

As she walked, she cleared all the monsters she encountered on the way and continued to investigate.

Finally, she arrived just below the crack.

"It's been a while since I've been here."

Taeyeon gazed up at the crack with a vacant expression.

As she approached, she could sense it more clearly. The power inside the crack was fluctuating wildly.

"Hmm."

[You activated a scrutinizing gaze.]

Her field of vision expanded.

All the powers, laws, and orders related to the objects around her entered her gaze.

She, who had been staring at the crack, stopped.

"What?"

The crack was expanding.

Something was starting to fall from the crack.

Kugugugugu!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The earth shatters with a loud noise. Lee Tae-yeon held her breath.

The creatures that fell from the crack were about ten in number.

The number wasn't that great. To Lee Tae-yeon, who had defeated tens of thousands of creatures, it was a ridiculously small number.

But the moment she confirmed the creatures' power, her entire body froze.

[Monster 3 appeared.] [Monster 9 appeared.] [Monster 10 appeared.] [Monster 43 appeared.]

...

...

Two single-digit monsters.

Eight double-digit monsters.

It was a level of monsters she had never seen before.

Gulp.

Her spirit scattered in all directions. All living things around her began to die.

The monsters didn't notice Lee Tae-yeon or ignored her and started to pass by.

Lee Tae-yeon couldn't do anything.

It wasn't until the monsters disappeared beyond the horizon that she barely managed to breathe out.

"Ugh!"

Sweat dripped down her face. Her entire body began to tremble with fear.

"...What's that?"

She barely managed to say.

It was strong."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Especially, the single-digit monster was one that she couldn't guarantee victory against, even if she risked her life to fight it.

"No way."

The fear of death overwhelmed her. It was the moment when she was about to move her body to flee in the opposite direction of where the monsters had moved.

She realized it too late.

The place where the monsters had moved was the area where the survivors were gathered.

Thousands of emotions flooded her mind in an instant.

"……Aaaaah!"

She roughly ran her hands through her hair, her eyes bloodshot. She stomped her feet.

A small gemstone appeared on Lee Tae-yeon's hand.

[You have activated the designated location space jump.]

"Huh?"

"Tae, Tae-yeon? Weren't you on a reconnaissance mission?"

People were shocked by Lee Tae-yeon's sudden appearance. Lee Tae-yeon shook her head roughly, scattering the broken gemstone.

"……Gather everyone. I have something to say."

* * *

Lee Tae-yeon called out to the people and said:

The single-digit and double-digit monsters are coming.

Even I, who am a strong fighter, can't guarantee victory against them.

We have to risk our lives to fight.

After Lee Tae-yeon finished speaking, no one could open their mouth. Everyone was frozen in silence.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"......Is it real? Miss Tae-yeon?"

"Then it's fake, right?"

Tae-yeon spoke sharply. The man who had asked cautiously took a step back, his body trembling.

"Ah, no... I'm sorry..."

Tae-yeon pressed her forehead.

There was no room for acting. Her heart was racing and her breathing was rough.

She barely suppressed her emotions and began to speak.

"......First, I'll try to handle as much as I can. But I can't block everything. I need to take care of a few dozen monsters."

"Ugh......"

"Damn it. Damn it. Damn it......"

After Tae-yeon's appearance, those who had forgotten their fear of death began to curse.

Tae-yeon turned her head.

Taesan was calmly looking at her, unaffected by the fear that had gripped everyone else.

She clenched her fist tightly.

"I can only block one single-digit monster. So, Taesan, you need to block the other one."

"Okay."

There was no refusal, no annoyance, no anger.

Taesan quietly accepted it.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The news spread quickly to the people. Although they were terrified, they grasped their weapons and prepared for the impending attack.

Lee Tae-yeon was no exception. She tried to put on a brave face, but she couldn't help her hands from trembling slightly.

To hide her true feelings, she spoke to Taesan.

"Unexpected."

"What is?"

"I thought you'd at least complain a little."

Taesan was in easy mode, but he had to face a monster that Lee Tae-yeon couldn't guarantee a win against.

He was certainly strong, but his strength was extremely limited. Depending on the opponent, there was a high possibility of a humiliating defeat.

However, Taesan spoke calmly.

"There's no one else who can do it, right? You'd be struggling too. So, let's do it."

He had made up his mind to risk his life in the fight.

Lee Tae-yeon stared at him blankly.

Taesan was strong.

Not just physically, but also mentally.

He was vastly different from herself.

Ku-u-u-ung......

But before she could get lost in thought, a loud rumbling sound came from afar. The eerie energy began to spread, and people's faces turned pale.

"Haha. It's here."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lee Tae-yeon let out a dry laugh and grasped her sword.

"Let's see... if I can survive this."

She stomped her foot.

She clenched her fist, facing the monsters approaching from afar.

[You activated the Shadow Veil skill.]

The world changed. The monsters' vision distorted, and Lee Tae-yeon's figure expanded.

Kuuuung!

They began to charge towards Lee Tae-yeon, and she licked her dry lips, creating distance between herself and the monsters.

"I never thought I'd use this skill like this."

Originally, it was a skill that hid her own figure and disrupted her opponent's movements.

But this time, she had to make herself the target. So, she hid the city and expanded her own figure.

Lee Tae-yeon, who had created enough distance, stopped in her tracks.

One monster with a single digit.

And six monsters with two digits.

She muttered gloomily.

"What are you guys, anyway."

Why are you tormenting me like this?

Why are you attacking the Earth?

Can't you just leave me alone?

Can't you just let me die quietly here?

Why. Why. Why.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Instant Death Judgment in progress...][You have activated the Nullification of Unfavorable Judgment.][Judgment Nullification!]

She gripped her sword tightly.

"If you're going to keep tormenting me... just die already."

She gritted her teeth. Her mind, exhausted from extreme stress, began to focus on anger.

Lee Tae-yeon roughly opened her inventory. She took out the equipment she had cherished for a long time.

It was a red staff with no patterns on it.

A red orb was attached to the end of the staff.

As soon as the staff appeared in the world, the air began to heat up. The temperature in a radius of several dozen kilometers suddenly rose by several degrees.

Lee Tae-yeon held up the staff.

"Burn to death."

[You have activated the Red Giant.]"
