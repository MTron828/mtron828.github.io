Chapter 352

352. 74th Floor, The Battlefield of the Immortals (5)

Taesan's advantage against the immortal was that the opponent lacked willpower.

The Declaration of Nullity exerted an almost absolute power over a target without willpower.

Suddenly!

As soon as the Declaration of Nullity was activated, the immortal's movements came to a halt. The mechanical devices that were spinning wildly stopped momentarily.

It was the moment when Taesan was about to stomp his foot.

Kiying!

A powerful force burst out from the immortal.

Taesan's Declaration of Nullity was forcibly undone, and dozens of beams of light were unleashed.

Kugugugugu!

Taesan barely dodged and clicked his tongue.

"No matter how lacking in willpower, an immortal is still an immortal."

To think that the Declaration of Nullity could be undone by force.

Taesan activated the Declaration of Nullity once again. The immortal once again unleashed its power to undo it.

The speed at which it did so was faster than when the Declaration of Nullity was first activated.

It seemed that a powerful constraint that could stop the opponent's actions could be undone by force.

Then...

"Slow down."

[You have activated the Declaration of Slowness.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Immortal is being covered in darkness. The mechanical devices that were visible to the eye have slowed down to a crawl.

Kiiiiing!

The beam of light poured down again, but it was possible to avoid it sufficiently.

And the Immortal, unlike the Declaration of Stop, was unable to release the Declaration of Slowness.

'As expected.'

The strong restraint that could stop the opponent's actions themselves could be released. However, it seemed that the partial restraint that affected the speed of actions could not be overcome.

Kiiiiing!

The beam of light pours down. Missiles fill the sky and rush towards the mountain.

The mountain clenches its fist.

[You have activated Magic Overlap.]

You overlap three starlight arrows and release them.

[You have activated Magic Explosion.]

You detonate the starlight arrow near the missile. The sky turns white.

Kiiing.

A red dot is embedded in the mountain's chest.

At the same time, something flew towards the red dot at an unimaginable speed. It was a power that could not be understood at all before activating the Declaration of Slowness.

The mountain quickly spreads its wings. The location of the red dot explodes, and the aftermath affects the moving mountain as well."

However, Taesan, who had grasped the explosion radius from the previous battle, had already gathered his magic in advance.

[You activated Marbas's Dark Wave.]

The dark wave engulfed the explosion.

The Immortal raised his arm. The mechanical devices that made up his arm expanded, and soon, tiny particles poured out.

Taesan, who had focused his gaze, could see what the particles were.

Kiying!

The particles moved freely and rushed towards Taesan. They were like drones, flying through the air and attacking. There were thousands of them.

Taesan quickly drew out his arrows. The arrows with willpower charged forward and collided with the particles.

Kuung!

The Immortal's chest opened, and a massive metal lump poured out like a wave.

Taesan used a limited blink to evade the attack that engulfed the entire space.

As soon as he dodged, a red dot was marked on Taesan's chest.

He tried to block it, but there was no time, and it was impossible.

Kuuuung!

[Your second attack, Absolute Nullification, was activated.]

Taesan was fighting fiercely.

He had activated the Declaration of Slowness, using every means to block the Immortal's attack.

But that was all.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was still an insurmountable power gap between the two.

And the Immortal's power was bottomless, with no end in sight.

A beam of light that burned the heavens and earth was destroying everything, pushing towards the Taesan.

The relentless force pushed Taesan to finally allow another strike.

[Your third attack has been absolutely nullified.] [Hmm...].

The ghost let out a sigh. The attack nullification had been completely consumed. His mana and magic were rapidly dwindling.

On the other hand, the Immortal's power was still endless, and Taesan couldn't even approach him.

The situation was clearly unfavorable.

But Taesan's expression was colder than anyone else's.

'I've roughly figured it out.'

The Immortal had no will of its own. It was a puppet controlled by the input of the reactions of the gods.

In other words, its behavior pattern was not much different from that of the 73rd floor's Malakos.

That meant that the pattern could be figured out, and now that understanding was complete.

What was left was to land a hit.

Taesan created a path for that.

Taesan inserted the materials he had prepared in advance into his wrist protector."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated a partial world change.]

A certain range of the world is transformed into the realm of Taesan. Taesan unleashes his power towards the scattering light.

[You have activated Naberiuse's golden sword.]

Ka-a-a-ang!

The golden sword collides with the light beam.

Until now, Taesan couldn't block the light beam and could only dodge, but not anymore. Taesan doesn't back down. He infuses power into the sword and takes a step forward.

Ka-a-a-ang!

The light beam splits into dozens of rays. Taesan stomps his foot firmly.

Ki-i-i-ing!

The immortal responds. An unimaginable amount of power is unleashed at once.

The partial world change and the immortal's power collide, causing the partial world change to distort.

It can't hold out for long. The overwhelming power pushes Taesan's mind to the limit.

This time, it's the end.

[You have activated the Devouring Desire of Destruction.] [You have activated the Call of Destruction.]

The powers of destruction burst forth and collide with the light beam.

They try to devour each other, creating an opening for Taesan to charge forward.

The immortal doesn't remain still either. He unleashes all his power to crush Taesan.

Note: Taesan appears to be a character's name, and Naberiuse is likely the name of a sword or a powerful entity. The text seems to be describing a fantasy battle scene with powerful abilities and clashes between characters.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan evaded and blocked those attacks.

As he approached, the Immortal's power grew stronger and faster, but Taesan had already grasped the pattern of the fight up until now.

Taesan was able to reach the Immortal's proximity without taking any damage.

Kiiiiing!

As he reached a certain distance, the Immortal's machinery went crazy and accelerated. It overheated, and smoke started pouring out.

A power that distorted space concentrated on the Immortal's chest.

Taesan instinctively realized. This was the decisive moment.

Taesan charged forward. He ignored all defense and flew towards the Immortal.

A light was shot out.

It was a light that divided the world.

A overwhelming power that pierced the sky and affected the universe, an unstoppable force.

A deadly light that could not be dodged, countered, or blocked engulfed Taesan.

[You took 1,323,241 damage.] [Your 'Berti' skill was activated. The deadly attack was nullified. All damage will be 0 for 1 second.]

And at the moment it touched Taesan, it disappeared.

Chiik!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As the overheated Immortal's body began to cool down, Taesan rushed towards him in an instant. By the time the duration of the endurance was about to end, the distance between Taesan and the Immortal was only one step away.

As he approached to a close distance, the Immortal's power was directly felt. The concentrated power took his breath away. The pressure was so intense that it seemed to crush Taesan's spirit.

[You activated the Adventurer's Will.]

With the Adventurer's Will, you overcame the mental pressure and unleashed your power against the pouring light.

[You activated Magic Overlap.]

You layered three shields of the Guardian, one after another, to protect your body. The multiple shields collided with the light.

Boom!

And the shields shattered.

The Immortal's power was about to reach Taesan.

[You activated Distortion.]

You slightly distorted the trajectory of the light.

Taesan drew his sword.

[You activated Naberiuse's Golden Sword.] [You activated the Sword of Devotion.] [You activated Copy.]

You poured all your strength and energy into the sword and struck down.

The sword, which collided with the light, let out a scream as it was about to break.

But it endured."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The immortal's beam, which had been weakened by the countless skills of Taesan, caught my eye. With one sword, I contained everything and copied its power, doubling its strength.

I poured strength into my feet and took a step forward.

Kwaaaang!

The beam scattered in all directions, destroying everything in its path.

The immortal concentrated its power. There was no damage, just a wave.

[You activated the Boundary Rebound.]

The wave disappeared the moment it touched the black sword.

And Taesan disrupted the balance of the Boundary Rebound. The swirling power turned gray and settled into the sword.

Kwachik.

The boundary line pierced the immortal's weakness.

At the same time, the power of the divine punishment that had been lodged in the immortal poured into Taesan.

You are mine.

It was a power filled with that determination.

"Disappear."

Taesan forcibly broke the boundary line. The power of the divine punishment that had been pouring in was erased, and the world was dyed a grayish color.

* * *

Taesan threw away the sword.

Because it had been filled to the limit with the boundary line, the sword was broken.

"I need to change swords again."

Taesan, who had been holding his breath, sheathed the sword. At the same time, he forcibly suppressed the wavering of his mind.

With a trembling hand, he pulled out a potion and drank it.

Only then did his condition barely stabilize. Taesan took a deep breath and opened the system window.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Your twisted willpower tuning skill has increased by 5%.] [Your command skill has increased by 4%.] [??? skill has increased by 3%.] [Your black skill has increased by @xx!.] [Your boundary rebound skill has increased by !@#@!.] [Your boundary line skill has increased by !@@.]

I couldn't read half of the system window. Taesan laughed awkwardly and continued reading.

[You have defeated the immortal with a mortal body, achieving an impossible feat. You have obtained the special activation skill [Immortal Opponent].] [You have obtained the title [One Who Achieved the Impossible].] [Your willpower has been activated, and you have obtained the soul skill [King of Machinery].] [Your boundary is now at the boundary line. Whether you move forward or not is entirely up to you. You have obtained the special activation skill [Beyond the Boundary].] [You've really won. Against an immortal...]

The ghost let out a sigh of amazement. Its voice was filled with awe.

The immortal was in a state of death. It was being controlled by a strong force, treated like a puppet.

And Taesan also had the boundary line, a powerful card.

But the immortal was still an immortal. And Taesan was a mortal being.

Even transcendents would not easily accept Taesan's achievement.

Note: There are some parts that seem to be game-like or fantasy-related terms, so I've translated them as closely as possible to their literal meaning. If you have any specific context or clarification, I'd be happy to help further!

Taesan felt various gazes from beyond the sky.

What was contained within was shock and curiosity. It was a mix of emotions.

[The gods outside the labyrinth are interested in you.]

"Let's go back."

Taesan waved his hand, and his body moved to the labyrinth.

"Goodbye."

[……You are.]

Balbambara quietly opened his mouth.

But he closed it again. A complex gaze filled with emotions was directed at Taesan.

[I thought you would escape to the labyrinth.]

Balbambara judged that the current Taesan was capable of escaping from the immortal's grasp. He believed that Taesan would create enough distance to avoid the immortal's interference and then call himself back to the labyrinth.

But Taesan had defeated the immortal.

[Unbelievable.]

In the end, Balbambara couldn't say anything else.

[Even if it's on the boundary, it's an amazing thing.]

Balbambara, who had barely contained his surprise, opened his mouth.

[It's amazing, but... it's a task for a wizard. As the manager of the labyrinth, I will do my job.]

All quests have been completed.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Taesan has perfectly completed the 74th floor. And the reward for the 74th floor quest had not been properly determined. It could change depending on what Taesan had accomplished.

And now, Taesan has perfectly cleared the quest.

It was time to give him a fitting reward."
