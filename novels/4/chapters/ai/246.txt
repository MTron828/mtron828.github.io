Chapter 247

247. 56th Floor (1)

It's not the first time I've seen something with a skill.

However, it was the first time I saw a system error that told me to ask the administrator of the labyrinth for help.

"Balbambalb."

The mountain opened its mouth. A few moments later, the floor collapsed and the walls crumbled.

"[Are you the one who summoned me again?]"

The voice that sounded like it was exasperated and annoyed echoed.

"[It's been a while since you've been summoning me consecutively. What's the reason for summoning me this time?]"

"What's written is to summon me, right?"

"[What are you talking about?]"

"What should I show you?"]

The mountain opened the skill window and summoned Balbambalb.

"Is that okay?"

"[Skill? That's the reason you summoned me...]"

Balbambalb closed his mouth.

The one who had been silent for a while opened his mouth again.

"[What's that...?]"

"I don't know, so I'll ask."

There were a few skills that the labyrinth couldn't explain.
Here is the translation of the text:

One was a concept skill obtained from the world of Halfran, the master blacksmith. As the proficiency level increased, the content gradually became vague.

And the other was a black-colored skill obtained from God. It was written in strange characters that seemed impossible to explain.

However, neither of them contained any content about summoning the administrator.

Valvatorez let out a sigh.

[In some cases, the explanation of a skill is missing. The first case is when the skill's level is far beyond the user's strength. In this case, even as the user's proficiency or strength increases, the explanation does not appear. You may have such a skill among the ones you possess.]

Concept skill.

It seemed to be talking about that.

[The second case is when you know about the skill's power, but you don't know it well. The powers of gods are like that.]

It was talking about God's power.

[The last case is when you don't know about the skill's power and its effects are unknown. In this case, the explanation does not add a summoning request.]

"What's this?"

"What is this?"

Valvatorez's voice was filled with puzzlement.
This text appears to be a scene from a fantasy novel or game, and it's difficult to translate it accurately without context. However, I'll try to provide a translation:

"This place is a labyrinth. It was created by wizards and gods. Even if you have the power of a high-ranking god, you won't know what kind of power it is. But as for what you have... I have no idea."

The wizard doesn't know the power.

That was the boundary.

"I should check it out. Let's try it once."

"It's hard to guess what kind of effect it will have. I also have an uncontrollable power. Can you stop it?"

"Can't control it? Not even with your abilities?"

Valbambal muttered to himself in amazement.

"...Are there any beings who can control that power?"

"The god of despair has been watching."

"Is it Aphrodite...?"

Valbambal fell silent for a moment before speaking again.

"I'll have to ask Aphrodite directly. And I'll wait until then."

Kugung!

Valbambal's body crumpled to the ground.

Barkaja whispered with interest.

"Is that the administrator of the labyrinth? Strong. At least, there's no one who can rival me within the labyrinth."

There's no problem with the skill he obtained. He confirmed it. Now it's time to check the rest.

[Skill: Inner World] [Mana Cost: 1000] [Proficiency: 1%] [Creates a realm that expands the user's own power and territory.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"Is it okay to think that way?"

[You've activated your inner world.]

The existence of Tae-san expanded.

The power and energy scattered and began to consume the space.

"Crackle! Crackle!"

The puzzle pieces fit together, and all sides were wrapped in Tae-san's power. The room where Tae-san was standing became Tae-san's territory after a few seconds.

"[It's not a form of suppression, but a skill that forces a battle...]? [This internal self has become a kind of territory. Unless you have an ordinary power, it's difficult to escape.]"

"It's fine."

Tae-san tapped the edge of the territory. Although it was weakened a bit because the power spread out, it's unlikely to escape if the opponent is not at the same level. If you use the sa-do and king's vessel, the territory will become even more solid.

It was a skill that could force a one-sided battle like a forced duel. It was strong enough.

The next skill to be shown was one evolved by Aphrodia.

[Special activation skill: The Branch of Despair] [Mana consumption: 500] [Mastery: 1%] [It implants the Branch of Despair into the opponent's heart. The opponent experiences a torrent of terrible emotions.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"Is this a 1:1 skill?"

It seems to be a skill that affects emotions directly.

Skills that interfere with emotions often become useless against opponents of different levels.

However, this is a despair-inducing skill given by the god of despair.

Even strong opponents, including those at the top, had a high chance of being affected. If that's the case, the value of the skill is quite high.

The skill confirmation is over.

Now it's time to use the points.

"How should I do it?"

Tae-san sat down and thought deeply.

The obtained points are 2830. If converted to skill proficiency, the ratio is 1:10, making it 283%.

However, among the skills Tae-san possesses, there is no skill that applies this proficiency level.

The value of each skill is extremely high, and the consumed points are also considerable.

'Concept skills, transcendent skills, or magic skills are impossible from the start.'

Skills that are too high-level cannot apply points at all. Instead, investment should be made in skills one level lower.

'Magic at the intermediate level is the worst in terms of efficiency.'
Here is the translation of the text to English:

I also thought about raising the proficiency of the spirit arrow, but it consumed 100 points to raise it by 1%.

Even if I attacked head-on, I couldn't raise it by more than 28%.

Of course, the skill's effect is significant, so I thought it would be sufficient, but I couldn't help feeling a sense of regret.

Tae-san's face fell. In my previous life, I didn't acquire skills of this level, so I hadn't considered the weaknesses.

Tae-san continued to think about it.

And then he made a decision.

"I'll make a contract with the spirits."

[Spirit Skill: Spirit Contract] [Proficiency: 2%] [It allows me to summon spirits and harness their power. I'm still not able to fully harness their power.]

Barakaza and Minerva are strong. Tae-san was still unable to fully harness their power.

Tae-san invested points in the spirit contract.

As his proficiency rose, the points spent on the spirit contract also increased, and the proficiency of Barakaza and Minerva's contract began to rise. Barakaza, who was watching, exclaimed in surprise.

"Oh, oh, oh?"

Suddenly, his strength was increasing. The total amount of power he could handle was growing, and he could control his power even more smoothly.

"What's going on?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Baruka was flabbergasted.

He didn't do anything, but his strength was rising. It was an experience he had never had before.

He confirmed the changed content of every point using all his power.

[Magic Skill: Divine Pact] [Proficiency: 40%] [By contracting with the spirits, one can summon them and draw out their strength. One can freely control the spirits' power and draw out their strength to some extent.]

The mountain god waved his hand. Wind and light were mixed together on his palm.

He became much freer in handling his power. If he got a bit more accustomed to it, he thought he could create a real typhoon without consuming any mana.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Spirit Contract: A top-grade spirit with diverse colors. Baraka] [Proficiency: 20%] [Mana consumption for summoning: 300] [I have contracted with Baraka. I can summon Baraka and give it orders. I can also use Baraka's power more effectively.]

[Spirit Contract: The Wind Spirit King. Minerva] [Proficiency: 26%] [Mana consumption for summoning: 1000] [I have contracted with Minerva. I can use Minerva's power more effectively. However, I cannot summon Minerva according to the conditions of the contract.]

The Spirit Contract has not changed much in content.

However, the changes felt by the spirit were enormous. Baraka was in a state of shock and confusion.

"What's going on...?"

"This is a labyrinth."

Baraka let out a sigh.

Labyrinth.

A space where a system created by the Transcendents applies.

Baraka only realized the meaning of this later.

"It's not bad."

It has become much stronger. Minerva is likely to be the same. With her current power, she could easily defeat the monsters that troubled her on Earth.

"The community is still a mess."

Although the speed has slowed down a bit compared to the beginning, it is still difficult to have a conversation.

The leaders from other countries, including Kim Hui-yeon, are working hard to control the situation, but people are not easily listening.

Among them, a familiar name caught my eye.

[Amelia Airline [Alone]: Before you kill me, let's talk! Have a conversation!]

The text revealed the personality of that person immediately.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san smiled happily.

"It's great to be alive. Just as expected."

Tae-san closed the community.

It will be true tomorrow, and I'll talk about it then.

It's time to descend into the labyrinth now.

Tae-san moved his foot.

* * *

The monster on the 56th floor was Pegasus.

A winged horse with a horn appeared in the sky.

Tae-san lowered his hand.

Pegasus fell to the ground, bleeding.

"It's a strange feeling."

It's like killing a mysterious animal that only appears in a fairy tale. It's a very strange feeling.

Tae-san suddenly broke through the 56th floor.

Since all the rewards, including the secret reward, were related to black magic, Tae-san offered a sacrifice to the god.

The god didn't show up, only collecting the offering with a dark aura.

Tae-san thought that something was busy, so he entered the 57th floor.

[Start of 57th floor quest.] [Defeat the boss of the 57th floor and pass through.] [Reward: Shining Golden Necklace.] [Secret reward: ???]

"I'm starting to want it soon."

[What do you want?]
Here is the translation of the text:

"A new skill."

The ghost was taken aback.

"What else can I get?"

Tae-san had obtained many things. Compared to the ghost, it was unimaginable how many things he had gotten.

Concept skills, transcendent skills, boundary skills, and so on. Not only were there many, but each one had an immeasurable value. Other adventurers would be grateful to have just one of these skills and use it for their entire lives.

However, Tae-san was still lacking something.

"I haven't obtained the skill I want yet."

The skills he obtained in solo mode were all excellent.

But he couldn't say that it was the skill he truly wanted.

"My original intention was separate from that."

Tae-san had become stronger here. If he had only done this, he could have easily defeated his past self.

However, he was still lacking something crucial.

Addition, multiplication, copying, time stop, absolute judgment, and so on.

These skills, which he had obtained with his own strength and analysis, were comparable to those of Lee Tae-yun, even in his solo mode.

In other words, his entire power was his skills.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I haven't managed to get half of it yet."

"There are also things that cannot be obtained immediately, but......"

In cases where time is suspended or multiplied, extremely special conditions are required. Even if one were to regain their past life, it would be impossible to obtain it.

However, a few things can be obtained now.

The Taesan has entered the 57th floor.

As I walked through the tunnel, the monster on the 57th floor appeared.

The first thing I felt was that the air was different.

A massive, flower-shaped monster was emitting a mysterious aura.

"Found it."

Taesan drew out his sword.

[Mysterious Rhapsody appeared.]
