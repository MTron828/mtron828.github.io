**Episode 456**

**456. The Seventh Return, Earth (8)**

The place where the energy was gathering was Montana, in the northwest of the United States.

"Get as far away as possible."

"Yes, yes."

People were fleeing in a hurry from Montana to a distant place. Taesan arrived in Montana in an instant.

There, a condensed black energy was creating a portal.

Just that alone was enough to make all things die, and space was distorted. The condensed and compressed black energy expanded greatly.

A black portal appeared in the center of Montana.

From beyond it, multiple gazes were felt.

Beings with the power to reject cognition itself.

They were the gods.

They were looking at Taesan.

[Ugh.]

Barudrei let out a groan and quickly escaped from Taesan's hand. Akasha was also in agony. The gaze alone made their mind scream, and their body wanted to surrender.

Taesan did not back down.

He protected his own mind and faced the gods.

[…….]

The gaze that had been directed at Taesan for a moment disappeared. And something came from beyond the portal.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$The seventh tendril of the world-splitter has appeared.

It was a drop.

A drop, but far too large to be just a drop. Its size was that of a small lake.

And then the drop warped.

Quad-thud!

A giant arm burst out from the drop, soaring deep into the sky. The arm then descended, touching the ground.

Kwaa-roo-oom!

The very earth crumbled. The earthquake reached as far as Montana, affecting Canada as well. Mountains gnashed their teeth, ready to leap.

Kwaa-roo-oom!

A being appeared from within the drop.

It was a giant.

A giant, blackened from head to toe, standing proudly, treading on the earth.

"Ah..."

The faces of those who had fled to the very end of America turned blue. Even those on the opposite end of America could see the giant in its entirety.

Its head was hidden by the clouds, an overwhelming size beyond recognition.

Gugugugugug...

The giant bowed its head. With that movement alone, the sky warped, and a storm began to brew. The clouds disappeared, revealing the giant's face.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His face was smooth like an egg.

There was no nose, no mouth, no ears - nothing.

In the center, only a crimson iris was embedded.

"Ah."

People held their breath.

The crimson iris gazing at the earth.

With just that gaze, the earth slowly began to die. People fell to their knees, trembling.

And in that moment, the pillars scattered throughout the United States activated.

[Gerband's Absolute Defense activated. Gerband's interference zone decreased.]

The pillars resonated with each other, amplifying their power. People barely managed to breathe. The pillars protected the dying earth from the influence of the gods.

Without stopping, the pillars strongly pressed down on the giant.

Reducing their influence, they restricted its movements.

The giant looked annoyed, lifting its foot high. Gang Tae-san, who was in front of it, quickly created distance.

The foot came crashing down.

With just that step, the ground was deeply excavated.

A massive crater was formed, as if a meteor had fallen. A tsunami-like wave of earth and soil surged forward.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The world is shaking. The atmosphere surrounding the earth is distorted. If the pillars hadn't suppressed the shockwave, the earth would have been destroyed with overwhelming power.

People screamed. The battles they had experienced so far were already beyond their comprehension, but this was even more so.

[You have activated the Devouring Destruction.]

Taesan, who had erased the shockwave covering himself with his skill, let out a cold laugh.

With just one kick, small cracks spread across several pillars.

"We have to take them down before they're all destroyed."

[...Is it possible?]

The bard, who had quickly returned to Taesan's side, let out a sigh.

[That's a Divine Punisher.]

It wasn't one of their avatars or apostles.

A Divine Punisher, who kills Transcendents and destroys the world. It had descended upon the earth itself.

Taesan drew his sword.

"It's not the real Divine Punisher. It's just a fragment."

[Even so, it's an existence with an extremely high level of power. Is it an opponent we can defeat?]

"I can defeat it."

If I can't defeat it, I'll make it possible to defeat it."

Note: "Devouring Destruction" and "Divine Punisher" are likely names of powerful abilities or entities in the context of the story, and may not have direct English translations.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The opponent is !@#%$^! [Your enormous willpower has been triggered.] [Your arch-nemesis has been triggered.] [Your anti-faith has been triggered.]

...

...

The King's vessel. The avatar of nature. The apostle of destruction.

He activates all the buff skills he can use. In an instant, he reaches an overwhelming height of power and strength.

If he were to receive the divine blessing of the earth right now, he could even take on Ainztahar.

Taesan imbues his entire body with strength and charges forward.

[You have triggered forced descent.]

Forced descent. A skill that lowers the target's stats. Taesan targets the giant.

But the activation was cancelled.

It was as if the giant was not a target that could be affected, and the skill itself was erased.

The giant glares at Taesan and raises his fist.

Kwaaaang!

The fist comes down at rapid speed. Taesan wraps himself in divine power and dodges.

Kuuuuung!

The aftermath of the powerful blow brushes past Taesan.

Just that alone causes the divine power wrapped around Taesan to distort in anxiety.

Taesan tries to raise his divine power even more, but it doesn't change. The giant swings his leg. At an incredibly fast speed that doesn't match his giant physique, Taesan chooses to defend rather than dodge."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the World's Sword.]

A gigantic sword that pierces the sky is held in Taesan's hand.

Taesan swung it towards the giant's leg without hesitation.

The forces clashed, and a loud explosion erupted.

Taesan's eyes wavered.

The World's Sword shattered, unable to withstand the power, and fragmented in all directions.

Taesan hastily activated his magic.

However, it couldn't even touch the giant's skin, and was repelled by the giant's physical strength.

Taesan was kicked by the giant's leg.

Kwaaaah!

[Your first attack!@#!%#]

The attack was nullified.

But something was different. Although no damage was dealt, the giant's body didn't return to its previous state before the attack.

Taesan's body also flew backward, as if it had been hit by the attack. The effect was closer to damage nullification rather than attack nullification.

[You have activated Landing.]

Thud!

Using his skill, Taesan forcibly planted his feet on the ground, which was about to be blown away into space. He then gathered his black aura and magic.

[You have activated Great Destruction [Rejection].]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The black sphere flew towards the giant.

The giant lightly stretched out his arm and grasped the massive destruction with his hand. The massive destruction didn't inflict any damage and disappeared.

The unjust massive destruction is the strongest magic among those possessed by Taesan.

The fact that it was blocked in such a way meant that Taesan's magic had no effect on the giant.

Kuuuuung!

He barely dodged the swinging fist. Just that was enough to distort his divine energy and deal damage.

"There's no way."

He couldn't completely block the aftermath with his divine energy. Taesan dyed his divine energy, which was wrapped around his body, black.

He drew a boundary line all over his body. Only then did the aftermath not reach Taesan.

Kiiiiing!

And he also drew a boundary line on his sword.

He spread his wings and moved at high speed. He narrowly dodged the swinging fist and stabbed with his sword.

Ka-ching!

But it didn't pierce.

The boundary line, tainted with ash, was blocked by the black skin and didn't penetrate. A small scratch was made, but it was too small to be considered an injury.

"What is this?"

Taesan burst out laughing.

The giant stretched out his other hand.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan grasped his hand tightly to grab the giant.

[You activated a limited blink.]

Taesan used magic to escape.

But the giant seemed to know his location and lifted his foot to trample Taesan.

Taesan quickly amplified the boundary line wrapped around his body and drew his sword.

Kaah!

Taesan's sword pierced the giant's foot. The sword sank deep into the giant's foot, using the giant's own strength.

But the giant's foot didn't stop. Taesan couldn't withstand the force and was slammed into the ground.

Kuuuung!

No damage was dealt. The boundary line wrapped around his body protected him from the giant's attack.

However, Taesan's black sword was greatly consumed.

At this rate, he could only block about three more attacks before he couldn't use the boundary line.

There was no time to be shocked, and the next attack came immediately. Taesan barely dodged it by quickly jumping away.

"This is ridiculous."

Taesan's boundary line had clearly inflicted damage on the giant's body.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But since its size was enormous, it didn't seem to have suffered any significant damage. If you compare it to a human, it was like getting a nail stuck in the sole of their foot. It must have been painful, but it wasn't a fatal wound.

If things continued like this, it would be able to inflict a fatal blow on that body before it could use its full power.

That body itself was a giant's ability.

It was an unstoppable, world-conquering power that distorted the concept of the world, and it was the authority of the gods.

"Even with its fragments, it's already like this. I wonder what the main body is like."

Taesan muttered to himself and moved forward. He didn't lose his determination and charged towards the giant.

* * *

KUUUUUUUUNG!

The earth shook.

The sky distorted, and the shockwave burst forth, reaching the clouds.

If the pillars hadn't protected them, they would have died already. People screamed and ducked for cover. Overwhelming fear engulfed them.

"This is...".

"No, it can't be."

Beldegencia's face stiffened. Diana's face turned pale as she gazed at the giant. Lee Taeyun bit his nails and muttered incessantly.

The three of them could sense what kind of existence the giant that had descended was.

That was a god.

Although it was just a fragment, it was still a part of the god's main body. It was literally a different level of enemy."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No matter how strong the opponent was, there was no chance of winning.

"No. What are the transcendent ones doing?"

Iteayeon bit her lip.

"Are you curious?"

At that moment, a voice came from behind her. Iteayeon quickly turned her body around.

Behind her was a young man.

She couldn't sense anything from him. Despite being clearly present, he felt like an illusion.

Iteayeon realized who he was.

"......Lord Zelvand?"

Zelvand nodded his head.

Beldengkia and Diana hastily bowed their heads. Zelvand waved his hand.

"Treat me normally. I've come with all my power hidden, so do that."

Zelvand looked at the giant.

"You're the World Destroyer. If you make a mistake, your physical body could be destroyed, but are you focusing on his soul instead? From my perspective, that's not bad."

"Yes?"

Iteayeon was taken aback.

The existence that could destroy the boundaries of the Taesan with their body and even interfere with skills wasn't bad?

But Zelvand's face was genuinely saying that it was true.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"'It's just simple physical strength, right? That power is also limited to the physical body. It's better than those who try to erase experience and strength or devour an entire planet.'

'…….'

'But because I've kept many pillars, it's become quite small. It's a size that can be handled by a single planet. At that level, it's possible.'

'That's just…….'

It was an absurd story.

Zelvand said it nonchalantly.

'If you reach the position prepared for you, you'll understand. She has high expectations for you.'

'Mister Zelvand.'

Iteayeon said with a calm face.

'Does Mister Zelvand's descent mean that you can help Taesan?'

'That's right.'

Zelvand nodded.

'It's unusual for them to intervene directly, right? This time, we've also been allowed to intervene directly. I've come as their representative.'

'Then please help Taesan.'

Iteayeon bowed his head.

Zelvand was a transcendent being, one of those who had expelled the gods. If he helped, Taesan would surely be able to defeat the gods.

But Zelvand responded with a laugh.

'No.'

That answer was a denial.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I won't interfere. Not yet."

"What?"

Iteayeon's eyes widened in surprise.

"Why..."

"First of all, I don't need to interfere from the start."

KUUUUUUUUNG!

A loud explosion erupted, and people screamed.

The battle was far from over.

Taesan was holding his own against Goshin.

"He's strong. Stronger than you think. Even if he's a world-destroyer, he's not someone who can be easily defeated with just the seventh fragment. He's not in a crisis yet, so it's not time for me to intervene directly. If I do, the plan could go awry."

"The plan, then..."

Instead of answering, Zelvand waved his hand.

At that moment, a massive screen appeared before the people.

It was a screen showing Taesan and Goshin fighting.

Zelvand was using his powers to display the battle footage.

"Oh..."

"Ah..."

Gasps of amazement escaped from the crowd, who were frozen in terror as they watched the video.

KUUUUUUUUNG!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The earth is trampled. The surface is torn apart, and the mantle appears. A giant's arm swings wildly. A storm fiercely pierces the atmosphere.

A monstrous being with a cosmic scale.

And yet, Taesan did not back down against such a monster.

He advanced forward, fighting.

People unknowingly kneel down, closing their eyes to pray.

Among them, there were those who still doubted Taesan until the end.

Iteon realized what Zelvand was aiming for.

"Do you plan to make Taesan a god of the earth?"

"Sometimes, absolute fear can unite people more than an excellent leader. There's no reason to intervene and distort the opportunity they've been given."

Zelvand laughed joyfully.

"Aren't you curious? What can he do, the one who has received your faith?"
