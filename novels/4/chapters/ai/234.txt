Chapter 235

235. The Fourth Return. Earth (2)

"Hmm..."

The Great Mountain had touched the ground. A flower that had grown in the labyrinth on the withered earth was planted.

"It feels like that, doesn't it."

The Great Mountain raised its head.

There was no change in the observation deck.

The Great Mountain puffed out its lips and pulled out the flower it had planted. Kim Hwiyeon, who had just arrived, raised an eyebrow.

"What are you doing now?"

"I'm trying to create a zone. I learned something useful in the labyrinth and I'm trying to figure out how to use it, but it's not working out."

The Great Mountain took out another flower from its inventory.

"Zone... It's going to affect the entire observation deck, right?"

"It is."

"..."

Kim Hwiyeon gazed blankly and muttered to herself.

"Ah, Taesan-sun is getting farther and farther away from being human."

"Is that so?"

He himself had such thoughts.

However, he didn't pay much attention to it. After all, his goal was to transcend the mortal realm. Kim Hwiyeon smiled wryly at the indifferent attitude of the Great Mountain.
Here is the translation of the text:

The interior of the broadcasting station was in chaos. The man in front of her, who seemed so calm, was the reason.

Kim Hwi-yeon raised her head.

"Woooo!"

A monster was right in front of her.

The immense power that she could feel was beyond her ability to win. Compared to previous standards, it was a monster of D-level. There were many such monsters.

"Wooooo!"

And then, everything was blocked by the wall.

The wall was extremely sturdy and didn't budge even slightly.

"This looks really strange."

"They look similar to insects or animals, but are different. Even after dissection, there's nothing. These are strange things."

She had already dissected many monsters in her previous life. But all she could find was darkness filling her insides. There was no meaningful information.

"Ah."

Kim Hwi-yeon muttered to herself with a strange expression.

"I didn't think it would come to this, evaluating monsters in front of me like this..."

After the first attack, the monsters continued to appear.

Some were a dozen or so, while others were several dozen, and they all rushed towards them.

However, before they even reached the broadcasting station, Bark was blocked by the familiar wall.

[They are weak.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Barkazer said with a stern expression.

"[I think it's the lowest-ranking monster among those handled by the gods. Even if tens of thousands of such creatures gather, they can't harm me or my master.]"

"That's really... an extraordinary thing, isn't it?"

If tens of thousands of D-grade monsters appear, the earth will be destroyed. I don't know about other countries, but Korea will definitely be exterminated.

Tae-san meant that he was overwhelmingly stronger than all Korean players.

As before, but they didn't really understand it until this return.

"God, I beg."

Kim Hui-yeon put those words in his mouth.

Tae-san explained the situation to the people who ruled over humans, including Kim Hui-yeon and Geum Jung-geun.

The existence attacking the earth is Goshin, and they are beings who have lost to the current gods. They refuse to admit defeat and are destroying numerous worlds.

"The earth is just one of them... The gods have led us into a labyrinth, I suppose."
Here is the translation of the text:

She didn't mention the reason for the separation of difficulties. When she heard that the labyrinth she was in was created by the existence she was attacking, she thought that even she wouldn't easily accept it.

[It's a pretty disgusting thing. My world is also being touched. And your world is being destroyed.]

Minerva sighed. Kim Hwi-yeon let out a forced smile.

"Really big. Too much."

A godly existence. And the labyrinth. Everything surrounding them.

She closed her eyes.

Her eyebrows twitched slightly.

And when her eyes appeared, they seemed to have sunk lower than before.

"And Mr. Tae-san has also had direct conversations with gods."

"Not many."

[Enough. There are none among the mortal beings who have had such relationships like yours, who have entered the labyrinth.]

A ghostly figure appeared. But his voice didn't reach Kim Hwi-yeon's ears, so Kim Hwi-yeon shook her head.

"My head is too complicated. But... I understand. No, rather, it's good."

Kim Hwi-yeon smiled slightly.

"We're in this kind of situation, and it's still quite a big deal, isn't it? I thought it was just a prank by someone who didn't matter, but it's not, and I'm grateful."

"What kind of prank?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Why, of course, the fact is that this world is a dream of a transcendent existence. We are nothing but the remnants of that existence's dream. I've had such thoughts too, you know."

Kim Hui-yeon seemed to have thought a lot. She kicked a stone with her foot.

"Thank you, Tae-san. You're telling me this too."

"I was planning to tell you from the beginning, so you don't have to worry about it."

In her previous life, Kim Hui-yeon had made a tremendous effort to transcribe. And she died without knowing anything.

Tae-san wanted to tell her the truth.

And there was faith. If Kim Hui-yeon and Joon-gyeom knew the truth, they wouldn't lose their minds.

Tae-san planted white flowers and scattered blue-colored dust around them.

"Wooo..."

Then, a commotion occurred. Kim Hui-yeon was startled and Tae-san's eyes gleamed.

"It's finally done."

Ki-ying.

A blue-colored area was born around the city hall.

"Ah?"

"Monsters, monster?"

People were shocked by the sudden change. The monsters were thought to have broken through the barrier, and the ones who were prepared to grab their weapons were surprised.

"Ah."

"My power......"

The blue area was giving them a boost in strength.

Tae-san shrugged his shoulders.

"Let's bring in one monster, Baruka. Let's bring it in."

Here is the translation of the text:

[I understand.]

The monster, which had been pounding on the screen and making a racket, suddenly appeared without any resistance. The monster, startled by the sudden intrusion, looked around briefly before deciding what to do.

Snap!

The monster approached Taesan.

"Try it once."

"Uuuuuu?"

Taesan retreated. Kim Hui-yeon, left alone in front of the monster, quickly drew her weapon.

Ka-ka-ka!

The sudden battle began.

Kim Hui-yeon took the fight seriously. The monster in front of her was one that couldn't be easily defeated.

Ka-aaa!

But her sword strike shook the monster's body greatly.

She didn't let go of the opportunity and pressed the monster.

Ka-kak!

A few minutes later, the monster collapsed. Kim Hui-yeon took a breath. Her face was pale with shock.

"How...?"

It was too easy to win.

Her movements were faster than usual, and the monster's movements were slow and weak. Taesan shrugged his shoulders.

"It's good."
Here is the translation of the text:

The domain created by mastering the art of sealing. It had the power to strengthen human strength and weaken monster strength. At first, I didn't know how to handle it, but it turned out to be better than expected.

"Is that what Master Taesan was holding?"

"Yes."

"Ah..."

Kim Hwiyeon smiled wryly.

"It's going to get crazy, I think."

* * *

"Wow!"

The blue domain surrounding them. Its effect was to strengthen them and weaken monsters.

As people discovered this fact, they were even more amazed. They began to worship Master Taesan.

"Wow, wow, wow!"

"Master Taesan, you're amazing!"

"Please protect us!"

Whenever Master Taesan passed by, they would grab his sleeve and pray. The countless hands and origins of the people converged towards Master Taesan.

Master Taesan, tired of their reactions, spread his wings. The sight of Master Taesan flying in the sky made them even more frantic.

[The proficiency in sacred power has increased by 1%.]

"Why is this always going up?"

Master Taesan muttered in a annoyed tone, looking down at the crowd.

People knelt down, praying while looking up at him.

It was like worshiping a god.

"Hey?"

"Brother, are you here?"

Kim Taeyeon and Kang Junhyuk, who were facing each other, greeted Master Taesan. Kim Taeyeon said jokingly,
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's the feeling of being worshipped?"

"It's weird."

Tae-san let out a sigh. Kang Jun-hyeok opened his mouth calmly.

"It's only natural. You can't just do one or two things, can you?"

He blocks monsters and strengthens them. He casts black magic and bestows divine favor upon them.

At this point, most people in Seoul worshipped Tae-san. Only a minority did not.

"You all needed something to rely on, so that's what I became."

"Honestly, I'm also a bit uneasy. How much stronger will you get?"

Lee Tae-yeon looked at Tae-san with a pale gaze. The demon-like Minedra and Barkaza, who were stronger than even Tae-yeon herself, were beside him.

She had also become stronger, but Tae-san was incredibly stronger. It was impossible to catch up with him, even if they were in the same maze.

Tae-san replied.

"Even if I don't know the contract of the spirits, I can still become even stronger if I continue down this path. Of course, I'll also be stronger by then."

"Is that possible......"

"It's possible."
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan looked at Taeyoung with a confident tone, saying something that was filled with trust. The words were so convincing that both Taeyoung and Kangjunhyuk's faces were moved.

As for Kangjunhyuk, it was a natural assumption since Taesan had already known Taeyoung's future. However, looking at Taeyoung again, Taesan felt a strange feeling.

Taeyoung, who had been implemented by the god of despair, knew many things.

How many times had she gone back in time, and what had she seen? And what had happened to Taesan at that place?

When Taesan's gaze was directed at her, Taeyoung trembled.

"Why are you looking at me like that?"

"No, I'm not."

Taesan took out his sword.

"Then let's do it again. Draw your weapon."

Taeyoung and Kangjunhyuk's eyes lit up as they drew their weapons.

* * *

"It's been a long time since I've been strong mentally."

Taeyoung and Kangjunhyuk simultaneously charged at Taesan, but were blown away by his single blow.

If they were the same as before, Taeyoung would have found a way to escape, and Kangjunhyuk would have only charged forward without thinking.

However, this time it was different. Taeyoung moved defensively to the utmost extent and targeted Taesan's weaknesses, while Kangjunhyuk charged forward roughly but continued to counterattack.
Here is the translation of the text:

The two of them moved in a desperate attempt to defeat the enemy they couldn't surpass, and they were determined to win.

After three hours, their faces were drenched in sweat, but they didn't look too bad.

They had obtained something not insignificant from their battle with the Celestial Being.

[It's not bad.]

After taking a break, Minerva spoke up.

[Even though they're still weak and fragile, they have talent. There's still a chance. Most importantly, their mental discipline is already in place. As long as they're guided by fate, they can become strong enough.]

"That's what I've made them. They can't die easily."

[Their divine power has increased by 1%.]

"This is real."

The Celestial Being frowned.

"What's going on?"

[Divine power. It's the collective will and faith of those who believe in you.]

Minerva turned her head away.

Inside the viewing room, countless faiths were flowing towards the Celestial Being.

[When someone believes in someone, that faith becomes a power that flows towards the object of their faith. When it accumulates to a certain extent, it becomes divine power, which is a kind of power. But I don't remember a mortal getting such a certain divine power in my memory...]

Although Minerva was still young, she possessed all the knowledge necessary for a spirit king thanks to her cultivation.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What can I do with this?"

[It's not possible to use it without divine power.]

Minerva declared.

[Even if I force it to work by twisting it, it's still not possible... The risk is too great. Only a transcendent being can use it. I don't need to worry about it. I'm more curious about how someone can obtain it.]

A mortal can become a transcendent being. Even in the labyrinth where numerous strong beings from various worlds gather, finding it is almost impossible.

However, Taesan thought differently.

It is not impossible to control power. It's just almost impossible.

Then, one day, I will obtain it. Just like the many skills he has acquired.

Taesan continued his training with Itaeun and Kang Junhyuk for two days.

His admiration for him did not cease, and his saintly power kept accumulating, but he did not worry about it.

And then, the time came.

[Start Quest] [People from each region are gathering in Seoul. They are risking their lives to get here.] [Protect and escort them to Seoul.] [Rewards will be given according to the results.]
