**Episode 556**

**556. 97th Floor. Moebius's Lizard (3)**

Kwaaaang!

Leviathan swings its front legs. Its sharp claws tear through space, trying to slash the mountain.

The mountain responds with a rusty sword. The gray and claws collide, producing a loud crashing sound.

Kwagagagakang!

The wings flap wildly. A strong gust of wind blows towards the mountain. The mountain stomps on the ground, amplifying its physical strength and shaking the surroundings.

Kagagagak!

But it's not enough.

The strong gust of wind contains a power that forces an end to all things. The mountain's physical strength can't withstand it and is destroyed. The mountain tries to dodge the storm that's about to engulf it by throwing its body.

"Is this a concept?"

It has killed physical strength itself. That's the lizard that knows the end of all things, a part of Leviathan's authority.

The mountain swings its fist. The gray explodes, erasing the storm.

[Crackle…….]

The dragon gazes at the mountain with a cold stare.

The red reptile's eyes are fixed on the mountain. Its jaws slowly open.

[……A distorted existence.]

"What's going on. Can I speak?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan was slightly surprised. Leviathan only showed Taesan the beast's cry. So, Taesan thought it would be impossible to have a conversation like with Ouroboros, but Leviathan spoke very fluently.

"Of course. I made a deal with a wizard, so I couldn't be without intelligence."

[……You're standing on the boundary.]

"So what?"

[It's not to my liking.]

The voice was filled with displeasure.

Flap.

The wings spread out, and the massive body filled the space even more.

[I am the dragon that calls for the end of all things. Everything in the universe must come to an end because of me.]

Leviathan is the device that announces the end of all things, responsible for the apocalypse. Although it's not performing its role now since the end hasn't arrived, if the end were to come, Leviathan would devour the entire universe.

[But you, who originated from the universe, have escaped my control.]

The cold, serpent-like eyes of Leviathan gazed at Taesan, filled with an unstoppable, forced power that could bring an end to all existence in the universe.

However, Taesan didn't show any particular emotion.

He simply wore a calm, ashen expression.

Leviathan grew even more enraged at this.

[Existences like you are unacceptable.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You're ridiculous. If you can't accept that you've escaped from me, shouldn't you be angry with the gods first? Is there a reason for them to hold me back while they invade?"

[They don't matter. They're originally like that, and they've never been under my control. But you're different. You were a being under my control.]

Taesan was originally an ordinary human.

When Leviathan announced the end, he was a being swept up in the universe.

But he has now transcended the concept of the universe.

[A being that has escaped its origins. You can't accept it.]

The emotions hidden in that voice.

Taesan's eyes slowly cooled.

"I thought there must be some reason."

Why did the end's snake, Leviathan, target Taesan?

I thought there must be some conceptual problem or conflict of ideas.

But that wasn't it.

"Is it just a matter of pride?"

The fact that a being that had escaped his control had appeared was something he couldn't accept. That was the reason Leviathan was dealing with Taesan.

"You're ridiculous."

Leviathan is a mechanistic being like a god of death or Ouroboros.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He didn't experience trials on his own, nor did he overcome hardships that carved into his flesh and bones, nor did he elevate himself to a high realm through self-reflection. He was born with immense power from the start.

Therefore, his spirit was immature and weak, not matching his strength and stature.

"The God of Death was a gentleman."

Deisha was also emotionally unstable, but she was trying to eliminate the universe's imbalance. She didn't act according to her emotions like Leviathan.

Taesan's eyes had frozen to the point where they couldn't freeze anymore.

Leviathan let out a roar, as if displeased with Taesan's attitude.

[How dare you look at me like that!]

"So what do you want to do?"

[I'll bring you the end!]

Kwaaaang!

The labyrinth collapses, and a massive storm engulfs the world.

And they arrived at a single realm.

Everything crumbles and is destroyed. Thunder and storms ravage the world fiercely.

This is the realm of the end.

A single landscape that all things reach when they see their end.

[Die, distorted existence.]

Leviathan takes a breath. Immense power gathers in the dragon's mouth.

And the mouth opens, and the breath is released.

It was a gray breath."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan took a step back. He gathered his mana and swung it around.

[You've activated a colorful, rainbow-colored dash.]

The gray breath and the rainbow-colored streak collided.

And the rainbow-colored streak began to wither and disappear in an instant.

The great magician's magic was literally powerless. It was as if it didn't exist from the start, and it couldn't block the breath at all.

The advancing breath engulfed Taesan.

Kwaaaah!

Taesan's body was buried in the gray breath and disappeared. Leviathan burst out laughing.

[Hahaha! You pitiful existence! Disappear! Be crushed by my power and vanish!]

"It's too loud."

[What!]

The remnants of the breath disappeared, and Taesan was still there. His entire body was covered in ash.

[Oh, how...]

"It didn't even touch me from the start."

Taesan replied calmly.

"It's pretty strong, though. Quite impressive."

Even though he didn't defend himself, it was the first time he had seen the rainbow-colored streak disappear so quickly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Leviathan is the doomsday lizard. It had the power to declare an end to all concepts in the universe. For any being in the universe, defeating Leviathan was almost impossible.

Therefore, the system had judged that victory was impossible against such an enemy.

But Taesan was someone who existed beyond the system.

"Even if you call it the end, it won't reach me."

His boundaries went beyond the concepts of this universe. Even the god of death couldn't kill him, so it was impossible for the end to trespass on his boundaries.

"You knew that too, didn't you? You just ignored it."

When Leviathan first met Taesan, it had unconsciously retreated.

It was intimidated by his unusual nature. It had tried to ignore that feeling and attack Taesan.

"I just wanted to quickly settle this and move on, but... my thoughts have changed. You seem like a suitable experiment subject."

[...Nonsense!]

Leviathan was enraged. It was the dragon of doomsday, a being that announced the end of all things. Even transcendents feared and avoided it. To be seen as an experiment subject was an unbearable insult.

Of course, this was a story that didn't concern Taesan at all.

"Come on. Let's go all out."

Taesan chuckled lightly."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Ne-no-o-o-m!]

The enraged Leviathan takes a breath. Once again, the breath of the end times is spewed towards the Taesan.

Taesan spreads his hands.

"Bloom."

And the red flower blooms.

The concept of the cycle of all things collides with the end of all things. The loud noise and the opposing powers clash.

Zzzt-zzzt-zzzt!

And the red flower begins to wither slowly.

The cycle is forced to meet its end.

"It's over."

The cycle is forced to end. If one is a being bound by the concept of the universe, it would be nearly impossible to defeat Leviathan.

But that was a story unrelated to Taesan.

Taesan focused his mind. The red flower, which was crumbling, began to take on a grayish hue.

Tremble.

The boundary and cycle begin to mix.

Ka-ga-ga-kak!

The gray flower does not break under the breath of the end times. Instead, it resists and blocks it.

Ku-gu-gu-gung….

The end subsides.

The gray flower, though half-broken, was still holding its ground.

[…!]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Leviathan is enraged. His domain resonates. Thunder covers the world, and storms reveal all things.

It's a scene that's as if the world is ending.

'It's similar to the Demon King.'

The difference is that the Demon King was the end of a single planet, whereas Leviathan is the end of this universe itself.

'Let's try it once.'

Taesan is going to experiment with the power he has obtained.

It's about circulation.

By mixing boundaries and circulation, he can summon a gray flower. Then, what else is possible? He thought he'd check each one.

First, let's start with circulation.

Taesan didn't avoid the overwhelming power of the apocalypse.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

The boundary denial surrounding Taesan collides with the power of the apocalypse.

The boundary denial rises, trying to devour the power of the apocalypse and make it its own, inflating its body.

[How dare you!]

Leviathan, who saw this, lets out a roar of anger, filling his hand with hatred.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

And lightning strikes down.

Each one has the power to split a planet in half and still have some left over. Moreover, it contains the power of the apocalypse. Even if you're a transcender, it's hard to withstand it."

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, Taesan was not affected in the slightest. The boundary negation that surrounded him blocked everything.

But it was inevitable that it would be consumed. No matter how powerful it was, it was ultimately finite. The boundary negation was consumed at an incredible rate, proportional to the immense power it possessed.

Leviathan revealed its true form upon seeing this.

Its own power was piercing through Taesan's heterogeneity. Leviathan was greatly satisfied with this fact.

[Die!]

Ku ku ku ku!

The power surged, and the boundary negation began to reveal its true form.

And Taesan waited for that moment.

He controlled the power he had obtained. He dominated and manipulated it, intertwining it with the cycle of everything.

And a flower bloomed.

The flower touched the boundary negation that surrounded Taesan.

[You have activated the cycle.]

And the boundary negation began to cycle. The consumed power began to accumulate at an incredible rate, as if time itself was accelerating.

[What, what.]

Leviathan was shocked, and Taesan wore a faint smile.

"Is this it?"

Taesan had gained control over the concept of cycles.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But how to handle it was a concern. There were too many ways to utilize the authority itself.

So, I decided to focus on a small concept for now.

Circulation.

Then, could I forcibly circulate his power?

Could I recover the consumed things at a rapid speed?

The result was possible. I forcibly circulated the consumed boundary and refilled it.

[Impossible! How!]

Leviathan was enraged and let out a roar again. Taesan didn't block or dodge it.

Kwaaaah!

And that was enough.

The replenished boundary once again blocked the end.

Taesan tried to activate circulation on the boundary again.

But it was impossible. It was as if there was a restriction, and circulation couldn't resonate with the boundary.

"There's a limit."

It seemed impossible to circulate something that had already been circulated once.

Then.

Taesan unleashed magic and dark magic. In an instant, dozens, hundreds of powers were realized and covered Leviathan.

[Useless!]

Leviathan flapped its wings.

[I am the one who knows the end of all things!]

With just that, the magic and dark magic were shattered and destroyed.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$This passage describes a battle against Leviathan, where the character Tae-san realizes that using only dark magic is not enough. His mana quickly depletes as he uses various spells, and then he activates his power again. The text states "You have activated a cycle," indicating that his mana and dark magic rapidly replenish, reaching their limit instantaneously.

Tae-san contemplates the possibility of continuously cycling different kinds of power, such as barriers, magic, and dark magic. A thought occurs to him, although he's unsure if it's possible.

"Then, a possibility crossed Tae-san's mind. He thought it might be possible, but he wasn't entirely confident."

Tae-san activates a "manifold rainbow shoot," and a rainbow bursts forth. Leviathan roars, and Tae-san retorts, "Do you think such power would reach me?"

Tae-san then activates "copy," causing the rainbow to duplicate, now appearing twice as bright. Caught off guard by the sudden duplication, Leviathan hesitates.

"Copy. A ridiculously powerful skill that copies power exactly as it is.

But there was a one-hour cooldown. It was hard to use it twice in battle.

But if there's a cycle...

[You activated the cycle.]

Clank.

Time goes back. Forced to rewind. The cycle starts.

And Taesan knew.

Taesan quickly swung his hand.

[You activated Copy.]

Copy is activated again. The light beam quadruples. Leviathan hastily breathes out.

Kwaaaah!

The final breath annihilates all the colorful beams and reveals itself.

[……What are you doing.]

"It's working."

Taesan let out a dry laugh.

The cycle was literally a cycle. It could forcibly cycle everything, including objects.

Even if it was a system, it was the same."
