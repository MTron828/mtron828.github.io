Chapter 207

207. The 51st floor, where mysterious things come to life (4)

Tai Shan gazed out at the lake.

The number of fairies was at least eighty. They were flying around the queen, guarding her as if she were the center of attention.

The lake was not very large, but it was still wide enough to be considered a lake. If the fairies decided to flee, it would be difficult to catch them.

What he aimed for was the wings of all the fairies.

Lee Taeyoon also received the quest to obtain the wings of the fairies.

However, she did not clear the quest properly and only obtained the fragments of the wings.

After that, the quests she received were also just fragments, which she barely managed to collect and clear. Grimlin was so frustrated with her that he couldn't help but feel annoyed.

Grimlin, who had not obtained what he wanted, gave her a trivial reward.

This reward was a blessing powder made from the fragments of fairy wings.

Although it was a trivial reward, it had the amazing effect of continuously recovering physical strength and mana for a certain period of time, making it a remarkable item.
Here is the translation of the text:

So, what kind of reward would you give if you could fulfill the Gremory's expectations?

Tae-san didn't think he could be satisfied with just one spell of alchemy.

The fairies couldn't escape, so they had to be caught.

Tae-san recalled his skills one by one, but he didn't have a skill to catch such a wide range.

"'The world is frozen, but it's ambiguous.'"

The fairies seemed unlikely to hold on, but the queen was the problem. The frozen world didn't just freeze everything instantly, nor did it block everything like a barrier. If you intended to flee, you could escape at any time.

To make them unable to flee, what could you do?

"'Warped spirit tuning.'"

A skill that warps and tunes the spirit.

Could you link it to the frozen world?

I thought about it for a moment, but there was no answer. The proficiency of warped spirit tuning was extremely high, but there was still a limit.

The frozen world was a mid-level magic. The level of the skill was high.

If you tried to put the spirit into it, Tae-san would collapse before the battle even began.

"'A skill lower than the frozen world, and a skill that can be caught.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

In Taesan's mind, a skill suddenly flashed.

Taesan, who had made a decision, immediately began to prepare.

[You have activated the Sadoho [Mixed Spiritual Energy].]

The spiritual energy was infused into Taesan's body. A powerful aura burst forth, piercing through the mantle made of powder and spreading out.

[What's going on?] [This is strange.] [It's strange.]

The fairies felt Taesan's presence and froze in surprise, and Taesan clenched his fist.

[You have activated Marco's fake flames.]

Whoosh!

The flames erupted.

Taesan focused his mind to control the flames, and the flames spreading out from the center of the lake rose up like a wall and surrounded the lake.

[It's fire.] [It's dangerous.]

The fairies were confused and didn't know what to do. The Fairy Queen's eyes also seemed to be trembling.

The first step was cleared. Now it was time for the next step.

Taesan inserted the spiritual energy into the flames that had formed around the lake.

Suddenly, exhaustion overwhelmed him.

It was natural to feel burdened by the responsibility of wrapping the fake flames that had enveloped the entire lake around the spiritual energy.

But he managed to persevere.
Here is the translation of the text:

After going through the trials of Aphrodite, my spiritual energy has greatly increased. Dealing with spirits has become even more gentle, and the burden has also decreased. As a result, I was able to house a big skill that would have been impossible otherwise.

"Huh."

The Mountain God took a deep breath. He had used almost all of his spiritual energy to seal the spirits into the fake flames and succeeded.

"Let's go." "Create a path."

The fairies suddenly released a burst of light towards the flames, but the fake flames absorbed their light without batting an eye.

"Be fierce."

The Fairy Queen appears.

She raises her hand, and seven lights gather at the end of her fingers and shoot out.

"Ki-ki-ki."

A power unlike that of other fairies.

However, she cannot pierce the fake flames. It's not a matter of power, but of will.

The Fairy Queen scowls.

"What's going on?"

The Mountain God appears. The fairies who attacked him cry out in terror and cling to the Fairy Queen.

"A terrifying human." "A human who killed us."

The Fairy Queen sends a stern gaze.

"A despicable human. Why are you attacking us?"

"Those who attack first shouldn't speak like that."
Here is the translation of the text:

The Taesan laughed. The fairy queen's attendants, hidden behind her, shivered even more.

The fairy queen scowled.

[That's just a joke. It's just a joke of our fairy. Humans should accept it with a sense of humor.]

"I'm having fun."

Taesan ridiculed the queen's words.

[Your Majesty.]

The attendants whispered in the fairy queen's ear. When they heard her words, her lips curled into a smile.

[Yes, you have received the request of that ugly and dirty thing. That's why you came to kill us, and it's a matter fitting for a lowly human.]

"Don't deal with it and fight."

[You have activated the icy arrow.]

Taesan revealed a stern face and manifested magic. The icy arrows shot towards the fairies.

[Lowly thing.]

The fairy queen shrugged her shoulders. Shining powder scattered and collided with the icy arrow. The ice that formed with the powder scattered like snowflakes.

The fairy queen smiled.

[We made a dark magic screen to capture you, but it will be your neck that gets choked.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"The Fairy Queen's words were not wrong. He had almost exhausted his magical powers to create a barrier of fire. It was difficult to gain a significant advantage in battle.

"'That won't pinch me at all.'"

But that didn't matter. Even if he didn't have that, he could still win.

"[Go, my children!]"

Kiying.

Dozens of lights burst forth at once. The Taesan laughed and kicked his feet.

"'I won't fight those idiots.'"

"[You have activated the frozen world.]"

The fake flames consume magic and magical powers. Mana was something entirely different.

If you use magical powers to freeze the world, it's not a problem. Using the frozen world alone is no problem at all.

Tch-tch-tch!

Extreme coldness is poured into the flames. The flying lights froze and flew towards the fairy generals who had shot them.

"[Ah!] [Your Majesty!]"

The fairy generals froze and let out a scream.

The Fairy Queen hastily gathered light.

Kiying!

Rainbow-colored lights shot out in all directions, breaking through the cold that was engulfing everything.

The ice had not yet invaded half of the lake.

The Fairy Queen was furious and shouted outside.

"[Human!]"
Here is the translation of the text:

"What's wrong?"

[You've activated the frozen world.]

Whoa!

The chill is coming again.

The face of the Fairy Queen is stiffening. The queen is gathering light again and shooting it at the approaching chill.

Whoa!

But the chill is too intense and massive. The frozen ice that couldn't be stopped starts to approach.

There, the Tai Shan is activated again.

[You've activated the frozen world.]

Whoa!

The chill is amplified even more.

The Fairy Queen is grinding her teeth and flying towards the sky.

[Your Majesty!] [Save us!]

The fairies are trembling, but there is no escape from the wall of flames. They can't withstand the approaching chill and are all frozen.

Only Tai Shan and the Fairy Queen are moving inside the wall of flames.

"It's not bad."

Tai Shan kicked the wall and blew a whistle. Since he defeated the fairies, his level has increased by 2.

While he is happy, the Fairy Queen is furious and screams outside.

[Be careful! My children!]

"If they were that precious, I should have risked my life to protect them."
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan spoke calmly, but his eyes were colder than anyone else's.

"'It's as expected, it won't work on someone of that level.'"

The frozen world was undoubtedly strong. Only a few people could block it, fittingly named as a middle-grade magic.

However, it was still a global magic. It couldn't create such great power for a single target. Even the Fairy Queen could effortlessly block the frozen world if she exceeded a certain level.

[Human.]

A gaze burning with anger was directed at Taesan.

[I'll kill you.]

The Fairy Queen unfolded her wings. She began her attack from the sky, judging the human with a haughty expression.

The powdery fragments scattered and shot towards Taesan like bullets.

It was too much to block. Taesan drew his shield.

Whoosh!

A dull, heavy impact was felt beyond the shield. The impact was as if a small fragment was being pounded like a hammer.

Kiing.

A faint, blue light was attached to the Fairy Queen's finger.

Taesan inserted his shield and planted his foot.

He dodged the blue light aimed at him and rushed towards the Fairy Queen. The Fairy Queen then flew even higher.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A lowly human, clinging to the earth. You cannot reach me."

"Whatever you want."

The Taesan stood on the surrounding trees, his feet rooted firmly.

He trampled the trees and ran rapidly towards the Fairy Queen, his pace quickening.

The Fairy Queen raised her hand, her fingers trembling with anger.

"The earth-dwelling existence is trying to reach the sky."

Kiying.

The light of the unknown color drew a curved line and shot out.

The light that could not be avoided was rushing in from all directions, and the unstable foothold on the trees made it impossible to avoid.

[Your first attack has been nullified.]

The light faded.

The Fairy Queen's eyes widened in surprise.

"What is this?"

Taesan kicked the trees even harder and sped towards the Fairy Queen, his anger growing.

The Fairy Queen's face turned red with rage as she gathered the light.

Taesan kicked the last tree and poured all his strength into it.

[You have activated the jump.]

Kwa-jik.

The tree could not withstand the force and snapped. Taesan's body flew towards the Fairy Queen in an instant.

[Eh.]

Note: The translation is literal and may not be entirely accurate as the text appears to be a mix of fantasy and poetic language.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Fairy Queen took a deep breath and moved her wings. Her body moved to the left, avoiding the attack of Tai Shan.

[I've tried my best, but it's no use. A wingless person can't fly, and will only fall.]

Tai Shan, who had no wings, couldn't move in the air. The Fairy Queen thought this.

[You have activated the air dodge.]

Tai Shan kicked her again.

The Fairy Queen, who was gathering her strength, had her neck grabbed by Tai Shan's hand.

"Let's play together on the ground."

[You have activated the landing.]

Thud! The Fairy Queen fell to the ground, spitting out her breath.

[Human!]

The Fairy Queen, who had fallen to the ground, burst into anger.

A brilliant light burst forth. Sparkling dust rained down like a storm, trying to swallow Tai Shan.

Tai Shan didn't even bother to defend himself and stabbed the Fairy Queen's chest with his sword.

"What the...?! Why my attack is...?!]

The Fairy Queen didn't understand. Every time her attack hit Tai Shan, it was erased. She didn't know that her attack was being negated, and it was impossible for her to comprehend.

Tai Shan grabbed the Fairy Queen's two wings and gave them a powerful pull. Her wings were torn apart.

[Ah, no!]
Here is the translation of the text:

She explodes with power along with her anger.

It's clear that she's strong.

Taesan knew that the enemy below the 51st floor wasn't worthy of meeting her.

However, Taesan was the same in that regard.

Crunch.

Taesan tramples on the Fairy Queen's tantrum and continues to insert the sword.

Soon, she will vomit blood and collapse.

[Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your magic level has increased.] [You have obtained the wings of the Fairy Queen.]

Your level has reached 4. This was the first time you had experienced such a level increase.

It's definitely different from the 51st floor onwards. The rewards for quests and level increases were much higher than before.

"Good."

Taesan gathered the frozen fairy's wings and returned once again.

"Oh, oh, oh!"

The grmlin waiting in front of the house welcomed Taesan with a bright smile.

"This is amazing! And to think you've even taken the queen's things! Good. Very good!"
Here is the translation of the text:

He burst out laughing and hastily attached the queen's wing to his back. With a dazed face, he touched the wing and then shouted to Tai Shan.

"Let's do it like this from now on. If I can do it until the end, I'll not only grant you alchemy but also give you what you desire."

He said with a bloodshot eye.

"The next one is a blue snake that resides in a deep place in the forest. Bring back its scales."
