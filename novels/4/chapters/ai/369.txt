Episode 370

370. The 77th Floor, a World on the Brink of Destruction (2)

[There is no clear answer to this quest. The reward will change depending on how you handle it.]

"How did you clear it?"

[The world I went to was one where the gods were being chased away, but monsters remained. The survivors were being hunted down and killed by the monsters. I gathered them and built a city, and then took care of the monsters. It took about... half a year.]

I also remembered what Lee Tae-yeon said about the 77th floor.

She said that people didn't trust each other.

It wasn't just a simple mistrust, but rather, they didn't see each other as human beings. It was a chaotic world where people would kill each other, thinking that if they didn't kill others, they would be killed themselves.

I suppose it's because the gods contaminated people's minds. I remembered complaining about how I had to use a lot of items to clear it.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Most cases are resolved with force, but the purpose of the quest is to maintain stability, no matter what. As long as the remaining people can survive, even if they're mentally exhausted, it's okay."

Their lives are of no concern, as long as the quest's clear conditions are met.

"What are you going to do?"

"I don't plan on doing anything."

The world Taesan visited was similar to a dying Earth.

It was a rehearsal for reviving a dead Earth. Taesan wasn't just concerned with clearing the quest, but also wanted to try various methods.

"You should leave."

A child said to Taesan, who was wandering around the city.

"This city is dying. You're young and strong, so you can probably make it to another city. And they'll accept you there too."

"I'm not going."

Taesan replied calmly. The child shook his head, as if he couldn't understand.

"You won't receive good treatment."

The abandoned city was slowly dying, with no one coming to its aid.

In such a situation, a young outsider like Taesan was enough to draw people's attention. Before long, everyone in the city knew about Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The people of the city looked at Taesan with unfavorable eyes.

This was a abandoned city that couldn't produce anything, only consuming resources day by day.

In such a place, a young and strong man like him was not treated with respect. Instead, he was seen as a threat who could use his power to oppress others, and his large appetite was a concern.

However, they didn't chase Taesan away.

The people here were all deemed useless and abandoned. That's why the city's people stuck together tightly. They kept Taesan at a distance, but didn't exclude him.

But that didn't mean they were close to Taesan. People kept their distance from him.

Only the old man and the boy had conversations with Taesan.

Taesan was standing on the outskirts of the city, staring blankly at the ground.

The land was polluted.

Even simple farming was impossible on this land. In the past, there were items that could neutralize the pollution, making it possible to some extent, but now such items didn't exist.

"What are you doing?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The old man approached Taesan, patting his back. Seeing Taesan holding a seed in one hand and gazing at the ground, he understood what he was trying to do and shook his head.

"Is that a seed? You have something precious. But unfortunately, it's impossible."

They hadn't given up trying, though. They had defeated monsters and planted the remaining seeds in the ground.

However, nothing had sprouted. The polluted soil's toxins had been too much for the seeds to handle.

So, they had abandoned all the seeds.

"Don't be stubborn and leave. Young man, this place is our grave. You don't need to be buried with us."

The old man said this with a sorrowful tone.

Taesan didn't respond.

He just thought about it.

And then, he made a decision.

Ki-ki-ki-ing!

A golden light appeared on Taesan's hand. The old man's pupils, which had been gazing at him lazily, widened.

"......What's that?"

The old man, who had experienced the war against the gods, remembered.

The terrifying monsters that had descended from the sky.

And the powerful golden light that had crushed them.

What Taesan was showing him now was similar to that golden light.

"It's difficult to cover the entire city, but..."

At least this small open space could be easily covered with divine power.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The divine power expanded and covered the vacant lot. The small vacant lot became the territory of Taesan.

All the powers that Taesan did not permit were excluded. The polluted land was purified, and life began to revive.

"Ah, ah......"

Taesan sowed the seeds as is.

When he was on a quest on Earth, he had brought multiple seeds. The old man's pupils, which had grown as large as they could, grew even larger once again.

The seeds sprouted rapidly.

The buds burst forth, and leaves unfolded. Yellow grains began to form, and a green husk covered them.

In just a few minutes, dozens of corn stalks filled half of the vacant lot.

Green plants grew proudly in the gray city.

Taesan nodded his head.

"It's working."

He opened up a small area of the divine power and activated a temporary farm in that spot.

The farming was successful. If it went like this, the problem of food supply in this city could be solved.

As the pollution itself was purified, if the size of the territory was increased, their dwellings could also be made safe.

"......"

"Let's bring the people here."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan spoke to the old man who was frozen in place, his jaw dropped in shock. The old man was paralyzed, unable to move.

Fortunately, the old man didn't need to move. People who had seen the golden color began to sneak up. They saw the corn and were amazed.

"What, what is it?"

"It's corn! It's corn!"

People's eyes rolled back in their heads as they rushed forward. Taesan didn't stop them.

The rumor spread quickly, and soon the entire city gathered.

They tore into the corn like they were in battle. The small empty lot where the corn grew was all that was left. It wasn't enough to feed the entire city, but it didn't matter. Another corn stalk grew in its place.

"Oh, oh, oh!"

A boy who had heard the news late and rushed over let out a shout of excitement as he tore into the corn. He hastily peeled off the husk and stuffed it into his mouth.

"Ah......"

The corn kernel was hard and difficult to chew, and it felt like his throat was blocked.

But it was refreshing.

It was a fresh, unspoiled ear of corn that hadn't been affected by mold or rot.

The boy was like a newborn baby. It was an experience he had only had in the distant past, something he couldn't even remember now.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Uuuuuuuuuu……."

The boy burst into tears and ate it. The others were not much different. Everyone was crying and putting in the corn.

Before long, their bellies were full, and their sanity returned.

"Why is corn growing in a place like this?"

"No. The golden light that wraps the earth is……."

The old man and Taesan entered, looking bewildered, with their mouths agape.

"Sir, what's going on here?"

The old man didn't answer and just stared at Taesan.

People's gazes turned to Taesan. Taesan, unfazed, opened his inventory.

"Maybe this will work this time."

Taesan scattered black seeds in the remaining space. The people watching had their pupils dilate.

Vines began to grow.

The fruit grew rapidly in size. Before long, a sturdy watermelon filled the remaining half of the empty lot.

People's mouths were in the same state as the old man's.

A stunned silence, filled with awe, enveloped them.

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The atmosphere changed rapidly after that. Taesan was no longer a young man who suddenly appeared at the border.

Taesan became the owner of the abandoned city.

In the city where nothing was produced and people were slowly dying, the problem of food suddenly disappeared. It was strange that the opposite didn't happen.

[Simple farming. That's also an amazing skill. How did you think of getting that skill?]

The ghost also said in amazement. The labyrinth was not a place to live, but a place to conquer. The ghost had never farmed anything because basic food was sold at the store.

Only players who returned to Earth in a special environment were able to obtain that skill.

Taesan asked the boy.

"Is there no livestock like this?"

"Ah, it's over here."

The boy hesitated and guided Taesan. Meanwhile, he glanced at Taesan and couldn't help but ask.

"......Are you really here to save us?"

Some people who saw Taesan creating food whispered that he might be a messenger of God, and the old men in particular supported that claim, saying they had seen similar powers in the past.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan replied.

"It's similar."

The boy's face brightened up.

"Exactly!"

The boy was delighted, as if his thoughts had been confirmed.

Inside the small pen guided by him, there were two emaciated pigs.

They didn't even have the energy to move, only breathing weakly as they lay down.

"Oh dear, no one was taking care of them."

The boy hastily threw some corn. The pigs, with their ears perked up, stumbled towards him with unsteady steps and began to eat the corn.

"I was trying to save them by feeding them precious food, but it was getting to the limit. I was thinking of eating them, but since corn has appeared, maybe we can have... meat..."

The boy's eyes sparkled. Taesan also had the same thought.

Temporary cultivation only applies to plants.

Raising livestock was not a skill.

In their past life, they didn't worry much about it. They were struggling to survive, so they didn't have the luxury to be picky about food.

But if they were going to live in the future, meat was absolutely necessary.

And that meant a large quantity.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan, who had been staring at the pig, took out various materials from his inventory.

There were blue flowers, green leaves, and other diverse materials.

Taesan had been collecting materials for alchemy and partial world transformation whenever he had the chance. He had used most of them in battle, but the ones that couldn't be used in battle were left untouched.

Among them were materials with growth-accelerating effects, but he hadn't had a chance to use them until now.

But now it was different. Taesan took out the materials.

"What?"

The child was surprised. The materials were combining their powers and exerting a strange force.

Taesan focused his mind.

He was finally able to properly wield the alchemy he had learned from Gremlyn.

Kiing!

The harmony of the materials ended, and the power of alchemy enveloped the surroundings.

The pig, which had been slowly eating the corn, suddenly let out a scream.

"Waaaah!"

"Ahk!"

The boy quickly covered his ears. The piercing cry was like a sharp knife cutting through his eardrums.

"What, what?"

The pig's flesh began to grow rapidly. The pig's eyes turned bright red.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The pig let out a loud cry and knocked over another pig. The child was even more shocked.

"Huh?"

"This is how it is. I can handle it a bit better."

I confirmed that alchemy could help with the breeding and growth of livestock.

The problem was where to find the livestock. Since the earth was on the brink of destruction, it was almost impossible to find decent livestock.

"Can I take it as a reward from the labyrinth?"

[But there was no one who wanted that... If you want it, I'll give it to you. Can I ask if I can provide it as a service later after clearing it?]

The confirmation of livestock breeding was over. Taesan summoned Minerva.

"Wow. This place is also a dying land."

"Is it possible to purify the air here as well?"

The polluted air affects not only the players but also the newly born. As the labyrinth players, our physical bodies are strengthened, but the new ones are not.

Minerva is the wind spirit king, ruling over nature itself. The possibility was sufficient.

"Hmm... it depends on the situation, but the gods' powers are almost excluded. I think it's possible to some extent."

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Minerva closed her eyes and focused her energy. The wind began to change slowly, and the flow of air transformed.

At that moment, people realized. They realized that the polluted air had changed. They felt that breathing had become easier, somehow.

The polluted air was being purified.

"It's working."

"But it's not possible to do it on a large scale. The degree of pollution is too severe. At best, it's limited to this city."

"For now, that's enough."

People belatedly came to know about one or two things that Taesan had done.

They began to follow Taesan even more.

The city that was on the brink of destruction was returning to normal, all thanks to Taesan's single hand.
