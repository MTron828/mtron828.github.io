**Chapter 590**

**590. The Outer Story, Mashin (2)**

Taesan knew what kind of place the demon world was.

A dark world. The energy that permeated it was thick and gloomy.

The sun existed, but it was as dark as during an eclipse.

However, there was definitely light.

Although it was a dark and thick light, it illuminated the entire demon world.

But the demon world Taesan arrived at was not like that.

There was no light here.

Darkness covered the entire world.

And that darkness originated from Gosin.

"Hmm."

It was the same energy he had seen in the old Mashin's realm.

But previously, it was only a small part, whereas now the entire demon world was like that.

The current demon world was a realm only for the old Mashin.

"What should I do?"

Achieving his goal was very simple. He just had to use his original power. He could grasp everything in an instant by observing the entire demon world. He currently had that ability.

However, Mashin wanted him to walk through this place, see it, and experience it directly.

"It's better to do as she wants for now.

'That's right.'

He changes his form.

Those who have reached a certain level can somewhat understand the concept of the Great Mountain. It's impossible to completely hide one's overwhelming power, no matter how hard one tries.

So, he thought he could hide it perfectly.

[You have activated the Shape-Shifter.]

Crunch.

There is no visible change on the outside, but the Great Mountain's internal concept and boundaries are transformed.

It's the power of the ancient gods, which has existed since the dawn of creation. It's a strange power that can change one's very essence to what one desires.

Crunch.

And then, the Great Mountain's essence changes.

"I guess this is enough."

Now, he looks like a ordinary servant of the ancient gods. It seems like this is the most comfortable place for him to be active.

The Great Mountain looks up at the sky.

A dark, thick, and empty sky.

Beyond that, he feels a twisted gaze.

A distorted and broken thing that shouldn't exist in this world.

The Lord of the Demon Realm.

"What are you looking at?"

The Great Mountain says indifferently and takes a step forward. He stretches out his hand into the air.

Crunch."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The space splits open, and a sword appears.

[Hello?]

"Hello. Bardley. Is it finally over?"

Bardley asked to be left alone for a moment, saying he wanted to reflect on himself after everything was over. Taesan granted his request.

[Is it finally over?]

Bardley replied.

[About my existence and the direction I should head. I've more or less figured it out.]

"Then are you leaving now?"

[No? I don't think so. At least for a few years, I'll stay by your side.]

"It doesn't matter."

Taesan shook Bardley.

[But... where are we?]

Bardley asked in a trembling tone. He too realized that something was off.

"The old demon realm."

[Huh?]

Taesan lightly mentioned something to the demon and realized where they were now.

[...Wow.]

Bardley let out a sigh of amazement first.

[So we're in the universe controlled by Goshin now?]

"That's right."

[This is crazy. I've experienced all sorts of things. I only heard stories, but I never thought I'd come here myself.]

Bardley let out a burst of laughter.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, what do we do now?"

"Let's take a look around, as the gods wish."

Taesan slowly took a step forward.

"Is it not here?"

To become a god, one must at least have the power of an immortal. There's no specific restriction, but to receive the worship of all, one must have at least that much power.

And it was impossible for Taesan not to sense the existence of such a being.

However, he did not sense the aura of an immortal here.

It was eerily quiet.

"Is this not the demon realm?"

Demons are like humans. They are scattered throughout the universe, and their numbers are countless, exceeding tens of billions.

There could be a demon god somewhere in the universe.

First, it was necessary to understand the current state of the demon realm. How were the demons living here?

And soon, an opportunity to understand that arose.

Taesan sensed the aura of demons nearby, as well as the aura of a being related to the gods.

Taesan took a step forward.

His body jumped through space.

He saw it.

Demons fleeing in terror, filled with fear.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The underlings of Goshin, with joyful faces, chased after them.

"Hahaha! Try to run away! Crawl like a dog!"

The underlings' power was moderate, around B-grade monster level. From Taesan's perspective, they were not even worth considering, but by the universe's absolute standards, they were quite strong.

"Aaagh!"

The demons' stamina was depleted, and they fell. Just as the underlings were about to deliver the final blow, Taesan appeared between them.

"Heh!"

"What the...!"

The underlings were shocked and stopped their attack.

"What, what's going on? Why did you suddenly appear? You're scaring us."

The underling wiped the sweat from his forehead, still looking at Taesan with a mixture of fear and surprise. Taesan opened his mouth.

"What are you doing?"

"What do you mean what? We're hunting. If you suddenly appear in front of us, it's dangerous. What are you doing?"

The underling muttered and waved his weapon.

"I was bored, so I was hunting. Why? You can join in too?"

The underling gave a cruel smile. Taesan didn't respond. The underling's expression turned sour.

"What's with the attitude? What's going on?"

As soon as he finished speaking, the underling charged towards the demons with a full smile, wielding his weapon.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And the weapon was caught in Taesan's fingers.

"Huh?"

"It's typical."

"You, what's with you?"

"Then I'll do it typically too."

Crunch.

The weapon broke.

The underlings tried to respond in shock, but Taesan was much faster. In an instant, the underlings were knocked down and crushed.

Kwagagaga!

That was the end. The underlings disappeared without a trace.

[It was just as expected, not very interesting.]

Bardley muttered gloomily.

This was a place ruled by the old demon king. The demon tribe would be the underlings' plaything. It was just as expected.

"Then..."

Taesan approached the trembling demon tribe, intending to get information from them.

"I have something I want to ask."

"Ah, uh, eh?"

The trembling demon tribe stuttered. Taesan, thinking they would be unable to answer due to panic, used his power to calm them down.

"I'm not your enemy."

The demon tribe's eyes slowly calmed down.

"I have something I want to ask."

Taesan asked again.

The demon tribe opened their mouth.

"Ah, oh? Ah?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[……What's going on?]

And Taesan realized. Something was off.

The demons couldn't understand Taesan's words. It wasn't because their language was different.

It was just that the demons couldn't understand language at all.

"Uh, ah."

[……Is this what it means to be unable to speak at all?]

It wasn't like their tongues were cut off or anything. They literally couldn't produce concrete language. It seemed like they didn't know language itself.

Taesan peeked into the demons' minds.

And realized.

"……There's only emotion."

They couldn't think logically, or reason, or doubt, or predict. All they had were pure emotions like fear and the desire to flee.

They couldn't even think for themselves, and couldn't produce language.

They were no different from beasts with the appearance of demons.

[Uh…….]

Bardley, who realized this fact, was also shocked.

[This is more than I thought.]

"It's a real hunt, indeed."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It wasn't a metaphorical expression. Just like humans holding guns to hunt wild boars, the underlings were the same.

To them, the demon tribe was a wild boar. Nothing more, nothing less.

[This is quite shocking.]

The demon tribe was strong.

They had their own power, could wield dark magic, possessed exceptional intellectual abilities, and had built their own civilization.

But in this place, they were no more than livestock in the truest sense.

[Was it like this during the era when the gods ruled?]

"I need to take a closer look."

Taesan leaps into action. He can sense a vast amount of life energy not too far away.

The place was a city.

And Taesan knew where this place was.

This was where the current Demon King's castle was located.

What he sensed was the energy of numerous underlings and demon tribe members.

Taesan landed on the highest building in the city, hiding his body.

He reads the energy and detects it.

And the information that entered Taesan's mind was a hell beyond his imagination.

* * *

In the past, before life became twisted, Taesan had seen a news report.

It was a news report about a Chinese city building a multi-story pig farm to increase productivity.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Tens of thousands of pigs live their entire lives in cramped spaces where they can't even stand up straight, only to be slaughtered in the end.

It was the same here.

The only difference was that it wasn't pigs, but demons.

As Taesan surveyed the city, he realized one more fact.

'This isn't breeding for food.'

The lowlifes were born from the abyss. They didn't need the universe's organic matter. It was purely for the sake of mocking, hunting, and playing with them.

[Ugh, this is disgusting.]

Bardley spoke with a tone filled with disgust.

'Living and dying is just the law of the jungle. It's a very natural thing, but here, I don't feel any dignity or pride. All I see are foolish people who only mock the weak. If demons are like this, what about other worlds?']

'I don't know either.'

There may not be transcenders. From the moment of birth, there was a god of death. There were transcenders like Dersha.

But Taesan didn't know what they were doing or where they were until he went outside.

'The number of demons is actually increasing.'"

Note: The translation tries to maintain the original tone and nuance of the text, but some phrases may not be directly translatable.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There were more of them than in the current demon world. It didn't seem like they had the freedom to raise them. But the fact that there were this many meant that the low-ranking demons had artificially increased their numbers for their own pleasure.

Taesan wandered around a bit more, but all the cities were the same. He couldn't find a demon with a proper intellect.

"It's a mess."

[Is there a demon god here? It's hard to believe.]

"What should we do?"

It was difficult to find the demon god like this.

At least, it was too much to search for them on foot.

Taesan thought for a moment and made a decision.

"Let's just take a look."

He spreads his hand, and all sorts of concepts begin to gather there. Bardley is shocked.

[What's going on?]

"I don't want to search one by one."

So, he'll just put the entire demon world under his control.

He'll grasp the entire demon world in his hand.

[...Is this okay?]

"If you want to stop me, then stop me."

Taesan said calmly. The concepts gather to form a single shape. The wave that is created is something that only those who are weak can't even feel. A transcendent-level wave that can only be barely grasped by those who have reached the level of a transcendent shakes the demon world.

The preparations are complete. If he just unleashes it, the entire demon world will become Taesan's territory."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, Taesan slowly withdrew his hand. The waves trembled and subsided.

[Huh? Why?]

"There's no need to do it anymore."

Taesan said.

"Because it came from over there."

[This... is crazy.]

The voice echoed. The space cracked and shattered. A massive existence began to reveal itself.

[At first, I thought it was a shape-shifter who came to play. But it wasn't. It was a completely different existence.]

It was a monster that had existed since before the creation of the world, capable of shaking the universe alone and crushing it.

[Not even a transcendent being, nor one of our kind... it's a completely different entity. What is this?]

A dry laugh accompanied its appearance.

[Who are you? Monster.]

Ba'al appeared.
