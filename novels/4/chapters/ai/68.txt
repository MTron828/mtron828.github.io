Episode 69

69. 12th Floor, God of Choices. Maria (1)

The dwarf was a being brought directly by the magician, who settled here right after the place was designed.

Therefore, he had seen countless people who came here.

Among them were those who made a name for themselves from the outside, those who were strong from the beginning, and even owners of astonishing talents whom he saw and still marveled at.

'It was amazing.'

The dwarf reminisced about the past. With each skill gained from a single sword strike and breaking through one floor, his proficiency increased by two digits.

It was literally an unbelievable talent.

When he saw such talents, they were outstanding.

There certainly was talent. If there had been no talent in the first place, he would not have survived until now.

But it wasn't the best talent he had seen.

He had seen many talents at the level of outstanding talent. The world is wide, and there are more worlds than that. Everyone who entered the maze had talent.

'There were also mechanical beings, right?'

There were also those who came from a world so developed that he could not understand.
They dashed through the labyrinth with perfect calculation abilities and judgment. As they approached the middle stages, many of their advantages faded, but at the outset, they were faster than any race.

Yet even they had never displayed figures close to what Taesan was now showing.

"The strongest one had stats in the 250s."

It was nearly double that.

It wasn't just simple talent.

They possessed something else.

Considering their lack of understanding of spiritual ascension, that was the only conclusion they could draw.

"I want to know their skill."

The dwarf licked his lips.

If there was a variable here, it was likely their skill.

In his heart, he wanted to dissect it, but he couldn't go that far, so he could only ask calmly.

"Is this your first time here?"

"Yes."

The aloof mode itself was indeed a first.

Upon the stoic response, the dwarf sighed.

"Really..."

"He's not an easy one to defeat."

To him, Taesan's ability was not just talent but the ability to uphold principles.

Someone with stats of 250 died on the 74th floor. They faced the trials of a god, stripped off all their equipment to fight with only a weapon, and died in the attempt to gain everything.
The man who had exceptional talent died on the 30th floor. He let his guard down against the boss, showed a gap, and ended up receiving a fatal blow, resulting in his death.

"But he won't be like that."

Taesan had sacrificed five stats.

At first, he thought it was reckless, but upon seeing the stats, he realized even that had been restrained. From his perspective, he could sufficiently touch upon attack power and agility.

"It's not like he pursued safety only."

If he had, his current stats would have been completely impossible.

Weighing the value. In that regard, Taesan was perfect.

The dwarf's eyes sparkled.

"No way?"

Initially, it was just a matter of interest. Interest in enduring for a long time, not easily dying. He didn't have any expectations of clearing it at all.

But if it continues like this, if Taesan doesn't make a big mistake and continues to delve into the labyrinth...

"Could it be possible?"

His heart raced for a moment.

Hope that he had long given up on began to sprout.

Taesan, who didn't understand his feelings, looked at the dwarf with a puzzled expression. From his perspective, the dwarf had been lost in thought and suddenly started to sparkle.

The dwarf, belatedly coming to his senses, cleared his throat.

"Well, since it's a, a, a, a deal, alright. Let's cut it by 50%."
Taesan smiled broadly. As much as he had used some tricks, he had worried that there might be some rejection, but those concerns completely disappeared.

"How should I use it?"

"Choose one piece of equipment. I'll give you a 50% discount on that."

The options were presented to him. The item to buy had already been decided.

[Purple Ring: Red Glare] [All Stats +3%] [A ring that has absorbed the energy of the sun falling on rocks until the rocks coalesce.] [100,000G]

"You've made your choice?"

"Yes."

He hadn't even considered other equipment from the start.

Of course, all of them were good pieces of equipment. They would last quite a long time if worn.

But if you asked whether they were worth emptying your wallet right now, they were not.

He had no problem up to the 20th floor right now.

As his stats and level continued to rise and he acquired skills, when he reached the 20th floor, there was a good chance that even the 25th or perhaps the 30th floor would not be a problem.

And by then, the value of the other equipment would have faded. This place accelerated growth, so it would lose much of its significance.

But a percentage increase would be useful at any time.

Moreover, since this ring could accommodate the most enhancements, its value would only increase further.

"Do as you wish."
The dwarf spoke gruffly, but inwardly he was quite satisfied. As far as he could see, that was the correct course of action. Taesan seemed more attractive to him little by little.

"But when will you buy it?"

"It might take some time. For now, I'm keeping an eye on it."

Currently, he had about 20,000 gold. Despite saving up so carefully, it was far from enough for the 50,000 gold price tag.

Taesan realized.

"I guess this wasn't meant to be bought with money in the first place."

If he hadn't incurred penalties, he would have barely been able to afford one by reaching the 30th floor.

He clicked his tongue.

"How much grinding did she do?"

Itaeyeon came out almost fully equipped like that. She hadn't even engaged in penalty play with Taesan, so she must have bought everything at full price.

It literally meant she had sacrificed sleep and relentlessly performed repetitive tasks.

While Taesan admired her determination, the dwarf was stroking his chin.

"I need to do some adjustments on this. I'll stop the penalties here. I'm a merchant after all. I don't give away things for free."

He accepted it calmly, as he had expected this part.

The dwarf didn't like such benefits, preferring to give appropriate rewards instead.
Still, it reduced by 50,000 gold. Anyway, it was a big profit.

"Think about it a bit more and then speak."

"Then I'll go."

"Go ahead. My boy."

The dwarf grumbled, but there was a pleased smile on his face.

Taesan turned away from him and headed into the labyrinth.

He passed through the 12th floor just like the 11th. This time it was ghouls.

"Ghouls stronger than skeletons?"

["Who would be stronger between someone with flesh and someone with only bones?"]

"Is that so?"

Taesan nodded in agreement with the plausible statement.

Before long, he discovered an altar of the god.

* * *

[You have discovered Maria's altar.] [First discovery bonus] [Intelligence has permanently increased by 3. Mana has permanently increased by 5.]

There was a statue of the goddess holding scales.

It was so gigantic that it nearly filled half the room, a size that could overwhelm an ordinary person just by the statue itself.

"Quite imposing."

At the altar, he could discern the characteristics of the corresponding god. Immediately, Rocky's altar was like that, adorned with violence and blood as if loving strife.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"In contrast, Maria's altar had no special decorations. There was only a statue of a goddess holding scales standing solemnly in the room.

If there had been no explanation, it would have been difficult to recognize it as an altar of a god.

'Which god is this?'

Itaeyeon didn't know all the gods, including Maria, that she mentioned.

[Uh......]

The ghost hesitated. It was an attitude that felt reluctant.

[She's a goddess of choice...... Um......]

'Why?'

[No, it's nothing.]

The ghost changed the subject.

[Our conditions are different, so I can't say much. When it comes to gods, she's strong. Very.]

'How strong?'

[Comparable to Rakiratas.]

'Even if you say that, I don't really understand.'

He hadn't properly seen the extent of a god's power yet. The ghost let out a wry smile.

'You'll find out as you go down. Anyway, just remember this much. Powerful gods tend to be capricious.'

'Hmm.'

Even so, nothing would change. The trials of the gods give many things. He had no intention of being scared and running away.

As Taesan approached the altar, power flowed from the statue of the goddess."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"A solemn yet thick and deep power began to take shape.

[Sub Quest Initiated] [Maria wishes to test those who come to her altar. If accepted, trials will come to you. Overcome them, and rewards will follow.] [Maria's interference area diminishes.] [Maria proposes enhanced trials for you.]

"Enhanced trials right away?"

There was no sign of hesitation as before. The ghost responded as if it were obvious to Taesan, who frowned.

"Your story must have spread among the gods. Since I know everything, there's no need for formalities. Unlike Rakiratas, I won't deceive you halfway, so rest assured."

Anyway, acceptance is confirmed.

[Sub Quest Initiated.] [Maria lets out a laugh.] [Maria's domain diminishes.] [You are given a choice.] [What do you prefer?] [Many enemies vs Few enemies.]

Taesan hesitated at the sudden system window.

"What's this?"

"Literally the god of choice. Choose as you wish."

It feels unsettling.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

There was no right answer to what consequences this choice might bring. It felt like an atmosphere where even the ghost wouldn't answer if asked.

After a moment of hesitation, Taesan made a choice.

"Few enemies."

If it's a problem without a correct answer, he answers honestly. That was Taesan's approach.

Moreover, there had been several occasions where the gods seemed to read his memories. There was no reason to antagonize them for no reason.

The choices appeared once again.

[Diverse types of enemies vs Few types of enemies.]

"Few types."

It was easier to deal with those who simply used swords neatly than with those who complicated things with magic, illusion, swords, and arrows.

[Combat with movement vs Combat without movement.]

"With movement."

He enjoyed fighting while dodging around and using the environment to his advantage as much as possible.

Choices continued to be presented. Whether it was about quantity versus a little at a time, enemies using spears versus enemies using magic, it was all about combat.

Taesan's face became increasingly uneasy.

But now he couldn't turn back on his choices. He continued to answer honestly as he had done so far. After dealing with about ten more questions like that, the choices finally stopped.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

[Maria is satisfied.]

Clang!

The statue of the goddess disappears. The room momentarily expands. Taesan is left alone in a room twice as large.

Squelch.

Monsters appear.

Taesan grimaces at their number.

There are so many.

The monsters fill the expanded room completely, leaving no empty space.

And each one had a strong personality. There were large ones, tiny ones like children, ones with long arms, ones floating in the air, and so on. There were so many of them.

Keying.

A red circular barrier surrounds Taesan. It's a distance he can move with two large steps.

[You will lose if you move beyond this space.]

"Damn."

The words couldn't continue.

The monsters charge at him all at once.

Taesan adjusts his posture with an irritated expression. He draws his twin swords and enhances his senses.

[You activate the Breathless Attack.]

First, eliminate the constraint of breathing and assess the attack. One goblin directly ahead. One ogre to the left. One lizardman to the right. One monster wielding a spear behind him whose name he doesn't know.

He plans his moves and acts swiftly.
Here is the English translation of the text:

Twisting the goblin's neck and striking the ogre's face. Lowering his waist, Taesan dodges the spear of the lizardman and sweeps it aside.

"Kak!"

"Keyak!"

The monsters are thrown, but Taesan furrows his brow. They were noticeably stronger than the monsters he usually encountered. It meant they were enhanced by trials.

As they fly away, new monsters immediately brandish weapons. Taesan tries to step back and widen the distance, but a red barrier blocks his movements.

"Damn."

It's certain. The trial has begun in a way that opposes every method he has chosen and prefers.

"So this is what the God of Choice is about."

Among the monsters, there were many he didn't recognize. There were even some that didn't seem like they would appear from such a low level no matter how you looked at it.

As the crow flying just above Taesan muttered "Moore," magic began to unfold.

Taesan pulls out a dagger he had temporarily and throws it. The dagger pierces the crow's head, disrupting the magic. He then lowers his stance and kicks. The body flew through the sky.

The crow, pulling out the embedded dagger with a whining sound, hesitated.

"Die."

Crunch.

The crow shattered.

[Proof of your struggle has been activated.]
