Chapter 143

143. 32nd floor, the trial of the sword. Ehilli (3)

"'Accel?'"

Bardray was taken aback in an instant.

This was because Ehilli's trial prohibited the use of all skills unrelated to the sword.

Accel was a skill that accelerated speed, but it was not a sword technique, so it was impossible to use.

To break the conditions of the trial, one would need to be as strong as the god, and at least, the current Taesan was not like that, so it was one.

Then, the answer was clear.

"'Is that a new sword technique? How unique.'"

Since it had come out of Taesan's body, Taesan couldn't immediately know what it had obtained. Taesan had created a new sword technique, and he had mainly used skills, so he thought it was related to skills.

"But."

Accel was a skill that accelerated the speed of charging at the enemy. Bardray knew what kind of skill it was. It was not a problem at all to block it.

Taesan quickly approached and swung the sword.

Bardray, who was trying to block it, was taken aback.

The speed of the sword strike changed.

"Ack!"
Here is the translation of the text:

Bardray's hands moved erratically. The sound of the sword clashing was loud and echoed through the air.

Bardray blocked the attack with a bewildered expression.

The attack was faster than before.

"'It's impossible for agility to increase this much!'"

Acceleration only affects the speed of the charge and has no relation to agility. Tai Shan continued to wield the sword.

[You have activated the Strong Impact.]

Kaaang!

Bardray's arm flew out suddenly. Bardray quickly adjusted his stance without being flustered.

The Strong Impact not only deals damage but also increases the force of the sword for a moment, making it a useful skill. Even if Bardray used both Acceleration and Strong Impact, it wouldn't be unusual.

However, Bardray was shocked by the next combination.

Kaaang!

"'Eh?'"

Bardray's arm was pushed back again.

"What's going on?"

The Strong Impact loses its effect after one collision. However, Tai Shan attacked twice, and the effect of the Strong Impact remained even though it wasn't used again.

"What's going on with this?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The Taesan's swordsmanship itself didn't change much. After calming his mind and finding his composure, he could defend against the attacks and even counterattack to a certain extent.

However, a change that he couldn't have imagined made his hands tremble, and he could only defend.

[You activated the jump.]

Ka ka ka!

Taesan raised his sword. With a heavy sense and a calm expression, his body rose into the air.

After widening the distance and landing, he let out a forced laugh.

"Did my skills change?"

Acceleration, jump, and shockwave.

All of these skills showed completely different effects from what was expected.

"What's going on……."

Taesan decided to show rather than explain, and moved to demonstrate.

Ka ka ka!

The sword clashed. Baedray's eyes changed. His arm moved awkwardly and soon created many afterimages of knives.

The first sword of the Storm Scar. Wolf's fang.

Unlike before, Taesan didn't use the Storm Scar to block the attack, but instead pushed the sword forward.

[You activated the slide.]

At the moment when Baedray's sword was about to touch Taesan's, it slipped away.

This was the same for the next attack.

Like acceleration and shockwave, the slide continued to activate.

"What's this……."

Ku ku ku!
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san stepped on the ground and swung his sword. A loud noise and a burst of wind followed.

Tae-san's movements, which had been awkward at first, became faster and more precise as the battle continued.

The situation turned around. Badrey was now in a desperate situation.

Kakak!

Tae-san brought his sword down. Badrey tried to block it with his sword.

[You have launched a continuous attack.]

Kaaaah!

The sword began to tremble violently. The intense vibration was transmitted to Badrey's arm. Although he barely managed to hold on, he couldn't hide the gap.

Tae-san didn't let go.

He moved both swords simultaneously and struck Badrey. Badrey tried to block it with one hand, but couldn't block all of the swords.

Swoosh.

Tae-san's sword pierced Badrey's chest.

Badrey gazed at the torn fabric of his clothes, and Tae-san took a breath.

[You have created the advanced sword technique [Ability Sword].]

It was not learned, not obtained, and not mastered. It was a sword technique created by Tae-san himself.

[Condition achieved] [Ehiri is satisfied with the result.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The system window announcing the clearing of the trial appears.

Bardray bursts out laughing.

"This is beyond my imagination."

I had expected a change related to skills, and I even thought about the possibility of being able to use skills. But this was beyond that.

The effects of the skills themselves have changed.

"This is......"

It's a mystery system, and it's interfering with the martial arts itself.

Just as I was thinking that, Bardray's body suddenly began to disappear into light particles.

"Oh, is that it?"

The body he received was a temporary body lent by Ehill for the trial. Since the trial is over, it's only natural to take it back. Bardray looked at the hand that was slowly disappearing.

"Aww, it's a pity."

It's been a very long time since I've held a sword, and I forgot what it was like.

But it's also over now, and it's too sad.

"Anyway, it was kind of fun. Now I know what I meant by my words."

Tai Shan nodded his head.

This is definitely a realization that can only be gained through a confrontation with someone else.
Here is the translation of the text:

He couldn't do it alone. The 30-story monster, with its extremely high stats and realm, couldn't be defeated by his swordsmanship. It was only natural that he couldn't grasp his limitations and weaknesses, and he had to go down as he was.

Just before dying, he barely felt his limitations and the solution, and he was able to obtain it by fighting against a ghost who used the same swordsmanship.

"Thank you."

"Don't just thank me, thank Ehilri too. He made it, after all."

Bardray's physical body was almost completely shattered.

Now, only his upper body remained.

He smiled slyly.

"I'm curious too. What did you learn? Let's take a look together."

He said that, and Bardray disappeared.

The scattered light particles gathered together to form the shape of a ghost.

Tae-san watched him quietly.

* * *

The ghost returned to Tae-san.

After getting his body back, he lost it again, but he still had a very bright appearance.

It was hard to tell if it was an act or genuine, but Tae-san knew that he was considering him. Therefore, Tae-san also started to tidy up without saying a word.

[Ehilri proposes a contract of atonement to you.]

"I won't accept."

Tae-san refused as always. Ehilri didn't seem to have high expectations, and he left quietly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The divine presence was no longer felt on the altar."

As the ghost had said, it was a calm and tranquil divine being. In fact, the ghost said that this was unusual.

"[That indifferent god has given me a physical body while cutting off its interference zone, and has made me create a new sword technique. This is... a very rare occurrence.]”

"Really?"

"[I think I can expect more attention from you than from my disciples.]”

I didn't know the details, but I had high expectations of his abilities.

"Alright."

Ehiri gave him two rewards. One was a skill and the other was an artifact.

[Skill: Special Active Skill: Wielding the Sword] [Proficiency: 1%] [Recognized by the God of Swords. When fighting against an opponent who wields a weapon, one can easily detect their weaknesses and vulnerabilities.]

It was a skill that would be effective against opponents who wielded weapons. Although the conditions were limited, it was a significant advantage to better detect weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

And the artifact was a formmel on the hilt of the sword.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Ehiri's disciple created a formel] [Attack power + 10] [A formel created by those who believe in the god of the sword, with a sense of satisfaction. Ehiri's aura is slightly infused in it.] [It helps to balance the sword's equilibrium.] [This effect can be released at any time and replaced with another weapon.]

"I like it."

What I liked most was that it was very easy to attach and detach.

Tae-san directly equipped the formel to the relic of Kart.

"This explanation is getting longer and longer."

[As the former owner, I have a strange feeling.]

As soon as Tae-san equipped the formel, he felt that the weight of the sword had changed.

After swinging it a few times to confirm, he smiled satisfactorily.

"Is it good?"

It became even easier to swing. Although it's a subtle difference, it's a huge difference for someone who has to swing it tens of thousands of times.

[So, is that it? Let's check it quickly. I'm dying to know.]

The ghost prompted Tae-san. Tae-san opened the system window he had closed.

[You have created a high-level sword technique [Ability Sword].] [You have created a sword technique. You have obtained the title [Zunshi's Qualification].] [The high-level sword technique [Furious Scar] has been integrated into the high-level sword technique [Ability Sword].] [You have created your own sword technique. Achievement accomplished. Strength + 50, Agility + 50, Intelligence + 50, Health + 200]

The achievement number was extremely high.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

If it's 50, it's a number comparable to clearing a simple theme layer.

It's just a simple creation of martial arts that can achieve this level.

[Hurry, hurry, take a look.]

Now is the time to check the skills. The ghost is eagerly waiting with interest.

[High-level martial arts: Ability Sword] [Proficiency: 7%] [A unique martial art created by the Adventurer of the Labyrinth. It is based on the system of the Labyrinth and was created as a foundation. A few skills can be perfectly linked with martial arts and used.][Really.]

The ghost let out a laugh.

[Really...... The content of the skills is changing? It's far beyond the high level, but is it a skill that can't be grasped even by the highest level?]

The ultimate technique, Ailak's No-Technique, deals damage regardless of where the owner's body is attacked. It was a technique that interfered with the system itself.

Right now, the martial arts created by Tai Shan are no different. It is possible to convert the content of the skills that no one can touch, so if the ghost sees it, it's just a little more developed to be worthy of aiming for the highest level.
Here is the translation of the text:

At a glance, it was clear that his proficiency had changed.

His proficiency with the sword of the storm was 39%. Even if it was integrated with the ability sword, the proficiency was only 7% higher.

This difference was significant between the two swordsmanship techniques.

[What exactly changed about the skill?]

"It seems that... I can roughly understand now."

After examining the skills, I found that a few new content had been added.

However, I had to confirm something else first.

[Rank: Qualified for the title of Master Swordsman] [The creator of swordsmanship. Can pass on the swordsmanship he created to his disciples. Only a small number of swordsmen among many can reach this level.] [Strength + 50] [Agility + 50] [Intelligence + 50] [Attack power + 20] [Defense power + 20] [The speed of improving swordsmanship proficiency increases significantly.] [You can also pass on your swordsmanship to others if you want.]

"Did you get this?"
Here is the translation of the text:

[I've got it. I've modified the original skill to fit my own style, so it's quite good. I'd say my proficiency has increased by over 40%. It's that good.]

"That's... quite rewarding, isn't it?"

Tae-san had a few more skills that increased proficiency or titles. He didn't know how they would affect each other, but he would get an additional 50% increase.

And there was also the part about transmission.

"Can I transmit it to someone like Tae-yeon or Kang-jun-hyeok?"

He would check it out when they met next.

[But I'm actually getting curious now?]

The ghostly voice said with a fervent tone.

Tae-san could easily read the ghost's intentions.

"But I don't really understand either."

When fighting with ghosts, he didn't read the explanations one by one. After grasping the overall feeling, he relied on his instincts to continue the battle.

"You can try it out yourself and it'll be easy to understand."

Tae-san moved.
