Chapter 333

333. The World of the Ghost's Demise (4)

With those words, the ghost closed its mouth. The dragon, which had been gazing at the ghost with a mixture of emotions, turned its gaze to Taesan.

[You are a being who has descended to this place according to the will of the gods. Take it.]

A pure white energy flowed from the tip of the dragon's claw to Taesan.

[You have been recognized as qualified by the dragon who protects the world.] [Then, I hope to save even this false world.]

The dragon disappeared into the valley once again.

Taesan asked the disappearing dragon, "Are you not going to do anything?"

[I am the guardian of the world. I exist to protect it from external enemies. In other words, unless it's an attack from an existence like Goshin, I cannot intervene.]

The dragon spoke with a sorrowful tone and disappeared into the valley.

[It's a ridiculous thing. Knowing about the destruction, yet being unable to do anything is my role.]

Taesan, who had completed the third trial, returned to the Imperial Palace.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Before even a few days had passed, Bardray was greatly surprised by the return of Taesan.

"Already? You're quite fast."

"I've completed the third trial."

"...What?"

"How will the remaining trials proceed?"

There were two remaining trials. One was to obtain the root of the World Tree in the Elf's domain, and the other was to retrieve the fragment of the God that was lodged in the sacred land.

Bardray, who was still in awe, stroked his chin.

"Well, in any case, we're already working on the fourth trial. I sent an envoy to the Elf's domain. It's about time they returned..."

Just as Bardray finished speaking, a maid rushed in with a pale face.

"Your Highness, the envoy you sent to the Elf's domain..."

"A problem has arisen."

The maid hastily led Bardray away. At the entrance of the palace, there was only one horse. The people were watching with gloomy faces, but no one dared to approach.

"Hmm."

Bardray stroked his chin expressionlessly.

On the horse, a severed ear was placed.

"I didn't touch the horse. Is this the work of a natural-born species?"

He calmly assessed the situation and turned his gaze to Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It seems like they're quite opposed to our approach. I'll have to go directly. This time, I'll go with you too."

"Is that an order from His Highness the Prince?"

"To cater to those stubborn guys' tastes, it seems like I need to bring out my noble bloodline."

Bardley's eyes were filled with curiosity as he spoke.

A few hours later, Bardley, who had finished preparing, set off with Taesan.

The imperial citizens sent off Bardley, who was heading to the Elf's territory, with cheers and applause.

Some of them were taken aback by Taesan's presence, but they didn't stop their enthusiasm.

Just from that, it was clear that Bardley received great respect from them.

The ghost quietly watched over the things it had once possessed.

The Elf's territory was near. Since it was right next to the empire's territory, they could approach without any trouble.

"I don't think we know exactly what kind of race the Elves are either."

Riding his horse, Bardley said. Taesan was slowly catching up to him, walking beside him. At first, Bardley had laughed awkwardly, but now he seemed to have grown accustomed to it and responded calmly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They're a species that blocks access from the outside and lives in their own world. Many things are shrouded in mystery. I thought they would cooperate since they're part of the prophecy... but I didn't expect them to kill the messenger. It might not be easy to resolve this."

Before long, they arrived at the elves' territory.

A vast forest stretched out before them.

Taesan sensed the presence emanating from a massive tree beyond the mountains.

The World Tree. Taesan had seen equipment that utilized it deep within the forest.

"A noisy welcoming party," Bardray muttered. He could feel multiple presences approaching from within the forest.

The prince stepped forward, facing the forest, and declared, "Hear me! Elves! I am Bardray Alkerait, the rightful prince of the Kavert Empire! I have something to say to you about the prophecy!"

Thwack!

As soon as Bardray finished speaking, an arrow flew towards him.

Bardray swung his sword to deflect it, while Taesan lightly waved his hand to catch the arrow.

"I think it's only polite to show one's face. Is the elves' etiquette different?"

Bardray spoke nonchalantly, and the elves, seemingly judging that they couldn't easily chase them away, began to reveal themselves.

"Wow."

Bardray let out a small sigh of admiration.

The elves were as beautiful as a story.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He possessed a beauty that was hard to find in the human world.

However, he quickly regained his composure.

"I'm not as good as Levansia," he muttered to himself.

The elf, who had revealed himself, glared at Bardley with a twisted face. He looked at the grass Bardley had stepped on and spat out harshly.

"How dare you, a lowly human, set foot in our domain?"

The elf raised his hand, and the bowstring was drawn taut.

Bardley raised his hand as well.

"Let's talk, elf. You also know about the prophecy, don't you?"

He smiled faintly and spoke in a gentle tone.

"The demon king will soon invade the world. To stop him, we need to fulfill the prophecy. I know you elves hate us humans, but this is a matter of the world's survival, so why don't we cooperate for now?"

"Get lost."

The elf replied sharply.

Bardley scowled.

"Is that a refusal?"

"We don't cooperate with inferior beings like you."

The elf's words were not just empty threats, and he swung his hand. A hail of arrows poured down.

Thud!

"I can't understand," Bardley said, deflecting the arrows.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If the prophecy isn't fulfilled, we can't defeat the Demon King. Then, you all will perish as well. Do you want that to happen?"

"What does the Demon King have to do with us?"

The elf sneered at Bardley.

"We're not weak enough to be destroyed by such a trivial device. Get lost."

"That's your thought, and I won't intervene... but if you don't cooperate, the world will be destroyed. Isn't it possible to cooperate to that extent?"

"Why should we cooperate? That's exactly what we want to happen."

The elf spoke coldly.

"In this world, there's no need for any other species besides us. They're just pests that exploit nature and destroy the world. If we're wiped out by the Demon King, I'd even be grateful."

Bardley's face hardened.

The elf's gaze turned to Taesan.

"Especially you, with black hair. You're a descendant of that traitor, aren't you? How dare you, with your filthy blood that betrayed the world, trespass on the elf's territory?"

"You're being too extreme, elf," Taesan muttered.

"Isn't what you're doing right now a betrayal?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Nonsense. Only we are recognized in this world. It's what the world wants, for you humans to die."

The words were filled with contradictions and hatred.

The elf spoke harshly, as if he had no intention of continuing the conversation.

"Shut up. If not, then..."

"What are you going to do?"

Taesan took a step forward, and the emotions emanating from him grew even stronger. The elf's face contorted in anger.

"Then die. Spirits!"

Nature responded to the elf's will, and the scene unfolded.

Arrows flew through the air, faster than ever before, and the grass and trees rose up to grab Taesan's feet. The spirits began to appear.

Taesan gazed at them calmly.

The arrows flying through the air, about to hit Taesan, all bounced off at the last moment.

The grass and trees that had risen to grab his feet, as if frightened, fell to the ground.

The spirits that had appeared, seeing Taesan, took a step back in fear and began to retreat on their own accord.

"What, spirits! Why?"

"Your Highness, it's okay."

"......You are the brave warrior. Do as you please."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The prince withdrew with a cold, frozen face.

"What a boring species."

Taesan gazed at the elves.

They were flustered because their attacks weren't working.

The ghost's emotions were transmitted to Taesan.

The intense emotions boiling up wanted to take a single action.

This quest was one that moved with the master of memories, and the reward changed according to those emotions.

So, it was only natural to act according to the master's wishes.

"Can you guys stop the demon king or something?"

Then, it was possible to stop this as well.

The flames that had once destroyed the world began to manifest in Taesan's hands.

[You have activated the calamity's spark.]

The flames wildly swept through the forest.

* * *

"Ah!"

The elves screamed. They summoned spirits and tried to extinguish the flames that were engulfing the forest by drawing water.

But it was no use.

The flames that were burning the world only moved according to Taesan's will. Instead, they absorbed the water and spirits, growing even stronger.

"Human!"

A furious roar erupted.

Hundreds of arrows flew towards Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan didn't respond at all.

Thud!

The arrow fell before it even reached Taesan.

The elves were too weak to do anything to Taesan. Taesan ignored them and entered the burning forest.

[He's quite something.]

The ghost, who had been silent, spoke up. There was a rare hint of pleasure in its voice.

The elves resisted.

They fought back desperately, trying to kill Taesan.

But instead, they ended up dying.

At some point, the elves who had been attacking Taesan with swords disappeared.

Taesan entered the forest.

"Ah, ahh...…"

In front of the World Tree, there was an old elf. The ghost saw the elf and sneered.

[Long time no see. That disgusting face too.]

"Ah, ahh...…"

The elf looked around at the devastation and contorted its face.

"How dare you! How dare you desecrate the elven realm and attack us! You will receive divine punishment! The gods will not forgive you!"

[Divine punishment? Not forgive?]

The ghost's emotions began to erupt in response to the elf's voice.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You guys, take back what you said! What did I tell you? Just open the path for me once! I begged on my knees, but you didn't open the way!]

Even though I'm already a being that's died, the emotions of a ghost are taking shape.

The elf's face turns pale.

[I didn't ask for much! Just a little! I only wanted to fulfill a small prophecy! It wouldn't have been difficult for you either! I said I'd give you a part of my life if everything ended! But you guys mocked me instead! You clung to your own selfish desires, even as the world was ending! And in the end, the world was destroyed!]

"Ugh, ugh..."

The elf collapses.

Overwhelmed by powerful emotions, their mind is lost. The ghost grits its teeth.

[I accepted you as equal beings. That's why I tried to accommodate your claims as much as possible. But you guys just mocked me. You guys... are useless existences in this world.]

Taesan stands in front of the World Tree. Even amidst the flames that burn the world, the World Tree remains unscathed, not a single branch burned.

Puff.

Taesan takes a deep breath, grips his sword, and plunges it into the ground, grasping the leaves that tremble with the roots amidst the flames.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

* [You have obtained the root of the World Tree.]
* [You have obtained a leaf of the World Tree.]
* [You have plundered the root of the World Tree, which is protected by the Elves.]

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
