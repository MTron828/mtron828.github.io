Chapter 267

267. The Spirit King's Sword and Shield (1)

The power is overwhelming.

A fierce and strong power that even the mighty mountains cannot ignore, the will of those who have reached the pinnacle.

The ghost laughs mockingly.

"[Are you next?] [... Warrior.] [Did they also hurry to bring you, the king's sword and shield? They must have been desperate to kill him.] [Don't ask us questions. We will only follow the king's orders.]"

The one who calls himself the shield speaks calmly.

Barajas lets out a small sigh at their momentum.

"[Hmm...] [You're... a top-grade spirit, I see.]"

Their eyes, looking at Barajas, gleam with interest.

"[How dare you try to defy the king? You've even made a contract with a top-grade spirit.] [Be quiet.]"

Barajas speaks in a sarcastic tone. While the sword and shield may be considered higher-grade spirits, no respect is evident in his voice.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Those who have abandoned their duties and fled here dare not speak to me.] [We will only follow the king's will.]"

The spirit, who called himself a window, replied.

"[You have no reason to lecture me.] [I will do so.]"

Barajas was ultimately a high-ranking spirit. Whatever he said did not apply to the window and shield.

Barajas. He was the word.

He swallowed his next words. Taesan looked around.

No matter how hard he looked, the 6th-level adventurers were nowhere to be found.

"I guess they're all dead."

It was regrettable. If he had defeated them, he could have gained a lot from the increase in spiritual power. He could have become even stronger than he is now.

He must have been killed to prevent that. Although he doesn't know about the increase in spiritual power, at least he knows that killing the same adventurer yields the most gains, so they must be aware of it too.

"Well... you're the last one, I suppose."

Taesan draws his sword.

Extremely powerful beings. There are two of them.

"[The opponent is a difficult enemy to defeat.]"

As always, the system window appears and informs him of the situation.

"What's your name?"

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"[There is no name to answer the heavens, but... I can grant the last wish of the one who will soon die.] [I am Hasan.] [I am Kae.] [I am the spirit that protects the great king.]

The one called the shield is Hasan. The one called the sword is Kae.

[According to the great king's will, I will kill you, human.]

Taesan laughed.

"Good."

In the end, it's important who emerges victorious.

Taesan drew his sword.

"I'll leave the rest to you."

[You are the wind spirit king. You summoned Minerva.]

The wind blew.

Hasan and Kae, who were about to clash with all their might, stopped.

[This power...][Unbelievable.]

The gathering wind took shape. A woman with blue hair appeared.

She waved her hand.

"Hello."

[Your Majesty...]

"Yes. This day has finally come."

Minerva stepped forward with a bitter expression. Her opponent was taken aback by the sudden appearance of the spirit king.

"Taesan, who is my enemy?"

"The one on the other side, the one who calls himself the sword."

"Got it. Barcaza, let's go."

As soon as Minerva finished speaking, she struck the air. The wind became a bullet and shot towards Kae. Kae was shocked and surrounded his body with flames.

Whoosh!

Here's the translation of the text from Korean to English:

"[Gasp!]"

Minerva charges at him.

Quya screams.

"[Your Majesty! Why?!]"

"Are you asking me for a reason?"

Minerva presses him with a smile.

Taesan points his sword at Hasan and says,

"Then let's do it."

"[...So, you're a human who's contracted with the king?]"

"Do you understand now?"

"[But it doesn't matter.]"

Hasan calmly raises his sword, which is as long as Taesan's body, and stamps the ground with his shield, covering himself completely.

"[We move according to the king's orders. It doesn't matter who you've contracted with. So, die.]"

The battle begins.

At the same time, the opponent's skills are activated in succession. The wind wraps around his body, and flames rise from the ground.

"[You've activated the Dark Emperor's skill [Darkness and Chaos].] [You've activated the King's Vessel skill.]"

Taesan focuses his mind and looks at the enemy in front of him.

The Spirit King's shield. It looks more like a huge armor than a spirit. It's three times larger than Taesan.

The wielder seems to be using a sword and shield, which is unusual for a spirit.

Hasan's foot rises.

"Kuung!"

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"With a loud noise, Hasan's physical body accelerates. He charges forward, determined to crush Taesan with his massive shield.

It wasn't fast, but it was heavy. His charge was filled with the intention of crushing everything in his way.

Taesan raised his sword against the charging shield. He tried to use his agility to dodge it.

But at that moment, his senses warned him.

"Block it, or you'll die."

Taesan tried to block it, but his feet were stuck.

KUUUUNG!

The charging shield collided with the wall, causing the entire floor to shake greatly.

"Not bad."

KWANG!

Hasan charges again, swinging his massive sword down.

Taesan swings his dual swords.

KAAANG!

And Taesan's sword is knocked away.

With a strong force, Taesan's face contorts as he tries to move his body. He dodges the wildly swinging sword and tries to shake it off.

"Strong."

And that's not all. A strange power is felt from the opponent's sword and shield.

He raises his sword against the wildly swinging sword.

"You used agility."

Hasan is indeed strong, but not strong enough to crush Taesan's agility with brute force."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"As Taesan's sword collided with Hasun's, their trajectory was supposed to be deflected, but Hasun's sword pierced through and struck Taesan's.

Kaang!

Taesan takes a step back, creating distance. Hasun charges forward like a wild beast, raising his shield.

[You activated Random Blink.]

Taesan moves behind Hasun and stabs his sword into Hasun's waist.

[You activated Plus.] [Hasun takes 403 damage.]

It was a ridiculously small amount of damage.

Despite the 60% increase in spirit damage from the spirit-related title and the berserk spirit's effect, only 400 damage was dealt.

[How pathetic!]

Hasun lets out a loud roar, grasping his golden sword.

[Behold, the power of the depths.] [Hasun activated Golden Annihilation.]

Kying.

The golden energy bursts out of the sword, materializes, and begins to engulf everything in its vicinity.

Kugugugugu!

Taesan quickly creates distance, overwhelmed by the crushing destructive power. But he couldn't completely avoid it.

[Your first attack was completely nullified.]

Time rewinds.

Taesan and Hasun's bodies return to their previous state before the attack.

[Huh.]

For the first time, Hasun's voice is tinged with surprise and disbelief."

This appears to be a fantasy-based game or novel excerpt, with characters engaging in combat and using special abilities and skills.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

**Taesan activates his acceleration and strikes with his sword. Hasani raises his shield.**

**Kaaaaang!**

**[Your second attack has been completely nullified.]**

**Taesan's eyes widen.**

**It's clear that he attacked, but his attack was nullified.**

**He couldn't understand. His attack didn't even land, and it was as if the attack had bounced back.**

**[Attack nullification... he has a strange skill.]**

**But Hasani is also in a state of confusion.**

**Through a series of battles, he can roughly guess what the attack nullification skill does. It erases the attack itself and even turns back time. It's an unheard-of level of skill.**

**[You can understand why you've survived this far.]**

**Hasani raises his sword.**

**And Taesan recalls one fact.**

**"There was a reason why Lee Taeyon was able to defeat an S-rank with such low stats."**

**Taesan grumbles. Lee Taeyon's stats aren't that high. If he reaches the bottom, his stats will be almost comparable to an S-rank.**

**And then, he'll be able to defeat a full-fledged S-rank.**

**But that victory will be a precarious, razor-thin win.**

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"Despite having skills that surpassed Lee Tae-yeon's, it was like that.

The reason was simple.

Lee Tae-yeon had equipment that could overcome those skills.

Deep equipment. Each one had overwhelming performance that was out of the ordinary, crushing things.

The enemy in front of them was a being that had followed the Fire Spirit King and descended into the labyrinth. And the king was a being who had tread on the deep.

They didn't rely on their own strength, but tread on the deep.

In other words, it wasn't strange for them to have one or two pieces of deep equipment.

Whoa!

Hasan charged forward, and Taesan focused his mind and moved his body.

* * *

[Ugh!]

Qeya unleashed her power, and flames exploded, scattering everywhere.

Her strength seemed awkward, as if she was trying to push the enemy away rather than kill them.

"It seems you still have the heart of a spirit, despite abandoning your duties and leaving."

Minerva muttered, summoning the wind. The wind blades swept across Qeya's entire body.

[Whoosh!]"

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"The crest collects power and bursts out. The wind collides with the flames and disappears.

Minerva clicks her tongue.

"It's strong, but stubborn."

She is the Spirit King, but her power is limited by her contract with Taesan.

On the other hand, Kayya (Quेयa) has no such limits. Instead, he gains even more powerful strength as he descends into the labyrinth. Currently, Kayya is stronger than her.

However, Kayya is not overwhelming her, but rather struggling to defend himself.

"[Your Majesty...]."

The reason is simple.

She is the Spirit King, and Kayya is not.

Moreover, he is the king's sword and shield. Even if Minerva is not his king, he is tasked with protecting the king and cannot attack her.

After some thought, Kayya makes a decision.

He surrounds his body with flames and spreads them widely, pressuring Minerva and Barujaza.

"I apologize. I will only commit this sin until the battle on the other side is over."

Kying.

A flame barrier forms, enveloping Barujaza and Minerva.

When Minerva touches it with her fingertips, a rebound occurs."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The king is a powerful being who cannot be compared to the likes of you, but since he has made a contract with humans, he cannot exceed his power.

"Hmm."

Minerva tapped her finger and asked, "Do you believe that child can defeat my master?"

"I know that the king is strong. He wouldn't make a contract with a weakling. But even so, you cannot defeat us."

Qwaya said with confidence, "We have reached the depths and gained new powers. Those who have not reached the depths cannot defeat us."

Minerva gazed at the battle between Taesan and Hasan. The power emanating from Hasan's sword and shield was unusual, not just simple tools, but something complete in themselves.

Even the strongest, recognized by all, would not be able to wield that weapon properly. It was similar to the ring Taesan possessed. Minerva was also surprised.

"Well."

But Minerva laughed. She placed her hand on the flame's boundary. Qwaya looked at her with a gaze that didn't think the boundary would be broken at all.

Here is the translation of the text from Korean to English:

"The power of the spirit comes from the human who made the contract. And it's unlikely that a human can surpass it.

Looking at how far he's come, he must have some unique skills. But he's a shallow person. If you only look at his pure power, he's superior.

So, he can't break his own limits. Kuya believed that.

Tzzzz!

A crack spread through the barrier centered on Minerva's hand. Minerva smiled at Kuya, who was shocked.

"I don't think that way."

A strong wind exploded and covered Kuya. Kuya hastily gathered his strength.

* * *

Whoosh!

A shield covers the view.

Taesan dodged by stomping on the ground. Hasan roared and stomped his foot again.

[You can't achieve anything just by dodging!]

He charges forward.

A golden wave rises from the sword held high in the sky.

[Hasan has activated Golden Destruction.]

Kiiiiing!

A golden sphere forms around the sword, crushing everything in its way.

"You're like a wild boar."

Taesan mutters and takes a step back.

[You've activated Leap.]

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"The sword touches the ceiling of the maze and exceeds the range of the sphere. And then it strikes down.

[You have activated the landing.]

The ability sword's effect is activated, and a strong force is infused into the sword.

[Useless!]

Hasan raises his shield with a loud shout. As the sword is about to collide with the shield, Taesan quickly casts a spell.

[You have activated the Frost Arrow.] [You have activated Magic Acceleration.]

The materialized Frost Arrow rapidly flies towards the shield and collides with it.

And then it bounces back.

As if the attack itself has returned, the Frost Arrow flies towards Taesan. He dodges it by tilting his head and strikes down with his sword. A loud noise echoes.

[Uh!] [103 damage to Hasan.]

Taesan, who has created distance using the recoil, mutters to himself.

"Is he activating it in sync with the timing?"

He activates the shield's effect in sync with the opponent's attack. Then, the next attack will surely hit the opponent.

I'm not sure what kind of effect it is, but it seems to be something like that.

"I get it."

The sword and shield. These two are Hasan's cards."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The effect of the sword was a golden destruction. It summoned a destructive energy centered around the sword, with almost no delay. The time required for reuse was also not that long. And yet, its destructive power was at a level just below intermediate magic.

And a shield that reflected attacks.

With a defense that hardly took any damage.

'...Is the armor also a high-level equipment?'

The golden armor worn by the spirit. It didn't seem like ordinary equipment, but it hadn't been confirmed yet.

[You can't beat me.]

Hasan said confidently.

[This is a gift from the king himself, a deep-level weapon. You, who haven't reached that level yet, have no chance of winning. Just accept your death quietly.]

"What about that?"

Taesan snorted. A golden sword stood in his hand.

[You've activated Naberieus's golden sword.]

Hasan hesitated for a moment. The golden sword in Taesan's hand felt an extraordinary power that was hard to find even in the depths.

[But.]

That's all.

Hasan raised his shield. Taesan didn't back down.

[You've activated the Soul Blade.] [You've activated the Plus.] [You've activated the Strong Strike.] [You've activated the Continuous Attack.] [You've activated the Acceleration.]

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Instead, he charged even faster and stronger. Hasan ridiculed Taesan, who was trying to strike down the golden sword.

[You think you can break through with force? How foolish.]

It seemed that he believed that the shield had a limit to its power. But the shield had no limits. If the timing was right, it could even deflect the power of the Spirit King.

[You're going to self-destruct. How foolish.]

Kuung!

Hasan strikes down the shield. He activates the shield's effect, seeing the sword being wielded.

[You've made a fatal judgment.]

Kwajik.

The sword touches the shield.

At that moment, Hasan felt something was wrong, but it was too late. A powerful impact engulfed his entire body.

[Hasan takes 45,751 damage.]"
