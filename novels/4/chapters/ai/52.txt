53. Earth. Return (Part 1)

As it was his first return, remnants of civilization remained unlike before. Taesan looked up. Massive skyscrapers pierced proudly into the sky.

"Wait. Wait. What is this?"

The ghost muttered in astonished disbelief.

"...Where is this?"

"My world."

The world he lived in, and was driven away from. Earth.

It welcomed Taesan.

"How did I end up here? Why am I here?"

The ghost still appeared bewildered.

Taesan waited quietly.

After a few minutes, the ghost finally began to sort things out hesitantly.

"...So, when you said 'going out', was this what you meant?"

"Yeah. You're forced out in the form of a quest."

"Am I tied to you... is that even possible?"

"I was skeptical too."

The ghost is bound to Taesan due to the quest. They cannot leave until they defeat the boss on the 10th floor.

Then, what happens to the ghost's abode when Taesan descends to Earth?
In the labyrinth, items belong to the labyrinth. However, when descending to Earth, there was a way to bring all the items.

Ghosts are no different from items. They belong to the labyrinth, possessing themselves but not freedom.

Thus, legally, ownership by the player takes precedence.

I thought it was possible.

But things and lives are strictly different. I leaned towards it being impossible, but I was able to bring them down to Earth without any problems. The ghost also organized its thoughts.

"So, I'm forced to follow you because of a quest. This is fascinating. There's even a judgment like this..."

The ghost exclaimed as it looked at Taesan.

"So this is your world."

The ghost looked around as if amazed.

When the ghost saw the tall buildings, it swallowed.

"How were those made? Are they buildings of the sages? Do you have people in your world who worship the Demon King?"

"They're just buildings."

It was another unique statement to say that the buildings were of those who worship the Demon King.

"Buildings? What's that?"

"Tall structures."

The ghost had lived in a fantasy world. It thought such architecture wouldn't exist.

"Just think of them as ordinary buildings."
[Such ordinary buildings...]

A voice filled with wonder echoed.

Concrete.

Walls made with bricks without an inch of error.

Unique objects of various shapes.

Poles connected to the sky.

The ghost couldn't hide its admiration as it inspected each one.

"You said there's no magic in your world. To think such things were created solely by human strength... What's that one over there?"

Fluttering about, the ghost pointed at a car.

"If I call it a silent moving carriage, would you understand?"

"It's silent? But how does it move?"

"I don't know that either."

Most people don't understand how a car's engine works. Based on Taesan's words, the ghost realizes one thing.

"...They seem quite abundant."

Cars were lined along the roads.

"In my world, there were carriages enchanted to move magically, but they were rare and only nobles could use them. A car must be a common item even for commoners, right? Not knowing how it works means the technology here has advanced tremendously. It's a good world."

A voice filled with amazement echoed.
In a typical reaction from characters in a fantasy world encountering modern civilization, laughter ensued.

"That's how it was in the past."

Now it's meaningless. They lost their civilization to monsters.

Taesan looked up at the sky.

A hole pierced through the clouds was visible.

"Can you feel anything?"

"Huh?"

The ghost, finally composed, belatedly noticed the hole in the sky.

"...What's that?"

"It's what's trampling our world."

In 2020, as the new year began, the sky split open and monsters appeared. From there, the monsters emerged and trampled the earth.

"Hmm... It feels different. A completely different power is sensed. I think I need to get closer to see."

"Hmm."

There's no skill to ascend to the sky right now.

Not even a leap forward. Helicopters would still be around, but Taesan was just an ordinary student. He knew nothing of piloting.

"First, I should move and see."

There were rifts not only in the sky but also on the ground.

Taesan looked around. Countless studio apartments. A familiar landscape.

When the options appeared, he returned to the location he had left his home.
At that time, there were those who loudly clamored and those who screamed in terror.

But now, there was no sign of such activity around.

It was the same before.

Back then, I was bewildered at being left alone, but now I understand the reason.

When the sky shattered, choices appeared before them, but not every human chose them.

It was rare for anyone to press a sudden choice that appeared.

They stayed on Earth, hiding their bodies and hoping the government would rescue them.

"They're all dead."

The choices disappear over time.

He is now in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province.

Out of over five hundred thousand inhabitants, only a hundred thousand survived the first return.

"But what are we doing here? Just surviving?"

"No."

The one who sent the monsters, whether out of conscience or for a more enjoyable direction, provided at least minimal guidelines.

A system window appeared.

[Special Quest Started] [Proceed to Anyang City Hall.] [Condition: Arrive in a surviving state.] [Reward: Differential payment based on achievements upon returning to the Labyrinth.]


A quest appeared. Everyone in Anyang received the same quest window.

Taesan began to move. He shuffled along towards the road.

There was no sign of popularity.

Nor did he see any trace of monsters.

He stopped by a well-preserved convenience store at a leisurely pace.

There was a disgusting smell coming from things like bananas and sandwiches.

Since it had been about three months, everything that could rot had already rotted.

Among them, Taesan chose spam. As a canned food that was presumed to be long-lasting, it remained intact despite the foul odor.

He picked up a few items and stepped outside. He peeled open the spam and spread out his hands.

"You have activated Fireball."

Fwoosh.

Flames danced on his hands.

He placed the sliced spam on top.

Sizzle, sizzle.

With a delicious aroma, the spam cooked. He picked up a properly roasted piece and put it in his mouth.

He chuckled.

He hadn't particularly liked spam before. He thought it was cheap food drenched in salt.

But now, it was incredibly delicious.

Taesan sat down and polished off an entire can of spam right there. The ghost that had been silently waiting asked him,

"Are you ready to move now?"

"Yeah, let's get going for now."
After arriving at Anyang City Hall, something proper began. First, he needed to move.

Taesan took a step forward.

* * *

The distance to City Hall is not far.

It's within the city limits from the start.

Even at the walking speed of an ordinary human, it wouldn't take long to arrive, especially with his current stats. Even if it weren't Taesan, most would arrive quickly.

But the enemies wouldn't just stay still.

Squelch.

A monster appeared.

[Monster 4516233121 has appeared.]

It resembled a slime in shape. What set it apart was its black color and numerous short tentacles at the bottom.

A ten-digit monster.

An F-rank monster, weak and appearing early. Even an Easy Mode player could defeat hundreds without issue.

Grrr.

The monster crawled on the ground towards Taesan. It tried to grab his head with its short tentacles.

Taesan reached out his hand.

Thud.

Grrr. Grrrr.

The monster was caught. It struggled to break free, but the firmly held hand didn't budge an inch.

An unpleasant sensation was felt beyond his hand.
"What's this supposed to be?"

"Hmm..."

The ghost diligently scanned the monster.

"A servant of God? Feels a bit different though."

"They said your world was destroyed too."

"My side was annihilated by the Demon King. It was the end caused by beings belonging to another world, not something like this. Quite fascinating."

The ghost muttered in a peculiar tone.

"Invaders of worlds? Is there really such a thing?"

The ghost concluded with a murmur.

"One thing's for sure, the owner of these creatures is quite powerful. They seem even stronger than Rakiratas."

"Is that so."

Transcendents. Beings of considerable power indeed. That's the enemy's identity.

Bringing the ghost was the right move after all. Alone, it could uncover information unknown to others. The ghost seemed to realize this fact as it let out a chuckle.

"Was this the reason you brought me here?"

"You're not half bad yourself."

"Well, that's true. Knowing of a world like this is a gain in itself for me."

Taesan tightened his grip.

Crunch.

The monster burst apart.
Taesan brushed off the slime stuck to his arm with a nostalgic expression.

"I caught this after a lot of trouble."

It wasn't this easy in the previous world.

Even Easy Mode players could catch hundreds, but that was after clearing. At this point, just three months in, the Easy Mode player's stats were only around 11.

Back then, I fought with my life on the line. Since it was the beginning, I didn't have any special skills, and there were times I almost died.

Squish.

"Monster 4516242121 has appeared."

I throw a punch.

A shockwave blasts the monster.

Crunch.

Now such things burst out with a simple gesture. Each of these tasks felt like a huge difference.

Taesan looks up at the sky.

Only small monsters popped out of the open hole.

"Indeed, there are none."

B-grade monsters seen when the sky first opened. They're not on the ground. This time, only weak monsters appear, and as time passes, stronger ones come out.

"Do Transcendents like it when mortals put in effort?"

"Hmm? Isn't that mostly true?"

Slowly but surely, I sent out an opponent worthy of him
It's like a game.

Taesan walked.

* * *

F-grade monsters consistently blocked Taesan's path. It seemed like they were trying to prevent him from reaching the city hall with their persistent movements.

Of course, they were no match.

They were opponents adjusted to the average strength in the game. Taesan casually brushed them off, pushing them aside and moving forward.

Ghost asked with a puzzled tone,

"Where are we headed?"

"Close by."

With Taesan's current stats, it wouldn't take even five minutes, but he was strolling leisurely.

"Why are you walking so leisurely?"

"I'm meeting someone."

"I see."

The ghost seemed to understand.

"So, you're meeting those guys who teach you stuff. I've always wondered what kind of guys they are to teach you so much. Should I find them for you?"

Itaeyeon and Kang Junhyuk. Both reside in Anyang. They could have been found immediately if he wanted to, but Taesan shook his head.

"Not them. Anyway, since I'm going to meet them, there's no need to rush."

Both are strong individuals. They can dodge F-grade monsters and reach city hall.

"Is this about it?"
Taesan walked, recalling words from the past.

He sensed someone's presence.

Approaching him was a person. They were moving quickly. Compared to Taesan, they seemed sluggish, but by average standards, their speed was respectable.

"Hello?"

The man who appeared smiled broadly, showing a friendly demeanor towards Taesan.

Taesan nodded his head. The man was momentarily taken aback by Taesan's composed demeanor.

"Oh, you seem calmer than I expected. Haven't you encountered any monsters?"

"I have."

"Oh, I see."

Seemingly recognizing Taesan's strength, the man extended his hand with a bright expression.

"Since you seem unfamiliar with me, I assume you're not going for Hard Mode... Normal Mode then? I'm Kim Junggeun, known as the Key Player of Hard Mode."

Contrary to memory, Junggeun had a younger look and grinned.

"I'm counting on you from now on."
