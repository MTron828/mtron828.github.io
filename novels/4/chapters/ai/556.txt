**Episode 557**

557. 97th Floor. Möbius's Lizard (4)

[Yes, you!]

Leviathan flapped its wings. The power of the apocalypse was about to trample the mountain.

Kwagagaga!

The mountain dodged the attack and thought quickly.

It used the power of circulation to forcefully reset the cooldown time of the "Copy" skill. This meant that the system could also be intervened.

Then, could skills with cooldown times of several days, like "Copy", also be circulated?

[You have activated the "Fall of All Things".] [Whoa!]

All things fell, including the apocalypse. Leviathan's strength suddenly plummeted.

[You have activated circulation.]

And it forcefully reset the cooldown time of the "Fall of All Things".

[You have activated the "Fall of All Things".] [Wow!]

The strength that had fallen once before fell again. The difference was palpable to anyone.

"It's working."

Taesan smiled.

Even the power of the transcendent, even skills with cooldown times of several days, could be circulated without a problem.

[What's going on.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Leviathan was taken aback and activated his authority. It wasn't difficult to pull back the fallen gears. For Leviathan, who governed the end of all things, he could even forcibly end the fall.

But his astonishment was for a different reason.

Leviathan was a transcendent being who had helped create the labyrinth. As such, he knew well what the labyrinth's system was and how it operated.

As Leviathan, he knew better than anyone else.

That it was impossible to consecutively activate skills like "Fall" or "Copy" that affected all things.

[How could he continuously use such low-level skills...?]

Copy. The skill's effect was doubled. Even the transcendent being Leviathan thought it was a skill that exceeded the standards.

The existence of that skill itself was acceptable. If it was the labyrinth's system, it was possible to create skills of that level.

However, if it was a low-level skill, it necessarily had to have a long cooldown time.

But Taesan was using it consecutively as if there was no cooldown time. The same was true for "Fall". While it was possible to receive the transcendent being's authority, there had to be restrictions on its use.

It was as if the cooldown time was being circulated, but since it was only operating within Taesan, Leviathan couldn't grasp it either.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's fun."

Taesan was satisfied. He could force the cooldown to reset and activate it again. That was a huge advantage.

"Resetting the designated skill is different, but this is good in its own way."

Each had its pros and cons.

The advantage of resetting the designated skill was that he could repeat the same attack with the skill.

He could overlap the multiplication.

However, circulation was not possible in that way. Copying and overlapping was only possible due to the special nature of magic, but overlapping multiplication with circulation was not possible.

Of course, that was enough.

Circulation, unlike resetting the designated skill, had no cooldown on the skill itself.

Although there was a disadvantage that he couldn't circulate a skill immediately after using it, he could use it once on every skill, which made up for the disadvantage.

If he had circulation, he could use the reset equipment to activate multiplication four times in a row.

He was extremely satisfied.

[You, you…….]

"Thank you. I was able to confirm it thanks to you."

Taesan was sincerely grateful to Leviathan.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Leviathan felt an unbearable sense of humiliation.

[Die.]

A cold voice resounded.

At the same time, a storm and lightning struck.

Taesan, without changing his expression, took a step back.

Kwaaaang!

The power of destruction and the end of the world collided. The force that sought to engulf Taesan, who was at the end of all things, was rejected by the boundary that surrounded him.

[Don't laugh!]

At that sight, Leviathan vomited out his denial and wielded his power. The end of the universe was about to engulf Taesan.

Taesan didn't dodge or block it.

He simply gazed at the end that was about to engulf him with a calm, sunken gaze.

There were still a few things left to confirm. The power he had obtained was not just one cycle.

He stretched out his hand. Taesan grasped the end that was about to engulf him.

Kwaddduk.

"Let go."

[You have activated the Domain Inheritance.]

And the end began to be stolen away.

Kukukukuku!

In an instant, a massive backlash surged into Taesan's interior.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

You seem to resist, as if you're not my master. You're trying to destroy everything inside me, like a beast awakened from within.

"Devour."

And Taesan said calmly.

The beast that had been sleeping inside him woke up. It trampled on the apocalypse that was trying to break out from within and took control. If you don't obey, it will crush you with violence.

And soon...

Ku-gu-gu-gung......

The apocalypse took its place inside Taesan's treasure box.

Leviathan gazed at the sight, dumbfounded.

[...This is.]

"Is this it?"

Taesan, who had been looking at his hand for a moment, swung his arm. And from his hand, a powerful energy burst forth.

The power of the apocalypse, which showed the end of all things.

It enveloped Leviathan. Leviathan reflexively raised its front legs.

Kwaaaang!

[Ugh!]

With the impact, Leviathan felt pain.

[What is this.]

Leviathan couldn't move. It couldn't understand what had just happened. It just stared blankly at Taesan.

"It's okay."

And Taesan was satisfied with the power he had wielded.

"Come at me again."

* * *

Leviathan couldn't accept it.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But it was impossible to deny what had happened.

Leviathan had stolen his authority, treating it as its own.

And it handled it as if it were its own.

The moment Leviathan realized this fact, it went berserk.

[You...you...you...!]

A qualitatively different anger than before. The realm couldn't withstand it and collapsed. The end was forcibly revealed.

[That's mine! It's mine, I tell you! You, of all people, have no right to handle it!]

With overwhelming anger, Leviathan activated its authority.

The end of all things enveloped Taesan.

Even a transcendent being who could handle the concept of entirety couldn't respond with full power, and would be crushed by the overwhelming might.

Taesan didn't dodge or block it.

He simply reached out his hand.

[You have activated the Domain Inheritance.]

The moment the end of all things touched Taesan, it became his possession.

The power he had inherited through Domain Inheritance had to be wielded immediately. It was only temporary and would disappear if not used.

But that was no longer the case.

The inherited end of all things took its place in his treasure box. A permanent inheritance was achieved, not a temporary one.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And Leviathan was also aware of that fact.

The fact that his authority had been permanently lost.

[Ah, ah, ah! Ah, ah, ah, ah!]

The end is covering everything.

Taesan didn't back down.

He just took one step forward.

[You have activated the authority of the end.]

He is usurping the end. Permanently.

He is filling his treasure box with it, layer by layer.

Leviathan couldn't accept that fact.

He is the lizard that brings about the end of all things. He was born with that role from the beginning. It was impossible for anyone to intervene.

But Taesan was forcibly usurping that role.

From the beginning, his own role was being denied. Leviathan was driven mad and wildly activated his authority.

Taesan began to handle the authority he had obtained, regardless of what Leviathan did.

Kwaaaang!

The ends collide. In the process, the authority of the end stored in the treasure box decreased.

"It's consumed every time I use it."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's a permanent usurpation, but it doesn't come back. Once you use the usurped power, it's the end.

Thud.

[You have activated the Eternal Usurpation.]

The consumed power of the apocalypse has risen again.

The process was not smooth. I felt considerable resistance and backlash during the usurpation process.

'Can't use it as I please.'

Leviathan and Taesan have an absolute advantage. His attacks can't reach Taesan. So, I didn't care and usurped it freely.

If I had an opponent who could genuinely rival Taesan, I would have to use it carefully. If I used it carelessly, it might reveal a weakness.

Still, if I usurped it at the right moment, it was quite useful. Usurpation means taking away the opponent's power, after all.

Moreover, it's significant that it can deal a blow to the opponent's mind.

Power is something that one has devoted their entire life to achieving, or it's everything to that person.

To have someone else take it away and use it as their own, even permanently usurping it, is...

No matter how great someone is, no, because they're great, their mind wavers.

Kukukukuku!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He continued to plunder the end. As a result, the treasure mountain soon reached its limit. Even if he activated the divine plunder, he couldn't store any more treasures in the treasure box.

"It's impossible to plunder infinitely."

There was still a lot of spare space left in the treasure box. It seemed that there was a limit to the amount that could be stored for each individual power.

But even so, it was much more than he had thought. He was fully satisfied.

Taesan pulled out the end.

And mixed it with the boundary.

The boundary's end was realized in the world, and it struck Leviathan. Leviathan defended itself, but the boundary's end broke through its defense with sheer power.

Kuuuuuuung!

[Khreeeeeeee!]

"I can mix the boundary with what I've plundered without any problem. It's great."

Taesan laughed with satisfaction.

Then, finally.

Taesan focused his mind. He summoned the boundary beast.

And inside it, he contained the cycle.

A concept that didn't belong anywhere began to cycle.

Grrr.

The beast howled. It was like the whining of a child who was forced to eat food they didn't like.

Taesan controlled the cycle in response to the rejection reaction.

"It's still not enough."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But the possibility was sufficient. If I just tried a little harder, I could have achieved it.

"Then, I wish I could finish it now."

I've experimented with everything I could. There's no more business with Leviathan.

[Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!]

But Leviathan roars. A storm covers the mountain.

The mountain swings its boundary, crushing the storm.

"Hmm."

Words don't work.

Leviathan has lost its reason in anger. It's only moving to kill the mountain.

"How annoying."

I can't kill it. Leviathan appears to be like that, but it's a device that maintains the balance of the universe. If I kill it, problems will arise.

Then.

The mountain puts strength into its feet.

Its body accelerates, charging towards Leviathan. Leviathan swings its front legs wildly. The end is near for the mountain.

The mountain calls out to the beast. The beast of the boundary lets out a howl. The end is shattered and destroyed in an instant.

I clench my fist and pound Leviathan's head.

Whooooaaa!

[Kaahh!]

Leviathan's body wavers.

[Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Leviathan takes a stance. But Taesan grabs its head and slams it down. With a loud crash, Leviathan's body crashes to the ground.

[Ohhhhh!]

The end is coming.

It's crushing everything with its boundaries.

"You can't beat me."

It's simple. Leviathan is a universal device. It's powerful, but its power is limited to those who exist within the laws.

But Taesan is now beyond the laws. It's like a special privilege or something. No matter how hard Leviathan tries to enforce the laws, it can't win against Taesan, who doesn't belong to the laws in the first place.

It's an absolute mismatch.

"Would you like to acknowledge your defeat? You don't plan to admit it?"

[Die, die, die!]

"That's how it is."

Taesan stomps its foot. The shockwave spreads through Leviathan's body, and a pained scream echoes.

"Then, I'll keep pounding you until you acknowledge it."

[Wait…….]

The fist comes crashing down. The boundary brutally pounds Leviathan's body.

Leviathan refuses to surrender.

Until the end, it tries to resist and counterattack against Taesan.

And Taesan crushes all its resistance.

And so, a day passes.

[I, I lost…….]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Leviathan declared in a dying voice.

[Stop. Please stop…….]

The dragon responsible for the end of the universe succumbed to pure violence.

"It was bound to happen sooner or later."

Taesan clenched his fist.

[97th floor cleared.] [Leviathan rewards you.]"
