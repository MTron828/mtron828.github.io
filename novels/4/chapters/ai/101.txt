102. Behesetta, the Lamb of the Lord (12)

Tattered.

Anetsha walked through the village with her head hung low. Inside her heart mingled the anguish of rejection and understanding of Taesan's reasons. Her emotions were mixed into a complex state.

"You've come."

"Huh?"

Anetsha was startled.

All the demons had gathered there, waiting for her.

"What are you all doing here?"

"We have something to ask."

Artnekia swallowed saliva and asked.

"Have you all had your drinks?"

It was a very random question. At least, it wasn't something all the demons would gather to ask.

Anetsha shook the bottle of alcohol with a puzzled look on her face.

"Yes, we've had our share."

"Phew!"

"That's a relief."

The demons visibly relaxed. Anetsha was about to ask what they meant when...

Rumble...

A loud noise echoed from the other side. The forest collapsed, and shockwaves engulfed them.

"Huh?"

Anetsha's face stiffened.

Amidst the surging waves of power, a sacred aura could be felt.

"Hamon...?"
Tracker.

She looked at the demons, blocking her mouth. The moment she tried to shout to flee, she realized something was strange.

The demons were calmly looking at where the noise had echoed.

"You've finally come."

"W-what are you all doing! We need to run!"

"Run? Who are you talking to?"

"Who do you think."

Anetsha was about to say it was obviously Hamon, but she closed her mouth.

Looking into the eyes of the demons without hesitation, she realized.

"No way, you guys..."

"As expected, it's a god. Not even a day has passed since it was announced, and they're already sending their own angels."

"...Artnekia!"

Anetsha shouted. Artnekia smirked bitterly.

"Princess. We're tired."

The demons sided with Hamon. Realizing this, Anetsha gritted her teeth.

"Do you think Hamon will just watch us quietly? He's trying to kill us!"

"It's okay. We won't be demons anymore."

Hesitation.

Abandoning the demons.

Looking at Anetsha with wavering eyes, Artnekia raised her arm towards her.
"Don't you know? If we expose what's inside us, we won't be able to be called demons anymore. Do you know how many times it's happened so far?"

"You, all of you."

Anetsha knew about him too. Not just her, but most demons knew.

But even as they died, no one did such a thing.

There was one reason.

Abandoning oneself as a demon was equivalent to abandoning the mask. It was crushing and trampling their unwavering sanctuary with their own hands.

"Abandoning the mask?"

"You're abandoning it?"

Artnekia twisted his mouth. Unable to contain his anger, he raised his voice.

"We prayed to the god! We devoted everything to the god! But when we are facing destruction, did the Mask give us a single word of comfort? Did she advise us when we cried out so desperately? Did she come down herself to comfort us?"

Anetsha involuntarily recoiled at his words filled with intense emotion. Artnekia roughly spread his hands.

"Look at this village!"

Collapsed houses were seen. There is no fence and it is a village that collapses when animals appear.
"Our glorious kingdom has disappeared, and now we must live in a place where not even rain can stop! Half of our kin who filled the world are now reduced to less than fifty! Warm dishes steeped in history have turned into roots and insects, and each day begins not with prayers but with despair!"

Because of this, Artnekia abandoned the Mask.

The moment Havernek brought the princess, he immediately descended the mountain and went to the temple.

Kwoong...

The continuous ringing of the bell quieted down. Artnekia sighed emotionally.

"It's over. Mortals cannot overcome the Messenger of God."

Anetsha's face, pressed by Artnekia's vigor, turned pale.

The image of a great mountain passed through her mind.

"No, it can't be!"

As she tried to run towards where the bell was ringing, Artnekia stopped her.

"Princess. You must become a sacrifice for us. Please sacrifice yourself for our sake."

Artnekia spoke with a grim expression.

And it didn't feel good. He had abandoned the Mask he had believed in all his life and treated Anetsha like his own daughter, only to dedicate her to the god who had killed them. It felt like his heart was crumbling.

But there were still those who believed in him and followed him. For their sake, he could not give up.

"Now, Princess. With us..."

Kwoong!
Once again, a thunderous roar resounded. Anetsha, who had been in despair, jerked her head up.

From the place where the thunderous roar echoed, the sounds of battle began to ring out once more.

"I'm alive?"

"Lord Taesan?"

Artnekia was greatly shaken. The thunderous roar continued.

* * *

Kwoong!

The Golden Angel swung his Golden Sword. It was a reckless movement, akin to a brake-shattered train, with that much force.

Kagak!

A power far surpassing Taesan's. Taesan was pushed back, holding the tip of the sword.

[Your Battle Lust has been triggered.]

A skill that grants buffs to everything when facing difficult or impossible enemies.

[You have triggered Strong One Contempt.]

A skill that gives bonuses in all judgments when facing difficult or impossible enemies.

[You have triggered a fair duel.]

In addition, a skill that increases stats in a 1:1 situation.

With these three buff skills, the swords clashed once again.

Kaaang!

This time, he wasn't easily pushed back. But still, they were not equals. Clearly, the Angel's strength was superior.

"Let's check out his defense too."
Taesan dives into the Angel's embrace. He nullifies the rough attack forcefully, then thrusts his sword.

"[0 damage to Hamon's Angel.]"

Bwoong!

The Angel swings his sword forcefully. Taesan grits his teeth and steps back.

"Well, well."

No damage inflicted. Taesan casts a spell.

"[You have triggered Confusion.] [Judgment failed!]"

"Not even mental attacks work."

This time, he creates and launches ice arrows. Fragments of ice strike the Angel's golden armor.

"[0 damage to Hamon's Angel.]"

"Magic attacks don't work either?"

Taesan clicks his tongue as the Angel moves. With its wings, the sword draws lines as if exploding.

Earth explodes and covers Taesan's entire body. He activates a recoil and repels it, clashing swords.

The Angel spreads its wings. The light overflowing from its whole body intensifies even more. The grass around cannot withstand the strong light and withers.

"[Your second attack nullification has been triggered.] [Your third attack nullification has been triggered.] [5 damage to you.]"

Suddenly, attack nullification wears off. Then, minor damage starts coming through.

Taesan clicks his tongue and withdraws his body.
"Is it divine power?"

The plants exposed to the intense light emanating from the Angel were gradually withering and dying. A strong determination that tolerated nothing but itself was evident.

It had few drawbacks, such as attack nullification. It would be meaningless against minor attacks that couldn't be blocked. Until now, such flaws had been unseen due to the absence of such opponents.

The Angel fluttered its wings and flew into the sky. Then, accelerating, it descended towards the ground. Sensing a sensation akin to a giant meteor falling, Taesan quickly retreated.

Kuuung!

The Angel's sword pierced through the earth and exploded. A massive crater appeared as if a meteor had struck.

"It's like a complete tank."

Brushing off the dust, he thought to himself.

"What if I change weapons?"

Taesan had a weapon capable of fixed attacks that ignored all defenses. Switching to it would surely inflict damage.

However, Taesan did not change weapons.

The weapon for fixed attacks was in the form of a dagger. Its short length made it ineffective against long reaches. The Angel before him was not an opponent he could defeat with such a weapon.
Here is the translation of the text:

Moreover, the Angel's stamina wasn't going to be low. It's not an opponent as easy as the jagans in the labyrinth, so it's safe to say there's no chance of succeeding in thousands of attacks.

If you get caught up in time, Tae-san will die in the holy power.

Kuuung!

The Angel continues to push forward. A large crater forms on the leaf-stained mountain.

The golden sword passes through Tae-san's neck.

[342 damage to you.]

Even though it passed by, this damage. Tae-san clicks his tongue. The damage from the holy power had already surpassed a hundred.

An enemy that continues to receive damage continuously just by fighting, and even hundreds of damage comes from passing by.

That was the Angel.

'What about this?'

Pajik.

A blue aura rises from Tae-san's sword. Accelerating, it plunges into the Angel's embrace.

[59 damage to Haemon's Angel.]

'Bingo.'

Tae-san smiles broadly. It was confirmed with this. The aura had a defense penetration effect.

With this, the first condition was cleared. Tae-san skillfully evaded and nibbled away at the Angel's stamina little by little. Then the Angel's eyes glowed red.

And light falls from the sky.

"Kuk!"

Tae-san quickly backs away from the sudden attack, but his hand is buried in light.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You received 420 damage.]"

Not only did his flesh cook, but parts of it also burned and fell off. Tae-san swiftly took advantage and attacked.

"This damned guy."

The angel charges with red eyes. Light continues to rain down from the sky. Tae-san had to defend against both the angel's attacks and the attacks of light. Naturally, his hands became dizzy, and he could only be pushed back.

Certainly, Haemon's determination to kill him was evident.

Light strikes again. The angel swings his sword roughly in response.

Tae-san blocks the sword without dodging the light. Just as the light was about to trample Tae-san, he activates a skill.

[You have activated Forced Duel.]

The light shatters upon touching Tae-san, scattering into the forest.

The angel momentarily hesitates, the tip of his sword wavering.

Tae-san doesn't miss the opportunity and swings his sword. He launches more than twenty attacks in an instant.

The angel regains his senses belatedly and retaliates, but Tae-san had already created distance.

With this, it was certain.

Haemon doesn't know about the skills within the labyrinth.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Whether it's because of the weakened divine power or because they haven't entered the labyrinth, if things continue like this, a solution will emerge.

[You have activated Acceleration.]

Tae-san charged straight at the angel. The angel pulled back his arm roughly and stabbed with his sword. Tae-san tilted his head slightly.

[You have activated Evade.]

The sword grazed past Tae-san's cheek.

With sufficient proficiency in Evade, unless hit directly, damage is greatly reduced or completely nullified. Tae-san pressed forward and swung his sword.

Clang!

The damage numbers appear loudly.

The angel retaliates, swinging his sword and moving his feet. It's a challenging attack to find space to dodge.

[You have activated Counter.]

His body moves. Moving in a trajectory that didn't exist in his mind, he dodges the angel's attack.

He stabs with his sword, wavering, into the angel's side.

[112 damage to Haemon's angel.]

Light strikes again.

Tae-san disregards the Forced Duel."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"The angel swept the ground. Tae-san kicked off, flying through the air and thrusting his sword into the angel's neck. The angel swung its fist in response. Unable to move in mid-air, Tae-san seemed poised to take the hit.

[You have activated Aerial Leap.]

He kicked off into the sky. The fist swiped through empty air in vain.

Tae-san pierces the angel's head with his sword. Using powerful and consecutive attacks, along with other skills related to attack power, he deals significant damage.

Clang!

He blocks the swinging sword and counterattacks.

[You dealt 112 damage.]

Not all attacks can be avoided.

Despite striving for perfection, Tae-san succumbs to damage from divine power and suffers minor wounds from attacks breaking through his guard and counter.

'I can't use Fortitude.'

It's a very good skill that halves all damage, but it's disposable. Despite triggering it against continuous damage from divine power, it only mitigates minor damage.

Tae-san doesn't evade everything. Since he has the stamina to endure, he still has a spare life. Narrowly avoiding blows, he pierces through the angel.

And finally, he manages to bring down the angel.

"Phew."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"It was indeed strong. My health had dropped dangerously low. Even with the touch of exploitation that restores health with each damage dealt, it was this close.

If my health hadn't been higher, I could have taken it down before endurance kicked in. If it had been just a bit higher, I would have been forced to endure and fight as planned.

Tae-san breathes heavily and draws his sword. The beautiful form of the angel gradually fades away.

The golden energy within it is absorbed by Tae-san.

[Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [You have triumphed over the Divine Lion and gained the special passive skill [Half-Body Thesis].] [Your heroic spirit has been activated. Permanently increased Strength by 32, Agility by 22, Intelligence by 1.] [Your heroic spirit has been activated.] [You have acquired [Divine Power].]"
