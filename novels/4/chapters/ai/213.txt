Chapter 214

214. 51th floor, Alchemy (1)

"Wow."

With level up, all physical strength is fully restored. Mental fatigue is completely eliminated, and the body returns to its optimal state.

"Are they all dead?"

[Is there any chance of survival left?]

Tai Shan looked around. He didn't sense any presence of others. Whether it was the aftermath of battle, being chased by the wolves and dying, or being unable to withstand the heat, everything seemed to have disappeared.

"Ah, what a waste."

If they had fallen too, they would have gained a lot. But if they had also been concerned about us, they would have probably lost at a high probability, so it was excessive greed.

However, it was not as if they had gained nothing.

Thanks to the ones who fell before the wolves appeared, the level rose fairly well.

"Status window."
Here is the translation of the text:

[Kang Tae-san] [Level: 113] [Shield: 3469/3469] [Stamina: 36520/36520] [Mana: 3458/3458] [Magic: 582/582] [Strength: 6851] [Intelligence: 5984] [Agility: 6344] [Attack Power + 1457] [Defense Power + 1177] [Target is in top condition.]

My level has reached 113, and accordingly, my stats have also seen a significant increase.

“Then,…….”

I won't be far behind Taeyoon's stats soon.

To put it simply, my stamina is almost on par with hers. If I level up to around 130 without any major issues, I'll be able to reach her level.

Of course, she had to give up a lot to come here, but it's mainly because of the leveling effect.

The leveling effect allows you to take over the things possessed by enemies you kill at a certain level or above.

In reality, it's the same as continuously receiving leveling effects.

As you level up, the increase in stats becomes more pronounced, making it difficult to compare, but my stats are still significantly higher than those of adventurers at the same level.

Of course, even if my stats approach Taeyoon's level, it doesn't mean I can reach her strength.

Tae-san remembered the equipment she used last time.

A shield that reduces all damage taken by 50%, which Taeyoon had.

She had about ten of those things.
Here is the translation of the text:

In addition, there were skills that could be obtained by going down to the next level.

Tae-san also obtained a considerable number of skills, even more than that, but only those who went down to the depths could obtain certain skills.

Moreover, the difference in simple numerical values such as attack power and defense power was immense. It was comparable to a force beyond statistics.

However, still...

He had obtained a unique upgrade and skills obtained through trials.

The day when I would catch up to Taeyeon was not far off.

The ghost also couldn't help but be impressed.

[ Ah, I expected to win, but I really did win. I'm just a fragment, but I defeated the dragon that had destroyed the world, and I'm on par with the Demon King who had fled in fear... ]

"Is the Demon King that strong? Considering the difference between the labyrinth and the outside, it's not that strong, I think."

[ He is not strong. Because when facing entities like the Demon King or that dragon, not only humans but also entities that have reached a certain level also participate. ]

A dragon-like existence with an overwhelming power. Tae-san still didn't have the confidence to defeat the dragon he met in the Abyss.
Here is the translation of the text:

And when the time of destruction comes, God's blessing will be bestowed upon us, making us three times stronger than before. Yet, we still lost.

If it's a blessing directly bestowed by God, it's certainly not a small power. Even though demons and those who received the blessing all joined forces to fight, they still lost.

"The Demon King."

The name of that existence, which I had never paid much attention to, suddenly became bothersome.

"It's fine, I won't care. Since we're not going to meet anyway."

"But we can't rule out the possibility of gods intervening."

[Ah... .]

The ghost fell silent.

God's trial.

As a result, I didn't rule out the possibility of meeting. However, according to the ghost's words, it wasn't going to happen immediately. I stored it in the back of my mind.

Clack.

At that moment, the floor collapsed.

There, a being formed from bricks appeared. The administrator of the labyrinth. Balbamb.

Balbamb's eyes widened.

[Aren't you the one? I thought I wouldn't see you for a while.]

"I'm sorry."

[There's nothing to apologize for. It's just a matter among adventurers in the labyrinth. It's not a big deal.]

Balbamb spat.

[A village made for the common people has been ruined.]

Note: The translation may not be perfect, as the original text is written in Korean, and the nuances of the language may be lost in translation.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It seems that way."

51st floor.

This place was made for those who couldn't pass a certain point, and it was a city where people's hearts were broken.

[I don't think it's a good idea, but since the wizard decided it, I'll follow.]

A wave of power emanated from Barubabba. The destroyed buildings were rebuilt, and the broken roads recovered their original shape.

In just a few minutes, the village regained its original appearance.

The only thing that had changed was the fact that there was no one.

"There's no one."

[It doesn't matter. The history of the labyrinth is infinite.]

Barubabba spoke carelessly.

[Someday, adventurers will return to this place. Among them, those with broken hearts will settle here. And the village will be formed again.]

The number of adventurers who will descend to the 51st floor will be extremely small. At best, it will happen only once every few decades.

One person every few decades, and the village will be rebuilt again.

This was a phrase that could tell how long the labyrinth had existed.

[Still, we need to set up a temporary guide.]

Kururun.
Here is the translation of the text:

The ground collapsed and a pillar was born at the entrance of the village.

[But next time, I hope we can see it later.]

The words were accompanied by the sound of a loud crash.

Tae-san walked around the well-ordered village and sat down on the stool of a tavern.

And then he began to check the skills he had obtained one by one.

[Skill: Special Active Skill - Opponent of the Great Will] [Proficiency: 1%] [Existence that brings down destruction by opposing the will of beings that have transcended mortality. When facing an existence with a great will, your stats and skills will increase.]

"Ah?"

The skills he had obtained so far were similar to the bonus skills for fighting against a strong opponent, but there was something different.

It was the part where his skills increased.

"That's good."

The problem that always occurred in his battles so far was the lack of power. He couldn't properly defend against his opponent's attacks, or his attacks didn't land properly, so he had to find gaps and weaknesses and fight desperately.

In such a situation, increasing his power would be a huge advantage. It was much better than a normal attack power increasing skill.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Special Skill Activation: Calamity Ember] [Mana Consumption: 500] [Proficiency: 1%] [Summon the calamity ember that can burn everything in the world. However, it is impossible to control if the user's level is low or they do not meet the requirements.]

A skill obtained through ascension.

It seemed like a skill that would summon the flames that the wolf had once possessed.

Just by reading the explanation, it seemed dangerous to activate it. If not done correctly, it could set the entire mountain ablaze.

"I'll die anyway..."

[You have activated the Calamity Ember.]

Flames erupted.

The Calamity Ember appeared at the tip of the mountain's hand.

And then it burst forth like an explosion. It began to swell rapidly, engulfing the entire village in its flames.

The mountain hastily clenched its fist. The Calamity Ember dissipated and disappeared.

[Can't be controlled?]

"I'm tired."

The flames that burst forth momentarily. While it seemed possible to control the direction, adjusting its power was difficult.

[But its power is not a joke. Those deep down will choose to dodge rather than defend, won't they?]

I learned an unstable but powerful skill. That's probably what I should think.
Here is the translation:

As I focused on the world of ice and frost arrows, I thought it was time to learn the skills of the fire attribute's attack. I checked other skills as well. 

[Concept Skill: ???] [Proficiency: 45%] [The power of will is released, allowing one to sense the will of all living beings and adjust their own will accordingly. And one can receive a message from the world.]

By defeating the werewolf, my proficiency in the concept skill increased. I checked the changes carefully and found that the sentence at the end had been added.

"The sentence 'a message from the world' was added."

[I still don't understand what it means.]

It is clear that the concept skill is changing gradually. So far, I have learned that I can see the will of others and adjust my own will together with the concept. 

But what will happen at the end is unknown, even to the mountains.

[Special Always-On Skill: Fire Resistance] [Proficiency: 23%] [Resistance to fire. It seems that I won't be burned by a relatively low-level fire.]

Although it's the first skill I obtained, my proficiency has exceeded 20%. It was a straightforward way to reveal what kind of fire the werewolf possessed.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Special Skill: Wolf's Dominion" [Consumes 100 mana, requires 1% proficiency] [Summons the Wolf's Dominion, which consumes both mana and spiritual energy, and brings about the destruction of the world. Users with low levels cannot summon it.]

"This is a skill that consumes spiritual energy."

The cost of this skill was surprisingly high.

[You have activated the Wolf's Dominion.]

I felt a sudden rush of dizziness, similar to when I cast a spell and infused it with spiritual energy.

However, it wasn't too intense. I could still bear it.

As the spiritual energy flowed out, a half-transparent wolf was created.

[Whimpering.]

The wolf whimpered and leaned its head against the mountain god's palm. The mountain god stroked its head, and the wolf seemed to be happy, making happy sounds.

"Is this a pet?"

[It is.]

However, I couldn't keep it summoned for long. As soon as I summoned it, my level continued to drop.

I think I would need to cast a higher-level spell to use it properly. The power I felt from the wolf was not weak, so it seemed like a usable skill.

"I also obtained the Wolf Human..."

A skill obtained after defeating the guides. Wolf Human.

I could use the skill because I drank the wolf's blood.
Note: The text appears to be a scene from a game or novel, and the translation is based on the context and language used.
Here is the translation of the text:

After reading the explanation, I didn't see any significant benefits, so I thought I would check it slowly. The skill has ended. There wasn't a significant change point, except that the proficiency of the ability sword had increased to 39%. It was about to reach 40%, and the content would change then.

And what was left was the subtle, grayish aura on the palm of the mountain.

[The Will of Destruction] [The Will of the World's Destruction.]

This was the end. It didn't mention how to use it or what kind of power it possessed.

If I have it, I'll use it someday.

“Ah.”

Now everything is over. The matter on the 51st floor is.

It's time to go down to the 52nd floor, to an even deeper place.

The mountain moved its steps into the forest.

* * *

The forest was quiet. I didn't move any further and the fairies didn't bother me either. So, the mountain could find its way without any obstacles.

[By the way, what happened to that guy?]

“Gremelin?”

[Yes, I thought it was quite dangerous when I last saw it.]

The mountain stopped its step.

Itea said that she had gone down several more floors to find out that Gremelin had made a wrong choice.
Here is the translation of the text:

But Tai Shan was different from her; he handed over a large number of materials all at once, just enough to allow Gremory to achieve his goals.

"I'll check it out."

Originally, there was no need to move immediately. However, Itealyeon's and his quest clearing method were completely different. Gremory's choice could also be accelerated.

Tai Shan stomped his foot. He arrived at Gremory's house at a speed much faster than before.

There was no sign of anyone at the location.

Tai Shan opened the door with a loud bang.

The interior was in disarray, with things scattered everywhere.

It was already disorganized before, but there were still some rules. However, it was not the same now.

It was as if he didn't care what happened to him, and the place was in a complete mess.

"Phew."

Tai Shan's eyes widened, and he quickly retreated.

He took off quickly, spreading his wings.

He flew rapidly around the area to find Gremory's location.

Whoosh!

The air exploded, and trees were crushed. The underbrush was trampled, and branches were broken and scattered.

The ghost was puzzled.

[Why are you searching for this? Can't you just come back later?]

"That won't work."

Tai Shan knew what Gremory was looking for because he had heard it from Itealyeon.
And what the grim reaper chose at the end is also unknown.
