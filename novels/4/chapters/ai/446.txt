Chapter 447

447. The Ring with a Mixed Black and White Aura (2)

A strong presence can be felt from the ring. A self with a clear will appears.

This is a different self from Bardley, a separate ego within the equipment.

Taesan waited with a mix of anxiety and expectation.

Suddenly, a voice rang out.

[...Hello?]

It was the voice of a young woman. It was extremely soft and gentle, making Taesan's heart skip a beat.

[Are you my master?]

"Yes."

[I see.]

The ring murmured quietly.

[I'm confused, but... I understand the situation. I am your possession. I will follow you as my master and protect you. Please give me any orders, Master.]

Fortunately, there didn't seem to be any major issues with the ring's ego. It recognized him as its master and was perfectly obedient.

However, a question arose separately.

"Who are you?"

The ring's voice was clearly human-like. Each word was imbued with human emotions.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

No matter how I looked at it, the newly created self was not perfect. Even Kosrun, who possessed a perfect self, could not create it. It was not something that Halfren could have made.

[I...].

The ring, which seemed to be deep in thought, continued to speak.

[I was alive.]

"There is no memory of using life as a material."

[But I was a living, breathing human being. I remember that clearly.]

The voice was filled with deep conviction.

The ring stuttered as it spoke.

[I... believed in someone. I trusted them and devoted my life to them.]

"Who was that person?"

[That person... that person... uh...].

The ring let out a pained sigh, as if its head hurt.

[I... was a faithful servant of that person... a guardian who protected their side... a saint...]

"A saint?"

One of the materials used to create the ring came to mind in Taesan's head.

[The source of the saint] [The core containing the source of the god's saint. It was materialized by the fallen divine power.]

The forgotten goddess's saint.

Taesan had fought against the saint on the 30th floor and emerged victorious, obtaining the source of the saint as a reward. And he used that material to create the ring.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The self of the sword that he had defeated took its place in the ring. It was surprising that it was a woman, but when he thought about it, he had never seen the sword's face. Inside the armor, only a thick aura was visible.

Taesan looked at Half-ran. Half-ran also had a bewildered face.

"It's impossible for a simple material to take over the self of a piece of equipment. But... if it's a sword, then I don't know."

"Is it possible?"

"The source of a sword is the material that contains the source of the sword itself. I don't fully understand it either. It's not an ordinary material, so it's not impossible."

For now, it was impossible to explain without excluding that possibility. The ring slowly calmed down.

[Well... I don't remember. My head is all mixed up. But one thing is certain, you are my master.]

The ring spoke in a calm voice.

[I will follow your will. Please tell me anything.]

"Hmm."

Taesan looked at the ring.

The being he had killed had taken residence in the ring.

It was bewildering, but according to the ring's words, he was the ring's master. There was no reason to feel resistant.

"Then, what can you do?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I possess all the abilities that each ring had before they became one. Moreover, I am in sync with the master. I can become your shadow and amplify your actions."

"What exactly are you talking about?"

"I can increase the consumption value of skills that use the master's mana and magic, and maximize their efficiency and power."

Taesan immediately experimented with it. He used the frozen world of the dead world.

Then, the ring shone brightly.

It interfered with the magic being implemented, increasing its power.

Zzzt!

A chill ran down his spine.

Taesan's eyes sparkled.

Just as the ring said, its power increased noticeably. Although the mana consumption increased, it was not a problem compared to its power.

"Not bad."

"And I can store the power you possess, master, and use it when needed."

"Is that like Memorize?"

Taesan tried storing black magic in the ring. The ring accepted it without any burden.

Taesan then gave the ring a command. The stored black magic was implemented without any warning signs.

Kkkkkk!

"This is it."

The pure white ring, which was one before it became one, could also store power. There was nothing special about it.

Note: " Memorize" is likely a reference to a skill or ability that allows the storage and recall of magical powers or abilities.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Can the boundary line be stored as well?"

Taesan created a boundary line and put it in a ring.

The boundary line settled into the ring without any resistance.

The unified ring was able to store the boundary line as well.

Although it was impossible to store a large amount, the fact that it could be manifested immediately when needed was a huge advantage.

The specific method of utilization needed to be confirmed, but it was an effect that could have a significant impact on battles.

Moreover, the ring grew stronger as it defeated enemies. The longer it was used, the more its abilities increased.

"What kind of equipment is this?"

The ring asked quietly, as if it was a different level altogether.

[Are you satisfied?]

"Enough."

[I'm glad. It's a tool that helps its master. There's no greater happiness than that.]

The ring spoke warmly.

Its response evoked a strange feeling in Taesan, who had risked his life and fought with all his might.

Taesan asked the ring, "Do you have any thoughts about the being you believed in?"

This was an unexpected event, but it could be an opportunity.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The quest to restore the forgotten goddess's faith. I had to find someone who remembered the goddess, but I couldn't find anyone.

The ring was the goddess's apostle. If she remembered the goddess, it might be possible to progress with the quest.

[……I don't know.]

After a moment of silence, the ring spoke.

[All I can remember is that it's very precious. I don't remember anything beyond that. If something triggers it, it might come to me…….]

Taesan showed the ring the throwing spear he had obtained.

The arrow with a will was an item obtained from the forgotten goddess's realm. Although it was made into a throwing spear, its fundamental energy was the same.

[……It's a nostalgic energy.]

The ring murmured in a sentimental tone.

After staring at the throwing spear for a while, the ring suddenly said,

"Akasha."

"What?"

"Akasha. That was my name in my past life. I think that's what it was."

"Is that Akasha?"

"I don't know anything beyond that. I'm sorry."

"No, that's enough."

Remembering one's own name meant that it was also possible to recall memories of the goddess. If we defeated enemies and grew stronger, we might be able to remember someday."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Can I call you Akasha? Please take care of me."

[Alright. Master.] [Is the story over now?]

Bardley approached Akasha with a casual tone.

[You're not bad. You're a good match for me, a fellow sword. You're a ring now, miss.] [You're... a sword, aren't you? Ah, a swordmaster?] [No, I don't move according to this guy's orders. I'm free.] [A free sword? I don't understand. But you're a possession of the same master as me. I'll take good care of you from now on.] [Whatever. I'm not a possession.]

Bardley grumbled.

Akasha looked somehow stubborn.

It seemed more like her original personality than her being a ring.

The rough confirmation was over.

Taesan said to Halfren, "I'm satisfied enough."

"If you need anything else, feel free to come find me. With you, I think I can make even higher-level equipment."

Halfren saw Taesan off with a satisfied face.

Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

"What should I do now?"

There wasn't much time left until he returned to the earth.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was a time when he couldn't clear a single floor. Taesan, who had been pondering for a moment, took a step forward.

The place he headed to was the 78th floor, the library of the heavens.

The librarian, Jorge, was reading a book, just like the first time they met.

He opened his mouth without taking his eyes off the book.

"Ah, you've arrived just in time. Ainzhaar was looking for you. Go see him."

Taesan nodded his head.

Jorge, who had been ignoring him and continued to read, suddenly looked up.

His gaze was directed at Bardray.

Jorge's face scrunched up.

"The hero?"

[Hello, Jorge.]

"......Ego Sword? No, that's not it."

His bewildered eyes slowly sank.

"Reborn as a sword? With Coslune, it's not impossible. But death wouldn't allow it...... The power of the one holding you is irrelevant, anyway."

Jorge quickly grasped the entire answer.

The interest in his eyes disappeared.

"Congratulations, regardless. I hope you don't regret your choice."

[Don't worry about it.] [Hello?]

Akasha asked quietly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Who are you? I feel a familiar energy from you?"

"......You."

There was a hint of surprise in Jorge's voice.

"Who are you?"

"It's the Lord's possession."

"No, I don't see anything from you. You're...”

"The god of knowledge's librarian doesn't know either."

It was no wonder that everyone had forgotten, so Taesan explained roughly.

"......Did such a transcendent being exist? I don't know."

"If you knew, you wouldn't have said you forgot in the first place."

"There's value in finding out."

Taesan went to find Ainshar. When he arrived at the 24th secret room, Ainshar was at the entrance.

"Oh! Taesan!"

Ainshar, who had discovered Taesan, ran towards him with a bright smile.

"I'm here! My benefactor! Hahaha!"

"You seem quite pleased."

"I can't help it!"

Ainshar patted Taesan's shoulder.

"My goddess. Lady Levinehoff has regained her senses!"

Levinehoff, who had been purified, was still unconscious.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ainzachan said she would wake up the goddess and tell the rest of the story, and Taesan agreed.

And now, Levienov has come to his senses.

"How are we going to do this? Are we going to meet the goddess?"

"Yes."

Taesan nodded. Ainzachan smiled brightly and ran to the secret room.

"My goddess! A noble guest has arrived!"

The door creaked open.

And there was Levienov.

[You have encountered the awakened goddess. You have met Levienov.]

"Oh my."

A soft voice echoed.

Her face was extremely gentle. Just looking at her made one's heart feel at peace.

The blackness that had tainted her chest was completely gone.

The goddess had perfectly resolved the contamination. Taesan knelt down.

"Congratulations, Levienov."

"It's all thanks to you."

Levienov shook her head.

"And, you don't need to show me respect. I'm no longer a god."

Levienov raised her hand. It was extremely white, without a single blemish.

But there was no longer any sense of divinity there.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$The translation of the text to English is:

"Levinehoff has fallen into darkness. She is now a mortal being."

Note: "레비네노프" (Levinehoff) seems to be a proper noun, possibly a name, so I left it untranslated. If you'd like me to suggest an alternative translation or provide more context, please let me know!
