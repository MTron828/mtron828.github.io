Chapter 336

336. The World Destroyed by the Ghost (7)

The Demon King moved.

To destroy the world, he trampled the kingdom and killed everyone who stood in his way.

However, those who fell before the Demon King's power did not simply die. They risked their lives to buy time for people to gather their strength.

Thanks to that, the battle lines between humans and the Demon King were formed.

"Kill them!"

"For humanity!"

"For the world!"

The knights shout as they charge towards the monsters. A sword pierces the monster's head. As a giant monster swings its arm, the soldiers are knocked down like dominoes.

People and monsters are dying. Bardray is also at the front lines, defeating monsters.

"Be careful, you fool."

An old man speaks gruffly beside Bardray, swinging his sword. Dozens of monsters that were charging at them suddenly scatter.

Bardray looks at the old man and smiles faintly.

"You're here, Master."

"It's noisy. Because of my stupid disciple, I'm having a hard time in my old age."

The old man grumbled, but his expression wasn't bad.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan advanced to the front lines. The monsters that were attacking let out a loud cry and charged at Taesan. It was as if they knew that if they could just kill Taesan, everything would be over.

"Protect the hero!"

Countless soldiers rushed to defend Taesan.

But Taesan didn't need their protection.

Taesan's sword drew a flash of light.

The dozens of monsters that were charging at him were cut in half simultaneously.

"What?"

People were stunned. Taesan had gathered his mana.

[You have activated Starlight Arrow.] [You have activated Magic Concentration.]

A beam of light shot forward, piercing through all the monsters in its path and exploding in their midst.

"Aaaaah!"

The loud noise and light enveloped the world. When people finally opened their eyes, all the monsters in their field of vision had disappeared.

"Incredible!"

"What, what kind of magic is that?"

The mages were shocked by the power Taesan had unleashed. As mages themselves, they recognized that Taesan's power was indeed magic. And they knew that the power contained within it was something they could never hope to achieve, even if they gave their lives.

"......Is that a monster? Is that the power of a hero?"

"This is my power."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It seems so. I, who wanted to become a hero, am being belittled."

The bard, who was grumbling, looked beyond the battlefield.

The monsters were coming again.

"Our minions will handle them. You go deal with your enemy."

A massive power could be felt beyond the monsters.

Taesan focused his strength on his feet.

[You activated acceleration.] [You activated skill acceleration.]

His body leaped into the air, swept away by the strong wind, and several people fell to the ground.

The monsters tried to stop him, but before they could react, Taesan had already reached his destination.

There, a man with his entire body dyed black was holding a black sword.

Taesan drew his sword. The man also grasped his sword with both hands and swung it down.

Kaang!

The swords clashed.

Taesan put strength into his arm and pushed the opponent's sword away.

Then, the darkness that surrounded the opponent's entire body rose up, trying to engulf Taesan's entire body and drown him.

Taesan gathered his strength, swung his sword, and forcibly shook off the darkness.

"You're strong."

The opponent muttered quietly, twisting his sword.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

As the sound of the wind died down, they both took a step back.

The darkness scattered, revealing the figure of the opponent.

A man with a pale white skin, devoid of any blood, wearing black and holding a large sword appeared.

[The Bringer of Destruction, the Demon King has arrived.]

The Demon King gazed at the mountain with indifference. His gaze moved to the side of the mountain.

"Come out. You who have been hiding."

[…….]

The ghost that had been hiding revealed itself. The Demon King nodded his head after gazing at the ghost for a moment.

"You are the hero who failed in the previous world."

"You're quick-witted."

The Demon King was aware that this world was fake.

The ghost quietly opened its mouth.

[So, you are the Demon King.]

"That's right. I am the existence created for the destruction of this world."

[…….]

The ghost, who had been gazing at the Demon King, hid itself again.

"You're calm. You seem to be worried, but... there's no need to bother with someone who has already lost."

The Demon King raised his sword, pointing it at the mountain.

"You were summoned as a warrior to defeat me, weren't you?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The darkness spreads out to the world, and Taesan grasps the power within it.

"A monster, indeed."

The Demon King had transcended the realm of mortality, and Taesan had seen similar power somewhere before.

In the world of Halfra.

The will of the world within it.

Taesan had to risk his life to block a single attack from that being, and he could sense power equal to his own from the Demon King.

"First, I'll... express my gratitude."

The Demon King smiled, his gratitude evident.

"Thanks to you, I can destroy the world once again. Not with foolish people like before, but with those who would risk their lives to defeat me."

"I'd be grateful if you'd just die quietly."

"That's not possible. I am the Demon King, a device for the destruction of the world. I will act accordingly."

The Demon King takes a step forward. The darkness begins to focus on Taesan.

"So, brave warrior who dares to oppose me. Show me your power."

[The opponent is an enemy who cannot be defeated.]

* * *

In the midst of the surging darkness, Taesan gathers his strength.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the Apocalypse of Darkness and Chaos.] [You have activated the King's Vessel.] [You have activated the Avatar of Nature.] [A being that defies your great will has been activated.] [Your Giant Killer has been activated.] [You have activated the Strongest Disdain.] [Your righteous duel has been activated.] [Your battle frenzy has been activated.] [You have activated the Forced Fall.]

An unimaginable number of skills are being activated. Power and strength are simultaneously pouring into Taesan.

Taesan is gathering magic, charging towards the overwhelming darkness.

[You have activated Marbas's Dark Wave.]

The extravagant darkness is rushing towards the Dark Lord's darkness.

The two darknesses collide, trying to devour each other.

[You have activated the Forced Amplification.]

Using the Forced Amplification, Taesan is trying to push back the Dark Lord's darkness.

But it's not enough.

Taesan's black magic, which was spread out, is being trampled and erased by the Dark Lord's darkness.

It's not just a simple matter of power.

The Dark Lord is an existence that destroys the world, devouring and crushing everything in its path.

It's an existence on the same level as the will of the world of Halfra.

It's an existence that has transcended mortality.

There is an absolute difference in power and strength between Taesan and the Dark Lord.

And Taesan has the power to overcome that difference.

The will within Taesan's sword has been awakened. According to the prophecy, Taesan's strength and power, which will confront the Dark Lord, are rapidly increasing.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan swung his sword wildly.

The power contained in the sword exploded, and the darkness was torn apart and erased. Taesan stood firm, his feet rooted to the ground. The Demon King's great sword and Taesan's sword clashed, and the shockwave spread out in all directions.

"Hmm."

The Demon King let out a small groan. Now, Taesan's sword contained a power and intensity that even he couldn't easily push back.

Ka-ga-gak!

Taesan retreated, adjusting his stance after deflecting the sword.

"This is it."

The will contained in the sword surged violently, forcibly amplifying Taesan's power and intensity.

A power that Taesan had never felt before began to awaken within him.

This was the power of the weapon that would fulfill the prophecy and defeat the Demon King.

In this state, Taesan clenched his fist.

[You have activated the Frozen World.] [You have activated Magic Concentration.]

A chill ran forward, facing the Demon King, who gathered darkness and swung it like a wave.

The darkness wielded by the Demon King was the power of destruction, capable of devouring everything in the world and turning it to nothing.

The waves of ice and darkness collided.

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The fragments of power scatter in all directions.

It was a situation where neither side was backing down, almost equal in strength.

A smile spread across the demon king's lips.

"Good."

The demon king charges at Taesan, accompanied by darkness.

Whoosh!

The demon king pushes Taesan back and swings his arm. The darkness surges to engulf Taesan's entire body.

[You have activated Whirlwind Sprint.]

Taesan grips his twin swords and charges forward like a storm, cutting through the surging darkness and pressuring the demon king.

Clang!

The swords clash. The demon king spins his body and swings his great sword with great force. Taesan lowers his stance to dodge and continues to charge forward. The demon king waves his hand to explosively detonate the darkness.

Boom!

The darkness surges to engulf Taesan.

[You have activated Limited Blink.]

Taesan moves behind the demon king's back. He turns around to strike the demon king's back.

However, the demon king also responds. In an instant, he twists his body to evade the attack and swings his great sword down.

Clang!

The swords collide.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The demon king grants power to Taesan, pushing him back. The sword's blade twists, and a fierce battle ensues.

[You have activated a strong attack.]

Ka-gak!

In an instant, Taesan's sword is imbued with even greater power. The demon king slowly begins to push back.

And the will contained in the sword burns even more fiercely.

The determination to defeat destruction and save the world is about to engulf Taesan.

In an instant, Taesan's strength and power grow to the point where they overwhelm the demon king.

Ka-ang!

"Hmm."

The demon king, unable to withstand the power contained in the sword, lets out a groan and is blown back.

But Taesan's face contorts in a scowl.

The power and strength contained in the sword are still pressing down on Taesan.

It's as if this situation, where he's facing off against the demon king, is unbearable, and he's determined to forcibly raise his strength to a level where he can win.

If he receives this level of power, even the strongest person would be unable to withstand it and would be crushed.

Taesan realized that he could defeat the demon king, this powerful existence, somehow.

It was incredibly simple.

If he couldn't win, he would forcibly grant himself power and strength until he could win.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was no consideration for the hero. It was only a machine created to defeat the Demon King.

"It's not fun at all."

The Demon King also seemed to notice, and his face had lost its enthusiasm.

The Demon King wanted to be defeated by a human. He didn't want to lose to another device that only existed to surpass him.

But now, he was being forced to a level where he couldn't resist. The human was being coerced, and soon the Demon King's will would be trampled and he would become nothing more than a tool to defeat the Demon King.

"At least, it's my duty to kill you before that."

The Demon King gathered the power to destroy the world into his sword. It was the moment when he was about to unleash it.

"Stop."

[You have activated the Unjust Command.]

Taesan utters the command.

The sword's power and will, which were trying to devour him, begin to push back.

The sword's will, which was being trampled, begins to resist, as if it couldn't win against the Demon King if it was trampled.

"Shut up."

He says, filled with determination.

He didn't think of relying on the sword or entrusting his body to its power to win.

It was always his own will that took action.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$"Show me your strength."

He stomps on the sword with determination and willpower. The willpower that was gushing out from the sword lets out a scream as it subsides.

The willpower of the sword has become calm. It has transformed into a tool that moves according to Tae San's intentions.

[Tae San's skill level has increased by 1%.] [???'s skill level has increased by 1%.]

The devil, who had been watching the process intently, smirks.

"That's impressive."

It was a very satisfying sight for the devil to see a human trying to confront him with their own willpower.

"But what are you going to do now? It's good that you've won, but at the same time, it means that you've lost some of your strength."

Darkness roughly flows out from the devil.

He had forcibly stomped on the strength and force given by the sword. While it didn't disappear completely, it wasn't enough to defeat the devil.

"That's not all I have."

Tae San answered. All of his focus was on the sword. If he let his guard down for even a moment, the sword would try to swallow him again.

He didn't have the leeway to use any other power.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation:

"So, let's fight with swords only, you and I."

[You have initiated a forced duel.]

Note: The second sentence is likely a game or novel prompt, indicating that the speaker's action has triggered a forced duel.
