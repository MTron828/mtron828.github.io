Chapter 597

597. Extra Story, Mashin (9)

Ba'al released the darkness that had been suppressing Belial. Belial let out a creaking sound and hastily created some distance.

[What, why!] [I don't know. Why did I do that.]

Even Ba'al himself didn't know. His body had moved before he could think.

[……What are you doing right now.]

The agents were also flustered.

[Are you trying to protect them right now?] [No, it's not that.]

His body had moved before he could think.

[Then why did you suppress Belial?] [That's…….]

Ba'al couldn't answer either.

And then Ba'al realized.

He hadn't been trying to protect the demon tribe.

He had been trying to protect Lucifer.

'Absurd.'

Ba'al couldn't help but let out a hollow laugh. They would never forgive Lucifer. Lucifer was a being of the universe, and as long as they were gods, that was an unchanging truth.

In other words, protecting Lucifer meant going against them with all his heart.

Objectively speaking, there was no reason to hesitate.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They were beings born from the same essence as him.

They had been together since before the creation of the universe and would continue to be together forever as companions. They had shared countless stories and exchanged many emotions.

On the other hand, Lucifer was a mortal child he had met only a month ago.

He was a being with a different essence, a being of the universe.

Moreover, he was immutable, existing eternally. But beings of the universe would eventually perish.

His eternal companions.

And now, a small child he had met only a month ago.

Which side of the scale should tip?

It was all too clear.

[Ha.]

Baal laughed.

[I'm sorry.]

Baal apologized.

[It's my mistake.] [……Then.]

The agents seemed to relax, saying it was okay. Belial cautiously approached.

[Hey, Baal. Then, give me a chance…….]

Baal nodded his head. Belial, who took it as a sign of approval, beamed with joy. He tried to quickly pass by Baal.

And at that moment, the darkness moved again.

Quadruple click!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[What the...!] [What's going on!] [You're Baal, aren't you!]

The proxy and the demons are shocked. Baal's darkness was different from before. There was a strong will to trample everything of Belial and erase its existence.

[Comparing this to value? This is pathetic.]

Baal mutters. Belial's existence begins to crumble slowly.

[Hey!]

The proxies exert their power. A strong collision of powers occurs, and Belial is released.

[Ugh! Ugh!]

Belial, barely freed, lets out a sigh and retreats.

[Pitiful.]

Baal clicks his tongue. He mutters, seemingly regretful.

[I thought I could erase at least one of them.] [……Baal, what is this.]

Just now, Baal truly tried to erase Belial.

He tried to kill his unchanging companion, who had been with him since birth. His intention was clear.

[Are you choosing those insignificant things over us?] [You're too boring.]

Baal spoke lazily. His eyes showed a clear sense of boredom."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[It's not fun, and it's annoying. Just being with you makes me feel sick to my stomach. I think it's more fun without you.] [Are you abandoning us now and choosing that insignificant mortal instead? How foolish!] [No, it's the opposite.]

Baal raises his finger, pointing at the demons.

[You don't even have any value.]

Lucifer's value wasn't high in Baal's eyes.

It's just that the value of the gods and demons was too low.

[The emotions I feel towards you are boredom, annoyance, and discomfort. That's all. I've never felt joy or pleasure even once.]

The gods and demons are immortal.

They don't change. Not only their power but also their thoughts.

That was too terrifying for Baal.

[What's the point.]

The agent couldn't understand.

[We are unchanging. We are pure! We don't change like those insignificant things!] [You place value on that. I suppose that's the difference between you and me.]

Baal looks at the agent with an expressionless face.

[The only thing we have in common is that we were born that way. Just one thing.]

Everything else was different.

[I'm actually closer to this side.]"

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Let's get this straight. Baal is a heretic. That's what it is. Baal laughed with a 'kuk kuk' sound and unleashed his power. The darkness spread and covered the territory.

[Come at me once. You unchanging fools.]

* * *

[Baal, sir...]

The agents let out a sigh. Baal's determination was genuine. He was truly trying to protect the demon village.

Then, he too had to do his job.

The agents' eyes fell.

[Baal has betrayed us.]

He is a traitor to the gods.

[What will you do?]

The demons trembled at the cold words. Baal is the king of demons, their lord and master.

But the hesitation didn't last long.

[Well, damn it.] [Baal, sir. Why...]

They slowly approached the agent's side. Baal's expression didn't change, as if he wasn't surprised at all.

Only one demon quietly kept its distance.

[Bifrons.] [I apologize. Agent, sir. I... cannot oppose Baal.] [Hmph. Do as you please. You'll have to pay the price yourself.]

The agent spoke coldly.

Baal, and the agents of the demon gods and demons. A rift occurred."

Note: "고신" can be translated to "gods" or "deities", but in this context, it seems to refer to a specific pantheon of gods, so I left it as "gods". Also, "마족" can be translated to "demon tribe" or "demon race", but I chose to use "demon village" to convey the idea of a community or settlement of demons.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ba'al slowly spread his arms.

[Yes. Ogera.]

And Ba'al's power is unleashed.

A thick, dark energy envelops all things, and an evil aura that surpasses all evil spreads in all directions.

Demons are suffocated. The power that makes them look like insects is overwhelming.

Ba'al is the great demon king.

The king of all demons, born from the beginning of time.

His power rivals that of the gods.

[Do you think you can defeat me?] [I don't think I can defeat you. But... I can temporarily suppress you and achieve my goal.]

The agents raise their hands, praying quietly.

[My lord, please grant me some of your power.]

The two of them are the left and right arms of the gods.

They are part of the gods.

The gods' power descends upon the agents, and their power and authority increase exponentially in an instant, allowing them to rival Ba'al.

[Please forgive my impertinence.] [There's no need for that. Now, you and I are enemies.]

The agents manifest their power.

And darkness descends.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It is a collection of 'Ma' in and of itself. Not the 'Ma' that has been tampered with like the current one, but a concept that truly did not exist in the universe.

Its pure power surges towards Baal.

Baal manifests its power with a laugh.

Darkness and darkness collide. The concept of the Great Devil and Ma are similar. It will be decided which one is superior.

No matter how much power they receive from Ma, they are not Ma. Baal's power slowly pierces through the agents' power and advances.

[Ugh.]

The agents grit their teeth and throw their bodies.

Baal takes a step back. The demon realm collapses. The earth shatters into cube-like pieces in an instant, and each piece becomes a part of the power that pours towards the agents.

It is an evil meteor. If even one of them hits a planet, it has the power to pierce through it.

No matter how desperately the agents try to block and avoid it, they will eventually be pierced.

[Demons!] [What, damn it!] [What the hell is going on!]

The demons clench their teeth and throw their bodies. They use their bodies to block Baal's power, which is trying to collide with the agents.

Kwaaaah!

[Ughhh!] [Ggggah!]"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A painful, mournful cry erupts, but it does not disappear.

Thanks to them becoming shields, the proxies quickly attacked Baal.

[Annoying things.]

Baal clicks his tongue. The proxies are currently using demons as meatshields.

They are unchanging.

The concept of death does not exist.

Of course, Baal was a being born in the same place as them. He could have easily annihilated the demons.

But to do so, he would have had to put in a considerable amount of effort and passion.

While facing the proxies, he didn't have the leisure to annihilate the demons.

'But.'

There's no reason to hesitate. Baal calmly waves his hand.

The dark, corrupted space begins to engulf the demon realm. It's Baal's intermediate-level dark magic, the 'Darkness Devouring Space'. It's the same dark magic that Taesan used.

But the level of this magic is entirely different.

The concepts and laws of objects, and everything that existed before the universe, begin to distort and collapse. The space itself transforms into Baal's domain.

[This is bad!]

The proxies are shocked and scatter their bodies. In an instant, the entire domain is engulfed.

Kukuku..."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Baal's power is slowly dwindling. Baal is laughing.

[It's urgent.]

The power and tension felt in the village are growing even stronger. The curse on the entire demon tribe is starting to take effect one by one.

"Damn it."

The proxy is aware of this.

While they can withstand Baal, they can't penetrate its defenses. This means the battle is meaningless.

Kukukuku!

The confrontation continues, but nothing changes. The proxies can only barely hold on by using the demons as shields.

They need to find a way out. What should they do? The proxy, who is quickly thinking, realizes something strange.

If Baal makes up its mind and moves, it can destroy at least five demons.

But the demons don't disappear; they just tremble.

Baal isn't looking at them.

The proxy, who examines closely, realizes.

Baal hasn't moved an inch, leaving the village behind.

"What if..."

The proxy, with a glimmer of hope, gathers their hands and spreads them out.

And thousands of hands pour out from all directions.

But the target of the attack isn't Baal.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was a village behind Baal. If even one of his hands touched it, the entire village would be swept away.

Baal's expression changed. He clicked his tongue and twisted his hand.

Kiiiiing!

A dark veil covered the village, and his hand was blocked.

[Haha, haha, haha!]

The agent burst out laughing, his prediction having come true.

[Oh, Baal! You're really trying to protect those weaklings!]

In hindsight, it was only natural. Baal's hostility towards them was for the sake of protecting the village.

But the reason why this thought didn't occur to them was simple.

They were solitary, unchanging beings who didn't care about others. The concept of protecting someone didn't exist for them.

It was as if they were a symbol of the weak in the universe. Baal spoke bluntly.

[Then what have you seen so far?] [No! It's unbelievable! A great being like you is obsessed with those weaklings!]

The agent revealed his true intentions.

[Then, please perish along with that small village!]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Power is exploding. After that, the situation changed a lot. Initially, the agents were more focused on trampling the village than defeating Baal.

However, that alone imposed a significant constraint on Baal's power.

They were immutable. His power didn't get consumed, but there was a limit to how much power he could use at once.

Protecting someone was an unfamiliar method for Baal, and the power consumption was too great. He was currently using half of his power to protect the village.

The opponent was also an agent who had directly received a blow from the demon lord. They were not a weak enemy.

The balance was broken.

Kwaaaang!

Baal used even his own body to protect the village. Slowly but surely, Baal's essence was being tainted by the demon lord's blow.

[This is a new feeling. I can sense myself changing.]

Baal muttered cheerfully. The agent gathered his strength and made a proposal with a hint of sarcasm.

[Your Excellency Baal, please come back now. I'll explain it well to the demon lord.] [What reason is there for Your Excellency to use your power on those insignificant things?] [You're still saying that.]

Baal shook his arm, and the transformation flowed down to the ground."

[Our conversation has no meaning. It was the same in the past, and it's the same now.]

From the start, we couldn't understand each other. It was just a difference.

The proxy realized that Baal had no intention of yielding.

[If that's how it is.]

The power bursts forth.

The proxies slithered into the village like snakes, and Baal had to allow a considerable gap to block them. His essence was slowly being tainted.

But the proxies' expressions grew increasingly stern.

[They're getting anxious, it seems.]

The proxies' movements became more urgent. They knew that their device had reached its final stage. They no longer had time to be bound to Baal.

Baal laughed.

[If you're going to go there, trample me and erase me.]

[…Baal, sir!]

The proxies gnashed their teeth and charged forward.

He was being consumed.

"This is dangerous."

The word "destruction" slowly approached.

Baal glanced back.

The device was slowly being completed, and now it was covering the entire demon realm.

"Can I endure it?"

He was uncertain. Even if the device was completed, he might be destroyed before that.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But I thought it wasn't that bad either.

From the start, my life had no meaning.

I had never changed, nor had I caused any change.

I was a being that couldn't be said to be alive.

Then, becoming a tool to complete Lucifer wouldn't be bad either.

[Ohra.]

Baal spreads his arms.

[Let's see the end.]

The agents rush in, with all their might to eliminate him. Baal tries to stop them with his power at the moment.

He appears.

"Was it supposed to be like this?"

[What?] [Huh?]

A black-haired man appears between the agent and Baal, without any warning or disturbance.

He literally appeared out of nowhere.

In the midst of confusion, the ash-colored explosion occurred.
