**Chapter 337**

**337. The World of the Ghost's Destruction (8)**

The Demon King is designated as the target of a forced duel.

"Hmph."

The Demon King is a being that has surpassed the realm of mortality. He realized what Taesan had done.

An unknown power was surrounding him, and he couldn't grasp its true nature.

"Is this a seal or a restraint? You think you can stop me with this kind of power?"

The Demon King tried to shake off the power surrounding him by violently releasing darkness. A power that could destroy everything in the world exploded.

However, the power surrounding the Demon King didn't waver in the slightest.

The Demon King scowled.

"...What is this?"

It was a type of power that the Demon King himself couldn't shake off. Taesan was lending him power.

"Let's confirm it directly."

Taesan charged forward, holding swords in both hands to attack the Demon King.

The Demon King waved his hand, and darkness rose to engulf Taesan.

And Taesan didn't respond to the Demon King's attack, but was instead engulfed by the darkness.

"What are you doing?"

The Demon King's words trailed off. Taesan had pierced through the darkness and appeared before him.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan was in the same state as before he was engulfed in darkness. He swung his sword fiercely.

The Demon King grasped his great sword late.

Kaang!

The Demon King's body was pushed back due to his late response.

Forced duel.

Its effect was to prevent anyone from interfering with the battle, excluding the designated target.

However, due to the Ability Sword, one more effect was added to the forced duel.

If both parties were using swords, they could not use anything else except their swords.

Kagakag!

Taesan charged at the Demon King. The Demon King swung his darkness, but Taesan didn't even defend himself. Everything that touched Taesan became meaningless and disappeared.

The Demon King also realized late. That Taesan had used some kind of trick. That he could no longer attack Taesan with his darkness.

"This is ridiculous."

The Demon King quietly gasped in shock.

The darkness he had received was the power granted to him to destroy the world. He could wield it infinitely until he completed his mission of destruction.

But now, that darkness had become meaningless.

"Hmm."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Demon King blocked the attack of the Taesan and gathered the darkness. A monster appeared from the deep and dark abyss.

[Uuuuuu!]

It was one of the powers he received for destruction. The summoning of a monster that follows him.

A gigantic giant-like monster charged at Taesan. Taesan, just like when the Demon King wielded darkness, did not respond at all.

[Uu, uuuuu!]

The monster was unable to do anything and bounced back. Taesan charged forward and pressured the Demon King. The Demon King swung his great sword to block it, but the sword's trajectory was distorted and scratched the Demon King's arm.

The Demon King, who had created some distance, clenched his fist.

The darkness rose, and a massive energy blast shot out towards the other side. It fell on the battlefield where humans and monsters were fighting.

Kuuuuuuuuung!

The ground was destroyed, and a crater was formed. The power of destruction was akin to a natural disaster.

However, neither humans nor monsters died.

Despite being caught off guard by the sudden attack, people looked stunned but did not suffer a single injury.

"That's right."

The Demon King nodded.

"You and I. We can only interfere with each other. And our interference with each other can only be done through swords."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"'I caught on quickly.'

I expected him to be more flustered and show some openings, but he figured it out in just a few combinations.

However, the Demon King was sufficiently flustered.

'What kind of power is that?'

Taesan did something to him, and it turned out that it didn't work on anything except for his sword.

The problem was that he was the Demon King.

The only one who could defeat him was the hero who had fulfilled the prophecy. No matter how strong he was, he couldn't kill himself with just brute force.

That's because he was made that way.

It was a fixed law that if the prophecy was fulfilled, the Demon King could be defeated.

In other words, if the prophecy wasn't fulfilled, he couldn't defeat himself, the Demon King, and couldn't even seal him away.

But now, Taesan had imposed a restriction on himself that no one could intervene, and both of them had to fight with swords.

That meant one thing.

The power Taesan wielded was above the law of destruction that bound him."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And those who could interfere with the laws at that level were only beings who had transcended mortality.

"Is God giving that kind of power to a mortal?"

Taesan did not seem like someone's apostle. He had used apostle-hood, but it was far from the true power of an apostle. The Demon King, who did not know the existence of the labyrinth, was extremely confused.

However, the Demon King's eyes quickly fell.

Taesan's true nature was impossible to understand, but he had one task. The destruction of the world.

And Taesan was a hero standing before him.

Then, let's crush him and fulfill his duty.

The Demon King gathered darkness. All his power began to pour into his sword.

"Not bad. Let's fight once as a pure swordsman."

* * *

Kaang!

The sword bounced back. Taesan quickly regained his stance and thrust his sword. The Demon King swung his great sword to block it and used the recoil to target Taesan's neck.

Taesan took a step back to dodge and struck down with his sword.

The Demon King drew his sword to block it.

Kukukukung!

The swirling darkness engulfed the world. The Demon King's sword, imbued with his unyielding will, charged forward like a beast.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan also responds in kind.

While suppressing the will contained in the sword, he simultaneously pulls out his own limits.

[You have activated Forced Duel.]

The duration of the Forced Duel is extremely short. Although it had to be repeated frequently, it wasn't a problem since it didn't consume much mana.

Ka-aang!

The swords clash.

And the one being pushed back is Taesan.

The Demon King seizes the opportunity and strikes low, piercing Taesan's shoulder.

[Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.]

The Demon King's attack is erased.

However, the Demon King doesn't panic and quickly regains his composure. Since he had already grasped Taesan's power to some extent, he thought it was possible to handle it.

"I wonder how much I can erase."

The sword moves explosively, dominating all possible trajectories and pressuring Taesan.

The attack nullification is activated again.

Taesan tries to take advantage of the opening, but the Demon King calmly blocks Taesan's attack.

The Demon King is fighting with only one sword, but he hasn't weakened at all.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The more he fought against Taesan, the more he absorbed his movements, and his strength grew rapidly.

Ka-gak!

The final attack was nullified until the end.

"Hahaha!"

The Demon King burst into laughter. His swung sword shattered the earth and distorted the wind.

"This is fun!"

The one who possessed the qualifications of a hero was trying to bring himself down with his own power and will.

The Demon King was truly enjoying himself.

"Come on! Hero! Bring me down and fulfill your role!"

The Demon King charged forward. His sword attack, like a runaway chariot, contained a power that even Taesan couldn't easily counter.

Ka-ga-gak!

Taesan was pushed back.

The Demon King was purely stronger than Taesan.

It wasn't that he wasn't trying, but he was struggling to focus on the battle because he was suppressing the will within his sword, so he couldn't help but be pushed back.

Wounds began to appear one by one all over his body. It was clear at a glance that Taesan was being pushed back.

Ka-gak!

Taesan created some distance by deflecting the sword.

His expression was calm.

His entire body was covered in wounds, but none of them were critical. They were all just superficial cuts.

"It's about time."
Here is the translation of the text:

Until now, I haven't been able to fight properly because I was suppressing my anger and wildness.

But now, it seems that I've finally reached a certain level of control.

The Demon King said that I should defeat him to fulfill my role.

Tae-san decided to comply with the Demon King's expectations.

The forced duel's effect was to prohibit the use of all powers except for swordsmanship. Skills unrelated to the sword could not be used.

However, Tae-san's ability was to turn skills into swordsmanship.

[You have activated acceleration.]

Ka-ka-ka!

The sword's trajectory is rapidly changing. The Demon King is taken aback by the rapid speed, but quickly adjusts to the sword's path and tries to push it back.

[You have activated strong thrust.]

Kaa-ang!

But instead, the Demon King is pushed back.

As the Demon King tries to regain his balance, Tae-san takes a step forward.

[You have activated the winds of justice.]

The sword is thrust forward. It's like a storm.

The Demon King, unable to withstand the onslaught, makes a decision.

Kwajik.

Tae-san's sword grazes the Demon King's neck. The Demon King tries to block the space where Tae-san is swinging his sword.
Here is the translation of the text:

Since there was no space to swing the greatsword, Taesan aimed at the chest of the Great Demon with the hilt of the greatsword.

Taesan pulled the hilt of the greatsword with a precarious grip. The hilt and the greatsword collided and clashed.

He twisted his wrist and aimed at the Adam's apple of the Great Demon. The Great Demon was about to block the greatsword when it was activated.

[You have activated the counter.]

"Kuh!"

Taesan's greatsword ignored the Great Demon's defense and pierced into the Adam's apple.

The Great Demon grasped its neck and managed to create some distance. It wrapped the injured area with darkness.

The Great Demon revealed its injuries.

Although it was injured, it charged at Taesan with a joyful expression.

Taesan raised his greatsword to face it.

The blades clashed, and a system window began to appear and disappear one by one.

[The proficiency of Ability Sword has increased by 1%. The proficiency of Iriak's Unarmed Technique has increased by 1%. The proficiency of Gwanggeuk has increased by 1%.]

Ability Sword.

A sword technique based on the spirit sword, created using the maze system. However, it has not been used recently because there were few opponents who could move their bodies and fight with swords.
Here is the translation of the text:

Divine power, black, boundary, magic, dark magic, etc.

Since I've mastered various colorful powers, I couldn't focus too much on pure swordsmanship.

However, now I'm forced into a one-on-one battle and can't use anything but swordsmanship.

In such a situation, I can focus more on swordsmanship and pull it up to a higher level.

[You have activated the Great Quake.]

Kwak-kwak.

The Great Mountain has restrained it, but the quake and my will, contained in the sword, were supporting the Great Mountain. Since it's almost equal, if I activate the Great Quake, the Demon King will be forced to retreat.

Kaang! Kaang!

The sword continues to clash, and the Great Quake is consecutively activated.

The Demon King is not easily retreating. It's wielding darkness deep within the sword and swinging it around. The exploding darkness blocks the Demon King's field of vision.

[You have activated the Concealment.]

The presence of the Great Mountain is erased in an instant.

The Demon King momentarily lost track of the Great Mountain's location. The Great Mountain, embedded under the Demon King, raised its sword and swung it down.

[You have activated the Jump.]

Tap. The Great Mountain has taken a step forward and jumped into the air. It's coming down with the sword, striking the ground strongly.

[You have activated the Landing.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"I am the Demon King!"

The Demon King, despite being pressed down by a strong force, managed to resist and pushed away the Mountain God.

The Mountain God strengthened his sword.

[You have activated the Sword of Courage.]

The Sword of Courage's ability increases the force applied to the sword threefold.

With a loud crash, the Demon King was struck to the ground.

The Mountain God continued to wield his sword in that state.

Ka-ching!

The sword and the sword clash, and the Demon King's vital energy is compressed.

[You have activated the Endurance.]

The shock of the sword's impact is momentarily reduced. The Mountain God uses the remaining strength to bend the trajectory of the sword and pierce the Demon King's chest.

The Demon King holds onto the hilt of the sword that has pierced his chest. The Mountain God tightly grips it, making it impossible for the Demon King to pull it out, and then strikes the Demon King with the long sword.

[You have activated the Frenzy.]

"Ah..."

The Demon King's hand, which was holding onto the hilt, suddenly disappears.

The Mountain God quickly withdraws his sword and responds to the Demon King's attack. The Demon King lets out a mocking laugh.

"You have a very unique strength."

The Demon King seems to be enjoying the current battle, smiling.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

He charged forward again.

Woooaaaah!

The battle continued.

The Demon King did not fall. Although he was wounded and stuck by a sword, he wrapped his body in darkness and continued to collide with the Great Mountain.

The Great Mountain also suffered damage. The sword stuck in his arm and a long gash appeared on his thigh.

However, the Great Mountain gradually gained the upper hand. He used his Ability Sword to pressure the Demon King and, after applying pressure, struck the final blow.

Qiang.

The sword pierced the Demon King. The Great Mountain continued to charge forward with all his might. The Demon King collided with the cliff.

Kurururung……

[The proficiency of the Ability Sword increased by 1%.]

The cliff, unable to withstand the force, began to crumble.

The darkness that shrouded the Demon King was slowly disappearing.

"Congratulations, hero."

The Demon King smiled.

"You have succeeded in protecting the world."

Although he had not completed his mission, the Demon King's expression was not dark. Instead, it was a look of joy.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What I had hoped for was this. Victory is irrelevant. I wanted to engage in a battle with the Demon King and the Hero, each valuing each other's worth."

The Demon King had achieved his own wish.

"But... I'm a bit disappointed."

The Demon King gazed at the mountain for a moment, his eyes narrowing.

"The Hero who saved the world is ultimately an outsider, after all."

The mountain dwellers of the doomed world are not its inhabitants. It was nothing more than an outsider.

The Demon King's gaze turned to the ghost who had hidden his appearance.

"If you had fulfilled your prophecy, that would have been great... but this is enough, I suppose. Rejoice. Humans, your world has been saved."

As he spoke, the darkness within the Demon King's body began to disperse.

And some of it started to settle on the mountain.
