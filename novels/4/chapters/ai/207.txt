Chapter 208

208. The 51st floor, where mysterious beings live (5)

[Most of the ones bound here are twisted ones, but I'm particularly worse than that.]

The ghost told the great mountain to find the river.

[The ones bound here are all existence that came to seek something. But I still don't know what Grimgold's goal is.]

A warrior seeking revenge. A Lelis seeking magic. An Einzahr seeking God.

Everyone had a clear goal that could be seen with one glance. But the ghost didn't know why Grimgold had come to this place.

[Everyone has been rejected and has become isolated in their own world. And I don't want to get along with the people living in the same place as me. That's a self-destructive thing. Won't I be able to survive for long if I keep doing this?]

There was no constraint that said the existence in the labyrinth couldn't harm each other. Even Lelis was afraid of death when they met an orc through forced room movement.

In other words, the inhabitants of the 51st floor meant that they could kill Grimgold at any time.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What does Gremory want?"

"I think I know."

The ghost-like being was taken aback by Taesan's response.

"What do you mean? Are you insane?"

The ghost had also cleared the 51st floor and completed Gremory's quest, but it still didn't know what Gremory wanted.

Taesan muttered to himself.

"It seems I did well, as expected."

Lee Tae-yeon.

She had cleared the 51st floor and learned a lot about Gremory.

Because she had told Taesan various things about her past life, Taesan knew why Gremory had come to this place.

"Is Gremory's alchemy really exceptional?"

"Honestly, there's no one who can surpass it. As long as you have the will and sufficient materials, you can survive even in the depths. With such talent, Gremory has. It's a shame, indeed."

The ghost spat out its words, with a hint of disdain towards Gremory.

"Gremory is a low-ranking monster with no special intelligence. Not even a goblin. That guy is really unusual."

"That's the problem, isn't it."
Here is the translation of the text:

The story was cut off there. It was because a river that stretched endlessly was discovered.

"What's this?"

[You activated the thermal scope.]

You detonate flames into the river one after another. The temperature of the river starts to rise rapidly in an instant.

Kururur.

The water starts to ripple, and a massive creature reveals itself.

It was a snake with a radiant blue scale.

[A blue snake appeared from the deep river, and it's a human.]

The snake raised its fangs and glared at the mountain.

[This is a sacred area. It's not a place where humans can enter. Get out immediately.]

"That's not something for you to decide."

The mountain drew its sword. The snake's pupils narrowed.

[You're urging me to death!]

Kuuuung!

The river responds to the snake's anger, becoming turbulent and violent. It's as if it's about to overflow and engulf the mountain.

[Shaaa!]

The snake opens its mouth wide and bites the mountain. The mountain blocks it with its sword.

Ka-a-a-ang!

The mountain's body is pushed back with a loud noise. If it collides head-on, the snake has the strength to push it back.

[You activated the water cannon.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The snake's attack was dodged, and its foot was crushed.

[You have activated the frozen world.]

Zzz, zzz, zzz!

The lake, which was overflowing, froze. The snake trembled in an instant.

[What kind of power is this for humans?]

The Taesan mountain rushed towards the snake, as if it was pushing the earth.

The snake had beautiful, sky-blue scales.

Its power was incredibly strong, and its scales were also very hard, making it difficult to find a way to attack it. The only way to attack it was to target the small, weak spot on its forehead.

The snake knew this and moved its forehead to its maximum extent.

Of course, this wasn't a story that concerned Taesan.

[You have activated the energy burst.] [You have activated the multiplication.] [You have activated the acceleration.] [You have activated the continuous attack.]

With the power of the sword, the snake's flank was struck. The massive snake's body shook violently, accompanied by a loud noise.

[503 damage to the blue snake, which has taken up residence in a deep, strong current.] [Oh, what's this?]

The snake's defense was undoubtedly strong, but it was still at the level of 51 floors. It wouldn't be able to withstand Taesan's power, which far surpassed it.

Ku, ku, ku!
Here is the translation of the text:

The snake was writhing and destroying everything. The Taesan, who had evaded the snake's attack like a storm, thrust his sword into the snake's tail.

[Ah!]

The snake let out a piercing cry. The Taesan held his sword steady. The tail broke off, and blue blood spilled out.

[You, human!]

The snake thrashed about and fled to the river. The Taesan followed it into the river.

[Fool! This is my domain! The wretched lives of the earth cannot survive!]

The snake thought it had seized the opportunity and again bared its fangs, but the Taesan moved at the same speed as on land, as if unimpeded by the water.

Kwa-jik.

[Ka-yaak!]

Forced behavior. And without breathing. The two skills that existed in the water did not have any restrictions.

The snake tried desperately to survive, but was completely trampled. Not long after, the snake died like that.

[Ah...][Your level has risen.][Your transcendence has been activated.][You have obtained the blue scales of the snake that grasped the river.]

The second quest was also cleared.

The Taesan returned to the Gremelin with the scales. The Gremelin couldn't help but laugh.
Here is the translation of the text:

"That arrogant one! The snake that mocked me every time I went to get water is dead, isn't it!"

He gathered together his scales and fairy wings with great excitement.

"This means I can become one of them too! I'll become their comrade!"

[Are you sure?]

The ghost let out a strange noise. It was unlikely that the forest dwellers would like the goblin who had torn apart his own kin.

However, the goblin laughed.

"I'll become their comrade. Because they mocked me for being a goblin, and they laughed at my disgusting appearance. So, if I become one of them, they will accept me as well."

[You're crazy.]

The ghost shook his head as if he couldn't understand.

The mountain's gaze was fixed on the goblin, who was quietly watching him.

"Then they will accept you?"

The goblin's face, which had been laughing, stiffened.

"You won't get anything by doing that."

"...Shut up!"

The goblin let out a loud shout.

"You don't know anything! What I want! Why I'm here! Why I'm giving you a quest!"

[What?]
Here is the translation of the text:

The ghost appeared to be startled. The Gremory was furious, but he had never seen it before.

It seemed that the Gremory would reveal its emotions somewhere in the mountains.

The Gremory growled and waved its hands roughly.

"Don't interfere and just go to the next quest. The leaves of the dark green flowers that have taken root. Break them off and come."

"I won't."

The Mountain Lord retreated peacefully.

As he was leaving, the Gremory looked at him with a complex expression.

"What's going on with this guy? It's my first time seeing this reaction."

The Mountain Lord wandered through the forest to find the place the Gremory had mentioned.

There, a giant flower was emitting a poisonous gas and consuming everything around it.

"Lapleasia."

[You have activated the Anti-Poison ability.]

The Mountain Lord blocked his breath. Lapleasia was trying to grab him with its vines.

Cut.

He moved his sword to cut it all off and then activated the Anti-Poison ability one after another to hit Lapleasia.

The flower petals of Lapleasia began to wilt.

The poisonous gas emitted by Lapleasia became even more potent.

It started to affect not only his breath but also his skin. The effectiveness of his attacks disappeared quickly, and his energy began to decline slowly.
The translation of the text is:

"It wouldn't be good to pull on it for a long time."

[You have activated the will of an adventurer.]

The Taesan is twisted and flies towards you, and you turn your body to avoid it, and then deeply stab the core of the flower with your sword.

[You have activated the designation of the vital spot.]

[You have activated the lance.]

You freeze the world and grab the branches, and then roughly stab the designated vital spot with your sword.

[4589 damage to Raplasia.]

Raplasia's body starts to tremble.

The Taesan crushes the resistance and concludes.

[Your level has risen.] [Your ascension has been activated.] [You have obtained the leaves of the dark green flower.]

You complete the third quest quickly.

The Taesan realizes through a series of quests.

"'It's a kind of test.'"

First Quest: Capture the yoju that attacks from a distance where you cannot attack.

Second Quest: Obtain scales by defeating a snake that moves in the water, which is not familiar territory.

Third Quest: Defeat an enemy that deals continuous damage only by breathing.
Here is the translation of the text:

Although it's impossible to crush the enemy like a mountain, we need to obtain the enemy's weak points or leaves and succeed in our strategy. It's the result of accumulating the experiences we've gained so far. With these experiences, we can develop a strategy to counter various enemies in different environments.

"I understand why those guys are staying in the village."

Ita-yeon said he had stayed here for almost a year and had cleared the place.

As Taesan returned to the gremelin, he muttered to himself.

"The guides are here."

[Did you catch it?]

"It's impossible for them to survive here."

The demon said. The 50th floor guides are waiting at the 51st floor.

So, the first time Taesan saw the village, he thought the guides were not visible because they were waiting for him in the forest, which was the optimal environment for him to hunt.

However, after experiencing it himself, Taesan realized that this place was impossible to hide.

As a 50th floor adventurer, it's impossible to guarantee even their immediate survival in such a place. It means that they were hiding in the village, waiting for Taesan to pass by.

I don't know why they were hiding, but it's worth checking out if we go and investigate.

The gremelin did not burst into anger like before when Taesan returned. It just gave him a complicated look.
Here is the translation of the text:

"...I caught that disgusting plant seed. It's really fast. Good. It's over now. It's all over."

"Are you a unicorn now?"

"Yes. As long as I catch that awful monster seed, it'll be over."

Gremelin said, handing a small powder.

"Take this."

[I got the powder that entices and allures.]

"If you put this powder on your body and walk through the forest, you'll be able to find a unicorn."

"When will it come?"

"I don't know. That monster seed is too unpredictable. It'll probably come within a few days."

Tae-san sprinkled the powder on his body. A brilliant light began to envelop his entire body.

"It's too bright."

"That's what it likes, so there's nothing we can do about it."

Gremelin, who had delivered everything, quietly looked at him before opening his mouth.

"...You know why I came here, don't you?"

"Yes."

Tae-san nodded his head. Gremelin asked with a gloomy tone.

"So, tell me. What do I need to do? What kind of deed do I need to do to achieve what I want?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"This, I don't know either. But I can tell you this much. What you're doing now is something that won't get you anything. You yourself know it, don't you?"

Grem's eyes trembled at Taesan's response.

"..."

Grem silently entered the house and stopped.

Taesan looked at Grem's back for a moment before moving.

This was the last quest, but there was nothing to do. It was just a matter of wandering around until they found a unicorn, and then they could end it. With no clear goal, they had to go somewhere. So Taesan started looking for the place Iteyan told her about.

A ghost asked Taesan, looking at her carefully examine each tree.

"Are you looking for that place?"

"If you find it, you can gain a great advantage."

"Hmmm... Is that place really there? I passed the 51st floor, but I didn't know if it existed. So I thought there was no secret room here."

"I won't lie. I saw it with my own eyes and I have proof."

Iteyan said. The 51st floor. There was a very special secret room here. She got something good there.

And she showed them what she got.
Here is the translation:

If I have to find it, it'll take some time, I suppose.

"I'll check each one by one."

Tae-san recalled the information Taeyeon mentioned.

'Two trees. They overlap each other, and their color is grayish.'

Tae-san put strength in his legs and pushed through the forest.

['You have activated the mental acceleration.]

Scenes are passing by around him.

Although it's hard to confirm everything at this speed, Tae-san was grasping everything. He recognized the shape of each tree, the position of the underbrush, and each detail.

['The mental acceleration skill has increased by 1%.' ['The cooperative eyes skill has increased by 1%.]

He stopped moving again. He confirmed everything like a lingering impression.

After moving for about 5 minutes, he found a tree that met the conditions.

The two grayish trees overlapped and intertwined. Although the forest was originally colorful, Tae-san wouldn't have noticed anything unusual if he had just passed by. However, since Tae-san knew the trees looked like this, it was definitely unusual. He muttered to himself in amazement, like a ghost.

['Is this... how did I find this?']

"This kind of thing is something I'm good at."
Here is the translation of the text:

It was Taeyeon who discovered the abandoned goddess's relics.

There was a certain talent for finding what was hidden in a limited space.

Tae-san placed his hand on the tree.

Nothing could be felt. Tae-san, who knew how to enter her, put his hand into the tree with strength.

Mana was flowing out. Like a thirsty beast, the tree sucked in the mana, regained its original color, and recovered its original form.

How much mana had it sucked in? The twisted trees separated from each other, and a vacant space was created.

A transparent tunnel appeared there.

Tae-san placed his foot in it.

[You have found the mysterious area of the 51st floor, which contains the secrets of the unknown.] [First discovery bonus: +50 mana, +50 intelligence]

The secret room was very large.

The width was just barely visible from the corner of one's eye. It was significantly different in size from the secret room.

Note: The text appears to be a passage from a game or a story, and the translation is aimed to convey the meaning and content of the passage.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Sub-quest start] [This place was created by the dragon that has gathered mysteries while passing through the mysterious forest. The dragon intends to give you a gift of mystery as you visit this place that you have discovered.]

[Conditions: Use the wings of the fairy to cross the abyss.]

[Reward: Wings of the fairy]

[What is this mysterious dragon?]

[I was startled by the ghost's voice.]

"Who are you?"

[I didn't understand, but I heard it. I know that it's a being that lives in the depths, and I think that this kind of person made this place.]

"Maybe it's just for fun."

Whether it's just for fun or for some other purpose, you can receive a reward. The mountain god accepted the quest and received a skill at the same time.

[You have obtained the temporary skill [Wings of the Fairy]. You have activated the [Wings of the Fairy] skill.]

Behind the mountain god, a vast, multicolored wing unfolds. The mountain god grumbles unhappily at the bright colors.

"It's too bright."

[Should I complain now? I'm giving you the wings of the fairy, aren't I?]

The ghost let out a forced laugh.

"Ah, I should have discovered this too."

The ghost let out a sigh. This secret room had a value that was worth it.

There was no skill that allowed you to fly freely in the air.
Here is the translation of the text:

To obtain the skill, one had to meet the conditions, but even Tai Shan, who had put in a lot of effort, was unable to obtain it at the end. Therefore, when engaging in aerial combat, one had to use jumping, aerial jumping, landing, and random blinking attacks, and so on.

It was not impossible to respond, but it was very inconvenient and restrictive. Even when facing the Fairy Queen, if the Queen simply gave up on the battle and flew away, there was no way to chase after her.

Among the monsters, there were many that could fly, so players had no choice but to be helpless against them.

However, Iteyan was different.

With the wings of a fairy, she immediately moved to deal with the flying monsters that appeared. Even the ground-dwelling monsters were dealt with by Tai Shan, while the flying monsters were dealt with by Iteyan, as if they were her specialty.

All of this was thanks to the fairy wings obtained at the 51st floor.

"This can be obtained and taken."

It seemed that even the ghost had no special remarks, and it was unlikely that one could learn the skill to float in the air even by going deep down.

[But it didn't seem like it was free.]

The secret room was very spacious, and there was a place that seemed to be the destination beyond it.

However, the path to get there was non-existent.

The endless wasteland unfolded before us.
The first quest. Use the fairy's wings to cross over the precipice and arrive at the next location.
