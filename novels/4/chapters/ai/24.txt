25. 2nd Floor, Buried One. Ghost of the Hero (10)

[Taesan Kang [Alone]: I'm too lazy to explain each one by one, so I'll pass on that. Just listen for now.

Taesan started explaining.

[Taesan Kang [Alone]: Only tell us the skills you can obtain through effort. Taeyeon Lee and Junhyuk Kang will understand what I mean.] [Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: Got it.]

Insight, achievable by understanding the essence of things.

Calmness, obtainable by maintaining an unwavering mind.

Sharp senses, maintained through sensory enhancement.

All require innate talent to attain.

In essence, talent was expressed as skills.

These are skills that one obtains naturally, not through teaching.

Taesan intended to reveal skills that even a mediocre person could obtain through effort.

[Taesan Kang [Alone]: Let's skip over disease resistance skills assuming everyone already has them.]

Emergency rations are too expensive for players on the 1st floor to afford. Until they buy a torch, they can only eat raw meat.
During that process, they contracted food poisoning and recovered at the fountain of life.

Naturally, they were able to acquire disease resistance.

In fact, most of the skills mentioned by the Alone players were related to disease resistance.

[Taesan Kang [Alone]: Then, the easiest skill to acquire. Pain reduction.] [Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: Oh, sounds good.]

Expectations spread throughout the community. They were all modern people who were sensitive to pain. A skill that reduces pain—it had an incredibly captivating resonance.

[Taesan Kang [Alone]: Now that everyone has acquired a skill or two, you understand the conditions for obtaining them, right?] [Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: Reproduce the effects of the skill to some extent. I know that. ...Huh?]

Junhyuk realizes something while speaking. Taesan calmly continues.

[Taesan Kang [Alone]: Yes, as you said, the way to obtain it is simple. Just endure the pain.] [Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: Easier than I thought. So, I just let Big Rat bite me?] [Taesan Kang [Alone]: You think that'll do?]

Big Rat's attacks were close to being sharp. In the labyrinth's judgment, it wasn't classified as pain.
[Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: So how do we obtain it?] [Taesan Kang [Alone]: Stab your arm with a knife.] [Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: ...What?] [Taesan Kang [Alone]: Everyone has a rusty sword, right? Stab deep into your arm. It needs to reach the bone for the judgment to be correct, so don't hesitate or stab clumsily.]

The monster on the 1st floor was just Big Rat. If the secret room is revealed, only those who will die will come out, so there was no other way.

[Taesan Kang [Alone]: Why so silent?]

The community, which had been bustling until just now, fell silent.

[Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: ...Stab with a knife?] [Taesan Kang [Alone]: Yes. Make sure it reaches the bone. What's the problem when the Fountain of Life is right there?]

They could recover no matter how much pain they endured. Taesan thought there was no problem.

[Taesan Kang [Alone]: If you fight Big Rat in that state, it's a determination not to break, and you can also obtain skills to ignore injuries and fight.]

Silence fell again. It was a while later that Junhyuk Kang managed to ask.

[Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: How long do we have to endure?] [Taesan Kang [Alone]: About 1 minute?] [Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: ...Wow.]

It was an exclamation filled with numerous meanings. Expecting this reaction, Taesan continued to post.
[강태산[얼론] : I'll keep talking. The next skill is called the Breathless skill. Enter the Font of Life and hold your breath. Did you know you can get it if you wait until the moment just before dying? After obtaining it, swing your sword to the limit while using the skill to acquire Breathless Attack. It's a highly useful skill that grants freedom from breathing, so it's worth learning.]

[이태연[얼론] : Until just before dying?]
[강태산[얼론] : How did you learn about the brink of death?]
[이태연[얼론] : We were fighting in the corridor when suddenly two Big Rats popped out. As soon as I saw them, I ran away. I arrived at the Font of Life with only 2 HP left and obtained it.]
[강태산[얼론] : I see. You obtained Breathless and the brink of death at the same time?]
[이태연[얼론] : Ah......]

As literally as it sounds, Itaeyeon realizes the crisis of life and stays silent.

[문재성[얼론] : ...Is there nothing else?]
[강태산[얼론] : There's a skill called Endurance that nullifies damage leading to death and grants damage immunity for a few seconds.]

Just listening to it, it's a skill with considerable performance. However, the community remained silent. It seemed as though Itaeyeon had given up, and she asked.

[이태연[얼론] : How do you get that one?]
[강태산[얼론] : Leave yourself with 1 HP and block about thirty attacks from the Big Rats. Then you can obtain it. As a bonus, you'll also get a skill called Block. It's a gamble worth taking.]
[강준혁[얼론] : Huh.]
[문재성[얼론] : ...Are you not lying?]
[박찬웅[얼론] : Even if it's difficult, do you really have to go that far just to obtain a skill?]

The initial trust, belief, and joy disappeared without a trace, replaced only by distrust. Taesan checked the rising posts with a heavy heart.
[Kang Taesan [Alone]: I'm not going to force you to learn. There's no reason to. The choice is yours.]
[Moon Jaesung [Alone]: I can't do it. How can anyone do such crazy things?]
[Kim Yohan [Alone]: Me neither. No matter how much I need the skill, it doesn't seem worth it.]

Most of the reactions were of refusal. They couldn't accept the fact that they had to go to such lengths to obtain a skill. It was exactly the response Taesan had anticipated.

They were people who had lived in modern times.

War was a story of history, and starvation was something from distant lands.

They had never risked their lives to do something, not even once in their lives.

Even if suddenly thrown into a labyrinth, their core wouldn't change.

There was no one who would endure suffering to gain something. Even if they knew it would save their lives.

What they realized was that one usually experienced hardship afterwards. The problem was that most people died then.

Those who knew before experiencing hardship were a tiny minority.

[Itaeyeon [Alone]: ...Is there no other way?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: There isn't.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Wow. That's harsh.]

They complained, but their words contained resolve.
[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Sigh. Well, I guess I'll give it a try anyway.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: In life, you end up doing some really crazy things.] [Moon Jaesung [Alone]: Wow. Junhyuk, are you really going to do that crazy thing?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Then what else can I do? It would surely help once I learn it.] [Moon Jaesung [Alone]: But couldn't that be a lie?] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Mr. Taesan? For what reason?] 

Moon Jaesung was silenced by Lee Taeyeon's words. Taesan had proven himself through a strategy.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Why would someone who's doing well alone lie? Let's just start with a safe skill. Apnea isn't that risky, right?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: As soon as you see the system window, you can leave. You just have to endure some hardship, right? Instincts aren't easy to suppress.]

Except for him, Middle Kun, who learned the apnea alone, he had succeeded dozens of times after challenging.

Fear that you'll die if you life entails experience Are Even if had been remain do not th ought it We of who Until it
[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Work hard. Let me know when you can handle the rest of the skills.]

Taesan closed the community. The remaining ones may make a fuss about whatever, but it's unrelated to him.

["Is it over? What are you doing?"]

"Just a simple advice."

Although he didn't know what the community was, he roughly figured it out through their actions. The ghost grumbled.

"You're wasting your time. Those who are going to die will die, and those who will live will live."

"Still, some ambiguous people might survive."

That's why he was explaining various things. The next time the community opens, something will have changed. The ghost urged Taesan.

"Is it all over? Let's go quickly!"

Taesan got up, opened the door in front of him, and peered inside.

"Squeak."

"Thud."

Inside were four goblins. And beyond them, as Taesan expected, there was a red door.

These are probably the last monsters on the second floor.

Taesan calmly opened the door. He drew his bow against the startled goblins.

"Thunk!"

"Thock!"

"Thock!"

He shot paralysis arrows at the three of them. The ghost asked in a puzzled tone.

"Why waste arrows like that?"
"Stay still and watch."

Taesan drew his sword.

*Squelch, squick.*

The only goblin not paralyzed nervously raised its shield. Taesan swung his sword towards the goblin.

*Slash!*

[Dealt 10 damage to the goblin with the shield.]

*Squeeeeak!*

The goblin screamed and cowered. With a bit more force, Taesan could have split it into two with his sword.

However, Taesan hesitated with his sword. The goblin sensed death approaching and blinked in confusion.

*Keck?*

Taesan took off various attack power equipment. After reducing his attack power to 1, he swung his sword roughly. The goblin hurriedly blocked.

*Kaak!*

*Karruk!*

As the paralysis wore off, the goblins stood up. Taesan quickly drew his bow again.

*Kiyeok!*

*Kkak!*

Three goblins froze again. Taesan continued to strike the lone remaining goblin foolishly standing.

["What are you doing?"]

"Don't you know?"

[I see. You're not doing this to gain skills, right?]

"You know it well?"

Taesan fired a paralysis arrow. He had been hitting just one goblin for nearly two minutes.
The ghost pounded its chest as if frustrated.

"It's so scary how you clumsily understand things. Skill acquisition does indeed happen this way. But can you really gain skills like this?"

"You can."

"I have a very good skill. Taesan placed another paralysis arrow. The ghost chuckled.

"Do you know how many floors I've descended here? 85 floors. 85 floors! There's nothing I don't know!"

"Then shall we make a bet?"

"A bet? What could I possibly gain as a dead man?"

"If you win, I'll be your puppet. I'll obey everything you say, even if it means I must die."

"Oh?"

"But if I win, whenever I ask you a question, you must answer truthfully. That's the bet."

"Hah. You're quite the ambitious one."

The ghost chuckled happily.

"So now this newcomer in the maze wants to fight me for information, huh?"

"And you dislike that?"

The ghost nodded vigorously at Taesan's calm response.
"Of course! The noble of the great Carvert Empire! I stake the name of Alkerite! If you win, I will answer your questions without a hint of falsehood! But if I win, you are mine!"

"Alright."

Even in the midst of their conversation, Taesan continued to harass the goblins with his sword. The goblins, seeming half-hearted, lazily moved their shields.

"Can you see the system window?"

"If you want me to show you, I can."

"Good, then."

Taesan once again aimed a paralysis arrow. The frozen goblins began to show signs of annoyance in their eyes. The ghost chuckled happily.

"What are you going to do? Will you happily wander around until this one dies?"

Ignoring the ghost, Taesan moved his hand. Another four minutes passed.

"Are you starting to give up?"

Instead of answering, Taesan opened his mouth.

"Isn't it a duel skill?"

"It's a basic skill, why wouldn't I know?"

It was a skill used when players faced off against each other, where interference from others was barred upon mutual agreement. It was more commonly used outside of dungeons.

"You can gain something similar here."

The difficulty of obtaining it was quite low. However, due to its uniqueness, until Taesan acquired it, it was a skill known to no one else.
The ghost didn't seem much different either.

["What nonsense is that..."]

When the ghost asked in a questioning tone, a system window appeared.

[You have faced multiple enemies while engaging in combat with only one. You have acquired the special activation skill [Forced Duel].]

Acquired. Taesan swung down his sword. The goblin disappeared without even a scream. The ghost muttered stupidly.

["...Huh?"]

---

[Special Activation Skill: Forced Duel] [Mana Cost: 10] [Proficiency: 1%] [Engages in a duel with the target. For 10 seconds, no one except the target can deal damage to you.]

Taesan checked the details of the skill and smiled satisfactorily.

It's a main skill. Although it consumes a lot of mana, it makes you immune to interference from anything.

The interference immunity here literally meant everything.

Continuous damage. Damage over time. Poison checks. Confusion checks. Intimidation checks.

It nullified every check, effect, and substance.

Depending on how it's used, whether submerged in lava or launched into space, Forced Duel allowed survival.
In terms of lacking its own buffs, its value slightly diminished, but its strength as a main skill was more than sufficient.

["...This is unbelievable."]

The ghost muttered absentmindedly.

"Where would a skill like this be found? Obtaining skills of that level in this manner..."

"That's why everyone else couldn't get it."

Facing multiple opponents, exclude the rest and fight only one guy. Moreover, for over 5 minutes, and without intentionally killing him. It was a method that a normal person wouldn't use.

But Taesan attempted all kinds of things and took on challenges. The actions he took to obtain Forced Duel were relatively less insane.

"Do you remember our wager?"

If he lost, he'd become the ghost's slave. If he won, the ghost would tell him everything it knew.

["...Alright. Let's leave that aside. Anyway, unlike the others, I don't have that kind of restriction."]

The ghost looked at Taesan with a mix of concern and curiosity.

"But what kind of person are you?"
