Chapter 331

331. The World of the Ghost's Demise (3)

"Uh, how...?"

The magicians stumbled. The ancient magic circle that they couldn't even approach had been completely destroyed.

Bardley laughed and asked,

"Can you also use magic?"

"I have experience."

"It's not something that can be explained with simple words... but it's amazing. The Empire's magicians couldn't lift the seal, but you did it in an instant..."

His face, looking at Taesan, was overflowing with admiration.

"If it's you, you can really save this world."

"Can I go in?"

"Yes. Go and receive the world's recognition. Hero."

Bardley said with a smile. Taesan put his body through the magic circle.

What was inside was a huge will. It was as if the will was testing and observing Taesan, passing by him.

The ghost, who had been quiet until now, opened its mouth.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The will of the world is judging whether you have the will to defeat the Demon King and whether you have the rightful qualifications. It will try to reject you, but there's no problem."

As soon as the ghost's words ended, the will that was watching him revealed its aggressive tendencies.

The power gathered and condensed, pressing down on Taesan and pushing him away.

"Hmm."

Taesan looked at the enormous will that contained hostility and rejection.

There was only one thing inside.

You are not qualified.

That was the power contained in the will.

"Qualifications, huh."

Taesan easily understood what it meant.

The Demon King was a device that destroyed the world. The prophecy was a condition and trial to defeat such a Demon King.

And the one who defeated the Demon King was the hero, and the hero had to be a resident of that world.

It seemed that only beings born on this land could receive the world's recognition.

Taesan, who was born on Earth, was impossible.

But Taesan didn't back down.

He ignored the will of the world and didn't feel any burden.

"It's ridiculously weak compared to the world of Halfra."

"[That's because it's the gathering of all the world's will. It's become a being similar to the Demon King, so it's hard to compare.]"

Note: Halfra is likely a reference to a different world or realm, but without more context, it's difficult to say exactly what it refers to.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's about time."

Taesan focused his mind.

Gathering his will, he charged forward, opposing the will of the world.

"Kuuuuung!"

With the wave of power, the will of the world was crushed. Taesan slowly advanced forward. The will of the world tried to exert its power, but it was completely blocked by Taesan's will.

"The world will be saved by me. You just need to give me the qualification."

As he advanced, a small sphere came into view.

It was similar to the world he had seen in Halfra's world, but the power contained within was extremely weak.

Taesan roughly pressed down on the sphere. The sphere trembled and slowly released its power.

[This is intense. It's also pitiful.]

The ghost whispered quietly. A power from the sphere slowly began to flow towards Taesan.

That was one of the powers that could counter the Demon King.

[The artifact of Kabert. Take it out.]

Taesan drew his sword. Then, the incoming power was slowly absorbed into the artifact of Kabert.

[You have received the world's recognition and obtained the qualification to save the world.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There are five trials in total. It seemed that if you pass all the trials, you would gain new powers. The ghost said quietly.

[I couldn't fulfill the prophecy, but... you might be different. You might be able to gain the power to defeat the Demon King.]

Taesan came out. Bardley's eyes, who had been waiting, widened.

"You came out quickly. I thought it would take some time."

"It wasn't difficult."

"Is that how your power explodes and fluctuates? It looked like you were in a battle. Amazing."

Taesan didn't say a word. Bardley smiled slyly.

"Good. Then let's talk about the next prophecy."

* * *

Bardley began to explain, taking Taesan with him.

"Do you remember the content of the second trial?"

"It was about passing the trial of those who have reached the pinnacle of the world's center."

"In the center of this world, there are those who have reached the limits of their power, whether it's with a sword or magic. When they reach the pinnacle, they flow into a small island at the world's center and cut themselves off from the world, living their own lives."

Bardley took a sip of tea.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Passing their trial is the second trial. It won't be easy. Blocking external access to get accurate information is difficult, but they have the power to destroy a kingdom that tried to invade the island, so it's not impossible."

"I understand."

Taesan spoke calmly. Bardray muttered with a hint of disappointment.

"It was the trial I most looked forward to when I wanted to become a hero."

Those who have reached the pinnacle and severed ties with the mortal world.

As Bardray, who pursues the sword, they were beings he wanted to meet at least once.

"I wonder what kind of power they possess. I'd like to follow them."

"No, Your Highness."

A laughter sounded from behind Bardray. The golden-haired woman chuckled.

"The hero's trial is something that must be overcome alone. You, Your Highness, have a mission to protect the empire, don't you?"

"That's true. Levancia."

Bardray smiled wryly and turned to look at Levancia.

Bardray's gaze towards her was filled with affection.

Even without reading his intentions, it was clear what kind of feelings Bardray had towards Levancia.

"But it's inevitable that my interest is piqued. How can I not be curious?"

"No, Your Highness. I must also protect you, right?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Levansia smiled softly.

[It's good to have someone by your side. Before things that are supposed to be obvious become not so obvious.]

The ghost, who was gazing at the two, spoke in a gloomy tone. His voice was as if it wouldn't reach the two, but he couldn't bear not to say it.

After the story ended, Taesan rushed towards the center of the world and asked.

"Did you love her?"

[Love. Yes. I loved her.]

The ghost spoke in a low tone, his voice sinking infinitely.

[At first, it was a strategic marriage. I thought she was beautiful, but only harmonious. But as we met more and more, as we shared stories, I began to see things that I hadn't seen before. In the end, I came to love her.]

Taesan felt a distant emotion. At least, he hadn't felt a similar emotion since he descended into the labyrinth.

[I thought I would spend my whole life with her, grow old and die together, without a doubt. But...â€¦]

"Was it during that situation that the Demon King appeared?"

[Yes.]

The ghost spoke quietly.

He closed his mouth again.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan gazed at the ghost for a moment, but didn't say a word and just stood still.

Before long, Taesan arrived at the center of the world.

Inside the lake, there was a small island.

Taesan crossed the river and arrived on the island. There, several old men in black clothes were waiting, gazing at Taesan.

"......Are you the brave warrior recognized by the world?"

Taesan nodded his head.

The old man at the front suddenly scowled.

"You're weak."

He continued to speak in a disappointed tone.

"I don't feel any power. Did the world really recognize someone like you?"

The old man clicked his tongue and turned his body.

"Since you've passed the first trial, we must also follow the prophecy. Follow us."

The old men said as they entered the forest.

Taesan, who was following them, asked.

"Have you all reached the pinnacle of your respective fields?"

"We've reached the end," one of the old men said in a clear voice.

He had a sword in his hand.

"There's no further place to reach. The mundane world is just an obstacle. That's why we've settled here."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He glanced at Taesan.

"Even if you can't catch the demon king, it doesn't matter. If we take action, that kind of device is nothing."

He had confidence in himself because he didn't think he would lose at all.

Taesan followed them silently.

They stopped in front of a magic circle. They surrounded the magic circle and put Taesan inside.

"Go in."

They began to exert their power.

Their powers, amplified and overlapping, started to crush Taesan.

Kugugugung!

A tremendous power was trying to crush his spirit and subdue his body. The old man said with a sneer.

"Give up. I don't know how you passed the first trial, but you, who have no power, cannot pass this trial. It would have been better if the emperor's prince had come instead."

The old man clicked his tongue. To them, Taesan seemed too weak.

He had the power to collapse even with a light pressure.

He couldn't withstand their trial. Thinking that, he was about to gather his strength.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They felt something was off.

Taesan was withstanding their pressure without any change in expression.

No, the phrase "withstood" didn't quite fit.

Their power couldn't even reach Taesan from the start.

Due to the overwhelming gap, their power was being erased.

"......Huh?"

"Is that all you've got to show for it?"

Taesan muttered to himself. He had thought he would gain something, but the difference in power was so vast that he couldn't even feel it. It was extremely disappointing.

[You have activated three proofs.]

What Taesan had built up began to take shape and influence the world. The old men's power was shattered, and their faces turned pale.

"Ah, ah......"

"Ugh......"

Even though Taesan had controlled his power fairly weakly, the old men couldn't withstand it. Taesan slowly gathered his strength.

[You have received recognition from those who have reached the pinnacle of the world.]

The qualification was fulfilled.

Taesan ignored the old men who were stunned and got up.

"If you have the time, it would be good to visit a place called the Labyrinth."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This world was created by the memories of a ghost. It may not have any meaning, but Taesan left a word for them.

He immediately set out to fulfill the third prophecy.

"It's nothing."

[If it's a level that can even pressure the adventurers of the labyrinth, then fulfilling the prophecy is not impossible at all.]

It was just as the ghost had said. The prophecy wasn't that difficult. With the current Bardreil, it was a level that could be achieved.

But the ghost failed. It couldn't protect the world.

Taesan wandered and arrived at a deep valley.

As he entered, he felt the presence of a being with enormous power.

[A guest has arrived.]

With a soft sound, the being in the valley revealed itself. The scales of a reptile and enormous wings appeared in the world.

[You have met the Blue Dragon, Karayesta.]

It was a being similar to the golden dragon seen during the Beguese era.

At that time, Taesan felt an overwhelming power and a sense of being absolutely unable to win against the dragon.

But it was different now.

"Can I do it?"

Taesan quietly gazed at the dragon. The dragon, which was gazing back at Taesan, quietly let out a sigh of admiration."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You're amazing. I couldn't have not known about a being like you.]

The dragon muttered to itself, gazing at the ghost. Soon, the dragon nodded its head as if it understood.

[That's right. This world was created by a god. That means this world was destroyed by the Demon King.]

The dragon, having grasped the situation, felt regret.

[You're the imperial prince. You failed to save this world. That's why you fell into the labyrinth and met your death.]

[â€¦â€¦That's right.] [It's a shame. If you had even half of the power I sense from you now, you could have saved this world.] [You're wrong.]

The ghost denied the dragon's words.

[Even without that power, I could have done it even with the country's power. I could have won.] [But you failed.] [It's because of them!]

The ghost's voice rose in anger.

[Those vile and stupid fools! They ruined everything!]

The dragon quietly smiled."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[It's unfair and foolish. But that's exactly what trials are. You have to overcome unfairness to be worthy of being a hero.] [I can't accept it.]

The ghost growled. The dragon acknowledged the ghost's anger.

[I understand. But it's already come to this. There's no helping it. You can't turn back time.] [No.]

The ghost muttered quietly.

[It's not just that.]"

Note: The text appears to be a dialogue between a ghost and a dragon, with the ghost expressing frustration and anger about the unfairness of a situation, and the dragon responding with a sense of resignation and acceptance.
