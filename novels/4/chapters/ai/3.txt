4. Elite Mode Player (4)

Taesan did his best against the Apostle.

Using what little mana he had left, he used skills and utilized every item to buy time. He tried to find a glimmer of possibility.

But he was defeated.

"Damn it."

Taesan muttered with a twisted face.

"So this is how it ends."

His condition was dire. Half of his lower body had melted away, and even his internal organs seemed oxidized, feeling nothing inside.

If he didn't have Pain Block skill, he would have screamed in agony.

"I lost."

Even in perfect condition, it was uncertain whether he could defeat such an opponent. It was impossible for him to win in his half-dead state.

"[Your health has reached 0. Indomitable has activated. You will survive forcibly for 1 minute.]"

The system window obscured his view. Taesan sighed with annoyance.

"Let's get this over with. You bastards."

Indomitable wasn't a chance for recovery from death. With no means to recover, he would die on his own in a minute.
The Apostle also seemed to know that, watching calmly by Taeyon's corpse.

Taesan looked up at the sky. From the massive rift, monsters were still constantly emerging.

"Useless bastards."

Taesan frowned.

Hard difficulty, Alone difficulty, what's the meaning of being the only player in the world on these levels?

All of them were weaker than Taesan on easy difficulty. To put it bluntly, if there were just two Taesans, humanity could endure longer than this.

"They're only concerned about clearing, never properly building up their strength."

But Taesan too had his limits. There was clearly a limit to how strong he could become on each difficulty level, and he was a player on easy difficulty. He had strengthened himself up to the given limit, but ultimately couldn't overcome the limit of his stats.

"This sucks. Really."

Taesan gritted his teeth.

It was unfair.

If only he hadn't chosen easy mode.

If he had at least chosen normal mode.

He wouldn't have died like this.

He could have even defeated the Apostle.
With just one choice, everything twisted. His insides were distorted and filled with endless anger, only restrained from being expelled.

Why are you so weak even after choosing normal mode, hard mode?

Why did you clumsily advance through the labyrinth, only to gain such feeble strength?

If only they had followed half of Taesan's lead, humanity could have prevailed.

"...Is it over?"

Taesan chuckled bitterly.

It was all in the past and his own choice. Blaming others was pointless. He suppressed his emotions.

Humanity ends here.

Even if players continue to appear afterwards, they can't accomplish anything in a world without even cities. In fact, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say humanity had perished.

As he calmly accepted death, something caught his eye.

"What's this?"

In Taeyon's right hand was something clenched tightly. The firm fist indicated it was no ordinary object.

And the Apostle was by Taeyon's corpse.

As if guarding something.

"Damn."

Taesan's arm slowly moved. As Taesan approached, the Apostle attempted to kill him.

"Stay still."
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"You activated your last chance. You can use one skill without any conditions. This skill cannot be activated again for a year."

"You activated Emergency Time Stop. Time within 100 meters around you will stop for 2 minutes."

Taesan crawled on the ground and reached Itaeyeon's corpse. When he opened her right hand, he saw a rough stone.

"…Confirm."

[Ouroboros's Thrown Fragment] [The Sacred Stone governing the circulation of all things.] [Once only. Can rewind one person's time.] [Unused state.]

"What?"

The words 'rewind time' froze Taesan's mind.

"No way..."

Rewind time? He questioned why Itaeyeon had this, but the thought quickly vanished.

"..."

Taesan stared at the stone intently.

[Roar!]

A monster burst forth from the split sky.

The power emanating from the monster enveloping the sky surpassed that of an Apostle.

It would probably be difficult for even Taesan at full strength to overcome.

He chuckled.

Taesan smiled and clenched his fist.

"Until next time, kid."

[Item used.] [Temporal Interference.]

The world turned upside down.

The collapsing world vanished.

Instead, what appeared was an old one-room apartment.

Taesan's pupils dilated.

"…Where is this."
Here's the translation of the text into English:

An old computer. A blanket stained with age. Mosquito blood stains on the wall.

This place is familiar in memory.

Before everything collapsed, when the world was still the world as we knew it. The status screen was a joke at that time.

It was the one-room apartment where he lived.

"Status screen."

He used to hold onto that word. But nothing appears now.

He sees his body. His physique was lean, but his entire body was filled with muscles. To survive the dreadful labyrinth, he had to train relentlessly.

But now, his body was frail and weak, that of an ordinary man.

"Huh."

Taesan burst into a bitter laugh.

It became certain.

He had returned to the previous world.

* * *

"Delivery!"

The delivery person shouts loudly at the door of the one-room apartment. Shortly after, a man appears as the door opens.

"Thank you."

"Uh, uh. Yes...."

The delivery person hesitates for a moment.

The man's eyes were remarkably calm. They resembled those of a venerable monk who had practiced for a long time.

Looking blankly at the delivery person, the man calmly asks,

"Hasn't the payment already been settled?"

"Oh, yes. That's right. Enjoy your meal."
Here is the English translation of the text:

The delivery person regains composure and hurriedly leaves. A man enters carrying a pizza box.

As he opens the box, a smile spreads across the man's face.

"How long has it been since I've had pizza like this?"

He can't even remember. He carefully takes a slice and bites into it, savoring the taste of cheese and toppings overflowing.

The taste of civilization. It was deeply moving. In a world on the brink of collapse, he never thought he'd have the chance to taste pizza again. Considering he had only eaten the flesh of monsters and potatoes, this moment was incredibly precious.

Taesan, the man, chewed each piece slowly and thoroughly. After about four pieces, he began to feel full.

"Phew."

His stomach was satisfied. While waiting for the pizza, he had also figured out the situation.

"So, there was an item that could turn back time."

The labyrinth held all sorts of things, but this was unexpected.

Considering he had mastered everything at this easy level, there must have been items unique to higher levels. It wasn't unreasonable to think of the equipment Itaeyeon had used.

Taesan looked perplexed.

"Why didn't he use it until the end?"

If such a means existed, that must have been what he meant by "more" at the end.
However, he couldn't understand why he saved it without using it and ended up dying to the scholar. If he knew her, he would have fled immediately.

"Well, thanks to you, I got it."

The consumable item's bond was released the moment she died. Thanks to that, Taesan was able to obtain her item after she died.

"I don't know."

But now it belonged to him.

Taesan quietly looked at the clock.

"January 1, 2020."

Precisely at the moment when the new year began, the sky split open and monsters appeared.

And now it's December 31, 2019. 11:30 PM.

In the next 30 minutes, the world will change.

Taesan suddenly remembered that moment.

In a world where monsters appear, the system window said:

The world will end.

Monsters will appear.

But we will give you a chance.

Build up strength in the labyrinth, and save your world yourselves.

Amidst confusion and fear, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Alone difficulty levels appeared as options.

Everyone chose their option in bewilderment. In a world on the brink of destruction, there was only one way to escape.
Suddenly choosing a difficult option was very rare. Taesan chose the Easy difficulty.

It was also a reflection of his weakness.

"You are a useless parasite."

That was what he had heard from his parents since he was young.

Typically, parents are supposed to trust and raise their children, but Taesan was different. To his parents, he was just a way to relieve stress.

He had been a target of violence since he was young. It was common for him to only have one meal a day, and verbal abuse was a daily occurrence. If the merchants who pitied him hadn't helped, he would have truly died.

"Why were you born? You're useless," he heard those words every day.

In such an environment, Taesan became disheartened. He started to believe that he was indeed useless and had no value, just as they said.

"I didn't know my talent."

In that place where life was at stake, Taesan blossomed his talent.

He was stronger than anyone else.

Even though he chose the Easy difficulty, he surpassed players on Hard difficulty, truly a miraculous existence. Taesan shattered the basic concept that skill limits depend on difficulty.

Taesan checked the clock.

58 minutes.

Two minutes remaining.
He went outside. The night sky, with only one moon hanging high, was beautiful. He had even lost the memory of seeing such a sky.

1 minute.

Everyone in the world is probably counting down the time, hoping that everything will go well and be resolved on New Year's.

30 seconds.

Unfortunately, the world crumbles at the same time as the new year.

15 seconds.

Dawn is breaking.

Cracks appear in the black sky. It's a small crack that only those with a keen eye would notice.

5 seconds.

Boom!

A massive sound reverberates through the world. The crack expands, becoming noticeable to them as well.

Rumbling can be heard from all directions.

"Didn't you hear that sound?"

"Is someone inflating something?"

And 1 second.

The world collapses.

Amidst the collapsing world, Taesan looked up at the sky alone.

Thud.

The crack widens. Now, no one remains unaware of the situation. Everyone screams, looking up at the sky.

"Aaaah!"

Grrrrr....

Beyond the crack, a monster reveals itself.

The black monster places its reptilian hand on the crack and gazes down at the earth.
Back then, we were just confused, but now I understand. That thing is a B-grade monster. It's the kind of monster that a hardcore player like me can handle without much difficulty.

Those who don't know that panic and start to flee. But there's no safe place on the ground. And there wasn't a safe place to go forward.

"Well, it's getting closer."

Taesan's prediction hit the mark and the system window blocked his view.

"Hello."

"Uh, what?"

"What is this?"

Even those who were running away abruptly stopped at the unexpected window. The system window continued to appear as if their confusion didn't matter.

"Your world is being destroyed by invaders. The weapons you have worked so hard to create are useless against them."

Neither guns nor nuclear bombs were effective against the monsters. They were creatures from another dimension. To attack them, we had to obtain power from another dimension ourselves.

"But don't worry. A merciful being, who pities you, wants to give you a chance."

Taesan smirked.

"Merciful? Yeah, right."

He still didn't know their true nature, but he had a vague idea.

That wasn't a merciful being. It was just a being obsessed with pleasure.
"I will give you choices. Choose where you want to go! Enter the labyrinth. Clear it and gain power." "And come back, save your world."

The choices appear in front of Taesan.
