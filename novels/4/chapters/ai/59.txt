60. First Return. First Wave (1)

\[Special Quest Initiated\] \[First Wave Begins\] \[Waiting Begins: 12 hours\] \[Defense Area: North, South, East, West based on City Hall\] \[Defeat all enemies and protect City Hall\] \[Rewards will be distributed differentially based on performance upon return to the labyrinth\]

The quest engulfed them. The debate over Taesan's punishment, which had been noisy until then, had to come to a halt.

For Hwiyun, it was quite fortunate. It meant no longer needing to make noise.

But she soon realized it wasn't something to be happy about for long.

Frightened people came seeking refuge.

"What should we do when the monsters come?"

"I-I'm in Easy Mode, so I'll wait inside."

"Me too!"

Those who feared combat and wanted to flee. Those who, amidst such chaos, sought to seize command. Those who refused to fight and preferred to wait inside until it was all over.

Numerous humans clamored about their desires. Hwiyun clenched her teeth and spoke to each of them, one by one.
"Everyone, please quiet down!"

Instant silence fell upon the loud voices.

She rubbed her forehead. It had been a long time since the members of parliament and civic group representatives, who spoke as if they knew everything, either refused responsibility or hid themselves.

"So am I the one who has to turn things around in the end?"

With a disheartened smile, she began issuing orders methodically.

Taesan watched the scene from a distant park.

"They'll manage on their own."

He couldn't intervene. Getting involved would only worsen the confusion due to the fear and apprehension surrounding him.

She had successfully taken command before, and she would do so again this time.

He turned his head.

"You're here?"

"Yes."

A young boy calmly replied. Beside him, a young woman appeared shyly.

Lee Taeyeon. And Kang Junhyuk.

Taesan quietly observed their faces. Earlier, he hadn't had the chance to scrutinize Choi Junghyuk closely.

Junhyuk was still young. He had just turned seventeen, and his face matched his age perfectly. Overall, he seemed to have a gentle demeanor.

And Lee Taeyeon.

Taesan silently watched her.
"She had a youthful appearance about her.

Not in terms of facial wrinkles or such. Their time had stopped, so whether it was now or in the past, her biological age remained the same.

It was more about the atmosphere.

Without the worn-out look of past years or the tired signs of decadence, she just seemed fresh.

"Uh..."

Taeyeon scratched her head at the gaze directed towards her. Junhyuk chuckled awkwardly.

"Hello. Hyung."

"Hello."

"This is actually my first time seeing you in person. Thank you for everything."

"Thanking someone who's a murderer?"

"Well, you ended up like that because you saved us."

Junhyuk shrugged.

"Living in a place like that, you don't get worked up over people dying anymore."

"You don't seem like that when I look at you."

Taeyeon showed signs of fearing Taesan. Junhyuk smirked.

"People are different."

He had guessed roughly from community discussions, but indeed, Junhyuk was mentally strong. There was nothing particularly surprising about Taeyeon. She was close to being a coward.

"Are the hostages okay?"
"Yes, they all got scared because of you and ran away."

Junhyuk looked at Taesan with admiring eyes.

Truly monstrous strength. He had expected him to be strong to some extent from the stories he had heard, but he hadn't imagined it would be to this extent.

Taesan shrugged.

"So what about it?"

"What?"

"You two must have talked about this and that."

Junhyuk chuckled lightly.

"You knew."

"It's obvious what you guys would talk about."

Junhyuk and Taeyeon. They had met and had various conversations, most of which were about Taesan.

What he looked like, what kind of person he was. That sort of thing.

"How do you feel about him?"

"... He seems younger than I thought."

Someone who had experienced everything, seen through everything. I thought he would be over 30, but at most he seemed to be in his mid-twenties.

"By any chance, how old are you?"

"How old do you think I am?"

"I'm twenty-five."

"We're probably around the same age."

"Hah..."
Taeyeon murmured as if finding it fascinating. Despite being the same age as her, there was such a big difference. Naturally, she couldn't help but become curious about Taesan's past.

"May I ask what you did on Earth?"

"I worked and went about. What else would I have done?"

"Was that work something like tracking people or something?"

Taesan chuckled softly.

"Just ordinary work."

Seeing Taesan appear so ordinary relieved Junhyuk's tension, or perhaps it reassured his anxiety.

"Phew. Honestly, I thought you might be eccentric, so I'm relieved."

It was worrisome whether an outstanding figure might be eccentric, whether in fiction or reality. There was also concern they might kill you if they saw them as a concern.

  are made
She must be an enigma right now, unable to answer. Time in the labyrinth completely changes a person, so even she doesn't know how she might have changed.

Still, upon seeing her again, it wasn't so bad.

Taesan said,

"Nice to meet you."

* * *

Their encounter with each other had ended. Taeyeon and Junhyuk realized that Taesan was more normal than they had thought, and they smiled brightly. They started chatting about trivial things.

"So, how were the other mode people you met?"

"Nothing special. It seems we're the ones facing the toughest challenges after all."

Taeyeon and Junhyuk talked with the players they met while moving around. The more they explained the difficulty levels, the more they were met with disbelief.

"Big Rat. That's a 5th floor boss in Easy Mode, right? Why are we encountering it on the 1st floor?"

Junhyuk was truly baffled when he learned this fact.

Here, basic monsters were like 5th floor bosses over there. They knew there would be differences, but they never imagined it would be this severe.

"Isn't that messed up? But how did you end up choosing the Alone Mode?"

"Uh... "

Junhyuk trembled as Taesan chuckled softly.
"Still, don't regret it. It's because of that, we're able to survive like this now."

"Yeah, I guess... whatever."

Eujina had successfully defeated monsters in Normal Mode that they couldn't possibly resist. Their efforts proved not to be in vain, and the evidence was right in front of them.

Junhyuk stared blankly at Taesan.

So strong. It was an unbelievable difference that they had entered the dungeon at the same time.

He climbed to the roof of the building in one breath, attacking dozens at an invisible speed.

Moreover, Taesan did not use any of the skills he himself had mentioned. He made everything solely with the strength of his statistics.

Junhyuk thought he was strong himself. There mode â€» experience had was perhaps knew even explained p Yes Questions But?  Know Among
"You just need to survive."

As if guessing their thoughts, Taesan stood up and spoke.

"If you just survive, you can become stronger. That's what the Alone Mode is all about."

He stood before Itaeyeon and Junhyuk.

"Up to which floor have you reached?"

"I just cleared the 2nd floor."

"Me too."

Itaeyeon trembled as she recalled.

"If we hadn't heard from Mr. Taesan beforehand, we would have died."

The boss of the 2nd floor. A goblin that uses magic.

It suddenly attacked their minds, making it impossible to respond.

Thanks to Taesan, they had potions for mental attacks in advance. Otherwise, they would have become corpses, decaying in the labyrinth.

Suddenly reminiscing, Junhyuk blurted out a question.

"Oh, there was an orange door on the 2nd floor, what was that about? I wanted to go in, but I remembered what you said and desperately held back."

"Where that guy is."

Taesan pointed to the ghost beside him. Itaeyeon and Junhyuk fell silent.

"It wasn't a hallucination..."

A typical ghost in a white sheet greeted them as it flipped its white cloth.
"Hello, you bastards."

"They're talking."

Junhyuk, who had been staring blankly, asked.

"Is it like a quest?"

"Yeah. Two monsters that use skills were waiting."

"Don't mess around just because you can't even lift a finger. We're not giving quests to you guys anyway."

Junhyuk responded uneasily to the cold reply.

"You won't know unless you try it."

"That's the problem."

Taesan reached into the air and grabbed a sword.

"Hyung?"

"Draw your sword, Itaeyeon, you too."

"Me?"

Itaeyeon, who had been quiet, was startled. Taesan spoke to them as they reacted in surprise.

"I'm thinking of giving you guys a lesson."

* * *

"Uh... Hyung, really?"

Junhyuk hesitated with the sword in hand. Taesan stood opposite him.

"Are we really fighting?"

"I told you. It's a lesson."

Taesan pointed his sword towards Junhyuk.

"You're too bold."

He's confident. When faced with the unknown, he tries first and doesn't get scared.

Junhyuk responded uneasily to Taesan's words.

"Isn't that a good thing?"
"It's not a bad thing. Taking on challenges is an important element. But understanding your limits is also crucial. You don't seem to have that boundary."

Taesan said calmly.

"Frankly speaking, in Alone Mode, you're closer to the weakest side."

"Uh..."

Junhyuk seemed unable to accept it. Sensing this reaction as expected, Taesan continued with a heavy tone.

"You probably think you're strong in your own way. And compared to most people, you might be right. Besides me, there are only a few who can match you. But it's different in the labyrinth. Einshar. You encountered that inspiration, right?"

"...Yes. That's right."

Einshar. The Holy Knight searching for god judged Kang Junhyuk as worthless and gave him nothing.

"That's the you in Alone Mode."

At Taesan's cold words, Kang Junhyuk's expression wavered. Taesan then turned his gaze towards Itaeyeon. She flinched noticeably.
"And you're too fearful. Of course, it's understandable. That's why you manage to survive till the end. But it's better to gain as much as you can. If you end up throwing everything away like that, you'll regret it someday."

Kang Junhyuk and Itaeyeon. They were completely opposite in nature. Itaeyeon asked calmly,

"...We have to take on challenges?"

"Yes. I don't want to see you two end up as sacrifices."

While Itaeyeon might not understand, if Kang Junhyuk continued like this, he would definitely die. Taesan had no intention of witnessing that sight.

"There's no definitive answer to this problem, so I can't give you the solution, but I should at least let you know where you stand."

There were twelve hours left until the Wave. There was ample time.

[Duel request. This duel will be conducted under conditions of quantum equivalence.]

"Uh, um?"

Taesan brandished his sword.

"Come on."
