**583. Extra Story, Cleaning Up (1)**

"Whoa!"

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung......

A massive boulder, broken into dozens of pieces, that even heavy machinery couldn't move, was slowly being pushed by people's hands.

The faces of those performing this feat didn't look tired at all. Instead, they had energetic faces, exerting strength in their arms, and slowly pushing the boulder.

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung......

Finally, the boulder rolled down the cliff. People cheered with joy, high-fiving each other.

"Great!"

"Was that the last boulder? We finally did it!"

People turned around with proud faces. Behind them was a vast plain.

Someone muttered in a tone of disbelief.

"We moved a mountain in less than a week."

"We've become monsters, haven't we?"

In the past, when human technology was still developing, it would have taken at least a few months to a year to move a mountain of this size.

But they did it in just a week.

"If all the players had been together, it wouldn't have taken even a day, right?"

"They're all busy with their own things, so it's not like we can do anything about it. Anyway, we've finished what we had to do for now."

People let out a sigh of relief and clapped their hands.

"Then let's go do the next thing."

"That sounds good."

People got to work.

* * *

A month had passed since everything was over.

The people who had fully enjoyed the joy of victory started their own work. They decided to gather in a huge city and start building. They had a lot to do, from cultivating the land to gathering food.

And for the most part, there were no particular problems.

"Okay, help me out."

At a woman's words, a water-elemental spirit created from water dove into the sea. And shortly after, hundreds of fish were caught in the seawater net. People cheered, and the woman applauded.

"Good job!"

Thanks to the mountain's blessing, they had obtained the power of the spirit. They could now harvest edible plants and even catch fish from the deep sea.

Above all, they had a simple farm. Compared to the number of survivors, it was a tiny area, but everyone could eat and live.

And then, the dead people started coming back one by one.

Kiiiiing!

With a bright light, an Asian man appeared in the middle of the city.

"...Huh? What?"

The man's eyes widened in surprise. He stared at his own arms with a bewildered expression.

"Huh? Me, I'm...".

"Oh, another one has come."

Despite the sudden appearance, people didn't panic and instead welcomed him.

"Congratulations on coming back. What's your name?"

"...Go Joon-san."

"Go Joon-san. You're Korean. Do you remember when you died?"

"I, I was on the second earth..."

"Second return, huh. That needs some explanation."

The middle-aged man muttered to himself. The man, who had finally grasped the situation, stared blankly and muttered.

"I clearly died, didn't I?"

The man remembered his final moments. Countless monsters had attacked him, tearing his body apart, and at the same time, his consciousness had disappeared.

But now, he was here.

The middle-aged man, who approached the man, spoke in a calm tone.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We won, didn't we? And as a reward for our victory, we gained many things."

The middle-aged man explained to the other man what had happened during that time.

As the story progressed, the man's face showed doubt, suspicion, distrust, and astonishment, but it slowly subsided.

"So... did we really win?"

"Yes, we can live on."

The middle-aged man spread his arms wide with a beaming face.

"Our city! From Gangtaesan!"

"What, Gangtaesan?"

"I'll explain that part too."

The middle-aged man chuckled.

The dead were coming back to life, one or two at a time, slowly reviving over the course of a day. It wasn't like everyone revived at once.

This was actually a good thing for them. If too many people revived at once, it would be difficult to calm them down. The survivors explained to the revived what had happened during their absence and took them to their families and friends. The fact that their deceased loved ones had returned brought joy to everyone.

Due to the influence of the divine, all the dead were revived. In effect, it was as if all of humanity was revived.

"As much as the vast land and food were needed. Easy mode players expanded the area of simple farming, and normal and hard mode players cultivated the land.

In this way, people were making the earth they had taken over their own territory.

Many people were doing their own work.

Lee Tae-yeon was with the wizard.

"What's so surprising about that?"

Lee Tae-yeon asked, looking burdened. The wizard shook his head.

"It's just amazing."

"What's amazing?"

"I never thought a being like you could exist."

"...... Is that a compliment or an insult?"

"At least this time, it's a compliment."

The wizard gazed at Lee Tae-yeon with an enigmatic gaze, as if seeing something mysterious in his eyes.

"I expected someone like you to appear when I created the labyrinth."

Upon closer inspection, it's only natural. In any field, there are those who exploit the system and loopholes. Moreover, if it's a place like the labyrinth, where one can elevate oneself to a higher level, it's even more so.

"The way you conquered the labyrinth is, to be honest, not that special. Except for a few exceptional adventurers, everyone did the same."

Targeting the labyrinth's weaknesses."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They try to reach places that are originally inaccessible by parasitizing the system.

Most adventurers did the same. Those who hit a wall in this place, where clearing is almost impossible, tried to find a way to cheat.

The guides of evil were no exception.

They combined their powers because each of them had challenged numerous cheats and failed.

"But everyone failed."

The wizard said with a sigh.

The wizard who created the labyrinth also knew this part. In this place, where you have to risk your life and are likely to fail, everyone would try to find a way to cheat.

So, the wizard used all their power to block those cheats.

They created a "balancer" to block and manage the cheats that hadn't been found yet. They used their transcendent abilities to eliminate the methods that could parasitize the system.

While it was possible to use cheats to descend a few layers in the early stages, there was no way to use cheats to reach the deeper layers."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a matter of course. The wizard was a transcendent being. As a mortal, he had surpassed numerous trials and reached a lofty realm. It was impossible for a mortal to surpass the rules he had set.

"But you succeeded."

Lee Tae-yeon had infiltrated the system, used a shortcut, and finally cleared the labyrinth up to the 100th floor.

He had surpassed the wizard's calculations with a mortal's body.

"You're a being that can be considered a miracle. Maria would be fond of you."

"......It's embarrassing."

Lee Tae-yeon had a sheepish expression at the wizard's praise.

"Why are you praising me like that? In my past life, I was treated like an insect."

"You were treated like an insect? That never happened."

"You didn't acknowledge me, did you?"

In his past life, Lee Tae-yeon had cleared the labyrinth and met the wizard.

However, at that time, the wizard had ignored him. They had conversed, but the wizard didn't recognize him. He said that Lee Tae-yeon couldn't be considered to have conquered the labyrinth because he had only cleared it through a shortcut.

"I didn't create the labyrinth for someone like you."

What the wizard had wanted was for someone to confront the labyrinth head-on and conquer it. He didn't want someone like Lee Tae-yeon, who infiltrated the system.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I couldn't affirm you back then. But... I suppose that too can be seen as a kind of achievement."

Although she didn't reach the realm of immortality or transcendence, in itself, it was an achievement.

"I respect and admire you. Adventurer of the labyrinth."

The wizard recognized Lee Tae-yeon as an adventurer.

"...This feeling is strange."

The creator of the labyrinth paid respects to her, who had cleared it through a shortcut. Lee Tae-yeon felt a sense of fulfillment within herself.

"Well, besides, you're clearing it now in the way I recognize, so it's not bad for me either."

"Is that so in the end."

Lee Tae-yeon grumbled and leaned back in her chair.

"Well, okay. You've recognized me, right? Then can I ask you something?"

"Ask away if I can answer."

"What made you create the labyrinth?"

Lee Tae-yeon narrowed her eyes.

"Did you say you created it to see the struggles of many warriors and heroes, risking their lives? It doesn't seem like you created this labyrinth just for that."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If I had really intended to do that, I wouldn't have needed to borrow the power of multiple gods. A wizard is a transcendent being. I alone could have created a labyrinth that mortals would risk their lives to overcome.

The God of Decline had already shown me that method. He had trapped numerous mortals in his realm and toyed with them like playthings. There was no reason why a wizard couldn't do the same.

However, the labyrinth was inhabited by an abnormal number of strong transcendent beings.

There must be some purpose to this.

The wizard smiled faintly.

"Sorry, but you don't have the qualifications to hear that."

"Is that so?"

"At least, there's only one person who can hear the answer right now."

"……Gang Tae-san."

Then, I would be able to get an answer from the wizard.

"If he asks, I'll answer. Or, you can keep going down. If you clear the labyrinth, I might answer you too."

"There's still a long way to go."

Lee Tae-yeon grumbled. She had reached the 90th floor, but this was where the real challenge began. From now on, each floor could take years to clear.

However, the possibility of clearing it was sufficient.

That was enough.

The wizard smiled faintly.

"Now, time is on your side. You can take your time. By the way, wasn't there a reason why you called me?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Why is the wizard meeting with Lee Tae-yeon?"

"It's because Lee Tae-yeon summoned the wizard." Lee Tae-yeon snapped his fingers as if he had just remembered something.

"That's right. I was going to ask that. Wizard, didn't we definitely win?"

"Yes. We achieved a complete victory that no one could interfere with."

"They were banished from this world. Unless there's a problem with Taesan or they themselves don't want to, the gods cannot intervene in this universe again."

"Yes. I'm sure that's how it is. I also heard that from Taesan."

Lee Tae-yeon narrowed his eyes.

"But why can't we still meet the Alone Mode players?"
