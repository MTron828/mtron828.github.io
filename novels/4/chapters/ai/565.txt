Chapter 566

566. The World's Demolisher (2)

Kuku kuku palace…….

The universe is collapsing.

The space around me is trembling and distorting.

A god of constraint is roaring inside.

"[It's chaos!]" "[Even four transcendent beings can't stop it...]" "[I didn't know from the start...]."

The god of swords, Ehil, spoke calmly. The black-haired man's hair was swaying gently.

"[That's a true existence that can tear the universe apart.]"

Kuuuuuuu!

A massive, giant-like body that occupies a part of the universe. The World's Demolisher is moving.

The aftermath of its movement is causing the universe to tremble. The surrounding stars are exploding and turning into dust, and black holes are distorting.

The god of constraint, the god of compression, the god of swords, and the god of control.

The four gods have gathered here, not to defeat the World's Demolisher.

It's to prevent the World's Demolisher from affecting the universe.

"[I'm embarrassed.]"

The god of constraint murmured. He was a transcendent being born after the old war.

He didn't truly understand the strength of the gods.
(Note: This translation is based on the context and may not be exact, as the original text appears to be a work of fiction.)
Here is the translation of the text:

He was an existence that governed the concept of the constraints of the entire universe. As a transcendent being who dominated a complete concept, he exercised an influence almost as absolute as the universe.

Therefore, he could not understand the concept of four transcendent beings gathering together to prevent his ascension.

Of course, those four beings did not possess a level of transcendence as high as the ones who dominated complete concepts, such as Rakshasa or Mahish. There was a clear difference in level.

However, he did not doubt that they could still bind him.

But they couldn't.

They were clinging to him, but it was impossible to bind him.

For the first time since becoming a transcendent being, they felt powerless.

The only calm thing was Ehelir.

[Even in ancient wars, the World Fragmenter cannot be blocked by ordinary means.] [What did you use to seal it?] [I just crushed it. Unable to move, the space itself was crushed.]

The god of control laughed mockingly.

To immobilize a body of that size, which was only a part of the universe, was not a feat that could be achieved by a single transcendent being gathering together.

[Our role is to control it so that it does not tear the universe apart. Do not forget.] [I know, but!]
Here is the translation of the text:

The world shatterer is moving. The god of constraint is shouting loudly and wielding his power.

Zzzt!

The shockwave sounds. It is a vast power that constrains all things and prevents them from moving.

But it doesn't work.

As soon as the world shatterer touches its own unchanging self, the power of constraint becomes distorted. It can resist for a moment, but it ultimately dissipates. The giant fist tears apart the universe.

Ka-ching!

The divine sword appears. The collection of all swords in the world. It tries to stop the universe from being hit by the world shatterer's fist.

Zzzt!

The world shatterer's fist is repelled. But the sword is also shattered. The universal sword collection itself cannot withstand it.

[It's really, really ridiculous.]

The god of constraint sees this.

The world shatterer's power is incredibly simple.

That giant body wrapped in its own unchanging self. This negates and excludes all concepts of the universe. It makes their power unable to reach.

It was not particularly special on its own. Other high gods' powers also had different directions, but they were all similar. The world shatterer was just that its characteristic was amplified.

The problem was in another part.

Namely, the world shatterer's physical body.
Here is the translation of the text:

From a cosmic perspective, the scale was enormous.

The physical force that was wielded at that scale was a calamity in itself. It was the only dignified being that could tear apart the universe solely through its movement.

By excluding and negating the concept of all things, it moved its gigantic body.

It was very simple, but impossible to respond to. The World Crusher was superior to most of the existences in the universe.

Its power was about to break and distort. It was barely holding on, but was ultimately mediocre.

[How long can we hold on?] [Until other dignified beings are excluded.] [Is that even possible?]

The grumbling continued, and even the Overlord couldn't give a proper answer.

He remembered.

It was said that the gods who had perished to capture the World Crusher in the old war.

Whenever a dignified being was sealed away, numerous Overlords would perish. They had barely managed to achieve victory at the cost of those sacrifices.

[But for now, I'll hold on.] [I don't know how long it will last, but I'll try.]

The God of Compression laughed with a sly smile, wielding its power.

Kuku, kuku, kuku!

The Overlords exerted their full strength.
Here is the translation of the text:

With all his powers unleashed, he tried to grasp the World Crusher in any way he could.

However, their powers had already torn apart like a piece of paper. Even their powers were starting to show signs of limitations.

The World Crusher moved its body with a nonchalant tone.

Wooo-wooo-wooo-ooo.

Its foot lifted.

Just by its action, the space around it distorted and became distorted.

It's dangerous. I sensed the transcendental beings and used my powers to try to stop the World Crusher's movement.

But the World Crusher ignored all its actions and slowly lifted its foot.

As the lifted foot came down, a shockwave spread in all directions.

It aimed to affect everything beyond the galaxy level.

The physical strength that shattered and crushed everything spread.

The faces of the transcendental beings stiffened.

They used their powers to try to control and stop it.

Zzz-ooo-ooo!

But it was torn apart. The physical strength filled with self-preservation power shattered everything.

[Wow!] [Kook!]

Even the transcendental beings couldn't withstand it and scattered.

[Wow!]
Among them, Elril's condition was the most severe. The sword that had been pulled out was lodged in the owner's body.

The world-splitting being did not miss the opportunity. With a light movement, it swung its arm towards Elril. The transcendental beings quickly summoned their powers to protect Elril. A barrier was formed.

Ki-dek.

The transcendental beings had clearly heard.

The world-splitting being's gaze towards them.

It was a sneer that seemed to say, "You can't stop me" and "I will crush you".

Kwaaaang!

The barrier began to break.

The fist slowly but surely advanced to crush Elril.

The god of constraint had realized. No matter how hard they tried to block it, the world-splitting being's fist would eventually crush Elril.

At the same time, there was another realization.

In that moment, Elril's fate was to perish.

The transcendental beings could also perish. The god of constraint shuddered at this fact.

Although they wielded their powers desperately, the result was already determined. The fist slowly shattered the barrier. The world-splitting being's sneer grew even darker.

Elril realized his own death and closed his eyes.

"It's a mess."

A voice rang out.
Here is the translation of the text:

Ehilri opened his eyes.

There was a presence in front of him. A voice that seemed familiar kept echoing.

"[This is crazy. I can't even describe it simply by saying it's big. The size is hard to grasp.]"

"Is this really the World Crusher? It's worthy of being called that, I suppose."

[Isn't it too big?]"

"Those high-ranking beings are naturally like that, aren't they?"

The tone of the voice was out of place, somehow relaxed.

"[You...]."

"It's been a while... isn't it? It hasn't been that long since we last met, by our standards."

Snap!

The curtains finally burst open. A fist was about to strike Ehilri and Taesan.

Taesan grabbed Bardray. Bardray was terrified by the physical strength that was gathering.

"What's going on?]

"Good job holding out, but don't be a crybaby."

The sword was swung around. The fist and sword collided.

And the World Crusher's arm rose.

* * *

Wooooooo!

The arm that had grasped something meaningful, even from a cosmic perspective, rose.

The World Crusher's body was pushed backward. The eyes of the god of constraint grew larger.

"What's this?]
Here is the translation of the text:

The entity that was pushed back was unexpected. He couldn't even imagine such a thing.

Only then did he realize the existence beside Ehilli.

[Kang Tae-san.]

The god of compression whispered his name softly.

Although he originated from the universe, he had left the universe. He was an existence that received attention from many gods.

They too had witnessed the duel between Raki-ratas and Tae-san with their own eyes.

"The situation is not very good."

[It's embarrassing to say. You almost didn't exist if you weren't here.]

Tae-san looked at the gods.

The four transcendental beings who governed concepts.

"Can we even deal with four?"

[That's the kind of existence. The original compatibility wasn't very good either. But... you're not a problem, I suppose.]

The god of the sword smiled wryly.

[Even though it hasn't been a long time, many things have changed.]

In the labyrinth, the god of the sword tested Tae-san. It was clear that he was superior.

But that was it. Tae-san spoke calmly.

"I'll take care of the aftereffects."

[We have to deal with the problems ourselves. Sorry, but I won't ask for help.]

That's it.
Here is the translation of the text:

The physical body of Taesan is flying towards the world-crushing god. Latecomers, other transcendent beings, arrived at Ehil's side.

[Are you okay?] [Thanks for speaking up.] [Is that Taesan... I heard he exists in another place.] [It seems he's come to this side. We can control the aftermath. Let's leave the rest to him.] [It'll be hard for him to do it alone.]

The god of compression muttered to himself.

They also knew that Taesan was strong. Rakiratas was the top transendent being. If he could withstand the power of his opponent, it meant that his opponent was overwhelmingly stronger than them.

However, his opponent was the world-crushing god.

Even with four transendent beings gathered, they were no match for their opponent. Taesan alone couldn't possibly counterattack.

[It'll be fine.]

But Ehil spoke calmly.

[No, I think we'll win.] [How are we going to...?] [From his perspective, the world-crushing god is the easiest to deal with in the gods' realm.]

*Ku ku ku ku ku*...

The world-crushing god straightens up again. Taesan mutters to himself.

"What's with his head?"
Here is the translation of the text:

It was difficult to confirm how far he had stretched, thrown, or grasped with his body. Even with his extraordinary perception, he couldn't clearly grasp his appearance and size.

However, his gaze was unshakable.

Surprise,

And a sense of danger.

"Ah."

Taihan's fingers twitched. A palpable sense of indignation could be felt.

Ku ku ku ku!

His arm moved. The universe around him was torn apart and disintegrated.

This was a collection of immense physical power.

If he had swung it as is, he would have been able to destroy the solar system and still have enough power left over.

But he didn't retreat, and instead drew his sword.

He swung his sword towards the wall that was about to crush him.

His sword and the world-destroying giant's arm met. Comparing their sizes, there was only a slight difference between a human and him.

Kua kua kua!

But he didn't yield.

Taihan didn't back down even a step and countered the world-destroying giant. No.

Tzhe tzhe tzhe!

No, he was actually pushing the world-destroying giant back, bit by bit.

Taihan infused strength into his sword.

His authority, controlled by physical power, focused and swung.

Tzhee!

The world-destroying giant's body shook. Taihan was also pushed back. His body was about to be repelled at incredible speed.

Kaga kaga!

Note: The translation may not be perfect due to the complex and poetic nature of the original text.
Despite enduring, he utilizes his own physical strength to counteract the force that has been inflicted upon him, making it zero.

It's not my fault.

"Hmm..."

The great mountain waves its sword. After feeling the sense of exhaustion and depletion of power from a single collision, it reaches a conclusion.

"It's feasible."
