Chapter 577

577. Confirmation (1)

The magician who appeared by dividing the space gazed at Taesan.

And he let out a hollow laugh.

"I can't read it. Completely."

He couldn't grasp Taesan.

It was the same as before. The distorted Taesan didn't receive the transcendent's gaze properly.

But now, it felt different from back then.

It wasn't just distorted and unreadable, but it had reached a higher level where it was unreadable in a true sense.

Arirnan also laughed.

[You're definitely stronger than me. There's no one who can rival you among the existences in the universe.]

Arirnan handed over a significant portion of her concept of circulation to Taesan. She had become weaker than before.

However, even so, she was the goddess who governed the concept of circulation.

No ordinary transcendent could reach her. Even if it was a top-tier transcendent like Lakiratas, it was impossible.

Even she, however, couldn't win against Taesan.

That was a definite fact.

[How do you feel?]

"I don't know either."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan replied calmly. The wizard slowly bowed his head.

"First of all... should I congratulate you or thank you?"

He was extremely polite, treating Taesan with the same respect as he would a hero.

"Thanks to you, the universe was saved from destruction. I'm truly grateful."

If Taesan had lost, the usurper would have devoured him and become complete, emerging from the crack in the universe.

Then, at that moment, the balance would have been broken. There would have been no transcendent being who could defeat the usurper, who possessed immense power. They would have all been devoured by the usurper, and the concept of the universe itself might have disappeared.

Taesan had saved the universe.

It was no exaggeration to say so.

[To be honest, I also thought it was impossible, but he came back victorious.]

Arilnan's tone was one of newfound respect. He knew that the usurper could also devour gods, but he hadn't expected it to devour multiple ones. Considering the level of power and authority it had reached, it was almost impossible for Taesan to win.

But Taesan had won.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I won, and I swallowed the usurper whole, and I was here.

Taesan replied calmly.

"The usurper was a strong one, after all."

Strong from the start.

On the other hand, you could say that's all there is to existence.

Of course, the usurper took power by force and made it their own, but fundamentally, they were someone who wielded power. They didn't start weak and build up to become strong.

That difference decided victory and defeat.

"By the way, the fact that you're all here..."

Taesan looked at the wizard and Arirnan.

"That means we've got some leeway, doesn't it?"

Two strong individuals didn't confront the usurper, and instead were with Taesan.

If we didn't have that leeway, it would have been impossible. The wizard stroked his chin with a puzzled expression.

"That's what I mean. It's gotten a bit complicated."

[You must have felt it too. The presence of the usurpers has disappeared.]

"Did they simply hide their tracks, or did they really disappear?"

[That's right.]

It was like before.

The usurpers hid their bodies in the universe."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was after I precisely defeated the usurper and escaped from the crack. Suddenly, they stopped fighting and left. I thought about pursuing them, but I didn't have the luxury to do so."

"Are they retreating?"

"It seems like it, but it's hard to say."

The high priests couldn't defeat Taesan. If they attacked simultaneously, there might be a chance, but the transcenders wouldn't just stand by and watch.

In the end, Taesan and the transcenders had to be faced at the same time, but the high priests didn't have the power to do so.

Even if they remained in the universe, all they could expect was annihilation.

"Did they return to their own territory?"

"It seems like it, but... we can't be certain yet."

Verification was necessary.

But one thing was certain.

The fact that they had won.

"We won."

They had won the war against the high priests. The magician's face was filled with joy and delight. Arirnan wasn't much different either.

"There's still something we need to confirm. We'll talk about the details later."

[We have a lot to discuss among ourselves, anyway. It's a lot.]

"Anyway, it was also for my benefit, so it doesn't matter."

Taesan replied so. Arirnan smiled faintly.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$"[What a downright response,] it seems."

Along with that, the magician and Arilnan left.

Only then did Bardrey seem to realize.

[“It's true... I won.”]

"We won."

[“I can hardly believe it.”]

Honestly, Bardrey himself had also been thinking of defeat. But Tae-san, having perfectly mastered his strength and won, had ascended to a higher level.

Just how high a level Tae-san has reached.

Even Bardrey, who wields the Bardelei, couldn't tell.

[“You are truly a monster.”]

Bardrey came to realize this anew.

"Is there anything new?"

[“Indeed, there is.”]

Tae-san also had much to check. Having struck down the looter, he had obtained immense power.

"There is much to do."

The stories of Amelia and Eita-yeon, and the stories to come about the Earth.

But before that, there was a need to confirm what he had obtained.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Transcendence: Shattered Aspiration] [Proficiency: 100%] [One who desires and dreams, but ultimately reaches a shattered existence. You can achieve your aspirations, but the result will be distorted. However, if you truly desire it, you can achieve your aspiration perfectly, just once.]

Shattered aspiration. The power of the usurper. It has now reached 100% and become a perfect power.

And the content has also changed.

"Can I achieve a perfect aspiration just once?"

The power is indeed powerful, and its effect exceeds the bounds of understanding.

A perfect aspiration.

Now, what is it that he desires?

Taesan pondered for a moment, then shook his head. Since it's not yet perfectly organized, there's no need to worry about it now.

And the proficiency of the treasure box has also reached 100%.

[Transcendence: Treasure Box] [Proficiency: 100%] [You can store what you've usurped in the treasure box and take it out if you desire it.]

The content of the treasure box hasn't changed much.

But the size of the treasure box has become enormous.

It's said to be able to hold everything, in the truest sense of the word.

If you desire it, you could even put the entire universe inside. This is the true treasure box.

"[Transcendence: Soul Domination] [Proficiency: 100%] [The soul has reached a higher world. A high-dimensional soul takes everything from its opponent whenever it wins. You can dominate the opponent's soul and make it your own.]

“……For a moment.”

Taesan stopped after reading the explanation.

Nothing had changed much. Only a few words had been added or deleted.

But those few words had raised the skill's effect to an unimaginable level.

A high-dimensional soul takes everything from its opponent whenever it wins.

The skill's description meant that it would take everything in the truest sense.

Not only the opponent's power and level, but also the concepts and experiences they had built up. It could dominate all of those.

And that wasn't all.

You could dominate the opponent's soul and make it your own.

The part that said "temporarily" had been deleted.

It meant that permanent domination was possible even in the midst of battle, without being defeated.

“Ridiculous.”

The level was too high, and it was hard to comprehend.

And Taesan was a Dominator, someone who had dominated the concept and level of a Dominator itself.

[Dominator] [One who dominates. Only they know what they desire.]

The concept and level of a Dominator, its power..."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It had become a part of Taesan itself. It had merged with him completely and become one with him.

Just looking at it up to this point was enough. Taesan had become incomparably stronger than before.

But it didn't end there.

A plunderer is one who plunders. They plunder numerous powers and concepts, making them their own.

And Taesan also plundered power.

The two overlapped, and Taesan acquired the authority of numerous divine powers.

The first of these was the Shape Changer.

[Transcendence: Shape Changer] [Proficiency: 99%] [A changer of forms. Can change into anything. Can also possess the most suitable concept and power for the changed form.]

Shape Changer. It was a form that could change, just like the plunderer had used.

It could change into a form smaller than dust, at the atomic level, or into something enormous.

And it could also possess the power most suitable for that form.

If used correctly, it could perfectly target weaknesses, just like the plunderer had done to Taesan.

"Is it 99%?"

It wasn't 100% because Taesan had plundered what the plunderer had plundered, but it was close.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But it didn't matter much. To Taesan, it wasn't a significant event.

[Transcendence: The collection of all things that defy the laws of physics] [Proficiency: 99%] [The collection of all things that cannot be materialized. What it touches corrupts, contaminates, and taints.]

It seemed to be the power of the merged gods, but even Taesan didn't know the exact effect.

Then, let's try it out directly.

Taesan raised his finger.

And there, something filthy gathered.

[Huh?] [Master?]

Bardley and Akasha were shocked.

Their instincts told them.

That thing could corrupt all living things.

Even a small part of it, scattered throughout the universe, would taint everything it touched, making it impossible for life to exist, let alone anything else in this world. That was the kind of power it held.

"Is this it?"

Taesan clenched his fist and erased the filthy thing. He seemed to know roughly how to handle it.

And that power wasn't the only one.

[Transcendence: The one who can manipulate the universe] [Proficiency: 99%] [Can move the concept itself.]

"The explanation of the authority ended in one sentence. Taesan, who had been reading the explanation, scrunched up his face.

"What the...".

The idea that he could control the universe was unimaginable.

Taesan clenched his fist for a moment.

And then lowered it.

At the same time, the universe slightly trembled.

To be exact, Taesan had touched the concept of waves that existed in the universe. As a result, the concept of waves itself began to fluctuate according to Taesan's will.

"Is this it?"

[What are you doing right now?]

Bardley's hair stood on end.

Taesan had just touched the entire universe in a true sense.

"Confirmation of authority. These are really monstrous things."

There were still more to confirm, but each one was too enormous. He wanted to take a break and confirm them one by one.

Taesan put off the remaining authorities and confirmed another thing he had obtained.

The usurper was the owner of the heavenly rift.

And that was not all.

The replicated labyrinths.

He was also their owner.

Now, the ownership of that labyrinth had been transferred from the usurper to Taesan."
