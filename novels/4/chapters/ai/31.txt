Episode 32

32. 4th Floor (1)

He obtained three skills at once. It was also a first for Taesan. He began checking the skills.

[Special Passive Skill: Craving for Battle] [Proficiency: 1%] [When facing challenging or impossible foes, you feel joy. Everything about you improves.]

"Is this a skill specifically for formidable enemies?"

The description was just like that.

If it's around the average level, he thought he could use it a lot.

Since challenging or impossible foes appeared very frequently here.

[Special Passive Skill: Craving for Victory] [Proficiency: 1%] [When you triumph over challenging or impossible foes, you gain greater rewards.]

"Huh."

A skill directly connected to rewards itself? It was also a first for Taesan to see such a skill. Taesan checked the details.

The effect is additional rewards when triumphing over formidable enemies.

He didn't know the exact feeling, but it seemed quite useful like Craving for Battle.

And now, the last one. Scorn of the Mighty.
[Special Active Skill: Scorn of the Mighty] [Mana Cost: 1] [Proficiency: 1%] [When facing challenging or impossible foes, you can receive a judgment bonus.]

"Huh...."

Taesan pondered, trying to confirm its effects.

"Does this mean I get an additional judgment bonus against formidable foes?"

If so, it was quite a valuable skill. The increase in judgment bonus was significant. The reason he could defeat the Road this time was because all his stats had increased due to the judgment bonus.

Being able to receive that bonus twice would greatly aid him when facing formidable enemies.

The victory rewards were quite satisfying. Now, it was time to check the other rewards.

[Your level has increased.] [As a level-up reward, your health has increased by 25.] [As a level-up reward, your strength has permanently increased by 4. Your agility has permanently increased by 4. Your mana has permanently increased by 4.] [Your level has increased.] [You have reached the peak condition.] [As a level-up reward, your health has increased by 30.] [As a level-up reward, your strength has permanently increased by 5. Your agility has permanently increased by 6. Your mana has permanently increased by 5.]
I leveled up twice. Usually, even the toughest enemies are done after one round. It was a stark reminder of what level of monster the Road was. Even recalling it now, it's truly mind-blowing.

If I had made even a slight mistake, he would've died. If the Road's legs were intact, Taesan would have fled without even considering a fight. He wasn't looking to challenge himself, but definitely not to commit suicide.

That's how strong he was.

And the boost in vigor.

[Your vigor has been activated. Your strength has permanently increased by 7. Your health has permanently increased by 30. Your mana has permanently increased by 10.]

It was a simple yet definite boost. And vigor isn't just a skill that steals stats. Taesan checked the rest of the system window.

[Your vigor has been activated. Proficiency in Breathless Attack increases by 6%.] [Your vigor has been activated. You have gained the special activation skill [Strong Attack].]

Taesan's pupils dilated.

"Did I get a skill too? What kind of skill is this?"

It was truly beyond his imagination. He had thought vigor boosts were good, but if they also brought skills, he needed to adjust his thinking a bit.

"Utterly dominant."

Even considering all the skills together, it could confidently be the ultimate skill.
That was a vigor increase. At this level, it could be considered a skill above multiplication.

Just thinking about the effort and risks one had to overcome to obtain skills, this alone was on the level of a main skill.

Taesan confirmed the vigor while whistling.

[Special Activation Skill: Strong Attack] [Mana Cost: ?] [Proficiency: 1%] [Next attack hits harder.]

There was no mention of mana consumption. The description was concise. However, Strong Attack was a good skill that even hard mode players used until the end.

The effect was simple. Additional damage was dealt proportionally to the mana used for the skill. As proficiency increased, mana consumption decreased, and the damage increased exponentially with each skill use.

It was a skill favored by other players for its ability to pack a lot into a single blow.

However, Taesan was a beginner mode player with low base attack power, so this skill had been discarded as useless.

Unlike multiplication, which simply doubled attack power, this skill judged damage upon attacking, leaving no way to utilize it.
Moreover, he had too many skills, so using Strong Attack felt quite wasteful of mana.

But now, things were different.

He could use it very effectively.

And there was also the equipment that dropped. It was a necklace adorned with beast fangs.

[Necklace for the Owner] [Attack +3] [Defense +3] [Strength +3] [Agility +3] [Intelligence +3] [A necklace made by goblins who prayed for three days for their master. It is imbued with spiritual power.]

"Ha."

Taesan chuckled satisfactorily.

The stats on the necklace were unbelievable to believe.

Even though it boosted stats, to have Attack and Defense as well. Currently, it was his highest defense in the entirety of the equipment he was wearing.

Taesan swapped out the necklace. An attack +2 necklace wasn did much even if had even his did Meaning even in has
At a glance, the overall increase was substantial. At this rate, he would reach the stats he had when he cleared Easy Mode on the 5th floor.

And it didn't end there. Taesan also gained a skill he hadn't expected.

"You already got Acceleration?"

Acceleration towards the enemy. The explanation was simple. In dungeons, skills with brief descriptions often proved to be powerful. Acceleration was one such skill.

Once the determination to run towards the object was resolved, he would move at speeds well above his usual pace. Given its relatively lenient criteria, it could be used in most situations. Once proficiency reached 100%, he would even gain access to his preferred skill, Super Acceleration.

"I thought I'd have to work hard to get this."
Using the skill's effects in a similar manner was one of the ways to acquire it. To obtain Acceleration, one had to attempt various potions, conditions, and situations. Despite all efforts, the likelihood of acquiring Acceleration was low.

Perhaps it was obtained due to receiving an improbable victory judgment against an impossible foe. It was an unexpected harvest.

Taesan concluded with a satisfied expression.

He instantly became stronger. Risk and return were definite. It was worth investing sufficiently.

"So this is the answer."

"You..."

The ghost spoke softly. Taesan grinned at the different demeanor.

"Why is that?"

"Oh, it's nothing."

The ghost shook its head faintly, then spoke forcefully with forced enthusiasm.

"Are we going down now?"

"Before that, I have to go to Rakiratas."

Though it was strange, Taesan didn't inquire further. He ascended to the second floor and arrived at Rakiratas' altar.

Crimson mist gathered. Something transcendental appeared beyond the altar.

"Hmm."

The ghost momentarily flinched. It hid behind Taesan as if concealing itself. Rakiratas seemed indifferent to such a ghost, as it displayed a system window.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You have passed Rakiratas's trial. According to Rakiratas's evaluation, you will be rewarded. Rakiratas is greatly pleased with your struggle and wishes to give you a fitting reward."

Taesan glanced at the system window with a blank expression.

"Rakiratas must have known about the Goblin Lord hidden on the third floor. It's likely Rakiratas gave you this trial because he wanted to see the fight between the Lord and Taesan."

A fight for life. Strategy, talent, skill, and luck. A bloody battle that encompassed all of these.

Struggle and death. Rakiratas was clearly asserting his domain.

"Rakiratas offers you a Apostle's Contract."

"I decline."

He promptly refused. The ghost protested.

"Wait."

"What is it?"

"If Rakiratas..."

"It doesn't matter."

The presence beyond the space seemed rather amused.

"... "

The ghost fell silent.

"Rakiratas's interference area has decreased. Rakiratas rewards you. You have received [Protection]. You have acquired the special skill [Increase Protection] for constant activation."

"Protection?"

It seemed to be a reward related to stats. Taesan opened the status window to confirm.

"Hmm?"
Here is the translation of the text:

\[Gang Taesan\] \[Level: 12\] \[Protection: 10/10\] \[Health: 430/430\] \[Mana: 75/75\]

An additional section labeled "Protection" appeared above his health.

"Ghost?"

"I don't know either. It seems to be a stat I've never seen before."

It seemed likely to be a reward only Rakiratas could give. Taesan also checked the skill he had acquired.

\[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Increase Protection\] \[Proficiency: 1%\] \[You have gained a shielding Protection that blocks damage. The value of Protection increases proportionally with your health.\]

After reading the skill, Taesan scratched his chin.

A shielding Protection that blocks damage. Its value increases proportionally with health.

"It feels like a second health bar."

It seemed that health would deplete before the Protection, and if Protection reached zero, then health would diminish according to this system.

If Taesan's assumption was correct, this was a very useful skill.

Even if he didn't know the exact proportional value, the fact that health would increase was the same. No, it was better than that.

Protection was indicated in a completely different manner. It was not based on health judgment.

In other words, there was a moment where damage could be taken without health being affected.

"Could it really be possible?"

One possibility flashed through his mind.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

It's still within expectations, so I organize myself and look at the altar. As if everything had ended, the red mist was dissipating.

[Rakiratas looks forward to the next encounter.]

The mist clears. Only the altar for worshipping the gods remains there.

[Phew!]

A ghost breathes out belatedly. Rakiratas was tense from the moment he projected his presence.

"Damn. Didn't expect you to be nervous even in such a state."

"Why are you so scared? Doesn't seem like the kind to chicken out."

"You'd think differently if you knew what it was."

"I doubt it."

He had already seen similar things from outside.

Taesan descended sluggishly into the maze. He passed the 3rd floor and arrived at the 4th floor.

[Quest on the 4th floor starts.] [Defeat the boss on the 4th floor and proceed.] [Reward: Ashen Wrist Guards.] [Secret Reward: ???]

The reward on the 4th floor was equipment. Ashen Wrist Guards. Considering the rewards given so far, it seemed like quite useful gear. Taesan realized belatedly about the secret reward.

"Haven't used the reward yet."

The secret reward from the 3rd floor ???
Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

By catching up with the rewards that had not been obtained, Taesan began to check belatedly. He had completely forgotten due to handling too many rewards.

"[You used ???.] [Received Skill Proficiency Increase Potion.]"

"Huh?"

Taesan was taken aback by the potion he had never imagined.

[Skill Proficiency Increase Potion] [Increases proficiency of one skill by 5%.]

"Really."

To increase proficiency. It was an explanation he had never seen before. As proficiency is obtained only through endless use and practice, it was bewilderingly conventional.

But looking at the reward itself, it was excellent.

A whopping 5%.

Considering that it takes days of grinding just to raise this 5% for top-tier skills, it was very good.

For now, he postponed it. Finding and using a suitable skill was more beneficial than using it immediately.

Taesan put the potion in his inventory and headed towards the room.

Inside, a dwarf was waiting.

"You came?"

"I did."

The dwarf's face lit up with admiration as he glanced at Taesan for a moment.

"A shield? Rakiratas gave that too? He's really generous."

"Do you see it?"

"It's on top of your head, of course."
Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

In the labyrinth, it seemed to the dwarf that Taesan's condition was visible, whether NPCs possessed such abilities or related skills.

"It looks like you've managed to barely win. Did you enjoy it?"

"I suppose I'm somewhat satisfied."

"Is that so? That's something, at least."

The dwarf spoke expressionlessly.

"There's nothing as tough as facing a satisfying death here. Like the one behind you."
