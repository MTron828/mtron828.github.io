**Chapter 591**

**591. The Outer Story, Mashin (3)**

The Great Demon King, the ruler of all demons and one of the high gods.

The red reptile's eyes gaze at the Taesan.

[... Amazing.]

Ba'al murmured, seemingly interested.

[Can't read it.]

Ba'al, a high god who existed since the beginning of time, couldn't read something that didn't exist.

That was until now.

But one thing was certain.

Strong.

Strong enough to call himself a high god. It was unbelievable that such an existence could be.

[Are you here to conquer this place?]

"Then?"

Ba'al smiled wryly.

[It's my role to block intruders, but... it seems meaningless. I hope you won't do that.]

The fight itself wouldn't be established. That was Ba'al's conclusion.

Taesan replied calmly.

"Don't worry. I don't plan to fight."

[That's a relief.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ba'al was genuinely relieved. He didn't think about lying. There was no reason for a being of his level to tell a lie. He relaxed and asked casually.

[Then, what brought you to the demon world?]

"Travel."

[Travel?]

Ba'al laughed pleasantly.

[Travel, you say? What's the purpose of that?]

"Do I really need to answer that?"

[There's no need to. You can't trust me anyway.]

Taesan, who had been gazing at Ba'al, spoke.

"You're not hostile towards me or afraid of me."

[That's because it's meaningless to be hostile towards someone as strong as you.]

"It doesn't seem that simple, though."

There was only curiosity and joy in Ba'al's eyes. Not a single speck of hostility or fear could be found.

[Well... other high-ranking demons would be afraid of you or try to fight you, but I'm not really interested in that.]

'Are you a high-ranking demon here too?'

The basic terminology wasn't much different from the current one. Ba'al spoke with a tone filled with amusement.

[You're the same, though.]

Taesan was also not showing any hostility.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It doesn't seem like our existence is visible. If we had to insist, it's as if we're getting closer to the universe. The beings of the universe despise and want to kill us. But I don't see that kind of atmosphere from you."

The reptilian eyes gaze at me like they're licking the Taesan mountain.

"[...I even sense a familiar, affectionate atmosphere, as if you know me.]"

"I'm also special, just like you."

"[It's amusing.]"

Ba'al chuckles and laughs.

"[It's pleasing. You're a great, extraordinary being. How about we have a deep conversation, just the two of us?]"

Taesan nodded, and Ba'al laughed joyfully, clapping his hands.

And then, the space is flipped upside down.

Taesan arrived at the center of a massive castle.

"[This is my own castle, created just for me by the demon god. It's the first time I've invited someone.]"

Demon god. But it's not Lucifer. Maybe it's referring to the old demon god.

Taesan sat down on the chair created by Ba'al. Ba'al personally poured tea into a cup.

"[It's a byproduct of the universe. Other demon gods despise it as a crude organic matter, but it's not bad, so I'm enjoying it.]"

Ba'al sat down across from Taesan.

"[Then, let's have a conversation. I've always been curious. What do the beings of the universe, especially the transcendents, think about us?]"

"I don't know."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[……Don't you know?]

"I've never met another transcendent being like myself."

[Ah.]

Ba'al nodded his head as if he had realized something.

[They're beings close to the universe, but they don't seem to have any particular connection to us. I suppose I should explain.]

Ba'al picked up his teacup.

"You people hate and despise us."

Goshin.

They were eternal beings that had existed since before the creation of the universe.

From the universe's perspective, they were nothing but foreign substances.

[And I think that hatred is justified. You people develop and move forward, bringing about change.]

The decoration on the teacup was beautiful. The aroma of the tea was also very pleasant, and it seemed like it would be difficult to make with ordinary effort.

[But we're just beings that can't be destroyed or broken. It's hard to even say we're alive. We're just strong, and that's why we defile, trample, and crush you people.]

Goshin was eternal and couldn't die.

"What do you think about our existence?"

"I don't know."

Taesan replied indifferently.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You guys have your own values, I guess. As long as you don't bother me, I don't care."

Taesan didn't have any particular thoughts about the existence of Goshin. They were just threatening the Earth and opposing Taesan, that's all.

Taesan's response seemed to please Baal, whose eyes twinkled.

[You're definitely unusual. What's your name?]

"Kang Taesan."

[So, Kang Taesan. I'm Baal, the title of the Great Devil. I came here to travel. How about we make a deal? Can you tell me a story?]

"What kind of story?"

[What you've built up and what hardships you've overcome.]

Baal said with a curious expression.

[Then I'll show you something that will make your travels enjoyable.]

There was no reason to refuse. After all, future Baal already knew everything. Taesan mixed in some embellishments and explained to Baal.

Baal, who had been listening quietly, muttered to himself.

[The direction is different, but you're the same.]

"What do you mean?"

[A weak and young existence risked their life and struggled. They dedicated themselves to life and eventually brought about change. I'm envious.]

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Although his voice was calm, it was filled with emotion. Baal stood up from his seat.

[I'll give you a good reward for listening well.]

Baal grasped the air, and the space tore apart, revealing a different location in the demon world.

[Follow me. I'll show you my own playground.]

* * *

Baal and Taesan walked through the demon world.

They headed towards the outskirts of the demon world, a place where no one had ever been.

"Where are we going?"

[Here, demons are livestock.]

It wasn't an empty phrase or a joke. Demons were literally livestock.

[They don't have language, and their intelligence is no different. They're no better than animals.]

Baal snapped his fingers. The disguise that had been set up in front of him slowly began to dissolve.

[But can they really not develop like humans? I'm curious about that personally.]

Baal's unfolded disguise dissolved, revealing what was beyond.

What was there was a small village.

[My small playground.]

What could be seen was hundreds of demons.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They were living in a small village, cultivating the land, building houses, and raising families. There were old people, young people, and even newborn babies. Each of them had their own work to do, and they were all contributing to the village. Then, Baal approached them.

"Ah!"

"Lord Savior, it's been years since you've come!"

The villagers welcomed Baal with faces full of faith and trust.

[Yes, is everyone doing well?]

"Yes, look!"

A boy waved his hand, and at the end of it, a dark energy burst forth.

Taesan could sense what it was.

It was a dark magic spell using demonic energy.

The boy said with a confident face, "I'm not as strong as the village head yet, but I'm getting stronger! With this, I'll defeat our enemies and save our people!"

In front of Baal, the boy was saying he would take on the gods.

Baal responded with a laugh.

[Keep it up. Someday you'll achieve your goal.]

"Yes!"

The boy said with determination.

The others who followed him also flocked to Baal, seeking his praise. They looked like well-trained puppies. Baal responded to each of them individually.

After a while, they finally noticed Taesan.

"That person is......"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"My colleague."

"Wow! The colleague of the Savior!"

"Wow wow!"

Envious gazes are directed at Taesan. Baal calmed them down.

[Calming down, can I get out of the way? I haven't seen the village chief's face in a long time.]

"Ah, yes yes!"

"I'm sorry!"

The demons quickly got out of the way. Baal walked with Taesan through the village.

"What did you do."

[It's just a simple hobby.]

Baal smiled slightly.

[Demons are livestock. They don't have complete intelligence or their own language. But after dissecting their corpses, I found that there's no significant structural difference from humans. Then, can't they also evolve and move forward?]

They learn languages, build strength, and accumulate knowledge.

[A very long time ago, I brought several dozen demons here. They didn't accomplish anything and grew old and died. After that, I brought several dozen more. They lived here, inheriting the legacy of the previous demons.]

Life doesn't die with bare hands. They leave behind their legacy.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I also intervened appropriately. The magic they wield is one example. After repeating the process tens of thousands of times, they somehow created their own language and culture."

This place was a small civilization created by Baal.

"After that, it was relatively stable. There were hundreds of instances of destruction, and they lost their language many times, but somehow it was maintained."

"The scale is different."

It was as if I had artificially created a civilization, a species. But there was a question.

"Why did I do this?"

Baal is a god. Whether the demon tribe is domesticated or gains intelligence, it means nothing to him.

"It's just a simple hobby. Nothing more."

Baal said lazily.

They arrived at the largest building. As they entered, a man was sitting inside.

"I've been waiting. Savior."

"Ah, it's been ten years. The village must have been well-managed."

"The Savior directly ordered it, so it's not like that. Besides, they're my kin. If I don't lead them, who will?"

The man bowed his head respectfully.

"He's strong."

The man was quite strong.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's just the tip of the iceberg, but it's reached an immortal level. The fact that it's like this in this small space means that the man's talent is considerable. The man glanced at the towering mountain."

"Is the person next to you...?"

[My colleague.]

"Ah, a colleague of the Savior... Nice to meet you for the first time. It's nice to meet you."

[Yeah, looks like you're doing well. Not bad.]

"Yes, and... the time has finally come."

[......]

At the man's words, Baal scowled.

[Are you really going to do it?]

"I have no intention of backing down."

The man declared boldly.

"I will liberate my fellow tribesmen and conquer the demon world that we should have ruled from the start!"
