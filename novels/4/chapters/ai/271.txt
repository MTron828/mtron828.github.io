**Episode 272**

272. 61st Floor, The Test Site (3)

"First, a reward."

[You have passed the first test.]

Beldekia threw a potion to Taesan.

[You have obtained a [High-Grade Strength Boost Potion].] [High-Grade Strength Boost Potion] [Permanently increases strength by 200.]

Strength +200.

It was a pretty good reward. Unlike equipment, the fact that it was permanent was a significant advantage.

"Not bad."

"A 10-level reward, so it's worth it. If you pass the test, you'll get even better rewards."

Beldekia tapped the floor with her staff, and a small magic circle appeared, summoning a wine bottle and a dried persimmon.

"First... I'm curious about you."

Beldekia asked, tilting the wine bottle.

"A adventurer who has come to this place after 100 years. What do you want, and how did you end up here?"

Taesan's background.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"There was no need to hide it, so Taesan spoke straightforwardly. About the Earth. And about the ancient gods who invaded it. And about how they were invited to the labyrinth.

Of course, he hid the fact that he had separated from the labyrinth and returned to the past. Nevertheless, Beldechia was fascinated by the fact that the entire Earth had been invited, and listened with a serious expression.

It was a long story. Whenever Taesan told stories related to the trials of the gods, Beldechia asked this and that.

Taesan answered what he could, and didn't answer what he couldn't.

By the time the story ended, a whole day had passed.

"The ancient gods did something like that, huh."

Beldechia muttered, shaking an empty wine bottle.

"I didn't know what was happening outside, but it seems that's what happened. Fascinating. Are they trying to take over the world in earnest?"

[It's a story that has nothing to do with you, anyway.]

"Hmm... that's true."

Beldechia smiled wryly.

He was a being bound to the labyrinth. Now, whatever happened outside had nothing to do with him."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"The most interesting thing is that all beings in the world have entered the labyrinth. It's fun. The possibility of them reaching this point is... probably zero."

"Some may be able to reach it, but... the probability is high, I suppose."

Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk are those who have a clear possibility of clearing it. They're currently stuck on the 20th floor, but if they keep trying, they might be able to clear it someday.

But the problem was the rest.

Most solo mode players hadn't even passed the 10th floor yet.

Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk didn't know if the others could survive and clear the solo mode. Even if Taesan helped them, it was difficult.

What did they need to do to survive?

Taesan was deep in thought, and Beldekiya laughed.

"You're different from me. You're so kind, just like her."

"Her?"

Beldekiya didn't answer and stood up instead.

"A day has passed. Will we receive the next test?"

"Yes."

Taesan nodded, and Beldekiya asked with a faint smile.

"What will you use this time?"

"Black magic."

"Of course, the difficulty level is 10, right?"

"Yes."

"Good."

[All abilities except black magic were sealed.]

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Belldeckia drew a magic circle. A gigantic monster burst out of it.

[Roar!]

It was as large as a giant from mythology.

The giant swung its arm, which was as thick as a house. The power it contained was stronger than a mountain.

The mountain trembled.

Whoa!

Belldeckia avoided the swinging arm. She couldn't help but gasp in shock.

Although she could only use dark magic, Taesan was not backing down.

And the subsequent spectacle made Belldeckia even more astonished.

[You activated Mephisto's black lightning.]

Rumble!

The lightning pierced the giant. Without missing the moment the giant's movement paused, she linked her dark magic.

[You activated Eligos' rose thorn.]

The rose thorn fell and bound the giant's movement.

[You activated Marbas' dark wave.]

A dark wave surged up, swallowing the giant. Although the giant tried to smash it with its fist, the wave laughed and swept the giant away.

As the giant struggled to get up, unable to withstand the wave, Taesan opened a portal.

Belldeckia's eyes widened in surprise.

"Impossible!"

Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You've activated the golden sword of Naberies.]

The golden sword materializes.

"What the...".

Beldentia laughs mockingly at the overwhelming power. She knew that Taesan possessed black magic, but she didn't know its extent.

However, she didn't think it was that impressive. Black magic is a power that can only be obtained with the permission of the demon god. It's surprising that a human was able to acquire it, but compared to the demon race, it's still insignificant.

But that...

Belentia could sense it. That's a power equivalent to intermediate-level magic, which even the demon god's favorites don't easily grant.

In other words, the human in front of her is more favored by the demon god than the demon race.

Whoosh!

The light collides with the giant, sending it flying.

Belentia laughed, a satisfied smile.

"With this kind of power..."

It might be possible. He might achieve his wishes.

His fingernails dug into his palm. He watched the battle unfold. The giant continued to resist, but it soon fell.

Whoosh!

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"The mountain landed on the ground. His body had no wounds.

Beldengkia greeted him with a laugh.

[Naberius's golden sword proficiency increased by 1%.] [Mephisto's black sword proficiency increased by 1%.] [Eligos's rose thorn proficiency increased by 1%.] [You passed the second test.] [Obtained the "Elixir of Advanced Magic Ascension"].]

"The Elixir of Advanced Magic Ascension" [Permanently increases magic by 100.]

A significant increase in magic. It was a considerable boost, considering his magic was still only at 600.

"Good job."

Taesan was satisfied and used the potion.

Beldengkia sat down again and pulled out a bottle and some snacks from the ground.

"Let's have another round of stories."

* * *

But this storytelling session ended quickly. Taesan had already told all his stories.

"Brave warrior, will you tell a story?"

[Why should I?]

The warrior refused. Beldengkia laughed as if she had been waiting for this.

"Then should I tell a story?"

"Weren't you aiming for that all along?"

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"From the moment Bel Deniz started talking, he seemed to want to tell his own story.

Bel Deniz burst out laughing.

"As expected, I've been found out. Sorry, I need you to listen to my story for my own purposes."

"I was curious too, so go ahead and tell me."

The NPCs settled into the labyrinth, each with their own wishes.

Lilith wanted the magic seed, and the warrior wanted revenge.

What does Bel Deniz want?

Bel Deniz spoke while drinking alcohol.

"What I want is the guy in charge of the labyrinth's store. Similar to that dwarf, the one deep inside."

"Isn't that possible with your abilities?"

Although I don't know Bel Deniz's exact level, he could easily surpass the 80th floor, and maybe even reach the 90th floor.

It would be faster for him to do it himself rather than asking Taesan for help.

"No."

But Bel Deniz denied it.

"I can't do it. I'm impossible."

He laughed as if he was crying.

"So... I need you."

The laughter stopped abruptly.

He opened his mouth with a dumbfounded expression."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"Hermodia. A beautiful world where magic once shone brightly.

This is the story before Beltenkia entered the labyrinth. It's a memory that's been forgotten for thousands of years.

"But it was a world that was slowly dying."

Plants wither, and the spring dries up. The sun loses its light, and black clouds cover the sky.

No one knew the reason. Their world was simply dying.

"I was the greatest magician there. I was young, but even those who had dedicated decades to magic kneeled before my talent. No one could match me. They said I could save the world, but... that was impossible, wasn't it?"

The world's destruction. Even the great Beltenkia, who was only mortal, couldn't solve the problem.

And Beltenkia herself didn't intend to solve it.

"The world was going to be destroyed, but it wouldn't happen until I died. Then it's none of my business, right? I just did what I wanted to do."

This appears to be a passage from a fantasy novel or story, possibly set in a world where magic exists. The protagonist, Beltenkia, is a powerful magician who is aware of the world's impending doom but doesn't seem to be concerned about it.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I studied magic, experimented, and received recognition for my outstanding talent, so I didn't lack support. I lived as I pleased.

"It wasn't just me. The world was clearly going to ruin, but they could survive as long as their generation lasted. Luxury and indulgence filled the streets, but no one stopped them.

"They thought they were the end of the world. There were no descendants left.

That fact drove people mad.

Their world was like a city consumed by greed, as if from a myth.

"But... the princess was different."

The only bloodline of the empire, the only royalty who could inherit the dying world.

"She dragged me out of my room, where I was engrossed in research. Do you know what the princess said?

"Let's go save the world. You're a talented but reckless mage."

She said that with a bright smile, shaking her radiant golden hair and sparkling golden eyes.

It was as clear as yesterday. Verdencia laughed mockingly."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"It's a funny story, right? The princess was clearly strong, but she was still human. I was the same. But we said we'd save the world together, just the two of us. I mean, it was a ridiculous thing to say. Looking back, I was a silly woman.

As I said this, Belldegia's eyes were filled with longing and nostalgia. It seemed that the events of that time weren't entirely bad for Belldegia.

"I naturally refused, but... she followed me around all day, pestering me. She said let's do it together. So I got annoyed and said I'd do it if I found a way, and she brought me information about the labyrinth.

The labyrinth created by the wizards and gods. If we cleared it, we could have one wish granted.

For the gods, it would be easy to solve the problem of the world's destruction.

So they entered the labyrinth.

"The princess told me to protect her, even though I was dragged here against my will and was annoyed. She said we could achieve our wish if we worked together. I was annoyed. I didn't come here by choice, and I was forced to come, so what's the point of a wish? I didn't care if the world was destroyed or not. But since I'm here, I might as well do my best."

Belldegia laughed.

"It's been about 200 years, I'd say."

"He lived a life much longer than his life outside in the labyrinth. And he was not alone. He was always with the princess.

"The annoying girl had become the meaning of my life. I could die for her. I thought about that too. But... I couldn't do it."

Beldegia clenched her fists. The withered flowers in her hand turned to dust due to her grip strength. The mana that resonated with her emotions began to press down on the surroundings.

"I'm a coward. I couldn't do anything in front of an overwhelming presence. I buried my head in the ground and begged for my life. I... I can't do it."

Beldegia laughed.

"So, please help me."

She said to Taesan with a desperate but determined face.

"Please save the princess who is suffering in that deep place."

[Sub-quest begins] [The wizard who failed to save the princess. Beldegia wishes for the salvation of the princess whose soul is bound by the gods.] [Condition: God of Decline. Meet with Essence and make a deal with him.] [Reward: Beldegia and Essence will determine the reward based on your achievement.]
