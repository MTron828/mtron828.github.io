65. 10th Floor, Boss (3)

"I'm at 20%. In terms of stages, I'm at the first stage."

She boasted proudly and waved her hand. Flames erupted around her.

"As I mentioned earlier, even at this level, the quality of magic changes. But still, overall it's only 20%. And although you can learn all types of magic, being able to properly use them is limited to basic magic."

"Limitations?"

"Magic within the labyrinth is categorized into basic, elementary, intermediate, advanced, and supreme levels. There may be higher levels, but these are the five known stages."

Rilis patted her cheek.

"As much as the labyrinth allows, all types of magic can be used, but... the proficiency level determines how well you can use them. With 20%, you can harness the full power of basic magic, but you can only use half of elementary magic. As for intermediate and higher, you practically can't use them."

It seemed that the issue wasn't simply about learning, but rather about the proficiency required to effectively use the magic.

However, there was something she didn't quite understand.
"I'm at 2%, but I used intermediate magic."

"You can use up to intermediate to some extent. It gets strict starting from intermediate."

Rilis continued.

"At 40%, you can perfectly handle elementary magic. But I'm clumsy with intermediate. Advanced is out of the question. At 60%, you can perfectly handle intermediate, and at 80%, you can handle advanced perfectly. At 100%, it's supreme."

It was as she said, a progression. There were no restrictions on learning magic, but there were constraints on how well you could wield it.

"Then I'm around level 2."

"Yeah. Isn't that strange! Do you think it makes sense for an inexperienced person to suddenly be at level 2?"

She argued vehemently with a flushed face.

"This is an insult to those who walk the path of magic!"

She had dedicated her life to the labyrinth, yet she still felt powerless at 20%.

"Yawn. Hero. Say something too. Is this really possible?"

[Uh......]

The ghost said to the whining Rilis.
[It's not impossible if you pay the price.]

"Where is that crazy bastard? Even if an ordinary person sacrifices my life a hundred times, it wouldn't be enough."

"Isn't that usually the case? Usually."

"Tsk."

When the ghost's response was lukewarm, Rilis turned her head sharply.

The conversation ended. Rilis waved her hand.

"Well then, goodbye! Oh. Hero, is this the end for you?"

"Yes."

The ghost's quest extends to the 10th floor.

"See you later if we can meet."

"Sure."

The ghost replied calmly.

Taesan arrived once again in front of the boss room on the 10th floor.

Taesan made a decision.

---

"I'll use it for magic."

He realized that using it for magic was more valuable than other skills after listening to Rilis.

He didn't intend to use all of the 48%. It was 38%. He planned to use it up to exactly 40%.

[Using 380 points. Proficiency in magic skill increased by 38%.]

With a very brief explanation, something overwhelmed Taesan. A strange sensation unlike anything before flowed from within his body.
"You have acquired Magic Acceleration." "You have acquired Magic Explosion."

Taesan opened the skill window.

[Magic] [Proficiency: 40%] [You can handle magic properly. You seem capable of manipulating flames, controlling cold, and mastering the wind.]

There was a significant change in the sentence that could only handle sparks.

The way to do anything directly. Taesan spread his hands.

"You have activated the Burning Rift."

Flames burst into the air.

Its size was twice as large as when previously used.

"Oh."

Taesan muttered softly.

Not only had the power of magic increased, but the activation of magic had also changed.

Previously, there was a slight delay.

The implementation of magic felt like it was manifesting from the head to the body.

It wasn't a slow speed, but in a fierce fight where lives were at stake, there was undoubtedly a subtle delay that could make a clear difference.

But now, it just activated like water flowing. Magic was implemented simultaneously with thought.

"Is this at 40%?"

Honestly, this alone was valuable enough. It meant there were no constraints even when using magic alongside the body.
Of course, this wasn't going to be the end.

The fireball had grown immensely in size. Its power seemed to have increased accordingly. Moreover, the mana consumption was almost negligible.

The mana cost of Burning Rift was 6. Taesan's current mana was 235. It was a considerable expenditure.

However, just now, only 2 mana had been consumed.

It was known that mana consumption decreased with intelligence, but it hadn't been this dramatic.

Considering mana recovery as evidence of struggle, it was practically without constraint in mana usage.

On top of that, new skills were acquired.

[Magic Acceleration] [Proficiency: 1%] [Can accelerate magic.] [Magic Explosion] [Proficiency: 1%] [Can cause magic to explode.]

From the description, it was possible to guess what kind of skills they were.

Taesan launched a burning rift into the air towards the wall. Observing the burning rift flying towards the wall, he activated the skill.

"You have activated Magic Acceleration."

The burning rift accelerates.

It collides with the wall at a speed akin to that of a ship.

Kwaang!

The room trembles with a loud noise. Taesan expressed admiration.

"Both speed and power, they both feel enhanced."
"You have activated Frost Arrow."

This time, it's an explosion. Taesan cast a spell. After flying for a while, Taesan activated the skill.

"You have activated Magic Explosion."

Kwwoong!

The flying frost arrow exploded. Ice shards scattered in all directions like the beads of a claymore.

In an instant, the room filled with cold.

"This is quite good."

Taesan's eyes sparkled as he continued his experiments. After using magic about ten more times, he roughly grasped the situation.

He exclaimed, "It's quite impressive, isn't it?"

Magic Acceleration. Literally, it can accelerate during the use of magic.

Magic Explosion allows the magic to explode during its use. The mana consumption was zero.

At first glance, they might seem insignificant, but both were essential abilities when using magic.

So far, the magic Taesan had used couldn't be stopped. Once cast, the magic continued until it collided with something, and its speed remained the same.

The reason he hadn't used magic more powerful than a surprise attack against opponents above a certain level was precisely because of that.

It was too obvious.
"The speed remains unchanged and once implemented, it continues to fly.

It doesn't produce any effect until it collides with something.

Right now, Taesan had the confidence to fight as if his opponents couldn't use such magic.

However, this time he was able to solve all of those disadvantages.

Depending on the application, skills that handle magic entirely differently.

"I'm satisfied."

This is enough. Whether applied to the acceleration of skills, likely be. confirms had even if
"Though it's the most basic skill to learn, its importance was quite high. Taesan thought raising 'Insight' was more important than Ilak weaponry skills.

The use of points has ended. Taesan entered the boss room. A gigantic ogre roared towards him.

"Kwoooh!"

[Ogre Warrior has appeared.]

Taesan calmly thrust his sword.

[You activated Combustion Drive.] [You activated Magical Acceleration.]

The slowly flying magic accelerates. The ogre warrior flinches, trying to dodge, but it's too late.

[112 damage to Ogre Warrior.]

"Wow."

Taesan whistled. It was an incredible amount of damage.

"Kwoooh!"

[You activated Confusion.]

"Kuh, kwoo."

The ogre warrior momentarily staggers. But confusion is the most basic magic. Against an ogre warrior, it could easily be shrugged off.

Taesan added acceleration to it.

[You activated Magical Acceleration.]

"Kuh, kwooahk."

The staggering ogre falters. The strengthened magic roughs up the ogre's head. This time, it couldn't be easily defeated, clutching its head.

"It works on mental magic. Then, how about this?"
[You activated Magic Explosion.]

The ogre's body trembled slightly. Drool dripped from its gaping mouth.

"Gotcha."

Although it didn't affect its mental judgment, it seemed to shake its brain itself. This kind of judgment was more favorable to Taesan.

[You activated Confusion.]

"Kwoo...."

[Judgment Success!]

Perhaps due to its weakened state, this time the judgment succeeded immediately. The ogre's eyes glazed over.

It went as expected. Taesan smiled and continued to implement his magic.

[You activated Combustion Drive.] [You activated Frost Arrows.]

Countless fire orbs and ice arrows formed in the air. When their number reached double digits, Taesan launched them all at once.

"Kuh, kwoo."

The ogre, barely holding onto its shaking head, attempted to dodge. As the magic approached, Taesan clenched his fist.

[You activated Magic Explosion.]

A crimson explosion and ice bomb exploded like fireworks. The ogre's entire body froze and burned repeatedly.

"Kwooohhh!"
[Ogre Warrior took 86 damage.] [Ogre Warrior took 90 damage.] [Ogre Warrior took 78 damage.] [Ogre Warrior took 110 damage.] [You have defeated the Ogre Warrior.] [You have defeated the boss on the 10th floor. You obtained [Ogre Ring] as a basic reward.]

"Good."

Taesan muttered as he received the reward. It was convenient as he had expected. Despite having enough magic to dodge, the ogre couldn't do anything.

There was no need to move. At least until the 20th floor, he could arrive just by using magic.

The ghost calmly said.

"Magic is the axis here. It's a natural outcome since you've mastered it by 40%. As you know, it's absurd to increase your skills like this."

"Now, is everything organized?"

"Sort of."

The ghost's voice was confused when it saw the contains even perhaps ש even what even ל even in have even even our believe even hence even of to, even let
A voice filled with a complex tone echoed.

"[I mentioned that for Transcendents to interfere meaningfully, they too must expend something, didn't I?]"

"So that's why the interference zones of the gods here have diminished."

"Yeah. Even Transcendents entrenched in the labyrinth must pay a price to interfere within its confines. Let alone meddling in other worlds, which is even more severe. That's why they usually refrain from it. At most, they only lower themselves to a level of mere observation. It's what you might call madness."

Yet Earth was enduring such madness in real-time. Countless monsters trampled them and brought humanity to the brink of extinction.

[There exist beings capable of such feats. Entities who can interfere in the mortal realm without expending their power. Beings from the forgotten past, whose names are now lost.]
