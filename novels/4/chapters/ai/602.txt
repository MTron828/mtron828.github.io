Chapter 603

603. Extra Story, 1st Floor, Lee Tae-yeon (5)

Lee Tae-yeon, who had been sitting for a while, slowly got up.

She clenched her fists. Her body trembled. But this time, it wasn't because of fear.

She was a coward. She was afraid of many things, and death terrified her.

But that didn't mean she didn't know how to get angry.

"What did I do wrong?"

Her voice echoed loudly. Her face twisted with anger and hatred.

Everyone she met here mocked her, scorned her, and ridiculed her.

She couldn't bear those feelings.

She was forced into this peaceful world against her will. She was coerced into making a choice, not entering of her own free will. Yet, they scorned and ignored her.

They didn't even think about treating her with respect. But at the very least, couldn't they acknowledge her as a human being, as a living being?

"Can't you treat me like a person?"

Crack.

Her teeth gritted.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This place was only despair.

'...Yeah. That's right.'

Lee Tae-yeon smiled.

She had made up her mind.

She would feed them a bitter pill.

She would do it her own way, with her own weakness, and make them despise and mock her. She would use her own cowardice to clear the labyrinth.

Their precious justice and confidence, which they loved and cherished, would be thrown away like trash.

She was a coward. But she wasn't someone who would run away from everything. If she were, she wouldn't have been able to clear the labyrinth in the first place.

Lee Tae-yeon steeled herself.

* * *

Gulp.

[You have reached the optimal state.]

She took a deep breath and fell into thought.

'First, I need to catch the Big Rat.'

In the end, she had to catch the Big Rat to clear the labyrinth.

"It's scary."

She muttered to herself. She had steeled herself, but she was still human and hadn't changed. She had only gained the courage to clear the labyrinth, and she was still a coward. She wanted to avoid fighting as much as possible.

There was nothing special about clearing the labyrinth in her own way, as long as she achieved her goal."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But in the end, I had to catch Big Rat.

"Hmm."

I roll my head.

I recall Big Rat's movement and behavior patterns. And I check the skills she has.

"Will it work?"

After a while.

She grasped her sword. She slowly took a step out of the Fountain of Life.

And soon, her enemy appears.

"Kiik!"

[Big Rat appears.]

"...... Hello?"

She holds her sword with a trembling hand. Big Rat charges at her with a short scream.

"Kiik!"

"Whoa!"

I leap forward with a shout. Big Rat brushes past my leg.

"I can dodge it!"

Thanks to my agility increasing by 2, I can dodge Big Rat's attack without difficulty, unlike before.

I strike down with my sword. Big Rat quickly dodges.

Ka-boom!

"I'm not good enough to land a hit."

I'm still lacking.

I can hit her if I try, but I'd have to take a considerable risk.

I don't think that's a good idea.

"I hope things go back to normal."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She, who had been muttering to herself, suddenly charged towards Big Rat. Big Rat let out a short cry and recoiled, then counterattacked.

And at the moment they were about to collide.

[You activated combat evasion.]

Iteayeon felt a strange sensation.

Her body moved on its own, unrelated to her will. She moved her feet to narrowly avoid Big Rat's attack.

"Now!"

Iteayeon immediately swung her sword.

The sword struck Big Rat, who was flying towards her, with precision.

[Big Rat took 3 damage.]

"Kiiiiik!"

Big Rat let out a scream as it landed. Iteayeon's eyes shone with excitement.

"Did it!"

The combat evasion worked normally, and she could attack immediately.

Her calculations had been perfect.

"Kiiiiik!"

Enraged, Big Rat made a loud noise and charged towards Iteayeon. Iteayeon dodged and counterattacked, but her direction was not towards Big Rat.

"Kik?"

Big Rat was taken aback.

Iteayeon had turned her back and was running away.

"Kiiiiik!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The big rat, momentarily stunned, instinctively gave chase. It pursued the fleeing prey. The big rat was faster than Iteayeon. Before long, it could bite its ankle.

[You activated Escape.]

And Skill Activation.

Iteayeon's speed increased.

The big rat's teeth grazed the air.

Iteayeon, still accelerating, kicked the wall and used the momentum to strike the big rat with his sword.

Thud.

"Kiiik!"

[Dealt 3 damage to the big rat.]

Two successful attacks.

There was no time to rejoice. The enraged big rat charged. Iteayeon turned around and fled again.

And arrived at the Fountain of Life, closing the door behind him.

This was a kind of safe zone. The big rat couldn't enter here. That had already been confirmed.

Iteayeon quickly drank from the Fountain of Life.

[You are now in top condition.]

All consumed muscles and mana were fully recovered.

Iteayeon quickly opened the door.

[The big rat appeared.]

"Kiek?"

The big rat, which had been turning around, was startled. Iteayeon quickly charged at the big rat. The big rat jumped in surprise.

"Kiiik!"

Iteayeon struck the big rat with his sword again.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The big rat, which had narrowly escaped, is now baring its teeth again.

And at that moment.

[You have activated combat evasion.]

Combat evasion is activated, and Lee Tae-yeon's body dodges the big rat's attack.

Lee Tae-yeon thrusts his sword in immediately.

"Kiiiiik!"

[Dealt 2 damage to the big rat.]

"It's done!"

Lee Tae-yeon's eyes sparkle.

The limitation of combat evasion: it can only be activated once per battle.

Then, where does the system consider the battle to begin and end?

Is it until one of the monsters or Lee Tae-yeon dies? Or until they lose sight of each other? Or does the current battle end?

The Fountain of Life is a safe zone where monsters cannot enter.

If you enter and exit the safe zone, does the combat system reset?

That was the movement to confirm it, and Lee Tae-yeon's prediction was correct. If you enter and exit the Fountain of Life, the combat judgment resets, and you can activate combat evasion again.

"Then!"

Now, it's the final test.

In a state where the battle has ended, does the monster's health recover, or does it not?

Lee Tae-yeon's health did not recover.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Then, the monster would be the same.

Quaddup!

After that, it was a continuous repetition. Filling up health and mana from the Fountain of Life, using skills, and reducing health. Big Rat's intelligence wasn't that high, so it kept charging at Iteayeon.

I think we repeated that around eight times.

[You have defeated Big Rat.] [You have received a large amount of experience points.] [You have obtained 41 gold.] [You have obtained Big Rat's hide.] [You have obtained Big Rat's meat.] [You have won against a monster for the first time.] [You have obtained 100 gold.] [You have acquired the basic skill [Swordsmanship].] [You have won against a difficult enemy alone.] [Your agility has permanently increased by 1.]

Iteayeon had won in her own way.

* * *

"I won!"

In front of Big Rat's corpse, Iteayeon clenched her fist tightly. With her own judgment, her own calculation, she had won.

Those who had despised and ridiculed her would say it was a dirty method. They would criticize her for being a coward.

But it didn't matter. She had ultimately won, after all.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Hmm."

Lee Tae-yeon, who had returned to the source of life, took a deep breath. This place was similar to a game. If you won, there was a corresponding reward.

[Basic Skill: Swordsmanship] [Proficiency: 1%] [I think I can wield a sword.]

"Is it swordsmanship?"

He moved his sword. The sensation of wielding it was definitely softer than before.

And with his agility increased by 1, his speed had become even faster.

"Good."

Lee Tae-yeon nodded his head strongly.

[Big Rat's Meat] [Quality: 56%] [It's Big Rat's meat. You can eat it if you want.] [Big Rat's Leather] [Quality: 45%] [It's Big Rat's leather. It might be warm enough.]

"......You can eat it if you want."

Lee Tae-yeon sniffed the smell of the meat hesitantly. He didn't really want to eat it, but it wouldn't hurt to keep it for now.

"Inventory? Is that right?"

Lee Tae-yeon put it in the open space.

He took a deep breath and stepped forward again.

A new Big Rat appeared.

Lee Tae-yeon began to attack it in his own way again.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Let's catch one more."

[Your level has risen.] [You have reached the best condition.] [Your health has increased by 10 as a level-up reward.] [Your agility has permanently increased by 2 as a level-up reward.]

Her level has risen.

"Wow!"

Lee Tae-yeon's eyes sparkled.

The level-up and its rewards were certain.

Now his agility was 15, a 50% increase. His movements had become extremely fast.

"This is good."

At this level, he could win against Big Rat with a high probability even in a head-on fight.

But, of course, Lee Tae-yeon had no intention of doing so.

"Okay, let's go."

He searched for Big Rat again and ran towards the Fountain of Life.

* * *

"Ahaham."

The shop owner yawned.

The shop owner had to exist on every floor of the labyrinth. That was because adventurers in the labyrinth needed to buy equipment and items from him.

But he was alone. He couldn't move from one floor to another by himself.

So, what could he do?

The answer was simple.

When someone came to the shop, he would move immediately.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He was taking a break in the space given to him.

"It's so boring."

He was extremely idle.

There weren't many adventurers who came to find the labyrinth. It was a rare occurrence, happening only once every several decades.

As a result, the shop owner didn't have much to do.

Whenever adventurers came to find him, he had to move floors, but the guides of evil were stuck on the 70th floor. Other adventurers were the same, blocked on their own floors and unable to descend into the labyrinth, so naturally, there were no adventurers coming to find him.

"I wish a decent guy would come in."

He sighed. They were all disappointing. There was no one who could fulfill his wishes.

"When will it happen?"

He lit his pipe. He wasn't tired now. He had been tired for too long a time.

He just waited.

As he was smoking his pipe, someone came to the shop. The shop owner, who had been observing the floors, was surprised.

"1st floor?"

Someone on the 1st floor was looking for the shop.

"It doesn't seem like a new adventurer has arrived."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The shop owner stomps his foot. His body moves to the first floor of the shop, waiting for the adventurer.

And then the adventurer appears.

"Huh?"

The shop owner is taken aback.

Lee Tae-yeon walks in with a tired face, staggering.

"......You're alive."

The shop owner had forgotten about Lee Tae-yeon. He naturally thought she had died on her way to the Fountain of Life.

But she had survived and returned to the shop.

The shop owner, who was momentarily stunned, soon nodded his head.

"You're lucky, I suppose."

On the path to the Fountain of Life from here, a Big Rat might appear, but its numbers are not fixed. In fact, it's extremely rare to not encounter a single one and still reach the Fountain of Life.

"I don't know why you came back, but... it's the same as before. I, a coward, don't plan on selling you anything."

The shop owner mocks Lee Tae-yeon.

"Moreover, I don't think you have enough gold to buy anything from me anyway."

Lee Tae-yeon doesn't respond, but opens her inventory.

Thud, thud, thud.

Meat and leather fall out.

A lot of it, too.

A quantity close to two digits.

"......"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The shop owner is trembling with a pipe. Lee Tae-yeon asked calmly.

'How much can I get for this?'"

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
