**Chapter 604**

**604. Extra Story, 1st Floor, Lee Tae-yeon (6)**

"What is this? This is."

The shop owner couldn't hide his surprise.

He looked at Lee Tae-yeon with an expression that said he couldn't understand, gazing at the floor.

"You... how did you...?"

"At least, it's not a method you'd like."

A calm remark.

The shop owner realized something from those words.

"......You must have used a shortcut."

The Fountain of Life was a Safety Zone. Monsters couldn't enter.

And the fountain was infinite. Just one sip would restore all health and physical strength.

In other words, by repeatedly using the Fountain of Life, one could catch monsters. Eventually, one would get used to the movements of the Big Rat by repeating trial and error.

It was a kind of safety device that existed on the 1st floor of the labyrinth. It was a shortcut prepared for those who didn't fully understand the labyrinth's system, who recklessly entered the labyrinth without knowing what they were doing.

Almost all adventurers who found the labyrinth used the shortcut of the Fountain of Life.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was only natural. There was no decent recovery method here. Moreover, the Big Rats were extremely strong. It was normal play to catch one and dive into the Fountain of Life, and if two or more appeared, you would run away and recover.

'But...'

The shop owner looked at the hides.

There were over ten of them, even at a rough count. It meant that Lee Tae-yeon had caught over ten Big Rats in this short amount of time.

Lee Tae-yeon's current speed was among the top few among those who had found the labyrinth. The Lee Tae-yeon he knew was a coward and a weakling. It was absolutely impossible.

'Does he have talent?'

The shop owner tilted his head.

He couldn't understand. Those with talent would eventually realize their own abilities and receive numerous admiring and envious gazes. They would gain confidence in themselves and trust in their own abilities.

It was impossible for someone like that to become a coward. That was the shop owner's judgment.

But Lee Tae-yeon was actually a coward who had caught over ten Big Rats.

'This is strange.'

The shop owner couldn't understand Lee Tae-yeon's existence.

'But.'

Even if he had talent, Lee Tae-yeon was ultimately a coward."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Then, it's impossible to clear the labyrinth. It's a limit that can't be helped, since this is a labyrinth.

In the end, it's not worth paying attention to himself. The shop owner looked at the leather goods with a gloomy expression again.

"There are many, but... the quality is not that great. With just these leathers, I can give you around 400 gold."

"400 gold."

Lee Tae-yeon couldn't judge whether it was a lot or a little.

"Will you sell the meat too?"

"No, I'll only sell the leather for now."

Lee Tae-yeon's eyes sparkled.

"Anyway... is it possible now?"

Lee Tae-yeon grasped the big rat.

The shop owner let out a dry laugh.

"Yes. I don't want to admit it, but you've passed my standards. You can use my shop."

Lee Tae-yeon clenched his fist tightly.

"So, what do you need?"

"Uh, won't you show me?"

"Why should I show my children to someone like you? Just tell me what you need. I'll only show you that much."

"......Yes."

How annoying. Lee Tae-yeon grumbled to himself, but didn't say it out loud. The shop owner was scary, after all.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taeyeon, who had organized her thoughts, opened her mouth.

"First... is there a fire to grill meat? Should I call it a match? Do you have one?"

"There's enough to spare."

"Then show me the potions. Show me the potions."

The system of the labyrinth was like a game.

And in this game, the most necessary thing was potions. The shop owner stretched out his hand into the air. The space split open, and the potions began to appear one by one.

[Health Recovery Potion] [Recovers 50% of health.] [200G]

The most important thing was the Health Recovery Potion. 50% recovery for 200 gold. Taeyeon checked how much gold she had.

'1,012 gold.'

Taeyeon couldn't judge whether it was a little or a lot. At least she could buy five Health Recovery Potions.

There were also potions that increased attack power, speed, and other useful effects.

But not now.

"Shield. Show me the shields."

"What kind of shield?"

"All the ones I can buy for under 1,000 gold."

"Hmm."

The shop owner, who had thought for a moment, opened up the space.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**[Tower Shield]** **[Attack +1]** **[Defense +5]** **[It seems to be quite sturdy and can block many attacks.]** **[500G]** **[Wooden Shield]** **[Defense +3]** **[It's not that great. It can block most attacks, but it might break if the attack is too strong.]** **[500G]** **[Stone Shield]** **[Defense +5]** **[It's not that great. It can block most attacks, but it might break if the attack is too strong. Also, it's quite heavy, so you need a certain amount of strength to wield it properly.]** **[500G]** **[Iron Round Shield]** **[Defense +7]** **[It's not that great. It can block a lot of attacks, but it might get crushed if the attack is too strong.]** **[1000G]**

As Lee Tae-yeon read through the shields, his eyes sparkled.

"Doesn't taking damage mean blocking with a shield?"

"Except for the Tower Shield, the other shields do that."

"Huh? Why is the Tower Shield...?"

"Because it has an attack power attached to it. It's more like an attack weapon with a shield's name. It can block, but if the opponent has a certain amount of strength, you'll still take damage."

The shop owner continued to explain. Lee Tae-yeon had cleared the conditions, so it was time for him to get to work.

"Assuming the other shields can perfectly block the enemy's attack, they won't take damage."

"Then isn't that good?"

"But there's a durability issue."

The shop owner pointed to the sword Lee Tae-yeon was holding.

"While the equipment in the labyrinth has durability, it's practically meaningless. I've never heard of anyone's equipment getting destroyed. But shields are an exception."

Among the equipment in the labyrinth, only shields had limited durability.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Instead of being able to block all attacks, the durability of the equipment decreases every time an attack is blocked. And eventually, it gets destroyed."

"Is that so……."

"The shield can't withstand certain attacks and can take damage, and it can be destroyed. There are many drawbacks for various reasons."

The shield was only suitable for novice adventurers who had just entered the labyrinth. It was almost useless after just 20 floors.

But Lee Tae-yeon didn't hesitate.

"Iron prototype shield. I'll take it."

"What. I guess so."

The shop owner seemed to expect it and handed over the shield. Lee Tae-yeon took the shield and smiled satisfactorily at the sense of security it provided.

"Then let's go."

Lee Tae-yeon arrived at the Fountain of Life again.

She had defeated all the monsters on the 1st floor. The only thing left was the boss room.

But she didn't feel like going. Her instincts warned her.

She thought she'd rest here for a bit before going.

Lee Tae-yeon turned on her community. She shared all the information she had gathered while clearing the 1st floor in solo mode. She believed people would enthusiastically follow her lead.

But she encountered an unexpected backlash.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: You guys, if you can somehow reach the Fountain of Life, that's all that matters.] [Na Jae-yeon[Alone]: So, how do you get there? Everyone who listened to Lee Tae-yeon's words and tried to do it failed!] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: No, it's not that hard. Big Rat is blocking the way, but if you can somehow avoid it...…] [Isang[Alone]: It seems like avoiding it is impossible. In reality, no one except Lee Tae-yeon has succeeded.] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: No, it's not that difficult...…]

The difficulty level of Alone mode is extremely high. Even if Lee Tae-yeon shares her strategy, it's only because she's Lee Tae-yeon, and other players can't do it.

In reality, those who listened to Lee Tae-yeon's words and tried to avoid Big Rat to reach the Fountain of Life all died.

That's why people couldn't trust Lee Tae-yeon's words.

But Lee Tae-yeon was still confident in her own abilities.

"I can do it. It's not that hard."

Lee Tae-yeon didn't realize her own talents.

Her talents were only revealed when she was thrown into a life-or-death struggle. But in modern society, where there's no threat of death, she lived a very peaceful and ordinary life.

Moreover, she disliked using her body, so she never learned any physical skills. As a result, there was a gap between her and others in terms of perception.

"I don't know."

In the end, she let out a sigh and looked around the community.

People with different difficulty levels were overflowing with passion.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They were combining their strength with others to descend into the labyrinth. Easy mode had already conquered a floor.

"Envious..."

She also wanted to descend into the labyrinth with others. As much as that, she wasn't interested in solo mode at all.

It was too lonely and desolate.

"Sigh."

As time passed, everyone would come down. And they would have the same experience as her.

As she thought about it, someday she would meet them again.

Under that hope, Lee Tae-yeon moved forward.

Time passed.

Lee Tae-yeon realized that big rats would respawn after a certain amount of time had passed.

And that time was long enough for her to wait patiently.

She caught a big rat, waited for it to respawn, and caught it again.

In the process, she learned more about the labyrinth's system.

She learned that each equipment's attack power only applied when attacking with that equipment.

The Spring of Life didn't recover mental fatigue, but leveling up did.

And big rat meat was extremely, very tasteless.

As she realized many things,

She grew stronger.

* * *

Thud. Thud.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lee Tae-yeon stood in front of the store. Her equipment had changed significantly.

Her sword had turned black, and her iron shield had scratches engraved on it with claws.

She wore arm guards and ankle guards, as well as numerous rings and earrings. Even her belt was equipped.

She was in a state of wearing a lot of equipment.

"Status window."

[Lee Tae-yeon] [Level: 5] [Health: 185/185] [Mana: 14/14] [Strength: 11] [Intelligence: 13] [Agility: 17] [Attack Power +4] [Defense +18] [Target is in the best condition.]

She had very high health and defense.

Lee Tae-yeon entered the store with a satisfied smile.

"Hello?"

"......You again."

The store owner had a tired face.

"Aren't you going down?"

"No, I don't want to."

"You're a troublesome guy."

No matter what the store owner said, Lee Tae-yeon didn't care.

"Equipment. Show me. This time, earrings."

"Are you going for defense again?"

"Of course?"

The store owner clicked his tongue and showed her the equipment. Lee Tae-yeon looked around at each item and soon chose one piece of equipment.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Suho's Earring] [Defense +1] [A crude earring made by a talented young child with unskilled hands. It's rough, but the child's talent is embedded in it.] [500G]

"Annoying guy."

The shop owner muttered.

Lee Tae-yeon was still stuck on the 1st floor.

"Now, Big Rat can't even deal damage to you."

"Is that so? It's just 1 damage."

"Whatever."

The shop owner scowled.

"Don't you still want to go down to the 2nd floor?"

"Hmm."

Lee Tae-yeon pressed her lips together.

She knew it herself.

She couldn't stay on the 1st floor forever.

Of course, it was possible. The Fountain of Life was infinite.

But the Fountain of Life didn't restore her mental state.

The long years would slowly erode her mental state. Only leveling up could perfectly restore her mental state.

But Big Rat no longer gave experience points.

There was nothing to gain here except gold.

"Moreover, as I get older, my stats might decrease."

The moment she entered the labyrinth, she was free from the constraints of her lifespan, but she didn't realize it. She had to go down before she got older and weaker.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

In the end, she had to go down. She knew better than anyone that it was the correct answer.

"But..."

The still-unchecked, deep red door.

Beyond that was the boss's room, and there would be a staircase leading down to the second floor.

Then, how strong would the boss be?

Lee Tae-yeon thought she had become strong enough. But considering the difficulty level of this place, she couldn't be sure even now.

"One thing."

Lee Tae-yeon asked the shop owner.

"I have something I want to ask. Once you enter the boss's room, can you not come out?"

The shop owner didn't answer.

That alone was enough of an answer.

"I see."

This place was cruel and merciless.

But at the same time, it was strangely merciful.

"Well... I'll go take a look."

"Oh, then..."

"Of course, not now."

Lee Tae-yeon smiled faintly and stood up.

"See you later."

"Sigh..."

The shop owner let out a sigh. He had never seen an adventurer like Lee Tae-yeon, who waited for the respawn and equipped all parts of their gear.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

From the start, it was an extremely inefficient method. Those who came to this place all had confidence in their own abilities. Unless they were exceptionally talented, they wouldn't stop until they reached the bottom. Or, they would give up from the start.

Lee Tae-yeon was not like that.

"It's unconventional, but... it's not weak."

The shop owner narrowed his eyes.

Lee Tae-yeon was a coward.

But he wasn't without talent. He had an overwhelming amount of it.

The fact that he could adapt this much in such a short time was impossible with ordinary talent.

"I can go down to the 30th floor."

Considering that many adventurers died before even reaching the 10th floor, it was an excessively generous evaluation.

"But clearing it is impossible."

The shop owner was certain.

The condition for acquiring skills in the labyrinth was one.

To take actions that matched the effects of the skill.

In other words, unless you risked your life in battle and faced danger, it was impossible to acquire powerful skills.

Considering the position of skills in the labyrinth, it was impossible for Lee Tae-yeon's method to have the power to clear the labyrinth.

"And in the end, it's just a guy who clears it by cheating."

The shop owner lost interest in Lee Tae-yeon.

And then, some time passed.

Creak.

The red door opened.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Its basic appearance was similar to a big rat. Black and sharp fur. Horrifically protruding teeth.

A rodent of a size similar to a person was in the room. Its red eyes were fixed on her.

"......uh."

Lee Tae-yeon gripped her shield tightly, exerting strength into her hand.

"Kkkkkk!"

[The Giant Rat appeared.]"

Note: "끼이이이익" is an onomatopoeic word that represents a sharp, piercing sound, often used to describe the sound of a sword or a sharp object being unsheathed or striking something. In this context, it seems to be used to emphasize the sudden and dramatic appearance of the Giant Rat.
