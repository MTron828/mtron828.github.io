**Chapter 553**

**553. The Treasure Chest of the Usurper (11)**

"There are three."

This time, the usurped powers numbered three. Considering that until now, only one power could be stolen with each spiritual ascension, this was a tangible achievement.

With the spiritual usurpation, it was no longer just a matter of simply taking down and stealing the power. With Taesan's will, he could completely absorb the opponent, making it entirely his own.

As a result, the losses were overwhelmingly reduced, and it seemed that three powers had been usurped.

"Phew."

Taesan took a deep breath.

The powers that had been lost were all recovered during the process of usurping the usurper. Moreover, he had reached an even higher level.

"It's rising to divinity."

Not only black, but also divinity had been usurped.

This meant that the usurper's portion had divinity as well. As a being that usurped the universe's concept, it wasn't strange to have divinity.

However, the usurper couldn't handle the boundaries.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not like I haven't tried before. I've been challenging myself endlessly for a long time, maybe even since the past war.

And I must have failed.

"Hmm."

No matter what, it wasn't a bad story for him. Now, he has acquired powerful abilities.

Among them, there was even the power to change the direction of the future.

But there was no time to leisurely confirm it right now.

He had received a quest here.

Then, I should finish that first.

Taesan placed his hand on the bottom of the treasure chest.

"Come out, and devour."

The beast howls.

The boundary rises, covering the territory. The territory was enormous. Even with the boundary, it couldn't be devoured in one go.

But there were no more obstacles.

Taesan waited calmly for the boundary to cover the territory.

"What a shame."

There were many concepts here.

Considering Taesan's special ability to plunder the spirits, it was possible to create everything with his power.

But at least for now, it was impossible.

Because the owner of this treasure chest was still the plunderer himself."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power he plundered through spiritual theft was only partially his to own. As long as he didn't defeat the original owner, the ownership remained with the thief. He could temporarily steal it, but he couldn't make it his permanently.

'It's not entirely impossible, though.'

There's a possibility now.

But it's excessive. He can't even handle the new power he's obtained, so there's no need to forcefully contain it within him.

So, he doesn't steal it.

Instead, he liberates it.

The boundaries that had spread out slowly began to engulf the entire treasure chest. Taesan clenched his fist tightly.

[You have activated spiritual theft.]

Kuuuuuuung!

The treasure chest is the thief's sole authority. It's impossible for him to steal it permanently.

But it's possible to temporarily seize control to some extent.

So, he takes advantage of the momentary gap and liberates everything inside.

"Pierce through."

The beast of the boundary roars with joy at the master's command. The boundary that covered the treasure chest sharply bites into its territory.

Kugugugugung!

The high-pitched sound of the boundary's power begins to shake.

And soon, a hole is pierced through.

Kwagagagagang!"

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And numerous powers burst out of the hole. Transcending time and space, they leap back to where they originally belonged.

The treasure chest of the plunderer was emptied in an instant.

"Good."

Taesan smiled, satisfied with the result.

Taesan grasped the space and stepped out of the treasure chest.

Outside, there was no one.

The dark and gloomy world was all that could be seen.

"I guess they're not coming."

With his task complete, he could return. Taesan took off. But the direction he was heading was different from before.

Even from afar, he could feel the remnants of power.

A massive concept and a distorted power clashed.

Taesan headed towards it. Soon, the source of the clash came into Taesan's view.

There were gods there.

Distorted, broken. Beings capable of shaking the universe on their own.

They were pounding on the boundary.

Beyond the boundary, the transcenders were blocking the gods' attacks. They were so focused on each other that they didn't notice their surroundings at all.

Taesan arrived at the boundary.

"You all must be tired."

A small voice echoed.

The gods noticed Taesan's presence. Their gazes turned towards him."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And with that, everything in Taesan's world was about to be trampled.

Even if it was a transcendent being, it couldn't withstand the overwhelming gaze that could shake its very concept.

But Taesan endured it without any burden.

The gods couldn't take any action beyond their gaze, as they were using all their power to break through the barrier.

So Taesan was able to leisurely observe the gods one by one.

The worthless ones.

The world destroyers.

The monsters that walked through time.

The gods he had fought and those he hadn't fought.

And among them, there was one god.

The plunderer.

That distorted existence was sending a more intense gaze to Taesan than any other god.

Taesan laughed.

"Let's fight with our true forms next time."

Oooh.

The barrier was dyed with the boundary, and it engulfed Taesan.

Taesan returned to the universe. He flew back, and with a serious face, he approached the mage who was blocking the barrier.

"I'm back."

"......Oh, how did it go?"

Taesan opened his hand, and the ash-colored substance inside slowly dispersed.

The mage smiled faintly at the sight.

"It's done."

"It's done."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Thank you. I'm truly grateful. I want to talk about it, but... I don't have the leisure to do so right now."

Ughhh!

The barrier is shaking.

The barrier is now in a state similar to a worn-out rope. At this rate, it will break soon.

"Is there any point in holding on anymore?"

"Well, it's our job to hold on as much as possible. Let's go back to the labyrinth. We can hear the story there. It might be better to hear it from her rather than me."

Taesan nodded. The wizard lightly snapped his fingers. The space opened, and Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

"Then, where should we go?"

[Preparations are complete.]

Balbambara was waiting for Taesan.

After gazing at him for a moment, Taesan realized something.

Balbambara's attitude was extremely polite.

It was as if he was treating a superior being.

"What's with the sudden change in attitude?"

[There is no change. You have reached a solitary pinnacle and demonstrated your power to other transcendents.]

"I used to be casual when I was a believer."

[That's because it was a believer's position, wasn't it?]

Balbambara spoke calmly.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan let out a sigh at that attitude. He only showed respect to those who had reached the highest level of enlightenment. It was an extremely arrogant thing to say.

But considering Balbam's role, it wasn't that strange. As the administrator of the labyrinth, he must have had conversations with many transcenders.

[More than anything... the wizard told me to show respect to you. Along with the penalty.]

"......Penalty. Ah."

Taesan realized what Balbam was saying. Physical strength conversion. Balbam judged that it wouldn't be a big problem and gave Taesan the skill.

But it wasn't so. Thanks to that skill, Taesan was able to reach an even higher level of enlightenment.

But the picture the wizard drew was different. Even if it was a level achieved through reliance on skills, it was still acceptable.

"I'm grateful. Sincerely."

Of course, it was a story that didn't matter much to Taesan. On the contrary, it was a very good thing for him.

[Well... it seems the wizard didn't think it was a big problem, so I didn't say anything. But I still need to show respect.]

"Then, where should I go?"

[Just follow me.] [Balbam activated #16777767.]

Whoosh.

The space opened up.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That place was a gap in the labyrinth.

A vacant area created by the system.

[This way.]

Taesan followed the back of Balbambara. There, numerous forms of the system were visible.

It seemed that these were combined to create the labyrinth.

Taesan, who was gazing at it with interest, lowered his gaze and looked at his fingers.

"So, what's up?"

[…….]

Akasha was silent for a moment before opening her mouth.

[……I remembered.]

"How far."

[It's about my existence. Who I am, what kind of being my master is. It's all about that.]

"That's right."

Then, Akasha's master, who had remembered everything, would also recall everything.

[It's here.]

Balbambara guided Taesan to the door. And then, as if it was none of his business, he stepped back.

*Creak.*

Taesan opened the door.

And there, the goddess was waiting for Taesan.

"I'm back."

Arirnan welcomed Taesan with a smile.

* * *

"I did it. For real."

Arirnan had changed from how she was before."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She was in a state of being lost.

Therefore, she didn't feel any special aura, and seemed just like an ordinary human.

But that was no longer the case.

A strange sensation emanated from her. It was grand, thick, and impossible to describe accurately.

"The moment you were freed, I immediately knew. The concepts that were trapped inside, were released into the world. My concept as well."

"Is that concept itself sealed? It didn't feel that way."

The concept of defense was possessed by the usurper, but defense certainly existed in the universe as well. Arilnan resolved the question.

"It's simple. A concept usurped by the usurper is something that no one can reach with that concept. That's what it means to be usurped."

"......Is that so."

Taesan understood. If the concept of defense was usurped by the usurper, the god of defense would never appear again.

But now, Taesan had freed that concept of defense.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Of course, those who have already been transcended cannot return. They have been defeated and have disappeared. But now, new transcenders can emerge. The distorted order has returned to its original state. It's all thanks to you."

"Then..."

Taesan's gaze turned to Arirnan.

Arirnan had lost herself.

But she didn't disappear.

Then, now that the transcender's transcendence has been undone, has she regained what's hers?

"Yes, just as you suspected."

Arirnan laughed with great joy.

"I've regained myself. It's all thanks to you. I'm truly grateful."

"Then..."

Arirnan was saying something.

Taesan was guessing. He had transcended the red flower and made it his own. In the process, he realized what that concept was.

But hearing Arirnan say it directly felt different.

"You must be guessing too. I'm not a small concept. I'm a very large, universe-influencing concept."

Arirnan held out her hand.

A small red flower appeared there.

"Life is born in this world. It blooms, leaving its mark on the world."

The blooming red flower grew bigger and bigger, eventually blooming fully. It proudly showed off its petals, boasting of its existence.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And as it grows and grows, it encounters a more brilliant and shining era than anything else.

The flower that has bloomed more brilliantly than anything else begins to wither away. One by one, the petals start to fall.

"But the life that was born in such a way will eventually wither away, no matter what."

Arirnan clenches her fist. The flower hides its appearance.

Ku-u-ung!

Arirnan's presence expands.

A massive and dense, overwhelming concept that engulfs the entire space, surpassing any concept that Taesan has ever seen, covering all things.

Everything blooms brilliantly, withers, and repeats itself countless times, as if time is speeding up.

[You are.]

Bardley senses it. He asks in a trembling voice.

[Life's...][Life, but different. I govern something greater than that.]

Arirnan declares.

[I am the Goddess of Cycles, Arirnan.] [You are the God of Cycles, and you have encountered Arirnan.]
