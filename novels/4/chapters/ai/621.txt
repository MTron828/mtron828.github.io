Chapter 622

622. Outer Story, The Magician of the Labyrinth (5)

The 3rd and 4th floors are occupied.

But they're not ordinary orcs.

They're the leaders of their tribe, among the top-tier orcs in the entire universe.

They're beings that can turn ordinary adventurers into pulp in an instant.

As I continued to fill in the empty floors, Balbambara complained.

[What are you doing while I'm designing and refining the labyrinth's structure, Master?]

"I'm just filling in the roles."

[Are you not going to fix the internal errors?]

"Why should I do that? I created you to do that job."

[…….]

Balbambara shut his mouth. For a moment, an indescribable emotion was felt, and then his mouth opened again.

[It's difficult. The territory is too vast. It's impossible for me to manage everything on my own.]

"Is that so?"

[Assistance is needed. Even if you don't do it yourself, Master, can't you create an additional manager to help?]

"Hmm."

The man stroked his chin.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Reflecting on it, it wasn't a wrong statement. It's impossible for one person to manage such a vast area alone.

"Are you the manager?"

Actually, having only monsters makes the labyrinth less eerie.

Having guides to lead the adventurers would be even better. A man's eyes sparkled.

People who have made a different contract from the monsters.

They settle in the labyrinth and offer quests and goods to the adventurers who come to them.

So, how can such contractors be summoned to the labyrinth? The answer wasn't difficult.

The labyrinth is a space where many strong individuals gather.

Even if someone has an almost impossible dream, with the help of an adventurer, it could be fulfilled someday.

People with unattainable dreams. By making a contract with them, they are made to settle in the labyrinth.

The man gained a guide to the labyrinth, and the adventurers gained quests and appropriate rewards. The contractors gained the possibility of fulfilling their dreams.

"It's only beneficial."

The man laughed cheerfully. He had another task. He was very happy.

How should the floors be divided?

It shouldn't be boring, so maybe every 10 floors?
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He thinks and acts in many ways.

Time passes and flows by.

Compared to the beginning, he makes contracts with even more transcenders and finds guides one by one. The floors are also gradually filled with various monsters.

And conflicts with the gods occur.

An event that will influence the universe for an unpredictable amount of time.

Even amidst such events, the man did not stop designing the labyrinth.

And finally.

Even if we look at it from the transcenders' perspective, a vast amount of time has passed.

The labyrinth is complete.

* * *

"Good."

The man smiled satisfactorily. The labyrinth, all 100 floors, was complete without a single empty space.

Of course, there were still many lacking parts. Things like designing each floor or adjusting the difficulty level would need to be continued.

But for now, the overall framework was complete.

Now, the labyrinth could be developed.

"Then."

What would he show to the adventurers who would find the labyrinth?

The man, who had been thinking for a moment, wrote a phrase.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There is a rumor that this labyrinth, created by a great wizard of old, will grant a single wish to whoever conquers it. This is a place of confinement. Fearsome creatures move silently, and living things die. Everything here exists to oppress you. Eternal glory awaits those who can break through the deep and profound labyrinth.

As I write, I get excited and there may be some strange parts, but it doesn't matter. It's a problem that can be fixed later.

The man opened the labyrinth.

A labyrinth created by transcendents.

If you succeed in conquering that labyrinth, you can fulfill any wish.

The news spreads throughout the universe.

And strong individuals from each world, who overestimate their power, begin to gather.

Most of them die without reaching the 20th floor. The labyrinth is not easy. It's not designed to be easily conquered by someone who can only boast about their power in one world.

But some of them go deeper, using their talents and relying on good luck to reach further.

Of course, they too die without reaching the 50th floor.

The man enjoyed watching their adventures and deaths.

It wouldn't have been enjoyable if it had happened before.

He is the god of adventure. He knows how their adventures will end.

But he no longer dominates the concept of adventure."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Their adventures and struggles. Each one was new and exciting.

The man smiled satisfactorily.

As time passed, someone finally appeared who had reached the deepest part of the labyrinth.

He was the man who had designed the deep level. He went down beyond the 70th floor, and the man watched his challenge with interest.

But he was defeated.

He was overwhelmed by the enormity of the labyrinth and gave up on further conquest.

The wizard made a contract with him to become the guardian of the labyrinth.

Time continued to flow.

Many adventurers challenged the labyrinth.

They died in vain.

Some of them, after desperate efforts and struggles, reached the end of the labyrinth.

But they couldn't conquer it.

They only reached the end, and their wishes were not fulfilled.

After that, various events occurred, and the man saw them.

He saw those who couldn't break through the deep level and were controlled by the labyrinth.

They called themselves the "guides of sin".

"What are they?"

A hollow laugh came out. Adventurers trying to manage the labyrinth? It was a direction he had never expected.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Spirit King, the Great Mage... Ugh, it's all so ridiculous.

I thought about intervening for a moment, but I quickly abandoned the idea. Their actions are just another adventure, and I enjoyed it for what it was.

More than anything, whoever wants to conquer the labyrinth must be able to break through their pressure and push forward.

It's just another trial, I suppose. The man left them to their own devices.

Many people have challenged the labyrinth.

But none of them have reached the possibility of conquest.

"When will I come out?"

It's unknown. Conquering the labyrinth means conquering the realm, and becoming a transcendent being. It's likely that even after an eternity, they won't emerge.

But it's not impossible.

After billions of years, they might appear someday.

Until then, he just enjoyed himself.

And so, time kept passing.

The man saw a man who had transcended time, coming from a world that was on the brink of destruction, where the gods had abandoned it.

* * *

"This is a story you know from now on.""

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan descended into the labyrinth. He began to conquer the labyrinth, overcoming numerous hardships and obstacles, and eventually succeeded in conquering it by utilizing the system itself.

"This is my story."

The story of a magician before he became a magician.

And the story of a magician after he became one.

Taesan, who had been silent, opened his mouth.

"Is it like the case of the God of Descent?"

"The details may differ, but it's similar, don't you think? He ultimately fell to fill his own emptiness."

The God of Descent had gone mad over the concept of descent itself.

That's why he wanted to sacrifice himself to the gods and fall.

"But you solved it by emptying yourself."

"Yes. Compared to you, I'm just a fledgling, but I also emptied myself."

Taesan had perfectly abandoned himself in the process of facing the usurper.

On the other hand, the magician had only abandoned the concept of adventure, so there was a clear difference.

However, both of them had gone through the process of emptying themselves.

"I felt endless emptiness. At the end, I abandoned my own concept."

The magician murmured quietly.

"I am the God of Adventure. The God of Adventure. I was Barahmian."

That was the magician's name.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's just a simple labyrinth's magician now."

"Are you satisfied?"

"Is there any reason not to be satisfied?"

The magician laughed. It was a pure, unadulterated laugh without a single speck of impurity.

"I abandoned adventure and regained it."

He abandoned what he had built for himself and took hold of what he wanted for himself.

"And now, I'm seeing the result of that action right before my eyes."

The one who conquered the labyrinth.

The one who became a transcender in the process of conquering the labyrinth.

The universe's irregular, born in his labyrinth.

"Are you satisfied? I'm very satisfied. The more satisfying thing is that it's not the end here. I'll keep watching over the labyrinth from now on. Someday, someone will conquer the labyrinth again, and I'll go ask them. What do they want as the price of conquest?"

The magician's adventure has not ended yet.

He will continue to watch over the labyrinth and enjoy the adventures of mortals.

Taesan opened his mouth.

"You're amazing."

"……It's an honor. The highest praise."

The magician laughed kilkil (a Korean onomatopoeia for a bright, cheerful laugh).
