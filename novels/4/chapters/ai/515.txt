Chapter 516

516. The Eighth Return, Earth (1)

The return to Earth. Taesan's eyes sparkled.

Up until now, there had been a total of seven returns, and by clearing all the quests, all of humanity could gather in one place.

Then, the next task to be done was one thing.

The cleanup of Earth.

And the removal of the hole that had opened in the sky.

"It's faster than I thought."

The magician agreed with Taesan's words.

"I didn't think you'd reach the latter half of the 90th floor until now. But recently, there's been a strange atmosphere."

"A strange atmosphere?"

"The crack that's opened on your planet."

The massive hole that covered the sky.

"It's getting bigger little by little."

Taesan's eyes narrowed.

"Earth, if you think about it, is neither our side nor theirs. It's a neutral zone. I've been examining it closely, but... it's strange."

The magician's face was uncertain, as if they didn't know what to make of it.

"Something's off. It doesn't seem like just the gods' intervention, but I'm not sure."

“Don’t you know?”

“We also have a lot of work to do recently, so it’s impossible to get an accurate grasp of the situation. There are too many annoying things, and we don’t have any spare time. So, it’s better to take care of what we can beforehand.”

The wizard looked at Taesan.

“Going back to Earth and sealing the heavenly rift. That’s the goal of this quest.”

Sealing the heavenly rift.

In reality, it was a finishing task. Taesan nodded his head.

“Okay. How do we seal it?”

In his past life, he had also sealed the heavenly rift. At that time, they thought they had won, but it was just an illusion created by God.

When Taesan moved to a distorted timeline using a piece of Uroboros, he attacked the heavenly rift with all his might.

At that moment, the rift opened.

Something came out of it and grabbed the boundary line, crushing it.

It was probably the guardian of the rift. Stepping on the boundary line meant facing an opponent at the God level. It was questionable whether they could close the rift guarded by such an existence.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Don't worry about that part. Because this time, you're not alone."

"Are we not alone?"

"There will be people who will come to help you."

The wizard said quietly.

"They will help close the rift in the sky."

"The Transcendent?"

"No. The Transcendent can't intervene from the start. You know that, right?"

The Earth is a neutral zone. If the Transcendent intervenes, it means the gods can intervene as well.

"So, there will be a messenger. I'll give them a card that's useful to them, so if you use it well, it'll be fine."

The wizard spoke without any emotional change.

"Do whatever you want with the messengers. Do as you please. We won't bother you."

It was a meaningful phrase. Taesan nodded in agreement.

"Let's do that."

"Then, I'll watch from afar."

"Are you leaving already?"

"I said I'm busy. I really have a lot of things to do."

The wizard grumbled and opened a space. He half-merged into the space beyond and looked at Taesan.

"I don't know what the result will be, but... I'll be expecting it. As always."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's right."

The wizard had left. There were only two days left. If there was time, it was a time of leisure, and if not, it was a time of nothingness. Taesan opened a community.

The community was naturally bustling. People from all over the world gathered together, sharing many stories.

However, there was little worry in their conversations.

Hope of winning.

And faith in Taesan.

Those were the most visible things.

Taesan, who had been watching them for a moment, opened a separate chat window.

[Taesan [Alone] : How's it going?] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone] : Ah, are you here?] [Amelia Erin [Alone] : Taesan! You're here!] [Geum Jung-geun [Hard] : Sir, have you arrived?]

A chat window where key players from each country gathered. Taesan posted again.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Gang Tae-san [Alone]: How's the overall number of people right now?] [Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: I need to check the details, but... around 160,000, I think.] [Oliver Khan [Hard]: That's a lot.] [Daniel Darmon [Hard]: Should we say it's a lot...?] [Oliver Khan [Hard]: I expected less than 100,000. This is more than enough.]

It was as Oliver said. If there were 150,000, it was a sufficient number to have survived.

They chatted a bit more. There were around 25 million in Hard mode, 65 million in Normal mode, and 8 million in Easy mode left.

[Gang Tae-san [Alone]: What's the highest floor each of you has reached?] [Oliver Khan [Hard]: It varies by country, but in Hard mode, it's around 80-70 floors. Normal is 90 floors. And Easy mode is almost cleared.] [Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Has no one cleared it?] [Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: No one has. Anyway, no one wants to go out right now.]

Not going out was the correct answer. If they went out in Easy mode now, all they could do was run away and eventually die. It was better to wait in the labyrinth with other players until they could go out together.

In their past lives, many people didn't know that and went out of the labyrinth alone, only to meet an unknown death.

Tae-san didn't want to see that again.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Don't let anyone leave until I permit it.] [Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: Yes.] [Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Then, how far have Tae-yeon, Amelia, and Jun-hyeok, including other Alone mode players, reached?] [Gang Jun-hyeok [Alone]: I'm on the 69th floor.] [Amelia Airin [Alone]: 76th floor.]

Many other Alone mode players mentioned the floors they had reached. Overall, they had reached the 60th floor.

"It's faster than I thought."

Tae-san's dark magic and magic seemed to be definitely helpful. It wasn't bad.

And then it was Tae-yeon's turn, and everyone was shocked.

[Tae-yeon [Alone]: 83rd floor.] [Gang Jun-hyeok [Alone]: Wow.] [Amelia Airin [Alone]: ...It's ridiculously fast.]

83rd floor. It was already mid-level in the deep floors.

[Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Is it manageable?] [Tae-yeon [Alone]: It's okay. It's tough, but... it's not unbearable.] [Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Then that's fine. Don't overdo it.] [Tae-yeon [Alone]: Do I look like someone who does that?] [Gang Tae-san [Alone]: That's also true.]

Tae-san chuckled. Tae-yeon had definitely changed, but his fundamental nature remained the same.

Amelia intervened, seemingly unhappy with their conversation."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Amelia Airin[Alone]: Taesan, where are you? Which floor did you reach?] [Oliver Kan[Hard]: I'm curious about that too. Is it around the 80th floor?] [Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard]: If it's Taesan, I think you would have entered the 90th floor.] [Amelia Airin[Alone]: 90th floor? Even if it's Taesan, that's...…] [Gang Taesan[Alone]: 94th floor.]

There was a sudden silence. The community, which had been noisy until now, became quiet in an instant.

Taesan calmly moved his hand.

[Gang Taesan[Alone]: We'll be returning in two days, so everyone get ready.]

* * *

The community was in an uproar. Each person was discussing how to prepare for this return and how to respond. And what was the purpose of this return? They were debating and discussing each point.

Taesan turned off the community and opened his skill window.

[Special Activation Skill: Forced Arrival] [Mana Consumption: 50] [Proficiency: 1%] [You can forcibly reach your desired goal. However, the goal you can set is limited, and you must take full responsibility for the penalties and risks involved in achieving it.]

Taesan knew what kind of skill this was and how to handle it.

But Forced Arrival was a skill Taesan had obtained for the first time. He needed to roughly check it before being summoned to Earth.

"Hmm."

[You have activated Forced Arrival.]

Taesan set one goal in his mind and activated the skill.

Whoosh.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The boundary line reveals its form.

The ash-colored substance that flowed out covers the appearance of the Taesan. And it doesn't stop there. The ash-colored substance continues to flow out and slowly begins to erode the space.

The boundary line fills the 94th floor.

And it goes beyond that. It transcends the floor, climbs the stairs, and begins to move to another floor.

[Uh.]

At that moment, Bardley felt a sense of discomfort. The boundary line that Taesan was handling was distinctly different from usual.

Until now, it had been unusual and dangerous, but still controllable. But now, it wasn't. The boundary line was spreading beyond Taesan's control.

"This feeling..."

Taesan grasped the boundary line.

With this experiment, they roughly knew how to handle forced arrival.

"It's okay."

If they handled it well, they could change the outcome itself. The tasks to be done for the remaining two days were set. They would conceptualize and calculate the utilization of forced arrival. Taesan's mind was racing at high speed.

Time flew by in an instant.

And after two days, they began to return to Earth.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Amelia Airin[Alone] : Alright, let's go!] [Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard] : Let's all survive.]

The community's posts were going up at a rapid pace. Among them, there was a familiar name that caught Taesan's eye.

[Lee Deok-su[Easy] : Ugh, it's always scary.]

"He's alive."

Taesan let out a small laugh. The space opened up, and Taesan's physical body began to emerge from the labyrinth.

Finally.

He took a step forward.

The sound of people's cheers and determined breathing filled the air. Many people's gazes were fixed on Taesan.

They had returned. To their hometown.

* * *

[Special Quest Start] [This quest targets all of humanity.] [Gather the surviving people, create rules, and establish order.] [This quest has no time limit.]

The quest appeared. The goal of the quest was to gather people first. The leaders of each country shouted out.

"Alright! Everyone, gather around!"

"American players, come this way!"

People calmly followed their instructions. By the eighth time, people's movements had become very familiar.

Taesan watched the scene from a distance.

Finally.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Lord Taesan, it's been a while."

"It has been a while."

Diana and Beldegeia approached Taesan. Diana looked at Amelia and Lee Tae-yeon and burst out laughing.

"You've gotten stronger. It's quite noticeable. With that kind of power, I'm not sure I could win even if we worked together."

"Everyone's working hard, so it's okay."

Everyone was risking their lives to clear the labyrinth. They would grow slowly but surely.

After some time passed, the people had perfectly established their order.

"It's done."

"That was fast."

There were over a hundred people. Even if they were all superhumans, it would take more than a day to organize, but it didn't even take a few hours. Kim Hwi-yeon said with a proud face.

"Everyone's gotten used to it. Above all, because Lord Taesan is here."

All players on Earth worshiped Taesan. With an absolute god like that, there was no need for words. Kim Hwi-yeon clenched his fist.

"This time will be dangerous too, but if people combine their strength like this, we can win."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

As soon as he finished speaking, the system window appeared.

[Special Quest Complete.] [Special Quest Start.] [The Guardians have arrived. Talk to them, exchange opinions, and combine your strengths.]

"Huh?"

"The Guardians?"

People were bewildered. Before their confusion could settle, they appeared.

Kyiiiing!

A holy light fell from the sky, and people covered their eyes from the blinding flash.

"What...?"

"The Portal Army."

Taesan muttered.

The golden pillar was a kind of portal.

Kyiiiing......

The light slowly faded, and hundreds of people appeared through the portal.

They were warriors and mages. The armor they wore hinted at the fierce battles they had fought and the enemies they had faced.

"Strong."

All hundreds of them were at a considerable level. The representative among them stood out as particularly powerful.

"Huh?"

"What, what is this?"

People were shocked by the appearance of these unusual beings. Diana was also shocked, but her shock was different from the others.

"The Guardians..."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Diana's face was filled with rejection.

Hundreds of beings that appeared on Earth slowly approached the mountain. And the one who seemed to be the representative bowed his head.

"It's an honor to meet you, great one. We are the guardians."

Clank!

Those behind him took a perfect, flawless stance all at once.

It wasn't a union that could be achieved in a year or two. The man spoke quietly.

"My name is Arcasian. I have come to this place to help you, following the will of the great ones."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
