Chapter 150

150. Outside. The Stage of the Gods (6)

Mantara was startled. It was as if it were a mortal, a being with a limited life span, living only once.

Rakiratas appeared here, and it was a matter of course.

"[You are unable to descend here!] [Did you really believe that?]"

Rakiratas mocked Mantara. "[We can't even crush you, so we just watched and didn't intervene because we were weak, didn't we?]"

Rakiratas' existence upends the world. The entire battlefield, stretching endlessly, becomes his domain.

"[It's not wrong. We've been doing this so far. We've been saying so far.] [……God's banishment!]"

Mantara seethed with anger.

Tae-san banished the gods here. As a result, the number of gods has dwindled to just two.

Originally, gods would have entered continuously, and there would have been no problem. However, due to Tae-san's decisive and swift handling, a gap was created.

The gods of the labyrinth were not strong enough to intervene to the extent they wanted to.

"[But!]"

Note: The translation is in Simplified Chinese, as per the rules.
Here is the translation of the text:

Mantara's physical body shone. At the same time, her presence spread like branches.

[This is our territory. Even if you are the one who takes responsibility for struggle and death, you cannot easily win.] [Let's not do something boring.]

Rakirata smiled. It was as if she was pacifying a child's tantrum, and Mantara's aura scattered.

[Even if we fight among ourselves, the outcome is clear. That's not fun.] [……]

Rakirata seemed to lack a sense of purpose in battle. Mantara's momentum also slowly decreased.

[What do you plan to do?] [There is no saint here.]

Just like the gods who have been dealt with by Tai Shan, Mantara would have brought her saint here as well.

[The affairs of mortals belong to mortals. I don't think it's suitable.] [Are you talking about a duel between your apostle and my saint and me?] [My apostle is not.] [What's that?]

Mantara's eyes trembled.

[Is it for someone who is not a saint?] [Do you think I'm a god who is concerned with such things?]

Rakirata smiled. Mantara nodded in understanding and remained silent.

Rakirata was a god who was much freer than her usual self. Even the gods outside were well aware of this.
Here is the translation of the text:

 Rakiratas looked at Tai Shan.

Of course, I would also like to hear your opinion.

"I don't care."

Tai Shan nodded his head immediately.

It's a shame that the battle of the gods has ended like this. There was nothing meaningless about it.

There were still many things to be obtained. Until I got everything, I didn't think about ending it.

He said so, smiling slightly.

Mantara's eyes flashed with anger.

Don't regret it. I'll use your toy as a whip. [It's not a toy, but... think whatever you want.]

Mantara had disappeared at some point. Rakiratas laughed lightly.

"What a hot-headed guy."

Tai Shan muttered to himself. Mantara was easily showing emotions such as anger, astonishment, and the like.

When you think about it, even the gods of the labyrinth were not different. They directly revealed their emotions.

"We were once mortal. We became a transcendent being by rising to a great position. To us, emotions are very precious. It's a special thing to soothe eternal boredom."

Rakiratas spoke calmly.
Here is the translation of the text:

As I think back, it was like that.

The mighty power that was nurtured only led to the gods of today being elevated from mortal to immortal.

But it was only the divine beings who weren't like that.

[I expect you to reach this place one day too.]

With that, Rakirata vanished.

When the energy that filled the space disappeared, the mountain exhaled a small sigh.

"It's still far away."

He wouldn't say the word "impossible" on his lips. His goal was right there, so there was no need for it.

As for them, they were also once mortal like the mountain, and one day they too could reach it.

The mountain clenched his fist.

* * *

The next day, the mountain went to see another god.

This time, it was a divine being born from the source spring. Hence, the spirits that weren't human welcomed the mountain with great enthusiasm.

[Die!] [You are the enemy of the spirits! Become ashes!]
Here is the translation of the text:

It was impossible to know whether to like or dislike the Taesan who had massacred the spirits.

But it was impossible to leave him alone. The Taesan shook his hand.

[You have ignited a small spark.] [You have triggered a deer walking on the wind.]

The wind and flames occurred simultaneously. The flames' storm engulfed the spirits.

Although they resisted desperately, the small spark was the fragment of the Spirit King. Ordinary spirits could not withstand it.

In a few minutes, all the spirits disappeared.

[You have destroyed the statue of the Spirit God born from the source, and the Spirit God born from the source has been driven out of the divine battlefield.] [The original Spirit God remains silent in response to your actions.]

"It's scary."

It was a silence that neither rejoiced nor raged.

When we met again, I wouldn't kill the Taesan, but I didn't know how to react.

Then it was the final moment.

Next to the great pillar, there was a small building.

Unlike before, there was no sense of popularity. Only one person was waiting for the Taesan.

When I opened the door and entered, a man in armor greeted the Taesan.

"Ah, you're here. The agent of the labyrinth."
Here is the translation of the text:

A middle-aged man with a flamboyant face, wearing a golden-hued, shining sword on his shoulder, greeted Mount Tai.

"'Gangha-gun'!"

Even if one could only feel the aura, the guides of the 2nd-grade evil path were far beyond him.

It was expected to be that way.

The limit of the battlefield was 75 levels.

Based on the level of the people he had met so far, even a 70-level warrior would have struggled, but it was possible to win.

Therefore, it was possible that someone could possess a strength of 70 levels or higher.

The man in front of him was none other than that existence.

"I am the magnificent sword spirit, the saint of Mantra, Cain."

The man points his sword at Mount Tai.

"I'd like to say it's a fair fight, but you're too strong, gangha-gun."

Cain smiled wryly. He was at a level where he couldn't even win against a 70-level adventurer.

However, he was only at that level. He was absolutely unable to stop Mount Tai.

"Sorry, but I'll have to borrow the power given by God."

"Go ahead, just once."

Mantra would not just sit back and watch. He must have been plotting something to defeat Mount Tai. Cain raised his sword to the sky.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Oh, god! Your servant prays to you!"

Power descends from the crack in the sky.

It was a terrible thing. A mortal could not reach such a great power, which had come down to Cain.

The Great Mountain scowled.

Cain, with his raised eyes, shouted:

"Please grant me the power to serve you!"

The aura of gold enveloped Cain's entire body.

Cain took a deep breath.

"Is this... the power of god?"

He looked down at his hand with a look of astonishment, as if a power of a different dimension had entered his physical body.

"Good. This is a decent fight."

Cain smiled, drawing his sword. The Great Mountain looked at him with an ambiguous face.

Cain knew the power he had received. This was because he had used similar powers before.

A ghost spoke:

"Ah, Sodane. You're one of them."

* * *

[There is no loss of power, and the user's level is not reduced... You're really a Sodane. Is this the first time you've really seen a Sodane?]

"Maybe so."

Note: Sodane is likely a term or title in the context of the story, but its meaning is unclear from the text.
Here is the translation of the text:

The proof of god. The apostle of Fabshia. Malenstein. He was the first apostle to be recognized by Tai Shan.

However, his strength was not that great.

He descended upon the mortal realm by borrowing Tai Shan's physical body, so he couldn't possess the apostle's authority and couldn't use his martial arts skills either.

As a result, he could win easily without any major problems.

But the one in front of him was different.

The gods of the labyrinth had been constantly offering him a position.

He possessed the apostle's authority.

"It's the worst-case scenario I expected."

[The opponent is a formidable foe.]

The judgment appears suddenly.

[The desire for battle has been triggered.]

At the same time, his stat-boosting skills also activate consecutively.

"Ah! Owner! Representative of the Labyrinth!"

Kain grasped the golden sword and charged forward. Tai Shan quickly drew out two swords.

Kaaang!

A spark flew out. Tai Shan felt a powerful force emanating from beyond the sword.

"Ah!"

Kain infused power into the hand holding the sword with a short shout. The sudden surge of power caused Tai Shan to quickly move his hand and thrust the sword into Kain's shoulder.

Kagak!

However, the sword did not sink in.
Here is the translation of the text:

Despite having stored all his strength, he was unable to pierce the armor and was repelled.

Just like the gods in the realm of the immortals, his swordsmanship was ineffective due to the constraints of the sacred oath.

Hmph!

The Mountain God swung his sword and created some distance.

Kaine charged recklessly.

He believed in the divine power of the beautifully decorated sword.

However, his swordsmanship, which was supposed to be in line with his faith, was rough and unrefined, lacking in elegance.

Hmph!

The Mountain God was in a hurry to parry.

Using the momentum, the Mountain God shook his sword.

Although it was difficult to wield the sword, there was no obstacle in swinging it.

"This level of skill, is it?"

"Let's continue!"

"Alright, let's try."

Hmph!

The Mountain God was in a hurry to parry. Although his swordsmanship was superior, his attacks were ineffective due to the constraints of the sacred oath and the power of the divine sword.

Hmph!

The Mountain God's body flew away far away. He regained his balance and landed.

"It seems that you have not received the blessing of the gods. Therefore, you cannot defeat me. What a pity,"
Here is the translation of the text:

Kain said confidently, "I will not think about my defeat at all." Suddenly, the sky darkened.

"I don't believe in gods," he said.

"That's a pity. I've given everything to the gods. There's no happier thing than that."

"I don't like that," he said.

He came here by his own will, not because he trusted someone or gave himself to someone.

Kain smiled wryly.

"So you'll trust yourself and get buried in the ground?"

"Okay."

The mountain muttered to himself, tightening his grip on his sword.

From the recent battle, he could sense it.

"That's not a true prophet."

[You're just forcing yourself to be strong because you're going to die at the hands of a fake prophet.]

The ghost laughed and looked down at the prophets he had seen before, thinking that Kain's level was extremely low.

[If that's a prophet, then even the guidance spirits are prophets.]

"It's enough for this."

[You have activated the Sadoization (Rakiratas).]

The power surged into Taesan's body.

A red glow appeared in Taesan's pupils, and everything was strengthened. His strength, speed, and even his battle prowess were all enhanced.

Kain was taken aback.
Here is the translation of the text:

"...?"

"I kind of understand."

Tai Shan put his foot down. He drew his sword just like he had been doing until now. Cain hurriedly blocked it.

Kaaaang!

"Ugh!"

Cain's arm was pushed back. His eyes widened in shock.

"You said you don't believe in gods, but..."

"I don't believe in gods. This is just something I received."

"What a ridiculous thing to say!"

Cain shouted with a tone of denial, and hurriedly drew his sword. The sword that seemed to pierce the sky came crashing down on Tai Shan's head.

Tai Shan drew his left arm, and when it clashed with Cain's sword, he twisted it and sent it flying.

"Hmph!"

Cain didn't take it lying down and snapped his sword-wielding arm back, then stabbed it straight into Tai Shan's head.

Kwik.

"Kkang!"

[Cain took 202 points of damage.]

Cain let out a painful groan.

"Grrr..."

Unlike before, Cain created some distance between them.

Tai Shan charged at him immediately.

Sado-Hwa's duration is 10 minutes. He had to finish it within that time.
Here is the translation of the text:

Since I deliberately delayed time to grasp Cain's movements, it was as expected.

Verification is complete.

The only thing left is victory.

However, Tai Shan did not intend to finish his plan yet.

The god of self-identification crushed it with proof, and the god of mystery handled it with magic.

The spirit also used spirit magic to annihilate it.

The opponent is a servant of the god of the sword.

Therefore, it was already decided what to use.

[You have activated the counter.]
