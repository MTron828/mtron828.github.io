112. 24th Floor. Guide of Sin (1)

"Hmm."

Taesan stared at the system window intently.

It was an explanation he had never seen before. Moreover, it was an explanation that normal and hard mode players had not seen either.

Only Itaeyeon had mentioned seeing this reward window.

"Oh, you already received this? I went down quite a bit before receiving it."

The ghost muttered. It seemed to be a reward received upon surpassing a certain level of growth.

"What should I choose?"

Taesan murmured. There were six choices, and each one was appealing in its own way.

"What did you choose?"

"Me? I chose equipment. They gave me quite a good piece. It's not as good as the weapon I gave you or the ring you have, but it's equipment you can barely obtain after descending another 10 floors below your current level."

It was certainly good equipment. For an ordinary player, choosing equipment might be the correct answer.

"If it's of a similar caliber, it should also boost your potion proficiency by about 3 or 4 percent."
It also certainly had its merits. Currently, Taesan had a skill that was just about to hit 100%. If he received it and used it, he could reach 100% effortlessly.

But neither of them was really necessary.

Proficiency would increase eventually as he descended deeper into the dungeon. The rate might be frustrating, but it wasn't unattainable.

Of course, if there were skills urgently needed right now, it might be a different story. However, there weren't any such crucial skills, so their priority was relatively low.

Equipment was the same. There was no reason to change equipment at the expense of other things when he could descend to the 30th floor without any problems.

Stats were likewise. There was no value in sacrificing other rewards for them.

Overall knowledge about the labyrinth wasn't particularly appealing either. He had previous life experience and remembered Itaeyeon's excited words. With the ghost accompanying him, he could gather all the basic information.

So, the choices narrowed down to the last two.

"Truth and information."

When it came to truth, it likely pertained to matters related to gods, magicians, monsters, and NPCs. For Taesan, who would encounter them frequently, knowing about them wouldn't hurt.
Information was also not bad. Despite conditions and limitations, being able to know what you wanted was a significant merit.

After pondering, Taesan made his decision.

"As the sixth option."

He didn't particularly need to know about the truth either. Moreover, since he had established many relationships with gods, he was likely to gradually learn about it.

As Taesan made his decision, the floor of the labyrinth rose. Bricks assembled themselves into the shape of a giant mechanism.

"I am the servant of the great magician. The one who perceives all things. Valbambba."

The mechanism with eyes made of bricks opened.

"O traveler descending into the magician's labyrinth. What curiosity has summoned me?" "What? Was this guy supposed to answer?"

The ghost muttered in surprise. It seemed to recognize the entity referred to as Valbambba.

"Who are you?"

"An guide of sorts, informing about basic strategies. Appears intermittently as you delve deeper, guiding or providing information about the labyrinth. Adventurers believed I knew everything, answering all questions and revealing all solutions, so they trusted I understood the entirety of the labyrinth."

Everything.

The meaning contained within was not insignificant. The ghost seemed to guess Taesan's thoughts as it spoke.
[There were a few who attempted to suppress me, but they were completely annihilated without leaving a speck of dust. Since then, no one has dared to meddle.] "I am the servant of the magician. This is the labyrinth created by the magician. The absolute laws are in my hands."

Valbambba stated calmly.

"That applies to knowledge as well. Ask your question. I am the one who knows the labyrinth. I will provide the answer."

"It's about the acquisition conditions for skills."

Taesan had learned several skills. Among them were skills that were practically impossible to learn, bordering on irrationality. Judging from the ghost's reaction, these were skills that even adventurers who delved deeply did not know about.

Therefore, Taesan became curious.

"Are skills designed directly by the magician, or are they created based on conditions?"

Was it learning existing skills?

Or did Taesan gain skills because he achieved accomplishments?

It was a question akin to whether the egg came first or the chicken.

"I have received your question."
The bricks that made up Valbambba collided fiercely with each other. As if assembling a puzzle, each piece fell into place, and the collisions ceased. Valbambba opened his eyes.

"...I understand the reason for your question now."

The iris made of bricks exuded a mysterious aura.

"So, what is it?"

"I will answer. Skills are not pre-made. They are created based on achievements attained."

"As I suspected."

"Humans, spirits, demons, and countless other races. Skills arise when one accomplishes feats bordering on irrationality or through repetitive actions. Once a skill is created, it becomes fixed and others can learn it too. That is the essence of the labyrinth's skills, bestowed by the magician."

It was difficult to anticipate and pre-create every skill. The method of skill creation was continuous.

Depending on what Taesan did, it meant that he could obtain countless skills that he hadn't acquired in his previous life.

Taesan smiled.
In my previous life, I had thought about various things, but due to lack of time, space, and other conditions, there were experiments I couldn't attempt. Now, there is value in testing all those conditions.

Valbambba cast a curious glance at Taesan, who was enjoying himself.

"Was this designed for this? Interesting. Has your curiosity been satisfied?"

Taesan nodded. Valbambba continued.

"Then there are conditions."

Instead of providing information, there arose conditions and restrictions. This had already been explained.

"Do not tell anyone the information you have learned. If the information leaks out, I will come to kill you."

"Got it."

Taesan affirmed calmly. It was unnecessary information to share, and he had no intention of doing so.

"What about the ghost?"

"It's already a deceased entity, bound to the labyrinth. It is not subject to restrictions. But if it tries to speak, I will intervene."

"Is that a threat? I have no such intention, so don't worry."

"Alright then. Since I've answered your questions, I'll head down now."

Kugugung.

Bricks crumbled down. They began to reassemble into the floor of the labyrinth, and soon, the intricate maze floor was complete.

"Magician."
The magician who created the labyrinth. Even the ghost knew nothing about him. Seeing that Itaeyeon also didn't say anything, it was safe to say she hadn't approached the truth either.

"I'm curious."

It wasn't something that could be known right away.

He intended to find out gradually.

It was organized. Now was the time to confirm the clear reward on the 23rd floor.

[Snake Skin Belt] [Strength + 10] [Defense + 15] [A belt made from an unknown snake that twists wood.]

It had high defense and additional strength. It was not a bad piece of equipment.

[Used ???] [Obtained Gauntlet Used by the Ancestor.] [Gauntlet Used by the Ancestor] [Attack Power + 30] [A gauntlet that the ancestor used to enjoy using before being called the Ancestor. His talent and growth are buried in it.]

It was high in attack power. The powerful gauntlets I was wearing now had an effect that dealt damage five times the attack, but there was a constraint that it could only be used once a month.

Considering that, it was enough equipment worth changing.

"I hope magic items will come out soon."

It had been quite a while since I had learned new magic. From now on, it was regrettable to think that the value of the primary magic was high.
However, it wasn't something that could simply be achieved by wanting it. The items appearing in the labyrinth were entirely random, or predetermined from the beginning. Taesan was prepared to wait patiently.

Having cleared the 23rd floor, Taesan ascended and went to find the spirit.

[Hehe! You've come!]

"Here."

Taesan handed over the nucleus of the higher spirit. The ecstatic spirit laughed until its mouth split open.

[Hehe, hehehe! Finally! Finally!]

The ecstatic spirit clumsily swallowed the nucleus.

Kwoong.

A small vibration echoed inside the spirit's body. The white blob that had swelled as if it would burst in an instant slowly subsided.

[Ha, ha......]

Laughter gradually subsided.

The unstable energy that had been haunting the ecstatic spirit almost completely disappeared.

[Ha.]

The spirit exhaled. The madness that had been overflowing just a moment ago vanished without a trace.

[Now... it's almost done.]

In a somber voice, the spirit spoke.

[Now, the last step. 29th floor. There's one hidden world there. If you use this in the boss room, you'll find out.]

The spirit waved its fingertip. Transparent energy adhered to Taesan's body.
[You have learned the spirit skill [Natural Resonance].] [Land of the Spirits. Paradise for those who escaped. What's there. The roots of the trees that sustain that land. Bring them to me. With just that... it's almost over.]

Taesan left the room. Laughter continued behind him.

[You've done wrong. You. You......]

Ignoring the sobbing voice, Taesan stepped outside.

"I wonder how this will turn out."

He couldn't understand why the ecstatic spirits hated the spirits. Even if he asked, they showed no signs of answering.

He thought he might find out once he reached the 29th floor.

He climbed up to the 20th floor to find the blacksmith, Hafran.

"Have you come?"

Hafran seemed to have been waiting and handed over a pair of shoes.

"Take these."

"Already made?"

"Refining the ore itself was difficult. But syncing it with the spirit's nucleus made it easier to craft."

The shoes made of colorless ore exuded a strange energy. It seemed to be imbued with the energy of spirit stones.
[Shoes made from Golem Ore and tempered with spirits] [Attack +15] [Defense +40] [Agility +30] [Movement Speed +15%] [Action Speed +8%] [Can contain the essence of spirits.] [Crafted by a skilled blacksmith from valuable materials.]

An Attack stat of 15 was attached to shoes, which weren't even weapons.

The Defense stat was higher than the armor currently worn.

On top of that, there was Agility +30, a stat never seen on any equipment before. Taesan chuckled as he checked them over and a particular sentence caught his eye.

"Can contain the essence of spirits."

"What's this part about?"

"Exactly as it says. Think of it like the same as imbuing a warrior's weapon."

A ghostly weapon. Calvert's relic was imbued with magic that put a spark into flames. These shoes were also bound to the spirits, but it could hold something else.

"I don't know what to put in here, but it will be available to bring to.”

  unto told even So voiced the Let bufio
"I see, so this is it. My curiosity has been satisfied."

[Shoes made from Golem Ore and tempered with spirits] [Attack +15] [Defense +40] [Agility +30] [Movement Speed +15%] [Action Speed +8%] [Can release oneself from all constraints. This skill can only be used once a day.] [Crafted by a skilled blacksmith from valuable materials.]

"Wow."

Taesan exclaimed in admiration. It possessed quite a powerful ability.

It was a kind of status removal technique. He wasn't sure how far the limits of "all constraints" extended, but judging by the description, it seemed quite extensive.

Being able to release oneself momentarily was a significant advantage in battle. Moreover, with a cooldown of just once a day, it was a rather impressive skill.

Hapran seemed satisfied too, sporting a joyful smile.

"It's been fun working on something interesting for a change. It would be great if others brought in unique materials like you do, though they often claim they're useless."

Hapran extended his hand.

"That'll be three thousand gold. Pay up."
"If the equipment is this level, then three thousand gold was quite cheap for the production cost."

Taesan handed it over willingly. Hapran happily accepted the gold and counted it.

"Well, if you find more in the future, bring it over. I'll make it cheap for you."

"Thanks for your work."

Taesan left Hapran's room and quickly descended to the 24th floor.

[24th Floor Quest Begins.] [Defeat the boss of the 24th floor and proceed.] [Reward: Staff of Ba'al] [Secret Reward: ???]

Now, they were approaching the mid-point of the 20th floor.

The monsters on the 24th floor were spirits of darkness. They engulfed their bodies in black light, making it quite challenging for adventurers with low stats. Taesan dealt with them one by one as he moved forward.

Around halfway through, he sensed a presence. Pausing in his monster clearing, Taesan muttered to himself.

"It's about time they showed up."

"I can't ruin the fun sightseeing. I'll hide for a moment."

A ghost clung to the labyrinth ceiling, its position nearly imperceptible unless one focused.

"Huh?"

The door opened, and an adventurer entered. Seeing Taesan, they looked surprised.

"Who are you?"
"A man with blonde hair asked. Instead of answering, Taesan activated his skill.

[You have activated Reconnaissance.] [Horian Arvan] [Level: 65] [Health: 3213] [Equipped Weapon: Sword] [Submissive One.]

Information that hadn't been visible before appeared. This was the power of reconnaissance.

'His health is about the same.'

There was a 10-level difference in their levels. Despite the enhancement in stats, Taesan was slightly higher in health.

It was evidence of the trials Taesan had undergone. Horian frowned at Taesan's silent response.

"Who are you? Are you from the Second Tier? How dare you sneak in here? You must be ready to die."

The rules of the Guides of Sin were absolute. The moment someone from the Second Tier set foot below the 20th floor, they were immediately targeted for execution.

Yet, there were those who dared to descend despite the risks. Enthralled by strength, they staked their lives and paid the price.

Horian believed Taesan to be one of those. He assumed Taesan didn't know his face because he wasn't interested in the Second Tier.

Taesan shook his head.

"I'm not a Guide of Sin."
"If it's not him, then who? You couldn't have come up here without catching their attention. Just quietly perish."

Thinking Taesan was lying, Horian spoke bluntly and kicked out.

The strength disparity between the adventurer on the 30th floor and the one on the 24th was clear. Moreover, having stayed long on the 30th floor, he had become a formidable adventurer to the limit. Naturally, he believed Taesan wouldn't be able to block a single blow.

Taesan moved his hand.

The tip of his sword met Horian's sword, and the trajectory of power shook as it connected.

"Wha-what?"

Horian's arm opened. Helplessly, it opened smoothly without resistance, and Horian stupidly stood there, unable to grasp the situation.

Taesan's fist shook. Horian's face crumpled.
