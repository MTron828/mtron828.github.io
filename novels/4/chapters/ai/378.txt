Chapter 379

379. 78th Floor, Library of the Omniscient (4)

Taesan left a bewildered Jorge behind and entered the secret room. The ghost, who had finally come to his senses, asked.

"What's going on? How did you find this place so quickly?"

"You already know."

"What's... Ah."

The ghost also realized late.

The ghost knew that Taesan had turned back time. And that one adventurer was involved in the process.

The ghost shut his mouth. Taesan passed through the corridor and entered the room.

In the small room, there was one book.

Taesan grasped the book.

"[Analysis of reading methods for deep exploration of knowledge.]"

Taesan took the book and went outside. He showed the book to Jorge, who was staring at him blankly.

"Have you read this?"

"......No."

Jorge shook his head.

"I've never seen this book before."

"I see."

"How did you find that place right away?"

Jorge couldn't understand.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This was the domain of Metis. The power of reconnaissance didn't work here. To discover the secret room, one needed pure judgment, time, and luck.

But to think that I found the secret room right away.

"You're......"

"I have my own method, you see."

Taesan sat down in a chair and opened a book. The content of the book was as titled. It wasn't very interesting, but it was readable enough.

And after reading the entire book, Taesan was able to acquire a skill.

[You have acquired the special passive skill [Speed Reading].]

"Unbelievable."

It was a book that allowed one to acquire a related skill just by reading it. That's why it was hidden in the secret room.

Taesan, who had acquired the skill, handed the book over to Horhe. Horhe, still in shock, received the book.

"I acknowledge it. I don't know how you found it, but you brought a book I couldn't read. Congratulations. You've met the clear condition for the 78th floor."

Now Taesan could head down to the 79th floor at any time.

"You can go down or stay here and accumulate knowledge. Do as you please."

"I'll do that."

Taesan moved between the bookshelves again.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Instead of reading a book, Jorge seemed to be searching for something, and his expression changed as he opened his mouth.

"...... Ah, you're..."

"I found it."

Rattle!

The bookshelf moved, revealing a passageway beyond.

[You have discovered the second secret room.] [First Discovery Bonus] [Strength + 100] [Agility + 100] [Intelligence + 100]

"......"

Jorge was now at a loss for words.

* * *

Taesan continued to search around the library, and soon found six secret rooms.

[You have discovered the sixth secret room.] [First Discovery Bonus] [Attack Power + 50] [Defense Power + 50] [Haha.]

The ghost couldn't help but be amazed.

[It was roughly expected, but... this is surprising.]

The ghost knew about Taesan.

Taesan had sometimes talked about her, but it was the Taesan who was realized in the trials of the God of Despair that made a big impression.

It was just one meeting, but the ghost knew what kind of person Taesan was.

She was someone who was afraid and wanted to run away, but couldn't abandon her responsibilities and eventually moved forward.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was Lee Tae-yeon, who was seen as a ghost.

I knew she had the talent to clear the labyrinth, but compared to Taesan, I thought she was significantly lacking.

However, this was beyond my expectations.

The ghost didn't even notice that there was a secret room here. It wasn't just him; other adventurers would also be the same. Finding a secret room in a vast, unexplored library where reconnaissance didn't work was a nearly impossible task.

But Lee Tae-yeon found not one, but multiple secret rooms here.

[In some sense, you're even more amazing than I am.]

"You're amazing."

Although she scolded herself, she was indeed an amazing person.

What she had talked about on the 78th floor was a long time ago, but Taesan still roughly remembered the location.

At that time, Lee Tae-yeon was so enthusiastic that she would often share her stories with people in the community. Her writing, which was almost like spam, was etched in Taesan's brain.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Although it had been a long time and I couldn't remember exactly, I had the ability to find it myself if I had some rough information, even now.

"......It's really amazing."

George, who was watching him, also muttered to himself. He had been following Tae-san since he found the second secret room, putting down the book he was reading.

Kugugung!

[You have discovered the seventh secret room.]

Tae-san tried to enter as usual.

But the passage refused Tae-san. His body was pushed back.

Tae-san looked at the passage.

A faint, trembling power was rejecting visitors.

[The secret room of the gods.] [You cannot enter without the permission of the gods.]

"What is this?"

"I told you. There is knowledge that can be obtained only by those who are qualified. The room of the gods in front of you is one of them."

George explained.

"This is called the Library of the Gods, where you can also obtain information about the gods. But it's not something anyone can access. You need to get permission from the gods to access it. In fact, it's impossible. Give up."

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Itaewon said such words. He found the room of secrets but couldn't enter on some occasions, they say.

Taesan raised his hand on the passageway.

The force guarding the passageway trembled, as if observing its opponent.

At the same time, Taesan felt a gaze from beyond the force. It was a familiar gaze, one he had felt many times before.

The owner of the gaze smiled, intermittently.

And at the same time, the constraint on the force guarding the passageway disappeared.

"...that's impossible."

Ho Rhee's eyes shook.

Taesan went inside. There lay a sphere shining with black energy.

The sphere surged towards Taesan.

[You have acquired the special constant trigger skill [Traces of Darkness].]

Skill acquisition.

At the same time, a memory surged into Taesan's mind.

* * *

After that, Taesan continued to search for the room of secrets, and he was able to find a few more rooms related to gods, like the room of Marin.

The god of strife and death, Lakirathas, and the god of victory, Baltazah.

Both allowed Taesan to access their rooms of secrets, so he was able to obtain rewards without much difficulty.

Somehow, Taesan had found over fifteen rooms of secrets.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Jorge watched his appearance without saying a word.

"What the heck is this guy?"

He was extremely shocked.

He knew that Taesan was strong. The library of Mansang was his territory. It was natural to assess the power of visitors. He had already grasped that Taesan had power beyond mortality.

It was an astonishing event, but he didn't panic. This was a place where even strong people who had passed the 78th floor continued to visit. There were even stronger individuals staying here.

However, when Taesan continued to find the secret rooms, even Jorge couldn't help but be shocked.

No matter how excellent his analytical abilities were, it would take at least a few months to find one, but Taesan had found over ten secret rooms in an instant.

He also considered the possibility that someone might have told him, but these were secrets that no one had discovered. It was impossible to hear it from someone else.

And that wasn't the end.

Divine recognition.

Jorge, the administrator of this place, knew. The library of Mansang had information about multiple gods, making it an important place for the gods as well.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But God directly granted permission to possess knowledge that contained his own secrets.

It meant that they evaluated him as an existence worthy of being their confidant, surpassing even the great mountain.

And it was a god who said so, not just one, but three.

'How interesting.'

Horge's eyes sparkled.

He was a seeker who had gone mad for knowledge.

After craving and longing for knowledge to the end, he received recognition from the god of knowledge and became the administrator of this place.

And now, the existence called Taesan was stimulating his thirst for knowledge. Horge quietly observed Taesan.

Taesan, who had been searching for the secret room, paused for a moment. He had obtained enough. He planned to organize what he had obtained and start searching again.

The initial discovery bonus wasn't that big, but since it was 15 times, it became a significant number. That alone had value in searching for the secret room.

The rewards Taesan obtained were five books, seven items, and a set of god's secrets and skills.

The seven items were all equipment related to magic and dark magic. He planned to offer them as tributes."

Let me know if you have any further questions or need any clarification!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The five books were skills that helped accumulate knowledge. They didn't seem to have a big impact on battles.

Since they were of no great use, I handed them all over to Horhe after acquiring them. Horhe received them with a satisfied expression.

The divine secret rewards were also quite useful. Each one allowed me to obtain a skill that matched it.

In the case of Masin, it was a skill that increased the power of dark magic. Rakiratas' skill was one that temporarily boosted stats when on the brink of death.

From the God of Victory, Baltazar, I obtained a skill that granted additional stats when facing the same type of monster after defeating a certain number of them.

All of them were passive skills, so I didn't need to worry about using them. Overall, they were quite useful skills.

And in the secret room related to the gods, I obtained memories along with the skills.

At the time, I couldn't understand them because they were all jumbled up, but now that my thoughts are organized, I can understand them.

They were the memories of the gods from when they were mortals.

I suppose this is why I need to receive the gods' recognition to access them.

It was a moment when Taesan was slowly recalling his memories.

Thud. Thud.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I heard a rustling sound. A presence was approaching."

Horhe scowled.

"That annoying old man has come."

"Don't be like that, Horhe."

A voice echoed in my memory, but the emotions contained within were vastly different.

The voice had no power.

The old man with a golden beard appeared between the bookshelves with a vacant expression.

"We'll be together for a long time, so let's build a good relationship."

"I have no intention of building a relationship with a lunatic."

Horhe said bluntly, his face showing clear disdain for the old man.

But the old man didn't seem to care.

He simply sat down in a chair, seemingly unaware of the towering figure beside him.

The old man's behavior was strange. Finally, Taesan spoke up.

"Hello."

"Hm?"

The old man only then noticed Taesan.

The old man's eyes widened as he took in Taesan's face.

"......Have you already arrived here?"

"It's been a while. Ainzhar."

[You have encountered a god-seeker.]

* * *

Ainzhar.

"Ha, haha!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ainzachar, who had seen the mountain, laughed.

"Wow, you're fast. As I expected, you're a talented person. You've reached this place so quickly!"

"I worked hard, so I was able to find what you wanted."

The beloved goddess, the holy knight who had entered the labyrinth to find Revinenov.

The mountain told him where Revinenov was, and it was right here. It was the 78th floor.

Even though a considerable amount of time had passed, Ainzachar was still here. It was unclear whether he had achieved his goal.

"......Did you find what you wanted?"

Ainzachar's face suddenly changed.

"Yes, I found it. I found it."

He smiled brightly, as if there was nothing to worry about. But in that overly bright expression, the mountain felt a sense of discomfort.

"It's all thanks to you. I've found Lord Revinenov."

"......Is that so? Congratulations."

Something felt off.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Tesan remembered Einsenhart. He had faith in his own god in a fanatical way, but he was otherwise a sane person. He was always energetic and his actions and thoughts were in harmony.

However, something was off about him now. It was hard to put into words, but it seemed like he was putting on a calm facade in front of Tesan.

"...that's convenient."

Einsenhart extended his hand for a handshake, with a strange smile on his face directed towards Tesan.

"How about joining me to meet Levinenof?"
