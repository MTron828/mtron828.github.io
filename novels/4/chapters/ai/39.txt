40. 6th Floor, The Humble Seeker of Magic (2)

[Yongke, you're here?]

"I'm the expert on secret chambers, aren't I? Came to the right place."

Lilith boasted proudly. The ghost chuckled.

"Then the old man must have seen it too, what did he say?"

Lilith's expression revealed a hint of unease.

"Well... Even after all this time, he hasn't changed. It's frustrating. There are lives like that too, you know, why does he do that?"

Lilith grumbled. The dwarf seemed to disdain her as well. She glanced at the towering mountain with sparkling eyes.

"Wow. But did you really catch that... It looked even more disgusting from the side."

Probably talking about the boss on the 5th floor. He indeed passed without catching it. With invisibility magic, nothing was strange. Lee Taeyeon also came down from the floor judged impossible to clear in a similar manner.

But it wasn't a good way.
Let's see it from a clearance perspective. Missing out on the 5th floor clearance reward is the worst choice, where one not only misses the rewards but also receives contempt from the gods. However, since Lilith doesn't set her sights on clearing, she could proceed without any burden.

Taesan glanced discreetly at the box behind her. Lilith noticed and clapped her hands.

"Oh, right. You can take that. I found it first, but I wouldn't have gotten here without you."

"Then I'll gladly take it."

The secret chamber reward. It was regrettable to miss out like this, but it worked out well.

"Well then."

She dusted off a chair and plopped down on it. Crossing her legs, she rested her chin on her hand.

She looked down at Taesan as if he were a great archmage. But knowing she didn't have that much power made it look ridiculous. The ghost asked with a chuckle.

"What are you doing?"

"Just striking a pose. Hmm. Should we get started?"

Taesan nodded.

The reason he came here was to learn magic. Lilith grinned.

"Shall we start with an explanation then? What magic is."

---

"What's your name?"

"Kang Taesan."

"Kang Taesan. Then I'll call you Taesan. Taesan, you have skills, right? How did you acquire them?"

"I sort of pulled out similar effects."
"Yeah."

Lilith nodded.

"That's exactly how you acquire skills. You use effects without skills. It's a kind of contradiction. Magic is different from that. It's about receiving or extracting. That's why magic can have things that skills don't."

Skills need to draw out effects. So, skills that are physically impossible to obtain are unobtainable. That was the general idea.

She waved her hand. Flames flickered softly.

"Creating flames, cutting through space, bending time. Magic can do what skills cannot. It might sound absurd coming from someone who hasn't even reached the 10th floor, but the value here is not insignificant. Take the invisibility spell I'm using right now. You can't get this with a skill, right?"

I knew. To get even a second-long invisibility cloak, you have to go deep. Just being able to use transparency without any special restrictions proves the effectiveness of magic.

The brave man hesitated.
[Not just using magic, buffs or enchantments can be quite helpful too. They're similar to skills but in a different direction of power. Their value is considerable and overflowing.]

"Yeah. That's magic! And I'm the one who taught you this."

"What are you trying to say?"

"Nothing else."

She twiddled her fingers.

"Well, you're obviously much stronger than me, but I'm in the position of teaching you, right? So, um... you're like my disciple, correct?"

Desperately seeking agreement, Taesan nodded his head.

"If that's what you say, then yes."

Taesan wasn't particularly concerned about such titles. He simply accepted, satisfying Lilith who smiled contentedly. She cautiously continued.

"So, if you're my disciple, you shouldn't just address me casually, right? Um, you should use honorifics and such, right?"

"You want me to address you with honorifics?"

"...It would be nice if you did!"

She seemed desperate for it. Taesan chuckled.

If she wanted respect, he could give it. He hadn't paid much attention to titles before. Learning magic through respect would be highly beneficial.

The dormant spirit spoke up.

["I can't even get respect, and you expect to receive it?"]

"Uh, um?"
Lilith froze for a moment.

"Well, you're not in a position to teach as a hero..."

["I decided to teach this guy swordsmanship?"]

Lilith's pupils dilated.

"Really? You've turned down everyone else so far."

["It's my decision. Why do you want to receive it when even I can't?"]

"Why? Will you do it?"

["I don't need it."]

The spirit declined. Lilith's pupils shook violently for a moment before she seemed to give up, her shoulders slumping.

"Fine. No need for formalities... I could have received respect for the first time. Why reject it..."

["What are you mumbling about?"]

"Oh, no. It's nothing."

She quickly regained her composure and continued with her explanation.

"Alright, let's start with the basics. What do you think magic is?"

"Mystery and skills."

Lilith nodded approvingly at Taesan's answer.

"Exactly. It's literally mystery. But here, it exists in the form of skills. That's why even someone like me can learn. Look."

She spread her hand, flames suddenly erupted.

"What do you see here?"
Taesan, who had been glancing around, shook his head. To him, it was just a fireball.

"There's nothing here."

"That's how magic looks to those without talent. It just seems like a natural phenomenon."

"Am I talentless too?"

"That might be different for you?"

Lilith extinguished the flames she held.

"You came from a place without magic, right? People from there didn't know at all. It's natural not to know for those who simply don't have it."

"I see."

It wasn't a particularly curious topic.

Lilith got to the point.

"So, when it comes to learning magic, the way is simple. You make a contract with the deity of magic."

"A contract?"

"Yeah. I came here and was mumbling around for a few months when suddenly the deity of magic appeared to me. And bestowed upon me the ability to use magic. After that, I could use magic."

"...Do I have to make a contract to learn too?"

It was a daunting topic for Taesan, who had rejected all contracts from the apostles. Fortunately, Lilith denied Taesan's words.

"No. There's no need for that. I'm here."

She said with a sigh.
"Magic can be taught to those who do not possess it. That's the advantage of the labyrinth. Generally, gods themselves don't directly teach. Even the warrior seemed surprised by me, didn't he?"

"They only care about the strong or the insane. Your interest in magic is madness, so the deity of magic will surely take an interest too."

"Hehe."

"Not a compliment?"

Lilith gently placed her hand on Taesan's shoulder with a soft smile.

"I'll teach you right away."

Power flowed into Taesan.

"You have received magic as a humble seeker of magic. You have obtained [Magic]. You have obtained [Magic Bestowal]. You have obtained [Magic Extraction]."

"Let's see if you've learned properly."

Taesan opened his skill window.

[Magic] [Proficiency: 1%] [You can use magic. Right now, you might only be able to light a spark.] [Magic Bestowal] [Proficiency: 1%] [You can bestow magic.] [Magic Extraction] [Proficiency: 1%] [You can extract magic.]

It was a simple declaration. Lilith waved her hand and created flames again.

"How is it?"

"...It feels different."

Something was visible within the flames. A sensation he had never felt even in his past life.

This is magic.
He tried various things, but ultimately what he couldn't learn was magic, and yet he learned it so easily.

"In fact, it's not that important here. You learn it anyway through skills. Now I have to explain how to learn magic."

Simply possessing magic isn't enough.

You need to have appropriate magic for yourself.

"There are a few ways, but the easiest is to extract it from objects imbued with magical power. Like a magic wand or magical tool. Extracting from such items is the easiest, right?"

"Like this?"

Taesan pulled out a wand of flames. Lilith was slightly surprised.

"You already have one? Then you can extract from there. Give it a try."

Taesan placed his hand on the wand of flames.

"You have activated Magic Extraction."

The power contained within the wand seeps into Taesan's hand. It slowly spreads throughout his body.

"You have obtained basic magic [Fireball]. [Wand of Flames] A wand used by novice wizards. The magic power contained within has been released."

The explanation of the fireball contained in the wand disappeared.

"Skill window."
[Basic Magic: Fireball] [Mana Cost: 3] [Proficiency: 9%] [Fires a fireball. Inflicts greater damage on non-immune targets. Attempts to inflict [Burn] status ailment on the target.]

It felt just like using the Wand of Flames. Taesan inserted the wand and extended his hand.

"You have activated Fireball."

Boom.

Flames burst into the air.

"So this is how it works."

"Feels like that. Got the hang of it?"

Lilith watched with a pleased expression. Taesan also extracted magic from the Wand of Random Spirit Attacks at random.

"You have acquired Basic Magic [Random Spirit Attack]." [Basic Magic: Random Spirit Attack] [Mana Cost: 5] [Uses a random harmful mental magic on the target. Attempts to inflict status ailment.]

He had learned two types of magic.

"This is great."

He could cast magic without switching wands. This was a significant advantage. It meant he could freely use magic during combat, creating variables as he wished.

In short, even using only consecutive random spirit attacks after they've stuck, there might be a gap. The disappearance of the delay was what that meant.

But he was still not satisfied.

"How do I learn the rest?"
There were still plenty of really good magics left.

"One. Learning from those who have already learned magic. And the other is paying a price to the gods of magic to learn it. That's why I haven't learned any special magic. Even learning the invisibility spell was a huge ordeal, you know?"

She grumbled and glanced at Taesan.

"So, since you're my disciple, if you gain something while going down, or something like that, come back to me..."

"I'll keep that in mind."

As Lilith learned magic, she could also gain new spells. It was a mutually beneficial deal. Lilith jumped up.

"Great! Finally, I can learn new magic! This tedious 10th floor is finally over!"

She spun around like she was dancing with joy. Seeing her almost manic happiness, Taesan asked her.

"So, are there any spells you can learn right now?"

"Huh?"

"The spells you have. I want to learn them."

She used the invisibility spell. Not just one. She could learn quite useful magic.

But Lilith looked unsure.
"Hmm... This is a bit different. Did I mention? It requires a price."

"So, it's not just a price for you to learn magic?"

"That's a bit different. Teaching a basic skill of magic without a price is one thing. But when it comes to teaching specific basic spells or types, the story changes a bit."

Lilith twisted her hair.

"If you've made a pact with a god, that's right. You can just learn. But for me, who hasn't, it's a situation where I have to receive. I can teach the essence of magic itself, but... I can't casually teach specific spells because those are things I've received."

"So, you need a price for that?"

"Yeah. I need permission to offer a tribute and teach you. That's the only way you can learn magic."

Taesan summarized.

"So, to learn magic you don't know, you need both an offering to the god and an offering to me?"

Lilith replied hesitantly.

"Um... Is that how it goes?"

"That's quite demanding."

Still, magic has its worth.

"What counts as an offering? Can it be materials?"
"No, materials won't work. It must be something special. A weapon with a unique value. That's what becomes the offering."

"Weapons or equipment?"

"Can you put it that way? The more precious it is, the better magic you can obtain."

So, it wasn't a bad deal after all.

In simple terms of value, materials are more expensive. Equipment cannot fetch its true value when sold in stores.

Without a blacksmith and no room in the inventory, I was just selling it off cheaply.
