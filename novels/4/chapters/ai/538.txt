**Chapter 539**

**539. The Pantheon of Gods (5)**

Rakiratas charges forward. The transcendent being and the heterogeneous existence rush towards each other.

Taesan activates his authority.

*Ki-ii-ii-ing!*

A strange wave envelops the entire realm.

And Rakiratas's body, which was flying, comes to a sudden halt.

[Huh?]

Rakiratas is taken aback for a moment. His body loses acceleration and stops in its tracks. Taesan, who has closed in, raises his sword. The ash-colored sword flashes.

Rakiratas doesn't flinch and swings his axe.

The axe and sword clash.

*Ka-aa-aa-ang!*

And the one who flies away is Rakiratas. He is sent flying to the far end of the realm.

Rakiratas tries to quickly regain his footing. He lands on the ground, using friction to stop his flying body.

But it doesn't work.

It's as if his body is on ice, refusing to stop. Rakiratas strikes his axe into the ground, but it doesn't stick.

[Hmm.]

The reason it doesn't stick is not something else.

It's because his power has been extinguished.

[Is this interference?]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan governs the physical power of the universe itself.

Taesan had been eliminating the physical power that appeared in all his actions. Although he had blocked Taesan's flying attack, he flew back again.

[It's possible to utilize physical power in this way too. It's interesting.]

Rakiratas felt a sense of relief through his arm and laughed pleasantly.

[Rakiratas initiated a struggle.]

In an instant, a swirling red aura enveloped Rakiratas' body.

Kuuuuung!

Rakiratas charged forward. He ignored Taesan's physical power and swung his axe roughly.

KaAAAang!

Taesan's body was pushed back. Rakiratas didn't stop.

"What's going on?"

Taesan had clearly used his physical power to restrict Rakiratas' actions themselves.

He had made all of Rakiratas' actions, including stepping forward, accelerating, and swinging his axe, physically impossible.

But now, Rakiratas was ignoring Taesan's power and charging forward.

Tzzzzz!

A strong impact spread throughout Taesan's entire body. Taesan's body was pushed back. Through a series of exchanges, Taesan realized something.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Rakiratas was not moving with physical strength right now.

It was acting solely on the power of struggle. It was closer to overlaying the concept of power with its own concept.

The axe was swung.

Taesan took a step forward.

With the sword in hand, he poured strength into it, moved his waist, and moved his shoulders.

He infused all his actions with physical strength.

Whoa!

Two opposing powers collided.

And what broke through was Taesan. Physical strength was crushed by the power of struggle. Taesan quickly raised a cloud of dust and wrapped his body in it.

Kukukuku!

Taesan drew his boundaries even tighter. With all his might, he staked his life.

Kagakaga!

Yet, the dust was pierced.

The axe clashed with its own immutability. Its immutability was rapidly consumed.

[You activated Blink.]

Tat.

He created distance.

Rakiratas swung the axe with a joyful face.

[This much can be blocked, I think.]

"I don't think I can say I've blocked this."

Struggle and physical strength. The power itself was clearly of equal rank.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, the difference lay in how they wielded that power. The fundamental difference in skill level was overwhelming, and there was a huge gap in the stability of the realm itself.

[It's about time I got warmed up. Then, I'll use up what's left.]

With those words, death occurred.

‘……That’s.’

Taesan had experience fighting against Derusha. Therefore, he knew what Derusha's death was like.

Derusha's death was brutal and cold-blooded.

But at the same time, it was calm. It was a dispassionate, emotionless ending to life.

However, the death that Lakiratas was summoning was different.

The death that occurred was hostile towards its surroundings. It struggled, wailed, and killed everything that approached it.

It was literally a destruction of all living things.

The death that Lakiratas controlled was a death by struggle.

Derusha, who was watching from beyond the realm, scowled.

[This doesn't sit well with me.]

She muttered with a displeased expression.

She was the goddess of death.

She governed the vast concept of death that had existed since the creation of the universe.

However, Lakiratas managed death through struggle.

And that death was different from Derusha's.

[That's not death.]

The death that was summoned was closer to brutal violence.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[The death I dominate is a death that occurs through struggle.]

Blackness wraps around Rakiratas's axe.

[My power is not flashy like that of other transcendents. It's just simple.]

Violence in the name of struggle and death.

That's all it was.

It's impossible to govern the concept of magic like a demon, influencing all magical beings in the world, or to force and erase choices like a god, restricting actions.

No. It's possible. Dominating a concept means exactly that.

But Rakiratas didn't desire such utilization.

He just wanted violence.

Pure power, overwhelming struggle.

And with that alone, Rakiratas reached a realm where no transcendent could ignore him.

With struggle and death wrapped around him, Rakiratas charged towards the great mountain. The great mountain grasped its sword. The ash-colored waves swept in like a storm.

Rakiratas didn't back down.

Haaaaah!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The boundary that has gained overwhelming superiority, having obtained transcendence, is shattered by Rakiratas's axe. Taesan concentrates his strength and swings his fist, but Rakiratas doesn't stop.

He destroys everything and crushes it, charging towards Taesan. In an instant, the gray dust is pierced.

The axe is swung. Rakiratas's self-immutable body is shattered in an instant.

[Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.]

The attack nullification is activated. However, Rakiratas's body does not return. The system that intervenes with death, which has been set up throughout his body, has been destroyed.

Kwaaaah!

Taesan clenches his fist and shakes it.

With a loud crash, Taesan's body is blown back.

Rakiratas doesn't stop. He only wields violence, advancing to kill Taesan.

His heart beats rapidly. His entire body enters a state of tension, and his head accelerates.

Rakiratas is stronger than Taesan.

That's clear.

He can die here. That's a high probability.

It's something that has always been possible. There's nothing to be surprised about.

The only difference is that Taesan has now become his complete self.

He responds to his emotions. He brings out everything he has.

But he doesn't lose his calm.

"Let's try it."

Kwaaaah!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Rakiratas is coming. The power of struggle and death unites as one and is infused into the axe.

It breaks through all boundaries and advances forward.

Taesan has transcended the boundaries. A deep, dark gray color appears in the world.

And it manipulates the boundaries.

The boundaries slowly lose their color and the boundary lines gradually fade away. As the color fades, it transforms into a colorless, formless energy.

It's trembling.

It's worthless. The power of the gods is now being realized in the world as a boundary.

Taesan grasped the worthlessness and swung it. Everything in the world began to lose its meaning.

And Rakiratas burst out laughing.

[You worthless being! What a nostalgic power!]

The worthlessness that makes all things meaningless.

Rakiratas' response to it was extremely simple.

He just charged towards the worthlessness with his body. The worthlessness erased Rakiratas' struggle and death.

But something even greater,

A power that can cover the entire world appears.

With pure, brutal force, it exceeds the critical point that the worthlessness can erase and pierces through. The axe is swung wildly.

Kwaaaaaa!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Your second absolute nullification of the opponent's attack is activated.]

Taesan quickly creates distance. He gathers his boundaries again and spreads them wide.

"Stop."

The world's time comes to a halt.

The power of the Time Walker. Time freeze. Rakiratas's body momentarily freezes. Taesan quickly charges forward, attempting to strike with his sword.

Just as he approaches, Rakiratas's entire body is suddenly enveloped in a powerful aura.

Crushing the frozen time and killing it, Rakiratas forcibly fills that realm with new time.

[He's also experienced that power before.]

Kaahhh!

The frozen time shatters.

To be precise, it's more like it died. Rakiratas strikes Taesan, who's charging at him, with an axe.

Kwahhh!

[Your third absolute nullification of the opponent's attack is activated.]

Keeeing!

This time, he compresses his boundaries. Dozens of orbs manifest in the world and charge towards Rakiratas.

And they shatter again.

Rakiratas's death forcibly crushes and destroys the boundaries.

"Hmm."

Taesan quickly creates distance again. His eyes have sunk.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This also doesn't work, does it?"

The one who lacked strength was not him. Rather, he had a weakness.

Then, he tried to overcome that weakness.

Rakiratas charged forward, and Taesan responded to him.

Taesan tried to bring out all the power he had, one by one, to counterattack.

His actions seemed like he was experimenting with his own power against Rakiratas.

Even though he had to risk his life, he was conducting various experiments. It was unpleasant, but Rakiratas laughed as if he was delighted.

"Good! Consider me a tool! Test your power on me! But if you can't prove it, you'll die!"]

With a loud cry, the figure of struggle and death loomed over Taesan. Taesan brought out his ash-colored power.

* * *

Kwaaaang!

Taesan used many methods.

He controlled his ash-colored power, brought out his physical strength, and wielded his authority. He did everything to test his power and defeat Rakiratas.

But in the end, he couldn't help but be pushed back.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The pure violence of struggle and death. Rakirates was a being that focused solely on pure power, abandoning all the numerous tricks that great authority could wield.

It even grasped and crushed the boundaries with its power.

Kwaaaang!

Taesan's body was blown away. Although the boundary barely managed to intervene, half of his limbs were about to fly off.

Thump.

His heart was racing fast. Rakirates swung its axe, drawing a rough line across the world.

If it touched him, he would die. His instincts warned him.

But he didn't back down, instead, he charged forward. With a loud crash, Taesan's body was blown away to a distant place.

And then, he immediately got back up.

His body and mind accelerated and synchronized.

Taesan had clearly reached his own realm.

But even he himself didn't know what he was.

It wasn't just that his realm was incomparable, but there was a bigger reason.

It was because Taesan had never brought out his true self.

By unifying his mind and body, and not thinking of any other distractions, he focused purely on the present moment."

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was happening in this battle. The mind, body, and spirit, which had been feeling disconnected, were now finally coming together as one.

And Taesan suddenly realized.

Taesan raised his hand. Mana began to gather.

[You have activated the colorful, prismatic [Boundary] of various colors.]

The prismatic color, tinged with ash, began to surge. It was a contradictory statement, but there was no other way to express it.

The surging ash-colored prismatic color contained physical strength.

Kwaaaang!

Rakiratas's advance was halted for the first time.

The fusion of powers.

Rakiratas was doing the same thing as Taesan.

And Rakiratas revealed this fact with a satisfied expression.

[It's still not enough! Show me more of yourself! Prove your struggle!]

Rakiratas burst out laughing.

His power became even thicker and stronger. The prismatic color of ash began to shatter and break apart.

Kagagak!

It was clearly the same power. Moreover, his boundary was an otherworldly, transcendent power that surpassed all affinities.

As it became fully his, he reached an even higher level.

But even so, he was still being overwhelmingly pushed back by Rakiratas.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No matter how hard he tried to wield his power, the difference was overwhelmingly crushing.

And the reason was simple.

Taesan was still unable to properly control his own abilities.

He could only bring out half of his true power.

Not only was he still awkward at controlling his abilities, but there was another real reason.

He himself didn't know the true extent of his power.

The beast within him.

He didn't have the confidence to perfectly control it. So, he couldn't fully grasp the essence of his boundaries.

But it wasn't like that now. He had now staked his life against Rakiratas. His spirit, body, and power had become one.

Now, he could control the beast sleeping within him.

"It's me."

Ash-colored earth covered the ground. The beast that had been sleeping within him, growling in dissatisfaction, finally emerged into the world with a roar.

The boundary beast, stepping into the world."
