Episode 70

70. 12th Floor, God of Choice. Maria (2)

Body struck the ground.

Monsters from the ground wave their hands like zombies to target him.

Taesan didn't block.

Invalidating the attack is the target.

In other words, he can block twice against a single opponent unconditionally.

Numerous attacks are launched at Taesan upon landing on the ground, and all are erased.

[Your first attack nullification has been activated.] [Your first attack nullification has been activated.] [Your second attack nullification has been activated.] [Your first attack nullification has been activated.] [Your second attack nullification has been activated.]

Numerous system windows. If not set in advance, it would cover the entire field of view.

Taesan, landing on the ground, moved his sword.

Storm Disaster's first sword. Wolf's Fang.

Crack.

Using the elasticity of his whole body, he bends in all directions. Breaking attempts to block with strength, twisting attempts to avoid and driving them into the neck like a snake.

Deflecting the opponent's attacks, scattering the combination between each other and attacking each other.
"Kaaaah!"

"Swoosh."

In an instant, all the monsters around disappeared.

The monsters were stronger than average, but noticeably weaker than expected. If their numbers were in the hundreds and their power similar, one might have expected a real tough fight.

And it was at times like this that the evidence of struggle shone.

[Your proof of struggle has been activated.]

A skill gained by overcoming the enhanced trial of Lachyratess. With each enemy defeated during combat, health, mana, stats, speedâ€”everything is enhanced.

Facing so many enemies, they were practically invincible.

But this is a trial of the gods. Maria's trial, enhanced by Lachyratess and expected to be on par with it.

Not something to take lightly with just one proof of struggle.

Splat.

[You take 12 damage.]

A long gash appears on Taesan's forearm. Taesan frowned.

"What the..."

A sudden wound had appeared. Judging by the damage received, it wasn't just a scrape from debris.

Unable to block every attack due to their sheer number, Taesan nonchalantly continued the fight.
Splat.

[You take 14 damage.]

But once again, another wound appeared.

This time, there was no mistaking it. The wound had appeared from the direction where he had been challenging the monster. Since there was no sign of magical manifestation, it must have been one.

"Invisible monsters."

Taesan frowned.

"You don't feel anything at all?"

Enhanced senses allowed Taesan to feel even the smallest insects in the grass. Even if it was a stealth monster, its presence should have been vaguely felt, but he truly felt nothing.

In that moment, another wound appeared.

[You take 13 damage.]

As the damage indicator appeared, Taesan moved his sword. He slashed through everything around him like a storm, yet there was no sensation of cutting anything.

"It's not just invisibility."

Whether it could erase its presence here, teleport in an instant, or at least wasn't an easy target, it was none of those.

Taesan quickly made a decision.

"Don't aim for it."
He focused on the monsters attacking him. He pushed them away and knocked them down, ignoring the wounds that appeared again. This time, he didn't even pay attention to them.

The damage inflicted each time wasn't substantial. It was recoverable evidence of his struggle.

So, there was no reason to fixate on it.

As they attacked him in ways he didn't know, he was unfamiliar with how to counterattack.

In such a situation, it was a decision to abandon fixation altogether because he could suffer significant losses if he did it clumsily.

A monster in the form of an enchanting woman laughs.

[The succubus's enchantment has been activated.] [No judgment required!]

Slash.

Taesan crushes his head as it is.

"Is there a succubus too?"

Taesan frowns as he inspects each one.

There were more monsters he had never seen before than the ones he knew.

Literally, all types of monsters existed.

"I get the general idea."

In the worst situation you don't want to experience, bet everything you have to win.

That's what Maria wants. From the other side, the power of the gods joyously descends.

"Show me."

He lightly smiles as he grips his sword.

* * *

The distance he can move is limited.
He prefers to maneuver and evade, finding the current situation incredibly frustrating.

The types of enemies are diverse, requiring careful calculation for each movement.

"Annoying."

But it didn't matter much.

Blocking, thrusting, slashing, he takes down approaching monsters with minimal damage thanks to the Stormscar Sword.

However, there are limits to physical movement. Attacks coming directly from behind are difficult to block.

"Crack!"

A very small monster resembling a mouse aims for Taesan's neck from the ground. The monster jumps and thrusts its beak.

At that moment, flames ignite.

[You have activated Ignition.]

Boom!

"Eeeek!"

The mouse-like monster disappears with a scream. Monsters targeting his back are dealt with using magic. Many monsters die and disappear, but the end seems endless.

"Kwoooh!"

A giant swings a club down. Taesan's ankle momentarily gives in to the block. Against even greater strength, Taesan grits his teeth and pushes back.

[You have activated Strong Strike.]

Boom!

He pushes away the club and blocks incoming blades. Significant damage was taken, but quick responses minimized the losses.
He blocks while assessing the monsters' habits.

Taesan grabs the mouse-like monster aiming for his neck again and hurls it head-on.

The orc, swinging his greatsword, momentarily hesitates and grabs the mouse-like monster, bringing it down.

Thunk.

He confirms piercing through the orc's neck.

Monsters do not attack each other.

Even if it means exposing their own vulnerabilities.

"Whoa!"

The giant swings his club once more.

Taesan leaps forward in an instant. Grabbing the startled goblin by the neck, he hurls it towards the giant. The goblin screams as it faces the incoming club.

"Kweeeek!"

Reacting to the desperate scream, the giant hesitates with his club. Taesan activates Frost Arrow.

[You have activated Magical Acceleration.]

Splat!

The accelerated Frost Arrow pierces through the goblin and the giant.

"Whoaah!"

Taesan charges forward, reaching eye level with the giant. Roaring with pain and rage, the giant swings his club.

Thunk.

Grabbing the club, he climbs further up. Above the giant's head, he brings down his sword.

[153 damage to the giant.]

"Whoaahh!"
The sword pierces through the head and protrudes from the jaw. Instantly, his eyes lose focus and his mouth trembles involuntarily.

When you destroy your own head, it causes massive damage and momentarily destroys intelligence. Taesan moved the sword perilously close to the boundary, and the giant was beaten. The giant collapsed.

[Proof of your struggle has been activated.]

"Kyaah!"

"Kyarruk!"

As he falls after defeating the giant, the monsters target his body. Taesan wrapped his robe.

[You have activated the robe of alchemy. You are in a hidden state for 1 second.]

The body disappears. Monsters with reddened eyes shriek in confusion.

"Kak?"

Taesan, who landed on the ground, moved both hands. The legs of the monsters who did not notice were cut off.

"Kyaah!"

But it didn't end there. Taesan analyzes the situation again with his tongue out.

Monsters tried to keep their order as much as possible. They didn't push forward with weak monsters in front and didn't occupy their place.

Judgment and decisions were quick.

If the weak guys were in front, they left them alone and handled the strong guys first.

There was no room for hesitation in such a situation.
[The skeleton mage activated Fireball.] [The skeleton mage activated Magic Missile.]

Spells flew from the sky. Taesan did not evade.

[You activated Spill.]

Spells grazed Taesan and struck the monsters around him. Meanwhile, unseen monsters were attacking Taesan.

Without paying much attention, he scanned the surroundings. On the left, a lizardman's spear. On the right, a goblin's fist. Ice arrows were flying from the sky.

He plotted trajectories and moved. He grabbed the goblin's fist and shook it vigorously. The goblin's spear collided and broke, and an ice arrow pierced the goblin's leather armor.

Taesan threw himself forward. The skeleton implementing the magic took a hit and fell.

Countless monster corpses lay around.

Taesan did not stop.

* * *

By the time he had taken down 2/3, there were no easy monsters left.

Whether they had strange special abilities or simply withstood his swordsmanship due to their strength, each one he took down came at the cost of his own stamina.
As proof of his struggle, the rate at which his recovery occurred couldn't keep up with the decreasing rate. It had been a long time since all of his attacks were nullified.

The battle continued for thirty minutes like that,

By the time his stamina reached 10%, the end was in sight.

"Phew."

Wiping sweat, he grasped the sword, muttering. Normally, his stamina, which would not tire after an hour of fighting, now showed signs of exhaustion because it was literally an all-out battle.

It wasn't over yet.

Four monsters remained.

"Are you the last ones?"

Clad in red armor, they drew their longswords and surrounded him in all four directions.

Knights of death.

If what Taeyun said was true, they were the bosses of the 20th floor.

That wouldn't be all.

Looking closely, their armors, while similar, were strangely different. Decorations from their human days could be seen on the rusty chest plates.

It seemed the adventurers died here and became knights of death.

"Are they similar to the followers of Rakyaratas? There are four of them, right?"

Each one would likely be stronger than a simple boss of the 20th floor.

Taesan drew the blade of self-harm and stabbed his arm. He recovered 500 stored stamina, but he still wasn't in perfect condition. At best, he was around 60%.
Clang.

The blades aimed at Taesan. Taesan slapped them away with his hand.

"Come at me."

Four swords stabbed at Taesan from all directions.

The swords moved. The crimson blades clashed noisily against Taesan's own sword.

Thunk.

Long gashes appeared on his cheek. It was impossible to block attacks from all directions. Moreover, his opponents were not weak; being skilled swordsmen, naturally, he couldn't avoid getting wounded all over.

If he hadn't learned Storm Scar Swordsmanship, it would have been really tough. Even with it, facing four opponents was challenging.

Bang!

Taesan blocked the swords and activated a skill.

"You have activated Forced Duel."

The system window appeared, wiping out all attacks except those from his target. In that moment, his opponent swiftly moved back. Taesan clicked his tongue.

"Damn restrictions."

If only there weren't spatial constraints, it would have been much easier. He could have just challenged them to a duel and fought until they were defeated.

But due to the restriction that he couldn't go beyond a certain distance, if his opponent immediately backed off, there wasn't much he could do.
Taesan activated Scorching Rage and Frost Arrows. Mixing acceleration and explosions in various ways, he attempted attacks, but none landed.

Although it was uncertain when mixed with battles, it seemed to be sufficient to block attacks with this kind of vigor.

"Hoo."

One fortunate point for him was that evidence of the struggle also restored mana and due to high magic proficiency, mana consumption was greatly reduced, so his mana was almost not depleted.

After the duration of Forced Duel ended, the knights of death rushed in.

Taesan gripped his sword.

"You have activated Spill."

Spill is activated four times in a row. Simultaneously launched attacks are spilled at once.

Taesan swung the sword he held in both hands roughly. The armor of the knights who lost control of their bodies was marked with scars.

"25 damage to Maria's disciple [fake]."

Taesan frowned at the inflicted attack power. Just as with Rakiratas's disciples, their defense was quite high.

The knight with the least damage whammed the sword.

Activate the counter. The body naturally moves and retaliates against the knight's attack. Strike away the sword and strike back. They retreat with a squealing sound from their chest.

Clang.
Here is the English translation of the text:

He lowered his stance and moved his hands roughly. He avoided and deflected the sword aimed at his whole body, but a long scar appeared on his forearm.

"[You receive 56 damage.]"

"As expected, it's impossible to handle four at once."

Taesan calmly assessed the situation, kicking away the knight in front of him and deflecting the attacks of the other knights. The kicked knight quickly thrust his sword.

Taesan extended his arm without blocking.

The sword deeply pierced Taesan's chest.

"[You activated Resilience.] [You receive 73 damage.] [You activated Forced Duel.]"

"I got you."

Whispering to the knight, Taesan grabbed his arm. Realizing something strange, the knight quickly tried to pull away, but Taesan firmly held him, preventing his escape.

He thrusts the sword into the knight's chest. The remaining knights move their swords, but Forced Duel prevents them from hitting.

The knight manages to evade and withstand somehow. The duration of Forced Duel is 10 seconds. If he focuses only on evading, it might be possible to endure.

"[You activated Forced Duel.]"

With one more round, the problem could be resolved. Unable to withstand the continued attacks, the knight collapses.

One down, three to go.
Here is the English translation of the text:

"Hmm."

Taesan blocked the attack with a dubious expression.

Taesan's health had taken a significant hit. He had taken constant damage, and the last attack was decisive. Resilience had halved the damage, but he still took 70 points.

Remaining health was about 150.

Now, even a single hit could be fatal.

He focused his mind even more and moved his body.

* * *

Though they were now three, the attacks were relentless, making it difficult to find openings. Unlike before, if he countered with some losses, he could fight back, but his health was now dangerously low. He moved his sword to the extreme with utmost caution, blocking and deflecting every attack.

Clang!

Swords clashed and bounced off each other. Taesan immediately moved another sword to block the attack from the left. He smoothly pulled the blocked sword and deflected the attack from the right.

His body moved ahead of his thoughts.

Ka-ga-gak!

Block the sword.

Deflect it.

Counterattack.

He repeated these three actions mechanically.
Here is the English translation of the text:

At some point, the use of skills ceased. He simply blocked all attacks with just his sword.

In a moment of realization,

"It's a bit rough."

He swung his sword forcefully with both hands. Stormscar's sword surged like a storm, pressuring the opponent and preemptively blocking their attacks, a swordsmanship that gained advantage on this side.

Among them, the first sword technique, Wolf's Fang, was a ruthless technique that slashed at the opponent like a wolf, pressuring them.

"Can I do this a bit more gently?"

With a slight question, Taesan moved the sword.

Unlike earlier, the movement was smooth.

"Oh?"

The ghost silently watching couldn't help but let out a sigh of admiration.
