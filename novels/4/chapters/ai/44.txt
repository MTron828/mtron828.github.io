45. 7th Floor, Sword of the Fallen World (2)

"No defense? Just fighting by taking hits?"

[If you only consider theory.]

"It doesn't seem like a particularly good swordsmanship."

In the first place, you can't call it swordsmanship if there's no defense. The ghost explained patiently.

"Just listen for now. Not defending doesn't mean not blocking attacks at all. You know the saying, the best defense is a good offense? It's similar to that. Blocking by attacking where the opponent is going to move the sword. It's aggressive defense, so to speak."

"Hmm."

Taesan had used swords a lot, so he understood the meaning of those words.

"But there are definitely attacks that can't be blocked."

By attacking predictively to anticipate the opponent's movements, they prevent them from attacking. The words sound good. But in the end, this is the movement of attack. You can't perfectly block it.

"You're just taking hits."

"......"

"Instead, it's more about attacking than that. All tactics for that are also ready."

"It's not stable swordsmanship."
[It might be dangerous. But the power is certain. I haven't deeply learned magic. The god was awfully picky. I stopped at beginner's magic because I lacked talent.]

But the ghost descended deeply. Believing in his swordsmanship alone, he broke through this place.

[It's impossible with swordsmanship that's not even remotely weak. What are you going to do?]

"There's no 'what to do.'"

Of course, he learns.

From the start, Taesan enjoys playing chicken games, risking each other's health. He also has endurance and attack nullification, so it was the perfect swordsmanship for him.

[Good.]

The ghost said with a slight sense of relief.

[Then I'll start teaching.]

"Do I have to be polite?"

[As I said before, there's no need for that. It's a kind of deal.]

"But how are you going to teach me?"

The ghost has no body. It is an existence that cannot interfere with the living dead.

[Don't worry about that. I've been allowed this far.]

The ghost placed his hand on Taesan's shoulder.

A weight that hadn't been felt until now was felt.

[A storm raging. Scars like marks of nails.]

The submerged voice resonates.
[Storm Scarred Sword. The only remnants left in my world.]

[You have learned the Storm Scarred Sword from the owner of the Storm Scarred Sword. You have learned the advanced skill [Storm Scarred Sword].]

Advanced skill. A skill of a level never seen before.

[You may be mastering the Ailac Martial Arts, but my swordsmanship runs on a different track. They do not integrate.]

"Hmm."

Nothing felt.

When learning Ailac Martial Arts, concepts and theories entered the mind, but this time, having learned a skill, such things did not exist.

[Advanced Skill: Storm Scarred Sword] [Proficiency: 0%] [Swordsmanship passed down from a world that has perished. Currently, only one person has mastered it.]

The proficiency is 0%. Considering that all acquired skills start from 1%, it was certainly different from the ordinary.

"I am a Swordmaster. The possessor of the title bestowed only upon those who dominate the sword. If we were to delve into the labyrinth, the proficiency would be 100%... but I am a dead man. I haven't been granted that far."

"Do I have to learn it myself?"

"Still, I can communicate verbally, so I should try."

The ghost began to explain.

* * *


The ghost patiently explained everything from the basics to advanced techniques, detailing how to position oneself and respond in various situations. It was a level of kindness that even a master might not extend.

"So, it's not about blocking attacks but rather responding to them. You must maintain your stance. If you cross that line, just discard it and overwhelm your opponent."

"...What are you talking about?"

However, Taesan couldn't understand.

The ghost continued to explain earnestly, but the concepts were either too abstract or too specific, making it difficult for Taesan to grasp the meaning. He could understand a sentence or two, but they didn't convey anything meaningful. Taesan was familiar with many types, too.

*Groan.*

The ghost sighed.

"Explaining swordsmanship in words is an impossible task."

After all, swordsmanship is about moving the body. It's far quicker to learn through direct movement and practice than through hundreds of words.

But the ghost, being already deceased, couldn't interfere directly. All he could do was convey through words, which Taesan found incredibly challenging to comprehend.

"So, when attacking the opponent's chest, bend your arm, move left, and then utilize the elasticity of your torso?"

"Yeah. Do you get the feeling?"

"I don't understand."


I tried moving my body as well, but only strange movements came out. In the stagnant time, the ghost licked its tongue as if frustrated.

"Looks like I'm stuck here again. What should I do about this?"

Taesan remained silent, closing his mouth without a word. The ghost urgently spoke.

"It's not that you lack talent or anything like that. This just doesn't make sense. Swordsmanship is about moving your body. Even the writings are based on the experiences of those who moved their bodies. So until you actually move, you won't understand what it means."

Taesan was moving at a surprisingly fast pace, perhaps worried about his own frustration or pessimism, unlike the ghost's concerns.

Contrary to the ghost's worries, Taesan wasn't being self-destructive.

"Can skill proficiency be called experience too?"

"Huh? Since it's something you have to use and master firsthand, experience fits, right?"

Taken aback by the sudden question, the ghost replied. Taesan organized his thoughts.

Skill proficiency is something you gain through experience.

So, conversely, does gaining skill proficiency create experience?

It's worth trying. Taesan took out a potion from his inventory.

[Skill Proficiency Increase Potion] [Increases proficiency of one skill by 5%.] [Oh, this one.]
The ghost also belatedly caught on.

"Possible... is it?"

Taesan drank the potion.

"You have used the Skill Proficiency Increase Potion." "Proficiency in Storm Scar's Sword has increased."

"Hmm."

Instantly, all sorts of information flooded his mind.

The way to handle a sword.

The way to defend against attacks.

The way to use strength.

All of it neatly fell into place.

Taesan stood up.

When attacking the opponent's chest, bend the arm and move to the left using the elasticity of the whole body.

Until a moment ago, these words were incomprehensible to him.

Taesan gripped the sword and moved his body. He bent his arm and turned his body to the left while thrusting the sword, then rotated his arm like rebounding using counter-force.

His body naturally spun a full circle.

Swish!

The sound of slicing through the air rang loudly. It was a clean movement that he couldn't achieve earlier.

"It works."

"Oh... so this trick works too."

[Kang Taesan invited Kang Junhyuk.]

[Kang Taesan (Alone): Is the situation the same at the fortress?]

[Kang Junhyuk (Alone): Yes. It's driving me crazy. Whenever I try to have a conversation, they keep interrupting and picking fights. Why do these lunatics behave like this?]

Anger was palpable even through the text. There was one reason Kang Junhyuk was this furious.

[Kang Junhyuk (Alone): Why on earth are they treating us like enemies in Easy Mode? I just can't understand at all.]

[Kang Taesan (Alone): The labyrinth is too big of an enemy. We need a more comprehensible enemy.]

[Kang Junhyuk (Alone): So why are they doing that in the first place?]

[Kang Taesan (Alone): I don't even know what they're thinking. They might consider it advantageous.]

Choi Junghyuk knows why he behaves that way. However, that's information that the current Taesan knows. He couldn't disclose it.
[강태산[얼론] : Just ignore them like now. Those noisy guys will probably get what's coming to them.] [강준혁[얼론] : Yeah, it's mostly Choi Junhyuk and a few others making all the noise. Sigh. It's annoying.] [강태산[얼론] : What about the labyrinth?] [강준혁[얼론] : I've been wandering around the 2nd floor. It's tough, but once you pick them off one by one, it gets manageable. Recently leveled up a bit, so it's gotten easier.] [강태산[얼론] : Alright then. Just don't mess with the altar.] [강준혁[얼론] : Yeah. I'm holding back... but there's not much else I can do.] [강태산[얼론] : Planning to go boss hunting soon?] [강준혁[얼론] : Once I finish this round. Gotta take them down.] [강태산[얼론] : Then be careful. That guy uses mind magic.]

The boss on the 2nd floor is a goblin wielding a staff. Taesan is somewhat immune to mental attacks, so he passed through without any issues, but others faced different situations.

[강태산[얼론] : You should buy some immunity potions at the store.] [강준혁[얼론] : Alright. Always appreciate it. My stats are pretty high, so as long as I handle the mental aspect, should be fine.] [강태산[얼론] : How high are your stats now?] [강준혁[얼론] : Around 15 overall? Higher than Taeyeon Nuna, you know?] 

His stats were 15 in total. As Junhyuk said, they weren't weak stats.

[강태산[얼론] : Alright, that's good.] [강준혁[얼론] : How about yours, hyung?] [강태산[얼론] : Curious, are you?] [강준혁[얼론] : ... No, I think it's better not to know.] [강태산[얼론] : We'll see later.] [강준혁[얼론] : You've said that before, but can we really meet later? I feel like I might die before that.] [강태산[얼론] : We'll see each other.]

As long as Junhyuk doesn't do anything crazy, they can definitely meet.
Taesan turned off the community chat.

"Is it over?"

"Yeah."

Taesan grabbed his sword and stood up. It wasn't his usual splendid sword or Laky Rattas's sword, but two rusty swords with an attack power of 1 each.

He went back to the shop and bought them. The dwarf looked at him with a puzzled expression, wondering why Taesan bought these weapons, but they were necessary for him. In addition, he stripped off all the equipment with attack power.

His attack power was now 2.

He moved on to the next room.

"Clang!"

"A Lizardman Warrior appeared."

A warrior. A monster one step below a berserker. They use either swords or spears.

"This is perfect."

Recalling the memories in his head, Taesan pounds his foot. The Lizardman swings his sword.

Clang clang!

The sword blade swings loud enough to make it. communicate even re feasible had ; massage isFirst
As their swords clashed, the Lizardman's intended attack turned into a defensive move instead. Seizing the opportunity, Taesan thrusts his sword into the Lizardman's chest.

"[Lizardman Warrior takes 5 damage.] [Lizardman Warrior takes 6 damage.]"

"Crack!"

The Lizardman grabs and lifts his sword. Taesan had not yet responded to the attack coming down with the handle.

But now he knows. How to react. All the information was in his head.

Taesan similarly pulls up the handle. The handles collide.

"Clang!"

"Keek!"

Continuing, he manages to make the damage window more conspicuous.

"Kaaack!"

But as I
[It's important not only to press forward aggressively but also to retreat when necessary. Even withdrawing should be considered a part of your offensive strategy.]

He understood the theory, but practical application still eluded him. Taesan finished his assessment.

"It's a good skill."

If not for the Storm Catastrophe, it would have taken two hours. In terms of dealing damage instantly and following up with consecutive attacks, it was an outstanding skill.

Even at his current unpolished state, achieving this level was noteworthy. If he improved his proficiency, its value would only increase.

The decision was made.

He would push through the 7th floor as it was. He would raise his proficiency as much as possible. The worth was sufficient.

Taesan gripped his rusty sword and moved on to the next room.
