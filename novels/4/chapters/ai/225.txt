Chapter 226

226. Creating the Black World (1)

"...and so, Odin, who had been hiding his identity, revealed his identity and punished those who had tormented him, while bestowing rewards on those who had shown mercy."

"Wah!"

Minerva's eyes sparkled with excitement.

After playing for a few days, Minerva seemed tired and asked the Great Sage to tell her a story. The Great Sage then disguised himself as an old man from Norse mythology, Odin, and descended to the mortal world to tell her a story.

"It's exciting!"

"Are you satisfied?"

"Yes!"

Minerva laughed and rested her head on the Great Sage's knee. She stroked his clothes.

"It's almost over."

The Great Sage had met Minerva for a week, and during that time, Minerva's appearance and personality had not changed, but the power growing within her had become increasingly immense.

It was almost the climax. Minerva would probably become a perfect spirit king in a day or two.

"Now it's over."

Minerva stood up with a sorrowful face.
Here is the translation of the given text:

"I'll be the king who guards this place. And when I become the king, I won't be able to leave this place. And you are an adventurer descending into the labyrinth. You're going to leave, aren't you?"

Minerva smiled with effort.

"But it's okay. I have a duty to protect these people, so I can hold on even if you leave."

"There must be a way."

The ghost said.

"If you make a contract with this one, that's fine."

"Contract, contract?"

"It's not like you can't make a contract with a spirit king, right? If you make a contract, you'll be able to respond to the call. You'll be able to come when summoned."

Minerva's face brightened at the ghost's words, but soon became gloomy again.

"...No way. If I make a contract with a being from another world, my power will leak out and I won't be able to guard it. I can't let that happen. I have to guard this world."

Minerva, who was hiding her sadness, was spoken to by the mountain.

"Do you like the people of this world?"

"Yes. They are the people I have to protect, and this is the world where I will live."

"What about the one from outside?"

"The human who has made a contract with a higher-level spirit?"

"Yes."

The connection was severed by the mountain, and Haskar appeared the next day, knocking on the wall. He wanted to return his powers to himself, and it was his own.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was a thrilling story. Initially, it wasn't his strength that was the problem. It was the power of the spirit he had contracted with.

Taesan ignored it.

And there was no one who took care of that Hasak. After realizing that Hasak had lost its power through a series of processes, they quickly distanced themselves from it.

Moreover, they didn't approach Taesan because of the power he showed. Instead, they were offering sacrifices to him from a distance.

[The proficiency in sacred power increased by 1%.]

Thanks to this, the proficiency in sacred power was rising unexpectedly.

Minerva nodded her head.

"Even so, I have to protect this child. As long as I'm with him, I'll protect him."

"Is that so?"

Taesan said briefly.

"Then I'll leave. See you tomorrow."

The white space grew distant.

Taesan returned to the entrance.

"How will it end?"

[It's weird, though.]

Taesan muttered to himself.

What he did in this world was to find Minerva and protect her. The quest given by God was too simple. Even if Taesan didn't protect Minerva, there wouldn't be any problems to that extent.
Here is the translation of the text:

It could be guessed that the reason was. It was probably gathering strength for something. They were going to crush the world, kill the giant, and achieve their own goals.

So, they will start moving soon.

"What method will we use this time?" the giant murmured, carrying high hopes.

It cannot be done like that, not even with the power of magic. The gap created by the High God in the world of giants was already exploited, but Arulia, the Spirit God, was firmly blocking it.

It is impossible to send monsters down. So, they will use another method.

The giant waited silently.

And so, the day broke. The Spirit King did not summon the giant. The giant could feel a tremendous power slowly gathering inside the crystal.

This was the last time.

And then, Akiel came to the giant.

"Hello... goodbye."

She bowed her head with a trembling face. The giant nodded in response, receiving her greeting.

Akiel opened her mouth.

"We're leaving now."
"Have you given up?"

"We gave up a long time ago. We had to stay because of Harsha, but now everyone seems tired. We've decided on a direction, where those who will stay will stay and those who will leave will leave."
Here is the translation of the text:

Haskar, who had dominated others and forced his will upon them, lost his strength and became an ordinary human.

Then, there was no reason for him to stay here. Half of those who had come here were forced to come by Haskar.

The other half were interested in the sphere itself or wanted to study it, but since the mountain spirit protected the sphere, they couldn't do anything about it.

Moreover, they were beginning to sense that the natural energy emanating from the sphere was growing stronger day by day, and such a powerful being was extremely rare.

The being who possessed such a powerful sphere, who had contracted with a top-grade spirit, was someone who could not be interfered with by the contract itself.

Although it was unknown what kind of existence they could touch, it was impossible to know that they were not a being that could be touched.

And Akiyen knew exactly who they were. She bowed her head.

"Thank you, Lord Mountain Spirit."

This was Akiyen's sincerity.
Here is the translation of the text:

Akihen didn't know exactly how much power the Spirit King possessed, but he could easily infer that if the Spirit King harbored ill intentions towards them, their world would be greatly shaken.

However, they were people who had lived with the spirits. As the Spirit King was their object of worship, for Akihen, who sought harmony with the spirits, this was the most desirable outcome.

Tae-san said:

"I'm just doing what I've been entrusted with."

"Even so, my gratitude remains unchanged. Thank you. You've stopped me from walking the wrong path."

She spoke with a sincere voice that seemed to convey her true feelings.

Just as Tae-san was about to respond, energy flowed out of the crystal.

The flowing energy began to take shape, and soon the appearance of a girl with blue hair emerged.

"Hello?"

She smiled brightly and stretched out her hand to Akihen, who stared blankly at her and grasped her hand.

"...Hello?"

"I'm glad to meet you! I'm the one who has to be protected!"

Minerva laughed playfully and waved her hand. Akihen's pupils dilated at her words.

"You... are... perhaps."

"I am the Wind Spirit King. Minerva! I am the one who protects this world!"
Here is the translation of the text:

Akien's eyes widened in shock. She quickly pressed her body against the ground.

"Ah, Your Majesty! I, a lowly person, dare to meet a great existence! Please forgive my impertinence..."

"It's fine. It's fine."

Minerva waved her hand. The Taesan, who had been gazing at her with a vacant expression, spoke up.

"Is this really possible?"

"Originally, it wasn't going to happen, but it seems to be ending soon? This level of power transfer is fine."

Minerva chuckled coldly.

Akien seemed to be on the verge of losing her mind. The great spirit king was actually showing himself before her, and it was something she couldn't even imagine.

Minerva looked down at her with a joyful gaze.

"I was born to protect you. That's my duty, but... it's also nice to see a human like you. A human who is worthy of being protected and has a heart that can be guarded."

"Ah, thank you... "

"Get up."

Minerva lifted Akien up herself. Akien stood up with a face full of gratitude.

"I'll continue to like you from now on."

"Yes, yes..."

Akien nodded her head.
Here is the translation of the text:

When Minerva was about to say something with a smile, suddenly darkness descended upon the world.

A reddish hue appeared in the sky, and a massive collision of powerful forces occurred there.

Light and darkness clashed, and the powerful beings who could be seen by the inhabitants of the earth collided.

Minerva's eyes trembled.

"Father?"

The powers of the gods and the high gods clashed.

And in that moment, a shadow engulfed the earth.

The light of the dawn that was approaching disappeared into the darkness.

A thick, deep darkness like a bottomless pit, and an abnormal force that sought to devour the Spirit King.

"[You are the king!]" 

Baraka hastily struck a blow, and a barrier formed, enveloping them.

Baraka's barrier. The power of the top-notch Spirit that even the Great Mountain couldn't break through.

Kwa-ddeok.

At that moment when they clashed with the shadow, they were swallowed up.

It was as if the barrier had never existed from the beginning, and was shrouded in darkness.

"[Ah!]" 

Baraka was shocked and further strengthened the barrier, but it was no match for the darkness.

The shadow targeted Minerva.

"Ah!"
Here is the translation of the text:

Akien hastily wrapped Minerva in a shroud. The Great Mountain drew out its sword and planted it on the ground.

Uuuu.

The Great Mountain's aura rode on the sword and spread towards the ground.

The shadow clashed with the sword.

The shadow that had merged with the sword began to swallow it, gradually turning black from the tip. The Great Mountain roughly shook its sword.

Pa-a-a-ah!

The air burst and the shadow scattered.

The scattered shadow began to ravage the ground.

"This is..."

The Great Mountain scowled.

It was dark.

Until now, I had faced many monstrous creatures with high dignity, but this was different.

It was different in its fundamental nature. This shadow...

"Ah, ah..."

Minerva's face was stiff as a board. The Great Mountain grabbed Akien's neck.

"I'm sorry, but I need to clear the area. Barbaricaza."

[I understand.]

"Yes, yes?"

The Great Mountain threw Akien far away. Barbaricaza clapped its hands and a barrier appeared as Akien flew through the air.

[Perfect throw. I think it will fall in the middle of the forest.] [Oh, this is interesting... This is...]

A ghostly figure chuckled.

[I didn't expect this kind of thing... ]

"Hey..."
Here is the translation of the text:

Minerva's face contorted.

On the other side, an army of dark-skinned Hassak appeared.

"Ha, ha, ha! Hehehe!"

Hassak burst out laughing with a face inflamed with rage. His entire body was half-shrouded in darkness, making it difficult to see his true form.

"I've got the power!"

Hassak shouted.

His voice was muffled by darkness.

"No longer will the labyrinth be my concern! I've become mighty!"

"Can something that's been consumed by power be considered mighty?"

It wasn't according to the standards of Tai Shan.

"You... "

Anger flared up on Minerva's face.

"You! Dare! Dare! You're one of the inhabitants of my world! You're someone I have to protect! You're cutting off the relationship with the spirits! Dare! You're a bad guy's power!"

A voice filled with anger resonated. Nature responded and began to stir roughly.

The natural disasters sparked by the anger of the Spirit King rushed towards Hassak, who was covered in dark dust. The earth was shattered, and rocks and debris shot up, and the wind became a storm.

Hassak's contorted smile appeared.

"Pathetic!"

The shadows spread out in all directions.
Here is the translation of the text:

The shadow that had been torn apart suddenly appeared, engulfing everything. The fragments of the earth, like a stormy wind, were all sucked in.

"Ha, ha! This is all the strength I had! I was so fixated on this kind of power!"

"You, you...".

Minerva's eyes grew hot. The Taesan pulled Minerva, who was gathering more strength.

"Don't stop! Taesan! That guy betrayed us!"

Minerva shouted roughly.

"Dad made a direct contract and dared to grab those guys' hands!"

"First, calm down. Is it okay to pull out this kind of strength right now?"

Taesan's words made Minerva's body tremble with a sudden movement.

The sphere was not only a protective shield for her, but also played a supporting role in helping her become perfect. It was almost over, but pulling out this kind of strength from outside the sphere would not be good.

"Come in. This is something I have to do."

The quest he received from the spirit was to protect the spirit king. The spirit king himself would not dare to take action.

[Your Majesty, please keep your body safe within the sphere. You are currently imperfect.]

Barqaza also added. Minerva bit her lip.

Taesan laughed.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What was I thinking? It turned out to be like this. This is another new one."

Minerva's face turned pale at his words.

"...Please don't kill me..."

"That's not the case."

Tae-san dismissed her words.

Since Ha-sak was not killed, it is not possible for the gods to intervene. It's just that Ha-sak has the strongest grudge against Tae-san, so it's only natural that he was chosen.

There are many humans who aim for concrete goals. If Ha-sak didn't exist, someone else would have received the gods' selection.

"Turn off your mind and go in. It'll be over soon."

"...Alright. Sorry."

Minerva's body began to disperse slowly.

"But be careful. That's quite different from what you've faced so far."

"I'm fully aware of that."

The dispersed Minerva returned to the concrete inside.

"Hi, hihihi!"

Ha-sak laughed.

"You're no match for my power! You're nothing!"

Tae-san didn't respond to Ha-sak's words. In fact, there was no need to respond.

He was consumed by power.
Here is the translation of the text:

The self was overwhelmed by madness, anger, and power, and could no longer be whole. Talking to someone like that was meaningless.

Snap!

The darkness hidden within Hask's body smiled at Taesan.

A great existence looked at Taesan.

Taesan released all the muscles in his body.

The darkness hidden within Hask's body.

The abyss that swallows everything. The darkness that takes on all forms.

That's not a monster. It's impossible for a creature like that to possess such power.

It's a being that exists in a place higher than other, transcendent, and imperishable beings, and has been exiled from the world.

That was a divine being.

[Master, that's dangerous.] [Oh, oh, I've heard the story, but I've never actually seen the one who signed the contract before.]

"What do you know about it?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Goshin wants to crush the world. They use all means to do so. Among them, the most frequently used method is to send monsters from your world, and... that's impossible in a place where they use the residents."

"The contract with Goshin."

"Yes. The residents of the world make a contract with Goshin and abandon the blessings of the gods, becoming their vassals instead. As a result, the protection of the gods becomes meaningless. Because the residents of the world take Goshin in directly, acknowledging their existence. Therefore, the protection of the gods is pierced through and can be interfered with."

"A ghost spat out its tongue."

"What's the point of making such a contract? It's a foolish thing that destroys the soul, body, and mind completely."

The contract with the gods is not easy. From the outside, even those who possess an incomparable power cannot receive their selection.

That's not a problem with the contract itself, but rather the conditions.

The contract of a saint is the descent of a god's dignity upon humans.

In other words, weak people, those who fail to meet the conditions, will lose their minds and lose their sense of self even if they accept the contract.

Therefore, gods choose humans who make contracts with them carefully. They look at whether the human has a strong heart and whether they can withstand the dignity of a saint.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, the noble one was not like that. To them, the mortal was no more than a plaything, a mere existence, and it was not rare for a mortal who only pursued power to be treated as a disposable tool. [If it weren't for the impossible circumstances...... even the world guardian, the Spirit King, seemed to have taken advantage of the gap to send the power of the contract. He wasn't talentless either. I understand why the Spirit King was angry.]

The Spirit King is an existence that protects this world. He guards all the inhabitants of Auru.

But then, he made a contract with a being that denied his own existence and was bound to him. It was as if his own existence was being denied.

[I don't know what to say about this.]

The ghost swallowed his saliva.

[Although I made a contract with the noble one, it's impossible for humans to withstand a proper contract, so I couldn't even grasp the power of the contract. But it's still a contract with a transcendental being. You have a different power from the monsters I've seen so far.]

"The grasp is rough."

The shadow extended.

The dark color covered everything, making it dark.

The space that had changed like this was no longer Auru.

Everything was shrouded in the darkness of the space.

Tai Shan had seen that space from the ground.

A massive crack had appeared in the sky.
Here is the translation:

"It was like the power felt at that place.

That thing has made a direct contract with a god.

In other words, the power it handles is the power of a god.

"'It will be a good experience, though.'

[The opponent is an enemy that cannot be defeated.] [You have activated the 'Sadoha' (a mixed-type arcane ability).]"
