**Episode 281**

**281. Amelia Airin (3)**

His goal was to crush Amelia's pride.

She was a strong woman.

Amelia's pride was the only pillar that supported herself. It wouldn't be shaken by a single defeat.

So, he would destroy it completely.

For her sake, too.

"......You?"

Amelia scowled. Taesan opened his mouth.

"Let's try again. Honestly, aren't you still unsatisfied? You're thinking about it yourself, right? I didn't lose because of my abilities."

Amelia's eyes wavered.

It was as Taesan said. She had lost to Taesan, and it was a crushing defeat.

But that was because Taesan had gone much deeper and had higher abilities than her, not because he was superior to her, she didn't think that way.

Strong, but someday she could catch up with his power.

That was Amelia's judgment.

And Taesan was going to crush that thought of hers.

"So, let's try again. In a perfectly equal state, let's see who's superior."

"What's the condition?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With my stats, skills are just basic ones like Strong Strike or Whirlwind."

"......I'll regret this."

[Amelia accepted the duel.]

Amelia's eyes sparkled as she drew her sword.

The people around them took a step back, their eyes fixed on the scene with excitement.

Taesan and Amelia, the two strongest warriors in the four nations. The condition was set, but it was a fight that was highly anticipated.

"Let's see."

Taesan drew his sword, and Amelia charged at him.

Clang!

Their swords clashed, and the onlookers gasped in amazement. The speed of their movements was so fast that it was hard to follow with the naked eye.

As their swords clashed, Amelia's eyes blazed with ferocity.

"This is it!"

She thought she could win.

With victory in her sights, she moved her body. Her sword swung wildly, spewing out sparks.

And Taesan calmly swung his sword.

Clang!

He deflected the sword that was coming down on him, then lowered his stance and charged forward. Just as Amelia was about to shake him off, Taesan stepped on her foot.

"Ugh!"

Amelia's voice was laced with surprise. Taesan grabbed her wrist, holding it firmly in place.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Amelia tried to swing her elbow to strike Taesan's jaw, but Taesan dodged by slightly tilting his head back.

He grasped her wrist and applied force. He twisted his sword to cut her tendons.

"Ugh!"

From then on, it was a one-sided fight. Amelia had already lost her advantage, and she slowly succumbed to defeat.

[ Duel ended. ] [ Taesan's victory. ]

"……."

Amelia sat down, stunned.

Taesan pointed his sword at her.

[ Taesan had challenged Amelia Aerin to a duel. This duel was fought under perfectly equal conditions. ]

"Again."

"……."

Amelia gritted her teeth.

[ Amelia accepted the duel. ]

The battle began again.

Amelia had gained experience from her previous defeat. She was cautious of Taesan's unpredictable movements and prepared to counterattack.

She charged at him. When Taesan swung his sword, she lowered her stance and stepped on his foot.

She had talent.

She remembered what had happened to her once and made up for it, doing what she could do.

But that was the same for Taesan as well.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Her foot was trampled, but instead, Taesan rushed towards her. Amelia's face showed a moment of surprise, as she had expected Taesan to retreat, but she quickly regained her composure.

"Ka-gak!"

Their swords clashed. Taesan moved his untouched foot and tripped Amelia's foot. Thinking he had suppressed her movement, Amelia's center of gravity collapsed.

"Ugh!"

Taesan's sword swung wildly, and her stamina rapidly decreased. She barely managed to regain her posture, but it was already too late. With their strength evenly matched, if her stamina was depleted to this extent, victory was almost impossible.

In the end, she was defeated again.

"You think you can suppress my movements by stepping on my foot? That means your movements are also restricted. From now on, it's a battle of endurance. Again."

[Taesan challenged Amelia Eirin to a duel. This duel would be fought in a perfectly even state between the two.]

Amelia grasped her sword fiercely.

Their swords clashed again. This time, Amelia focused on using her skills. She used techniques like evasion and acceleration to pressure Taesan.

However, that was a mistaken judgment. There was no one who surpassed Taesan in terms of skill utilization.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She lost. She was too focused on her skills and didn't notice Taesan's movements.

"Again."

Taesan said indifferently.

Amelia grasped her sword again.

Her hand was trembling slightly.

She lost again.

"Why...?"

"You're weak. Again."

The duel started again.

And she lost again. This time, she couldn't understand why she lost.

"This, this...!"

She was on the verge of going crazy. Her stats were perfectly equal, and her skills were the same.

In this situation, she believed she couldn't lose.

She judged that her talent was superior to anyone else in the world.

But she couldn't win now.

"Again."

The indifferent voice echoed.

She grasped her sword again, her hand shaking.

The surrounding cheers and applause gradually died down.

She lost again.

And the time it took for her to lose was getting shorter and shorter.

So she couldn't accept it anymore.

She was confident that she could understand her opponent by repeating the fight.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's why I thought I could win by understanding Taesan's movements and learning his patterns, and then using that as a basis to defeat him.

The more I fought, the more I could win.

But it was not Taesan whose movements were being understood and patterns being exposed - it was myself.

My confidence in being able to win disappeared.

"Again."

"Ah......"

And that indifferent remark started to become terrifying.

"You have talent," Taesan said, wielding his sword. Amelia was on the defensive.

Amelia did have talent. If she didn't, the God of Decline wouldn't have approached her in the first place.

"But it's not talent that's exceptional to that extent. To be honest, it's on the same level as Lee Taeyon and Kang Junhyeok."

Ka-ga-gak!

But she was mistaken. She was saying that she was superior to anyone in the world.

The God of Decline had made her that way.

"Again," Taesan said.

Amelia was on the verge of going crazy.

But even so, she couldn't let go of her sword.

The only pillar that supported her wouldn't allow her to do so.

"Again."

But the consecutive defeats made her pillar wobble.

Over ten duels."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And Amelia was defeated by everything.

In the final battle, she was overwhelmed and couldn't do anything, leading to her defeat. It meant that her mental strength had reached its limit.

[Kang Tae-san challenged Amelia Airin to a duel. Kang Tae-san only used one skill.] [Kang Tae-san activated three proofs.]

A tremendous power crushed the surroundings. The onlookers held their breath and stumbled backward. They bowed their heads to the ground, their entire bodies touching the earth.

Tae-san's achievement exerted a physical pressure.

That power spread far and wide, affecting over a million players.

"What is this?"

Lee Tae-yeon was shocked. The power that Tae-san was unleashing was his own strength. The power contained within was unimaginable even to her.

And Amelia's face, which was facing that power head-on, was extremely pale.

Just the manifestation of his simple aura was enough to make her lose her will to fight.

[Duel ended.] [Kang Tae-san's victory.]

The duel ended as her will was broken. Tae-san challenged her to another duel again.

"Again."

"......Stop."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Amelia barely opened her mouth.

"Just... stop it."

"Why?"

Taesan asked, looking like he couldn't understand.

"You think you can beat me if you repeat it? But why are you giving up? Keep going. You're capable enough."

"I lost."

Amelia spat out the words.

"Just stop it..."

There were tears welling up in her eyes.

[Amelia's skill. The special activation skill [The One Who Stands Higher Than Anyone] had not met its conditions. The skill had disappeared.]

The skill's conditions, and its disappearance. It was the first time I had seen it, but I could guess what had happened.

The [The One Who Stands Higher Than Anyone] skill was probably a skill given to Amelia by the God of Falling. The condition was probably that she had to believe she was superior to anyone and overestimate her own abilities.

The fact that the skill had broken meant that her confidence had been shattered.

Taesan sheathed his sword.

* * *

Taesan's battle had ended.

But people were still unable to recover from the shock.

The three proofs that Taesan had used. Their effects had spread to everyone.

Overwhelming power.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They saw an existence stronger than anything they had ever seen.

The Korean players were excited and chattered.

"We said it in the community! His power is real! He's the modern god we should worship!"

No one could deny their words. Taesan had shown unparalleled power.

And the strongest or leaders from each country gathered in one place.

"This is astonishing."

Daniel opened his mouth.

"It's really... astonishing."

Taesan was too strong.

If all French players fought against Taesan, they would lose with a 100% probability. Taesan's power was that overwhelming.

"How did you get such power...?"

"I worked hard, did well."

Taesan replied, turning his gaze away. Amelia, who was sitting in the corner, trembled every time Taesan's gaze fell on her.

Daniel wore a wry smile.

"Well, it's good for us to see. If there's someone this strong, our survival rate will increase significantly."

"But... I have doubts."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Aika muttered quietly.

"Why do so many players in Korea die?"

The number of players in Korea was only in the tens of thousands, significantly fewer than in other countries.

That's why they didn't worry too much about the strength of Taesan. If there really were strong players, they would have survived, so they thought.

"Ah..."

Kim Hwi-yeon also fell silent at those words.

"I don't know much about it either, even if you say so."

Kim Hwi-yeon was puzzled. From Korea's perspective, if Taesan didn't exist, they wouldn't have survived.

But in other countries, despite having average strength lower than Korea's, many people had survived.

"That's what I called you here to talk about."

Taesan opened his mouth.

"I can't tell you everything, but I'll explain the general idea."

About the gods.

And about the labyrinth.

The situation was very different from the previous life. The gods would continue to directly intervene in the earth, and they needed to know about it.

"And there, I'll also tell you about skills."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan couldn't handle everything alone. They needed to get stronger.

"It's okay, the situation is fine anyway."

Gosin was concentrating his power in Korea to kill Taesan. The threat to other countries was less than before.

In other words, if they got stronger, many more people could survive and combine their powers.

"Skills... what's that?"

"Have you obtained various skills so far? How do you think you can obtain skills?"

There was a brief silence at Taesan's words. Iteayeon opened his mouth.

"If you bring out a certain effect, you can obtain a skill that matches it. As Taesan said before."

"That's right. Most of the people here have obtained skills like evasion, addition, non-breathing, and consecutive attacks."

What Taesan was trying to say was something more than that.
