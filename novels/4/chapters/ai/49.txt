50. 8th Floor, God of Tests. Arrogance (4)

[Now, the one who entered the 8th floor managed to somehow defeat the 20th floor... It's truly unbelievable.]

"Yeah."

Taesan was also surprised. Although Taesan was strong right now, he had thought that around the 15th floor was his limit, considering that the strength increased exponentially as he climbed the floors.

However, he was able to achieve victory against an adventurer on the 20th floor, who was more than twice as strong.

"It might have been possible to go further... But I guess I should stop here."

If the opponent had been a monster without proper intelligence, it might have been easier to proceed.

But the adventurer he faced had broken through even the shadow zone mode.

These were people who had run even beyond the 10th floor in this crazy place without any knowledge or information.

They had more information about this place than Taesan did.

Not only were they strong, but they could quickly adapt to Taesan's skills with their accumulated knowledge and experience, so it was better to stop here.

In any case, he was able to defeat the adventurer on the 20th floor. Spiritual rise and victory reward. Formidable judgment. Combining all these, he could become tremendously strong.
"Status Window."

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 21] [Shield: 50/50] [Health: 835/835] [Mana: 215/215] [Strength: 332] [Intelligence: 170] [Agility: 268] [Attack Power +24] [Defense +29] [In prime condition.] [Sigh.]

The ghost let out a hollow laugh.

"Such unbelievable growth."

"Leveling up is no joke."

Acceleration was no joke.

Comparing it to the experience in Easy Mode made him feel sorry for himself.

At this rate, it wouldn't be long before he caught up to Lee Taeyeon's stats. She had avoided all sorts of trials, so it wasn't impossible.

"This trial wasn't meant to make me this strong. Normally, I would have stopped at a reasonable level of strength... But thanks to crazy skills and the whims of arrogance, it's come to this."

"Anyway, it's too quiet."

The trial was over.

But the rewards had not yet come down.

...

The power felt from the altar was quietly shaking. As if confused, complex emotions seemed to show through the strength.
After a brief moment, the system window appeared.

["Arrogance interference area has decreased."]

Power trembled. Taesan could feel the total amount of that power decreasing. It was a drop he hadn't felt with Rakiratas and Valtaja.

"Your head must be complicated right now. Whether to be happy or sad."

The ghost muttered as if in bitterness. It seemed the gods enjoyed devouring his domain.

"Arrogance rewards you. You have received the [Ring of Proof]." "You have cleared the enhanced trial. Additional rewards follow." "You have obtained the special continuous activation skill [Proof of Limits]." "Arrogance offers you the Apostle's Contract."

"I decline."

As always, he refused the Apostle's Contract. At that, the power beyond trembled. It seemed almost like a complaint.

But there was nothing more visible beyond that. The trembling power, as if grumbling, slowly faded away.

"Arrogance anticipates our next meeting."

Taesan, who had been silently watching, murmured.

"They are not hostile, it seems."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"He is a god displaying various emotions. I thought there might be consequences for rejecting the Apostle's Contract, but there was no sign of such intentions.

"Since they are gods with strong pride, they probably wouldn't have been impressed if I had only been slightly exceptional. But I far exceeded that line. Moreover, the transcendent being that even Rakiratas and Valtaja are watching closely is not an enemy. At least, it's not mere arrogance."

It seemed there were also conflicts of influence among the gods.

Taesan, organizing the information, began confirming the rewards.

His stats had increased by about double.

Originally, it wouldn't have been like this, perhaps. Since the limit was up to the 8th floor, he must have become reasonably stronger.

However, due to the rise in spiritual power and skills, he was able to experience insane growth, climbing up to the 20th floor.

Confirming the rewards of the trial:

[Proof of Limits] [Strength +5] [Defense +5] [A ring that only those who understand their own strength can wear, bestowed by a god like a speck of dust.]

"Not bad."

Considering Taesan's current stats, it was a bit disappointing, but as a basic reward, it was a good ring to think about. Since both strength and defense were high, it was decent.

Especially now, in a situation where defense was lacking, it had its value.

And reinforcement rewards.
Here is the English translation of the text:

[Special Active Skill: Proof of Limits] [Proficiency: 1%] [When facing opponents of equal or similar level, all stats increase. Movement speed increases, and health and mana continuously recover.]

"Special skills all seem quite similar."

Rakiratas, the god of struggle, provides buffs during sustained battles. Valtaja, the god of victory, grants increases in specific stats with each victory.

The Trial God who assesses strength had effects befitting his status.

Compared to other gods' skills, this one was also quite good. It means gaining an advantage against opponents who should be similar. Originally, it's not bad.

And skill enhancement. It not only raises stats but also improves skill proficiency. As the opponent uses all their skills, it was possible to gain substantial benefits.

Thanks to this, several skills underwent changes.

[Special Active Skill: Deflection] [Mana Cost: 5] [Proficiency: 62%] [Reduces damage by deflecting attacks. Seems like it can deflect attacks from all weapons. It also seems possible to deflect magic or curses. It seems like it can even deflect concepts.]

The sentence "deflecting concepts" was added. It used to be unclear what it meant, but now I understood.

Concepts.
Here is the English translation of the text:

"That was literally everything."

Presence. Mental confusion. Pressure. Overwhelming sensation.

The mental pressure felt when encountering something transcendental.

It meant being able to deflect that.

"Will it be useful?"

I don't know how it will turn out, but having it isn't a bad thing. It means an increase in options.

The changed skill wasn't just Deflection.

[Special Active Skill: Counter] [Mana Cost: 5] [Proficiency: 20%] [Counters enemy attacks. Deals greater damage to enemies. Counters attacks that cannot be countered.]

Counter is a skill that automatically moves the body to retaliate.

However, it only activates half or not at all against attacks the body cannot retaliate against or avoid.

It meant extending that threshold a bit more. Taisan had seen the use of Counter several times in the previous world.

"Quite literally defying the laws of physics."

If it matched his memory, it was a fairly useful change. Apart from that, other skills he hadn't paid much attention to had changed quite a bit.
Here is the English translation of the text:

[Special Passive Skill: Field of View Enhancement] [Proficiency: 42%] [Allows for a wide field of vision. It surpasses human categories quite effectively.]

It seemed to have transformed slightly, subtly altering the range of sight. It became broader and enabled seeing farther than before.

[Special Passive Skill: Penetration] [Proficiency: 43%] [Can grasp many things. It seems capable of penetrating weaknesses of both living and non-living entities. It might find hidden paths. Occasionally informs you of crucial information.]

It can also identify weaknesses of non-living entities. Considering the 11th floor and beyond, this was also a good change.

As Taisan swiftly reviewed the skills, he looked surprised.

"Why has this one increased so much?"

[Special Passive Skill: Composure] [Proficiency: 65%] [An unwavering mind. Does not falter even when confronted with entities beyond cognition. Gains adjustments to judgments. Will not falter even in extreme situations.]

As he recalled, it was around 38% before. It had increased by close to 30%. The ghost responded as if it were obvious.
Here is the English translation of the text:

"The gods judge things even if they do not see them directly, using altars as conduits. There were no issues due to your peculiarity, but... It's about time the skill itself leveled up."

"Hmm."

Coolness considered the skill largely useless to him, but if proficiency reached 100%, the story would change. It wasn't bad.

Stormy Weather's sword skill proficiency had also risen to 15% now. It had improved somewhat.

"This should be fine."

He could stop anytime he wanted. Starting from the 1st floor, it was good to proceed slowly.

It was a trial that could be shared later in the community. Unlike other gods, they didn't throw just anything. Taisan's arrogance evaluation had increased in his mind.

* * *

Afterward, it was all plain sailing.

The monsters, which were already too easy, fell with stats that had doubled since the first floor trial. They fell when hit roughly.

"It's a bit disappointing like this."

Currently, Taisan's attack power was quite low.

Considering average strength, it was on the higher side, but it was imbalanced compared to his stats.

He wanted to quickly surpass the 10th floor and buy equipment.

Still, since his level itself hadn't risen, he could fully receive experience points and level up.
Here is the English translation of the text:

"While advancing through the floors, Taisan also found a secret room. As always, traps awaited, but there were no issues.

*Ping!*

He failed to disarm it, and arrows flew at him, but he didn't even bother to deflect them.

[First Attack Absolute Nullification activates.]

The arrows dropped harmlessly. He continued disarming traps to improve his proficiency and gain rewards.

[Sturdy Ankle Guards] [Defense + 6] [Agility + 3] [Lightweight and sturdy. Difficult to find any drawbacks.]

A modest increase in defense. Agility was a bonus.

After Taisan cleared the floor, he found no special altars or rooms.

"So this is the end here."

He had found everything there was to find on the 8th floor.

Taisan entered the boss room.

"Kyaak!"

[Marukanda Rutia appeared.]

A red, twice-as-large bird appeared. It attacked Taisan with sharp beak and sturdy wings flapping.

Taisan calmly moved his sword.

The sword pinned the bird down.

"Kyaek."

The bird struggled and flapped, trying desperately to evade and deal damage, but it was too slow for Taisan. He blocked everything and countered, achieving victory without taking any damage.

[You have defeated Marukanda Rutia.]
"Can't get used to this."

It was too easy.

It felt almost comical considering all the hardships endured so far.

"That's how it goes when you perfectly clear the Trial of the Gods. There won't be anything to stop you on the surface. You roughly understand, right? How this place is structured."

"I get it."

Hidden rooms. Trials of the Gods. Doors of entirely different colors. NPCs.

In the Solo Mode, there were various entities. Depending on how one engaged with them and proceeded, the differences were substantial.

An exemplary case was Itaeyeon.

She discarded all trials and descended. From an external perspective, she seemed sufficiently strong, but according to the warrior's words, her level was not comparable to that of the castle.

In other words, a ghost who had descended to the 85th floor could potentially be stronger than Itaeyeon, who had cleared it.

However, there was one problem with that.

"You descended to the 85th floor, right? And you were particularly strong among them."

"Yeah. I often let my guard down. I was strong though."

The ghost scoffed. Despite being careless enough to lose their life on a lower floor, the fact that they had descended there itself proved their strength.
"Objectively speaking, do you think you could have cleared it?"

"Yeah... I think so."

The ghost affirmed.

"But what's the significance of clearing it? Even if you clear it and leave this place, it's not conquest. There's no reason to do so when you can't fulfill your wish."

"Is that so."

It became clear.

Clearing and conquering in this place are completely separate things.

"What's the difference?"

Whether it's meeting gods and NPCs, getting permission from the shopkeeper, or the maze's wizard making decisions, the exact concept was still difficult to grasp. But there are beings here who can provide answers.

"What's different? Clearing and conquering?"

"Well..."

The ghost hesitated.

"To be honest, I'm not sure myself."

"Then why haven't you cleared it? Just descend and test it out."

"It's just... a kind of feeling? A premonition? Something like that. I had a sense that even if I descended like this, I wouldn't fulfill my wish. That kind of feeling fits quite well here, so I've been checking each detail."

"Hmm."
Here's the translation of the text to English:

"In the end, it was impossible to know right away.

For now, the plan was to descend further and meet other NPCs to find out.

Taesan confirmed the reward on the 8th floor.

Marnius's Rune. Its effect is simple: it imbues weapons with attributes."
