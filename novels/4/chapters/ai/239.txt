Chapter 240

240. The Fourth Return. Earth (7)

Kim Hwi-yeon seriously tied her hair and began to think about the deployment and tactics of the people. The Taesan said, "Work hard!" and left the outside.

"Wow, wow, wow!"

"Great spirit, you are magnificent!"

However, people were in awe of Minerva and Barakaz and bowed their heads in reverence.

A thick atmosphere of reverence and admiration was flowing from them.

Minerva and Barakaz brought the people from their respective regions to Seoul safely. The power they showed was truly amazing.

It was not unusual for the people who came together to worship them.

The atmosphere of reverence reached Taesan through Minerva and Barakaz.

"Have we made a contract? Is something coming to me?"

"No, there are no such conditions, and the meaning of the contract would be meaningless."

Taesan understood the overall situation by passing through the people who were revering him.

As we had discussed at the meeting, the relationship between people was not bad. The people of Seoul were sharing the food they had cultivated in the community garden diligently.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Chae, it's a vegetable. It's really fresh."

"And... I thought maybe, but it's really possible..."

The people from other regions were amazed by the abundant quantity of vegetables and couldn't help but gasp in amazement.

They had also heard about the method of growing vegetables in the wilderness, but they couldn't master it because the minimum conditions for seeds to germinate were not met.

People ate the vegetables greedily. Although there were people who had learned to grow vegetables in the wilderness and shared their food, they couldn't eat their fill due to various problems with the number of people.

A man who knew how to grow vegetables in the wilderness clapped his hands together.

"Anyone who wants to learn how to grow vegetables, please come this way! I don't know if the time will come, but I'll teach you once!"

Many people rushed over.

The conditions for learning to grow vegetables are to wait for the sprouts to grow after sowing. Although it takes three to four weeks, it's not difficult to learn. More than half the people received seeds to learn how to grow vegetables.
Here is the translation of the text:

And people from other regions knew it. The atmosphere in Seoul was completely different from that of other regions.

The atmosphere in other regions was not even worth mentioning. It was difficult to survive immediately, and there was no guarantee of survival until the next return. Therefore, those who returned to the earth were always depressed, facing death with a heavy heart.

But Seoul was different.

This place was bright for everyone. It was not just the hope of ignorant people who couldn't see the future. It was filled with the belief that one could survive and live.

In reality, Seoul had achieved such results. Many more people survived than in other regions.

What made this difference was not anyone else, but the Mountain God.

The worship towards the Mountain God became even more profound.

The Mountain God spoke with a hint of divine power, as if it was rising endlessly without bounds.

"What would happen if this 100% succeeds?"

"Uh... I'm not sure..."

Even Minerva, who had said it was impossible, was taken aback.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's not impossible for someone to reach transcendence solely through worship, but it's necessary to receive worship from the world itself. In reality, it's impossible, and I don't know what to say about this.

She didn't give a definite answer unlike before.

Tae-san came to find Taeyoung and Kang Jun-hyeok, who were passing by with a group of people.

The two were engaged in a fierce battle, and it seemed they had been fighting non-stop since they arrived here.

When Tae-san approached, the two stopped fighting. They greeted Tae-san with sweaty faces.

"What's up, hyung?"

"Hello."

"Do you still have a lot to do?"

"I still feel like I'm not good enough, so I'm working hard."

Taeyoung smiled wryly.

The path ahead of them was still far and steep. They didn't have time to rest because they had to be strong.

Tae-san nodded his head after looking at the two's eyes.

"It's okay."

The two of them were mentally trained at this point. They couldn't even recall the time when they were weak and cowardly.

[It's not bad.]

"Hmm. Are they going down the wrong path? I had many shortcomings, to be honest...... But this is okay. I'm still weak, but that's due to a lack of experience and time. I have everything I need to fill in the basics."

Note: "Hyung" is a term used to address an older brother or a superior.
Here is the translation of the text:

Minerva and Barkazza were not bad, and I praised them. Kang Jun-hyeok and Lee Tae-yeon bowed their heads in gratitude.

When Taesan looked at the two of them, he opened his mouth.

"A-grade monster. Did you meet?"

"Yes..."

"How was it?"

"I did well."

Lee Tae-yeon muttered to herself. She was stronger than any monster she had faced before, and even stronger than all the monsters she had encountered in the labyrinth.

The attacks that came at her were attacks that could knock out her physical strength one by one, and the hard armor made her attacks ineffective.

But she won.

Lee Tae-yeon clenched her fist. Taesan smiled quietly, his eyes twinkling.

"Good. Ambition. And fighting spirit. These two are essential. Don't forget the mind you have now."

Taesan drew out his weapon.

"Ability Sword. Are you handling it well?"

"It's overflowing. I would have died long ago if I didn't have it."

"Both of you, draw your weapons. Let's train again."

"Yes."

The two of them drew out their weapons seriously.

Taesan stomped his foot.

The two did not retreat.

They continued to fight, advancing towards Taesan.
Here is the translation of the text:

As a result, the proficiency of the two has noticeably increased. Although the actual improvement is blocked by the earth, it will be clearly felt when entering the labyrinth.

Another day has passed.

The quest has begun.

*

"Are we all here?"

Everyone is waiting for Kim Hui-yeon's words with serious eyes. She is scanning the people and furrowing her brow.

"Ijuhyeok... "

"I already said, I'll go alone."

Behind him, there were players from the Daehan team.

Ijuhyeok raised his finger.

"The east is mine. Don't interfere."

"Son of a gun."

Kim Hui-yeon's eyes flashed, but she didn't say anything else. She turned her gaze to the people.

"Alright, then. I'll explain the positions and roles to each group."

Kim Hui-yeon began to explain each group one by one, and the people followed her without a word, making a clean and rational decision. Ijuhyeok, who was watching with a grudge, left.

After everything was settled, Kim Hui-yeon spoke in a calm voice.

"Everyone, survive. We can win. Let's survive and seize the future."

Everyone nodded seriously.

[Quest start.]

"Then, let's move!"
Here is the translation of the text:

She yells. People quickly dash their bodies.

Kiiing!

Cracks of light appeared in a row from outside. And monsters that guard the cracks also appear.

Kaaang!

People and monsters collide with each other.

The Taesan watched the scene with a serious expression from the city hall.

He entrusted the west to Minerva and the north to Barkaza. With the two of them, they would be able to handle the monsters without any problems. If any problems arise, they would immediately contact Taesan, so he wouldn't need to worry.

Then, he would only need to worry about the east and south.

Taesan gazed at the south.

"Ah, strong!"

"Waaaah!"

The monsters guarding the cracks were strong. They were B-grade, C-grade, but there was a clear difference even within the same grade.

The monsters that appeared now were even stronger than the top-level monsters in D-grade. Even hardcore players would need to focus on defense when facing them, and in casual or normal cases, they wouldn't even be able to fight back.

"What's this? Why are they so strong?"
Here is the translation of the text:

As a result, people from other regions were shocked. They had never encountered a monster as strong as this before.

When they were flustered and bewildered, people from Seoul stepped forward.

"Don't be afraid! We'll handle our duties!"

The Seoul players, Lee Ji and Normal mode player, rushed to the sides.

Lee Ji and Normal mode player were using their ability to not die as long as their health was not exhausted, and were playing the role of a shield. Hard mode players were taking advantage of the gap to pressure the monster with numbers.

However, even in situations where they couldn't win, Lee Taeyeon and Kang Junhyuk stepped forward.

People from Seoul had experience. They had fought against overwhelmingly powerful monsters. They followed the example of the Seoul players, and people from other regions began to step forward one by one.

They were fighting monsters in a stable situation, despite being a little nervous.

"I won't get involved."

What about people from Daejeon then?

Taesan looked to the east.

* * *

About a few minutes before the crack opened, people from Daejeon moved to the east. A man who was following Lee Joo-hyuk carefully asked.

"Hey, Joo-hyuk-sun. Are you really okay?"

"What's wrong?"

"What...?"
Here is the translation of the text:

He glanced in the direction of the TV.

Many people were listening to Kim Hui-yeon's words at that place.

Lee Ju-hyeok said with a face mixed with irritation:

"Then let's get out of here."

"No, not yet."

The man shook his head in surprise. When he looked at the people, they quickly averted their gaze. Lee Ju-hyeok was seething.

"Don't laugh."

He had been a leader since the world went astray.

From high school, he had been the leader of his clique, and even in college, he always led the way.

In the army, he was also a leader. Everyone relied on him and believed his words. He had the authority of a king.

This didn't change even when he entered society. He couldn't tolerate someone standing above him, so he started his own business alone. With bold and daring plans, he grew his business and achieved remarkable results.

He was always a leader. There was never a moment when he wasn't one.

This didn't change even as the world changed. Having entered hard mode, he wanted to become a leader. With bold decisions, he won the trust of the people and moved forward.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, he failed to become a leader.

"What's good about that coward?"

Kim Hwi-yeon chose a stable option unlike Lee Ju-hyeok, reducing risks and gradually advancing.

Lee Ju-hyeok mocked her for that.

Pursuing safety like that is something nobody likes. People like bold and fearless individuals. He believed that. In reality, the leader of the Daegu region became him.

However, the hard-line faction trusted Kim Hwi-yeon's words more than his.

Naturally, the leader of the hard-line faction became Kim Hwi-yeon.

Lee Ju-hyeok couldn't accept this. He had always wanted to be a leader. He had always wanted to stand in front of people and lead them.

However, he was not just obsessed with power.

He judged that it would be pointless to fight Kim Hwi-yeon, so he didn't directly confront her.

Even if he handed over the leadership of the hard-line faction, he thought that becoming the leader of Korea would be enough. Kim Hwi-yeon was burdened by the weight of being a leader, so he thought he would hand it over to her.

However, it was not the case.
Here is the translation of the text:

She had voluntarily taken on the role of leader and even gained the support of hardcore players.

"What a bunch of nonsense."

Lee Joo-hyeok spat out his saliva.

It's impossible. The leader of Korea should be someone who can take charge.

So, he thought about proving his abilities.

"Everyone, get ready."

"Are you really okay?"

"I'm fine, so don't doubt me."

Lee Joo-hyeok frowned and patted his chest.

"I've saved the most people outside of Seoul. It's possible because Seoul has a monster like Kang Tae-san. I'm not someone who can be defeated."

With his abilities, he covers the entire eastern region, bringing people together and gaining their admiration and trust. He then challenges the leader's position, and that's Lee Joo-hyeok's plan.

Ugh!

The time had come, and the fissure opened. Lee Joo-hyeok shouted loudly with a serious face.

"Everyone, get ready!"

The monsters appeared.

Lee Joo-hyeok charged forward.

"Aah!"

With a fierce cry, he drew his sword. He planned to defeat the B-grade monsters first and boost morale.

The monster turned its body to face him.
Here is the translation of the text:

Ijuhyeok had one misconception. He thought he had saved many people because of his exceptional ability.

However, this was not entirely false, but an important part was missing.

Go shin was trying to kill the Taesan.

Of course, he was pouring all his strength into Seoul. This was not just about sending a strong monster, but also included the overall strength of the monster.

The monsters in Seoul were much stronger than those in other regions.

And now, all the people had gathered in Seoul.

Go shin was able to concentrate all his strength in Seoul, and the monsters in Seoul had become much stronger than before.

And Ijuhyeok had planned his strategy based on the monsters he had fought before.

The monster's arm moved.

'What?'

Danger! The instinct that had sent him to the labyrinth until now sounded an alarm. Ijuhyeok reflexively drew his sword to block the monster's attack.

Ka-ka-ka!

"Kuh-huh!"

Ijuhyeok was knocked backward with a shock, feeling a sense of unease as he held onto the hilt.

The monster moved.

"What, what."

A bewildered player was left standing on the ground, frozen in place.
