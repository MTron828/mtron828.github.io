Chapter 400

400. The Magician Who Created the Labyrinth of Realms

A reunion with the magician.

There was no reason to refuse. Taesan agreed. Without hesitation, Balbambara used the administrator's power.

[Balbambara activated #000004.]

Quadruple click.

The space distorted, and the world on the other side of the labyrinth came into view.

[You're the first to see the magician again in such a short period. Go in. Talk to the magician and adjust your resonance.]

Taesan inserted his body into the space.

Everything was twisted, and numerous colors were mixed together in the space.

It was the same as before.

A realm was something that existed by piling up its own existence. It should have had its own unique characteristics, but in the magician's realm, nothing could be felt.

It was just a chaotic space where countless powers were mixed together.

When he came here before, he didn't know anything. It was because he didn't have that level of power and skill.

But now, he could read it a little.

[You have activated essence comprehension.]

Taesan's focused eyes trembled slightly.

'...What's going on?'

Although he couldn't grasp the principles and breadth of the space, he had discovered one thing.

This space wasn't originally a place where powers were mixed like this.

In the past, it was like the domains of other transcendents, containing the characteristics of its owner and the accumulated power. The remnants of power scattered throughout the space were testifying to that.

Someone had remodeled it into a space where numerous powers were mixed, making it impossible to discern its true nature, like a jumbled mess.

And the only one who could do that was the owner of the domain.

The wizard had remodeled his own domain to the point where it was impossible to restore it to its original state.

Taesan couldn't even understand the reason behind it. His level was still stuck at immortality, and his power was insufficient.

"It seems like you have a lot of questions."

Taesan turned his gaze towards the direction of the voice.

A man with an extremely ordinary face, one that could be seen anywhere, was looking at Taesan.

"Nice to meet you again."

Taesan nodded his head.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The magician snapped his fingers. A chair and a table appeared. On the table, a tea set had been placed at some point.

"Honestly, I'm surprised too."

The magician sat down in the chair, holding a cup of tea. Taesan sat down across from him.

"Seriously, how did you reach this point so quickly?"

"Didn't you watch everything?"

"I did watch, but what's surprising is surprising."

The magician shrugged his shoulders.

"I thought it would take at least 80 floors to reach this point. It's not a place you can reach just by having the qualifications. I thought my power and strength were still lacking, but I was mistaken. It was a pleasant miscalculation."

The magician took a sip of tea.

"Thanks to that, Balbambara's head is hurting, it seems."

"What are you going to do to me?"

The labyrinth is for mortals.

The current Taesan was not the target.

The magician smiled quietly.

"What should I do?"

Taesan waited silently. The magician also maintained his silence, sipping his tea.

"Honestly, my head hurts too."

The magician put down his empty teacup.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"According to the rules of the labyrinth, I have to expel you. Or, I have to make a contract with you so that you can't take anything else from the labyrinth. But... if I do that, the gods will go berserk.

The ones that come to mind are Mashin and Maria. Besides them, there are also the gods of struggle and death, Rakirates and the gods of victory. It's not a small number.

"I have to maintain a cooperative relationship with them, so I have to show them respect. Thanks to that, I have a headache."

However, the face of the magician who said that looked very calm.

"I won't expel you, though."

The owner of the labyrinth has made a decision.

"But if we leave things as they are, it'll be troublesome, right? For both you and me. So, I'll fix that part properly."

Something flowed out of the magician.

It was not just a simple power or energy, but something closer to laws and order.

[The magician activated the designer's authority.]

"I can't limit your power. You need to become stronger. Limitations are absurd. So, I'll change the labyrinth's layers to be exclusive to you."

This is the space outside the labyrinth.

But even so, I could feel it. The labyrinth beyond this space is changing."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even if transcenders or special layers remain as they are, it's okay. But for other layers that aren't like that, they'll change to suit you."

An immortal labyrinth tailored to Taesan was realized. It was quiet, but it scattered intense waves.

And eventually, the waves that were fluctuating subsided.

The magician clapped their hands.

"It's done."

"It ended faster than I thought."

"I just separated the existing labyrinth to make it exclusive to you. Of course, from now on, you'll have to work harder, right?"

The magician waved their hand again.

"And the reward you've obtained this time. It's not useful to you, is it? I'll change it to something with suitable value."

[The magician activated their management authority.] [The title "Indomitable Body and Mind" changed to "Solo Unwavering Body".] [The special passive skill "Unwavering Heart" changed to "Immortal Heart".]

The rewards of the 80th floor. But to Taesan, who had achieved immortality, they were useless. The magician changed them to something that would be helpful to Taesan as well.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And the absolute authority you've obtained. It's a really troublesome skill, too. Due to the system of the labyrinth, it's natural to obtain skills in such a way, but the problem is that it's a passive skill.

The absolute authority was a skill that Taesan couldn't control.

According to the skill's effect, the mortal would lose all will to resist and obey Taesan the moment they saw him. This wasn't a good thing for Taesan either.

"So, it's a service. For future tasks, I'll create a skill that can control it."

The wizard snapped his fingers.

[The wizard activated skill creation.] [You have obtained the special skill [Authority Seal].]

"If you use that skill, the mortal's existence won't feel anything towards you. They'll just think of you as a normal human. You can use it depending on the situation."

"......Thank you."

Taesan looked at the wizard.

The wizard changed the skill's effect and created a new skill as if it was nothing.

This was a feat that only the master of the labyrinth could achieve.

This was the wizard who created the labyrinth.

[It's unbelievable. Really.]

The ghost let out a dry laugh and muttered to himself. In reality, if the wizard wanted to, it wasn't an exaggeration to say that they could obtain all skills."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's nothing special. It's just something created relying on the system and the labyrinth. It's not that great."

The magician said this with a face that showed neither pride nor disappointment, simply stating the facts.

Taesan asked the magician, "What do you desire?"

The gods in the labyrinth desire the struggle and battle of mortals' lives.

They want to find a mortal who fits their heart's desire.

The magician said that they created this place as an unknown explorer, seeking to learn things they didn't know.

However, it didn't seem like the magician truly desired that.

The magician opened their mouth, but it wasn't an answer to Taesan's question.

"Why did you become like that?"

Instead, Taesan's face scrunched up in doubt, and the magician continued.

"Why were you so weak before you went back in time?"

"It's because I was in easy mode."

In easy mode, he had limitations on his growth, so he had no choice but to become stronger by acquiring many skills.

"Don't you think that part is strange?"

The magician pierced Taesan with a questioning gaze.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$"You are strong, very much so. You've been evaluated to be on par with Eitaeyeon who cleared this place, despite using underhanded methods. In a real fight, you would have won."

"It's because I used the system to acquire skills..."

"No."

The magician refuted Tae San's words.

He laughed.

"That's impossible."

"But I did it."

Tae San had defeated Eitaeyeon, a superior being with poor stats, by using the skills he had acquired. The magician's words held no weight against Tae San, who had accomplished it himself.

"That's precisely the problem, Tae San."

The magician leaned against the back of his chair.

His face was full of joy.

"I did say it was impossible, but it's not entirely impossible. If you make as much of an effort as your past self did to acquire countless skills, and achieve actual results, and obtain other powers, it could be possible. But you know, Tae San. How much effort have you put into it?"

"...An unfathomable amount of effort."

He had discarded all distractions and thoughts, focusing solely on acquiring skills. He had pursued every possibility.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's an incredible determination and effort. With stats like that, you took down two single-digit monsters. Moreover, you even dealt damage to the Apostle of Gosin. That's truly an achievement worthy of admiration. Even transcendents would be impressed. Then, I'll ask you a question."

The wizard asked with genuine curiosity.

"Why couldn't your past self surpass mortality?"

* * *

After finishing his conversation with the wizard, Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

However, his mind was still in disarray.

"You should have surpassed mortality back then. In fact, you had to."

In reality, Taesan had obtained the qualifications to do so. Through the unity of his body and mind, he had reached a higher dimension.

But nothing had changed.

He was still just a mortal being.

"But the spiritual power you gained back then still remains even after turning back time. And with that, you can steal the powers of Gosin and the Immortal, without exception. Even transcendents are no match for you."

The wizard said, leaning back in his chair.

His eyes held a pure curiosity.

"What made you like that? What twisted you? I'm searching for the answer now, but... it's not coming easily."

Those were the wizard's final words.

"Hmm."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Originally, he should have surpassed the mortal realm in his past life.

Even in this life, he had only recently reached a certain level, and perhaps he could have reached an even higher place.

But that didn't happen. What was the difference, he couldn't know at the moment.

Taesan pondered for a moment and shook his head.

It was something even the wizards didn't know. There was no way he could find the answer now.

Instead of worrying about the unknown, Taesan decided to solve his own curiosity. He opened a community.

In the community, many people were sharing their stories. Taesan found Lee Taeyeon, but she didn't respond to his contact.

[Gang Junhyeok [Alone] : Ah, hyung.]

When Taesan contacted Gang Junhyeok, he responded immediately.

[Gang Taesan [Alone] : How's Lee Taeyeon doing?]

She had regained her memories. It was necessary to know how she was descending into the labyrinth.

[Gang Junhyeok [Alone] : It's perfect timing. I wanted to ask you, hyung. What did you talk about with noona?] [Gang Taesan [Alone] : Why.] [Gang Junhyeok [Alone] : Noona has already reached the 55th floor, you know?]"

Note: "hyung" is a Korean term used to address an older brother or a close older male friend, and "noona" is a term used to address an older sister or a close older female friend.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan stopped.

As he knew, even when he returned to Earth, he was only in the mid-40s. From the 50th floor, the difficulty level increased by one floor, making it impossible to go down easily.

Gang Jun-hyuk asked Taesan with curiosity.

[Gang Jun-hyuk [Alone] : You're not throwing a tantrum like you usually do. You're just quietly going down. What did you do to your sister?]
