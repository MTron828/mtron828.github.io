Chapter 439

439. 86th Floor, The World of the Swordless (1)

[Now, the artifact of Carbert is perfectly yours.] [Carbert's Artifact: The Last Owner] [It's the artifact of a world that has already been destroyed, taking the lives of many imperial families. You have become the last owner of this sword. If the owner changes, all the sword's abilities will disappear.] [Attack Power + 1500] [Attack Power + 500 when facing all enemies] [The proficiency of all sword skills will greatly increase.]

Attack power has increased by 850.

Additionally, the special effect of greatly increasing the proficiency of sword skills has been added. It's a tremendous change.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[And now you are the only one who wields the Stormscar Sword. You are the successor.] [Title: Successor of Stormscar Swordsmanship] [Attack +500] [Defense +500] [You are the last remaining successor of Stormscar. You have been recognized by the founder of swordsmanship. If you wish, you can teach Stormscar swordsmanship to a qualified person.] [Although my world will be forgotten with this... if you teach Stormscar swordsmanship to others, it will remain in everyone's memory.]

His voice was extremely calm.

It was as if he had let go of everything, with a tone like a wise old man who had transcended life.

[The remaining two are the last evidence of my world that I have kept. They'll do.] [Ring of the Empire's Succession] [Health +3000] [Strength +500] [Attack +300] [Defense +300] [A ring that proves the succession of the empire. But the empire of the already-destroyed world has no value.] [Bardley's Memento] [A small earring that Bardley, the prince of the destroyed world, had worn since he was a child and never took off. His resentment and all his emotions are contained within.]

The memento looked like a material item. It was an extremely excellent reward. If it were usual, he would have been very satisfied, but Taesan's face did not show any signs of joy.

"You..."

Taesan, who was about to say something to the ghost, closed his mouth.

The ghost looked very complicated. He needed time to organize his thoughts.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He left the ghost alone and began to confirm the reward.

His level had risen to 3. Because he had defeated two adventurers, his stats and skill proficiency had also increased significantly due to the experience points.

However, what caught his attention was not the small numerical values.

[Special Activation Skill: Necromancy] [Proficiency: 1%] [Mana Consumption: 2500] [Can revive the corpse of the dead, giving it self-awareness and intelligence. However, the revived being's race is fixed as undead, and it is weaker than when it was alive. If it takes significant damage, the magic is released. Currently, only up to three corpses can be revived.]

Sosiet had revived the ghost's corpse and obtained the skill that allowed him to cheat death. He had acquired Necromancy.

It was a skill related to revival. Although it had many restrictions, he could still summon the dead to the battlefield. He could gather information while exploring the labyrinth and it would also be a significant help in combat. He wanted to try it out, but it was impossible since Bardley and Sosiet's corpses had disappeared.

And he had obtained the power of the god of death, Derusha's authority.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Special Active Skill: Cradle of Death] [Proficiency: 1%] [Consumes ??? : ???] [You can escape from being driven to death, excluding physical damage. Additionally, you can exert a weak influence over the dead.]

If it's something that drives you to death, it would mean instant death or spiritual death.

But for Taesan, this part wasn't particularly significant.

Most instant death declarations didn't affect Taesan. Only a transcendent-level strong person could deal damage to Taesan, but now that he had crossed the boundary, he could escape from the concept of death.

Still, it was reassuring to be able to completely ignore death declarations when facing transcendent or high-ranking gods.

What was important was the explanation that followed.

[This is…….]

The quiet ghost murmured.

It was written that the Cradle of Death could exert influence over the dead.

And the ghost was a dead person.

[What kind of influence is that.]

"Wait for a moment."

[You activated the Cradle of Death.]

The power of the God of Death, Derusha, was activated.

Death drew closer to Taesan, gently embracing him like a mother's womb.

And Taesan was able to understand the ghost on a more fundamental level.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The power of Taesan enveloped the ghost. The ghost let out a small sigh. A very strange sensation covered him.

"...This is about right."

Taesan cancelled his authority and took a breath.

Even though he had only used it for a short time, the burden was enormous. It felt like death was forcibly pulling Taesan towards it.

"But I roughly know the feeling."

The ghost's soul was being pulled somewhere.

He didn't know where it was, but it was probably where the dead who were freed from the labyrinth went.

Something was blocking it right now.

It was the power that Exirea had bestowed upon the ghost to give it a reprieve. It seemed to be that.

Taesan's cradle of death also had the same power as Exirea's authority, which could hold onto the ghost.

However, the limit was clear. He could exert influence over the ghost, but it was very weak. He couldn't keep the ghost by his side forever.

In the end, the ghost would have to leave him someday.

Taesan clicked his tongue once and continued to examine.

[Soul Skill: Shin-Geom-Hap-Il] [Proficiency: 1%] [A state where the body and sword become one. He still couldn't see the whole picture, but he could wield the sword very well.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan drew his sword and swung it a few times.

Unlike before, he felt a sense of unity with the sword, as if it had become one with him.

"The God of Swords, Ehilri."

Ehilri was a friendly god to Taesan. When Taesan fought against the avatar of the High God, Ehilri even bestowed a blessing upon him.

He had revived Bardley and made him his servant, pitting him against Taesan.

It was unclear whether this was to test Taesan or if Ehilri wanted to possess Bardley's body and soul. It was an unpredictable move.

"Gods are indeed arbitrary."

But for Taesan, it was a good thing. Thanks to this, he had obtained Ehilri's power, which he hadn't even thought about.

Taesan began to examine the equipment he had obtained.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**[Broken Black Sword]**
**[Strength + 500]**
**[Attack Power + 1250]**
This is the sword wielded by the Avatar of Destruction, boasting unparalleled cutting power. However, it was broken due to its inability to withstand the Avatar's power.

**[Used ???]**
**[Obtained the Ankle Guard of the Slave Seeking Love]**
**[Ankle Guard of the Slave Seeking Love]**
**[Strength + 400]**
**[Agility + 400]**
**[Attack Power + 700]**
**[Defense + 1000]**
This ankle guard was obtained by a slave who desperately sought someone's love and offered themselves to the God of Desire. Unfortunately, the owner of the ankle guard forgot the slave's name.

**[Those who equip this item will receive the attention of the God of Desire]**

Although it had high stats, it came with the ambiguous effect of receiving the attention of the God of Desire, which was often not desirable.

However, Taesan didn't mind since he was already receiving the God's attention anyway.

**And...**

A change that could be more important than the God's power or the other rewards he obtained.

He could now create a boundary line around his entire body.

The effect was surprisingly simple. While maintaining the boundary line, Taesan could escape the interference of the world's laws and order.

It wasn't an unstable level that would shatter with even a slight impact, like a boundary rebound. It was a perfect boundary line that could even exclude physical attacks.

Perhaps it was possible to not only create a boundary line around his body but also to spread it across the world, as he had previously expected.

The problem was that the consumption cost was too high. The more he expanded the black boundary, the more divine power he needed to suppress it. He had to use up all his divine power to defend against Derasha's authority.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That problem could have been solved when the Earth returned.

Next, I'll meet all of humanity that has survived.

Taesan, who had finished the verification, opened his mouth.

"Is the emotional cleansing complete?"

[Whatever.]

"What are you going to do?"

Will you remain in the labyrinth or return to where you originally belonged?

The ghost had to make a decision eventually.

[I don't know.]

The ghost couldn't easily come up with an answer.

[Let's think about it a bit more.]

"It's all up to you."

[……Taesan. Can I leave your side for a moment?]

"Is that okay?"

[Now that I'm no longer bound by the contract, I'm free. No one can stop me from going wherever I want.]

The ghost had finally gained freedom after dying in the labyrinth.

Taesan nodded.

"Do as you please."

[Then I'll come back later.]

The ghost left.

Although there had been temporary departures due to the intervention of transcendents or mages, this was the first time the ghost had truly left.

Feeling a strange sense of emptiness, Taesan headed towards the 86th floor."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**[86th Floor Quest Begins.] [Subjugate the King's Sword in the World of Insignia.] [Reward: Ego Soul.] [Secret Reward: ???]**

* * *

The 86th floor has begun.

After passing through the corridor, Taesan arrived in a new world.

And the sight that unfolded before him was one he had never seen before.

There were countless insignia scattered all over the place.

Swords, shields, halberds, bows.

Thousands, tens of thousands of insignia were stuck in the ground.

Taesan walked on the ground.

The countless insignia radiated an extremely strong will.

"I've been pulled to this floor," he thought.

This place was originally a labyrinthine floor.

He didn't know what level it was. It could be the late 80s or the 90s. Taesan thought to himself as he proceeded through the floor.

Ku-gu-gu-gung.

After walking for a while, a sword stuck in the ground suddenly trembled violently.

The sword radiated an extremely strong will.

Peeing!

The sword was pulled out and flew towards Taesan.

With a clear intent to kill, it aimed for him.

Taesan moved his body. With an extremely light, minimal movement, he dodged the sword's attack.

Then, the sword's speed increased even more.

Taesan's eyes gleamed slightly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The speed that the sword is showing right now is an impossible speed for an ordinary adventurer to respond to.

Even if it were the previous life's Lee Tae-yeon, it would be the same.

"It seems to be a layer from a very deep place."

It seemed to have brought the latter half of the trial even at the 90th floor. Taesan, who had been dodging the sword for a moment, stretched out his hand.

Thud.

Paaang!

The air burst. The sword struggled to escape from Taesan's hand.

Taesan lightly applied strength to his hand.

His determination and willpower dominated the sword.

Kuung!

The sword shook greatly as if it had received a shock. It trembled for a moment, then slowly calmed down.

The sword had submitted to Taesan.

Taesan opened the system window.

[Sword with Will] [A nameless sword born in this world through self-refining, with no value as a weapon.]

"Is it a material?"

Taesan looked around.

There were various weapons such as staves, spears, and swords.

He could sense the will emanating from them. That will was targeting Taesan.

It was a strong will, like a guardian determined to defeat an intruder who had invaded this realm.

Taesan, who had been gazing at those weapons for a moment, threw away the sword and took another step forward.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In a world where countless weapons come to life and breathe, Taesan alone moved forward."

Note: "태산" (Taesan) is a proper noun, likely a name or a title, so I left it untranslated.
