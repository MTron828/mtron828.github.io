**Chapter 386**

**386. The Sixth Return, Earth (3)**

A week later, the Wave was about to start. People's faces were stiff. They were preparing for the Wave with tense faces.

To do so, the first thing they had to do was to communicate with other groups.

In the case of India, they didn't want to have a proper conversation, so they had to talk to the North Asian group first. Fortunately, they accepted the proposal unlike India.

Kim Hwi-yeon, a few hard mode players, Gang Tae-san, and a few North Asian players met each other.

"I'm Viktor Stanichin, the leader of this group and a Russian Alone mode player. Call me Viktor comfortably."

"I'm Kim Hwi-yeon. I'm a hard mode player."

"Hard mode?"

Viktor slightly tilted his head.

"I know there are Alone mode players on your side. Why are you the leader?"

"I didn't think I'd become the leader."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan said calmly. Victor sent a gaze to Taesan.

"......Is that the person Oliver was talking about?"

"Oliver? Are you talking about Oliver Khan?"

"I was friends with him before the world became like this. We shared many stories, and most of them were about you."

Victor quietly looked at Taesan and opened his mouth.

"We plan to cooperate with you. To be exact, we plan to move according to your will. In this situation, it's better to move according to one person's clear intention rather than having multiple leaders."

Kim Hwi-yeon's eyes widened.

"Is that true?"

"Anyway, our numbers are not many. Compared to yours, our numbers are insignificant."

In North Asia, there weren't many people to begin with. Even if Russia was included, it was only similar to Japan's population. Victor said calmly.

"A larger group swallows a smaller one. It's a natural law."

"Thank you."

Kim Hwi-yeon let out a sigh of relief.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When I saw Indian players rejecting them, I thought the Russian side would be similar, but fortunately, the conversation went well.

"But there's one condition."

"What's the condition...?"

"It's Kang Tae-san. Oliver Kan said he's the strongest player on earth. I'll test you."

Tae-san gazed at him with a skeptical look. Viktor sent a distrustful gaze at Tae-san.

"Oliver, he's not a liar, but... to be honest, it's hard to believe."

Oliver said that Amelia was a monster. She said that even if they all worked together, they couldn't win against her.

And Tae-san said that Amelia was a strong person who couldn't do anything and would lose.

He even told him that even if all American players gathered, they couldn't win against her.

Viktor couldn't believe it.

"If she's that strong, why couldn't she survive this far?"

"That's...".

Kim Hwi-yeon was hesitant to answer. It wasn't like he could say that a monster that strong had appeared, and it wouldn't be convincing.

Viktor spoke with determination."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We've made it here with our own strength. We've defeated monsters and arrived here without relying on anyone. We've survived as humans."

His voice was filled with deep pride.

Kim Hwi-yeon couldn't understand it.

"...How did you manage to survive with such pride?"

"What?"

"How do you still have the leisure to feel proud?"

They didn't have the luxury to feel proud.

They were barely surviving in a desperate situation, and if they didn't rely on Taesan, they would have all gone crazy.

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"...No."

Kim Hwi-yeon shut his mouth and looked at Taesan. Taesan nodded.

"It doesn't matter. What are we going to do?"

"Come this way."

Victor got up from his seat.

The place he led them to was where numerous players were waiting.

"The people here are all hard-mode players. Among them, there are 3,000 top-ranked players. You just need to withstand our attacks for an hour."

Victor said, as if making an excuse.

"Don't think it's too much. In the end, we have to entrust our lives to your hands. We want to see your full strength directly."

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's not enough."

Taesan muttered, waving his arm.

"Can we start?"

Victor was taken aback by Taesan's fearless attitude.

"Do we not need preparation time?"

"What's the point of that? We only have a week left. Let's just get it over with."

"......"

Victor's mind flashed with the thought "Is this real?" due to Taesan's extremely fearless attitude.

"No way..."

But Victor quickly erased the thought. He was a strong player who had cleared the 35th floor in alone mode, but even he found it difficult to defeat 100 hard mode players.

Moreover, there were 3,000 hard mode players here. No matter how strong Taesan was, he couldn't defeat them all.

"Then..."

[The group duel is established.]

Victor gripped his weapon with a tense face. The onlookers were numerous, as it was a huge battle. Players from Southeast Asia and North Asia were also watching with bated breath.

[The duel begins.]

Victor charged forward. The other hard mode players also rushed towards Taesan simultaneously.

In an instant, Taesan's figure disappeared.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What?"

Victor's eyes widened, and his body flew into the air at the same time.

It wasn't just him. Dozens of hard mode players who had been charging forward were also flying away.

"This is...".

"Let's end this quickly."

Taesan stomped his foot.

At first, the onlookers who had been cheering were stunned, but as time passed, they didn't say a word.

In less than 10 minutes, all 3,000 hard mode players had fallen.

After that, Victor never mentioned Taesan again.

* * *

"We're different from them, right? I told you so?"

"That's right."

Kim Hwi-yeon nodded with a bitter expression at Taesan's words.

South Korea was in a state where the power of Gosin was highly concentrated.

And to that extent, people from other regions were very relaxed.

They had the confidence, the luxury of not giving up what they had built.

Although they were receiving Gosin's invasion on the same earth, their situation was completely different.

Players from other regions who believed they could win by combining their strength and fighting couldn't understand the players who followed Taesan.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I thought that worshiping and relying on Taesan was weak and foolish.

"You can scold me. In a way, it's my fault."

"No, it's not. Something will happen eventually. Thanks to Taesan, we experienced it beforehand, so it's rather fortunate. But... the Indian side will also reject us for the same reason, won't they?"

"That's right."

In Russia's case, the number of people was very small. And the leader was close to Oliver, so they had heard the story about him beforehand. To some extent, it was possible to adjust.

But India was different.

Their number was not small compared to their own. There was no reason to yield like Russia did.

And unlike Viktor, they had likely only received information about Taesan through the community.

Kim Hwi-yeon finally understood why the Indian leader had such an attitude.

"What are we going to do?"

"...We're all survivors, aren't we? If we leave it like this, it's dangerous."

The upcoming wave is going to be different. Kim Hwi-yeon clenched his fist.

"We have to tell them somehow."

"Try your best."

Kim Hwi-yeon kept his word.
$@$v=v1.13-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She observed the Indian players who had built their bases at a distance, gathering information.

As a result, she was able to learn a few things.

Firstly, their leader, Hasan's influence seemed to be quite weak.

He was busy running around here and there, but people didn't seem to be following his words. Instead, they were more attentive to a few players who were dressed luxuriously.

However, they didn't seem to be stronger than Hasan either.

To understand the reason, Kim Hwi-yeon observed them closely and discovered another fact.

"What's with this? You still believe in religion?"

"Is it Hinduism or something?"

It wasn't just one or two people. Most of the players they observed seemed to still believe in Hinduism. It was incomprehensible.

In the end, Kim Hwi-yeon decided to take action after careful consideration. She would go and see for herself.

She approached them with Geum Jung-geun and a few hardcore mode players.

"Everyone! I'm Kim Hwi-yeon, the leader of Korea!"

She shouted desperately in front of their base.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The wave is about to start! It's going to be very different from what you've experienced before! We need to prepare by combining our strength!"

But no one listened.

A few people just glanced at her, but there was no further reaction. They ignored her as if she didn't exist.

It was as if they were afraid to get close to her, as if they would receive a huge penalty if they did.

Kim Hwi-yeon was about to give up, but she continued to shout.

"What a racket."

A person appeared among the crowd.

He was extremely flashy, adorned with luxurious accessories and a necklace made of precious stones, looking like a nouveau riche.

"......Who are you?"

"I am Brahman."

The Indian caste system flashed through Kim Hwi-yeon's mind. Brahman was the highest caste among them.

The man in front of her was a person of influence,

Kim Hwi-yeon decided to persuade him.

"I know you've been winning until now. But it's different now. With us......"

"Shut up."

The man cut her off.

He clicked his tongue and sent her a scornful gaze.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You're cowards and non-believers, I don't bother talking to people like you."

"...What?"

"You worship humans? You're shameless. Do you dare to try to converse with us?"

His expression was filled with endless contempt and disdain.

Kim Hwi-yeon's face stiffened.

"You're weak because you're waiting for someone to help you. I have no intention of being with such feeble people. Get lost."

"...You!"

The face of the hard-mode player behind Kim Hwi-yeon turned red.

Those words were an insult to their lives and struggles. They couldn't ignore it.

But Kim Hwi-yeon raised her hand to block him.

She asked with a stiff face, "I guess we can't communicate with you. Where is Mr. Hasan?"

"...Hasan. You're talking about that guy."

The man scowled.

"I told you to bring information, but you're just talking nonsense. It's useless to deal with people like you."

Hasan called himself the leader.

But in the man's current attitude, there was no sign of respect or reverence.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He's our leader. I won't talk to the likes of you. I won't permit it. Leave."

"What's that?"

Kim Hwi-yeon was taken aback. Then, what was the point of him coming to meet them alone?

She tried to press the issue, but the man turned his body as if he had nothing more to say.

"Anyway, when the Wave starts, you'll all be wiped out if you don't rely on someone. You're all going to perish. I don't want to talk to ghosts like you. If you survive, I might listen to you a little."

"Hmph."

Kim Hwi-yeon let out a dry laugh.

* * *

Kim Hwi-yeon returned empty-handed.

She wasn't the only one who tried to initiate a conversation. Other hard-mode players, like Lee Tae-yeon or Gang Jun-hyeok, also attempted to talk to them.

But every time, people who claimed to be Brahmins, dressed in flashy clothes, appeared and blocked the conversation.

They ridiculed and scorned them, spewing out all sorts of insults. At first, people tried to endure it, but as time went on, their anger began to build up.

"Can't you just do something, hyungnim?"

"There's no need to."

Taesan spoke indifferently.

He didn't think it was worth wasting his mental energy on something that would resolve itself with time.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Emotions began to build up between them.

"What should I do?"

Kim Hwi-yeon bit her lip. She couldn't be so shameless as to abandon people who were worth a fortune. She was trying to come up with a plan at that moment.

Geum Jung-geun entered her tent.

"Ah, Jung-geun. What's going on?"

"There's someone who wants to see you, noble lady."

"......Greetings."

"Ah."

Kim Hwi-yeon's eyes widened.

The leader of India, Hasan, entered the tent with a gloomy face.

"How did you get here? I tried to meet you, but they wouldn't let me..."

"I'm the strongest in India, so I can do something like avoiding their eyes for a moment."

Hasan said with a sigh.

Kim Hwi-yeon realized something from his response.

"You think differently from them, don't you?"

Hasan nodded.

"Can you call Taesan for me? And other Arlon mode players as well?"
