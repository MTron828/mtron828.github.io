Chapter 530

530. 95th Floor. Essence (4)

The awakened mental image devours Taesan.

He tries to take everything Taesan has and make it his own.

Taesan focuses his energy throughout his body. The boundary line surges violently.

Kwaaaang!

The mental image bursts out.

[You have activated Blink.]

You quickly put some distance between yourself and Taesan. Taesan looks at the thief with a scowling face.

"......You."

The thief raises his hand.

At the same time, a distorted blackness covers the world.

Taesan instinctively knows.

That's time interference.

The power to transcend time, which was stolen by defeating the avatar of the time walker. The thief has activated it.

Taesan quickly summons a black aura.

"Stop."

Kiiiiing!

The frozen time of the two collides, causing a loud crashing sound. The scenery of the mental image distorts.

Tzok tzok tzok!

Taesan dodges the fragments of time and clicks his tongue.

"What the...?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The interference of time is the authority of the one who walks through time. But what he's facing now is the avatar of the usurper.

However, the usurper used the authority of time interference.

It was like a mountain.

But it didn't end there. The usurper stretched out his hand into the air.

Whoa!

Space split apart, and a massive sword appeared.

Taesan knew what that sword was.

[He activated the sword of the world.] [You activated the sword of the world.]

Taesan also drew out a sword that cut through the world itself. The swords clashed, and a loud noise echoed. The atmosphere became severely distorted.

Kugugugung!

Taesan muttered, shaking off the waves of power.

"Why can you wield that?"

The usurper smiled quietly.

[Good.]

Uh-oh. Blackness poured out. It rose into the air and created multiple square shapes.

And then, one by one, they began to compress. Before long, several orbs appeared.

"......You."

Taesan's face distorted.

That was the authority he had obtained by defeating the gatekeeper in the previous return. It was compression."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The usurper swung his hand. The black orb flew towards Taesan. Taesan grasped his sword. The boundary line was sharply compressed.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

Taesan swung his sword. The compressed boundary line was able to crush the orb. He shattered the orb piece by piece and launched himself forward.

"Tch."

It was extremely unpleasant.

It felt like a parasite had attached itself to his body and was slowly sucking the life out of him without him even realizing it.

No. It wasn't actually different. Right now, the usurper was controlling the powers that Taesan had stolen through his spiritual energy as if they were his own.

"You're like a parasite."

[No.]

The usurper denied Taesan's words.

[You're mistaken. I'm not attached to you.]

The usurper's finger pointed at Taesan.

At that moment, Taesan's entire body trembled.

Taesan had been using his Chaos Call skill to envelop his entire body with a boundary. But now, that boundary was crumbling. It was as if the boundary was saying, "You're not my master," and was distorting and breaking apart.

"What?"

Taesan was flustered. His Chaos Call skill was losing control.

[Your Chaos Call has been cancelled.]

Zzzt-zzt-zzt!

The chaos surrounding Taesan dissipated.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And the power of the usurper crashes down on Taesan. Taesan quickly pulls up the boundary line.

But the boundary line wavers.

It was as if it was refusing Taesan's control. Despite trying to block it with the wavering boundary line, there was no way to avoid creating an opening.

Kwaaaang!

It collides, and Taesan's self-defense is shattered. Until now, Taesan's self-defense had always blocked even the most intense attacks, boasting an absolute defense that was close to nullifying attacks.

But it wasn't the case now. It was crushed like a sandcastle in an instant.

[You are my vessel.]

The usurper takes a step forward. Taesan's psyche awakens and attacks Taesan. The distorted and broken things gain hostility.

Taesan's body flies away and dodges. Taesan tries to pull out the boundary line, but it doesn't come out properly.

Kagagagak!

Taesan somehow manages to force it out and uses it to deflect the attack.

And in that process, Taesan realizes something.

The boundary line that Taesan had pulled out was flowing towards the usurper.

The scene was similar to what happened on Earth.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Whenever Taesan used the boundary line, he would get sucked into the crack in the sky. It was as if he had the same appearance. He tried to escape his control and restraint.

Only then did Taesan realize.

This place was clearly his subconscious.

But it wasn't entirely his.

Part of his subconscious belonged to the usurper.

[I am you.]

A quiet murmur arose, and his subconscious stirred. It tried to exclude Taesan and deny him, following the will of its true owner.

[Then become me.]

Power exploded.

* * *

Kwaaaah!

Power burst forth, threatening countless lives and targeting Taesan.

And all of those powers were the ones Taesan had obtained through his spiritual ascension.

"This is unbelievable."

Taesan cursed. Clearly, the powers he had obtained and controlled were now targeting his life.

[You have activated the call of destruction.] [You have activated the call of destruction.]

Like a mirror, identical powers burst forth, canceling each other out and shattering.

Taesan swung his hand. Mana gathered and took shape.

[You have activated the great collapse.]

Kukukukukuung!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The magic of destruction is realized in the world. The usurper wags their finger. The boundary line flows out.

Kwaaaah!

The great destruction is shattered. Taesan quickly prepares the next magic.

[You have activated a colorful, rainbow-colored dash.]

The rainbow color distorts and twists, dashing through the distorted world.

The usurper lightly taps their foot. The illusion occurs. Taesan's thing arises, blocking Taesan's enemy's attack.

Kukukukuku!

The rainbow color pounds, but the boundary line does not break.

On the contrary, the usurper swings their arm. The boundary line tramples the rainbow color, crushing it, and advances towards Taesan.

Taesan clicks their tongue, canceling the magic activation, and draws their sword. The boundary line slowly closes in.

Kaahhh!

Only then could Taesan block the usurper's boundary line.

Taesan must also control the boundary line to respond.

However, when the boundary line is pulled out, some of it continues to be drawn towards the usurper.

'I understand.'

The opponent was handling the powers they had stolen through their spiritual ascension.

Their ability to obtain or directly receive powers from the gods was not visible.

Their intention was one thing."

Note: There may be some nuances or cultural references that are difficult to translate accurately, so please keep that in mind when reading the translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What kind of existence is the one in front of me based on?

'Soul ascension.'

The soul skill he acquired in his past life. It was an existence that depended on it.

[Good.]

The usurper was extremely satisfied.

The things he had were slowly being absorbed into the usurper. His very consciousness was being dyed by the other's.

And the usurper was gradually getting used to the concept of this world.

The usurper swung his arm. A distorted boundary line rushed in.

That distortion was more natural than when it was first revealed.

[Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.]

It couldn't be perfectly blocked, and the nullification was consumed. The attack bounced back, and he quickly created distance.

The usurper revealed this.

His face was filled with greed.

[You are mine.]

"Can't you say anything else?"

Kuuuuung!

He rushed in and swung his arm. The mountain of taesan blocked and repelled.

But victory was not in sight.

This consciousness itself was slowly being dyed by the usurper."

Note: "Taesan" is a Korean term that doesn't have a direct English translation, but it roughly means "a massive or overwhelming amount of something". In this context, it's used to describe the magnitude of the attack or defense.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As Taesan used the power he obtained through his rapid growth, the usurper only grew stronger. However, with only his own power and the skills given by the gods, he couldn't find a way to break through the boundary.

Kukukuku!

In the end, he started to slowly lose ground. He lost control over the boundary and his own senses.

[Is this the concept of this world?]

The usurper wielded his power with a joyful expression. As time passed, the boundary was breached.

Kukukuku!

All attacks were nullified.

Taesan stumbled and grasped his sword.

'A vessel.'

Taesan recalled the skills he had obtained.

[A vessel that can hold and take in many things.]

It can hold and take in many things.

When he obtained the skill, he thought it was referring to himself.

But that wasn't the case.

It meant that his physical body was nothing more than a vessel for the usurper.

The chaos summoning also changed under the usurper's influence, meaning the usurper could exert his power.

Taesan finally realized.

He had to transcend mortality in his past life and reach the realm of transcendence. He had the qualifications for it.

But the usurper's existence blocked his path. As a result, Taesan obtained a distorted power called rapid growth instead of a normal transcendence."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The problem was that the surge in his spiritual power wasn't entirely his.

As the tainted peak was distorted by the usurper's influence, some of the surge in spiritual power belonged to the usurper.

What he had believed to be his own was not his after all.

Of course, it didn't belong to the usurper either. It was a twisted peak created by the usurper. Taesan also had control over it, that was true.

But in the end, half of it belonged to the usurper.

No, it was more than that. That being had a higher level of spiritual power than Taesan. If they had the same level of control, it was natural for the one with higher spiritual power to wield it more naturally. Taesan still couldn't perfectly control the boundary line.

At first, its influence was weak. Even if some of the usurper's power was inside him, it was like a mere speck of dust, not even a fragment or a shred.

But as he utilized the surge in spiritual power, his own power grew stronger, and the usurper's power grew stronger as well.

It was as if it would swallow Taesan whole.

That was not the usurper's avatar.

It was his own avatar.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"From the beginning, his half-ruined body was slowly being consumed by the usurper's control.

The boundary line slowly devoured the territory, making it impossible to escape.

And finally, the boundary line enveloped the mountain.

[You are mine.]

His body was dyed in darkness.

The right to control began to shift to the usurper.

'I was a vessel from the start.'

A vessel that could handle both the concept of the world and the power of the gods.

That was the role of the mountain.

The boundary line consumed his entire body. The mountain's presence was no longer visible. Only the usurper's dyed consciousness remained.

[Finally.]

The usurper revealed their emotions without any intention of hiding them. Their voice was filled with joy, as if they had fulfilled a lifelong wish.

The usurper slowly took a step forward. Their hand touched the boundary line that had consumed the mountain.

And at that moment...

[You activated addition.] [You activated the sword of determination.] [You activated transformation.] [You activated intense attack.] [You activated vital point designation.] [You activated multiplication.] [You activated copying.]

Whoa."

Please note that the translation may not be perfect, and some nuances may be lost in translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The darkness envelops the boundary.

* * *

Physical power reveals its form in the world. The conqueror, who felt something unsettling, stretched out their hand.

Whoosh.

The dark energy grows stronger, thicker, and envelops the boundary.

The power that surpasses all boundaries. No enemy could defeat it in a head-on battle.

It either withstood the attack with an extremely compressed black energy, or continued to accumulate and counterattack with sheer quantity.

Rumble.

But the boundary is broken.

The enormous physical power leaves an indelible mark on the boundary.

The conqueror is shaken. The boundary they had established was crumbling.

He had clearly grasped the boundary of the mountain perfectly.

The mountain could not resist.

But his boundary was collapsing.

He gathers more power, collecting and wielding the boundary.

However, even so, the mountain's darkness does not stop.

Rumble.

The boundary is broken.

The extremely compressed physical power is a singular authority in itself. Even the boundary cannot stop it. The mountain unleashes the power it had been holding back.

Kwwwwwwwwwwww!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And everything is blown away.

The boundary line is shattered and broken into pieces, scattering everywhere.

A massive power overwhelms the usurper. The usurper quickly wraps their body around the boundary line.

But the spreading physical force destroys even that.

The usurper is struck by the massive physical force. Their body disappears into the distance, leaving nothing behind.

"With this kind of physical power, I can even destroy the boundary line. What a delightful fact."

Taesan lightly swung his sword.

His expression was carefree, without a single worry.

"Then, how can I win?"

Note: "태산" (Taesan) is a proper noun, likely a character's name, so I left it untranslated.
