**Chapter 555**

**555. 97th Floor. Möbius's Lizard (2)**

" Möbius's Lizard?"

[Is that guy settled in the labyrinth?]

Arilnan seemed to know about its existence. The wizard nodded.

"Yes. He wants to see what's at the end of the labyrinth. He readily accepted my contract."

[Anyway, he's a useless guy who doesn't do anything until the end, but he's still doing his own thing.]

"Thanks to him, I received some help. But this time, he's an obstacle."

"What's with that guy?"

"Taesan. I've been telling you, right? I'm not the only one who created the labyrinth."

Taesan nodded. It was an old story.

Creating the labyrinth's system and structure was difficult for the wizard alone.

So, he met many transcendents and proposed to them. He asked if they wanted to take on the challenge of risking their mortal lives.

The transcendents who accepted his proposal created the current labyrinth together.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Möbius's lizard. Leviathan. It's also a transcendent being that helps create labyrinths. Unlike other gods, it's a mechanical existence."

"Mechanism. It means an existence similar to Ouroboros."

"What kind of mechanism is it?"

"The end of everything."

The magician said calmly.

"The end of the universe. The finale of the world. It's a being responsible for that. When everything reaches its end, it reveals its true form and declares the end as a mechanism."

"......That's a huge scale."

[But on the other hand, until the end comes, it's an existence without a role, waiting for it to happen, right?]

"It's annoying. A distorted, twisted existence that originated from the universe but deviates from its own concept, that's the fact."

Taesan scowled.

"For such a reason? At this timing?"

The seal that bound the gods was broken. Many transcendent beings risked their lives to block them.

In such a situation, the mechanism of the end is going to test Taesan?

It was almost like blocking two powerful forces at once. Arilnan wasn't surprised by that fact.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Leviathan is originally like that. It's an existence responsible for the end of the world. Even if it's destroyed by the gods, that's just one possible ending."

"But it helped create the labyrinth, so I can't just ignore it. I wanted to put it off, but it insisted strongly. It says we have to fight now."

"Killing it is difficult."

"I wish it would hold back. It's a device for balance, after all. If it's destroyed, problems might arise."

"This is annoying," Taesan muttered.

If it were a quest, he would accept it, but it was a meaningless battle.

"If you clear it, you'll receive a suitable reward. And I'm sorry, but there's one more condition."

"What condition?"

"All the equipment you're wearing."

Akasha, Bardley, and numerous other labyrinth equipment.

"You have to release all of that and fight with the equipment you had when you first entered the labyrinth. That way, you'll be a worthy opponent."

"This is annoying," Taesan muttered again.

"But fine. I accept."

It's a quest from the floor, anyway. There's no need to refuse.

Then, it would be best to quickly settle this and move on.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Let's tidy up and move on. I'm busy too, so I can't pay attention to this."

[I'll watch with pleasure. I have that much leisure.]

"What's going to happen from now on?"

"Who knows."

The wizard looked straight ahead. The energy of the gods was spreading throughout the universe.

It's possible to temporarily suppress it, but it's impossible to stop it.

"The gods will come one by one. They'll pollute the universe and destroy it. We'll exclude the pollution and seal the gods again."

The wizard looked at Arirnan.

"Please, like that time, Arirnan-nim."

[You don't need to say it. I'll do what I need to do.]

"And... I'll ask you too, Taesan."

Taesan nodded.

"I'll go down to the labyrinth."

Whatever quest appears, I'll accept it.

The wizard smiled satisfactorily at that response.

"That's enough. Take care."

The wizard waved his hand. The space opened, and Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

Taesan leaned against the wall.

* * *
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This is ridiculous... I'm sitting in a place where the fate of the universe is being discussed. I've really made it big."

"What's new? Anyway, Akasha. Have you recovered all your memories?"

[......Yes.]

Akasha nodded quietly in affirmation.

"I remember what I was, my relationship with Arirnan-nim, and how they thought of me... everything. I was more cruel than I thought."

"It was an era of direct conflict with the gods, so it was probably more barbaric than now. Are you really okay? If you want, I can send you away."

Akasha was Arirnan's apostle.

Looking at their attitude, it wasn't a simple tool-like relationship. They had a more intimate and close bond, like family.

Taesan didn't think of forcing Akasha to stay. But Akasha refused Taesan's offer.

"Thank you, but... my current master is Taesan-nim. And I've received an unrepayable debt from both you and Arirnan-nim. I won't leave until I've repaid that debt."

"Very well, then."

"I've also regained my original power by remembering myself. I can become even stronger for my master."

Akasha said with determination.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's good."

The power and aura I felt from Akasha were definitely stronger than before.

Even now, I could confidently call myself a saint and it would be believable. If a being like that were to assist, it would have meaning even for Taesan.

The story was really over.

Now, Taesan could finally confirm the things he had obtained.

The three authorities Taesan had obtained by defeating the usurper were:

Concept usurpation, shattered wishes, and treasure box.

[Transcendence: Spiritual usurpation] [Proficiency: 100%] [Your soul has reached a higher world. A high-level soul can steal the power of its opponents whenever it wins. You can temporarily take control of the opponent's spiritual power and concept, making it your own.]

Concept usurpation had become a part of spiritual usurpation.

The usurper's authority had become completely subordinate to Taesan's authority.

Only one thing had changed. Originally, it was only possible to usurp spiritual power, but now it was possible to usurp concepts as well.

"I guess I've become a bit stronger."

It didn't seem like there was a big change.

Taesan couldn't help but laugh again.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Concept Plunder was a power that only the plunderer possessed, allowing them to plunder the world's concepts. No one else had such power.

However, that authority was completely consumed by the Eternal Plunder, rendering it meaningless.

"What did I get?"

Taesan muttered to himself, continuing to verify. The Concept Plunder wasn't that great.

But other authorities were different.

[Transcendence: Shattered Aspiration] [Proficiency: 6%] [One who hopes and dreams, but ultimately reaches a shattered destination. You can achieve your aspirations, but the result will be distorted and realized.]

"What is this again?"

It was an authority whose effects couldn't be grasped at once.

Taesan slowly read the explanation and finally understood.

The plunderer plunders the world's concepts.

His aspiration is to wield the power of the universe.

But it's impossible. What he does is ultimately just a simple imitation. He couldn't achieve his aspiration."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a form that manifested as a distorted wish-granting power. It was a power that could fulfill wishes, but its direction and concept were distorted.

"Hmm."

Taesan stroked his chin.

Was this a power that could be used?

It was possible. The fact that it could fulfill wishes in a distorted form was similar to a kind of self-transformation.

However, it was unclear how to use it. Even Taesan, who had obtained the power, didn't know how to use it.

There was value in it.

But he didn't know how to handle it.

It seemed like it would be okay to verify it slowly.

Until now, there hadn't been a power that was greatly helpful. It was a bit disappointing as a conqueror's power.

And then, the next power perfectly resolved that thought.

[Transcendence: Treasure Box] [Proficiency: 14%] [You can store what you've conquered in the treasure box and take it out and use it as you please.]

"Wow."

Taesan made a sound as he read the explanation. The corners of his mouth were raised.

He had known the name of the power, but seeing the explanation made it even more certain.

This was the conqueror's treasure box. It was itself.

He could store and keep the things he had conquered."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I roughly understand the concept."

The plunderer steals the concept of the transcendent being who was defeated by the concept plunderer. However, unlike Taesan, permanent plundering was impossible.

So, the concept is stored in a treasure box.

And the stored concept is pulled out and wielded as a broken wish. The three authorities seemed to play such a role.

Simply put, Taesan didn't need a treasure box that much. He was different from the plunderer, and permanent plundering was possible for him.

But the story changed when the spirit plundering began.

Spirit plundering allowed him to steal the opponent's spirit and concept during battle.

However, it was only temporary plundering. It would soon disappear, and he had to pull it out and wield it again.

But if there was a treasure box, there was no need to do that anymore.

The plundered concepts could be stored permanently inside the treasure box.

"It's good."

The value was overflowing. As he became more skilled in spirit plundering, the value of the authority increased.

This is the authority obtained from the plunderer.

And the remaining authority is the one given to him by Arilnan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Transcendence: Cycle] [Proficiency: 42%] [Independent concept of cycle. Itself. Can interfere with the cycle. Lacking parts, cannot be handled with complete authority.]"

"Is it already 40%?"

Arilnan had really given him a lot. The enormous power of the cycle was felt within him.

Taesan raised his hand.

"Bloom."

With those words, a red flower bloomed. It was smaller and more unstable than the one Arilnan had handled, but it was a clear cycle flower.

It wasn't just a simple implementation of a flower.

Taesan could now intervene in the cycle itself.

What could he do with this?

There were too many possibilities, and it was hard to grasp. It was the cycle of objects. He could intervene in every process that circulated.

Perhaps he could replace what he had lost.

"Hmm."

For now, he would simply do what he had actually done.

Taesan focused his mind.

The red color gradually turned to ash gray.

The ash-gray flower was implemented in the world.

He could mix boundaries and cycles.

Then...

Taesan recalled the beast that dwelled within him.

"......Maybe it's possible."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan turned off the ember-like light. The rough check was over. He headed towards the stairs.

From below, he felt a massive presence.

It was the Leviathan, the harbinger of the end of all things.

"What a pain."

But Taesan didn't show any particular excitement.

With a bothered face, he went down the stairs.

"Let's go in."

[This is the first time I've seen this. Let's do our best.] [Master, I will pray for your victory.]

Taesan gathered all his equipment.

And for the first time in a long while, he wore the equipment from the early days of the labyrinth.

Thud. Thud.

He went down the stairs and arrived at the 97th floor.

There was a room the size of a gymnasium.

And a red dragon, half the size of the room, was there.

[Mobius' Leviathan has appeared.]

Taesan gazed at the enemy in front of him.

[Ah.]

The red scales shone brightly.

The eyes of a reptile that had gathered all the malice in the world.

In its breath, white flames flickered.

The red dragon roared.

The king of dragons. Mobius' Leviathan, the harbinger of the end of all things. The guardian of the deep.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a kind of divine being that even gods couldn't treat carelessly.

Taesan had only a pathetic set of equipment to face such an existence.

The most basic heavenly armor and a rusty sword were all he had.

"That's all you've got? You expect me to take on a dragon alone with this? You're really living up to your name, Difficulty."

He was not alone, perfect and unshaken.

He could feel the gaze directed at him from above.

The light in that gaze was simple.

It was infinite expectation directed at him.

And admiration for the miracle that was to come.

They wouldn't dare to intervene, just like always, watching from afar.

Now, he was used to it. He drew his sword without hesitation.

[Krrr... ]

The dragon moved its front legs. It looked at Taesan and cautiously tried to retreat.

Fear was visible in its eyes, filled with killing intent.

Taesan sneered.

"You said you'd take care of it, so why are you running away?"

[Kaaa!]

The dragon let out a mighty roar, as if it had made up its mind, and moved its legs. The heavy body of the dragon approached with a loud thud.

He looked back. The door he had entered through had disappeared a long time ago.

There was no way to escape.

The battlefield was about the size of a sports stadium."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's always the same."

"Die or be killed."

"No, I can't kill. It's too bothersome."

Taking a step forward, the dragon threatens and lets out a loud roar.

[Ah!] [The dragon's roar engulfs you!] [Judgment begins.] [All stats are decreasing...] [Unable to act...]

...

...

"Get out of the way."

The system window that suddenly pops up is dismissed, and I draw my sword.

"I'll get through this quickly, so come at me."

[Ah!]

The dragon charges towards the mountain.
