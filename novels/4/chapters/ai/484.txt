Episode 485

485. 91st Floor. Uroboros (6)

I'm going in deeper. Deeper than this place. Into the abyss of Uroboros.

The maximum distance of teleportation is from the surface to the atmosphere, but somehow, I was able to move much farther than that. Taesan arrived at a distant location far from the planet he was on.

But Uroboros had swallowed the universe itself.

No matter how many times I activated teleportation, I couldn't easily reach my destination.

[You activated Teleport [Chaos].]

So, I continued to transcend space and headed deeper.

As I moved forward, I saw numerous planets.

And I saw millions of lives living within them.

The planets swallowed by Uroboros were not just one. Tens of stars with living beings were being devoured by Uroboros and merging with it.

Taesan passed by the planets. He could free them from the boundary, but it would be too exhausting since there were not just one or two, but many.

If I remove the source of evil, they will naturally be freed. Taesan gathered his mana.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the magic overlap.] [You have activated the teleportation [Chaos].]

By overlapping the teleportation of Chaos, you are released.

Your body transcends space and moves to a deeper location.

How far have you moved? Taesan realized that something had changed at some point.

Until now, except for the time that forcibly returned at regular intervals, the influence of Uroboros was not strongly felt.

But it was different from here on. Just by existing in this space, the flow of time in your body was being distorted.

Taesan covered his entire body in black. The power of Uroboros, which was trying to seep in, was blocked by the black.

"It's getting closer."

It's heading towards the center from the periphery. Therefore, the power of Uroboros was becoming stronger.

Taesan, who had confirmed that he was heading in the right direction, activated the teleportation again to move to an even deeper location.

The farther he moved, the stronger the power of Uroboros felt from all directions. If he hadn't covered himself in black, Taesan would have felt a strong sense of oppression.

"There's nothing alive."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Things that once seemed like life occasionally appeared. Among them, there were those who seemed to have reached the realm of immortality.

Perhaps they were the ones who had set out to find the Uroboros, as the first immortal they met had said.

However, they had all been consumed by power and had long since transformed into forms that could no longer be called living.

Taesan went deeper. Even though he traversed space, the distance was still incredibly far. He moved non-stop for several days.

And as a result, Taesan was able to reach the deepest part.

"Hmm."

Taesan let out a short sigh. The blackness that enveloped his entire body was screaming and writhing in agony.

From here on, even the blackness couldn't withstand it.

Taesan wrapped his entire body in a boundary and looked around.

[...What is this place?]

A ghost murmured in a disbelieving tone.

The space and time were distorted and twisted, like a hallucination.

[This doesn't seem like a good place to stay for long.]

"I'll leave once I achieve my goal."

To do that, he first had to find the location of the snake.

Taesan began to move, protecting himself.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But the snake didn't easily reveal its appearance. The distorted space and time confused his vision and senses.

It seemed like he had to solve that first in order to understand.

Taesan came to a conclusion and gathered his strength.

[You have activated the Great Collapse [Chaos].]

The mixed power burst forth from the depths of Uroboros.

The fog-like space and time were forcibly excluded, and Taesan's field of vision expanded. Taesan quickly scanned his surroundings.

The snake was nowhere to be seen.

Instead, something else appeared.

Taesan narrowed his eyes.

"What is that?"

It was a formless power.

Something was stuck to the distorted space and time, like a parasite. It was twisting space and time, erasing the meaning and value contained within.

And from the formless power, he could sense the aura of Gosin.

"Was the reason Uroboros was destroyed because of Gosin?"

He wasn't surprised, as he had expected as much. The magician must have suspected it too. If Uroboros was being controlled by someone, the only being capable of doing so was Gosin.

Taesan was about to move to confirm his suspicions.

[Dare!!!]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The voice that shook the heavens struck the ears of Taesan. The sound of space tearing apart caused Taesan to reflexively draw his sword.

[You dare to come here!]

A massive power enveloped Taesan.

What was contained within was a condensed concept.

If he were to be hit by that, he would die. Skills and everything else would be meaningless. That attack had a power that could not be matched.

Taesan raised his boundary line to its limits. He fiercely struck down at the power that was enveloping him.

Kwaaaang!

The power exploded.

Space trembled. Taesan's eyebrows twitched. His boundary line was unable to push back against the power that was enveloping him.

It wasn't for any other reason. The power itself was purely heavy. It wasn't just a simple weight, but rather everything about the being was contained within. The density was too high, and even the boundary line couldn't push it back.

Taesan sharpened his boundary line even further.

He gathered his energy at the tip of his sword and poured it in. The attack that was enveloping him was split in two.

Kugugugung!

"What the...".

Taesan clicked his tongue. His boundary line had been significantly consumed just to block a single attack. A voice filled with rage echoed out again.

[How dare you! You insignificant thing!]"

Note: "Taesan" is a name, and "boundary line" is a term that seems to refer to some kind of defensive or protective barrier. The translation may not be perfect, as the text appears to be from a fantasy or action-oriented story and may contain terminology or concepts that are specific to that genre.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A fierce killing intent materialized and oppressed Taesan. If it were an ordinary person, even if they were immortal, they wouldn't be able to withstand it and would suffocate.

[Die.]

A low, quiet voice spoke, and a massive entity descended.

The condensed law, possessing a physical form, attempted to kill Taesan.

This was a power that only a being who controlled and governed the law itself could wield.

It was a blow that surpassed Taesan's current state, a blow that was truly formidable.

[You have activated Chaos Call.]

Taesan's entire body was enveloped in a grayish realm. He took it in stride, focusing his mind and thrusting his sword towards the power that was suppressing him.

[You think your corruption will affect me?]

A mocking voice echoed, but Taesan didn't respond, focusing his spirit instead.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

The law itself began to distort. The killing intent directed at Taesan from the condensed law disappeared.

[What?]

A voice filled with dismay echoed. Taesan had broken free from the realm. The law that had been suppressing him had vanished.

"I'll kill you."

Taesan suppressed his subordinates with force, grasping his sword.

The being that had attacked him seemed taken aback, no longer attacking. Taesan spoke calmly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I am not your enemy. Great Transcender."

[…….]

In the distorted space of silence, I wander around. I feel the gaze observing the mountain.

Kiiiiing!

With the noise, power concentrates.

An old man with a grotesque face appears in front of the mountain, scowling.

"You... what's going on? I can feel their power, but you don't look like a slave."

"I am not on their side. Rather, I am their enemy."

Taesan speaks calmly.

"I received a request from the wizard who created the labyrinth and came here."

"What's a labyrinth?"

"……."

Taesan's words are stuck. The old man in front of him has no idea what a labyrinth is.

The old man looks at Taesan with a puzzled face.

"……Upon closer inspection, I sense the aura of familiar guys."

Taesan understands what he's saying.

He is in a state of being blessed by the Transcenders. Some of them have existed for a very long time, so the old man seems to know about them.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Something's off, but whatever. It doesn't seem like a small thing. Is that guy a wizard or something? I don't know who he is, but is he a transcendent being? Did he come here to scout out this place?"

"Yes."

"Hmm. This place doesn't seem to be at a level that can withstand it... and my laws have been interfered with, and that strange ash-like substance is weird too. It's quite unnatural. What's going on outside?"

The old man grumbled. Since the enemy had completely disappeared, Taesan relaxed his guard.

"May I ask about your divine name?"

Taesan asked quietly.

The old man was strong. He was overwhelmingly stronger than Taesan. Taesan had seen only a few beings with such strength.

The old man in front of him was a transcendent being, like Rakirates, Maria, and the wizard.

The old man replied.

"I am the Essential, the god of essence."

* * *

The transcendent being who governs the concept of essence.

Taesan realized that the old man was the great being that the immortal had spoken of.

The Essential gazed at Taesan with a narrow, piercing gaze.

"...You have reached the realm of transcendence, but you're twisted. I can't read you properly."

The Essential, who was gazing at Taesan with an inquiring expression, opened his mouth.

"You're here to resolve the issue of Uroboros, aren't you?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan nodded his head. Essential stroked his chin.

"I don't know, but... it's unlikely that they would give their blessings to someone untrustworthy. It doesn't matter."

Essential laughed heartily and patted Taesan's back.

"I suddenly attacked and felt sorry! I thought those guys were just small fries. I want to compensate, but there's nothing I can do in this crappy place."

"It's okay, but... are you referring to the underlings of God when you say 'mall fries'?"

"They occasionally come in here and cause trouble. I've killed them all, but they just won't quit."

Essential said with a smirk. If they could infiltrate as deep as Uroboros, they must have been at least immortal-level underlings.

However, Essential's tone didn't treat them as anything more than mere pests. And Essential had the power to back it up.

"If you're here to resolve the issue, then we're in a cooperative relationship. Two is better than one, don't you think?"

Essential smiled slyly.

"The fact that a change has occurred in this stagnant flow is a good thing."

"May I ask a few questions?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ask me anything. I'll answer."

"How long have you been here, Essential?"

"Hmm."

Essential stroked his chin, taking a moment to gather his thoughts before opening his mouth.

"To be honest, I'm not even sure myself. It's been a very long time, since the gods were banished from the world almost immediately after they were chased out."

It was similar to what the wizard had told him. Essential spoke with a scowled face.

"We definitely won against them. But those bastards had already spread their remnants throughout the world. That's why Uroboros was twisted, too."

"It's the gods again, huh."

"The cycle of the snake hasn't started yet, but the gods directly intervened and ruined Uroboros. Thanks to that, I'm stuck here too. It's really annoying."

"Do you know who that god is?"

"I know, but I won't say."

Essential opened his mouth.

"That useless guy. That's the one."

Useless guy. It was a name he had heard at the gods' outpost. Taesan muttered quietly to himself.

"I guess it's not the usurper, then."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"'The Usurper? Do you know that guy? It seems like the other gods are quite fond of you.'

Essential murmured in surprise. And Taesan was even more astonished by his reaction.

'Do you know about the Usurper?'

'Why wouldn't I?'

'...'

Essential glanced at Taesan's ring.

'Now that I think about it, that's also related to that guy. What a despicable guy.'

[Huh?]

Akasha's voice was mixed with confusion.

Essential turned around.

'Let's follow him for now. We can talk slowly.'

'That sounds good.'

Taesan's eyes shone quietly.

The magicians, including the demon gods, didn't know about the Usurper.

It wasn't that they had forgotten, but rather the Usurper's power had forcibly erased their memories. So Taesan thought he wouldn't be able to get any information about the Usurper.

But the transcendent being in front of him remembered the Usurper.

'Is it because of Uroboros?'

Although the exact reason was unknown, it was an opportunity. He had unexpectedly obtained information."

Note: "Uroboros" is a term that appears to be a proper noun, and I've left it untranslated as it may have a specific meaning in the context of the story.
