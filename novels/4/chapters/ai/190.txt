Chapter 191

191. 40th floor. The Child of the Demon (5)

Tai Shan drew his sword and approached Kwane, whose eyes were trembling.

The ghostly being read the intentions hidden in Tai Shan's movement and spoke quietly.

"Should I kill him?"

"There's no other way."

If someone with such talent were to understand Tai Shan's power and become even stronger, it would be truly dangerous. As the ghostly being said, it was impossible to save him.

"But it's possible to eat a snack," he thought.

"What should I do? Maybe I should just let him go?"

Breaking the contract of an immortal being was something that only the gods could ensure. However, the ghostly being spoke in an ambiguous tone.

"It's hard. No matter how much the immortal being regrets it, the contract has already been formed. He said it himself. The matters of the labyrinth are left to the existence of the labyrinth. If he had wanted to keep it, he would have blocked the contract itself."

The immortal being was an indifferent bystander. Even if Tai Shan was to summon the immortal being, it was impossible for him to break the contract or do anything about it.

Tai Shan knew that too.

He was thinking about something else altogether.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Petrusia's contract is a contract related to the soul and strength."

[Is that so?]

After death, the soul and strength are obtained completely. That was the condition of the contract.

"A contract is only a contract if the conditions are met. If the strength is not obtained completely or is unstable, the contract cannot be fulfilled."

[Well, I think so...... but how do we handle it?]

"There is one thing, right? The skill that has been a huge help so far."

[Uh-huh.]

The ghost understood what Taesan was saying.

[Ascension to the Spirit Realm......]

Taesan nodded his head.

Ascension to the Spirit Realm was when one gained strength when killing an enemy. This included not only stats but also the skills possessed by the enemy.

It was a kind of strength theft.

Petrusia's contract is to obtain strength and soul. Ascension to the Spirit Realm also obtains strength.

The two strengths clash, making it impossible to fulfill the contract. The possibility was more than enough.

[That's......]

The ghost's tail drooped.

Petrusia was an immortal. It was a contract with a being that surpassed mortal existence, obtaining strength.

Note: The text appears to be a conversation between two characters, Yu-ryeong (ghost) and Taesan, discussing a contract between Petrusia and a being. The conversation revolves around the concept of strength, soul, and the conditions of the contract.
Here is the translation:

Despite the immortal's best efforts and struggles, it was impossible to overcome the difference in strength. No matter how great the skills, they would be crushed beneath their feet and become meaningless.

However, the ghost did not give a clear answer.

The eternal mountain quietly drew its sword and presented it to Kwaneed. Kwaneed closed his eyes, as if he had already made up his mind.

The contract of the immortal.

With the power of an existence that transcends the mundane, it takes away strength and soul. There is no room for the mortal's skills to intervene.

However, if there is a promotion to a higher level.

Against the monsters of the high-ranking gods, even the angel of Hamon, the apostle of the forgotten goddess, and the will of Halfiran's destroyed world, which is related to the transcendent being.

Each of these is a higher-level existence than the mortal, but the promotion to a higher level was activated.

Can it be done? Can it not be done?

When the eternal mountain judged, it was the former.

The eternal mountain's sword pierced Kwaneed's chest. Kwaneed's life force, which was already close to exhaustion, had reached zero.

"A, Ah..."

However, Kwaneed did not die. He let out a sigh with a pale face.

Something vague and indistinct was rising from his body.

The eternal mountain knew. That was Kwaneed's soul, everything he had accumulated so far.

It seemed to lose its strength and remained suspended in mid-air.
Here is the translation of the text:

"A tremendous power descended simultaneously.

"Oh."

[Ah.]

The ghost unknowingly took a breath. Although it couldn't be seen, a huge will was watching this place.

This will slowly began to take away the power that had risen into the air. At the moment when all of Quane's things would be buried by the huge power.

A mighty power burst forth from the body of Taesan.

The power was not huge, but it moved towards Quane's power without wavering, very clearly. 

[Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your ascension has been activated. Your vitality has permanently risen to 854, your strength to 201, your agility to 134, your intelligence to 102, and your magic to 58.] [Your ascension has been activated. Your magic proficiency has risen by 3%.] [You have obtained the beginner-level black magic [Elegy's Thorn].]

A part of Quane's power is absorbed by Taesan.

[It's really done.]

The ghost said with a sarcastic laugh.

A skill that overcomes an immortal's contract and seizes power."
Here is the translation of the text:

The ascension of the immortal was a skill that surpassed even the immortal's own strength.

"Uh..."

Quande was still alive. Taesan gazed at him with an icy gaze.

The ascension of the immortal was not a skill that took away all of the opponent's strength. Most of the strength was still hovering above Quande's head.

However, the giant was no longer taking away Quande's strength.

It simply stood still, as if it had received a shock, and did nothing.

The ghost swallowed its saliva.

[I'm a bit too excited about this. Is it safe?]

"How will it turn out?"

Just as Taesan's words ended, Quande's determination began to stir.

* * *

The giant showed its anger first.

The waves of emotions began to distort the space itself. As the space became distorted, the giant's gaze appeared.

[Fear.]

My breath is stuck.

The ghost's presence seemed to be on the verge of disappearing at any moment.

It was the first time a being who had transcended the boundaries of mortality directly descended and was angry with him.

[Fear, my own.]

A thick emotion flows out with my voice.
(Note: This text appears to be a scene from a fantasy novel or story, and the translation is based on my best interpretation of the context and language used.)
Here is the translation of the text:

[Judgment of Death in Progress...] [Judgment of Death in Progress...] [Judgment of Death in Progress...]

...

Endless attempts are being made to issue a judgment of death.

[Successful Judgment!]

And succeeded. Petricia's anger is further fueled by the unbearable pressure.

[What an insignificant mortal. You dare to disturb my emotions with something so unworthy?]

Gah!

Emotions have a physical impact. The walls of the labyrinth begin to crack and crumble, making gold.

The pupil flashes with a bright light.

[Die.]

A gaze that leads to the existence of mortality is cast upon the ground.

In that moment, the bricks at the bottom of the labyrinth rise up. Quickly assembling, they block Petricia's gaze, heading towards Taesan.

[That's all.]

The assembled brick-like existence speaks calmly.

[Out of bounds. Petricia. You cannot directly affect me.] [...Magical tool of the wizard.]

Petricia's eyes gleam with a rough, savage look.

[You dare to block me, you insignificant thing?]
Here is the translation of the text:

The bricks that made up Balbamb's body began to scream. Despite his body crumbling down, Balbamb's tone remained unchanged.

[When I entered the labyrinth, I agreed to not directly affect the mortal. It's just a joke to play with contracts like that, and I won't bother with it. But if you're going to do something like this, I won't just sit still either.] [If I don't sit still, what can I do? Can you stop me, even without a magician in this place?]

Petricia mocked Balbamb. From their conversation, the mountain god became aware that the magician had left the place.

Balbamb agreed with Petricia's words.

[I am impossible. So I must call someone who is possible.]

Suddenly, darkness enveloped the room.

The force that had crushed Balbamb was erased. The space that had been distorted by the immense power was consumed by darkness and regained its balance.

Petricia trembled.

[A demon!] [That's enough.]

A black-haired girl appeared with a laugh.

[I was also holding back, but I won't get involved. The affairs of the mortal belong to the mortal. Don't you know?]

Petricia's power surged suddenly. Petricia's eyes became fierce.

[...I've made a contract!]
(Note: The text appears to be a fantasy story with magical elements, and the translation is intended to preserve the original meaning and tone of the text.)
Here is the translation of the text:

Just like a child throwing a tantrum to an adult, Patricia shouted.

[You had to take hold of the power according to the contract! But that was blocked by a insignificant mortal! Don't interfere!] [Of course, if it was a justifiable matter, I wouldn't have interfered. But this is different.]

Mashin smiled and pointed at Patricia with his index finger, gesturing to something beyond her.

[Your contract is with the power and soul of Quanah. You have to deliver the entire thing intact. But due to the strength of the Kangtae Mountain, part of the power has been lost. That means the premise of the contract itself has been distorted.]

Mashin's eyes widened.

[Your contract is broken since you failed to fulfill the conditions. Quanah's soul and power will be free. But what kind of power will it be driven by?] [……Nonsense!]

Patricia let out a loud scream. At the same time, a massive power began to stir in the darkness.

Mashin smiled, seeming to find the scene pitiful.

Kuuuuuung!

A quiet but massive collision of power occurred. The mountain kept its body as much as possible.

[This is no joke.]
Here is the translation of the text:

It was a collision between those who had transcended mortality. If the Master hadn't protected him, he would have died hundreds of times.

[Die. Petricia.]

The Master waved his hand. Darkness was spreading rapidly, filling the space. Petricia also raised her power, but there was still a significant difference in strength.

[If I go any further, I'll think about being trapped forever.] [You...!]

With that voice, Petricia's existence disappeared.

The Master lightly slapped his thigh.

[Is that it? Farewell.] [Yes.]

Balvabamba expressed gratitude.

[Well, those immortals are just abnormal creatures, anyway. Thanks.] [I was able to ascend without exhausting my strength thanks to you, so it doesn't matter. Goodbye.] [I won't bother you again later.]

The bricks that had been piled up collapsed.

Balvabamba left, and the Master approached Quaneed.

[Poor child.]

"Master... sir."

It seemed that Petricia's contract had been cut off, and his level had risen, even triggering a transcendence, but he was still not dead yet.
Here is the translation of the text:

But it seemed like it was all over, his face gradually turned pale and his vitality was draining away. He stretched out his hand that had grasped his towards Qin Wang, and said in a warm tone:

"Let's go together. Come back to me. I'm your child."

"..."

Qin Wang smiled and took his hand.

His physical body was buried in darkness and disappeared.

The space where the powerful beings that had gathered earlier were now only left with Tai Shan and Qin Wang.

Qin Wang spoke first.

"I'm grateful. A contract that has been fulfilled once cannot be undone by me either. So, although it's unfortunate, I had to give up... but I was able to bring him back to my side like this."

"It's to my advantage, isn't it? If this is the case, doesn't the contract with Petricia mean nothing?"

"Yes. You're the one who made it possible for the transfer of true power to be broken. You're the guide. They didn't get anything either."

"That's a good point."

It was indeed a good point. Just thinking about their faces, frozen in shock, was enjoyable.

"What happened to him?"

"He's alive. He received wounds to his soul and strength, but..."

This was unexpected.

I had expected Qin Wang's soul to be released, but I didn't expect him to not die. Qin Wang spoke with a smile.

Note: Qin Wang is likely a character's name in the story, and Petricia is also likely a character's name.
Here is the translation of the text:

It seems that the power of our agreement has been exhausted in the process of colliding with each other, and it's possible that it happened. However, it will take some time for recovery, but I'm sure I'll be able to return again someday.

"If it's possible, I hope our relationship was not hostile at that time."

"There won't be such a thing. I'll make sure to eliminate it exactly."

As he said this, Mars clenched his fist.

"This is my reward." ["Mars' interference zone has decreased."] ["You have obtained the intermediate black magic 'Amon's Negative Armor']."
Mars laughed.

"Did you receive a middle-grade magic from Jervand?"

Tae-san nodded his head. The power of the intermediate magic was a reward that was worth the hardships.

"Soon, I'll be able to give you something similar. I'll work hard and come down."

"Understood."

Mars left after saying that.

Tae-san finally relaxed the tension in his body.

It's finally over. And I've also received a sufficient reward.

Tae-san went down to the floor.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This place is getting closer to the center of the labyrinth." "The darkness here is thick and heavy. Most of the entities existing here are non-corporeal, existing only as spirits." "Start 41st floor quest." "Defeat the boss of the 41st floor and pass through." "Reward: Soulstone of the Weakened Spirit" "Secret reward: ???"

41st floor.

After reading the explanation, it seemed that there were many entities related to the spirit, not the physical body.

Tai-san went down a floor. And in that time, the guide of sin's path realized that something was wrong.
