**Episode 385**

**385 (Extra). The Earth on the Brink of Destruction. Lee Tae-yeon (5)**

"Isn't that beautiful? I brought it from the art museum this time."

At the tip of her finger was a massive portrait.

A portrait four times the size of a human body.

Taesan let out a sigh.

"Why are you, a woman like that, the strongest human?"

Lee Tae-yeon smiled faintly.

"The more desperate the situation, the more important it is to have an obsession with something. Why don't you try having a hobby like me? I used to think that art was meaningless in the previous world, but now I see that it has its own flavor. This portrait I brought this time..."

"That can wait until later."

Taesan cut her off.

"What's the point of this?"

She was pretending to be calm, but her mouth was dry and parched.

She had just blurted out whatever came to mind, without any concrete thoughts or plans.

To hide her confusion, she continued speaking.

"The hard-mode kid. Did I educate him?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There's no one else who can do it, so it's up to me."

"Seriously, this is a hard player for an easy player. It's a weird story no matter when I hear it."

Iteayeon looked at Taesan and opened her mouth.

"Status window."

Iteayeon's status window appeared.

[Iteayeon] [Level: 258] [Health: 45,810/45,810] [Mana: 7,020/7,020] [Strength: 10,152] [Intelligence: 9,899] [Agility: 13,254] [Attack Power + 5,421] [Defense + 8,456] [The target is in a state of fear.]

If someone else saw it, they would be amazed by the stats. Her light attack would be comparable to a hard player's full power.

Taesan's face was dull when he saw the status window.

"What's this, are you bragging?"

"It's just a simple confirmation, Taesan. You should show me your status window too."

"You're definitely bragging. I'm an easy player, so I'll just live in sorrow."

Taesan grumbled and opened his status window.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Gang Tae-san] [Level: 57] [Health: 1,021/1,021] [Mana: 820/820] [Strength: 105] [Intelligence: 100] [Agility: 98] [Attack Power +49] [Defense +58] [The target is in the best condition.]

Lee Tae-yeon nodded.

"You're still pretty weak."

Tae-san scowled.

"Are you going to fight?"

"It's just a simple test, right? Even so, you're not bad. Most easy players have stats that are much worse than yours. In terms of mana, you're even among the top tier of normal players."

Tae-san was extremely weak, but at the same time, he was strong. It was all due to the skills he possessed.

After exchanging a few words, Lee Tae-yeon looked at Tae-san and raised his fist.

"Just stay still."

[Lee Tae-yeon activated 'Addition'. His basic attack power increased by half.] [Lee Tae-yeon activated 'Multiplication'. His current attack power doubled.] [Lee Tae-yeon activated 'Guaranteed Hit'. This attack would definitely hit.] [Lee Tae-yeon's attack.]

Damage that could kill Tae-san over ten times poured down on him.

[Gang Tae-san's 'First Attack Absolute Nullification' was activated.] [Gang Tae-san took 0 damage.]

However, only a brief system message appeared. Tae-san didn't even take a defensive stance.

"What's going on?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

“……It’s nothing, really.”

Lee Tae-yeon wore a faint smile.

The strongest enemy-targeting skill, Philzung.

It was a skill that ranked among the top five in her arsenal, but in front of Taesan, it was utterly useless.

“Absolute attack nullification, absolute judgment, multiplication, multiple overlapping attacks, copying, and temporary time stop…… These are ridiculous skills.”

Even having just one of these skills would make someone a top-tier player.

Taesan had over 200 of these skills. That's why, despite having mediocre stats, he was able to survive and overpower everyone else.

“Did you say you got these skills from playing the Tower of Elements?”

“It's not the Tower, it's the Labyrinth. Why do you call it the Tower when it's a place you descend into?”

“Most people call it that, so what's the big deal? You're one of the few who call it the Labyrinth, right? Answer me.”

“Yes. Skills can be obtained regardless of difficulty.”

Lee Tae-yeon shook her head and reflected.

“We should have properly understood the Tower like you did. We should have focused on getting stronger to our limits instead of just obsessing over clearing it……”
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They couldn't do it.

They were so obsessed with clearing the labyrinth as quickly as possible due to their fear, that they missed out on most of the elements that could have made them stronger. It was only later that Iteayeon realized this simple fact.

"No way."

Even if she hadn't been obsessed with clearing it and had tried other methods, would it have been possible?

It was impossible. She couldn't become that kind of person. She was too scared to even try clearing the labyrinth again.

"Hmm, I don't know."

Taesan also had a similar thought, with a nonchalant attitude.

"It's already in the past, anyway."

"That's not necessarily true."

Iteayeon denied Taesan's words. Taesan looked at her with a puzzled expression, but Iteayeon changed the subject instead of responding.

"Anyway, you're amazing. If you had played in alone mode, we might have won."

That's right.

If Taesan had cleared the labyrinth in alone mode instead of easy mode...

We might have been able to defeat the boss.

Taesan would have been fully capable of doing so.

Taesan nervously waved his hand in frustration.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Are you done talking? Let's get to the point. You didn't go on a reconnaissance mission, did you?"

"Yes."

Lee Tae-yeon said with a serious face.

"The next wave is about to start."

Taesan scowled.

"How many are there?"

"Two S-ranks. Dozens of A-ranks. Hundreds of B-ranks. And a demon lord."

Lee Tae-yeon said calmly. Taesan nodded.

"It's over."

The S-rank is a monster that even Lee Tae-yeon can barely handle. And there are two of them.

Not to mention dozens of A-ranks. There aren't many hardcore players who can handle A-ranks and are under 20 years old.

And a demon lord.

Something that surpasses S-rank, something abnormal.

In reality, defeat was certain.

"But we have to try. Taesan, you have to take on the two S-ranks."

"What?"

Taesan burst out laughing.

"You want me to die?"

"You're the only one who can handle S-ranks. I'm too busy dealing with the demon lord to worry about it. You know that?"

"This is ridiculous."

Taesan complained, but he didn't refuse. He turned his body around.

"Shall we go?"

"At least we have to prepare our minds. Do you want to die without knowing anything?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It could be happier that way."

"I don't think that way."

Taesan went outside. Left alone, Lee Taeyeon muttered to herself.

"Taesan, you're strong. You can lead us to victory."

She forced a faint smile.

"But I'm a coward, you know."

In her hand, she held a rough, unpolished stone.

* * *

In the end, she couldn't say it.

She couldn't come to a conclusion, even after meeting Taesan.

"Hahaha. Hahahahaha……."

She burst out laughing, a laugh that contained despair and self-loathing.

"……I need to prepare."

After sitting blankly for a while, she got up.

She bid farewell to the people and traveled far from the city to the edge of the rift.

The apostle was far stronger than her. Just the aftermath of the battle would be enough to kill everyone around her. She had no choice but to fight alone.

The power emanating from the rift was growing stronger by the minute.

It was clear that monsters would come down in just a few minutes.

[You have activated the possibility of a thousand battles.]

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Escaping reality, she activates her skill once again. But just like before, there is no answer.

"What do I really want to do?"

She blurted out.

Even she herself didn't know.

She was still putting off making a choice.

Lee Tae-yeon gazed at the crack in the wall with a vacant expression.

If Taesan were to use the Oroborus's Keystone to go back to before he entered the labyrinth, he would choose the Alone mode. And he would risk his life to clear the labyrinth and become stronger.

Then, she would be able to defeat the solo sword alone.

But the Keystone, a consumable item, couldn't be handed over to someone else. Consumable items could only be transferred when the holder died with it in their hand.

At that moment, goosebumps rose on her spine.

If she died, she could hand over the Keystone to Taesan.

"Why...…."

How could she not have thought of that simple thing until now?

She easily understood the reason.

It was because she had consciously erased it from her mind.

In the end, handing over the Keystone to Taesan meant the same thing as accepting her own death. She was afraid of death, so she had blocked out the possibility itself."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But she had forgotten that fact now.

“…….”

[You have activated a million possibilities.]

She activated her skill again. But this time, it wasn't a simulation of her battle with the Four Gods.

What was being determined was whether Taesan could obtain the divine stone after her death.

“Ah.”

The skill's activation had ended. There was no need to fill up a million possibilities.

The answer was possible.

As long as a few conditions were met, it was possible to hand over the divine stone to Taesan.

“I…….”

Kuuuuung!

Her thoughts were cut off. The power of the crack exploded. From there, numerous monsters began to descend upon the earth.

“Ah, ah.”

And among them, the uncertain, abnormal monster, the Four Gods.

It was clearly staring at Lee Tae-yeon.

Ggggul.

The Four Gods approached Lee Tae-yeon. Lee Tae-yeon erased all thoughts from her mind and put her entire body into a state of readiness to take down the enemy.

The other monsters all headed towards the city.

Only the Four Gods and Lee Tae-yeon were left.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

At the moment when Lee Tae-yeon's entire body was tense, the appearance of the apostle changed.

The false body began to expand, engulfing the world.

She stomped her foot. She pulled out all her cards and charged towards the apostle.

* * *

Kwaaaang!

She did her best.

She poured out everything and pressured the apostle.

As a result, the apostle's false body was slowly being pushed back by her.

Even though she had the upper hand in the battle, Lee Tae-yeon's expression was not bright at all. She already knew that this was a meaningless process, having seen the possibilities.

Gulung.

In an instant, the apostle's appearance distorted.

The apostle transformed into a human-like figure wearing a robe.

It was holding a massive scythe.

The apostle, now in human form, moved the scythe.

Lee Tae-yeon sensed it. If she stayed still, she would die.

And if she tried to move normally to avoid it, it would lead to the same result.

Her ring glowed, and at the same time, Lee Tae-yeon's body moved backward.

The space where she was standing was cut off.

"......Ha."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was purely luck that I was able to avoid the attack just now. Even if I were told to avoid it again, I couldn't guarantee that I could do it."

"That's the true power of the apostle."

The scythe swung again, cutting through dozens of spaces at once. Lee Tae-yeon let out a scream and leapt away.

She resisted desperately.

She refused to back down against an overwhelming enemy and tried to win. It was a clearly great challenge.

But even so, it was impossible to make the impossible possible.

"Aaagh!"

The scythe swung again, cutting through Lee Tae-yeon's body. In that moment, her body transcended space.

Crash.

At the same time, the ring shattered. Lee Tae-yeon clenched her fist with a pale, drained face.

Most of the equipment she had was destroyed. The precious items she had cherished were all used up in the previous wave.

There was no chance of winning, but she struggled desperately.

And the apostle transformed, mocking her, becoming a woman holding a bow and drawing the string.

The arrow pierced the air. Lee Tae-yeon raised her shield.

Crash.

"Kuh..."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The shield broke, and Lee Tae-yeon rolled on the ground. She tried to get up with her trembling legs, but her body wouldn't listen.

There's no way to win.

I have to escape.

She opened her inventory with her trembling arm.

[You have activated designated movement.]

Lee Tae-yeon's body was summoned to the center of the ruined city.

"I'm sorry. I couldn't win. The apostle will soon cover everything, so everyone should...”

She tried to warn them, but her words were cut off.

There was no one there. Only destroyed buildings and scattered corpses were visible.

In an instant, Lee Tae-yeon sensed her surroundings and realized.

Everyone was dead.

She was the only one left alive.

"…That's not it."

Lee Tae-yeon looked up.

From far away, in a place that couldn't be seen, she felt a single living being and a powerful monster.

It was Taesan. She knew it.

But Taesan's condition wasn't good either. Even if he managed to defeat the monster, he would surely be on the brink of death.

"Hahaha..."

A cold, mirthless laughter flowed out.

The only ones left alive on earth were her and Taesan.

Humanity had been annihilated.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What are you...…"

Deep and intense emotions overflowed from within her. The emotional energy resonated with her surroundings, destroying and trampling everything around her.

She clenched her fists.

She wanted revenge.

She wanted to bite his neck and grab his ankles, ruining his plans.

But she was lacking. She didn't have the strength or mental power to do so.

"……."

Lee Tae-yeon looked up.

On the other side, the battle was still ongoing.

Kang Tae-san.

He was still alive, facing off against two S-grade opponents. In fact, he had even taken down one of them. He was achieving the impossible.

She was no match for him.

But if it was Tae-san, it was different.

[You have activated the possibility of a thousand tries.]

Could Tae-san find the jade stone she was holding after her death?

First attempt.

Success.

The answer came out on the first try out of a thousand.

Then, all that was needed was her determination.

"……I'm sorry, Tae-san. I'm passing it on to you."

She muttered softly. A terrible energy was approaching her.

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She swung her sword at the apostle's attack.

Until the very end, Lee Tae-yeon did not give up.

She rolled on the ground, eating dirt and dust, and struggled to win.

But soon, she collapsed.

"Aaagh!"

She fell to the ground, and blood spurted out of her mouth.

There was no longer any way to survive. She had used up all her skills and items.

The apostle slowly approached her.

Terrified, she fumbled and pulled out a stone.

The apostle, transformed into a reaper-like figure, sneered and raised its scythe.

If that scythe swung down, she would die.

Fear overwhelmed her.

She didn't want to die.

She wanted to survive.

And the method to do so was in her hand.

If she used the stone, she could survive. She could escape right away. She could abandon everything and find her own peace.

Her survival instinct, which had driven her to clear the labyrinth, forced her to use the stone.

"Shut up……."

But she endured. She cried, her whole body trembling, and suppressed her instinct.

The scythe drew a line of death.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She closed her eyes.

[You took @#!!!!# damage.] [You have died.]

She died like that.

.

.

.

[The orb that held something activated.] [……'s authority is revealed. In exchange, ……'s interference domain decreases.]

And her consciousness revived.

* * *

"Huh?"

I Tae-yeon opened her eyes with a startled face.

The place was a dark space.

It was thick and cool, but at the same time, a warm sensation enveloped I Tae-yeon.

It felt like being wrapped in her mother's womb.

"Huh, what?"

She looked at her limbs. She felt sensations all over her body.

"......How?"

Crack.

She heard the sound of something breaking. She hastily looked at her hand.

There, the orb that had lost its light was broken.

"This is..."

After briefly searching her memories, she soon realized.

This orb was the one given to her by an unknown voice before she left the labyrinth.

As she was trying to grasp the situation, a voice rang out.

[Are you conscious?]

She hastily turned her head.

There was a massive something there.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ah."

She was overwhelmed in an instant.

A being more powerful, thicker, and higher in stature than any she had ever seen.

"......God."

[Yes, child. I called you.]

God chuckled. It was a voice that genuinely seemed to be overflowing with joy.

"You're...... God, aren't you?"

The identity of the voice that had been watching over her in the labyrinth was the Transcendent One.

She had somewhat expected it, so she quickly regained her composure.

[I was watching over you through that orb, until your very end.]

"Ugh."

She was clearly dead.

She vividly remembered the moment of her cold, dark death.

For a moment, she felt a chill run down her spine and her body trembled. God quietly left her be.

[Have you calmed down?]

"Yes, yes......"

She slowly raised her gaze.

"Did you save me?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not that I saved you. Your body is dead in that place. That place is a world dominated by the gods. Even if we try, it's difficult to intervene. But... if we prepare in advance, we can at least bring back the soul that has lost its body."

"...Why is that?"

Lee Tae-yeon asked God.

"Why did you save my soul?" Lee Tae-yeon asked in a gloomy tone.

"I'm nothing. I just happened to clear this place, but in the end, I'm just a coward who passed the buck to someone else."

In reality, the gods disliked Lee Tae-yeon. They scorned her as a coward and didn't pay attention to her.

God laughed.

"That's right. It's a fortunate thing for me. Thanks to you, I was able to obtain a valuable talent like you without any competition."

"Do you... obtain me?"

"The bright flame that burns like it's going to set the world on fire is certainly beautiful. The sight of you burning yourself and shining is captivating. But I'm not interested in that."

God said, with a voice that was extremely sweet and enchanting.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even if it's a small spark that's about to go out, it's a method to desperately cling to its body and not let it die. Even if it's tainted by the muddy water and no one pays attention, it burns itself to illuminate the world alone. And that small spark can... be passed on to someone and become a flame that sets the world ablaze.

With those words, the space opened up. Lee Tae-yeon's eyes widened.

Beyond the space, the figures of Taesan and Sado appeared.

Taesan was fighting desperately.

[He is going to become a flame. The only one that shines more brilliantly than anyone else.]

The god looked at Lee Tae-yeon.

[But it was possible because of your choice, not anyone else's. The other gods may not be interested in you, but I am different.]

“…….”

[You are... a truly fascinating existence.]

The voice was filled with admiration and praise.

[You have struggled more than anyone else. With yourself and others. You couldn't choose just one and wanted to run away, but you couldn't. You have helped others more passionately than anyone else and lived with them. And in the end, you gave up yourself and chose others. I know all about your pain and emotions. You did well. Good job, kid.]

“……Black.”

The greatest being, who transcends mortality, acknowledges and understands himself, who has always been despised and suffered."

Please let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lee Tae-yeon wept quietly.

The god spoke softly.

"[Ah, won't you become my apostle?]"

"What?"

"[You're not an ordinary apostle. I think you have the qualifications to be by my side. You and I are similar beings, after all.]"

Apostle.

By the god's side.

Lee Tae-yeon was taken aback, unable to predict what was happening, and tears stopped flowing as he was stunned. But he hesitated at the god's next words.

"[If you become my apostle... you'll be able to see him again. And you'll also be able to confirm the results of your own sacrifice.]"

"Confirm... what do you mean?"

"[I am a god. I am a being that is not affected by the flow of time. If you make a contract with me, you'll also be able to escape the flow to some extent.]"

"Does that mean... I'll be able to go back to the past?"

Fear flashed across Lee Tae-yeon's face for a moment.

He had to overcome that labyrinth again. He had already died, but the thought still felt repulsive.

The god spoke softly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's similar, but different. Why? Because you don't remember anything, and you'll lose all your power too. You haven't had your own domain, you know."

"What does that even mean?"

"It's different. Even if time goes back, the contract with the apostle won't be broken. If there's a chance... I can recover my memories too."

"......"

Lee Tae-yeon closed her mouth. Her head was very complicated.

She turned her gaze to the space beyond.

Taesan, who was pushed by the apostle, fell to the ground.

As Taesan saw the apostle approaching him, he activated his time-stop ability.

"It's okay to get peace like this. You have the qualification for it. But if you have any lingering regrets... you can check the result of your sacrifice. It's all your choice."

Lee Tae-yeon stared blankly at the god.

"Who are you?"

The god smiled and answered. Lee Tae-yeon, who heard the answer, bowed her head.

Time passed.

Taesan, who had become Lee Tae-yeon's corpse, grabbed the stone.

At the same time, Lee Tae-yeon opened her mouth.

The god smiled softly. His power enveloped Lee Tae-yeon.
