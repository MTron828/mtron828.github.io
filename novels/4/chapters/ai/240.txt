Chapter 241

241. The Fourth Return. Earth (8)

Monsters are moving.

Attacks are launched at people who are in a state of panic. They scream and fall to the ground, their bodies battered.

“Ahahah!”

Lee Joo-hyeok grits his teeth and charges again.

The monster swings its long, black arm. Lee Joo-hyeok holds up his shield.

Thud!

“Ugh!”

Lee Joo-hyeok's body is pushed back. His eyes are shaken.

At first, he thought it was because he had let his guard down.

But he had actually managed to block the attack, using his shield. The difference in strength between the monster and himself was significant.

“Woooaaaah!”

Over a hundred monsters charge forward. The number of players in this location exceeds 100. It would be possible for one monster to be attacked by 100 people.

However, it was not the players who were retreating.

No one could stop the charging monsters. People are swept away like ants in a storm.

“Can't this be any worse!”
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ijuhyeok shouted with a defiant tone, holding his sword and shield roughly and charging at the monster.

He was known for his exceptional strength among hard mode players.

He had never been defeated by a monster in a 1:1 battle so far. He had the power and experience to easily defeat a normal D-grade monster.

Therefore, he had exercised his own rights. Because he was confident in himself.

Ka-a-ang!

However, he couldn't even defeat the monster right in front of him.

Instead, he began to fall back as the battle continued.

"It's unbelievable! The monster can't be this strong!"

He shouted, but the reality didn't change. He couldn't even properly block the monster's attack, and other players were being mercilessly pushed back.

If this continued, it would be a wipeout.

Someone cried out in a pitiful voice.

"Ijuhyeok-nim!"

"Ah, ah."

He was the leader of the group.

Regardless of whether he retreated or attacked, he had to give orders, but he was struck with shock and couldn't say a word.
Here is the translation of the text:

As people began to collapse one by one, a monster suddenly jumped down and landed in the middle of them. It was about to whip them with its long tentacle.

"Aa, aaaa."

When people sensed their impending death, the monster's head was smashed.

Kwa-cha.

[Monster HP: 157961, damage: 6879.]

The monster was knocked down with a single blow. The people who were fleeing in terror forgot about their situation and were shocked.

"Uh...?"

"Six hundred?"

They couldn't even imagine the damage.

And they heard that someone was pulling out such damage.

"Master Tae-san!"

Master Tae-san was standing in front of them.

* * *

Ku-ung!

The monster changed its target. From people to Master Tae-san. Only to kill him, dozens of monsters rushed towards him.

"Oooh!"

People were terrified. Those monsters were much stronger than hard-mode players. Even a large number of people gathered couldn't have a decent fight.

Master Tae-san clenched his fist lazily.

Kwa-ddeuk.

The head of the monster in front was smashed.

The monster's body was torn apart as its rough, whipping arm flailed about, and dozens of monsters burst out of its legs.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just like a storm, Tai-san handled the monsters. People stood in awe of his overwhelming strength.

"Oh, oh, oh..."

They knelt down.

Tai-san muttered to himself as he sorted out the monsters.

"It doesn't matter if you die or not, but you can't drag others along with you."

Tai-san's words made Iju-hyeok's body tremble greatly.

He waited to see if Iju-hyeok would regain his composure and give a proper order, but in the end, he was overwhelmed with shock and couldn't do anything.

This was also the case in his past life. When variables arose, he couldn't accept them and panicked, resulting in the deaths of countless people.

Kwak.

The monster in Tai-san's hand split into two.

Just as things were almost settled, a crimson rift suddenly opened. A massive energy burst forth and expanded.

And monsters began to emerge from that place.

The faces of people who had trusted in victory turned white with fear.

The crimson rift is a monster's entrance. If it's not removed within a certain time, the rift will open and monsters will appear.

Unimaginable monsters appeared.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

And the power emanating from the monsters that appeared was even stronger than that of the monsters earlier. According to the standards of the gods, it had reached the level of C.

Just by looking at one of those monsters, I could instinctively sense that all of them could be wiped out. People were terrified. Even the gods thought that winning would be difficult, and that thought flashed through their minds.

The gods scowled.

"It's too many."

He was annoyed.

So, he thought of dealing with them all at once.

The gods raised their hand.

[I activated the Starlight Arrow.]

Kiying.

The light was shining on his hand. The terrified gazes of the people were fixed on the light.

"Ah......"

They forgot about the situation and let out a scream.

The Earth's sun had disappeared from the sky, hidden by the tear in the heavens, a long time ago.

Although something seemed to be acting on the power, the distinction between day and night was still possible, but it was impossible to see pure sunlight. In the labyrinth, they had become accustomed to relying on torches and other light sources, so their eyes were accustomed to dark places.

In such a situation, the light that was now on the gods' hand was like the sun.

A warm and intense sunlight that enveloped them. Now, even the memory of pure light was lost.
Here is the translation of the text:

The majestic figure of Taesan, holding the mysterious object and calmly gazing at the monster, seemed to transcend human limits.

Taesan drew his bow at the approaching monsters.

A flash of light burst forth.

People who couldn't withstand the light closed their eyes.

"What's going on?"

Those who were fighting battles in the south also gasped and turned their gazes eastward.

The light seemed to spread out like the sun itself had descended.

"Taesan?"

Kim Hui-yeon was startled and murmured to himself.

The light began to fade, and people opened their eyes.

And they were shocked.

A massive crater lay before them.

The crater was very clean, with only the part where the light touched erased, as if the earth had been polished into a smooth shape.

And the monster was nowhere to be seen.

The monster that was beyond comprehension had vanished into the light.

*

"It's the master's light. That's a mid-level magic, right?"

"Right."

Minerva was impressed.

"That's impressive. To handle such a powerful light without any burden, it's clear that the magic was created by the god of magic himself. If it's mid-level, I imagine it's even more impressive at the highest level."

"Is there a chance to learn it?"

Note: The text appears to be a scene from a fantasy novel or game, and the characters and story may be unfamiliar to readers who are not familiar with the context.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as she cast a mid-level spell, it would work even in the depths. The characteristic of this spell was that its power would increase noticeably as her proficiency increased, and the value that could be reached was extremely high.

Given that, the advanced spell was too formidable.

"If you're the master, it's possible."

"Is that true?"

"Of course, I mean it."

Minerva stretched her body all the way. Her blue hair flowed gently.

"If you've made a contract with the king of spirits, you can certainly achieve that level."

Minerva smiled slightly. She glanced at them with a hint of a smile.

"I also have a magical level that's astonishing. It's bound to be different for you guys."

Tae-san was currently on the rooftop of a building. And around him, there were many people praying.

The object of their prayers was Tae-san.

"Life is searching for a target to rely on. Just like the people of Aurielia believe in their father, it's like that here. You are that target."

"There may be someone who doesn't believe in that."

In the eyes filled with reverence, there was only one. A look of doubt was present.

The brief rest was over. The quest continued to appear as a crack, and it actually did. The crack appeared regularly to them.

Therefore, they started fighting again.

"Block it!"

Lee Joo-hyeok shouted roughly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Obey my orders! Charge forward and wipe out the monsters!"

However, people only trembled with fear and did not follow his words. They already knew that Joo-hyuk was not qualified to be their leader, and there was no reason to follow him.

This fact made Joo-hyuk go mad.

"I'm the leader! I'm the one who leads you all!"

"No."

Tae-san stepped forward, his voice trembling.

"You're nothing."

[You have triggered the frozen world.]

A harsh winter descends. The monsters rush forth, and Tae-san freezes and shatters the entire rift.

"Oooooh!"

"Tae-san, sir!"

People burst into applause and worship for Tae-san.

"A, ah......"

And Joo-hyuk completely forgot.

"I, I'm the master. My words are correct......"

He stumbled. Tae-san looked at him with cold eyes.

"I don't understand you either."

He understood Cho-jung-hyuk. What he wanted was his own survival.

He understood Seo-jang-san. What he wanted was to live reasonably.

Note: The story appears to be a fantasy or science fiction scenario, and the translation is based on that assumption.
Here is the translation of the text:

But Lee Ju-hyeok was different.

Lee Ju-hyeok was fixated on being a leader.

It wasn't about life or death or survival, but just about that one spot.

Such stubbornness was meaningless in this world. All thoughts, values, desires, and everything would become meaningless when one died.

Even someone as strong as Lee Tae-yeon, who sacrificed their life for others, and Kim Hwi-yeon, who returned to the world after its destruction and negated everything, would have done the same.

They all would have overcome the labyrinth through their desperate efforts, crossing the crisis of life and death, and becoming stronger by sacrificing everything.

But they all died.

Tae-san also didn't return to the past, even if he had the power to do so.

That was the world at that time.

So, Tae-san didn't understand or want to understand Lee Ju-hyeok.

No matter what Lee Ju-hyeok did, Tae-san couldn't be hurt by him.

But it wouldn't be bad to leave a small warning beforehand.

"You can't become a leader."

Tae-san said to Lee Ju-hyeok. His body shook greatly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It can't be done that way. I don't have the strength to do it, and I don't have the reputation to follow everyone else. I can be the leader of a small group, but I can never be the leader of a large group. That's you."

"Ah, Ah."

Lee Joo-hyeok lets out a sigh.

He had lived his whole life as a leader. He had never once imagined being anything else.

"..."

Lee Joo-hyeok shook his head.

He didn't know what to choose, and it didn't matter what he chose.

The mountain was indifferent.

The battle continued.

Cracks kept appearing, and people went back and forth, removing them. People from different regions and those from Seoul worked together to adjust their pace and become more familiar with each other, and started to defeat the monsters.

The mountain had also created a new territory. The monsters weakened, and people grew stronger, making it easier to defeat the monsters.

And Lee Joo-hyeok continued to fight with a pale face.

He no longer gave orders to others or did anything else. He was fighting while dying, somehow managing to keep going.

"I'm bored."

Minerva wiggled her fingers in the city hall window. A storm blew in, and she blew away all the monsters.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Sorry to the lives that have been lost, but honestly, I don't feel much emotional attachment to them. They are B-grade, occasional C-grade monsters. They have to fight for their lives against other players, but to me, they are too weak. The Taesan replied.

"Soon it will come."

"Maybe it will."

Minerva gazed at the sky's fissure and muttered to herself.

"It's getting stronger."

The gozin is always aiming for the last moment of return.

The gathering power will become a channel to send down a powerful monster.

"'Is it the end of A-grade, or S-grade?'

The gozin made a contract with the gods. According to this, if Taesan wins, the gods will reward him directly.

The first one was Rakiratas, the power of struggle and death. The second was the dark magic of the demon god.

So, what will it be this time?

One thing is certain, that he will win.

And he will obtain the reward.

Taesan has prepared for the upcoming battle."
