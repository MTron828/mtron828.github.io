57. Easy Mode. Choi Jung-hyuk (1)

"You should get some rest."

Jung-geun rubbed his temples.

"But there's something I feel I should mention before that."

He looked at Taesan with a wry smile.

"...So you were the Taesan of Alone Mode."

Taesan nodded calmly. He let out a bitter laugh.

"This is really... ah. I appreciate learning the skill."

"Is it useful?"

"Quite."

Jung-geun used the breathless attack in battle against the monster. If he hadn't found it himself, it meant he learned it by following Taesan's post in the community.

"To be honest, I was skeptical. Still, I thought it wasn't completely unreasonable, so I tried it, and I really gained it. Quite something."

He murmured with amazed eyes.

"...It's unbelievable."

"You thought I was just another big talker, too, didn't you?"

"Well... sort of."

He chuckled bitterly.

"A bit, yeah."
Jung-geun, as a player of Hard Mode, nearly died several times. There were many situations where he would have died if his comrades who were exploring the maze together hadn't helped him.

But how could someone descend into the maze alone in an even harder mode like Alone Mode, without anyone's help?

To Jung-geun, it seemed impossible. Despite gaining the breathless attack skill thanks to Taesan's explanation, his thoughts remained unchanged.

So even when they made a fuss, he couldn't help but think their boasting words were pitiful yet full of pretense.

But it wasn't a lie.

Jung-geun looked at him with awe.

Overwhelming strength. Honestly, he couldn't grasp just how strong Taesan was.

The last, even larger monster appeared.

When the monster attacked them, he had missed the monster's movements. Now, it was an entity he couldn't possibly confront.

And when the monster reappeared, it was missing its upper body.

"Are all in Alone Mode like you?"

"No. Would you be similar to you?"

Jung-geun is strong now. There was little difference between him, Itaeyeon, and Kang Junhyuk who trembled as they descended the maze without delay.

Jung-geun breathed a sigh of relief.

"It's a relief."
Here's the English translation of the text:

"He too had done his best to descend into the maze and fought for his life. But if everyone in Alone Mode were like Taesan, if his efforts had been meaningless, he would have been greatly shaken.

Jung-geun bowed his head.

"Thank you, Taesan. Thanks to you... I didn't have to make a disgusting choice."

Sincere emotion welled up in him.

Taesan shrugged indifferently.

"I did it because I wanted to."

"No. I'm truly grateful."

He said quietly, his eyes flickering.

"If Taesan wishes... you can use me as you wish. I'll follow whatever you decide."

"Put that away. Seriously."

Taesan shivered.

"Just act like usual. Before you crack your head."

Such a polite Jung-geun. It felt incredibly awkward. Jung-geun twitched at Taesan's lively words and chuckled softly.

"Is that so? Indeed, you're as hearty as ever."

"Hearty?"

"You're older than me, right?"

"Probably?"

Jung-geun remembered he was 23. Two years apart.

"Then it's 'hyung' for you. Can I call you that?"

He smiled lightly.

It was the cheerful, always lively laughter Taesan remembered. Taesan replied.

"However you like."
"Thank you."

Jung-geun seemed somewhat relieved. As he unburdened his heart, a sudden wave of fatigue swept over his face. He rubbed his eyes wearily.

"Well then, I'll go rest. See you tomorrow."

He turned away briskly. A ghost of a smile flickered across Taesan's face.

["He's quick to change his attitude."]

"That's because it's an advantage."

To keep smiling amidst despair was itself a difficult task.

* * *

The next day. Jung-geun immediately started chattering away to Taesan.

Taesan responded with a not unkind expression.

"Hyungnim, so all those skills you mentioned on the community board are real?"

"If you've heard about them so far, you should know, right?"

"...Is enduring really one of them? How do you learn something like that?"

Jung-geun stared at Taesan with a weary expression. To be told not to strike back even when facing a situation where one hit could mean death. Such a tactic might work in a game where lives were plentiful, but it was absolutely impossible in reality.

"And how did you acquire such skills? You truly are remarkable, Hyungnim."

Under Jung-geun's sparkling gaze, Taesan felt slightly uncomfortable.
"He wasn't originally like this."

Although he approached him warmly, there was no apparent admiration. He acted more like an acquaintance than someone who admired him, despite expressions of admiration and praise.

But now, his face truly showed admiration.

"Did I save you?"

Since their meeting style had changed, their attitudes naturally followed suit. As he was about to pass it off casually, Kim Hwi-yeon approached.

"You're here."

"Oh, Nuna."

"Did you rest well?"

"Yes, my head feels clearer now."

"Good. Then I'll start explaining."

She glanced briefly at Taesan.

"Um... there..."

Hwi-yeon subtly signaled Taesan. Jung-geun nodded.

"Hyungnim will listen too, right?"

"Huh, Hyungnim?"

"Yes."

Hwi-yeon was taken aback. She had never seen Taesan before. She had thought he was just an ordinary person in Normal or Easy mode, but Jung-geun's reaction suggested otherwise.

"Were you originally friends with him?"

"No."

"Hmm?"

"Nothing's impossible, right?"

"Well... that's true."
She was trying to explain the overall situation. Even if one more person listens, it won't make much of a difference.

Hwi-yeon, who had been pondering for a moment, turned around.

"Then come with me."

They arrived at a small reception room inside the city hall.

"Um, may I ask your name?"

"Kang Taesan."

"Taesan?"

Surprise flashed across Hwi-yeon's face for a moment.

"No way?"

"Yes."

"Huh... So I finally get to see the person who was talked about so much?"

"I guess the story got around?"

"We talked among ourselves. Although I leaned more towards it being false rather than true... still, it seems it wasn't entirely false?"

She looked at Taesan with an amazed expression.

"Are you really strong? Stronger than Jung-geun?"

Jung-geun nodded slightly. Hwi-yeon let out a sigh of admiration.

"Impressive. Many of us have died despite being a group, but you managed to break through alone. Is there some secret?"

But there was no more than that in response. She thought there wouldn't be much difference between him and Jung-geun.

Their powers were nearly equal. It was a level that could not be controlled. Jung-geun smiled at the hint, but didn't bother to correct.
"Then I guess it's okay for you to listen."

Hwi-yeon began explaining with a calm face.

"Most of the people have gathered now. Judging by the noticeable decrease in the number of newcomers, it means everyone who's coming has already arrived."

She spoke calmly, but her face was twisted.

"Roughly counting, there are currently a hundred thousand people left."

From five hundred thousand to one hundred thousand.

Only 20% survived. Jung-geun bit his lip at the despairing figure.

"Don't know what kind of situation this is, but it's damn brutal."

She blinked as she spoke.

"The problem is, out of these hundred thousand, there are only a thousand capable of directly confronting the monsters."

"...That few?"

"You must have felt it bringing people here too. Unless they're among the top tier in hard mode or even normal mode, direct confrontation with monsters is impossible. In reality, about nine thousand of them are practically useless in combat."

Hwi-yeon pressed her forehead.

"Food is a problem, sleeping space is a problem, and we don't know what quests lie ahead... It's a mess of problems."
"Perhaps it would be better to stay in the labyrinth."

"I think so too. What's the reason for dragging us here?"

They were among the top ranks in hard mode, having already adapted, so they weren't particularly afraid of the labyrinth. They found it easier to just descend rather than face a situation completely blocked off like this. That was their immediate thought.

"And there's also an issue with the commander."

"Huh? Isn't it you who's commanding?"

In hard mode, Kim Hwi-yeon organized people into parties and managed basic strategies. Though they naturally assumed hard mode would manage itself since people didn't know the specifics of the alone mode, Hwi-yeon shook her head.

"I thought so too, but it's alone mode. Those crazy guys are making a fuss."

"Alone mode?"

Jung-geun chuckled unexpectedly at the mention.

"Why them?"

Jung-geun had seen alone mode and thought it was weak. It was about the same level as an ordinary person, and he thought it couldn't have any influence.

But Kim Hwi-yeon looked perplexed.

"Choi Jung-hyuk? That guy said he'd take command himself."
"â€¦Did you just listen to that without objection?"

"I clearly told him not to talk nonsense. So he's dismissing it as 'alone mode' and boasting that he can handle it just fine. That's why we're currently holding off."

Kim Hwi-yeon sighed.

"If it were a monster, you could just grab and pin it down, but because it's human, we can't do that."

The simple rule that the loudest voice wins still held true.

"And we're also fighting with those alone mode guys. It's a complete mess. A mess. They even took hostages, what are they trying to do?"

"Hostages?"

"Yeah. Itae-yeon and Kang Jun-hyuk, I heard they got captured."

"What?"

Taesan frowned. Hwi-yeon was slightly surprised by his abrupt reaction and hesitated.

"Yeah, they got caught."

"Why were they captured?"

Compared to them, they might be weaker, but they're not at a level where alone mode can touch them. If it's Jun-hyuk and Itae-yeon, they should be able to handle Jung-geun without much trouble.

But being captured implied a different issue than strength.

"I can roughly guess."

"How could that have happened?"
"We can't just stand by. We don't even know who's right or wrong."

They've never fought among humans before.

To intervene in a fight means to antagonize and attack someone.

That's why they were still cowards. They were adept at fighting monsters, but they were clumsy when it came to fighting humans like this.

"Still, no one has died yet. Let's watch a little longer before intervening."

"I'm not planning on doing that."

Taesan said indifferently.

He got up.

"Where's Choi Jung-hyuk?"

"Huh?"

Hwi-yeon's pupils shook at his sudden movement. She spoke softly.

"He's towards the left building..."

Taesan headed towards the door. Hwi-yeon, who was stumbling, got up.

"Wait. What are you going to do?"

"I'm going to crush the bastard before it's too late."

With a calm reply, Taesan headed towards the building. Hwi-yeon followed him belatedly, trying to stop him.

"Wait. Violence isn't the answer!"

"Why?"

Taesan retorted. Hwi-yeon paused at his composed question.

"We're already finished. The world has collapsed, and the law means nothing. But why not?"

"...Still, you can't."

Hwi-yeon said with a determined face.
"The order must be maintained. People shouldn't kill each other."

Taesan looked at her calmly.

Kim Hwi-yeon. A woman with stubborn determination and long hair.

She always tried to maintain strict order.

In the end, she died trying to save everyone according to the rules she had kept.

"You're always the same."

"What?"

Seeing her confused, Taesan said quietly.

"I intend to uphold it too."

But there are always exceptions.

Seeing Taesan show no sign of stopping, Hwi-yeon gripped her sword. Unable to stand by while people fought, she intended to intervene by force if necessary.

It was the moment she moved forward.

"Huh?"

Her body lost strength and collapsed. She felt a dull pain in her neck.

"[Kim Hwi-yeon takes 22 damage.]"

"What the!"

She screamed. How could she have been attacked when she felt nothing?

Taesan, who had knocked her down, brushed his hands.

"Just watch leisurely."

"Choi Jung-hyuk."
Even in easy mode, he formed a guild and built up influence similar to this. First, seizing control of the labyrinth, he asserted his rights and committed all sorts of wickedness.

Control over the labyrinth. Forced provision of items. Priority over boss monsters, and more.

And those who seemed likely to become stronger than him, he even secretly assassinated.

Usually, those unable to endure would rise up in resistance, but Choi Jung-hyuk not only relied on violence but also had political skills.

After subduing some people as examples, he created a model that prevented anyone from speaking out rashly.

Instead of simply forcing submission, he also offered carrots appropriately to make people accept it willingly.

There were times when the entire easy mode moved according to Choi Jung-hyuk's will.

Perhaps if it had continued that way, he could have survived to the end, sacrificing everyone while still voicing his opinion.

"Come to think of it, it's a pity. You've fallen apart twice now because of me, haven't you?"

Taesan, standing in front of the building's door, pulled his finger and smashed it. With a loud noise, the door shattered.
