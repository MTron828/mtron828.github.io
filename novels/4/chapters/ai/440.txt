Chapter 441

441. 86th Floor, The World of the Gods (3)

"Do you want to create a weapon that surpasses mortal limits?"

"That's right. I've taken a seat in the realm of the God of Blacksmiths for that purpose."

Kosrun gripped his hammer tightly.

"I know myself well. I can never surpass mortal limits. I don't have the talent or the confidence to do so. But the weapons I create might be different."

He smiled with a twisted face.

"I'll create a weapon that surpasses mortal limits with the body of a mortal, just like the God of Blacksmiths. My achievement will be recorded throughout the universe. Don't you think it's worth dedicating my life to?"

"It doesn't seem possible."

Taesan, who had reached immortality, knew this.

Immortality was a concept that differed fundamentally from mortal limits.

Those who had not reached enlightenment could not understand what that position was.

No matter how hard Kosrun tried, it was difficult to think that he could create such a weapon. Kosrun himself did not deny it either.

"Well, I say this, but it's almost impossible. But it's my wish. I won't give up. There's no better place than this for him.

There are countless excellent materials here. It's definitely hard to find a better place than this as a Cosrun.

"I'm finding a way one by one and trying to reach the answer. The quest I give you is one of them. There are weapons here that even I can't handle. I want to make weapons using those materials, so I hope you can bring them to me."

Taesan nodded. The quest was accepted.

Cosrun explained to Taesan with a satisfied smile.

"The burning red staff in the west, the cold sword of the north, the bloody whip in the east. Bring them to me after subduing them. If you bring them all, I'll give you a reward."

"Got it."

"Then go."

Taesan left the cave.

He wrapped himself in the layered darkness and started moving.

* * *

Taesan headed straight for his target.

He had already detected the locations of the strong weapons in the Leraize region. Taesan headed west first."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was a staff that spewed flames, floating majestically in the air.

The blazing flames engulfed everything, dominating the space itself.

Taesan inserted his body into the burning space. The staff, sensing Taesan, immediately showed a hostile reaction, wildly swinging its flames towards him.

[You activated Marcothias's fake flames.]

Physical flames manifested in the world.

In an instant, the staff's flames were suppressed. The entire space was covered in fake flames.

The staff trembled, seemingly flustered.

Taesan lightly stepped forward and grabbed the staff.

Kugugugugu!

The flames swirled around Taesan, as if determined to burn everything to ashes.

"Stay still."

Taesan manifested his will.

The flames that were erupting suddenly died down, as if doused with water. The staff, which had been resisting Taesan, instantly became docile.

The power contained within the staff was of a level that even Diana couldn't easily subdue. But to Taesan, it was of little significance.

"I wish the king's sword would at least put up some resistance."

Muttering to himself, Taesan suddenly leapt forward."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He gathered the sword of the cold and harsh north wind and the whip of the east, stained with cruel blood.

It was a quest that didn't feel tense at all, like a casual stroll. Taesan quickly settled the matter and returned to Koslun.

Koslun's pupils grew larger.

"Already?"

"It's here."

Taesan showed him three weapons. The weapons that had resisted and struggled were now quietly laid out on the cave floor.

"......It's real."

Koslun's gaze at Taesan was filled with surprise.

"Even the strongest person can't bring it back this quickly. Did you...cross the boundary?"

Taesan nodded silently.

Koslun let out a dry laugh.

"That's amazing. Really amazing."

He touched the weapons.

"If it's like this, I can't just make something mediocre. I'll make a weapon worthy of the immortal. That would be a good experience for my own desires. Wait a moment. I'll prepare and come back."

Koslun quickly ran into the depths of the cave.

Taesan waited for Koslun to return.

As he waited for a while, someone approached Taesan.

[Hello?]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It wasn't a cosmos rune. It was a ghost.

The ghost who had briefly left the Taesan returned once again.

Taesan asked with a calm face.

"Is the purification of your heart complete?"

[Whatever.]

The ghost's voice was subdued.

[I won't stay in this labyrinth anymore.]

The ghost's decision was to leave the labyrinth and go to the place where the dead should go.

"Is that okay?"

If the ghost wanted, it could stay in the labyrinth. It couldn't deny the possibility that it might be better than complete death.

And maybe, although it seemed impossible, the ghost's destroyed world could be saved.

[It's okay. With this.]

But the ghost spoke calmly.

[My first journey was to save my world.]

The ghost entered the labyrinth to save its destroyed world.

It broke through the labyrinth for that one reason and grew in power.

But it was killed by Sosiet.

Its first journey had come to an end.

[And my second journey was with you.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The ghost was with Taesan. He saw his efforts and perseverance. He saw his values. He watched how he conquered the labyrinth. He cheered him on, felt anxious, and empathized with him.

In the end, the ghost was able to let go of his desires.

And with the quest complete, the ghost's second journey came to an end.

[In fact, I initially wanted to choose to stay in the labyrinth. But when I thought about it, it didn't matter because I would still be separated from you anyway.]

The ghost and Taesan's quest was over.

And Taesan would eventually return to Earth. On the other hand, the ghost had to stay in the labyrinth.

[When I thought about it, the meaning of staying in the labyrinth disappeared. I didn't need a third journey. My adventure was over.]

"......You worked hard."

Taesan thought that the ghost was likely to leave him before returning to Earth.

The being that had always been by his side, providing information, helping, and chatting, was gone.

It was a big void for Taesan as well.

But the ghost had made up his mind. It was pointless for Taesan to try to persuade him.

Taesan was silent. The ghost also quietly kept watch by his side.

"It's all settled!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Cosrun suddenly appeared, making a racket. He grinned from ear to ear and said,

"I've got a feeling about what to make! Go ahead and tell me what you want! I'll make it for you, tailored to your needs..."

Cosrun's voice gradually faded away.

His gaze was not on Taesan, but fixed on the ghost.

"...A soul?"

"It seems like I'm seeing it for the first time."

[You're Cosrun, right? I came in after you, and this is the first time I've seen you.]

The ghost said in a tone of wonder. Cosrun was taken aback.

"Why is a soul here?"

"You were a contractor of the labyrinth, just like me. And your contract has ended."

"Did the wizard make a contract with someone who died in the labyrinth? But if that's the case, shouldn't you have returned to where you belong? Why are you still here?"

Taesan answered Cosrun's question. He explained that a transcendent being was involved and had given him some time. He also explained about the ghost during that process.

Cosrun's mouth fell shut as he listened to the explanation.

"That means you're a free soul now... You were a great adventurer in your lifetime..."

He muttered to himself alone.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Many lights flashed across his eyes. The ghost didn't show any interest in Coslun, who was about to leave the labyrinth anyway. To him, the ghost was just a meaningless opponent.

But Coslun's next words shocked the ghost.

Coslun let out a sly laugh, his voice filled with burning passion.

"Ghost, don't you want to become a weapon?"

* * *

The ghost was taken aback by the sudden suggestion.

[...What nonsense is this?]

Regaining his composure, the ghost dismissed Coslun's words. Become a weapon? There was no existence that would accept such a proposal.

"I'm being very serious. As a spirit, don't you want to become a weapon?"

[Do I have any reason to accept such a proposal? Isn't it just being trapped as a weapon? Get out of here with that nonsense.]

"It's not about being trapped! You'll become a weapon!"

Coslun shouted loudly.

"It's a concept where you're reborn with a weapon as your body! You'll have your own self, and you'll be able to act on your own! And you'll be able to become even stronger! You'll become so strong that you'll be able to surpass the realm of mortality someday!"

The passionate cry echoed loudly.

[...What is this nonsense, anyway?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The ghost was not present when Taesan and Kosrun were talking. Therefore, he couldn't understand Kosrun's words. Kosrun, who realized this fact late, calmed down and explained slowly.

"So, you want to create a weapon that surpasses mortality? What does that have to do with making me a sword?"

"I'm just a mortal, after all."

Kosrun clicked his tongue and said, "I don't understand the concept of immortality. No matter how hard I try, I can't create a weapon that surpasses mortality."

Humans can understand the principles and methods of how birds fly, but they can't understand the birds' senses and emotions. It's impossible to create something that transcends the realm of human understanding.

"But what if we create a weapon that becomes stronger on its own, with a complete sense of self? Maybe that kind of weapon could surpass mortality someday?"

Kosrun chuckled. "There are cases where artificially created beings reach the realm of immortality. It's a highly possible scenario."

"Is that your goal?"

"What I want is to see my weapon surpass mortality. I don't need anything else."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[So, can't we use the weapons outside? The weapons outside all have their own will, right?]"

The weapons here all had their own will. But Coslun shook his head.

"The weapons here didn't have intelligence. They only had instincts close to beasts. That's not enough. What I'm trying to make is not an Ego Sword. An Ego Sword is just a sword with a self, after all."

Coslun's eyes blazed with strong desire, spewing out his words one by one.

"A truly free, perfect life in the form of a sword, with a single will. That's what I desire."

A life in the form of a weapon.

Coslun had been longing for that.

"But to do that, it needs to have a complete self, which is the most difficult problem. I've been stuck on that, but then you appeared."

A gaze full of desire turned to the ghost.

"You, right now, are a free soul bound by nothing."

The ghost was not bound by the labyrinth due to Exirea's power, nor did it go to the place where the dead should go.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Don't think it's strange. Just because you've become a weapon doesn't mean your life will change drastically. You have your own will and can make choices as you see fit. It's just that your vessel is no longer your physical body, but a weapon instead."

Coslun continued speaking.

"If you want, you can travel the world alone, or you can accompany someone you desire."

[…….]

The ghost made a choice between the two options. He didn't choose the third journey.

But now, a new option has appeared.

"What's this? Are you interested?"
