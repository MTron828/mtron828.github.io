Chapter 157

157. 34th floor (1)

[What's up?]

A ghost that was standing still suddenly got agitated.

[I won! I won!]

The mountain collapsed to the ground.

There was no physical strength left in his body, not even enough to move a finger.

Although his physical state had returned to its peak due to the level increase, his mental exhaustion remained the same.

[You, what are you doing…….]

The ghost showed a mixture of shock and confusion, seemingly due to the appearance Taesan had shown during the battle.

Taesan raised his hand.

"Later, first."

He needed a rest.

The ghost seemed to have realized this and delayed its response.

Taesan approached the wall and leaned against it, then closed his eyes.

A numbness swept over him in an instant.

* * *

Taesan opened his eyes and asked:

"What time is it?"

[It's been about 12 hours, right?]

"It's been a long time."

It was the first time he had slept for so long.

Taesan first checked his physical condition.

His state was perfect. As his level increases, his physical body becomes peak condition. There was no problem anywhere.
Here is the translation:

"I never thought I'd catch that. I thought I would fail, to be honest."

"What would you have done if that had happened?"

"Well, I would have been defeated again and forced to start over. I didn't care about you at all."

There are many gods who show interest in Taesan. If Taesan were to die, they would try to bind his soul to their contract.

Additionally, Taesan has a skill obtained after clearing the trial imposed by the god Fabscha, who is known for his trials.

[Special passive skill: Proof of One's Spirit] [You have won against another version of yourself. When you reach the point of death, your soul will receive Fabscha's trial.]

The skill obtained after clearing Fabscha's trial.

However, I don't know the exact effect of the skill. The trial may be impossible to clear, and in the worst case, I may not be able to revive again.

It would have been best to end the fight without using the skill.

But he won anyway.

Taesan looked down at his hands, which were clenched into fists.

He felt an even stronger power coursing through his body than before.

A smile appeared on his lips.

[Is it okay to ask now?]
The ghost couldn't hold back its curiosity and spoke up.

"What did you do to dodge? The monster was moving before it even attacked."

The ghost had predicted that the mountain spirit would die before the monster's collapse, because it was impossible to perfectly dodge the monster's attack.

The damage from the aftershock was so severe that it was inevitable to be slowly consumed, and the speed at which it was consumed was even slower than the monster's collapse, and it was thought that it would fall before the monster did.

However, the mountain spirit had been gradually reducing the damage since a certain moment, and eventually, it perfectly evaded the aftershock.

Most importantly, the monster's last creation, the gray-colored swords.

The mountain spirit dodged all of the dozens of swords that were suddenly stopped.

"Is it future prediction? Or have you gained a higher level?"

"No, it's not that."

The mountain spirit shook its head. It was fundamentally different.

"It just... appeared."

"What appeared?"

"The monster's intention."

It was possible to know the intention of the attack and its location.

The ghost fell silent.

"Is that the skill you're using?"

"Maybe it is."
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san opened the skill window.

[Concept Skill: ???] [Proficiency: 36%] [The power of will is ??? and descends. Joining the will of all things, I sense and understand ????. I have obtained ???.]

Proficiency had risen incredibly.

Additionally, the content "joining the will of all things and sensing" was added.

Through this experience and the change in skill description, it became clear.

The ??? skill allows me to sense the will of all things.

"I didn't think this skill would be this useful."

Although I could sense will before, it was almost the same as not having it. The difference between recognizing will and moving speed was almost negligible, making it impossible to use effectively.

I only received a little help in avoiding traps before, but it was only a hunch. I couldn't directly feel the will.

But this time was different.

Thanks to being able to read the will of the demon before it moved, I was able to avoid its attacks perfectly from the middle on.

A ghostly figure on my shoulder, looking puzzled, spoke.

"[The demon has fallen, so this is possible.]"

"What are you saying?"
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have transformed into the apostle of the forgotten goddess, and with your strength, you have surpassed your limits. Thanks to that, your strength has become incredibly powerful.]

In reality, it was like that. Although you deliberately clashed with Tai Shan at the end, you still took a damage of around 9000.

Even if Tai Shan was in a state of all-out effort, the damage was almost fatal.

[Without intelligence, only strength and instinct remained. With a stronger will, you concentrated even more during battle, and your skills reached a new level. So it was even more like that.]

"Is it because of the overlap of various factors?"

[It seems like that. Is it because the conditions are met to a certain extent? It's really hard to use.]

As the ghost said, the skill was demanding and limited to a specific target.

However, thanks to that, you won against an enemy you would have absolutely lost to originally.

That alone proved the value of the skill.

Tai Shan opened his status window.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Kang Tae-san] [Level: 80] [Shield: 1029/1029] [HP: 12220/12220] [MP: 1915/1915] [MPG: 186/186] [Strength: 3433] [Intelligence: 2973] [Agility: 3298] [Attack Power + 482] [Defense Power + 343] [The target is in the best state.]

Tae-san laughed.

The labyrinth provided a definite reward according to the difficulty level. The status window in front of him was proof of this.

His HP, which had never been able to overcome the limit, was now surpassed by the level-up reward, skill reward, and victory reward. His strength and agility also exceeded 3000.

The ghost was unable to suppress his admiration.

"What kind of stats is this for someone who hasn't even reached the 50th floor?"

The ghost couldn't find a precedent for such stats.

"Let's go back first."

"That's a good idea. I'm worried about what will happen."

The ghost also agreed. Tae-san approached the statue of the goddess before leaving the ruins.

Even as the monster was going crazy, there was not a single scratch on the statue.

It was unclear whether the statue was being unconsciously protected by instinct alone, even in a state where only instinct remained.

Tae-san prayed to the statue of the goddess.

The statue turned to dust and disappeared.

[You have prayed to the forgotten goddess, who is forgotten by everyone. You have obtained the blessing of the goddess's soul, [Nameless Goddess's Blessing].]

This is the end of everything.

Tae-san stood up.

"Let's go back."
Here is the translation of the text:

As we passed through the corridor and returned to the labyrinth, Halfdan's anxious face was waiting for us.

"Oh, you're here!"

He looked at the Taesan and changed color.

"I was worried because I didn't think it would take so long. With your abilities, there shouldn't have been any problems."

"I almost died."

"Almost died?"

Halfdan's pupils trembled.

"Could you have won with the power you felt from the outside?"

"I did until halfway."

No one, not even the ghost, knew that he had found the source of the prophecy.

"Anyway, I've found what I was looking for."

Taesan extracted a gray, misty aura from his inventory.

"[Source of the Prophecy]" "[The core containing the source of God's prophecy, materialized by the will of the Holy Ghost]."

"Wow."

Halfdan couldn't help but gasp in amazement.

He received the source of the prophecy with trembling hands.

"This is something that surpasses my imagination. With this, it's definitely possible."

His eyes gleamed.

Halfdan opened the space and inserted the source of the prophecy, then looked at Taesan with a wobbly eye.

"So, what equipment do you want?"

Taesan began to think.
Here is the translation of the text:

Normally, it would be natural to think of it as a weapon. Since it directly affects damage, it was considered a equipment that has a significant impact.

However, the case was different for Tai Shan, who possessed the Iralak Mu technique.

All parts of his attack power were integrated, and regardless of which part he attacked, damage would be dealt. Therefore, the value of his weapon was lower compared to others.

Of course, it's not like he didn't value his weapon, as it was the equipment that granted the most attack power. It was still one of his top priorities.

Just then, a ghost appeared before Tai Shan and said:

"I'll recommend something other than a weapon."

"Why?"

"Because there's something to be gained below. If no one else takes it, I can obtain the weapon I used to own."

Tai Shan made a decision after hearing the ghost's words.

"Make it a ring. Specifically, a ring."

Since he could wear it, he wouldn't suffer any losses even if he changed it now.

"What kind of effect does a ring have?"

"Of course, attack power. Please prioritize it."

"Iralak Mu technique... it's a really amazing skill. I understand. With this material, I can make a pair if I do it well."

Half-ran was delighted with a happy face.

"How much does it cost?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"It'll take at least a month, no matter how fast you work."

Considering the level of the materials, the equipment was not something that could be completed quickly. In fact, thanks to Halfdan's skills, the time was shorter than expected, and Taesan nodded with a hint of surprise.

"Then I'll come back next time."

"I'm waiting for you."

Halfdan held the hammer with a face full of excitement.

As the sound of the hammer echoed behind him, Taesan left the blacksmith shop.

* * *

The quest is now complete.

It's time to confirm what I've obtained.

[Divine Blessing: The Lost Goddess's Soul Blessing] [The goddess's blessing has been bestowed upon you. Your soul has risen to a higher level due to the goddess's blessing. However, it's still a far cry from being a true divine blessing.]

I prayed to the goddess statue and received another goddess's blessing.

This time, it was the soul blessing.

"If my level has risen, can I deal damage to apostles without being possessed?"

[It's possible. Apostles are ultimately blessed by God, so they will eventually receive a level-up.]

Note: The text appears to be a Korean fantasy novel or game, and some terms may be specific to the context.
Here is the translation of the text:

So, that skill was quite useful. The maintenance time of Sado-hwa was extremely short, and it was necessary to defeat the opponent within a limited time.

That was thanks to the blessing of the goddess. In the future, I will be able to use it effectively since I will encounter high-level enemies frequently.

And, the proficiency of some skills has increased, and the content of the skills has changed.

I found it difficult to find skills that change as my proficiency increases, but after one battle, the content of multiple skills changed.

Firstly, my proficiency in the Ailak Mu-jik skill has finally increased.

[Ultimate skill: Ailak Mu-jik] [Proficiency: 20%] [It is a skill that deals with both weapons and physical strength. With my skills honed, I no longer lose power when transmitting it.]

"It means that the limitation on damage has disappeared, doesn't it?"

[I think so, but I'm going crazy, I swear.]

It means that even without a weapon, I can attack with 100% damage. The mountain laughed with a smile.

I expected that with just a 20% increase in proficiency, I would see such a change. As my proficiency increases, the increase in skill becomes more pronounced.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taisan aimed to reach 40% before reaching the depths first. Sensory enhancement has also changed.

[Special permanent skill: Sensory Enhancement] [Proficiency: 80%] [With sensory enhancement, one can perceive things that are not visible more accurately. One can sense things within a certain range centered around oneself.]

According to the changed explanation, Taisan could feel that everything within a 2-meter range centered around himself was within reach.

"It's faster than I thought."

The sensory enhancement had only reached 60% and suddenly jumped to 80%. It seemed to have risen quickly because most of the battles this time relied on sensory abilities.

And the proficiency of the Ability Sword also increased.

[Advanced Swordsmanship: Ability Sword] [Proficiency: 22%] [A unique swordsmanship created by the adventurers of the labyrinth. It is based on the system of the labyrinth. It was created based on the swordsmanship used by the prince of the destroyed world. One can use skills perfectly linked to swordsmanship.]

The content is the same as before, but Taisan was able to sense the change.
Here is the translation of the text:

The skills that met the conditions of the Ability Sword until now were acceleration, strong strike, jump, push, counterattack, and consecutive attack. In fact, these skills were accompanied by the condition of Ability Sword in the skill description.

Now, the number of skills with conditions has increased.

I'll just confirm the detailed effects, but I think the skills I've used so far will be sufficient.

And another skill.

"I don't know what this is."

The monster had activated the "Yiniegeuk" skill.

Tae-san had killed the monster and obtained the "Yiniegeuk" skill.

And the "Yiniegeuk" skill had transformed into a completely different skill due to the "Yinggeuk" rise.
