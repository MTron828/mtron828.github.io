Chapter 205

205. The 51st floor, where mysterious things come to life (2)

Light pours down. The mountain god takes a step back, startled.

The sound of laughter grows louder and louder.

[It's fun!] [It's even more fun!] [I won't get bored and send it back, so it's okay.] [There's no need to die from being unable to bear it.] [Let's play with it.]

"That's a bunch of scary guys."

The mountain god muttered to himself and continued to move his body. The lights were about to pass by the mountain god.

"It's not like I can feel it."

These kinds of beings were able to use such power. You should be able to feel the remnants of that power or the aura, but you couldn't feel anything at all, so you couldn't figure out where you were.

The mountain god made a decision. Although it would consume some power, he would make sure to understand his enemies.

[You have activated the Black Wave of Marbas.]

A dark wave bursts forth, foaming.

The wave that suddenly arose swept up all the trees and shrubs around it and charged forward. The colorful forest was gradually covered in a thick layer of darkness.

Ku-kun-kun-kun-gung!
Here is the translation of the text:

In an instant, the vast space was cleared of trees and shrubs, and the view became unobstructed.

Tae-san quickly stamped his foot and took to the sky, looking around.

As he did, he could see very small, human-like beings.

They had a pair of tiny wings and were extremely beautiful, but no bigger than Tae-san's palm.

"What are those?"

And they were much farther away than Tae-san had expected. Tae-san could even run to catch them, they were that far away.

The fairies moved further and further away from Tae-san.

"[They're terrifying humans.] [Be careful.] [Let's play with them carefully.]"

Tae-san landed on the ground. The trees and shrubs that had been trampled by the waves began to grow back, slowly but surely.

"Fairy. It's strange that we're getting along."

[He's not a child's friend, but rather.]

As they were talking, the surrounding area was once again filled with dense trees.

"This is difficult."

Tae-san used all his strength to create a dark wave, but it ultimately returned to its original state. He was only able to grasp the fact that his opponent was someone who was attacking him, but he couldn't get any more information.

It was definitely a 51st-floor level difficulty.

"What should I do now?"

Note: Tae-san is likely a Korean name, and "페어리" (fairy) is likely being used to refer to a type of mythical being. The story appears to be a fantasy adventure narrative.
Here is the translation of the text:

I had received information from Taeyeon, but she didn't have any concrete information either.

Tae-san began to organize the information one by one.

"'The Fairies are attacking me.'"

And it was quite far away.

Even rough calculations showed that it was over a kilometer away, and it was shining like light. Now, I finally understood the reason why I felt nothing. It was because those tiny existences far away were using their powers, and it was impossible to grasp the situation properly.

Keyi.

Tae-san dodged the incoming light and looked around.

The forest, which had been trampled and destroyed by the black waves, had returned to its original state.

After confirming the location and layout of the trees and underbrush, Tae-san realized one thing.

"'The locations and layouts of the trees and underbrush are the same.'"

The forest was perfectly the same as it was before it was destroyed by the black waves.

Tae-san suddenly had an idea and walked forward. Then, the forest began to change.

Tae-san stopped walking.

The trees and underbrush around Tae-san. Their locations were exactly the same as they were before Tae-san moved.

"'It seems like this. I'm lost.'"

"[Did you figure it out? It's faster than I thought.]"

Tae-san concluded.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The forest is moving along with me."

The positions of the trees and shrubs kept moving together. It was natural to lose one's way and wander around. Although the position had changed, the scenery remained the same.

Iteyan didn't know this information. She said that she could suddenly escape after wandering around for a few days.

Tae-san was probably similar. If he spent a few days here, he could also escape.

However, he didn't think he would spend that much time here.

The forest was following him and adjusting itself.

In other words, if the forest didn't follow him, he could escape.

Tae-san put his strength into his feet. He invested his greedy stats and sprinted.

Whizz!

The wind knocked down the shrubs and trees, and the leaves scattered. Tae-san sprinted while the forest began to move.

[I'm escaping!] [I'm escaping!]

The fairies followed behind, shooting lights at him. Tae-san blocked them while running.

He added more strength to his feet.

He accelerated his body. He didn't stop until he reached his limit.

As a result, the scenery that had always remained the same began to change slightly.
Here is the translation of the text:

Following the forest, it was unable to catch up with the speed of Taesan.

Kuooong!

It stepped on the earth. The ground trembled and the surrounding trees shook.

It accelerated straight ahead. The scenery began to change rapidly.

As Taesan gazed at the changing forest, he focused his mind.

He spread his senses in all directions, confirming everything that passed by. As a result, Taesan was able to sense the unusual aura that was far away.

The aura of the forest was mystical and full of mystery. However, the place was extremely quiet and full of realistic aura.

That place was where he had to go.

Taesan changed direction. The laughter and laughter of the following fairy began to fade away slightly.

Kururur.

The branches of the forest trees rose up. The trees moved together to become giant.

The giant tree, which had grown to the level of a small mountain, blocked Taesan's path.

Taesan threw a punch.

Kwaaaang!

A huge hole was drilled into the tree. It collapsed and the branches scattered to the ground.

Taesan turned his back on the tree and advanced forward.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the atmosphere grew gloomy, the colors of the forest began to change gradually. The trees turned from their original bright colors to a dull brown, and the leaves turned green. It was a very realistic forest.

"Here we are."

This was the first destination. The ghost exclaimed in surprise.

["Wow, I came quickly. I thought it would take at least three days, but it's impossible, so it's possible to do this too."]

The 51st floor, a forest following an adventurer.

The solution was only one thing: time. As time passed, the forest behind them twisted and turned, and a new path began to appear.

But they had to wait until then, and the mountain pushed them to move faster, leaving them behind.

It was an impossible feat for a normal 51st floor.

["This is the territory of a nasty guy." ["This place is boring." ["Let's go back."]

The fairies giggled and left. It was as if they had really disappeared, and the light no longer shone.

The mountain gazed at the changed forest for a moment before entering.

["The deeper you go, the more unique and insolvable floors will appear. And the more such floors appear, the more guidance you will have. From now on, you'll see more of these floors."]
Here is the translation of the text:

A ghost said. According to his words, there was a small house made of trees inside the forest.

Tai Shan shook the bell next to the house. The sound of the bell ringing and the sound of someone walking inside the house could be heard.

"Ah, those little spirits! If you catch them, you'll die!"

The door creaked open with a loud noise.

A strange entity appeared, looked up at Tai Shan, and scowled.

"Who are you?"

"I'm an adventurer."

Tai Shan replied.

[You encountered a mysterious and ugly goblin who had obtained a secret.]

*

"I'm sorry. Those little spirits keep breaking the bell, so I thought they were those monsters."

The entity who brought Tai Shan to the house searched through a drawer. It took out a few tea leaves, threw them into the boiling water, and then handed them to Tai Shan.

"It looks good, and it's good for the body. Try it."

Tai Shan hesitated, looking at the tea leaves offered by the entity, and then took a sip.

[You drank the tea made from Mandrake leaves. Your physical strength, mana, and mental state all recovered, and your mental state became optimal.]

"How is it?"

"...It's not bad, but..."

Note: The text appears to be a fantasy story, and some terms like "요정 새끼들" (little spirits) and "모험가" (adventurer) may have specific meanings in the context of the story.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was impossible to say such empty words. The face of the one who had given me the car looked gloomy.

"Ah, so it's like that. The previous one also said the same thing. When will I get this kind of talent?"

"However, the effect is not believable. What is this?"

It recovers all physical and spiritual energy, and also enhances physical abilities and mental strength.

The effect was almost the same as leveling up. This is not even a quest reward, just give it to me to drink.

"You adventurers can't get it, but there are plenty of such things here. It's not a big deal."

The existence sat down on a chair made of leaves.

"I'll take a few with me when the matter is settled."

A non-hostile NPC existing on the 51st floor.

The reason for its existence was one. The existence opened its mouth.

"You are an adventurer. I am a bound existence with a desire. What I want to propose to you, I already know, don't I?"

The Taesan nodded its head. The existence smiled wryly.

"Okay. The previous one was also fine, but I couldn't get what I wanted. The ghost behind you is the same. How about you?"

The existence leaned back on the chair and asked.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Tell me honestly. What am I like?"

Tae-san gazed at the face of existence.

He was astonished. His height was only half of Tae-san's, and his proportions were distorted, making him look grotesque.

His face was deformed, resembling both reptiles and humans. The two forms were mixed, making him look very strange.

His ears were wide like a lizard's, and his eyes were unnaturally large. His arms and legs had long, ugly fingernails and toenails.

"Honestly?"

"Honestly."

"I'm ugly."

Tae-san replied. Existence seemed to nod in agreement, as if it had expected this.

"I'm ugly, like a goblin. It's just a characteristic of our kind. But all the other existences here are beautiful and lovely."

Any fairy could see that. The small existence was very cruel, but no less beautiful than the existences that appeared in fairy tales.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Unicorn, sea snake. Laplace... they all have a mesmerizing appearance. Yeah. So, they all appear in fairy tales and become the object of human admiration. But what about me?"

His face twisted in anger.

"I also have a mysterious existence on the 51st floor, but I'm the only one like this. I'm the only one who's weirdly shaped. The fairies always scold me, saying I'm ugly, and the sea snake sends me condescending glances. I'm so annoyed."

Snap.

The leaves of the judge's tree branch broke off in his hand.

"Do you know why I want to be like this? Why I was born like this? Can't I even make my own territory and live in peace? The fairy kids come and pick a fight, saying I'm ugly and disgusting just because I'm not beautiful!"

He couldn't contain his anger and jumped up with a loud bang.

"I'm a being with the same mysterious power as them! I should be feared and admired by humans!"

With a twisted face and jealousy, the gremory collapsed to the ground.

"...They're bullying me because I'm ugly."

He let out a cackle. His fangs appeared outside his mouth.
Here is the translation of the text:

"So, if I become beautiful and they become ugly, I'll be able to torment them, won't I? Yeah, that's how it'll be."

As Gremory muttered to himself, a quest appeared.

[Sub-Quest Start] [Gremory is a mysterious being. He has taken up residence on the 51st floor, but the inhabitants of this place despise him due to his appearance. As a result, the angry Gremory wants to become beautiful himself.] [Condition: Accept Gremory's request.] [Reward: A way to clear the 51st floor, and treasures from the mysterious forest that will satisfy him to some extent.]
