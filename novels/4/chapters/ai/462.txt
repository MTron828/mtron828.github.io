**Chapter 463**

**463. Those Who Want to Become Gods (2)**

The first thing Taesan felt as he stepped into the new world was a powerful wave of energy.

Kuuuuuuung......

The world trembled due to the clash of powers. Two enormous beings were engaged in a fierce battle.

"What a mess."

The clash of powers continued to occur on the other side of the planet.

When one becomes immortal, it's possible to destroy the world alone.

Taesan had expected that the two beings would not be in a normal state, but this was beyond his expectations.

The aftermath of the battle caused the earth to shake and the sky to distort. It seemed difficult for ordinary life to survive with the powerful wave of energy covering the world.

Taesan first restrained his own power.

He suppressed his aura and prevented his power from leaking out of his body.

He wanted to observe the situation in the world first.

Taesan gazed beyond the horizon.

Everything in the world came into his view.

"It's similar in size to the Earth."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But the number of lives was extremely small. It was a number that barely exceeded 100 million.

Perhaps the immortal was involved in this.

And on the other side of the continent, the presence of numerous mortals was felt.

They were divided into three groups.

Two groups facing each other, and one group standing far away.

[You activated the teleport.]

Space opened up, and your body leaped.

Taesan arrived on the other side of the continent.

In his sight, people were killing each other.

"Waaaah!"

"Die!"

"For the great Paragup-nim!"

"For Keboruak-nim! Kill those heretics and offer their blood to Keboruak-nim!"

Those wearing blue armor and red armor were shouting the names of their masters while wielding their weapons. Their eyes were filled with madness and faith.

[Looks like they're worshiping the immortal.]

Hundreds of people were trampling over corpses and killing each other.

They were shouting as they killed or were killed.

"Everything is for Paragup-nim!"
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$This passage shows a scene where the character's faith in the Immortal is revealed through a powerful shout. The light of this belief seems strange.

"Brainwashed?"

The battle is at its climax. Taesan quietly watched with his arms crossed.

"Look over here!"

Someone called out to Taesan from the forest behind him.

"Brother! It's dangerous there! Come over here quickly!"

The one who called him was a young boy who seemed to have just turned fifteen.

The boy was frantically signaling to Taesan. After looking at the boy for a while, Taesan approached him. The boy quickly pulled Taesan over.

"Are you trying to get yourself killed? Why are you watching the fight like an idiot?"

"It looked fun."

"That's nonsense. They're trying to force us to go with them."

The boy scowled and looked Taesan up and down.

"I've never seen that outfit before... Are you from a different region?"

"I came from a very faraway place."

Taesan answered. The boy whispered, lowering his posture.

"Anyway, come over here. We need to run away quickly while those crazy guys are fighting."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The boy emerged from the forest and approached. How far had he gone, the anxious faces of the waiting group of people lit up when they saw the boy.

"Jelatin!"

"Where did you go? We were worried about you!"

"I'm sorry. I saw this guy watching the battle from afar, and I got worried, so I brought him."

"......Huh?"

"I've never seen that face before......"

For a moment, the face of a woman who was examining the surroundings turned pale.

"Could he be one of their underlings......"

"No, his attire is different, right? They wouldn't take off something they value more than their own lives."

"Ah......"

The woman's face regained its composure. A man who seemed to be the leader of the group picked up his luggage.

"Then, since everyone is gathered, let's move out. We need to get as far away as possible while the fanatics are killing each other."

"Yes."

The people stood up with determined faces. Taesan quietly joined the group.

'The two immortals who want to become gods.'

Taesan quickly grasped the situation in the world.

'The two groups that worship those immortals.'

The ones wearing blue armor and the ones wearing red armor.

They were fighting, shouting names that seemed to belong to the immortals.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And the group that's trying to get away from them."

They despised those who fought and called them crazy, and they were disgusted. It didn't seem like they worshipped the Immortal.

"Damn it......"

"How long do we have to keep running away?"

Instead, they hated and resented them. All sorts of sighs and lamentations flowed out.

"Hyung."

A curious-looking boy named Jeratin approached Taesan.

"But hyung."

"Why."

"Where did you come from, hyung? I saw you watching the fanatics earlier, and you didn't even run away. Are you trying to join them?"

"No, I don't think that way."

People's gazes turned to Taesan, filled with questions and caution.

Taesan hesitated for a moment, then opened his mouth.

"I lived in a small village in the forest."

"What, a village?"

At those words, people's faces turned pale.

"Where is it? Is there still a village that hasn't been taken over by the fanatics?"

"No. The reason I left the village is because guys wearing armor like that came looking for me. It seemed strange, so I ran away."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

“Ah…….”

Disappointment quickly spread across people's faces.

From their reactions, Taesan realized one fact.

‘There is no such thing as a peaceful village or city.’

Those who didn't believe in the immortals were all wandering without a place to settle. Organizing the information he had obtained, Taesan continued the story.

“What kind of people are they?”

“They seem to have been in a really remote place. They were still there until recently, so I guess they didn't know.”

“So, it's hard to understand the situation. Can you explain it to me?”

“Hmm... where should I start explaining?”

“Then I'll explain it to you.”

The man who appeared to be the leader of the group approached Taesan.

“There was still a village that hadn't fallen into the hands of the fanatics. It's unfortunate.”

“What on earth happened?”

The man smiled bitterly.

“If you don't know about the fanatics, I'll have to explain from the beginning, starting with history.”

The man began his explanation.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'm not sure about the story I heard, but it's not like our world was always like this."

"What do you mean?"

*Kuung*......

The collision of powers spreads.

It's the wave of power emitted by the immortals. Mortals couldn't adapt to it, nor could they withstand it. People were terrified, stumbling and gasping for breath.

The man gritted his teeth and forced out the words.

"It wasn't like this... the collision sound didn't ring out all day. The earth was fertile, the sky was extremely peaceful, and people lived in their own territories, growing old and dying there."

"Is there really such a world? I don't believe it."

"I'm just passing on the story I heard, so I'm not sure."

The man replied to Jeratin's question, looking at the mountain again.

"From a certain moment, a loud rumble sounded, and the world began to shake. When people were in a state of panic, two beings appeared in this world."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I am the one who tramples the earth. Paragup. You will worship and serve me. If not, you will lose your life and your soul will suffer."

"I am the lord of the sky. Keboruak. You will worship and serve me. If not, I will make you suffer eternally."

The two, who had been claiming that each other should be believed, soon began to fight each other.

They forced their own beliefs on others and punished those who did not believe.

"The royal family has even become their slaves. Now, all the villages and cities in this world belong to them. They are their puppets."

The man clenched his fist.

His face was filled with anger and resentment.

"Those who do not believe in them are like us, unable to stay in one place and hiding in fear."

"Listening to the story, they seem like incredibly powerful beings, but is it possible to hide their bodies?"

"From a certain point on, they focused on fighting each other. Thanks to that, we were able to maintain our existence until now."

The man smiled bitterly. Taesan, who had quietly organized his thoughts, asked the man.

"But why do you have to run away like this? If the city is taken over by them, it means the city's functions will be maintained. If you acknowledge them as gods and stay in the city..."

"No way!"
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$“Jeratin shouted out in anger. His face was terribly distorted.

‘What the hell! They are not gods! They kill people like they’re toys, just because they claim not to believe in them! To worship such beings! I would rather die than worship them!’

He vented his intense emotions, filled with hatred and anger.

A man whispered quietly.

“Jeratin lost his parents because of them.”

“I see.”

“Some of the people here also hate them like Jeratin does. They would rather die than believe in them.”

“So, some of them must have different reasons, I suppose.”

“But this is the most important part.”

The man spoke with a vague expression.

“There were quite a few who couldn’t endure the hardships and eventually ended up worshipping them. They would pretend to believe and come to help. But most of them never returned. Even if they did, they became just like the fanatics. They thought they would lose themselves if they pretended to worship them. That’s why we’re wandering around, suffering.’”
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"People who found a place to rest began to fall asleep one by one.

Taesan said he would take their place on night watch and headed towards a deserted area.

[Did you catch him?]

"Roughly."

The two immortals were trying to make themselves gods by using the lives of this world as their foundation.

They forced people to believe in them, and killed those who didn't comply.

However, there was a limit to their coercive methods. Faith must come from the deepest part of one's heart. No matter how loudly they proclaimed their faith, it was based on fear. They couldn't achieve what they wanted.

So they chose the method of brainwashing.

Whether they had special abilities or used the immortals' power to manipulate people's minds, they forcibly obtained people's faith.

The two immortals grew their power in this way.

And those who came to believe in them began to attack others like them, forcing those who didn't believe to follow.

[This is a crude method.]

Akasha spoke quietly."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But it's also a reasonable way. An ordinary immortal can't become a transcendent being without using this kind of trick. It's foolish, but it's not bad."

Taesan looked at Akasha.

Her voice was very calm. The level of an immortal was not impressive to her.

"What do you think, Master?"

"It's a method that doesn't sit well with me."

Kuung......

The ground shook. People who were sleeping woke up with a start, cursed, and then went back to sleep.

"I told you to bring peace, so I'll do it as you said. I'll get what I can get, and take advantage of the situation."
