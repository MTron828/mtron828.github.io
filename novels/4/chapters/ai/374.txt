Chapter 375

375. The 77th Floor, the World on the Brink of Destruction (6)

"Master? This is ridiculous."

Minerva's eyes widened in shock.

She had realized why she felt a sense of distance from Taesan.

It was simple. Taesan had surpassed her abilities by a huge margin.

"Master, surely... you're not going to transcend..."

"No."

Taesan denied it.

"It's not that far yet."

Taesan himself couldn't accurately gauge his own state.

A powerful presence was emanating from him, spreading out in all directions.

"Oh, oh, oh."

The people watching him trembled with fear, their legs shaking. They bowed their heads and praised Taesan's name.

But it wasn't out of their own free will; they were overwhelmed by the presence of a being far superior to themselves, and naturally reacted with reverence.

If this continued, they would all become fanatical devotees who only thought of worshiping him. Taesan suppressed his presence. Only then did the people breathe a sigh of relief.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Just the fact that he couldn't control it had a huge impact on people's minds. Taesan decided to move to a place where there were no people.

In an instant, his body disappeared.

As soon as he imagined a place in his mind, his physical body was there.

[Wow.]

It wasn't a skill. Literally, his body was jumping through space according to Taesan's will. Minerva, who followed late, asked with a stunned face.

"What kind of realm have you reached now?"

"I don't know."

Taesan narrowed his eyes.

A sense of omnipotence was dominating his entire body.

It was as if he could achieve anything he wanted, and his limits had disappeared.

What realm have I reached now?

He was recognizing himself. He was observing his own power and reading his own realm.

Taesan closed his eyes and delved deep into his inner self.

The ghost and Minerva quietly watched him. Taesan's observation didn't end quickly. It wasn't until a day had passed that Taesan opened his eyes.

"I understand."

Taesan let out a dry laugh.

"A limited transcendence achieved by gathering people's faith in one place."

That was his current state.

"Ah."

Minerva let out a sigh of amazement."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Minerva. You said it before."

There are cases where one can reach transcendence with only the divine power obtained through worship. However, it's practically impossible to receive the worship of the entire world itself.

It was something Minerva had said a long time ago. I thought it had nothing to do with me and had forgotten about it, but it's come to this. Minerva let out a sigh.

"All the survivors in this world are just five cities. If all of them were to worship their lord... isn't it impossible?"

Originally, it was indeed impossible. People are all different, each with their own thoughts. It's impossible for all of them to worship a single being without any doubts.

But here, only a small number of people have survived, and they're all exhausted and on the brink of collapse.

In such a situation, Taesan saved them with overwhelming power without asking for anything in return, so they're worshiping Taesan.

"And there's no god here. The planet's will is also nonexistent."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This place was currently abandoned. The planet's god was killed by the high gods, and the high gods who defeated them also disappeared.

Multiple conditions had come together, and the worship of the world itself was fulfilled.

So, it seemed like Taesan had temporarily surpassed mortality.

"What's going on? Did he really reach the transcendent realm?"]

The ghost asked in surprise. Taesan shook his head.

"It's not that level."

Taesan looked at his own hand. Omnipotence filled his entire body, but there was a clear limit.

"The number of surviving people is too small."

There were only five cities left. And they were not modern cities filled with people, but rather medieval-level cities.

Taesan estimated that even if he did everything, he couldn't exceed 100,000.

Even if everyone worshipped only Taesan, it was a far cry from the number required for transcendence.

So, it was extremely unstable. The power that relied on people's faith was limited and could disappear at any moment if their beliefs wavered.

"If I had to rank it, I'd say I'm closer to being an immortal than a transcendent being."

But even so, it was undeniable that he had reached an unprecedented level.

As Taesan observed the power of his entire body, he discovered another fact.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's a power limited to this world."

The native god of Veseta. It was similar to Hamon. Veseta was Hamon's domain. Although it was just a ghost's misconception, it wielded an immense power that couldn't be trifled with within its own domain.

Taesan would lose the realm he had reached the moment he left this world.

"Still, the faith of the world itself remains unchanged... I think it's possible, at least partially. I don't feel it, though."

Minerva let out a sigh.

Whatever the case, Taesan had currently reached a realm he had never attained before.

Then, what he had to do was already decided.

* * *

Taesan held the crystallized divine blood in his hand.

[Crystallized Divine Blood] [It stabilized the divine blood itself by crystallizing it. If an unqualified person tries to control it, it will go berserk.]

Maria had said that reaching the level of handling this was one of her joys.

Taesan focused his energy on the crystallization.

Tremendous.

The crystallization began to sway according to Taesan's will. The power contained within it flowed out and spread towards the world.

But it was possible to control it.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The moment when Taesan's eyes shone brightly, gathering more power.

Tzok.

The moment of decision was broken. The power of the decision began to surge out of control.

Tzok-tzok-tzok!

Space was distorted, and the surroundings were destroyed. Taesan hastily gathered his strength and will, declaring:

"Seal it!"

[You have activated the seal declaration.]

Ki-ki-ki-kik!

The surging decision was suppressed by an enormous power. The broken parts were sealed.

The newly formed divine blood barely regained its stability.

Taesan clicked his tongue.

"It's impossible at this level."

It wasn't that the power was insufficient, but rather a problem of stability. Currently, Taesan was in a special situation where he had transcended his mortal limits, but his power was unstable, making it difficult for him to control.

In this state, it was impossible to adjust the divine blood.

Although it was an unexpected event, he didn't feel disappointed. In other words, it meant that the power contained within the divine blood was that remarkable. There was no need to be impatient, as he would eventually obtain that power.

"I won't be able to touch the ring like this."

Using the skills obtained from the battle with the guides, he merged the twin rings into one.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But I decided to give up. If I made a mistake in this unstable state, the ring could be damaged.

Taesan took out the flower ornament that Maria had handed over.

It was possible to read this much. Taesan's gaze, filled with curiosity, turned to the ornament.

Taesan, who had read the power within, twitched his eyebrows.

Taesan had thought that the flower ornament was an item that could be used as a material for equipment. So, he thought that he could use it after he became strong enough.

But the ability of the flower ornament he had just read was completely different.

The flower ornament was not for himself, but for someone else.

This ornament was an item that would take effect when given to someone.

But he couldn't figure out who the target was.

Taesan tried to understand again, but he couldn't get any more information.

"What is this?"

Taesan put the flower ornament away.

Taesan focused his mind.

It was time to do what he could do now.

He was like a god on this planet now.

Then, it would be possible to use this kind of power too.

Taesan focused his mind, gathered his will, and declared:

"Gather around.""
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the declaration of the assembly.]

The world follows the command of Taesan.

The powers that were scattered throughout the world began to swirl and gather. Minerva retreated with a pale face.

"Wow. It's almost like a transcendent being."

For her, it was an impossible, transcendent power that only those who had reached the pinnacle could wield.

Kiiiiing!

Along with the reverberation of space, the powers from all over the world gathered together.

In front of Taesan, a colorless sphere floated up.

[You have obtained the essence of the world.]

Taesan grasped the sphere. As the master of this world, it was possible to grasp the essence of the world itself. Although he hadn't thought about how to use it yet, its value would be immense.

"Then."

He had finished everything he could do for now.

It was time to do the last thing he had to do.

* * *

Taesan, who had suppressed his presence to the limit, called out to the people. Looking at them, who were bowing their heads, Taesan said:

"I will be leaving soon."

Instantly, despair crossed their faces.

"No!"

"Don't leave us behind!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Don't let me go!"

They shout, releasing their pent-up emotions, which gather like a mountain and overwhelm him.

"Hmm."

The mountain lets out a small sigh.

For a moment, his determination wavers.

"Is this it?"

A realm created solely by people's faith. Therefore, if faith wavers, the mountain's determination also wavers.

The mountain suppresses its surging power and opens its mouth.

"There's no choice. I have something I must do."

"Wooo..."

People cry, but they no longer try to hold back the mountain. The mountain continues to speak.

"But don't worry. Even if I'm not by your side, I will always be protecting you."

It raises its power.

The suppressed presence expands to encompass the entire world. The mountain summons its divinity. A golden pillar pierces the sky, and people gaze at it with dazed eyes.

An almighty power that can control the world according to its will envelops the mountain.

The mountain controls its power and uses a skill.

[You have activated the internal world.]

"A skill that expands one's power and domain into a realm. Inner World.

Although it's a skill that's quite useful in theory, it's a skill that I haven't used even once since acquiring it. The reason is that the size of the realm that can be created is too small compared to the power and domain consumed.

But it's different now.

The realm of the inner world that has unfolded encompasses five cities and still has room to spare.

Taesan has finally unleashed his divinity.

I know the method. The sacred site of the regretful god I saw in the world of ghosts. With my current abilities, it's possible.

The expanded pillar of light spreads out into the world. People shout and offer prayers in response to the intense light waves.

Taesan has led people's faith to the pillar of light.

Kyaaa!

The realm of the inner world is filled with divinity, and Taesan's sacred site has been realized in this world.

[You have created your own sacred site. You have obtained the special divine skill [Sacred Site Creation].]

"Whew."

Taesan took a deep breath. Although it was a very short time, the mental exhaustion was considerable.

Taesan turned his gaze away."

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The sphere of light enveloped the people. And as people's faith flowed towards the light, it maintained the light even more firmly.

"It's done."

"Ooh ooh."

"This is……."

People cheered and looked around them.

The pillar of light gently enveloped them.

The withered earth began to regain its vitality. The colorless world regained its colors.

The roots that had died deep in the earth came back to life. New sprouts grew, creating a green landscape.

The divine light shone upon them like the sun.

It was truly a miracle of God.

People were overwhelmed with emotion and cried out towards the mountain. In an instant, an explosive faith that was hard to bear settled upon the mountain.

"As long as you don't forget me, the light that protects you will not disappear either."

With those words, the mountain's figure disappeared.

But the remaining people continued to pray towards the mountain.

"Ah."

The mountain returned to the labyrinth. At the same time, the system window appeared.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have acquired the transcendental skill [Eternal Unwavering Faith].] [77th floor cleared.] [You have obtained the brutal Bloody Hammer.] [Your achievements will change the secret reward.] [Verifying…….] [Complete.] [The administrator of the labyrinth, Balbambara, appears.]

Kukukuku!

The floor of the labyrinth collapses, and Balbambara begins to reveal its appearance.
