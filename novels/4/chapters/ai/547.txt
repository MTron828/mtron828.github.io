**Chapter 548**

**548. The Treasure Box of the Usurper (6)**

It's too late now. Taesan can't feel anything.

Kwagagagak!

Monsters rush towards Taesan, trying to crush him with their power.

Kagagak!

Taesan doesn't block or counterattack.

He just stands still.

And that's enough.

Everything that touches Taesan is destroyed and killed by the boundary negation. A monster charges towards Taesan like a body slam, but it's erased instantly.

Kuuuuung!

A dark bomb explodes right in front of Taesan. The boundary negation absorbs it as if it was waiting, and instead uses its own power to amplify it.

"I've gained this ability too."

Self-immutability was a consuming authority. The only way to recover it was to slowly replenish it over time.

However, the boundary negation absorbs the opponent's power and makes itself even stronger.

"It's okay."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The small, murmuring Taesan gathered its boundaries. The remaining fragments swirled around, and with just that, dozens of monsters were torn apart.

Oooooh.

The gathered boundaries slowly lost their color. And eventually, they took on a formless shape. The value of everything that touched it began to disappear.

The monsters that were rushing stopped in their tracks.

[That's...][Your Excellency's.]

The words couldn't continue.

Taesan wielded its powerlessness. The formless wave, invisible and powerless, swept across the front.

The monsters fled in disarray, but the powerlessness calmly pursued and devoured them.

Without a sound, without a rumor, hundreds of monsters vanished simultaneously.

One monster, barely escaping the aftermath, shouted in indignation.

[How! How could such a being wield Your Excellency's power!]

"That's because I stole it. The powerlessness is just that."

He was currently conducting an experiment. Taesan gathered its boundaries and activated its power. The power of the monsters that walked through time. Time interference was activated.

Kiiiiing!

The effect of time interference was to intervene in the world's time.

But the phenomenon that appeared was entirely different.

The axis shook.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It couldn't be expressed in any other way.

The axis of the realm itself was shaking, and it was cut off.

[Kaaaa!]

The monsters that were rushing in were suddenly cut off at a certain point and twisted.

"Hoo."

The power of the monster that walked through time was being implemented as a cut-off here.

It completely cut off a certain realm, cutting off everything that came into it. The space itself was like a blade on the verge of being sharpened.

"Is it because there's no concept of time? This is amazing."

This place was not the universe.

There were no concepts of time, space, gravity, fire, and wind that existed in the universe. So, the power of time interference was being implemented in a completely different way.

"No. Is this the original power of the monster that walks through time?"

This cut-off couldn't be properly implemented in the universe, so it was transformed into the concept of time interference. It seemed like that was the correct way of thinking.

"Hmm."

It's usable.

It completely cut off the realm up to a certain distance, cutting off everything that reached it.

It was like creating a massive wall.

"It seems like it'll be usable."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Honestly, time interference was the most uncertain of his abilities. Even if he intervened in time and applied pressure, if his opponent was at a transcendent level, they could respond easily. Since using multiple abilities simultaneously was impossible, time interference had to compete with abilities like nullification and compression, but it didn't have enough value.

However, if this ability was being implemented now, the story would be different. It had enough value as both an attacking and defensive ability.

The problem was whether this ability could be used in the universe as well.

The monster that walked through time would also be impossible to deal with using time interference.

But if it was Taesan, it might be possible.

That's a story for later. For now, I need to take care of what needs to be done.

"Keep coming."

The monsters didn't stop. Even as they were being destroyed, they kept charging towards Taesan.

Taesan welcomed them with a smile.

Crush, crush. The monsters that could have polluted the universe were torn apart with a light touch.

Some of them were even apostles, but it didn't make a difference.

To him, S-grade monsters, apostles, and others were all the same.

So, about half of the monsters were destroyed. At first, the monsters that had charged enthusiastically began to falter one by one.

The reason they didn't stop even when faced with overwhelming power was that Taesan was a being from the other side."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The divine power is unchanging and its strength is invisible. However, the existence on the other side weakens as it is used, and time is needed to recover. 

Even the weak ones believed they could catch it if they exhausted themselves enough.

Moreover, this is their territory.

The existence on the other side had to consume a lot of power just by existing. They believed so.

But it wasn't so.

Taesan didn't consume anything.

On the contrary, the boundary that surrounded him was devouring the monsters and growing even larger.

The monsters began to take their distance, one by one.

"Is it time?"

Taesan had unified his spirit, body, and soul while facing Rakiratas, and was able to do many things he couldn't do before. He had successfully experimented with most of them.

Now, only the final experiment remained.

Taesan poured power into the hand holding Bardley.

[You activated addition.] [You activated multiplication.]

Physical power is gathering. A mighty authority is about to reveal itself to the world.

But slowly, the power begins to dwindle.

This is not the universe."

Note: There may be some nuances or cultural references that don't translate perfectly, but I've done my best to provide an accurate translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This is the realm of the divine. Since the concept of physical strength does not exist, it is impossible to properly wield the power of physical strength.

That's why.

The condensed physical strength is bounded.

Two different powers merge to create something new.

[Ah.]

The monsters that were slowly increasing their distance suddenly stopped.

An unusual and twisted power was gathering in the sword of Taesan.

It was beyond their understanding. They couldn't accept it.

No, it wasn't just them. Even those who had reached the pinnacle of power couldn't accept it.

But one thing was certain.

That was not a concept they could accept.

It was something that transcended even the great ones.

"Go."

Taesan swung his sword.

The grayish physical strength enveloped the monsters. The realm of the divine itself was shaken.

* * *

"Good."

Taesan smiled in satisfaction.

When he originally activated the multiplication, the physical strength left an indelible scar on the world.

This time, a scar was left again.

But there was something different.

The scar remained throughout the entire range of the physical strength that had spread."

Note: The translation tries to maintain the original tone and style of the text, but some nuances may be lost in translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The overwhelming power that covered the entire planet left an indelible mark that couldn't be erased.

He could now wield his power freely, transcending even the boundaries of multiplication.

If he handled it properly, he could even surpass the full power of Rakiratas. It was a satisfying result.

"It's been settled."

Taesan looked up.

In the vast, sprawling scar that remained, there was nothing left.

He had erased all the monsters that had been waiting for an opportunity to invade the universe, lingering on over 10 planets.

But that wasn't all.

A considerable amount of the black energy the monsters possessed had been absorbed by Taesan.

"Is it because of the spiritual usurpation?"

When spiritual power increased, if there was a certain level of difference in power, one couldn't steal the opponent's power even if they defeated them. However, it seemed that with spiritual usurpation, one could steal power to some extent even with a difference in power.

"Good."

The amount of black energy he had obtained was significant even for Taesan's current state. Taesan was satisfied.

He had taken care of the entire elite team gathered for war.

But the high-ranking officials didn't show any unusual movements.

"They're really not taking me seriously."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"At least I thought the fragments would be a bit of a challenge, but it seemed like the transcenders were handling them well. Thanks to that, I was able to take care of the guys at the front lines without any issues.

Anyway, the high-ranking gods are immutable and don't consume power, but it's impossible to bring out this amount of material at once.

What's more, these guys aren't mindless monsters, but rather fragments of high-ranking gods with complete intellect.

Taesan made sure to erase them all so they wouldn't be recovered by the high-ranking gods.

This much should be a significant blow to the high-ranking gods as well.

'I'm satisfied.'

I didn't think I'd get this far, but I didn't want to miss the opportunity either.

Now it's time to get back to the main issue.

Taesan took a step forward. His ash-colored body quickly traversed the dark space.

I know the location.

There's no monster blocking the way.

To be exact, there couldn't be one. The strong existence that was waiting for war was completely annihilated by Taesan. The high-ranking gods can't move either, so Taesan moved freely to where he wanted to go.

And Taesan arrived.

In an empty, dark space filled only with darkness.

Taesan stopped moving.

[Is this the place?]

'Yes.'

[There's nothing here.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"All that can be seen is blackness. There was nothing. It didn't seem like the treasure chest of the usurper was there.

[……No.]

But Akasha denied it.

Her voice was trembling.

[It's here. In this place. The aura of Arilnan.] [But nothing can be seen.]

Taesan silently felt the air. Bardley and Akasha closed their mouths at his action.

Like searching for an invisible wall, Taesan's hand moved slightly.

And.

Something caught onto Taesan's hand.

It was an invisible door.

Even Taesan, who was currently in a state of heightened awareness, couldn't fully sense it - a tiny door that even a transcendent being or a high-ranking noble couldn't detect.

This door was the entrance to the treasure chest.

But the door was sealed extremely tightly.

The seal that Taesan saw was stronger than any he had seen before. No matter how much he manipulated the boundaries, it was not something that could be easily broken.

Taesan, who had been touching the door, gathered his boundaries in his hand. But it wasn't to break it.

The seal began to turn to ash. The device that was meant to protect the door changed its role due to the ash.

Creak... creak...

The door opened.

And a small passageway, just large enough for one person to enter, appeared."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan went inside.

And what he saw was a vast space that even Taesan couldn't see the end of.

It was a distorted area where he couldn't recognize the shape or grasp its essence.

Taesan had a memory of seeing this place.

It was in his dream.

Just like in his dream, the area was filled with numerous powers and concepts.

Whoa.

Taesan took a step forward. A massive, distorted something came into view in front of him.

Taesan reached out his hand to touch it.

"...... Huge."

It was enormous.

Although it was now distorted and broken to the point where its original form was unrecognizable, it originally had a massive scale that even Taesan couldn't easily comprehend.

Taesan knew what this was.

This was the scale of a Transcender.

A concept that pierced through the entire universe, tainted by the Usurper and discarded like trash in this place.

It wasn't just one.

Many such massive concepts were visible. If he counted the smaller ones, the number would be impossible to grasp.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was like a treasure trove filled with the most precious things in the universe.

This was the treasure box of the plunderer.

Somewhere in here, there was the concept of Arilnan.

The problem was how to find it. The current Taesan couldn't see the end of the realm. It was ridiculously vast.

Unless you spent a lot of time, you couldn't find the essence of the concept, which was tainted and polluted.

And there was another problem.

This place was a kind of treasure trove.

By rule, there was a being that guarded the treasure in the warehouse.

A being appeared in front of Taesan.

Its form was not human.

But it wasn't a monster either.

It couldn't be said to be from this world, nor from beyond. It was something in between.

It looked at Taesan.

Taesan scowled.

"I heard it was in the boundary."

[……A thief has entered.]

A low voice echoed.

[But, it's also a welcome guest.]

The system window declared calmly.

[The plunderer has appeared.]"

Note: "Taesan" and "Arilnan" seem to be proper nouns, possibly names or terms specific to the story or world.
