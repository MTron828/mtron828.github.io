94. Vekweseta, Young Lamb of the Mastin (4)

"This is a skill only inspectors can obtain. It judges whether one surpasses or does not surpass first-class inspectors based on the presence of Ora."

Garant began his explanation.

"As you saw earlier, it's essentially a blue flame. It is said to turn white when it reaches its peak, but I have never seen it myself."

"What are its characteristics?"

"It has cutting power close to absolute."

It cuts steel and crushes rocks. It cannot be stopped by anything natural.

The only options are magical defense and a sword refined by an excellent blacksmith.

"Can it only be used on swords?"

"It can be used on any weapon. However, it's not unrestricted. It can only be used on the form of the weapon one has trained with throughout their lifetime."

Those who have trained with spears can only contain Ora in spears, and those who have trained with swords can only contain Ora in swords.

There seemed to be some constraints.
"However... as your skill level increases, you can use it freely. You can contain Ora in something other than a sword, like a tree branch, or use Ora alone to create a sword, or attack from a distance. It's versatile."

"Is it based on proficiency?"

Another question followed after hearing the explanation.

"What about the consumption of power?"

"There is none."

"None?"

"While there is a limit to how much Ora can be produced, using it for a long time doesn't mean you can't use it anymore. It's just a bit tiring because you have to keep your focus, but there's no consumption like mana."

"Hmm."

There's no significant depletion of mana or stamina.

"It seems useful."

It's not limited to just swords. With increased proficiency, it can be used like a secondary weapon.

Taesan gets to the main point.

"How can one learn it?"

A skill obtained beyond swords. Ora.

Taesan hadn't known until now. It's a skill not even present in the realm of ghosts, so the ghosts wouldn't know either.

It seems listening to the locals would be best. Garant spoke up.

"There's no specific way to learn it. It's the kind of power you naturally come to realize."

"Realization, huh?"
"It's a bit different from that. In my case, about two months ago, while I was training, I entered a state of unconsciousness, and since then, I've been able to use it. Most people who use Ora awaken to it in a similar way, not just me."

Obtaining a skill suddenly, without even knowing it themselves.

Taesan frowned at the words that didn't seem very helpful. Garant's face momentarily paled, then he blurted out hastily,

"Perhaps you don't know. Those who awaken to Ora, the Swordmasters, might know."

"Swordmasters?"

"They're called First-class Swordsmen who have reached the level of swordsmanship where they can learn Ora. Once they start learning Ora, they're called Sword Experts. And beyond the experts, those who can perfectly wield not just the sword but also Ora, are referred to as Swordmasters, having reached a higher realm. They might know how to obtain Ora."

Taesan glanced at Garant with a strange look.

"He's telling me things I didn't even ask about."

What he did was the activation of his own proof. He changed obediently like this with just that one thing.

"Are you done with your questions?"

"For now."

"Then please kill me."

Taesan hesitated. Garant closed his eyes and calmly spoke.
"Please deliver the rest without mocking. O great one."

Instead, Taesan was perplexed by Garant's attitude of wishing for death.

"What's this?"

Though he had no intention of letting him live, seeing Garant give up to this extent left him somewhat puzzled.

"What does he feel?"

"Alright."

Taesan thrust his sword. Relief washed over Garant's face.

"Your Proof of Spirit Activation has been triggered. The disparity in spiritual power between you and your opponent is too vast. You gain nothing from them."

Spirit Activation did not trigger. Given the overwhelming difference, it was natural he could kill him in a single strike.

With a lingering unease, Taesan sheathed his sword.

Garant's face remained serene.

"This feels awkward again."

As Taesan tidied Garant's body and waited for Anetsha to awaken, he reaffirmed his own proof.

[Continuous Special Skill Activation: Proof of Self] [What you have accumulated manifests as a phenomenon around you.]

Taesan activated the skill. The air momentarily calmed. That's how it felt, but he couldn't be sure. The skill was one that the user felt nothing from.

"What's different?"
"I don't really know. I'm already dead. I don't understand momentum even if I don't know strength."

"Hmm."

Taesan knew about his own proof skill. It was because it was a skill that Itaeyeon always activated and used.

However, she stopped at the level of intimidation. Even though the players in the normal mode were scared and followed, she didn't feel like she was seeing something absolute like this.

"Something's different."

The explanation was that what had been accumulated became a phenomenon. Itaeyeon, who cleared up to the 100th floor, would have been stronger if she had been stronger, there was no reason to be weak.

"I'll have to look into it later."

It's not urgent. Taesan turned off the skill.

Time passes.

The sun, which was high in the sky, disappears and darkness comes.

And Anetsha wakes up.

* * *

Anetsha, who opened her eyes, raises her upper body. She staggers and goes outside the cave.

Anetsha looks at the already darkened sky.

Usually, she would have woken up after only an hour of sleep due to tension and fatigue, but she slept for well over ten hours.

"Are you awake?"

"...Hello."

Taesan rummaged through the campfire. Anetsha stared at him blankly.
She is now being watched by others.

It felt like a baby bird had found its nest. Relief washed over her, and her whole body began to relax.

"No."

Anetsha shook her head abruptly.

Taesan protects her, but he is a stranger. She can't relax knowing he could leave at any moment.

Her vacant pupils slowly settled.

It was clear what she was thinking, but Taesan didn't bother to point it out.

It wasn't an incorrect thought either. Once the quest was complete, he would return to the labyrinth.

Taesan got to the point.

"Do you know a safe place?"

"...There's no such place."

Anetsha murmured sadly. Because of Harmon's obsessive efforts to erase evidence of demons, once-landed demon territories were all trampled and burned.

"Everyone is trying to kill me."

"Yeah. That's probably true."

Lead me to a safe place.

It was still hard to understand what that meant.

Taesan stood up.

"Let's get moving for now. There must be somewhere safer than here."
Taesan led her into a mountain valley. Since he didn't know the geography, Anetsha guided him, and he followed her, creating the path.

Hunters aiming for Anetsha appeared steadily, and Taesan dealt with them all.

As time passed, they learned that Anetsha still hadn't let go of her faith in the gods.

Every night, she prayed towards someone.

The recipient was Mashin.

Three days passed. Taesan swung his fist with an annoyed expression. The fleeing hunter fell flat on his face.

"Where on earth is a safe place?"

Enemies pursued them wherever they went. It didn't take long to knock them down, but it was annoying to the point of death.

"I don't even have time to train."

Grumbling, Taesan gripped his sword. He closed his eyes and quietly focused his mind.

Giran said he realized suddenly during training. First, he thought he would start training with the sword according to him.

The current training was the process of refining his sword as the ghost said. It was a method of training to control the body with spirit rather than moving it.

He recalled the action and corrected the error for him
"The proficiency of Stormscar's sword increased by 1%."

He continued his training along with modest supplementary income.

After three hours, Taesan opened his eyes.

"Not quite there yet."

There was no sign of learning from Giran. When Taesan got up again, he felt someone's gaze.

Anetsha, sitting in front of the cave, looked at Taesan with shining eyes.

"...How long have you been watching?"

"Since two hours ago."

"Haven't you slept?"

"I'm starting to feel better."

Anetsha smiled.

For the past three days, except for travel time, Anetsha had slept to relieve accumulated fatigue. Now, her face showed signs of revitalization.

"I didn't have a chance to thank you properly earlier. I'm truly grateful."

Anetsha stood up, clasped her hands as if holding a sword hilt, and bowed her head.

"I speak in the name of Anetsha Brihite, the demon princess. Thank you very much, Taesan."

Impressed by her composed and neat etiquette, Taesan nodded.

"It's a business transaction after all."

"Even so, I must express my gratitude."

She smiled and conveyed her thanks.

"Has your training finished?"
"Okay."

Taesan replied shortly to the probing gaze.

He had always lived alone. He had never had anyone watch him train.

Sure, he was a ghost who died, but that curious look made him feel a little uncomfortable.

"What kind of training are you doing? Oh, if it's a hassle, you don't have to tell me."

"It's not a hassle, I'm just trying to learn some magic."

"Excuse me?"

Anetsha's face showed surprise.

"You're learning magic?"

To her, Taesan was a monster. He had exceptional swordsmanship and presumably had learned magic as well.

Taesan answered her question.

"I'm from somewhere else."

"Somewhere else...?"

She was about to ask where with a curious look on her face.

Taesan drew his sword. Anetsha quickly closed her mouth.

"You've come again?"

He felt a sense of popularity from far away. Taesan complained with an annoyed expression.

"What the heck is it?"
For these three days, they've been relentlessly pursuing us without a day's break. Even though Taesan dealt with all of them and moved quickly, they steadily approached, maintaining their position.

"Perhaps the contract has been issued. Hamon probably wants to erase us."

"He's quite persistent."

Taesan clicks his tongue.

"They're coming in."

"Yes."

Anetsha hides her body inside the cave.

Soon, signs of presence become visible.

"Hmm. Is that where the demon princess is?"

"Yes, Master."

An elderly man in a robe with long beard speaks. Around him are many others dressed in robes.

"Are they wizards?"

Interest shows on Taesan's face.

"It might be more fun than dealing with hunters. There's something to gain."

The old man chuckles as he looks at Taesan.

"Are you the one guarding the princess? How rude."

Taesan killed everyone who came. The first hunter he spared closed his mouth and left for his hometown, so no information was revealed.

But people realized when the hunters didn't return. Someone was protecting the princess, someone strong. He was killing all the hunters.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"The sword seems decent enough, but in the end, just a mere inspector. Kneel before the rain of magic."

Conversely, those who were coming from now on were all the people who could handle hunters.

"I am Varmontor, a magician of the prestigious Maltai Malbrei school of the Great Matap. A lowly inspector. Kneel before me."

The old man raised his staff. The light of magic began to crystallize.

* * *

"Live..."

A sword pierced the chest of a man in robes who was about to scream in fear.

Varmontor shouted in agony.

"Spread out everyone! Use magic all at once!"

There was no longer the initial confidence. There was only a desperate energy to somehow kill Taesan.

Magicians manifest magic with incantations.

Small arrows of fire rise.

Frozen icicles materialize.

Taesan deflects the magics with a grim face. Mysterious flames and cold clash and disappear against his mortal body.

"[You have activated Frost Arrow.]"

Extreme cold is drawn into the air. Nearby trees cannot withstand the cold and wither away. Magicians are astonished.
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"How can he cast Frost Circle without invoking?"

"Is this called Frost Circle? Sounds grandiose."

Taesan launches Frost Arrows. The magicians attempt to block with magical barriers, but they are torn through mercilessly, like trying to block arrows with a thin tent.

"What is this!"

Varmontor couldn't believe reality. Even as a magician of Matap, he couldn't comprehend such chilling magic!

Taesan kicks the ground. Soaring through the air, he slices down those who were chanting on trees.

"Yikes!"

The old man swings his staff. Arrows of magic slice through the air.

Taesan steps into the air.

"[You have activated Aerial Leap.]"

He rushes through the air. Magic arrows pass futilely through the empty space as Taesan deals with another magician.

"Now it's just you?"

Taesan points his sword at Varmontor. Varmontor steps back with a pale face.

"Don't worry, I won't kill you right away."

Taesan steps on the ground. Before Varmontor can cast a spell, Taesan grabs him by the head and drives him into the ground before he can utter the first verse.
Taesan, who has subdued Varmontor, chuckles.

"Try explaining magic to me."
