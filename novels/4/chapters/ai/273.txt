Chapter 274

274. 61st Floor, The Testing Ground (5)

[Conquering and reaching are different issues, right? So, even if you reach it, you won't be able to fulfill your wish?]

"I don't know. I couldn't reach the end of the labyrinth. But... I'm certain of it."

Beldegencia spoke in a calm tone.

"Even if I cleared the labyrinth, I wouldn't have fulfilled my wish. Because I didn't conquer it."

Conquering and overcoming.

Even the ghost began to understand the concept late.

[...So, it's not just about overcoming it, is it?]

"Yeah. Hero. You're amazing. You might be able to clear the labyrinth. But you would have been the same as me."

[Hmm.]

The ghost seemed to be thinking, with a contemplative expression. But there was no disappointment or denial in his voice.

[That's right.]

"Did you expect that?"

[To some extent. I thought that the gods would directly grant the wish, not just give it as a reward for overcoming it.]

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Wishes are not simple things. If God grants them, it's a matter of conditions that can affect the universe itself.

The labyrinth is clearly difficult and requires risking one's life, but the risk of wishing is too light.

However, the warrior descended into the labyrinth because they believed that if they could clear it, they would gain the power to save the world.

[Then, what is the standard for conquest?]

"I don't know either. Is it solving everything in the labyrinth and descending, or meeting certain conditions... One thing is certain, I can't do it now."

[Then...].

The ghost's gaze turned to Taesan.

[What if you...].

Taesan has grasped and solved everything in the labyrinth so far. He has approached the meaning of the word "conquest" the closest.

"Hmm."

It might be possible until now, but since the clear conditions are unknown, he couldn't say anything. As they were talking about wishes, his thoughts naturally turned to Lee Taeyeon.

'She succeeded in breaking through the labyrinth.'

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"She didn't tell anyone that her wish had come true.

In retrospect, it was a strange incident. If she, who was close to being a coward, could have her wish granted, she would have asked to prevent monsters from invading the Earth.

But she returned and left a willstone for Taesan before dying.

Either she failed to achieve her wish, or she achieved it in a way that Taesan didn't know about.

Taesan couldn't understand. Since Lee Taeyeon never mentioned it, he had no idea what was going on.

'Hmm, I wonder...'

Taesan thought quietly to himself.

As he pondered, a day passed. Now it was time for the final trial.

"As a spirit."

"Got it."

[All abilities except for spirit powers were sealed.] [You have summoned the highest-grade spirit, Barcarize, with a colorful aura.] [You have summoned the Wind Spirit King, Minerva.]

"Whoa."

Minerva landed on the ground. Beldechika, who saw her appearance, burst out laughing.

"The Spirit King...this is ridiculous."

A contract with the king? Even Beldechika, who had seen many spirit masters, had never seen anything like this before.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"Beldegkia struck the magic circle. A golem burst out with a loud roar.

[Ugh!]

The golem charged. Taesan gave the order.

"Crush it."

[Summoned and ready for battle. Not bad.]

"Eh, this is annoying."

Unlike Barajas, who was enjoying himself, Minerba grumbled at the sudden battle. The two of them charged towards the golem.

"Kuung!"

As soon as the battle began, the golem was pushed back. As Taesan grew stronger, Minerba also grew stronger. Taesan was just watching the battle, as Minerba was enough to handle it on her own.

"Clearing the 10th level without the owner's assistance, just with the spirit's power, this is something."

Beldegkia smiled in satisfaction. The more Taesan showed off his strength, the happier he became.

And soon, the golem fell.

[You have passed the fourth test.] [You have obtained the Spirit Harmonizing Water.] [Spirit Harmonizing Water] [Increases affinity with the spirit, greatly increasing the spirit's summoning time. The limit of the spirit's power to manifest in the world increases.]

"What's going on? I feel a familiar power...?"

Here is the translation of the text to English:

Minerva shone her eyes and gazed at the water in the bottle.

Taesan scooped up the water.

Whoosh.

Then, Taesan's body began to change. A strange power spread throughout his body.

"O……."

Taesan let out an involuntary sigh of wonder.

The vitality of the scattered weeds on the floor of the labyrinth could be felt. The scent of the wind blowing softly from Minerva could be smelled.

The world felt closer.

Minerva also seemed to sense the change, her eyes widening in surprise.

"What's going on?"

"What do you feel?"

"I feel a strong natural energy from the master, and the power needed to maintain the summoning is decreasing?"

Minerva waved her arm, and the wind gathered, forming a small hurricane that swept through.

"……The consumption of power has decreased by more than half."

"That's good."

Minerva was indeed powerful, but the fact that she had a limited time to be summoned was a major problem. So, despite having a similar power to Taesan, she couldn't achieve much.

Now that that limitation had decreased, it was a useful reward that would be of great help in the future.

However, Minerva was not calmly accepting it like Taesan.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Master, this isn't something that can be easily settled, is it?"

She was the Spirit King. The amount of energy consumed when she was summoned was so great that even hundreds of skilled spirit masters couldn't handle it.

Originally, she couldn't even descend due to the energy consumption, but the Spirit God personally lifted the restriction, allowing her to barely manage to descend.

That restriction had been reduced by half just by drinking a small amount of sacred water.

"This is the 61st floor. It's a relatively deep level even in the labyrinth. And what he's done is an impossible feat."

Bel dentia said matter-of-factly.

"A reward of this magnitude is only natural. And it's not the end here."

Bel dentia raised her staff.

"Originally, I would give you the final reward here. I would give you a fitting reward based on everything you've done so far. This is the end of my role."

Mana began to emanate from the staff. A vast amount of mana started pouring into the room like a gentle wave.

"But... the merciful mage has granted me one extravagance."

Bel dentia smiled faintly.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Beldequia challenged Taesan to a duel. This duel allowed both parties to use everything at their disposal.

Taesan gazed at the system window in response to the sudden duel challenge.

"I trust you. If you can demonstrate the power you've shown so far, I believe you can grant my wish."

It's a risky bet, but there's a possibility. That alone was enough.

"But this is a matter of staking everything on my own terms."

What would happen to Beldequia if Taesan failed?

The merciful god who spared the mortal enemy was scarce, and the god of downfall was not included.

Of course, Beldequia was bound by a contract and might be untouchable, but the princess was not.

"I want to see your true power, unrestricted by any limitations. Use everything you have and fight me."

Rooooar.

The mana wave crashes in.

[Hidden Quest. The fifth trial begins.]

A test that only Beldequia can receive, a challenge that no one else can take on.

"What are you going to do, fighting me?"

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"It's impossible to win. Even the leaders would lose if they fought now, so it's pointless to even mention Beidengxia.

Beidengxia shook her head.

"I'm not saying we can win. I just think it's a suitable level for me to watch."

"Then."

Taesan drew his sword.

There's always something to gain from fighting a strong opponent.

"Come on, adventurer. Prove your strength."

[Beidengxia activated the frozen world.]

A cold air swept in, freezing everything.

Taesan was using mid-level magic, but the cold was unparalleled. The air froze, and the chill spread in all directions.

[You activated the Dark Destruction.] [You activated the King's Vessel.] [You activated the Calamity's Ember.]

Flames that could destroy the world erupted. The flames danced in the frozen world.

"Hmm."

Taesan licked his lips.

But the cold didn't disappear. The walls of the labyrinth were completely frozen.

[Beidengxia activated the Starlight Arrow.] [Beidengxia activated the Magic Separation.]

The starlight arrow was drawn. And the arrow split into tens, hundreds, and shot out simultaneously.

"Tsk."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Taesan snapped his tongue. Taesan, who had judged that he couldn't dodge, charged at Beldechia instead.

The arrow hit Taesan, and the attack nullification was activated.

[Your first attack nullification has been activated.]

"What the...!"

Beldechia, who had been gazing at Taesan with a mixture of surprise and disbelief, let out a cry of astonishment. Not only was his attack erased, but the magic he had cast also disappeared.

However, he was a magician who had mastered the depths of magic.

His hands moved before his mind could catch up.

[Beldechia activated a shaking and echoing wave.]

The invisible wave of mana surged forward, trying to push Taesan back.

Although it was just a simple manifestation of mana, it contained a power that Taesan couldn't withstand.

"Minerva."

"Whoa, this is even hard for me."

Minerva gritted her teeth and gathered all her strength to unleash a powerful gust of wind.

Kuuuuuuung!

It was her full power. She didn't hold back any energy to maintain the summoning, using up all the extended summoning time granted by the fountain.

Even so, she couldn't completely block the shaking wave.

Minerva let out a cry of surprise.

"What kind of power is this?"

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even if the Spirit King himself fought with all his might, there was no chance of winning. The power of a mortal was not believed to be possible.

"Kwuk!"

Even with Barajas' help, the wind was eventually blown away. However, it managed to reduce the waves of mana to some extent.

At this point, it could have been blocked by the Absolute Guard.

Taesan exerted his strength into his feet.

[You activated Acceleration.]

He charges forward. The waves of mana that were rushing in are blocked by the Absolute Guard. Beldequia swings her staff in admiration.

"What on earth do you have?"

[Beldequia activated the Protection of the Blue World.]

A pale blue barrier wraps around Beldequia.

It was an intermediate-level magic. The power contained within was a nearly absolute barrier that even the highest-ranking officials could not easily break through.

"How am I supposed to get through this?"

Beldequia sent a gaze of expectation. She believed that Taesan could break through this level of protection.

And Taesan fulfilled her expectations in a completely different way.

[You activated Absolute Judgment.]

The moment the sword touched, the barrier disappeared.

Beldequia's eyes widened to the point where they couldn't get any bigger. Taesan didn't miss the opportunity and charged forward like a storm."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

You activated the golden sword of Nabarius.

You wield the sword roughly.

Just as the sword strike was about to hit Belldeckia, his body disappeared.

[Belldeckia activated Blink.]

"Whoa."

Belldeckia gasped for breath from a distance.

'Did I almost take the hit?'

Even if I'm a high-ranking officer, I can't even approach him, and yet an adventurer who hasn't even reached the depths managed to land a hit.

"Tsk."

Taesan clicked his tongue and activated black magic.

[You activated Mefisto's Black Lightning.] [Belldeckia activated the Earthquake Pillar.]

The pillar rose. The black lightning struck the pillar and scattered to the ground.

"Black lightning may be unavoidable, but that doesn't mean it can't be countered."

Belldeckia's face was filled with joy as he spoke.

'This is it.'

He may actually achieve his wish. He poured his hopes into his power.

"Let's keep going."

* * *

The battle continued.

After a battle of over an hour, it ended. Naturally, it was Taesan's defeat.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"However, Taesan's face was calm. He had also learned a lot from the many battles he had fought. He had learned how to respond to a powerful magician's attacks.

'Good.'

When he first entered the Alone Mode, Taesan couldn't even block Ainshar's light attacks.

But now, he was having a decent fight with a magician who seemed to be on the same level as Ainshar.

'Ahaha. Good. Very good. Gang Taesan.'

And Beldencia was also satisfied.

Of course, if he had really tried to kill Taesan, he wouldn't have been able to withstand it. If he had poured dozens of intermediate-level magic spells all at once, it would have been over.

But he didn't do that. Despite trying to win by responding to his opponent's attacks, Taesan had endured.

"If you're at your current level, you're a high-ranking official? Even those idiots wouldn't be careless. Yeah. With that kind of power, it's possible."

Beldencia waved her hand.

"I'm fully satisfied."

[Obtained a potion that increases special attack power.] [Obtained a potion that increases special defense power.]

"And this is an additional reward I'm giving you."

Here's the translation of the text from Korean to English:

"I obtained a singing jewel and a resonating steel ring." "I obtained a magician's music box."

Here's a breakdown of the translation:

* "노래하는 보석" means "singing jewel"
* "메아리치는 강철의 반지" means "resonating steel ring"
* "마법사의 오르골" means "magician's music box" (an "orgel" is a type of music box)
