47. 8th Floor, God of Trials. Arrogance (1)

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Uh, um. Mr. Taesan. I received the trial as you said.] [Gang Taesan [Alone]: Oh, really? How was it?] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: The trial itself was fine, but... um. It's a bit confusing. What is this? Was this what they call a god?] [Gang Taesan [Alone]: What are you talking about?] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: ...I couldn't breathe. It was like madness and confusion came simultaneously.]

* * *

Before descending to the next floor, they encounter Rilis. Taesan explains to her how to obtain Frost Arrows.

"It's just like the Ignition Blade... Is it some kind of law?"

She ponders over the theory with her head wrapped, while Taesan takes out equipment from his inventory.

"With these, at least one should suffice, right? This time, it's basic detection."

He learns magic. A new power imbues Taesan.

[Basic Magic: Basic Detection] [Mana Cost: 2] [Proficiency: 1%] [Survey surroundings. Only discerns locations of objects and such.]
It's a perfect substitute for reconnaissance. Nevertheless, since the judgment of magic and skills differs, there may be ways to use it. Rilis tilted her head curiously.

"When will you learn the new magic?"

Taesan had to learn the new magic so that she, too, could learn what she hadn't. But Taesan shook his head.

"First, learn all the magic you already have."

To learn new magic, Rilis needed two things: the price she paid and the permission she received. She didn't think about putting her mind to uncertain things just to learn magic with the smallest cost.

Rilis's expression turned sullen.

"Yeah, I got it."

Their business was done.

Taesan left Rilis. At the end, she waved her hand with a smile.

"See you on the lower floor!"

Taesan headed to the 8th floor. As always, he greeted the dwarf waiting for him and descended.

[Quest Started on the 8th Floor.] [Defeat the boss on the 8th floor and pass through.] [Reward: Marneus's Rune.] [Secret Reward: ???]

At the same time, a quest window popped up.

[Special Quest Started] [Return to Earth.]

---

"It's about time."

"Huh? What's that?"

"This matter."
Taesan checked the quest.

[Special Quest Started] [Return to Earth.] [One week from now. You will return to the land you abandoned. Survive there and come back. Rewards will be determined based on your achievements.] [This quest cannot be refused.]

It was a brief quest window. Yet the sentences contained within were anything but light.

Returning to Earth in a week. Back to where monsters appeared, intent on trampling the world.

Since it had happened several times in the past, he confirmed it without much enthusiasm.

For players, there had been occasional returns to Earth even before clearing, all initiated under the name of a special quest.

It was a quest that evoked various emotions and experiences for the players.

As expected, the community was bustling with noise.

[Kim Taejin [Alone]: What's this? Am I the only one who got it?] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: No. I got it too. ...How are we supposed to accept this?]

Confusion and bewilderment were evident first. And sporadically, glimpses of anticipation began to show.
[Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: Does this mean literally? We're returning to Earth in a week?] 
[Taejin Kim [Alone]: But why so suddenly? Isn't something strange about this?] 
[Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: Are one or two weird things here not enough? At least if they throw us a quest, I don't think they're lying.] 
[Jae-yeon Na [Alone]: ...We can really go back?] 
[Sang Lee [Alone]: Wait, seriously?] 
[Jaesung Moon [Alone]: Wow. Amazing.]

Here, where we have to fight for our lives, we can escape. Everyone is immersed in joy at this fact. Just when people are immersed in happiness, Junhyuk Kang throws cold water on them.

[Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: Uh... Is this actually a good thing?] 
[Taejin Kim [Alone]: What are you talking about! We're going back! Why wouldn't this be good!] 
[Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: But, you know, the reason we came here in the first place was because of the monsters.]

[Taejin Kim [Alone]: ...Ah.]

They are suddenly reminded of the fact they had forgotten.

Before the quest window appeared to them, the sky split open. From there, a massive monster appeared and descended upon them.

Everyone who entered the labyrinth was startled by the monster and fled in a panic.

[Sang Lee [Alone]: Uh...] 
[Jaesung Moon [Alone]: So what. We've gotten stronger since then. It might just be a big guy with a big build.] 
[Jae-yeon Na [Alone]: Right. We'll figure it out somehow.]
Nevertheless, hope prevails over despair. Though no one said anything special, stress had built up considerably in this extreme situation. They were glad just at the prospect of escaping from this place where they struggled for their lives.

Above all, going back to Earth meant there would definitely be material gains.

[이상[얼론] : What can we eat?] [문재성[얼론] : Probably, right? Can we finally stop eating this big rat meat?]

Emergency rations are too expensive for particle-sized frauds to eat anything other than monster meat. To them, who were accustomed to modern food, it are of even told mjscudi But Even did the even meams
[Kang Junhyuk[Alone]: Hey, was this what you were talking about, hyung?] [Kang Taesan[Alone]: Yeah.] [Kang Junhyuk[Alone]: ...How did you know about this?]

Kang Junhyuk asked hesitantly. Taesan replied calmly.

[Kang Taesan[Alone]: You know about the Altar of God, right?] [Kang Junhyuk[Alone]: Oh, did they tell you?] [Kang Taesan[Alone]: Not exactly, but they gave me a rough idea. I inferred from that.] [Kang Junhyuk[Alone]: That's one way to do it. If they're called gods, I guess they'd know that.]

Kang Junhyuk quickly agreed. It wasn't actually true, but he had no choice but to accept it, not knowing much about gods.

[Kang Taesan[Alone]: If possible, break through the 2nd floor and come out. It'd be even better if you could breach the 3rd floor.] [Kang Junhyuk[Alone]: ...Seems like it's quite difficult.] [Kang Taesan[Alone]: It won't be easy.]

Everyone in the community was glad they could leave this place. However, when they first returned to Earth, half of the surviving players had died.

Thinking about it, there wasn't much to be happy about.
[Kang Taesan[Alone]: Don't waste your breath, just focus on breaking through as hard as you can. Motivation is important here.] [Kang Junhyuk[Alone]: Got it. I'll do my best.]

The conversation with Kang Junhyuk ended. Taesan chuckled as he looked at the community.

He couldn't see Choi Junghyuk, who always made a lot of noise.

"He must have a headache."

He was looking forward to the day they could return to Earth.

Taesan had no intention of waiting quietly. He planned to descend as far as possible.

He headed towards the 8th floor.

* * *

"Squawk!"

A monster on the 8th floor. Marconda.

It was a bird-like creature the size of a human, not like the humanoid monsters after Big Rat. Its movements were unpredictable as it flapped its wings and charged, making it a challenging opponent.

Of course, this had nothing to do with Taesan.

He swung his sword down.

"Squawk!"

[You have defeated Marconda.]

Dealing with this was easier than dealing with humanoid creatures. Since it relied purely on instinctive movements without sophisticated techniques like swordsmanship, Taesan found it easier to handle.

"Can you use swordsmanship against beasts too?"

[Um... Since it's a swordsmanship based on humans, mine won't work. That kind of thing is for mercenaries or barbarians.]

It seemed there were some limitations to swordsmanship as well. Unlike skills, its effectiveness varied greatly depending on the opponent.

It wasn't a big problem, so he continued down while organizing his thoughts. He moved without hesitation, aiming to break through quickly.

[Your Inspiration has been activated.]

Even as he thought this, his stats continued to steadily increase. Around halfway through, he came across an altar.

[You have discovered the Altar of Hubris.] [First Discovery Bonus] [Mana +2] [Intelligence +2]

An altar of the gods.

This made it the third altar following Rakyrathas and Valtazaha.

[Altar of Hubris] [An altar created by those who serve hubris. It serves as a conduit to the gods. Hubris can exert influence through this place.]

The ghost speaks.

[Hubris. The god of trials. He enjoys testing adventurers to measure their strength. He's exactly the god you need right now.]

Power could be felt beyond the altar. A transcendent power like before.

But it wasn't particularly strong. He accepted it calmly.
[Subquest Start] [Hubris wants to test you who have come to his altar. If you accept, a trial awaits you. Overcome it, and rewards will follow.] [Reward: Determined by your achievements according to Hubris.]

There's no reason to refuse. Taesan accepted the quest.

[Subquest Start] [Hubris prepares for your choice.]

Clang!

The door closes. The room transforms into an isolated space.

[Hubris's Trial: Prove your strength.]

A black liquid gathers slowly on the floor, forming a shape.

A shadow taking the form of a human, wielding a sword.

Clank.

The sword aims at Taesan. Taesan readies himself.

There's absolutely no information on the opponent's level. The shadow that had been quietly watching him suddenly charges.

Thwack.

Seeing the charging shadow, Taesan is taken aback.

"Why so slow?"

It moves at the speed of an ordinary human. Considering that even a slight increase in stats transcends the realm of humans, it's too slow.

"Is that all?"

Taesan swings his sword cautiously, wary of any skills or special abilities.

The shadow couldn't even react and was slashed. The liquid disperses.

[First Trial Passed. Agility increases by 1 as a reward.]

Along with the system window, the dispersed liquid gathers again.

Clang.
Once again, a human-shaped figure appears.

Thwack.

The shadow charges again. This time, it's slightly faster than before. Its movements now surpass the limits of a human.

To be precise, it might be just slightly superior to an Olympic gold medalist in all metrics.

But to Taesan, it was painfully slow.

Just like before, it disappears with a single sword strike.

[Second Trial Passed. Strength increases by 1 as a reward.]

Squelch.

The liquid gathers once more.

The shadow takes human form again. Taesan realizes.

"Progressive levels, huh."

[Correct.]

The first shadow couldn't level up much, with stats barely different from a first-floor adventurer. The second shadow, now on the second floor, is beginning to challenge its limits.

The third would be an adventurer on the third floor, demonstrating movements that surpass humans.

Thwack.

As Taesan expected, this shadow moves faster than the previous one. With a swift sword movement, he knocks it down, only to see another shadow appear again.

[Third Trial Passed. Intelligence increases by 1 as a reward.]
"Are you testing me with the average strength of the Alone Mode?"

The deity of the trial. The intention was simple.

Test whether you truly possess the strength befitting this floor.

If you manage to defeat this shadow, another one with the strength of the 4th floor will likely appear.

It was fortunate timing. Taesan gripped his sword.

Already, it was an unfamiliar situation. In the Alone Mode, the player was Itaeyeon alone. She had descended avoiding everything else, so she was far from average. She couldn't be compared.

Moreover, monsters that hadn't been seen in Easy Mode started to appear. It was difficult to compare.

Comparing stats was meaningless.

[Itaeyeon] [Level: 258] [Health: 45810/45810] [Mana: 7020/7020] [Strength: 10152] [Intelligence: 9899] [Agility: 13254] [Attack Power +5421] [Defense +8456]

These were Itaeyeon's stats after clearing the labyrinth.

They were so high that comparisons were meaningless. Acceleration kept increasing as she descended, making it difficult to grasp her exact level.
So Taesan knew he was strong, but he didn't know what level he was in Alone Mode. He could only make a rough guess.

Understanding this was necessary.

Taesan swung his sword towards the shadow charging towards him.
