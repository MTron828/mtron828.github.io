Episode 96

96. Beheseta, The Young Lamb of the Messiah (6)

[Until now, it's just a level of suspicion, so let's leave it at that. In other words, the god Harmon was a mortal a hundred years ago. And I heard that often, right after becoming a transcendent being, the self is not fully intact.]

"So that became the reason for attacking the demons?"

[That possibility can't be ignored either. Gods tend to fixate on their own things. It wouldn't be wrong to say that this direction became more radical. The actions with the devils and the Chukji are risky, but it doesn't matter if they don't come out of their world.]

"Even at the level of the masjid, you can't win against the native gods."

" 맞아. 강한 신이라도 작은 것이 불리하다"

Taesan drew his sword. As always, he began his training to obtain the Ora.

* * *

Time passed. Taesan's routine remained unchanged. He ate, practiced with the sword, and drove away the pursuing hunters.

"Don't you ever get tired of this."

Taesan brushed his sword with a weary expression. It was becoming annoying to have to deal with this day after day. Perhaps if there was something to learn from these strong fellows, it wouldn't be such a waste of time, but there wasn't, so it was pointless.

After tidying up, Taesan returned to the cave.

Inside, Anetsha had her eyes closed, praying.

Taesan went out without disturbing her, catching fish or small game. Two hours later, when Anetsha opened her eyes, she was startled to see Taesan.

"Oh, when did you arrive?"

"Two hours ago."

"Oh... I'm sorry."

"It's fine."

Taesan gestured as he roughly grilled and ate the meat.

"Are you praying to the Masin?"

"Yes."

Anetsha calmly nodded her head.

The Masin abandoned them.

At least Anetsha knew that much.

Taesan ate his meal silently.
And that night, as always, the conversation began. They talked about Taesan's world and stories about the demons, discussing their varied natures.

In the midst of it all, naturally, talk turned to the Masin.

"The Masin is a very kind person. When I was young and scared of ghosts, unable to sleep, sometimes they would come down and comfort me."

With a longing expression, Anetsha murmured, and Taesan marveled.

"A god coming down to talk? Quite impressive, isn't it?"

"Is it common for the Masin to speak?"

"No, it's quite rare. My father was very pleased the few times the Masin spoke directly, saying it happens once in a thousand years."

Anetsha laughed as she spoke.

Watching her lost in memories, Taesan spoke up.

"That was ten years ago when it started falling apart, right?"

"...Yes."

Anetsha nodded sadly. Taesan stirred the campfire.

"Has god forsaken you?"

"No!"

Anetsha raised her voice.

"There must be some reason. Surely, there must be."

Anetsha bit her lip, her eyes filled with endless uncertainty.
Distrust, denial, and belief.

With eyes reflecting a spectrum of emotions, Taesan said no more.

Since they sent him here, they hadn't abandoned him. Yet without knowing the reason they insisted he not reveal his identity, he found it difficult to be sure of anything else.

Time passed amidst uncertainties.

Ten days had passed since Taesan descended here.

During that time, nothing of note had happened. It was just evading pursuers and preventing them, over and over again.

Sitting on a rock, Taesan tapped his foot.

"I may need to change the plan."

* * *

"I think we need to make a bigger splash."

"What?"

Anetsha, who had been adjusting Stu's straps, widened her eyes. Taesan continued.

"Things aren't working out like this. We need to change our approach."

"Um, is there some problem? If I did something wrong..."

"It's not you; it's this side's problem, so you don't need to worry about that."

Take Anetsha to a safe place. That's the Masin's quest.
However, there was no safe place in this world. Hamon sent trackers after him wherever he moved.

Even when he dug deep underground and hid with intent, within three hours the trackers pinpointed his exact location and attempted excavation, making it practically impossible to hide.

There were a few options.

The first was to protect Anetsha until her death. Unless a god descended directly, there was no one in this world who could stop Taesan, so it wasn't an impossible task.

But it took too long. Taesan wouldn't age and die, but it would easily take decades. Masin didn't seem to wish for such a clear solution.

Alternatively, there was the God of Light born from the earth. He would directly visit the temple of Hamon, the main god of Vekvessetha, to negotiate.

Initially, he had also considered that option. The gods he had seen so far were rational and valued honor as gods, so he had expected that even Taesan, who was closer to a hostile god's subordinates, would not be lightly touched.

But he dismissed this possibility because Hamon's spirit might not be intact.

After much consideration, Taesan realized the solution
"They said all demons went extinct, didn't they? Yet you're on the run. Could it be that there are others like you, hiding somewhere and building villages?"

Those who knew her.

Those who could protect her.

Those who were hiding their bodies.

In this world, he learned from the trackers that there were places beyond the sight of the gods, where one could hide and not be found.

Although he didn't know where that place was, everyone he had met knew it existed.

Perhaps the demons were hiding there.

"That's...,"

Anetsha closed her mouth. She knew about that as well. But there was a problem.

"I am being directly tracked by the gods. Even if we go to where they are hiding, we will only die together."

She said sadly.

It's true that she didn't want to see her kind, but she was sure that some of them had survived.

But she was being watched by the world. No matter where she went, the tracker would come after her, so she couldn't meet anyone.

"When that problem is resolved, would you like to?"

Anetsha nodded after a long pause.

"Then it's okay."
"Ha, but how do you plan to resolve this? Enemies keep coming endlessly..."

"It's simple."

Tae-san said firmly.

"Just show them our strength."

* * *

"There are quite a lot, aren't there?"

A man with a sword on his shoulder whistles.

At the edge of his gaze were over a hundred people.

And they were all somewhat notable figures.

"Wow, even high-ranking wizards have come?"

"They must belong to a newly formed faction. Probably intending to capture the Demon Princess for fame."

A red-haired woman holding a whip speaks calmly. The man nods in admiration as he surveys the surroundings.

"We've got ministers here. With this many people, we could just crush a whole city, couldn't we?"

"Don't get too excited; confirm and act. Did you forget why we're here?"

"Yes, yes. We have work to do."

The Demon Princess. Anetsha and her protectors.

Their story was currently the most talked-about tale worldwide.

The extinction of demons itself wasn't even a decade old, yet the last remaining Demon Princess had become a significant issue from the beginning.
Not long ago, everyone thought the princess would soon die. It was because a delicate and fragile girl couldn't survive the world's pursuit.

Some sent sympathetic glances, while others looked on with joyful emotions.

But one day, guards appeared for the Demon Princess.

In itself, it wasn't a remarkable event. Fleeing demons often sought out Anetsha to protect their princess after massacres.

But none of them lasted long and all perished. They could only buy time against the pursuers and couldn't successfully protect her.

Amidst this, someone truly capable of protecting the princess appeared.

And this guard was as strong as a monster.

They killed the wizards of the Demon Tower and completely shook off the pursuit of top-level hunters. Even elite swordsmen who went to capture the princess did not return.

Rumors spread that this person had reached the stature of a renowned Swordmaster.

The man and woman dispatched from the intelligence organization were there to understand him. The man sighed.

"No matter how much we're a minor organization in need of a breakthrough, isn't this too risky? After all, all the pursuers have died so far, haven't they?"
"Quiet down. Are we all going to starve to death like this? No arms, no information! We're an intelligence organization!"

The woman grumbled.

"And with this many, are we going to advance?"

They were enough in number and personnel. With this many, even if the opponent was truly a Swordmaster, they had a chance.

"Now it might be the end of the princess's story."

The woman muttered.

With serious expressions, they slowly entered the forest. Only strong individuals gathered, and although there were discordant notes among them, they bent to the danger and advanced without major issues.

And they could find it.

"There are many."

Mount Taesan greeted them in front of a small clearing.

"Hello?"

Chacha!

They quickly drew their weapons. The wizard raised his wand in preparation for a spell, and the archers pulled their bows taut.

The man scrutinizing Taesan frowned.

"Demon?"

Since Taesan had killed everyone who had come, no information about him was available. There were several arms, but they were spread by the demons, dragons, and other rumors.

Having seen these rumors, they first thought.
Black hair and black eyes. Naturally, their thoughts turned that way.

But upon closer inspection, they realized. It was merely their black color; it was not deep enough to be demons. Moreover, they didn't feel the typical aura of demons.

They recognized that Taesan was human.

The man scrutinized Taesan carefully.

He had a cold demeanor. His attire's material was indiscernible but looked quite fine, especially his weapon. At a glance, it was clearly a weapon belonging to a famous sword.

Even with hundreds of them in front of him, there was no fear or hesitation on his face.

"Ahem."

An elderly man in robes stepped forward.

He was a highly skilled wizard of a sect formed less than a century ago. The old man spoke to Taesan.

"Are you the guard of the abandoned princess?"

"If that's the case."

"Step aside. Our purpose is the princess. We have no intention of fighting you."

The old man waved his staff. Magic surged forcefully.

Taesan chuckled at the wizard's threat.

"No."

"...Are you really going to fight us?"

The old man, who had thought Taesan would step back obediently, was taken aback.
Over a hundred people had come, all of them belonging to the upper echelons of their respective groups.

Even if they were Swordmasters, it was a difficult situation to win.

"I won't kill you, so don't worry. You all just need to scatter far and wide."

Taesan rose from the rock. He stretched out his hand.

Swoosh.

Ice arrows appeared in the air.

"Since I happened to want to test something, come at me."
