**Chapter 521**

**521. The Eighth Return, Earth (6)**

In an instant, space distorts.

The physical force implemented by the system reveals itself to the world.

*Crunch*.

The Saint moves his body, trying to resist the physical force inflicted upon him.

Blackness rises. It envelops the Saint's entire body, creating an absolute defense that blocks all external interference.

The blackness is a power from beyond this world, surpassing all physical forces. It cannot be pierced by simple physical strength.

*Thud*.

But the blackness is pierced.

Pure physical force shatters the blackness. The Saint, as if in shock, tries to summon even more blackness. However, it's already too late. The sound of shattering fills the air as the entire blackness is broken through, and the Saint's physical body is touched.

*Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The sea has become a tsunami, spreading out in all directions. The surrounding land is collapsing, its foundation crumbling. Even with Taesan's maximum effort to restrain the force, the unstoppable physical power is spreading out like a beast in all directions.

"Aaahhh!"

"What, what's going on?"

People's bodies are being swept away like leaves in a storm.

"Haha!"

Minerva is shocked, manipulating the wind to grab the people who are about to fly away and return them to Greenland.

[Wooo!] [Aaah!]

The monsters are not much different. Many of them cannot withstand the aftermath and are being chased out of Greenland.

"Wait, just a moment."

Iteon is shocked. Even from this distance, he can feel the enormous physical power.

"What... what is that?"

It's not just simple physical power.

With that kind of density and force, it's a different kind of authority with the name of physical power.

"What kind of technique is this?"

A voice of disbelief echoes.

Zzzt!

Sado's body is distorted, unable to withstand the physical power and flying away to the other side of the universe.

The speed is incredibly fast, even Taesan can't easily catch up.

Taesan opens up space.

[You have activated teleportation.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan had already arrived at the location where the Sado would fly in, and was waiting with his hand stretched out, tracing the boundary line.

The Sado's body was caught in Taesan's hand.

Taesan dropped down, slamming the Sado into the deep earth.

Kuuuuuuuuung!

Taesan returned to the earth, shaking off his hand.

The Sado was in a state of near-death, struggling to muster up its strength, but it couldn't even manage that, and its dark energy didn't come out properly.

Taesan let out a dry laugh at the sight.

The Sado was a being that didn't have a clear physical strength. No matter how high its attack power was, it couldn't be defeated with just damage.

Such a being had been pushed to the brink of death with just a simple physical attack.

[……Wow.]

Bardley couldn't help but let out a sigh of amazement.

[If my eyes aren't deceiving me, the damage is over 40 billion.]

"That's right."

[It's... incredible.]

Bardley couldn't help but burst out laughing.

[I had expected this level of damage to occur.]

Add to that, and multiply it.

With Taesan's current attack power, it's not difficult to deal tens of billions of damage. It was something he already knew.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But what I saw was completely different. Forty billion? The number of digits itself was different. Damage that I couldn't even imagine was dealt in just two skill uses.

"Damage isn't that important."

To Taesan at this point, damage wasn't a crucial stat. Simply having high damage didn't mean you could take down a high-ranking noble.

They were beings that transcended the laws of this universe. Damage bound by the system couldn't inflict meaningful harm on a noble.

In other words, even if you got a multiplier, it didn't mean much.

It was all just talk until Balbam gave him a skill.

"I didn't expect it to be this much."

Taesan was also surprised.

The damage-to-physical-force conversion skill. Physical force was proportional to damage numbers, but his proficiency was still far too low.

Of course, with damage reaching forty billion, I thought it would be at least a certain level, but this was far beyond what I expected.

"Not bad."

No, it was quite good. This was exactly why I had struggled to get the multiplier.

To Taesan now, a noble wasn't a difficult opponent at all. Even without the multiplier, he could handle it without any problems."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But the fact that he could create a vacuum state with a single blow, meant that this skill had a value equivalent to a boundary line to him.

"Satisfying."

Taesan smiled joyfully and raised his sword to finish. The boundary line began to gather on the sword, swirling around it.

Just as Taesan was about to swing his sword, he hesitated.

The moment he summoned the boundary line, he felt a strange sensation. It was an indescribable feeling, as if something unknown had intervened.

Taesan gazed at the boundary line flickering on his sword. And he realized what that strange sensation was.

The boundary line was slightly escaping his control, flowing somewhere.

Taesan easily realized where it was going.

It was the crack in the sky.

Taesan scowled.

"What's going on?"

After gazing at the crack for a moment, Taesan swung his sword. The sword pierced the neck of the demon, and a grayish light enveloped its entire body.

[Your spiritual power has increased. Your proficiency with the black sword has risen by 3%.] [You have activated teleportation.]

Taesan returned to Greenland once again."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The ground was completely destroyed, all the way to the foundation. Even though he controlled the direction of his power as much as possible, the place where he clashed with the apostle was completely ruined and had turned into the sea.

"The orb is still intact."

Even amidst the chaos, the orb was still standing firm.

Taesan spoke briefly.

"Get up and fill it."

[You have activated the declaration of restoration.]

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The destroyed foundation rose again, recreating the ground. It returned to its original state, just like when Taesan first arrived.

Taesan moved to another orb. There, people were desperately fighting against monsters.

Quadd-thud.

A monster's neck was pierced by Kim Hwi-yeon's sword and it fell. There were no more monsters in sight.

Kim Hwi-yeon shouted with a joyful face.

"We won!"

"Oo-oo-oo!"

The people's cheers erupted. Everyone was happy, holding their weapons.

They had won.

* * *

But their joy was short-lived.

As soon as they defeated all the monsters, new ones emerged immediately.

"It's like a wheel of war. Let's hold on!"

"Yes!"

Fortunately, the newly appeared monsters were not that many. Their strength was also at a moderate level, so they could be blocked by taking turns.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

As they gained a bit of leisure, they looked around.

"But where is Taesan-nim? I want to pray, but..."

"I know where he is."

Amelia looked up at the sky with an ambiguous expression.

"You won't be able to see him."

"There are many things I want to ask, but he won't come down."

I-tae-yeon grumbled.

Taesan was above the sky.

In front of the massive, dark crack, he was staring at the crack. The pillar of light implemented on the orb was roughly pounding the crack, but the crack was withstanding it without a large tremor.

A deep, dark hole that even absorbed light.

This was the boundary that connected this world to the world of Goshin.

Taesan, who had been staring at the crack for a moment, raised his hand.

Flicker.

A boundary line that was neither light nor darkness appeared on his hand.

At the same time, Taesan could see it. Part of the boundary line was being sucked into the crack in the sky.

The crack, which had swallowed the boundary line, grew slightly in power and size. Taesan grasped the boundary line and pulled it out.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Every time he drew the boundary line, a part of it would get sucked into the crack in the sky.

It was an extremely small, almost imperceptible movement, but it was a clear shift.

Taesan gazed at the crack.

He felt a strange sense of familiarity from the crack.

It wasn't a familiarity with the crack itself, but rather a sense of closeness to the concept of the crack.

"Hmm."

Taesan returned to the ground. He thought about the characteristics of the apostle he had defeated.

The apostle had a normal human form.

It wasn't particularly strong, nor was it fast. It was strange, considering that all the apostles he had seen so far had unique and intense characteristics.

Taesan slowly recalled his memories. What abilities had the apostle possessed?

"......Black."

The black color that the apostle had wielded.

It was mysteriously different from the black color wielded by other apostles. It was darker, more unusual.

What if Taesan had faced an apostle with an unusual black color, one that was incompatible with the boundary line? He calculated it in his mind. As a transcender, he could simulate reality closely.

And the answer came to him.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It takes a lot of time.

Of course, it's not difficult.

The current Taesan was an opponent who could be defeated without any major issues by the swordsman.

It was a problem of compatibility.

The black sword wielded by the swordsman was optimized to block the boundary line. It would stubbornly cling to it, making Taesan continue to use the boundary line.

And some parts of the boundary line being used would likely be sucked into the crack.

Taesan realized what the high gods were aiming for in this return.

The fact that he was using the boundary line was itself the goal of the high gods.

"Not a bad plan."

The boundary line was the greatest power for Taesan. Sealing it and fighting was like fighting with bound arms and legs.

But if he used it, it would be a countermeasure for the high gods. They would find a way to continuously suck in the boundary line.

It was a kind of gamble.

"You planned well."

But there was one problem.

The fact that Taesan had obtained multiplication was the issue.

With his current physical strength, he could make the swordsman half-dead even without using the boundary line.

"The timing is also good."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan gazed up at the crack in the sky with a relaxed expression.

After that, the monster didn't appear for almost a week.

Although a few hundred A-grade and one or two S-grade monsters came down, they could be blocked without any damage.

Taesan's appearance was as if he was bewildered and hesitant.

Taesan's multiplication was an irregular among irregulars. He could knock down the enemy with pure physical strength alone. Even magicians couldn't predict this skill, so it was impossible for the gods to predict it. The plan was perfectly ruined.

Meanwhile, time kept passing.

The golden light covering the crack in the sky grew bigger and bigger.

"I think it'll take about a month..."

"There's still a lot of time left."

A month. A specific time frame was set. People's morale rose.

And finally, as if they had reached a conclusion, the monsters started pouring down again.

"Here they come! Everyone, get ready!"

People who were quietly resting jumped up in a hurry. They looked up at the sky and were shocked.

The entire sky was covered with monsters, and nothing could be seen.

"Are they going to get an advantage this time?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan muttered to himself. Monsters had also landed in front of him.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

[$%%^%& appeared.] [#@!!!! appeared.] [!@%^&&& appeared.]

"Are there three sages?"

Three sages surrounded Taesan.

[You activated reconnaissance.] [You activated essence detection.]

Taesan, who had roughly grasped the information about the sages, was certain.

The gods were aiming for him to use the boundary line.

These sages were sacrificial pawns for that. They probably still had an important card up their sleeve.

Then, Taesan's next action was simple.

He wouldn't use the boundary line.

Taesan moved his body. The sages tried to respond, but Taesan was much faster. He drew his sword and swung it.

[You activated addition.] [You activated multiplication.]

Whoa.

[$%%^%& took 4,412,382,124 damage.]

The sage desperately tried to block it.

But his defense was shattered, and his body flew away to the other side of the universe.

Kuuuuuuuuung!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Let's use multiplication, just like we've been waiting for," and the other apostles rushed in as if they had been waiting. It was a movement that clearly showed they were using the boundary line.

Of course, Taesan had no intention of using the boundary line.

Taesan lightly moved his body, making the positions of the two apostles overlap.

[You used the distorted ring of regret, and the cooldown of multiplication was reset.] [You activated addition.] [You activated multiplication.] [You activated copying.]

"Let's go together."

With a calm swing of his sword, the bodies of the two apostles were separated.
