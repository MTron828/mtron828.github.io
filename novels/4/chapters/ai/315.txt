Chapter 316

316. The Fifth Return, Earth (12)

Taesan was experimenting with various things, manipulating the divine power in the fallen heavenly realm.

[Divine Power] [Proficiency: 81%] [The power of God. Originally, it had no meaning, but as many people's beliefs gathered, it became divine. People's beliefs and faith can now have various influences on the world.]

As the proficiency reached 80%, he could now control it not only for recovery but also for other powers. Taesan gathered the divine power. The divine power spread out in all directions, forming a golden-hued domain.

[A sacred site?]

The ghost murmured. A domain blessed by God. That was now unfolding in the heavenly realm.

"Minerva, try hitting it."

"Got it."

Minerva, standing in front of the domain, gathered the wind and struck it. The golden hue that collided with the wind remained unwavering, holding its ground.

"It's quite sturdy, despite being made with my own power."

"Is this the creation of a domain?"

The domain created with divine power had the ability to protect the people inside and repel external enemies.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not bad, but it's somehow uncertain. The concept of a domain only has meaning when it protects many people, and it's not very valuable in a labyrinth. Moreover, the amount of divine power being consumed was considerable.

On Earth, people's faith can be directly infused, allowing for unrestricted use, but it's impossible in a labyrinth. At least for now, it seems difficult to use it for anything other than recovery.

"Or maybe it can be combined with other domains?"

The power to spread divine power and create a domain.

In a way, it was similar to the green witch's magic. It was possible to link the two powers and amplify each other.

Taesan turned off his divine power.

He thought about going back to the labyrinth and experimenting with various things.

And from afar, he could hear cheers coming from all directions. Taesan headed towards where they were.

There, Kim Hwi-yeon was staring at the flames hovering in mid-air with a dazed expression.

"Did you summon this?"

"Ah. Taesan-si. Yes...".

Kim Hwi-yeon nodded.

The flames hovering in mid-air were attached to her arm, flailing about.

Taesan, who was looking at the flames, said:

"A low-grade spirit?"

"It seems so. This is really weird."

Kim Hwi-yeon scratched her head."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Spirit God, Beatrice, granted a reward for the victory on Taesan. The power she gave to people was harmony with nature.

[Harmony with Nature] [Increases affinity with nature, allowing one to make a contract with nature's existence.]

Now, people could make a contract with the spirits.

Let's take a look around. Besides Kim Hwi-yeon, many people were summoning spirits. Thousands, tens of thousands of low-ranking spirits were summoned to the ground.

It was a decent reward. Having a being that assists you in battle by your side was a huge change that could alter the way you fight.

"Uh... I only realized it now."

Kim Hwi-yeon looked at Minerva, who was standing next to Taesan. Not only her, but the people around her were also gazing at Minerva in awe.

Only now, after making a contract with the spirits, did they understand.

The power contained within Minerva was, literally, the world itself.

The nature that protected the entire world was condensed within Minerva. People saw her again, veiled by Taesan's power. Minerva looked at her own hand, as if responding to the gaze directed at her."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It wasn't like this originally. I've also undergone many changes this time."

The Spirit God also gave a reward regarding Taesan. Naturally, the reward was related to the Spirit, so the change in Minerva was greater than Taesan's.

[Special Passive Skill: Direct Contract] [Direct contract with the Spirit. The contracted Spirits can use their original power without being restricted by the contractor's power.] [Special Passive Skill: Spirit God's Blessing] [Spirit God's Blessing. Even if the contracted Spirits use up their power, they will not be reverse-summoned.]

The effects of the two skills were simple.

Now, Minerva could use the original power of the Spirit King without worrying about being reverse-summoned due to power consumption.

"I didn't know you would do this much for me."

Minerva, who could now wield perfect power, waved her hand. A gentle breeze spread around her.

"So, will I never be reverse-summoned again?"

"That's not the case. If you take a certain amount of damage, you'll be reverse-summoned. But it's unlikely to happen unless it's a special circumstance."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Mnerva is the Spirit King. Despite having the power to rival the depths, she has been unable to make a big impact due to her limitations.

Now that Mnerva can fully wield her own power, she will be a great help to Taesan as well.

Taesan took out a stone from his inventory.

[A Stone of Evolution, imbued with the power of nature] [A Stone of Evolution, imbued with the power of nature. It raises the power of the Spirit by one level.]

"Can't you use it?"

"Yes. I'm the Spirit King. This is a kind of limit that Spirits can reach. It's not impossible to surpass, but it's not possible with this."

If it weren't for Mnerva, there would be only one target to use it on. Taesan handed the stone to Balkaja.

"Use it."

[……Is this really okay?]

Balkaja asked in a bewildered tone.

[This is something our God has directly bestowed upon us. Its value cannot be measured in words.]

The evolution of a Spirit is a rare occurrence even in the history of Spirits.

Even if a high-ranking Spirit works hard for hundreds of years, it's difficult to become the highest rank, and even if the highest rank works hard for thousands of years, it's almost impossible to gain the power of creation and protection.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A stone that allows one to transcend the gap in power at once. It was a reward that only a spirit god could give.

Taesan said with a serious tone.

"There's no one to give it to, so I'll just take it."

[...What a bold master I have. I did well in making a contract with him.]

Barcaga laughed dryly and received the stone.

The stone, which had a rough, rugged color, began to break apart, and its power started to settle within Barcaga.

[Oh...].

Barcaga let out a quiet sigh. The power within him had begun to evolve to the next level.

"There's no big change on the outside."

Taesan said, observing him. Barcaga still had the appearance of a golem, but the power within him had definitely changed.

[It's true that I've become stronger... but it's still hard for me to directly intervene in my master's battles.]

It wasn't a wrong statement. Even if Barcaga had become stronger, he was still at the level of a sword and shield. From now on, Taesan's opponents would all be powerful beings above the level of spirit kings.

[At least I'm lucky to be a supporting spirit, so I can help by supporting Lady Minerva in a supporting role.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Barcaga applauded. A faint, rainbow-colored light erupted around Minerva. Minerva, who was controlling the wind, had her power amplified to an extent that was impossible for her to handle alone.

"Not bad."

[Not bad at all. Really, the owner is strange as always.]

What Barcaga received was not something that could be given away so easily. It was an item that, if valued in human terms, would be worth more than selling an entire country, and yet it was being handed over like a recovery potion.

Barcaga was speechless.

In addition, he acquired several skills, and his proficiency level changed. Taesan began to check them one by one.

[Special Passive Skill: Distorted Spirit Tuning] [Proficiency: 64%] [Distorted beings can control their spirits with a slight burden. By shouldering a very small burden, they can control the spirits within themselves or those they possess.]

As the proficiency of Distorted Spirit Tuning reached 60%, the burden of controlling spirits almost disappeared.

It was a small but good change. Among the powers Taesan was currently handling, the ones that affected the mind were significant. The fact that one of those burdens had disappeared meant he could focus more on his divine authority or sacred powers.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Special Always-Active Skill: Seed of Life] [Proficiency: 1%] [It partially steals the power that exists within, which was possessed by the being that grasped life. It assists in increasing vitality.]

Originally, it was a life-draining skill, but it changed due to the increase in vitality. The life-draining skill might be the one given by the Immortal to the True Dragon.

The enhancement of vitality increase. It was a significant change that would be greatly helpful even if not paid much attention to.

The proficiency of the black skill also increased to 1%. The proficiency of the concept skill also rose to 3%.

And the proficiency of the Boundary Line changed as well.

[Boundary Line] [Proficiency:?] [Something between laws and beyond laws. It manipulates the sacred and the black.] [??????] [System error. Please contact the administrator of the Labyrinth for details.]

It was unclear whether it increased, decreased, or by how much. The proficiency increase window was written in a strange language that couldn't be understood.

Taesan recalled the previous battle.

The True Dragon, who received the baptism of the Ancient God, possessed strength comparable to a single-digit monster.

Even Taesan now could win, but it would be an opponent that would require fighting for dozens of hours.

However, the Boundary Line easily crushed such an opponent.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even though I didn't have the proper power, I was able to manipulate it forcefully using my divine power. 

And after using it a few times, I was able to get a rough sense of it.

The boundary line erases the monster's power itself.

There were skills that could erase something, such as an absolute judgment that erases defense, or an essential strike that erases the opponent's stance.

But all of them only affected one concept.

The boundary line, on the other hand, erased not only the opponent's stance or defense, but literally everything.

It was a power that could influence even the laws and concepts of the world, as if ignoring them.

If he didn't missee it, when he unleashed the boundary line at the end, it affected the barrier that Beatrice had set up.

The existence of the mortal shook the barrier created by a being with an incomprehensible power.

'What is this?'

It was a power he possessed, but even he couldn't understand it.

'The gods are showing their greed.'

If I could wield it properly, there would be no one who could stop him in the labyrinth.

But that was impossible."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This time, he was able to handle the boundary line because people directly worshiped him as they fought against him. Therefore, he was able to barely suppress the grayish color with his rising divine power.

In the labyrinth, such battles were impossible because the recovery speed of divine power was limited.

Moreover, his weapon was also broken. It was fortunate that he only used the boundary line with the Heavenly Best Sword. If he had made a mistake, he would have lost both swords.

[I had never heard the story of the labyrinth's weapon being broken.]

The ghost also said, "It's unbelievable."

The risk didn't end there. The divine power was the power of the gods. As Taesan, a mortal, didn't have enough qualifications to handle it, the more he tried to handle it, the more the divine power tried to consume him.

If he made a mistake, the divine power would devour him, and he would become a being that only received faith, losing his self, like a machine.

The black power was no different. Either way, it was not a power that Taesan could currently possess. He couldn't handle such a powerful force recklessly.

"It's far away. Not yet."

Taesan muttered to himself.

But there was something that could help Taesan.

A pair of rings changed. The white ring, which had been dyed pure white, had its own spiritual power and an additional description that it assisted divine power."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The change in the blackened ring was simple. Its attack power increased by 250 and became heavenly.

The ring that grew stronger as Taesan grew stronger would be of great help in dealing with the boundary line later on.

The rough check was over.

People were examining the new spirits they had just contracted. Those who were delighted with their newfound power cheered and shouted Taesan's name.

However, there was no change in the divine power.

When it reached 81%, it was blocked again. Taesan, who had a carefree mind, thinking that it would eventually rise, helped Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk with their training during the remaining time.

And a day passed.
