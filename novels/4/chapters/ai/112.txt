113. 24th Floor. Guide of Sin (2)

What just happened?

Horian, slammed into the ground, was the first thought that crossed his mind. He struggled to lift his head. A tingling sensation was felt on his face.

"You, you...!"

As Horian barely got up, Taesan was already charging towards him. Horian raised his sword in panic. Taesan swung two swords.

Clang!

Contrary to Taesan's expectations of overwhelming power, their stats were nearly equal.

Despite their similar stamina due to lacking a significant increase in agility, the fact that Horian's equipment compensated for the gap in strength and speed was evident.

His opponent was a 30th-floor adventurer. It was natural for him to obtain better materials and equipment from the store.

Clang!

The swords clashed and recoiled equally. Horian's face betrayed disbelief.

"This, this...!"

He was not the ordinary 30th-floor adventurer as Taesan had anticipated.
As with the guides of sin on the 20th floor, he too was an adventurer who had stalled at the 30th floor. As such, he had maxed out all levels achievable at the 30th floor, purchased all equipment available from the store, and completed all refinements using a blacksmith.

He was at a level where he could easily dominate an average 30th-floor adventurer. Even if they were to engage in a melee, his skills were sufficient to manage the fight with cunning and precision.

However, against Taesan on the 24th floor, he was not just being dominated but pushed back.

Clang.

As the sword was pushed back, it cut through Horian's thigh.

[Horian takes 225 damage.]

"Why this much damage!"

Horian was bewildered. The equipment gap between the 24th and 30th floors was absolute.

Moreover, he had strengthened himself to the limits of the 30th floor.

In essence, it was reasonable to assume that no damage would be inflicted on him.

However, the damage coming from Taesan was at an unbelievable level.

"I'm a special case."

Ora. Even if Horian's equipment was superior, it was as good as non-existent unless there was a skill that penetrated physical defense.

The guide of the third tier did not even know the strength of a ghost. Horian gnashed his teeth as he charged forward.

"Eeek!"

[Horian activates Counter.] [You activate Thunderbolt.]
Counter is a skill that avoids evadable attacks and counterattacks. It's useless against skills that cannot be avoided. That's the weakness of Counter.

Taesan drives his sword into Horian's chest. Believing in his Counter, Horian rushed forward without taking any additional defensive measures, and the sword pierced through his chest.

[Horian takes 67 damage.]

"Th-this...."

Horian grasped his chest and stepped back, but Taesan didn't stop advancing.

[You activate Acceleration.]

It was a one-sided fight.

As a guide of the third tier, Horian was significantly stronger than those of the second tier. However, Taesan had already defeated guides of the third tier on lower floors.

Moreover, having descended into the labyrinth, Taesan had become much stronger than before, making him an unbeatable opponent. Horian attempted to resist, then considered fleeing, but was blocked by Taesan's dark magic and spells.

"Argh!"

Before long, Horian crashed to the ground.

Taesan pressed the tip of his sword against Horian's forehead.

"I have a question for you, will you answer? If so, I'll kill you without any trouble."

"You...."

Horian gritted his teeth.

"Who are you! I've never heard of someone like you!"
"To think a guide of the second tier could dominate over the third tier. Impossible. If they were at that level to begin with, the leadership would have authorized their descent to the depths."

Taesan prodded Horian's forehead as he responded.

"Not long ago, your friend ascended, didn't they? And then died?"

"...."

Horian's pupils trembled. A guide of the third tier. Jagan. The name flashed through his mind.

"But... I heard they died together."

"That's a blatant lie."

Horian let out a bitter laugh.

Someone capable of defeating adventurers from the 20th to the 30th floors. Furthermore, becoming stronger upon descending. Horian never had a chance of winning.

His spirit faltered. There was no need to impress with his own proof. In exchange for a peaceful death, Taesan asked:

"What is the leadership doing right now?"

There was no more hiding. If he killed adventurers of the third tier, the leadership would inevitably learn of that information. Their actions were only a matter of time.

Horian replied wearily to Taesan's question:

"They cannot ascend right now."

"What?"
"The leadership has been stuck at a certain level for a long time. I heard they've been absent from their positions for a while to pass through there. They probably won't show themselves for a while."

"Hmm..."

The ghost hinted at a point he could guess.

"Do you know anything?"

"It's nothing much, but even when I was alive, they were stuck and talking nonsense. Could it be they still haven't broken through there? That's pitiful."

"They're stuck?"

"As you descend deeper, you encounter more unreasonable levels."

"Like what?"

"For example, 'Break through a planet in one hour,' or 'Confront three enemies of equal caliber simultaneously,' or 'Capture a dragon with basic equipment,' levels like that."

"That sounds... unreasonable."

Taesan had seen a dragon in Bequerta. He had witnessed its strength and power firsthand.

To think they would try to capture it with nothing but a cloth armor and a rusty sword. It was laughable.

"Typical levels allow you to descend even without defeating a boss, but in such places, if you don't clear the conditions, you can't descend at all. They're probably stuck there."

Itaeyun had said something similar. There were occasional levels so absurdly unreasonable that they had almost died trying to break through them.
Here's the translation of the text:

Back then, I just thought it was the usual whining and let it slide, but it seemed there was a truly unreasonable level.

Horian, who belatedly recognized the warrior, let out a sigh.

"War... rior."

[Hey there? You might not remember, but we've seen each other before, right?]

The ghost chuckled.

[You were just a bystander, so I didn't pay attention to you. Instead, let me ask you one thing.]

"...What would you like to know?"

[Is Sosiet Gardentia still alive?]

Understanding the meaning of the question, Horian nodded with a wry smile.

"I haven't heard any news of his death. I suppose that means he's alive."

[That's all I needed to know. A scoundrel like you wouldn't know more than that, so my business here is done.]

"...Then I hope for a peaceful death for you."

"I won't break my promise."

Taesan's sword pierced Horian's heart.

[Your level has increased.] [Your attributes have increased permanently: Strength +26, Agility +24, Intelligence +22, Stamina +120, Mana +22.] [Counter proficiency has increased by 5%.]

In an instant, he became stronger.

"As sharp as ever."
Here's the English translation of the text:

The increase in experience was an outstanding skill even against monsters, but its true value shone through when facing fellow adventurers.

As stats soared by large numbers, plundering everything they possessed led to acquiring new skills or advancing proficiency.

In addition, there was a significant increase in stamina that monsters could not obtain. It was literally an overall increase.

"Status Window."

[Gang Taesan] [Level: 56] [Shield: 292/292] [Health: 3460/3460] [Mana: 652/652] [Magic Power: 41/41] [Strength: 1145] [Intelligence: 812] [Agility: 984] [Attack +145] [Defense +172] [The target is in optimal condition.] [These stats are unbelievable.]

"You still have a long way to go."

Even with this, catching up to Lee Taeyeon is difficult. Taesan's words amazed the ghost.

"Do you think these stats and this health make sense at level 56? It would be worth seeing if they don't die and go deep down."

The labyrinth has acceleration. And when it reaches the depth, it literally explodes. Most of Lee Taeyeon's unbelievable stats were achieved by reaching the depths.

"Let's go down for now."

It's still a distant story.
However, at the same time, it was also a place they could reach soon.

Taesan cleaned up the corpses and broke through the labyrinth.

* * *

The administrator overseeing adventurers of each hierarchy had a life stone given by the headquarters.

Life stones were connected to the lives of each guide, so they could immediately know if they died or suffered serious injuries.

That's how they knew Horyan had died.

"He's dead?"

"What nonsense all of a sudden?"

"You know Horyan who said he'd come up for a moment."

"Why would he?"

A man sitting on a plush sofa muttered. Adventurers who could no longer descend had prepared all sorts of luxuries. It was natural after becoming as strong as possible since there was nowhere left to spend money.

"He's dead."

In the hands of the young man going upstairs was a single gem. The fire contained within it had completely vanished.

The man lying on the sofa furrowed his brow.

"...He's dead?"

"Look. It's gone out."

"Isn't it a mistake?"

"Could the gem connected to life itself be wrong? Isn't it more likely that he's really dead?"
"Hmm."

The man got up with a rustling sound.

"First, gather the kids. Let's talk."

Shortly after, the eight guides of sin gathered in one room. A woman with a languid face yawned.

"Why call us busy people?"

"You call sleeping busy? Deep sleep is a precious art."

"You say that after sleeping for three minutes a day?"

There was no passion or enthusiasm apparent in their idle chatter.

Having been stuck on the 30th floor for a long time, they had used every means to become stronger. And they had reached the end of it all.

Strength had faded, and there were no opponents left to challenge. The guides of sin rarely fought each other or anyone else. After living for decades, everything had worn them down.

"They might as well be dead."

The administrator of the third hierarchy who called them chuckled. They had once descended into the labyrinth with passion. But fear of death turned them into guides, and this was the result of that choice.
"I should have died back then."

Back in their days as adventurers.

If they had died back when they were still dreaming of conquering the labyrinth and aiming for conquest, they might have kept their purity.

But it was all in the past. They made their choices, and this was the result.

The administrator, having organized his thoughts, spoke.

"Horian is dead."

At those words, a moment of silence fell. A young man with white hair spoke with a bewildered expression.

"Him?"

"Did he try to go beyond the 31st floor? So the guides of the 4th hierarchy killed him?"

"No. Horian died on the 24th floor. That's why... he called for you."

The administrator said softly.

"If any of us were to die, we would be the most likely suspects."

When adventurers kill adventurers, their levels rise. It's the only way for them to grow when their growth is stifled.

But they grimaced uncomfortably.

"Who would do such a thing?"

"If you get caught because your level changes right away and you try to go down, you'll be hit and killed. Even if you don't go down, we'll tear you apart. Either way, who would do such a stupid act of dying."

"I know."
The guide who kills a comrade is immediately assassinated. Even if their level rises by 1 or 2, they don't become noticeably stronger, so there's no way to resist. It's an inexplicable act.

"But Horian is dead. Adventurers from the second hierarchy couldn't possibly kill him. That's why I mentioned it."

It was a matter of equipment. Adventurers from the second hierarchy could overwhelm Horian with their fervor, but they couldn't kill him. Even if they struck, the damage was minimal, allowing him a chance to escape.

"Hmm..."

Neither the guides from the second hierarchy nor those from the third. After much deliberation, someone spoke up.

"Isn't it him?"

"Who?"

"The guy who supposedly killed Zagan not long ago. Said he was accompanied by the ghost of a hero."

"Oh."

They belatedly realized the mountain of his existence.

"Zagan actually died at the hands of that guy, right? It was unpleasant to see, but he wasn't weak."

They despised Zagan. Possessing the arrogance of demons, they held a despicable belief that weaklings should be trampled upon. Even in the third hierarchy, Zagan was subject to persecution.

Still, Zagan wasn't weak. With the typical dark magic of demons, he made it to the middle ranks of the third hierarchy despite being treated as an outcast.

The administrator let out a sigh.
"...Yeah. He ascended to the 20th floor and died. But he died together with him, didn't he?"

The adventurer who accompanied the ghost of Zagan and the hero had reached the 20th floor. That was the information they knew.

"What if that's a lie?"

"Would adventurers from the second hierarchy lie?"

"It's possible. Wouldn't they have thought to survive as long as possible after resisting the one who defeated Zagan?"

"It's possible indeed."

The administrator's pupils narrowed. Regardless, it was something that needed confirmation.

"Let's go up together."

"You want us to go up together just to catch that guy?"

"He's the one who defeated Zagan from the second hierarchy. He must have grown stronger coming down. We mustn't let our guard down."

"But do we really need everyone to go up?"

They showed reluctance with uncertain expressions.

"He's just an adventurer from the 24th floor. He defeated Zagan and Horian, but those were one-on-one, right? With more than one, it should be a guaranteed victory."

"True. Maybe just three of us should go?"

"Do you think so?"

The administrator murmured.

"Then let four go up. We can always retreat if needed."

"No need to retreat."
"I'll tidy up quickly and be back. I need to get more rest."

Four guides of sin ascended the labyrinth. The rest began waiting leisurely for them.

If it were them from before, they wouldn't have made such judgments.

The strength of the enemy is an unknown, and it's certain they are stronger than each of them individually. The correct answer is for everyone to go up together and overpower them.

However, they had spent nearly thirty years on the 30th floor.

The powerless passage of time had made them sluggish.

Their judgment had become clouded, and they had developed an enormous confidence to avoid being swallowed up by helplessness.

If the second hierarchy had gained arrogance and complacency after a long time, the third hierarchy had gained laziness and helplessness.

The guides of the second hierarchy paid the price.

It was also time for the third hierarchy to pay the price.
