**Chapter 486**

**91st Floor. Uroboros (7)**

Essential took Taesan to a small space, away from the central area.

This was Essential's domain. Within the distorted power of Uroboros, Essential was proudly protecting its own domain.

"Well, it seems like we have a lot to ask each other. Shall we start talking?"

"Then, thank you. I have something to ask Essential-nim."

Taesan looked at Essential.

"Do you know a woman named Lee Tae-yeon? She's a twenty-something woman with black hair and black eyes."

"Lee Tae-yeon?"

Essential tilted its head.

"Who is that? I don't know."

"I see."

It seemed like Taesan had thought that Essential might have obtained the stone by encountering Lee Tae-yeon, but that wasn't the case. It seemed like she had used her own unique method. It was natural that she couldn't enter this place with her level of power.

"Is that the end of your questions?"

"No, I have something else I really want to ask."

This is where the main topic begins. Taesan opened his mouth.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Do you know about the usurper? Can I ask what kind of existence it is?"

"Originally, we shouldn't talk about their information carelessly, but... I suppose it's okay with someone like you."

The usurper.

Even the gods have forgotten, an unknown existence.

But Essential seemed to know about the usurper. And indeed, Essential answered without hesitation.

"It's nothing. It's just a being that does what its name says. It's a being that usurps this world."

"......The world?"

Taesan was slightly surprised.

He had thought that the usurper's power was a concept that usurped divine names or titles, but...

But to usurp the world itself?

Taesan realized that the usurper was an even higher-level existence than he had expected.

Essential scowled.

"It's quite an unusual existence among gods. Because it's a god that can manipulate the laws of this world to some extent."

"The laws of the world? Is that possible?"

Beings in this world cannot wield power from the other side. Gods cannot manipulate the laws of this world.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was an unchanging truth. The lowly servants who had devoted themselves to the gods could wield the gods' power, but their very essence had been tainted by the gods, making it possible.

Only Taesan was able to wield two powers simultaneously.

"It's not about truly mastering it. It's more like mimicking it like a parrot. But even so, the fact that we can utilize this concept under the gods' domain remains unchanged."

Essential's face showed discomfort.

"That guy is usurping all the structures that make up this world. And those who are usurped, their very concept is forgotten in this world. Like your master, a tool that has become a servant."

Essential moved his finger. The tip of it was pointing towards Taesan's ring finger, heading towards Akasha.

"It seems that your master was also a transcendent being who was usurped by the usurper. I don't know who it was, but... considering that you, who exist in this world, haven't been erased despite being in a usurped state, your master must have been a very powerful god, close to the concept."

[Can I find the one I served... myself?]

"I don't know," Essential replied indifferently.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It seems you're not remembering correctly either. You might be able to regain your memories and restore your divine authority, but I've never heard of someone who's been usurped regaining their power."

"That's... true."

"Is that the usurper?"

I thought it was a hidden secret.

I thought it would take a long time to figure it out, but I was able to find the answer more easily than I thought. Taesan asked again.

"What is the usurper's exact ability?"

"Uh..."

Essential didn't answer. He opened his mouth with an ambiguous expression.

"I don't know."

"What?"

"That guy is completely shrouded in mystery. All I know is that he participated in the war, usurping many transcenders and concepts of the world, but I don't know anything beyond that."

"Have you never fought him, Essential-nim?"

"No. Not just me, but others don't know either. Those who fought him have all forgotten. I only know that someone existed, but I don't know who it was."

"......"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'm going to conquer the world. There's no more information than that. No one knows what its true form is or what its exact abilities are. Come to think of it... it suddenly disappeared at the end of the war. Thanks to that, it was quite frustrating, but it never showed up until the end. Did some transcendent being seal it away?

The conclusion was that even the Essentials didn't know. This was the limit of the information we could gather. Taesan organized the information in his head.

"Thank you."

This was enough. A rough outline had been drawn. The Essential smiled faintly.

"It doesn't matter. Is there anything else you want to ask?"

"Yes, there is. Why did Uroboros devour the universe?"

We only knew that God was involved, but nothing more. The Essential, who had been here for a long time, would know more about it than anyone else.

"Rather than explaining, it's faster to show you. Follow me."

The Essential got up from his seat and headed back to the center of Uroboros. As he pushed through the distorted time and space, the invisible, formless energies that were stuck to the space began to appear.

They were stuck to time and space, and something invisible was gradually absorbing them.

Taesan understood.

The moment it absorbs that, its value disappears."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What's more, the sharp and sturdy sword becomes rusty, and the radiant golden light turns into a dull, rough stone. Unwavering determination. Lofty pride. The power to empty everything was within it.

The aura of nothingness that renders all values in the world meaningless.

As they entered, their numbers increased exponentially.

"I've called out the number."

Essential licked his lips and took a step forward. His very existence expanded.

Kiiiiing!

That was the essence of Essential. His essence, which had taken on a physical form, shattered the aura of nothingness that filled the space and pushed it back. The horizon opened up, and Taesan could see something.

"Do you see it? No, it's more accurate to ask if you can feel it."

"......Yes."

Something invisible was gathered together. Even Taesan couldn't see it now. In that aura of nothingness, nothing could be felt.

In the space distorted and ruined by Uroboros, only emptiness remained.

Its size was comparable to a mountain range.

"That's the source of Uroboros's power, and it's what's preventing me from finding a way to escape from here. A worthless existence."

* * *

The worthless existence groaned and inflated its body.

Note: Uroboros is a mythological symbol of a snake eating its own tail, often representing cycles and self-destruction. In this context, it seems to be a powerful entity that is causing destruction and chaos.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was absorbing the time and space around it, gradually growing in size, and filling itself up.

"Annoying thing."

Essential scrunched up its face and unleashed its power. Its essence. It was materializing itself and knocking down the worthless ones.

But the worthless ones didn't back down.

They clung to Essential's essence, trying to fill themselves up. The value that Essential's essence possessed was slowly disappearing.

"Tsk."

Essential shook off the worthless, parasitic beings that had attached themselves to it, recovering its strength. Through a series of exchanges, Taesan was able to understand.

"It's not a fragment."

That wasn't a small concept like a fragment.

It was the divine itself.

"The worthless ones are not independent entities. They're a collection of countless small nuclei. One of those nuclei has taken root inside Uroboros."

Essential said, pushing away the worthless ones that were slowly approaching.

"The main body is as large as the sun. Compared to that, this is just a tiny, cute level."

"What's something like that doing here?"

"I don't know."

Essential replied calmly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Was it trying to destroy the world using Uroboros, or did it sense its own defeat and try to make a last-ditch effort? I don't know which, but it didn't succeed. Even if it was the main body of God, it couldn't control Uroboros as it pleased, let alone a fragment.

Uroboros is a device that affects the entire universe. Even God couldn't easily touch it.

"But it's not a failure, is it?"

"Yeah, that's right."

Essential scowled and raised his hand.

"There's Uroboros inside."

It was distorted to the point where it couldn't be seen even with Taesan's vision, but there was something deep within the worthless being.

That was the main body of Uroboros.

"I don't know how it accessed the location of Uroboros' main body, but Uroboros detected the approach too late. It seems to have succeeded in self-defense, but the aftermath covered the universe."

And many beings in the universe, including Essential, were caught up in it.

"At the time, I could have escaped easily, but I realized I had to solve it and moved here immediately. It was stronger than I expected, and everyone except me was caught up in it."

Essential scowled, his expression overflowing with frustration and annoyance.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I cannot kill Gosin. Nor can I seal it away in this place. That's why I'm still fighting here."

"Is it not Gosin, but just a part of it that you can't handle?"

"If I were my original self, I could have crushed it and rendered its influence powerless. But it's impossible here."

Time is distorted, and space is broken. As I approach the true body of Uroboros, its influence grows enormous.

"Even if Uroboros doesn't bear a grudge against me, its mere presence affects me. I'm consuming considerable power and authority to resist it, and I'm in a significantly weakened state. That's why I can't deal with that damn part."

Not even a transcendent being can easily resist Uroboros' power. Uroboros is a greater concept, after all.

"But you seem to be unaffected by its influence."

A strange gaze falls upon Taesan. To be precise, it's the faint, ash-colored energy that envelops his entire body.

"Honestly, I don't know what kind of existence you are. You... have interfered with my power."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He didn't intervene in the authority of the Essential itself, so he wasn't affected by its attack. It was impossible even for the Transcendent, let alone the High Gods.

'Who are you?'

A pure question filled with curiosity.

Taesan replied.

'I don't know either.'

It was his true intention. He didn't know about himself either.

'I can control black.'

Ripple.

The power of the High God was realized on Taesan's hand. The Essential's eyes widened in quiet astonishment at the perfectly controlled black under Taesan's command.

'And I can control divinity.'

Kiying!

Golden light was also realized in Taesan's hand.

The divinity and black mixed, creating a grayish color.

'I can combine the two to create the power of the boundary.'

Taesan raised his finger.

Kagagak!

The boundary and the worthless being touched.

The power of the worthless being slowly approached, trying to erase Taesan's boundary and engulf him.

But it didn't happen.

The boundary wavered and twisted, but it firmly protected Taesan's body. Even when it came into contact with the worthless being's main body, its value did not disappear.

Taesan activated the chaos domain as it was."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Some part of the worthless being began to twist.

At that moment, a backlash covered the mountain.

It was a fierce enemy.

The quiet, sluggish power of the worthless being suddenly surged violently, like a wave, trying to engulf the mountain.

When Essential attacked, it didn't react much, but when the mountain attacked, it responded like a wounded beast. The mountain quickly created distance. The power of the worthless being spewed out anger and charged forward.

That was the essence of agony. It nullified the meaning of all things. Essential moved quickly, manifesting its power and pushing back the worthless being, creating distance.

"Thank you."

"You're......"

Essential gazed at the mountain with a dazed expression.

The mountain drew a boundary line.

"I can kill the agony."

The worthless being, which had moved Uroboros, could erase its own existence from the universe, rather than sealing it.

"But I also don't know why this is possible. What is mixed into my origin, I myself don't know."

What was twisted in him?

"You are the god of essence."

Essence."

Note: Uroboros is a mythological symbol of a snake eating its own tail, often representing cycles and self-destruction. In this context, it seems to be a powerful entity or force that the worthless being has moved or controlled.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the given Korean text to English:

"It is something that cannot exist without being itself.

The being that governs that concept.

The mountain asked quietly.

"Can you see my true nature?""
