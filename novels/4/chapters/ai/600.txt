Chapter 601

601. Extra Story, 1st Floor, Lee Tae-yeon (3)

It was a name she had never seen before.

But the word next to it caught her attention.

"Eezi?"

That wasn't all. People were enthusiastically chatting.

Among them, "Eezi" appeared the most, followed by "Normal" and "Hard" in that order.

The "Alone" mode was almost negligible, to the point where you wouldn't even notice it if you didn't focus.

She stared blankly at the chat window, then snapped out of it and hastily typed out a message.

[Lee Tae-yeon[Alone] : Everyone? Are you alive? Where are you all?] [Kim Min-soo[Eezi] : Uh.] [Kang Tae-san[Eezi] : Is that the Alone mode? How many people pressed that?] [Kang Jun-hyuk[Alone] : What's going on? Is it happening again?]

"Alone mode?"

After reading people's messages, she realized something.

There was a certain word behind her name.

[Lee Tae-yeon[Alone] : ……I want to hear the story.] [Kim Hwi-yeon[Hard] : Yes.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Soon, people started talking to her. When Lee Tae-yeon heard their stories, her eyes widened in surprise.

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Can we meet each other?] [Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: I've checked, and it seems that in each mode, people can meet each other. The town is going to be destroyed, but since there are too few people on earth, we're a bit scattered.]

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Then, where are the people from our mode? I didn't see anyone.]

With the hope of meeting someone, she quickly posted a message.

You can meet people. That hope filled her heart.

But after a moment of silence, despair set in.

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: Based on what I've found out so far, it's impossible for people in the Alone mode to meet each other.] [Kang Jun-hyeok [Alone]: I've searched the entire town, but I didn't see anyone except for that weird guy.] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Then...?] [Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: I don't know if there's a way for people in the Alone mode to meet each other... I didn't explain it well.] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: You didn't explain it?] [Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: It seems you didn't see it correctly. Let me explain it to you.]

Note: The text appears to be a conversation between characters in a game or novel, with different modes (Alone, Hard, etc.) and a storyline involving meeting other players or characters.

And the writing that came up was enough to drive her to despair.

[Easy Mode] [This is the easiest difficulty level. There is plenty to eat here, and the shelters that exist in the middle of the labyrinth will be a blessing to you. Even ordinary and weak people can clear it if they try hard enough.] [Normal Mode] [This is a normal difficulty level. There is a lack of food here, and the shelters that exist in the middle of the labyrinth are significantly fewer than in Easy Mode.] [Ordinary people will find it hard to survive, but if they have a spirit that doesn't give up even in despair, they can clear it.] [Hard Mode] [This is a difficulty level that tests your limits. There is an absolute lack of food here, and the shelters that exist in the middle of the labyrinth are very few. Monsters will willingly give up their lives to kill you, and if you don't secure maximum safety, you will lose your life in a horrific way.]

Lee Tae-yeon read the explanations for each mode carefully. Since she hadn't read it properly in the midst of destruction, it was new information to her.

And the mode she had settled on. The explanation for Alone Mode.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**[Alone Mode] [This is a mode where you are alone. You cannot meet anyone in your world. Here, you can only see monsters and those hostile to you, and NPCs.] [Luck, talent, wisdom, strategy. You cannot survive in this place where everything is tested. If your life is precious, do not choose this difficulty.]**

“Ah.”

Despair engulfed her.

**[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard] : I also... don't really understand. The explanation itself is like that.]**

There was no energy to respond to those words.

No one could be met.

She was alone here.

An incomprehensible, terrifying, and overwhelming fear finally took everything away from her. A piercing scream echoed.

* * *

Lee Tae-yeon lay motionless, her spirit gone.

She didn't want to do anything. Exactly, she couldn't do anything. The despair that engulfed her was enough to crush her mind.

No one could be met.

She would die in this hell.

So, all day, she did nothing. She wanted to forget everything.

But reality forced her back.

Rumble.

The sound rang out. Only then did she realize she was hungry.

“...Thinking about it, I haven't eaten anything.”

It had been almost two days since she had put anything in her mouth.

Even in this situation, her body was honest.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She let out a hollow laugh and lifted her upper body.

"Over there... Do you sell food too?"

"I don't."

The dwarf spoke indifferently.

"My children can't be sold, but simple consumables are available in abundance."

"Then..."

"Bring me money. Then I'll sell it to you."

"Money... how..."

"Don't you know even that much, you fool?"

Lee Tae-yeon shook her head. This place's system was like a game.

Then, how do you earn money?

The answer was simple. You had to catch monsters, those rats.

"Haha..."

Lee Tae-yeon let out a futile laugh. In the end, it was impossible. She could never beat the Big Rat.

The dwarf, who had been watching her for a moment, opened his mouth.

"I'll tell you one thing."

"Yes?"

"There's a Fountain of Life on the 1st floor. It's a spring that makes all your stats max out."

Lee Tae-yeon's eyes widened. The dwarf continued in a serious tone.

"As long as you don't leave the 1st floor, you can use it infinitely. I'll let you know the location."

Kyiiiing!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Information came to her. She knew that the Fountain of Life was not far away.

"Go ahead and get buried there. I don't care. It's noisy, so get out."

"What, are you going to die on the way?"

The dwarf didn't think that Lee Tae-yeon would make it to the Fountain of Life.

There were at least three big rats on the path, and possibly more than five. It was impossible for a coward like him to avoid the big rats' attacks and reach the Fountain of Life.

He thought he would die on the way. That was the dwarf's thought.

"……."

The Fountain of Life.

If you listen to the story, it's a fountain that can recover infinitely.

Then, this hunger would also be resolved.

"……."

Lee Tae-yeon's eyes slowly sank. She got up from her seat.

* * *

"Phew."

She stood in front of the door.

Beyond this was that terrifying monster. The pain and fear etched in her brain still lingered.

She didn't want to go forward.

She wanted to run away.

But.

Creak.

The door opened. The dwarf took a step forward. Lee Tae-yeon slowly advanced.

"I have to survive."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I can't just stay still like this. I can't just starve to death, so I have to move forward eventually.

'It's not possible to meet right now.'

There was no law that said I wouldn't meet someone even if I went deeper into the labyrinth. There must be a meeting place somewhere.

It will happen.

If I don't think that way, I'll go crazy from loneliness.

I take a deep breath.

'The dwarf and the broken man were disappointed in me.'

She seemed to despise me, clicking her tongue as if I was someone who didn't meet their expectations.

On the other hand, it meant that there was someone who could meet their expectations.

'It's not a place where clearing is impossible.'

I couldn't know the details, but it wasn't a normal place. It wasn't just made to kill them; it was just that the difficulty was too high.

'I'm not capable of meeting their expectations.'

She was a coward.

She didn't want to risk her life and fight back.

But for a coward, there's a way that's unique to cowards.

"Kiiiiik!"

[Big Rat appears.]

'...Hello?'"

Note: "Big Rat" is likely a character's name or a nickname, rather than a literal translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lee Tae-yeon forced a smile, but her lips were trembling. A rat the size of a cat was staring at her with beastly eyes.

"Keeeeeek."

Big Rat was extremely fast. It was impossible to react to its movements, and even if you tried to predict its attacks, it was very difficult to land a hit. Before she knew it, her health would be reduced to zero.

But it wasn't like that.

Thud.

Lee Tae-yeon stomped her foot and charged towards Big Rat at high speed.

"Keeeeek!"

Big Rat let out a sharp cry and dodged to the side.

And Lee Tae-yeon ignored Big Rat.

She sprinted through the narrow corridor.

It was then that Big Rat realized. Lee Tae-yeon had no intention of fighting it.

"Keeek!"

From that moment on, Big Rat had only one course of action.

Chase the loser. Bite its leg, claw at it, and inflict wounds.

The moment Big Rat bit into Lee Tae-yeon's leg.

"Huff!"

With a short cry, Lee Tae-yeon twisted her body. Big Rat's teeth snapped shut on empty air.

"I may not be able to counterattack, but I can dodge!"

With her current reaction speed and physical abilities, it was more than possible. She would continue to sprint forward. Big Rat continued to chase after her.

"Keeeeek!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The sound of wailing grows near. Lee Tae-yeon quickly turns her body and unsheathes her sword.

Ka-gak!

"Ka-ak!"

The sword hits the ground. That's enough. Big Rat is shocked and retreats, and in that moment, Lee Tae-yeon creates some distance again.

"Hoo! Hoo!"

Her breathing quickens. If she makes even a small mistake, she'll be bitten. And with her slowed movements, she can't dodge Big Rat's attacks.

She must be perfect, perfectly perfect.

Ta-dak!

She advances and advances.

And when she's almost reached her destination...

"Kee-ee-eek!"

[Big Rat appears.] [Big Rat appears.]

New monsters block her path.

Lee Tae-yeon's eyes waver.

[You are in a difficult situation.] [Confusion judgment in progress…….] [Fear judgment in progress…….]

She managed to dodge one of them somehow, but three is impossible. The Big Rats charge at Lee Tae-yeon from both sides.

"...No way!"

Lee Tae-yeon grits her teeth.

Those things are not her goal.

Her goal is the Fountain of Life, no matter what. The new obstacles that have appeared are just that - obstacles.

So, she doesn't waver.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Confusion Judgment Success: Medium] [Fear Judgment Success: Medium]

She stomps her foot and leaps into the air. The big rats also jump.

If she keeps going like this, she'll be bitten.

Lee Tae-yeon thrust her sword violently into the ground.

Kyaah!

With a rough recoil, Lee Tae-yeon's body slightly deviates from its trajectory.

"Keeek!"

"Kkak!"

The big rats collide with each other. Lee Tae-yeon quickly lands and leaps again, violently opening the door.

Quaang!

And then closes it. She takes a rough breath.

"Yes, I did it……."

She survived.

Her legs lose strength, and she collapses onto the floor.

[You have escaped from the attacks of numerous monsters and arrived at your destination. You have acquired the special skill [Escape].] [You have chosen to avoid combat and perfectly evaded the battle, acquiring the special skill [Combat Evasion].] [Your proficiency in the Path of Life has increased by 2%.] [You have discovered the Fountain of Life for the first time.] [First Discovery Bonus] [Your intelligence has permanently increased by 1, and your mana has permanently increased by 2.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This is a sanctuary of the labyrinth. Your enemy cannot enter this place of their own free will. The tranquility of this place will make you complacent."

Let me know if you have any further questions!
