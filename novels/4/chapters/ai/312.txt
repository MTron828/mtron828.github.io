Chapter 313

313. The Fifth Return, Earth (9)

They had won.

People were overjoyed and cheered. They hugged each other, celebrating their victory.

However, they couldn't just bask in the joy of their victory forever. Their win was not perfect, and there were many things that needed to be taken care of.

“…….”

Kim Hwi-yeon looked around with a stern face.

The bodies of the dead were scattered around, forming small hills.

“……Let's clean up.”

She said quietly. The others also put aside their joy of victory and started gathering the bodies.

Taesan also helped them.

There were many things that needed to be done besides cleaning up the bodies. They had to count the number of surviving players. They had to figure out how many players from each mode were still alive.

So, the players from each country naturally started talking to each other.

“Uh…….”

“Um, hello.”

The Chinese players exchanged awkward greetings.

They had faced each other countless times and had even worked together to overcome the Wave, but this was the first time they had spoken to each other.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Kim Hwi-yeon smiled and greeted them.

"Yes, hello."

The invisible wall that had formed between them began to disappear. Once they broke the ice, they enthusiastically shared stories.

However, there was someone who was extremely displeased with this fact.

"You! How dare you!"

Jin-ryong shouted harshly. The players who were quietly chatting trembled with fear.

"I told you not to talk to people from other countries! It will corrupt you!"

Jin-ryong's body trembled with rage.

A surge of power burst out and enveloped Jin-ryong.

"How dare you not listen to me!"

"Uh, uh..."

"Jin-ryong-nim..."

"This time, I'll be merciful and forgive you. But if you mix words with others just one more time, I'll kill you all!"

However, people only took a hesitant stance at Jin-ryong's shout, without bowing their heads to him. They just sent him a difficult gaze.

Jin-ryong's face twisted in anger at their attitude.

"How dare you!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The great being, the ruler, doesn't listen to his own words!

The power of the True Dragon began to surge. Despite the immense power's waves, people's faces turned pale, but they didn't follow the True Dragon's words.

People only glanced away.

"How dare you turn away while I'm speaking!"

The True Dragon also glared at people with a fierce gaze.

There, Taesan was watching him with an unwavering gaze.

The True Dragon, who was about to unleash his power to punish, trembled with fear.

His gaze towards Taesan was filled with terror.

"......Get out of my sight!"

In the end, the True Dragon couldn't unleash his power and shouted fiercely instead.

He restrained his power and retreated.

People's gaze towards Taesan grew even stronger.

The True Dragon, who was once the ruler of China, was no longer their leader.

The True Dragon had been worshipped by people because of his power, and he ruled over them with his power. Without power, he was a worthless existence.

But Taesan, a being far stronger than him, appeared. People no longer worshipped the True Dragon."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Jinryong also felt it, but he had already lost his influence and couldn't help but remain silent.

And it was slowly corrupting Jinryong.

And regardless of him, time was passing.

Kim Hwi-yeon, who was temporarily appointed as the representative, scrunched up his face as he organized the number of surviving players from China.

"What's going on? Why isn't the quest ending?"

"That's right. The return window isn't appearing."

Geum Jung-geun replied. The wave had ended. It seemed that this was the last one, as no new quests appeared afterwards.

But the window to return to the labyrinth didn't appear.

"Is this the end of everything?"

"There's no way that's possible. We haven't even cleared the labyrinth yet."

"Then why isn't anything coming out? It's making people anxious."

Kim Hwi-yeon grumbled. Taesan came out.

"Take a break."

"Ah, okay."

Taesan, who had come out, stomped his foot.

Taesan ascended to the heavens. The Chinese players who saw him bowed their bodies in reverence.

It was because they were originally people who were dominated by the existence known as Jinryong, and their worship was more fervent and deeper than that of the Korean and Japanese players."

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan, who had arrived in the world, opened his skill window.

[Divine Power] [Proficiency: 72%] [God's power. It originally had no meaning, but as many people's beliefs gathered, it became divine. People's beliefs and faith can have a significant impact on the world.]

After clearing the quest, the proficiency of his divine power increased rapidly.

It seemed possible to reach 100% within this return.

However, when the proficiency of his divine power reached 70%, the growth rate suddenly slowed down. While it's true that the higher the proficiency, the slower the growth rate, the divine power was abnormal even considering that.

"It's not just simple faith."

[If I reach 100%, I might be able to obtain complete divinity, but it's impossible with just a few million ordinary believers. Is it one of the ways to transcend mortality?]

Taesan closed his skill window and looked down at the world below.

He sensed numerous lives entering his perception.

There was also the True Dragon, who possessed the power of immortality.

"What should I do with that guy?"

The True Dragon, who was once the ruler of China and a slave to immortality.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's been a long time since the Wave started, and the rules of combat became obsolete. He could have killed Jinryong at any time.

But he didn't. Jinryong had power, and although he was an oppressive ruler, he was still the ruler of China. If Taesan had killed him carelessly, it could have led to even greater chaos, so he let Jinryong be.

Of course, Jinryong had lost the trust and faith of the people. There wouldn't be any players who would rebel against Taesan if he killed Jinryong now.

But even so, Taesan couldn't kill Jinryong.

"Wouldn't you try to kill me if I touched you?"

[That's right.]

Jinryong was an immortal's possession.

The immortal had a desire, and that's why they made Jinryong their slave. If Taesan had touched Jinryong, the immortal would have seen him as an enemy.

[A beast that craves life is a unique immortal among immortals. It doesn't seek transcendence, nor does it envy mortals who have the possibility of transcendence. It just wants to satisfy its hunger.]

The ghost continued to speak.

[Even if you're not targeting me, if there's someone who gets in the way of your desires, you'll devour them, even if they're a transcendent being.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A starving beast only cares about satiating its hunger, nothing else.

To the immortal, conflicts and divine oppositions are of no interest whatsoever.

There is no need to make the immortal an enemy. That's why Taesan didn't kill Jinryong.

And the quest is not over yet.

Gosin is clearly aiming for something.

Now is the time to wait until Gosin makes a move.

* * *

Everyone shouted Taesan's name.

Jinryong's existence was completely forgotten by people. He, who was once revered by all Chinese, was abandoned just like that.

Jinryong gazed at people with a stern face.

Even though he was right next to them, they didn't even spare him a glance.

"How dare they..."

Who was it that protected them until now, and yet these ungrateful wretches!

Emotions swirled. The people around him trembled and took a step back. It was only then that they noticed Jinryong's presence and retreated in a hurry.

"Ah..."

There was no faith or devotion on their faces. They just looked like they wanted to escape from him.

The enraged Jinryong was about to devour them.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

“…….”

But Jinryong had no choice but to leave silently.

It was terrifying. Taesan's power made him look like an insect. He knew that if he carelessly provoked them, he would be crushed like a bug.

Jinryong was feeling the same emotions that others had felt when they saw him.

In the end, Jinryong, who couldn't do anything, returned to his humble abode in the sky.

No one worshipped him.

He wanted to kill everyone, but Taesan's existence prevented him from doing so.

Jinryong clenched his fists in frustration, feeling powerless.

This couldn't go on. This was wrong.

He had to receive people's worship. People had to follow him.

"It's wrong. This is."

A gloomy voice flowed out.

The mixed power began to occupy his brain.

The skill he obtained by making a contract with a beast that craved life. Life Devouring. Its effect was to take the life force of others, giving him the power he possessed.

Even if that power exceeded the user's capacity to handle it.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Jinryong's power is not that great. However, he has been continuously receiving power beyond his limits by using the power of life theft.

The unbalanced and mixed power has been damaging his mind for a long time.

Jinryong has been enduring that distorted mind with the worship of people alone.

But now, their worship has disappeared.

Jinryong has completely lost his mind.

He let out a mad laugh.

"It's not over yet."

Jinryong suddenly stood up, roughly tearing open the tent and shouting towards the sky.

"Oh great god! My master, the great beast that devours all things!"

He cried out with bloodshot eyes.

"Please grant me even greater power! Allow me to become your servant!"

It was a call.

The only cry allowed to the slave of the immortal, calling out to his master.

Jinryong shouted roughly.

"In return, I will offer all players in China to you!"

They no longer worship him.

They are no longer the targets he needs to protect."

Note: "Jinryong" is a Korean name, and it's not clear what it means in this context. It's possible that it's a title or a nickname, but without more context, it's difficult to say for sure.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Then, even if he sacrifices them, they cannot complain. After all, it's their own lives they're saving. Who can dare to say anything if they're using it for themselves?

The twisted thoughts unfold, and the heavens open up.

The great one begins to exercise their presence, responding to the call of the slave. The people under the heavens turn their gaze, feeling a thrilling sensation.

"Oh, oh, oh!"

Jinryong's trembling eyes shake his body. The great one has arrived! The one who can make even the mighty Taesan mountain look like an insect!

The space expands, and it reveals its form.

Beyond the swaying darkness, the beast's roar is heard.

"Oh, God!"

Jinryong kneels down and cries out.

"Please give me the power! The power to encompass the world and trample that vile one!"

The beast in the darkness, quietly gazing at Jinryong, begins to approach him with its power.

"Oh, oh!"

Jinryong's body shakes with joy.

He receives the power. The power to see even the mighty Taesan mountain as an insect!

A sense of excitement is felt on his back.

Jinryong turns around, laughing gleefully. Taesan is sending him a cold gaze.

"Hahaha! Look! You pitiful existence! I will reach an even higher place!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He proudly shouted and ridiculed the Great Mountain.

But the Great Mountain didn't even spare him a glance.

His gaze was fixed solely on the beast beyond.

Ka-ruck.

The beast laughed.

The power reached Jinryong, and he trembled with great excitement.

"Oh... I, I..."

He was becoming greater.

It was the moment when Jinryong was about to succumb to the power.

The power that had reached him was slowly devouring him. The energy contained within was different from what he had expected.

It was a robbery.

The Great Mountain watched him indifferently.

"As expected."

When an immortal being tries to intervene in the mortal world, various restrictions follow. It's difficult for a beast craving life to achieve its desired prey.

So, they enslave the immortal being.

They make a contract with the slave, granting them the power to devour life. It doesn't matter if the slave is consumed by that power. The slave's only task is to devour many lives and fill the beast's belly.

To the beast craving life, Jinryong was nothing more or less.

"Wait, just for a moment."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Only then did Jinryong realize the truth, but he tried to back away in a fluster, only to be firmly grasped by the beast's power.

Jinryong's face turned pale with fear as he shouted.

"Don't do it!"

The beast quietly devoured Jinryong, taking in his life force. The power he had built up as he descended into the labyrinth was all being consumed by the beast.

Everything was being taken away from him, and he was about to disappear.

"Aaaaah!"

Jinryong wailed. This couldn't be happening.

The one who had once been the master of China itself was now being reduced to nothing.

Despair and fear overwhelmed him. His already distorted mind was crumbling further, making it impossible to call him human anymore.

That was when it reached Jinryong.

"What?"

Even as everything was being taken away from him, Jinryong's body trembled for a moment. Pure darkness began to seep into his inner self.

It asked him. Did he want power?

Jinryong couldn't bring himself to answer.

No matter how dire the situation, he couldn't bring himself to say it. Pure fear had taken hold of him, and the moment he accepted it, he felt like he would cease to exist.

But he was already broken.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When the self collapses and reason ceases to exist, Jinryong unknowingly answers the question.

Ku-u-ung!

At that moment, a massive force strikes the beast that was about to devour Jinryong. The beast that was repelled lets out a fierce roar. The roar that shakes the world and destroys everything echoes with immense power.

Quadduk.

But it's crushed.

The immortal's power, which had become worthless, distorts and disappears. The beast, which had its prey taken away, is driven out with a cry of despair.

Taesan, who witnessed this, stomped his foot.

[You have activated acceleration.] [You have activated skill acceleration.]

Using all sorts of skills, Taesan charges towards Jinryong. Just as Taesan's sword is about to pierce Jinryong's neck...

Quadduk.

A massive dark curtain blocks Taesan's sword. Taesan clicks his tongue and retreats.

"I guess it won't work."

"Eok, eok."

Jinryong's entire body begins to twist. Taesan readies his sword.

Jinryong was a slave to the immortal. He was already a twisted and broken existence.

If Goshin is aiming for something, Taesan thought it would be Jinryong, and indeed it was."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, I was trying to take advantage of the gap between the immortal and the high priest to kill him, but I didn't expect the high priest to have the power to chase the immortal away in an instant.

"Ugh..."

Jinryong's body starts to contort even more. He no longer resembles a human, and his sense of self is also nowhere to be seen.

[OOOOOO!]

A scream shakes the world.

A system window appears, facing the collapsing body.

[Special Quest Started] [Defeat the Monster] [A twisted creature that is no longer alive has appeared.]"
