Article 197

197. The Earth on the Brink of Annihilation (2)

"What... it's hard to put into words... something's different."

She murmured to herself with an ambiguous expression.

Lee Taeyeon was a master of solo mode. She was not lacking in observational skills or judgment. She asked with sharp eyes.

"Taesan, show me the status window."

"I'm sorry, but that's impossible."

"What's the point?"

Lee Taeyeon was taken aback. There was no reason for Taesan not to show her the status window.

"There is a reason for that."

However, as a Taesan whose stats had changed, she couldn't show it.

"Even if it's not important, it's not like it's going to cause harm, so you don't have to worry."

Taesan's response caused Lee Taeyeon to gaze at her quietly. Several lights flickered in her eyes.

"...Right?"

"That's right."

"I understand. Then it's settled."

Lee Taeyeon didn't ask any further questions. It seemed like she had already guessed something.

"Then let's get to the point."

She said with a calm expression.

"The next wave is about to start."

Taesan nodded her head.
Here is the translation of the text:

The monsters launched a full-scale attack in the wave. Every time they returned to Earth, the wave occurred.

After their last return, the first wave took away Seoul from humanity.

In the second wave, half of the hard players died.

In the third wave, humanity was unable to defend even a small city.

Now it was the fourth wave. And at this time, humanity was wiped out.

The Taesan recalled what he had said that time.

"How many are there?"

"There are two S-rank, several dozen A-rank, several hundred B-rank, and some divine beings."

Itealyeon said calmly.

It was definitely the monsters that had ended everything. In fact, they had all died in the previous life after losing to the divine beings.

In reality, defeat was already certain.

However, Taesan did not intend to be defeated.

"I'll take on the two S-rank monsters. Can I entrust the divine beings to you a little? I'll finish it quickly and come to your aid."

"What?"

Itealyeon's eyes trembled.

"What are you saying? It's not just one S-rank, it's two. No matter how you are, it's......"

"There's no one else to rely on, anyway?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan's words made Taeyeon shut her mouth.

As Taesan said, it was S-Grade and Sado. Only Taesan and herself could confront those monsters. Therefore, she had to entrust either Sado or the S-Grade, and one of them had to be done.

Taesan was summoned for that purpose, but Taeyeon was taken aback.

"...I'll accept it unexpectedly."

Taesan had always complained about every choice she made. Although she didn't refuse everything, she thought she would complain a little this time as well.

"It's too late to complain now."

Taesan shrugged her shoulders, and Taeyeon looked at her with a confused gaze.

"It's definitely changed."

"Really?"

Taesan smiled and sat down.

"Well, let's talk for a change after a long time."

"...What is it?"

"Just some casual conversation. About the solo mode you were in, for example."

* * *

In a previous life, Taeyeon had talked to him about solo mode. She talked about what was on this floor and what items she got.
Here is the translation of the text:

At the time, Taesan was in "ijje" mode, so he mostly ignored all the conversations. However, he was now in "eoreon" mode and thought about having a conversation again to clarify some information.

Yeatran laughed with a sly smile.

"Why did you get so annoyed and say you didn't want to listen? What's changed?"

"I just think it's over, so I might as well let you in on this too."

"It's fine. I didn't have anyone else to talk to, so I was getting frustrated."

She started talking about "eoreon" mode, one by one. Her expression was very bright, as if it was a rare story.

"And the 45th floor. There's a special room there."

"Special?"

"Yes. It's something that can't be obtained through normal means. So, there's..."

Taesan's eyes widened as he listened to her continuous talk.

"And in 'eoreon' mode, the difficulty level suddenly increases at a certain floor. Did you experience something similar?"

"Yes, we did. The difficulty level changed every 51st and 71st floor."

"That's right. But 'eoreon' mode was much worse."

Yeatran shivered her body.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I almost died, you know. And the 51st floor was very unique, so I really risked my life to get there. Ah, but it was good. There was a hidden room on the 51st floor, and it was quite unique, so I got something good from there."

What can be obtained and what lies ahead?

I put each one into my mind.

Then, a small story continued. Taeyeon smiled with a strange expression, as if she were surprised.

"Something is going well. It didn't work at all until now. It's surprising."

Taesan also entered a solo mode because of her, but she didn't know. Taesan smiled silently.

We talked for a while like that.

And it ended.

"So, then... time is up."

Taeyeon clenched her fist. Her body was trembling slightly.

Taesan looked at her and opened her mouth.

"What are you...?"

Why didn't you go back to the past?

Why did you die with it in your hand?

She was about to ask, but Taesan shook her head.

"Let's live."

It's not the time to ask now. Everything has ended, and we should ask later.

"Yeah."

Taeyeon smiled faintly.

* * *

"Ah, really."

Jung-geun looked at the wall with a confused face, his eyes fixed on something beyond.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I knew this day would come, but this is too dirty and disgusting, you know."

The end was basically confirmed. All sorts of screams and wails were echoing through the city.

Ichiang's gaze appeared before him.

His face was pale and exhausted, but he still held his weapon firmly.

"It's surprisingly intact. I'm not surprised that he's not dead yet. Sigh. I have to accept it too. After all, we've been living for a long time in a situation where everyone is dying. This is a miracle. A miracle."

"What's the point of being a miracle when it's all falling apart?"

He takes a moment to think, holding his breath.

And then the monster's cry is heard.

It was the start of the wave.

"Whoa, it's going to be tough. Really. What should I do, I asked?"

"S-grade two."

"...See you in the afterlife. I think I'll go first. Please wait for me."

"Don't worry."

Tai-san patted him on the back and gave him a boost of energy.

"I'm not going anywhere, so don't bother."

Kuuuung!

The body accelerates.

Here is the translation of the text:

Unlike before, since there was no sudden leap or complete reconnaissance, it was impossible to grasp the location. But it didn't matter. Even now, I still remembered exactly where the monsters were.

As I rushed forward, I encountered the monsters.

[Monster 5 appeared.] [Monster 7 appeared.]

"Hello."

I saw a monster like a jellyfish, with a body as big as a house, waving its tentacles in the air like an octopus. It was a terrifying sight.

"This is amazing. It's really something."

I had fought to the death against monsters before, and now I was facing them again.

The monsters gazed at Taesan.

[Monster 5 glared at you.] [Monster 7 glared at you.] [You've seen the horrific things and your heart is racing.] [Judgment starts.] [Judgment is in progress...] [Confusion is in progress...] [Fear is in progress...] [Death is in progress...] [. . .] [Judgment successful!] [You have activated reconnaissance.] [Monster 7] [HP: 325,842/325,842] [Monster 5] [HP: 105,212/105,212]

Taesan's eyes were glazed over.

The monsters were much weaker than they were in the previous life.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was not difficult to guess the reason. The god of despair was going to unleash a strengthened trial on him, and he was bewildered. It was as if things were completely different from what he had expected.

Perhaps the god of despair had become entangled with his fate. The monsters were born with the power of the gods, and it was possible that they had not fully realized their potential due to the power of the god of despair.

"What's good."

The corner of Taesan's mouth rose. At this moment, the monsters' strength was weakening, similar to Taesan's. This way, he could definitely determine the difference between his past life and his current life.

The monster's tentacles moved. Taesan's foot landed on the green beam of light.

Ku-ku-ku-gung...

The light melted the horizon.

Taesan calmly analyzed the situation.

'I can dodge it.'

Although there was no acceleration of physical time, he was able to dodge the monster's attack without effort.

Taesan charged at the monster. The monster's tentacles moved, and green beams shot towards Taesan.

Taesan stepped on the light as it approached.

Ki-ki-ki!

The lights narrowly passed by Taesan.

In his past life, it was impossible to avoid the light, so he had to use his intuition to dodge it beforehand.
Here is the translation of the text:

But now, even if the light is shot and I move, it's possible to dodge. It was an opportunity made possible by the increased stats.

Blame.

Tai Shan arrived right in front of the monster.

It was in a state where no attack nullification was used.

Kuoooong!

A defense-specialized monster 7 appears in front of Tai Shan, covering its body. Tai Shan draws its sword, pointing it at monster 5.

[You have forced a duel. For the next 12 seconds, you cannot take damage from anyone except monster 5.]

I ignore the defense-specialized monster and attack the attack-specialized monster first.

In previous lives, I didn't have enough mana to use the forced duel, so I had to process one first.

But now it's different. I've used the forced duel several dozen times without any problems, so I don't need to process the defense one first.

Kyiiing!

I dodge the shot beam and stab it with my sword.

[Dealt 3043 damage to monster 5.]

There is no multiplication. There is no copying, and there is no initial skill reset.

However, there was an increased basic attack power. It's not a difficult task to devour the body of a 10,000-strength creature.

[You have activated the white rune shield.]
Here is the translation of the text:

A small rune shield floats around Tai Shan. The beam of Chi Su hits the shield and is blocked. But not for long, and the shield will soon be destroyed. Tai Shan still has enough time to dodge.

Tai Shan couldn't help but smile.

I knew many things had changed, but after fighting monsters from previous lives, I was even more confident.

In previous battles, I would use the invalidation of attacks to approach and multiply and copy. If I could defeat the enemy, I would win.

But if I couldn't defeat them, it would be an endless disadvantageous fight.

On the other hand, this time was much more stable.

With higher stats, I could easily dodge the enemy's attacks and slowly but surely take them down.

[You have activated Frost Arrow.]

The arrows pierce the monster.

I can use my skills freely without worrying about mana.

Ki-ing!

I ignore the incoming beams and insert my sword into the enemy's body, one after another. The invalidation of attacks is completely exhausted.

[You take 18,543 damage.]

Only a small amount of damage.

But the shield did not activate. Tai Shan's vitality is still too high. There are still thousands of vitality left.
Here is the translation:

Taisan quickly repelled the monster and took a vitality potion. He recovered all his vitality and charged at it again.

At that moment, he was not yet at his strongest.

He was still stronger than he was now, in his previous life.

However, he had obtained powers from a completely different direction.

And if he could also obtain the power from his previous life, he would truly become perfect.

Taisan fiercely attacked the monster.
