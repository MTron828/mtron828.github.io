Chapter 378

378. The 78th Floor, the Library of the Omniscient (3)

What is an immortal? What is a transcendent? How do people's beliefs come about?

The Library of the Omniscient also had information about that.

Most of the information was not different from what the ghost had heard, but the ghost had not fully acquired the information here.

That's because the ghost was not very interested in beliefs or transcendence.

The ghost's concern was only about the sword and saving the destroyed world.

Therefore, there were a few uncertain things among the information the ghost knew.

"Hmm."

Taesan closed the book. He searched the library and read books written about faith and transcendence. Thanks to that, he was able to reconfirm what he already knew or fill in the gaps.

And he was able to obtain even more detailed information.

"Immortality and Transcendence. A Study of the Two States."

It was a book filled with complex and dense information, but it was very detailed.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The term 'Transcendent' refers to those who have obtained their own divine name and possess their own domain. They are sometimes called gods. On the other hand, 'Immortals' are those who do not possess their own divine name. They do not have a domain to govern. While they may have risen to the position of Immortal through sheer power, from a universal perspective, they do not have a significant impact.

It is possible for an Immortal to become a Transcendent, but most of them become incomplete Transcendents after obtaining faith. The cases of Immortals obtaining their own domain and becoming complete Transcendents are rare in the entire universe.

The difference between Immortals and Transcendents lies in whether they have a domain to govern. This was what the spirit said. However, what followed was new information.

It is also possible to gather people's faith and surpass the mortal realm. However, this is unstable and limited.

Taesan had experienced this before. He received the worship of all people and surpassed the mortal realm.

Depending on the quality and quantity of worship, it is also possible to reach the realm of Transcendents. The world one governs can also be seen as a kind of domain.

"This might be the path the Green Witch was looking for."

The Green Witch wanted to become a Transcendent.

People's faith.

This might be one of the methods she desired.

As I thought this, a voice echoed in my mind.

"That's not it, kid."

A soft and gentle voice.

Taesan, who had momentarily paused, realized who the owner of the voice was.

"Green Witch."

"I remember."

A laughter was heard. Taesan returned his gaze to the book.

"Could you have said something like that?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Simple conversations are possible. I was just going to observe, but I saw the need to correct your thoughts, so I spoke up.]

The witch continued in a gentle tone.

[What you think is correct. If you receive a certain level of faith, you can temporarily reach a transcendent state. But, child, haven't you experienced it? The position you've reached is extremely precarious.]

"I know."

When Taesan said he was leaving, people were devastated.

And at the moment that emotion burst forth, a strong burden was placed on Taesan. For an instant, Taesan's dignity was shaken.

[You can transcend with faith, but it's not a stable position. Humans are all destined to die, and faith is the same. As generations pass, faith grows weaker, and eventually loses its power. That's not the kind of position I desire.]

The witch spoke in a low, passionate tone.

[A solitary, unwavering, and unshakeable position, where one receives their own divine mandate, and no one can interfere, no matter the situation, and shines eternally, unaffected by time... That's the kind of position I desire.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is that so."

Thinking about it, it was unlikely that she, an immortal, would not know about faith. What she desired was a place higher than the unstable position created by faith.

"I'm sorry to say this."

[No, it's not like that. But now, I see hope that's different from before.]

The witch spoke in a bright tone.

[You're really amazing. Although it's temporary, you've reached the same level as me. And you did it in such a short time.]

The witch had met Taesan not long ago.

Taesan had reached the boundary and surpassed mortality in the meantime.

It was an incomprehensible growth rate. Many strong individuals spent their entire lives without being able to surpass the boundary. The Emperor's obsession with the divine blood was also due to the difficulty of surpassing the boundary.

[If it's you, maybe...].

Of course, it's still a distant story.

As someone who had risen to a position through faith, she was not a complete immortal, and the transcendent position was even farther away.

But the possibility was sufficient.

[I'll continue to watch over you. I'll cheer you on. Keep going.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

With that voice, the green witch disappeared.

The ghost let out a late sigh.

[Wow, this is tough.]

"Why is that?"

[Isn't the existence of an immortal being something that's not easily accepted? You're the weird one.]

The ghost grumbled, seemingly exhausted from protecting itself from the green witch's presence.

Taesan continued to read information about gods and immortals.

Overall, it wasn't much different from what the transcenders had told Taesan. The ghost muttered with a tired face, piling up knowledge.

[Isn't it overwhelming? I'm having a hard time reading this.]

The ghost wasn't interested in gods or immortals, and it also couldn't read about them.

Every time it read books about gods and immortals, it felt like its mind was burdened with the thought that it wasn't qualified to receive such information.

But Taesan didn't show any signs of that.

"There's nothing like that."

Taesan didn't feel any mental burden. Taesan read the books calmly, and the ghost clicked its tongue.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Just as I was about to tidy up, a phrase caught my eye in the vast mountain of texts.

[The transcendent being governs a realm that matches their divine name, and no one can intervene in that realm.]

According to what's written in this book, a transcendent being who possesses a realm is unaffected by anything. Even Taesan, who had traveled back in time, couldn't escape the gaze of the gods.

But what was really interesting was the content that followed.

[However, even for gods, it's almost impossible to interfere with time and influence its flow. The time they can intervene in is limited and localized.]

'Is it impossible to interfere with time?'

But the Oracle's stone had sent Taesan back in time.

'How did you get this?'

Lee Taeyeon had also hidden information about the stone, so Taesan didn't know how she had obtained it.

It was newly intriguing, but it was impossible to know without the help of a god.

Taesan stood up from his seat.

[What's going on? Are you done already?]

"Ha."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

There were still many things that were unclear. But since there was no hurry, there was no need to hastily accumulate knowledge. For now, I thought it was better to organize my thoughts first.

Taesan knew a lot about the 78th floor.

"My beloved goddess, the place where Lebinafov is located."

Ainzharu wondered if he had finally found his goddess.

The possibility was high, but he couldn't be certain. It was because of the place where the goddess was located.

The place where Lebinafov was located was the 24th secret room.

In other words, it meant that there were more than 24 secret rooms in this place.

"There are an enormous number of secret rooms on this floor."

Taesan returned to where Horhe was, and Horhe opened his mouth without taking his eyes off the book.

"Did you find the book?"

"It's here."

Taesan handed him a book. It was a book he had picked up on his way back.

Horhe glanced at him and then turned his attention back to the book.

"This is a book I've already read. Bring me a different one."

"Okay."

Taesan moved his body, but he didn't go far. He searched through the nearby bookshelves, touching the books.

Horhe's face scrunched up in annoyance at the sight.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Just in case, I won't say it. I've read all the books around here. It's not a level that aims for a change of mind, so let's throw away useless thoughts."

Jorge must have read most of the books in the library. However, there were many cases where he brought books from nearby, targeting the dark areas under the lamp.

The labyrinth required a tremendous amount of ability, and there was a level that demanded a change of mind, but Jorge denied that possibility.

It's pointless to look around here anymore, but Taesan continued to circle around Jorge.

Jorge clicked his tongue and lost interest.

Taesan, who had been flipping through the bookshelf for a while, asked Jorge.

"There's a lot of information here, but there's no specific information about gods and demons."

There were explanations about the terrain and power, but no detailed descriptions about the gods. In other words, what kind of existence was the demon king? What kind of power did the goddess of choice, Maria, wield? There was no detailed explanation about demons.

This is the library of all knowledge. The god of knowledge knows all the information that exists here.

However, the fact that it's not visible means one of two things.

Either Taesan hasn't discovered it yet.

Or it's sealed away somewhere deep inside, which means it's hidden.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What's the information you're curious about?"

Horhe scrunched up his face.

"There's a lot of knowledge here, but... there's also knowledge that's clearly inaccessible to those who aren't qualified."

Taesan's desired information about the gods and the divine was also one of them.

And there were also books that even Horhe couldn't access, for the same reason.

"If you want to obtain that knowledge, prove your qualifications. And find it yourself. That's what Metis-nim intends."

If you want knowledge, show the corresponding ability.

Taesan thought so.

"Found it."

Taesan muttered to himself, putting the book deep into the bookshelf.

Rumble!

The bookshelf shook.

With a loud noise, the bookshelf slowly started moving, creating an empty space.

[Huh?]

"......what?"

Both the ghost and Horhe turned their gaze in surprise.

Beyond the space, a passageway was visible.

[You have discovered the first secret room.] [First Discovery Bonus] [HP + 500] [MP + 300] [Magic + 50] [What? There was a secret room on this floor?]

"I didn't know?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Of course, I didn't know. Since nothing came out even with reconnaissance, I thought it didn't exist here…….]

The ghost didn't know that there was a secret room on the 78th floor. His shock was immense.

"[How on earth…….]

"There's something I've heard."

Lee Tae-yeon had stayed on the 78th floor for a long time.

During that time, she had told many trivial and uninteresting stories.

From the beginning, it was a mystery how Taesan, who was in easy mode, knew that the room with Levienov was the 24th secret room. The reason was simple.

While staying in the library of the heavens, Lee Tae-yeon had discovered over 24 secret rooms and shared that information with the community."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
