**Chapter 581**

581. The Thing Beyond (3)

The beast of the boundary is completely liberated.

It bursts out of the narrow tunnel, revealing its true self.

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung!

The beast of the boundary shakes the very foundation of the realm. The thing beyond tries to crush the boundary. The realm trembles and tramples.

But it's impossible.

The beast of the boundary lets out a loud roar, asserting its dominance over its realm.

Ku-u-u-ung!

The realms collide and clash. Neither side backs down easily.

"You're bigger and stronger, that's true," Taesan muttered.

"But my boundary isn't weak either."

The boundary is the universe and the thing beyond. It's something that exists between them.

Even if the opponent has a realm that's superior to the universe, the fact that they're at a disadvantage doesn't change.

Qua-d-d-d-d!

The beast of the boundary slowly expands its territory, as if it's enjoying its true liberation.

But soon, it hits a limit.

The beast of the boundary can no longer expand its territory at some point.

"I guess that's how it is."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There is a clear limit. It wasn't an opponent that could be easily defeated just because it had broken free from its true boundaries.

But it doesn't matter.

From the start, what he wanted wasn't victory.

'I wish.'

Authority. The effect of a distorted wish.

Just once, he can fulfill his wish.

No matter what it is.

Taesan revealed his wish.

'You will never be able to intervene in the universe again, and you will be trapped here forever.'

Of course, even the smallest interference would be impossible, and the universe would be unaffected.

The wish is revealed.

The authority is activated to fulfill it.

Kukukuku...

The beast of the boundary moves. It, which has a self, inflates its body according to Taesan's wish.

Rumble.

It spreads thinly and widely, like a membrane, covering the domain of the universe.

And it begins to separate.

The domain of the universe and the universe itself.

Kukukuku!

The moment he realized that, the other side became enraged. The domain itself moved, striking the beast of the boundary. It was a futile resistance, like a child who had its toy taken away.

'Do you dislike this?'

Taesan laughed."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But it doesn't matter. I'll get what I want anyway."

No matter what you do, it's meaningless to the universe. It's like when you used to play with the universe in the past.

*Crackle*

The boundary is expanding wider and wider. You try to stop it, but it's impossible.

The beast of the boundary is originally equal to me. Even my broken hopes are activated. What I wish for will surely come true.

*Rustle* *Rustle*

The beast that's expanding is slowly separating us.

And finally...

The beast of the boundary has perfectly separated the universe and the realm of the gods.

"It's over."

*Kukuku*

You're enraged to the point where you can't get any angrier. The realm itself is starting to distort into a strange shape.

Taesan looks at the scene with indifference.

"It was nice meeting you."

Taesan bows his head respectfully, like a gentleman.

"And farewell. We won't meet again."

Taesan crosses over to the other side of the expanded boundary.

You unleash your full power. The realm itself moves, and it strikes Taesan.

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, Taesan had already crossed the boundary.

The power of the unfolded boundary and the thing beyond it collided.

Kuuuuuuung!

The boundary trembled.

But that was all.

The boundary firmly defended its position.

Tsk.

And Taesan arrived in the universe.

There, numerous transcenders were waiting for him.

Gazes filled with awe.

Taesan spoke calmly.

"It's over."

* * *

Taesan took a sip of tea. In front of him were Arirnan, the magician, and Lakiratas.

"So... how did you do it?"

"I separated the universe and the realm of the gods using the boundary beast."

[That's understandable, but how did you do it.]

"It's not a big deal. I just blocked the entire concept of crossing over."

The realm is vast, and it's impossible for even Taesan to cover the entire area.

However, the gods can make small interventions by using concepts that don't involve crossing over through space.

So, if he blocked that concept, it would be enough.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was wrapped like a thin membrane. Like water and oil that cannot mix, I created such a layer."

[Is that possible?]

"If it's a boundary, it's possible."

From the beginning, if there's a boundary in the middle, it can definitely play its role.

Above all, the boundary was born due to circulation, and it became life.

Even if cracks appear on the boundary, the boundary's beast itself will restore it.

"I'll try to break it in various ways, but it will be meaningless."

The thing beyond is the realm itself.

It can no longer become stronger or weaker; that's the limit.

Then, there was no way to deal with the boundary's beast. It's not about attacking or devouring the thing beyond, but simply existing there. The power to trample the boundary in that state didn't exist for the thing beyond.

"At least as long as I don't disappear, they won't be able to intervene in the universe again."

"What does that mean……."

"It's over. Everything."

Taesan said calmly.

* * *

Taesan returned to Earth.

The people on Earth were simply rejoicing.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No one knows what Taesan did. They were enjoying their victory without knowing anything.

The only one who knew the truth was Itaeyeon.

"Is it over?"

Taesan nodded his head.

Everything was over.

In a perfect sense.

Itaeyeon laughed.

"You've worked hard, Taesan."

* * *

Taesan, who had been wandering around the earth, returned to the labyrinth.

A space where no one existed, only he was alone.

No, he wasn't completely alone. Bardley and Akasha were there.

But the two had become so familiar to Taesan that it felt like he was alone.

Taesan gazed up at the ceiling with a vacant expression.

Everything was over.

He felt a sense of exhaustion. It was like a horse that had run hard and finally reached the finish line, feeling like it was about to collapse.

Taesan closed his eyes.

If he fell asleep now, he could sleep without worrying about anything for the first time in this life.

But.

Taesan opened his eyes.

"There's one last thing I need to do."

He got up from his seat, looked up at the empty space, and opened his mouth.

"I can do it with you."

Chaos erupted.

The space split open, and a woman appeared.

She was the green witch."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She bowed her head respectfully in front of Taesan.

"Congratulations. You've reached the end of everything."

"Do you know too?"

"I am the one who has taken root in the labyrinth. The wizard himself told me."

The green witch remained bowed, unmoving.

Taesan realized something from her attitude.

"Have you decided?"

"......Yes."

The green witch's wish was to become a transcendent being.

She wanted to dominate the concept of being alone and unparalleled.

But she was immortal. She had reached that point and continued to strive, but she couldn't become a transcendent being.

The reason was simple.

From the beginning, what she had built was designed to be unable to reach the level of a transcendent being.

As long as she didn't solve that problem, she could never become a transcendent being.

The problem was that it was impossible to abandon what she had built herself.

Taesan was special, but if she were to abandon herself, she would be overwhelmed by a terrible sense of despair at that moment.

It was a feeling that was literally deadly.

She couldn't do it herself.

But Taesan could.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If he had the power, he could have taken away what the Green Witch had built.

"Will it be okay?"

But in the end, he had to abandon everything. The Green Witch nodded her head.

"Yes. I've decided. I'll abandon myself."

"If you've decided that."

Taesan placed his hand on the Green Witch's head.

Her body was trembling.

Fear of abandoning everything she had built, anxiety, and worry.

But she didn't back down.

She entrusted her body to Taesan's hand.

The authority was activated.

[You have activated the Soul Domination.]

Everything the Green Witch had built was taken away by Taesan. The Green Witch let out an unconscious sigh.

"Ah……."

Crackle.

Everything she had desperately built was taken away. The Green Witch's body trembled.

Ku ku ku ku….

And soon, everything became Taesan's possession.

[You have acquired the Soul Skill [World's Intervention].]

"Ah."

The Green Witch collapsed. Taesan caught her falling body.

"Thank you……."

"How do you feel."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

“……It’s not good.”

The green witch stumbled and got up.

For a moment, she gazed at my hand, and then she smiled wryly.

“It’s been a long time……since I felt this way.”

She had now become an ordinary human.

The immense power that could move mountains, divide the sea, and open the sky had vanished without a trace. The current her was a weak woman who couldn’t even break a single branch.

She had lost everything.

“But…….”

The green witch clenched her fist.

“Thank you sincerely. You are a great person.”

“There’s nothing to thank me for.”

On the contrary, I had done the worst thing to her.

“What should I do now?”

“Let’s find the right way for now.”

A way to become a transcendent being.

“To do that, I might as well become an adventurer.”

The green witch smiled faintly.

“I’ll go on a journey again. Someday……I hope to meet you again with my own power.”

“I’ll wait.”

The green witch left.

For a moment, Taesan gazed at her back and muttered.

“Is this what you wanted too?”
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not like that from my perspective."

The voice echoed. The space was divided, and a wizard appeared.

"She was a contractor, no matter what. Losing her was a loss for me, but... isn't this a more important issue now?"

The wizard muttered to himself.

He looked at Taesan and opened his mouth.

"Taesan, do you know where this place is?"

"100th floor."

The end of the labyrinth.

It was the terminal point. The wizard nodded.

"You've cleared the labyrinth wonderfully."

[100th floor cleared.]

"And... now I have to give you a reward."

The message they saw when they entered the labyrinth.

[There's a rumor that this labyrinth, created by a great wizard long ago, will grant one wish to those who conquer it.]

The conqueror's wish will be granted.

However, Lee Taeyeon didn't get her wish. It was because she cleared the labyrinth by cheating.

She didn't conquer the labyrinth.

Conquering wasn't just about clearing the 100th floor.

It meant perfectly conquering the labyrinth, just as it was said.

Was there anyone who had met that condition? Even that was an unknown condition.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But Taesan has now conquered the labyrinth.

He did it so perfectly that it's impossible to add anything to it.

'Ah, you are the conqueror of the labyrinth.'

The wizard of the labyrinth asked Taesan, who had become the master of the labyrinth.

'What is your wish?'

The wizard of the labyrinth asked the one who had conquered the labyrinth what they desired."
