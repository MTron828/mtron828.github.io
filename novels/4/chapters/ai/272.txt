**Chapter 273**

273. 61st Floor, Test Site (4)

Taesan gazed at the quest window with a mixture of frustration and disbelief.

The ghost, who had been reading the contents together with Taesan, spoke up.

[... Are you kidding me?]

"No, I'm serious."

[Then you must be out of your mind. You call this a quest?]

The ghost's words were sharp and laced with hostility, clearly directed at Verdandi.

[Do you think you can make a deal with the Essence and trade with it? You must be crazy. Do you even know what that means?]

"......"

Verdandi remained silent, her lips sealed.

The ghost's words were harsh and cutting.

[Do you think I'd die for this? You're asking the gods for a trade?]

Taesan had received quests from the gods before, but this was different.

In the past, the gods had shown favor to Taesan, showering him with gifts and affection.

That's why the trade with Taesan had been possible.

But the Fallen God was different. Taesan couldn't tell if the god liked or disliked him.

And trying to make a deal with a god who disliked him was tantamount to suicide.

"Moreover, if I'm a god of downfall... I roughly know how it happened. Haha. Do you know how crazy it is to ask for the return of a god's possession?"

"No."

Bel dentia denied.

"I'm not asking you to do something without a plan, Gang Tae-san. You're receiving the favor of the demon king, and it's not just ordinary favor. I'm sure the demon king is giving you favor enough to make you a servant."

As a human, he handles magic. Not only that, but he also freely wields intermediate black magic, a power that even demons can't easily obtain.

The demon king had a deep interest in Tae-san.

"The demon king's authority is high among many gods. Even if you're a god of downfall, you can't easily touch someone the demon king favors."

"Do you really think so?"

But the ghost ridiculed Bel dentia's words.

"The opponent is a god. It's not a being that moves according to the plans of a mortal. If the god of downfall gets annoyed and chooses to kill this guy and confront the demon king, what will you do?"

"……."

Bel dentia remained silent again.

He shook his head with a troubled expression.

"He also knew. That this plan was full of problems. That there were many things to solve.

"But!"

Beldegia clenched his fist tightly.

"What do you want me to do? I've tried my best too! I've done everything to save the princess! I've tried everything to change the mind of the god of downfall!"

He shouted with bloodshot eyes.

"I've even prepared a sacrifice to exchange for the princess's soul and risked my life to go down to the labyrinth! I've tried for hundreds of years! But nothing worked! That damn god didn't let go of the princess! Everything! I even offered myself, but the god of downfall didn't respond!"

He sobbed. His voice was filled with despair.

"I... I can't give up. I have to save the princess."

He made a contract with the labyrinth's magician for that one reason alone.

He waited quietly on the 61st floor for an unknown amount of time, waiting for someone who could save the princess to come.

The ghost clicked its tongue.

"What... I understand. I was the same too."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"If it weren't for Taesan, they would have been similar. They would have waited for hundreds, maybe thousands of years, buried in the tomb... Even if they had met a worthy adventurer, it would have been too late, and the leaders would have already been dead.

Most of the people bound here were the same. They made a contract with a wizard because they couldn't do it themselves. All they could do was hope for a strong adventurer to come.

For Beldegencia, Taesan was the first and last chance. She wouldn't let it go easily.

[The risk of the quest ends here. The decision is yours.]

The ghost took a step back. Taesan, who had been quietly watching their conversation, opened his mouth.

"Beldegencia."

"Huh, yes?"

Beldegencia's eyes widened, and he looked at Taesan with anxiety.

"I'll ask you something. How did the God of Decline approach you?"

"...We were going down the labyrinth. It was hard at first, but we worked together and tackled it step by step."

Beldegencia was the greatest wizard in his world, and the princess was the best swordsman in the empire. Unlike Taesan, who came from Earth, the two of them had powers from the beginning and didn't struggle much with breaking through the labyrinth."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When I entered around the 10th floor... the God of Fall directly descended in front of the princess.

The God of Fall's descent.

It was the same as Amelia Airin.

The mountain's eyes sank. Beldengkia continued speaking.

"'You are an extremely excellent and outstanding human,' he said, offering all sorts of support to the princess. Thanks to that, the princess was able to descend the labyrinth more easily. Until then, both I and the princess had deep gratitude towards the God of Fall."

Beldengkia bit her lip.

"And we arrived at the place where the God of Fall was."

83rd floor.

It was around then that Amelia's contact was cut off.

"I can't tell you anything more than that for now. But the princess's journey ended there."

Beldengkia muttered gloomily, and Taesan closed his eyes and thought.

Confrontation with God. Opposition against an existence that distorts and collapses the world itself.

The princess's soul will be in the God of Fall's hands. It won't be easy to retrieve it.

It wasn't something that could be decided easily.

Beldengkia waited with a nervous face. After a few minutes, Taesan opened his eyes.

"Okay."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Accepting a sub-quest.]

"Really?"

Beldeghia's eyes widened, as if she hadn't expected to accept it.

"Are you okay with that?"

"It's a god who's likely to oppose us anyway."

Taesan replied to the ghost's question.

Amelia Airin was in the same situation as Beldeghia's princess. The god of downfall approached her, lifted her up, and would eventually destroy her.

And Taesan intended to crush Amelia Airin's pride.

The god of downfall would not enjoy that process. It was highly likely that they would end up opposing each other.

"And I knew this day would come. It's just faster than I thought."

He had known from the beginning that not all relationships with transcenders would go smoothly. Some transcenders would oppose Taesan and try to trample him.

The god of downfall was likely one of them.

If it was inevitable, it was better to accept it now and gain something.

"That's what it is, isn't it?"

"Really?"

"Belldeckia confirmed the system window indicating acceptance, yet still asked in disbelief.

"Really, really accepting this?"

"I won't deny it until the end. But the reward will be sufficient, won't it?"

"Haha, haha, hahaha! Hahahaha!"

Belldeckia burst into laughter. Her twisted face was filled with joy.

"Don't worry, Belldeckia. Although I have reached the higher ranks, I cannot save the princess. That's for sure."

He struck his staff on the ground. The mana formed a contract and pierced Belldeckia's heart.

"This damn life. It means nothing anyway. When you complete the quest... I'll leave everything to you."

* * *

The quest was accepted. She chose to confront the God of Decline.

But nothing changed immediately.

"I'll have to go deeper first."

"Apparently, the God of Decline resides there. Unless the god appears directly, we can't solve this immediately."

And that's impossible, Belldeckia added.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The god of downfall reveals himself to those he is interested in from the entrance of the labyrinth. But since he hasn't appeared before you, you'll have to delve deeper and find the altar yourself."

"Hmm."

Taesan replied ambiguously.

It was impossible to deny the possibility of meeting her before. He would soon meet Amelia.

In the end, what he had to do was to become stronger, just like he had been doing until now. After a day, Taesan took on the test again.

"This time, it's a magic test."

Kiiing.

A magic circle was drawn, and a being like Ritch appeared. When he gestured, dark magic was unleashed and scattered in all directions.

[You have activated the frozen world.] [You have activated the starlight arrow.]

And the dark magic was shattered by the light and ice.

"Up to intermediate magic?"

Belddenkia was amazed again. While magic was easier to obtain than dark magic, it was still relative. Intermediate magic was a power that only those who had stepped into the depths could barely obtain.

The 61st-floor adventurer had such power. And the way he handled it with ease suggested that he had obtained it much earlier.

In other words, it meant that the god of magic also favored Taesan.

"Beldencia's confidence and expectations grew even more.

Whoa!

[The proficiency of the Starlight Arrow increased by 1%.] [The proficiency of the Frozen World increased by 1%.] [You passed the third test.] [You obtained the Supreme Mana Elixir.] [The Supreme Mana Elixir permanently increases mana by 1000.]

The rewards started to increase from the third test, and it was an elixir that increased the mana by 1000, which was a significant boost.

Now, unless you use dozens of mid-level magic spells in a row, you hardly feel the consumption of mana.

And I wanted to move on to the next test right away, but there was a time limit of one day. There was nothing else to do, so I continued talking with Beldencia.

"So, the princess was worried about the 21st floor's crazy spirit. She wanted to help the spirit, but... unfortunately, she couldn't."

"Looks like you couldn't handle the golem?"

"Yeah. I tried using magic and the princess looked for its weakness, but it didn't work. So, while the princess was facing it, I quickly filled up the spring."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Tae-yeon aimed for the golem's downtime, and Tae-san brought down the golem itself.

Since there were only two of them, they were able to use this method.

The story wasn't bad. It was an opportunity for other adventurers to learn how to get through the labyrinth. Belldeckia's story made Tae-san think of ways he hadn't thought of before.

"It was tough, but it was really fun."

Belldeckia muttered quietly, his eyes filled with memories.

21st floor. For Belldeckia, it was an event that happened hundreds of years ago, but he still remembered it.

That's how precious his memories with the princess were to him.

Tae-san, who had been listening quietly, spoke up.

"I have a question."

"What is it? Ask me anything, and I'll answer."

"You said you wanted to save the princess."

"That's right. That's my wish that's tied up in this place."

"Then why did you give up on attacking and made a contract with the wizard instead?"

Tae-san asked, and the ghost also opened its mouth, seemingly curious about the same thing.

[Come to think of it, you're not dead like me, are you? And you don't seem to lack the ability to attack the labyrinth either.]"

"The mountain still remembered the system window that appeared in front of him when he entered the labyrinth.

[Rumor has it that this labyrinth, created by a great magician long ago, grants one wish to those who conquer it.]

The fulfillment of wishes.

It's not a trivial matter.

"...That's probably the closest answer."

Beldegia nodded.

"If you conquer the labyrinth, the magician of the labyrinth will directly grant you one wish. It's explicitly stated in the system, so even if you're a god dwelling in the labyrinth, you can't refuse that wish."

[Then can't you just use that to save the princess's soul? You'll have to risk your life, but that's always the case.]

"Right. I thought so at first. Let's conquer the labyrinth and save the princess."

But Beldegia shook her head with a bitter smile.

"But... it was impossible."

[Impossible?]

"No. It's a problem before that. Even if I reached the end of the labyrinth... I wouldn't have been able to make a wish."

[...What do you mean? Are you lying?]

"It's not a lie. We just all misunderstood."

Beldegia said quietly.
