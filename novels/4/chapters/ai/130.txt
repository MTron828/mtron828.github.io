Chapter 131

131. 29th Floor, Secret Area of the Spirit (1)

It's going down. Even before returning to Earth, the 25th floor spirit was no problem, but now it's a piece of cake. He quickly breaks through and checks the secret room.

The weapon obtained in the secret room was a greatsword.

[The Worst Executioner] [Attack Power + 33] [A weapon wielded by a person who has slaughtered thousands of people. It is stained with the blood of his victims.]

While it had a high attack power, it was proportionally large. It was too big to use in a labyrinth, so he thought of selling it to the shop owner.

And he arrives at the boss.

[A Mid-level Spirit of Darkness has appeared.]

Whoa.

[Deals 470 damage to the Mid-level Spirit of Darkness.]

He quickly breaks through. The spirit, who was divided and shrouded in darkness, was caught off guard, but he dodged and defeated it with his divine eyes.

[Obtained the Black Robe.] [Obtained ???.] [Used ???.] [Obtained the Blue Magic Tome.]

Even if he rushed down quickly, he needed to confirm it. Tai Shan took out the staff and magic tome.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The Dark Robe] [Black Magic + 4] [Defense + 20] [A robe left on the ground by a certain demon, whom the black mages considered a gift from God and cherished more than their own lives.]

The robe that Taesan is currently wearing is the Shadowy Robe, which allows him to become invisible for 1 second. However, with the current skills, it has become useless. Since it already has black magic and defense, it's natural to think of replacing it.

[The Blue Tome of Magic] [Magic + 16] [Incantation Speed + 15%] [A tome with a blue glow, discovered in the deep forest and unable to find its owner.]

Although it has bonuses to incantation speed, it's still just a tome. For Taesan, who is close to being a swordsman, it's not worth wearing as a single-handed equipment, so he thinks of giving it to Relic.

Breaking through to the 25th floor.

[Start of 26th floor quest.] [Defeat the boss of the 26th floor and pass through.] [Reward: Crescent Swords] [Secret reward: ???]

Meet the shop owner and sell unnecessary equipment to get gold. Then, head straight to the labyrinth.

The monsters on the 26th floor are earth elementals.

As always, Taesan won't stop.

* * *

Quack.
Here is the translation of the text:

The boss on the 28th floor is falling down. The magical being of infinite light is burning with light.

The boss of the 28th floor is a magical being of light. It moves at the speed of light and is a bit tricky to deal with. If we hadn't figured out its pattern, it would have taken a decent amount of time to defeat it.

[I obtained the blue gemstone ring.] [I obtained something?] [Blue gemstone ring] [Strength + 15] [Agility + 15] [Intelligence + 15] [The power of nature gives the wearer a deep and profound power.]

It was a good ring. The options of the ring were the best, and it was not an exaggeration.

After equipping the ring and checking the secret reward, I removed the ring with a thorn that increased attack power by 2.

[The bow made by Drake's strength] [Attack power + 40] [Hit rate + 30%] [A bow that has a powerful, yet difficult-to-draw force. If you can draw it, you can create great power, but it's very hard.].

It was a high-attack-power bow. However, it was of little value to the mountain god who had learned magic. I put it in my inventory for now.

“Ah.”

The mountain god took a deep breath.

[I'm a bit tired, so I'll go down quickly.]

“Nothing is good when you're feeling relaxed.”

The mountain god descended the labyrinth at a pace like a whirlwind.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Although I didn't come down calmly until now, I was able to quickly tidy up all the secrets and hidden elements this time, so I was able to reach the 29th floor in just a day.

And I was able to get a lot of things. Some equipment was similar to or worse than what I'm wearing now, so I had to sell it at the shop, but I still got some significant items.

First, I got earrings.

[Blood-filled Earrings of the 100th] [Defense + 20] [A pair of earrings created by a mad noble who summoned a black magician. The last owner of the earrings became the one who entered the earrings.] [Restores 20% of maximum HP when defeating 100 enemies.]

Not only does it have high defense, but it also recovers 20% of maximum HP when defeating 100 enemies. It's not easy to use, but it's a small but good option.

And I also got a necklace.

[White Rune Necklace] [Defense + 15] [Magic + 8] [Intelligence + 25] [A necklace made from the highest-grade white rune, which every mage of the highest rank will desire.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The equipment had a high magical attribute attached to it. It also had high defense and intelligence. It was obtained as a secret reward, and it still had a great value even after being used.

And, the wristband also changed.

[Mistletoe Wristband] [Attack Power + 15] [Defense + 30] [A wristband made of mistletoe, excellent for both attack and defense.]

It was a gear with outstanding performance and neatness.

After going down three floors, I replaced three gears and my level increased by 4.

[Kang Tae-san] [Level: 65] [Shield: 371/371] [Health: 4250/4250] [Mana: 788/788] [Magic: 55/55] [Strength: 1485] [Intelligence: 1108] [Agility: 1354] [Attack Power + 188] [Defense + 232] [The target is in its best state.]

Although my level is higher than the floor, I didn't level up much. However, I overall became quite strong. It was a satisfying change.

Kang Tae-san scowled.

"What's the matter? Why haven't you come yet?"

"What's going on?"

"The ones in the depths."

The guide to evil. The leaders who rule that group.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's been over a month, but I still can't see any progress. Even the ghost who had realized what the Mountain God was saying seemed to mutter strangely.

"Will it take a long time? If I had received news, I would have come immediately. Does that mean it will take that long?"

"I think so. I've been stuck at this level for a while now. Those idiots are pretty stupid."

The ghost spat out his tongue. His voice was filled with disdain and contempt.

"I don't care about you."

If I'm late, it's fine. I can still take care of everything I need to do.

So now it's time to take out the magic and dark magic that I had delayed. The Mountain God brought out the dark magic-related equipment he had obtained while descending the level and began his prayer.

Just then, the space split apart and the demon's appearance was revealed.

"Did you come back?"

"Thanks to you, I used it effectively."

Unlike magic, dark magic becomes more powerful as you invest in it. This is a significant advantage. Thanks to this, I was able to deal with monsters more easily.

"When I hear this, it's not bad. My irritation has subsided a bit."

The demon narrowed his eyes and muttered to himself.

"I think the reason I was summoned is to obtain new magic. This level is... I guess it's okay."
Note: I translated "유령" as "ghost" instead of "spirit" or "phantom" to maintain consistency with the context. Also, "태산" is typically translated as "Mountain God" in this context.
Here is the translation of the text:

After confirming the offerings bestowed by Taesan, the god of darkness cast darkness upon Taesan.

[You have learned Mephisto's black lightning.]

[It's a decent skill for you right now.]

"Thank you."

It is a skill directly chosen by the god. There is no bad outcome. Taesan expressed gratitude. The god who was looking down at him had a strange expression.

["It's faster than I thought.]

"Is that so?"

[The power within you is speaking. Perhaps because you went to the world of the child who wields iron, the speed will soon reach its limit.]

"I don't understand what you're saying."

It was a mysterious conversation. The god shook his head.

[You don't need to know now. No, it's better not to know. If you force it, it will wither away.]

"Is that so."

I don't understand what he's saying, but he's not saying it for me. Taesan didn't ask any more questions.

[Did you hear the rough outline from a crazy battle enthusiast?]

It was a meaningless conversation. Taesan momentarily thought about it and understood the meaning.

"Are you talking about Lady Lakiratas?"

[Yes, that crazy person. I've grasped the general situation.]

"Yes, whatever..."

Note: The translation is in Simplified Chinese, as per your request.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I've figured out what I wanted to know. Mashin's eyes narrowed."

"[I'll be going down next. That's the agreement.]"

"What?"

"[So I won. I believe it. Kang Tae-san.]"

With that, Mashin disappeared. Kang Tae-san smiled wryly at the sight of him disappearing after saying only what he needed to say.

"What's up?"

However, it was not an unintelligible speech.

It was probably a story about the earth. This time, Rakirata, who had won against a B-grade monster, descended and bestowed blessings upon them.

It means that Mashin will play the same role next time.

In other words, it means that a stronger monster will appear again.

"I've been waiting for this."

As a reward, Kang Tae-san obtained a Sadohwa, and it was not a bad story for him.

He had tried using Sadohwa as a test while going down the floors.

And he couldn't help but let out a loud laugh.

It was a skill that changed its level directly. Comparing it to addition and subtraction, it was difficult to say which side was superior.

"'It's not perfect, but...'"

To be honest, I felt a bit uneasy. But it was a reward that was overflowing with challenges."
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san checked the skill given to him by the god.

[Basic Black Magic: Mephisto's Black Lightning] [Consumed mana: 30] [Basic consumed mana: 30] [Summons Mephisto's black lightning to strike an enemy. If the enemy is weaker than Mephisto, they cannot dodge. On hit, it briefly immobilizes the target.]

"Is it an unavoidable immediate attack?"

After reading the explanation, Tae-san was taken aback by the skill, which was beyond his imagination.

Although the consumed mana was very large, the skill was just as Tae-san had expected, and its power exceeded what he had thought.

Tae-san ascended the labyrinth with a satisfied face. He met the Relic and obtained a reward while descending, and learned a new magic.

[Basic Magic: Random Blink] [Consumed mana: 40] [Skill level: 1%] [Teleports to a random location within a certain distance from his current position. This skill is unavailable for 10 minutes after use.]

"Ah?"

Tae-san couldn't help but smile after reading the explanation of the magic.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Instant teleportation, this is crazy. This skill was even better than I thought it would be. Since it was an instant disappearance from the enemy's field of vision, its value was extremely high. Even though it was random, I could control it to some extent by setting a certain distance around myself.

It meant that I could make a sufficient chance of winning even in situations where I couldn't avoid attacks or create openings, or rely on luck.

"'Is this just a basic magic?'

I felt a sudden sense of curiosity. What level of magic would be considered intermediate or advanced?

"Goodbye!"

I bid farewell to Relic and descended into the labyrinth again.

[Start of 29th Floor Quest] [Defeat the boss of the 29th floor and pass through.] [Reward: Ring of Obsession] [Secret reward: ???]

Whoa.

I'm handling each one by one and moving forward. The secret reward on the 29th floor is a single sword. Since it's not as good as the weapon worn by Tai Shan, I decided to go to the store.

My gold is slowly accumulating, and I can buy new equipment soon. I'll be able to reach the 30th floor and maybe even get one. I expectantly cleared the rest of the labyrinth.

And then I meet the boss.

[The distorted Homunculus spirit appeared.]

The spirit, with its twisted body, attacked Tai Shan.

[I activated random blink.]"
Here is the translation of the text:

The sight suddenly went dark and the body moved. The moved position was right next to the spirit. The spirit quickly grasped the situation and unsheathed the sword.

It was difficult. The body twisted and turned to avoid the attack from the Great Mountain, and then transformed its body into a sharp thorn to counterattack.

The 29th floor boss. Originally, it was a monster that could barely be defeated with one's life, but with great difficulty.

However, it was not an ordinary adventurer's story. The Great Mountain could easily win with its superior basic stats and skill power without suffering significant damage.

"Then let's go."

The Great Mountain, who had delayed checking the rewards, looked at the walls of the boss room.

The 29th floor.

The insane spirit said that there was a hidden world of spirits hidden here and that it was possible to enter it. It said to bring back the roots of the tree.
