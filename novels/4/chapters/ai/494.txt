**Chapter 495**

**495. 92nd Floor. Faith (6)**

Taesan arrived at a white star.

The star was incredibly small, about the size of a moon. Its fluctuating powers were bursting out in all directions like a solar flare.

"......This is it."

The white light illuminated the world brightly.

It was as bright as the sun. Taesan felt a strange sensation through his feet.

As a result, Taesan realized one fact.

"This isn't material."

The extremely compressed power had physical strength, but it wasn't material. Taesan, who was quietly observing the white star, realized this.

The condensed white power was divine power.

Originally, it should have been golden, but it was extremely compressed, making it appear white.

"Then this is..."

The divine power had accumulated and grown to the size of a moon.

"I've gathered an absurd amount," Taesan laughed. The total amount of divine power was comparable to the size of a moon. Even Taesan, who received the faith of ten planets, couldn't reach this amount.

The shop owner had been in the labyrinth longer than Baudrey.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Remidaos had accumulated faith over a long period of time.

Suddenly.

Taesan wore a star made of divinity.

Before long, Taesan was able to see the master of faith.

It was floating alone, majestically, on top of a divine star of the same size.

[You've come.] [You've encountered Remidaos.]

His appearance was no different from Taesan's. Even the small patterns on his clothes were perfectly identical.

Remidaos quietly opened his eyes and looked at Taesan.

[It's strange to see someone with my appearance.]

A quiet voice echoed. Taesan responded to his words and cancelled the shape-shifting activation.

[Thank you.]

Remidaos replied calmly, his face showing no particular emotion.

[You're Gang Taesan. I've heard a lot about you from others. You're a rather unusual and twisted existence. Now that I see you, I understand.]

Remidaos nodded.

[You have the qualifications.]

"What do you want?"

Remidaos didn't stop Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Taesan, who pretended to be himself, stole faith and killed the immortals who followed him, but he just watched without intervening.

It's as if the Taesan wanted it that way.

[What I want is simple. A great position.]

Remidaos slowly descends. His feet, made of divine stars, step on the ground.

[I've always wanted that.]

"It doesn't seem that desperate, though."

[…….]

Remidaos gazes at Taesan with a star-like gaze.

[You are receiving the faith that I have received so far. So, you should know. It's a tremendous and powerful faith that I've been accumulating for a long time.]

Remidaos opens his hand, and a golden divine light manifests on his palm in an instant.

[I'm embarrassed to say this myself, but I think I did a good job.]

"I acknowledge that too."

On the surface, the immortals forced faith, but Remidaos obtained the true faith of people who suffered in their dreams. If the outsider Taesan hadn't intervened, Remidaos would have continued to gain faith."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[They believed in me deeply. Their faith was undoubtedly genuine.]

Remidao's palm trembles. His divinity disappears like a flame.

[But... it's not enough.]

Remidao's eyes flicker.

What's contained within is greed.

[I am undoubtedly powerful. The existence within the boundary cannot reach me. But that's all. I am ultimately a transcendent being who has reached the realm of faith.]

No matter how much iron you gather and refine, it's still just iron. It can't become something else. Faith is the same. No matter how much faith you accumulate, it's still just faith. Its essence doesn't change.

[I don't intend to be satisfied with this level. I will rise to a great position.]

The emotion of desire in his voice flows thickly. Taesan asks quietly.

"So, what do you plan to do?"

[I've thought about it a lot.]

Remidao laughs.

[They believed in me genuinely, but ultimately, it's just ordinary faith. Faith can never reach beyond. Then, what if their emotions become something other than faith?]

The corners of his mouth rise. A demonic, inhuman expression is formed, as if he's possessed.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[What if their emotions turn to fear?]

Taesan's face contorts.

[I'm feared and feared. Just imagining me makes their minds collapse, and just thinking of me makes them faint. If I'm etched into their brains so they can't forget me no matter what, would they be able to overcome their extreme fear and even worship me instead?]

"It's like saying 'I'm a god'."

[I've thought that for a long time. But it's always been a concern.]

The divine energy spreads out. The target of the divine energy wasn't Taesan. The spreading divine energy heads towards each planet.

[I tried to trample the immortals with my own hands, but their power ultimately falls within the realm of what mortals can imagine. It's not suitable, and it's not even worth showing off. What can be built up is ultimately just ordinary faith.]

Distorted emotions are directed towards Taesan.

[But you, you're different. You're a worthy opponent who can fully demonstrate my power. You're a being who can change the emotions of mortals!]

The divine energy explodes. Remidaos waves his arm.

[Look! Mortals!]

Kiiiiing!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The divine presence that has spread to each planet is etched into people's minds.

People who were praying towards the great mountain are bewildered. A gigantic voice resonates across the ten planets, directed at them.

[I am Remidaos!]

"Aaah!"

"What's going on!"

People scream and stumble backwards.

As they barely regain their composure, something is drawn in their minds.

In their minds, they see the image of the great mountain and Remidaos. Remidaos is smiling, with his finger raised.

[The one who appeared to you, claiming to be Remidaos, is an imposter! This person is trying to deceive you and gain your trust!]

"Ah..."

"Uh."

The gigantic voice that resonates across the entire planet, crushing and oppressing their souls. People's breathing is stifled. Their faces turn pale.

[I will kill the one who dared to impersonate me!]

A voice filled with rage.

People can no longer bear it and cover their ears. They don't want to hear it.

[What you should believe in is me! I am Remidaos!]

But Remidaos' voice pierces through their covered ears and enters their minds.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Remidao's face was distorted beyond recognition. It was as if he had become a malevolent spirit, something that couldn't exist in this world. People instinctively felt fear.

They closed their eyes. They didn't want to see that sight.

But Remidao's appearance was etched directly into their brains.

They couldn't close their eyes, nor could they block their ears.

[You must worship me! I am your god!]

"Ugh... Ah..."

Even the strong ones couldn't bear it, and tears and snot flowed from their noses. The transcendent being's genuine anger was unbearable. Mortals couldn't withstand it. The weak ones fainted.

But even in the minds of those who had fainted, Remidao's appearance continued to appear.

"What kind of method is this?"

Why did Remidao steal faith and kill immortals, yet remained calm?

It was because he didn't desire faith at the moment.

He wanted to receive something beyond faith. He aimed to reach a great height with that.

So, he quietly observed as Taesan stole faith.

Mortals believed Taesan to be Remidao, and calmly watched as their underlings died.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And when I confronted Taesan directly, I revealed the truth to all mortals.

What you served was a fake.

I am the real Remidaos.

You should believe in me.

His anger seems like righteous indignation, manipulating people's emotions and making them feel like they're the ones who did wrong.

The emotions towards Remidaos become distorted and collapse.

Not a god, but something distorted.

[Not bad.]

Remidaos wore a distorted smile. The distorted emotions of people piled up inside him.

[The outcome is uncertain, but it's worth trying. Why not? I think it's a decent method.]

Remidaos said lazily.

[When you first appeared in my domain, I was worried. But after careful consideration, I thought it was a good opportunity.]

What Remidaos desires is to transcend the wall. To do so, change is necessary. And Taesan was a being with the power to bring about that change."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's surprising, but what's even more powerful than the story I heard is a good thing. You can show me your true power. You can demonstrate a power that surpasses the understanding of mortals."

"Only the immortals are pitiful."

"They're just useless tools, anyway. I was going to take care of them from the start. You just did it for me."

"I don't think it's bad, but there's one important thing missing."

Taesan grasps his sword.

"In the end, it's something that can only be achieved by defeating me."

"I have the qualifications for it. I know you have a twisted power, but there's an unbridgeable gap between you and me."

Remidao declares with arrogance.

"So, become my sacrifice."

The star-shaped divine being collapses.

* * *

The collapsed divine being gathers around Remidao, condensing and solidifying, eventually taking on a single form.

It was a human figure made of gold.

But it was more like a distorted monster than a human. The divine being was crumbling like mud, losing its shape from the edges.

And its size was also extraordinary.

Remidao had become as large as the moon.

"It's huge."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It felt like something even more enormous than the Destroyer of Worlds. What was most important was that all of those things were extremely compressed into a divine entity.

The faith that Taesan had built up was not insignificant, but compared to Remidaos' faith, it was like the difference between the sun and a firefly.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

Remidaos raises his hand. The space trembles as a result. The divine entity scatters in all directions like a meteor.

Hundreds, thousands of years, or perhaps even more.

The faith that had accumulated over a long period of time exceeded the bounds of understanding.

Uu-u-u-ung!

Remidaos strikes down at Taesan with his hand.

Taesan quickly takes a step back.

His hand hits the universe.

Kwaa-a-a-ang!

And the shockwave spreads throughout the universe.

The impact reaches even distant planets. Trees are uprooted, buildings shake, people's bodies are blown away, and screams echo from all directions.

"Ah-ah-ah!"

"Please! Please! Forgive us!"

People cry and bang their heads on the ground. Their emotions towards Remidaos become even more distorted.

[You cannot defeat me.]

The voice resounds. Remidaos manifests his will. Thousands of windows made of divine energy are formed."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

One by one, windows of a size comparable to a meteorite hurtle towards Taesan.

Taesan draws a boundary line against the sacred windows that fill the space.

Kwaaaang!

A window shatters.

But it's impossible to break all the windows. The amount of sacred energy contained in one window exceeds the total amount of sacred energy that Taesan can handle.

Even a mediocre sacred warrior would have to exert all their strength to block just one window.

Thousands of such windows fill the space.

Taesan's eyes narrow. He reads the trajectory of the windows. He calculates the optimal force and method, and moves. The surrounding time slows down due to time interference.

Kwaaaang!

But even so, it's impossible to perfectly counterattack. More windows than he can break burst into the space, scratching Taesan's entire body.

Zzzezza!

Taesan's self-protection, which was wrapped around him, begins to waver.

A head-on battle is utterly impossible. Taesan makes a quick judgment. He trusts his self-protection and opens a gray space.

[You have activated Teleport [Chaos].]

Taesan has moved to the other side of the space.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even with limited blinking, I couldn't help but fill the space with windows and activate teleportation.

'If we only consider the total amount of pure power, I'm above anything I've seen.'

Taesan shook off the divine fragments stuck to his body.

Compared to high gods or other transcendents, if we only look at the simple amount of power, excluding levels, he was far superior.

That was a monster.

'But.'

I can win.

Taesan adjusted his full-body power and muttered to himself.

"You, you know about me."

It wasn't just a rumor. It was as if someone had told him about Taesan's power and what kind of existence he was.

"Let's talk about that part slowly too.""
