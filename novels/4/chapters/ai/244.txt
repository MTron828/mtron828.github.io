245. The Fourth Return. Earth (12)

The Taesan opened his mouth.

"Is this Afrodia's doing?"

[Yes, I came here at my own will.]

"It's unexpected."

I had expected a god of choice or a spirit to descend. Afrodia said.

[Originally, I didn't care. The trivial matters of the labyrinth and the outside world were outside my scope, but thanks to the trial you bestowed upon me, I too have become interested in this place.]

Afrodia turned his gaze.

His gaze was on Taeyeon. Taeyeon trembled slightly.

[What a weak and feeble person has come all the way to the end of the labyrinth? That's interesting. As expected, the possibility is not something to be ignored.]

His voice was not loud enough for people to hear.

Taesan realized.

Afrodia, having sent a trial to Taesan, had grasped the existence of the earth and Taeyeon.

He had a strong desire to come to this place and see it for himself, and so he had descended.

"Anyway..."

The first god to appear on earth was the god of struggle and death, Rakiratas.
Here is the translation of the text:

When Rakiratas appeared, Tai Shan was in a distant battle. Therefore, people felt the presence of a mighty being, but they had not seen it with their own eyes.

The same was true for the gods who had descended.

Taeyun and Kang Junhyuk felt the power of the being, but they had not seen its true form.

So, Aphrodia was the first god to appear before people.

Aphrodia's appearance was ordinary. He was a handsome black-haired man, but not particularly remarkable.

However, people couldn't bear to look at him.

It was as if looking at him was a sinful act, so they themselves turned away their gaze.

"A, um."

Taeyun and Kang Junhyuk's faces turned pale. The two adventurers, who were used to being alone, could sense Aphrodia's presence. However, they were different from others, who had not been able to read Aphrodia's aura.

"Ah, ah-ah!"

The two of them gasped for breath, struggling to control their rapid breathing and trembling heads.

They were afraid.

Since they had experienced the trials of the gods several times, they knew that the being in front of them possessed a considerable amount of power.

If they had to, they could even crush the entire earth.

Aphrodia, who had been looking at them, raised his finger.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Foolish strength is only confining oneself. Show mercy and compassion to human beings.]

My fingers were spinning around, and the figures of the people disappeared.

The Taesan suddenly expanded my senses. Then, I realized that everyone here had moved into the viewing room.

There was no response or resonance, and it seemed like some kind of divine power.

Aphrodite looked down at the Taesan.

[First of all, congratulations. Mortal. You have triumphed magnificently in this trial.]

He praised the Taesan.

[They have changed their methods. You may have survived, but most of the others may have died. We also expected that.]

The S-grade monster swallowed the Taesan. It was impossible to escape with the Taesan's power.

And the summoned monsters were also not at a level that other players could defeat.

While I didn't expect to be completely wiped out, I thought that only a few would survive, but the result was entirely different.

[You have won. And it's almost perfect. You can be proud of yourself.]

"Great Transcendent One."

Minerva bowed her head.

"May I dare to ask one question?"

Note: The text appears to be a scene from a game or a story, and the characters are likely from Greek mythology. The story is quite intricate, and the translation is my best effort to convey the meaning and tone of the original text.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Is it Beatrice's child?]

Aphrodite gazed at Minerva with a vacant expression.

[If I were to reveal the existence of a mortal, I would have been punished, but then Beatrice would be angry with me. So, I will be grateful to your father and receive his permission. You are a spirit.]

"It's a wonderful father, you know."

Minerva laughed playfully.

Aphrodite, who had been given permission to speak, gazed at the mountain.

"Can you tell me about the power that my master used? What is it?"

The power that had defeated the monster.

Even the mountain was curious. Although I had briefly read the explanation of the skill, I didn't know what it meant.

Aphrodite faintly smiled at Minerva's question.

[That power is the power that was handled by him, a power with a grayish hue.]

"Yes."

Minerva nodded her head.

Aphrodite gazed at the mountain with an intriguing gaze.

[There are many gods who take an interest in you. We too were watching the battle here.]

"Is that so?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Could gods have been watching him fight? That was unexpected. Aphrodite continued speaking.

[You knew, didn't you? You knew which direction to go, and... But this was beyond expectation.]

Even the gods couldn't have predicted that kind of power.

[The power you possess is extraordinary. When you defeat an opponent, you can seize their power. Even if the opponent is a god, it's the same.]

A complex gaze, filled with emotions, was fixed on Taesan.

Interest. Curiosity. A hint of unease and hostility.

[It's the first time I've seen someone use this world's existence without making a contract, and it's the first time I've seen someone with a divine nature. Similarly, the one who combined the two powers is you, for the first time.]

Aphrodite raised her hand, and a small light appeared.

It was the divine power that Taesan had handled.

However, the power's intensity and quality were overwhelmingly stronger.

[Divine power is the power accumulated during the process of becoming a transcendent being, created by our will.]

In contrast, the power of the god is an unchanging power that has been possessed since the beginning.

Aphrodite shook her hand, extinguishing the divine power.

[That power is a power that transcends boundaries.]

"'Boundary... what?'"

Note: The text appears to be a conversation between Aphrodite and an unknown character (Taesan), discussing the character's extraordinary power and its implications.
Here is the translation of the text:

Minerva asked a strange question, but Aphrodite did not answer.

[I suppose I have no choice but to say that. Since you can handle that power without being tainted, I won't interfere. I don't know what the others will do, but...]

Aphrodite whispered to herself.

[If that's the case, it means it's possible to approach those things in a different way. It seems that a long-awaited change is about to occur.]

Those things, then, are probably referring to a high-level matter.

[I'll pay attention to see where you're headed, what's at the end, and how your conclusion will unfold.]

Aphrodite chuckled.

[First of all, I did well.]

The god of despair declared.

[You have won against the existence that is invading your world. You may be proud of yourself.]

A direct declaration of victory from the god himself. A powerful energy burst forth from Aphrodite's previous declaration.

[I also need to give a fitting reward.]

The energy that burst forth spread throughout the world.

This energy enveloped the entire Korean land. It began to take root among the people who lived there.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Receive it. The first reward is here.] [Manifestation of divine power.] [A portion of the high-ranking area that surrounded the earth is removed.] [Restrictions are lifted due to the removal of the area.] [The acquisition of skills on earth becomes possible.] [The exchange of items obtained in the labyrinth becomes possible. However, equipment exchange is impossible, and only consumable items can be exchanged.]

The pupil of Tai Shan has expanded.

The loud voices and cheers from the far-off viewing platform could be heard here. Aphrodite asked.

[Are you satisfied?]

Tai Shan nodded his head.

There were various restrictions on the earth. Among them, the most significant one was the inability to acquire new skills and exchange items.

The former was, of course, the biggest restriction.

No matter how hard he tried to obtain new skills on earth, they were all sealed and could not be used.

He had tried to teach the minimum skills to those who had returned from their past lives, but this restriction had made it a futile effort.

This restriction has now been lifted.

In addition, the exchange of consumable items has become possible.

In his past life, he was a player in the easy mode. Of course, he was short on mana and health.

As he had anticipated, he filled his inventory with all potions and went out, but he still ran out of mana within a few years.

Therefore, he had struggled to defeat monsters due to his lack of mana.
Here is the translation:

However, the constraint on consumable items has been lifted now. Everyone can trade potions and arrows, and so on.

Of course, he doesn't feel a shortage of mana now, but the situation will change after clearing the labyrinth.

Since he can't go back to the labyrinth again, he had to use up the limited consumable items. In such a situation, being able to pass on consumable items to others was a crucial point for survival.

"It's possible up to this point, isn't it?"

[You knew this too. In another world, you can obtain the skills of the labyrinth, but it's impossible here. Those scoundrels have tricked us. If it's the entire world, maybe you wouldn't know, but in this area, which you have won, you can definitely lift the constraint.]

"Thank you."

It was a reward beyond his expectations. Tsai Shan was thoroughly satisfied.

However, Aphrodite was not yet done.

[Then, the second reward will be bestowed.]

Aphrodite's power is bestowed upon the people of the city again.

[Divine power manifests.] [Blessing is bestowed.] [He has obtained the blessing of the gods [Desperation Desire].] [Let's check it out.]

"Thank you."

Tsai Shan opened the skill window.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Divine Blessing: Willpower in Despair] [It is a divine blessing. When one's spirit is exhausted and on the verge of despair, the blessing is triggered. It fills one's spirit with determination and willpower to win.]

It was a mental blessing. A good blessing indeed.

The labyrinth was cruel. Even in the easiest mode, many people's spirits were crushed, and they became invalids or died.

This blessing alleviated the mental burden. People's mental exhaustion seemed to decrease significantly.

"I am grateful for the divine blessing."

[It is a blessing that everyone who is mortal desires. But it is meaningless to you.]

Taesan remained silent with a positive expression.

He no longer feels despair. He only moves forward with strength and victory in mind.

Therefore, the divine blessing of Aphrodite had no value to him. Aphrodite's hand trembled.

[So, I will give you something else.]

Taesan's power began to descend upon him.

[It seems like I have not yet utilized the power I gave you.]

The skills he obtained by breaking through Aphrodite's trials. The seeds of despair.

Every time he felt the despair of his enemies, he could grow his skills.
Note: The original text appears to be a passage from a fantasy novel or game, and the translation may not be perfect due to the cultural and linguistic nuances.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the 51st floor of the world of spirits was cleared, it seemed like a lot had been accumulated, but it was still impossible to utilize the skills.

"[It looks like it's almost full, so fill in the rest.] [The condition of the special skill [Seed of Despair] has been lifted. It has changed into the special skill [Branch of Despair].]"

"Thank you."

God itself had lifted the restrictions. Its value was never insignificant.

Now that all rewards have ended, Afrodia stood up.

"[Then we should conclude.]"

Conclusion.

Taesan could guess what it was.

All Koreans in Korea had gathered in Seoul to clear the quest.

So, now it's time to move on to the next one.

Afrodia clenched her fist.

Crunch!

The world began to distort. The people in the city screamed and fell to the ground.

Taesan gazed blankly at the horizon beyond the sight.

The semi-transparent barrier spread out at the edge of the land.

It was a barrier that prevented movement until the quest was cleared. Because of this, Taesan was unable to help people from other regions when he returned for the second time.

It was cracking and breaking apart.

"[Open it.]"

Note: The translation is in Simplified Chinese, as per the rules.
Here is the translation:

With God's words, the barrier was shattered.

The distorted world returned to its original form.

At the same time, a system window appeared.

[Congratulations. You have cleared the final quest of your region.][The barrier surrounding each country has been removed. From now on, you can move to other countries without restrictions, but you may receive penalties in future quests.][National quests will begin at the next return. Be prepared and ready.][The community will expand. From now on, players from other countries will also be able to communicate with you.]

‘Finally.’

The first constraint was lifted.

Aphrodite's body began to disperse. He soared into the sky.

[Prove your worth. Mortal, and survive.]

A massive voice spread throughout the world. Just before disappearing, Aphrodite gazed at Mount Tai.

[I will wait for the next one.]

Mount Tai nodded its head.

Aphrodite completely disappeared, and Minerva let out a sigh and took a deep breath.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It seems that the owner is really calm when directly talking to me, the Taesan. Is it because it's familiar?"

Taesan replied and turned his body around.

The studio was very noisy. It seemed that the system window that appeared just now was trying to receive some content.

Taesan thought he would explain it.

He walked towards the studio.
