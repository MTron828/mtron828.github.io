Chapter 228

228. Creating a Dark World (3)

She had grown up.

The appearance of the girl who had been tied to the attic had vanished, and she had transformed into a mature woman. Her blue hair cascaded down to her waist, and her blue eyes sparkled with a radiant light.

Minerva appeared on the ground.

A trembling breeze swirled around her, and the air itself seemed to settle beside Minerva.

The entire natural world surrendered to her.

The overwhelming presence consumed the entire space.

Minerva turned her gaze. Her eyes, which seemed to be distant and cold, slightly smiled.

"It's been a long time, hasn't it?"

"It's only been a minute."

"That's all it took? It's amazing."

She examined her own finger. It was a slender, long, and beautiful finger.

"It felt like a very long time to me."

"Hahaha!"

Haskar burst out laughing and inserted himself between the two. He gazed at Minerva, excited.

"Divine Emperor! Divine Emperor! I once believed in a weak and feeble existence!"

(Note: I translated "정령왕" as "Divine Emperor", but it could also be translated as "Sovereign of the Spirits" or "King of the Spirits", depending on the context.)
Here is the translation of the text:

He was also a human of Aurulia, worshiping the spirit king as a child and having absolute faith in his existence.

But that was not the case anymore.

"Now, you are nothing to me! Die and be buried!"

He had made a contract with a great, divine being.

In reality, Haska had crushed the power that Minerva had shown with anger.

Even if the spirit king grew up, nothing would change. Haska released a shadow. The shadow engulfed everything and rushed towards Minerva.

Minerva sent a cold gaze and opened her mouth.

"Die."

The wind arose. The small gesture of the wind became a huge storm that descended upon the earth.

Kaga, kaga, kaga!

The storm swept away the shadow and erased it. Haska's face turned stiff as he hid his body in darkness. The wind covered him.

"Aaaaah!"

Pain appeared in his voice for the first time.

"Ah."

Minerva smiled coldly.

When the storm stopped, the shadow that had engulfed the entire earth had vanished.

[This is the spirit king's true form.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The ghost murmured. Tai Shan also realized it. Having seen the fire spirit king, he immediately made a comparison.

Minerva currently possessed the perfect power of the fire spirit king.

Even by herself, she could break through to the depths, and no matter how many Tai Shan's dozens came, she could be certain of winning.

She was a being who had everything, including the corresponding power and qualifications.

"But I want to tear you apart and kill you right now..."

Minerva's eyes narrowed. Her anger enveloped Haksek.

"Ugh."

Haksek took a deep breath. The shadow wrapped around his body, protecting him.

Haksek only felt material pressure by revealing his emotions.

"That won't do."

Minerva looked up at the sky.

Kururin!

Tai Shan was too preoccupied with fighting Haksek to notice, but in the distance, a red aura and light continued to collide.

Even from a distance, the power wave could be felt.

It was a collision of divine power and spirit power.

Barcaga appeared late, bowing respectfully towards the spirit king.

[Your Majesty, congratulations on becoming complete.]

"That's right, Barcaga."
Here is the translation of the text:

Minerva gently stroked Barkaz's head with a tender gaze and opened her mouth to speak.

"Tai Shan, I have to go help my father. So, I think you should take care of it."

"It doesn't matter."

"...Don't laugh! Dare to ignore me!"

Haskell suddenly let out a loud noise.

He didn't even bother to respond to her and was about to leave. Haskell's pride couldn't accept that.

With his emotions and a shadow, he rushed across the entire area.

Minerva scolded Haskell.

"Definitely, the power you're handling is a threat to me too."

The shadow, which was directly contracted with his soul, was the power of his soul. It was not something that could be underestimated, even by the power of the Spirit King.

"But, in the end, it's ultimately up to you as a human to handle it."

Minerva clenched her fist. The darkness rushing towards her shattered like a mirror.

"That unrefined power can't reach me. ...But it will reach him. It will be threatening. Then it won't be helpful."

Minerva looked at Tai Shan.

"I'm sorry."

She said quietly.

"I was begged not to kill, so the spirit got involved."
Here is the translation of the text:

"It doesn't matter anyway. I've already gotten involved, so it's fine."

"No, this is a matter of my heart."

She stretched out her hand to Taesan.

"I am the king of all spirits and the guardian of Arulia. The spirit king of the wind. Minerva."

Power surged out from the tip of her fingers.

This power enveloped Taesan and Minerva.

"I will stake my birth and death as a spirit, and I will become your companion and live alongside you, bound by our agreement."

That was an agreement. And once it was made, it was a rule that could not be broken without the consent of both parties, and was absolute.

"Will you accept?"

Taesan gazed at her with a cold expression.

"Refuse to make an agreement?"

Her power was for this world. If she made an agreement, she would lose her strength, so she didn't want to make one, she had said.

Minerva smiled wryly.

"The situation has changed, so I thought it would be a good idea to consider it as a reward or an apology."

Outside, Haksa continued to manifest its power, but the barrier that enveloped Taesan and Minerva continued to block it.

She looked at Taesan with a worried expression.

"...What will you do?"

"...Whatever."
Here is the translation of the text:

"There is no reason to refuse. The power of the Spirit King was clearly necessary to crush Hakaska."

"I'll accept."

Minerva smiled.

"Good."

The Spirit King's power was infused into Taesan.

Taesan let out an unintentional sigh.

The quality of the power he had obtained so far was different from the power that began to take shape in his body.

[You are the Wind Spirit King. You have contracted with Minerva.] [You have learned the special passive skill [Natural Harmony].] [You have learned the special active skill [The King's Vessel].] [You have obtained the title [Contracted with the King].]

"From now on, I will be your shield and sword."

Minerva continues to speak.

"I will protect you, and your enemies will be my enemies, as you are my master."

Taesan nodded. Minerva smiled and waved her hand to summon Barakaza.

"Come here."

[......Your Majesty. Are you really okay?]

"This is the choice I have made, and there is a gift for you too."

She placed her hand on Barakaza's head.

Her power surged into Barakaza, and Barakaza's strength and aura became noticeably stronger.
Here is the translation of the text:

Baruka's eyes widened in amazement.

"Oh, Majesty, I have been granted such great blessings......"

"It's just because of the limitations of the vessel that the shield is not effective......"

"That's enough. I thank you for the blessing, Majesty."

"Very well. Then I will finish what I need to do here."

Her body began to disperse.

"Then I entrust the rest to you."

With that, she flew away into the distance.

Tae-san clenched his fist.

"Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah!"

Haska cursed loudly.

"Just barely! Just barely, with the power of the Spiritual King!"

A shadow emerged. The darkness, which had been suppressed by the Spiritual King's power, again targeted Tae-san.

A rough shadow.

Up until now, we had to be careful just to touch it.

But now, that was no longer the case.

"Baruka."

Baruka slapped his thigh. A barrier was formed, enveloping Tae-san.

Tzzz, tzzz, tzzz!

The barrier, which had collided with the shadow, was shaken violently.

But it did not break. It was hard and sturdy, and it was firmly protecting the target that it had to defend.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hoh. Can you block even a mediocre attack like this?"

Barqa's voice was filled with satisfaction.

"This is the power that the King himself has bestowed upon me... It's really satisfying."

"Ah, don't joke around! The top-notch ones are blocking me!"

"This is actually happening. It's a human who has sold his soul."

Barqa sneered at Ha-sak.

While Ha-sak was blocking the attack, Taesan quietly adjusted his sense of change.

His hand trembled.

The wind responded and gathered on his hand.

The energy of the earth gathered on his feet and the heavenly energy slowly descended.

Nature itself was in harmony with Taesan.

"Hah."

Taesan couldn't help but burst out laughing.

The one who was once the enemy of the spirits, who had received their hatred, had made a contract with the spirit king who protected them. I couldn't help but laugh.

"Try a little more."

[Don't give up. But I don't think I can hold out for long. Please end it as soon as possible, master.]

"Ahahah!"

Ha-sak continued to strike the barrier. The barrier trembled as if it would break at any moment, but it was still holding its ground.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san calmed down and felt the power within him being adjusted.

It was a skill he received from Minerva through their contract. He naturally knew how to handle it.

[You have activated the King's vessel.]

Ding!

His body was trembling.

A great, mortal-affecting aura began to settle within him.

"Ah."

Tae-san let out a sigh. The great aura enveloped his entire body. He clashed with the many powers he had accumulated, causing a commotion.

"It's unnatural."

What he had accumulated was not his own aura. It was a forced combination of aura and vessel through the contract. Therefore, it was inevitable that there would be a clash between the unnatural feeling and the powers he had accumulated.

"And it's too strong."

That power was violent, to the extent that it shook his internal world.

He could handle it, but he lacked the skill to properly adjust it with other powers.

The power surging from the King's vessel.

The power he had accumulated as an ascended being.

Mana.

Maga.

Other diverse powers within him were also trembling.

Tae-san made a swift decision. He couldn't contain all these powers within himself now.

The pure crystal ring shone brightly.
Here is the translation of the text:

Woooong.

It's a mixture of elegance and mystery, dyed in pure white.

The effect is the auxiliary power of its own essences and the storage of strength.

By activating the royal vessel, the body of the Great Mountain was filled with a powerful aura, and the vessel pointed towards the ring, pouring energy into it. The ring quietly absorbed all its power.

Woooong.

The energy contained in the ring was stabilized.

The ring, which had absorbed all the power, made the Great Mountain slightly startled.

"Can I take it this far?"

[Think about the materials of this ring. Even if it's the power of the Spirit King itself, it should be able to be taken without any problems, right?]

It was a good oasis. The Great Mountain harmonized with the ring. The power that the Great Mountain could control was beginning to settle in his body.

"Huu."

The Great Mountain, who had finished all the preparations, took a deep breath.

"It's a strange feeling."

[Are we done? Master? It's getting close to the limit.]

Haskar was manifesting his power in a state of madness. The wall that Barakaz had been struggling to maintain had been broken down.

"Now it's done."

The Great Mountain stepped forward.

Kahkang!

The wall shattered. Haskar revealed it.

"Swallow it!"
Here is the translation of the text:

Darkness descended upon him.

Tae-san clenched his fist.

Together with the ring, he drew out his strength and hurled it forward.

Kwaahahah!

The authority was unleashed.

The shadow was erased by the power.

"What, what?"

Tae-san's lips curled up. He felt a sense of satisfaction as the energy coursing through his body was fulfilled.

"Very good."

"...That's impossible!"

Haskar shouted with a tone of denial.

"I've received the power of God! I've received the power of those who rule this world!"

Haskar stepped out of the mortal's vessel. He believed in himself. But he couldn't accept the fact that his own attack was blocked by the likes of the Spirit King and the human in front of him.

Zztt!

The shadow corresponding to his emotions emerged. Countless darknesses took on various forms and tried to engulf Tae-san.

Tae-san drew out his sword.

Ka-ka-ka-ka!

The whirling sword strokes sent the shadows flying. The shadows clung to the sword, trying to erode it, but they were repelled by the manifestation of his light and gentle power.

"Hah."

Tae-san couldn't help but smile.

"This power is..."

Tae-san waved his hand.
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have ignited the spark of disaster.]

The spark of disaster. The darkness handled by the wolf that destroyed the world.

The Taesan is unable to properly handle this flame due to a lack of power.

Whoosh!

The flames are flickering. The Taesan roughly moves his hand. The apocalyptic flames that lead to the destruction of the world follow the owner's will and burn the shadows.

The Taesan clenches his fist. The flames condense into a solid form.

Haska quickly transforms into a shadow.

Chi-i-iik!

"Aaaaah!"

The shadow is trampled by the flames and Haska's body is engulfed in flames.

[$#@! took 753 damage.]

The Taesan raises his lip.

Finally, the normal damage has started to enter.

"You, you, you!"

Haska, who barely extinguished the flames, gazes at the Taesan with bloodshot eyes. The shadow stretches out towards the Taesan, plotting revenge.

[You have activated the wolf's authority.]

The wolves, formed into a legendary being, are born.

[Crack!]

The wolves fiercely bite the shadows.

The shadows begin to tear and disappear.

"This, this..."

"It's good."

Here is the translation:

Tae-san raised his hand. Darkness began to gather around him, writhing and twisting.

"Then would this work too?"

[You have activated the spreading branch of the curse.]

The technique used by the holy god, who was struck down by Tae-san. The power directly issued by the god for the holy god.

This is realized by Tae-san's power.
