Chapter 222

222. The World of Spirits and Humans. Arulia (5)

"Ah, Lord of the Mountain!"

Akiel, who was trembling with fear while huddled together with someone else in the carriage, burst into tears at the sight of the Lord of the Mountain.

"Where did you go?"

She had almost lost her mind during the time the Lord of the Mountain was absent.

She suddenly woke up with a start, feeling a strange, overwhelming power emanating from nearby. The feeling was that they could be crushed by a mere thought. Fearing for their lives, they half-lost their minds and frantically searched for the Lord of the Mountain, but he was nowhere to be found.

"Why did you flee? Why are you here?"

"Ah, but the Lord of the Mountain is not here... "

"Are you waiting for me?"

"Yes, yes... it's because it's dangerous."

Akiel's eyes welled up with tears as he nodded his head.

A light surprise appeared on the Lord of the Mountain's face.

'It's been a while since I've been worried about someone else.'

It was the first time since he was a weak, unskilled player in his previous life, excluding a rare exception.

The Lord of the Mountain opened his mouth.
Here is the translation of the text:

"'I'm sorry to worry you, and I didn't show my face because I had something to do.'"

"'What kind of tasks do you have that you're so full of energy...?'"

"'It's because of me.'"

"'Is that so?'"

[Oh.]

A barrier mage appeared on the other side of the carriage door.

[Are they the master's companions? They're weak but good people, aren't they.]

"'Can you understand that too?'"

[The spell is a natural existence. It can read the general flow of life. Well, if you're as strong as a master, most of it is blocked.]

Akiel's eyes widened in surprise.

"'Oh, oh?'"

[It's nice to meet you. I'm a top-grade spell, Barakaza. Right now, I'm a contracted spell for the person next to me.

"'Top-grade spell!'"

"'Barakaza? What?'"

'[Barakaza, sir?]'"

They were startled. The spell guardians who were watching over them and sending cautious glances also reacted strongly.

Taesan shook his hand.

"'Let's just take a nap for now. Haven't you all slept yet?'"

"'Ah, yes...'"

Akiel nodded dazedly.

Note: There are some cultural and linguistic nuances in the original text that may not translate directly to English, but I've done my best to convey the meaning and content of the text.
Here is the translation of the text:

They had waited for Taesan all night, and they were tired enough to collapse. However, they couldn't sleep. After a few hours, they got up and started moving again.

Taesan got off the carriage. The carriage was too large for him to enter.

In the carriage, Aki-en and his companions glanced at Barakaza with curiosity. They had many questions and were almost bursting with curiosity.

Barakaza smiled satisfactorily.

[Aki-en and his companions were pleased to see him and were enjoying the respect being shown to him. A spirit laughed with a smile.]

[You're a spirit from the mundane world. You're having fun in a different direction from the spirits in the labyrinth. Without even a little bit of fun, life would be too dull. It's still more enjoyable in the human world than in the spirit world.]

[...Barakaza sir.]

A quiet spirit who had been following them quietly couldn't help but open his mouth.

[Are you under contract with the author?] [Then what do you mean?] [The author is a being who has killed our kin.] [So what?]

Barakaza responded.

The spirit asked again.

[To make a contract with a being who has killed our kin. Everyone will condemn you.] [Will they condemn me?]

Barakaza laughed.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Who criticizes me? The king has fulfilled his duties and disappeared. Shields and spears are the same. In such a situation, who dares to scold me and punish me?] [But...] [Of course, if he was a malevolent existence that killed his own kind, I would have resisted, but he won a fair fight against his own kind. Then I have no intention of being hostile towards him.]

Barkazar turned his body as if he had nothing more to say.

[The conversation with you and your desire to abandon your self for the sake of the spirit is still tiring. Let's go.]

Barkazar's firm words left the spirits with no choice but to remain silent.

Barkazar spat.

[The spirit is mostly like that, isn't it? A little more freedom would be nice, but...] [You seem a bit unusual anyway.] [I'm not denying that. That's why Shields and Spears also said something to me.]

"Have Shields and Spears been stronger than you since earlier?"

[Of course. They are the king's direct subjects.]

"What kind of classification do your spirits have, exactly? How are they divided?"

[It's not hard to understand. Among the spirits with their own selves, the weakest spirits are the lower-level spirits. Even if they are weak, they have significant power compared to ordinary humans.]

Barkazar continued speaking.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The next one is a mid-level spirit. It's not bad, but it's not strong enough to be summoned easily. Compared to low-level spirits, it's much stronger, but it's not yet exceptional. The next one is a high-level spirit. From here on, it's okay.]

High-level spirit. I've fought against spirits from the Taesan Temple before. And I've also heard that there are existences that have made contracts with high-level spirits in this world.

[It's really strong. It's within the limits of human power, so it's not bad. Next is me. I'm the highest-level spirit.]

Barakazah laughed.

[Even if you search throughout the spiritual realm, it's hard to find someone who has made a contract with us. The ones who have made contracts with us have spread their names throughout the world. And they must know about me too.]

Akielin's eyes widened in surprise.

[Tell me, human. Do you know who I am?]

“……Yes. You are a great spirit of a great king, from hundreds of years ago.”

[That's right.]

Barakazah nodded his head.

[Sometimes, people who have surpassed human limits are born. They make contracts with us, and we are the ones who protect the king and serve as his shield. We are directly under the king's command. We're extremely strong.]

“Compared to you?”

[It's not comparable. I'm not even strong enough to resist, let alone fight back. I'm just being trampled.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"When I fight alongside you, even the strongest defense is no match for me, right?"

[That's true, but... it's just that. It's just a matter of time. Although I've had a few matches, I've never been able to do anything and lost every time.]

"That's right."

Tai-san stroked his chin.

"What if we compare ourselves to them now?"

[...It's ambiguous.]

Baruka paused for a moment before speaking.

[I don't know the master's perfect strength. But I can feel a power that emerged simultaneously with the contract. The master is as strong as a monster. Even if the entire realm of magic, excluding shields and swords, attacks us, I'm not confident we can win.]

Baruka smiled wryly as he spoke.

That kind of human, who is unable to win even when they are all attacked, is a existence that even he himself doesn't believe in.

[But if we compare ourselves to them... it's probably going to be tough to win.]

"That's it, right?"

[It's just as the king's direct descendant. They're not weak.]

"So, that person wasn't the one, was it?"

The spirit that had taken root in the skull. The one who received the power of the spirit king and pressured Tai-san was seen as a high-level spirit, not just shields and swords.

"It's fun."

Note: The text appears to be a conversation between characters in a fantasy setting, discussing their abilities and strengths. The language is informal and conversational, with a touch of humor and sarcasm.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Great Mountain smiled slightly.

[And then, as the Spirit King, but... I don't have anything to say. I'm not sure what level of power the king has. I just think he's extremely powerful.]

"I've heard it roughly."

The Spirit King of the Mysterious Palace was about to kill him just because he showed his emotions. Although he has become stronger than before, he has not changed.

"The Spirit King."

The Great Mountain was curious for a moment and asked.

"Can you make a contract with any spirit?"

[Theoretically, it's possible. There are also people who have made contracts with the creation and defense spirits, according to him.]

"Then, what about the Spirit King?"

The Great Mountain's question made Baraka pause.

[I don't know... The king is a being who does not involve himself in the mortal world.]

"That's true, isn't it."

[What, it's an impossible task. Just thinking about it is a waste.]

Baraka nodded and said.

[Then, my lord. I also have something to ask.]

"Tell me."

[What does it mean that our god has entrusted it to the lord?]
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's exactly as I said. The demon king is seated in the labyrinth. He told me to come to this world and fill the void left by the demon king."

I didn't plan to speak at first. The demons were hostile towards him and didn't believe him, so it would be pointless to say anything.

However, Barakka made a contract with the Great Mountain and didn't have any hostile feelings towards him, so he judged that it wouldn't be a problem to say something.

[The god himself spoke directly to the owner.]

Barakka laughed sarcastically.

[What's wrong with this? The more I listen, the stranger it sounds. What does it mean to fill the void?]

"The scoundrels."

The Great Mountain raised its finger. The demon king's minions, their bodies darkened by evil, were running towards the carriage.

Barakka applauded. Light burst forth, defeating the demon king's minions. A sigh of relief echoed from inside the carriage.

[It seems that the demon king's minions have become strange recently.]

"The ghostly beings are taking advantage of the void left by the demon king's demise and are plotting against this place."

[Aha. The exiled ones. Are they ghostly beings?]

"I know."

[I'm an old demon, relatively speaking. After the demon king's demise, I sensed something strange, and it turned out to be that. My doubts have been cleared up.]

Barakka smiled slightly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It seems the owner was right. It's been a fight from the start. I'm really satisfied."

"If you're satisfied, that's great."

After that, it was time for dinner. Akien's party was preparing dinner while casting occasional glances at Barakaza.

"If you have any questions, ask. I'll answer."

Barakaza's words made Akien jump in surprise and tremble with fear.

She entrusted the cup to the spirit and opened her mouth cautiously.

"The great king who ruled the world. The one who stood by Barakaza's side, who was related to God's lineage, and who was revered by all...".

"That's a misconception. He wasn't related to God's lineage at all. On the contrary, he was a slave."

"...Ha."

It was true. The spirit was really a historical figure.

"What's going on?"

Tai Shan didn't have his own identity. It was impossible for him to make a contract with a spirit, but he had made a contract with the highest-grade spirit, not another spirit.

She was taken aback and asked:

"Great spirit, what exists at the place we are going to now?"

A girl inside the crystal. No one in the world knew her true identity. Only speculation followed.
Here is the translation of the text:

Barkazar answered her question.

[Not long ago, the Spiritual King fulfilled his duties and disappeared. His position will be filled by a new Spiritual King.]

"Then, what is the meaning of..."

[The new Spiritual King is the one who will protect Arulia.]

Akiel's face turned pale. The others who were listening from behind also looked the same.

They lived together with the spirits. To them, the Spiritual King was an object of faith.

In particular, their family was a family that faithfully believed in the Spiritual King.

"Ah, then we..."

[We possess a being that can protect you and are conducting experiments in various ways.]

She bit her lip.

[Your kind of power is no match for the king, and the spirits don't care much about you either... but it's really funny. You're using the power given to you by the king to scheme against the king. Humans are always selfish, after all.]

Barkazar laughed. Akiel's face turned dark.

The carriage moved on carelessly.

And they arrived in front of the crystal.
Here is the translation of the text:

There were many people. It was impossible to count them. Hundreds of people were surrounding the core, setting up tents.

Akihen spoke in a dying voice.

"I asked directly from the Bakugan family, so everyone gathered from all over."

"Then let's part ways here."

"Yes?"

"If it's known that I was with you, it won't be good for you."

Taisan's words made Akihen guess what he was planning to do.

"I...".

"Just do it comfortably. You don't need to move at all."

Taisan took a step forward.

He overpowered the voice trying to grab him and ran towards the core, avoiding the people. A massive barrier was spreading out around the core.

"Barkaza."

[Wait just a moment.]

Barkaza raised his arm to the barrier.

The barrier began to crumble, creating a space for Taisan to enter.

Taisan arrived in front of the core without being detected by anyone.

Surprisingly, there was no one in the core. It seemed that everyone was preparing to attack the core.

Taisan met the core.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Woooouung.

Power flowed into my hands.

It was the power of nature. Barkaja felt a sense of awe when he realized this.

[It's just like being a king. You're still not fully recovered, but it's impressive.]

Beyond this, there was a small girl.

A girl with blue hair, wearing a white robe, was quietly sitting in a ball inside the sphere.

"It's the second time I've seen the Spirit King."

A guide to evil ways. One of the leaders of that place, the Fire Spirit King.

And the Spirit King who protects Arulia.

The purpose of the Great Mountain's arrival at this place was to guard the existence in front of him.
