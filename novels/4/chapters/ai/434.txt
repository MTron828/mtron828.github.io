**Chapter 435**

435. 85th Floor, The Ash-Colored Woman, Sosiet Gardenitia (3)

"Is that a Necromancer?"

Taesan hurled his body at the rushing corpses. He clenched his fists and kicked simultaneously, unleashing a whirlwind.

The corpses' flesh flew in all directions, and the skeletons' bones scattered everywhere.

Kugugugung!

The corpses continued to appear, including some that Taesan recognized.

The monsters he had defeated in the lower floors of the labyrinth.

They were now moving as Sosiet's tools.

And these monsters were incomparably stronger than those on the lower floors.

Treating the beings he had defeated as corpses.

That was Sosiet's ability.

Taesan stomped his foot. The dozens of beasts that were biting him suddenly exploded. He moved his hand as if nothing had happened.

Quadduduk.

He crushed and smashed the corpses. Flesh stuck to his fingers.

However, there were even more corpses that appeared than those he had defeated.

The room was instantly filled with corpses.

Taesan swung his fists and opened his mouth.

"How do you feel? You don't know anything about the person you thought was a friend."

[It's noisy.]

The ghost replied in a calm tone. The shocked expression from earlier had largely subsided.

[... Amazing.]

He didn't know anything about Sosiyeot.

He believed her lies, and he never thought she had feelings of affection towards him beyond friendship.

[In the end, did she kill me? I'm a bit sorry, but... it doesn't change the fact that Sosiyeot killed me.]

The ghost spoke in a calm voice.

[The mental cleanup is done.]

"That's right."

Taesan spread his hands out. He cast a spell towards the hundreds of corpses rushing towards him.

[You've activated a mana storm.]

Kagagagak!

A massive storm erupted inside.

In an instant, the corpses were swept away by the fierce storm. Sosiyeot continued to summon more corpses at a rapid pace, but the storm didn't stop. Instead, it devoured the corpses and grew even larger.

"It's a monster."

Sosiyeot let out a dry laugh and made a serious face, placing her hand on the ground.

"Come out."

Kukukukung!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A gigantic corpse rises from the darkness.

A dog's head, an orc's arm, and the lower body of a basilisk.

It was a chimera, composed of numerous corpses.

[Kaaaa!]

The chimera let out a roar and charged towards the mana storm.

Although the mana storm was slowly disintegrating the chimera's body, it refused to back down and fiercely grasped the mana storm.

Kugugugugu!

The powers clashed, and the mana storm, unable to withstand, exploded. The wind's blade swept in all directions.

[Kaaaa...].

And the chimera, struck by the blade head-on, was torn into dozens of pieces and collapsed.

Sosiet didn't stop.

She gave another command, facing the darkness that spread far and wide.

"Reveal your form."

Kuung!

A gigantic arm appeared from the darkness.

Its size was enough to fill the labyrinthine room. A gigantic eye seemed to gaze from beyond the darkness.

[Is that a giant's corpse?]

"It's a corpse I've had a hard time getting. Let's try blocking it once."

It wasn't an ordinary giant. The power contained within the giant's corpse was above that of the leaders.

"But..."

To Taesan, it wasn't that remarkable a level.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It wasn't worth using a buff skill. Taesan drew his sword and moved forward.

Quaddup!

He cut off his arm and threw it away. The giant used its entire body to pressure Taesan, and Taesan lightly swung his sword to counterattack.

Kwaaang!

Just that was enough to shake the giant's body. Taesan swung his sword and struck the arm that had escaped from the darkness.

[You have activated Collapse.]

The power that flowed through the sword collapsed the giant's physical body.

The giant struggled and resisted, but it was meaningless in the face of overwhelming power. In an instant, everything about the giant collapsed and disappeared.

Sosiet, who had lost all her cards, was left alone in the room.

Taesan rushed towards her. Sosiet did not resist.

Puff.

The sword pierced her chest.

Kuuuuung!

[Sosiet took 34123 damage.] [Sosiet activated Necromancy. Sosiet's HP was fixed at 0, and her race changed to Undead.]

"I thought so. It seems I still can't do it with my power. You win."

Sosiet said, bleeding from the corner of her mouth. Taesan pulled out his sword."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Although I survived with my skills, that was all. I couldn't feel any more power from Sosiet.

Taesan deliberately didn't finish her off. The ghost stepped forward.

[……Sosiet.]

"Badley."

Sosiet laughed.

"He's your sword, isn't he?"

[No, this guy isn't my tool.]

The ghost denied Sosiet's words.

"……That's a really interesting thing to say. Do you remember? Back then, you were very arrogant. You looked down on everyone. You felt a sense of camaraderie with me, but you never saw me as an equal."

Sosiet chuckled.

"It's funny that you're acknowledging others now. Your time with him has changed you quite a bit."

[A lot of time has passed. I've been buried in my grave, thinking a lot. I'm no longer the prince you thought I was.]

"Is that so? In the end, I've become a being of the past to you. That's sad."

[You killed me.]

The ghost's voice was calm.

[No matter what emotions you had or how you thought of me, that won't change. Farewell, Sosiet.]

Sosiet was the ghost's target.

It was time for the long quest to come to an end.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Sosiet smiled faintly.

"I'm sorry, but it can't be like that."

Ku-u-ung!

The labyrinth shook in an instant.

Taesan swiftly swung his sword, but the mortal couldn't even react at that speed.

Ki-i-i-ing!

However, he couldn't reach her. A translucent barrier protected Sosiet.

"He's the one who took down numerous high-ranking officials alone. I knew from the start that I couldn't win against him. But I couldn't just back down, could I?"

Sosiet stood up.

She laughed brightly, stretching her hand towards the sky.

"Descend upon us! Great being! Please come down to this place for your purpose!"

Ku-r-r-ung!

The space ripped apart, and a massive existence settled into the labyrinth.

[The God of Desire, Exirea, has descended.]

A thick, overwhelming presence filled the labyrinth.

Taesan instinctively kept his guard up against Exirea.

The God of Desire. It was the first time he had seen a transcendent being. And the wizard had said that many transcendent beings wished for Taesan's death.

The transcendent being in front of him might be one of those gods.

It was the moment Taesan was about to summon his power.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not that I came to kill you. Adventurer. I'm not interested in that kind of thing."

Exirea's voice echoed.

"I came here to test you."

"This is my last card. What about it?"

Sosiet smiled faintly.

But neither the ghost nor Taesan were surprised.

The descent of the Transcender. It was an expected event to some extent.

"It's similar to the Lion King."

The Lion King did the same. He knew he couldn't defeat Taesan with his own power, so he offered himself to the God of Destruction and asked for cooperation.

"But it doesn't matter now. You no longer hold great significance to me."

The ghost spoke in a calm tone, as if it had finished settling its mind.

Instead of being shocked or angry, Sosiet smiled.

"Didn't I say so? This is insufficient. Did you think I would fight with such an ordinary method?"

Sosiet stumbled and placed her hand on the ground.

The thick darkness that had spread all around began to gather and concentrate under her hand.

"Bardley. Do you remember your own death?"

"You stabbed me with a dagger that dealt fixed damage while I was resting, didn't you? It's something I already know."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No. That's a story you heard from someone else after you died. You died in your sleep without even realizing it."

Sosiet hummed.

"I'm a necromancer. A person who handles corpses. A ghost. Is your corpse really buried in that grave?"

[……You?]

The ghost's voice was filled with surprise.

Sosiet's smile deepened at his attitude.

"With me. My prince."

The corpse appeared in the darkness. Taesan scrunched up his face.

The corpse had platinum hair.

It was a well-balanced body. Except for a small scar on his chest, it was extremely clean. Despite the corpse's expressionless face, an undeniable nobility was visible.

Taesan had seen that face before.

[Ah…….]

The ghost let out a sigh. The system window told them the truth.

[The prince of the destroyed world, Bardley's corpse has appeared.]

* * *

Seeing one's own corpse with one's own eyes was not an easy experience. The ghost barely opened his mouth.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You're... crazy.]"

"I told you, didn't I? I'll make you unforgettable."

Sosiet laughed brightly.

"Do you want to know an even more surprising fact? Bardley. Your corpse is alive."

It was just as she said. The ghost's body was beating, and its face showed a lively energy unique to the living.

"I'm a necromancer. It's not difficult to give life to the dead. Since it doesn't have a soul, it can't move, but... if it only has a soul, it can open its eyes and move again."

It could be revived again.

But the ghost didn't look happy.

[You don't seem like you'll do that.]

"That's right."

Sosiet also nodded in agreement.

"Originally, I was going to put your soul back in your body and force you to fight with him, but you've changed a lot since traveling with him. You're no longer the prince I remember."

Sosiet twisted her lips.

"Although the desire to fulfill your wish remains, you can't sincerely kill and be killed, can you?"

[…….]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But you were different in the past. Back then, you looked down on everyone and saw them as beneath you, didn't you? You thought of yourself as a tool to achieve your desires."

Sosiet placed his hand on his chest.

"What's necessary for the body to move is the soul. It doesn't have to be your soul."

Sosiet knelt down before Exirea.

"Please, God of Desire."

[You are magnificent. You're willing to sacrifice everything for love and desire. As the God of Desire, I will gladly grant your request.] [Exirea's beloved is activated. Exirea's interference domain decreases.] [It's perfect. God and vessel. You, who are between them. This is my trial. Prove your power to me.]

Exirea's voice resounded.

Something inside Sosiet began to escape.

Taesan could sense that it was his soul.

Sosiet's power and strength, everything, began to plummet mercilessly, dropping to the level of a ordinary mortal in an instant.

"What's holding you back is your past self."

His soul was being stolen. Despite the excruciating pain, Sosiet didn't erase his smile.

"You can't absolutely forget me. My prince."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Finally, everything about Sosiet was absorbed into Exirea.

At the same time, Exirea's power descended upon Bardley.

"Huff."

A short while later, the sound of heavy breathing was heard.

Bardley's body opened its eyes. He scrunched up his face.

"......Where am I?"

[Ha.]

The ghost couldn't help but let out a dry laugh.

[The prince of the destroyed world, Bardley has appeared.]"

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
