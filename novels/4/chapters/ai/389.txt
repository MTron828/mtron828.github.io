Chapter 390

390. The Sixth Return to Earth (7)

God descended to the earth.

The players who had experienced it before were not greatly surprised. They knelt down and paid homage to God.

However, Russia and India were not able to accept it.

"Oh, oh..."

"Are you God..."

They stared at Maria in awe. The giant woman seemed to be exuding an aura as if she were from another dimension.

The players who felt fear and unease trembled with their bodies and bowed their heads.

Maria spoke calmly to them.

"Do not worry. I did not come to harm you. Instead, I came to protect you."

Maria's power enveloped the people. The gaze that could lead to death by simply looking at it was blocked by Maria's power and disappeared.

"Thank you."

The mountain (Tai Shan) expressed gratitude quietly. The deadly gaze was of no use to Tai Shan, but it was not the case for other players. It was a great relief, and it was all thanks to Maria.
Here is the translation of the text:

[They had also made up their minds. They had already decided to send it down.]

"Do you know what that is?"

[I very well know it.]

Maria looked at something she couldn't identify and opened her mouth.

[It's not easy for gods to interfere directly in the world. So they created spirits to destroy the world on their behalf. This is one of those spirits.]

" Spirit...".

I Taeyoung, who was listening to the conversation beside her, muttered to herself. Maria's voice was only audible to Kang Taesan and I Taeyoung.

Maria continued speaking.

[Especially, this spirit is one that has survived for a long time among the spirits. Its power is not exceptional among the gods' spirits, but its abilities are quite formidable and difficult to handle. It has always been a thorn in our side.]

Maria looked at the spirit with a scornful gaze. But she soon smiled.

[That thorn will be over today. I also have no intention of getting involved in the battle like the others.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Maria quietly retreated. With a voice full of expectation, she said to Tai Shan:

"Show me. Show me your power."

"That's what I thought."

Tai Shan took a step forward. People held their breath, watching his movements.

A loud sound echoed.

Sado looked at Tai Shan, who was approaching him, without saying a word. He closed the system window that had been announcing the defense of the instantaneous death attack.

"I knew that such a day would come, but I didn't think it would come so soon."

The monster that had killed Ita-yeon and driven himself to death.

In reality, he had played a decisive role in bringing about the destruction of the world.

Tai Shan revealed this. The ghost was slightly startled. Tai Shan had been by his side for a long time, but he had never shown such intense emotions.

"You may not remember me, but... it doesn't matter. This is my revenge."

Tai Shan turned back time.

From one perspective, his anger and emotions may have been misguided. This was an event that had not occurred in this world.

But it didn't matter. This was his revenge. Tai Shan summoned his power.
Here is the translation of the text:

The opponent is a monster that has defeated oneself. One does not slack off or make mistakes. From the start, one goes all out.

[The opponent is a formidable enemy who is hard to defeat.] [You are fighting again with your life against the existence that has defeated you. You have obtained the special skill "Vengeful Spirit".] [Your Vengeful Spirit has been activated.] [Your nemesis has been activated.] [Your anti-theory has been activated.] [You have activated the Unyielding Spirit.]

The activation window of the skill suddenly appears. In an instant, one's physical strength and combat power surpass even the previous level.

[You have activated the Avatar of Nature.] [You have activated the Vessel of the King.] [You have activated the Cardinal Sin [Darkness of Chaos].]

With the increased strength and physical power, one's body and combat power are amplified once again.

One realizes that one is truly just one step away from reaching the level of the Immortal.

"Then... let's do it."

The mountain trembled. The monster responded with a mighty roar, causing its body to tremble.

The energy clashed, causing the earth and sky to begin to collapse.

* * *

"Oooo..."

"Lord Taesan..."

People are shocked and offer prayers.

Everything was shattered.
Here is the translation:

The sky is torn apart and the mountains are destroyed. The earth collapses and creates a massive crater.

It was as if they had the power to annihilate the world itself.

The players of the three kingdoms prayed to the Great Mountain. Russia and India were shocked.

And Iteyan was looking at Maria with a puzzled expression.

Maria was gazing at her quietly. The divine form showing interest in herself made Iteyan extremely anxious.

[The flow of time is indeed a mysterious thing.]

"Yes, yes?"

[No, let's just watch for now. This is the next story.]

"Ah, yes......"

Iteyan turned her attention to the battle in front of her. Maria was the same.

What's important now is the Great Mountain and the apostle of the High God.

[Hmmm.]

The earth was shaking and everything was crumbling.

Their power itself was not that extraordinary. It was clear that it could reach immortality, but compared to Maria herself, it was far inferior.

However, the type and direction of their power were the problem.

The Great Mountain was extremely unique.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the world watched, even the gods who had lived for an eternity did not notice the existence of this being.

[How could such a being exist?]

The voice filled with doubts was drowned out by the rumble of battle.

Wah!

The Great Mountain brandished its sword. The shape of the Deva was shaken by a strong shock.

The Great Mountain was overpowering the Deva. As the Deva was unable to use its hands and was forced back, its appearance began to change.

The Deva could change its appearance into a being that had been defeated. Now, it was the real deal.

Gurgle.

The Deva's appearance transformed into a shape like a god, holding a halberd.

The halberd was swung. At the same time, the space where the Great Mountain existed was about to be severed.

Severing of space.

The former life had no way to respond and had to consume all counterattacks. However, it was no longer the case. The Great Mountain had gathered mana.

[You have activated the distortion.]

Kaahahah!

The collision between the severing of space and the distortion caused a collapse. The Great Mountain, who had blocked the severing, retreated and swung its hand.

[You have activated the arrow of the storm of non-phenomenon.]

The black stormy line flew towards the Deva.

Note: The text appears to be a fantasy story, and some terms like "태산" (Great Mountain), "사도" (Deva), and "비사고" (non-phenomenon) are not directly translatable and may have specific meanings within the context of the story.
Here is the translation of the text:

The arrow that can pierce through everything has changed into the form of a giant shield-wielding warrior. The shield collided with the arrow.

Kaaa!

The sound of the collision and the warrior's body were pushed backward. The warrior gripped his shield with all his might and pushed it forward. As the shield shattered, the arrow exploded.

Meanwhile, Taesan had already moved behind the warrior.

The warrior's appearance changed. He wielded a battle-axe in both hands, taking on a savage form.

The axe and sword clashed.

[You have activated acceleration.] [You have activated strength.]

Kagak!

Metal clashed, and sparks filled the air. Taesan did not yield to the warrior's attack and counterattacked.

In his previous life, he would have had to flee and sacrifice his life to avoid the transformed warrior's attack, but now he could face him head-on.

Taesan's sword turned golden. With a sword imbued with holy power, he struck the battle-axe. The battle-axe began to glow with golden light.

Kaaa!

The warrior's body was sent flying backward. Taesan charged forward immediately.

[You have activated acceleration.]

The warrior's physical body changed again. He held a staff and wore a robe, taking on the form of a wizard.

Taesan responded immediately upon seeing this.
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have activated the magic layer.] [You have activated the frozen world.] [You have activated the starlight arrow.] [You have activated the bird of unquenchable flames.]

Coldness, light, and flames converge into one. Tai Shan released the power as is.

[You have activated magic release.] [You have activated magic concentration.]

The gathering of magic exploded towards the demon.

The demon's staff moved, and a dense wave of mana erupted. The collision of power and power began to collapse the space.

[You have activated limited blink.]

Tai Shan, who had moved to the demon's head, fell rapidly.

[You have activated landing.]

The demon tried to transform into a form to respond to Tai Shan's attack, but Tai Shan's sword was already within striking distance. As a last resort, the demon grasped its staff, but Tai Shan's sword sliced through it.

[Damage to !#$!#.]

Snap.

A painful shockwave rang out.

The demon's body began to swell instantly. It seemed that the power was about to explode at any moment.

And then, the power burst forth, sweeping the surroundings, but Tai Shan was already gone from the spot.

[You have activated designated mark acceleration.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae San was moving beyond the scope of the explosion. It was as if he knew the limits of his power and was acting accordingly, and indeed he was.

"I'm sorry, but this is the third time."

He had experienced it once in his previous life.

And once in the trials of the God of Despair.

Tae San had already fought with the Sado several times. The memories and experiences from those times were still vivid in his mind.

He already knew what abilities Sado possessed and what he used. It was all clear to him.

Gulp.

Sado had changed. Just looking at him was enough to make Tae San's mind reel in horror. All sorts of mental judgments were being made about Tae San.

"Don't pass through."

Tae San easily deflected Sado's attack and charged at him again.

[You have activated the solid stone of the Grief.]

The sky opened up and the stone plummeted towards Sado like a meteor.

Sado's appearance changed into that of a woman holding a bow as large as her body. She drew the bowstring tightly and fired an arrow towards the stone.

Zzzt, zzzt!

The arrow pierced the stone and it shattered, crumbling into pieces.

Among the crumbling fragments, Tae San charged forward.

Sado drew the bowstring again and fired an arrow at Tae San.

Tae San put his strength into his legs and sprinted towards the arrow.

[You have activated forced exclusion.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Ki-i-ing!

The mana of the abyss pushes the arrow forward. The arrow resists and struggles, but can't hold out for long and is repelled.

The great sage, who has reached the peak of the Tao, unsheathes his sword. He is not affected by the current situation. However, he is not concerned about it. He is capable of striking the sage.

Quack quack.

[Damage dealt to #@$%#!.]

The sage's body sways.

The great sage reveals this.

It's certain.

If he were the same as now, he could have defeated the sage. He could have defeated the existence that defeated him in his previous life.

He has become that strong now.

The great sage gripped his sword tightly, aiming for the sage's weakness.

That moment was.

The sage's appearance changed once again. While the change was continuous, it was not a particularly unusual thing.

However, the great sage was shocked.

The changed appearance of the sage was strange.

The skin was blue. It didn't give off a sense of humanity, and it was extremely unpleasant. The gentle smile was warm. He had four arms.

It was a shape that couldn't be called human. It was a change that was unknown to the great sage's memories.

It wasn't just that.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the apostles changed, they felt a different level of dignity than before.

"Ah, ah..."

The faces of the Indian players turned pale. They knelt down as if in despair.

"Snort."

The mountain's mouth was agape.

"That's it. It's unlikely that's all there is."

Maria said that this apostle had destroyed many worlds and had been a thorn in their sides for a long time.

However, the current mountain had not yet become immortal. Although there were means to temporarily reach it, it had not been used.

Even for the mountain that had been pressed down, it was impossible to survive while destroying multiple worlds and pleasing the gods.

"The power of a mortal is enough to kill in a past life, so it wasn't used, I suppose."

Even if the mountain of the past was strong, it couldn't reach the level of an immortal. There was no reason to use the power of an immortal.

The trials of the god of downfall were achieved through his memories, so he couldn't see the current apostle's appearance.

The apostle could change his appearance to that of a being he had killed.
Here is the translation:

And the apostle is a being that destroys the world.

Among the guardians of the world, there were also immortals.

The apostle has transformed into the form of the immortals he had killed while he was in the process of destroying the world.

[The opponent is an enemy who is impossible to defeat.]
