Chapter 294

294. The Iron Barrier to Protect the World. Shaman (2)

The swords clashed.

The large sword swung and shattered the air. The double-edged sword moved swiftly, as if about to explode, and struck down the large sword.

Kkakkk!

Taesan used his superior stats to pressure Shaman, and Shaman countered with his combat experience, which he had accumulated through countless battles.

"Kkeeng."

Mynerva watched the ensuing battle with a scowl on her face.

"There's nothing I can do......"

Her power was ineffective against Shaman. She occasionally tried to restrain him, but even her gaze couldn't reach him. Since she couldn't cause any harm, there was no need to be cautious.

"Is that a maze adventurer?"

She was amazed.

Although he was not in a perfect state and was still rough around the edges, he was able to overwhelm himself, the Lord of the Spirits, to this extent.

And she was astonished. Taesan and Shaman. Both of them.

Kkakkk!

The swords clashed again. The movements were extreme, with no gaps to be found, and the actions were almost perfect.
Here is the translation of the text:

Minerva was a spirit king. She had the thought that the spirit's power was the most outstanding power in the world to some extent.

But even for her, the battle in front of her was beautiful.

Kaang!

The swords clashed and flew apart. Taesan straightened his posture and rushed at Shaman. He ignored defense and attacked, but Shaman hesitated to swing his sword.

"Ugh!"

He bit his tongue and pulled out his greatsword to defend against Taesan's attack.

Taesan broke through the defense roughly.

[Shaman took 7034 damage.]

"I'm getting angry."

The attack shown by Taesan was absolute nullification.

He was guarding against the third one.

Shaman thought that the first nullification was over. He thought it was impossible to have multiple skills, so he didn't think about the second one.

But there was the second one. There was no reason for the third one not to exist.

Shaman decided to confirm the existence of nullification and Taesan's goal was simple.

Taesan was trying to apply the most pressure before Shaman confirmed it.

[You have activated absolute judgment.] [You have activated the frozen world.] [You have activated magic focus.]

Zheezeze!
Here is the translation of the text:

The waves of the fierce cold crash directly onto the shore. The power contained within them can freeze everything solid. Shaman's face contorted as he drew his sword.

[Shaman activated his Crush ability.]

Kuuuung!

A tremendous explosion occurred. The frozen world was shattered by the sword.

"This can be used in magic too. How ridiculous."

[You activated your Piercing Shot ability.] [You activated your Absolute Judgment ability.] [You activated your Starlight Arrow ability.]

Tae-san activated his Absolute Judgment ability and used his Starlight Arrow again. Shaman tried to dodge, but the Starlight Arrow was chasing him relentlessly, as if it would surely hit him.

Shaman's pupils dilated. He covered his body with his sword.

Just as the Starlight was about to touch the sword, Tae-san clenched his fist.

[You activated your Magic Separation ability.]

The scattered light arrows pummeled Shaman's entire body.

[Shaman took 1032 damage.] [Shaman took 932 damage.] [Shaman took 1023 damage.]

"Aaaah!"

Shaman's center was shaken by the impact. Tae-san didn't miss the opportunity and activated his Acceleration ability. Shaman barely managed to swing his sword as it was being struck down.

Zeeeung!

"Umm..."
(Note: The translation is literal and may not be perfect. The text appears to be a scene from a fantasy story or game, and some of the terms and abilities may not be easily translatable.)
Here is the translation of the text:

The Shaman has been pushed back again. His stance is crumbling, and his defenses are weakening. It was the moment when the Great Mountain was about to strike.

The Shaman has activated his counterattack. The Shaman has launched a powerful blow that can split the mountain.

The Shaman's great sword has been lowered.

The Great Mountain was shocked by the Shaman's speed, which is much faster than anything he has shown before. The Great Mountain's body was twisted and he dodged the sword attack.

The Great Mountain focused on defense, and the Shaman attacked him with his sword.

Ka ka ka!

The Great Mountain was pushed back. The Shaman was about to charge forward, but instead, he quietly frowned.

He couldn't attack freely because of the possibility of his attack being neutralized.

"It's a waste, but there's nothing I can do."

The Shaman muttered to himself. He opened a space and took out a small arrow.

"Go."

The arrow was shot at the Great Mountain with a speed that broke the sound barrier.

[You have activated your true understanding.] [Penetrating arrow] [This arrow is bound to hit.]

The explanation is brief, but the content is not simple.

The arrow let out a "ping" sound as it targeted the Great Mountain's weaknesses from all directions. The Great Mountain focused his mind.

Kuuu!

The Shaman didn't stay still either. He charged forward and pressured the Great Mountain.

Ping!
Here is the translation of the text:

The arrow is chasing Tai Shan.

Tai Shan blocked Shaman's attack and activated dark magic.

[You have absolutely determined the judgment.] [You have activated Mephisto's black lightning.]

Kururung!

The lightning struck Shaman's body. Although it was just a slight scratch, impossible to see with the naked eye, and not a weak spot, Shaman froze. Tai Shan swung his sword at the arrow flying straight at him.

Just as the sword was about to cut the arrow, the arrow jumped through space.

The sword missed and pierced Tai Shan's shoulder instead.

[Your third attack has been rendered invalid.]

The arrow, having completed its task, disappeared. Tai Shan's eyes widened.

"Is it a direct hit?"

There's no way to dodge it. The inevitable arrow. It seems that even such a thing exists.

And Shaman laughed mockingly.

"It's ridiculous. There's another one."

However, the third one is not the end. There is still a possibility.

Tai Shan, who had created the third invalidation, was unable to create any more, but Shaman couldn't help but think that way.

Ka ka!
Here is the translation of the text:

As the battle continued, Taesan was cautious of the arrow shot by Piljung. However, Shamun did not take out any more arrows.

There was no reason to not take them out. For Shamun, the most important thing was to confirm the invalidation of the attack. Nevertheless, not taking them out meant that the arrow was nonexistent.

Taesan didn't know that the arrow was one of the rewards from the depths, and it was only usable once and then would disappear. Therefore, it was finally used after being stored for a long time.

Taesan pressured Shamun without being aware of the arrow.

[You have absolutely triggered judgment.]

Ka, ka, ka!

The sword clashed.

Every time it clashed, absolute judgment was used. The consumption of mana was barely 10. It could be used anytime.

Kiki!

The sword was bent. The great sword was scraped and its trajectory was disrupted.

Shamun allowed the attack.

[Shamun took 6943 damage.] [Shamun activated the devastating blow that splits the mountain.]

The great sword came down and hit Taesan. Taesan blocked it with his sword.

Ka, ka, ka!

A powerful force pressed down on Taesan. Taesan's knee slightly bent.

"'That's quite tricky.'"

Note: The text appears to be a scene from a video game or a fantasy story, and the translation is based on the context and the language used.
Here is the translation of the text:

He swung the great sword with incredible strength. Seeing his stats far surpassing those of Shamans, it seemed that the skill attached to the great sword, which was similar to the shield of the spirit king, was being used. The cooldown time was short, and he continued to use it. As a result, he was not able to gain any advantage.

"Ah..."

And Shaman was completely bewildered.

None of the leaders in the party could easily break through his defense. He was also unable to deal a decisive blow to them, but he had never been defeated once.

His defense was absolute.

As he descended into the labyrinth, even ordinary monsters were unable to deal any damage to him. There was no difference between them and bosses. When he received damage, it was only when he was accepting the trials of the gods.

He trusted himself. Therefore, he focused on defense and obtained skills mainly for defense, increasing his proficiency.

However, all of this meant nothing.

"Unbelievable. Really."

Everything he had built up was broken by a single skill. It was a ridiculous situation.

The equipment he was wearing, excluding the sword, was all focused on defense and health rather than attack power. He had a significantly higher health than other party leaders.

Even he, who was that strong, was on the verge of death from a single hit.
Here is the translation of the text:

If he didn't have that skill, he would have indeed fallen.

The opponent's defense was useless. He had to fight with his strongest card discarded.

But he was a seasoned adventurer who had gone deep into the depths.

He calmly assessed the situation.

"'My skill proficiency is on my side.'"

And it's not the worst situation.

Among the cards he had, there were still things he could use.

[Shaman unleashed the infinite regeneration wind.] [Shaman unleashed the whisper of blue-green grass.] [Shaman unleashed the conversion of shielding and regeneration.]

Kaang!

The spear clashed. Shaman, who had been defending, suddenly rushed towards Tai Shan like a madman, abandoning his defensive stance.

[Shaman unleashed a devastating blow that could split a mountain.]

Tai Shan responded. He drew his sword and unleashed his ability sword.

[You unleashed a dodge.]

The opponent's attack, which had hit the sword, was dodged. However, it was crushed by force. Tai Shan quickly dodged to the side.

Kuuuung!

The great spear struck the ground. Shaman's opening was exposed, but Shaman's stance was quickly corrected.

[Shaman unleashed a rebalancing.]

Note: The text appears to be a scene from a fantasy novel or game, with elements of magic and combat. The translation is aimed at conveying the narrative and emotions of the scene rather than providing a detailed analysis of the combat or magical abilities described.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's too annoying."

Regardless of the situation, he adjusts his posture immediately. The blow that splits the mountain is so powerful that it surpasses Shaman's strength and speed, revealing Shaman's weakness. That weakness disappeared after being re-established.

But it doesn't matter. It's not impossible to break through.

He charges forward.

[You have unleashed a fierce blow.]

Ka ka ka!

The swords clash. Shaman's body is pushed back due to the effects of the fierce blow.

He loses his balance and allows an attack.

[Shaman takes 8343 damage.]

At first, Shaman was pushed back by the increased power of the sword. However, after allowing a few attacks, he realized the timing of the sword clash and initialized the fierce blow.

If you can reach the level of deep understanding, you can respond to the ability sword. Tai Shan confirmed this.

Zzzz!

Close combat begins. Shaman moves the great sword.

His wrist is bent, and the sword is shaken. The great sword moves with a mysterious, weightless motion.

The mastery of extreme swordsmanship. Only those who can completely dominate this swordsmanship can see this wonder.

Phew.
Here is the translation of the text:

The swords of Taesan and Shaman pierce each other's shoulders.

[Shaman takes 7543 damage.] [You take 2043 damage.]

Both parties take damage. After barely exchanging blows over a dozen times, Shaman reveals this.

"There's nothing more to it."

He charges forward.

[Shaman has activated the "Wild Winds" skill.]

The sword flashes like a storm, and Taesan attempts to dodge it. However, due to the effects of the skill, it doesn't have much of an impact.

Clang!

The two swords pierce each other.

[You have activated the "Frozen World" and "Starlight Arrow" skills.] [You have activated the "Crushing Suppression" skill.]

Two spells are unleashed simultaneously. Shaman swings his sword.

[Shaman has activated the "Crushing Suppression" skill.]

Kugugung!

Taesan is crushed by the force. The light arrows and snowballs are crushed and broken, and Taesan focuses its will.

"Come at me."

Pika!

Several arrows burst forth. The arrows controlled by will target Shaman's entire body.

Shaman quickly makes a decision. Since it's impossible to block all the attacks, he decides not to worry about it.

Pabak!
Here is the translation of the text:

The arrow pierced Shaman's chest. Although each individual damage was not significant, it accumulated to an unbearable level.

Despite being in a advantageous situation, Taesan frowned.

The damage Shaman suffered exceeded 10,000.

Ordinary adventurers would have collapsed long ago, and it would be normal.

Even if he was a deep-level adventurer, it would not have made a difference. He had elevated his physical strength to a level similar to that of other adventurers through his ascension. Even Itealyeon, who had a limit to his physical strength, would not have been able to withstand Shaman's 10,000 physical strength.

There was no opportunity to use potions. It was impossible for his physical strength to reach 10,000 without using potions.

Most importantly, Shaman's battle style changed.

Shaman began to fail to properly defend against Taesan's attacks. It was as if he thought, "No matter how many times I'm attacked, as long as I can inflict a single critical hit, I'll gain an advantage."

In reality, it was quite tough. The critical hit attack using a great axe was something that even Taesan could not easily counter.

"'Physical Recovery Skill.'"

A skill that recovers physical strength in proportion to the received damage, or a skill that recovers physical strength as the battle continues on.
Here is the translation of the text:

There was an expected part. Shaman used various skills when facing Tai Shan for the first time.

Among them, there were also skills that seemed to be recovery skills.

[Shaman activated the regeneration of crisis.] [Shaman activated the forced damage conversion.] [Shaman activated the blessing of distorted regeneration.]

Although the detailed effects are unknown, it is likely that these skills have recovery effects. Additionally, they also possess skills that can be constantly activated.

There was a possibility that the life recovery skills would exceed ten.

And the skills used during the battle.

"'Transition of Protection and Regeneration'."

Based on the name of the skill, it is likely that it is a skill that converts defense power or its effect into life recovery.

It was almost impossible to reduce vitality in a normal way.

One should not think of exchanging blows and winning. Instead, one must pour everything out in an instant.

Tai Shan determined the outcome and gathered his magic.

[You activated the Wolf's Authority.]

A wolf formed as a spirit materialized. Shaman swung his sword to try to shake it off, but the wolf bit down and clung tightly.

[You activated the Spark of Disaster.]
Note: The text appears to be a narrative or scenario from a game, and some parts may require context or knowledge of the game to fully understand.
Here is the translation of the text:

A calamitous flame bursts forth. Shamani pushes away the wolf and brandishes his sword in a stance. The flame splits.

The mountain of time opens a channel, gathering strength.

[You have activated Naberius's golden sword.]

"Minerva."

"Alright, I'll do my best for this final showdown!"

Minerva gathers strength together with the wind. The wind condenses and condenses to form a solid body.

The remaining strength gathered in the wind body. Can Shamani even bear this? Shamani assumes a defensive stance.

"As a spirit king, I cannot just go on."

Minerva's body disappears with a faint smile. The mountain of time charges towards Shamani.

Shamani's pupils suddenly expand.

He instinctively brandishes his sword behind his back.

"Ack!"

The great sword pierces Minerva's chest.

However, she does not disappear.

She endures the pain and laughs.

"Definitely impressive. But... the one who will win is my master."

She swings the wind in her hand towards Shamani.

A gust of wind envelops Shamani.
Here is the translation of the text:

The wind that encircled Shaman was blown away by the wind, scattering everything it touched and sending it flying. The remaining strength of the spirit king was poured into the wind, which was powerful enough to blow Shaman away like a leaf.

Tai Shan drew his golden-edged sword to meet the incoming Shaman.

[Shaman took 24103 points of damage.]

Although the damage was relatively low due to the cooldown of the transformation and the sword's spirit, it was still enough to shake Shaman's physical body.

"Ah!"

[Shaman activated his "Recovery" ability.]

Shaman endured the pain and activated his "Recovery" ability, returning to a fighting stance and preparing to counterattack Tai Shan.

Phew!

However, the wind that had surrounded Shaman exploded again.

Shaman, who did not expect it to explode again, was caught off guard and failed to respond.

The sword struck Shaman's chest again.

Quack!

[Shaman took 9103 points of damage.]

He did not back down.

Tai Shan began to swing his sword while pressing his body against it.

Shaman's face turned stiff.

The damage entered Shaman's body in an instant, and his physical strength, which was originally 25,000, decreased by two-thirds.

The situation is now critical. Although his physical strength recovers quickly, it still takes some time.

Tai Shan was convinced by Shaman's sudden reaction. This was the correct answer.
Here is the translation of the text:

Kagaga!

Continuously, he is being chased. He dodges the whirling great sword and puts his hand on Shamans' armor.

[You have activated the despair's branch.]

"Eh!"

Suddenly, all sorts of despairing emotions flow into Shamans' mind. He quickly activates the adventurer's will to resist, but allows himself to be hit again.

Shamans becomes agitated.

First, Shamans charges forward to shake the mountain.

[Shamans has activated the storm gallop.]

He dashes forward like a storm, pushing the mountain.

However, the mountain does not retreat by even a single step.

Instead, it binds itself to Shamans, exchanging blows.

[Shamans takes 8534 damage.] [You take 1532 damage.]

Until now, Shamans has gladly received the exchange of damage. He is able to recover slightly with a little time, but the mountain is not.

However, the situation has changed now. The mountain does not give him time to recover.

Shamans wildly swings his sword.

[Shamans has activated the one-hit kill attack.] [You have activated the dark black spear of Ammon.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"Zhee-ee-ung!"

The sword and spear clashed and rebounded from each other. Shaman, who did not expect his own attack to be repelled, hastily activated his defensive magic, but allowed himself to be hit again.

[You have triggered the world's freeze!] [You have triggered the starlight arrow!]

The arrow of cold and light exploded.

Magics continued to erupt. Mana was consumed at a rapid pace. Shaman realized that it was getting difficult to withstand and tried to stall for time by kicking the mountain. The mountain was kicked and floated into the air.

[You have triggered landing.]

Kaga-ga-ga!

"Eunim!"

Shaman's stance was shattered by the sword, which had fallen from the sky with even greater force than before.

The mountain that had landed on the ground now lifted Shaman up.

Quu-ddeu.

[You have triggered jumping.]

Shaman's body rose into the air. The mountain activated its magic. The dark wave of Marbas. The black wave engulfed all sides.

Shaman's vision was blocked, but it didn't matter. As an adventurer of that level, he could have detected the enemy's position and actions even with his eyes closed.

[You have triggered concealment.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"But all signs of the Great Mountain have vanished."

Shaman quickly grasped the situation. He couldn't sense his opponent's location.

"'Anyway!'"

He was a deep-level adventurer.

He had overcome all hardships and obstacles to arrive here. There was a time when he broke through the layers solely relying on his instincts. Even if he couldn't sense his opponent, he believed in his instincts and it was possible.

He closed his eyes, swinging his sword according to his instincts.

The sword sliced through the air without a sound.

"Whoosh."

The Great Mountain's sword pierced through his back and into his chest.
