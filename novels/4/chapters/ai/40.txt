41. 6th Floor, Humble One Seeking Magic (Part 3)

To learn magic, one must offer sacrifices. Taesan rummaged through his inventory.

"What about these?"

Taesan pulled out items he obtained from defeating the lizardmen. They were mostly mediocre items that weren't much different from the ones he currently wore.

Lilith examined the equipment closely and clicked her tongue.

"They'll do, but... with this, you won't be able to cast even a single spell."

"Isn't this quite a lot?"

"These are for magic. Quantity alone won't do. It needs to be something more valuable, something unique."

"Can't it be easier?"

If learning magic were this simple, everyone would have learned it already. But even Itaeyeon didn't learn it. Taesan shifted his gaze towards the equipment he was wearing.

"What about this?"

Taesan showed Valtar's earring. Lilith still looked uncertain.

"It's alright, but... this alone isn't enough. You'll need at least two pieces of equipment of equal caliber."

"Then how about this one?"
This time, he shows a necklace obtained when capturing the Goblin Lord. Surprise appeared on Lilith's face.

"Oh? That doesn't seem like equipment you can get here."

"So what?"

"It's valuable enough. Maybe for a basic spell?"

"Could be."

"Really? I thought you were pretty relaxed about these things."

The Lord's item equals about a basic spell. At the outset, this trading idea may come as something of an insult. Taesan took out Rocky Lattes's sword.

"What about this?"

"Hmm..."

Lilith opened her mouth with a sulky face.

"They should appreciate it a lot... Even if the value is down, it could be a little better For had
Taesan found an item while rummaging through his inventory.

"How about this?"

[Old Oak Staff] [Magic +3] [Contains a faint magical power. It seems usable for a talented person.]

Equipment obtained when capturing the Goblin Chief. Taesan, unfamiliar with magic, noticed stats attached to it for the first time. After confirming the equipment, Lilith nodded.

"This should work. It should just about cover a basic spell."

"Is this on par with the Lord's necklace?"

"Not exactly, but it's different from a tribute perspective. Gods prefer items associated with themselves. Unless it can impress someone like Rocky Lattes's sword, they value items related to magic more."

That's settled then.

Honestly, it was a close call.

Magic was unique, so he had left it alone, unable to find a place to use it.

"What kind of magic is this?"

"Exactly what it sounds like. Holding that staff and using magic improves its power, size, duration, and judgment."
Then it's useless to Taesan. He's learning magic to use it easily during battles.

"Let's go with this one."

"Great! Got it!"

Lilith eagerly took the staff. She was about to pray for more when she hesitated.

"Oh right, nearly forgot. Any specific magic you want? Invisibility is high-value, so that's out, but others should be possible."

"I don't even know what kinds of magic there are."

"I'll show you."

She waved her hand, and a row of spells appeared before them.

[Fireball] [Frostbolt] [Invisibility] [Basic Detection] [Shielding Charm] [Food Production]

Except for Fireball and Frostbolt, all the spells were about hiding or enduring. It succinctly revealed the life Lilith led here.

"Need an explanation?"

Taesan nodded. It was better to listen carefully and decide. Lilith began to explain.

"Since you already have Fireball, let's skip that. Frostbolt is basically the same as Fireball—same power, mana consumption, just a difference in element. How about this one?"

The state of coldness is a very good condition that significantly slows down movement
It could be useful as an arrow substitute because it took on a projectile form.

"Since I can't learn Invisibility, let's go with Detection. It tells us the number and location of monsters in the next room. With this, we'll know exactly where the danger is."

She said with a sigh, but Taesan didn't need that kind of magic. He planned to clear out every room.

"And Shielding Charm. It blurs our presence. It'll safely let us pass by those with detection skills."

This one was somewhat useful. Gaining the initiative was a big advantage.

"Lastly, Food Production does just what it says. It produces tasteless water and gruel. I'd sprinkle some salt if I could, but everything here is precious."

She grumbled deeply, seemingly quite disgusted. Taesan quietly reviewed the skills.

And he made his decision.

"Food Production."

"Huh? This one? I thought you'd go for Frostbolt."

"I can always get Frostbolt later."

Frostbolt was the most frequently used magic from the staff.
Basic detection is the same. Most spells exist in staves. Invisibility is very rare but occasionally seen.

But food production was unheard of.

Most players either grew makeshift crops, hunted monster meat, or bought emergency rations for meals.

With food production, they could solve the hassle and gold consumption with minimal mana expenditure.

Skills that exist only in magic, unavailable elsewhere.

Naturally, learning it first was the right choice.

"Alright. Just wait a moment."

She closes her eyes and holds her staff. She opens her mouth and murmurs something.

An incomprehensible language flows out like a song.

The fact that Taesan and the otherworldly Lillis and spirits could converse without any problems meant it was inherently interpreted.

Yet being incomprehensible meant one of two things.

Originally not words.

He is an interpreter, or a language for those who do not respond.

[You feel a ش heard
[You obtained food production.]

With laughter, presence disappeared.

Lilith woke up with a desolate face. The staff she had in her hand had somehow disappeared.

"Huh?"

"Why. What went wrong?"

"Oh, it's not that. You just willingly allowed it. I thought you'd make me suffer a bit."

"Suffer?"

"The gods are very picky unless they permit someone. Even heroes have had a hard time learning magic."

[Different from me? I could name a god who hates this child.]

If you think about it, there are also titles that the gods like. Based on the reactions and the ghosts' words so far, the gods seemed unlikely to show hostility to him.

Taesan confirmed the magic he had achieved.

[Basic Magic: Food Production] [Mana Consumption: 5] [Summons small amounts of consumable liquids and solids. Probably tasteless.]

Now there was no need to bother eating monster meat. Disease resistance frankly needed to raise skill more.

"Do you want to learn more magic?"
"Though I have it, there's no price now. Maybe later."

I thought I could learn everything. The more I lose, the better.

"Does that mean you have to come back here again?"

"No. Once you conquer the floor, I'll come down too. There's a sort of safety zone on the recently cleared floor."

"Such a thing exists?"

Taesan was surprised. He didn't know about that. Usually, there's no need to go back up a cleared floor, and even if you do, you can just stay at the store.

"Basically hidden. No need to bother coming down here."

"That's good."

It was very annoying to go down to the deep and then go up to the sixth floor. Release waved her hand with a smile.

"See you later then! I'll be waiting for you to bring something good!"

"One thing before that."

There was something I had to ask.

"Is magic here a skill check?"

"The types are different, but if you ask which side, it's right."

"Then like a skill, can you make it without receiving it?"

"Uh...."
Release hesitated. She blurred the end of her words with a vague expression.

"In theory, it should be possible. It's a skill check after all. But I haven't heard of anyone doing it."

"If that's the case, it's fine."

It's not that it's impossible, but rather unknown. That's sufficient.

---

"Why did you ask that in the end?"

"I have an experiment in mind."

Magic is something new to acquire. Unlike skills, it's an unknown territory.

There's plenty of value in trying out various things.

First, confirm the reward of the secret room she gave.

[Ashen Boots] [Defense +4] [Movement Speed +5%] [Comfortable shoes for walking. Looks quite good.]

It's a good pair of boots with added movement speed. While it reduces attack power by 1, it's worth the exchange.

From now on, it's simple. Go down the floors with valuable items, sell them at the store, or bring them to Release to learn magic. That's how you proceed downward.

So, before that, she had thought about what to learn.

"Clang!"

Taesan blocked the Lizardman's attack and thought to himself.

"What was the damage on that?"
He probes his memories of the past. He recalls the defense and damage received back then.

And then the answer emerges.

‘Basic Attack Boss Room’

If hit without any armor, that's about the damage expected.

Taesan checks his shield.

[Shield: 35/35]

It's possible. Taesan empowers his sword. The Lizardman flies and crashes into the wall.

"Kek, keruk."

He watches quietly as the Lizardman struggles to rise. The ghost chuckles as if sensing something.

"He's up to something strange again."

"Clang."

The Lizardman, barely standing, lifts his spear with resolute eyes. Knowing he cannot win, he does not retreat.

The Lizardman, who had bravely faced death, is bewildered.

"Keruk?"

Taesan begins to remove his equipment one by one. Necklace, armor, shoes, wrist guards, and more. He stores all the defensive equipment in his inventory.

"...What's this now?"

Standing in front of the Lizardman once again, dressed in Earth's clothes just as he did when he first arrived in this world.

"Keruk?"
The Lizardman hesitates. With the head of a small reptile, he couldn't comprehend it. An adversary thought to be invincible suddenly weakening on its own. Even if it possessed high intelligence, the situation would be the same.

"Come on."

Taesan folds his arms.
