Chapter 210

210. The 51st floor, where mysterious things come to life (7)

After completing the quest, Taesan returned to the realm of the gremelin.

The forest along the way was extremely quiet. It was only natural that Taesan had already killed all of them. The ones who survived were holding their breath, waiting only for Taesan to pass by.

And so, he hated the gremelin even more.

"Ah, I'm back."

The gremelin was waiting silently outside the house. Taesan handed over the white horn of the unicorn to him.

"Ah, ahah. I really brought it back......"

He laughed dryly and fondled the white horn.

"If I combine what you've given me with what I've obtained...... I'll be able to achieve what I've always wanted."

He grasped the horn tightly.

"First, I need to give you a reward. Here, take it. It's the power I've accumulated over my lifetime."

[You have learned basic alchemy.]

"Figure it out yourself. I won't explain it any further."

Taesan nodded his head. The gremelin continued to fondle the horn and speak.
Here is the translation of the text:

"And... you've brought everything I wanted, so I should give you an even better reward, don't you think? Tell me, what do you want? I think you might want the wings of a fairy, but..."

"Can I get that too?"

The wings of a fairy that allow one to freely fly through the air. If I can definitely get them, it would be a huge advantage for an adventurer like myself. Gramlin nodded his head.

"That's alchemy. But I need a lot of materials, but since you've brought the materials, I think it's enough."

"Attractive, but... that's fine. I already have it."

"Already?"

Gramlin looked puzzled, but soon his expression changed.

"It's the place made by the dragon...?"

"Yes, so I don't need it from you."

"So, what do you want?"

"Hmm..."

At this moment, he didn't have anything to complain about as he had already overcome the current obstacle. The only thing he had left was the problem of the fairy's wings, which had been resolved.

After a moment of thought, Tai Shan opened his mouth.

"I'd like to increase my attack power or defense. Is that possible?"

His current attack power was already high enough. However, since most of the enemies he was facing were from lower levels, the damage reduction due to defense was significant.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san wanted to solve the problem. As Tae-san spoke, Gremory stroked his chin.

"Attack power... impossible... but not impossible."

"Possible?"

"But then it would be made into equipment. Which part do you want?"

"Ring."

Tae-san replied immediately. Gremory seemed to have expected this and went into the house.

"Follow me."

Tae-san followed him into the house.

The interior was familiar, but it seemed more vivid than before. Except for a few necessary furniture, everything else was a tool for alchemy.

"Give me one of the rings you have."

Tae-san took out the ring.

[Ring with a deep scar] [Attack power + 20] [A ring with an indescribable scar that has been carved by the owner's aura. The aura imbued in the scar curses all approaching things.]

It was a ring that had been used for a long time. To someone else, it would be a useless ring, but Tae-san was using it effectively.

Gremory looked at the ring with a puzzled expression.

"The value of the ring itself is not bad, but it seems useless."

"I met Ainzhart."

"Ah... that disgusting spirit. I understand now."
Here is the translation:

Gremory nodded and received the ring. He placed the ring on the cluttered table, where various trinkets were scattered.

"Alchemy is a technique that creates valuable objects by mixing materials together."

He began to sprinkle something onto the ring, one by one.

"But alchemy is not a safe technique like magic. It's an unsafe technique, and I'm pursuing it. The strong materials clashing together, producing a backlash force that is stored in the ring."

He sprinkled white powder, followed by green powder. The powders collided, producing heat, and the heat melted the ring.

Gremory continued working. The process was incomprehensible to Tai Shan.

Ten minutes later, Gremory poured a blue liquid towards the melting ring.

And quickly hid his body under the table.

Pffft!

The moment the liquid touched the explosive, a massive explosion occurred.

The explosion was so powerful that it destroyed everything in the house. The trinkets hit the wall and fell. The only thing that remained unchanged was the table, as if something had been processed.

Yikes!
Here is the translation of the text:

After the explosion, there were powdery substances seeping into the ring that had appeared.

Gremory raised his head and grasped the ring with a sly smile.

"It's fine, I made it. Take it."

[The ring, refined through alchemy, has a deep scar with an attack power of +150. The ring has a mysterious scar that is said to be imbued with the owner's aura, cursing everything that approaches. The ring combines the powdery substance of the explosion with the fog that is alive and breathing, making it a formidable weapon.]

The attack power had increased by 130.

Even the mountain-like change was stunned.

Gremory shook his head, looking at the mountain-like figure staring at the ring with a blank expression.

"I'm saying this just in case, but if you make it now, it's not going to be at this level. If you make even a slight mistake, it won't work properly and the equipment will disappear."

"It's troublesome."

However, it means that if you elevate your level, you can create such changes.

"If it's easy, I'd use it on a dog or a horse. Now, you're on your own."

He pulled out a few gray bags from his pocket, fumbling with them.

"Take this too."
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have obtained five grains of blessed dust made by the wings of a fairy. The blessed dust made by the wings of a fairy continuously recovers your physical strength and mana for a certain period of time. The recovery speed is quite fast.]

It's similar to what Taeyeon received, but with even better effects. With five grains, you can use it effectively in a dangerous situation.

Tae-san took the dust. The gremelin took out a compass and handed it to him.

"If you go to the place indicated by this compass, you can find the way to the 52nd floor."

Then he started to tidy up.

"Then go. Your business is done."

Tae-san received the compass and asked:

"Can you really be satisfied with that?"

"I've come this far."

The gremelin let out a chuckle, which was more like a sob.

"I... can't retreat."

"Really?"

Tae-san didn't say another word and left.

The gremelin, left alone, stared blankly at the room before starting to tidy up.

He then began to put ingredients into a pot that was bubbling loudly. Finally, he added the horn of the unicorn to the pot, and a thick smoke spread out from the pot.

The smoke dissipated, and on the floor, sticky grains were visible.

The gremelin scraped up the grains.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I am..."

He closed his mouth.

"'I am'."

He would sometimes think like that.

If he hadn't had a self, he would...

If he had a mental state worse than an animal, he would...

Maybe he would have been happier than this.

Gremelin. A grotesque and miserable tribe living in a sewer. They couldn't even handle tools well and were an endless monster.

He was the only one with intelligence in that place.

That was his own despair.

Not only was he naturally small, but he also suffered from the disdain and violence of his tribe.

Monsters are not even as good as animals. And animals would kill their weak offspring when survival became difficult.

Gremelin had barely escaped from his tribe and parents who wanted to eat him.

Gremelin entered the deep forest and made up his mind.

"I will abandon the Gremelin tribe."

I will acquire abilities and live with a tribe that matches my intelligence.
Here is the translation of the text:

After entering the forest, he made a desperate effort to write. He gathered materials on his own without receiving any help from others and grew his strength. As a result, he acquired an alchemy that could not be surpassed by anyone else.

He was delighted with his achievements and left the forest.

If I were myself now, I would be like humans. I would eagerly read the abandoned books of humans in the forest and become proficient in speaking and writing. Since I could communicate with them, their help would be of great value to me, and I could live with them.

He believed this.

The first human he met was a gremelin, and he was amazed by its ability to speak. Before being locked in a cage, it was just a voice.

He became a sorcerer of the forest.

He wrote desperately. I can use alchemy, I can be of help to you, we can be together.

However, no one listened to his words. They were amazed that a gremlin was speaking.

Then, the gremelin realized. What he had learned and what he possessed were not important.

Even if he had any power, he was nothing but a pitiful monster.

It was the same when he was freed by the Monster Liberation Group. They looked at the gremelin with wonder, but not with the eyes of a fellow living being.
Here is the translation of the text:

He returned to the forest again.

And he delved into alchemy with all his might, gathering information and discovering the existence of the labyrinth.

Labyrinth.

A place where all mysterious things gather.

Gremory was excited. If he went there, his existence would be acknowledged. He believed he could communicate with others as an equal entity.

So he entered the labyrinth.

But he was still just Gremory.

The mysterious and beautiful beings still scorned him.

"It's ultimately Gremory's problem."

He sobbed. No matter what he achieved or what accomplishments he gained, no one would recognize him. No one would accept him. No one would be his friend.

He spent his entire life alone.

The madman made one judgment.

If he were not Gremory, then it would be fine.

If he could become like them, then it would be fine.

He looked at the dust with a dangerous gaze.

That's the end, no matter what.

He grasped the dust and stumbled out.

Gremory headed deep into the forest.

* * *
Here is the translation of the text:

"It looks dangerous, but it's his own choice. I don't have the qualification to stop him."

Taeyeon said. It's a pity. I wanted to help, but I couldn't.

However, the demon couldn't be stopped by Taesan. Whatever he said, the demon would respond in the same way as it did to Taeyeon.

Regardless of the result, it was the demon's own choice.

Taesan returned to the village, collecting herbs and flowers from the forest. He could see contents he had never seen before, possibly due to his alchemy training.

[The flower with green blood] [It has the power of cold flames and is strong in its repulsion, making it difficult to harmonize.] [The root hidden deep within] [It has the power of solid ground and is weak in its repulsion, making it easy to harmonize with specific properties.]

"What's going on?"

There were only unintelligible phrases. Even the ghost didn't seem to understand alchemy.

"Alchemy. I've only heard about it, but I've never seen someone actually use it except for the demon. It must be very difficult to master the basics, mustn't it?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"It would be hard for me to do it alone."

I thought I would have to stay in the forest for more than a month if I had to do it by myself.

Taesan collected the materials and arrived at the village.

At the entrance of the village, Darien was waiting for him. When he saw Taesan, his face lit up and he approached him with a bright smile.

His expression was completely different from the last time they met.

"What's up? How did it go?"

"I won't be coming back here again."

"Did you pass through?"

"Yes."

Darien's eyes trembled, but he forced a smile onto his face.

"Congratulations! I knew you could do it!"

Taesan looked at Darien with a blank expression.

"What's going on?"

He had spoken ill of him when he left before. Now, there was no reason for him to treat him kindly.

"I'm sorry, I think I spoke out of turn. I risked my life to get here and didn't even get a proper congratulations."

He grabbed Taesan's arm and pulled him into the village.

"Come in. I'll congratulate you."

Taesan looked at him expressionlessly. Darien's face was filled with concern.
Here is the translation of the text:

As he lifted his foot, Daxian's expression brightened as he followed the towering figure of Tai Shan.

In the moment he set foot in the village, Tai Shan could feel a cool sensation sweeping over his entire body as if he had never experienced it before.

It was a power he had never felt before.

The villagers below could feel it too.

"Ah, it seems I'm finally ready," Tai Shan murmured to himself.

He knew the guides were waiting for him in the forest.

But the forest was a place where they couldn't survive.

So, when Tai Shan passed through the village, the guides were actually inside the village, waiting for him to pass by, hiding their intentions.

"Wouldn't it be disappointing," Tai Shan thought as he entered the village.
