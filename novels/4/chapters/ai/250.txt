Episode 251

251. Community, the players of the earth (2)

[Iteolyeon [Alone] : God... ] [Gang Jun-hyeok [Alone] : You acknowledged it?]

Iteolyeon and Gang Jun-hyeok ask in surprise.

To their reactions, Amelia smiles joyfully.

[Amelia Airlin [Alone] : I know about the gods' level, don't I? They're pretty strong, I think. I'm not as good as them, though.] [Oliver Kan [Hard] : Amelia Airlin. They are our allies. We cannot accept an adversarial relationship.] [Amelia Airlin [Alone] : Shh, Oliver. Didn't we promise not to interfere with each other's solo conversations?] [Oliver Kan [Hard] : You're a bothersome woman, aren't you?]

Oliver looked tired and posted a message. It seemed like he had been struggling a lot up until then.

[Oliver Kan [Hard] : Sorry. I had a prior commitment. It's inconvenient, but I'll compromise with you, thinking that you're stubborn and annoying.]

Oliver left after saying that.

Amelia didn't care.
Here is the translation of the text:

Amelia Airline: How strong are you guys?
Lee Taeyeon: We've just entered the 20th floor, but......
20th floor.

It was a time when the quest of the spirits was progressing. Tae-san was thinking of giving advice on that.

It was not a low floor at all. Compared to Lee Taeyeon from his previous life, it was much faster.

But Amelia was not surprised.

Amelia Airline: 20th floor. Not bad. I'm much better than those silly Americans.
Kang Junhyeok: How about you, then?

Kang Junhyeok asked, his face red with anger. He had confidence in himself, but Amelia's words, which seemed to praise the achievements of a child, made him angry.

Amelia Airline: Me?
Amelia replied confidently.

Amelia Airline: 35th floor.
Lee Taeyeon: What's that?
Kang Junhyeok: 35th floor!

The two of them were shocked. Amelia seemed to be pleased with their reaction.

Amelia Airline: I'm strong. Much stronger than you guys.
Her words were not exaggeration or lies.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the solo mode went down, it became exponentially stronger. Even if the 10th floor's duo combined their forces, they wouldn't be able to defeat Amelia, who was confident in her abilities.

In other words, Amelia was a strong opponent who could easily win against Taeyeon and Kang Jun-hyeok simultaneously.

The 35th floor's adventurer was like that.

Not to mention, Amelia didn't even have the support of the Taesan. She relied solely on her own strength to overcome everything and descend into the labyrinth.

The Taesan watched their conversation with a blank expression.

Amelia Airline.

She was the strongest solo mode player who couldn't be denied by anyone. Her strength was unmatched, and no one could defeat her or win against her.

Moreover, she was different from Taeyeon.

She focused not only on breaking through the labyrinth but also on strategy. As a result, she obtained a lot, and her strength on the same floor was far superior to Taeyeon's.

The Taesan remembered Amelia's strength from her past life.

The power to blow away a mountain and collapse a tidal wave.

She was a monster.

[Amelia Airline [Solo Mode] : God himself recognized my strength and gave me my powers.]

The Taesan gazed at her words.
Here is the translation of the text:

In his past life, he didn't pay much attention to her words. This was because he was in a state of indifference and had never encountered a god.

However, things were different now.

[Kang Tae-san (alone): What kind of god has descended upon you?] [Amelia Airline (alone): What? Who are you?] [Kang Tae-san (alone): Someone you wouldn't like. Answer me. It's not that hard.] [Amelia Airline (alone): ...Don't misunderstand. You're not asking me a question, but I was thinking of answering it anyway?]

It seemed that she was not pleased with the situation, and her tone was rough.

[Amelia Airline (alone): The god of downfall. Essence, yes.]

The god of downfall.

While descending into the labyrinth, Tae-san saw a god he had never seen before.

Upon observing the reactions of Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Jun-hyeok, it was clear that the altars of the gods within the labyrinth were all identical.

Therefore, it meant that Amelia had not received the recognition of the gods by clearing the altar, but the god of downfall had directly approached Amelia.

"Ghost."

[Response? Why?]

"Is it possible for a god to appear directly to an adventurer?"
Here is the translation of the text:

[Hey, is that rare?]

The ghost explained.

[The gods' eyes are keen. It's not just a matter of having exceptional talent. If a person's thoughts, values, and personality are all in line with the gods' will, they will descend directly. It's not because they don't want to be taken by another god, but because it's a rare occurrence.]

Amelia seemed to be a perfect match for the god of downfall.

[Amelia Airline [alone]: Who are you? How many floors are you?] [Kang Taesan [alone]: I already told you. You're someone who would dislike me.] [Amelia Airline [alone]: What nonsense is that?]

Amelia was taken aback.

[Amelia Airline [alone]: It seems you're around the middle of the 10th floor. I don't think I'll have a conversation with a fool. I said it was Itealyeon and Kang Junhyuk, didn't I?]

She lost interest in Taesan.

[Amelia Airline [alone]: Weaklings may die if they're worried about them, but you're different. If you need help, just say so. I'll tell you information you don't know.]

She said proudly.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, Taeyoung and Kang Jun-hyeok's reaction was ambiguous.

[Kang Jun-hyeok [alone] : Hmm... ] [Taeyoung [alone] : Thanks... I guess? ] [Amelia Airline [alone] : ...Why is the reaction like this? I've already told you, right? Shouldn't you be happy because of gratitude?]

Amelia was taken aback.

However, Taeyoung and Kang Jun-hyeok had no choice but to accept it.

Because they didn't need Amelia's information.

[Taeyoung [alone] : Ah, Tai-san. Why don't you say anything?] [Kang Tai-san [alone] : Am I getting in the way?] [Amelia Airline [alone] : What's the story?] [Kang Jun-hyeok [alone] : Ah, sorry, but we don't need your information. There's already someone telling us.] [Amelia Airline [alone] : ...Is that guy Kang Tai-san who's lower than you guys?]

Her words seemed to be hiding a boundary.

[Amelia Airline [alone] : How many floors are you on?] [Kang Tai-san [alone] : Hmm... ]

35 floors, to be exact.

What was there up to that point.

Tai-san remembered and asked.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Kang Tae-san [Alone] : 36th floor. Be careful of the area there. You're the kind of person I dislike the most.]

[Amelia Airline [Alone] : ...what?]

Amelia seemed not to understand, but she would probably understand when she arrives.

There was an immortal being on the 36th floor.

The person who dislikes talented individuals would try to kill Amelia.

According to Tae-san's memory, Amelia did not die on the 36th floor, so she would be able to overcome the problem without any issues. Therefore, he did not explain in detail and only provided general information.

[Amelia Airline [Alone] : Who are you. Where have you fallen down to. Tell me.] [Kang Tae-san [Alone] : You'll find out soon.]

She is an American.

Originally, it would be impossible to meet for at least the next return trip.

However, a unique quest will begin soon.

A temporary space where people from each country can meet.

Amelia and Tae-san will meet there.

[Kang Tae-san [Alone] : Then I'll go.] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone] : Good luck.] [Amelia Airline [Alone] : Hey!]

Tae-san ignored her shout and turned off the community.
Here is the translation of the text:

There was no need to specify the number of floors. Stories that go beyond a certain point are not accepted by others. It's faster to understand if you show it to them in person.

Anyway,

The God of Falling. Essence.

The Mountain God asked the ghost for his name. The ghost responded with a smile.

[How do you know this?]

"There's someone connected to that side."

[Isn't that what you asked earlier? Ah, yes. Essence... I've met him.]

The ghost began to explain.

[The God of Falling. Essence. He's a god with an altar on the 83rd floor.]

83 floors.

It was a deep level.

[He's a god who is particularly interested in mortals. If someone meets his approval, he will give them full support. He's not a bad god, but... as he's the one in charge of that area, he's a bit of a complicated god.]

Each god had their own domain.

The God of Victory. The God of Struggle and Death. The God of Despair.

And they moved according to their own domains.

And Essence was the God of Falling.

[I've gone through a trial before, and it was quite unpleasant. If I like someone, I'll definitely give them a push, but I'm not really someone you'd want to meet.]

"Is that so?"

The Mountain God remembered something.

Not long after, they would meet again.
Here is the translation of the text:

And Amelia had definitely shown her abilities in her previous life.

It was also possible that the encounter was created by the god of collapse.

"It's interesting."

Now, I thought it was impossible to meet the old acquaintance who couldn't be met, but meeting her was always enjoyable.

Especially Amelia was special.

If I had to say who was most opposed to Tai-san, it would be her.

"The news was cut off at 78 floors, was it?"

I couldn't tell if she was dead or had become a messenger angel with God's permission. She didn't talk much about her own information, unlike Taeyeon.

I was going to find out from now on.

Tai-san started breaking through the 58th floor.

The monster on the 58th floor was a deer with a golden horn. It charged at Tai-san with its horn, trying to stab him.

[You activated the Frost Arrow.]

Dozens of Frost Arrows were simultaneously implemented.

The charging deer became tangled in a net.

Tai-san broke through the labyrinth.

As I went down, the monsters in the labyrinth also became stronger, but Tai-san's speed of getting stronger was much faster than that.

He quickly cleared the boss of the 58th floor.

The reward for the secret room was a magic wand. I was thinking of exchanging it for a treasure.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The Sword that Guards the Boundary] [Attack Power + 140] [A sword wielded by a swordsman who had always lived on the verge of death, and had repeatedly crossed the line of death. When the line of death was triggered, the sword's attack power would increase by 50 for 10 seconds.]

It was a skill linked to the "Line of Death" skill that triggered when in a state of crisis. Although it was not a skill that required attention, the Line of Death would consistently trigger whenever the swordsman faced strong enemies.

Considering the conditions, the sword was capable of dealing 190 points of attack power, which was quite impressive.

[The user used it.] [Obtained the Skull Broom Staff.] [The Skull Broom Staff] [Dark Magic + 50] [Mana + 500] [People were curious if the great wizard's remnants still held magical energy. Someone had stolen the great wizard's remains after he died and turned them into a staff, which was later proven to be true.]

A staff related to dark magic.

Tai Shan knelt down and prayed.

The sword opened a space and the staff passed through it.

"It's been a while since I've given something."

An offering to the gods. I've given a lot so far. It's time for something to be achieved.

Hmph.

Just as I was thinking that, the space began to tear apart.

Tai Shan calmly watched as the space tore apart.

[Goodbye.]

"It's been a long time."

Here is the translation of the text:

It had been a long time since I saw the god directly.

She didn't show up, even if the mountain god offered sacrifices. It's not that gods are easy to manifest, but this god always appeared in a mysterious way.

[There was a bit of business to attend to.]

The god said with a face that looked uncomfortable and gazed down at him.

It was a face that was troubled by something. The mountain god could easily tell what was bothering her.

"Is it because of the power of the High God?"

[That's also the case...... and it's also because you obtained the Grey.]

She played with her hair, looking ambiguous.
