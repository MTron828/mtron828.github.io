**Chapter 502**

**502. 93rd Floor, Demons (1)**

**93rd Floor**

We were now halfway through the 90th floor. Taesan headed towards the stairs.

At that moment, space opened up.

It wasn't the goddess of Babylon. It was a different existence.

**Kwaaaang!**

Space shook, and the being that was beyond returned to the labyrinth.

He was the shop owner.

His face was red like a goblin's.

His thick, luxuriant beard was trembling, and he was clenching his fists tightly.

The only emotion visible was anger.

"Why is that?" Taesan asked expressionlessly. The shop owner's eyes widened, and he rushed towards Taesan.

**Wham!**

He grabbed Taesan's collar.

"What's going on?"

"You're suddenly talking like that."

"Why! Why!"

The shop owner shouted with a distorted face.

"Why are my people serving you?"

Taesan realized why the shop owner was angry. With his collar still grabbed, Taesan spoke calmly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I obtained something extra while clearing the quest. It was the people's faith, after all."

"You scoundrel!"

The shop owner's grip on his hand tightened even more. His face contorted to the point where it couldn't distort any further.

"How dare you! How dare you deceive my people! This can't be! They are my people, after all!"

"It's as you said."

But it was too late to take back the faith that had already been obtained.

Taesan grabbed the shop owner's hand that was gripping him. In an instant, the shop owner's body trembled, and he jumped back, creating some distance between them.

Taesan casually adjusted his clothes.

"I fulfilled the wish you spoke of, but you're suddenly acting like this, which is quite bewildering."

What the shop owner wanted was the death of the Transcender.

Nothing else was a condition of the quest.

Taesan had killed the Transcender. He had perfectly cleared the quest that the shop owner wanted, but now the shop owner was suddenly complaining. Taesan couldn't understand the shop owner.

"Don't make me laugh! They should serve me! Me, the true king, not anyone else!"

"Then go and erase my faith and impose your own faith instead. I won't interfere with that."

Note: "Transcender" is a term that is often used in fantasy and gaming contexts to refer to a being with extraordinary powers or abilities. In this context, it seems to be a key part of the quest that Taesan has completed.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ah, ah……!"

The shop owner's body trembled with fear.

At that moment, the floor collapsed again, and Balbambara appeared.

[An outsider has entered.]

His voice was cold and ruthless.

A mechanical voice, different from usual.

It was similar to the tone Taesan had when he first met Balbambara.

[You were managing the shop in the labyrinth for your wish, and now that wish has been fulfilled. Your relationship with the labyrinth is over.]

"But!"

[The condition of the quest is the death of the Transcender. If you had changed your faith, you would have had to abandon your wish as well. But you didn't mention that when you entered the labyrinth.]

Taesan realized what Balbambara's tone meant.

It was truly the attitude of dealing with an outsider, an intruder unrelated to himself.

[Now that your wish has been fulfilled, the labyrinth has no relation to you. Originally, intruders should be eliminated immediately, but... since there's still some lingering sentiment, I'll let you go. Get out.]

Quadruple crack.

Balbambara's power was unleashed.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$The shop owner is being driven out by force. The shop owner wanted to spit out "Muara," but everything was drowned in power and disappeared.

The shop owner was thus driven out of the maze.

[It's over. There's no turning back from here unless you have a new hope.]

"How cold."

[This time, it's clearly their problem. If they had faith, they should have included it in their hope from the beginning. It's difficult for me to treat them kindly if they give up, even when there's a glimmer of hope.] [It doesn't matter. They never considered us more than tools anyway.]

The ghost said quietly. If you think about it, the ghost always disliked the shop owner.

[Taesan. The friendliness I showed you was because you were a tool for realizing your hope, not because I liked you as a person.] [Anyway, it's already over. You won't encounter each other again if you don't head there yourself.]

As Balbabam said, the quest has already ended.

Taesan also had no intention of getting further involved. He had clearly finished what he had to do.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When your wish is fulfilled, the contract is over. After that, it's up to the mage and the contractor's mercy. You should keep that in mind. You're no exception either."

Balbambara turned his gaze to the empty air.

"What you wanted was to become a transcendent being. That's all. If you try to do something more than that, I'll intervene."

"Don't worry too much, I know. You're not going to do that, anyway."

A beautiful voice echoed. It was the green witch.

"I don't think about wanting more than that." "It's just a warning, just in case. But I don't think you'll do that."

Taesan also turned his gaze to where Balbambara was looking.

He could feel the green witch's energy coming from there.

"It's been a while."

"Yes, I've seen something quite interesting."

The green witch's attitude towards Taesan was very polite. Her speech had also changed to a respectful tone.

"Are you using honorifics?"

"You've reached a great height that I can't reach, so it's only natural to treat you with respect."

"There's no need to do that."

"No."

But the green witch spoke firmly.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It can't be helped. Those who have reached the pinnacle deserve corresponding treatment. Even Taesan-nim uses informal language with me."

"Is that so……."

Taesan didn't mind the tone. He treated me the same way he did when we first met, so I didn't pay much attention to the shop owner's informal language either.

But if the other person spoke like that, there was no reason to change it.

"Have you found a way?"

The green witch's goal was to find a clue to become a true transcender.

Although she had seen many things through her contract with Taesan, the green witch shook her head.

"Not yet…… I don't know. Since I can't reach it with faith, I'm gathering fear and dread. I think it's possible, but it's stuck in my mind."

"It's ambiguous, indeed."

No one knew if they could really reach it through that method.

"Didn't I say Remidaos? He's an overwhelmingly powerful being, far stronger than me. Although he was defeated by Taesan-nim, there's no one in the universe who can rival him, except for a select few."

Even such a being couldn't reach the pinnacle the green witch desired.

The green witch once again realized what she truly desired.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Think carefully. The contract with you is still valid."

[Thank you.]

The green witch nodded briefly and left.

The final settlement was really over. Taesan went down the stairs. The shop owner, who had always been waiting for him, was not there.

Only the ownerless shop was visible.

"I guess it's self-service from now on."

It seemed that he could buy the equipment he wanted if he had the right amount of money. It didn't mean much.

[93rd Floor Quest Begins.] [Clear the 93rd Floor Conditions.] [Reward: Fragment of Darkening Light.] [Secret Reward:???]

The conditions for clearing the quest were unknown from the description.

It seemed to be saying that he should hear it directly from the one who was waiting.

Taesan opened the door. The person who was waiting there greeted Taesan.

[You're here?] [You're the demon king. You've met Lucifer.]

* * *

The black hair that flowed down to the ankles.

The sharp, cat-like eyes.

The long, black dress.

The demon king looked exactly the same as when they first met.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, her attitude towards Taesan had clearly changed. At first, her gaze seemed to be testing Taesan, but now it was filled with affection and admiration.

As she gazed at Taesan, she exclaimed in admiration.

[You've reached a stable level. You have a divine power that's worthy of respect. I couldn't easily submit to you.]

"You're overpraising me."

[No, it's true. If you were an ordinary person, I might not know, but you're exceptional, and you can definitely withstand it. You've become much stronger. And... it seems like you've realized something.]

"……."

Taesan realized something within himself.

Mashin also seemed to have grasped it.

Taesan asked Mashin, "Is the 93rd floor your quest?"

[No.]

Mashin shook his head and took a step back.

[I want to do it, but I can't. This time, it's someone else.] [It's me.]

Kwajijik.

The space cracked and distorted, and a muscular man appeared.

[Long time no see. A mixed existence.]

He had a large horn, red reptilian eyes, and a black aura flowing from his entire body.

Baal let out a sly laugh.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You are the great devil. You've encountered Baal.] [This quest is being carried out under my leadership. The demon is just a simple connector.] [No matter how I think about it, it doesn't sit well with me.] [Isn't the story already over? Demon, it's necessary. For him, for us, and for you too. If we delay, it'll become troublesome.] [I know, so I accepted it.] [That's fortunate. Then, I'll have you take care of the one you cherish for a while.]

Baal chuckled and raised his finger. A dark energy enveloped the mountain.

"[Mixed existence. Follow me.]"

The mountain didn't resist the energy. Its physical body left the labyrinth and moved to another location.

"[I'll warn you once more.]"

A faint voice was heard.

"[You and I clearly made a contract. But now, it's nothing but a rusty, worn-out chain. If you play tricks with it...…] [I don't think that way now. You're also worried, aren't you?]"

Baal replied calmly.

The voice grew fainter, and the mountain moved to a space filled with darkness.

"[This must be the second time.]"

Although it was only darkness, the darkness played the role of light in this realm.

It was Baal's realm.

Baal sat down on a chair made of darkness.

"[I've heard the story. Essential. That old man has returned, and in the process, he solved the problem of Uroboros and dealt with the fragments of the worthless ones.]"

"I see."

"[I have the information. I've come this far.]"

Baal looked at the mountain.

His gaze, filled with scrutiny, read him.

Note: Uroboros is a mythological symbol of a snake eating its own tail, often representing cycles and self-reflection. In this context, it's unclear what specific problem or issue is being referred to.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[……I've become stronger. And I'm getting closer. But I still don't know which direction I'm heading.]"

"What's the reason you called me?"

Taesan's eyes sank.

"What do you know about me?"

His secret.

What's inside him.

Where did he come from, and how did he get mixed up in this?

Taesan himself was only now starting to understand, but Baal had known from the beginning.

"[The reason I called you isn't that big of a deal. Let's just say it's for now.]"

Baal turned the conversation with a small laugh.

"You've been working really hard. You haven't taken a proper rest even once, have you?"

"That's true."

Taesan didn't deny it. He had become incredibly strong, but he had never taken a true rest in between. And since leveling up solved mental fatigue, he didn't need to take a break.

"So, how about taking a rest for once?"

"A rest, you say..."

"[Demons like us regularly hold meetings hosted by me. All demons with territories gather there. And you, too, have one foot in the demon world.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Tae-san had made Baal's realm his own. He had taken possession of the devil's realm. As Baal's words, he had taken a step into the existence of the devil.

[How about it. Do you want to participate in our gathering once?]"

Note: "태산" (Tae-san) is a Korean name, and "벨리알" (Baal) is a reference to the biblical figure of Baal, often associated with demonic or evil connotations.
