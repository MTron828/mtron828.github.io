**Episode 490**

**490. 92nd Floor. Faith (1)**

“…What’s that? What is it?”

“It’s Uroboros’s scale.”

Taesan replied. The magician shook his head.

“No, I know what it is because the system explained it to me.”

The magician’s face, looking at the scale, was filled with confusion and dismay.

“…Can I check it out once?”

Taesan handed the scale to the magician without hesitation. The magician took the scale, which was dull and lusterless, and let out a sigh.

“How did you get this?”

“Uroboros gave it to me.”

“Uroboros? What is that again…?”

The magician burst out laughing. He touched the scale with a confused expression.

“…The cycle scale. Is it possible for such a concept to exist in the universe?”

“Is it different from the concept of the chronicle?”

“Yes, it’s different. The chronicle rewinds an individual’s time. That’s all it did. We couldn’t change it in a different way even if we intervened. But this… the cycle is inside it.”

The magician stared at the scale as if he were mesmerized.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Did Uroboros lend a hand, or can we do it ourselves? Even if that's the case, it's impossible unless it's one of the extremely few transcenders like me. Can you make what you want using this?"

"Yeah, it's possible."

"It depends on what it is. Tell me what you want."

Taesan explained what he wanted. The magician's face contorted in a weird way as he listened to the story.

"I can see what you're thinking, but I'm not sure if it's possible..."

The magician touched his beard with a troubled expression, then seemed to make up his mind and grasped it firmly.

"Let's try it out first. You might be able to get the effect you want."

"That's fine."

From the start, he didn't think it would be perfectly achieved. It was a material that was beyond his control, beyond his understanding. Half-ran and Coslun were no different.

Only the strongest beings in the universe could handle it. Leaving it to the magician was the best option.

"It's difficult for me to do it alone, and I'll need the help of other transcenders too."

The magician had a delighted expression, like a scholar exploring the unknown.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's going to be interesting. I never imagined I'd be able to wield the power of Ouroboros with my own hands. Then, Taesan. Can you give me the crystal you have?"

"Is it really useless after use?"

"At least I can read the flow to some extent. Ah, that's right."

The wizard held out his hand to Taesan.

"The returning flute. Can I have that back too? I'm sorry to say this, but I think I'll need it as compensation."

"Okay."

Losing one reward was unfortunate, but gaining an even greater reward made it a profit. Taesan handed over the crystal and flute to the wizard. The wizard smiled mysteriously at Taesan's straightforward gesture.

"Are you giving it up too easily? This is a highly valuable material for us too."

They could have kept the scale for themselves and used it.

Taesan replied calmly to that.

"I don't think I'd do something as foolish as that, so it doesn't matter."

The value of the scale was undoubtedly high.
It was a value that couldn't be found in this universe.
But Taesan's value was even higher. It was an arrogant statement, but the wizard didn't deny it. Instead, he laughed heartily.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I know well. The scales are indeed impressive, but they're not on the same level as yours."

The wizard grasped the scales.

"There must be many who are interested, so I'll go find them. Let's see later."

With that, the wizard left the labyrinth at an incredibly fast speed, as if he couldn't wait.

Taesan leaned against the wall.

It wouldn't be achieved overnight. There might even be failures. The transcenders are powerful, but they're not all-knowing.

But if it's achieved...

He could regain what he had lost.

"Let's wait patiently."

All Taesan could do was get stronger until the wizard came back with the results. Taesan slowly checked his physical condition.

* * *

Taesan's condition was far from good, to say the least.

Even with a level-up, which should have restored his condition to its best, the burden caused by the absolute resistance remained unresolved.

[This is the first time I've seen something that can't be recovered with a level-up.]

The labyrinth's system couldn't recover it. He could only slowly recover his condition.

It seemed like he would need to take a week-long break to return to his original state.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There were many things to do during that time. First and foremost was understanding the new power he had obtained.

[He activated ???.] [He obtained the Mage's Ring.] [Mage's Ring] [Magic + 100] [Health + 2000] [Mana + 1000] [Attack Power + 1500] [Defense + 300] [A ring that the mage had handled before becoming a mage. Now, its essence is mixed into a few rings, making it impossible to find.]

"This is something else."

Taesan let out a dry laugh.

The attack power was 1500, and the magic stats were also quite high. It was hard to believe that a single ring could hold such abilities.

From here on, it was the 91st floor, the deepest part of the labyrinth. The rewards had also changed to a higher level.

"Not bad."

To him now, simple stats or attack power didn't hold much significance. What was more important was his class and authority.

But with stats like these, it had considerable value.

And now was the time to confirm the most important part, which could possibly determine his path."

Note: The [???] parts seem to be placeholders or omitted text, so I left them as is.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Special Activation Skill: Essence of Self] [Observe yourself. Through self-reflection, maintain your physical body and spirit in an unwavering state for 10 minutes. This skill has a daily cooldown.]

The essential power granted to him by the Essence. The Essence of Self.

Its effect was the stabilization achieved through self-reflection.

He could use it to reduce the burden of absolute resistance.

"But it's not that easy," he said.

Taesan used absolute resistance and the Essence of Self to stabilize his spirit, which had been elevated to a high level for a long time.

It was something so enormous that it couldn't be contained within the concept of a skill. To maintain and stabilize himself at a high level for a long time was impossible even with the power of the Essence of Self.

What made it possible was something within him that was confirmed by the Essence of Self.

It was as if it yielded to Taesan, giving him its place.

Then, Taesan was able to temporarily obtain a stable spirit at a high level.

What was inside him?

Taesan waited for a day and then activated the Essence of Self.

[You have activated the Essence of Self.]

He reads his own mind. He delves deep into his own consciousness, observing himself.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His mind was not different from others. It was dark and distorted.

But it couldn't be seen.

The unknown entity that had been seen at that time, as if hiding its body, couldn't be found.

"Hmm."

His true nature was ending. Taesan, who had emerged from his mind, furrowed his brow.

"What is this?"

The information confirmed so far was that there was something inside him.

And the level of that existence was quite high.

That was all. Anything beyond that was unknown.

Taesan explained the contents to Akasha and Bardley. Bardley thought for a moment and opened his mouth.

[I don't know what it is, but isn't it favorable to you? You were helped in the end, weren't you?] [I'm not sure... I don't think it's a truly good existence. It's just that it was hiding inside our lord and watching over him.]

Taesan also agreed with Akasha's opinion. So far, it had been helping him. If that existence hadn't given up its place, it would have been quite difficult to defeat the worthless ones.

But was it really a benevolent existence towards him?
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If I really had good intentions towards him, I would have shown myself directly like Mashin or Maria.

But since Taesan was trying to find me, I hid my body. It meant I didn't want to reveal myself to Taesan.

'Unbelievable.'

At the very least, it's not a pure good intention.

I don't even know what it is. I can't know its purpose. How can I trust something that was secretly hiding inside him from the start?

[……There's one thing I'm curious about.]

Akasha asked quietly.

[Do you not know when it took root, Master?]

"That's right. I only found out recently."

[Then, do you think it was inside you from when?]

"……I don't know."

There's something inside him, but when did it start?

Maybe it was inside him even before time went back.

It's possible that it was quietly observing Taesan while hiding itself.

[It's creepy.]

"I don't know."

For now, I won't think about it. When the Essential comes later, I can directly check it out then."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As I crushed the worthless ones, my proficiency in many skills increased. Among them, my proficiency in Partial World Change reached 99%.

Now, if I just raise it by 1%, it would be 100%.

The Partial World Change is a skill I acquired in this life, so even I don't know what kind of change will occur.

But it won't be a small change. I will definitely become stronger.

And transcend. Worthless.

[Transcend: Worthless] [Proficiency: %^&] [$#%^^%]

Like other divine powers, I couldn't read the explanation, but I knew how to handle it.

Worthless was a power based on black, which I could manipulate.

Rumble.

The power of darkness. Blackness appeared on my palm.

And I focused my mind on it.

The blackness slowly began to fade away. The color disappeared, and soon it transformed into a colorless, formless energy.

This is Worthless.

As I gazed at Worthless for a moment, I snapped my fingers. The formless energy touched the wall of the labyrinth.

And in that instant, the labyrinth suddenly distorted.

The bricks lost their shape and crumbled. The labyrinth system itself began to collapse.

[Wait!]

A shocked voice cried out, and the floor shook."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Balbambara activated #004501.]

Balbambara, who suddenly appeared, collided with the brick wall. The labyrinth distorted and began to exclude and push out the uselessness.

Kugugung!

However, the uselessness did not disappear.

Instead, it clung to Balbambara's authority, which sought to exclude itself, and began to spread its power. In an instant, it permeated the entire room.

[What nonsense is this!]

Balbambara let out a shriek of amazement.

Taesan swung his hand, and the power that had been spreading was instantly recalled.

[You, you…….]

"This was the level of power?"

Taesan was also in a state of shock. The authority of the useless person he had faced was not threatening at all, as it did not interfere with the boundary.

So, he had underestimated its effect, but it was not the case at all.

"A transcendent who has reached the realm of faith must exert all their power to barely suppress it."

Taesan was special, but the authority of the useless person was quite troublesome for the beings of this world. If so, it could be used frequently.

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Blacksmith could handle the black color, but there was a limit to the total amount. It seemed like it could only be used once during battle.

Barbarbam grumbled, barely holding back his anger.

"[Damn it. Don't use that kind of power in the labyrinth. Even the magician is absent. If something goes wrong, it'll be hard to respond.]

"Sorry about that. So, the magician is absent?"

"[Suddenly, something came up, and I'm the only one left behind. I'm busy too, what's going on.]

"I guess Taesan went to handle the scales he was given. Taesan just smiled silently.

"Good job. But can we proceed to the next level without the magician?"

"[It doesn't matter. The story is already over, anyway.]

Barbarbam spoke calmly.

"[You'll also meet someone who knows you well.]

"Got it."

Barbarbam left.

Taesan grasped his authority.

Now, he had obtained multiple authorities, including the divine authority.

Including the black color, he had a total of four authorities.

Handling this many authorities at once was something only Taesan could do.

"I wonder if I can mix them."

Suddenly, that thought occurred to him.

Taesan could mix the black color and the divine authority."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Then, can other powers be mixed as well?

Can powers be mixed and matched to create something new?

Taesan, who had been pondering for a moment, shook his head. It was a story that was too far-fetched for now.

Taesan took a quiet rest, looking around the community and sharing stories, and re-examined the power he had obtained.

And so, a week passed, and Taesan, who had fully recovered, got up and went down the stairs.
