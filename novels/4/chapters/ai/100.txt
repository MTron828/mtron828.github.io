101. Valvernes, Lamb of the Ancients (11)

A being who guards Valvernes. A dragon.

Sometimes adventurers in the labyrinth mistook Taesan for a dragon while looking at him. It meant he possessed strength equivalent to such a creature.

Finally, Taesan understood why they thought so.

"Is there hardly any difference from a god?"

At least in terms of outwardly perceived strength, he found it difficult to discern a gap between the gods he had seen and this golden dragon. From Valvernes emanated a gentle strength that was hard to believe came from a mortal existence.

Even though Valvernes seemed to restrain his power out of consideration for Taesan, this implied that even hundreds of Taesans could not defeat him.

Feeling a moment of strength, Taesan asked,

"Why did you summon me?"

Since Taesan appeared on the mountain, he had felt a prickling sensation, as if something was poking at him.

"You're not trying to kill me according to the will of the gods, right?"

"Of course not."

The dragon smiled.
Here's the translation of the text:

"I am the dragon entrusted with guarding the surface world. Whatever the gods desire is irrelevant to me. That's why I have not laid a hand on the children of the sorcerers who have settled in my land."

The dragon glanced sideways. Valvernes, looking outside the cave, murmured.

"Well, that's now meaningless. The reason I called you is to satisfy my final curiosity."

"Curiosity?"

"I am a dragon guarding the surface world. In other words, I am a being bound to this realm. That's why I've always been curious. About the great labyrinth created by magicians and inhabited by the great gods."

The reptilian eyes turned towards Taesan. Valvernes, observing Taesan, couldn't hide his admiration.

"It's truly remarkable. I understand why the sorcerer would endure such shame."

Unless they are demons, the sorcerer does not give quests. It was reasonable to say that her dignity was compromised when she gave the quest to Taesan, who was human.

"It means that the demons existing in this world have as much value as the person."

Valvernes says with a pitiful face.

"But now it's all over. It's such a sad thing to be destroyed by fanaticism."

"What do you mean by 'it's over'?"
[The young masin is furious.]

Valvernes continues calmly.

[Regarding this world where her own are dying. Though she remains silent as her own still endure, that too will soon come to an end. The world will shatter into pieces. If she hadn't been so attached to what is hers, it would have collapsed sooner.]

[Hey, I'm a little confused.]

A ghost interjected. As an existence within the labyrinth, outsiders couldn't sense or hear the ghost.

But Valvernes quietly asked.

[What are you saying? You who are dead.]

[Hamone was born a god in this world, right?]

[That's correct. A hundred years ago, a mortal transcended to become a god. He is known by the name Hamone.]

[Then Hamone can stop this, can't he?]

The gods within their own domains are immensely powerful. Even a masin couldn't touch them. That's what the ghost had been saying all along.

[Even if the masin is angry, she wouldn't be able to interfere more than that, right?]

Valvernes smiled at the ghost.

[You're quite strong.]

[Indeed, I was.]

(Note: The translation provided captures the essence of the text while preserving the narrative style.)
The ghost grumbled. Valvernes responded affirmatively.

[If you were alive, you could have defeated me. But you don't know about gods.]

[I've met gods who surpass two figures, haven't I?]

[You must have only seen their surface appearances.]

Valvernes remarked calmly.

[You will soon learn.]

[Hmm.]

The ghost didn't seem entirely convinced but said nothing further. Valvernes looked back at Taesan.

[You have satisfied my curiosity. And you are the first mortal I have encountered. So, I will grant you a small favor.]

The golden dragon raised its foreleg. A tip of its claw, cleanly cut, flew towards Taesan.

[It's a dragon's claw. If you can refine it, it will prove useful to you.]

"Thank you."

Taesan accepted the unexpected reward without hesitation.

A dragon's claw.

If one were the labyrinth's blacksmith, refining it would surely be possible.

[Farewell. This may be our first and last meeting. Now, I shall go prepare.]

"Prepare?"
The dragon raised its foreleg. Magical energy began to gather.

[This is the final gesture.]

With a calm voice, the dragon's form disappeared.

The enormous cave emptied out, leaving Taesan alone.

Taesan emerged outside.

He stowed the claw in his inventory and descended from the mountain again. Upon reaching the village, Anetsha, who looked bewildered, appeared.

"What happened?"

"Oh, Taesan!"

Anetsha's face brightened upon seeing Taesan.

"Where have you been?"

"I met someone briefly."

"Someone?"

Anetsha tilted her head curiously. Taesan had never discussed friendships with anyone while staying by her side.

Late, even the demon called Artenekiarah appeared.

"Oh, uh, weren't you gone?"

Artenekiarah looked visibly surprised upon seeing Taesan. Anetsha also spoke with a slightly hurt expression.

"I thought you left without saying anything..."

"I'll speak and leave."

"Ah... Are you planning to stay for a while?"

"Perhaps."

Though uncertain when the quest would be complete, at least for now, the atmosphere was not conducive to immediate closure.
In response to Taesan's answer, Artenekiarah became even more flustered. Uncertainty flickered in their eyes.

Finally regaining composure, Artenekiarah cleared their throat and looked at Taesan, who was staring silently.

"Then, I shall prepare a room for you. Since you've rescued the princess, we must certainly treat you well."

Taesan could read hesitation and determination in those eyes.

* * *

Lying in the provided room, Taesan stared at the ceiling.

Sunlight, which shouldn't have been visible through the ceiling, shone through. The rough, uneven wooden floor was uncomfortable, poking his back painfully. When he glanced around, he noticed a few bugs crawling along the walls.

"I might as well have slept in the trees."

The house wasn't fulfilling its intended role.

Still, he had no complaints. Compared to houses with half-open ceilings, it was relatively decent.

Knock. Knock.

The sound of knocking echoed. Taesan got up and opened the door.

"What's up?"

"Oh, Taesan, are you alright?"

Anetsha held a wooden jug with a puzzled expression.

"If you're okay, would you like to have a drink?"

"What kind of drink?"
"In the village, they said it was brewed after various trials and errors. So, I got one to try."

She chuckled softly, seeming brighter than before, perhaps finding a sense of comfort.

Taesan shifted his body.

"If you're coming in, come in."

"Thank you."

She took out two wooden cups.

Taesan drank the liquor she poured.

[Rolling for Poison Check......] [Check Failed. You have entered a discreet poisoned state. Your HP decreases by 5 every second.]

"Are you alright?"

She asked with a worried expression.

Taesan nodded.

"I'm fine."

"Hehe. That's a relief."

She also drank from her cup.

Taesan scrutinized her face, but it showed no particular effect.

"Is this a poison that affects only humans?"

Taesan opened his mouth as he swallowed the liquor.

"The village outskirts seemed desperate."

"Yeah, a bit."

Anetsha made a bitter face.

The demons fled and couldn't even bring proper tools. With nothing, they couldn't properly build the village from scratch.

The houses were just a result of that failure.
"'Originally, there were two hundred people,' they said."

Unable to endure for five years, only fifty remained alive.

"But... still, it's the village where my people live."

Anetsha said with a determined expression.

"I will also live here and help everyone. If we live with strength, someday we'll have a day to rest."

She smiled as she spoke, then composed her expression. Anetsha respectfully bowed her head.

"Thank you once again. Thanks to you, Taesan-nim... I can meet my people again."

Her voice trembled.

Anetsha had always thought she would be forever chased and eventually caught and killed. Reuniting with those old connections she thought were dead was beyond anything she could have imagined.

All of this happened because of Taesan.

No words could adequately express Anetsha's gratitude.

"Even if you received enough compensation, my heart wouldn't be at ease. So..."

Anetsha bit her lip. With a flushed face, she tightly closed her eyes.
"If Taesan-nim wishes, then I will stay here with you..."

"Enough."

Taesan shaved her head. As she fell back, Anetsha held her forehead and stared blankly up at Taesan.

"Don't say stupid things. You will live here. And I will leave."

Anetsha bit her lip.

"Back to the labyrinth... are you going?"

"That's the only place for me."

Vequesseta was ultimately just a passing place for quests.

Whoever he meets and whatever relationship he forms, once the quest is complete, they all disappear.

Anetsha stood up without giving up.

"A peaceful life here..."

"That's not what I want."

Taesan shook his head.

Choosing the alone mode was not for a peaceful life.

"You're still young. Live here, grow old, and get married. That's your reward to me."

With those words, Taesan left the room.

Anetsha reflexively reached out, but Taesan had long since disappeared.

"..."

Anetsha shook her head.

Taesan went into the forest. The quiet ghost spoke.
[Isn't it regrettable?]

"It's noisy."

"I think that kind of life is fine too. You're exceptional, but... the Labyrinth is where even such people die."

"It doesn't matter."

Now, I'm not afraid of death anymore.

"And cutting decisively is good for her too."

The ghost realized.

"I've felt this before, but your heart is weaker than I thought."

"It's noisy."

"I have no intention to interfere. I've seen many humans who were only rational, but they all died. Thanks to that, I can stick around. And it's not the time for that."

Taesan's refusal wasn't just for personal reasons.

"Are you okay?"

Taesan briefly checked his stamina.

[Shield: 42/192] [Health: 2250/2250]

"No issues."

But his shield had dropped by 150. It meant the poison was quite potent.

After hearing Taesan killed the Swordmaster, he probably prepared something stronger. If Taesan were an ordinary resident of this world, he would likely have taken a hit.

"It won't end like this."
[We should probably get more rewards for this.]

Mashin's request was to take Anetsha to a safe place.

The definition of a safe place could vary greatly depending on where it is. Taesan had thought the destination of the quest was where the demons had fled and settled, and Anetsha had believed the same.

However, the quest was not yet cleared.

In other words, this place was not safe for Anetsha at all.

Kwoong!

A loud noise echoed from beyond the forest.

A powerful presence drew closer to this place. Not only the sheer amount of that power, but also the type of sensation itself was far beyond that of ordinary adventurers or monsters Taesan had encountered so far.

It felt akin to the power of gods he had encountered before.

Kwaang!

Trees were uprooted and sediment rushed like a tidal wave, engulfing Taesan.

"You activated a backlash."

The sediment rushing to engulf Taesan was deflected away.

The deflected sediment collided with the pouring sediment, scattering in all directions. Taesan threw a punch towards the flying dirt. With a cracking sound, a hole was punched straight through.

"You're quite noisy."
Through the soil, a golden light shines. Among the countless scattered brown particles, there is a pair of wings untouched by even a speck of dust.

A beautiful angel with eight wings reveals itself. It is incredibly massive, several times the size of a human.

"You must be the last one."

Perhaps this is Hamon's final resistance.

He will not forgive the demons; that much is clear.

The expressionless angel wields a golden sword.

"This opponent is exceedingly difficult to defeat."

It's been a while since such a challenging opponent was faced. That alone speaks volumes.

It meant facing an opponent at the level just below impossible.

Taesan draws his twin swords and channels power throughout his body.

"Let's give it a shot then."

Taesan stomps his foot.
