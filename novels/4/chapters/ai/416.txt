**Episode 417**

417. 82nd Floor, Remigaton (6)

It was the moment when Taesan was about to approach the throne.

Several presences were rapidly closing in. Taesan stopped in his tracks and turned his head.

"Whoa! Whoa!"

"We're here!"

The four shadows appeared, panting heavily. Their entire bodies were covered in wounds.

The other contractors had felt the intense power waves generated by Taesan and Belial's battle. They realized that this was their destination and rushed over without looking back.

As a result, they suffered significant losses, but they were able to reach their destination.

"Woohoo!"

"The throne!"

They gazed at the throne in awe.

An extremely powerful energy was emanating from within.

It was an overwhelming, transcendent power that they couldn't even touch.

That was the power of the demon, the power they were about to obtain.

Taesan, standing next to them, was barely noticeable. Everyone was captivated by Belial's throne.

And at that moment, Halley moved.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Harlid unleashed magic towards the old man. The old man immediately reacted.

*Kwajik.*

"Kkeueuk!"

The old man roughly created a barrier. The magic that collided with the barrier scattered in all directions.

"You!"

Harlid wore a thick smile.

"Well done!"

*Kwaaang!*

Dark magic exploded.

The contractors, gritting their teeth, charged towards Harlid.

"You think you can take me down easily!"

"Hahaha!"

They all thought that Harlid would ambush them as soon as they reached their destination, so they were able to respond immediately.

However, they had already suffered significant damage from breaking through Belial's domain.

On the other hand, Harlid was undoubtedly stronger than them, and he had also stored up enough power. The battle was one-sided, 1:4, and the remaining contractors all fell in an instant.

[One desire is certainly a reliable guy.]

"It's even admirable."

He was so faithful to his own desire. It was truly admirable.

"Hahaha! I did it! I've become a demon!"

In the end, Harlid, who had defeated everyone, burst into laughter. His eyes were filled with excitement.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Beliar's domain will be mine!"

"Whoever wants to."

Taesan muttered to himself. Harlid, who heard his voice, belatedly realized Taesan's existence.

"......Unchosen one. How did you get here?"

Harlid scowled, twisting his lips.

"That's right. Your ability is specialized in that area."

Taesan had been perfectly hiding his power since he first met them.

It could be inferred that Taesan's power was specialized in concealing his appearance.

He had managed to arrive by hiding his appearance and somehow dodging the domain's attacks. Harlid judged so.

"You're not worth my time. Die."

Harlid punched the air with his fist. Then, a black magic wave fluttered in the space. The wave, which was like a surging tide, charged straight at Taesan.

Harlid didn't pay any more attention and walked towards Beliar's throne.

Taesan stretched out his arm expressionlessly.

He grabbed the magic wave and punched it.

KA-BOOM!

The wave shattered and scattered in all directions.

Note: Beliar is likely a reference to the demon Belial, and the story appears to be set in a fantasy world with magical powers and domains.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Khalid, who had lost his nerve, quickly turned his body around.

"What kind of trick is this!"

The wave of magic surged again. Taesan didn't even try to block it. He simply walked forward, and the wave dispersed.

Taesan grabbed Khalid's neck and threw him away.

"Kwaaaang!"

"Ugh!"

Khalid spat out blood.

He looked at Taesan with an unbelievable gaze, gritting his teeth.

"......Damn it!"

Khalid realized.

Taesan was overwhelmingly stronger than him.

It was unclear whether he was hiding his strength or had reached a level that they couldn't even sense, but one thing was certain - he was on a much higher dimension.

"I've come this far!"

Khalid's anger burst out, but he quickly regained his composure. He began to slowly create distance from Taesan.

"His head is definitely good."

Taesan muttered towards Khalid.

Khalid thought about how he could win.

"It's impossible with ordinary methods."

He had already used all his secret techniques to take down other dark wizards.

So then..."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Harlid, who had finished his judgment, moved immediately. He rushed towards Belial's throne.

Tzeojeojeok!

The spatial wave covered the mountain. However, it was an attack that seemed to grab his ankle rather than knock him down.

"Just sit on the throne!"

Then, everything would be resolved.

The mountain lifted its foot.

And with that, the spatial wave was completely neutralized.

If he wanted to, he could have caught Harlid right away, but the mountain didn't stop him.

Just as Harlid had used other dark wizards, the mountain was going to use Harlid to confirm something.

Without the mountain's interference, Harlid arrived at the throne.

"Finally! I'm..."

He reached the great position.

Harlid sat on the throne with an ecstatic face.

At the same time, power descended upon him.

"Oh oh oh!"

The demonic power coursed through Harlid's entire body. He felt a sense of fulfillment and omnipotence that he had never experienced before.

Harlid twisted his lips and looked at the mountain.

From the mountain, which had felt nothing, power was now being felt.

That power was certainly superior, but compared to the power residing within him, it was clearly inferior.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Harlid had planned to kill Taesan after absorbing all of this power. He was getting drunk on the intense power that was pouring into him.

Taesan was silently watching him.

"Was this the meaning?"

"......Ah?"

Harlid's face, which was receiving the power, stiffened.

Even after receiving it, the absorption of power didn't end.

"Ugh... Ah..."

Something was slowly devouring his ego.

"Hahahahaha!"

Belial's servant, who had suddenly appeared, was laughing maniacally at Harlid.

"Foolish and pitiful creatures! This is your fate!"

"Ugh."

Harlid let out a dying sound.

His eyes were losing their sanity, and something else was filling the void.

Taesan knew what it was.

Belial, the demon who was thought to be dead.

It was possessing Harlid's body and descending upon him.

To some extent, it was expected.

Demons are fundamentally beings that transcend mortality.

They are stronger than Taesan, without a doubt.

It was obvious that a mortal being couldn't withstand the power of such an existence. Using him as a vessel for resurrection was a predictable move.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"My lord, I apologize for summoning you to such a lowly existence."

The servant apologized. Taesan walked towards Harlid, who was slowly collapsing.

The servant ridiculed Taesan.

"Pitiful! You've been too careless. You could have controlled Belial's power, but it's too late now!"

"No."

Taesan placed his hand on Harlid's body.

Then, the demonic power reacted as if it was repelling Taesan.

"It's too late to intervene now! The fusion is already in progress!"

"But you're not even fully merged yet? Your power and strength are unstable. This is difficult."

Black energy flowed out of Taesan's hand. The surging demonic power was suppressed and disappeared.

"What!"

Taesan poured out his power.

With a loud ripping sound, Harlid's body was torn out of the throne.

"Aah!"

The summoning was cancelled. The power that had dwelled in Harlid's body returned to the throne.

"U... Ah..."

Harlid collapsed to the ground, drooling excessively.

The shock of being consumed by power had caused him to lose his sense of self and reason. Of course, this was not Taesan's concern.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan opened his mouth.

"I know you're watching. Come out."

[Did I get caught?]

With a languid voice, Baal descended.

* * *

"Lord Baal."

The attendant was flustered and bowed his head, but Baal didn't pay him any attention. Taesan asked,

"Was it a trap from the beginning?"

The reward for the quest was Belial's power and authority.

It was clear that Taesan and other contractors could obtain it.

But there was no guarantee that they could get it without a problem. Other dark wizards, like Halid, would have been consumed by Belial's power and transformed into Belial themselves.

[It's not a lie. You can definitely get that power.]

"But you hid the truth."

[It's not me, but you should blame the other demons.]

Baal gazed at Belial's throne with a cold expression.

[They're the ones who hid the truth.]

"Will you revive?"

[Demons are beings from the other side of the world, detached from death. But you can destroy their physical body and banish them to the demon realm. To revive, you need a suitable vessel.]

Note: There are some nuances and cultural references that may not translate perfectly, but I've tried to provide an accurate and natural-sounding translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's a Lemegaton for that."

If the dark magician successfully sits on Belial's throne, their reason and wisdom will disappear, and they will become a vessel for the devil.

That's what a direct contract meant.

[I don't like the look of this at all. Whatever they do, it's their freedom, but personally, it's not the picture I want.]

"So you're calling me."

At the same time as Taesan is being tested, he ruins the plans of other devils.

It seemed that was Baal's goal.

[You've successfully carried out my plan. Thank you. Now, all we need to do is take Belial's power and domain into our hands.]

Baal spoke quietly.

[Other contractors might not be able to, but you should be able to handle that power.]

Taesan placed his hand on the throne.

Then, Belial's power and aura tried to engulf him. Taesan shook it off and withdrew his hand.

Taesan shook his head.

"You're joking, right?"

[I don't know what you're talking about.]

Baal's face, as he said that, had a smile on it.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You can obtain Belial's power and authority without losing your sense of self. That's not a lie."

"Instead, I'll lose my own power."

The power Taesan was trying to obtain now was everything Belial had.

And that power and authority were far stronger than Taesan's current abilities.

Of course, he could devour it. Taesan had already reached immortality. He could defeat Belial, who was trying to possess him, and take only the power and authority.

But even if he took it, it was clear that the power would be overwhelmingly stronger than his own.

He couldn't take that power without any cost.

If he devoured it, Taesan would likely lose most of the power he had built up until now in exchange for obtaining everything Belial had.

"Don't you think that's a good choice? Belial's power is strong. You can't reach it now. Even if you lose your current power, you'll gain a stronger one."

Baal whispered, like a demon tempting a human.

"The power of the demon itself. This will become your domain. You'll be able to wield true black magic. I don't think it's a bad choice."

"No."

Taesan shook his head.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I have no intention of doing that."

He had become stronger through his own power.

It was clear that Baal's power was currently out of his reach, but he didn't think it was worth giving up his own power. There was no reason to hesitate.

[Is that so? Then it's unfortunate. I finally cleared the trial, but I won't be able to get the reward.]

Baal smiled as if it didn't matter.

"I have no intention of doing that."

Taesan stood in front of the throne, holding his sword.

[Is this a power surge?]

Baal quietly smiled.

[If I use that power, I won't lose my own power, and I can steal it. But I know that. In the process, most of Baal's power will be wasted.]

You can't take all of your opponent's power with a power surge.

Since Taesan has earned the right to take everything from Baal, using a power surge would result in a significant loss of power.

[That choice is also correct.]

Baal said, as if it didn't matter what choice Taesan made.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Baal's gaze, which was watching Taesan, was filled with interest and pleasure.

"Indeed, a wicked taste."

Taesan recalled the words that Masing had said.

No matter what choice you make, you can't get everything perfectly. Even if you make a decision, you'll eventually regret it.

Baal seemed to be enjoying the struggle and choice.

But Taesan had no intention of moving according to Baal's will.

The throne of Belial was a concentration of power and dignity.

Taesan's sword pierced through the throne.

Kugugugung!

The power that was dormant inside burst out. At the same time, the skill "Spiritual Ascension" was activated, and it began to plunder some of the power and dignity contained in Belial.

Taesan focused his mind and poured power into his sword.

[……Hmm?]

Baal's expression, which had been enjoying the scene, faltered for a moment.

The Spiritual Ascension was a power that even Taesan couldn't control.

However, Taesan had acquired the skill "Seed of Life," which assisted Spiritual Ascension.

The effect itself was not great, and it didn't have much significance.

But as Taesan destroyed the world of Half-ran, the proficiency of the Seed of Life increased to 40%, and as a result, many things changed.

Quadduk.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He interferes with the power that is pouring in with the surge of the Dark Energy. He goes deeper into it.

Quadruple.

Baal's eyes trembled.

He thought that Taesan would take some of Baal's power with the surge of the Dark Energy.

It wasn't a wrong judgment. Baal is a demon. Even if he only gets some of it, it would be a great power for Taesan. It was the right choice to give up his own power.

But the action Taesan is showing now feels different.

It's as if power doesn't matter at all.

He mutters towards Baal's will that is attached to him.

"You don't need power or Dark Energy."

He doesn't want the power that would make him lose himself by devouring it.

Baal was clearly stronger than Taesan now. The gap was impossible for Taesan to catch up with easily.

But that was all.

It may be impossible to catch up with easily, but someday Taesan will reach a higher level than him. And that will be with his own ability.

Above all, Baal's power is ultimately Baal's.

It's not Taesan's own power."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan had obtained a few of the Immortal's powers and realized something.

Even if he stole powers through a surge of energy, he couldn't reach the level of the one who originally obtained them.

It was the same even if Taesan took Belial's power and authority. He would certainly become strong, but there was a clear limit to his power if it wasn't his own.

What he needed to obtain now wasn't power or authority.

Kukuku!

Belial's throne began to go berserk. Unlike before, it no longer accepted Taesan. It was as if it was reluctant to give up something important, and it fiercely scattered its aura.

What he desired was qualification.

It was the devil's seat itself.

[This is...].

Ba'al also realized the truth. Belial's domain was violently shaking. It was in a precarious state, as if it would collapse at any moment.

[...Amazing. One of the 72. He's trying to take it.]

Ba'al, who had been watching the series of events, let out a dry laugh.

The quiet attendant was shocked.

Something was wrong.

Something that maintained his existence was wavering.

"Oh no, it can't be!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He rushed to block the Taesan. He had a strong premonition that if he left it as it was, this place itself would be destroyed.

[Let's not interrupt, it's getting interesting.]

But Baal revealed his true intentions and exerted his power towards the servant. The servant disappeared without a trace, leaving not even a speck of dust behind.

Kiiiiing!

Beliar's will resisted, but it was futile against Taesan's power, which existed without a physical body. Taesan's power could crush Beliar's resistance with ease.

Taesan focused his mind even further. He manipulated the surge of spiritual energy to access the source of Beliar's power, which was deeply hidden within.

Nothing else was needed. Only that source was necessary. Just one.

Taesan stretched out his hand.

He grasped the power that was overflowing from Beliar's throne and pulled it towards him.

Quadduduk!

Something was pulled out from the throne.

Beliar's will let out a scream as it dispersed into the air. At the same time, the realm began to collapse.

Taesan grasped the pulled-out object tightly. Something burst and seeped into Taesan.

[Your spiritual energy surge has been activated. [Remegaton] has transformed into [Remegaton's Throne].]

At the same time, Beliar's realm began to change.
