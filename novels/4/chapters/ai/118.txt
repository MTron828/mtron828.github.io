Chapter 119

119. The Second Return, Gathering (3)

"Eeh!"

"This is far enough."

Tai-san had sharpened his sword. Lee Tae-yeon, who was struggling to hold on, lost his strength and fell to the ground.

"Eh...?"

"My arm won't move."

Kang Jun-hyeok was also lying on the ground, groaning.

"Is it over?"

"It's over here because I can't move. Even if I try harder, it won't make a difference."

Using a recovery potion can recover physical strength, but not mental strength. Since they've been fighting for over three hours, they're already reaching their limits.

"Ahh."

Kang Jun-hyeok and Lee Tae-yeon let out a sigh of relief. However, the ghost was not pleased with this.

[Those guys. Don't they know that the strong teach the weak for free? They're trying to recover and fight again, but their mental strength is already faltering? They're really weak.]

"What's this...?"

Kang Jun-hyeok remained silent. They had already reached the point where they knew they couldn't go any further.
Here is the translation of the text:

The battle was a desperate fight for life. It was a clear privilege to obtain a means to grow stronger without any danger.

"But...... from now on."

It's over for today. Kang Jun-hyeok hit his head on the ground.

[Ugh.]

It seemed like a ghost was saying that it didn't fit in his mind, but what's the point of scolding those who have reached their limits? He didn't say anything else.

Kim Hwi-yeon, who had been quietly watching, muttered to herself.

"Really...... they've become stronger."

Kim Hwi-yeon's face was filled with astonishment.

"I'm sure we were similar last time we returned......"

As they fought together, Kim Hwi-yeon knew the strength of Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Jun-hyeok well.

They were not much different from each other, clearly strong but not particularly surprising. That was the level they were at.

So, Kang Tae-san thought that Kang Tae-san was an exceptional case, and that this level was not much different from hard mode.

But this battle shattered that thought.

Kang Jun-hyeok and Lee Tae-yeon's movements were clearly surpassing her level. Tae-san said,

"At first, there's no big difference. But as time passes, the difference becomes more and more apparent, and eventually, it becomes impossible to catch up."
Here is the translation of the text:

"In reality, Taeyeon's previous world was similar to hard mode until the second return. From the third to the fourth, it became significantly stronger.

"Want to try it?"

Tae-san shook his sword. Gun-jun's eyes lit up.

"Are you okay?"

"I don't think about it today, so I don't care."

"Then I'll take a look."

Gun-jun took out his sword.

* * *

"Ugh."

"I'm tired......"

The next day, Taeyeon and Kang Jun-hyeok walked down the street with tired faces. Gun-jun was no different. He was in a condition that couldn't muster his strength.

However, it wasn't a problem to deal with monsters. Most of the monsters that appeared were F-grade monsters, and they wouldn't be a big threat to hard mode players and above.

"Ah!"

"Block!"

But the players of Ji and normal mode were different. They had to do their best even when dealing with one monster.

As much time as it took to defeat one monster, the number of monsters they defeated was not many. Most monsters were defeated by hard mode players, Taeyeon, Kang Jun-hyeok, and Tae-san.

'It was the same as before.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

It was the limit of Jiwoo and Normal Mode itself. As time passed, the gap was widening by the day.

Taesan tidied up his thoughts and handled the monsters.

After that, it was a repetitive cycle of handling monsters, finding a suitable building to rest, and training with Itealyeon, Kang Jun-hyeok, and occasionally, Geum Jung-geun and Kim Hui-yeon.

The more they trained, the better their movements became.

And three days later...

They were able to arrive at Yongin City Hall.

"Here we are!"

"Long live!"

As people gazed at the appearance of Yongin City Hall, they were overcome with excitement and hugged each other.

"Everyone, we're not here yet! Don't relax your guard!"

Itealyeon shouted to calm the people down, but a joy that couldn't be hidden on her face was visible.

They arrived earlier than expected. And during their journey, the number of people who died was countable on one's hands.

It was all thanks to Taesan.

Because he quickly moved to handle the monsters each time they appeared, no one died from fear and fleeing, and those who snuck away at night didn't die either.

"Thank you! Taesan-sun!"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Thanks. Let's go in."

"Yes!"

Kim Hui-yeon smiled and ran away.

"Wow."

"Big!"

The Yongin City Hall was incomparable to the Ansan City Hall. It had a large area and various buildings, leaving enough space for everyone to enter and still have some leeway.

At the entrance of the city hall, a security guard was standing. He was taken aback when he saw the group and took out his phone.

"Who are you?"

"I came from Ansan... uh? You're not Baek-won, right?"

With a tired face, Kim Hui-yeon blushed. The man who was called Baek-won looked at Kim Hui-yeon with a surprised expression.

"Hyun-yeon, right?"

"What's up. You're here too?"

"Yes, I'm here too."

"That's right. It's enviable. You don't need to move around Yongin."

Kim Hui-yeon let out a deep sigh. Baek-won made a wry face and put away his phone.

"Just wait for a moment. I'll call the king."

"King?"

Kim Hui-yeon looked at him with a puzzled expression, but Baek-won didn't answer and quickly went inside. A few minutes later, a man appeared.

A man with a sports hairstyle and a stiff face. Kim Hui-yeon blushed again when she saw him.

"Seo-jang-san! You're here too, right?"
Here is the translation of the text:

A man from the sports department saw Kim Hui-yeon and was shocked.

"Kim Hui-yeon, is that you?"

"Yes, I'm glad to see you!"

Kim Hui-yeon smiled happily, and his expression suggested that they were old acquaintances.

However, compared to Kim Hui-yeon, Seo Jang-san had a ambiguous expression. He seemed to be both pleased and uneasy.

But he quickly suppressed his emotions, and no one except Taesan noticed. Seo Jang-san smiled and extended his hand.

"It's great to meet you. I'm doing well in Yongin."

"Ah, yes."

"But why are there so many of them? How many are there?"

Seo Jang-san looked at the group with a bewildered expression, counting the number of people was difficult.

"It's around this many, I think."

"...this many? How is that possible?"

Seo Jang-san was taken aback. The number was beyond his understanding. Kim Hui-yeon smiled and pointed to Kang Tae-san and Lee Tae-yeon, Kang Jun-hyeok.

"Don't you remember what I said in the maze? I said that exceptionally strong people would be on my side, thanks to them."

"...ah..."

Seo Jang-san's face trembled.

"Those people, didn't we often talk about them in the community?"

"Yes."

"That's right, isn't it......"
Here is the translation of the text:

A strange gaze is directed at Taeyeon, Kang Jun-hyeok, and Kang Tae-san. Kang Jun-hyeok's face contorts with discomfort at the sudden feeling of unease.

Before he can think of anything, Seo Jang-san snapped his fingers.

"It's been a lot of trouble. We haven't finished the quest yet, so just rest for now. I'll explain later."

"Okay! Everyone, come in!"

People entered the viewing area with cheers and applause.

As they entered, Kang Jun-hyeok muttered to himself.

"Why are you looking at me like that?"

"What? Why?"

"I didn't feel anything, did I? But it's really annoying to see that kind of gaze."

Kang Jun-hyeok thought that Seo Jang-san was pleased. The Earth had become hell, and he had the power to influence survival.

However, Seo Jang-san's gaze towards Kang Jun-hyeok was a gazes of a troublemaker.

Taeyeon hesitated.

"I-I don't know... Is this just a misunderstanding?"

"It's not a misunderstanding. You didn't feel anything?"

"I don't know..."

Tae-san spoke calmly. With a nonchalant expression, Kang Jun-hyeok furrowed his brow.

"Is this a misunderstanding?"

"It's not a misunderstanding."

"Is it really like that?"

Kang Jun-hyeok asked for agreement, but Tae-san changed the subject.
Here is the translation:

"Take a rest first. Are you not tired?"

"......I am tired, though."

Kang Jun-hyeok blinked his eyes. Since he had been moving around, fighting monsters and practicing with Tae-san during his rest, he was mentally exhausted.

"Then I'll take a rest for a bit."

"I'll go meet some people. Are there any people here who are alone?"

Kang Jun-hyeok moved with a tired face, while Lee Tae-yun moved with an expectant face.

Tae-san also started moving.

* * *

The people of Yong-in were not very many in number.

If you counted them all, there were around 10,000, which was a smaller amount than average.

And the expressions on the faces of the people walking around were just two.

Most of them had dark and gloomy faces.

A few had confident and joyful faces.

It was extremely contrasting.

"Ah, Tae-san."

Kang Jun-hyeok met a bright-faced Kim Hwi-yeon while moving around.

"What were you doing?"

"I just listened to a story for a bit. I got information on the number of people, hard mode ratio, and food. I found the location of the food warehouse, so would you like to go together?"

Tae-san nodded his head.
Here is the translation of the text:

The food storage was set up by the city hall. Inside, there were countless cans of condensed milk and instant noodles.

Kim Hui-yeon took a look at each one and muttered to himself.

"Other than canned food, the expiration dates are quite close."

"The expiration date is the sales period. Instant noodles can still be eaten even after half a year."

"Is that so?"

Kim Hui-yeon's face brightened.

"Then it's okay. With this amount, we can eat for a while."

"Not at all. We're not the only ones. People will keep coming."

"Considering those people too, we'll be short of food."

Kim Hui-yeon bit his lip. The city in the southern region had a total population of 20, meaning that the current number was only one-tenth of the total.

"It's not that many, but we'll be short of food. We should prepare slowly."

After confirming, they left the storage room. Kim Hui-yeon spoke in a bright tone.

"Still, it's fortunate. We have Jang San-ee, so we can make do."

"Do you know him?"

"We've talked about all sorts of things in the crypt. He's very strong in hard mode, and makes judgments calmly, earning the trust of many people. Although he's a bit extreme, it's not a serious problem."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Kim Hwi-yeon, the same level as Geum Jung-geun in terms of hard mode play. That's Seo Chang-san.

"Is it a bit extreme?"

"Yeah, sometimes the conversation can get a bit harsh, but everyone speaks up and the argument is settled. There's no big problem, right?"

"I don't know."

Tae-san knows. What Seo Chang-san did in the previous world. How many people he made die.

But that's a matter of the past. No matter how you say it, it won't be accepted now.

Kim Hwi-yeon will soon find out.

A day has passed. There were only three days left to clear the special quest.

After taking a rest, they wandered around and suddenly realized something was off.

"There's no one in solo mode."

I Tae-yeon said with a flustered face.

"Really, there's not a single person."

"Isn't it because everyone died? Honestly, it's hard for us to survive."

Most solo players were weaker than elite players. They needed a lot of luck to survive on earth.

"Or maybe there was no one in Yong-in. Solo mode players are quite rare, you know."

"......Is that so?"
Here is the translation:

Taeyeon nodded with a serious face. However, there was another unusual point.

Walking in the park, Kim Hwiyeon had a puzzled expression as she touched the documents.

"There are too few normal mode players."

It was a natural phenomenon. Monsters on Earth could easily win in hard mode, but not in easy or normal mode.

However, even considering that, it was still too few.

The absolute number itself was large, but the ratio was not proportional. Compared to AnYang's ratio, it was only 1/3.

"......"

Kim Hwiyeon's expression turned into one that said she didn't know.

The players of YongIn also knew about her. Seo Jang-san had told people that she was the administrator of AnYang, so they should treat her well.

"......it's a mysterious phrase."

After that, the people of YongIn avoided eye contact with Kim Hwiyeon.

It was as if looking someone in the eye would result in punishment, like commoners looking up at nobles. They lowered their heads and bodies, as if trying to hide.

And all of them were players in easy and normal mode.
