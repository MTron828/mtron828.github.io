24. 2nd Floor, The Buried One. Ghost of the Warrior (9)

"Is it noisy because of the quest, or is it just an object?"

"He treats people like objects. He's a bad guy even in character."

"So what?"

The ghost groaned softly. Soon, as if inevitable, he began to speak.

"Yeah, you're right. I'm a dead entity. I'm a human bound here to give you quests."

The ghost grumbled.

"But I can't give it to a weak man."

"Then why are you here?"

"Isn't that my country? Ah. Damn maze. Why did they leave me here in the first place instead of putting me deep down?"

Taesan quietly watched the complaining ghost. This was yet another new type of NPC.

The ghost waved what seemed to be its hand in a dismissive manner. It seemed to mean "go away."

"Anyway, go back. Break through to the 30th floor and come back, then I'll consider it."
When it came to this point, Taesan couldn't help but burst into bitter laughter. He decided not to say anything more and attempted to leave the room. He felt it was pointless to try to persuade such an useless adversary.

"Alright then! Off on an adventure... eh?"

The ghost who had been shouting cheerfully trailed off.

"Hold on a moment. You, with that weapon."

The ghost's gaze turned towards Raki Rattas's ceremonial sword.

"That's Raki Rattas's weapon. Why do you have it?"

"Because I won it?"

"...You passed the trial?"

Taesan looked at the ghost with a face that seemed to ask if there was anything else to say. The ghost remained silent. The white shroud, which had shown signs of hesitation, moved heavily for a moment.

"Alright! I'll give you a quest!"

"Suddenly?"

"If I acknowledge you, it must be worth acknowledging! Come back! I'll explain the quest to you!"

"But I don't want to hear it."

"You want to receive it, don't you? Then listen!"

Who is this guy again?

That was the attitude and posture that came to mind involuntarily. Taesan returned with a somewhat disgruntled expression. The ghost began its explanation.

"I was an exceptional and great warrior. I arrived at the depths faster than anyone else. I was considered someone who would soon conquer the labyrinth."

"But why are you buried here then?"

"Some weakling targeted my vulnerability."
The ghost spoke in an angry tone.

"I was in the midst of breaking through the depths when I encountered a formidable enemy, so I came back briefly to rest. I was lying on the 10th floor. My stamina was at risk, but since the monsters on the lower floors couldn't breach my defenses anyway, I just slept deeply."

If the ghost's words were true, it wasn't necessarily a bad judgment.

If you can break through the depths, your defense must be in the thousands. Even if all the monsters on the 10th floor gathered and struck, they would only inflict 1 damage. I could wake up from my sleep and respond immediately upon receiving it.

But the fact that the ghost died meant something else was going on.

"The boss of the 10th floor. I don't know where he got it from, but he had a weapon with a fixed attack. That guy killed me. Me, who was supposed to conquer the depths!"

Unable to contain his anger, the ghost shouted. He spoke with a mixture of resentment that he had not overcome his anger.
[I have one quest for you. Kill the boss on the 10th floor! Then I'll give you a reward.] [Sub quest initiated.] [The warrior buried in the labyrinth seeks revenge from you.] [Condition: Kill the boss on the 10th floor.] [Reward: As decided by the warrior's mood.]

A smirk appeared at the last sentence. Depending on his mood, he decides? Doesn't that mean he might not give it to me if he doesn't feel like it?

[Will you accept?]

Taesan nodded slowly. Still, a quest is a quest. There's no reason to refuse, especially since the boss he has to defeat.

"Seems like a linked quest."

A quest that can only be obtained by passing through Rakiratas's ordeal. Listening to the ghost's words, that was exactly what came to mind.

Once Taesan accepted, the ghost exclaimed with satisfaction.

"Alright! I'll count on you!"

Then the ghost stuck close to Taesan's side.

"Come on, let's go!"

"...Are you seriously coming with me?"

"Well, what if you can't catch me and stick me in the grave? Honestly, that place was getting on my nerves too. It might be fun to escape from there even though it's only up to the tenth floor!"

Do I have to run to the tenth floor with this noisy guy? Taesan felt his headache getting worse.

* * *
[Where did that guy get a fixed weapon from? I admit I let my guard down, but fixed weapons are supposed to come much later. There's no way a monster from the 10th floor could have obtained one, right? You think you'd know?]

"I said I don't know, so stop talking."

Taesan replied irritably. The ghost's mouth never stopped moving. Its incessant chatter was starting to get on his nerves like a parrot squawking in his ear.

The ghost spoke confidently.

[You accepted the quest, so now you have to take responsibility!]

"...Shouldn't have accepted it in the first place."

The feeling of mental fatigue was greater than any reward could compensate for. Taesan sighed softly and asked,

"You said you were a warrior. What brings you here?"

He had already accepted the quest. There was no turning back now. Since the ghost wouldn't stop talking, Taesan decided to at least try to glean some information from it through questions.

[Hmph. Why should I tell you that?]

"If you don't want to talk about it, then don't."

Taesan walked through the maze absentmindedly. It wasn't something he urgently needed to know.

"...Fine! If you really want to know that badly, I'll tell you!"

"If you don't want to talk about it, then don't."

[I was a great noble of the Kabert Empire!]

The ghost began to boast to itself.
[As the eldest son, I was destined to inherit the empire in the future. Not only that! I was exceptional! In swordsmanship, in strategy, in all aspects, there was no one in the empire who could compare to me! Ah! Every noble would rush to catch a glimpse of me whenever I attended a ball! Oh, glorious times!]

From the way he spoke, he seemed like a street ruffian, but he was actually a prince. He was a person of higher status than I had initially thought.

[But when the world faced destruction, I entered here to save everyone.]

"And then you died."

[...You're blunt. But you're right.]

The ghost muttered with a tired tone.

"In the end, I failed. I couldn't save my world. If only I had tried a little harder, I could have conquered the labyrinth. But one mistake ruined everything. The one who brought me to this point deserves to die as much as I do."

Listening to his lament, Taesan advanced through the labyrinth. He soon arrived at a door.

Judging by the number of rooms he had cleared so far, this was likely the last room. After this, only the boss room and the secret room remained.

The clearing of the second floor was imminent. It had been nearly ten days since he started. Achievements had started to accumulate even on the first floor.

Instead of opening the door, Taesan opened the communicator.
Here's the translation of the text:

---

[Changwoong Park [Alone]: Big Rat, how do you catch this?] [Jaesung Moon [Alone]: You just have to grind away at it. After facing it hundreds of times, you start to see its patterns. That's when you strike.] [Changwoong Park [Alone]: Sigh... How did Taeyeon or Junhyuk manage to catch this so quickly?] [Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: Me? I'm nothing compared to the elder brother ahead of me.] [Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: Let's leave that person out of this.]

"It's starting to come together."

"What are you talking about?"

"You don't know about the community?"

"What's that?"

"It exists."

Taesan briefly spoke to the ghost and continued checking. As he scrolled through the posts, it seemed there were a few more who had managed to catch the Big Rat now. Taesan moved his hand.

[Taesan Kang [Alone]: 1] [Changwoong Park [Alone]: Huh?] [Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: Oh, it's Taesan.] [Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: Hey, bro. Long time no see.] [Jaesung Moon [Alone]: Taesan! I have something to ask you!]

Posts quickly began flooding in. As Taesan responded briefly and passed the time, the activity gradually quieted down.

[Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: You've posted on the community. What's going on?] [Taesan Kang [Alone]: I think it's time to start explaining slowly. How's everything going right now?] [Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: It's going more or less okay.]

Junhyuk started explaining slowly.
[Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: About half of those who've arrived at the Fountain of Life have caught the Big Rat. The rest seem like they'll catch it soon too.] [Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: As I kept at it, it eventually worked out.]

The Big Rat moves at speeds beyond human cognitive abilities, but if you keep engaging with it, patterns start to emerge. It just takes a lot of time. Like Taesan did, you can anticipate and catch it in advance.

[Taesan Kang [Alone]: How are you all doing?] [Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: I went to see the boss. Took a hit and felt dizzy.] [Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: Same here. You caught it through sheer force, right?] [Taesan Kang [Alone]: That's right.] [Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: ...How on earth did you manage that? I thought it was impossible. So, I'll try another method. It might involve a lot of grunt work, but it seems much safer.]

Taesan confirmed as he scrolled through the posts. They were now accustomed to the labyrinth. Angry and despairing posts were hardly visible.

Now was the time to inform them. About what he had discovered. About what was absolutely necessary to break through the labyrinth.
[Taesan Kang [Alone]: I wrote today because I have something to tell the players in Alone mode.] [Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: Are you going to tell us?] [Taesan Kang [Alone]: About how to acquire skills.] [Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: ...Ah. I see.]

Taeyeon probably has about two skills by now. Junhyuk Kang also posted something that seemed slightly doubtful.

[Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: Ah, I see. It's necessary, but is this the right timing?] [Taesan Kang [Alone]: Now is the optimal time. If we had revealed it too quickly, it could have turned into a spectator show.]

Skills are means, not ends.

If they were told about skills without properly understanding what the labyrinth is, the skills would become the sole objective. They would waste time obsessing over obtaining skills without even considering entering the labyrinth.

It had to be revealed when they had at least some grasp of the labyrinth and the determination to venture into it.

On the first floor, the only monster is the Big Rat. As long as you're careful, there's no risk of dying. Thanks to the Fountain of Life, infinite recovery is possible, so there was no rush to inform them.

Taeyeon Lee agreed with Taesan's words.
[Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: That's true. If they had suddenly mentioned skills, I wonder how everyone would have reacted.] [Taesan Kang [Alone]: I'm going to explain it now, so listen carefully. We should also explain it to those who haven't seen the community.] [Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: Wow, really? Isn't that incredibly valuable information?] [Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: Wow... Thank you.] [Jaesung Moon [Alone]: Mr. Taesan...!] [Chanwoong Park [Alone]: Thank you! Thank you!]

Numerous posts filled with gratitude and excitement appeared. However, Taesan had a hesitant expression.

[Taesan Kang [Alone]: It's better to express gratitude after you've heard it.]

Even in the previous world, Taesan had explained about the skills he had mastered. But it hadn't held much significance for humanity.

After all, they were ordinary humans who had lived in a peaceful world.

Still, since most of the players in Alone mode had survived, perhaps things would change slightly. With faint hope, he posted his message.

[Taesan Kang [Alone]: How many skills have you all acquired? Excluding the basic skills.] [Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: I have two. Disease resistance and the Line of Death.] [Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: I also have two. Disease resistance and enhanced senses.]

Two each. That's quite a lot for players on the first floor. While others spoke one by one, most had either one or none at all.

Junhyuk seemed curious as he asked.

[Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: Hyung, how many do you have? Five?] [Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: Oh come on. Surely not. Do you really think he has that many?]
The atmosphere in the community had judged that having around five skills was quite a lot. They had tried various methods to obtain skills but hadn't gained anything, so they assumed Taesan would be similar.

Taesan gave his answer.

[Taesan Kang [Alone]: Nineteen.]

The community fell silent for a moment.

[Junhyuk Kang [Alone]: ...Really?] [Taesan Kang [Alone]: Why would I lie and make it up?] [Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: Wow. That's unbelievable. How did you manage to get so many?]
