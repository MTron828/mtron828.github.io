80. 14th Floor, Guide of Sin (3)

"Dragon?"

The young man listening from behind swallowed hard.

Dragon. The strongest race. Even among the demons, no one dares to provoke such an entity that spans dimensions unless they are a high-ranking existence.

Even the weakest young dragon, if it descends to the 40th floor, becomes an unstoppable monster.

Jagan swallowed his saliva.

As a demon, he could vaguely sense the fluctuations of power, and Taesan's strength was formidable, not merely confined to the 13th floor.

Such power couldn't possibly be acquired within the Labyrinth.

The possibility that a powerful being originally entered the Labyrinth was quite high.

And such beings were difficult to find besides dragons.

Taesan spoke.

"Then?"

Jagan's face turned pale. He forcibly steadied his trembling body and replied.

"I have no intention of interfering. Please pass through."

Unable to contain himself, the ghost burst into laughter at Taesan's perfectly submissive posture.

["He really shows his true colors. It's so pitiful."]

"Is the Dragon truly such a powerful existence?"
In the Labyrinth, one can obtain power stronger than outside, but dragons are beings that surpass even that. They are the strongest species in most worlds. Those who are the oldest or born with special bloodlines rival even the gods. There are a few even here at the bottom.

"So powerful."

"...You?"

Jagan looked bewilderedly at Taesan and the ghost. Soon, his face twisted.

"You!"

Realizing he had been deceived, Jagan showed his anger. Taesan brandished his sword.

"I'm just a normal human. Satisfied?"

"...Seems like you're a lowly human after all, easily spouting lies."

"Perhaps the demon shouldn't be saying that."

Taesan smirked vaguely and pointed his sword at Jagan.

On Jagan's face, conflicting lights of anger and composure appeared. Although he recognized his opponent was human, he didn't loosen his guard.

Even if not a dragon, it didn't change that he was strong. Jagan thought Taesan was either slightly weaker or on par with himself.

"You didn't come here just to talk, did you? Then let's do it."

[A challenge. This duel will take place with both parties having zero defense.]

Jagan frowned.

"A duel?"

"When will those behind you strike at me? Will you ask for help or calmly face death?"


"I, asking for help from those kinds of guys?"

"You don't know, do you?"

Jagan, wounded in his pride, was furious.

"How dare a human like you...!"

After barely suppressing his anger, Jagan glanced at the system window and smirked.

"In a state with zero quantum defense?"

"I don't want to be nibbled away. Let's finish this quickly," Taesan said nonchalantly.

At Taesan's indifferent words, Jagan realized.

"His attack power isn't that high."

In the Labyrinth, physical attacks are entirely determined by the weapon's attack power. No matter how skilled the opponent is, if their attack power is lower than the defense, it's difficult for them to make a proper attack.

Jagan is on the 30th floor. His opponent is on the 13th floor. The difference in equipment is absolute. Just by the conditions of defense, it's evident.

Jagan cleanly refused.

"I don't want to."

[Duel request rejected.] [Duel application.]

"Let's fight under fair conditions."

"Okay."

[Duel confirmed.] [Taesan and Jagan commence their duel.]

As if he had been waiting, Taesan rushed forward.

Expecting hesitation or further protest, Jagan momentarily faltered and couldn't respond properly.
Taesan withdrew a dagger instead of a longsword and thrust it at Jagan.

[Jagan receives 12 damage.]

"What?"

Jagan had let his guard down.

Seeing Taesan's challenge for a duel with zero defense, Jagan had thought that due to the difference in attack power, Taesan wouldn't be able to inflict damage. Therefore, he hadn't put much effort into defense either.

Taesan didn't miss that moment of carelessness.

He had also aimed for Jagan to let his guard down by challenging a duel with zero defense.

He smoothly snapped the dagger and slashed every part of Jagan's arm. Second sword. Dance of the void. Instantly dozens of system windows appeared.

"T-This!"

Jagan barely regained his senses and activated a magic circle. Taesan, who had already inflicted sufficient damage, easily distanced himself.

"Damn it!"

With a contorted face, Jagan swept away the system window. Instantly, he received about 300 damage.

"A weapon of fixed attacks. Right. That's what it was."

[The weapon that killed you.]

The ghost chuckled mockingly.
Fixed attack power penetrates defense. No matter how high the defense is, damage cannot be avoided. The ghost died for the same reason, so there was no difference from the weapon.

Jagan ran with the tongue. There was a sword with magi in his hand. Taesan swung the sword.

Kagak!

He swung the sword with one sword and turned the skin with a dagger. After a few sums, Taesan realizes.

'Weak.'

Of course, it is strong. Even in a situation buffed by various skills, there is not much difference in stats.

But the movement was very awkward. Contrary to Taesan's expectations, he continued to show gaps without properly blocking the Storm Wrath sword.

Kagak!

Twist your wrist and bounce off Jagan's sword. Stab the dagger in your chest. Jagan spreads with a groan.

"Hmm."

Jagan gazed at the wound without much confusion.

"The Storm Wrath sword. Interfering with someone who lives without pride. It would be difficult to win in melee as long as it exists."

Jagan spread his hand. The magi that made up the sword began to circle around Jagan's body.

"But I am a demon. It is a being that continues the noble horse. Moving the body is not the main thing."
Magi wells up and pours out. It begins to take shape combined with mana.

"Look. The great magic created by demons in the long history."

[Jagan activated the distorted flora of Decarabia.]

Kuwong!

Roots burst out from the darkness. Flora of enormous size fills the room and overwhelms Taesan.

Taesan grimaces and moves his sword roughly. He repels the approaching massive tree roots. The dull impact tingles through his arms.

"What's this?"

The room was filled with countless roots.

Kiiik!

With a scream-like noise, the roots surge. Like cobras dancing to a flute, the roots grasp Taesan's arms and legs, piercing his chest with sharp ends.

Kwajik.

He breaks the roots with elbows and moves his sword roughly.

The first sword. Wolf's fang. It cuts down all approaching roots.

Yet there were too many. Taesan curses and casts a spell at the sight of the rampaging roots.

Hwaryuk.
The blazing spell ignites in the air. It collides with the roots. In an instant, a large flame spreads out. The roots scream as each one dies.

Hwarruk.

The flames fill the room. Taesan turns his gaze, blocking the flames approaching him with frost arrows.

"You used the blazing spell?"

Jagan, who blocked the fire with magic, grimaces and shakes his hand.

[Jagan activated the crow operatives of Decarabia.]

Kagagagaga!

Distorted crows burst out from the darkness. A large number of them flap their wings and peck at Taesan with their beaks. Taesan moves his sword roughly and manages to shake them off.

"Such magic exists?"

Taesan's experience with magic so far has been simple—summoning lightning, creating flames, making ice, and the like. This kind of complex and incomprehensible magic was new to him.

[Demons' magic. Black magic.]

The specter spoke.

"The magic you use is the magic of the god of magic. It may be the most popular magic here, but it's not all there is to magic. The magic created independently by demons is fundamentally different."

"Don't meddle. Warrior! This is a fight between him and me!"
Jagan spoke sharply. Even though he was a ghost, he had no knowledge of demon magic, but in the position of risking his life in battle, it bothered him.

["Don't worry. I have no intention of helping you."]

Jagan was momentarily taken aback by the ghost's relaxed tone. He had thought that regardless of what he said, the ghost would tell him this and that to help.

‘Is the relationship not good?’

It was a good thing for Jagan. He continued to manifest demon magic.

Marcosias's fake flames.

Blue flames leap out. They burn up all the flames of the burning district.

Taesan activated frost arrows to create cold, but it didn't go out easily. Eventually, the flames touched his arm.

[Taesan's first attack absolute nullification has been activated.]

But the flames are erased. Jagan raised his voice unknowingly at the result that the attack itself disappeared.

"What!"

Attack nullification. What kind of skill is that? Although greatly shaken, Jagan quickly regained his composure.

‘As expected.’

Jagan bares his teeth.
Marcoisias's fake flames are not actual flames; they are extremely hot substances shaped like flames. Therefore, they are not greatly affected by temperature and must be countered with physical force.

However, Taesan did not do so. It was because he lacked information. Demon magic was all unique and diverse, making it practically impossible to respond without prior knowledge.

Jagan had no intention of missing this advantage. He continued to assail Taesan with demon magic. Even the second nullification disappeared, and Taesan began to receive wounds of varying sizes from the overwhelming force.

Confident in his imminent victory, Jagan was oblivious to one fact: Taesan's responses were gradually improving.

Jagan clenched his fist.

["Jagan has triggered Névrose's Despair."]

Darkness engulfed Taesan. Jagan chuckled softly.

"It's over."

The magic he had just used attacked the mind of a person, burying them in endless darkness, impossible to counter without prior preparation.

All Taesan could do was slowly die, trapped in darkness.

As Jagan assured his victory, Taesan was enveloped in darkness.

Grr...

The cry of a beast pierced his ears. Terrifying things burrowed into his mind, attempting to consume his sanity.
[It's difficult to respond. That's because it's a magic you've never seen before. Demon magic is inherently obscure, so even those who frequently encounter it often fail to respond properly. I don't know much about it either.]

Even ghosts, who have faced many demons, knew that demon magic was not something one could understand deeply through experience alone.

Moreover, demon magic was classified among the highest secrets, and no one had ever disclosed its details.

He only knew the basics and lacked detailed strategies for countering it.

[But you might be different.]

The ghost's words carried deep trust and belief.

Taesan stroked his chin in the darkness. The noises that assaulted his ears had no effect on his mind.

"Not bad at all."

'I wonder if I can learn from this too?'

Taesan tore through the darkness. Jagan, who had been leisurely waiting for Taesan's demise, was startled.

'Can he overcome this?'

Impossible. Névrose's Despair attacks the fundamental aspects of a person's mind. Even the most unyielding mental fortitude would struggle to shake it off, yet here he comes out so quickly!

Jagan quickly gathered his wits.
"Still, nothing has changed."

Taesan still knows nothing about demon magic. So the outcome is obvious. He manifests his magic.

[Jagan invoked the Raven Servants of Decarabia.]

Kaaah!

Countless ravens take flight. Each one individually weak but overwhelming in numbers, they swarm and trample down their opponents.

"Non-engagement is the best strategy against overwhelming odds."

Ignore it, or simply brush it off with the aftermath of power.

It's one of those, but Taesan had deflected each one with his sword. It was natural since he didn't know the strategy of engagement. Jagan believed this time wouldn't be much different.

But Taesan activated a skill.

[Gang Taesan activated a backlash.]

Backlash skill. It's a skill that releases intangible force around oneself to push away opponents.

It might not be very significant against main forces but against mobs of opponents like these, it's a very good skill.

Before the ravens could reach Taesan, they vanish under the force. Jagan's pupils dilate.

"So, he figured out a countermeasure?"
Jagan dismissed his own thoughts. It was only the second time. Believing it was just a coincidence, he cast the spell.

[Jagan invoked Marcosias's fake flame.]

A blue flame poured out like a breath.

Taesan swung his sword to strike at the flame.

With a loud sound, the material form of the flame flew far away.

"As expected, this is right."

Taesan nodded solemnly.
