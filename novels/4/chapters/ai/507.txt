Chapter 508

508. 94th Floor, Easy Mode (1)

"I've had a hard time."

The magician's voice was filled with sincerity. His face showed a hint of clear fatigue.

"I heard the rumors and transcendents from all directions rushed in. They all tried to control Oroboros's scales with enthusiasm. But despite that, it was impossible to control them."

Transcendents. Those who govern concepts among them.

They literally govern the concept of the universe itself. If they wanted to, they could threaten the entire universe on their own.

They are the strongest beings in the universe, capable of exerting influence over the entire universe.

Even with many of them gathered, they couldn't control Oroboros's scales.

It was an incomprehensible feat. The transcendents' pride was shattered.

"Thanks to that, I had to move far away and borrow the power of something else."

"Something else?"

"Oroboros is a being close to a device that governs the cycle of all things. It's not like there's only one such device, Oroboros."

The magician shrugged his shoulders.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Let's put aside the unrelated story for now and focus on the important part... After trying various methods, I finally succeeded in making it."

The magician waved his hand. A gemstone slowly flew towards Taesan.

"Take it. This is only for you, something that belongs to you alone."

Taesan stretched out his hand, and the white gemstone gently landed on his palm.

[You have obtained a piece of Uroboros.] [Uroboros's Piece] [You can move through the distorted flow of time, but there are various restrictions and conditions.]

A smile formed on Taesan's lips.

"Finally."

This was what he had been waiting for. Finally, after a long wait, he had obtained it.

Taesan suppressed his excitement. It wasn't perfect yet. He asked the magician to create an item using Uroboros's scales, and he had already predetermined its effects.

He needed to understand how effective it was.

"There are restrictions and conditions written here."

"Yes, just as you expected. Moving through distorted time is impossible even for us."

Not even transcenders can completely escape the flow of time. Only Uroboros can do that.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If it were just a matter of going back to the past, it would be much simpler, but that's not what you want, is it? The concept is beyond our understanding and realm, so we can't handle it perfectly. As a result, we've incurred a significant penalty."

"What kind of restriction is this?"

"First of all, one thing."

The magician raises his finger.

"It's true that you can move through a distorted timeline. But that place is a separate timeline from this one."

"Is it a parallel world?"

"Similar. That place has a different time axis from this one. Whatever you do or achieve there, it won't change anything in this timeline."

If Taesan was thinking of going back to the past to change the future, it would be a worst-case scenario. Going back to the past and achieving something wouldn't have any influence on this world.

But Taesan's expression didn't change.

"What's next?"

"That place is a world with a different time axis from this one. In other words, you're an outsider and a foreign substance in that world. You might be able to withstand it to some extent with the power of the Oroboros fragment and your own strength, but... if you try to change the world, it will try to expel you."

There were restrictions on the use of power and actions.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This is a restriction that doesn't really matter. Your power and strength will be limited anyway."

" Limited?"

"The time you can return to is from after your own birth. You can't go to a timeline where you don't exist. Don't you understand that?"

Taesan nodded his head. The magician pointed at Taesan with his finger.

"The problem is that your power will also be fixed to the you of that timeline."

After a moment, Taesan, who had understood the meaning, opened his mouth.

"If I go back to my childhood, before I entered the labyrinth..."

"Your power will also be fixed to your childhood self."

It was a huge penalty. The fact that he could lose the power he had gained and return to being an ordinary human meant that the timeline he could return to was already determined.

"Of course, if you want, you can bring back your original power, but in that case, you won't be able to stay for long."

It was also a huge, worst-case restriction.

But Taesan's expression didn't change much.

"And?"

"As I said before? You're a foreign substance in that world. In other words, the opposite is also true."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Anything that comes from that world becomes a foreign substance here.

"It's hard to bring back materials or substances from there. Even if you succeed, they'll become meaningless things. It's the same even if it's a fragment of Uroboros's stone."

You can't bring anything back. Taesan opened his mouth.

"It's not like you can't bring anything back."

The magician nodded.

"What you can't bring back is a foreign substance from that world. If you have the proper qualifications and obtain it through your own efforts and will, then it's no longer a foreign substance. In that case, you can bring it back without any problems."

"Then that's fine."

Taesan smiled.

You can't change the past, and you can't have a significant impact. You might even temporarily lose the power you have. You've finally returned, but you can't bring anything back.

There were many restrictions, and each one was heavy.

But Taesan was satisfied enough. He clenched his fist, holding the fragment of Uroboros's stone.

The magician watched him with an interested expression.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's getting interesting."

Taesan had told the wizard directly what he wanted. Therefore, the wizard knew better than anyone what Taesan desired.

So, he was curious. Could Taesan really achieve what he wanted?

"This is better than what I had prepared."

The wizard waved his hand. The concept of the labyrinth, the law, moved according to the owner's will. And so, another law was engraved in the labyrinth.

[94th Floor Quest Begins.] [Achieve what you want and come back.] [Reward: Wizard's Ring.] [Secret Reward: ???]

"Originally, I had something prepared for the 94th floor, but when I thought about it carefully, I thought it wouldn't be that meaningful to you. This might be better."

"Can you just change it like this?"

"What's the big deal? I'm the owner of the labyrinth."

The wizard laughed happily. His eyes were filled with anticipation and joy.

"Well, go ahead and try. I'll be waiting for you in this world."

Taesan nodded and went down the stairs.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

There was nothing on the 94th floor. The labyrinth was empty, as if it was telling me to move on my own.

[Are you going to go right now?]

"There's no need to wait."

From the moment I asked the wizard, the plan was already set in motion.

All that's left is to execute it.

Bardley muttered in an ambiguous tone.

[But if it becomes like this... what about Nana and Akasha? We're bound to you perfectly, unlike the spirits.]

"Akasha might not know, but you're not like that, are you? You can leave me if you want to."

[Still, it's a contract as a tool, a weapon. I don't know what will happen in this case.]

"There won't be any problem. Or maybe only your soul will follow."

Taesan's serious face tensed up, and he grasped the fragment in his hand. From the moment he held it, all the contents of how to handle it came into his mind.

[You used the fragment of Uroboros.]

Kiiiiing!

The wave shook.

The labyrinth itself began to shake and distort.

It wasn't a powerful force that was forcing it to bend. It was a natural, gentle shaking, like drawing a line on a canvas.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung!

And the tremors began to affect not only space but also time.

The space and time around Taesan were warping.

[Ugh...].

Bardray's voice trembled. Akasha was not much different. There were no words, but the emotions could be read from the trembling energy.

The two of them had seen many things from beside Taesan.

But the phenomenon happening now was unlike anything else. It was not a power that could be accepted like that of the Transcendents, nor was it an incomprehensible and heterogeneous power like that of the Gods.

It could be understood, but they didn't want to understand. It could be accepted, but they wanted to refuse.

The reason was simple.

[Too...].

It was too big.

It was as if the ground they had been standing on was actually the back of a gigantic creature, or as if everything they knew was just a small concept inside a single marble.

The fact that exceeded their common sense and cognition was overwhelming them.

Bardray's hair stood on end.

Tzzz!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The power of Uroboros is revealed. A concept that has existed since the beginning of time wraps around them, freeing them from all flows, laws, and concepts.

Born and raised in the world, they were once part of the world, but now they are not.

They no longer belong to this world.

Wooooo!

The trembling axis of time and space perfectly envelops the mountain. The mountain, having finished its preparations, lends its power to its hands.

Zzzt!

The fragments crack, and the concept contained within is perfectly liberated.

[Pause.]

Bardley gasped, trying to say something, but his words did not remain in the world. The concept perfectly enveloped the mountain, and soon it was compressed.

And there was no one left.

Not the mountain, not Bardley, not Akasha.

The mountain perfectly disappeared into the labyrinth.

Tsk.

And the mountain stepped into the labyrinth.

"Hmm."

[Ugh.] [Ugh.]

A strange sensation enveloped them. It was as if the world itself was hostile towards them. The mountain clicked its tongue and focused its mind. The unpleasant sensation slowly began to fade away.

"Is this it?"

It felt like lying on a pile of gravel. It wasn't unbearable.

Note: Uroboros is a mythological symbol of a snake eating its own tail, often representing cycles and self-renewal. The text appears to be a fantasy or sci-fi passage, and some terms may not have direct translations.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[……Wait a minute. Why is it like this, Akasha and I?]

Bardley was bewildered.

He was currently in a spiritual form. Akasha was the same. A faint, misty figure was floating beside him.

[Where's my body?] [You've changed too, Master.]

Taesan examined himself. The numerous equipment and items he had possessed were all gone.

No, that wasn't all.

He felt a sense of powerlessness throughout his entire body.

The immense power that had allowed him to reach the highest heights and split the heavens had vanished without a trace. Compared to his previous self, he was now no different from an ordinary human.

[……Master.]

Akasha spoke in a bewildered tone.

[Where are we……?]

Taesan, who had checked his status, looked up.

The first thing he saw was the wall of the labyrinth.

The rugged, rocky wall of the labyrinth filled his field of vision. The room was quite large, about the size of a small stadium.

And in the center of it was a large spring.

Taesan had seen that spring before. Although it was a very old story, he remembered it vividly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Fountain of Life."

It was different from the Fountain of Life I saw in the Alone Mode. It was more like a fountain than a spring. But the spring in front of me now was about the size of a small lake.

It was a size that couldn't be found in the Alone Mode. Bardley's voice was filled with surprise.

"What's going on? Why is the spring so big? There's no way it's this size in the labyrinth, right?" "Lord, where are we? This is... like..."]

Akasha's words trailed off, and Bardley finished for him.

"Like... the labyrinth."

"It's the labyrinth, all right. Not the one you know, though."

"What do you mean?"

Taesan took a deep breath. It was a landscape he hadn't seen in a very long time.

This was the place where his past self had spent his entire life clearing.

A distorted space created by the interference of the gods.

This was the Easy Mode.
