Episode 15

15. 1st Floor. Boss (10)

Giant Rat.

As the name suggests, it was an upgraded version of the Big Rat. This monster was the size of a sturdy young man and slightly faster than the Big Rat. It also possessed strength that the Big Rat lacked, casually swinging claws that could easily shatter wooden shields.

"Yi Tae-yeon caught it using a loophole."

Her method was simple. She continuously hunted Big Rats on the 1st floor, accumulated money, and bought oil and fire bombs with it.

Then she set the entire room on fire and dashed out.

The boss monster couldn't escape outside. If you came in roughly an hour later, the boss monster would be well-cooked.

If there was enough time, it was a somewhat reasonable method. Originally, the Giant Rat was not a monster that players on the 1st floor could defeat with force, so Yi Tae-yeon's method was close to the correct answer.

However, Taesan had no intention of doing that.
He filled the room with oil. To buy such a quantity, he had to stay here for two more days. The loss of money was significant, and catching the boss using tricks meant he wouldn't get the deserved reward.

So, he decided to confront it head-on.

First, he surveyed the space.

A room about the size of two playgrounds.

There was enough space to flee.

The distance from the Giant Rat was about 150 meters.

Damn.

First, he widened the distance.

Taesan stomped his feet.

The Giant Rat screamed and followed clumsily.

"Kiiiyik!"

While running, Taesan looked back at the Giant Rat.

Even though it staggered, its speed wasn't slow.

As an upgraded version of the Big Rat, its speed was quite fast.

But there wasn't much difference with Taesan. It would take quite a long time to narrow it down.

"Alright."

Taesan turned around. He put the shield in his inventory and pulled out the staff of flames. The end of the staff glowed red.

"You have activated Fireball."

Fwhoom.

Flames gathered on the staff. A ball of fire the size of a baseball shot towards the Giant Rat.

Fwoosh!

"You have dealt 14 damage to the Giant Rat."

"Kiiiyik!"
The Giant Rat let out a pained scream. Anger burned in its red eyes. But Taesan paid it no mind. He had something to verify more than anything else.

[Burn status in progress......] [Success! The Giant Rat is now afflicted with the Burn status.]

"Good."

Burn status effect. Its effect was simple. It dealt 1 damage to the enemy every 10 seconds. The duration of the effect was initially 10 minutes.

At the beginning, 1 damage every 10 seconds was not insignificant. He had thought it would take two or three shots to inflict the Burn status effect, but thankfully it worked on the first attempt. This allowed him to conserve mana.

"Then."

It wasn't over yet. Taesan put away his staff and drew his bow. He had acquired the archery skill against Big Rats before they appeared. It had soon been integrated into his Irak Weaponry skill, but since the skill itself hadn't disappeared, there was no problem shooting arrows.

Taesan took out a poisoned arrow and nocked it on the bowstring.

The bowstring tightened tautly.

Watching the Giant Rat hobbling towards him, he released his grip.

Ping.

"Kiiiyik!"

[Giant Rat takes 7 damage.] [Poison check in progress......] [Failure! The Giant Rat seems unaffected.]

It didn't take effect.
Taesan calmly started running away again. It was normal to try multiple times. It was rare to succeed on the first attempt.

As Taesan fled, he drew an arrow. This time it was a paralysis arrow.

Ping!

[Giant Rat takes 8 damage.] [The target is paralyzed. It cannot move until the next attack hits, or for 10 seconds.]

"Kik, kkiik."

The Giant Rat froze mechanically. Panic filled its red eyes. Taesan backed away a bit more and shot a poisoned arrow.

[Giant Rat takes 8 damage.] [Poison check in progress......] [Success! The Giant Rat is now poisoned.]

Status effect: Poison. Similar to burn, it deals 1 damage every 10 seconds for 10 minutes. Depending on level and skills, damage and duration can increase, but for now, this was the base duration.

"Kkiieek!"

Instantly affected by two status effects, the Giant Rat screamed in rage and charged. Taesan calmly drew another arrow. It was a paralysis arrow.

[Giant Rat takes 7 damage.] [The target is paralyzed. It cannot move until the next attack hits, and for 10 seconds.]
Between the Giant Rat and Taesan, there was a gap, but not enough to fail in the state of paralysis. Taesan grabbed his bow and drew his shield. He rushed towards the immobilized Giant Rat.

*Kuwung!*

"Kkiik!"

[Giant Rat is immobilized. Increased damage inflicted.] [13 damage to Giant Rat.]

The shield pushed the Giant Rat. As it took damage, the paralysis was released, but the Giant Rat staggered from the impact. Taesan didn't miss the opportunity. Swiftly backing away, he drew his bow again.

*Pick.*

"Kkig."

The Giant Rat fell into paralysis again. Taesan drew his shield once more.

*Kuwung!*

He drew his bow again.

He shot a paralysis arrow and then swung his shield. And then shot another paralysis arrow. He repeated this sequence. The Giant Rat could only be pushed around like a toy.

"As expected."

Taesan thought as he pulled the bowstring.

Both paralysis arrows and poison arrows were expensive. They cost 30 gold each, making them hard to come by on the first floor. Thanks to the traps, he was relatively comfortable hunting with them.
However, there were limitations to this as well. Even though they were expensive, they weren't impossible to obtain. After a few days of hard work on the first floor, he could clear it by just using paralysis arrows and poison arrows. Naturally, he had prepared countermeasures for the labyrinth as well.

The time was gradually approaching. Taesan began his preparations.

*Kik, Kkieek....*

The Giant Rat staggered.

Its head shook. The burned leather was hot. Poison flowed through its body, making it feel hot all over.

All this was because of the human in front of it. The Giant Rat let out a sharp cry.

*Kkieeek!*

[The Giant Rat became enraged. It entered Berserker mode.]

"It's begun."

So-called Phase 2, known as Berserker mode.

Its effects included ignoring paralysis and an increase in speed. Now paralysis arrows wouldn't work. He couldn't even run away while shooting his bow.

But Taesan's expression remained unchanged.

He had already caught the Giant Rat. He knew this would happen. After all, he was running out of paralysis arrows anyway, and they had already fulfilled their role sufficiently.

Berserker mode activated when its health was below 20%. From now on, it was a direct showdown.

Taesan raised his Tower Shield.

* * *

*Kkieeek!*
With a cry, the grotesque claws came down strikingly. Along with a loud clang, the shield was pushed back. Taesan frowned at the force felt from beyond.

[You received 8 damage.]

"Indeed, my current strength isn't enough."

His strength stat was barely 11. Even with his shield up, damage still got through. Instead of relying on strength, the answer lay in leveraging high agility.

Once again, the claws came towards him. Taesan raised his shield. As the claws made contact with the shield, they changed direction. With a sharp sound, the claws scratched the shield and fell to the ground.

[You received 4 damage.]

With the claws stuck in the ground, the Giant Rat's body was exposed vulnerably. Taesan pushed it away with his shield.

*Clang!*

"Kkiik!"

[You dealt 6 damage to the Giant Rat.]

The Giant Rat staggered and swung its claws. Taesan blocked with his shield, letting the attack slide off.

[You received 5 damage.]

The turn changed. This time, Taesan swung his shield.

*Clang!*

[You dealt 7 damage to the Giant Rat.] [Combat proficiency increased by 1%.]

His breath quickened.

His muscles began to tire.

Despite pushing overwhelming attacks, the situation was not favorable.

It had already been nearly thirty minutes of fighting.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was one-sided mockery, but his body was exhausted as it continued to move without stopping.

If the battle hadn't continued, he would have collapsed long ago.

End it quickly. Taesan dug into the embrace of the Giant Rat.

[You have initiated a breathless attack. You gain freedom of breath for the next 10 seconds.]

The constraint of labored breathing disappears. The body, which was demanding oxygen, also gains freedom. The breathless attack was somewhat akin to complete recovery.

*Kwoong!*

[8 damage to the Giant Rat.]

"Kkiik!"

The Giant Rat doesn't stay still either. It swings its staggering body and strikes with claws and teeth. While blocking with the shield, there are limits when attacking concurrently.

[24 damage to you.]

24 damage. He can endure up to five attacks in total. Including holding out and letting go, about eight times. He calculates the remaining health of the Giant Rat.

It's enough. Taesan gives up defense. Numerous damage numbers appear towards the Giant Rat.

"Kkiik!"

The Giant Rat also attacks directly.

[25 damage to you.] [23 damage to you.] [22 damage to you.]
Here is the translation of the text:

They exchange attacks with each other. The Giant Rat swings down its claws.

[You have triggered a dodge. The next attack is evaded.]

The claws suddenly change trajectory. A skill that ensures a miss. Dodge. Confused by his own will and evasive movements, the Giant Rat flinches. Taesan pushes with his shield.

*Kik, kkiik!*

The Giant Rat swings its claws. But it misses. This time, Taesan dives underneath and strikes the end of his shield at the Giant Rat's throat.

[You have successfully executed a counter-attack. Inflicting significant damage to the opponent. You have acquired the special skill [Counter].] [20 damage to the Giant Rat.]

*Kki, kkiieeek.*

The Giant Rat staggers. Falling into a state of weakness, its berserk state is unleashed. Taesan delivers a finishing blow.

[8 damage to the Giant Rat.]

*Kkiieeek......*

The Giant Rat collapses. Its heavy body crashes to the ground with a thud. Gradually, its breath ceases.

*Phew.*
Here is the translation of the text:

It wasn't as difficult as expected. His stats were not low. Even in a head-to-head confrontation, there was a chance of winning, and he managed to defeat the Giant Rat with paralysis arrows, making it easier than he had anticipated. He emerged victorious.

A long and detailed system window appears.
