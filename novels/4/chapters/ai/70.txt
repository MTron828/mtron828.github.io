71. 12th Floor, God of Choices. Maria (3)

Taesan moved his arm smoothly. The motion of deflecting swords contained a naturalness that hadn't been there before.

"Is this how it moves?"

Drawing trajectories in his mind, he moved his body accordingly. He adjusted the sword's movements in real time.

It was madness. Swordsmanship was something accumulated over countless years, perfected slowly. Changing it suddenly in the midst of battle would not only fail to bring meaningful change but could cost him his life with clumsy movements.

Yet the ghost said nothing, and Taesan proceeded as if he had complete confidence in his actions.

He pulled his elbow and shook his wrist. His hand holding the sword moved roughly like a beast until now. It wasn't bad, but it was dull and heavy like spilled ink on blank paper.

But the swordsmanship unfolding from now on is the opposite of that.

The tip of the sword shakes. Like a sword dance. But it has precision.

Smoothly passing by like a dance, each trajectory was a deadly attack.

Clang.
The swords clash, sparks flying. Taesan's sword smoothly descends along the knight's sword, scratching his armor.

Swoosh.

The sturdy armor is sliced apart like cloth. Taesan reverses his grip on the sword and smoothly evades an attack aimed at his square.

The knights are shaken by the completely different movements, mistaking them for feints.

Not missing the opportunity, Taesan presses forward.

As both hands move, the knight raises his sword to block.

In an instant, Taesan twists the trajectory of his hand, the sword passing by and piercing the knight's chest.

As he withdraws the sword, he blocks an attack aimed at his back.

Clang.

He continues smoothly down the edge of the sword, moving like water, bending the knight's forearm, shoulder, and armpit.

The knight can do nothing and loses one arm.

"Just a bit more."

A bit more smoothly. But without losing the essence of swordsmanship.

He moves both hands simultaneously, smoothly executing a completely different movement as if they belonged to someone else. He deflects the sword and smoothly counterattacks.
The knights begin to falter greatly. The pressure that had worked so well up until now no longer affects them, and their movements are filled with hesitation and distrust. In such a situation, the odds of victory seem nonexistent. Finally, another knight falls to Taesan's sword.

Only two remain.

The knights' confusion subsides. They coordinate perfectly with each other to target Taesan. Taesan moves his fingertips. Just like before, a dance-like swordplay unfolds.

Clang!

The sword makes a loud noise. There is no wavering among the knights as before. They move their swords in response to Taesan's changed movements.

They begin to push forward with force. They try to trample the dance with violence.

Taesan pivots.

He rotates his body, pulling his left hand to the right and pushing his right hand to the right.

As his body leans to the right, he rotates. The left knight's sword misses. The right knight's attack loses its force as his target slips away.

He flows his strength into the dance.

And the swordplay changes.

He rushes towards the right knight. His movement is not like a dance but more like a storm, like a beast.

The first sword. Like a wolf's fang, it cuts through the knight. If the knight recalls the same swordsmanship he faced at first, he can defend against it without confusion.
However, the knight cannot completely block the trajectory of the completely opposite swordsmanship. They hurriedly move their swords, but they receive wounds in various places on their armor.

Just as the knight barely starts to respond, the movements change again. Smoothly, like a dance, like a martial art.

Clang!

Unable to withstand the continuously changing swordsmanship, the knight collapses.

Capturing the remaining knight is not at all difficult.

He overwhelms with movements like martial arts. The knight desperately tries to defend, but alone, he lacks both strength and speed. Moreover, considering Taesan's superior swordsmanship, the knight cannot hold out for long and falls.

"Hoo."

Taesan looked down at his hand with a blank expression. A swordsmanship completely different from before unfolded in his hand.

"Skill window."

[Advanced Skill: Storm Wound Sword] [Proficiency: 22%] [A swordsmanship passed down from a world that has perished. Currently, only one person has mastered it. It is a level that can be considered introductory.]

Somehow, it reached 22%.

The ghost who had been watching couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.

["I was thinking about teaching you slowly, but I didn't even imagine you would awaken on your own."]

"What is this?"
From the beginning, as if this was the correct answer, the swordsmanship unfolded on its own. The ghost explained.

[The second sword. Muhee's Dance. If the Wolf's Fang Sword strikes aggressively, Muhee's Dance approaches gently and severs the jugular. It minimizes the roughness characteristic of swordsmanship and slashes with optimal movements. Not bad, right?]

"Quite impressive."

It couldn't be said which was superior.

When facing weaker opponents, the Wolf's Fang was preferable, but against equals or multiple foes, Muhee's Dance was better.

However, the fact that both swords had completely different styles was a great advantage.

If Muhee's Dance had been used from the beginning, the knights would have adapted accordingly.

But since the style changed completely during the battle, they too were momentarily thrown off.

Unless they were completely lacking in intellect, even those with a slight bit of cleverness could grasp it.

This made a significant difference in battle.

[Do you have to push it to its limits after all? I thought I would gradually teach you the complex swordsmanship... But you're quite something.]

Leaving behind the impressed ghost, Taesan brushed off his body.
They had defeated all the visible monsters, but there was still one left.

"Now it's not even attacking."

The invisible monster that had been annoying him all along. It was time to take it down.

During the battle, he had become irritated and gradually deduced an approximate solution.

"It's not someone who goes to a different dimension."

Monsters that hide in the so-called second dimension and ambush. At first, he thought it might be them, but the likelihood was quite low.

Many of them were mediocre except for their advantage of hiding in another dimension.

Moreover, they didn't have the ability to teleport between dimensions.

Even if they did, they wouldn't appear like this without going deep into the depths.

So, it became simple. Spatial movement was much lower in grade compared to dimensional teleportation. Therefore, concealment and spatial movement. There were quite a few monsters that used both.

"Even the high-level succubus was one of them."

Taesan cast a spell. Frost arrows began to fill the space one by one.

Before long, twenty frost arrows filled the room. Taesan clenched his fist.
[You triggered a magical explosion.]

Zzeuong!

The frost arrows exploded simultaneously, showering the room with ice shards.

A magical explosion inflicts damage indiscriminately. Despite Taesan's significantly low health, he wasn't concerned about the danger.

[Your Endurance has activated. The attack leading to death has been nullified. All damage is reduced to 0 for 1 second.]

Endurance was a skill that allowed him to use self-destructive abilities without issue. Taesan's prediction hit the mark, eliciting screams.

"Aaaargh!"

[43 damage to Goblin Shaman.] [44 damage to Goblin Shaman.] [You have defeated the Goblin Shaman.]

As Taesan defeated the last monster, the system window popped up.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You have passed Maria's trial. According to Maria's evaluation, you will be rewarded. Maria is greatly satisfied with your honest choices and accomplishments. She wants to give you a fitting reward. Maria's interference area has decreased. Maria gives you a reward. You have received [Weapon of Transformation]. You have cleared an enhanced trial. Additional rewards follow. You have received the special activation skill [Freedom of Choice].

As always, it was about weapons and skills. Thanks to the hard-fought battles that pushed the limits, the proficiency of several skills increased significantly, and their contents changed. New skills were also obtained.

Before confirming that, a proposal came in.

"Maria proposes a covenant to you."

"No."

As always, the proposal is rejected. There was no intention to accept the covenant yet. A faint laughter seemed to echo.

Suddenly, the power from beyond seemed to have made a decision, and the rippling stopped.

"Hmm?"

Taesan paused.

Suddenly, the atmosphere was not good.

Something huge began to rush in.

"Whoa."

"Wait."

"Irrational choice activation by Maria. Maria's interference area decreases. You have been invited. Options are given. Accept the invitation vs Accept the invitation. Forced choice. You accepted the invitation. The pandemonium welcomes you.

The world turns upside down.

Everything begins to be covered as if painted over with a darker shade of paint. The body is forcibly dragged into the transformed space.
"Ugh."

Taesan felt dizzy from the sudden spatial movement. After a moment to settle his nausea, he lifted his head.

And then he let out a bitter laugh.

"What is this?"

If there's empty space in the universe, could it be like this? A vast expanse of black space stretched out. Even looking towards the end, there was nothing visible, just perfectly black space.

"[...This can't be real.]"

The ghost uttered a shocked groan.

"No. This isn't right. How could God bring you here? It's impossible for there to be an invitation like this."

The ghost muttered incessantly, its attitude as if it were condemning the end of the world.

"Damn invitation."

In the empty space, there was only one magnificent temple standing grandly.

"It's disgustingly huge."

Even looking up, he couldn't see the ceiling. It was the size of a mountain.

As Taesan approached the temple, the ghost was startled.

"Hey, wait. Hold on. You shouldn't just go in there recklessly."

Seeing the ghost urgently trying to stop him, Taesan felt a strange emotion. It was the first time he had seen the ghost look so frightened.

"Is it really that scary?"
"Didn't I invite you? Let's see that handsome face of yours."

There's no point in just standing here quietly; entering is the right answer. The ghost seemed embarrassed, as if it knew that, but said nothing more.

Creak.

The giant door opened smoothly. Inside the temple, Taesan sighed in awe.

"What in the world is this?"

Gems were spread out like a flower garden.

Black gems, golden gems, white gems, and more. There were so many types and quantities that it was almost painful to look at. The ghost, who had been silent with his mouth shut, let out a whimper.

"That... what is that?"

The ghost's gaze fell on a strange gem that seemed to combine silver and gold.

"That's a gem made by compressing a meteorite that fell from the stars. There was only one in our world, and with a sword made from that... it destroyed a continent."

Not a country, but an entire continent.

There were thousands of such gems here.

"The Archmage barely managed to seal them all together, and yet..."

"...You're amazed by such insignificant toys."

A voice mixed with laughter echoed.
"Indeed, to you, anything here must seem extraordinary. Even a rusted piece of scrap metal would be something you couldn't see again."

A resounding voice echoed within the temple.

Taesan turned his head.

He saw a woman with long hair cascading down to her ankles.

Her abundant golden hair was impressive.

She gazed down at them with a somewhat languid expression.

It was a human form.

But it didn't feel human at all.

Firstly, she was enormous.

The size difference between a kitten and a human was present between Taesan and the woman.

If the woman had been standing, the difference in size would have made it very painful for Taesan to look up.

And there was a sense of immense power.

The woman smiled.

"Nice to meet you, child."

With the greeting, numerous judgments were attempted.
