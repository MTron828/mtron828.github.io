Episode 1

Prologue

Taesan gazes silently at the enemy before him.

[Kaaaah.]

Brightly shining red scales.

Eyes of a reptile gathering all life in the world.

From his breath, sporadic white flames are emitted.

The red dragon growls.

The king of dragons. The Moebius lizard heralding the end of all things. Guardian of the depths.

It was a kind of sacred entity that not even gods could easily confront.

Against such a being, Taesan possessed only meager equipment.

Basic chainmail provided at the very least. And a rusty sword.

That was all.

"To face a dragon alone with this equipment. The difficulty lives up to its name."

Perfectly alone, he is not.

Above, he could feel eyes fixed on him.

The light in those eyes is simple.

Infinite expectation towards him.

And admiration for the miracles yet to come.

They won't interfere before his banquet. As always, they'll watch from afar.

Now, it's familiar. He raises his sword without hesitation.

[Krrrrr.......]
The dragon moves its foreleg. It cautiously steps back, eyeing Taesan.

A hint of fear flickers in its eyes filled with vitality.

"Why do you interfere?"

[Kaaaah!]

As if determined about something, the dragon roars and moves its feet. With a thumping sound, the massive dragon's body approaches.

Looking back, the door through which they entered had disappeared long ago.

There is no way to escape.

The battlefield was about the size of a sports field.

"It's always the same."

To kill or be killed.

As they take a step forward, the dragon threatens and lets out a roar.
Here's the translation of the text:

"[Kaahhh!] [The roar of a dragon overwhelms you!] [Initiating judgment.] [Stats reduction judgment in progress……] [Action unavailable judgment in progress……] [Mental collapse judgment in progress……] [Submission judgment in progress……] [Instant death judgment in progress……] [. . .] [Judgment successful!] [You endure with indomitable mental strength!] [Stats have increased.] [Your actions never cease. You have acquired the special continuous activation skill [Continuous Action].] [An unyielding spirit arrives.] [A body that does not yield is imbued.] [The opponent faces an impossible victory.] [Judgment unnecessary. Your spirit remains unbroken against an opponent deemed impossible to defeat!] [Judgment unnecessary. Your determination has risen against an opponent deemed impossible to defeat!] [Judgment unnecessary. Your willpower has increased against an opponent deemed impossible to defeat!] [Stats have increased.] [You never falter in battle.] [You gain eyes that see through the opponent's weaknesses.] [The dragon is intimidated by your unyielding nature.] [The dragon feels fear towards your unbroken spirit.] [Confident, the dragon falls into terror at the thought of its own defeat.]

"Disappear."

Taesan clears the system window and brandishes his sword.

"We'll finish this quickly, so come at me."

[Kaah!]

The dragon rushes towards Taesan.

1. Easy mode player (1)

"Ugh, annoying."

Taesan grumbles as he walks through the desolate city.

"Why did this damn guy run all the way here just to bother people?"

Sparse and alien beings appeared on the crumbling streets. However, Taesan continued grimly down the road.

"Is this Anyang?"

There was no trace left of the city as it once was, completely collapsed.

Only remnants of buildings remained.

And scattered asphalt.

Taesan wrinkled his face at the sight of a landscape devoid of human scent.

"Annoying……"

He marched forward. Before long, he found his purpose outside.

Grrr.

Grrrrrr.

Monsters appeared. Completely black in color, neither human nor animal in form.

Three such monsters were devouring a single corpse.

That corpse was Taesan's objective.

Though not dead, it was alive.
Here's the translation of the text:

"It's annoying."

Grrrr.

The monsters take notice of Taesan. They finish devouring the corpse and start moving cautiously.

[Monster 435 eyes you.] [Monster 221 eyes you.] [Monster 222 eyes you.]

"How can such an uncouth name be real?"

Taesan grumbled. Even in battle, he felt drained every time he looked at the name.

Grrrr!

The monsters charge. Taesan, facing speeds beyond human classification, simply looked on with an annoyed expression.

* * *

"Hey. Open the door."

Taesan bangs on the door in front of the massive barrier. The vibrations spread through the door, and before long, it opened.

"Hey. You're back?"

"It's so annoying. Couldn't someone else have done it?"

"Haha. You know there's no one else but you."

Jung-geun welcomes him back. After scanning around Taesan, he asked with a puzzled expression.

"The deserter?"

"He's dead. His corpse was eaten by those damn monsters."

"What?"

Jung-geun is shocked.

"Even though he was a hard mode player, he's already dead?"
Here's the translation of the text:

"Three Class A monsters were happily tearing each other apart?"

"Ah......"

Jung-geun stayed silent. Hard mode players were strong, but each Class A monster was a match for a hard player. If there were three of them, there was no way to escape.

"Where are they located?"

If the three Class A monsters were nearby, they needed to be dealt with quickly.

Taesan responded nonchalantly to Jung-geun's serious expression.

"I killed them all."

Jung-geun muttered with a drained expression.

"I see."

"Alright, I'm hungry. Let's go to the restaurant."

"Yes."

Inside the barrier were several buildings. They looked like they could collapse at any moment due to their age, but some standalone houses still retained their shape.

As they walked, Jung-geun asked Taesan.

"Hyung, honestly tell me. You're not an Easy Mode player, are you?"

"What nonsense are you talking about again?"

Taesan frowned.

"There were a few who entered the labyrinth with me. Ask them about it."

"All the Easy Mode players are dead now, except you. Even the occasional ones that pop up die within two days."

"......Is that so?"
Here's the translation:

"Honestly, how are Easy Mode players managing in this situation? Even Normal Mode players are barely holding on. You're really something weird, hyung."

A player who's an Easy Mode player but surpasses Hard Mode. That was Taesan.

"Why are you so strong? I'm a Hard Mode player too, but I can't even come close to you."

"You guys just clear things half-heartedly, that's why."

"Here you go again."

"What do you want me to do about it then?"

They roughly cleared the labyrinth, and Taesan understood every element. According to Taesan, the difference lay in just that one thing.

"Since we can't go back to the labyrinth anyway, let's skip the pointless talk and have some food."

"Yes, yes."

They entered an old tent. Taesan sat down at the table.

"What's for dinner today?"

"Potatoes."

Taesan's face twisted.

"Potatoes again? Can't we grow something else? We have sweet potatoes or corn, too."

"Potatoes are the most efficient. How can I help it? Even with basic cultivation, there are limits to yield."

A skill that allows cultivation anywhere without anything. Thanks to the few who possess basic cultivation, humanity was still surviving.

"You haven't learned it, hyung?"


Here is the English translation of the text:

"Why would an Easy Mode player bother learning that? There's plenty of food wherever you go."

"Yeah, that's true."

Jung-geun nodded slightly.

A while later, Jung-geun brought potatoes. They ate silently without exchanging any words.

From the other side, loud noises could be heard—voices mixing shouts and sighs, and cries denying reality.

"Looks like another cleared one causing trouble."

"Seems like it."

Players who returned from the labyrinth to Earth often couldn't accept reality and caused disturbances. It was a common occurrence.

Neither Taesan nor Jung-geun moved. It was the usual flow to let the commotion subside, then gradually explain to the surrounding players.

However, this time, unlike usual, the disturbance didn't easily die down.

"Um... hyung. Aren't you a Hard Mode player?"

"Damn it."

Taesan grimaced.

A man rushed over as if to prove Jung-geun's words.

"Taesan, please come quickly. It's a real mess right now."

"Why me? There are plenty of Hard Mode players. Can't they handle it?"

"Oh my. Even Taesan knows. Just come quickly."
Taesan stood up with a bruised face. Jung-geun calmly took Taesan's potatoes.

"I'll be back."

"If you eat that, it'll kill you."

"..."

Jung-geun quietly turned the potatoes back.

With a sigh, Taesan followed the man.

"What's this guy up to now?"

"He's a Hard Mode cleared player, accusing us all of lying and causing a scene."

"We have several Hard Mode players here. Can't they subdue him? Is he quite strong?"

"Yeah."

The man clicked his tongue.

"He's got some pretty good skills, so to subdue him, someone might end up dead. That's why we need Taesan's help."

"What about Itaeyeon?"

"Itaeyeon is currently out on external reconnaissance. You know that, right?"

"Sigh."

Taesan sighed as he headed towards the center of the disturbance. There, a young man with a flushed face was shouting.

"Don't joke with me! Why is this Earth? We finished everything last return! This must be a hidden camera prank!"

"Young friend, this indeed is Earth. A lot has changed in the world while you were in the labyrinth..."

"Don't joke with me!"
The man threw a rough punch. The middle-aged man trying to calm
Changchun, who was pondering over the name, suppressed a chuckle.

"The guy who always talked big about being an EZ player?"

"You know him? He was active in the community."

"Hilarious! An EZ player thinks he can take on a Hard player?"

Changchun scoffed at Taesan.

The power gap between players by difficulty level is enormous.

Even a hundred EZ players together struggled to inflict damage on a Hard player.

However, Taesan slapped his hands impatiently.

"Enough talking. Come at me. If you beat me, I'll show you the real world you so desire."

"Don't regret it!"

"You'll be the one regretting."

[Duel initiated.] [Lee Changchun and Kang Taesan begin their duel.]

People around them cleared the street, focusing on them.

Lee Changchun's confident gaze wavered.

As if implying there was no worth in watching, they began to place their bets.

"Who are you betting on?"

"One potato on Kang Taesan."

"Five potatoes on Kang Taesan."

"Three potatoes on Kang Taesan."

"No one betting on that young guy? He might actually win, you know?"

"......"
There was no response to that statement. No one present here believed Lee Changchun would win.

They truly thought an EZ player could defeat a Hard player.

Taesan folded his arms firmly.

"I'll forfeit the first move."

"You...!"

Lee Changchun gritted his teeth. Regardless, the duel had begun. There was no turning back now.

[Lee Changchun activates Add-On. Adds half of base attack power.] [Lee Changchun activates Focus. High chance of hitting with attacks.] [Lee Changchun activates Intensity. Next attack deals significant damage.]

"Oh."

"Intensity right after Add-On? Impressive."

There were murmurs of admiration around. But that was it. They awaited the outcome calmly, without wavering. Lee Changchun snarled.

"I don't know."

He charged towards Taesan.

[Lee Changchun's attack.] [Kang Taesan's First Attack Absolute Nullification is activated.] [0 damage to Kang Taesan.]

"Huh?"

"Is that all?"

(Note: The last line appears to be unrelated and seems like a misplaced or incorrectly formatted text.)
Board British Consider Easy Mode Empire Fabric Family

Lee Changchun blankly checks the system window. Kang Taesan's skill to nullify the first attack? What is that? Even during his playthrough of Hard Mode, he hadn't seen anything similar.

"Now it's my turn?"

Kang Taesan raises his fist. Lee Changchun belatedly snaps out of it and wraps his body with his arms.

[Kang Taesan's attack.] [Lee Changchun activates Resilience. Damage received is reduced by half.] [Kang Taesan activates Absolute Judgment. Ignores the opponent's defense skills and defense stat.] [49 damage to Lee Changchun.]

"Huh?"

Lee Changchun is once again taken aback.

Too weak. His health is just over 10,000. This kind of attack, he could take plenty without flinching.

"Well, then."

Lee Changchun regains his composure. His opponent is an EZ player. The disparity in absolute stats and levels cannot be bridged.

But Taesan raises his fist once more.

"You, have just over 10,000 health?"
Kang Taesan activated Addition. His current attack power doubles.

Kang Taesan activated Multiplication. His current attack power squares.

Kang Taesan activated Absolute Judgment. Ignores the opponent's defense skills and defense stat.

Lee Changchun's body stiffened.

"Take this."

"Wait, hold on."

[Kang Taesan's attack.] [9,604 damage to Lee Changchun.]

* * *

"Ugh... ugh...."

"Taesan, isn't this a bit too harsh?"

"But you're not dead, right? How much more gently should I treat you here?"

Taesan grumbled. Lee Changchun was sprawled on the ground, trembling.

"Ugh..."

"Young friend, do you understand now? This is the real world. Despite clearing that damn dungeon, we're still failures who couldn't protect the Earth."

"Don't... don't joke..."

Tears welled up in Lee Changchun's eyes.

"Why... why is the world like this... If it's like this, it would have been better not to clear the dungeon..."

Silence followed his words. The man who had been comforting Lee Changchun gave a bitter smile.

"But we've all come out now. What can we do? Even in this crazy world, we have to try to save it."

Back in the days when the world was still the world.

As the sky split open, monsters leaped out.

And humans were given a choice.

Easy Mode.
Normal Mode.

Hard Mode.

And Alone Mode.

Players who entered the maze by choosing each difficulty return to Earth upon clearing it.

To a Earth overflowing with monsters, nearing destruction.

They were such individuals.

And Taesan was a player who chose Easy Mode.
