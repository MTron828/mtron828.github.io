Chapter 137

137. 70th floor, the guide of evil. Upper echelons (1)

"What's going on? Ambrosia."

A woman with burning hair relaxedly asked.

"Why did you all gather us here?"

"Wait a bit. When everyone is here, I'll tell you a story."

Ambrosia said, and the woman with burning hair sat down and waited.

Before long, one by one, people entered and sat down one by one.

"Is that everyone?"

"All twenty-one. Everyone is here."

A muscular man with hair like a snake said calmly, and Ambrosia frowned.

"It looks like it's been reduced a lot."

Originally, their number was this many. However, due to the sacrifices caused by the battles between each other and the puzzles of the labyrinth, half of them had dwindled over a long period of time.

"So, let's hear the story. Why did you call us?"

A middle-aged man said with a bored expression, and the woman with burning hair replied.

"There's a reason, isn't there? The ghost who has been attached to the adventure-seeker who said he would handle it. Is it not to handle him?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Yes, right, right? That's what I'm saying. That guy is right here, isn't he?"

"...What?"

There was a moment of silence. A man with hair like a lion's mane furrowed his brow.

"Did you really use the secret key?"

"Yes."

Ambrosia nodded. The man's face contorted in anger.

"Wasting the precious key like this? I told you not to talk and die, didn't I?"

"Stop joking around. Lion King. There's a reason for it."

Ambrosia raised his hands, as if to say "stop." The Lion King sat down, his anger simmering.

"Explain. Ambrosia. Think about our goal and each key is precious. Is there a reason why you wrote it?"

"I'll tell you, stop joking around."

Ambrosia hesitated, his face uncertain.

He explained that Tai Shan had become the disciple of Rakiratas, and that he was also using the black magic of Ma Shin.

The woman who listened to the explanation was consumed by rage. The fire spirit king let out a sigh.

"Are you saying that as a human, you are receiving Ma Shin's favor?"

"Rakiratas, that stubborn and self-centered guy became my disciple?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Ambresia's words left everyone bewildered.

"Why did the god of the demon tribe bestow black magic on humans?"

"I don't know. The gods' whims are not something that can be understood in just a day or two."

Ambresia shrugged her shoulders.

The silent Lion King opened his mouth.

"It's because my eyes were covered by the dark curtain of the underworld..."

"That's impossible. How could a 30-year-old get the equipment that can only be obtained by surpassing the 50th floor?"

The Lion King closed his mouth.

"Now I understand why you brought the key. You didn't want us all to go up, so I went, and I hope you won't complain anymore."

"That's right. Sorry."

The Lion King apologized sincerely. They were equal. There was no leader or hierarchy between them. Ambresia lowered her hand.

"I understand. Let's start talking from here."

The adventurer who received the favor of the two gods.

Someone said:

"Is it a ghost's curse?"

"It might be."

The Fire Spirit King agreed.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The ghost is also a powerful being who continues to persuade the gods to fulfill their covenant. If he helps, it's not impossible. You can rise above your own abilities, right?"

"Ah, really? You're going to cling to a weak adventurer like me and want to kill us? Is that it?"

"You're not like that, are you? You've been betrayed by an ally who had a hidden agenda. I consider that a reasonable grudge."

The leaders concluded that the ghost's help was the key to Tai Shan's current strength. The ghost, who had witnessed Tai Shan's abilities firsthand, was clearly the stronger party.

"Really?"

Ambresia shrugged his shoulders.

"Why?"

"No, it doesn't seem that way to me."

The ghost Tai Shan was different. He was more inclined to rely on himself rather than the ghost.

"But it's impossible to do it alone. We couldn't do it either."

"...Really?"

Ambresia's expression turned thoughtful. Even those who were referred to as guides of sin, and even heroes stronger than them, couldn't do it alone. It was impossible to achieve without help.

"So, what are you going to do?"

But they couldn't bring themselves to speak for a long time.
Here is the translation of the text:

As they were discussing various things, Taesan was checking the wall one by one, floor by floor, up to the 70th floor.

"What are you doing?"

A ghost who had been quietly watching asked, unable to bear it any longer. Taesan was examining the bricks and said, "I'm looking for a hidden room."

"Is there a hidden room here? It's on the 70th floor. Those guys have already thoroughly searched it. Besides, a simple hidden room wouldn't appear here, would it?"

The guides of the evil path were stuck on the 74th floor. It was clear that they had found all the elements they could find after lingering here for a long time.

"And don't you have a reconnaissance skill? Try it out."

"It won't work."

You have activated your reconnaissance skill.

Reconnaissance, a skill that allows you to grasp what's within your line of sight. There was also a hidden room there, but nothing else appeared.

"Look, there's nothing else here."

The ghost said that there was nothing left to find, but Taesan did not stop checking the bricks.

"That's it, one."

Information that the ghost and the guides of the evil path did not know.

Only Taesan had discovered it.

"I heard it was around here somewhere……"
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san was stuck in the narrow gap between the bricks on the right side of the room.

As he was stuck, he felt something grabbing onto his fingertips. A small rod-shaped object was lodged between the gaps.

Tae-san applied force and pushed.

With a soft "kkuuk" sound, the brick floor opened up.

Without a sound or a single creak, a small passage appeared.

[Ah, ahah?]

The ghost was taken aback and raised its voice in alarm.

[What's this?]

Tae-san calmly descended the stairs. The bewildered ghost asked, trying to hide its confusion.

[Is this a secret room? It looks like that, doesn't it? How did you get in here for the first time?]

The ghost couldn't understand. Tae-san's actions were filled with conviction.

"I heard it from someone."

[Who?]

"It's someone who doesn't exist now."

Tae-san chuckled.

Ite-yun found this room by no extraordinary means.

In her past life, she had overcome countless trials and hardships, reaching the 70th floor. And she felt pride, joy, and fear all at once about herself.
Here is the translation of the text:

So far, she had barely made it to this place after going through a life-threatening crisis. If she had been just a little unlucky, she would have already become a corpse.

From now on, only tougher things will be waiting for her. That fear made her stop in her tracks.

As a result, she stayed motionless in the 70th floor for over a month. I knew it through real-time monitoring through the community.

It's only natural to feel bored in a place with nothing, and she finally started searching this place from corner to corner. This place was the end of time she had discovered.

Later, after returning to the earth, she told the story of the labyrinth she had overcome. I remembered hearing about it then. She said she found a secret room hidden in the right wall gap.

I just listened vaguely, but I didn't expect it to be written like this.

[Wow, but this secret room is the first time I've seen it. A secret room that can't be found even with reconnaissance? Is there a reason why I couldn't find it before?]

Reconnaissance told her about the information within her sight. Of course, the secret room was included.

Therefore, from the moment she learned reconnaissance, she didn't need to struggle to find the secret room. She could just activate reconnaissance in the room and know immediately.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, this secret room was difficult to detect even with surveillance.

The high-ranking officials also did not come out with surveillance, so it was likely that they judged that there was nothing here.

"It's a lucky woman."

If she hadn't been lucky, she wouldn't have cleared the solo mode.

Tae-san smiled and went down the stairs. Soon, a small room appeared.

[You have discovered a statue of a goddess who has lost her name.]

The small statue that could be held in one hand was in the room.

The statue carved with the goddess was so worn out that it would crumble to dust if you touched it, having been left unused for a long time.

Tae-san knelt in front of the statue, clasping his hands together.

As he prayed, the statue turned to dust and scattered, and the power within it settled upon him.
Here is the translation of the text:

You prayed to the forgotten goddess, and received the blessing of the goddess [Nameless Goddess's Regeneration Blessing]. This is a special quest: [Forgotten Goddess].

You searched for the statue of the forgotten goddess, who was forgotten by both the creators of the labyrinth and the gods. The forgotten goddess, who had disappeared, was awakened by your prayers and is waiting for you to save her.

Those who have received the blessing of the goddess can feel the aura of the hidden statue of the goddess in the labyrinth. Go to her and pray to her.

Reward: Goddess's Favor

A ghost who had been watching the whole process exclaimed in surprise.

"Was there a quest like this too?"

Even the ghost who had cleared the labyrinth and the guide of evil did not know about this quest.

"Good."

The mountain god clenched his fist and checked his skills.

[Goddess's Blessing: Nameless Goddess's Regeneration Blessing] This is the goddess's blessing. Your regeneration abilities of all kinds are significantly enhanced. It's still a long way from the goddess's blessing.

The level requirement was written instead of skill level. The meaning was clear. If you pray to the goddess's statue, your level will gradually rise.

Remembering Taesan's words, this was a very good skill. Your physical and magical energies recovered very slowly during battles, making it impossible to expect natural recovery.

But with the blessing of the Nameless Goddess's Regeneration, the story changes.

Your recovery speed increased by about tenfold. While your physical energy was of little significance, your magical energy was different.

Usually, your magical energy would recover by 10-20 points per hour, but it had increased by tenfold, which meant a lot.
Here is the translation of the text:

In addition, Taesan had additional consumption values such as protection and magic. Simple calculations showed that it was about twice as efficient as Taeyoung.

[Wait a minute. But if it's a step-by-step process, then we have to find each one, don't we? Then... if we don't find it on time, we won't be able to complete the quest.]

"That's right."

As soon as we descended to the next floor of the labyrinth, the rewards from the previous floor were almost negligible.

It's the same with quest rewards.

That's why Taeyoung only obtained the blessing of rebirth and the blessing of life from the nameless goddess. It was clear that the statue of the nameless goddess would be there even before the 70th floor.

"Well, it's a good thing."

Taesan had obtained the opportunity to obtain most of the blessings of the goddess.

After cleaning up the room, Taesan came out again.

Even after a considerable amount of time had passed, no one's figure could be seen.

"Are you still not here? It's taking a long time."

[I'm getting a headache.]

The ghost chuckled.

We waited for about an hour and a half before they finally showed up.

* * *

"Is this all?"

"I originally intended to bring them all, but some didn't want to come, so I only brought the ones who agreed to come."

(Note: The story seems to be a fantasy or RPG-style narrative, and the characters appear to be exploring a labyrinth or dungeon.)
Here is the translation of the text:

Ambresia said, "The Great Mountain scrutinized their faces. There were three of them."

One of them was Ambresia, who had been talking nonstop as a guide, but there was nothing special about him. The Great Mountain looked at the other people.

A man with golden hair similar to a lion's and a muscular build.

He was staring at the Great Mountain with eyes of the same golden color.

"Be afraid."

The Great Mountain murmured to himself and let out a burst of energy. His energy was calmly received by the man, causing a sparkle in his eyes.

"Hua Jun."

It was not a proper aura, but for a normal 3rd-grade cultivator, it would be impossible to control one's entire body. It was received without any burden, indicating that the rumored power was real.

"Not as strong as that."

The Great Mountain turned his gaze.

The most fiery hair appeared first. It was not a metaphor; it was really burning like a flame.

A woman who had the flames themselves on her body.

"Is it the Divine King?"

"Do you know me? A young one."

"I know you to some extent."

At the same time, the sword was shaken. The power within it was trembling and unfolded its stance.

'Be quiet.'
Here is the translation of the text:

The Taesan's power surged into the hand holding the sword.

It's not now.

It's not yet.

The eyes of the Jeongyeongwang, who was staring blankly at the Taesan, began to waver.

"...Why can't I feel my aura from you?"

"I don't understand."

"But I can feel the power of my children from this child. The power of the child I've cherished and given a territory is within you."

"Good job."

[You have triggered a small spark.]

The Taesan shook its hand, and a burst of flames erupted.

"...You killed me."

The Jeongyeongwang's eyes fell.

"All of you have prepared yourselves to enter the labyrinth, knowing that you will eventually meet your doom."

Flames erupted from the Jeongyeongwang's eyes.

"But I'm angry."

The room's temperature suddenly rose.

The extreme heat was so intense that it was impossible to take a breath. The skin turned red and scorched, and the attack became ineffective in an instant.

[You took 3069 damage.]

It wasn't a direct attack. It was simply a change in emotions. The presence before them could have led to the Taesan's death just by being angry.

But the Taesan laughed.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Why would you try to kill someone you've invited to such a majestic place? Very impressive?"

Tae-san laughed at the Zheng-ling Wang as his whole body was on fire with pain.

"Are you going to kill me? Do what you want if you can handle it."

"That's enough."

The Lion King grabbed Zheng-ling Wang's arm. At the same time, the heat dissipated.

"Rein in your emotions. If you get too reckless, it won't be possible to recover."

"You're right. I'm going to die from the heat."

Tae-san shrugged his shoulders. The Lion King's eyebrows twitched at Tae-san's extremely calm appearance.

"This play is getting too long. Let's get to the point."

It's clear that they are strong.

You can kill Tae-san with just one finger.

But at the same time, you cannot kill Tae-san.

"I don't want to waste time, so let's get to the point."

Note: The text appears to be a conversation between two characters, Tae-san and the Lion King, with a dramatic and intense tone. The translation aims to preserve the original meaning and emotions of the text.
