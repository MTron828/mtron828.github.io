Chapter 165

165. Forced Return (2)

"I'll receive it."

Tai Shan nodded his head.

There was no reason to refuse the additional reward.

Moreover, Tai Shan was also angry. This incident was similar to a deliberate trap to prevent him from meeting the God of Magic at the exact moment.

It was a despicable method that was obvious to anyone who knew.

[Acceptance of Sub-Quest.]

The God of Magic smiled satisfactorily.

"Well, I'll come find you again when you return to this place once more. Then, I'll give you a mid-level magical trial."

"I understand."

The God of Magic clenched his fist. Tai Shan's physical tremors grew stronger. The God of Magic looked at him and said:

"They're going to kill you."

Who they were didn't need to be asked.

And soon, Tai Shan returned to Earth.

He took a deep breath first. He felt the unique air of Earth. It was qualitatively different from the air of the labyrinth.

Tai Shan turned his gaze.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Alright, wait a minute."

"What's this? Why, why is this sudden return?"

Until now, the return to Earth had been delayed by a long time, so people were shocked by the sudden return.

Tae-san was looking for Kang Jun-hyeok, Lee Tae-yeon, and Kim Hui-yeon among them.

Just then, one of them recognized Tae-san and shouted.

"Mr. Kang Tae-san!"

"Mister?"

Tae-san scowled, and all their gazes turned to him.

"Ah, it's Mr. Kang Tae-san!"

"Mr. Tae-san! Please save me!"

They rushed towards Tae-san like fanatics rushing to their leader.

"Mr. Tae-san! Mr. Tae-san!"

"Just once, please touch me!"

Tae-san's astonished face turned pale as he took a step back.

As he moved, his figure seemed to be climbing the walls of the buildings, and people shouted in amazement.

The voices echoing throughout the area made Tae-san's mouth drop open.

"What's going on here?"

[Your divinity has increased by 1%.]

"What's going on with this increase again?"
Here is the translation of the text:

He moved to the highest building, grumbling to himself, and launched a reconnaissance mission. He quickly gathered Lee Taeyoon, Kang Junhyuk, Kim Hwiyeon, and Geum Junggeun.

"Wow!"

He grabbed them and brought them all to the rooftop of the building.

The ones who were dragged along, unable to resist, stared at Taesan with wide eyes.

"Brother, you're as fast as lightning. Why are you moving so quickly?"

Geum Junggeun chuckled awkwardly. He had thought he had become stronger, but he couldn't even react. He suddenly remembered the gap between them.

"That's enough. What are these people doing?"

Taesan furrowed his brow and looked down at the building below.

People were cheering towards Taesan.

"Did you see the community?"

"I saw it, but I didn't think it would be this intense."

It wasn't just that they liked him or thought of him as a benefactor. It was pure worship.

"That's what I mean."

Kim Hwiyeon explained awkwardly.

"Actually, it wasn't this intense at first."

According to her words, originally, they had thought of Taesan as a benefactor.
Here is the translation of the text:

Receiving the talent of struggle and death, I was able to clear the layers that would have been impossible to clear originally. For a normal person, this would have been a matter to be grateful for, and it was actually the name of the Taesan that rose to the lips of the people.

And soon, people who followed Taesan emerged.

At first, there were not many. The following was not at an excessive level. However, those who followed Taesan rapidly increased their strength.

The flow that started in easy mode was now spreading rapidly without distinction between normal and hard modes.

"Thanks to you, I'm also in a state of chaos. What did you talk about with Taesan sir? What did he say? Like that, you know?"

"We're in a solo mode, so such a thing doesn't happen."

"Even so, isn't the community noisy? Other people are also in a state of chaos?"

"Ah, that's right."

Kang Jun-hyeok nodded slightly, his eyes unfocused. The people who were still struggling in the single-digit layers of the solo mode were asking him and Lee Tae-yeon all sorts of questions.

"It's too much. It's a nuisance to both Taesan and us. But we can't stop it either."

"Can't your brother say something? Can't you just do it a little bit?"

(Note: Taesan is likely a nickname or title for a powerful character, and the story seems to be about a group of people who are struggling to clear certain levels or achieve a goal, and are seeking advice or guidance from someone who has already accomplished this.)
Here is the translation of the text:

They thought people should not worship the mountain too much. Suddenly, Jung-geun, who was listening quietly, spoke up.

"Do we really need to?"

"Yes?"

"It seems unnecessary to block worship, don't you think?"

"It's annoying, isn't it? It's a hindrance."

"But they were able to find peace of mind because of it."

Kim Hui-yeon stopped talking as soon as he heard Jung-geun's words. Jung-geun added with a wry smile.

"Even if it's your uncle or aunt, or someone like Tae-yeon or Jun-hyeok, who has a strong mind, ordinary people need a sanctuary for their minds. That's why."

"I'm not strong..."

Tae-yeon muttered to himself, but everyone ignored him. Kim Hui-yeon said:

"God...?"

"Wouldn't we have believed in God in this situation?"

The monsters that covered the earth, and the labyrinth. The forced returns and the destroyed earth.

If everyone had believed in God, such things wouldn't have happened. Those who believed in religion died or descended into the labyrinth, filled with doubts in their hearts.

The mountain was the same. At first, it had called out God's name. But later, it erased God's existence from its mind.

People want to believe in God, but they couldn't.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san muttered to himself.

"Is that person me?"

"Maybe so. Older brother has become a source of strength for us, after all."

People rely on Tae-san, finding solace in their minds.

Tae-san gazed at the people looking up at him from the ground.

Their faces did not show despair or sadness.

Only longing for Tae-san was visible.

At the time of his third reincarnation, people's expressions were not like that. The quest for reincarnation appeared, and many people left a will and committed suicide in the community.

Considering that a significant proportion of the deceased in the labyrinth were suicides, it seemed that people had gained mental peace, and Tae-san was likely the one who brought them peace of mind.

"Even if Uncle doesn't need to do anything for them, just pretend not to see them. It's enough for them to find a place of solace in their minds and rely on something."

Jung-geun spoke with a bitter expression, and no one else could open their mouths in response.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's too reckless to say such a thing, isn't it? Even without that, everyone is already relying on you, and adding this burden to their minds is... You can do as you please, just as you like."

"It's fine."

Tai-san shook his head.

"Just don't worry about it, okay? It's not a difficult task, and it's fine if you don't care."

Jung-geun's face brightened up.

* * *

After that, Tai-san didn't actively respond to people, but he didn't avoid them either.

He received their admiration calmly and moved forward. As a result, the fervor of their admiration for him grew even stronger.

[Your divine power has increased by 1%.]

And once again, your divine power level rose.

It was only natural that people would worship him.

"It doesn't matter if it's useless, after all."

Your divine power was currently useless. It was a skill that could be used only in conjunction with other skills, but you didn't even know what those skills were.

But since it was continuously increasing, you didn't feel bad about it.

As Tai-san calmly received their admiration, people also began to slowly start doing their own tasks.

Finally, the simple cultivation began to bear fruit.

"Wow!"
Here is the translation of the text:

People gazed in wonder at the rapidly growing vegetables.

Just a few minutes had passed and the corn had grown perfectly.

"It tastes pretty good!"

"This is..."

The problem of food was solved, and people were overjoyed. They once again looked at Tai Shan with admiration and respect.

As they lived in peace for a moment, a new special quest appeared.

[One week later. Heading towards Seoul City Hall.]

"It's finally Seoul, isn't it."

People began to prepare. They sharpened their weapons and stored food. Although some people were afraid or nervous due to Tai Shan's presence, there were few.

And Tai Shan had something to do.

He shook his sword.

"Look at this."

"Oh no... "

Lee Tae-yeon held his sword with a frightened face.

"Haven't you learned swordsmanship?"

"But your proficiency is 0%... "

"I'm going to raise it, so let's take a look first. I've adjusted the stats evenly, so why are you afraid?"

Tai Shan urged him, and Lee Tae-yeon hesitated for a moment before rushing to Tai Shan.

"Hey!"
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san shook his sword. He smoothly drew out Taeyeon's sword and hit her on the shoulder.

"Uh!"

"That's not what you're supposed to do!"

Tae-san explained, seemingly frustrated.

"You've learned to swing and strike, right? Bring back the feeling you had when you learned it, and use it with your sword."

"I don't care what you say..."

Taeyeon looked confused.

Tae-san stroked his chin. The ghostly figure chuckled.

[Isn't it hard?]

"I don't think I can be a good teacher."

The sword technique he created. Ability Sword.

On the title of the sword's technique, it was written that it was possible to master the technique. This time, his goal was to pass down the sword technique. Since the effectiveness of Ability Sword was great, if he could learn it, the clearance probability would increase significantly. Therefore, Tae-san was currently passing down Ability Sword to Taeyeon and Kang Jun-hyeok.

Outside the labyrinth, it was not possible to learn skills, but since Ability Sword was a skill he created himself, there did not seem to be any problem with passing it down.

However, the problem was not that.
Here is the translation of the text:

When Taesan first learned the technique of the "Pulmudae's Sword", his proficiency was at 0%. Therefore, the ghost told him that he would have to work hard to increase his proficiency, and Taesan solved this problem by using the "Proficiency-Enhancing Potion". However, Lee Taeyoon and Kang Junhyuk didn't have such a special item, so they had to increase their proficiency on their own.

"Next, it's your turn."

Kang Junhyuk ran towards Taesan with his eyes shining.

Taesan blocked Kang Junhyuk's sword with his own and offered some advice.

"Did you learn how to slash, strike, and counterattack?"

"Yes!"

Both of them had descended to the 10th floor or lower. At this level, they should have had at least a few usable skills.

"Remember when you acquired a skill, and use that sense with your sword."

Taesan's sword moved smoothly. He used Kang Junhyuk's sword to strike his chest.

"Ahh!"

Kang Junhyuk fell to the ground. Taesan muttered to himself calmly.

"It's not easy, though."

"Even if I tell you to spread it out with your sword... "

Kang Junhyuk complained and got up. Kim Hwiyeon, who was watching, opened her mouth.

"I'm jealous. We can't even learn it."

Taesan was going to teach the "Ability Sword" to Kim Hwiyeon and Geom Junggeun, but it didn't work out.

"Is it because we're in hard mode?"
Here is the translation:

"It's not like that, you know. Even people in solo mode couldn't do it, you know what I mean."

I tried to teach people who were still at the solo mode level, but it didn't work out. The only ones who were possible were Taeyeon and Kang Junhyuk.

"No matter what, you have to learn."

Tae-san calmly drew his sword.

"People won't die, so that's okay."

But he couldn't do everything alone.

He could save a few people, but not a majority. So he needed the help of Taeyeon and Kang Junhyuk even more.

The two of them gritted their teeth and drew their swords.

Time passed like that.

A week went by, and they began to head towards Seoul.
