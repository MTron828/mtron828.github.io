Chapter 511

511. 94th Floor, Easy Mode (4)

[Bug? In a labyrinth?]

"Strictly speaking, this isn't a labyrinth."

If it were Alon mode, bugs wouldn't exist. The wizards and Balbam manage it directly. They would fix any bugs that appear.

But it wasn't the case here. There was something like an administrator, but there was no one to fix bugs.

"I don't know if there's a limit to pretending, but... there are quite a few minor bugs."

Taesan said nonchalantly.

The bugs he found while clearing easy mode weren't just one or two. If you included the meaningless ones, there were over a dozen.

The bug on the 98th floor was one of them.

[What kind of bug is this that you can get something by multiplying?]

"Just take a look. It's not fun to explain beforehand."

Taesan kicked off into the air.

His body began to fall rapidly, and spores were launched. Taesan swung his sword.

While removing the spores, he landed on the ground and climbed back up the cliff.

He repeated that process.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I wonder how many times I've repeated this, but Taesan's mana has finally reached the bottom.

"'Stats are too crappy,' I said.

I had a lot of trouble with stats on Earth, but it wasn't a big deal here. Taesan leveled up.

[You have reached the maximum state.]

I drank from the Fountain of Life and descended back into the labyrinth. I started falling again in the maximum state.

Ka-ga-ga!

I wielded my sword, stabbed the spore, and landed on the ground. I didn't remove the cannon. The spore shot by the cannon was part of the acquisition condition.

I used a big jump to climb up the cliff again.

And then I fell again.

I repeated this process, and repeated it again. I didn't need to rest. The Fountain of Life solved all my physical and mental fatigue.

A week passed like that, and this week was over.

Quack!

I beheaded the spore, stabbed it, and trampled on it. I accelerated and landed on the ground.

The process was perfect, with no room for improvement or reduction.

At least from Bardley's perspective, there was no flaw to be found. It felt like I had seen a perfect work of art."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, Taesan's face was unsatisfactory.

"It's still lacking."

More sharply, more cleanly. Taesan climbed up the cliff again and jumped down.

A month passed like that.

[Uh...].

Bardley was surprised. He had seen Taesan repeat and strive to acquire skills, but he had never invested this much time in preparation.

Ka-ga-gak!

Taesan's body was like a machine, engraving the series of falling movements into his muscles. He didn't even need to think, his body moved automatically with repetition. Yet, Taesan's face was still unsatisfied.

"It's still a little lacking."

[...Is it still lacking in this state?]

"I need to surpass perfection."

Body and mind. Those two needed to be in harmony, becoming one. To achieve that, he needed to invest more than a month's time.

"I guess this is the starting point, at least."

Taesan climbed up the cliff again.

From there, he looked down at the ground.

His eyes were more sunken than before.

This is where it really begins. Taesan took a step forward.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You activated your landing.] [You activated your super acceleration.] [You activated your physical time acceleration.]

Your body accelerates. It's incredibly fast.

A flash of light appears, and you start falling towards the ground.

[Huh?]

Kugugugung!

The cannon fires late, and the spores rush towards the mountain. The mountain uses its acceleration to swing its sword down.

Quat.

[124 damage to the spore.]

The spore splits in half.

The other spores can't even approach the mountain. The mountain lands on the ground in an instant.

[...What's going on? With that stat, it's possible to achieve that kind of speed?]

Bardley is shocked. Just now, the mountain was incredibly fast. Even in its prime, it wouldn't have been able to react that quickly.

It wasn't a speed that could be achieved with a stat of only around 100.

"I managed to survive until the end with this stat," the mountain said calmly. If it couldn't even reach this level, it wouldn't have been able to defeat an S-grade monster. Bardley's eyes widened.

[It's crazy, but even more surprising.]

The more he saw, the more amazed he was.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In this mode, even the players in the alone mode, who are hard to react, are reaching an extreme speed that is impossible to follow.

This was the fastest speed he had ever created.

'But.'

This was not enough.

Faster and more accurate.

Taesan went up again and fell.

[You activated the landing skill.] [You activated the acceleration skill.]

Falling again.

This time, it was different from before. The sword was swung even before the cannon was fired. The cannon was fired, and the sword, which was swung, was cut in half without even reacting to the speed.

And with a kick, he accelerated even more. Taesan landed on the ground.

The process of dealing with the speed became even more refined. The speed was slightly faster than before, but it was definitely faster.

'Again.'

Going up and falling again, activating the skill.

Although the landing and acceleration skills didn't consume a lot of mana, the mana he currently had was only around 50. With just a few attempts, his mana was depleted. Taesan used a mana potion to recover and repeated the process again.

Quack.

As the speed increased, his mind and body began to adapt gradually."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Through numerous repetitions, Bardley could now predict it as well.

[Multiplication is similar to addition, with conditions.]

'I caught on.'

[It's strange that you didn't notice it until now.] [I still don't get it, though…….] [Akasha, you're not an adventurer from the start, are you?]

From Bardley's perspective as an adventurer, it was clear. Taesan was now focusing on increasing speed and accuracy to deal more damage. It was a clear attempt to increase damage.

'Addition doesn't rely on any skills except for persistence and can increase damage twofold.'

[Multiplication is okay with skills, but it will increase damage exponentially.]

'Not all skills. You can't use skills directly related to damage.'

If that were the case, they could have easily obtained it using addition or other skills. But that wasn't possible.

Bardley shook his head.

[It's ridiculous. Really.]

To deal damage equivalent to the square of attack power, they had to rely solely on pure speed and repetition.

[I see why it was impossible in the original world.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As the attack power increases, the condition itself becomes nearly impossible to fulfill. Taesan had an attack power of 30,000. It was impossible for even Taesan to bring out that kind of power without an attack-boosting skill.

So, I moved to the easy mode timeline with lower attack power and acquired it.

Now that I've figured out the reason, there's still something strange.

[It doesn't seem like I can fulfill that condition here.]

"I told you, it's a bug."

Taesan gripped his sword tightly.

His accelerated body had also adapted. Now was the time for infinite challenges.

"Let's go."

Taesan took out dozens of potions from his inventory.

[You used a speed-boosting potion.] [You used a void-jumping potion.] [You activated the fairy's powder.] [You used a mental focus potion.]

He used numerous potions and items. His physical and mental state became even stronger.

Whoa.

His body soared through the air.

He activated a skill while falling.

[You activated a landing skill.] [You activated a super-acceleration skill.]

The speed was now faster than ever before.

It was a speed that would make even Bardley momentarily lose sight of him.

But this was still not enough."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"To trigger the bug, a little more was needed. And the conditions that could fulfill it started to operate.

Kugugugu!

The cannons fired. The spears flew towards the mountain.

The mountain took a small breath, and its body twisted.

It grasped the sword and cut one of the spears in half.

[Dealt 153 damage to the spear.]

And it kicked another spear, accelerating even more. Its body reached an incredible speed that was impossible for a physical body to achieve.

Just as the mountain was about to reach the ground, the space around it began to distort.

[Huh?]

Kkikikikik.

A metallic screeching sound echoed. The distorted space, like a judge, grasped the mountain.

The system of the labyrinth began to malfunction.

"Alright."

The mountain raised the corner of its mouth.

Kugugugu!

Beyond the distorted space, something was staring at the mountain.

Its gaze was emotionless, like a machine performing its given role without feeling anything.

Kagagagak!

The mountain's body began to distort and twist. The series of actions seemed like a test to determine whether the mountain's actions were correct or not.

……Click."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The sound of closure echoes. I examine and review each and every one of Taesan's.

……Click.

Click.

And the answer comes out.

As my gaze disappears, the distorted space collapses.

And Taesan's body moves.

It wasn't on the ground.

It moves to the location where it started falling.

Whooooaaa!

The body, still accelerating, falls again. Bardley is shocked.

[Wait, what?]

Taesan, still falling, swings his sword again. The spore splits.

[Deals 167 damage to Spore.]

It reaches the ground faster than before. And just as it's about to land, the space distorts and twists again.

Taesan, about to fall again, moves to the spot where he jumped off the cliff.

His body is still accelerating. It falls towards the ground at an even faster speed.

"It's some kind of infinite loop."

[What the hell is going on…….]

"The one who created this mode isn't a magician."

This is a distorted space created by the high priest's power.

"That's why there are many bugs, you see."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There were several bugs in this place, where things that didn't exist in this world were involved in the laws and created something, or maybe something went wrong during the copying process.

It wasn't just Taesan who knew about it. Any player remaining in easy mode knew about it.

For example, there was a space that infinitely expanded in the cracks of the labyrinth.

Or, if you stuck your body to the wall on a certain floor, you could break through the wall.

Or, if you brought water from the Fountain of Life on another floor, the effect of the fountain would be reversed.

There were many bugs, including ones that helped them, like item duplication.

But I never used them in actual combat.

That's because whenever a bug was triggered, something distorted would always appear.

It's unclear whether the creator of the labyrinth or the system itself was responsible. One thing was certain, though: it intervened to prevent the use of bugs.

"And according to that guy's judgment, even achieving a certain speed in this place was considered a bug."

In easy mode, if you exceeded a certain speed, the labyrinth's system would detect an anomaly and send your body back to its previous location before acceleration."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The amusing thing was that the acceleration itself remained the same.

I don't know what that is. Why don't they fix the bug itself and instead just block access, and why do they reset the speed to before the acceleration instead of looping it? It was a concept that didn't exist in his easy mode understanding.

But as soon as Taesan realized that existence, he immediately thought.

Can't we use that twisted existence to obtain skills?

After numerous challenges and efforts, and countless attempts, Taesan finally realized that he could use the 98th floor.

And in the end, he obtained the multiplication skill.

His body became even faster. He tore through the spore.

[Dealt 189 damage to the spore.]

One of the characteristics of landing.

The longer the activation time, the more it accelerates.

And there was no limit to that acceleration.

One of the laws of this place. The faster the speed, the higher the damage.

Taesan focused his mind."
