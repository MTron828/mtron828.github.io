21. 2nd Floor, Rakiratas, the God of Struggle and Death (6)

[Rakiratas proposes a covenant to you.]

"Huh?"

Taesan is bewildered.

"A covenant? What's this?"

Taesan cautiously looks at the window. However, no explanation appears no matter how long he waits.

"Am I supposed to make the choice?"

Taesan sits down hesitantly and strokes his chin.

A covenant of the apostle. Just like Taeyeon had run away without being proposed. There was no information about what kind of covenant this was.

Taesan recalls the system window.

[Rakiratas' interference area has decreased.]

Before the covenant proposal window, this appeared. Judging from the system window showing that the interference area also decreased when strengthening Rakiratas' breed, it seemed that there was a penalty for the god himself to exert influence.

He seemed to want to make him his apostle despite receiving such penalties.

Though closer to goodwill than to an adversary, Taesan felt a hesitant emotion.

The opponent is a god.
Itaeyeon said they were acting on their own, and Taesan felt it enough himself. Strengthening the trial in the middle of it. If he had been a little weaker, it would have been dangerous.

Would an offer from such a being really benefit him?

It was hard to guarantee that the goodwill of the god would align with his goals.

There was also a sufficient possibility of living as a slave like Rakiratas' breed.

Taesan made his decision.

"I refuse."

[You have rejected Rakiratas' proposal. The apostle's covenant is put on hold.]

He did not erupt in anger at the rejection. Whether the gods were merciful to those they acknowledged or if Rakiratas was like that, they instead suspended the contract as if saying to choose at any time.

It was fortunate. It meant they wouldn't withhold compensation out of spite.

[Rakiratas gives you a reward. You received [Rakiratas' ceremonial sword].]

A mist gathered and soon a crimson longsword appeared before Taesan. Not a speck of rust, it was incredibly sharp.

Taesan's eyes lit up at the sight of the quite impressive weapon.
[The Ritual Sword of Rakiratas] [Attack Power +5] [Recovers 5 HP upon defeating an enemy.] [This is the sword used by those who worship Rakiratas, stained red with the blood of sacrifices.]

Taesan's pupils momentarily froze. He blinked to make sure he wasn't seeing things wrong.

"Is this for real?"

With an unchanged description, Taesan chuckled in disbelief.

"Wow. Can you really give me something like this?"

An attack power of 5. This wasn't an item obtainable on the 2nd floor. Currently, his attack power was 4. With this weapon, it would become 7. If he wielded dual swords, it would be 9.

Simply in terms of attack power, it was nearly a doubling. In terms of damage, it was about 30% stronger.

On top of that, it had a special effect. Recovering 5 HP upon defeating an enemy. It was a small but greatly felt effect.

"Awesome."

It was a reward worthy of the hardships endured. Taesan was quite satisfied, but the rewards weren't over yet.

[You have cleared the enhanced trial. Additional rewards follow.] [You have obtained the special passive skill [Proof of Struggle].]

It was a skill he didn't know about. If the first reward was a sword with an attack power of 5, the skill would likely be a very good one too. Taesan confirmed with anticipation.
[Special Passive Skill: Proof of Struggle] [Proficiency: 1%] [You have proven your struggle. You grow stronger with each victory over your enemies.]

"Acceleration Skill?"

A skill that boosts speed and stats. Such skills were called acceleration skills. Many players found them useful as buffs.

Proof of Struggle seemed to be one of those skills. The exact performance would only be known once used, but as a reward given directly by a god, it couldn't be that bad.

But Rakiratas didn't stop there.

[Sub Quest Initiated] [Rakiratas wishes to give you another trial, having excelled in his own trials.] [Condition: Kill enemies on the 2nd and 3rd floors and return.] [Reward: Determined by Rakiratas based on your achievements.]

"..."

Taesan stared blankly at the quest window. He hesitated to accept it, knowing Rakiratas had already changed the nature of trials before.

Taesan made his decision.

"I decline."

Once betrayed, one could always be betrayed again. Taesan refused the quest.

[You have declined the sub quest.]

Then the window appeared once again.
[Sub Quest Initiated] [Rakiratas wishes to give you another trial, having excelled in his own trials.] [Condition: Kill enemies on the 2nd and 3rd floors and return.] [Reward: Determined by Rakiratas based on your achievements.]

"..."

The description of mercy was added. Taesan, who let out a slight chuckle, accepted this time.

This quest involved eliminating existing entities in the maze, not something that appears as a trial. It seemed Rakiratas had no intention of playing tricks, judging by the changed quest window, so accepting it didn't seem problematic.

[Sub Quest Initiated] [Rakiratas is pleased with your choice.]

It would be best to kill them all if you kill them all. If all the enemies on the 2nd and 3rd floors are killed, you will spend a lot of time here. He planned to prepare before then.

Taesan returned to the store.

* * *

"Why are you here so soon?"

"I have something to buy. Potions cost 200 gold, right?"

"200 gold... and you're buying them already?"

"I think I'll need them."

Originally, he hadn't planned to use them on the lower floors, but after seeing the strengthening of the trial, his thoughts changed.

Places like Rakiratas' altar aren't just one place.

You never know when or where something might come down.
At those times, having healing potions meant he could get through without major issues.

Even this time, with just potions, clearing the stage became much easier.

Currently, Taesan had a total of 650 gold.

He also considered selling unused equipment. Taesan pulled out a rusty sword and a crude bow.

"How much for these?"

"Those two? I'll give you 100 gold each."

850 gold. He could buy four of them.

"Do you also sell mana potions?"

"We have them, but they're more expensive. 250 gold each."

"In that case, I'll take one of those and three healing potions."

"Alright."

The dwarf briskly traded gold and potions. Three red potions and one blue potion ended up in Taesan's possession.

[Health Potion] [Restores 50% of health.] [Mana Potion] [Restores 50% of mana.]

Basic preparations were complete. Taesan stowed the potions in his inventory. The dwarf, who had been eyeing Taesan intently, suddenly frowned.

"...That sword."

In the dwarf's gaze was a ceremonial blade from Rakiratas.

"Rakiratas. Did you receive that from that pervert?"

"A pervert?"
"Someone who enjoys watching others fight and calls it enlightenment, what a pervert, right?"

The dwarf spoke with a displeased expression about Rakiratas.

"Considering you received that, you must have passed some trial. It might be too much of an item for you right now... But once received, you can't just take it away."

Indeed, the dwarf seemed uneasy about Taesan receiving the weapon. Gods and NPCs—though it wasn't entirely clear how they differed, they didn't seem particularly friendly towards each other.

"But I did anticipate this. I figured you'd manage to clear it sufficiently."

"I almost died though."

"Oh. Almost died?"

The dwarf's face hardened. He asked seriously.

"Could it be that the trials suddenly intensified?"

Taesan nodded. The dwarf's expression twisted.

"That insane god still hasn't corrected his behavior."

"Was he always like this?"

"He's always been like that with those he favors. Constantly undermining my domain, what's the point? If he were fostering talent, I could understand, but he's just making everyone suffer. What's his game?"

The dwarf regarded Taesan with a mixture of awe and disbelief.
"So far, I've died multiple times, but I endured and survived again. Must be because that pervert likes you."

The dwarf seemed knowledgeable about Rakiratas. Taesan asked him,

"May I ask one thing? What is the Pact of the Apostle?"

"Hmm?"

The dwarf's face showed surprise.

"Did Rakiratas propose it to you?"

"Yes. Since there was no explanation, I put it on hold for now."

"That's a wise decision. It's not an issue to decide on lightly. About that pact... How long has it been?"

After pondering for a while, the dwarf spoke with a grimace.

"Sorry, but I can't answer that."

"...I see."

Taesan looked at the dwarf with a strange expression, hesitating but unable to respond. The dwarf explained defensively,

"It can't be helped. The only role I can play for you is that of a shopkeeper. I can't do more than that. That's part of the contract."

"The contract?"

"Why do you think I'm bound here?"

The dwarf snorted in irritation. With a gesture indicating he didn't want to discuss it further, he said,

"You've bought everything you need to live. Now go quickly."
Staying closer didn't seem like he would give any indication of an answer. Taesan asked one thing.

"Can you show me the items you showed me last time?"

"I don't have any money, remember?"

"I plan to buy later."

"Hmm... Wait a moment."

The dwarf showed the items. Numerous items. There were earrings, rings, and the like.

Among them, there was an item that caught Taesan's eye.

[Iron Cross Necklace] [Attack +1] [A necklace worn by those who worshiped the god of war. They believed it protected them, though it's useless.] [600G]

"Ah, there it is."

After confirming, Taesan turned away.

"I'll come back next time."

"Let's meet on the next floor if possible."

"That seems difficult."

He planned to visit the store frequently.

* * *

NPC. And the god.

When Taesan judged in the alone mode, those two were the most important. Taesan opened the community.

[Gang Taesan [Alone]: Are you there?] [Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: Ah, hyung. Hello.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Ah, it's Mr. Taesan. Hello.] [Gang Taesan [Alone]: Have you met the Holy Knight?]
It was almost time to meet the Holy Knight. Taesan intended to verify what relationship they had with Ainzhar.

[Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: We did meet.] [Gang Taesan [Alone]: How did it go?] [Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: ... Hyung, it's different from what we've heard?] [Gang Taesan [Alone]: What do you mean out of the blue?] [Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: The Holy Knight. He just spat once and left.]

Taesan paused.

[Gang Taesan [Alone]: You couldn't stop him?] [Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: Stop that? Even if I tried to react, my body wouldn't move. He just imposed his presence and that was it.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: I met the Holy Knight too, and it was the same. No matter how I tried to move, it was impossible.] [Gang Taesan [Alone]: You guys too?]

Understanding the attack and being able to respond are different matters altogether. Ainzhar's strike itself was imposing enough to render opposition futile. Even though it was a very slow strike, the reason Taesan had to block it was precisely because of that.

Still, he thought that if it were Lee Taeyeon or Gang Junhyuk, they might have been able to respond if they had known beforehand, but it seemed impossible.
[Gang Taesan [Alone]: So, what happened? Did he stick around?]
[Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: He did stick around. But he spat and told me to scram. Said I'm worthless to him.]
[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Taesan, what he said was quite different from what he told you.]

Taesan tapped his chin thoughtfully.

One thing became certain. Ainzhar considered only those who could respond to his attacks as valuable individuals worthy of his respect.

Thinking about it, dwarves were somewhat similar. Taeyeon mentioned feeling very sorry for dwarves when they acted insolently or tried to do something.

Yet Ainzhar treated them with great kindness.

Likely, Rakiratas wasn't much different either.

In fact, dwarves might have been even more so than Ainzhar. They would likely ridicule and mock those who did not accept their trials, seeing them as beneath consideration, in spite of their clear rewards for achievement.

After organizing his thoughts for a moment, Taesan posted his message.

[Gang Taesan [Alone]: Where are they both right now?]
[Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: I'm currently grappling with the Big Rat.]
[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Same here. I want to go down and level up a bit before I go down.]
[Gang Taesan [Alone]: What about the others?]
[Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: A few people have already caught the Big Rat. But won't it take a bit more time?]
Players were still in the adaptation phase. It took time for them to move beyond the 1st floor.

"I'll tell you later."

Taesan organized the priority of information in his mind. What he was about to teach now was information about the boss.

[Gang Taesan [Alone]: When you go down to the 2nd floor, there's a boss mob there, right? It's called Giant Rat, an enhanced version of Big Rat. Its health is over 200, and it deals damage even when blocked, so be careful.] [Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: ...How do we defeat something like that?] [Gang Taesan [Alone]: Think about it. I can't give away the method too.]

He intended to guide the way, not lead them.

If he revealed everything, they would lose the ability to clear the labyrinth relying on him. It would be detrimental to both sides.

Itaeyeon had already defeated the Giant Rat with her own strength. With her and Junhyuk, it was entirely possible.

[Gang Taesan [Alone]: If you think about it a bit, you'll find a way. Tell other players not to enter the red door and die for no reason.] [Lee Itaeyeon [Alone]: Yes. Thank you.] [Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: I'll give it my all.]
Taesan closed the community. With those two, they should be able to descend to the 2nd floor without any issues.

"Now I need to gather some money."

He possessed the skill of Ailak Weaponry. It was an incredible skill that allowed attack power equipment to be applied to any part, regardless of where it was equipped.

However, he hadn't yet found a way to use it effectively. He had only increased the attack power by two with the ring and unarmed gloves.

So, he thought about buying something from the shop.

The dwarf showed many pieces of equipment. There were necklaces, earrings, rings, and other such things.

"Since I have to catch all of them anyway, it's a good thing."

Lakyratath's quest. You have to catch all the monsters on the  had ي such are of ש Even
