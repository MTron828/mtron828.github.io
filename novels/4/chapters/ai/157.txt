Article 158

158. 34th Floor (2)

[Special Activation Skill: Spirit Transformation] [Proficiency: 1%] [It changes the state of the soul into physical strength and takes hold of the body. The user will lose their life after a certain period of time has passed.] [Huh?]

A ghost who had read the explanation was startled and said:

[Lose your life? But you're a spirit?]

Tae-san scratched his head. The effect seemed to be the same as what the goddess' messenger had written. It was transforming the state of the soul into physical strength itself.

However, the price was slightly different from the ghost's explanation.

It wasn't damaged, but only lost its life.

[Huh? Is it because of the Spirit Promotion? Can it be transformed like this?]

The ghost was flustered and continued to mutter to himself. It was because the story didn't make sense from his perspective.

Spirit Falling is a disaster that destroys one's soul, but it also gives one immense power.

Even Tae-san, who had easily won against the previous messenger without any problems, was almost killed by the Spirit Falling skill. This was evident just by looking at it.

The fall of the soul was a fair price for the power.
Here is the translation of the text:

That was a life he had exchanged for something.

"However, that was an unchanging fact."

If he lost his life or soul, he would not change his mind about dying. Regardless of which one he lost, it was impossible to continue exploring the labyrinth.

'No.'

Tae-san narrowed his eyes.

'...Can it be done?'

Tae-san remembered the skill he possessed.

The skill given to him by Fabsha after he cleared his trial.

[SPECIAL ACTIVE SKILL: The Proven One's Ascension] [You have won against another version of yourself. When you reach the point of death, your soul will receive Fabsha's trial.]

There was nothing certain. The possibility that this skill would deviate from his expectations was sufficient.

'But.'

He had enough hidden cards.

"Let's think about it later."

The problem was unclear. He couldn't test it with his life as the stake.

The first use had to be in a real battle.

[... Ah, then.]

The ghost barely agreed. Tae-san continued to confirm.

Sado-hwa also rose one step with the system change caused by ascension to a ghost.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Special Skill: Sadohwa [Rakiratas]] [The power of the god of struggle and death, bestowed upon me for the first time since my birth. For 20 minutes, I will possess some of the power of Rakiratas' apostles. This skill cannot be used for a full day after activation.]

The duration of the skill has been doubled from 10 minutes to 20 minutes. Sadohwa is a very useful skill that not only increases my soul's level but also my stats, so it's a great change.

[Is it really going to transform into that?]

A ghostly voice whispered.

Sadohwa is a skill granted by God himself. It's a skill given by Rakiratas, who governs two areas.

The ascension of the soul is interfering with such skills.

'Is this even more powerful than I thought?'

As the ghost sorted out its thoughts, Tae-san also finished all his preparations.

"Alright."

Tae-san clenched his fists.

As a saint, Tae-san is a formidable opponent who would even risk his life, but he was able to obtain a reward commensurate with his strength.

After completing all the checks, Tae-san moved forward into the labyrinth.

[Start of 34th floor quest.] [Defeat the boss of the 34th floor and pass through.] [Reward: Ring of Haturia.] [Secret reward: ???]

The monsters on the 34th floor were knights wearing black armor.

"Death Knight?"

[There is no feeling of death.]

"Just a similar appearance."

Clang.
Here is the translation of the text:

The black knight galloped forward. The grandmaster pointed to the space, aiming at the Taesan's neck.

Taesan lightly grasped his sword and clashed with the knight's sword.

Thud.

The knight flew away far in the distance.

Taesan walked calmly, and the knight, wobbling and regaining his balance, galloped forward again.

Hmph!

This time, the knight didn't retreat. He started a fierce battle with Taesan.

He stomped on the ground, using his entire body to channel his strength into his sword.

The power that was contained in the knight's sword was something that a normal 34th-floor adventurer couldn't easily withstand.

However, Taesan didn't feel any pressure.

"How did you change?"

The reason he didn't immediately knock the knight down was because he was checking the effect of the changed ability sword.

Taesan infused his strength into his sword. As a result, the knight's knee bent, and Taesan's sword rose upwards.

[You have activated the stance.]

Instantly, the force that was suppressing the knight amplified.

The knight's knee hit the ground, and despite that, he couldn't withstand and his body collapsed, with his sword slowly bending and breaking.

Taesan looked down at the knight, his hand infused with strength.
Here is the translation of the text:

The knight was unable to withstand the force and dropped his sword, splitting in half.

"What's this feeling?"

There were a few new skills that had changed with the increased proficiency of the Ability Sword. One of them was Landing.

[Special activation skill: Landing] [Mana consumption: 20] [Proficiency: 5%] [Brings the body in the air to the ground.] [Condition: Advanced swordsmanship [Ability Sword] [When your sword is higher than your opponent's weapon, you can strongly knock them down.]

I tried it out and understood its meaning.

"It's similar to jumping, but different."

Jumping was a skill that allowed you to strongly lift your opponent up when they were below you. The difference was in whether they were above or below you, as explained.

Tae-san then passed the test to the next stage and experimented with another knight.

This time, he jumped up to the opponent's head and activated the Landing skill.

Ka-ka-aa!

Despite being in a situation where he couldn't muster his strength, the skill activated without a problem. The weight of the sword's impact was unbearable, and the knight's body was crushed.

Tae-san, who had watched the entire process, lit up with a bright look.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unlike jumping or using a powerful skill, Taesan's skill was activated without any power being applied. Despite being in a situation where there was nowhere to stand, I was able to launch a proper attack.

However, there is a condition that the sword must be higher than the opponent's weapon, but since the skill's effect is effective, it's only natural to solve this problem, so it wasn't a big issue.

After verifying, Taesan moved on to find another enemy.

The changed skill was not just a landing.

The knight who was waiting in the next room rushed towards me.

[You have activated the "Quelling" skill.]

Ka.

Taesan's sword clashed with the knight's sword. Taesan frowned.

Taesan infused power into his sword and sent the knight flying, verifying the "Quelling" skill.

[Special activation skill: Quelling] [Mana consumption: 30] [Proficiency: 1%] [Reduces the ratio of damage received. It's still a very small ratio.] [Condition: High-ranking swordsmanship [Ability Sword] [When the sword collides with the opponent, it slightly reduces the burden on the sword.]

"Is this applicable?"

[Can you tell at this level of difference?]

The ghost said it with a natural tone.

Note: "Quelling" skill is likely a defensive skill that reduces damage taken, and "Ability Sword" is an ability that allows the sword to withstand the burden of colliding with the opponent's sword.
Here is the translation:

The changed skill reduced the burden on the sword and was a skill that was not easily defeated by strong enemies. However, the difference in strength between him and the knight was overwhelming.

It was barely possible to verify its effectiveness against such an opponent.

"Aww, too bad."

Tae-san dodged the charging knight with a single blow. It was a decisive move.

"Then I won't be able to check anything else."

The changed skill had more to it, but it seemed difficult to verify its effectiveness against such an opponent.

[Should I check again?]

"It seems I have to."

Tae-san nodded and headed forward.

*Tae-san became stronger.*

He passed through the divine realm and defeated the forgotten goddess's messenger, gaining numerous powers.

He was already strong, but he became even stronger.

Now, the 34th-floor monster was no match for him.

Even ordinary attacks couldn't block him, and he could easily knock them back into a state of near-death.

In fact, he didn't even need a sword.

"Ha ha ha."

The unexpected side effect was that the current labyrinth didn't evoke any excitement in him.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san was able to conquer the floors without any obstacles and contacted other players for the first time in a long while.

[I-tae-yeon [Alone] : We are currently conquering the 12th floor.] [Kang Tae-san [Alone] : Really? It's faster than expected.]

The last time they contacted each other, Tae-san said they were conquering the 10th floor, so it was expected that they would be conquering the 11th floor by now. But it turns out they've already reached the 12th floor, which is much faster than expected.

I-tae-yeon explained his doubts.

[I-tae-yeon [Alone] : It's all thanks to Tae-san's efforts.] [Kang Tae-san [Alone] : My efforts?] [I-tae-yeon [Alone] : The blessing of struggle and death. That's why I've become stronger.] [Kang Tae-san [Alone] : Ah, that's what you meant?] [I-tae-yeon [Alone] : Yeah, isn't it amazing?]

Tae-san defeated a B-grade monster while receiving a blessing from Rakiratas, which granted him the abilities of struggle and death. Although it is written that he also obtained the ability to overcome death, the meaning is difficult to understand. What's important is the ability to struggle.

The process of battle has definitely changed from before. Tae-san has also become more agile and fast, so it's likely that others will feel a greater impact.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I've had an idea, so let's contact Geomjun too. He also said something similar. Thanks to their talents in struggle and death, they can break through faster than before," he said.

[Kim Joon-kyun [Hard]: Ah, hyung, do you know that?] [Gang Tae-san [Alone]: What's that?] [Kim Joon-kyun [Hard]: Uh... about other people in a different mode.] [Gang Tae-san [Alone]: I don't know. I'm not interested either.]

At this moment, Tae-san was inviting Lee Tae-yeon and Kim Joon-kyun to talk. Since it wasn't through a community, he didn't know what kind of situation the community was in.

[Kim Joon-kyun [Hard]: You don't know?] [Gang Tae-san [Alone]: What don't you know? Explain it to me.] [Kim Joon-kyun [Hard]: Hmm... how do I put it. Simply put, people are worshiping you.]

Tae-san was taken aback.

[Gang Tae-san [Alone]: What's that?] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Eh? You haven't checked it yet?] [Gang Tae-san [Alone]: Why am I looking at them talking?]

Since the community didn't have any nutritional value for Tae-san, he didn't even glance at it.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Taeyeon [Alone] : Then, when you have time, let's confirm it once. There shouldn't be any major issues, but if we don't know, we might run into problems.]

[Taesun [Alone] : Got it. Ah, yes.]

[Taeyeon [Alone] : Is that all you have?]

[Taesun [Alone] : You guys have gone beyond the 10th floor, didn't you?]

[Taeyeon [Alone] : Yes.]

So, at that moment, we were about to meet the guide of sin.

[Taesun [Alone] : If those who call themselves the guide of sin appear, it's better to follow my words.]

But that was not a good method, it was a way to solve the problem immediately.

After hearing Taesan's explanation, they let out a sigh.

[Taeyeon [Alone] : Hmm... Do we have to?]

[Gang Jun-hyuk [Alone] : It doesn't feel right to me... ]

[Taesun [Alone] : It doesn't feel right, but there's no other way. You guys can't do what I can do either. So, what can we do?]

Although they looked a bit uneasy, they agreed.

After finishing his explanation, Taesan closed the window and opened the community.

He remained silent.

[Hana [Normal] : Where do you think Taesan is now?]

[Kim Se-in [Normal] : He probably hasn't gone beyond the 50th floor, has he? Of course, he must have done that much.]

[Eun-ha [Alone] : We'll just wait. He'll save us, won't he?]

After briefly browsing the community, Taesan quickly closed the window.
Here is the translation:

"It seemed like my mind would become confused if I looked at it for a little longer."

"What's going on?"

"What's the matter?"

The Taesan explained to the ghost. The ghost listened quietly and then opened its mouth.

"Is it not an unusual story?"

"Yes?"

"If everyone had obtained the talent for struggle and death, then it would be a great achievement. And people would naturally worship those who have achieved such a feat. And if it benefits themselves, then so be it."

"Is that so?"

It was definitely different from the previous life. At that time, it was only myself who was strong, but now I had helped everyone become strong.

"There's nothing unusual."

It's just worship, not something direct.

Taesan carefully sorted out his thoughts and began to tackle the labyrinth again.

Even though I walked slowly, I had already arrived at the boss's room. It was when Taesan was about to enter.

Snap.

The space was torn apart.

A black aura began to flow out and take shape.

Taesan stopped walking and watched as the shape took form.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hello, this is my child."

"It's been a long time."

The appearance of Master Ma has been revealed.
Note: The text appears to be a mix of Korean and English, with the first two lines being a greeting and a phrase in Korean, followed by a sentence in English that doesn't seem to make sense. The last part of the text is also unclear, but it appears to be a name or title followed by a phrase that is unrelated to the rest of the text.
