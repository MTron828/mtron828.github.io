Chapter 475

475. 90th Floor. The Magician (1)

There's really not much left until the labyrinth is cleared.

Leaving the shop owner behind, Taesan arrived at the 90th floor.

It was a very ordinary room. A floor without any special characteristics, one that he had seen countless times on his way down.

But the person waiting there was not ordinary.

He had gray hair.

He had a very ordinary physique and an ordinary face. The kind of person you would forget if you saw him on the street.

The magician who created the labyrinth waved his hand.

"Nice to see you again, Taesan."

"You."

Balbambara had said that he wouldn't be responsible for anything from the 90th floor onwards.

Someone else would appear, and it was likely to be the magician who created the labyrinth.

"From here on, Balbambara won't show up. This is beyond his role."

"Is this goodbye?"

"We might meet occasionally, but it's unlikely?"

The magician, who had turned into a sword, looked at Bardley.

"Should I say congratulations or condolences? Hero."

[I'm somewhat satisfied with myself, at least I'm not in a situation where I'd receive someone's pity.]

"Then I should say congratulations. Congratulations. You may not have achieved your dreams, but you're satisfied with reality, aren't you?"

The wizard hummed.

"You were an adventurer who had caught my attention. Although it's unfortunate that you ended up like this... if you're satisfied with your own ending, then that's that. And there's one more thing I'm curious about."

His gaze turned to the ring on Taesan's finger.

"What's that?"

[Do you... know about me?]

Akasha asked quietly. The wizard shook his head.

"No."

"Don't you know either?"

Taesan was surprised. The forgotten goddess's apostle existed within the labyrinth. And the master of the labyrinth was the wizard.

To that extent, Taesan thought that at least the wizard would understand something about Akasha, but there was no sign of that.

"I sense something, but I don't know what it is. So I'll have to hear the story."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The wizard said with a serious face.

Taesan explained. He told how he encountered a swordsman and received a blessing by praying to the forgotten goddess's statue.

The wizard stroked his chin after listening to Taesan's explanation.

"That's... strange."

"You, the owner of the labyrinth, don't know everything about the labyrinth either?"

"No."

The wizard denied it.

"I have a perfect understanding of this place. I have to, precisely."

The wizard's eyes, gazing at Akasha, narrowed.

"But I couldn't recognize the goddess you mentioned. This is amazing. Is it possible to forcefully erase it from recognition? Can you intervene like this?"

The wizard laughed. It was a laugh with a hint of annoyance.

"There are all sorts of things. It's really troublesome."

"It's probably a problem with the gods, too."

"Maybe so."

Mashin had suspected that Akasha was related to the gods. The wizard also agreed.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We had completely erased the goddess from our consciousness. If it weren't for you, an irregular, intervening, we might not have been able to realize it. And the only being capable of doing so is the High God."

Taesan, who had briefly recalled his memories, asked him.

"Do you know about the High God, the usurper?"

"The usurper?"

"They mentioned it, and Akasha reacted to it."

"The usurper..."

The wizard's lips tightened as he pondered.

After a considerable amount of time had passed, he opened his mouth.

"I remember. The High God appeared occasionally during the past war. But it didn't seem to have moved actively... or did it?"

He muttered to himself.

"Is it erasing the existence itself, or is it devouring the concept itself? It's worth investigating."

The wizard laughed cheerfully.

"Good. I've obtained unexpected information. And one more thing."

The wizard slowly approached Taesan and stretched out his hand.

His hand was slowing down as it got closer to Taesan.

"Amazing."

A strange light flickered in the wizard's eyes.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When I obtained self-transcendence, I also gained the power to perfectly control time. Then, I can easily steal the powers of other high gods without any issues."

Taesan gazed quietly at the wizard. The wizard, sensing his gaze, tilted his head.

"Why are you looking at me like that?"

"No, it's just that you guys wouldn't like it if I did."

He could destroy order and laws.

He had done it before, but now the possibility was growing stronger. He was obtaining the powers of the high gods who were banished from the world, one by one.

From the perspective of the transcenders, it wasn't a pleasant thing.

"I know what you're worried about, but listen, Taesan," the wizard said calmly.

"We don't think we'll make the same mistakes as them."

"It seems like there are many who aren't like that, though."

The god of death had intervened in the labyrinth to deal with him. The wizard's face became ambiguous.

"â€¦Of course, there are those who aren't like that. As I said before, there won't be any problems inside the labyrinth."

Satisfied, he clapped his hands.

"Let's stop the small talk and get to the main point, Taesan. Why did I appear?"

"To test me."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The quest itself was a test for the wizard. There was no other way. The wizard nodded.

"That's right. The reason I appeared is to test you. You need to prove yourself to me."

"What do you mean?"

"About yourself."

The wizard slowly created distance from Taesan.

After maintaining a certain distance, he quietly gazed at him. His movement was like someone preparing for a duel.

Taesan scowled. The wizard opened his mouth.

"The 90th floor quest is simple. Try to break through me with your power. If you succeed, you'll clear it."

"What kind of crazy talk is this?"

Taesan let out a dry laugh.

The wizard was a transcender.

Although it was uncertain, it was estimated that he was at the level of Mariana Lakiratas, one of the top transcenders.

Even if Taesan was a transcender, he was at the very bottom. There was an unbridgeable gap.

Having the irregular 'Boundary Line' was not enough to solve everything.

"Try it in various ways. I'll keep recovering you, excluding the holy and black attributes."

"Those two are the most important, though."
Here is the translation of the text:

"I'm sorry, but that's something I can't intervene with. Instead, I'll try to mediate it properly."

Taesan shook his head. The mage didn't seem to be thinking about changing the trial. Then, complaining about it would be meaningless.

"What are the exact conditions?"

The mage smiled and pointed to himself.

"This body isn't my true form."

Taesan felt it too. Unlike their previous meeting, the mage's physical body felt strange. The power and aura were the same, but it was as if something was missing.

"It's a puppet connected directly to me. Try to hurt this puppet. Then, the 90th quest will be cleared."

Taesan drew his sword.

The mage was watching Taesan's appearance calmly.

It seemed like he was only going to defend and not attack. If he were to attack, Taesan would have no chance of winning, so it was only natural.

Then, he would abandon defense and focus only on breaking through.

[You have activated the spell.] [You have activated the Disabling Spell.]

The condensed dark sphere, which was layered with spells, is realized in the world.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san didn't stop there. He unleashed all the power he could muster.

The dark magic, the power of destruction, and the magic that he could control filled the labyrinth.

[You have activated the stealth.]

Tae-san hid his body.

Countless powers of Tae-san flew towards the magician.

"Wow, that's impressive."

The magician quietly exclaimed in amazement.

The power that had been implemented was enough to destroy the world.

Tae-san is undoubtedly strong.

Even without a boundary, the power he possessed was impossible to ignore.

Therefore, the magician lightly slapped his hand.

Ki-ing.

A light wave spread throughout the room. It was as insignificant as a small pebble tossed into the sea, like a meaningless wave.

However, the power of Tae-san that collided with the wave was torn apart.

The great collapse crumbled and disappeared, and the dark space of Bahal floated away like a carefree child. The numerous powers of Tae-san, which were as insignificant as a light wave, disappeared.

And Tae-san didn't even flinch.
Here is the translation of the text:

One who is a wizard knows well that he can ignore the power of the mage like crumbling a sandcastle. He targeted a tiny, virtually imperceptible gap.

Amidst the crumbling power, the Great Mountain appeared.

Its prelude was shrouded in a gray haze, as if it was wrapped in a boundary.

And it expanded steadily.

[You have activated the Chaos Domain.]

The laws and order collapse, and only the Great Mountain's world is created.

The duration is at most 3 seconds.

But that's enough.

The shockwave presses down and becomes distorted.

The Great Mountain charged forward unimpeded.

[You have activated the Denial of Possibility.]

The sword was filled with the boundary and thrust towards the wizard.

"Ahh..."

The wizard couldn't help but gasp.

That power was irregular.

If it were to grow unchecked and reach their necks, even they would find it difficult to respond to that power.

But that was not the case now.

"Come to me."

The wizard whispered quietly, as if great things were hidden in a puppet show.

The wizard extended his hand.

His hand grasped the Great Mountain's sword.

Kah-kah-kah!

The Great Mountain's pupils expanded.

The gray haze that had never been blocked, which could crush everything, was unable to pierce the wizard's body.
Here is the translation of the text:

It felt like there was a strange, mystical power emanating from the hand of the magician, as if it had been infused with the essence of the mountain.

"That thing."

That thing was a kind of law.

Even in the realm of chaos, this law that couldn't be erased lingered, surrounding the magician's aura.

The mountain's power surged even stronger. The boundary seemed to be on the verge of exploding.

But it couldn't be broken.

The law that had collided with the boundary was crumbling, falling apart.

But a new law was immediately filling the void.

"'The boundary can break the law, but it takes time. So, it's simple. If I fill the void again, the boundary won't reach me.'"

The magician spoke lightly, his hand trembling with power.

Suddenly, the mountain felt a powerful backlash.

His body was thrown out. He couldn't resist or counterattack. In an instant, he flew towards the wall of the labyrinth.

Kuuuuuuuung!

The mountain gritted his teeth. His self-control was shattered. He overcame the shock and stood up.

The magician shrugged his hand.

"That power is undoubtedly strong, but you haven't mastered it yet. So, it's not impossible to respond."

The magician said with a smile.
Here is the translation of the text:

"We won against the Overlord."

The Overlord is a person who interferes with the laws of the world and destroys and pollutes it.

It is stronger than the current Heavenly Mountain.

And the gods have won against them. It is natural to have a countermeasure against the collapse of laws and order.

"But it's impossible to reach that with ordinary means. Still... it's impressive."

The magician's face was filled with amazement.

"Wow, you've devoured my domain in such a short time. Even the Overlord couldn't do that. It's definitely abnormal."

"It doesn't seem like you're treating me fairly."

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But you have to surpass the benchmark."

The magician laughed.

"What's waiting below, you also know, don't you?"

"...".

The Heavenly Mountain didn't answer, but it could understand what the magician was saying.

He is currently at the bottom, but he has reached the realm of transcendence.

And he has defeated the Overlord's seventh fragment. Without much difficulty, he has won against the two immortals' joint attack and has even trampled on the transformed body.

So, what kind of existence will he be facing from now on?
The translation of the text is:

It was not difficult to give an answer.

It was the same as the high-level and transcendent being itself.

Existences that control the world.

They were the ones who blocked the way in front of Taishan's 90th floor.
