Chapter 414

414. 82nd floor, Lemegeton (3)

Everyone's eyes lit up.

Except for Taesan, the rest of the contractees are not adventurers in the labyrinth. Although the quest window did not appear for them, it was not difficult to infer from Baal's words.

Belial's throne.

The one who seized it rises to a glorious position.

Ambition and desire. Various emotions surged. Baal looked at them with indifference.

[But he didn't open the door. The rest is up to you.]

Kiying!

As soon as Baal raised his hand, a massive darkness enveloped them.

"Ugh!"

"Ahh!"

The dark energy was so dense and heavy that they could hardly breathe. They closed their eyes along with their screams.

Kuku, kuku, kukuâ€¦.

The power slowly subsided, and they realized they were still alive. They opened their eyes.

"...Ah."

"This is it."

They let out a sigh.

The world around them was collapsing and dying.

They had finally arrived at the dead world of Belial.

* * *

They have arrived at their destination.
Here is the translation of the text:

As soon as they realized this fact, they quickly assessed their surroundings.

The same kind of things were densely packed, covering the sky. The collapsing land was floating in mid-air, moving back and forth.

And then, the power they felt inside.

Someone had unknowingly swallowed a pill.

Their location seemed to be a safe zone, but despite this, they felt an incredibly strong power.

As they assessed their surroundings, they realized that there was another existence beside them.

"Who are you?"

"I am an observer. I am the servant of the late Bellial."

An old man in black robes bowed his head slightly. At first glance, he seemed like a ordinary servant, but his eyes were black as coal.

'Farewell.'

Taesan let out a small gasp. Although the old man was not immortal, he had reached the boundary of immortality.

Compared to Taesan, he was significantly weaker, but still, he was incredibly strong in terms of general strength.

Most existences directly related to them seemed to possess incredibly strong powers.

The servant let out a deep sigh, as if he were truly pitiful.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The fact that a creature like you has entered the master's domain is too pitiful, but it can't be helped, I suppose."

"I heard that the demon here has died."

One of the five contractees, a woman, smiled mischievously. She was dressed in a high-collared outfit with two small horns, resembling a succubus.

"So, even if we become demons, wouldn't it be no problem at all? And you, wouldn't you gain a new master, which would be beneficial?"

"It's better to die than for unqualified creatures to occupy the master's domain."

"If that's the case, it's fine. We've obtained our qualifications."

The woman spoke confidently. The demon she had contracted with had allowed her to enter Belial's domain.

The butler spoke calmly.

"Think as you please. Ultimately, this is the will of the great ones. As a butler, I will only observe those who have obtained the qualifications to become a master."

His eyes showed no emotion. Those who had come to this place had never thought of ascending to the demon's seat.

"Ha!"

Another demon, who seemed dissatisfied, let out a snort. He was a muscular man with a long spear and a scowl on his face.
Here is the translation of the text:

"If I were to become a devil, I would kill that guy first."

He smiled with a sinister grin.

He was a highly acclaimed being in the vast underworld, even among the few strong ones like the messengers of the gods.

Born into a noble family, he was given the name Halid and had exceptional talent, receiving the full support of his family.

However, the underworld was too small for Halid. The few powerful beings, like the messengers of the gods, were all leaving the underworld to wander the world.

Halid judged that he could no longer grow stronger in the underworld and left to wander the world, enhancing his strength.

He knew about the labyrinth, but when he heard about it through rumors, he didn't think it was a particularly attractive place.

Halid searched for a more practical method.

He didn't hesitate to use any means or methods to strengthen himself, and in the process, numerous worlds without planetary gods were destroyed.

Many who had lost their homeland cursed Halid, but he just laughed.

The world is just a stepping stone for me to become great. If it can be a stepping stone for my process, I won't care how many people die.
Here is the translation of the text:

After strengthening to that extent, Halid received a contract from the devil.

The devil, Marcosias, acknowledged Halid as one of his underlings and bestowed upon him a Remegoton.

Halid was extremely excited.

The devil, a great being, was someone who could be on par with the master of dark magic and Halid.

He had no intention of letting this opportunity slip away.

Halid bit his lip.

"Let's form a temporary alliance."

He turned his body around to face the other contract holders and said.

Foul and unworthy beings, seeking power beyond their abilities. That was what the man who owned the remaining Remegoton wanted.

However, the power itself was sufficient. Although he didn't want to admit it, he had a similar power to his own.

They could be excellent tools for him to become a devil.

He concealed his true intentions and continued speaking.

"I'd like everyone to cooperate."

"...Cooperate?"

A gloomy man muttered. Halid said as if it was natural.

"You don't think you can pass through this place alone, do you?"

"...".

The gloomy man remained silent.
Here is the translation of the text:

They could feel it too. Although they had lost their master and were in a state of decline, what was contained within was the power of the devil.

If they took a step carelessly, they would lose their lives immediately due to the devil's lingering influence.

The position of the throne was also unclear due to the powerful force.

"It is only one who can become a devil, but on the other hand, everyone's goal is the same. Therefore, until we reach our goal, we must all cooperate."

"Ah."

"I don't like it, but... there's no other way."

They began to gather one by one. Except for him, it was just one person.

"You know the leader. You're useless. You're unnecessary."

Hillard revealed his intentions towards Taisean.

Taisean said that he had no devil backing him up.

In other words, he had not been chosen.

It was obvious that no devil would choose a being without power. Taisean had hidden his power because he was trying to conceal his weakness. Hillard thought so.

As Hillard was about to confront Taisean, he was taken aback.

Taisean was not even paying attention to him.

It was as if his very existence was not felt.

Note: The text appears to be a part of a fantasy story, likely a dark fantasy or a story with a strong focus on demonology.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san was just gazing at the domain of Bellial. "What is this?"

He muttered to himself for a moment and took a few steps forward. Without hesitation, they entered the domain of Bellial.

"What?"

Before long, Tae-san's appearance was obscured and disappeared into the cracked earth.

Halid was taken aback for a moment and quickly retreated.

"You're so considerate of yourself, it's really great."

It seemed that he was judging that he would rather leave on his own than be rejected, but he couldn't survive here alone. Halid also stopped paying attention to Tae-san.

"Then let's talk about this. What will you do?"

You are all my stepping stones.

Halid smiled sweetly, concealing his true intentions.

"* * *"

Tae-san wandered through the domain of Bellial.

He already knew where Bellial's throne was located. It was unusual for someone to not notice the strong energy emanating from it.

However, Tae-san did not immediately rush towards the throne.

Instead, he took a few steps forward. He was thinking of getting a better sense of his surroundings.

"I'll give you praise. Trash."
Here is the translation of the text:

A soft voice rang out. It was the attendant of Bellial.

Tae-san didn't show any concern and said:

"Besides me, don't bother with that over there."

"I am Bellial's attendant. I can easily make a duplicate of myself."

The attendant spoke lightly.

"You too are a being that seeks to covet your lord's power, but it's not correct to not cooperate. However, I don't like it."

The attendant's face contorted in disgust.

"To dare to covet your lord's position and try to reach it through cooperation with others. It's a futile hope, but I truly detest it."

The attendant's words were filled with the certainty that they could never reach Bellial's throne.

"In that sense, you are still trying to do something on your own. I'll praise you for that much. So, be satisfied and stay here."

Just as the conversation was ending, a massive energy burst forth from the sea creatures floating in the sky. It was the residual energy of the dead demon, which had moved to exclude the intruder.

The sound of a storm!
Here is the translation of the text:

Thorns drew a straight line and poured onto Taesan like a torrent. It was an attack that perfectly occupied the space, leaving no room for evasion.

Inside was the power of evil.

The existence of mortals could not resist. Si-jeon was certain of Taesan's death and was about to leave.

"Halt."

[You have activated the declaration of cessation.]

Suddenly.

The thorns stopped at Taesan's doorstep.

"...What?"

Si-jeon's eyes widened at the sight unfolding before him.

The thorns had frozen in place, as if petrified, at Taesan's single declaration.

"Ah, what's this?"

"It's strong, but it's nothing but a force without an owner."

Then, everything could have been resolved with a single command. Taesan touched the thorns.

"It's similar to the world of Halfdan."

The ruler of the world had disappeared, and the world was dying. The situation was the same.

The only difference was that the world of Halfdan lost its power rapidly after the will of the world collapsed, but this place had a lingering evil residue.

"What can we gain from this?"

Taesan clenched his fist.

The halted thorns shattered like a bamboo stalk and created a path.

Si-jeon couldn't say a word.

* * *
Here is the translation of the text:

Other owners of legendary Remegiton were also joining forces to advance Bellial's territory.

The earthworm trembled and shot towards them.

"Wow!"

Hilid let out a sigh and swung his hand. Marco's fake flames tried to block the thorns, but were quickly shattered and pierced.

An elderly man with a stern face, who had made a contract with Decarabia, slapped the ground with his hand. The earth rose up and a distorted root was summoned.

"Kwa-kwa-kwa!"

Five black mages controlled the power of evil. They exerted all their strength and consumed all their energy, barely managing to block the thorns' attack.

"Ah, ah!"

They sweated profusely and managed to catch their breath.

"Really, it's a monster... "

Even the remnants of the dead demon posed a threat to their lives. If they hadn't cooperated, they wouldn't have survived.

But this fact only made their eyes shine brighter.

As long as they survived and reached the throne, they would be able to obtain this power.

Ambition and desire swirled around. Suddenly, the existence of the Taishan in their minds was gone. Although the five of them had combined their strength, they were repeatedly blocked, and he thought he was already dead.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Originally, he would have laughed at them, but he was stunned and unable to say a word.

They made up their minds and moved forward.

They put their lives on the line, used others, and advanced with all their might.

And then, Taesan was strolling leisurely through Bellial's territory.

"What kind of skill can I get here?"

He was currently thinking about acquiring a new skill.
