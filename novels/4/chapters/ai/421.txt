Chapter 422

422. 83rd Floor, The Essence of the God of Descent (4)

The God of Descent revealed his will through the pillar.

His will was acceptance.

Before long, a massive Colosseum formed around the pillar.

Diana stood proudly at the center of the Colosseum.

The seats of the Colosseum began to fill up one by one.

"There are many."

It wasn't just dozens or hundreds. The number was staggering, as if all living beings in this place had gathered.

"The God of Descent has been filling this model garden with mortals since ancient times. With only about a thousand people, it's rather scarce, don't you think?"

"Is this something that everyone should gather for?"

Raynal nodded.

"There are also those whose hearts are broken here. Even if their consciousness is fulfilled, their despair remains unchanged. But they too will gather here without exception when the Colosseum opens."

"What exactly is the Colosseum?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The fundamental way to use points is to temporarily raise one's consciousness. And another way to use them is to open the Colosseum for liberation."

Raynal said with a low voice.

"That condition is to consume 100 points."

100 points. You get 1 point for defeating one person. It meant that you had to defeat 100 people.

Everyone gathered here was stronger than the guides of sin. It was obvious that collecting 100 points would be extremely difficult.

"What do you get by opening the Colosseum with such a harsh condition?"

"It's simple. This is the Colosseum of Liberation."

Raynal's eyes were filled with longing.

"Those who challenge the Colosseum will fight against the apostle of the fallen god. And if you win that battle, all the souls trapped here will be liberated."

"Liberation of souls?"

"It means you can escape this damn place and return to the outside world again."

Raynal's voice was filled with passion. His clenched fist was filled with power.

"Is that so."

Why did their eyes have hope? Why didn't they give up on reality?
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Because there was still a chance to turn the tables. 100 points were certainly difficult, but with the power of the princess and the old man, it was not impossible to gather.

"Is this a winning battle?"

"The princess has opened the Colosseum multiple times. They were all narrow defeats. I perfectly understood the power shown by the opponent in the previous battle. This time, it's... fully possible."

Reynald's voice was filled with deep hope.

Taesan turned his gaze to look at the others. They were not much different. In fact, they showed even stronger desires and hopes than Reynald.

However, some of them were expressionless.

Their faces were like they were watching a predetermined play, without any expectations.

Taesan turned his gaze to Diana, who was standing in the center of the Colosseum, holding three swords.

With an unwavering face, she was waiting for her opponent.

Kugugung!

The pillar began to operate. People were excited. As the rotating pillar opened up a space, a hand soon jumped out.

"Hey, you're calling me already? Who are you?"

The owner of the hand revealed themselves.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He had elastic, golden-brown skin. His muscular upper body was fully exposed, and his hair was golden, giving off a somewhat flashy impression.

"Kang Ha-gun."

Taesan grasped the power of the warrior.

It was quite strong.

Even Diana couldn't easily guarantee victory at this level.

But it wasn't an unbeatable level.

Diana was confident she could win.

"Again, you?"

The warrior looked at Diana with a tired face and spoke. Diana held up her three swords.

"I've grasped all the movements and power you've shown me."

"Really?"

The warrior smiled wryly and raised his fist.

The noisy audience suddenly fell silent.

Diana took a perfect stance, holding her three swords, and charged forward. The warrior revealed his fist and grasped it.

Ka-boom!

The three swords and fist collided. The warrior swung his fist wildly. Diana moved her swords.

[Whoa.]

The ghost spoke in a voice.

Diana's movements were extremely swift.

Without losing her dignity, she blocked all of the warrior's attacks.

Kyeeeng!

Diana raised her arm upwards. The trajectory of the fist deviated. Diana took advantage of the opening and struck, and the warrior twisted his body to dodge.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Oooooh!"

The audience erupted in cheers.

Diana was overpowering Sado.

The expectation of being able to turn the tables and take the upper hand grew exponentially.

Diana didn't waver and continued to press Sado. She thrust her sword, and although Sado defended himself, she didn't stop, and her speed only accelerated.

The accelerated sword left behind an afterimage, splitting into dozens of paths.

"Is this an upgraded version of the continuous attack?"

Because she had transcended the labyrinth, the skill activation window didn't appear.

However, the effects were somewhat predictable.

Each of the afterimages had a physical presence.

"I've seen this before!"

Sado laughed, gathering all his strength into his fist.

A dense and profound energy formed a massive fist.

Sado threw his fist, unleashing a concentrated, massive power. In contrast, the afterimages of the sword were ultimately separate forces. The image of his fist shattering into pieces was visible.

But Diana pulled her sword back and struck again.

The dozens of paths the sword had split into converged into one.

Kiiiiing!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Hmph!"

The sword pierced through the giant fist and collided with the saint's fist.

The saint hastily retreated, but a deep wound appeared on his fist.

"I told you. I've fully grasped your power!"

Diana's eyes shone brightly as she charged again.

[Strong.]

The ghost watching from the side let out a sigh.

[Although I don't want to admit it, her swordsmanship level is clearly superior to mine. At that level, she can really win.]

Kugugung!

The saint swung his fist wildly.

He didn't back down easily. He pressured Diana's movements, occasionally landing unpredictable attacks that Diana couldn't anticipate.

However, Diana calmly responded to the attacks and counterattacked.

The difference in power wasn't that great. The outcome of the battle would be determined by who could read their opponent better.

And Diana had almost perfectly read the saint.

Everyone present was a strong individual, and they knew it. Their expectations and hopes grew even higher.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If it goes like this, you'll be able to clear the quest before you even do anything. Even if you fail, with that kind of power, you'll be able to win without any problems, right? Is this the clear condition for the quest?"

The ghost said. The apostle was on the same level as Diana, and Taesan was even more superior to Diana.

If Taesan gathered points and opened the Colosseum, he would definitely win.

But Taesan's eyes sank.

The Colosseum that opens with 100 points. If you defeat the god's apostle, you'll be freed. The reason the God of Fall gave us this possibility was unimaginable.

The God of Fall didn't want the beings in this place to be trapped in a model garden, despairing and giving up all hope.

He was a god who wanted to see mortals rise to a high place and then fall to the bottom.

This Colosseum was a device to make them fall.

Ka-a-a-ng!

The apostle was pushed back. Diana took a deep breath and composed herself. Sweat was dripping from her entire body, but her expression was bright.

The advantage was sufficient.

They still had to continue fighting for a long time, but as long as they didn't make any mistakes, they could definitely win.

The apostle also admired her.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's about time. You're the first one to push me this far. You had a value that Essence-nim would choose."

"Really? You're going to make me regret using you."

"No."

The apostle smiled faintly.

"That won't happen."

The apostle charged forward.

And Taesan could see it.

It was a flow of power that only he, who had reached the immortal throne, could see, and no one else.

Something new was born inside the apostle.

A fist was swung.

Ku-u-ung!

"Kuek!"

Diana, who blocked the fist, stumbled back, unable to withstand the power. A crimson aura was swirling around the apostle's entire body.

"There's still hidden power!"

Reynald exclaimed in surprise. From their reactions, it seemed that the crimson power surrounding the apostle was an unseen power in the Colosseum so far. Diana, who barely maintained her posture, forced a smile.

"......I've never seen such power before."

"There was no need to use it. The time limit was short, and the penalty was great. But it's enough to knock you out, who's already tired!"

The apostle bared his teeth.

But Taesan knew.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That power wasn't something the Sado originally had.

It was a new power that emerged during the battle.

'It was set up to be impossible to win from the start.'

The Sado's power was equal to Diana's. If they could grasp their power and avoid mistakes, they could win.

It seemed that way.

But in reality, as the battle continued, a new power was bestowed upon the Sado, somehow.

It must have been designed by the God of Decline. Even if they were strong, they were still mortals. They couldn't catch up to the transcendent's scheme.

The new power they obtained changed the entire flow of the battle.

Even if they managed to overcome it, another new power would emerge.

The Colosseum was nothing but a false hope.

"Too bad. You had a futile hope, and you'll try again next time."

The Sado mocked Diana. His face was filled with joy. Diana's pupils grew larger.

Diana desperately resisted, but she had already exhausted most of her power. The Sado's attacks began to land on Diana little by little."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The audience, who had been excited, was now cold and disappointed. Sado smiled wryly and clenched his fist. Diana's abdomen was pierced.

* * *

Diana had lost.

People were in despair. They had thought they could win, but now they were all depressed.

However, that feeling didn't last long.

"It's a shame."

"But I've discovered a new power. I'll be able to defeat him in the next Colosseum."

Their thoughts weren't wrong. Sado had defeated Diana, and soon the dark red aura disappeared. If Diana had just held on a little longer, she could have regained the upper hand.

It was as if the God of Decline had intervened.

They regained hope and dispersed.

"It's unfortunate, but... I've discovered something new, so it's fortunate. I'll challenge him soon too. I need to think of a strategy in advance."

Raynard was not much different from them.

Taesan asked him, "Where is Diana?"

"She's currently dead, so she'll revive in a day. She'll be resting in a room at the highest point in the village. She's had a hard time, so she should take a good rest today."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is that so."

"Yes. Now, what do you plan to do? If you want, I'll go with the princess and..."

As he said this, Reynald gazed at Taesan, who was taken aback.

Taesan had somehow disappeared.

And Reynald didn't even notice him leaving.

"...How?"

A voice filled with dismay echoed.

* * *

The next day, Taesan arrived at the village and went to find Diana.

He knocked on the door of her lavish room, and a small voice replied.

"Come in."

The door creaked open, and Taesan entered to find Diana sitting on the bed. She looked at him and smiled brightly.

"Oh, Mr. Taesan. Welcome."

Taesan entered the room without a word.

Diana looked apologetic.

"I'm sorry. I said I could return, but I ended up losing miserably."

"It doesn't matter. From the start, it was set up so that I couldn't win anyway."

"...What?"

Diana was taken aback.

Taesan gazed at her with a blank expression.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If it were someone else, they might not have noticed, but you didn't realize, did you? The Colosseum is nothing but a false hope."

When the apostle wielded the crimson power.

Diana's expression was different from others.

It seemed as if she knew the opponent was about to unleash a new power, and instead of despair, she showed a sense of resignation that was closer to acceptance.

"Well, it's something you can figure out if you think about it a bit. The god of downfall won't really set us free, will they? Most people either forget or deliberately ignore it, but you're not like that, are you?"

There were a few beings in the audience who showed no emotions.

They didn't show any emotional changes even when Diana lost.

Their common trait was that they were all strong individuals who had reached their limits.

They must have opened the Colosseum multiple times to escape, and realized it. This is an unbeatable Colosseum.

"But you're different from them; you didn't give up."

Diana understood that she couldn't win.

However, she didn't let go of the hope that she could escape.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Her emotions were clearly visible, and she seemed desperate to escape the labyrinth. She wanted to get out of there no matter what.

"Is there something outside that's making you do this?"

"...What's the reason behind your words?"

A quiet voice echoed. Diana's killing intent was directed at Taesan.

Taesan spoke nonchalantly, brushing it off.

"It's simple. Perhaps you're one of the reasons I came to this place."

"Reason?"

"Veltenkia. Do you know it?"

Diana's pupils, which had been cold and menacing, grew larger.

"How did you know that name..."

"Exactly."

Diana's actions, tone, and appearance. Everything matched the characteristics Veltenkia had mentioned. At first, I was half-doubtful, but after seeing her fighting style, I was convinced.

"Veltenkia is looking for you. She made a contract with a wizard to set up a base in the labyrinth for that purpose. I came here to rescue you. Wizard's princess."
