**Chapter 536**

**536. The Pantheon of Gods (2)**

Ki-ii-ii-ing!

The golden light fills my vision. Just that alone is enough to evaporate the sea and melt the earth with its intense heat.

But Taesan didn't feel any excitement. The heat was blocked by his self-protection and didn't reach him. His vision wasn't affected at all.

"If we're going to fight, I don't think I'll be able to hold back, but it won't be good."

[You.]

A stiff, hardened voice rings out.

[Die.]

Ki-ii-ii-ing!

Hundreds, thousands of golden swords rush in at once.

The true intentions of the transcendent being who governs concepts.

But Taesan wasn't afraid at all.

In contrast to the dazzling golden light, a dark, ashen color emerged from Taesan.

A thick, dark ashen color that devours both light and darkness.

Ku-u-u-ung!

The golden swords and the ashen color clash. Taesan swung his arm, and the ashen color that shakes everything charged forward.

Zzzip-zzzip-zzzip!

And what breaks apart are the golden swords.

The ashen color, like a beast, rises up and dyes the golden light, devouring it.

[What!]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Mantra's eyes widened in shock as he hastily gathered his strength. A magnificent, radiant sword, as if adorned with all the treasures of the world, materialized in the world.

Kuuuuung!

The sword charged towards Taesan. Taesan roughly grasped the sword with both hands. The ash-colored vortex swirled and engulfed the sword.

He then clenched his fist.

The ash color compressed. Mantra's sword tried to bounce back, releasing a golden light, but the compression didn't stop and only grew stronger.

Zzzeojeojeok!

A shattering sound echoed. Taesan punched down with his fist.

Ka-ka-ka-ang!

The sword shattered and disappeared, compressed into the ash color without a trace.

Mantra's pupils trembled.

[Me, my power...].

"Hmm."

Taesan looked at his hand. The sensation of crossing the boundary still lingered in his body.

"Is it insufficient?"

Taesan muttered. Mantra didn't understand what Taesan meant.

[You, what have you done!]

Mantra burst into anger.

He couldn't understand or accept the ash color. It was as if it was something beyond his comprehension, something that transcended his understanding.

"I wish I could explain it too."

Unfortunately, Taesan was also unable to do so.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not enough with you."

Taesan muttered. At those words, Mantara felt an unbearable sense of humiliation.

[You!]

Anger turned to hatred. Hundreds of gleaming swords rushed towards Taesan.

Taesan didn't draw his boundary.

Instead, he took a step back.

Whoa!

The physical force was shattered. The hundreds of swords that were flying towards him, accelerated by the physical force, lost their power and fell.

[What!]

"Hmm."

Taesan nodded in satisfaction, waving his finger. He could control and dominate all the physical forces directed at him, making them nonexistent.

Taesan had nullified the power of the incoming swords.

Taesan pulled back his finger as if slapping, and then released it. The physical force exploded like a bomb, covering Mantara.

[Ugh!]

Mantara was pushed back. He barely managed to raise his power to block it, but he still suffered considerable damage from the series of actions.

"Even a simple slap can do this much."

Taesan was satisfied again.

[Oh, how...]

Mantara's face was filled with astonishment.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He could feel it. In Taesan's attack just now, a concept itself was mixed in.

In other words, until Taesan directly wielded the power of physical strength, he didn't realize that he possessed the power of physical strength.

[You, you! You! You!]

Mantra's voice grew louder. The one who had reached a high level of enlightenment was dyed with emotion.

Kiieeeeng!

The most magnificent sword in the world revealed its appearance.

That was Mantra's full power.

A power used with sincerity to kill him.

Grrr.

The beast inside him howled. It was as if it had been waiting, and now was the timing to come out.

Taesan's eyes were about to become serious.

[This is crazy.]

In an instant, darkness arose.

A thick, dark blackness surged in like a tidal wave, engulfing and shattering Mantra's sword in an instant.

Kaahhh!

[What?] [What are you doing?]

A quiet voice rang out.

Mashin gazed at Mantra with a calm, sunken expression.

[Ah.]

Mantra's face turned pale. Overwhelmed with emotion, he forgot where he was.

This was the Pantheon of Gods.

A place where all gods gathered.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What are you doing to our guest?" "That's not it." "Excuses are over."

The listener looks displeased, raising their finger.

And then, the mantra flew far away, unable to resist. The mantra disappeared in an instant.

"Overwhelming, isn't it?"

The mantra was a transcendent being. However, with a light gesture from the listener, its power was broken, and it flew away. The listener spoke in a tone as if it was no big deal.

"That's a transcendent being who controls a small concept. It's beyond our reach."

The listener smiled brightly.

It was a face that was very different from when they dealt with the mantra, a very bright face.

"Long time no see, Taesan."

"It hasn't been that long, but I suppose it's okay to say that."

"That may be true, but it's the thought that counts in greetings like this."

"Then... it's been a long time."

The listener nodded their head in satisfaction. After glancing at Taesan, they let out a laugh.

"Just like the story. I heard it from Essential, but it's amazing."

"Is Essential-nim also here?"

"Yes, I've learned a lot from them."

The listener's face, looking at Taesan, showed only two emotions: surprise and admiration.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You're... really amazing. Honestly, even I couldn't do it if I tried to empty and refill myself like you do.]"

"Even a powerful person like me couldn't do it. Rather, it's precisely because of that that it's impossible to find a solution. It's not an exaggeration to say that only the gods can do it."

"As a result, the gods reached a completely different realm."

"[I really can't read you at all.]"

"Mashin tried to observe the gods' perspective on Taesan. Taesan didn't block it."

"Yet, it was impossible to understand what Taesan had reached."

"Even at our last meeting, it was impossible to grasp it accurately, but considering that we could confirm the level of it, it was a really strange thing."

"[I wonder if I can understand it this time. I don't know.]"

"'The fact that Mashin-nim has come means it's okay to move now, right?'"

"[That's right. Follow me.]"

"Mashin spoke calmly."

"[The gods are waiting for you.]"

"Taesan's eyes sank."

"Mashin took the lead, and he took a step forward."

"There was a sense of hostility and killing intent towards Taesan. Curiosity was also felt."

"Taesan didn't even bother to pay attention."

"How far did we go? A massive temple appeared beyond the black world."

"A powerful energy was felt within it."

Note: Mashin-nim is a polite way to address Mashin, similar to "Mr." or "Sir".
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Mantle, who had been opposing Taesan, was a being of such immense power that it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call them a god.

They were beings who could control the universe itself.

They had gathered there.

[That's the place.]

Taesan followed the guide of the mage and entered. As the mage waved their hand, a massive gate slowly began to open.

And Taesan saw them.

Over a dozen gods staring at him.

[You have met the God of Selection, Maria.] [You have met the God of Struggle and Death, Rakiratas.] [You have met the Mage who created the Labyrinth.] [You have met the God of Magic, Zelvand.] [You have met the God of Essence, Essential.] [You have met the Great Devil, Baal.]

.

.

.

[You have met the God of Death, Dersha.]

* * *

'You're many.'

Even one of them could shake the universe itself.

About twenty of them were waiting for Taesan in this place. A woman with golden hair that reached her waist greeted Taesan with a soft smile.

[Long time no see, child.]

"Long time no see."

It was the God of Selection, Maria. She opened her mouth with a joyful face."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No. I made a mistake. I've become too big to be called a child now.]

The god of selection gazed at Taesan with a piercing stare. She, who was trying to read his essence, let out a sigh of admiration.

[You really can't read him. Where did you reach?]

"It's become like that."

Taesan turned his gaze away.

At the end of it was Baal.

"Are you also present?"

[There must be a reward for betraying the other side. Thanks to that, I was able to enter the Temple of All Gods as a special exception. And I can participate in this place too.] [Silence.]

Someone muttered with an annoyed expression. A immature voice echoed.

It was a woman with black hair that reached her chin. Her sharp face was filled with annoyance and killing intent.

[This is not a place to build friendships. Be quiet. Baal.]

The person who showed the most hostility towards Taesan among everyone here.

Taesan could sense who it was through the energy he felt from her.

Baal responded with a laugh.

[Derasha. Aren't you being too sensitive? This is the first time you're facing your true self, and as a transcendent being who has existed since the creation of the world, shouldn't you be showing more composure?]

The god of death, Derasha.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He was a transcendent being who had directly tried to kill Taesan. Derusha clicked his tongue with an unpleasant face.

[I...][Calm down, Derusha.]

The God of Magic, Zelvand, spoke with a cheerful smile.

[We came here to have a conversation.] […….]

Derusha sat down in his chair with an unpleasant face.

Taesan looked at the gods.

They were seated in a circle, looking down at Taesan.

There were a total of eighteen of them.

"Is this everyone?"

"There are many transcendent beings who have declared neutrality and don't get involved. Even if they have feelings about you or opinions about you, they have the qualification to express them, so it's not unreasonable to think that they're here."

Taesan lifted his head.

[Then let's start the story.]

Lakiratas's heavy voice echoed.

[The topic is Gang Taesan. It's about you.]

* * *

"I want to hear an accurate story."

"I've told them about you."

The God of Essence, Essential, opened his mouth. His face showed regret."

Note: Some of the names and terms may not be directly translatable, so I've kept them in their original form (e.g. "Taesan", "Derusha", "Zelvand", "Lakiratas", "Essential").
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I've been thinking about the story of your origin, but I couldn't keep my mouth shut, so I'll say it. Sorry about that."

"It doesn't matter."

It was a story that couldn't be kept secret from the start, so there was no particular excitement.

[What's already happened isn't that important. What's important is what's going to happen next. It means that several transcendents are thinking about what to do with you.]

Rakirates' languid voice resonates. His eyes never left Taesan's face.

[Are you really a being that helps us? Or... are you a being that helps them? There are cowards who worry about that.]

[Shut up, Rakirates.]

Dersha speaks nervously. She spits out her words with a gaze full of malice.

[I don't intend to play such meaningless tricks.]

She raises her hand. Her slender fingers point at Taesan.

[That thing must die.]

The god of death has pronounced a death sentence.

It was a power in and of itself. The intangible force enveloped Taesan, pulling him towards death. The concept of death itself was trying to drag Taesan to his demise according to the master's will.

Taesan raises his guard.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"By denying oneself and conforming, I will shatter Derusha's authority. Derusha's face distorts.

[How dare you…….] [You didn't come to kill me, did you? Calm down, Derusha.] [There's no need for conversation. That thing is an existence that shatters the balance of the universe.]

Derusha rejects Zelvand's words and rises up fiercely.

The reason the God of Death tried to kill Taesan in the past was because Taesan's existence shattered the balance and concept.

It's the same attitude as back then. Derusha says with a distorted face.

[The current balance is broken because of that thing, isn't it?] [That's not it, Derusha.]

Maria speaks with a laugh.

[The descent of the divine punishment isn't a big problem. The problem is that there was a traitor. Strictly speaking, it's your problem.] [More than anything, I learned something because of that.] [The usurper.]

The demon god murmurs quietly. The true god laughs with a chuckle.

[Did you all forget about that existence?]

"Have you all remembered now?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[I've etched myself into the world, so even if I want to forget, I can't.] [Just recalling the past hardships I've forgotten is a harvest in itself. It's not like he did anything wrong, so there's no problem.] […….] [The important thing is that it's not a problem like that.]

The god of struggle and death, Rakiratas, murmurs quietly.

His gaze towards the towering mountain does not waver.

Inside, a strange longing and desire were swirling.

[It's not important, anyway.]"
