Chapter 501

501. The Forgotten Goddess (3)

[Who are you……?]

Barbabam bowed to Arirnan. He didn't sense anything from her. She was just an ordinary mortal, neither more nor less, but Barbabam's instincts warned him.

The woman in front of him was someone he couldn't treat carelessly.

Arirnan replied.

"I am Arirnan."

[Arirnan…….]

Barbabam quickly scanned the information recorded within him. As an administrator, numerous pieces of information flashed by rapidly.

As a result, Barbabam was shocked.

There was information about Arirnan within him.

It was distorted and difficult to grasp, but it was definitely recorded.

[What is this.]

Barbabam was shaken. He hadn't noticed until now. No, it wasn't that he hadn't noticed, but rather, he hadn't even recognized it. It suddenly came back to life.

[……It seems like this is not a matter for me to judge.]

Barbabam quickly made a judgment. This was beyond his realm.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When my master returns, I'll tell him about it. He'll take care of it after understanding the situation."

"Ah, a wizard. You're the one who created this realm, aren't you? I'm getting interested too."

Arin nodded her head.

"Good. Wait."

[Taesan: This is ridiculous...]

"Ask me instead."

Taesan shrugged his shoulders. Balbambara showed a complex mix of emotions, then seemed to let go and said,

"It's done. It's out of my hands now, so the wizard can take care of it. I'll do what I need to do."

Balbambara, who had given up thinking, started talking to Taesan.

"We cleared the 92nd floor. Let's start processing the rewards. It took a while because the guy who was supposed to take care of it abandoned his responsibility and ran away, so we had to bring back the authority."

The reward for the 92nd floor was equipment from the shop. But the shop owner was needed for that, and he had already returned to his own world.

"I didn't expect a word of gratitude, but I didn't think you'd just dump it on me like this. Unbelievable."

Taesan asked Balbambara, who looked displeased and was clicking his tongue,

"So, what's going to happen now?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[The reward is the equipment from the store. But it's not giving everything away.]

"I knew that."

I didn't think I'd get all the equipment from the start. There must be some limitations. The important thing was where those limitations were.

[The number of equipment you can get is five in total.]

"Five, you say?"

Five.

Taesan, who had been thinking about that number, spoke with a puzzled expression.

"That's too many."

From here on, the equipment from the store is not ordinary. It was the greatest power that allowed Itaeyon to survive until the end, and it's no exaggeration.

Getting five pieces of equipment that require millions of gold is quite excessive.

But Balbambara responded calmly.

[You are a transcender now. You've reached a position of unshakeable faith that no one can deny. Do you think the equipment from the labyrinth will have any effect on you now?]

Taesan had become strong, but too strong.

The equipment from the labyrinth is ultimately for mortals. If Taesan, who is in sync with the system, can use it more efficiently, but ultimately, the equipment's power and strength are far inferior to Taesan's.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The red fortress that Lee Tae-yeon used to wield. Its power could even kill S-grade monsters.

But now, Taesan could easily defeat S-grade monsters with just a normal attack.

The dark-colored wrist guard that Lee Tae-yeon possessed. It reduced incoming damage by 50%.

However, enemies that could pierce through chaos were extremely rare. Only gods and conceptual gods could do so.

And such enemies would use attacks that could pierce through the labyrinth's system. Simply reducing damage was meaningless.

[It's not entirely meaningless. Stats and attack power would increase, and special effects would be useful. But that's about it. In the end, it's just a tool.]

"Is that so."

Now, he wasn't weak enough to be affected by a single piece of equipment. Taesan had become as strong as the craftsmen who made equipment.

Taesan, who had been silent for a moment, asked Balbam.

"What's the secret reward, then?"

[You can also get items from the store. But tell me what you want, and I'll make it for you.]

"Is it a choice?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's okay then. If it's equipment related to cool time, it still has great value. If I can get that equipment, it's settled."

But Taesan didn't say a word. Balbambara waited quietly.

After a moment, Taesan opened his mouth.

"There's something I'm curious about."

[Go ahead and say it.]

"Can I obtain skills, not items from the store?"

[Skills?]

Taesan's question was unexpected, and Balbambara momentarily froze.

[If it's skills, are you talking about the type of skills you want?]

"That's right."

[……Just wait a moment.]

Balbambara searched through the information he had and found what Taesan was talking about.

[……It's possible.]

And he gave an answer.

"The effect of the skill depends on what it is, but that level of authority is permitted."

"That's right," Taesan muttered to himself, a faint smile on his face.

"It's definitely more convenient to have skills than equipment. But you have to pay the price. The number of equipment you can obtain will decrease from five to fewer."

"I don't care."

[Then say it. What skill do you want?]

"I want a change in attack power. Specifically, a conversion of damage."

Taesan said.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Can I infuse my attack with pure physical strength?"

* * *

Balbambara didn't understand Taesan's words at all.

It was because the words were too absurd. "Infuse attack with physical strength?" Taesan spoke to the bewildered Balbambara.

"To be exact, it's about converting damage into physical strength."

[... Ah, I see.]

Only then did Balbambara understand.

[He was talking about the system side.]

Attack power is one of the basic systems in the labyrinth. It increases in proportion to the equipment worn.

And when an attack hits the opponent, damage proportional to one's attack power is dealt.

However, physical strength does not exist in that context.

Attack power is a numerical value that determines how much impact one can deal to the opponent. It's the strength and agility that make one stronger and faster.

And damage only has meaning when it directly hits the opponent.

In other words, it has no effect until it hits.

It's about directly granting physical strength to that damage.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It meant that physical strength was added to every attack, equivalent to the damage dealt.

Balbambara understood Taesan's words.

But because of that, he couldn't understand.

[Is it really necessary? Your abilities far surpass your attack power. To be honest, the attack power you have now is hardly meaningful.]

The rate of increase in attack power couldn't keep up with Taesan's growth rate. Above all, chaos was a power that existed beyond the damage system, and its magnitude was incomparably high.

Even if physical strength was added to damage, there was no significant change. That was Balbambara's judgment. So, he couldn't understand why they would want that.

[It's not impossible. It's a perfectly possible thing.]

Balbambara was troubled.

Skills were different from simple equipment. It was a concept that directly granted the system of the labyrinth to the opponent.

To put it bluntly, it was like granting the authority of a wizard.

So, it was necessary to make a very careful decision. He needed to evaluate the opponent's achievements and results, and judge whether the skill's effect was worthy of them."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, the skill that Taesan mentioned was relatively lacking compared to his achievements.

"......It doesn't matter,"

Balbambara, as the administrator of the labyrinth, was granted freedom of action. And in his judgment, this was not a problem.

[Good.]

Balbambara made a conclusion.

Giving a skill of this level wouldn't disrupt the balance. There was no need to obtain a magician's permission.

[Let's give the skill.]

"......Really?"

Taesan's pupils widened as the permission was given too easily.

[It's fine at that level. But since it's a skill that directly interferes with the system, other rewards will disappear.]

Even if it's a skill that's lacking compared to his achievements, it's still a skill. Since it's granting power directly, a greater price was needed than just simple equipment.

Taesan's answer was naturally affirmative.

"It's fine. Do it."

[You're expecting something strange.]

Balbambara manifested his power with an tone of "I don't understand". The skill was implanted in Taesan.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have acquired the special passive skill [Damage Physical Power Conversion].] [Special Passive Skill: Damage Physical Power Conversion] [Proficiency: 1%] [You can now directly convert damage into physical power, which is proportional to the damage dealt. It doesn't seem to have a significant effect yet.]

Taesan smiled. Barbalban couldn't understand his reaction.

[It seems I made a wrong judgment this time.]

"Hmm."

Taesan was extremely satisfied. Even a small conversion rate was enough, no matter how small. That was sufficient.

"I'm satisfied. Thank you."

[…….]

Barbalban felt uneasy.

Taesan clearly had powerful skills.

Add to that. Soul Edge. Conversion. Copy.

With those skills, Taesan could deal significantly higher damage than other adventurers, but it was still within the realm of common sense. It wasn't extraordinary. Taesan wouldn't be unaware of that.

But Taesan was genuinely satisfied.

[……I don't know.]

Barbalban shook off his doubts and continued with his task.

[Lord Arilnan, the wizard is currently absent. I'll prepare a place for you to stay until then. Please follow me.]

Whoosh.

The space opened up.

Barbalban entered it.

"Thank you."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan sent a message of gratitude to the departing Balbambar.

Ariran watched the process with a fascinating expression.

"Is that the power of a magician? It's quite unusual."

[You'll be able to meet soon.]

"I'm getting excited. It's going to be interesting."

Ariran smiled satisfactorily and moved his body. As Balbambar entered the connected space, he said:

"Then, I'll wait."

The space closed.

"How was it?"

[……It wasn't bad. No, it was good. I feel fulfilled.]

Akasha spoke in a low voice, and her tone was clearly filled with joy.

[But……it's confirmed. You are my master.]

"That's enough."

Taesan thought about the possibility of Akasha, who had met her old master, changing sides, but that issue seemed to be resolved. Taesan confirmed the blessing given by Ariran.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Blessing of God: Arilnan's Blessing] [This is Arilnan's Blessing. Even though she lost herself, her blessing still holds a clear power. All regeneration abilities increase, and one's will is unbreakable. It reaches an extremely high level. If the goddess regains her own concept, she can also obtain the corresponding authority.]

The effects of the blessing he had were integrated and strengthened. It felt several times stronger than before.

And the goddess's authority was added. For now, Arilnan's loss of self is meaningless, but it will change later.

The cleanup is finished.

The cleanup of the 92nd floor is almost complete. The rewards obtained are ones that can be used a little later.

It's time to move on to the next floor now.

And a familiar energy was felt from below the floor.

Taesan headed towards the stairs."
