**Episode 599**

**599. Extra Story, 1st Floor, Lee Tae-yeon (1)**

"What?"

Lee Tae-yeon opened her eyes.

What she saw in front of her was a house with a chimney.

A well in the middle of the village.

It was as if a medieval-era village was right before her eyes.

"What, what?"

Lee Tae-yeon was flustered by the unfamiliar feeling of being in a traditional village.

Why was she here?

What had happened?

As she thought about it, her memories came flooding back.

What had happened just before?

"Uh."

She involuntarily shrunk back.

She had been living a normal, mundane life, just like always. It was dull and uneventful, but at the same time, it was a peaceful daily routine.

But that daily routine suddenly collapsed.

The sky opened up. Not figuratively, but literally.

It broke apart and shattered, revealing strange, otherworldly monsters beyond.

She couldn't identify them, but there was one thing she was certain of.

Those creatures were not benevolent towards them.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Monsters have started to trample the world.

Someone had been crushed to death in front of her. The limbs of what was once a person were scattered in all directions, and only then did people come to their senses and start screaming and running away.

Yes, that's right.

They had run away.

Then, where was this medieval town?

Why was she here?

She barely managed to grab her shaking head and recall her memories. As a result, she was barely able to remember.

"A strange window......"

had appeared.

[Your world is being destroyed by invaders. The weapons you've worked so hard to create are useless against them.] [But don't worry.] [A merciful being who pities you will give you an opportunity.] [We will give you a choice. Choose where you want to go! Enter the labyrinth and clear it to gain power.] [And come back to save your world.]

It was a window with that kind of feeling. It was something inexplicable, something that couldn't be explained by modern scientific technology.

"There must be a choice among them......"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There were three modes: Easy, Normal, and Hard.

You could roughly guess the difficulty level just by the name. Easy mode was the easiest, and Hard was the hardest.

So, what did she choose?

"...... I don't remember."

The last thing she remembered was the monster's body and the sword she had pressed down on it desperately to survive.

She didn't remember what difficulty level she had chosen. Lee Tae-yeon bit her lip tightly.

"Well, first..."

It wasn't just her who had options. From the reactions of the people around her, it seemed they had also been given choices.

So, she wasn't alone.

There must be someone.

Lee Tae-yeon stumbled as she got up.

She was in the central square of the village.

But there was no sign of any living being.

The only sound she could hear was her own ragged breathing.

A feeling of being abandoned overwhelmed her.

"......"

No.

There must be someone."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She held onto hope and started to wander around the village. The village wasn't small. It would take her almost two hours to walk around it without resting. Normally, she would be out of breath halfway through, but her breathing remained steady.

However, she didn't have the mental clarity to realize that. Like a girl hanging from a cliff, she frantically searched the village.

The harsh truth she discovered was that there was no one in the village.

Thud.

She sat down without realizing it.

"No, it can't be."

It was impossible. She couldn't be the only one left. She had searched the village frantically, but she saw nothing.

"Oh, oh, oh..."

Her body trembled violently. The fear of being left alone overwhelmed her entire being.

No, she hadn't checked everything yet. There was one more place she hadn't checked.

But the fear she felt there was even greater than the loneliness of being left behind. Her instincts were warning her that the place was terrifying.

She had no choice now. She took slow and hesitant steps.

How long did she walk? She finally saw a small cave.

And a black-haired man was leaning against the cave wall with his eyes closed, excluding herself, there was another person.

But she couldn't be happy.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That man is dangerous.

At least, he was a qualitatively different existence from the people she knew. Her instincts were screaming warnings like crazy.

But there was no other choice. She suppressed her instincts and approached the man.

'...Hey?'

'What's up. You're here.'

The man opened his eyes. He yawned, looking sleepy, and gazed at Lee Tae-yeon with narrow eyes.

At that moment, Lee Tae-yeon involuntarily took a step back.

The opponent was clearly a human, just like her. His physique looked solid, but he was still an ordinary adult size.

But she was overwhelmed.

It was like the sensation of a carnivorous beast growling. The man tilted his head, looking at Lee Tae-yeon, who was unconsciously protecting herself.

'What's wrong?'

He was currently in a state of perfect concealment. If he didn't, adventurers would be too scared to approach him, so it was only natural.

To see his true nature, one had to be at least on the same level as him or higher.

And it was impossible for someone who had just entered the labyrinth to reach that level."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It seemed like Lee Tae-yeon had caught a glimpse of his power, if only for a moment.

'...There's one possibility.'

How did the woman figure out his level?

If her latent power was at a level that could surpass him, it was possible.

'Must be a misunderstanding.'

The man lightly brushed it off. It was impossible. Among the many adventurers in the labyrinth, there was no one stronger than him.

Moreover, as far as he knew, the woman was from a peaceful world. She was an ordinary, weak human who wouldn't be able to detect his hidden power.

He must have been startled by the sudden situation. The man judged so.

'Well, are you going to explain?'

'Explain? What's going on right now...?'

'Are you going to listen or talk?'

The man's attitude was strong, implying that he wouldn't listen to any other response.

Lee Tae-yeon couldn't help but nod his head.

'First, congratulations. I am the guardian of the labyrinth. I am the protector of this place and the one who will guide you.'

The man spoke in a very mechanical and official tone.

'What's your name?'

'My, my name is Lee Tae-yeon...'"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's me, Lee Tae-yeon. I'm a Broken Man. You must have heard it outside, right? Your world is being destroyed by invaders. This place is a chance given to you by a merciful transcendent being."

The Broken Man grumbled.

"What a ridiculously merciful being. It would be better to just let it be destroyed and be happy."

"What, transcendent being?"

Lee Tae-yeon looked puzzled, but the Broken Man continued to speak indifferently.

"This is a labyrinth. You can call it a tower if you want. It has a total of 100 floors, with a big change every 10 floors. The deeper you go, the harder it gets. You'll figure out how to survive inside the labyrinth on your own, and you can find the details yourself. That's it."

"......What?"

Lee Tae-yeon couldn't understand what the Broken Man was saying. Transcendent being? Labyrinth? It sounded like something out of a fantasy world.

"Uh, can you...?"

"I'm tired. There's a guy selling stuff inside, so go ask him."

The Broken Man's face was filled with annoyance.

"......Inside?"

"I already told you. This place is a mercy given to you by a transcendent being, who is allowing you to survive as you are."

The Broken Man gestured towards the inside of the cave.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Go inside and see the end of the labyrinth. I don't know if it's possible, but if you succeed, you'll gain the power to save your world."

"……."

"I want to tell you to go in, but as a gatekeeper, I have to do my job."

As the Broken Man swung his arm, the space split open. Lee Tae-yeon was amazed once again by the magical-like sight.

"Say 'confirm'."

"……Confirm."

With cautious words, the system window covered her vision.

[Hejin's Armor] [Defense +1] [Seems to block minor injuries] [Rusty Sword] [Attack +1] [Will break soon]

Attack and defense. It was like game stats.

"Equip them automatically. And shout 'status window'."

"Status window."

[Lee Tae-yeon] [Level: 1] [Health: 100/100] [Mana: 10/10] [Strength: 10] [Intelligence: 10] [Agility: 10] [Attack +0] [Defense +0] [The target is in a very confused state.]

Stats, huh.

She couldn't help but laugh awkwardly. The Broken Man nodded his head.

"Well, now go down."

"……."

Lee Tae-yeon looked beyond the cave.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Although she couldn't see anything, she could strongly sense that the inside wasn't going to be friendly towards her.

"Attack power and defense power. Stats. And a labyrinth."

Lee Tae-yeon had played a similar game before.

A game where you cleared a labyrinth in a limited space, equipped with various gear, and descended. A roguelike game.

It was a game she enjoyed playing.

The current situation was very similar to that game.

And to that extent, she instinctively knew what she had to do there.

She had to stake her life.

"Ugh..."

She hated it.

She had been living a peaceful and leisurely life, but suddenly she had to risk her life. Like an ordinary person, she showed her reluctance.

"That... I need information."

She stuttered as she spoke.

"With just what you've said, I can't go down. The information is too limited. At least..."

She was speaking reasonably. There was almost no information that could be gleaned from the Broken Man's explanation alone. It was only natural to demand a more detailed explanation.

"Ah."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If there was a problem, it was that common sense didn't apply to the other person.

"Ugh, this is annoying."

A killing intent seeped into her voice. Lee Tae-yeon's body stiffened reflexively.

"I'm the gatekeeper. I'm the one who guards the entrance to the labyrinth, right? I also kill intruders who aren't adventurers?"

The broken man bared his teeth.

"From what I see, you look like the intruder. What do you think?"

Lee Tae-yeon's breath caught.

It was only then that she realized.

She had been thrown into a savage space without order, law, rules, or reason.

"Decide. Either die here or disappear from my sight right now."

In the end, there was no choice. She trembled and took a step forward. The deep and dark cave slowly swallowed her whole."
