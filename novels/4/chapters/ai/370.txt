Chapter 371

371. The 77th Floor, the World on the Brink of Destruction (3)

Solving the food problem. Breeding livestock. Purifying the air.

Taesan thought of several other methods as well.

Taesan focused his mind.

"Construct it."

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

Pillars rose from the ground, and the earth transformed, twisting and turning into houses made of dirt.

Taesan tapped on the house. Even with a strong force, it didn't budge.

"It's okay."

The people were thrilled with the newly created houses. They eagerly looked around.

"Wow!"

"It's spacious!"

The dirt houses were empty, but people were satisfied. They no longer had to worry about rainwater leaking through the ceiling gaps or living in a tent with holes that couldn't block the wind. It was incredibly happy.

Taesan did many things after that.

He treated the injured, patrolled the city surroundings, and the people's trust in Taesan grew deeper.

"Hmm."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, Taesan was not satisfied.

It was clear that the city had found stability, but that was only because he was there. It was just a temporary solution.

Simple farming was not possible on polluted land. They had to use sacred powers or items to purify the land first. The land where simple farming was possible was limited.

With a population of this size, there wouldn't be a problem, but if the numbers increased, the story would be different. Someday, there would be a food shortage.

Air purification was also impossible without Minerva. They couldn't stay here forever, and if Taesan left, the problem would arise again.

What Taesan wanted was not just immediate survival, but to create an environment where they could continue to develop and live. A world that would collapse without him was meaningless.

'What should I do?'

Taesan continued to think of a solution.

Of course, it was only Taesan who was not satisfied, but the people of the city were extremely happy.

The food problem had been solved. With more time, they would even be able to eat meat. The air was purified, and strong houses were built.

"This place has become a paradise in an instant.

'Is that so?'

'What's going on?'

The old man, who had met Taesan for the first time, cautiously approached him, chuckling and handing him an old bowl.

'Take it.'

 Inside, there was a small loaf of bread.

'There's no flour, is there?'

'I had some stored away. It's on the verge of spoiling, but it's still edible. People made this bread for you with the last remaining flour.'

Taesan took the bread and put it in his mouth. The old man gazed at him with a strange look.

'Do you know that people are calling you the messenger of God?'

'I do.'

In fact, divinity was slowly seeping into Taesan. He had received a quest from the gods and came to this place, so it wasn't entirely different, and he didn't deny it.

'Faith.'

A thought flashed through Taesan's mind.

As he organized his thoughts, the old man opened his mouth.

'You are...'

Really, are you the messenger of God?

But the old man swallowed his words."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Before the world was destroyed, there was a god who protected their world. Everyone worshipped that god.

But when monsters appeared, their god disappeared.

They were killed by the old god, but they didn't know that. They thought their god had abandoned them.

Other gods appeared and stopped the monsters' invasion, but they all disappeared without a trace after the monsters were gone. People thought they had been abandoned again.

In that situation, the gods sent their messengers to save them. It was a very strange thing.

"Thank you."

The old man couldn't say anything but words of gratitude.

"Thanks to you... we can have hope."

He himself wouldn't live long. He had always worried about whether his grandson would be able to survive in the harsh world after he died.

Fortunately, thanks to Taesan, his worries had decreased significantly.

"But I'm still uneasy," the old man muttered with a worried face.

"If they discover this in another city, they won't just sit back and do nothing."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The old man had said it before. There were five cities in total, each governed by a different group. If you excluded the city of the abandoned, the power was almost evenly matched, with each side fiercely opposing the other.

Taesan asked, "Exactly how are they divided?"

The old man seemed to have forgotten to explain it in detail back then.

The old man began to explain.

There were five cities in total.

Each city was governed by a different group.

The Red Flame God.

The Blue Frost.

The Calleiat.

The Godless.

The Abandoned.

"The other cities are in a slightly better situation than this place. They have a small but proper livestock, and their food production is also somewhat established."

It wasn't great, but at least a small number of people could live without worrying about food.

"And each group has individuals with special powers."

"Special powers?"

"They can manipulate invisible forces, and some have physical abilities that far surpass those of ordinary people."

The old man glanced at Taesan.

"Like you, for example."

The old man seemed to think that Taesan was one of those individuals.

Taesan didn't deny it.

"Since the monsters appeared, people with such powers have suddenly emerged."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"After the monsters appeared. Then, it was likely that they were related to the gods. The old man continued to speak.

"Those with such power are ruling over ordinary people, treating them like slaves. Those who cannot accept it or are deemed useless are rejected and come to this city."

The old man scowled.

"They... are still fighting each other. Even in this ruined world, they are trying to kill each other for their own interests. It's not enough to just combine their powers to survive."

The old man couldn't understand.

"If those people find out about this place... it could be dangerous."

"That's right."

Taesan murmured, his indifferent attitude making the old man's face serious.

"They are extremely powerful. You also have special powers, but they are non-combat powers."

Taesan had not shown them his combat-related abilities.

At most, he could cultivate food and purify the air. Naturally, people thought Taesan's abilities were in that category.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"On the contrary, their power is focused on brute force. They can't even break a rock the size of a house."

The old man said with a tone of warning.

"You can't let your guard down, even if you're strong. You need to be prepared."

"That's right."

Taesan replied.

The old man was taken aback by Taesan's still uninterested attitude. Taesan asked the old man,

"You said there are five cities. Are there no other survivors?"

In response to the question of whether the survivors in this world were all gathered in those five cities, the old man's face turned gloomy.

"At least, there are no confirmed survivors other than those five cities. That's the reality of this world."

The old man replied.

All the survivors in this world were gathered in those five cities, without a single exception.

Taesan thought of one possibility.

* * *

"Hooo..."

A muscular man with a bronze-like physique slumped into a soft sofa, letting out a relaxed sigh.

He was the master of the Red Flame, one of the rulers of the five cities. His name was Malbre.

"This is boring."

He was extremely bored.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A long time had passed since he had reached a stalemate with other groups. Unless one side made the first move, a collision would not occur.

There was no problem with food either. As the lord of the city, he could eat any kind of food he wanted. Many people had died because of him, but he didn't know about it.

The world was on the brink of destruction, but he was living a life of luxury.

To him, the present was better than the world before its destruction. Before the destruction, he was a lowly, struggling person. But in the process of destruction, he suddenly gained immense power.

What could he do to alleviate this boredom?

"Let's catch some slaves."

Those wretched, powerless people who could only crawl on the ground. Yet, they were desperate to live, those slaves.

But the emotions they showed when they died were quite entertaining to watch.

It was the moment when Malbre was about to make a conclusion.

The luxurious door opened, and a man entered.

"What's going on?"

"I have a message to report to Your Highness.""
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The man bowed his head to the ground and paid his respects. It was all because of Malbre's orders. He wanted to be called the Emperor and forced others around him to do so as well. Malbre raised his chin.

"Permission granted."

"I have returned after scouting other cities as you wished, Your Majesty."

The man, like Malbre, had gained special powers when the monsters invaded. Thanks to his greatly increased speed, no one could easily catch up to him. Malbre had entrusted him with the task of scouting.

"What is the situation in the other cities?"

"Three cities were normal. But... the city of the abandoned ones was different."

"Hmm?"

Malbre's face scrunched up at the unexpected name.

The city of the abandoned ones. It was a place where useless people who only consumed food gathered to live. It was a place where nothing was left, slowly dying, and Malbre had been ignoring it.

"What was in that place?"

"......"

The man couldn't easily speak. Malbre scrunched up his face, urging him to continue. Finally, the man opened his mouth.

"They were eating corn."

"......corn?"

"Not only that, but watermelons were also in sight."

"What?"

Malbre's eyes wavered.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's corn. It's something that's hard to see these days. Especially in the case of watermelon, it's been a while since I've seen one."

"Even the quantity wasn't small. Everyone who was visible was carrying corn or watermelon."

"What's going on? What's that?"

Malbre scrunched up his face. The man spoke quietly.

"I overheard their conversation, and it seems they're saying that a messenger of God has descended upon them."

"A messenger of God? What's that?"

Malbre burst out laughing. He didn't believe in God. He thought he had become strong through his own power, and that he had defeated the monsters because of his own strength. Although there had been a few incidents that went beyond his understanding, he believed they were all just misunderstandings and didn't doubt it.

"It seems that someone with the ability to produce food has entered the abandoned city."

Malbre revealed his intentions.

"Summon the executives. We'll go stomp on the abandoned city and bring him back."

"Yes."

The man quickly responded.

After hearing Malbre's orders, the executives of the Red Flame gathered. Malbre told them that someone who could produce food was in the abandoned city. He ordered them to conquer the city and bring him back.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If you don't follow our words, it's okay to kill all the others in the city. Just don't touch that guy absolutely."

The officials all responded in unison.

Malbre came out with the other officials. The exhausted slaves, who were working with pale faces, saw his face and trembled with fear, hiding their bodies.

Malbre received their reaction with pleasure.

He was the emperor.

No one could challenge his power.

Malbre believed it without a doubt.

Before long, Malbre arrived at the city of abandoned people.
