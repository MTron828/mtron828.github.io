Chapter 216

216. 51st Floor, Alchemy (3)

"Did you return to the village? At that time, I looked at the flowers and weeds around me and saw what was written there. What was it like?"

"I couldn't understand it."

After learning alchemy, Tai Shan had checked the flowers and roots before.

The information written on the system was about the energy, resonance, harmony, and combination of the materials.

There was no information on how to process this information to get what you want.

The old man seemed to know this and said:

"It's natural. Even with the system's assistance, it's not easy. I took five years to master alchemy properly."

Five years.

Even for Tai Shan, who had lived a long life, this was not a short time.

"You can understand the materials with the system's assistance, so it won't take that long for you. But to get to the level where you can use it, it will take at least half a year. Is that time available?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san nodded his head. It was almost time for his next return. He had to train to the best of his abilities before then.

Barriya thoughtfully stroked his chin. He had made a decision.

"If we're talking about a short period of time, there is a method to learn it," he said.

He raised one finger.

"Just one thing. To master the properties of alchemy, which has numerous powers, in one direction. This won't take days. Do you want something?"

"What can be done with alchemy?"

"As I've said before, it's diverse. One can recover physical strength, feed an enemy to torture them, change the shape of one's body, as I showed you earlier, and even create a kind of domain."

Domain.

This was exactly what Tae-san wanted.

"I want to learn about the domain."

"Alright. Then let's learn quickly."

Barriya took Tae-san out to the front of the house. He began to sprinkle powders and liquids around Tae-san.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The area will have the power you think it has. You can specify a certain range and weaken the enemies within it, or strengthen yourself. There are many other functions, but it's too complicated to explain them all, so let's just show you for now."

He scattered materials one by one in a northeast direction centered on Taesan. And when he was finished preparing, he threw a single petal at Taesan,

Kuuuung!

At the same time, a massive oppression covered Taesan.

It was like the pressure of a giant's direct oppression.

"What's going on?"

"It's heavy."

Taesan moved his hand. If he can feel this level of pressure, other players wouldn't be able to move at all. Barrija's face turned pale as he trembled.

"It's moving smoothly. I made it rough, but I used quite good materials, though……."

He moved the positions of the materials and removed a few of them. Then, the pressure on Taesan disappeared, and a giant force condensed in its place.

Kuuuung!

The force was infused into Taesan. His entire body became stronger, and his field of vision expanded.

"What's going on this time?"

"Body strengthening?"

That wasn't a weak strengthening. Taesan had skills that gave bonus stats against his opponents, and he had been strengthened to that level. Barrija let out a disappointed sigh.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's not very effective, as it was made temporarily."

"How high of a level can it be made to?"

"Is it even comparable to the level of this?"

It wasn't at a level where it could have a significant impact on the battle.

"It seems like the effect is just being shown. I'll explain how it's made."

The baritone showed each of the materials spread out around Taishan like a mountain.

"The area is east-west-north-south. We need to place materials in all four directions. The forces of these materials will clash and combine to form a force."

"Do we just need to place materials in that area?"

"That's not it. The basics are that way, but there's no need to be fixated on just four directions. However, managing all four directions at your current level is quite difficult."

The baritone explained slowly.

"The area is not the force that comes from combining. It's the force that comes from the rebound between materials, which forms inside."

"Should we just put away the things that are highly resistant?"

"That's a bit ambiguous. If all materials resist, the force will spread outside. To gather it inside, one of them needs to be less resistant."

Note: The conversation appears to be about the concept of combining materials to create a force or energy, and the importance of balancing and harmonizing the materials to achieve the desired effect. The speaker, likely an expert in the field, is explaining the principles to someone who is less knowledgeable.
Here is the translation of the text:

There are three materials with strong resistance, and one material with weak resistance. It seemed that they formed a field.

"It's not that difficult."

"But the next step is the problem."

The barrier passed a mangled petal to the Tai Shan.

[A white flower that has not received light] [It has a deep and heavy atmosphere. The rebound is strong, and it is difficult to harmonize. It wants to engulf other things.]

"You should pay attention to the deep and heavy atmosphere and the fact that it wants to engulf other things. The contents of this field do not change its effect. It is almost impossible to pull out the desired effect by understanding the contents of each material."

There are thousands, tens of thousands of cases that can be derived from the five materials. Even if we only consider one field, it's the same.

"So, what should we do?"

"Memorize it."

He stored information about the materials in his mind and remembered all the effects that occurred as a result.

The barrier smiled slightly.

"I know it well."

* * *

Tai Shan spent some time with the barrier, memorizing the effects of the materials and the combinations that emerged from them.

"It's been a long time since I've memorized something simple."
Here is the translation of the text:

The labyrinth is a place where one cannot advance with secrets. Instead, understanding and experience are the most important things.

So, I had never made an effort to remember something until I started navigating the labyrinth. It was natural for me to remember it because I was doing it naturally.

That's why I was able to memorize the combination of materials.

Tae-san remembered dozens of materials and the effects derived from them, one by one, and put them in his mind.

After two days, Tae-san was able to grasp the overall effects.

"Is it faster than I thought? I thought it would take a week."

"You only need to remember the important things."

He discarded all the unnecessary effects and only remembered the things he would really use, so it didn't take too long.

In two days, I also gathered many of the materials I needed in the forest and had enough for a while.

"That's it, then."

The barrier gave Tae-san a worried look.

Tae-san waved his hand.

"Don't die. I'll come back later."

"I'm no longer thinking of dying."

The barrier smiled slyly.

The barrier realized its own wishes in the labyrinth.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

He didn't know it himself, but it was a rare occurrence in the history of the labyrinth.

"Take this before you leave."

Barri gave Tai a single bead.

[Shape-shifting bead] [It can change one's physical form into the desired shape. However, the duration is not very long.]

Tai's eyes narrowed as he read the explanation. Barri shook his head.

"The materials were more than I expected, so I made two. I don't need them, so take them. Maybe you'll need them someday."

"There's no reason to refuse."

Tai accepted it. Barri bid him farewell.

"Come back and visit me again. I'll be waiting for you."

Tai waved his hand.

He left the forest. Now the long journey of 51 floors has come to an end. It's the start of the 52nd floor.

At the end of the forest, there was a single staircase.

Tai placed his foot on it.
Here is the translation of the text:

You cleared the 51st floor. You obtained the basic reward, "Broken Spirit's Ankle Guard". You also figured out the hidden element of the 51st floor and obtained a reward. The 52nd floor quest has started. You must defeat the boss of the 52nd floor and pass through. The reward is the "Transparent Spirit's Necklace". The hidden reward is unknown.

I finally received the rewards for the 51st floor.

I checked the items obtained by Taesan.

"Broken Spirit's Ankle Guard" - Strength +150, Agility +100, Defense +100 - A leg guard worn by those who once broke through the labyrinth. He has become a broken spirit.

"Is it the Broken Man's thing?"

The broken-hearted gatekeeper who guards the labyrinth. Taesan's first NPC encounter was the Broken Man.

I wonder why he was broken-hearted. Although he was broken-hearted, he did not remain on the 51st floor. He had a power that even Taesan could not win against.

Perhaps he is guarding the entrance with a contract with a magician.

What's the reason? I don't know yet.

First, the performance was quite good for the 51st floor. Since I entered a new layer, I think I should upgrade my equipment soon.
Here is the translation of the text:

[He used it.] [A belt that brings calamity] [Power + 200] [Defense + 200] [A belt that brings calamity wherever it goes, destroying everything. Whether it's the power of the belt or just a coincidence, it's unclear.]

"It's definitely good, but......"

Taisean looked at him with an ambiguous gaze. His power and defense, both at 200, were much higher than what he was wearing.

However, he didn't have any attack power. Since attack power was the most valuable thing to Taisean right now, he couldn't help but feel a sense of regret.

But his defense had increased by 130, so it was worth replacing.

Taisean arrived at the store owner's shop, who was sitting at the entrance as always.

"Long time no see?"

"I had a lot of things to do."

"That's a bit strange. But it looks like you won without any problems."

The dwarf looking at Taisean smiled, his lips curling upwards.

"You even overcame the strange power's influence. That's very good. Go deeper and grant my wish."

The store owner laughed with a look of longing in his eyes.

Taisean passed by him.

The 52nd floor began, and the 52nd floor's labyrinth was formed by the same stone walls as before.

"Was the 51st floor special?"

Note: Taisean is a character's name in Korean, and it's not translated here as it's a proper noun.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Not all floors are like that. But from the 60th floor onwards, it will happen frequently, and almost all of them will be like the 51st floor, so you can enjoy it freely.

As I heard the ghost's words, I felt a sudden sense of reality. We have already reached the middle of the labyrinth, and almost reached the deepest part.

The Taesan broke through the tunnel.

And in the appeared room, there was no monster to be seen.

However, the monster was here. The system window notified it.

[A transparent snake appeared.]

Sss.

The sound of a snake slithering across the floor echoed. It was quickly heading towards Taesan.

Taesan inserted his sword.

The snake jumped and ran away, but Taesan accurately judged the snake's position and struck it with half a sword.

[Aaaaah!]

The snake is howling. Even if it hides its appearance, it's meaningless. The right concept skill has now allowed Taesan to read the intentions of ordinary monsters to some extent.

"'Transparent monster, perhaps.'

Unless you're an adventurer who hasn't obtained skills related to scouting or vision, it's not a problem for Taesan.

The 51st floor was so massive that it felt strange. Since there was nothing extraordinary, Taesan quickly cleared the 52nd floor."
Here is the translation of the text:

As Taesan was tidying up the room, something arrived.

Paralack.

It was a note with wings.

Taesan eagerly flew towards it with a fluttering heart. Taesan, who had been staring blankly, stretched out his hand.

Paralack.

The note barely landed on Taesan's palm.

And then it trembled slightly before coming to a stop.

"What's this?"

The ghost replied.

"If there's an unforeseen situation, I'll send a note to deliver the news. Although it's sold at the shop, it's quite expensive, so it's not often used. Who sent it?"

"It's not a fake."

Taesan unfolded the note. As Taesan read the contents, he let out a sigh and gasped in amazement.

"What's the content?"

"Half-ran has finally finished the job."

[...Ah.]

The ghost realized.

Taesan had entrusted many materials to Half-ran, including the core of a saint, the claws of a dragon, and the core of a spirit.

And Half-ran said that it would take some time to make something with these materials.

The note was announcing the long-awaited results.
