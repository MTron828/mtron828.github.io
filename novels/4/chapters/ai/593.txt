Chapter 594

594. Extra Story, Mashin (6)

Baal brought various dishes to Lucifer.

Chocolate. Cakes. Fruits. Even dishes made with meat.

He provided Lucifer with a wide variety of things, and Lucifer was extremely satisfied.

"Hmm, this is good."

Lucifer pierced the pudding with a fork, and it softly broke apart.

As he carefully put it in his mouth, Lucifer wore a very satisfied smile.

"This taste is also possible. It's good."

[Is he satisfied?]

"Extremely so. I really like it."

Lucifer was delighted like a child. His appearance was quite cute.

Lucifer's talent was extremely exceptional. Compared to the value of what he brought, there was a difference like dust and diamonds.

He was rejoicing as if he had gained the whole world with just that dust.

That was a certain joy for Baal.

[It seems this kind of thing doesn't exist here.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There's nothing. It's always just a bunch of potatoes. Sometimes meat comes out, but it's not enough. I try to cook it somehow, but unfortunately, my cooking skills and seasonings are severely lacking."

Lucifer grumbled and poked at the pudding with a fork. He put it in his mouth and smiled with satisfaction.

"This is a seasoning bomb. It may seem like too much, but when you balance it, it turns out like this."

[It's fortunate that you're satisfied.]

To his surprise, Baal took Lucifer's suggestion seriously.

She put in a lot of effort to find the most enjoyable and satisfying food for herself. The process was quite enjoyable.

"I'm satisfied."

Lucifer, who had finished eating, wiped his mouth with satisfaction.

"Good."

[What do you want next?]

"Next."

After a moment of thought, Lucifer opened his mouth.

"Your favorite dish."

[...My favorite?]

"Since you're bringing this out, don't you think you have some knowledge about this side as well?"

[If I say there isn't, it would be a lie.]

Baal enjoyed the byproducts of mortals. Other high-ranking angels or demons would say that he enjoyed the byproducts of trivial things, but Baal didn't care.

"So, what's your favorite thing?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lucifer smiled wryly.

"You have a preference, don't you? Not something I like, but something you like. I want to try it."

[He knew.]

"Sweet and spicy food. Exactly the kind of thing a kid would like. How can you not know?"

Baal chuckled.

[Good. I accept.]

"It's what you like best. Don't choose carelessly."

Lucifer gazed at Baal with a serious expression. Baal happily accepted the gentle warning from the small life.

[I'll be careful.]

As he left the model garden and returned to his residence, he thought deeply.

"Is this my favorite dish?"

It was a theme he had never thought about before. He enjoyed byproducts, but he didn't particularly distinguish between them.

Baal, who had been thinking for a moment, let out a dry laugh.

What was the most appealing byproduct among the universe's creations?

He never imagined that he would seriously consider such a thing.

But surprisingly, it wasn't bad at all. In fact, he was looking forward to it. What was his favorite dish, and how would Lucifer receive it?
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A new sensation.

At least it wasn't boring.

But even he didn't know, a smile was hanging on Baal's lips.

As he was about to leave, someone approached him. The moment he recognized the existence, the smile on Baal's face disappeared.

[Baal, sir.] [Bellial.]

One of the 72 demons, a lofty and exalted immortal being.

Bellial slowly approached Baal.

[You seem to be enjoying yourself.] [I am. Yes, I did.]

Not now, but Baal gazed at Bellial with a cold eye.

[You also seem to be enjoying yourself.] [Yes. I had a pleasant experience today.]

Bellial said with a good mood."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Today, I killed an old man's son, who was eight years old. The son's son was twenty-four. The son's son's son was eighty-two. I made them all die with my own hands. When I killed the last one, his expression was quite something to see.] [Is that so.] [I waited 78 years to see that sight. It was troublesome to raise those insignificant mortals and make them have children, but the joy of being troublesome was certain. I was satisfied. I'll have to do it again in a different way later.] [It was fun, wasn't it.]

Baal laughed. It was a fake laugh, devoid of emotions.

[Will you join me, Lord Baal?] [No, I'm done. I'll enjoy my own pleasure. This is better.] [Oh, is there a greater pleasure than this? I'm very curious. Please tell me about it later.]

It's disgusting.

The power, the intensity, the smell emanating from the being in front of me. The language they speak. It's all disgusting.

When did I start feeling this way? Even Baal himself didn't know. It was too long ago.

Suppressing his disgust, Baal spoke lazily.

[When the time comes, that's what will happen.] [Thank you. Anyway.]

Belial asked with a puzzled expression.

[I've been feeling a strange, unpleasant sensation in the demon world for a while now. It's a very unpleasant feeling... Do you know what it might be?] [No, I don't know. It's probably just my imagination.] [â€¦Is that so?]

Belial was slightly taken aback. It was unlikely that a demon like him would mistake an unpleasant feeling, but Baal was too decisive.

[Yes, that's what it will be.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ba'al spoke bluntly.

[So don't worry about it.]

* * *

"Is this your favorite dish?"

[At least among the foods I've eaten, it's the most suitable for my taste. I don't know exactly what kind of dish it is, though.]

A high-end restaurant's creation, made by combining numerous ingredients.

Ba'al continued to ponder and realized that it was the most edible.

[The humans outside seemed to like it a lot.]

"I don't want to eat something else, I want to eat your favorite dish."

[You don't have to worry, I'm the same.]

"Hmm, it doesn't look that delicious, though."

Lucifer tilted her head, picked up her fork, and slowly put the food in her mouth.

And Lucifer's pupils grew larger.

She paused for a moment, then slowly savored it. After several tens of seconds, she swallowed what was in her mouth.

"......It's delicious."

Lucifer expressed her pure impression.

"And it's amazing."

Ba'al was a transcendent vessel.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Taste and smell, physical sensations, brain processing speed, and intuition. All of these aspects had transcended human understanding. He had already mastered every dish he had ever eaten. As long as he had the ingredients, Lucifer could recreate them at the same level immediately.

But this dish was the only one he couldn't decipher.

The numerous ingredients that went into the dish, the ratio of their combination, and the skills required to create them.

The sum of all these factors was something that even Lucifer couldn't easily grasp.

It was a completely new sensation for Lucifer.

"It's not just a matter of talent. It's closer to a technique that has been refined over generations, carrying a history. Humans outside can do this too. We're too different."

His eyes and voice were filled with envy.

Baal, who had been watching him for a moment, spoke impulsively.

"[Do you want to go see it?]"

"What?"

Lucifer's pupils dilated.

"[Do you want to go see this restaurant? It's probably business hours now.]"

"Is it okay? You're in the universe, can you move around so freely?"

Of course not.

The one who had brought the dish was one of his scattered subordinates across the universe, not him personally."

Let me know if you have any further questions or need clarification on any part of the translation!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The moment the transcenders ruled the universe, they would try to trample Baal. And if they were to enter the human realm, it would be even more so.

It was a task that required taking a huge risk. There was no reason to do so just for a small existence right in front of them.

But.

The astonishment in Lucifer's eyes.

The expectation hidden within.

The moment he saw it, all doubts disappeared.

[It doesn't matter. That's possible to some extent.]

"......Really?"

[What should I do.]

"Then, I'm fine with that."

Lucifer stood up with an expectant face.

"Take me with you."

* * *

[Let's wait for a moment here.]

Baal opened up space and leaped into the universe.

A planet was in front of him.

A massive planet where countless humans lived and developed.

[I'm impressed. You're doing all sorts of things.]

Baal muttered to himself as he approached the planet.

And at that moment, a massive power of the universe converged on Baal.

It was the power of the universe's concept, the great power that ruled over itself.

Baal summoned darkness.

A silent collision occurred. The power of the universe's concept and the power that had existed since before the creation of the world clashed and twisted each other. Baal clenched his fist.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[It's an insult. Maria.] [Can't help but react that way, right?]"

A bright and cheerful female voice rings out.

"[An old man who was stuck in the demon realm suddenly appears in this domain. Can't help but have an extreme reaction, right?]"

The Goddess of Choice, Maria.

She has descended upon this place. As if conversation is unnecessary, Maria unleashes her power.

The concept of the universe binds Baal.

It's an unreasonable choice. An unreasonable coercion that excludes all resistance and defense.

But it doesn't work on Baal. A dark energy gathers in his hand. It's a pure, ancient power unlike modern magic.

It explodes.

The concept of the universe is shaken. Maria's power and Baal's power collide and cancel each other out. Maria pulls out her power and blows away the magic.

"[A monster-like thing.]"

Maria clicks her tongue. She gathers her power again.

But Baal raises his hand.

"[I don't intend to fight. I'm just here for sightseeing.] [Sightseeing?]"

At the completely unexpected words, Maria bursts out laughing.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You're saying something that doesn't suit you at all. You're trying to despise us and sully us whenever you want.] [I know it's hard to believe.] [No, it's not that I don't want to believe. It's just that I don't think I can believe.]

Maria is gathering her strength. The concepts that have been gathered there are all the choices of the universe.

Even if it's Baal, if it's a direct hit, it's a collection of powers that need to take a break for a while.

"Is persuasion really that difficult?"

Baal clicked his tongue. Then, he couldn't help it either.

Baal raised his hand. Maria, who thought it was an attack, gathered even more strength.

However, Baal's subsequent actions easily surpassed her predictions.

[I, the great demon king, Baal, am making a declaration with my name and title.]

Baal's authority began to bind and restrain himself.

[If I, because of you, were to sully and pollute the universe, I would be bound to you.]

It was a declaration of self-restraint.

No matter how strong one is, it's impossible to defy the moment one's title is established. Maria stopped gathering her strength.

[If I were to sully you, I would become your slave.] [â€¦â€¦What is this.]

Maria was taken aback.

[What do you plan to do?] [Didn't I say so? It's just a simple tour. I just have one companion.]

Note: Baal is a name that appears in various mythologies and religions, often associated with demonic or divine beings. In this context, it seems to be used as a title or name for a powerful entity.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ba'al spread his arms wide.

[If you refuse, I'll have no choice but to work towards my goal on my own.]

[â€¦â€¦.]

Maria hesitated. Would accepting Ba'al bring her benefits or harm?

And then the answer came out. Maria opened her mouth.

[I'll accept, but on one condition. I'll keep an eye on you while you're here.]

[That's what I want.]

Maria, who had been gazing at him for a moment, hid her expression.

Her intensity was no longer palpable, but it was clear that her gaze was still fixed on Ba'al.

[Seriously, you're really something.]

Ba'al grumbled and landed on the planet. He arrived at a small forest with a vast city in sight.

[Then.]

Ba'al waved his hand. Space split open, and Lucifer slowly walked out from there.

"This is......"

[A planet in the universe. A city built by humans.]

"Heh."

Lucifer's eyes sparkled with curiosity and anticipation.

The moment Ba'al saw that, he felt pure joy.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The collision with Maria was cleanly forgotten. Baal elegantly bowed his head. He stretched out his arm like a servant.

[Then, please guide the way, Princess.]

Lucifer grasped Baal's hand."
