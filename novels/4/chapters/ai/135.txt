Chapter 136

136. The Guide of Sin's Path (2)

A man with a red head, looking carefree, had a shocked expression on his face.

"What's going on?"

He had come down after receiving the call, but all the people who had called him were dead. And the one who seemed to have killed them was standing right in front of him.

"Did you kill them all?"

"If so?"

"What, incredible?"

The man was amazed. At first glance, there were only five corpses visible. It was as if the adventurer on the 30th floor had won against five adventurers of the same level.

"What's your name...?"

The curious-looking man was about to ask, but stopped.

At the end of his gaze, a ghost was standing.

"Ah, oh."

[Long time no see? Red-nosed one.]

"...Hello?"

The man scratched his head awkwardly. The ghost chuckled.

[Can't say hello. You're a brat.]

Playful tone, but a deep sense of resentment was brewing. The man smiled ambiguously.
Here is the translation of the text:

"This is really embarrassing. Ah, please don't misunderstand. I was not going to be honest about this. It's a very shameful thing to search for flaws and exploit them, you know."

"So, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to just look at it?"]

"It's too late now. The deed is done. You're dead."

The man shrugged his shoulders and shifted his gaze away.

"Are you going to intervene?"

[I don't have any intention of intervening. Let them figure it out themselves.]

The ghost spoke briefly.

The man laughed.

"Understood."

The man took a step forward.

"Wow, impressive. I couldn't have won with five people at the time. How did you do it?"

The man burst into applause, but his eyes remained fixed on the ground.

[You have activated the Scout. Due to the difference in strength with the opponent, the effects of some skills are sealed.] [Ambrosia Marin] [Level: ???]

The name was excluded, and any other information was not visible. Ambrosia stroked her chin.

"Honestly, I'd like to bring them over to our side... But..."

She was very disappointed.
Here is the translation of the text:

If they had the talent to climb to their position, they could have succeeded in breaking through the 74th floor that had been blocked so far. Even if Taesan had taken their side, the possibility of success was sufficient.

"But that's going too far."

Not only did they wipe out the 2nd tier, but they also wiped out the 3rd tier. Adventurers rarely find their way to the labyrinth, and those who reach the 2nd tier are extremely rare.

The 2nd tier is weak, but it's still part of them. They couldn't leave Taesan, who had killed them all, alive.

"Well, then, goodbye."

Ambresia threw a punch. The air exploded and a storm rushed into the room. It wasn't just a simple punch. It was an attack linked to special equipment, accompanied by physical destruction power.

This is an attack that Taesan, as it is now, cannot possibly resist.

[Your first attack was nullified.]

That was erased. Ambresia's pupils widened as she calmly gazed at it.

"What?"

She stared at Taesan with a shocked face, holding out her fist.

"What are you?"

"Look at it yourself."

[You have activated the Sacred Wrath (Rakiratas).]

The power of the gods is bestowed upon Taesan.

The changed atmosphere made Ambresia pause.

"What?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Tianshan charged forward. Ambresia held up his arm with a shocked expression.

Kaang!

[Ambresia takes 0 damage]

The arm and sword clashed, and a pitiful system window appeared.

Considering the difference in levels, it's only natural. There's no way damage would enter.

However, Tianshan continued to press on. Ambresia was still keeping up a tough defense with a still-shocked expression.

"Are you going to wait for a moment?"

"No, I don't want to."

Tianshan continued to attack. Despite the attack showing a 0 damage, he didn't care and kept attacking.

[You have activated Mephisto's Black Lightning.]

Kukung!

The black lightning pierced through Ambresia's body, but there was no damage. However, Ambresia was greatly startled.

"Is this black magic?"

The power given by the demon to humans. Tianshan was using a power that humans were not allowed to possess.

"What are you?"

Ambresia grabbed Tianshan's arm and threw him.

Tianshan barely managed to touch the wall and landed.

"What, it won't work."
Here is the translation of the text:

I know it. Even if Tai Shan is strong, it is clear that the line exists. It would not have any impact or threat to an adventurer who has gone through 70 floors.

However, I fought with such enthusiasm for one reason.

[You did not lose your courage in the face of an overwhelming enemy and fought back. You obtained the special skill [Sword of Courage] that way.]

Even I, a villain, could not surpass that level, and I could not even touch my finger and lose.

Fighting against an enemy like that without losing your courage and aiming for victory, you can obtain the skill Sword of Courage.

The condition is that effective. It's a skill that you must definitely obtain someday.

Tai Shan, who has obtained what he wanted, has risen.

Ambresia was still looking at Tai Shan with a bewildered face.

"Is it a divine messenger? Is it also a messenger of Raklata's?"

A divine messenger, given by gods to those who are pleasing to them.

The one who receives it is bound to their soul to the god and must move according to the god's will.

However, among the guides of sinful paths, including Ambresia herself, there were almost no one who received it.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even if it was a decent proposal, it was not a true contract for a god. It was only a contract for a puppet, and no one had taken on the role of a god's servant.

How ridiculous, really. It was a god who didn't care about its dignity as a god, and did whatever it pleased.

"And what about black magic?"

The god was extremely demanding. While it cherished its own possessions, it didn't care about all the demons. Even among the guides of evil paths, there were demons that the god had never spoken to.

But on the other hand, the god was extremely possessive.

Could such a god give black magic to humans?

It meant that the god had given priority to the humans standing before it over the demons.

It was unheard of for a god to give black magic to humans.

"Who are you?"

* * *

'Alright then.'

That's enough for now. Ambrosia had come to this place to eliminate him, but it seemed to have lost the will to touch him anymore.

The reason was simple.

It was because it didn't know what would happen if it touched him.

"Are we going to keep fighting?"

"Oh, just wait for a moment."

Note: The text appears to be a fictional dialogue or scene, possibly from a fantasy novel or story.
Here is the translation of the text:

Ambresia spread her hands to block the path of the Taesan. She furrowed her complex face and turned her head.

They also knew. The gods were not pleased with themselves for being led astray by the path of sin. Although they did not strictly follow the laws of the labyrinth, they could crush their enemies at any moment.

However, there was an adventurer who seemed to be receiving attention from those gods.

"'This is a mistake, and I'll ruin everything?'"

Ambresia swallowed her saliva.

Even if it was Lakyaratas and Ma Shin, they were not gods who obeyed the rules or were indifferent to mortals. They showed unlimited concern to those they favored, and were powerful enough to intervene.

"'It's not possible.'"

Ambresia made a conclusion. It is impossible to kill. The entire process was watched by Taesan.

[The sound of turning one's head is heard.]

"Ha ha ha."

Ambresia smiled mockingly. The enemy was no longer visible.

"First, friend. What's your name?"

"My name is Kang Taesan."

"That's Taesan. I am Ambresia, you know."

"I know."

"Ah, I've already done reconnaissance."
Here is the translation of the text:

Ambresia scratched her head. Although she hadn't paid much attention to the impact of the Sadohwa, thinking about it clearly would mean she had already learned reconnaissance, which was an unreasonable story.

Ambresia was deep in thought and made a decision.

"Hey, friends. Shall we just give up?"

Ambresia raised her hand.

"It seems to have exceeded my ability to handle."

It's not a matter for me to judge alone. Ambresia made a judgment.

"So, I'll leave it."

"I'm sorry, but that's not possible. You've broken our rules. I can't just let it go."

Ambresia's eyes, which had been speaking lightly, had fallen silent.

If she refuses, I'll drag her along by force. It was expected, so Taesan said it without any enthusiasm.

"So, what do you want to do?"

"I need to consider the judgment of everyone, not just myself."

The same expected answer came back.

Taesan said flatly.

"Tell me to go down to the depths?"

He aims to get the judgment of other high-ranking officials, not just himself. That was Ambresia's answer.

But Taesan had no reason to do so. If he goes down to the labyrinth, the rewards of the previous layer will be at a level where there is nothing. He had no intention of going down even if he died.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Don't worry about it. I won't ruin a promising one, regardless of whether they become an enemy or an ally."

Ambresia held a small key.

"You'll see."

[Secret Key of the Labyrinth] [Heading to the 70th floor. You can return to the previous floor by using it again. This key does not affect the Labyrinth's system when using it to move.]

A ghost laughed.

"Are you going to write it down here? Even if you're going to die, you won't be able to get it wrong, right?"

"Don't be too anxious. I came here because others are climbing up and I don't want to be bothered, so I had to come. It's not like they'll complain about it."

Ambresia shrugged her shoulders.

The ghost spoke to the key-holding Taesan in a quiet tone.

"This is a very precious key that only the shop owner sells to those who go down to the depths. It's expensive because it's consumable, and we can't use it easily. That's why we don't have to worry about it."

"Okay."

Taesan nodded his head.

"How do you use it?"

Taesan's bold words made Ambresia slightly uneasy.

"Now?"

"If so, should we delay? Let's hurry up and finish. I have to go down to the Labyrinth too."

"...What's going on?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Ambresia was bewildered. She had to go down to the 70th floor, which was the enemy's hideout, without knowing anything.

As a general adventurer, even if she were extremely bold, she should have been hesitant or afraid. However, Ambresia did not show such a reaction.

On the contrary, she seemed to be looking forward to going down.

"What do you want?"

She had a fleeting thought, but then shook her head.

There's no way. The information possessed by the ghost is also possessed by them. The 70th floor is completely understood.

After Ambresia gathered her thoughts, she opened her mouth.

"It's not difficult. I just need to think about going there in my mind."

Tae-san closed his eyes. Ambresia's words caused him to recall the place. As he did, he felt a change in the air.

When he opened his eyes, he saw a completely different scenery.

Ambresia spread her arms.

"Congratulations. You've reached here, and you're not even level 150 yet. This is your first time, isn't it?"

[You have arrived at the 70th floor.] [You have arrived at the depths using the secret passage. You have obtained the title [The One Who Walks Through the Cracks].]

The walls of the labyrinth were gray. To be exact, it was not even worth calling it a labyrinth.
Here is the translation of the text:

When he arrived, he found himself in a vast room, roughly the size of a soccer field.

It was not a hidden room or a boss's room, but a room of this size existed. It was completely different from the labyrinth he had descended so far.

"Let me rest here for a while."

Ambresia waved her hand, and a leather chair and refreshments appeared.

"I'll call the others. Just wait a little."

He quickly left the room. After a while, Tai Shan sat down in the chair and looked back at the room.

"It's comfortable."

He was extremely relaxed. The luxurious chair was comparable to those on Earth, and it was a truly comfortable feeling.

"The refreshments are delicious too."

It wasn't just a single note of sweetness. The ingredients were mixed together to create a complex flavor that was being pulled out. It was an extremely refined taste.

"Is there a chef?"

[Even if I have to stay here for the rest of my life, there may be a few people who have learned this as a hobby.]

"That's really disappointing."

Tai Shan chewed the refreshments with a "crunch".

[But then, what's the problem here is... ]

"The real problem starts from here."

To descend the labyrinth, he had to face a certain challenge sometime.
Note: Ambresia is likely a character's name, and Tai Shan is also a character's name, but I did not translate them as they seem to be specific names in the story.
Here is the translation of the text:

The guide of evil has come to capture him. It was expected. I had to create chaos and destroy the third-order system, as I couldn't just sit idly by.

The organization has rules, and those rules must be followed. Someone will come to punish the one who has destroyed the rules.

However, even if they come, he cannot kill the one who has destroyed the rules. Because the one who has destroyed the rules has the favor of the gods.

The gods who are dwelling in the labyrinth.

They detest the guide of evil. The ones who have felt what the one who has destroyed the rules has felt cannot be unaware of it.

Those people cannot easily touch the one who has destroyed the rules. At least, they will gather and hold a meeting.

I knew everything would turn out this way. I perfectly predicted it through the mention of the demon, the story of Yoon-ah, and the advice of the ghost.

"What should I do then?"

From now on, it depends on the one who has destroyed the rules, his own ability.

"First, before that."

The one who has destroyed the rules moved.

70th floor.

There was something to be obtained here.

While he was doing something, the guide of evil and the leaders of the group were gathering together.
