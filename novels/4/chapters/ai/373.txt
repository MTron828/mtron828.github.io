Episode 374

374 (Extra). The Earth on the Brink of Destruction. Lee Tae-yeon (4)

"Ugh... ugh... ugh..."

"It hurts. It hurts. It hurts..."

"My arm!"

The screams and groans of people filled the space.

Lee Tae-yeon clenched her fist with a determined face.

They had barely won against the monsters.

But it was a hollow victory. Half of the players had died, and many of the survivors were severely injured.

The treasure trove they had desperately built was completely destroyed.

"Ugh."

Lee Tae-yeon barely suppressed the emotions that surged up in her. She had seen countless tragedies. She thought she had gotten used to it, but that was her misconception. The smell of death and fear still lingered strongly.

Lee Tae-yeon gritted her teeth and moved.

She took out the items she had.

She purified the earth's poison, reorganized the territory, treated the injured people, and eliminated the remaining monsters.

It was only through her desperate efforts that she was able to barely finish.

"Ugh... ugh..."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What's going on? What's happening? This is ridiculous..."

But the confusion did not subside. The people who had held onto hope because of Tae-yeon's existence were once again despairing at the emergence of the monster that even she had struggled to defeat.

Tae-yeon was also at a loss, stumbling over her words, when Taesan spoke calmly.

"Get a grip. You're alive, having risked your life, and all you do is despair and wait to die?"

The cold voice struck the ears of the survivors.

"Stand up. We're the last survivors on earth. We've overcome so many deaths, and you're going to give up over this?"

"......"

People gritted their teeth. Despair and sadness slowly began to subside.

Taesan stepped back.

"It's your turn."

"Ah, okay."

Tae-yeon comforted the people and began to rebuild again.

They rebuilt the ruined buildings. They recreated the protective domain, making it stronger and wider than before. Now, they would be able to handle the monsters' attacks.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We also re-established the way to deal with monsters. Until now, whenever a strong monster appeared, we would just leave it to Taesan and Iteayeon.

But S-grade monsters are different. They're not monsters that two people can defeat with confidence. While the two of them were fighting the monster, other players had to come up with a way to hold on.

There were many discussions.

"Was there a wave before I came?"

"Yes, once. We died a lot back then."

"Then is this the second time...?"

* * *

Time continued to pass.

Players continued to return to the labyrinth. As a lot of time had passed, there were especially many hard-mode players.

They had become much stronger than during the second wave.

And so, the third wave began.

The monster invasion.

Hundreds of A-grade monsters and several S-grade monsters attacked.

"Aaaaah!"

Iteayeon let out a furious cry.

"Die!"

He used the precious items he had been holding onto without hesitation.

Humans and monsters killed each other.

In the end, they achieved a wounded victory.

"Damn it..."

Iteayeon spat out blood and sat down, exhausted. This time, it was really a close call. Even though they knew the enemy's strength and prepared thoroughly, they were still pushed to the brink of death."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She barely managed to stand up, leaning on her trembling knees. The survivors cheered with all their might. It was a moment when they wanted to celebrate their victory, despite the countless deaths and the destruction of the territory.

Thud.

The space was oppressive.

Lee Tae-yeon gazed up at the crack in the sky with a pale face. There, he felt a gaze.

"Ah..."

Lee Tae-yeon's body trembled.

A chill ran down his spine.

Beyond the crack, he felt an overwhelmingly powerful force.

He wasn't the only one who felt it. The easy-mode players, including Izi, couldn't withstand the gaze and collapsed. Even the hard-mode players who managed to hold on were shaking all over.

Thud.

The gaze that was watching them disappeared. People let out a sigh of relief and sat down.

"...What was that?"

Taesan's scrunched-up face was the only thing that lingered in the air.

* * *

They barely managed to recover from the damage.

They rebuilt the ruined territory and repaired the destroyed buildings. They used their past battles as experience and began an even more intense training.

But no one smiled.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

When Lee Tae-yeon first returned, most of the people who had sent her trusting gazes had died. The remaining people didn't have any hope of surviving either. They had all given up, thinking they would eventually die, and were just struggling to stay alive.

"Haha..."

Lee Tae-yeon let out a hollow laugh.

After blocking the wave, she saw the gaze from beyond the crack.

It would probably be the next monster to invade the earth. Having cleared the labyrinth, she knew exactly what that monster was.

"The apostle..."

One of them, an existence that had transcended mortality.

No matter how many times she died and revived, she could never win against that opponent.

Others may not have been as certain, but they instinctively sensed it. The power felt from beyond the crack was something they could never reach.

There was no hope in sight.

Everyone was already embracing death.

"What's the point of this?"

Taesan scowled at the sight of those people.

"If you're going to die, go outside the territory and die. Don't drag people who are trying to survive with you."

"But..."

"But what? Are you going to give up just because you can't win? Is that why you cleared the labyrinth?"

"Brother, calm down."

Geumjunggeun hastily approached Taesan, who spoke coldly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I don't think I'll die. I'll do my best to win."

Taesan's voice was extremely cold.

But it wasn't a wrong thing to say. They didn't explore the labyrinth to die, but to survive. Now that they had come this far, they couldn't give up their lives and admit defeat.

It was an insult to their lives, which had been staked on exploring the labyrinth.

People gritted their teeth and moved their bodies.

Iteayeon watched them from afar with a wry smile.

Originally, it was her job to do. She was the only player who had cleared the alone mode. As the leader who led people, it was her role, but Taesan, who was in easy mode, was taking her place.

"As expected, the leader role suits him."

But it wasn't her, it was Taesan.

However, Taesan couldn't be the leader. He was an easy mode player, after all.

Iteayeon bit her lip.

Time continued to pass.

They recovered from their damages and worked together with the players who had returned from the labyrinth to expand their territory again.

But the monsters scattered throughout the world were getting stronger. It was hard to survive unless you were a hard mode player.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As a result, the number of people continued to decrease.

"Hmm..."

Lee Tae-yeon gazed up at the crack in the sky with an ambiguous expression.

It had been a while since the third wave. It wouldn't be long before the fourth wave started.

"Let's go."

Lee Tae-yeon jumped up.

"Geum Jung-ah, I'll go on a reconnaissance mission. Did Taesan go to catch a hard-mode player who escaped?"

"Yes, he'll probably come back alone."

Geum Jung-ah said with a wry smile. Lee Tae-yeon shook her head.

"I'll be back."

"Okay, be careful."

Lee Tae-yeon covered her entire body and stepped out of the territory.

She saw the massive wall that protected people and wore a bitter expression.

It was enormous, but its size was only enough to fit within her field of vision. The number of remaining humans had decreased to the point where a single wall like that could protect them all.

"Huh."

She composed herself and jumped up.

Like before, she arrived at the crack in the sky. Thanks to her previous experiences, she could predict when the wave would start based on the power waves she felt from the crack.

"Huh?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Her eyes, which had been quietly observing the power of the crack, trembled.

The wave of power from the crack was spreading anxiously.

"Ah……."

Her leg trembled for a moment. It was a wave from her memory.

It was a sign that only a week was left until the start of the Wave.

Gulp.

And she felt a gaze from beyond the crack directed at her.

Lee Tae-yeon's breath caught for a moment. She had activated all her stealth skills, but the gaze from beyond the crack had definitely recognized her.

But the gaze from beyond the crack disappeared after a moment.

"……Ha. Haha."

After a while, she let out a laugh. It was a hollow, desperate laugh.

She stumbled back to their hideout.

The people waiting for her cheered at her return.

"Oh! Tae-yeon nim! You're back?"

"How was it this time?"

Lee Tae-yeon, who had been looking at them for a moment, opened her mouth.

"……Where is Tae-san?"

"Ah, Tae-san nim? He's probably educating the hard mode players who just returned."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

“……That’s right.”

She slowly walked by, and the man who answered looked at her with a bewildered face.

“Why are you like that?”

“No.”

After a moment of contemplation, Lee Tae-yeon opened her mouth.

“Tell Taesan to come to me tomorrow.”

* * *

The sound of the ticking clock echoed.

She gazed at her room with empty eyes.

All the decorations and paintings that she had prepared to hide her emotions were now useless. It was all over anyway.

‘I can never win.’

There was no chance of winning. Knowing that, she still activated her skill.

[You have activated a thousand possibilities.]

Is it possible to win against the swordmaster?

She searched for possibilities.

The result was her death every time.

[You have activated a thousand exclusions.] [You have activated a thousand possibilities.] [You have…….]

She continued to activate her skill, repeating her death tens, hundreds, thousands of times to find the answer.

But it didn't come.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As long as she consumed all her mana and her skills didn't activate, there was no outcome other than death.

She pressed her chest with her trembling hand.

A week later, she died.

Her breathing quickened. The fear she had tried to forget overwhelmed her.

"Hahaha..."

She put her hand in her bosom. She grasped something solid and fondled it.

The Ouroboros' jewel.

She could turn back time just once.

If she used this item, she could survive for now.

But she couldn't use the jewel.

Did she have to break through that labyrinth again? That hell-like place?

If she turned back time, all her powers would be reset. She would return to her weak past self with no abilities.

In that state, she couldn't guarantee that she could clear it again. It was as if she had barely cleared it with luck and miracles.

And even if she cleared it, she would eventually have to return to Earth. She couldn't choose to abandon all the survivors and live in the labyrinth.

But dying here was also unbearable.

She couldn't make a decision."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Time kept passing, but she remained seated, lost in thought, unable to shake off her worries.

Would she meet her end here?

Or would she return to the labyrinth?

Her mind was complicated, unable to lean towards one side or the other.

She was still deep in thought when...

A presence drew near.

It was then that I-Taeyeon realized the owner of the presence was Taesan.

"Huh, didn't I tell you to come a day later?"

She hastily checked the time and realized she had been worrying for a whole day.

"No way!"

She couldn't meet Taesan in this state.

She quickly feigned composure.

The door creaked open, and a voice that sounded like it was trying to hide its surprise echoed.

"What's with that weird habit of yours?"

"Don't you want to hear about my hobbies?"

I-Taeyeon's mouth moved on its own.

Thanks to her long experience, she had become a top-notch actress. Although she still hadn't found an answer, she put on a perfect facade of composure to greet Taesan.
