Chapter 341

341. 73rd floor, great mage. Xian (3)

Tai Shan is stronger than when he faced the Spirit King. He dodged and blocked the surging magic, and continued to move.

[Xian activated the magic release.]

The accumulated magic exploded and engulfed the surroundings. Tai Shan activated Nabierius' golden sword. He roughly drew a line and created a hole in the energy wave, then inserted his body into it.

"Snort."

Xian spat. His expression was not very bright.

"I didn't get the expected benefits."

He checked Tai Shan's records and prepared a counter for all his abilities. As a result, he was able to block Tai Shan's movements and prevent him from approaching.

Originally, he was planning to consume all three attack nullifications.

However, he consumed only one attack nullification, and the lust for destruction. That was all.

It was because Tai Shan responded faster and more quickly than he expected.

"'The skills he used must have a time constraint, but......'"
Here is the translation of the text:

Sado-hwa, the vessel of the king, the incarnation of nature.

This skill amplifies power and strength instantaneously, but it's impossible to use it for a long time. After just a few hours, the activation would come to an end.

However, Shaiyan was different. The effect of the magical circle he spread was extremely powerful, so the duration was not long. If he prolonged the time, it would not be beneficial.

It was time to make a decision.

Shaiyan swung his staff, applying pressure to Taesan. Taesan barely blocked Shaiyan's magic.

"'I won't use partial world alteration,' he said."

The skill, which allows him to respond to the king's world by altering the world itself and summoning favorable laws, was partial world alteration. Shaiyan continued to use it with caution.

However, the current situation of Taesan was not good.

Despite blocking it, he was unable to approach Shaiyan. His mana was fully restored by the magical circle, while Taesan was unable to recover and was suffering losses on one side.

Note: Sado-hwa is likely a Korean term, and its translation may vary depending on the context. In this case, I translated it as "the vessel of the king, the incarnation of nature".
Here is the translation of the text:

Even in this situation, there is no reason to spare partial world changes.

The cooldown period for partial world changes has not arrived yet, or maybe the cost hasn't been prepared. Shayian made a judgment about this.

Then, it was time to take out the trump card prepared to counter partial world changes.

Kiying.

The equipment surrounding Shayian began to shine.

As the attack paused, Tai Shan stood still and looked at Shayian.

Shayian is a deep-level adventurer. He also had deep-level equipment.

"Behold the true power of magic."

[Shayian activated the unchanging magical circle targeting the subject.]

Kuung!

The massive magical circle that had been quietly dormant began to operate, accompanied by a loud noise.

Energy flowed from the ring worn by Shayian.

[Shayian activated the five apocalyptic seals.] [The first seal was charged.]

A transparent, colored arrow was attached to the end of Shayian's staff.

The power contained within it could distort space and turn everything in its path into dust.
Here is the translation of the text:

The power that could even topple Mount Tai was contained within. Tai Shan realized that the thing was Shaian's trump card.

[Shaian activated the designation of target.]

Power flowed from Shaian's bracelet and designated Tai Shan.

[Shaian activated the ruthless space compression.]

Power flowed from Shaian's robe and consumed the space.

[Shaian activated mana acceleration.]

Shaian's staff began to emit light.

The power of multiple deep-level equipment was unleashed. Tai Shan quietly grasped his sword and prepared to respond to the attack by strengthening his entire body.

And then Shaian brought down his staff.

[Shaian launched the first shot.]

Just as Tai Shan moved to respond to the system window, his body's time suddenly reversed. The startled Tai Shan realized too late.

[Your second attack was absolutely invalidated.]

He had already been hit by an arrow. The attack invalidation was activated, and time had returned to before the attack hit.

"It wasn't visible."

[Shaian reloaded the second shot.]

Keying.

A transparent, shining arrow was once again placed on Shaian's staff.

It's invisible. It can't be blocked.
Here is the translation of the text:

So, it was observed.

Taishan made a quick decision.

[You have accelerated your mind.] [You have grasped the essence.] [You have launched a reconnaissance.]

It's pointless to try to block an invisible attack. Since there is still one way to invalidate the attack, I thought I would try to understand the type of attack.

"'Pointless effort.'"

Shayan mocked Taishan and shook his cane.

[Shayan fired his second shot.]

He focused his will and determination.

The world seemed to come to a standstill in an instant.

And Taishan could see it. At the moment the transparent arrow was launched, it jumped over the space and arrived directly in front of Taishan.

The arrow hit Taishan.

[Your third attack has been completely invalidated.]

All attacks have been invalidated. But what was gained was gained.

"'An arrow flying in from the space.'"

It was exactly like that. The space was compressed. At the moment the arrow was launched, it had already arrived in front of Taishan, so it was not possible to see the arrow flying in.
Here is the translation of the text:

Then, could we quickly move away to avoid it?

Tai Shan shook his head.

Among the skills activated by Xiaian, there was a targeting skill. Although I don't know the exact effect, it's likely that this skill targeted Tai Shan as an individual. No matter how he moved, he was bound to hit.

The arrow struck.

The countermeasure was one: to crush it with brute force.

Tai Shan retreated behind Minerva and Barkazar.

[Xiaian reloaded his third shot.] [Xiaian fired his third shot.]

Tai Shan did nothing.

The arrow leapt over the space and arrived in front of Tai Shan, and Tai Shan's body moved.

[Your final chance has been activated.]

"What's going on!"

And Xiaian, who had been watching, was shocked.

Kaka, kaka, kaka!

Tai Shan's sword blocked the arrow. The space was distorted by the intense collision, and the arrow's power was felt as it struck the sword.

Kaka!

The sword's blade was bent.

The arrow's trajectory was deflected and stuck to the wall.

Kuuuuuung!
Here is the translation of the text:

The sound of thunder boomed against the walls of the labyrinth. Tai Shan turned his gaze towards it and let out a forced smile.

There was a crack on the wall of the labyrinth.

"Is this the extent of your power?"

The last chance skill was a skill that would absolutely block a fatal attack, meaning it had the power to consume over 10,000 units of health.

"I..."

Shayan was staring at Tai Shan with a shocked face.

"What's going on?"

The five sieges that brought about destruction.

Deep within, the big shot had sold high-value equipment at a high price.

Among them, there was one ring that had captivated Shayan.

It was a ring that bound the original magic.

As a magician, Shayan felt the immense power of the magic contained within the ring, which was even stronger than any magic he could use. Despite being bound, it radiated an incredible power.

Shayan was a magician. If it meant taking a step up in magic, he could give up everything.

He decided to buy the ring.

Although the price was higher than other equipment, it didn't matter to him. He had used up all the gold he had gathered while exploring the depths.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, I didn't get to use it for a long time after purchasing it.

The reason was that I couldn't remove the seal inside the ring.

I tried to undo the seal by attempting to cancel the magic and even brought in other guides to help, but the seal remained unchanged. It was as if it was a power that couldn't be reached.

Shayan did not give up.

From the time he purchased the ring, all of Shayan's efforts were devoted to removing the seal.

After trying countless spells and even using the clearing conditions for each layer, he finally managed to remove the seal after an immeasurable amount of time and effort.

As a result, he obtained the five times of the apocalyptic magic.

Shayan's eyes widened. Despite dedicating his entire life to magic, he couldn't surpass the intermediate level. However, he had become so powerful that he could surpass the mortal realm. He was extremely thrilled and immediately used the magic.

However, he almost died.

If the Fire Spirit King hadn't reflexively opened the door to the king's world next to him, he might have really died there.
Here is the translation of the text:

The power contained in the advanced magic was too high for him to handle.

However, Shayan found a way to control the ring. He combined and utilized numerous equipment from various layers, invested a lot of time in creating a magic circle to fix his status and make him immune to damage, and finally succeeded in controlling the advanced magic after many years.

Even so, he still needed to spend several days designing the magic circle in one place to properly control it, so he had never been able to use the equipment properly up until then.

However, it was undeniable that its power was tremendous. The power that surpassed the limits of mortality was contained in the arrow.

But now, Tai Shan had blocked the arrow.

"...No way..."

Shayan quickly regained his composure.

The last opportunity to turn the tide had arrived. It was likely a skill to block a fatal attack, and since he couldn't have multiple such skills, he wouldn't be able to block any more arrows.

Believing this, Shayan loaded the arrow again.

[Shayan fired his fourth shot.]

Tai Shan's sword turned black.
Here is the translation of the text:

And the golden light enveloped that place, beginning to change into a grayish hue.

During the three attacks, the arrows flying towards the place were precisely aimed at Tai Shan's chest. Since there was no slight change, it seemed impossible to adjust the position of the arrow.

Once the attack position was known, it was simple to respond. By matching the skill to the place, it was possible to strike with the sword.

Tai Shan unfolded the boundary line and wielded it.

"Kuaa, kuaa, kuaa!"

The arrow that collided with the boundary line let out a scream as it began to shatter. The arrow that was destined to bring about destruction was being repelled with certainty.

Tai Shan poured all his strength into the sword and wielded it again.

"Kugugugung!"

The grayish hue drew the boundary line. Shaiyan hastily drew back his body.

"...Can I crush it with brute force?"

Shaiyan muttered to himself, and Tai Shan shook his sword.

"Is that all?"

As for the current Tai Shan, to what extent could he handle the boundary line without taking risks?

He confirmed this through this attack. Even an attack that transcended mortality could be blocked without hassle if it was the boundary line.

However, if it was just a single strike, it seemed that even the arrow that had been defeated by the half-elf of the destroyed world could be completely blocked.
Here is the translation of the text:

After that, it would take some time to use it again, but it was a significant advantage to be able to handle it stably.

"It's okay."

However, it was also necessary to have someone who could help with the confirmation. Xi'an perfectly fit the bill.

"No, it's not possible."

Xi'an murmured to himself. His eyes were filled with negation.

"No, it's impossible to stop this power!"

Xi'an roughly took out his staff.

He had spent all his energy to barely control the ring, which was like a reflection of his self-esteem.

But it was Tai Shan who had broken it now.

Xi'an couldn't accept it.

The transparent arrow appeared on his staff again.

Tai Shan took out his sword.

He still had a chance to withstand it. He could ignore his body and rush in, and it would be enough.

However, there was still something to be confirmed.

He had confirmed that it could block the boundary.

So, if it's now, can he block this arrow with his own power, not just the boundary?

He understood the power contained in the arrow when he used it as a last resort and blocked the boundary.

The possibility is sufficient.

"Help me out."

"According to the master's will."

[I understand.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Taisan grasped the palatal guard. Although it's not enough to bring about a significant change in the partial world, there was a material that could amplify it for a moment.

[You have activated the partial world change.]

Taisan's and the spirit's powers suddenly surged.

Shayan's eyes, filled with bloodlust, glared out.

"Die."

[Shayan has launched his fifth shot.]

Along with the system window, Taisan wielded his sword.

Ka-ka-ka-ka!

The forces collided, and the space began to collapse.

A intense pressure from the powerful force enveloped Taisan.

Shayan's eyes widened in shock.

"It's impossible to block! It's impossible to stop!"

"Eeeeee!"

Minerva gritted her teeth and pulled out even more power.

Minerva is the Spirit King. By absorbing the natural essence, her power has been further amplified.

Barkaza also assists.

The natural force is maximized. The power contained in the arrows and the opposing forces make it difficult to retreat easily.

[You have activated Nabarius' golden sword.] [You have activated the Starlight Arrow.] [You have activated Amo's black spear.]

You consecutively activate magic and dark magic. The effects of the continuous spellcasting amplify the power, which gradually increases.

"Come forth."
Here is the translation of the text:

[You have activated the declaration of focus.]

You gather your will, and the power of the Taesan, which holds all the peaks, is contained within one sword.

The arrow begins to vibrate slowly.

The power that surpasses the limits of mortals pushes against the mortal enemies.

"This is...impossible..."

Futile murmurs echo. The Taesan infuses even more power into the sword. It takes a step forward and swings its arm.

[You have activated the sword of unyielding spirit.]

Kuuuuuuuuuung!

A loud noise bursts forth. The explosion scatters in all directions, covering the Taesan with its power.

[You take 53,432 damage.]

The Taesan's arm trembled. Minerva and Barcza were unable to withstand the power, and were instead counter-summoned.

But they emerged victorious.

The Taesan pulled out a potion. Although it was a sloppy move, Shan was unable to do anything.

Ki-ing.

The sound of the explosion and the unchanging magic circle collapsing.

"What...?"

He murmured blankly.

High-level magic,

a power that was absolute and unattainable.

That high-level magic has been dispelled now.
Here is the translation of the text:

"...Impossible! It's an impossible thing! It's a high-level magic! It's a power that cannot be reached!"

Tae-san scolded Shiyan's reaction.

"You've set your own limits. You're not qualified to use the name of a great mage."

He himself cannot reach absolute high-level. He is only middle-level. Shiyan had decided that.

After recovering all his physical strength and mana, Tae-san manifested his power. His mana began to condense.

"Akiasha. Do you know?"

Tae-san's words made Shiyan's body stiffen.

"Right. I thought you were a different person because of your name."

Tae-san received a quest for revenge from Akiasha, an NPC, on the 45th floor. The target's name was Mantekar.

However, he is currently facing Shiyan.

In order to erase his ugly past and be reborn anew, Mantekar had changed his name to Shiyan.

"However, the essence doesn't change."

Shiyan is an ugly traitor. He couldn't overcome his inferiority complex and made a wrong choice. That was his essence.

"Akiasha's gift. Mantekar."

[You have activated an one-sided mana barrier.]
