Chapter 426

426. 83rd Floor, Essence of the God of Fall (8)

"......What is that?!"

The magic is unfolding.

It wasn't someone else's dark magic, but Taesan's own dark magic.

"What is that?!"

The sage's face contorted as he shouted.

It was as if he hadn't expected Taesan to use his own dark magic.

"As expected."

He was now in the realm of the God of Fall.

The God of Fall must have examined Taesan's inner self and confirmed the power he possessed.

However, the god didn't know everything.

The magic of denial was a power created by the fusion of black and magic. Even Zerband, the god of magic, couldn't predict this magic.

The place where he acquired it was the realm of the god of magic.

Taesan's acquisition of the demon's realm was similar. It was a power obtained between the god of magic and Baal.

And the god of magic and the demon god were transcendent beings like Essence.

Even if they were transcendent beings, they couldn't know about events that occurred in relationships with other transcendent beings. Essence couldn't fully grasp Taesan's power.

He opens his magic.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Dark magic uses magic to create phenomena and summon them in the devil's realm.

Taesan has poured all his magic into the realm.

The phenomenon he created is harmony and amplification.

And now, he has liberated the devil's realm here.

Hehehe!

The essence's realm, a model garden, is realized with the devil's realm. Like pouring oil on a fire, it rapidly grows in an instant.

The dark magic is a power that mixes black and Zelvand's magic. The devil's realm is close to the existence of a high god. The boundary is a mixture of black and divine.

As if they were delighted to see each other, they feel a sense of unity and start to merge without any resistance.

The magic spreads like a spider's web, entwining the boundary and dark magic.

Hahaha!

The power of the fallen god that surrounds Taesan begins to collapse.

The apostle's eyes widened.

"This can't be! This is the power of Essence-nim! It's the law of the world!"

"If you can't understand, then die as you are."

[You have activated Copy.]

The magic is copied. The doubled magic merges with the boundary and dark magic."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Something that was neither fusion nor integration, neither boundary nor anti-magic, nor black magic, was realized.

It contained the power to deny the very laws of the world.

Taesan swung his sword wildly.

"Whoa!"

A shattering sound echoed. It wasn't the sound of matter or space breaking, but the sound of concepts themselves shattering.

The authority of Essence clashed with something that denied the laws, and they cancelled each other out.

[You have overcome the power of the Transcender. You have acquired the special skill [Law Denial].] [Your proficiency in Black Swordsmanship has increased by 4%.] [Your proficiency in Boundary has increased by #$!!%.] [Your proficiency in Black Magic Creation has increased by 5%.]

"Ah, ah..."

Sado's mouth hung open in shock.

Taesan caught his breath. His condition wasn't good. His mana and magic were depleted, and his physical strength was rapidly dwindling.

He thought he was going to end it this time. Taesan took a step forward. Sado finally came to his senses late.

"P, please, God! Lend me your power! Crush everything that dares to oppose you, including myself, into the abyss..."

The prayer was cut off. Taesan had already arrived right in front of Sado's nose.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The apostle hastily stopped his prayer and gathered all his strength.

He contained everything, and then unleashed his fist.

The power collided with the boundary line, and it began to crumble.

The boundary line enveloped the apostle, and his entire body began to collapse, starting from its structure.

"Oh, oh, oh!"

The apostle let out a desperate cry. In an instant, his crumbling body regained its original state.

But it soon collapsed again.

It was like a broken vessel. No matter how hard he tried to piece it back together, it would shatter again with just a little impact.

The apostle's body was already completely shattered.

"This can't be!"

The apostle shouted in denial. He was the apostle of the God of Descent, the guardian of the model garden, who had brought despair to countless adventurers and took pleasure in it.

He believed that he could live a life of pleasure forever, without a doubt.

But now, his end was approaching.

The apostle resisted, but the boundary line engulfed everything. Just as the giant mountain was about to deliver the final blow, a massive entity intervened.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Something filled with frustration and anger tries to directly affect Taesan through Sado.

[No way. Essence. It's not fun to intervene like this, is it?]

Something else spreads power with laughter.

It was a very familiar, young girl's voice.

The power that was about to overwhelm Taesan was suddenly repelled.

Taesan swung his sword, imbuing it with a boundary line.

Sado was buried in the boundary line, and his very existence was erased.

* * *

[Your spiritual power has increased.] [Your health has permanently increased by 4,545, your strength by 875, and your agility by 587.] [Your spiritual power has increased.] [You have acquired the special passive skill [Immortal].]

Taesan sheathed his sword.

The grayish color disappeared, leaving nothing behind.

The fallen god's apostle, who had been playing the role of a gardener in the model garden for a long time, had completely vanished.

"Ah……."

"Oh……."

The audience gasped in shock.

They couldn't understand the flow of the battle from the middle.

Powers that transcended the understanding of mortal beings burst forth one after another. All they could know was the result."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As a result, the apostle was defeated.

And if they win at the Colosseum, they can all go outside.

"Oh, oh, oh!"

A cheer erupts, filled with all the joys of the world.

What's contained within is a fervent worship and faith towards Taesan.

For a moment, even Taesan felt a sense of rejection, such was the divinity gathered.

[The proficiency of divine power increased by 1%.]

"The proficiency will rise, of course."

Their numbers are not many. Compared to the number of believers on Earth, it's like a drop of blood.

But the proficiency of divine power, which had been stuck at 90%, has risen.

Each and every one of them, who had been at the brink of death, had a faith that was extremely heavy.

"Ta, Lord Taesan!"

The princess approached with a face that was both extremely happy and bewildered.

"You really won. I believed it was possible, but this... this is...".

Taesan raised his hand towards the stuttering princess.

"It's not over yet."

"Yes, yes?"

Taesan turned his gaze towards the sky.

"Come out."

[…….]

Rustle.

Space distorts."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A gaze filled with rage is directed at Taesan.

Those who were rejoicing all hold their breath and shut their mouths. Their faces turn pale.

A rage so intense that it's the only emotion they can feel, and even they themselves can sense it clearly.

That emotion alone is enough to distort the entire model garden.

And Taesan calmly lets out his rage.

[You.]

A voice rings out. A clear intent to kill Taesan is revealed.

Essence was desperate to kill Taesan.

But he couldn't.

Even now, Mashin is watching them from a distance.

In the end, Essence had no choice but to suppress his rage.

[Damn Mashin, what kind of nonsense is this?]

Essence muttered, grinding his teeth. It didn't seem like he was just angry because Mashin was holding him back. After taking a moment to collect his emotions, he declared:

[You have won in the Colosseum. You are free. My toys, farewell.]"

Note: "Mashin" is likely a name or title, and "Essence" is also a name or title. "Taesan" is also a name. The context suggests that Mashin is a powerful figure who is watching over the scene, and Essence is angry with him. The story appears to be set in a fantasy or sci-fi world with a Colosseum-like arena.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I really didn't want to do it, but I had no choice with the essence. If I win at the Colosseum, I can go outside. It was a declaration with my name on the line. Now, I couldn't take back what I said.

[And you damn thing. I'll give you a reward.]

The power of the essence dwelled within Taesan. It was part of the authority that the essence possessed.

[You have acquired the special activation skill [Fall of All Things].] [You have obtained the Shoes of the Free.] [Get lost. Next time we meet, I'll bet everything to kill you.]

The essence's presence disappeared with a fierce remark. Only then did the people who had been holding their breath finally exhale.

“……Ha, haha.”

Someone laughed. The laughter spread to everyone.

The essence's declaration had come out.

They could go outside.

* * *

Everyone cheered and expressed their joy. They had been trapped here for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years.

They had been barely holding on to hope in the midst of despair.

And now, they had grasped that hope in their hands.

There was no way not to be happy. Raynald also shook Taesan's hand with an excited face."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Thank you so much! I'm really grateful! It's beyond words! I want to give you something, but unfortunately, the curse hasn't been lifted yet, so it's impossible."

"What curse?"

"The curse of the God of Decline. We can't give each other anything. We've been freed, but the curse still hasn't been lifted."

Raynal laughed.

"When I return to my labyrinth, I'll give you everything I have. Don't refuse."

"I don't plan to refuse."

He was willing to accept the reward.

Taesan asked him, "What do you plan to do from now on?"

"......I don't know."

Raynal stroked his chin.

"We failed to conquer the labyrinth. Now, it's uncertain whether we can even leave the labyrinth. Moreover, most of us, including me, have lost interest in the labyrinth."

Raynal smiled wryly.

"We've been here for too long. We've realized that freedom is much more valuable than power."

"I...don't know either."

The princess also murmured with an ambiguous expression.

What would they do after they returned?
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They were still unable to come to a conclusion, overwhelmed by the sudden freedom.

"Let's meet with Belvandia first. Then we can think about it."

Diana said with a bright face.

"But why isn't anything happening?"

It had been a few hours since Essence declared freedom, but they were still in the model garden.

A small anxiety appeared on Reynald's face.

"Did they lie to us?"

"That's not possible. Maybe they're talking to the administrator of the labyrinth? It's too much to enter the labyrinth like this."

The adventurers who had reached the 83rd floor, which was beyond the sky.

It wasn't strange that the labyrinth was crumbling. They thought so and waited, and finally, a change occurred.

Kugugugung!

It was as if the world's role had ended, and the model garden began to close.

"Finally."

Reynald muttered in an excited tone. Diana quietly closed her eyes.

Kugugugung!

The world closed for the last time.

And Taesan returned to a familiar place.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Quest Clear.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [You have obtained the Ring of Endless Descent.] [You have obtained ???.]

83rd floor. Taesan arrived at the place where the altar of the God of Descent was located.

And he was not alone.

"...Huh? Where did the others go?"

Diana looked around with a bewildered expression.

Everyone who had been caught by the God of Descent had disappeared. Only Diana was left standing beside Taesan.

[I'm back.]

And it seemed that Balbam was also waiting, sitting in the labyrinth.

* * *

"Oh my."

Diana covered her mouth with her hand.

"It's been a while, Balbam."

[That's right, Princess.]

They seemed to know each other. It wasn't strange, considering they had made it to the 83rd floor together.

[You've done a great job again this time. Thanks to you, we can clear the 83rd floor.]

"I'm sorry."

[No, it's okay this time. You did well.]

Balbam didn't seem annoyed, unlike before.

Despite the increased difficulty, he looked like he was in a good mood.

[This isn't a bad thing for me either.]

Balbam explained.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We are in a collaborative relationship with the gods. Fundamentally, we can't restrict their actions. But to be honest, I don't particularly like the Fallen God either."

"There's no need to ask why."

The purpose of the labyrinth is to observe the struggles of mortals.

However, the Fallen God treats talented mortals as toys, trapping them in a model garden.

This was behavior that contradicted the purpose of the labyrinth. The administrator, Balbam, would not have preferred it.

"The souls that are already bound can't be helped, but from now on, souls that are used by the Fallen God will not appear."

"What happened to the Fallen God?"

"We had a conversation. As a result, we ended up having a bad relationship with them."

Balbam said calmly.

"At least from now on, there's no way you'll be able to show your face in front of me through the labyrinth."
