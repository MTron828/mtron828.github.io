Chapter 391

391. The Sixth Return to Earth (8)

"I am immortal, you know."

A stronger existence than the current Taesan.

Taesan first observed his opponent. It was a gamble to rush in without any information.

But before he could do so, the four hands of the Sado moved.

In that moment, Taesan realized that a tremendous power was gathering around him, centered on himself.

Kuooooung!

Everything around him collapsed. The earth dissipated and the air was erased. The absolute destruction that was spreading in all directions covered Taesan and crushed him.

Taesan could not avoid the attack and allowed Sado's attack to hit him.

[Your first absolute invalidation of attack has been activated.]

Blame.

Taesan pulled his body back and glared at Sado with his tongue out.

"What's going on?"

He was clearly wary of Sado's movements.

No matter how he attacked, he had prepared to respond.

However, he could not avoid Sado's attack. He didn't even think about avoiding it.
Here is the translation of the text:

The four arms moved again. Tai Shan took out a shield from his inventory.

[You used the Aegis of Igis. For one second, you are immune to all damage, but you cannot move.]

At the same time, a powerful force pressed down on Tai Shan.

The Aegis of Igis completely blocked the damage, with no damage taken.

However, Tai Shan felt pressured by the destructive power that was crushing him.

"Kugugung!"

The material was torn apart at the atomic level. It was a power that could knock Tai Shan down with a single blow. After the shield's duration ended, Tai Shan jumped through space with a limited blink.

"What's going on?"

It was like the destructive power of a monster. Even his strongest cards were being treated like ordinary attacks.

[You have activated Concentrated Detection. You have activated Essence Perception. You have activated Reconnaissance. Destroyer.]

The information that appears is only one.

The people watching the battle from the sidelines cry out in alarm.

"Oooh!"

"Oh, Lord Shiva, please forgive us!"

They tremble with fear, bowing their heads. Their emotions flow towards the demon.

"Shiva?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Taisan looked at the Taoist. A blue-skinned person with four arms and a peculiar smile. It was definitely similar to the appearance of the Shiba I saw on the internet before.

It was curious whether it was just a coincidence or if there was a connection, but it wasn't important at the moment.

The Taoist's arms moved. Taisan spread his holy power. He wrapped his body with a golden aura and flew.

[You have activated the perfect fairy's wings.]

First, he tried to dodge. It was easy to grasp the conditions of the attack since the Taoist's arms moved in sync with the attack. Taisan's body moved quickly through the air.

Zzzt zzzt!

However, the Taoist's power accurately targeted Taisan, who was trying to dodge.

The golden aura on his body quickly spread and turned into gold.

In the direct faith of the earth, holy power can be recovered infinitely, but the amount that can be handled at once is fixed. If the opponent's strength exceeds that amount, even holy power cannot block it.

[You have activated the spell stacking.] [You have activated the shield of white runes.]
Here is the translation of the text:

By stacking defensive magic, I was able to break free. However, I still couldn't withstand it. The power that destroys everything pierced through the defense and reached the Mountain Lord.

[Your second attack has been completely nullified.]

It consumes all the energy.

However, I've obtained some general information.

‘I cannot escape.’

Although I don't know the reason, the saint's power was precisely aimed at the Mountain Lord.

It wasn't just a hit, but rather moving in that direction. At least, there was no way for me to escape from the Mountain Lord's current state.

Furthermore, trying to block the power of destruction was also futile. The opponent is an immortal being, clearly a existence of a high level, making it impossible to defend.

What response method is there? The Mountain Lord quickly came to a conclusion.

I will collide with it head-on, using my strength to shatter it.

The saint's four arms moved. The Mountain Lord gathered power.

[You have activated the summons of destruction.]

The power of destruction is pouring out. It collides with the power of destruction that was about to crush the Mountain Lord.

Kiiiiik!

But even the power of destruction fails to reach. A thick and deep aura is destroyed and dissipated.

The Mountain Lord gathered even more power.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You have ignited the spark of calamity."

"You have ignited the light of the world."

Light and flames burst forth. The Great Mountain has also continuously launched magic and dark magic. The space began to distort due to the collision of powerful forces.

Zzz... zzz...

The crumbling force barely reached the Great Mountain and shattered.

The apostle was not consuming any energy in his attacks, unlike the Great Mountain, which was exhausting its mana and magic to use the Call of Destruction, the Spark of Calamity, and the Light of the World. As a result, it was inevitable that the Great Mountain would eventually succumb to its lack of endurance.

"I don't want to use it yet, but..."

"You have partially changed the world."

The laws of the world begin to change. The world becomes unfavorable to the apostle and favorable to the Great Mountain.

The apostle has joined his hands into a seal with four fingers.

Kkki... ki... ki!

The laws of the world are distorted.

The world that was covered by the partial world change is twisted and distorted. The laws are colliding.

The apostle is once again controlling the power of crumbling. The Great Mountain is calling upon its mana and magic.

Kuu... uuu... uuu!

The forces collide and the world is torn apart.

"Ah!"

"Great Mountain, sir!"
Here is the translation of the text:

The players of the Three Kingdoms fervently prayed towards Taishan. Even Russian players began to join in, following their example.

However, India was different.

They were praying to a sage instead of Taishan.

"Oh, Lord Shiva! Have mercy on us! Have mercy on us! Please show us mercy!"

"Don't abandon us, Lord Shiva!"

They still believed in Hinduism.

And now, the sage's appearance was very similar to the mythical appearance of Shiva.

As a result, they began to believe that the sage was the incarnation of Shiva, and that he had come to destroy them.

As a result, they began to worship the sage with fear. And the worship they offered to the sage made him even stronger. The Taishan, which had created a parallel world through partial world transformation, began to be pushed back slightly.

Mary quietly watched over them.

Then, one existence appeared before her.

[Oh, Lord...][What a pitiful child, what have you come for?]

The ghost grasped its determination.

[Please help Taishan, great Lord...][Hmm...].
Here is the translation of the text:

The voice was hoarse and mournful. The ghost tensed up.

To ask for something without permission from God? It was only natural that a wicked God would destroy him immediately.

However, the ghost did not back down.

Maria looked at him for a moment and muttered to herself.

"[Why are you begging him to help you?] ...He's going to lose, anyway."

Tae-san had won many battles that were considered unwinnable.

But this time was different.

"[The opponent is an immortal.]"

Immortal.

Someone who has transcended mortality.

Although Tae-san could reach immortality, it was a limited power with conditions attached. As long as he could withstand the opponent, it was possible, but the longer the battle lasted, Tae-san's defeat was inevitable.

"[He has won against an immortal before, but that was because the opponent was in a state of madness and lacked reason and intelligence. But this time is different.]"

The apostle was in the position of a true immortal.

Although the power was amplified to the extent that it could handle the strength of the immortal, the immortal was still an immortal. Even with amplified power, a mortal could not approach immortality.
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan will ultimately lose to the sage. That was an irreversible result.

[If you were Taesan, I could help you win. The sage's descent is a sign that you too have been granted the same influence, after all.] [I won't deny it. It's true, but why should I do so?]

Maria smiled brightly.

The ghost swallowed his saliva.

God demands equal recompense from a mortal who has yet to fulfill their wish.

The ghost steeled himself.

[I will surrender myself.] [That's not an appealing offer, by the way. You are of great value to me......] [It's a literal meaning. I will surrender everything.]

Maria's words trailed off.

A quiet voice echoed in the silence.

[Do you understand what that means? Giving yourself means that you will cease to exist as a being. Your wishes will never come true.] [I understand.]

The ghost replied calmly, with an air of having accepted everything and come to a conclusion.

Maria gazed at the ghost for a moment, muttering to herself.
Here is the translation of the text:

[That's your choice, isn't it?] [Yes?] [It's a story from later. Will you help him?] [……Yes.] [I'm sorry, but I refuse.] [Yes?]

The ghost was startled.

[You wouldn't want him to die, would you? Maybe I'll just... ] [You're mistaken about something. You don't need my help.] [But.] [Wait and see, then you'll understand.]

Maria spoke calmly. The ghost couldn't say another word, stunned by Maria's confident words.

* * *

“Oooo..."

“Ah..."

The Indians were praying to their gods.

They were begging to be saved from the existence that was trying to kill them.

Only Ooroo was calm and rational about the situation.

"What should we do to change this situation?"

He couldn't be involved in the battle ahead. This was a battle that exceeded his understanding and comprehension.

He couldn't just sit idly by. He had to find a way to change the situation.

After thinking and thinking, Ooroo found a way.

The golden light of the Taesan.

Note: The story seems to be a continuation of a previous narrative, and some context may be missing. The translation is done to the best of my abilities, but some parts may be unclear or open to interpretation.
Here is the translation of the text:

He didn't know what it was at all. It was a power that was too high-level for him to understand.

However, he knew that it was a power related to worship and faith that could be achieved through belief.

Worship and faith.

Hasan looked at the players of the three kingdoms. They were sending prayers to the Taesan.

"......"

He couldn't be sure. It was a divine power that could be obtained through worship. It was really like something divine.

But there was a possibility.

Hasan, who was convinced that this was something he could do, quickly gathered his thoughts and opened his mouth.

[Hasan activated his war cry.]

"Focus your minds!"

A thunderous voice echoed. The people who were sending prayers to the gods suddenly focused their minds.

Hasan shouted with a distorted face.

"That's not our god!"

"Huh, but..."

"I know too! The god of destruction. He resembles Shiva! But we've all seen it!"

Hasan pointed at the gods with his finger.

"That's constantly changing its form! It's transforming into the form of the god we believe in, deceiving us!"

Whether it was true or not, Hasan didn't know.
Here is the translation of the text:

He was simply spreading what he believed was true. But that was enough. The fear that had covered people's faces was slowly disappearing.

"'This is trying to kill us! So, we must believe in a different existence!'"

Ku-ku-ku-ku!

The sound burst out.

People's gazes converged on Taesan.

"He's fighting for us! He's protecting us against the existence we believed was Shiba, the god!'"

"Oh, oh, oh..."

The space was distorted, and everything collapsed. Everything in sight was collapsing due to the aftermath of the battle.

Amidst this, Taesan was fighting alone against the apostle.

His power was unlike that of a human.

It was like that of a god.

Hassan whispered quietly.

"The non-existent god will not protect us. The real existence that protects us is reality. Now, you all know who we should believe in."

From then on, people no longer looked at the apostle. Everyone's gaze was fixed on Taesan.

* * *

Taesan, who was continuing to fight against the apostle, realized something.

At some point, his faith in himself had become stronger and stronger.
Here is the translation of the text:

As some Indian devotees looked up at him, praying, Dae-do's attack was halted, and his gaze shifted.

"This is it."

His faith was growing stronger, and the realm beyond was drawing closer.

Indian faith was still weak, and not many people were praying.

To strengthen their faith and make more people believe in him, there was a simple method.

Ka-ka-ka!

The power of destruction was unleashed. Gold sparks flew through the space.

The duration of the partial world transformation was almost over. He had fully grasped the power of the Lord through the battles so far.

It was time to make the decisive move.

Tae-san infused his body with power. As Dae-do's hand moved, the power of destruction enveloped Tae-san.

Tae-san did not respond.

[Your third attack was nullified.]

Time was turned back.

And Tae-san moved.

[You have activated the power beyond the boundary.] [You have activated the eternal flame.] [You have activated forced amplification.]

The phoenix was realized in the world. The flames surrounding him enveloped the surroundings. Dae-do moved his four arms to control the power of destruction.
Here is the translation:

In the midst of conflicting powers, Taesan activated another skill.

[You have activated eternal faith.] [You have activated mental burden substitution.]

The momentary gap allows for transcendence of mortality.

Taesan grasped the sword and charged forward. The duration of eternal faith was extremely short. It had to end before that.

Divinity is spread. A golden light envelops everything in a crumbling world. People wail.

The apostle clasped his hands together like yours.

At the same time, an unparalleled pressure overwhelmed Taesan, surpassing everything that had come before.

That power is a force that distorts the very concept, a being within the law that cannot be handled.

However, Taesan charged forward even more fiercely.

Taesan's golden light was covered in black and created a dull gray color.

Taesan wielded the dull gray color. The pressure cracked open, revealing the path to the apostle.

Taesan, who had charged forward, poured everything into the sword. The apostle roughly waved his four arms.

Kuku... ...

A light that seemed to signal the end of the world enveloped people. Maria's barrier shook for a moment.
Here is the translation of the text:

When everything had settled and people's vision returned, Tai Shan stood upright as usual.

However, it was only superficially unharmed.

[Your last chance has been triggered.] [You have taken @#!!! damage.] [Your endurance has been triggered.]

Despite blocking with the last chance, endurance was triggered solely due to the aftermath. It was because he had forcibly controlled the unstoppable power with eternal faith that had led to this incident.

The duration of the partial world change had ended.

Eternal faith was the same.

Tai Shan gazed at the sage.

"Did I not kill you?"

The sage did not fall. He had used the mighty power of the gods to hold on until the end.

Two of his four arms had flown away, and his lower body was also half-destroyed, but he was still alive.

There was no longer any hope for Tai Shan.

But this was enough.

"Oh, oh..."

Everything had settled, and what people saw was Tai Shan standing upright, with the sage half-destroyed.

It was a very dramatic scene. The absolute being that they had believed was the destroyer of the world was destroyed by Tai Shan. People's faith suddenly exploded.

It was an overwhelming faith in life.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The faith sent by all life on the continent, which occupies a part of the vast world, has reached the extent of being as clear as seeing with one's own eyes.

At the same time, the dignity of the peak has transcended mortality.

It has reached a state that could only be achieved limitedly and imperfectly in the past. A qualitatively different sensation has enveloped the entire body.

This was a state that transcended mortality.

[The proficiency of divine power has increased by 3%. You have obtained [Immortality]]."
