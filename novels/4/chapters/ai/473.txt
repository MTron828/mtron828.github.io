Chapter 474

474. 89th Floor, Gosin's Outpost (7)

[Did you get it?]

Tae-san nodded in response to Bardray's question, and Bardray let out a dry laugh.

[How many of Gosin's powers have you obtained now?]

"Two, excluding the black one."

Self-immolation and time interference.

All of these powers were obtained in a short period of time. Bardray let out a sigh.

"It's good that you've become stronger, but... there are too many uncertain factors to be happy about. Honestly, I don't know how the gods will react.]

Gosin's powers are something that shakes the laws of this world.

Tae-san was becoming increasingly close to Gosin, and even if the transcendent beings who favored him protected him, it wasn't unusual for there to be those who would intervene, thinking like the god of death.

"Hmm."

Tae-san was also thinking about that part. But it wasn't something he could control, and he wasn't too worried about it.

"Lord Zelvand said he would help us too."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It doesn't mean that I'm creating a trial that's suitable for my level.

[They might do it for me... but I'm still worried.]

Bardley's tail was drooping. Taesan shook his head.

"It's a problem that can be thought about later. Let's focus on what needs to be done now."

It was time for him to confirm what he had obtained.

Perhaps because he had pierced the possibility itself head-on, he had acquired a skill after a long time.

[Special Activation Skill: Possibility Denial] [Proficiency: 1%] [Mana Consumption: 1000] [Your next attack will exclude the possibility of not leading to victory. The number of possibilities that can be excluded is not that many. This skill has a one-hour cooldown after activation.]

The effect of Possibility Denial was similar to the power of possibility that Paradise had wielded.

Although the effect itself was somewhat weakened and lacking, it was still a highly unusual and powerful skill that couldn't be denied. Taesan was satisfied.

And it was the skill he had aimed for from the beginning. The power of Goshin."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Transcendence: Time Interference] [Proficiency:!@] [Consumption??? :???] [Time-related %^$#. You are the center ^%&***. Also!%뷁쉑읽붥.]

As always, the skill description was broken and couldn't be read properly.

However, he had already figured out how to use his powers through his intuition and the battle with Paradise. It was time to experiment with its effects and applications directly.

There were still many underlings left in the enemy's outpost. They knew they couldn't help with their own strength, so they watched the battle between Taesan and the Divine Body from a distance. When the Divine Body was defeated, they fled in a hurry.

His goal was to clean up the outpost.

There was no reason to spare their lives.

Taesan stretched out his hand into the air.

[You have activated Teleportation.]

His body jumped through the air. The figure of an underling desperately fleeing appeared before him.

"Whoa!"

The underling was shocked by Taesan's sudden appearance and reflexively swung his sword.

And Taesan could see it.

The sword, which was approaching him, was slowing down.

Taesan, who was gazing at it calmly, lightly moved his foot. The sword was stuck in the ground.

"Huh?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The servant also seemed to have realized that they had slowed down, as their pupils had dilated.

Taesan didn't counterattack.

As if to say "Let's try it once," he spread his arms wide.

Fear crept onto the servant's face.

"U, uaaah!"

The sword flashed, and the servant tried to use the authority they had received to take down Taesan.

But it didn't reach him. Taesan was able to dodge everything just by moving his body.

Although he was overwhelmingly stronger than the servant, it wasn't to the point where he could perfectly evade attacks like this.

It was thanks to the newly acquired time interference authority.

Taesan kept his distance from the servant, then closed in again, repeating this process to perfectly grasp the range and effects of the authority.

As a result, he was able to understand it to some extent.

The basic principle was the same as when Paradise controlled it. It could influence a certain range around Taesan, and the closer you got to Taesan, the slower time flowed.

The range was about half of Paradise's.

And when you got close, time slowed down by about 20%.

"Quite impressive."

Taesan was extremely satisfied.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Thinking about what Paradise had done, it was relatively lacking. When Paradise reached its limit, it could slow down the speed of Taesan to a normal human level.

But 20% was not a small number. In close combat, Taesan could always move 20% faster without any restrictions or consumption.

Since it was slowing down the time itself, not just the designated opponent, it was much easier to respond to projectiles or spatial leaps.

Taesan focused his mind for a moment. The slowed-down time suddenly returned to normal. Taesan had forcibly stopped the time interference.

"I can control it too. It's great."

Taesan hummed in excitement.

There was one more effect he wanted to confirm, but it was impossible for now. The consumed black energy had not fully recovered.

So, he decided to test another skill.

He drew his sword and charged at the struggling underling.

[You have activated the possibility denial.]

He swung his sword.

The speed was not that fast. If the underling focused, they could easily block it. In fact, the underling quickly opened their eyes and concentrated on defense.

But the sword twisted.

Taesan realized it."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The sword he wielded was constantly being rewritten on a path that the lowly servant couldn't block.

Kwajik.

"Kueok!"

In the end, the lowly servant couldn't stop it. He spat out blood and collapsed.

"This needs to be tested further."

It was a skill that couldn't be understood with just one use.

Fortunately, there were many opponents in this place who could test his abilities. Taesan would find and attack the lowly servants who were hiding and running away every time the cooldown ended.

After experimenting for a day, he was able to get a rough understanding.

The power of Paradise was to turn back time and forcibly find the correct answer, whereas the probability denial was to modify and change the path in real-time. The difference was in the method, but the goal of finding a specific result was similar.

Unlike Paradise, there was no need to be fixated on a specific weapon, but the amount of possibilities being modified wasn't that great either.

The number of times Paradise's bullets rotated was countless, but the probability denial could only modify around ten possibilities at most.

"That's enough, though."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Repeating the same situation ten times to modify it was something that could change the outcome in a battle against an equal opponent. It was not a low-value skill by any means.

Taesan was satisfied with the effect of negating possibilities. This was enough to be called a main skill.

Now, there was only one effect left to confirm.

As time passed, the boundary line was fully charged. It wasn't perfect, but it was enough to test.

Taesan activated teleportation and approached the hidden servant. The servant was shocked and manifested their power.

Taesan pulled out the black energy. He contained the black energy that had gathered to its limit within him and released it as is.

"Stop."

Kiiiiing!

A strange noise spread out along with the shockwave.

At the same time, the world stopped.

The wind trembled. The black energy that permeated the world. The servant who wielded their power to attack.

Within a certain range centered around Taesan. Time itself had stopped.

[This is unbelievable.] [Master... this is.]

"Ha."

Taesan burst out laughing.

He could now bring out the effect of temporary time stop with his own abilities.

"Good."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan thrust his sword into the chest of the exhausted warrior. At the same time, time began to freeze.

"What?"

The warrior's eyes widened in surprise.

"What, what's...?"

He died without understanding what was happening.

The effects of time interference were two-fold.

One was a passive effect, interfering with the flow of time around him. The closer you got to him, the slower time moved, and it didn't consume any additional energy.

The other was a skill that consumed black energy to activate, freezing time in the surrounding area.

The effect itself was similar to a simple time freeze, but the details were significantly different.

"I wonder if this would work on a high-ranking noble too."

The skills of the labyrinth were ineffective against high-ranking nobles. Just looking at how various skills didn't work properly against the seventh fragment of the World Destroyer, it was clear that even if he obtained a simple time freeze now, it would be of little use. That was why he judged it to be useless.

However, time interference was a power of the nobles.

Depending on Taesan's skill level and strength, it could have a significant impact on even nobles or transcendents. If you compared the levels, it was incomparably high.

However, the drawbacks were also significant.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"To stop time, I had to consume black energy.

It wasn't a small amount, either. Even after using up all the black energy I had collected over the course of a day, the time I was able to stop was only around 10 seconds.

'I won't be able to use it freely.'

Black energy was one of his most important fundamental abilities. It was used in all sorts of ways. Since the amount of black energy consumed to stop time was too great, in actual combat, it seemed like it could only be used for a short 1 or 2 seconds.

'I need to increase my total amount of black energy.'

That was the task he had to tackle immediately.

He had roughly finished checking everything.

Taesan leaped into action. In an instant, he moved and took care of the remaining underlings.

Thud.

"Whoa!"

And in the moment he finished taking care of the last underling...

[Quest Complete.]

The 89th floor quest was over.

Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

[Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [You have obtained the Ring of Eternal Echo, which resonates forever.

[You have obtained ???.]

* * *

Reward confirmation. It was a long-awaited piece of equipment."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Eternal Ring of Echoing Shout] [+2000 Health] [+1000 Mana] [+500 Magic] [+300 Attack Power] [+300 Defense Power] [The echo never ends.] [The power of magic and dark magic increases by 10%.]

It was an extremely simple yet powerful effect. It might apply to evil or holy magic as well, but if it did, it would be a remarkable piece of equipment.

And ???

[Belt of Lawlessness with a Hint of Chaos] [+1000 Strength] [+1000 Agility] [+800 Attack Power] [+500 Defense Power] [A plain belt with no patterns. It's a piece of equipment that only a transcendent being can create, containing something from another world that doesn't belong here.] [Resistance to lawlessness increases slightly.]

"Is this a counter-equipment for gods?"

I don't know what level it's at, but since a transcendent being made it, it must have a decent resistance. It was exactly what Taesan needed.

Then.

I'll head down now.

Balbam didn't appear. It was as if this wasn't his territory, and someone else was in charge here.

Taesan stepped onto the stairs.

The 90th floor. The final floor, signaling a new theme, has begun.
