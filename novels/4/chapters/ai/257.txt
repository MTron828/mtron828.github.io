258. Believers in the Ancient Spirits (Part 3)

Black was the power of the old gods, opposite to the sacred.

Minerva focused on controlling the undulating black, dispersing it in all directions. Those watching from afar were terrified.

[Master?]

"Huh?"

Minerva barely suppressed her reflex to attack.

The power of the old gods moved under Taesan's control.

"Come to think of it, he did mention controlling the power of the old gods."

Minerva muttered in confusion. Taesan had said the grey power was a mix of the sacred and the old gods' powers. At the time, it sounded absurd, but now that she saw it firsthand, it was astonishing.

"But the transcendent ones allowed it to remain like that?"

[It's probably just the power under Taesan's control. Don't worry about it. Is that guy up to something weird?]

"Well, yeah, but..."

Minerva said with a troubled expression. To think that beings in this world could handle the power of the old gods without losing their minds or bodies twisted. It was difficult for Minerva to comprehend with her common sense.
The black color scattered in all directions.

Thus scattered black interfered with the ancient shaman's power that permeated the entire land.

Taesan sensed this.

The dispersed power spreading across the land infiltrated the black, coming under Taesan's control.

Taesan gathered the black imbued with the power of the land and condensed it to its limit.

Boom!

And it exploded.

The concentrated energy scattered in all directions. The dispersed energy once again spread throughout the entire land.

"I can control it, but removing it seems impossible."

Even the black could not interfere within the area.

The power of gods and ancestral spirits. Both were equally impossible.

Then what about a power spanning the boundaries of both?

"Minerva, there's trouble."

"Ah, understood."

Minerva, guessing what Taesan intended, took Anetsha and Quanad and cleared the streets.

"Lady Minerva?"

"It's going to get dangerous from here on. I don't want to get involved in this mess."

[You have triggered sacred power.]

Light manifested above Taesan's hands.

And there, the black color began to coat it.

[You have triggered the black power.]

Sizzle.
The light and darkness mix together and begin to transform into gray. Simultaneously, he begins to rampage as if refusing to control Taesan.

"Is this more manageable than before?"

Skill. Perhaps because he gained the boundary, the energy to explosively engulf Taesan as he did when he first used it was not present.

Of course, it wasn't controlled smoothly. Taesan still seemed to shake as if wanting to escape control.

Taesan wielded the gray light.

The gray light swallowed everything around it.

"Your resilience has been triggered."

The gray light faded, and Taesan looked around.

He smiled satisfactorily.

"Indeed, this seems to work."

The land was purified.

"If this works here, could it also be possible on Earth?"

The ancient spirits engulfed here were eerily similar to those on Earth.

It could be possible to expel the ancient spirits rooted in Earth and return it to them.

Anetsha, who had been watching from a distance, was astonished.

"Oh, huh?"

The ancient power that had consumed the entire land.

The moment those powers touched the gray light, they were cleanly and neatly erased.

It wasn't simply pushed away by the force's ripple or temporarily concealed; they were literally erased.
Here's the translation of the text you provided:

"Upon entering this abandoned land, the twisted beings dwelling within knew that their imprisoned souls would be liberated.

Minerva clicked her tongue.

'Such unbelievable power.'

The abandoned land was infused with ancient magic. It was a realm even the gods could not easily influence.

Yet a mortal like Taesan cleanly erased that power.

A mortal doing what even transcendental beings could not. A mortal interfering with the power of the transcendent.

It was a deeply paradoxical statement.

* * *

They found a way.

If they wielded the power of gray, they could erase the domain of the spirits.

But it was not something they could resolve immediately.

'The scope is too narrow.'

The area erasable with gray was no larger than a single sports field. It wasn't small, but the expanse of the abandoned land was immeasurable.

Simply erasing the area was not enough. They needed a fundamental solution.

And related information came from the man he had detained.

'Thorn. And the saint who guards it.'
If you are a saint, you're probably talking about an ancient saint. The fact that such a being exists here meant something.

And the thorn that such a being guards could be very important here.

The destination was set.

Of course, there were still issues.

The abandoned land was extraordinarily vast. It was clear that it would take considerable time just to determine where the thorn was located.

But it would be much faster than randomly erasing without purpose.

"Well then, let's go around. Anetsha."

Those who had resided here for an incalculable amount of time likely knew the thorn's location.

"Yes."

Anetsha calmly raised her finger.

"When I sensed it earlier, I felt several presences far away."

"The distance?"

"Um... it's about a day's journey on foot for me."

"That's quite far."

Taisan began to move.

Quietly moving, they began to discuss what they were curious about.

"Heh."

Minerva's eyes gleamed.

She was now listening to Quenad talk about the labyrinth.

"Such strong mortals. They could be stronger than me, right?"
Quanet spoke to Minerva about the Guide Corps. Most of them said they were stronger than Minerva.

"Indeed, the Labyrinth is an interesting place."

"Yes. Well, I was defeated midway."

Quanet replied.

"Among them, there was a being similar to you."

"Hmm."

"He was the Spirit King of Fire. His name was probably Vishnu."

"Vishnu, huh."

"Do you know who he is?"

"I know."

Minerva waved her finger.

"He's quite a famous figure in the spirit realm."

She hummed.

"One who refused the responsibility of the Spirit King. One who wanted to surpass the limits of the Spirit King, transcend lifespan, and become solitary."

A chill passed through her eyes.

"The Spirit King who caused the destruction of one world and fled. Hmm. And she's in the Labyrinth."

Minerva chuckled.

"How intriguing."

"...It seems not all spirits get along well, after all."
"Sure, that's right. There are indeed spirits who dislike entering mazes. I'm not quite like that, but... It's different when it comes to the Spirit King. My master reigns supreme there, atop Mount Taesan. If it's his adversary, we might end up fighting."

The Battle of the Spirit King.

Upon hearing this, Quanad chuckled dryly.

"Sounds intriguing. Though I won't witness it firsthand."

"I only follow my master's orders. Even if the opponent is a king, nothing changes."

"I'm looking forward to it. Wonder when it will happen."

They exchanged quiet words.

And Taesan had his own thoughts.

'It was greed.'

The gaze of the ancient when he set foot on this land.

The light in that gaze wasn't of an enemy or anger, but of greed.

That was quite unexpected. For an ancient to show greed meant there was something they desired.

Throughout the conflicts with the ancients, they had shown enmity or curiosity, but never greed.

As exiles transcendent from birth, why would they show greed to Taesan?

"Lord Taesan."

Anetsha asked him as he pondered.

"Shall we investigate again?"
The mountain nodded. They had moved enough. The opponents must have moved as well, so they needed to reassess their positions. Anetsha struck the ground with her staff. Magic spread in all directions from the staff.

Surrounding information flowed into Anetsha.

She began to organize each piece of information.

"...Hm?"

Anetsha's face stiffened.

"Uh, what?"

"Why are you like that?"

Quaned asked with a puzzled expression. Anetsha's face turned pale.

"Huh? What's wrong?"

Taesan, sensing something odd, gathered magic.

"You have activated the detection of Lerazie's territory."

A black wave spread out, bringing information from the surroundings to Taesan. And Taesan could also understand.

That there were those coming toward them.

And their number was in the hundreds.

"Hm?"

Minerva also seemed to sense it as her face stiffened. Taesan drew his weapon.

Those approaching began to show themselves.

Twisted endlessly, they looked at Taesan and shouted.

"There he is!"

Hundreds of twisted beings shouted.

"For the old master!"

"Seize him!" 

---

Hundreds of twisted demons.
Here's the translation of the text:

"Even the weakest among them had reached the mid-levels of the labyrinth, around the twentieth floor. Occasionally, there were those capable of reaching even the fortieth floor."

"No way. How on earth?"

Anetsha was perplexed. It wasn't for no reason that so many had gathered in one place. It meant everyone knew Tae-san was here.

"Minerva. Barkaja. Take care of Quadra and Anetsha."

[Understood.]

Barkaja applauded. Ignorance overflowed and the wind materialized in Minerva's hand.

Tae-san stamped his foot.

The faces of the crazed were instantly near.

"Capture them!"

"Suppress them!"

Tae-san's sword moved. Twisted demons tried to block but were shattered as shields.

[Your spiritual rise has been triggered.]

Spiritual rise messages appear one after another. Tae-san switched off the system window in a sight-shielding window.

It slipped past, avoiding stretching hands and rolling feet.

He got shoulder punches with all his strength. A high-pitched distorted demon front disappears.

The departed who cannot be resurrected.

Soul is out of scattered flesh.


However, the twisted demons charging forward showed no fear.

With faces filled only with madness, they attempted to grasp Tasan.

Kwaaang!

A gust of wind erupted from behind. Minerva swung the wind, freeing herself from the charging demons.

The demons paid no attention to her.

They only had eyes for Tasan, charging towards him as if he were their sole objective.

From Tasan's perspective, this suited him fine. Ignoring everyone else and focusing solely on the battle.

Kwajik.

Swords swung.

He dodged attacks by moving his whole body, crushing heads, and evading swinging attacks.

"You triggered the Frozen World."

Jezjezjezjezjezjezjezjez!

Cold surged. The nearby demons froze in an instant.

Among them, a familiar face.

"I spared your life once. And you return."

"Heuk. Heuk..."

It was one of the twisted demons he had spared in exchange for information.

Half of his limbs frozen stiff, he shivered from the cold.

Looking towards Tasan, he shouted in anger.

"Human! Our great beings summon you!"
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"Are you talking about the ancient master?"

"Yes! He spoke through the lips of a saint! He said, 'Bring him to me! To the one who brings you, I will give the opportunity to become his apostle!'"

"He didn't say to kill me, but to bring me in."

He wanted something from him. Goshin did.

Thud, thud!

"Open the way!"

The ice began to break. Taesan raised his hand to the head of the twisted demon.

"There is no second chance."

There was no fear on the twisted demon's face. It only shouted with endless obsession.

"O great one! Grant me your grace!"

That was his last will. In the breaking ice, Taesan raised his magic staff.

The passage opens.

He feels the gaze of the demon on the other side.

He releases his power as it is.

"You have activated Marbas's Black Tide."

The black tide flows forth. The waves rushing out of the open passage were no longer just waves; they were like a tidal wave.

Breaking the ice, it overwhelms and engulfs all beings around. The dense black energy crushes everything in all directions.
"Kuuuuung!

Thousands of twisted demons filled with madness swallow everything in their path. Some have reached the level of the 40th floor of the labyrinth, but it means nothing. The devil's waves crush those who once believed in the ancient magic.

Hundreds of demons disappear like that.

"As expected, it's become useful."

Marbas's black waves were among the strongest black magic learned by Taesan. Opening a passage, they drew proper power, which was incredibly potent.

Minerva returned, her face twisted.

"It's not about killing them or bringing them back alive. What do you want?"

"...Did the ancient magic give a prophecy?"

Anetsha muttered with a troubled expression.

"That's impossible... This is the demon realm. It's the domain of the devil, not the ancient magic. Even if this place is the territory of the ancient magic, the master of the world is the devil. Interfering with a prophecy, even in a very small form, is impossible..."

"It must mean they paid enough."

In other words, it also meant there was enough value to risk holding Taesan.

"Anetsha, try using the staff again."
Here's the translation of the text:

Taesan placed his hand on her shoulder. Anetsha calmly tapped the ground with her staff.

"Umm."

Ripples spread out. In harmony with Taesan's magic, a wide range of information flowed in.

"...This is..."

Anetsha quietly let out a groan.

"The distorted demons... are approaching us accurately."

"Seems like it."

The prophecy of the ancient shaman. It wouldn't end with just a few hundred. Perhaps it spread across the abandoned lands. It eventually revealed the appearance of the distorted demons.

"Ho, hoho."

Kwaned drew his sword with a grimace.

Demons were rushing from all directions.

And the end was not in sight.

"It's them!"

"Capture them!"

Those who believed in the ancient shaman shouted.

"For our god!"
