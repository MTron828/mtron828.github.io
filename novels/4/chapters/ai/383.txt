**Chapter 384**

**384. The Sixth Return, Earth (2)**

The realm created by the golden light, which had collapsed, began to manifest in the world, centered around the fallen heavens.

"Oooo..."

People instinctively felt it. That place was a realm created by Taesan, and the golden light would protect them.

People shouted Taesan's name and sent strong worship. Their faith became the foundation that maintained the sacred land.

"Hmm."

At the same time, Taesan realized something.

His own strength, which had been stuck at the boundary, was now peeking out beyond the boundary.

"I can reach it faster than I thought."

Taesan went to find Kim Hwi-yeon again. She was in a state of great shock after seeing the sacred land that Taesan had created.

"Mr. Taesan! What is that?"

"A sacred land."

"A sacred land?"

"Ordinary monsters can't invade the sacred land. And inside, injuries will heal quickly. I'll also block any mental interference."

"How long will it last?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not there. As long as you worship me unchangingly, I'll be there forever."

"......I guess you're a real god now."

Kim Hwi-yeon muttered to himself in amazement. He knew that Taesan had extraordinary powers, but he never thought he could create a holy land.

"Anyway, let's get organized. If people are coming from all over Asia, which countries will come?"

"Ah, yes."

Kim Hwi-yeon opened his mouth with a calm face.

"According to the results we checked in the community, the countries that will gather here are mainly India and Russia."

In the previous return, Korea, China, and Japan gathered in one place.

Other countries were the same. Russia and Mongolia gathered on the Russian side, and the rest of the countries gathered in India.

"It's convenient not to worry about the details."

"What are you going to do, Mr. Taesan?"

This was a question asking if he would help them find their way as he had done until now. Taesan shook his head.

"I won't help. You'll arrive without any problems."

The crack in the sky was very quiet. Taesan realized that it was the calm before the storm.

The gods were gathering their power to kill Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In that situation, it was pointless to waste energy targeting players from other countries. From Go Shin's perspective, everyone except Taesan was nothing but insignificant dust.

Taesan judged that even if they didn't interfere, they would arrive without any issues.

"Isn't there something better to do? Won't we at least get a billion units?"

"That's... probably true?"

"Then where are we going to accommodate all those people?"

"That's also a problem."

Even now, there were many people sleeping on the streets because of overcrowding. In that situation, finding space for the growing population was a task in itself.

"Is it difficult to expand the sacred land?"

"It's impossible. The sacred land has a limited size."

As the sacred land grew in size, the divine power consumed increased exponentially. Considering the people's faith, the limit was about twice the size of the sky and earth.

Taesan stood up from his seat.

"There's no need to think too hard about it. Let's just open up a moderate amount of land."

"...I don't think that's moderate," Kim Hwi-yeon said hesitantly.

Taesan entered the sacred land he had created.

The sacred land was formed with the sky and earth at its center."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

During the battle with the monster, Baekdu Mountain collapsed. The remaining debris occupied the space.

It's not difficult to clean up the mess and restore it to its original state.

It's not hard. The sacred land is his domain. What he desires is fulfilled.

He declares his will.

"Return."

[You have activated the Declaration of Rebirth.]

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

"Uh, uh, uh?"

The people who were resting in the sacred land were shocked and got up. The ground began to shake.

"Uaaaah!"

People were caught off guard and rushed out of Baekdu Mountain. They stared blankly at the mountain.

Ku-gu-gu-gungâ€¦.

The cliffs rose, and the scattered water droplets floated in mid-air. Trees grew, and various colors began to appear in the space.

The collapsed Baekdu Mountain was reviving.

The tremors subsided, and people were left speechless.

The completely destroyed Baekdu Mountain, which had lost its mountainous shape, had regained its original form.

When people climbed to the top of Baekdu Mountain, the sky and earth were restored to their original state.

"......Lord."

Someone murmured in a voice like a sigh.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan had organized not only the sacred site but also other places behind it.

It wasn't difficult. With the contract with the Spirit King, Taesan could exert absolute influence over nature. And with the divine command, it was easy to transform the entire land.

In an instant, all obstacles blocking the view disappeared.

A vast space that could accommodate millions of people was prepared.

People didn't cheer or applaud.

They simply knelt quietly and offered a prayer to Taesan. A pure and unadulterated faith settled in Taesan's entire body.

Time passed, and they came.

* * *

"I'm here."

"Heh. Heh."

Taesan stopped his sword. Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk stumbled and sat down.

Taesan was looking in the distance. The two, who had barely caught their breath, turned their gaze in the direction Taesan was looking.

"......There's nothing, right?"

"It's outside your field of vision. Tell Kim Hwi-yeon to come soon and prepare."

"Yes......"

Lee Tae-yeon stumbled as he got up and headed towards Kim Hwi-yeon.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It wasn't long before Kim Hwi-yeon and other high-ranking players had tense faces as they looked in the direction Taesan had indicated.

Soon, they too could see that their opponents were approaching.

"What's going on? There are so many of them!"

"Just wait a minute. How many are there?"

People were stunned. They couldn't even count the number. It was literally endless.

Even when they first met the Chinese team, they were overwhelmed by the number, but this time it was even more.

People waited with tense faces as the opponents approached.

As the opponents drew near, they stopped at a certain distance.

"...What's going on?"

Kim Hwi-yeon's eyes wavered.

The opponents were setting up camp, keeping their distance from them.

"Why are they doing this?"

It was a very strange situation. They were survivors of a destroyed world, and while they might fight and conflict with each other for their own gain, they had never kept their distance like this before.

But this time, it seemed like they didn't even want to make contact, setting up camp far away.

This made Kim Hwi-yeon uneasy as well. He couldn't understand what the opponents were thinking.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

When I couldn't make a decision and was wavering, a person from the other side came to find me.

He was a man who seemed somehow weak. He approached me quietly and opened his mouth.

"I am Kamal Hasan, the leader of the Asian Union, a solo player from India."

"The Asian Union?"

"My country. It's a group centered around India, and we don't have a proper name, so we call it that."

Hasan said that and closed his mouth. Kim Hwi-yeon regained his composure and opened his mouth.

"I am the leader of Korea. My name is Kim Hwi-yeon."

"Nice to meet you. Are you the leader of this group?"

"For now, that's the situation."

Hasan looked behind Kim Hwi-yeon.

There was a golden palace built there.

Hasan's eyes trembled.

"Is that... did you make it?"

"No? No, that was made by Gang Tae-san, who is on our side."

"Gang Tae-san..."

Hasan looked at Tae-san.

He was thinking about something alone, and then he opened his mouth.

"I came to talk to you. Is that okay?"

"Of course."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Kim Hwi-yeon nodded his head greatly. In a situation where the other side was keeping their distance, unsure of what to do, the leader had arrived. Kim Hwi-yeon was thinking of somehow extracting information.

"Can you tell us why you're keeping your distance from us? It would be better for us to join forces when the monster appears in the future, don't you think...?"

"I think so too."

Hasan smiled wryly.

"But there are people who refuse to do so. It's a situation I can't control."

"What?"

Kim Hwi-yeon was taken aback by Hasan's words.

"You're the leader, aren't you? But you're saying you can't force them because some people refuse? What kind of talk is that?"

If everyone was opposed, that would be one thing, but if only some people were opposed, the leader should be able to assert their authority. Kim Hwi-yeon couldn't understand.

"......I don't have the power to do so."

Hasan closed his mouth with a gloomy expression. Kim Hwi-yeon tried to ask further, but Hasan didn't respond anymore.

Kim Hwi-yeon took Hasan to the holy site. The people who saw Taesan knelt down and prayed.

Hasan, who watched their behavior, opened his mouth.

"It seems that all of these people worship Taesan like the community's words say."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's right. Taesan saved us, so we're grateful. If Taesan wasn't there, we wouldn't have made it."

It wasn't an exaggeration. The monsters that appeared were ones that they couldn't handle. If Taesan hadn't fought them, there wouldn't be any living beings on this land.

But Hasan was taken aback by those words.

He looked at Kim Hwi-yeon.

"Are you a hard mode player? How many floors have you reached?"

"I just reached the 70th floor."

Hasan's pupils widened.

"The 70th floor?"

"Why are you so surprised?"

Kim Hwi-yeon tilted her head. She didn't think it was that surprising, as there were many other hard mode players who had reached the same floor as her.

But Hasan was acting as if he had heard an impossible feat.

Hasan tried to compose himself and asked again.

"Is Taesan a solo mode player, by any chance? Maybe around...?"

"What floor was he on? I heard he was on the 77th floor last time."

"78th floor."

"Wow, you're really fast."

Kim Hwi-yeon let out a sigh of admiration. But Hasan's reaction was even more extreme. His eyes widened to an alarming size.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"78th floor...?"

"Why are you like that?"

Kim Hwi-yeon tilted his head. Hasan couldn't close his mouth.

"How on earth... how did you get that far..."

"It's not just Taesan. Players like Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Jun-hyeok are also clearing the alone mode at an incredible speed."

"Are those two...?"

"Maybe around the mid-40s? They'll probably get there."

Hasan was speechless.

"What is this...?"

He had already entered the early 40s of the alone mode.

And other hard mode players from India were just entering the 60s. The gap was overwhelming.

"...Would we have been wiped out if it weren't for Kang Taesan?"

"What's wrong?"

Fear flashed across Hasan's face for a moment. Kim Hwi-yeon asked cautiously. Hasan hastily managed his expression.

"No."

Kim Hwi-yeon was bewildered by Hasan's incomprehensible reaction. He couldn't understand what Hasan was thinking.

"We're here."

Kim Hwi-yeon led Hasan to the front of the holy land.

Hasan, who was staring blankly at the golden realm, asked.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Can I go in once?"

"Do as you please."

Taesan replied. Hasan stepped into the sacred ground.

"Ah."

Hasan let out an unconscious sigh.

The golden energy enveloped his entire body. A sense of fullness he had never felt before surged, and his mental fatigue completely disappeared.

"This is...â€¦.

A power that didn't feel human.

Hasan stared blankly at Taesan.

* * *

"What's going on?"

Kim Hwi-yeon grumbled.

Hasan remained still, his face shocked, and then quietly left. Kim Hwi-yeon tried to grab him, but it was no use.

It was impossible to know what the other person was thinking or what they wanted.

"Do you plan to cooperate with us? Or not?"

"You'll find out soon enough."

Taesan said calmly.

Before long, the Russian and Mongolian players arrived. Unlike the Indian players, they didn't keep their distance.

However, their gazes weren't exactly friendly either.

It was hard to tell exactly before having a detailed conversation, but somehow, a sense of disdain and contempt towards them was palpable.
