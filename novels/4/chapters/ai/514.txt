**Episode 515**

515. 94th Floor, Easy Mode (8)

It completely suppresses the distorted thing that resists. And it tries to tear apart the fine details at the boundary. It wants to plunder what's inside and make it its own.

Kagagak!

But it doesn't happen.

It seems like it's not allowed up to this point, as if the enormous rule itself is blocking the way.

And at the same time, the world starts to move.

Until now, the world that had been threatening and growling like a beast can no longer bear it and charges forward to devour. The world itself is the enemy that Taesan cannot withstand.

Quadduduk.

Taesan's body starts to be forcibly pushed back. He tries to resist at the boundary, but even that is meaningless. The enormous thing pushes Taesan back.

"Wait."

But he endures.

"There's still something left to do."

This is a twisted, broken time that no longer exists. Whatever you do here, there's no feedback to the original world.

Then, there was still one thing left to confirm.

[You have activated the Chaos Call.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The boundary's domain surrounds Taesan. The world's own will cannot reach Taesan.

Quadruple impact!

Taesan grasped space and tore it apart.

Blame.

He set foot on the earth.

What's visible is the earth filled with monsters.

And the crack in the sky.

The monsters see Taesan and howl. Tools without complete wisdom, programmed to follow orders, try to kill him.

Taesan didn't even glance at them.

He simply swung his ash-colored [power].

The boundary line becomes a wave and assaults the earth. The monsters crumble to dust in an instant.

Taesan gathered his ash-colored [power] and launched it towards the crack in the sky.

Although he couldn't bring out more than a fraction of his original power due to the world's oppression and hostility, he is still the boundary. The power that destroys all and shakes the boundary touches the crack in the sky.

At that moment.

The crack opens.

Something catches the boundary line that flew towards the crack.

A quiet collision occurs.

There is no sound, no explosion. But in that moment, the world trembles.

Ku-gu-gu-gung….

It sees Taesan.

In an instant, the earth tries to collapse. With a simple gaze, objects crumble and concepts distort.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not a plunderer."

Taesan murmured indifferently.

Something beyond was quietly gazing at Taesan.

Before understanding the emotions contained within, the world had already swallowed Taesan. The thing that could no longer be endured had crossed the boundary and expelled Taesan.

And Taesan returned to his original labyrinth.

"It's settled."

[Oh.] [You're back…….]

Bardley transformed back into his sword form, and Akasha transformed back into her ring form. The world's will to exclude Taesan was no longer felt.

He was back. In his original Alone mode.

Taesan raised his hand. On it was a piece of Uroboros.

The enormous concept and power that had been dormant within had completely disappeared.

It would take a very long time before he could use it again.

But it didn't matter. His goal had been achieved.

[Special Activation Skill: Multiply] [Mana Consumption: 30] [Deals damage squared. This skill has a one-hour cooldown after activation.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Multiplication. The skill remained in the skill window. Taesan laughed. It wasn't just multiplication.

[Special Activation Skill: Forced Arrival] [Mana Consumption: 50] [Proficiency: 1%] [You can forcibly reach your desired goal. However, the goal you can set is limited, and you must take full responsibility for the penalties and risks required to achieve it.]

Forced Arrival was also a skill that Taesan had acquired through his own power. He had obtained a total of two skills and returned.

"This is satisfying enough."

He had obtained what he wanted. Taesan sat down, organizing his thoughts.

"The last one didn't show up, did it?"

Well, if the last one had appeared, he would have immediately suppressed it. In easy mode, the last one didn't exist. It was a part he had somewhat expected.

"Where is that place?"

A distorted and broken space. A mysterious place created by the last one, imitating this world.

Who was the one who created that place? Was it the unknown last one, or the usurper?

The probability was high that it was the usurper, but he couldn't be certain yet.

"And the last one that appeared at the end."

The last one that had pierced the sky's rift and appeared.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Who is that?"

"Ah, it's you."

"The connection was cut off. The space was torn apart, and the wizard appeared."

"Hello?"

"The wizard landed lightly on the ground."

"I'm sorry I couldn't arrive right away. I was a bit busy."

"How long was I on the other side?"

"Not that long. Maybe about a month?"

A month. The flow of time itself didn't seem to be much different. The wizard snapped his fingers.

"So, did you achieve your desired goal?"

A light wave swept over the mountain. It was a confirmation of the skills the mountain possessed, using the authority of the creator of the labyrinth.

"......Yeah."

The wizard, who had confirmed the multiplication, couldn't help but be amazed.

"Taesan, why did I create skills in a way that makes them newly created?"

Skills aren't created from scratch. When certain conditions are met and deemed valid, skills are created.

It's a very troublesome and difficult-to-control condition, but the wizard had insisted on it during the design of the labyrinth.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The reason is simple. I wanted to see people who were willing to put in the effort to get something of their own, and dedicate themselves to it."

They analyze the conditions and calculate to create their own unique skills.

The mage wanted adventurers to use the system, not rely on it.

But most adventurers didn't do that. They just aimed for the skills that the first ones to clear the labyrinth had discovered, and didn't try to create their own.

The mage was very disappointed by this.

And now, Taesan was perfectly fulfilling that disappointment.

Plus, forced duel, attack nullification. And even multiplication.

Even the mage who designed and created the labyrinth couldn't have imagined the multiplication skill.

The mage was extremely satisfied with the result that exceeded their expectations.

"And is this forced arrival? This is another strange skill."

The mage could somehow understand the conditions to obtain forced arrival.

So they couldn't help but laugh.

A system that surpasses the limits of the system. In normal cases, it was a skill that couldn't be obtained at all.

"It might be difficult to use, but depending on how it's utilized, it could also destroy the balance."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The skill was difficult for even a magician to pinpoint. From his perspective, it was satisfying.

The magician, who was enjoying checking his skills, stopped.

"...... For a moment."

The magician scrunched up his face.

There was astonishment on his face.

"What is this?"

The magician snapped his fingers. A system window appeared in his view.

[Special Passive Skill: Damage Physical Force Conversion] [Proficiency: 1%] [You can directly apply physical force to damage, which is proportional to the damage value. It doesn't seem to have a significant effect yet.]

"I've never given anyone a skill like this. And it doesn't seem like a skill you can acquire on your own."

A skill related to the system. It's a type of thing that can't be obtained through individual effort.

A thought flashed through the magician's mind.

"...... Balbabamba."

"It's a skill I received as a reward for clearing the 92nd floor. I thought it was worthless, so I gave it to you casually."

"This is ridiculous."

The magician clicked his tongue.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Barbaric Bomb's judgment was not wrong. Even if you put physical strength into damage, the ratio is pathetic. For most adventurers, it was a skill that meant nothing.

However, the problem was that Taesan possessed that skill.

"This is... troublesome."

What could Taesan do with that skill?

Just thinking about it gave him a headache.

"I already gave you the skill, so I can't do anything about it now. I'll have to scold you later."

The wizard muttered to himself. Taesan apologized to Barbaric Bomb in his heart.

"So, it's not just about getting the skill, right?"

"I roughly figured it out."

Ijiwa and Normal, the creators of the Hard mode, were likely to be usurpers. And Taesan had some connection with them. Taesan felt a sense of familiarity with the Ijiwa mode.

His roots.

"I can't say anything like I used to."

The wizard said.

"You need to figure that out yourself. Well, if it's essential, I can help you."

Essential. The God of Essence.

He told Taesan to come find him later, saying he would help him understand his essence.

"At least I can't help with that part. I can only do this much."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Kiying!

The magician waved his hand. The system moved according to the master's intention.

[94th floor cleared.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [You obtained the Magician's Ring.] [You obtained ???.]

"The condition for clearing the 94th floor is to obtain what you desire there. The condition has been met."

With the quest clear, a reward was given. Taesan confirmed the ring that appeared on his hand.

[Magician's Ring] [A ring created by the Creator of the Labyrinth to give to their favorite adventurer. It can hold the abilities the user desires.]

"It's a ring that's just as described. If you desire a certain ability, it will become the ring's ability."

Then, what to desire was decided. Taesan focused his mind. Light emanated from the ring, and the description began to change.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Ring of the Mage: Attack Power] [Attack Power + 3000] [A ring created by the Creator of the Labyrinth for their beloved adventurer, allowing the user to imbue it with their desired abilities.]

"Wow."

3000. It was an extremely high number. The highest attack power aside from weapons.

"I guess it's only natural, considering the Labyrinth is ending soon."

And then ???

[You used ???.] [You obtained the Mage's magic, "Rainbow-Colored Iridescence Rush".]

The secret reward was not equipment, but a skill.

And it was the Mage's magic. Taesan looked at the Mage.

"That's not the magic of the God of Magic I possessed, but my own unique magic."

The Mage said lightly.

"I can't even control it myself right now. I originally intended to keep it to myself and let it disappear, but that would be a waste. You can use it somehow."

[Mage's Magic: Rainbow-Colored Iridescence Rush] [Mana Consumption: ???] [Proficiency: 1%] [A magic of the Mage that has been forgotten and can no longer be controlled. The more mana consumed, the more powerful and numerous the lights become.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A magic similar to black magic, where the consumed mana is not fixed. During the process of acquiring the magic, I could roughly sense its effect.

As a result, I was able to understand it.

The magician's magic is incredibly powerful.

If I had to rank it, it would be above high-level magic.

"I didn't know it would go this far."

This was a sufficient reward. The magician shook his head.

"It's enough. Thanks to you, I've learned a lot."

A happy smile was drawn on the magician's face.

"The reason I created the labyrinth was to see beings like you. I'm very satisfied."

The cleanup was finished. There was no need to stay on the 94th floor anymore.

Now, I had to head down to the 95th floor. Only six floors were left until clearing.

"What's the quest on the 95th floor?"

"Ah, not yet. There's a problem I need to take care of before that."

The magician clapped his hands. A long system window covered the view of the mountain.

[Special Quest Start] [Return to the Earth.] [In two days, you will return to the land you abandoned. Survive there and come back. The reward will be determined by your achievements.]
