**Episode 572**

572. The God of Fall, the Usurper (3)

The small orb manipulated by the Usurper. The power to control all falls, condensed and wielded.

This was not the Usurper's power. A different, heterogeneous energy was felt.

That was the power of another high god.

The Usurper had usurped the power of another high god.

[You don't think you can defeat me just because you've obtained the power of fall.]

The Usurper had obtained the power of fall and could wield the powers of the universe and the high gods together.

However, Taesan could also do that. Moreover, Taesan possessed the Void and Self-Immutability.

Even if you could control distorted power, you were clearly inferior to Taesan.

So, the Usurper's response was very simple.

They would usurp as well. The power of the high gods.

By doing so, they stood on the same level as Taesan.

"You can do that kind of thing."

The problem was that the Usurper was a high god. This usurpation would not be possible without harming the target of the usurpation. They would tear apart the concept and bring down the existence of the fallen.

"Perhaps the stolen divine power had been destroyed. But the thief laughed.

[If it were the original, I would have been crushed and discarded. My fellow divine beings have always been wary of that possibility and rejected me. But now it's not a problem. We don't have the luxury to worry about that.]

Taesan had become too powerful. It was almost impossible for a single divine power to take him down.

At least two.

Perhaps it would take more than that to have a chance to defeat Taesan.

But it was impossible for the divine powers to combine their strength to pressure Taesan while other transcendents watched with open eyes. It was a method that was impossible from the start.

But the thief was different.

By temporarily stealing the concept of the universe, they could even devour the authorities of other divine powers, and thus could face Taesan alone.

The thief had aimed for that fact.

[It's a good thing.]

The thief muttered lazily.

[I've always wanted to devour them, but I couldn't carelessly touch them because they would become hostile if I made a mistake... Thank you. I'm truly grateful. Thanks to you, I could steal the divine power of my fellow kind.]

"You're also twisted."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan shed tears of laughter.

The gods of downfall and the usurpers were all distorted. Even their own kind couldn't accept them, it was that bad.

[You're no different, either.]

The usurper spoke calmly.

[No, you're even more broken. There's no one who can be called your equal.]

Taesan didn't deny it. To him, who stood on the boundary, there was no equal.

[If anyone, it would be me.]

There were only two beings in the universe who could wield both powers: the usurper and Taesan. The usurper laughed. A voice filled with greed echoed.

[So, become mine.]

"I'm tired of hearing that already."

KUUUUUUUUNG!

The usurper unleashed their power.

The black downfall condensed and swung around. Taesan focused his mind.

KAGAGAGAK!

The boundary beast and the black downfall collided. The boundary beast was the boundary itself, a realm. No matter how powerful the black downfall was, it couldn't defeat the beast.

But the black downfall didn't back down.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Even when facing the boundary, it didn't back down and collided. The mountain had to exert physical force on the boundary to neutralize it.

"What kind of power is this?"

The usurper was currently handling the power of collapse and agony by merging them.

But it was unclear what kind of power that was.

Kuuuuung!

The black collapse swung again. Although it was a small sphere, it was the concept of collapse itself.

"Surround me and protect me."

The beast was given an order. The boundary beast spread wide and formed a wall.

Kuuuuuung!

The collapse and boundary collided. As the collision occurred, the mountain focused its mind.

[You have activated essence comprehension.] [You have activated perfect scouting.]

The contents of the black collapse were revealed. A lot of information hidden within it entered the mountain's mind.

And the mountain realized.

That collapse was a single, complete entity.

The entire concept of collapse was being wielded.

Tzzzzz!

The waves of neutralization spread. The mountain created distance.

"Is that kind of thing even possible?"

No matter how high one's abilities were, using all their power in a single strike was close to impossible.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"For example, if we assume that the total amount of power possessed by a transcendent being is 100, then the power that can be wielded in a single attack would be around 10 at most.

Taesan's physical strength was not much different. The fact that he could put his full strength into every attack was only a standard for ordinary attacks, and it didn't mean he was truly using his full power.

It was possible to increase his power through a long preparation process, but it really required a long preparation process. It wasn't something that could be done in the midst of battle.

This was why the magician was amazed by the irregular, Multiplication. With an extremely short preparation process, Multiplication could wield power close to 100, or even surpass it.

And it wasn't any different even if it was a high-ranking official.

They could wield their power without consuming it, but that didn't mean they could continue to draw out their full power. There was a limit to the power they could exert at once.

However, the current usurper was continuously drawing out their full power.

Each and every attack contained 100 units of power. That's why even the beasts of the boundary couldn't easily push them back."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There were a few beings that achieved similar results, but there was only one being that truly wielded its power continuously.

That was the authority of the usurper who had devoured the divine power. The usurper spoke calmly, as if it had realized that Taesan had grasped its true nature.

[Everything is one. The name of the divine power I usurped is mine.]

Taesan had also heard that name before. When the divine power was about to devour the world, its servant had told him.

Perhaps the divine power had the ability to infuse its own concept and dignity into every action, and wield its power with every ounce of its being.

That power was intertwined with the concept of collapse, and every attack was accompanied by the notion of collapse itself.

It was a powerful and threatening force even to Taesan now.

"But in the end, it's just temporary."

The usurper was unstable.

Although it wielded the power of universal collapse, its distortion was gradually growing.

In the end, it was different from Taesan. It was only a temporary usurpation. It wouldn't be able to handle the collapse for long and would eventually become simple and powerless. The usurper didn't particularly deny it.

[If you endure, you can easily achieve victory. But... you won't do that.]"

Note: The translation tries to maintain the original tone and nuance of the text, but some phrases may have been adjusted for better readability in English.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The plunderer smiles.

[At least until your small hometown is brutally destroyed, you can endure.]

"Annoying thing."

Taesan clicks his tongue.

There are many monsters descending upon the earth. Among them, there are also apostles.

You can endure, but you cannot win.

In the end, it means you have to be defeated head-on.

Kukukuku!

The battle continues, and Taesan is greatly overwhelmed. He cannot overpower them.

"It's a monster."

Without expending any energy, he wields his full power. He has also acquired a distorted concept, mixed with the universe's collapse.

"It's difficult like this."

Taesan has been fighting by spreading his power widely to pressure his opponents. Fundamentally, he has an absolute advantage, so even if he does that, he can still pressure his opponents sufficiently.

However, the plunderer also handles something similar to boundaries. Since every attack is wielded with full power, it's not easy to push back.

Still, there is an advantage for Taesan: even if he is overwhelmed by the plunderer's full power, the boundary's strength itself is superior, so he doesn't back down.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$The beast of the boundary mixes in physical strength, and it was enough to respond sufficiently.

Then Tan-san also concentrates his strength.

"Crouch."

The beast of the boundary crouches to Tan-san's sword. He concentrates a great deal of physical strength.

And compresses it.

He uses the stolen divine power to concentrate everything into one sword.

And swirls it around.

By putting force into the sword, he draws out the boundary even more.

The fall is cut off by the boundary.

Gugugugug!

By concentrating force, it can be cut through. The confirmation is complete.

The phrase "can wield all-out power" means, in other words, that no more power can be drawn out than what is available now.

The thief seems to know this weakness, as he muttered to himself.

[You can wield all-out power but...there is a limit, you know.]

In the end, even if you clash with all your might against an opponent you cannot overcome, that advantage becomes meaningless.

Tan-san charged, with everything contained within the sword.

[You have triggered the end.]

The end is triggered. A concept that brings about the ruin of all things emerges, intermingled with ashes, and explodes.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It fills the space with an overwhelming presence. The usurper's massive body trembles.

Kwagagaga!

The dark collapse shakes the surroundings.

Each and every one of them is the usurper's full power.

The end is imminent, and it's about to be crushed in an instant.

But time has given us a chance. That's enough.

The body accelerates. It imbues the sword with physical strength.

[You have activated multiplication.]

Multiplication, along with all physical strength, is imbued into the sword. It's concentrated without being released, and focused on the sword.

The usurper unleashes its power. The dark collapse becomes thousands of beads and flies towards the mountain.

The mountain swings its sword.

Kwadddduk!

The collapse is completely crushed and shattered.

The concentrated physical strength, even if it's the usurper's full power, can be cut down like a head.

In an instant, everything is pierced, and we approach the usurper. The massive body appears before the mountain.

The mountain swings its sword again, releasing the concentrated physical strength.

In that moment, the usurper's body changes.

It becomes a twisted, formless body, neither of this world nor the other, a body that cannot take shape.

Note: The translation tries to maintain the original tone and style of the text, but some phrases may sound a bit awkward in English due to the differences in language structure and cultural context.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It shrinks in an instant. Like small dust, it becomes something else. The mountain loses its presence in a flash.

It was hit.

The plunderer had been aiming for this. The physical force exploded, but it didn't reach the plunderer. It transformed into something extremely small and the physical force passed by.

Kuuuuung!

The plunderer's body changes. It takes on a massive, grotesque, and distorted form. At the same time, its power and strength amplify to an unimaginable degree.

It tramples the mountain.

The mountain, which had already launched an attack, was left with no choice but to defend itself. It strongly activates its defense mechanism, including its shield and boundary repulsion.

Quadduduk!

The shield and boundary repulsion are pierced. The plunderer's transformed body comes into contact with the mountain.

And in that instant, the plunderer's body distorts. It attaches itself to the mountain, transforming into thousands of thorns that pierce it.

[Your first absolute nullification has been activated.] [Your second absolute nullification has been activated.]

[Your third absolute nullification has been activated.]

All nullifications are consumed in an instant.

The mountain unleashes its power. The beast of the boundary explodes, and everything that touches it is instantly erased.

Kwaaaang!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He gazes at the gap and quickly takes distance. Taesan clicks his tongue.

'It wasn't just one thing I ate.'

The prey that the predator ate was not just one thing that was made up of everything.

Taesan muttered in a tired tone.

'How much did you eat, anyway?'

[What's with that?]

The predator answered with a laugh."

Note: The text appears to be a dialogue between two characters, Taesan and the predator (찬탈자), and the conversation is about the predator eating something. The tone of the dialogue is somewhat casual and informal.
