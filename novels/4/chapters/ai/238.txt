Chapter 239

239. The Fourth Return. Earth (6)

"'Really... many have survived.'"

"Who is it due to?"

Kim Hui-yeon smiled and flicked her gaze. The gaze towards Tae-san, filled with respect and trust, grew even stronger.

And the leader of Daejeon, who was now looking displeased, wrinkled his face.

"If they can survive this much... they'll be able to do even more."

With the possibility of survival increasing, their faces lit up with enthusiasm.

"Then, who will lead?"

The leader of Jeju-do asked. They all managed and governed the players from each region, but now that they were all gathered in Seoul, it would be the best way to avoid confusion if one person issued a comprehensive order.

Everyone's gaze turned towards Tae-san.

Tae-san shook his head.

"That's not something for me to do. You all know, don't you? Who the leader of Seoul is."

"I've heard that before... ."

"But that's really the case..."
Here is the translation of the text:

Kim Hui-yeon became the leader of Seoul and was in charge of managing people, but he soon realized that the situation was much more complicated than he had imagined. As the leader of the organization, Kim Hui-yeon thought that the mountain (Taesan) was giving him overall instructions. However, the reality was that the mountain was actually assigning overall management to Kim Hui-yeon.

"I'm not good at managing people," he said.

What he was good at was killing monsters, and what Kim Hui-yeon was good at was managing people and assigning roles accordingly.

Each person had to take on their respective roles. This was Taesan's creed. Kim Hui-yeon bowed his head in gratitude towards Taesan, who recognized him.

The expressions of others also brightened up. They realized that Taesan was not someone who relied on force to impose his opinions.

In other words, no matter what Taesan claimed, they couldn't refuse. They were worried that Taesan might try to take them away, but that worry disappeared.

The leader of the war also brightened up, looking at the people with a warm smile.

"So...?"

"Who is the leader?"

The attention of the people turned to Kim Hui-yeon, who looked upset.

"Am I the one again?"

"That's only natural."
Here is the translation of the text:

"'Even in hard mode, you're still in charge of overall management, aren't you? Just a little more effort and you'll be fine.'"

"'Ugh, I don't want to. I don't like it.'"

Kim Hui-yeon sighed, but didn't refuse. She had a judgment that it would be best for her to take charge.

"'I'll count on you.'"

"'Okay, okay.'"

Kim Hui-yeon took a deep breath. It was determined that she would become the leader.

The leader of Daegu opened his mouth.

"'I'm opposed.'"

* * *

"'What?'"

The sudden opposition left people bewildered. They turned their gaze away.

"'Joo-hyeok, are you opposed too?'"

"'Yes, I am.'"

The leader of Daegu, Joo-hyeok, shook his head.

He looked at Kim Hui-yeon.

"'If Kim Hui-yeon becomes the leader, won't we have to follow her orders?'"

"'Of course we will.'"

That's what being a leader is all about - carrying the weight of everyone's lives and giving orders to govern the people.

And with that power comes responsibility. If people die, it will be Kim Hui-yeon's fault.

Joo-hyeok opened his mouth.

"'Then I don't want it. I don't want to entrust my life to others.'"

"'...You're going to become the leader?'"

"'Yes, I am.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

Lee Joo-hyeok replied strongly.

Everyone looked at him with ambiguous gazes.

"Uh...?"

"Well, that's true."

Kim Hwi-yeon pressed her forehead as if it hurt.

"I knew it might happen, but it really is this way."

Lee Joo-hyeok clashed with Kim Hwi-yeon even in a maze.

When she presented her strategy for the attack, he would interrupt her and express his own opinion. It's not a problem to express one's opinion itself, but Lee Joo-hyeok's attitude was the problem.

He claimed that only he was the real leader and that only his opinion was correct. He would often use language that excluded and rejected others, leading to many conflicts.

He believed that only he was right and ignored others' opinions. He wanted to rule over everyone alone, like an absolute monarch.

That was Lee Joo-hyeok.

"There's no problem. You're probably tired of being a leader, right? Leave it to me."

Lee Joo-hyeok said, and his eyes revealed his greed for power.

"Uh...?"

Kim Hwi-yeon looked at Taesan with a complex gaze. Taesan had one thing to say.

"I told you before, I won't get involved in your affairs. Let it be settled on its own."
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san chose to step down.

Then, completely, it's Kim Hui-yeon. Her choice has been made. She closed her eyes.

Honestly, it was a burden. She had to manage the lives of others and count them with numbers, and it was a heavy responsibility. If it wasn't her, then problems would arise, and she felt like she wanted to let go of it.

There, Lee Ju-hyeok said that he would become the leader.

"...?"

If Lee Ju-hyeok becomes the leader, then it's not so bad. His judgment was actually quite good. Compared to Kim Hui-yeon, who is safe and relatively conservative, there were also hard-mode players who supported his bold and decisive choices.

"Quickly answer. Time is precious."

Lee Ju-hyeok said. It seemed like Kim Hui-yeon was convinced that she would pass the leadership to him.

Kim Hui-yeon looked at Tae-san.

Tae-san was staring at her with a blank expression.

At that gaze, Kim Hui-yeon made a decision.

"I'm sorry, but it's not possible."

"Yes, it's because...?"

Lee Ju-hyeok's face stiffened as he smiled. Kim Hui-yeon spoke calmly.

"It's a refusal. Lee Ju-hyeok. I should be the leader."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Are you refusing?"

Lee Joo-hyeok's face contorted.

"That's not a leader's position, is it? Are you going to stick to your guns here?"

"That's not stubbornness. It's my choice. And it's you who's interested, isn't it?"

"You."

Lee Joo-hyeok's face contorted even more.

Kim Hwi-yeon shook her head.

"No matter what, I won't give up the leader's position. Then, what will we do? Will we give up or...?"

Kim Hwi-yeon grasped her weapon.

"According to the law of the labyrinth, I'll decide with brute force?"

Her words made Lee Joo-hyeok pause.

Kim Hwi-yeon was strong. She was one of the strongest hard mode players, and it was no exaggeration. Even if she fought, it would be difficult to guarantee a victory.

"...Let's decide by majority."

She said that, but Lee Joo-hyeok knew the outcome.

"Alright. If someone wants Kim Hwi-yeon to be the leader, let them raise their hand."

Everyone raised their hands except Lee Joo-hyeok.

Kim Hwi-yeon said, "Then if someone wants Lee Joo-hyeok to be the leader, let them raise their hand."

No one raised their hand.
Here is the translation of the text:

Lee Joo-hyeok's face contorted. The leader of Jeju-do spoke cautiously.

"Honestly, Hui-yeon is doing well, so is there a need to find someone else?"

"Yes, Joo-hyeok. You're not bad, but you're too impulsive. You've almost died many times because of that."

"...... Yeah, that's right."

Lee Joo-hyeok twisted his lips.

"I'm sorry, but I won't agree."

He slammed his fist on the table, and the table creaked and made a worried sound.

"I'm the one who should be the leader. I'll be the master of Korea."

"But it's already decided. Refusing to comply here is pointless, isn't it?"

"Yes."

"What?"

Lee Joo-hyeok stood up from his seat.

"I refuse to acknowledge it. Daejeon will drop out. We'll move independently."

"You!"

Kim Hui-yeon's face contorted. Lee Joo-hyeok laughed mockingly.

"Why? There's no problem, is there? I'm not resisting or fighting against you guys, am I? I'm just moving independently under my own judgment."

"That's what you're saying?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"I'm not following the leader's orders and moving on my own. It's clear that I'll have an impact on other groups too. My limbs can't move freely like this."

As the commotion was about to escalate, Taesan opened his mouth.

"What's going on?"

There was a moment of silence. People swallowed hard and wiped the sweat from their brows.

"......Yes, I'll move on my own."

Lee Joo-hyeok said this with a forced calm tone, but his eyes betrayed a trembling.

Taesan nodded his head.

"Then do as you please."

"......What?"

"Do as you please. Don't worry about the people of Daechon, no matter what you do. But if you cause trouble for others, then......"

Taesan smiled wryly.

Lee Joo-hyeok forced a smile with a sense of unease.

"Remember this."

He walked out. Taesan closed his mouth. Only then did the tense atmosphere relax, and people sat down.

"That crazy guy. I knew he was obsessed with power from the moment he entered the labyrinth, but I never thought he'd act like this outside......"

"Even more so outside. He's the master of Korea. Isn't he magnificent? That proud guy wouldn't hold back, would he?"

A sigh and a lament burst out. Kim Hui-yeon said, her eyes cast downward.
Here is the translation of the text:

"First, I'll deal with that annoying guy later, and let's handle the problems that need to be dealt with immediately."

She, who had managed to shift the topic, looked at Kim Hui-yeon with a calm gaze, as a leader of the entire Korea, and asked.

"What's the mood like among the people who have gathered here?"

"It's good. Family members who couldn't meet due to their modes have finally met, and a sense of unity has been felt. There's no sense of discrimination between modes, and the problems in Daejeon are negligible. The only problem is that guy."

There were no overall problems. Kim Hui-yeon tapped the table with his fingertips.

"So, let's talk about the quest now."

All the people of Korea gathered in Seoul.

Since the conditions had been met, the next quest appeared before them.

[Special Quest Start] [A large number of fissures will appear around the safe area of Seoul within a day. Please remove the fissures before the monsters' path is opened. The reward will be distributed differently according to the outcome.]

"What's a fissure?"

The people looked at each other in confusion, muttering to themselves. It was a word they had never seen before.

Tae-san opened his mouth.
Here is the translation of the text:

"A rift in the color of borah will appear around us. Monsters are guarding around it. We need to crush them and destroy the rift."

"Uh, do you know?"

"I broke one during the first return."

"You've been doing that since the first return, haven't you...?"

While they were only concerned with adaptation and survival and didn't even notice the rift, Taesan had already discovered it and solved the problem. The leaders of other regions were amazed by this fact.

"So, you're Taesan and you, spirits? Friends?"

"I'm Minerva. This is Barca. You can call us spirits, too."

[It's a shame to be with the king like this. This is quite a troublesome situation....]

"Don't worry. Don't worry."

Minerva waved her hand slightly. The others were sending strange glances.

Their faces were curious about the identities of Minerva and Barca.

Taesan didn't want to explain each detail, so he just said:

"We're definitely on our side. There won't be any betrayal. You've already seen their power, so you know."

"That's enough."

The leader of Jeju-do muttered to himself with a blank face.
Here is the translation of the text:

The sea was cut off and monsters were killed like insects. He rejected the understanding and headed towards Seoul, carefully watching the situation. Kim Hwi-yeon spoke calmly.

"If so, I'm sorry, but we'll have to rely on Taesan again, won't we?"

"You guys can't handle what's coming, so I'll take care of it. But I won't take care of everything. Do you understand?"

"Yes, we also need to toughen up."

A sense of gratitude spread across everyone's faces.

As the conversation came to an end, they all scrunched up their faces.

"So, how can I deal with that damn guy?"

"I'd like to bring him over to our side, but he's not listening to me."

Taesan said.

"Don't worry, I'll fill in the gaps. You're lacking, but I'll cover for you."

"But......"

"That type of person is not good for the group. Even if we bring him in, it's not going to be a smooth conversation. I don't think so."

Everyone nodded in agreement.

Lee Ju-hyeok was someone who wouldn't follow Kim Hwi-yeon's orders even if forced to. Instead, he would incite internal conflict. Thinking about it, it was fortunate that he had been separated from the group early on.

"So......"
Here is the translation of the text:

"They're all resting. I'll tidy up and talk properly tomorrow."

"Ugh. I need to take a nap."

"Okay, Whiyan. You've worked hard!"

They left. Kim Whiyan and Kang Taesan were the only ones left in the conference room.

Kang Taesan opened his mouth.

"What's unexpected? I thought you would yield to me."

"At first, I thought so too."

She felt the weight of being a leader was heavy. She thought she would pass it on to someone else if she had the chance.

"But..."

She looked at Taesan.

Taesan met her gaze. She shook her head.

"Just, I suddenly want to take it. It feels like I've gained some power."

She said it jokingly, but there was a reason.

Taesan trusted her.

She said she had the ability to lead and guide others. That's why she entrusted the leadership position to her.

She wanted to meet Taesan's expectations.

That was her reason.

"But... Hmm. Ijuhyeok also has no lack of qualifications as a leader. He could also take it over, I thought."

"No."
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san said. "I'm sure," Kim Hwi-yeon's eyes widened slightly.

"Don't you think so?"

"That guy lacks something important,"

In his previous life, Seoul was destroyed.

Many people died because of the incident involving Choi Jung-hyeok and Seo Jang-san. Therefore, the leader of Daejeon, Lee Ju-hyeok, who had the most survivors, naturally became the leader of everyone.

So Tae-san knew. Lee Ju-hyeok lacked the qualities of a leader.

Lee Ju-hyeok probably thought that he could move independently without problems based on his experience in Daejeon and prove his abilities to take the position of the leader.

However, Lee Ju-hyeok did not know one thing.

The power of the gods was concentrated in Seoul.

Even if he had fought against the strongest monster in Daejeon, it would be at most C-grade. He could believe that he could win with his own power alone. It was a thought that was as foolish as could be.

"Tsk, don't worry about it. He'll just collapse on his own."

Tae-san said carelessly.
