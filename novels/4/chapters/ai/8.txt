Episode 9

9. 1st Floor (4)

[First Discovery Bonus] [Intelligence permanently increased by 1. Mana permanently increased by 2.]

Both are good stats. Increasing intelligence naturally reduces mana consumption, allowing for more frequent use of skills. An increase in mana capacity goes without saying.

"This is the shelter of the Labyrinth. Your enemies cannot enter here of their own will. The tranquility here makes you lazy."

Monsters appear in most places in the Labyrinth. Exceptions are the shop and the spring. It's a kind of safe zone.

Taesan scooped up water with his hand. The cold liquid went down his throat refreshingly.

"You have reached peak condition."

Any remaining fatigue disappeared completely. It felt like having just taken the perfect amount of deep sleep.

Taesan sat down next to the spring. The ground was not hard stone but warm, comfortable mats, making him want to lie down right there.
The spring refreshed him physically, but there was little he could do about the accumulating mental fatigue. Even a bit of rest was absolutely necessary.

"It's been about a day already."

Checking his empty stomach, it seemed about time. Now was the time to check out Moore on the community.

"Community."

[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Hey guys, is it okay to enter the Labyrinth?] [Na Jaeyeon [Alone]: Judging by the lack of responses from those who entered, I don't think so. It's driving me crazy.] [Yoo Youngseok [Easy]: Anyone up for breaking through the 1st floor together?] [Kang Dongjun [Normal]: Seeking information. Does anyone know what the first monster is like?] [Lee Sang [Alone]: This is tough. Seriously.]

Naturally, most of the posts were from Alone players.

Players in different modes could meet and resolve things through direct conversation rather than relying on the community. However, Alone mode players couldn't meet each other; apart from the community, they had no means of communication.

As Taesan scrolled through the community, he chuckled.

[Lee Taeyun [Alone]: Guys ㅠㅠㅠ How do I deal with this for real ㅠㅠㅠ]
Here is the translation of the text:

---

The strongest player who survived and broke through the labyrinth, Lee Taeyeon. Unlike her usual confident self, she appeared extremely confused about the future.

"Maybe not."

Her status screen indicated she was in a frightened state. Although she hid her true self, she might have been a coward until the end.

Taesan glanced at the community for a moment.

It had only been a day since the labyrinth opened. Naturally, many Alone players were still alive. Here, one doesn't starve to death. As far as Taesan knew, full-scale entry was scheduled to begin a month later.

Alone mode ensures rewards proportional to the difficulty. Lee Taeyeon claimed she missed out on numerous rewards. She said she couldn't receive what she should have after clearing bosses using unconventional methods.

Yet she was still hailed as the strongest player.

In other words, raising one's level in Alone mode had potential benefits.

"Hmm."

Every single card in the labyrinth was valuable.

Things wouldn't change drastically even if one went outside.

"Not bad."

Taesan began composing a post on the community.

First, some simple advice. Starting from not angering the gatekeeper to explaining the types of items sold by the shopkeeper.
Here is the translation of the text:

---

Taesan won against Big Rat, which others deemed impossible. He immediately writes to flee upon encountering it and return to the shop. Then, upon hearing the location of the spring, he writes to run there without delay.

It's nearly impossible to survive without following this basic route. He continues to write about what to do next.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Basic strategy for 1st floor of Alone Mode.]

Whether others will believe it or not is uncertain.

Believing in a faceless post and entering the labyrinth is a very difficult task. Even if they believe, it's unknown how effective it will be. Among a thousand, only Lee Taeyeon survived.

With little expectation, he just drops a hint and closes the community.

"Shall we start slowly?"

Taesan got up and stretched.

As long as you don't leave the 1st floor, infinite use is possible here. The reason Lee Taeyeon survived was because she wandered around here and barely caught Big Rat after a week.

Therefore, the normal flow in Alone Mode was to return to the shop after encountering Big Rat, hear the location of the spring, and immediately rush here to obtain the safety zone.

"What kind of setup is this?"

Since hearing from Lee Taeyeon, I felt something was odd. If they were going to make it like this, it would have been better to place the Fountain of Life from the beginning. Survival itself becomes impossible without this place anyway.

But the creator of the labyrinth intentionally placed it far away, causing most to come and die.

It was difficult to understand whether this was merciful or cruel.

Anyway, the important thing is this part.

There are no limits to recovery here. You can prepare a lot before leaving the 1st floor.

The reason he survived with weak stats is only one thing. Skills. Taesan thought skills were more valuable here than stats.

Gurgle.

His stomach growled right on cue. Come to think of it, he hadn't eaten anything for almost a day. He wouldn't die from starvation, but enduring it would significantly reduce his stats and deliver considerable pain, so it was better to resolve it quickly.

Taesan intended to resolve it as well.

In a slightly different way than others would think.

Taesan opened his inventory and took out some meat.

[Big Rat's Meat] [Quality: 86%] [It's meat from a Big Rat. You could eat it if you wanted to.]

It was classified as raw meat, but due to its size, a considerable amount of meat came out. Taesan drew his rusty sword.

Swoosh.

He carefully cut a piece of meat to make it easier to eat. Taesan, examining the meat for a moment, muttered with uncertainty,

"Can I really eat this?"

In Easy Mode, food was plentiful. He had never tried Big Rat meat before. Rather than a reddish hue, the meat was closer to a black color. Its muscles were grotesquely swollen, not appetizing at all.

"Considering the objective, maybe this is better."

Taesan put the meat into his mouth.

"..."

He grimaced at the tough texture without any hint of sweetness. Nevertheless, he forced himself to chew and swallowed it.

[You ate uncooked raw meat.] [Condition check in progress…] [. . .] [Check failed!] [You have contracted food poisoning!]

Condition: Food poisoning. Stamina will decrease over two days. The rate of decline is rapid; without drinking a disease treatment potion or stamina potion, death would be inevitable.

For beginners, it was a nightmare-like condition. Those who experienced it once always made sure to cook their meat thereafter.

However, Taesan was intentionally eating raw meat.

Taesan drank some spring water.

[You are now in optimal condition.]

And he eats raw meat again.

[You ate uncooked raw meat.] [Condition check in progress…] [. . .] [Check successful!] [Nothing happened.]

One more time.

[You ate uncooked raw meat.] [Condition check in progress…] [. . .] [Check failed!] [You have contracted food poisoning!]

He drinks some spring water.

[You are now in optimal condition.]

He eats meat.

[You ate uncooked raw meat.] [Condition check in progress…]

If he doesn't get food poisoning, he eats another piece of meat. If he does get food poisoning, he drinks spring water and eats meat again.

He repeats these two actions endlessly. As his stomach gradually fills up, another system window appears.

[You have contracted numerous diseases and developed resistance. You have acquired special passive skill [Disease Resistance].]

Taesan grinned broadly.

"Bingo."

The labyrinth does not provide food.

Emergency rations are sold in shops, but they are very expensive and in Hard and Alone modes, their supply is limited. They are not sufficient for breaking through the labyrinth.

In the end, he had no choice but to roast or boil the creatures within the labyrinth for food, as the space was limited, forcing him to eat them raw.

In such circumstances, getting food poisoning was a serious problem. Itae-yeon had nearly died from it before.

But having disease resistance changes everything.

[Special Passive Skill: Disease Resistance] [Proficiency: 1%] [Resistance to various diseases. At this point, he rarely gets sick from eating.]

It reduced the chance of food poisoning by less than 10%, which was a great help in critical situations. As proficiency increased, he would practically become immune to food poisoning.

Normally, this skill would only be acquired after various diseases had been contracted, but Tae-san, who knew the information, could easily obtain it.

Next comes another skill.

Tae-san headed towards the spring.

It was just the right depth, up to his waist.

"I really don't like this."

With a frown, Tae-san plunged his head into the water.

*Plop*

Naturally, his breathing was blocked underwater. Instead of coming up for air, Tae-san closed his eyes and held his breath.

*Plop*

The air bubbles gradually diminished.

Finally, the air he had been holding completely escaped.

"……."

The body devoid of air longs for breath. The agony spreads gradually.

But endures.

[You are in a state where breathing is impossible.]

It's tormenting.

Someone once said drowning is the most agonizing way to die. Whether it's true or not, it meant it was that painful. The body yearns for breath, commanding urgently to leave the water quickly.

But does not leave.

Endures underwater with an unwavering face.

Rather, forcibly closes the prayer to drink even water, and waits.

The mind gradually starts to haze. Strength fades. Consciousness disappears and stars appear.

Death is imminent.

Then the system window appears.

[You have not breathed until the brink of death. Acquired special activation skill [Breathless].] [You have recognized death. Acquired special continuous activation skill [Line of Death].]

Alright.

Tae-san raises his body. Water splashes violently.

"Huff, huff."

Calming the wildly throbbing heart, he regulates his breathing. After a few minutes, it finally settles down.

"Man, that was close."

He grumbled as he ran his wet hair through his fingers. In essence, it was self-inflicted torture. Even for Tae-san, accustomed to pain, it was a thoroughly agonizing experience.

But there was no other choice. Breathlessness could only be obtained underwater.

[Special Activation Skill: Breathless] [Mana Consumption: 1] [Proficiency: 1%] [Can withhold breath for extended periods. Currently only about twice as long as usual.]

Breathless, a skill that increases the duration of breath.

It was not a well-known skill.

It could only be obtained underwater, and only just before death.

Most who acquired it ended up fish food, so it wasn't until after Tae-san obtained it that the skill's information was revealed.

And even after it was revealed, no one else acquired it.

One had to be right on the verge of death underwater. Humans willing to endure the fear of potential death from suffocation were extremely rare. Most survivors in the labyrinth were akin to cowards and thus did not attempt to learn it.

For these reasons, besides Tae-san, there was only one other person who had acquired it.

In Easy and Normal modes, it was a largely useless skill. However, from Hard and Alone modes onward, the story changed.

As much as breathlessness was a great help, given that the air itself was poisonous when one was bored.

At the same time, it was also not a bad skill to get the death line.

Skill to inform you when you are in danger of dying due to location or attack.

Thanks to this, there were quite a few crises that were avoided.

[Special Ongoing Skill: Death Line] [Proficiency: 54%] [You can sense when you are about to die. It is activated in most crises.]

"Hmm?"

Tae-san was surprised when he saw his proficiency.

"Why is it already 54%?"

It was quite difficult to increase proficiency by 1%. In the case of advanced skills, there were hardly any players who exceeded 50% until they came out of the labyrinth.

But it was already 54%. It was similar to the proficiency he had obtained in the future.

"Could this be an inheritance?"

It seemed that the strength imprinted on the mind rather than the body continued to some extent. However, thinking like that was just the basic proficiency of being calm and penetrating.

"I don't know."

Tae-san neatly organized his thoughts.

In the labyrinth, things that cannot be understood often happen.

If you try to give meaning to all of them, you cannot hold on.

To him, it was a good thing, so he should be satisfied with that.

Tae-san checked the number of skills he currently possessed.

Swordsmanship. Shield technique. Field of view control. Penetration. Composure. Spiritual boost. Death Line. Breathlessness. Disease resistance.

Nine in total. He had obtained these skills from the 1st floor, which is easy for an average player to clear.

Tae-san had reached the 20th floor in the past before obtaining this number. Considering that most of them were useless skills, their value was even higher.

However, Tae-san had no intention of stopping here.

There were still more skills to acquire.
