Chapter 513

513. 94th Floor, Easy Mode (6)

It's hard to confirm with my eyes because the space is distorted. I have skills related to vision, but even with those, there's a clear limit to what I can do with this easy mode body.

So I rely on my memories.

I etch the fleeting memories onto my body. Like a set machine, I record the positions of the spores and the actions I need to take in each loop, and I execute them exactly as planned.

Quadddd!

[Dealt 1546 damage to the spore.]

If I didn't have body time acceleration, I wouldn't have been able to keep up with the speed even if I repeated the actions like a machine. But somehow, I'm still able to keep up. My head is constantly spinning. I lightly push the spore to the side, but with the acceleration, it flies away like it was hit by a truck. I move my sword exactly as planned. The flying spore splits apart and heads towards the next loop's Taesan.

The damage is slowly approaching the 2000 mark.

And problems start to arise.

"It's getting hard to keep up."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He was making the best judgments and actions. However, despite that, the processing of the spoilers was becoming increasingly difficult.

[What's going on?]

Barudray had given up trying to figure out what Taesan was doing at some point. Even adventurers who had entered the deep layers of the Alone Mode couldn't understand Taesan's movements now.

Quadduk!

Taesan cut down the spoiler and immediately changed his stance. It was a precise movement like a well-oiled machine.

Kagak!

However, the result was dangerous. The spoiler barely grazed past the sword's edge. If there had been even a slight hesitation, it would have missed.

Even with the best judgment, he couldn't keep up with the acceleration.

"How did he get it?"

Taesan was amazed at his past self. Even now, with all his knowledge and experience, he had acquired a skill that was almost impossible to obtain, and he had done it in Easy Mode.

"If it continues like this..."

He wouldn't be able to get the multiplier.

His attack power was 49. To get the multiplier, he needed to reach 2401 damage. He was still in the early 2000s. It was an almost impossible feat, but it was lacking.

"......There's no choice."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan, who had been pondering for a moment, made a decision. He didn't know how the system would judge him, but he thought it would be better than failing.

He awakened the part of himself that had been dormant, a part of what he originally had.

He called upon his senses.

Swoosh.

At the same time, the world began to intervene with Taesan. It was as if it was not allowed, and it tried to exclude him.

"Get out."

Taesan repelled the intervention.

A sense of omnipotence filled his entire body. In an instant, he felt everything in the labyrinth through his senses.

The time it took to get to that point was so short that it was imperceptible to humans. Taesan closed his eyes and moved his body.

Quadruple hit!

[Dealt 2087 damage to Spore.]

He didn't see it. He didn't calculate it. He didn't read the possibilities.

He simply relied on his senses and moved his body.

Quadruple hit again!

And with that, the Spores began to scatter one by one.

No matter how fast the calculations were, no matter how optimal the judgments were, ultimately, the brain had to be used. There was inevitably some delay in translating it into actual action.

But Taesan, at this moment, was moving solely on pure instinct and senses.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And that alone is enough to handle the spore.

Ku ku ku ku ku!

Like a comet, or even faster. Any material would burn at the speed it falls.

Begone, begone, it vanishes. The damage increases steadily.

The physical body can't keep up with the falling speed. But it doesn't matter. The omnipotent sense is like foreseeing the future.

The spores split apart.

The physical body forcibly follows the sense. Repeating the loop dozens of times, it finally reaches.

Quaddup!

[Dealt 2402 damage to the spore.]

Surpassed 2401.

At the same time, the system window covers the view.

[You have squared the damage. You have obtained the special skill [Multiplier].] [You have controlled the environment and situation to forcibly reach your goal. You have obtained the special skill [Forced Arrival].]

* * *

Obtained.

Taesan quickly took out a potion.

[You have activated the potion of physical strength reset.]

Kuuuuuuuuung!

A sudden, intense backlash enveloped Taesan.

Note: The text appears to be a passage from a fantasy novel or game, with a focus on action and combat. The language is quite vivid and descriptive, with onomatopoeic words like "쿠구구구궁" and "콰드드득" used to create a sense of dynamic energy.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$If he had not been assisted by the system, he would have died, and if it had hit accurately, it would have been a physical force strong enough to harm an S-class monster.

It’s all thanks to...

Tae San managed to land on the ground, suppressing his shock.

“Thank goodness.”

He only summoned his senses, not his physical strength or level. Since his physical abilities and level did not change, there was no problem meeting the conditions for acquiring new skills.

However, even so, he had summoned something new, and he didn’t know if there would be any changes in the conditions for acquiring multiplication skills.

It was a gamble, but fortunately, he was able to obtain it without any significant problems.

“Phew.”

Tae San sighed. The overwhelming sensation that filled his entire body was disappearing.

His physical condition was terrible.

Although he hadn’t taken any significant damage, his whole body had fallen to the ground at a speed that would make it impossible for him to be unscathed. Even if his stamina hadn’t been consumed, his physical exhaustion was a separate issue. His whole body was trembling.

His sharp mind also wilted like a damp rag. It was as if he had overheated like a machine.

However, Tae San’s emotions were more intense than ever before.

Even if he tried to hide it, his emotions were evident on his face.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan climbed up again and drank from the Fountain of Life.

He opened his skill window to check.

[Special Activation Skill: Multiply] [Mana Consumption: 30] [Deals damage squared. This skill has a one-hour cooldown after activation.]

This was the powerful card he had. The unique skill that could deal over a hundred million damage.

He finally got Multiply.

[……I really got it.]

Only then did Bardley come to his senses and muttered.

[Multiply. Huh. Amazing.]

He trusted Taesan completely, but this time he was half-doubtful. Using the acceleration of landing to bring out the square of attack power, and having to succeed in every attack loop. The conditions were too difficult.

But Taesan finally achieved it. Even if he used a shortcut at the end, his achievement couldn't be ignored.

Akasha, who had been quiet, also spoke up.

[Master, what are you...?]

"Why."

[No, this is... this is...].

"Come to think of it, you're seeing it for the first time, aren't you?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"After obtaining Akasha, I had never properly attempted to acquire skills. I had seen various skills like Bardleya Plus and Forced Duel, but multiplication was a first for Akasha.

[Do you have to do something like that to acquire skills?]

"It's not all like this, but it's a similar feeling."

[You're...].

Akasha remained silent for a moment. Then, with a sense of reverence, she spoke.

[You're amazing.]

"It's nothing. It was just a struggle to get stronger."

Taesan said so, but even he was a little surprised.

"Was it really like this?"

He had taken on the penalty and brought back his original senses, but it was slightly dangerous.

To obtain such a skill with his meager stats and no combat experience was astonishing. He was amazed at his past self.

Of course, the method of acquisition back then was different. Since there was no need to rush, he kept buying physical strength reset potions.

And he challenged, and challenged, and challenged.

Until luck came his way.

He repeated this process until the spores precisely followed Taesan's movements, a miraculous event.

"It feels like it took several decades."
$@$v=v1.13-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I couldn't remember anything beyond that. Later, I tried to recall it with a half-broken mind, but it didn't work out well either.

It was as if I had compressed an enormous amount of time into just about a month.

"Huh."

When I thought about it again, it was ridiculous.

I didn't know if I could acquire a skill like that, or if it was a useful skill at all. Yet, he invested a lifetime's worth of time into it.

It wasn't just a matter of multiplying things. There were many cases where I invested similar amounts of time and got nothing in return.

Yet, he didn't give up.

He just kept repeating and trying.

"I wasn't exactly normal, either."

[Was it "not exactly" or "definitely not"?]

That's how I became the Taesan I am today, and it wasn't bad. I acquired a new skill through a different method than in my past life.

[Special Activation Skill: Forced Achievement] [Mana Consumption: 50] [Proficiency: 1%] [You can forcibly achieve what you desire. However, you cannot achieve the impossible, and you will bear all penalties that arise during the process. If the penalty exceeds what you can handle, the skill will not activate.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What kind of skill is this again?"

You could achieve something by force, but only if you met the conditions. At first glance, it seemed like an almighty skill.

Of course, there were prerequisites. You couldn't set impossible goals, and you had to take on the penalties and risks.

What did it mean to achieve something by force?

He grasped the criteria. He gazed at the wall beyond the mountain.

The 80th floor was quite wide. With his current physical abilities, it would take him several seconds to reach the other side of the wall if he didn't use his skill.

What he wanted was to reach the end of the wall from start to finish at the fastest speed possible.

[You have activated Forced Arrival.]

The skill was activated.

Taesan tried to put strength into his legs and dash forward.

At that moment, Taesan felt a strong pain.

His entire body's muscles swelled up. The blood vessels burst due to the unbearable physical force. His heart suddenly beat at dozens of times its normal speed.

BOOM!

With the explosive sound, Taesan reached the wall. No, it was more like he collided with the wall.

[Huh?]

Bardley was shocked.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The movement Taesan showed now was not inferior even when compared to that of an adventurer in Alone Mode.

He had reached a level of around 50 floors.

Of course, it wasn't that remarkable in itself. Even Taesan in Easy Mode could achieve that speed if he put his mind to it.

But that was only possible when using skills that assisted speed, such as Super Acceleration and Physical Time Acceleration.

However, Taesan didn't use any speed-related skills now.

He had a physical body with 100 stats.

It meant that he had reached the 50th floor in Alone Mode with that physical body alone.

Pshew!

His entire body's blood vessels burst. His muscles ruptured. His pounding heart felt like it was about to explode.

The blood spilled all over the floor, creating a large puddle.

Taesan grimaced.

His arms and legs trembled. The blood stained the floor. His ruptured muscles barely supported his body.

[You took 5 damage.] [You took 8 damage.] [You took 7 damage.]

The damage continued to pour in. His health was cut in half in an instant.

Taesan barely dragged his broken body to the Fountain of Life.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You have reached the optimal state."

"Huh."

All the injuries on his body were healed. Taesan rubbed his entire body, feeling his muscles.

"......This is it."

Taesan's eyes sank. He, who had been trapped in the labyrinth longer than anyone else, knew.

The moment he forcibly activated the system, his body temporarily crossed the line of the system.
