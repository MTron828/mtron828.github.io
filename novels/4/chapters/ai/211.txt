Chapter 212

212. The 51st floor, the wolf that destroyed the world (2)

The wolf howled towards the meteorite that was falling towards it.

[Ah, oh no!]

The howling contained great intensity and shot out. The meteorite burst apart instantly and even its remnants melted away. All moisture evaporated, leaving nothing behind.

The howling was not satisfied and flew towards the Taesan. Taesan quickly moved its wings.

A scorching heat passed by right next to Taesan.

The wolf that destroyed the world.

It seemed like it had burned up the entire world.

“Wooo, woooaaaah!”

Those who were hiding could not survive and rushed towards the wolf. Even if they stood still, they would be exhausted by the heat, and they thought they would kill the wolf before that.

But it was useless. The wolf smiled wryly and moved its body.

Boom.

The adventurers who rushed towards the wolf with the remnants of their souls were all crushed and trampled. They did not even let out a cry and disappeared.

Their foolish deaths became an opportunity for Taesan.
Here is the translation of the text:

The wolf, who was making a loud snarl while stepping on them and slightly lifting its breath, was suddenly attacked by Tai Shan.

[You have activated "Sadohwa" [Mixed-type spell].] [You have accelerated.] [Whoa!]

Before Tai Shan could close in, the wolf responded quickly. It turned its body roughly and brought down its claws. Tai Shan drew its sword.

[You have activated "Furigana" [Whirlwind].]

Kkkaaa!

Furigana pushes the opponent's attack aside. Although the claws' trajectory was bent, it did not bend. Instead, the claws used their own strength to suppress the trajectory and came down.

Kkkaaa!

Tai Shan directly pushed the wolf's claws away. The claws slid across Tai Shan's arm and landed on the ground.

[You take 2021 damage.]

Although it just barely grazed Tai Shan, a high amount of damage was taken. Tai Shan pulled back its sword and deeply cut the wolf's side.

[The wolf's fragment, which destroyed the world, takes 43 damage.]

And the damage appears. Tai Shan growls and the wolf again brings down its claws.

[You have activated random blink.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The physical body of Taesan moved upwards towards the top of the wolf. The claws scratched the air without touching it. As Taesan fell, it infused its energy into the sword and stabbed the wolf's back.

[Dealt 203 damage to the wolf's fragment that destroyed the world.]

The damage was definitely increased compared to when it didn't infuse its energy.

However, the damage was still woefully insufficient. Although the wolf's vitality is unknown, it is clear that this damage is not enough.

The wolf's back was struck by Taesan, who was engulfed by a fierce flame. Taesan quickly dodged the flames that seemed to want to devour it.

"It's not worth fighting."

[You received the saint's energy. And that's the wolf that destroyed the world. If we're talking about strength, it's higher over there, even if it's just a fragment.]

It was too hasty to be devoured immediately. Taesan remained calm and activated its true understanding.

[You activated your true understanding.] [The fragment of the wolf that destroyed the world.] [A being that can turn everything into ash.]

The vitality is not visible. The true understanding meant that even the enemy that couldn't be understood by the true understanding was a challenge that Taesan had to overcome by itself.
Here is the translation of the text:

The dragon's aura was engulfed in flames. And that flame had become a kind of defensive barrier, making it impossible for Tai Shan's attack to hit its mark.

In other words, I had to devour that flame.

Tai Shan spread his wings.

"Let's try it slowly."

Mana is virtually unlimited. The powder made from the wings of a fairy can not only recover physical strength but also recover mana. After using dozens of ice arrows, Tai Shan's mana was fully recovered in an instant.

[You have activated the Frozen World.]

Tzhhh!

Ice crystals began to form on the ground. A cold wind blew towards the dragon, and it let out a loud roar.

[Crack!]

The dragon howled. The cold wind that had begun to spread shattered into fragments.

"It won't work."

The Frozen World is a useful skill against many enemies. However, it is of little use against an overwhelmingly powerful individual.

Tai Shan flew high into the sky and used various magic, including ice arrows and explosive fireballs, to harass the dragon's nerves.

[Crackle...]

The dragon began to feel the heat. It was taking too long to defeat the enemy in front of it and bring about the end of the world.

[Aaaaah!]

And then, a raging flame erupted.
Here is the translation of the text:

Before the dragon, flames began to gather. The gathered flames danced on the wind.

Kaka kaka kaka!

A hurricane formed, comprising countless flames.

And then, the hurricanes devoured each other, forming a single storm.

"What a beast, what a technique!"

The Mountain God smiled and flapped its wings. The flames' storm chased after the moving Mountain God.

The Mountain God realized it was under an unstoppable attack and stopped evading.

[You have activated the Frozen World.]

Tzhee-jee!

Ice is pouring down. But the storm only paused for a moment, calmly advancing towards the Mountain God.

It cannot be blocked by magic. The Mountain God gathered its spiritual energy and charged towards the storm.

The Mountain God brings down its sword at the storm.

Kua kua kua!

The storm bursts forth violently. Flames shoot out in all directions, trying to suppress the Mountain God.

The Mountain God wrapped its spiritual energy around its body.

Kaka kaka kaka!

A fierce resistance ensues. The flickering heat makes it hard to breathe, and the spiritual energy wrapped around the body stirs up.

The Mountain God focused its mind.

It poured its energy into the sword connected to the storm and gazed intently at the storm raging before its eyes.
Here is the translation of the text:

This storm was not just a simple flame storm. It was an attack that contained the power of the wolf itself.

And such an attack would naturally have a center that it is anchored to.

The storm's wave and movement, which I felt as I rode the sword, were easy to read.

At the end, Tai Shan, who had grasped the center of the hurricane, plunged his body into the storm.

[You take 3051 damage.] [You take 2043 damage.]

The flames rushed in.

The skin began to redden, slowly burning from the fingertips, and one's breath grew short. Ignoring the piercing pain, Tai Shan plunged his sword into the spot where the nuclear core was located.

Pffft!

The storm burst open.

And behind the storm that had burst open, a wolf appeared.

Grrr...

Tai Shan blocked the wolf's attack and used the rebound to fly far away. He quickly pulled out a revitalization potion and drank it.

New skin cells appeared on the skin that had burned.

Tai Shan's vitality was somewhat recovered. As a warrior, he had to take risks to attack.

But there was also something gained.
Here is the translation of the text:

The flames emanating from the wolf's body seemed to be significantly weakened.

Tai Shan realized that the flames on the wolf's body were responsible for both attack and defense. As a result, if he used his strength to attack, his defense would naturally become weaker.

So, the strategy was clear.

Tai Shan charged at the wolf. The wolf howled and rushed to meet him. It fiercely struck down with its claws.

Ka-ka-ka!

He whirled his sword and released it. The aftermath of this alone would not be enough to deal a fatal blow, but it was not a level that could be endured.

Tai Shan thrust his sword into the wolf's belly.

[You have activated the "Critical Hit" skill.] [You have activated the "Addition" skill.]

Quack.

The wolf's hind leg was severed.

[The wolf's fragments, which had destroyed the world, dealt 502 damage.]

Although the damage was not high, it had increased significantly compared to before.

The wolf seemed to be about to burn Tai Shan to death from below, and Tai Shan immediately pulled out a shield.

[You have activated the "Aegis of the Phoenix" skill.]

Pff-pff-pff!

The flames exploded and pressed down on Tai Shan. However, due to the Aegis of the Phoenix, he did not receive any damage.
Here is the translation of the text:

When the shield's invincibility time ended, the flames' discharge also ceased. Taesan struck the spear into the area he had attacked before and launched another attack.

[You have activated the spear.] [You have dealt 1304 damage to the fragmented fragments of the world-destroying wolf.]

Finally, a four-digit damage value appeared.

The wolf seemed to be about to collapse, and its legs were trembling. Taesan narrowly escaped.

Taesan, who had widened the distance, looked at the wolf's hind leg. There was a small wound there.

[Crunch...]

The wolf quietly bared its teeth and glared at Taesan. Its eyes were full of caution.

[Krunch!]

The wolf is charging.

Taesan draws his sword to respond.

To swallow Taesan, the wolf opens its jaws and bites. Taesan dodges the charging claw.

[You have taken 4053 damage.]

The claw scratches the leather armor. Taesan endures the pain and strikes the sword into the wolf's hind leg again.

[You have dealt 2031 damage to the fragmented fragments of the world-destroying wolf.]

Pffft.

Blood bursts out of the wounded leg.

[Krunch!]

The wolf's cry is the first to show pain. The wolf violently trembles its body. The flames spread like sparks in all directions.
Here is the translation:

Tae-san moves his wings. He dodges the flames that burst forth from the straight movement.

To avoid the wolf's attack as it charges towards him, he leaps out of the way.

The wolf shoots a fireball at him with its mouth, and Tae-san narrowly avoids it, striking the wolf's hind leg with his sword once more.

[Ah!]

The wolf lets out a mighty roar and thrashes its leg wildly. Before Tae-san could dodge, the wolf's leg struck his shoulder.

[You took 8053 damage.]

Unbearable damage has been inflicted upon you.

Tae-san takes a step back. The wolf is not weak. For it to attack, it must also suffer damage.

However, unlike the wolf, Tae-san has a means of recovering his strength.

Until now, he had not had the opportunity to drink a healing potion during battle, but the wings of the fairy allow him to stay aloft in the air. Thanks to this, he can now avoid the wolf's attack and use the potion.

[You have used a healing potion.]

Tae-san's strength is restored once more. He grips his sword tightly and charges forward.

Kah-kah-kah!
Here is the translation of the text to English:

As the battle continued, the speed and strength of Taesan were further increased due to the battle skills. On the other hand, the flames of the wolf gradually dwindled.

Clang.

The wolf with a sword stuck in its leg howls again.

The wolf starts to limp.

[Tssss...].

The wolf's eyes, gazing at Taesan, narrowed.

The wolf remembered its own death.

When it was duty-bound to remake the world and create a new world, countless lives stood in its way.

Among them were outstanding magicians and the world's strongest swordsmen. All of them, with exceptional abilities, rushed to kill the wolf.

They were certainly strong. They had the power to kill the wolf.

However, to the wolf, they were worthless.

It was a monster that would bring about the end of the world. To such a monster, they were nothing but insignificant accessories. In reality, they were able to kill the wolf, but they could not stop the end of the world.

However, the existence in front of it was different.

That was not just a simple accessory. Its power, its strength, and everything about it was beyond that of the wolf.
Here is the translation of the text:

The wolf has decided. What's important now is not the destruction of the world, but killing the existence right in front of us.

The wolf howled.

[Auuuuuu!]

Hoooo!

The flames that engulfed the entire village are extinguished. The heat that was suffocating the air is gradually subsiding.

[You take 164 damage.] [You take 123 damage.]

The continuous damage is gradually decreasing and eventually disappears.

However, the expression on the mountain's face was not bright.

Until now, the wolf had only seen the mountain as an obstacle to its goals, but now it recognizes the mountain as a true enemy and intends to kill it.

The wolf that is destroying the world has started targeting the mountain individually.

[Crunch.]

The flames that enveloped the wolf's body have become even thicker, and now are a deep red color.

From now on, it's serious. The wolf has bent its hind legs. The wolf's body has become like a bullet, shooting towards the mountain.
