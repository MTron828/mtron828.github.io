Chapter 459

459. Seventh Return, Earth (11)

"Are you curious? Check it out now. I have something to explain."

Taesan didn't refuse. He opened his skill window to check what he had obtained.

[Advanced Magic: Teleport] [Mana Consumption: 5000] [Proficiency: 1%] [You can move to a desired location within the specified range.]

The first advanced magic he had obtained was Great Explosion.

Its performance was extremely satisfying. Although it was a bit lacking against Goshin, it was one of Taesan's strongest attack skills, far surpassing intermediate magic.

And now, he had obtained another skill of the same level.

Zelvand smiled and nodded.

"Try using it once."

"Thank you."

The skill description said it could move to a desired location. Taesan thought of a place in his mind.

[You have activated Teleport.]

Mana gathered.

Space opened up, and Taesan's body leaped through the air.

He arrived at the place he wanted to be.

"......It's real."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Although everything has collapsed and I can't find the appearance of that time, the place he arrived at was the exact spot where he had chosen the alone mode option.

Taesan closed his eyes and recalled the place again.

It was Antarctica.

Although he had never been to Antarctica, he recalled the place he had seen through the media and activated his magic.

[You have activated teleportation.]

And Taesan arrived in Antarctica.

The place was slightly different from what he remembered, but he knew it was the same place.

After conducting several experiments, Taesan grasped the range and conditions of teleportation.

"There's no cooldown."

Random, limited blinks had a 10-minute cooldown. He had to be very cautious when using them.

But teleportation, which was considered a high-level magic, had no cooldown.

Although it consumed a lot of mana and still required caution, the fact that there was no time constraint was a significant advantage.

And Taesan could also go to places he had never seen in pictures or media.

By imagining the location and desired place in his mind, he could move to a similar location.

Then, what was the maximum distance within the designated range?
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan imagined a distant universe in his mind and activated teleportation.

Tat.

And Taesan was able to see a blue star.

He had arrived in the universe.

"What's the atmospheric pressure like?"

Taesan returned to Earth, and Jervand, who had been waiting patiently, asked him.

"How was it?"

"It was good."

It wasn't something that could be done without any restrictions.

He needed to vividly imagine a specific location and prepare for a certain amount of time.

The magic itself wasn't instantaneous either. It took time for the mana to gather and the space to open.

Calculating that time, it would take around a few seconds. It wasn't a skill that could be easily used in battle.

However, it was a skill that allowed for free spatial movement within the planet's range without a cooldown. As a movement skill, it was top-tier. Its value as a high-level magic was unparalleled.

"Originally, this skill wasn't given to mortals, but since you've surpassed being a mortal, it doesn't matter."

Taesan checked his title.

So far, those who had appeared with the title of Great Mage had all possessed overwhelming skills in magic.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even Shaiyan, who opposed him, could only partially handle high-level magic with his mortal body. The mages of the Magic Tower couldn't even come close to him in terms of magical talent.

But in the end, Taesan acquired that title.

[Title: Great Mage] [A magnificent and exceptional mage who has acquired unparalleled talent.] [Magic +200] [Mana +10,000] [Intelligence +3,000] [The proficiency of magic-related skills will increase exponentially.] [He can interfere with his magic within the realm permitted by Zelvand.]

The title of a mage, and the related numbers, skyrocketed.

What was astonishing was the next effect.

The proficiency increase was exponential. Although it was a very short sentence, the value it contained was inexpressible.

The increase in magic proficiency was tremendous. Just looking at the fact that the proficiency of the frozen world, which he had been using continuously, still hadn't reached 60%, made it clear."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Since intermediate magic is like that, advanced magic is even more profound. The mastery of the Great Collapse still hasn't exceeded 10%. Honestly, I thought I wouldn't be able to reach 100% even after clearing the labyrinth.

But now, I've obtained a title that doubles my speed.

"Is this okay?"

"If you're going to take on the name of a great magician, you should at least do that much. It doesn't matter."

Zelvand said it as if it was obvious. Taesan gratefully accepted it.

"That means you can interfere with magic..."

"The magicians have created various changes to my magic."

It seemed like he was talking about magic overlap and magic release, similar to the magic created by Akisha, the magician who wanted to take revenge on Shaiyan.

"You'll also be able to intervene in that way. It's not a big deal. You've already created a forbidden magic, so it's similar to that. With my permission, you'll be able to handle it more stably from now on."

"Thank you."

I was able to handle magic with a more stable sense of sacredness and boundaries. That was also a satisfying reward.

"That's all I can give you. My role is over."

Zelvand's presence began to fade away.

He was leaving the earth and returning to his own realm."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Didn't you say there was something to talk about?"

"It's not that big of a deal."

Zhelvand said with a nonchalant tone, as if it was no big deal.

"Tae-san, you defeated the seventh fragment of the World Destroyer. That's definitely a remarkable feat, but... it's not impossible either."

Anyone can handle a fragment of the Divine Punishment once they become a Transcender.

"But you, you did something that no one else could do. Do you know what that is?"

"......Is it the blocking of power?"

"That's correct."

Zhelvand laughed.

"It's different from a simple monster or a servant. That's a fragment of the Divine Punishment itself. The Divine Punishment needs to directly recover its power."

When the fragment was defeated.

The power inside it tried to return to the other side of the world.

It was supposed to be absorbed by the main body of the World Destroyer.

But Tae-san blocked it with his boundary and spiritual power surge.

"We also tried to block the power transfer, but no Transcender could stop it. The immutable is beyond the laws, but you blocked that power and stole it."

Zhelvand smiled, genuinely pleased, with a full-faced smile.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You have tarnished the honor of the noble family."

Zhelvand's face was extremely delighted.

He was one of the transcenders who often showed emotional changes, but there was a sense of distance somewhere. It was as if a god was mimicking a human.

But it wasn't like that now.

What Zhelvand was showing now was his true emotion.

"You are the only one who can end this tedious war. It's a story like a dream, but it's not impossible."

He smiled faintly and waved his hand.

"Then, let's meet again next time."

With that, Zhelvand disappeared.

Taesan gazed at the remaining aura for a moment.

* * *

Although Zhelvand had said something, Taesan didn't think about it for now. It was a story that was too far-fetched, just like Zhelvand's words.

He needed to confirm what he had obtained right now.

[World Destroyer's Blood Drop] [Noble Family's Blood Drop. It shouldn't exist in this world, but it was forcibly implemented by a special power.]

The power contained within was enormous and thick.

Even Taesan, who had become a god on earth, couldn't easily understand it.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If I use the boundary line, I might be able to create something with this."

"Hmm."

Taesan thought about the materials he had.

The fragments of the World Destroyer's blood.

The crystallized divine blood.

And the fragments of the divine and sacred artifacts.

It was as if the materials were paired up, just like he had planned.

"I think I can handle it now."

Taesan took out the divine blood and examined it. All the things he didn't know about the divine blood before were now in his head.

Now, he could handle the divine blood as a material.

The fragments of the divine and sacred artifacts were also imperfect, but he could handle them to some extent.

"What can I do with this?"

The materials were too high-level, so it was rather troublesome.

After thinking for a moment, Taesan put the materials away. He planned to visit Half-ran and Cos-lun first. Although the two of them might not be able to handle such high-level materials, as blacksmiths, they might be able to provide some information.

[Special Passive Skill: Resistance to the Law Beyond] [Proficiency: 1%] [Resistance and rejection to things that exist beyond the law. Can slightly resist things that distort the law.]

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The fragment of Gosin intervened in Taesan's skill.

The attack invalidation was triggered strangely, and the forced fall's activation was cancelled.

It seemed to be a skill that allowed some resistance to that. Since we would be facing Gosin directly many times in the future, it was a meaningful skill.

[Transcendence: Self-Immutability] [Proficiency: ^@] [Unchanging against !@$, gaining strong resistance against !@$%. Still, it's just a fragment, and ^$$ remains.]

The fragment of the World Destroyer's power, stolen from him. Transcendence [Self-Immutability].

It was the second Transcendence obtained after the black one.

The eternal, unbreakable faith was a bit different from the Transcendence skill category.

As it was a skill directly related to Gosin, it was difficult to understand its contents.

However, its effect was imaginable. From the moment I obtained the skill, I felt a strange sensation in my body.

Taesan called out to Diana.

"Please attack me with all your might."

"......You, Taesan-nim?"

"There's something I need to confirm."

Diana was slightly taken aback, but she obediently picked up her weapon."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But even if I attack, it won't mean anything, will it......"

"You don't have to worry about that."

Taesan had perfectly suppressed his divine power, which was wrapped around him.

At this moment, Taesan was in a completely defenseless state.

Diana hesitated for a moment, but soon followed Taesan's words. She also knew about the existence of attack nullification.

"Huuuuu."

Taking a short breath, she launched herself at Taesan, unleashing all her skills and attacking him with full force.

It was her ultimate killing blow. Even an S-grade monster would fall with a single hit.

No matter how much Taesan had obtained divine power, Diana was a being who had crossed the boundary. In this state, she couldn't help but take damage.

The sword tip touched Taesan.

At that moment, Diana felt a strong repulsion.

Kaang!

"Ugh!"

The sword bounced back, and Diana was pushed back, unable to withstand the force.

She grasped her wrist, staring blankly at Taesan.

"......Taesan-nim? Something's... something's weird."

It wasn't just a matter of being overwhelmed by power.

There was something mysterious.

It was a sensation she had never felt before.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Thank you."

Taesan revived her with his divine power.

Taesan went to Belldengkia as well. "Attack me with all your might, using magic," he said.

Belldengkia agreed. He unleashed his full power and attacked Taesan.

The wind, fire, and flames combined into a single magic attack, pouring down on Taesan.

Taesan lightly stretched out his hand and grasped it.

The magic was distorted.

"Pah!"

Belldengkia's magic disappeared, leaving only remnants. Belldengkia's pupils enlarged.

"What, what?"

It wasn't that his magic was overwhelmed by a stronger power. It was a separate phenomenon.

"Is this it?"

Taesan glanced at his own body before approaching Belldengkia.

"Defense magic."

"What, what?"

Belldengkia reflexively cast a defense spell. The magic circles overlapped, forming a single layer.

It was a magic that could block even an immortal's attack, one that he had poured all his power into.

Taesan reached out to that defense magic.

"Oooh."

Just that was enough to distort the magic circle.

"What, what in the world..."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Veldeckia couldn't understand. He knew that Taesan was strong. He also knew that his strongest magic could be blown away with just a punch.

But this was completely different.

As soon as his magic touched Taesan, it was distorted and warped.

He refused to allow it.

He rejected and denied any weak power or force that dared to intervene in his body.

Taesan poured power into his hand. The magic circle was sucked in and distorted, and soon disappeared.

There was no wave of power or aftermath.

It was as if it was denied, and Veldeckia and Diana's powers were rejected the moment they touched Taesan.

Self-negation.

The effect was a denial of the world's laws that interfered with the caster."
