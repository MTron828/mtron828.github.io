Chapter 612

612. Easy Mode. Third Return After (6)

I hadn't seen the skill acquisition system window in a while.

In normal easy mode, you wouldn't even get four skills, but he was an irregular.

However, acquiring any skill wasn't as joyful as it was at this moment.

"Hahaha."

A laugh burst out. The effect of the skill wasn't that important. What was important was one thing: his prediction was correct.

He had finally found the answer.

He laughed and took a break. He had been avoiding the extreme limits for over a day, and his mind was already at its limit.

But despite that, he was uncontrollably happy. It was the result of investing his mind for nearly four months. He felt like he couldn't hold on if he didn't check it right away.

Taesan didn't forcefully suppress his instincts.

"Skill window."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Special Activation Skill: Untouchable Distance] [Mana Consumption: 10] [Proficiency: 1%] [Can be activated by designating a single target. The target will never be physically affected. This skill cannot be cancelled at will. After activation, 5 mana is consumed every second. If all mana is consumed, the skill's activation will be cancelled.]

And then, it became clear what he had obtained.

A thick smile spread across Taesan's lips.

Untouchable Distance.

This was the unique skill he had obtained.

He slowly read the skill's description. Although the effect was quite complex, unlike ordinary skills, it wasn't impossible to understand.

'A target designation skill.'

A skill that required a target to activate. Since it was a 1:1 skill, there was nothing particularly special about it.

The important part was the next sentence.

'The target will never be physically affected.'

Never be physically affected.

The system's statements, which had been written in the labyrinth, had never lied before.

In other words, 'never' meant exactly that.

It meant that no matter who the opponent was, they couldn't land an attack on Taesan.

Even if the opponent was in hard mode, alone mode, or a monster, it wouldn't make a difference.

The smile on Taesan's lips grew thicker.

This was it.

A skill that could transcend the limits of easy mode by utilizing the system.

Note: "이지 모드" is translated to "easy mode", but it's possible that it could also mean "easy difficulty" or "casual mode", depending on the context of the story.

His prediction was perfectly correct. Taesan was so happy that he couldn't be happier. He felt like throwing a party just for himself.

Taesan, who had been rejoicing for a while, slowly calmed down his emotions.

He had been happy enough. Now it was time to calmly analyze the effects of the skill.

"Physical influence."

Not all attacks were ineffective.

There was a limitation to the physical influence.

It meant that it didn't apply to attacks from magic or items.

"Is it because I only dodged physical attacks?"

The wolf wasn't a special enemy that used magic. It just ran and bit like a beast.

If it were an enemy that used magic, would I have gotten a skill that only dodged magic?

It was possible. Taesan, who had organized his thoughts, continued to verify the effects of the skill.

[This skill cannot be canceled at will.]

"Uncancelable... I see."

This was a pretty big penalty.

The skill's effect wasn't to ignore the opponent's physical attacks.

Its effect also applied to Taesan himself.

Taesan also couldn't inflict physical damage on the opponent.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was a state where mutual interference was impossible. Taesan could use magic wands or potions to deal damage, but it didn't seem to have much significance.

In a state where mutual interference was impossible, canceling skills was also impossible.

The biggest problem was the consumption of mana.

[This skill consumes 5 mana per second after activation.]

5.

It wasn't a small number. Taesan's current mana was 140. With 10 mana consumed per skill activation, it meant he could only use it for up to 26 seconds.

And Taesan had a hunch.

From now on, the skills he would acquire would all have significant mana consumption.

He had to find a way to increase and recover his mana as much as possible. Taesan added another goal.

The rough understanding was over. Now it was time to directly confirm how it would work.

He recovered his mana at the Fountain of Life and moved to the next room.

A new wolf charged towards Taesan. Taesan gazed at the wolf with a calm expression and activated his skill.

[You have activated an untouchable distance.]

And at the moment the wolf's attack was about to reach him.

Taesan's body moved automatically.

He dodged the wolf's attack by a hair's breadth.

"Hmm?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan was taken aback for a moment. His body moved on its own, regardless of his will.

It was the same afterwards. Every time the wolf attacked, Taesan's body automatically dodged.

The evasive maneuvers he had performed against the wolf were being perfectly implemented as a skill.

It was a strange sensation. Taesan grasped his sword. He swung it at the wolf that was charging towards him.

But the sword didn't reach.

The space itself seemed to warp, and Taesan's attack missed the wolf by a hair's breadth.

"This is the feeling."

His body was moving on its own. And neither of them could have any influence on each other.

It was an effect just as described.

[Ker, kuhng!]

The wolf was flustered and swung its claws wildly, but they didn't reach Taesan.

In its short monster life, the wolf was extremely confused by this unprecedented experience.

Meanwhile, 26 seconds passed and all of Taesan's mana was consumed. The wolf's attack finally hit Taesan.

[Keng!]

The wolf was delighted. But before it could fully savor its joy, Taesan stabbed it in the neck.

Taesan, who had defeated the wolf, fell into thought.

"The restriction is greater than I thought."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This is a skill that targets one person, and when that person attacks, it automatically dodges. In a 1-on-1 battle, it was almost useless.

Moreover, it couldn't even attack. Although items or magic wands could be used, it was meaningless. In reality, it was a skill that only served to stall.

And since it couldn't be canceled until all mana was consumed, there was no going back.

That's why Taesan, who had returned to the past with Uroboros's crystal, couldn't get close to the enemy - it was because of this reason.

For him, who had the Ability Sword, physical attacks were the main focus. If that was impossible, it was like being tied up and forced to fight, and in the deeper levels, most enemies didn't value physical strength much.

Moreover, if it wasn't a 1-on-1 situation, it was meaningless, and Taesan couldn't even attack.

Since the body automatically dodged, it was hard to lead the battle according to Taesan's intentions. And since canceling the activation was impossible, it was too difficult to use.

In reality, it was similar to a counterattack and a forced duel.

Since it couldn't be canceled until the mana was consumed, it was a skill that had more risk than return for him."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It takes a considerable amount of time to acquire a skill, so it's better to acquire another skill during that time and become stronger. That was his judgment, looking back on the past.

He didn't realize it yet, but the skills he would acquire in the future were almost all like that.

They had penalties equivalent to their effects, making them difficult to use freely, and could only be used in specific situations.

Skills that weren't like that were few and far between.

"Are all skills like this?"

Great power comes with great responsibility. In his case, it was a penalty rather than a responsibility. It wasn't hard to understand when you thought about the effects.

There were many restrictions.

It was a difficult skill to use properly.

But even considering that, it was an extremely good skill.

It could withstand up to 26 seconds. If the enemy was a physical attacker, no matter how strong they were, they could be defeated with Taesan. Even if they were an enemy that could kill him in a matter of seconds.

Taesan remembered that.

He had solo-killed numerous hard mode players, and even the strongest hard mode players couldn't last 5 seconds against the monster alone.

Taesan could withstand 26 seconds against that monster.

This had enormous significance on Earth.

A dry laugh escaped his lips."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Dozens of skill ideas flashed through his mind.

"This one's conditions are hard to meet, and this one's possible... but the penalty's going to be huge. This one's okay."

He muttered to himself. From now on, he planned to descend into the labyrinth very slowly, taking his time. Since each floor had various monsters and conditions, he intended to acquire as many skills as possible from there.

"I'll get at least two more skills before the next return."

He would survive.

It wasn't just about clinging to life and crawling on the ground to survive, but about defeating enemies, becoming stronger than anyone, and trampling them with confidence.

Taesan began to descend into the labyrinth with excitement."
