74. Floor 13, Guide of Sin (Part 1)

Lebebvas, who alternated between ghosts and Taesan, muttered with a wrinkled face.

"I thought 10th floor was the end."

"I thought so too. But apparently more floors were added."

Taesan looked at Lebebvas with suspicion. Upon Taesan's words, Lebebvas realized.

"So that's how it is? Pathetic."

He chuckled.

He mocked and laughed.

"If you died, you'd go beautifully. I'm not sorry for following you pathetically."

[Me?]

The ghost sneered.

[You're playing around. The one who talks well who pisses and pees. Was your hiding like a rat in front of me an act?]

"You!"

Lebebvas distorted his face. He smiled briefly, showing his feelings.

"I shouldn't bother wasting my time on the dead."

The ghost ignored him as if there were no answers. Lebebvas spoke to Taesan.

"Nice to meet you. Are you a newcomer?"

Taesan nodded. Lebebvas sighed, and was
"Long time no see, newbie. I was scouting because of this, but I never expected to actually see it..."

Lebebvas muttered and shrugged his shoulders.

"I'm a guide of sin. You know about us, right?"

"Yes, I do. You're the largest group here."

Both Taesan and the ghost had mentioned them before. Lebebvas smirked at Taesan's words.

"Yeah, that's us. The strongest group."

"Well..."

There was a hesitation in Taesan's voice. Before Lebebvas could hear Taesan's muttering, he brightened up and spoke.

"So shall we discuss..."

"Mumble mumble."

"...go..."

Zombies pounded on the door. Lebebvas frowned as the conversation was interrupted.

"Come to think of it, these guys were here. Annoying."

The zombies didn't stay in one place but wandered around aimlessly.

Seemingly annoyed by the zombies, Lebebvas had a good idea and took out a horn from his inventory.

"Bwooooooo."

[The Area-of-Effect Horn has been activated. Monsters within range approach.]

"I don't like being disturbed, so I'll handle them instead. Okay?"
With a sly grin, Lebebvas spoke, showing no intention of listening to any responses.

Before long, zombies began to appear one by one, filling the room. Except for the boss, every monster from the 13th floor had shown up.

Among them were some zombies stronger than the ordinary ones. There were literally dozens of them, but Lebebvas remained confident, wearing gauntlets with a self-assured expression.

He swung at the face of the zombie in the front.

Crunch.

The zombie's face crumpled and flew off. The zombies who had taken the initiative stumbled towards Lebebvas.

Seeing the zombies attempting to gnaw at his flesh, Lebebvas chuckled.

"Where did you lot come from!"

Lebebvas moved his hands roughly. The zombies staggered and flew away.

Zombies bet on quantity in battle, but they were monsters from the 13th floor nonetheless. Their grip twisted rocks, and their movements were incredibly fast.

Lebebvas avoided and blocked them all, dealing with them one by one. Trampling over the zombies, Lebebvas shouted with a triumphant air.

"You can't defeat me with these kinds of losers!"

Something felt off.

Taesan quietly watched Lebebvas.

Strong.
However, that was it. It wasn't awe-inspiring. Instead, it was irritating.

"Who does this guy think he is, cleaning up other people's monsters?"

Every zombie Lebebvas struck down had been a monster he was supposed to defeat. It was a situation where one could only incur losses in terms of experience points, item drops, and skill proficiency.

Normal monsters would respawn, but it wouldn't happen quickly. In fact, it was safe to say there were practically no ordinary monsters on the 13th floor.

"That's enough."

If it was about exchanging information, it wasn't something he couldn't accept. Perhaps he could even receive something better. Taesan gripped his sword.

Clang.

Taesan also joined the fight. However, his movements were slower and weaker than before. Deliberately restrained, he engaged in some direct confrontations with zombies, dispatching them.

"You triggered Evade."

The zombie's grasp twisted. Taesan swiftly slashed its neck with his sword. Watching closely, Lebebvas exclaimed in admiration.

"Oh, you can Evade too? Not bad!"

Lebebvas remarked from his vantage point above. Taesan swung his sword without reacting, as he had intended.
Lebebvas chuckled as he leaped among the zombies.

"[Lebebvas activates Strong Strike.]"

Crunch.

The zombie's head completely caved in. Lebebvas triggered a skill amidst swinging claws that struck from all directions.

"[Lebebvas activates Counter.]"

Moving swiftly, he smashed through the zombies. Amidst chunks of flesh, Lebebvas smirked.

"How's that?"

No matter how you looked at it,

I didn't know what to do.

If you were 42, it was strange to struggle on the 13th floor. It felt like seeing a middle school student moan after solving an elementary school problem.

Looking at such emotions, Lebebvas clicked his tongue.

"What a boring guy. You won't survive long like that, you know?"

There was a light threat, but Taesan just chuckled.

He started dealing with the zombies again. Unknowingly, they were reduced by almost half.

"[It's your choice.]"

The ghost said calmly.

[Do what you want.]

"I'm thinking about it."

Murmuring, he swung his sword. Thirty minutes later, the battle came to an end.

"It's over. I worked up a sweat for the first time in a while."
Lebebvas stretches with a refreshed expression on his face. He glances at Taesan.

"Not bad, huh?"

Observing Taesan's fight from the sidelines, it wasn't bad at all. Surviving up to the 13th floor proved he was capable.

"With you, we might even get clearance up to the 20th floor."

It was as if it was natural for Taesan to belong with them.

Instead of pointing it out, Taesan asked.

"You seem to have something on your mind."

"I do. It's because I've been scouting around, bothered by this. What's your name?"

"Taesan."

"Taesan... Interesting name. Where are you from in the world?"

Lebebvas asked with a smirk, then a serious face.

"Do you consider joining the Guides of Sin?"

---

In the labyrinth, countless humans from numerous worlds come in, driven by the winds of wizards.

Called adventurers, they descend here for their aspirations and grow stronger bit by bit.

Where people gather, groups naturally form.

Among them, the Guides of Sin are the largest group of adventurers within the All Zone Mode.
"They are distributed from the lower levels to the deep levels and you're bound to encounter them frequently," Itaeyeon had said.

And there was something she and the ghost had in common.

'Those who have given up on conquest.'

Those who are obsessed with justifying themselves on that topic.

They don't try to clear the labyrinth. They think of this place as a finished product and settle in.

Lebebvas said emphatically,

"We can endlessly grow stronger here. Do you realize what a great blessing that is?"

"I do."

Lilith. She had no talent for magic. But coming here, she could at least learn the basics of magic.

Judging by her reaction, it must have been unimaginable in the outside world.

In a way, Taesan was the same. If it weren't for the labyrinth's system, he would still have been an ordinary person. Lebebvas continued to articulate.

"That's right. We've already received more than enough grace."

You can obtain power here that you can't grasp from outside.

"Thinking arrogantly about breaking through or clearing this place on such topics? That's really a clueless statement. He's a bastard who doesn't even know grace."
Lebebvas continued to speak sharply, and Taesan looked at him intently.

"So are you saying you're giving up on clearing?"

"If I say 'give up,' it sounds a bit off. The correct answer is to let go. Accept the grace from the labyrinth and not ask for more than that."

To Lebebvas speaking confidently, Taesan asked,

"Didn't you come here expecting something?"

Conquering the labyrinth grants one wish.

Most adventurers come here hoping for that. Lebebvas flinched at those words.

"Well, I used to think that way, but that's just the naivety of youth. Childish fantasies."

Lebebvas said with a twisted expression,

"And this place wasn't meant to be cleared in the first place."

"Why do you think that?"

"If you've come this far, you should know, right? Damn gods are trying to kill us with their damn trials. The hidden places scattered around here exist only to defeat us. That guy behind you died that way just now."

[The ones we killed sure talk a lot.]

"You think we killed you? You've got quite an imagination."
The ghost seemed unwilling to respond to Lebebvas' words, as if not wanting to speak at all. Lebebvas looked at Taesan again with a serious expression.

"So the adventurers who come here have formed a group. That's what guides them through the path of sin."

"Instead of descending into the labyrinth, they focus on becoming stronger as a group."

"That's right."

Lebebvas nodded emphatically.

"We uphold order. We create laws and govern here."

Lebebvas mentioned laws. Laws meant there were penalties for those who violated them.

Though he might have tried to conceal it, the group's nature was evident in every tone.

"Is that so."

Taesan tapped the wall with his finger.

"I'm not planning to force anything on you right now, so think about it calmly."

Lebebvas pondered over whether Taesan was considering joining the path of sin, but it was completely different.

"Other adventurers meet."

Lee Taeyeon and Kang Junhyuk. Players of the Alone mode never meet. They clear the labyrinth in different dimensions.

It meant someone had been forced to drop out.

Was it done by a god, or something that invaded the Earth?

It didn't have much significance, but it made him curious.
"If we belong to them, we must naturally refuse that quest."

Lebebvas pointed to the ghost.

"He's the one who violated the law and attacked us. We can't take him with us."

"The law."

Taesan muttered.

"I have a question. I heard that even guides to the path of sin must be allowed to become stronger. Is that true?"

"..."

Lebebvas said with a troubled face.

"That's correct."

And quickly added.

"But it's not what you're thinking. The further down you go, the more dangerous it gets here. So it's a minimal measure for safety."

"Words sound good. Isn't this just making it impossible to even challenge?"

Lebebvas' face stiffened.

Taesan chuckled softly.

"You mentioned the law. Do you have the right to make those laws? The wizards and transcendents who designed this place even gave freedom. Yet you adventurers manage this place?"

"You refuse?"

"I can give you a definite answer."

With a stiff voice, Taesan lazily moved his finger.

"I dislike you."

The complacent ones.

The ones who gave up.
Those who rationalize themselves on such topics.

Those who even pull others down to their level.

Even Itaeyeon, even that coward, gritted their teeth and cleared this place. Achieved it. But they are not like them. They forsake the challenges and courage that should rightly be shown here and pursue only safety, sucking dry what they can and trying to escape.

"Now I understand why Maria dislikes you."

The gods settled here to witness the hero's battles and struggles. The guide to the path of sin, bent on self-destruction, is a despicable existence even to the gods.

"It's similar to me too."

"I don't quite understand what you mean... so is that a refusal?"

Lebebvas' voice was icy.

Strength filled his clenched fist. Taesan grinned broadly.

"Yeah."

"Too bad."

With his reply, Lebebvas moved.

He had two reasons for scouting to find recruits. One was to lure them as guides to the path of sin.

The other was to kill those who resist rejection before they become too strong.

Like an explosion, he charged forward and swung his fist at Taesan's head.

*Thunk.*
However, he was blocked by Taesan's hand. As Lebebvas's fist clenched in Taesan's hand, his eyes shook.

"Huh?"

Lebebvas is an adventurer permitted to clear up to the 20th floor. Naturally, adventurers of the 13th floor possess formidable strength that he cannot easily oppose.

He had intended to knock him out with a single blow, but Taesan merely moved his hand to block the attack.

Thunk.

"Gah!"

As Taesan exerted force, Lebebvas felt pressure and pain in his hand. He roughly shook Taesan off. Glaring at him as if unable to believe, he spoke.

"You..."

"Those who break the law should be punished, right? Give it a try. Punish me. Whether you can or not."

Mockingly, Taesan drew his sword.
