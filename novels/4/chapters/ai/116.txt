Chapter 117

117. The Second Return, Gathering (1)

[Skill Effect: Additive] [MP Consumption: 30] [Deals double damage.]

A very brief explanation panel.

There was no expertise. A simple explanation that doubles the damage didn't need to exist.

Tae-san wielded his sword towards the remaining magic.

[You have activated Additive.] [Dealt 501 damage to Dark Spirit 12.]

It exceeded 500. It was a damage that had never been seen before.

Tae-san wielded his sword again.

[You have activated Rampage.] [You have activated Continuous Attack.] [Dealt 912 damage to Dark Spirit 25.] [Dealt 498 damage to Dark Spirit 25.]

The total damage of the angelic forces has been added. The damage multiplier is the same for skills that double the damage. The efficiency of Rampage has also increased significantly.

[This is it.]

The ghost couldn't even let out a sigh. All that came out was a faint smile. Tae-san laughed satisfiedly.

"It's faster than I thought."
Here is the translation:

The conditions were too good. The Dark Spirit was just the right size to cut off with a sword, and it was so round and round that it was hard to create variables. And the fact that all the monsters looked the same was a big advantage.

There were hundreds of monsters of different kinds, each with different sizes.

Thinking about how long it took to get to level them up, it was like a wasted year.

I invested all my time in just leveling up, and it took a year. But I shortened it to six days. It was a tremendous time-saving.

[I wonder... how I... did this.]

The ghost muttered to himself in a faint voice.

[And what's the point of this skill...?]

"Even I was surprised."

Increase damage by doubling it with the "Addition" skill. It was an unreasonable and impossible-to-learn skill. I thought, "What's the point of this skill, even if Taesan learned it?"

But Valvator's words made me sure. The skill was automatically created by the Mystic System, and it was designed to fit the situation.

In other words, most of what he was thinking of could be created.

"Very good."

Taesan smiled happily. He was eager to be happy, but he didn't have the time.
Here is the translation of the text:

Now, there are only two hours left. Tae-san rushed through the labyrinth at lightning speed. After processing almost all of the 25th floor, his level rose.

[Your level has risen.] [You have become the strongest.]

The physical and magical energy consumed during the addition process have been fully recovered.

Tae-san immediately returned to the shop owner. He sold unnecessary equipment and materials to earn gold and bought recovery potions for physical and magical energy.

“It was a close call.”

After preparing, a space began to open up in front of Tae-san.

The expanded space covered Tae-san.

When the view changed, Tae-san found himself back on Earth.

The dark sky. A crack stretched across it.

It had been a long time, indeed.

“Ah, ah, ah!”

“Don't want to!”

“Do, I'll go back!”

The people who returned with Tae-san screamed. As he looked around, he saw the city hall that he had arrived at earlier.

[Start of special quest] [Prepare for the next quest at the city hall for the next 24 hours.]

A quest window appeared.

Tae-san moved.

“Hello?”

Tae-san first visited the calm and composed Itae-yeon and Gang-joon-hyeok, who were looking around.

[Are you still alive?]

“Ah.”

“Brother! It's been a long time!”

Note: The translation is in Simplified Chinese, as per the rules.
Here is the translation of the text:

Jang Jun-hyeok had a red face. Taesan, who was rushing towards him, asked, "How far have you fallen?"

"I barely made it to the 8th floor, but I didn't receive the trial of O-ma. I was almost called back because time was too tight."

"I was similar too."

"Really?"

[You activated scouting.] [Lee Tae-yeon] [Level: 14] [Health: 412] [Equipped with sword and shield] [A coward.] [Jang Jun-hyeok] [Level: 14] [Health: 432] [Equipped with sword and shield] [A brave and fearless person.]

At level 14, Taesan entered the 8th floor when he was level 20 and had a health of around 800. Compared to that, there was definitely a difference.

However, he was not weak.

If they were the same now, they could easily win against a player in hard mode.

"Let's talk about this later."

"Okay."

Lee Tae-yeon quickly led the people away.

"Ah......"

"No, no......"

Among the players, there were also those who showed determination. However, most were consumed by fear and anxiety.

24 hours.
Here is the translation of the text:

Within that time, she had to discipline herself and finish preparing.

"Ugh......"

Kim Hui-yeon clenched her forehead. She felt like her head was about to crack.

"It's really going to be a maze."

While others might take 24 hours to calm down or rest, she had no time for that. Kim Hui-yeon gazed blankly at her desk, her face filled with despair.

"How am I going to finish all this......"

In front of her were countless documents.

Surviving players, normal players, hard mode players. Their numbers and approximate stats. And equipment, battle willpower.

She had to separate everything and arrange it according to its role. And since it took 12 hours to make the documents, she had to finish it within 12 hours.

Jin Jung-geun smiled and helped with the document organization.

"There's no way. My brother entrusted this to my mom, didn't he?"

"It's too much. There are people who can do it better than me."

"There aren't any."

"Ah!"

The voice from behind her made Kim Hui-yeon jump up from her chair. She barely managed to calm herself down after recognizing the owner of the voice.
Here is the translation of the text:

"...why did you come in through the window?"

"This is more convenient, I don't want to go back and forth through the hallway, it's a bother."

"Ah, I see."

She muttered to herself and sat back down, but was secretly shocked.

The floor she was assigned to was the highest floor in the city hall. As she descended the labyrinth, she became even stronger, but she couldn't climb up without holding onto the wall, as the height was too great.

It was as if she had jumped up to that height with a single leap.

"Really, you're not human."

"Now that you're here, it's new."

"Brother. You've arrived."

"Yes."

The mountain received greetings and scanned the documents.

"How many?"

"Yes. There are a lot."

Kim Hui-yeon muttered to herself as she sorted through the documents, her hand slightly trembling as she held the paper.

"But... it's fewer than last time."

Even a quick glance showed that it was less than 30,000, a significant decrease from the first return. Many people had died since her first descent into the labyrinth, it meant.

Kim Hui-yeon clenched her lips. She was an administrator. She couldn't just be sad and let things be. She had to calculate the decrease and adjust accordingly.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Is there anyone else besides you? I'm talking about the department head."

"If I'm the department head, I'll be able to persuade him well. That's perfect, isn't it?"

"That's not what I said."

Taesan glared at Kim Whiyan's troubled expression, biting her lip.

Taesan cut off Kim Whiyan's complaining.

"You're the only one."

Kim Whiyan was out of the question. The matter had been settled in the previous world.

"As I've said before, I'm not capable of managing people and giving orders. Even Lee Taeyoon or Kang Junhyeok are the same."

It wasn't a matter of not being able to do it. The problem was efficiency and ability. In his case, it was more efficient to move directly, and Lee Taeyoon was too passive.

As for Kang Junhyeok, he was too young to be a focal point. Taesan looked at Jung Jung-geun.

"He's better at being a supporting role than a manager."

"That's my calling."

Jung Jung-geun proudly shrugged his shoulders. Kim Whiyan looked troubled.

"But still, I think there's someone better than me..."

"There might be someone."

There are people who surpass him here. Among them, there's definitely someone who manages better than Kim Whiyan.
Here is the translation of the text:

"But a weakling cannot be a pivot. You know that, right?"

"That's... right."

The politicians and citizens' committee members.

They were weak. They didn't dare to take a step forward, so they didn't know the power of the strong. Therefore, they were shouting about punishing the Taesan, but they didn't know how to do it.

Even if it wasn't like that, hard-mode players wouldn't follow them easily. It was natural for the voices of those with power to grow louder. Someone with the ability to control the situation had to become the pivot.

"You're just a hard-mode player at best. You're the answer."

The third return.

After the incident caused by Choi Jung-hyuk, there were only about 2,000 people left.

And a quest was given. Go to Seoul by defeating monsters.

They had to head to Seoul with a number of less than 2,000. At that time, even E-grade and D-grade monsters appeared, crushing and killing them. Taesan was also at a level that was generally considered strong, and Lee Tae-yeon had little difference between hard mode and normal mode. Even most of the hard-mode players who were not many died, and everyone gave up their lives.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Kim Hwi-yeon had saved most of the players and sent them to Seoul.

There were many who had held the position of leader until the end of humanity, but according to Tae-san, Kim Hwi-yeon was the most outstanding. If she had been there, they would have been able to hold out for a little longer.

Tae-san muttered to himself in a low tone.

"What, we'll find out in a few days?"

"What?"

"This side's story. What about the other hard mode players who aren't here? The ones from other regions."

"...I think there were some over there too."

Kim Hwi-yeon understood what Tae-san was saying.

On the first return, they gathered at the Ansan City Hall. Everyone who gathered was someone who had lived in Ansan.

In the southern part of Gyeonggi Province alone, there were cities such as Seongnam, Gwacheon, Gunpo, and Suwon, and many more. It was hard to count the number of cities nationwide.

Hard mode players summoned from other regions, excluding Ansan.

It was a question of what kind of conversation they had with them in the labyrinth.

"Is there no reason to meet?"
Here is the translation of the text:

They had to leave Anyang and move to another area, and there was no time or leisure for it. They were in a hurry to survive in this place.

Kim Hwi-yeon didn't care much about it either, thinking that it was inevitable to meet in a maze and that they wouldn't be able to meet outside of it.

Tae-san cracked his neck.

"Let's talk about it first."

"They're all preparing for this and that, but no one has asked about the details. I'm also busy preparing."

"That's fine then."

Tae-san spoke calmly.

"Work hard. There's not much time left."

"I... need help..."

"I have my own tasks to complete."

Tae-san left like the wind, going out the window. Kim Hwi-yeon's face fell as he looked at the piled up documents.

* * *

This quest is a 24-hour preparation quest with no restriction on movement.

Tae-san left the city hall. He rushed through the ruined city to move to a place as close as possible to the gap in the sky.

Clunking sound.

The gap in the sky was spreading like gold.

The gap was growing bigger and bigger, and it was possible that even giant monsters would emerge from it.

"It's definitely bigger."

The second return to the previous world. The gap was bigger than it was the last time.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The power is fluctuating and unstable."

I had the chance to directly meet the gods and feel their power, so I could sense the power beyond the crack more clearly.

The power within the crack was slowly expanding. It was as if something powerful was about to descend.

It was not a D-level power.

It was probably a C-level or B-level power.

"'Those rotten people'."

Tai Shan scolded. He glanced at the crack and then returned.

The ghost who had been quiet until then spoke up.

"Why are you doing this annoying thing?"

"What do you mean?"

[Yes, they are strong. I thought that was the limit until now, but after seeing the power of the gods, I realized I was mistaken.]

Tai Shan ripped apart a star. It was even despite the same god resisting, as it was said. They were the ones who possessed such power.

[If I had expected, I could have torn apart this small world in an instant, but why did you create this crack, summon me, and give me a quest instead?]

"'Hmm'."

That was also a question for him.
Here is the translation of the text:

The gods were strong and fierce beings. If they were to eliminate those who had chased them away and punish the world, there was no need to do such a tedious thing. They could just crush everything and walk away.

But the gods were waiting patiently, as if they had mercy. They matched their strength with the monsters and gave them time.

"Did I say I destroyed 258 worlds in 12 years?"

Even considering their strength, it was a relatively slow pace. A ghostly being spoke in a ambiguous tone, letting out a faint sigh.

[Are the gods of the labyrinth intervening?]

"That's the most likely possibility."

In order to hinder the gods who were seeking revenge, the numerous gods of the labyrinth tried to restrain them. It was the most rational and likely course of action.

However, something was amiss. The gods who showed mercy were nowhere to be seen.

After thinking for a long time, the ghostly being gave up.

[I don't know. I'll find out if I go to the labyrinth.]

"Or maybe I'll figure it out soon."

The fissure was shaking, as if it was about to burst forth with something.

This return was definitely going to be different from the last one.

* * *

When the god returned to the heavenly court, everything was already settled. And 24 hours had also passed.
Here is the translation:

[SPECIAL QUEST START.] [This quest is a quest delivered to all players in the southern region of the game.] [Gather at Yongin City Hall.] [Time Limit: One week] [Reward: Distributed according to achievement upon returning to the labyrinth.]
