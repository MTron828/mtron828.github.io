Chapter 543

543. The Treasure Chest of the Usurper (1)

[Gang Tae-san[Elron] : What's going on?]

Lee Tae-yeon stuttered as he explained.

[Lee Tae-yeon[Elron] : I've gained control over physical strength itself.]

[Gang Tae-san[Elron] : Control? You're saying it's allowed to go that far?]

Tae-san was shocked. He had granted him power, but he didn't think it was possible to control physical strength itself. He didn't know it was allowed to go that far.

However, Lee Tae-yeon denied Tae-san's imagination.

[Lee Tae-yeon[Elron] : I think I misspoke. I've gained control, but there are clear limits. It's restricted to my own body, you know? It's like that. And that limit is also bound by the physical strength I can exert myself.]

[Daniel Darmond[Hard] : Still, the physical strength itself that can be drawn out has increased fundamentally. It's noticeable to that extent.]

[Lee Tae-yeon[Elron] : I've just obtained it, so I haven't fully grasped it yet, but there seem to be many more things like this...?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Let's hear a rough story. It seemed like a small concept could interfere with the physical laws. Like a mountain, it was impossible to control the physical laws of the world itself and exert full power in every action.

But even that was powerful enough.

All players on Earth gained the ability to interfere with the concept of the current world.

Lee Tae-yeon muttered in a tone of disbelief.

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone] : This kind of power... I got it without any cost. Taesan, you're giving this to all players on Earth?] [Gang Taesan [Alone] : Yes.] [Ichijo Eika [Hard] : Oh...].

A sigh of amazement flowed out.

Even Taesan was unexpected. He could give out this much power. It was strange considering the level of power that transcendents had given out so far.

After a moment of thought, Taesan understood the reason.

Transcendents who had settled in the labyrinth disliked the weak.

And what they wanted to see was a desperate struggle for life, not a scene where they easily gave out their power.

So they gave out their power very sparingly. To a mortal who pleased their heart, no, they wanted to give even more power within their limits.

But Taesan was different."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He wasn't interested in the desperate struggles of players fighting for their lives. His concern was their survival. There was no need to adjust his power to bring it down to their level.

"Was it possible to do this from the beginning?"

Taesan let out a dry laugh. It was a fact he hadn't known until he reached the pinnacle of his journey.

[Taesan [Alone] : Try writing it well. It'll be worth using.] [Taeyeon [Alone] : It doesn't seem like it's at a usable level…….]

Taeyeon was another transcender, a player who possessed Maria's power.

Therefore, she knew better than anyone the level of power Taesan had just given.

Her selective rejection was on the same level as his.

While its pure power was low, its physical control was a continuous ability that could be utilized differently from selective rejection.

In short, according to Taeyeon's judgment, if she utilized this skill alone correctly, even a normal mode player could go up against a hard mode player.

Of course, using power perfectly was impossible, but considering the difference in levels between the two modes, it was a miracle in itself.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Tae-yeon [Alone]: Is that okay?] [Kang Tae-san [Alone]: It doesn't matter.] [Tae-yeon [Alone]: That's true. Thank you. Thanks.] [Daniel Darmond [Hard]: Thank you…….] [Oliver Khan [Hard]: I have nothing to say.]

Words of gratitude are pouring in one by one.

When I checked the community, it was in a state of chaos in Easy and Normal modes.

Thinking about it, the skills they obtained were all insignificant and meaningless to Tae-san, who had no value or significance.

To them, Tae-san's power was an absolute force they had never seen before.

They were rejoicing and shouting Tae-san's name.

It wasn't a bad sight. Suddenly, Tae-san asked.

[Kang Tae-san [Alone]: What about dark magic?]

Thanks to the blessing of the gods, players on Earth could now wield dark magic.

However, the demons were all killed by Tae-san, and the dark magic had disappeared.

[Tae-yeon [Alone]: Something has changed. Can we control magic more freely now? It's become more refined than before.] [Kang Tae-san [Alone]: Did you give us a hand?]

It seemed that the gods had directly granted them control over magic. It was a good thing.

Tae-san thought deeply.

What else could he give to them?
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The rough story has ended.

However, Taesan didn't leave the community.

[Taesan [Alone]: Amelia, Gang Junhyeok, follow me.] [Amelia Airin [Alone]: Uh, okay?] [Gang Junhyeok [Alone]: Me?]

The two were taken aback. Taesan didn't mind and opened a chat window, calling the two.

[Amelia Airin [Alone]: What's going on?] [Gang Junhyeok [Alone]: Hyung, why are you like this? Is there a problem?]

The two asked anxiously. But Taesan didn't call them for that reason.

[Taesan [Alone]: You two are my apostles.]

Taesan and they were directly connected, and it was no exaggeration to say they were his direct subordinates.

[Taesan [Alone]: Has the effect of authority changed a bit for you two?] [Amelia Airin [Alone]: Ah, I was going to ask about that. I got nervous for nothing.]

Amelia, who had been momentarily flustered, said.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Amelia Airin[Alone]: It's hard to understand because there's no comparison... but I think I can do more than what Tae-yeon said.]

[Kang Jun-hyuk[Alone]: I can't express it well either... but it's different. It feels a bit more intense? It seems like there's some control around us.]

It seemed that as a servant, they had been granted more authority.

Tae-san, who had been reading their writings for a moment, made a decision.

[Kang Tae-san[Alone]: Just wait a moment.]

Tae-san summoned his authority. This time, it wasn't physical strength.

It was the boundary.

The beasts of the boundary began to gather inside Tae-san.

And he was going to bestow it upon his servant, who served him.

[Amelia Airin[Alone]: ……What?] [Kang Jun-hyuk[Alone]: Wait, just a moment.]

Feeling a strange sense of unease, Amelia and Kang Jun-hyuk were shocked. Tae-san commanded the beasts to possess them.

Grrr.

But the beasts refused.

As if they didn't want to leave Tae-san's side, Amelia and Kang Jun-hyuk seemed to reject the idea of being possessed.

"Shut up."

Tae-san scowled.

In the past, he might not have known, but the boundary was now his.

He was controlling it with his authority.

So, he wouldn't listen to any refusal. Tae-san forcefully suppressed the boundary.

Grrr.

The boundary let out a small cry of protest.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But there was no more resistance.

A tiny part of the beast, which couldn't even be compared to a speck of dust, had taken root in Amelia and Gang Joon-hyuk.

[Amelia Erlon: Wait a minute. Taesan. What is this...?] [Gang Joon-hyuk: Uh...?] [Gang Taesan: Did you get it?] [Gang Joon-hyuk: I got it, but... what is this?] [Gang Taesan: It's done.]

The inhabitants of this world could not accept the ash-colored power. They could not bring Taesan's boundary down to them.

Amelia and Gang Joon-hyuk were Taesan's apostles.

They were directly connected to his soul and were his direct life force.

Then, they could accept the ash-colored power.

That was the possibility they had brought down, and it was a success. Amelia and Gang Joon-hyuk had obtained the boundary, albeit slightly.

[Amelia Erlon: ...What kind of power is this? I don't know.] [Gang Taesan: You should try to figure it out yourself.]

Even Taesan didn't know exactly what kind of concept it was. The two of them had to directly handle the power and understand it for themselves.

'How will this turn out?'
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Taesan was curious. How could someone who wasn't Taesan handle the ash-colored power?

It could be meaningless, or it could have great significance. Either way, it wasn't a problem since it could be retrieved later.

So, the remaining authority was one thing: the usurpation of the divine throne.

But Taesan had given up on this part. Taesan couldn't possibly hand over a power that they couldn't fully control to someone else.

[Kang Taesan[Alone]: Try going down with all your might.] [Amelia Airin[Alone]: This is crazy. I don't know what to say. Thank you.] [Kang Junhyuk[Alone]: Thank you. Really.]

Amelia and Kang Junhyuk expressed their gratitude.

It was the moment when Taesan was about to leave the community for real.

At that moment, a conversation came in from Lee Taeyeon.

[Lee Taeyeon[Alone]: Ah, yeah. Taesan. I heard a rough story from Maria.] [Kang Taesan[Alone]: So it's been transmitted already.] [Lee Taeyeon[Alone]: You've worked hard. Really. You've become incredibly strong.]

Lee Taeyeon was purely amazed.

To have fought against Lakiratas and proven oneself without backing down...!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She knew how unbelievable the story was when she saw the end of the labyrinth.

[I Tae-yeon [Alone] : I want to help too... but I'm too weak. I'll try my best, at least.]

I Tae-yeon wrote with all her might.

Taesan, who had been staring at it for a moment, didn't say a word and closed the community.

Even though the conversation had ended, the wizard didn't appear.

He couldn't know what was on the 96th floor or if he could descend into the labyrinth now.

He had to wait until the wizard appeared.

Time passed again, and Taesan's mind naturally recalled I Tae-yeon, with whom he had just had a conversation.

How strong could I Tae-yeon become?

She had talent. It was a talent that even transcenders would be amazed by, although the direction was different.

If she utilized that talent perfectly and devoted herself to life, she might be able to reach a state of self-perfection someday.

An answer appeared in Taesan's mind.

It's possible.

I Tae-yeon could definitely achieve it. She had the potential to do so, which was why Maria must have created her with her own fingers. Taesan, who had reached enlightenment, knew it.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, the possibility of something and actually being able to achieve it were entirely different issues.

Tae-yeon had set her own limits. As long as she didn't think she could go beyond that, she couldn't reach the pinnacle alone.

From the start, she had become a servant, and the possibility itself was blocked.

Taesan didn't think that was a problem. He thought that stopping at a certain level and being satisfied was a personal choice.

But if that wasn't the case...

If he was aiming high but couldn't reach it...

Taesan gazed into the void.

"I can do it too."

As he said that, the space split open.

* * *

A long, green-haired woman appeared, her hair reaching down to her ankles. The green witch, who had revealed herself, bowed her head deeply in front of Taesan.

"I greet the great one."

She was more polite and humble than before, and Taesan felt burdened.

"It's okay, you don't have to."

"No, I must."

The green witch didn't raise her head.

Seeing her, Taesan realized one fact.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The green witch could see Taesan's vision together due to their contract.

In other words, it was highly likely that she had witnessed Taesan's entire battle with Rakirates.

"Did you see it?"

"Yes."

The green witch replied humbly.

"I have witnessed the noble deeds of great people. I am grateful to have been shown a magnificent sight that is beyond my station. And I will be grateful in other ways as well."

"Other ways?"

"I mean the part about not canceling the contract with me, a humble person."

Taesan realized what the green witch was saying.

Taesan had made a contract with the green witch.

It was a contract that allowed the green witch to observe every move Taesan made.

At the time, there was no particular problem. The green witch was immortal, and Taesan was mortal, so the green witch was the stronger one, and her position was superior, so the synchronization of their visions didn't pose a big issue.

But it wasn't the case now.

Taesan had reached a solitary realm, and she was still immortal.

And for an immortal like her to share a vision with a being of Taesan's level was a kind of insult.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If you're a transcendent being with a dirty nature, you would either kill the witch or forcibly cancel the contract. 

Even if it was a contract made with mutual consent during our mortal days, it wouldn't matter. The fact that we've reached this point means that much.

But of course, Taesan didn't think that way.

"This is a contract I agreed to. I won't think of canceling it unless you want to."

"Thank you sincerely."

The witch bowed her head and spoke. She slowly lifted her head.

"Then... it's a presumptuous thing to say, but may I make one request?"

There was desperation in the green witch's eyes.

That emotion was so thick and intense that even a mortal could sense it, not just Taesan.

From the start, she had made a contract with Taesan for one reason.

"Can you, who are great, tell me if I can reach a high position, and give me an answer?"
