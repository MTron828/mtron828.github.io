100. The Boy Who Drank from the Chalice (Part 10)

"Wow...!"

Anetsha, who had been absentmindedly watching Taesan practice, was startled and stood up.

A diminutive old man appeared through the bushes, tears streaming down his face as he knelt down. He removed his tattered robe.

Black hair and dark eyes were visible.

Anetsha was speechless.

"Haveneck...?"

"Your Highness... I am honored to see your noble presence."

The old man known as Haveneck knelt with tears. Anetsha burst into tears and ran towards him.

"You're alive!"

"I barely escaped when the castle was burning... I'm sorry. We decided to leave you, to save ourselves..."

"It's okay! You're alive, that's all that matters!"

Taesan, witnessing the touching reunion, quietly left them alone. He headed towards the clearing in the forest.

In the clearing, Taesan drew his sword and swung it.

Pabababak!

The air exploded with afterimages. Taesan looked at the tip of his sword with a displeased expression.

"Is this the end?"
The text describes Taesan's training and his current state:

"A tingling sensation emanates from the sword. Right now, Taesan is on the delicate verge just before obtaining Aura.

"It seems a few more days of training would suffice, but of all times, the demons have come looking for Anetsha.

"I should do the rest while moving."

It's not like there was nothing to gain. Thanks to relentless sword training, Storm Scar's sword proficiency also rose by 3%. The dance of Wolf Fang and Unhui has also become smoother than before.

Atria, who has been watching Taesan all along, couldn't help but marvel inwardly.

"Could he possibly grasp Aura in just three days?"

That in itself was clearly astonishing. Considering there are swordsmen who have trained for decades to obtain Aura, his speed could be considered overwhelming.

But she also understood the reason for his speed.

Taesan had already reached Swordmaster level in terms of the sword. Aura is the power that proves qualification for the sword, so Taesan, who already had the qualification, could easily obtain it.

What surprised her wasn't that.

Atria was amazed at Taesan's vast strength.

The power she saw in Taesan was nothing short of perfection.

Using magic that surpasses Matapju, learning Aura, and having exceptional physical abilities.
There, he doesn't even get tired.

For three days straight, swinging his sword daily, he doesn't even show signs of sweat.

Recalling battles with them, even if the sword is stuck in his body, it doesn't hinder his movements at all.

Being able to ignore injuries or having a much narrower range of injuries compared to them meant something.

"...Is that the power of the Labyrinth."

Atria was almost disinterested in her own world.

"Not fun at all."

He looked up at the sky with cold eyes.

He pursued strength to become a Swordmaster. And once he achieved that, there was no more strength to pursue.

He became bored.

He became free.

He had no interest in gods or anything else. What he desired was strength. Even following the prophecy of Harman, in which he had no interest, was driven by curiosity that the one who protects the princess is strong.

"The Labyrinth."

Atria's eyes sparkled.

* * *

An hour later, Taesan returned. Tears streamed down his face, and both Havernak and Anetsha had swollen eyes.

"Havernak. This person protected me."

"Ah..."
With fearful and reverent eyes, Havernak looked up at Taesan and bowed his head to the ground.

"Thank you so much. You risked your life to protect our princess..."

"I've received my reward, so it's fine."

After expressing gratitude for a while, Havernak stood up and bowed his head humbly.

"Thank you. Then, Princess, let's return to our land."

"Yeah, of course!"

Anetsha smiled widely as she looked at Taesan.

"Will you come too, Lord Taesan?"

"Yeah, if you're going, I have to."

They couldn't predict how the quest would conclude. It might just end with confirming her safety, so naturally, he had to accompany her.

Havernak looked noticeably flustered.

"Y-you're coming too, Lord Taesan?"

"Yeah. I'm indebted, so of course. Is there a problem?"

"N-no."

Havernak glanced anxiously.

"It's a hidden place, so it's difficult to bring outsiders..."

"Don't worry! He's the one who protected me! He'll treat you well too!"

Anetsha spoke with a confident expression. Havernak muttered hesitantly with a bewildered look.

"If that's what the Princess wishes..."

"Can I come too?"
Atria, who had been silently observing, spoke up. Anetsha belatedly noticed his presence.

"Lord Atria..."

"It's nothing. I have no interest in the demons."

Atria nodded to Taesan.

"You seem to have a grasp on where you're going. It's about time for me to leave as well, I suppose?"

"Do as you wish."

"Then farewell. I hope we meet again someday."

As Atria departed, he glanced back at Taesan.

Taesan's strength stemmed from the labyrinth.

"Perhaps I should search too."

With a goal in mind, Atria left. Havernak, with a strangely relieved expression, produced something from his robes.

"Princess, please take this."

"Huh? What is it?"

"A piece of jewelry crafted from a dragon's claw. It shields you from the gaze of the gods."

Anetsha asked in surprise,

"How did you come by this?"

It was a rare item even during the reign of the demon king.

Havernak smiled knowingly.

"You'll understand when you arrive. Taesan should have one too."

Havernak pulled out another and handed it to Taesan.
[Jewelry made from a dragon's claw] [The dragon guarding the world prevents the intervention of transcendental beings.]

"Alright, let's move."

Havernak flipped his robe once more. Anetsha followed him with a serious expression.

They began to move. They headed away from the center of the world towards its outskirts.

The jewelry Havernak handed over indeed seemed to shield from the gaze of the gods, as no one came seeking them.

Perhaps it wasn't the jewelry, but rather Taesan's prowess as a swordsman that prevented anyone from approaching.

After two days of travel, Taesan continued to wield his sword throughout.

And finally, he managed to obtain the aura.

Crackle. Crackle.

"Oh, this is the aura? Amazing."

The ghost exclaimed in admiration, moving around. Taesan looked at the blue flames flickering above his sword.

Unlike Garant's aura, the blue light flickered and sparked unstably. It seemed to be due to his lack of proficiency.

"Skill window."

[Special Activation Skill: Aura] [Proficiency: 1%] [Reward given to the one who proves the sword. Still inexperienced and unable to control properly.]
As he had heard, there was no consumption cost. Taesan tried even harder to extend his aura.

But there was no change. The aura was flickering at the same size as before.

"There's no consumption cost, but is the limit clearly defined?"

Taesan drew his sword. A giant tree was smoothly cut down.

*Kugung.*

There was absolutely no power consumption. It was cut down very smoothly.

I'll have to try it out to know exactly what its performance is like, but it seemed like its attack power had greatly increased.

Taesan satisfactorily sharpened his sword.

And three days later,

They arrived at the land of demons.

* * *

"Here we are."

Havernak introduced with a weary face. The place they arrived at was a small mountain range.

"It's a strangely shaped mountain."

Inside the mountain range, there was only one mountain, beautifully colored with various hues of autumn leaves. Unlike other mountain ranges, it was exceptionally unique and caught the eye at once.

"Are you sure this is the right place?"

It was too flashy a place to call it hidden.

Havernak affirmed.

"Yes, it is. No one comes here."

Taesan looked silently at the mountain. Seeing him motionless, Havernak cautiously asked.
"Is there any problem, by any chance...?"

"If there's a problem, it's a problem; if not, then it's not. Is this the right place?"

"Yes. It is, but..."

"There's something incredibly powerful here."

A power stronger than anything Taesan had seen so far.

A level of power that no one except a god could touch was inside the mountain.

Havernak looked at Taesan with a surprised expression.

"Have you felt it?"

"What are you talking about?"

"It might come as a shock, but I was planning to tell you later... It's simple."

Havernak pointed to the mountain adorned with autumn leaves.

"There resides a dragon there."

"What?"

Anetsha's face turned pale.

"A dragon?"

"It's okay."

Havernak reassured Anetsha.

"Since dragons fundamentally do not obey even the commands of gods, they are indifferent to our presence. Aside from the anxiety it might cause, it's the best place as it's beyond the reach of divine sight."

Dragons are guardians of the world. Where their presence resides, interference from transcendents is prevented. It was the most suitable place for demons fleeing from the pursuit of gods.
"Actually, it's been over ten years since we've been here, but we've never seen the dragon even once. There's no issue."

"Is that so?"

Taesan gazed at the mountain thoughtfully.

"I don't think so."

He murmured quietly.

They seemed oblivious to everything around them, so there was no need to speak up now. Taesan changed the subject.

"So, shall we go?"

"Let's go. Princess."

Anetsha cautiously stepped towards the mountain.

They ascended the mountain. It had truly been untouched by anyone; the path was overgrown and difficult to traverse. Even Anetsha, seasoned by many chases, found it taxing, and Havernak requested rest several times.

Eventually, they reached the middle of the mountain where a small village lay.

"Ah..."

Anetsha exclaimed softly. Amidst buildings that seemed on the verge of collapse, there were several people with black hair.

Upon seeing Anetsha, they rushed towards her in surprise.

"Oh!"

"Princess!"

"It's the princess!"

"You're alive!"

Tears streamed down her face as she embraced them. Hearing the commotion, all the inhabitants of the village, who were demons, ran towards them.
Taesan counted the numbers one by one.

"About fifty, I'd say."

Though hazy on the exact population needed for a tribe to thrive, he remembered it was more than fifty.

It seemed likely that the demon tribe would perish here.

"Oh! Princess!"

"Artenekia! You're here too!"

The demon who seemed to be the village chief spotted Anetsha and happily ran towards her. Anetsha greeted him with a smile.

Although their expressions were coarse, they all seemed delighted.

"Welcome."

Watching them for a moment, Taesan clapped his hands. Anetsha, unaware that Taesan had left, smiled happily and pointed in the direction where Taesan had been.

"This person brought me... huh?"

She looked confused.

There was no one in the direction where Taesan had been.

***

[Do you think it'll be okay?]

"He doesn't seem interested in demons, so I don't think he'll attack me."

Since Taesan entered the mountain, there had been a presence calling out to him continuously.

"He's also quite impatient."
Once he finished the conversation, he had planned to confirm safety before leaving, but as he was constantly rushed, he unavoidably slipped away.

Taesan arrived at the summit of the mountain. There, he found a massive cave.

And there was also a golem guarding it.

*Kugung...*

A giant made of boulders looked down at Taesan. Taesan exclaimed in awe.

"This is..."

Formidable.

Even facing him now, Taesan couldn't guarantee victory. In fact, it was implied that he couldn't even touch the inhabitants of this world.

*Kugung...*

The golem watching Taesan moved aside.

Taesan entered the cave.

"Hmm."

There was a dragon inside.

A majestic being with golden scales and magnificent horns looked down at Taesan.

The dragon, filling the cave, acknowledged Taesan.

"Welcome. You have encountered Valvernes, the Golden Dragon, as guided by the will of the Ancients."
