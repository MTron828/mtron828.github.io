**Episode 317**

**317 (Extra). The Earth on the Brink of Destruction. Lee Tae-yeon (1)**

"It's really annoying."

Lee Tae-yeon muttered to herself, looking dejected, after meeting the wizard.

The reward for conquering the labyrinth was a wish. She had been thinking about what to wish for. Should she ask to revive all the dead people, or turn back time to create a world where monsters couldn't invade?

But she couldn't make her wish come true without conquering the labyrinth. Lee Tae-yeon snorted in frustration.

"Is there anyone who has made their wish come true with such conditions?"

[No. It's not that easy to make a wish come true.]

"It's not easy to get this far, though..."

[The standard is relative. The wizard's expectations are higher than that.]

"Whatever."

Lee Tae-yeon shook her head. Her hair swayed softly.

"I can go back to Earth. That's enough."

She was finally able to leave this awful place.

She smiled in satisfaction.

"Create a path for me."

[Alright.]

Whoosh.

The space opened up.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A familiar scent wafts from beyond. She takes a deep breath.

It's the earth.

She gazes beyond the space with a dreamy gaze.

"Finally..."

She murmurs in a sweet voice, looking at the departing figure.

"You were always talkative and annoying, but after seeing you for so long, I grew fond of you. It's farewell."

[Take care. I also had a good time. You were the first adventurer I met who went down into the labyrinth like that.]

"I'm grateful too."

[What.]

The voice spoke quietly.

[I also had a good time. It was a faithful time.]

"Since it's the last time, I'll ask again: what's your true identity?"

The voice didn't answer. Who was it?

She knew it was a transcendent being. Even she couldn't sense its true power. Yet, she had spent an uncountable amount of time right next to it.

Despite her curiosity, she continued to ask, but the voice didn't respond.

The voice chuckled quietly.

[You'll know when the time comes.]

"Is that soon?"

It was an incomprehensible phrase, but in the end, the voice kept its true identity a secret, and Lee Tae-yeon pouted.

"You're being coy."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Her voice was filled with laughter.

[Then, I'll give you a gift.]

A light stood before her. The light took shape and formed a single orb.

[I've obtained an orb that holds something.]

"What's this?"

[You'll know when the time comes.]

"Hmm... thank you."

The orb was beyond her comprehension, but it wasn't worthless. Taeyeon received it gratefully.

"Then, it's farewell. We won't meet again."

She had no intention of returning to the labyrinth. To return to this hellish place? It was a terrible thought.

But the voice only laughed quietly.

[That's right. Then, it's farewell.]

"Yes."

Taeyeon nodded her head strongly and took a step forward.

She transcended the space.

It was Earth.

How much had it developed? With many technicians, they must have harnessed electricity. Having overcome the labyrinth, her physical abilities had improved significantly, so maybe they could even build a building.

How happy and colorful a life were they living?
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And could she also live a certain life?

She had transcended space with happiness.

The earth revealed its appearance.

Her pupils trembled.

"What?"

The things that appeared were broken buildings. It was a world of gray ash.

"......Was I summoned to an abandoned land?"

Her voice trembled.

Yes. That's right. The number of people who survived was not many. It was impossible to restore the entire devastated land ravaged by the monster's invasion.

This was such a place.

She tried to believe so.

But the cruel world showed her the truth.

"Ah......"

Above the sky.

A massive crack that had swallowed the sun.

"Why?"

Lee Tae-yeon's eyes trembled. They had clearly closed that crack. They had won.

They must have.

But what was this?

Something had gone wrong.

A sense of unease rose to the tip of her throat.

* * *

"Ugh."

She barely let out a breath. The cold sweat running down her cheek made her feel the chilly air.

"Oh, a new returnee?"

Footsteps were heard. A familiar face appeared.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Long time no see? Who... what? Is that Ms. Lee Tae-yeon?"

"...Ms. Young-jung."

Young-jung, a hardcore player. She was someone who knew her too.

Lee Tae-yeon barely looked at Young-jung.

Unshaven beard. Disheveled hair. Dry skin.

What's with that appearance?

It's like she's a survivor living on a dying earth.

Young-jung's eyes sparkled with joy when she saw her. He shouted loudly.

"Hey! Everyone come see! Who's back?"

As Young-jung spoke, people gathered around, murmuring.

"Who's back, you ask?"

"Is it Tae-yeon?"

"Really?"

The gathered people's eyes shone bright. They started chattering excitedly.

"Wow! Lee Tae-yeon cleared the hard mode for real! And so quickly too!"

"This means we'll have some real freedom now!"

Lee Tae-yeon gazed at them blankly.

Her neatly cut hair. Her dirty skin.

Everyone looked the same as Young-jung.

She licked her dry lips.

"...Why do you all look like that?"

"Ah."

Young-jung's face stiffened.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Only then did others realize as well. What Lee Tae-yeon had been hoping for when she returned."

Young-jeong scratched her head.

"Hmm... Miss Tae-yeon, calm down and listen."

"Ahaha, I get it. Is this a hidden camera prank?"

Young-jeong tried to explain slowly, but Lee Tae-yeon burst out laughing.

She raised her arm.

"That's right, isn't it weird? We all won, but why is the Earth like this? Are you trying to trick me?"

"No way."

Young-jeong shook her head gloomily.

"We also believed that and returned to Earth. But what welcomed us was a ruined Earth. Miss Tae-yeon, we were deceived by the monster."

"Don't lie!"

Lee Tae-yeon shouted loudly.

"That can't be! We won! We triumphed! We overcame!"

Her eyes were filled with denial.

"That's right! We won! So we could overcome that hellish time and break through that miserable labyrinth to get here! This can't be! It can't be like this!"

It was a childish outburst, devoid of reason or logic, like a three-year-old's tantrum.

But no one could refute her. Young-jeong opened her mouth with a gloomy expression.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's like that. Miss Tae-yeon."

"Haha, haha..."

A faint laughter escaped from Tae-yeon's lips.

And then it stopped abruptly.

"You're all fakes."

"What?"

"The final test. Is that what this is? This kind of trial? Fine. I'll overcome it."

Tae-yeon drew her sword. The people were shocked.

"What's going on?"

"Do you want to try to stop me?"

"Who can?"

The room fell silent at her words.

If they were hard mode players, there would be no problem. They were all hard mode players, and they could easily suppress her.

But Tae-yeon was an alone mode player.

There was only one person who could suppress her.

"......Mr. Tae-san, are you there?"

"Yes, I came back a few hours ago. I'll call him right away."

He quickly left. The others clicked their tongues. He must have judged that it was better to escape quickly because he didn't want to deal with Tae-yeon.

"Hey, Miss Tae-yeon? Can't you calm down for now?"

Don't laugh.

She laughed ominously.

They were all fakes.

The world couldn't be like this.

So, this was a trial created by the labyrinth.

The trial must be overcome.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The energy emanating from her grows stronger, like a swelling wave. The half-destroyed building crumbles with a loud crash, and people's faces turn pale.

"What's going on?!"

"Uh, can't even get a moment's rest?"

I-Tae-Yeon gripped his sword tightly.

At that moment, a voice exhausted from fatigue was heard.

"Are you back?"

"Yeah."

I-Tae-Yeon's pupils dilated. The energy that had been spreading disappeared. People let out a sigh of relief.

"Wow, I thought I was going to die."

"Mr. Tae-San, please."

"Why are you calling me like that? You're one of them, aren't you? It's only fitting."

A sharp impression.

He looked somewhat carefree, but his face was exhausted as he gazed at I-Tae-Yeon.

"It's been a while."

"Tae-San."

"I'm sorry, but this is the end. It's come to this."

"......Don't joke around."

It's not possible.

It can't be.

She didn't let go of the hand gripping the sword.

"You're a fake too. A fake created by the labyrinth......"

Tae-San let out a sigh at her mumbling.

"Yeah, that's right. I didn't think you'd listen to reason?"

[Kang Tae-San activated a temporary time stop. Time within a 100m radius of him came to a standstill for 2 minutes.]

Time stopped.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

In the frozen time, Taesan moved alone and approached Iteayeon.

"Let's take a break and cool our heads for a moment."

Taesan drew his sword.

[Taesan activated addition.] [Taesan activated multiplication.] [Taesan activated skill reset.] [Taesan activated multiplication.] [Taesan's non-lethal attack.] [Dealt 92,236,816 damage to Iteayeon.]

* * *

Iteayeon stared blankly at the ceiling.

Through the worn-out, cracked gaps, the sky was visible. It was a building that couldn't fulfill its role as a house.

But it was the most intact building here.

"Have you calmed down?"

"...To some extent."

Taesan sat on a worn-out chair, looking at her.

He opened his mouth.

"How do you feel?"

"It's dirty."

Iteayeon spoke quietly, and Taesan nodded.

"I understand. I felt the same way. It was frustrating, and I wanted to destroy everything."

"Can you tell me what happened?"

Taesan opened his mouth in response to her gloomy voice.

The contents that he was about to reveal to her.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She closed her eyes, recalling the vivid experiences of the past events.

They had not won.

It was a futile hope that they had dreamed of achieving within the false victory.

After returning to Earth, many people died at the hands of the monsters that appeared.

It was literally a time of massacre. The first ones to return were mostly easy-mode players, who were unable to resist the monsters and died one by one.

It wasn't until the hard-mode players returned later that people were able to join forces, drive out the monsters, and reclaim their territory.

After that, it was a repetition of despair. They would defeat the monsters that came at them, but many people would die in the process, and their places would be taken by other returnees.

They were slowly dying on top of the countless corpses.

The woman who heard the story asked quietly,

"......If they were hard-mode players, couldn't they handle the monsters without a problem?"

"It was like that the last time we returned. But it's different now. The monsters that appeared this time are much stronger than before. There are ones that can't be defeated even if dozens of people gang up on them."

Taesan spoke calmly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We were deceived."

"...... Is Choi Joon-sang still alive?"

Choi Joon-sang. He was an easy mode player. He was an expert with a special electrical ability. He said he would return to Earth first and create a light bulb, becoming the Edison of modern times.

"I don't know if I'll return before I die. I'll probably die without anyone noticing."

"What about Park Ji-young?"

She was a normal mode player. She was an excellent chef. She said she would return to Earth and showcase her culinary skills.

"I died two days before I was supposed to return."

"...... What about Yoon Se-an?"

He was a hard mode player and a lawyer. He thought that laws were necessary in the process of rebuilding civilization, just like on Earth before.

He worked hard to create a legal code that could be used on Earth while conquering the labyrinth, and he completed it just before clearing the game. Everyone promised to follow his legal code.

Taesan answered.

"He died a year ago."

She closed her eyes tightly.

She continued to ask. She asked about the names she knew, the people she remembered.

Most of the answers that came back were that they had died.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's the situation. We are now..."

Taesan's exhausted face was pressed against the ground.

"I don't know about the situation in other countries. We didn't have the luxury to know. But since we're like this, it's not like they're doing well either."

The world was truly on the brink of destruction.

There was no longer a refuge, no escape. Iteon gazed blankly at the ground.

"That's why we need you."

"......Me?"

"Yes. You need to become our leader."

At Taesan's words, Iteon's head jerked up.

"Me, I'm the leader......"

"No."

Taesan shook his head.

"You have to do it. I can't."

Taesan was, of course, strong.

He was the strongest EZ mode player, and if the conditions were met, Iteon could also win.

"But I can take down a strong monster, but I can't protect everyone. I'm like a gun that needs to be repaired after one shot. In a situation like this, someone as purely strong as you needs to be the leader."

Taesan said in a low voice.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But I don't know how strong you are, but since you've cleared the alone mode, you must have become much stronger than when we last met."

The last time they met was during the final Earth Return Quest. It was a long, long time ago.

At that time, Lee Tae-yeon was also very strong. Since she's cleared the alone mode and returned, she must have become even stronger.

"I...…."

Lee Tae-yeon's voice trembled.

To become the leader.

To take responsibility for people's lives.

It's impossible. She can barely protect herself, let alone take on the lives of others. Her mind can't handle that.

But Taesan's words stopped her from refusing.

"Of course, I know. I know you're struggling. That's why you've been refusing until now. But we don't have the luxury of struggling anymore, Lee Tae-yeon."

Taesan smiled wryly.

Lee Tae-yeon closed her mouth at his expression.

He was always confident, even in easy mode. Even in desperate situations, he didn't fear and found a way to overcome.

But Taesan's face now looked extremely exhausted.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

That expression made it impossible for Tae-yeon to refuse.

"I won't ask you to answer right away. Let's take a break and calm down first."

"...Do you have the luxury to do that?"

They were on the brink of collapse. There was no way they could afford to relax with Tae-yeon's level of power.

"I don't want to be too harsh on you, but you must be frustrated too. The monsters are playing tricks on us, giving us some leeway. At our current level, we can handle them to some extent, unlike other people."

Taesan left the room, and the door closed with a creak.

She was left alone, staring blankly at the closed door.

* * *

She did nothing, just gazing blankly at the sky between the cracks.

Everything was numb.

Reality didn't feel like reality.

As the day passed, she suddenly came to her senses.

She looked up at the crack in the ceiling above her.

"That's...".

She couldn't sense it before, but now that she had gained sufficient power and strength while descending into the labyrinth, she could understand it.

The power emanating from within was beyond her comprehension, a power of a different category and level.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Gods of the labyrinth and beings of at least equal status.

You can't win.

What you'll find by fighting is an undeniable death.

"Ah, ah......"

My body trembled.

The earth is not a safe place.

Monsters still exist, and she must risk her life to fight.

"Uh......"

My teeth chattered. My whole body shook, and my mind wavered.

Death.

It was right in front of her.

Just as she was about to panic, the door opened.

"Uh......"

A young girl cautiously entered. Lee Tae-yeon, who had quickly regained her composure, stared blankly at the girl.

"Kim Min-ji......?"

"Ah. You remember me!"

Kim Min-ji. A normal mode player. A bright and cheerful girl who had a good relationship with her.

She said with a bright face.

"I'm surprised. Tae-yeon has returned! I believed you would come back to Earth someday, but I didn't think it would be this soon!"

"......That's right."

She thought the same. But her desire for clearance accelerated her pace even more.

If she had known this, she would have stayed there a little longer."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Kim Min-ji clenched her fists tightly.

"Now that you're here, Taeyeon-ssi! From now on, we can also expand our territory! We can defeat the monsters and live like we used to!"

She said with determination.

Taeyeon asked in a trembling voice.

"......What about your brother?"

Kim Min-ji had an older brother. Although they often fought, they were a normal family who cared for each other.

Kim Min-ji quietly scratched her head.

"Ah, haha... He died a month ago."

"......How did it happen?"

"He tried to protect me. What a fool. I could have lived, but..."

She muttered softly. Her eyes were filled with sadness, but also resignation.

Taeyeon realized. These people didn't even have the luxury to mourn the death of their family.

"......My brother gave his life to save mine. I can't die like this. And now that you're here, Taeyeon-ssi..."

Her bright, hopeful eyes turned to Taeyeon.

"Alone Mode-clearing Taeyeon-ssi must be much stronger than before, right?"

And in those eyes, there was also a sense of desperation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Please, save us. Miss Tae-yeon."

Fear of death, anxiety about monsters.

Kim Min-ji, a young girl, had entrusted her future to herself.

Tae-yeon was out of breath.

* * *

"Should I run away?"

Kim Min-ji murmured quietly to herself in the empty room she was left in.

Although it's impossible to escape from a divine being, such a being cannot easily descend to the earth. If she's alone, she can easily hide her body.

She had the ability to do so. Even those who called themselves guides, adventurers who went down to the labyrinth, and NPCs couldn't find her if she decided to hide. She had that kind of power.

"Hahahahaha……."

A hollow laugh flowed out.

It's a meaningless fantasy. The voices of hundreds of people on the other side of the narrow room continued to echo in her ears.

"Miss Tae-yeon is here……."

"Now we don't have to die meaninglessly……."

"We can survive……."

The voices contained longing and hope for Tae-yeon, and determination towards her.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Even if I don't want to listen, my strengthened body has taken in every emotion contained in that voice.

My lips have dried up.

Are you saying I should abandon their hopes? Their expectations? Ignore the wailing that curses myself as I die, and abandon the emotions that despair as I disappear, and try to survive on my own?

It's impossible.

She couldn't become such a shameless person.

Everything that could be done was blocked.

"Ugh."

Nausea rose up. She barely managed to cover her mouth.

Her head was spinning.

Even her spirit, tempered by the long years in the labyrinth, felt like it would shatter if touched now.

No. She had never been tempered in the first place. She was just barely holding on to her worn-out spirit, and her mind had reached its limits a long time ago.

She stretched out her hand, feeling around. If she didn't grab onto something, she really would go crazy.

Thud.

Something small caught in her hand.

It was a rough, unassuming stone. It looked like an ordinary stone on the outside, but it contained the power to turn back time.

"......The Ouroboros's stone."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Only once, an item from the labyrinth that can turn back time.

At first, I thought I could turn back the past and was happy, but soon I was bound to be disappointed.

The time that can be turned back with the Oroboros' stone is limited until just before the gods invade the earth. I also checked with Balbalbamba and the transcendent being who was watching over me, but ultimately, I couldn't escape the fate of entering the labyrinth.

"...Did I say that?"

The voice had spoken. You want to die, don't you? Taeyeon replied no.

Then the voice asked again. Do you want to break through the labyrinth again?

Taeyeon also said she didn't want to.

She still couldn't give an answer.

"But..."

She couldn't abandon the people who believed in and expected her.

Taeyeon struggled to get up and went outside. The people who were waiting were surprised and looked at her.

"Miss Taeyeon?"

"...In two hours, monsters will come pouring in."

The people were shocked by her quiet words. Taeyeon continued speaking."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"My level is around twenty-five. Among them, twenty-three are hard mode players who can be dealt with, but the remaining two are not. I have to fight Taesan."

"Huh? I don't feel anything?"

"It's still outside your perception range. Get ready, everyone."

"Ah, okay!"

"Taeyeon-ssi!"

Kim Min-ji looked at her with a bright face.

Taeyeon, who tried to ignore her gaze, drew her sword.

"Let's try to survive for now."

And let's survive, people.

And in the very end, when there's no escape left...

What will she choose then?

Even she herself didn't know.
