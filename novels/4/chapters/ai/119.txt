Chapter 120

120. Electing the King (1)

The people of Ji and Normal mode seemed to be stiff and rigid.

I refused to talk to them with a gloomy atmosphere. Only the Hard mode people seemed confident.

“……It's a difference in strength, I suppose.”

The Hard mode could survive without any problems, but Ji and Normal couldn't.

Kim Hwi-yeon thought of the gap between them with a puzzled face.

As time passed, people started to arrive one by one from other regions.

“Huh, huh, huh.”

“Wah, wah, wah...”

Their numbers were strikingly small. It was because many had died during their journey, unable to cover the entire area by themselves like Taesan.

Kim Hwi-yeon brought them into the Younjin City Hall with a sorrowful face.

The empty space of the vast land was gradually filling up.

Taesan sat down lazily on the rooftop of the building.

There was nothing to do.
Here is the translation of the text:

For a week after completing the special quest, there was nothing I could do actively. Even trying to rescue people coming from other regions was impossible because I was blocked from leaving the moment I arrived at the city hall.

It meant that I had to wait quietly at the city hall for two days.

Taesan's gaze, which was staring blankly at the ground, suddenly showed a hint of conflict.

It seemed that Iteyan and Kangjunhyeok were having a heated argument with those who appeared to be hard mode players from Yongin.

I focused my mind and listened to their conversation.

"What's going on?"

"Didn't you get your ears plugged? Don't make a scene, it's on solo mode."

"It's not a scene, I'm just trying to stop it..."

"That's a scene too."

The hard mode player's face contorted in anger at Iteyan's words.

"No matter how you treat easy mode players, we're free. We have our own rights. And you're trying to stop us?"

"Why did we make the community so noisy? What's so noisy about it?"

Kangjunhyeok's face stiffened as he let out a snort.

He tightened his grip on the sword in his hand.

"You guys..."

"What's wrong? Are you still not even drunk yet?"

"Just stop."

A flat voice echoed. The hard mode players looked at each other, and their faces brightened.
Here is the translation of the text:

Seojangsan's face scrunched up as he approached. "What's all the commotion?"

"Ah, it's the king."

"The king?"

Gang Jun-hyeok raised an eyebrow. The word "king" was an anachronism in modern society, but Seojangsan received it calmly and opened his mouth.

"What's going on?"

"It's not a big deal. They broke the law that the king had decreed."

"Oh, they broke the law, did they? I don't see why they need to do that, I say..."

Lee Tae-yeon's face fell and she stuttered. Seojangsan ignored her words and scratched his cheek.

"You can't break the law. If you do, you'll have to face the consequences."

Seojangsan gave Lee Tae-yeon and Gang Jun-hyeok a cold stare, one he had never shown before when they were together with Kim Hwi-yeon.

Seojangsan felt that the stare was as arrogant as that of an overbearing king.

After a moment of contemplation, Seojangsan nodded his head.

"Originally, it would have been capital punishment, but..."

"Capital punishment?"

Lee Tae-yeon let out a shocked cry.

"It was an unintentional mistake, so it's impossible to inflict such a severe punishment. Then it's simple..."

"What are you talking about?"

The voice from behind Seojangsan's back made him quickly turn around.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san smiled and looked at them with a hint of mischief.

"Can I join you?"

"Who are you to be so bold...?"

"Just stop."

The hard mode player, unaware of Tae-san's true identity, was about to shout something.

Seo-jang-san stepped in and interrupted him.

"...It's nothing. She was talking about violating the rules."

"Rules? Who makes those? You?"

Tae-san scowled.

"You may be the lord here, but you're not the king. Please don't impose your own laws on us."

"This is..."

The hard mode player, with a mix of laughter and mockery, took a step forward. He drew his sword and aimed it at Tae-san, who moved his body with a bored expression.

"What's this again?"

"This, this is fine!"

The hard mode player continued to swing his sword without stopping.

His speed was undoubtedly fast, a movement that surpassed human limits and was only possible in hard mode.

However, Tae-san was not even scratched.

Tae-san was dodging everything, using only his light movements to avoid the attacks.

"Ah, ah ah?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The eyes of the people watching widened in shock. The man attacking was completely out of control.

Taesan seemed to be moving slightly on the surface, but his movements were so slow that they were barely visible to the naked eye.

However, his attacks were not even reaching the target.

Even if he moved slowly, he could dodge it, and the gap was enormous, implying that he was not even trying.

"Dying!"

The cry of despair and the sword's descent onto Taesan's head made him flinch.

Taesan stretched out his hand and grabbed the sword.

The man's body jerked and came to a stop.

"Is this self-defense?"

Taesan clenched his fist. He pulled out his entire body's muscle and swung it as slowly and weakly as possible.

The hard-mode player was knocked back like he had taken a hit from a boss.

[Kim Gu-hwan took 51 damage from Taesan.]

Kim Gu-hwan, who was pinned down, trembled. West Mountain was also taken aback, not knowing what to do.

"51?"

He couldn't even imagine the damage he had taken. Taesan shook his gauntlet and muttered to himself.

"I did a good job."

He smiled wryly and said, "Do you want more?"

"......No, not doing it."

West Mountain tried to hide his agitation and said, "Sorry. I'll make sure to punish you for attacking me without permission."
Here is the translation of the text:

The moment the hard mode player fell, Tai Shan said lazily, "It's the last time I'll do this. Next time, I'll kill you."

Hmm.

Xiao Zhan's body suddenly twitched.

The hard mode player suddenly rushed towards Xiao Zhan on Tai Shan's orders.

Iteyan and Kang Junhyeok knew that the hard mode player was similar to them, but Tai Shan was a mystery.

Iteyan asked him various questions, but only got vague and unconvincing answers, so he wanted to figure out Tai Shan's strength.

Tai Shan knew this and was only sparing him this time.

"......Remember this."

He swallowed his saliva and left.

Kang Junhyeok, who had been sitting quietly, suddenly burst out in anger.

"You're just trash!"

Kang Junhyeok, who had always smiled and seemed confident, was angry for the first time.

"Why is your mother just listening quietly?"

"But I don't want to fight..."

"Those people are fighting over there! What are you going to do to avoid it?"

Kang Junhyeok pounded his chest in frustration. Iteyan bowed his head deeply.

Tai Shan smiled and asked, "What's going on? Explain it to me."
Here is the translation of the text:

Jang Jun-hyeok started explaining with a excited tone, his voice trembling.

"I was taking a walk in the park with my sister, and she was being surrounded by those guys in a corner. I didn't know what was going on, so I was quietly listening, but then I heard some harsh sounds coming out. I couldn't bear it anymore, so I intervened. Sister, what's going on? What's the reason?"

"Oh, no, it's not a big deal..."

Lee Tae-yeon explained slowly. Jang Jun-hyeok's face gradually contorted, and when Lee Tae-yeon finished explaining, he couldn't hold back his anger and stomped his foot.

"It's a good thing, isn't it? Why are those guys so arrogant?"

Lee Tae-yeon's explanation was that she had seen a group of men harassing a woman while walking in the park.

At first, she was afraid to intervene, but as the situation became more violent, she rushed in to stop it.

The woman had retaliated, but the men had continued to pressure Lee Tae-yeon, saying they had broken the law.

"Those guys said they broke the law, right? The chief of police here? The one who's like a king? Even that kind of guy said something similar..."

Jang Jun-hyeok spat out the words with a contorted face.

"Brother, is this a weird place?"

"Why do you think that?"

(Note: I did my best to translate the text accurately, but please keep in mind that the translation may not be perfect due to the nuances of the original text.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"'There's no one in solo mode, and even in easy or normal mode, there aren't many people. And everyone's behavior is strange. At first, I thought it was just fine, but as time went on, it's really getting on my nerves.'"

"'If it's strange, then it's strange. If it's not, then it's not. I'll just take a break for now. I've already made a mess, so I won't touch it again.'"

"'Ah, yes.'"

"'Oh, thank you. It's Tae-san.'"

Tae-san bid farewell and left them.

Definitely, Kang Jun-hyeok was faster-witted than Taeyoung.

He went back up to the rooftop and looked down at the bottom.

He had observed for some time, and then a faint noise reached Tae-san.

"'Brother.'"

"'What's going on here?'"

Middle-jo opened his mouth with a wry smile.

"'I heard that there was a commotion earlier.'"

"'Something similar happened.'"

"'Sorry.'"

Middle-jo said with a contrite face.

"'Well, there are some hardcore players who are a bit too intense, so some people are having trouble. I told Jang-san about it, and he said he was having trouble controlling himself too.'"

When Tae-san looked, it seemed like Jang-san was in charge, but Middle-jo seemed to know nothing about it.

"'I said I'd be careful from now on. There won't be any more trouble.'"

"'Don't worry about it. You don't have to apologize.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Anyway, we're all hard-mode players. We didn't know each other, but..."

Most people who play in hard mode know each other. Even those who got into a fight with Taeyeon this time knew Junggeun. So, he was feeling guilty about it.

Junggeun left with a guilty expression on his face.

Taesan looked down at the ground.

On the ground, the scenes Taeyeon had talked about were unfolding.

The hard-mode players were being bullied and oppressed by Ji and the normal mode players. It was like a relationship between nobles and slaves.

"It was the same in the previous world too."

[Uncomfortable.]

The ghost's tone was filled with resentment.

[Like the guides of sin. The lowly and despicable ones can be found anywhere.]

"Isn't it annoying to compare with them?"

At least, the guides of sin acknowledged the strong ones. However, Seojangsan only accepted the hard-mode players, which made it even more unfair.

The hard-mode players. Except for solo mode, they were the strongest existences.

They were all different. There were those who had lost hope in reality, like Geum Junggeun, and those who wanted to save everyone, like Kim Hwiyeon.
Here is the translation:

And there was also someone who wanted to seize power.

He said that he had to lead everyone.

He claimed that only hard mode could save the world.

He wanted to return to the medieval era with all its rules and orders.

He oppressed easy and normal players to elevate hard mode to a noble status.

That was Seo Jang-san.

To Seo Jang-san, solo players were like thorns in his eyes. They were a threat to his plans because they were stronger and could deny his intentions.

He wanted to crush them with numbers and suppress them. In fact, Iteolyeon from his previous life had surrendered easily. She didn't like fighting and couldn't handle the entire hard mode on her own.

However, it was impossible now.

It wasn't just Iteolyeon, but also Kang Jun-hyeok, and there was another one.

"What a foolish thing."

Even if that wasn't the case, Seo Jang-san's plan would still fail.

Easy and normal modes were undoubtedly weak. Even if they combined their forces, they couldn't defeat a single hard mode player. However, that was a story from after they cleared the labyrinth.
Here is the translation of the text:

At present, the difference between them was not great. Even easy-mode players could easily kill hard-mode players if they were willing to risk their lives.

Choi Jung-hyeok was the key to this. He had been playing on easy mode for a long time and had managed to survive and maintain his power. Longer than Seo Jang-san, to be exact.

"But I won't give up."

[Those kinds of people are so attached to what they have that they don't even think about giving up until it's almost too late.]

Tae-san's information was all from the previous era. Seo Jang-san was confident that he would be the leader of the group. He thought that he could crush Tae-san and become the leader of the group.

"I said it was the last time, so I won't regret it."

Tae-san stood up.

And two days passed.

The last day of the quest, which was called "The Gathering of the Five Cities," had arrived.

There were twenty cities in the southern part of the country. However, the group was unable to reach all of them. Only a few hundred people survived.

Some groups did not even make it to the destination. Those who were lucky enough to arrive without suffering heavy losses were few and far between.

As time passed, the number of groups that made it to the destination gradually decreased. On the last day, the number of survivors was less than 100,000, which was far from their expectations.
The atmosphere at the viewing area became gloomy. She was saddened by the fact that her friend did not arrive, and felt a sense of emptiness upon realizing that everyone from the southern region was present here. However, this atmosphere did not last long.

A calm and ruthless quest appeared before them.

[Special Quest Begins.] [Choose Your King.] [The king can assign roles to people. While there is no coercion, following the king's orders can bring great benefits. However, if you do not follow the king's orders consecutively, you will face penalties. The one who kills the king will receive a heavy penalty.] [Once you have chosen a king, survive.] [Make food and defend your land. Build walls and block monsters. A wave will come every fixed period.] [Survival period: one month] [Reward: The reward will be distributed differently depending on the outcome. You can change the king in a few cases.] [Changing the king will bring great benefits to the person most involved.]
