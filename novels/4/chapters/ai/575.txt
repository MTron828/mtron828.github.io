Chapter 576

576. The God of Fall, the Usurper (7)

Taesan unleashed all the power contained in his sword. Including the boundary-breaking, infinite power, and the beast of physical strength and boundary. He spread it all out in a fan shape, sweeping through the Usurper's interior.

And that wasn't the end.

He circulated the consumed power once more, refilling all his abilities.

Quadruple crash!

The Usurper's internal structure was destroyed. The essence, the source, and the foundation of the Usurper's existence were all shattered.

The Usurper suffered irreparable damage. The power it had absorbed was no longer under its control and was trying to break free.

The Usurper didn't just sit back and take it. Its massive body engulfed Taesan.

It was trying to sweep everything away and trample him.

[Your endurance has been activated.]

But Taesan endured it.

He infused his sword with power and pierced deep into the Usurper. It was a fatal blow that would eventually lead to the Usurper's death.

Quadruple crash!

The Usurper's existence began to crumble.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No matter the outcome of the battle, the fate of the usurper has been decided.

So, the usurper made a decision.

[It will be mine.]

The usurper devours Taesan.

It covers his body and corrupts it.

No, it's not corruption.

It's usurpation.

"You."

Taesan's face contorts.

The usurper is trying to forcibly devour Taesan right now.

It's trying to usurp his very existence and make him its own possession.

Taesan reveals this.

Taesan grips his sword tightly.

[You have activated the Spirit Usurpation.]

Instead, he usurps the usurper.

Similar concepts collide and clash, each trying to usurp and plunder the other.

Kwaaaaaaa!

The distorted wave, covering everything in its path.

The usurper's domain begins to distort and become unstable, its ownership wavering and losing its master.

[You!]

The usurper lets out a scream. A fierce cry filled with determination strikes Taesan.

[It's mine!]

Taesan has an unshakeable belief that it will definitely become his own."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His aura and power synchronize, charging towards Taesan. He tries to make Taesan a part of his existence as a usurper.

"Don't laugh."

And Taesan ridicules the usurper.

Quadruple clash!

He adds more strength to his sword-wielding hand.

The usurper, who is being usurped by Taesan, starts to lose control.

[You're mine, mine, mine, mine!]

The usurper refuses to back down. He can't back down.

He has already suffered an irreparable wound to his concept and aura. The numerous powers he had usurped were also beyond his control.

If he couldn't usurp Taesan, it was practically over.

And naturally, Taesan had no intention of being usurped.

On the contrary, he intended to plunder the usurper's existence.

"Let go."

Quadruple clash!

The sword sinks deeper. The aura of usurpation engulfs the usurper.

Their usurpations collide. Their powers and auras, like snakes, entwine and devour each other. They merge and become one.

And the victorious one is Taesan's usurpation.

From the start, the usurper had absorbed many divine punishments to gain a high aura, but compared to Taesan's pure usurpation power, he was inferior.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Moreover, the current usurper was not in a perfect state. Having absorbed numerous concepts and boundaries, they had even damaged their own authority.

Furthermore, they had suffered a great deal of damage from Taesan's attack.

In a pure battle of usurpation, there was no way they could defeat Taesan.

Everything the usurper had built up.

That existence.

It was slowly being usurped by Taesan, like a row of dominoes falling, unstoppable.

"You are..."

Taesan revealed this.

"It's mine."

The usurper heard the words they had been saying to Taesan all along.

And the usurper realized.

The fact that they had lost.

[……That's right.]

Ku ku ku ku ku….

The usurper's power was slowly dwindling. They didn't even try to usurp Taesan.

[You are the winner.]

The usurper acknowledged their defeat.

Everything they had was perfectly usurped by Taesan.

[I'll leave this solitary throne to you.]

No. Instead, the usurper willingly handed themselves over to Taesan.

The usurper's existence itself became a part of Taesan.

[Be thrown into the universe alone, without a single kin! You, a being of boundaries!]

Kwaaaaaaa!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The plunderer explodes. Everything inside begins to transform into the property of Taesan.

The plunderer, an existence, disappears into the universe and beyond.

And it is accomplished.

Taesan, the existence itself.

[You have defeated the plunderer.] [You have activated the transcendent plunder. The proficiency of [Shattered Wish] has reached 100%.] [You have activated the transcendent plunder. The proficiency of [Treasure Box] has reached 100%.] [You have activated the transcendent plunder. You have obtained [Form Changer].] [You have activated the transcendent plunder. You have obtained [The Collection of All Things that Rot].] [You have activated the transcendent plunder. You have obtained [The One Who Rules the Universe].] [You have activated the transcendent plunder. You have obtained [The Sovereign of Control].] [You have activated the transcendent plunder. You have obtained [Fallen].] [You have obtained the labyrinth [Easy Mode].] [You have obtained the labyrinth [Normal Mode].] [You have obtained the labyrinth [Hard Mode].] [You have obtained [Plunderer].] [Your transcendent [Spirit Plunder] has changed.

An uncountable number of system windows appear."

And not a single one of them was meaningless. They were all powers that approached perfect concepts.

Taesan could feel it.

What he had obtained.

And what he had become.

He turned his gaze. The dark space appeared.

The dark crack that had spread across the sky of the earth.

This was the domain of the usurper.

But now it had become his domain.

It wasn't just that. He had also obtained control over the three distorted spaces that existed beyond the universe.

He had gained control over them as well.

"Amazing."

Omnipotence was dominating Taesan.

Taesan, who had been momentarily intoxicated by power, shook his head.

This wouldn't do. Power had to be under his control. He calmed down the raging concepts and boundaries.

Before long, Taesan had regained control over himself.

Taesan emerged from the crack and looked down at the earth.

The earth was still in the midst of battle. Countless monsters were attacking humans.

And Taesan had become the master of all those monsters.

Taesan lightly snapped his fingers.

The monsters began to disappear.

* * *

"Fight!"

"Endure!"

"For victory!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

People grit their teeth and fight. Those who are at their physical limits retreat, and those who have recovered take their place. The frontline is barely maintained.

But even that was reaching its limit.

Monsters are constantly summoned, but there is a limit to the number of people. As their physical strength, skills, and items are consumed, they are slowly pushed back.

Kwaaaang!

In the end, the frontline collapses. An S-grade monster blows away the hardcore players with its body.

"Wait!"

Iteayeon is shocked. But she has no room to help others. The assassin takes advantage of the brief moment and targets her neck.

Kagagagak!

"Kkkkkuuu!"

"Iteayeon!"

"It's okay. I..."

Iteayeon barely manages to block the attack, muttering to herself.

She and Amelia are combining their strength to block the assassin. It's a feat in itself, and they can't spare any strength for anything else.

Diana and Beldegeia, Kang Jun-hyuk and Minerva are doing their best, but there are too many S-grade monsters.

Kuuuuung!

People are blown away. The frontline begins to collapse one by one.

It's the limit.

Iteayeon grits her teeth. It's a moment when despair is swirling in her eyes.

[Your victory.]

A sudden system window appears.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And the monsters' movements come to a halt. The person who was waiting for death with their eyes closed at the front line slowly opens their eyes.

"......Huh?"

Like a broken doll, the monsters' movements completely stop. The people who were rushing in with evil faces freeze.

"Huh, what's going on?"

"What's happening?"

People are confused and unable to understand the situation.

Suddenly, the monsters start to disappear one by one.

Even the S-grade monsters that could destroy a planet on their own, and the apostles who could rival the immortals, crumble into dust as if they were nothing.

It's only then that people realize what's happening.

A light shines in their eyes. Lee Tae-yeon cracks a smile.

"We won."

A belated cheer erupts.

"Woohoo!"

"We did it!"

Taesan has emerged victorious.

They have survived.

The cheers shake the earth.

* * *

Taesan lands on the ground. The people who discover Taesan immediately rush towards him.

"Taesan-nim! Taesan-nim!"

"You've won!"

"Ah, ah, ah! We believed in you!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Their cheers and applause ring in my ears. And familiar faces, well-known to Taesan, approach.

"Taesan."

"I Taeyeon."

I Taeyeon approaches Taesan with a smile.

"I won."

Taesan nods his head.

"You also did well."

It seems I Taeyeon must have faced a formidable opponent.

A being of the same level as the one who had driven her to death in her past life.

Against such an existence, I Taeyeon emerged victorious.

She has also become stronger, in many ways.

"It's not just what you did."

"Did you really do it?"

"Mr. Taesan......"

"Hyung!"

"Hyungnim."

Amelia, Geum Jung-geun, Gang Jun-hyeok, and Kim Hwi-yeon also approach.

They have won.

The fact is joyful, yet unbelievable. Something feels unreal.

"Just wait a moment."

Taesan looks up at the sky.

There, a black crack appears.

The beginning of everything.

As it appears, their daily lives are disrupted.

Taesan snaps his fingers.

"Close it."

Kkkkkk.

The realm begins to obey its master's command.

The massive, circular crack that covers the sky.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It started making a creaking sound as if it was being crushed. The size gradually decreased, and it was destroyed.

Taesan clenched his fist.

With a strange explosive sound, the crack was completely compressed. Everything inside was sucked into Taesan's body.

"Ah……."

"Uh-uh."

People let out a cheer.

The sky was extremely clear.

Due to the aftermath of the battle, not a single cloud was left, and it was perfectly clear.

It was a sight that no one had ever seen before.

Only then did people realize.

That it was over.

That they had won. That everything had truly come to an end.

* * *

Contrary to expectations, there was no grand celebration of joy.

People were too exhausted, having risked their lives and given it their all. Everyone was in a state of slight fatigue. People were either sitting down, looking dazed, or quietly gathering to chat.

But they were all rejoicing.

At the fact that they had won.

At the fact that there would be no more forced returns.

At the fact that they had reclaimed the Earth.

They were rejoicing to the point where they couldn't be happier.

"Hmm."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan was worried about Taesan Road.

He had defeated the usurper. And in the process, he had gained too much power.

Among them was a power that could affect other players.

So, how should he handle it?

That was the worry.

But the worry didn't last long. The space had been torn apart.

Taesan looked up. He could see who it was, how much power they had, what kind of aura they possessed, and what their limits were.

He could see everything.

"A wizard."

It wasn't just a wizard.

"And Lord Arilnan."

The wizard who created the labyrinth and the God of Cycles appeared, tearing apart the space.
