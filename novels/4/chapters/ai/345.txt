Chapter 346

346. 73rd floor, Special Skill Activation. Copy (4)

Malacos falls down. At the same time, the system window appears.

[You have won two identical battles against the same enemy.] [You have obtained the Special Skill [Copy].]

Copy. Finally, I have obtained that skill. Tai Shan's tense muscles relaxed.

Pffft.

The fragments of bones began to rise.

Malacos's empty eyes glowed with a sinister light.

He couldn't accept the fact that he had become the experimental subject of his opponent. He was filled with anger and grasped his staff.

"There's nothing more to see for you."

Tai Shan kicked his foot. His body flew towards the gap where the Life Vessel was located. The Life Vessel burst open with a scream.

The 73rd floor ended like that.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Your spiritual energy has been activated.] [Your permanent mana has increased to 434, and your intelligence has increased to 112.] [Your spiritual energy has been activated.] [Your permanent magic proficiency has increased by 1%, and your proficiency in the frozen world has increased by 1%…….] [Your spiritual energy has been activated.] [You have obtained the basic magic [Magnetic Storm].]

Tae-san sharpened his sword.

***

"It was surprisingly easy to obtain."

Malacos was a perfect opponent for copying and obtaining the perfect magic.

Not only did he possess the same power as Tae-san, but he also had excellent skills. However, he was no match for Tae-san.

While he had a unique sense of self-respect, he was unable to commit suicide by throwing himself at Tae-san's attack.

Even knowing that Tae-san's answer would be destruction, he had to move forward.

In short, Malacos was a variable that Tae-san could control.

Therefore, Tae-san's task was extremely simple.

It was enough to understand the patterns of the eight magic spells used by Malacos.

When he judged himself to be at a disadvantage, he would use a certain magic. When he judged himself to be at an advantage, he would use a different magic. When Tae-san approached, he would use a magic that Tae-san wouldn't expect. When Tae-san was already close, he would use a magic that Tae-san had already prepared for.

He would understand and remember all these conditions.

[But it seems like a tough task.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The ghost whispered softly. At first glance, Malakos only chose the correct answer, so it seemed that analyzing the situation and deducing the conclusion was possible.

However, Malakos was a seasoned adventurer who had gone deep into the depths.

Even if his physical body disappeared, he possessed exceptional judgment and talent.

He could calculate thousands of possibilities in an instant and make a decision in no time, owning the ability to possess such skills.

The fact that he was forced to only choose the correct answer meant that he had to calculate an incredibly large number of possibilities, exceeding even the magical abilities of a deep-seated mage.

At least, it was impossible for the ghost. It was possible for someone like the Mountain God, who could calculate numerous skills and determine the possibilities to obtain them directly.

The Mountain God opened the skill menu.

[Basic Magic: Mana Decision Dash] [Consumed Mana: 100] [Proficiency: 1%] [Patternizes the decided mana and dashes.]

I had mastered the usage method, its power and range while fighting against Malakos. Although it was useless against a strong opponent, it had some value in terms of controlling the space, so I could find some use for it.

And I had spent four days training to obtain this skill.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Special Skill: Copy] [Mana Consumption: 20] [Proficiency: 1%] [Copies the result of a specific action. Currently, only attacks can be copied. This skill has a 1-hour cooldown.]

In just a few sentences, the meaning was incredibly profound.

The ghost smiled wryly.

[It's basically four times the attack power.]

Mount Tai could have unleashed an attack power of over 10,000 with skills like Addition, Valor's Sword, and Conversion.

Additionally, this skill added an equivalent amount of attack power. If you only consider the power contained in a single strike, even a 100th-level adventurer could not surpass Mount Tai's current attack power.

[The cooldown is also surprisingly short, considering its performance. According to the skill description, it seems that in the future, not just attacks, but other things can also be copied. This is another thing.]

Copy is a skill that refuses to be understood. The ghost shook its head.

[Just in case, I'll ask, but how many skills like Copy or Addition, which are completely useless, did you get?]

"How many times did you get it?"

The ghost nodded in agreement to the calm response.

[Yes, that's right. That's what it is. Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense.]

The labyrinth's system gives adventurers a skill that corresponds to the result of their actions when they achieve a specific outcome.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, it was impossible to say that the result of that action was truly correct. After putting in a lot of effort for several months, there was a high possibility that the skills obtained would be useless in actual combat.

In fact, even Taesan had experienced this. He had devoted himself to mastering one skill for over a year, but it turned out to be useless in any situation.

It was a skill that could be nullified and copied, and it was obtained after overcoming countless challenges.

When Taesan had finally achieved his goal, he was about to enter the labyrinth.

The contract within him began to stir. The contract's target was calling out to him, requesting his attention.

Taesan stopped in his tracks.

[You are the King of the Wind Spirits. You have summoned Minerva.]

The wind gathered and took on the form of a woman.

She stepped onto the ground, her eyes gleaming with a gentle smile.

"Hello, master! It seems you've won without any trouble, don't you think?"

"Thanks to you, what's going on?"

Minerva scratched her cheek.

"It's a bit complicated, but... could we come to our world?"

Taesan hesitated for a moment.

"Are you talking about the Spirit Realm?"

[Are you inviting this guy to the Spirit Realm?]

"Yes."

Minerva nodded her head.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The demon has gone mad. Don't you remember? I think I need a little help from the master related to that."

---

The mountain shook its foot.

The backlash was a full-blown force of nature.

The concentration was so thick that it was hard to breathe. Even a outstanding spirit like that could not resist the force of nature and was on the verge of collapse.

The master looked around.

It was incredibly vibrant.

The rainbow-colored mist spread out in all directions, and the spirits' aura could be felt as they wandered around.

"This is the spirit world. What's wrong?"

Minerva smiled brightly and raised her arm. The power she was feeling now was stronger and more refined than when she summoned it last.

It wasn't long before Barkazza also appeared.

[Just got here, master.] [You're inviting outsiders into the spirit world? Even the king's contractors can't enter here?]

There was a hint of surprise in the ghostly voice. Minerva opened her mouth.

"This time, the master is also related to the story. It's a rare event that's hard to find even in the history of spirits, so other kings must have thought carefully before making a decision."

She turned her body around, looking towards the massive green tree at the end.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Come over here first."

Tae-san followed her into the spirit realm.

Many gazes were fixed on him, most of which were hostile.

"It's not good."

"Although I don't like saying this, the master has already defeated many spirits, right? Even if we understand the situation, it's impossible to avoid being hostile."

Minerva waved her hand, and the winds howled, causing the spirits to jump in surprise and flee.

The hostile spirits were only mid-to-high-ranking. Given the current Tae-san, he could have defeated them with one blow, so Tae-san didn't take it seriously.

Tae-san was interested in a different part.

Tae-san created a flower that shone with a transparent color.

Inside was a power that could be used as a material for partial world transformation.

"Can't I take it?"

"What's here? It's difficult? It's forbidden for things from the spirit realm to leave, you know. If it were possible, I would have brought it back for the master."

The material for partial world transformation was used up entirely. Since it needed to be replenished again, Tae-san was disappointed.
Here is the translation of the text:

As Tai Shan looked around, he entered a massive tree in the central realm of the Spirit World.

[You've come.] [I'm here.] [Are you that human?]

There were five Spirit Kings gathered there, each possessing different attributes such as earth, water, and darkness. They had both curiosity and caution towards Tai Shan, and seemed to be testing him with a subtle atmosphere.

Tai Shan didn't even glance at them, ignoring the pressure that was building up. Although he was strong, he was still weaker than Vishnu, who had dug deep into the mysteries. He was not Tai Shan's enemy.

The Spirit Kings who were looking at Tai Shan opened their mouths in silence.

[…This human has such power?] [Vishnu, that guy is about to fall apart. What's this?]

Their words were filled with awe and astonishment. Tai Shan looked at a bird that was quietly emitting a bright light from behind him.

The Spirit Kings sensed a power that was different from that of other Spirit Kings from Tai Shan.

At least, it was on the level of an immortal being. Tai Shan was no match for this opponent at his current level.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Greetings. I am the contract holder of the Spirit King. I am Eriel, the Spirit King of Light, who has existed since the birth of the Spirit Realm.]

Eriel gestured to the other Spirit Kings.

[I'll start by talking to that one. Please just be quiet for a moment.]

["As you said, Eriel, I'll come too."]

The other Spirit Kings, who seemed to have a high level of authority among them, quietly followed Eriel's words.

The heavens opened.

"What's the matter that you're summoning me for?"

Minerva said that the Spirit Kings were summoning the owner due to a problem related to the wayward spirits, and it was up to the owner to decide whether to accept or reject.

Since there was no reason to refuse, the heavens accepted.

Eriel slowly fluttered her wings.

[There's something I want to propose to you.]

The space opened up, revealing a pure white aura.

The heavens recognized what it was.

A wayward spirit. A spirit that had been defeated by the Fire Spirit King and had achieved their own desires, but was now a broken existence, containing their will and soul.

[What a pitiful existence.]

Eriel's voice was filled with pity.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The traitorous spirit king of fire, Vishnu, who abandoned our father and left the realm. She wanted to transcend the limits of her life. The maddened spirit is a tool created to maintain its own existence.]

Eriol said nothing.

[I couldn't stop Vishnu from leaving. As a responsible person, I want to help the maddened spirit live a normal life. But unfortunately, I am powerless.]

Eriol is one of the strongest among the spirit kings.

However, he is still a spirit.

[As a spirit, I cannot touch another spirit without my father's permission. That's why I need your help.]

The space was torn apart, and a fiery bead appeared.

Vishnu was defeated, and the nucleus of the spirit king of fire was obtained by Tai Shan.

[I can give the power of the unowned spirit, which already exists, to the maddened spirit. But the owner of this nucleus is none other than you.]

The ownership was with Tai Shan, and it was to confirm this that Tai Shan was summoned to the spirit realm.
How would you like to proceed? You can choose the option you want. After all, the owner of this is ultimately you. However, if you accept my suggestion, I can give you a sincere response.

Tai Shan quietly listened to Eriol's suggestion and opened his mouth.
