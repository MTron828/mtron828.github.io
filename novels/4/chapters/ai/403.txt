Chapter 404

404. 81st Floor, High-Ranking Magic (4)

Taesan gathered all his strength throughout his body.

The enemy in front of him was an immortal.

Not a being who had lost their self like a machine, nor a being who used power that was exhausted like a apostle of the gods.

It was a pure immortal with no penalties whatsoever.

The two of them had reached the same level. However, Taesan's magic was sealed, and most of his skills were blocked. The chances of winning were extremely low. Taesan opened his mouth.

"How many times can I challenge you?"

"Of course. I didn't think I could win from the very first battle."

"Then let's do it."

Taesan didn't think about holding back in the first round. He finished all his preparations, and Wiraerd grasped his staff.

"Let's start with something light."

Kiiing.

A black dot appeared on the staff. Wiraerd waved the staff.

The dot became a line.

There was no ripple or disturbance in the air. The line was drawn calmly, like a brush stroke on a canvas, and flew towards Taesan with a quiet, powerful wave. It was a power that didn't even feel like an attack.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Tae-san feinted late. His skills were sealed, but his stats remained the same. He swiftly threw his body to dodge the black line.

Kwng!

The black line that hit the brown floor disappeared with a small sound.

'It's not that fast.'

Despite his reaction being slow, he was able to effortlessly dodge it. If this is the maximum speed, he could dodge any attack that comes his way.

"It's quite fast. I won't be able to reach it even if I attack like this."

Wird also realized this and lifted his staff.

The previous attack was just a simple probe.

This is where it gets real.

A point is drawn, and it becomes a line.

It was the same speed as the previous attack. Just as Tae-san was about to dodge and rush towards Wird.

Kying.

The line split.

Dozens, hundreds of lines were poured out. The split lines rushed through the space like lightning, tearing it apart.

There is no space to dodge. Tae-san quickly made a judgement and gathered mana.

*You have activated a world of frost.*
*You have activated a star arrow.*
*You have activated magic concentration.*

Ice and star arrows rush.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The immortal Taesan's intermediate-level magic. Its power is on a different dimension from what we've seen so far. Even with this light touch, it contained enough power to bring the guiding leaders to the brink of death.

But the moment it clashed with the Black Line, everything was shattered.

The frozen world turned into ice fragments and scattered, and the starlight arrow lost its light as it was crushed by the Black Line.

Taesan hastily twisted his body. The Black Line slammed into the ground.

Ku-gu-gu-gung......

Taesan didn't take any damage. Although the frozen world and the starlight arrow couldn't block the Black Line, they created a space for Taesan to dodge by twisting their trajectory.

Taesan clicked his tongue.

With intermediate-level magic, it was impossible to counter the power of the Willard, and it was only possible to barely twist the trajectory.

But in other words, it meant that with Taesan's current abilities, he could respond to some extent even with the power of an immortal using intermediate-level magic.

"It's usable."

A calm voice was heard, and five black dots were drawn. This time, it wasn't just one.

The lines poured down at once. Taesan roughly swung his hand and gathered his mana.

* * *

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The Black Line covered the world, occupying the space and crushing everything in its path.

And within that, Taesan continued to move without stopping."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Kiying!

A black dot is created right next to Taesan. As Taesan reflexively gathers mana, the black dot simultaneously shoots out lines in all directions like a hedgehog.

[You have activated Distortion.] [You have activated Forced Exclusion.]

Taesan distorts the trajectory of the lines and forcefully pushes them away with his physical strength. With Double Casting, Taesan can handle two types of magic at the same time.

But there was no time to rest. Hundreds of lines poured out from the black dot that appeared in the air.

[You have activated Magic Overlap.] [You have activated the Unquenchable Flame Bird.] [You have activated Magic Release.]

The overlapping Flame Bird appears in the world.

It emits intense heat, as if it's going to burn the world, and blocks the lines.

Taesan uses the shield of the guardian in the meantime and focuses his detection on the wizard and the black dot.

Kiying!

But it's blocked. The mana wave wrapped around the wizard doesn't allow the detection to activate. The wizard calmly waves his staff."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Other magicians might be able to grasp it with that, but it's impossible for me."

Ku ku ku ku ku!

The line pierces through the flame bird. The flame bird, which had been desperately holding on, finally disappears.

Wylard holds up his staff. Black dots appear in multiple spaces.

The lines pour down like a storm.

And yet, there was no ripple or disturbance in the power, making it difficult to detect. Normally, with his acquired resonance eyes and enhanced senses, it wouldn't be hard to grasp, but now both of those skills were sealed. He had to sharpen his entire body's senses, expand his field of vision, and directly observe and dodge.

"It's hopeless like this."

He was using all his strength just to block the black lines that were pouring down, let alone approach Wylard. His mana was also being consumed little by little, and if this continued, defeat was certain.

He even tried a limited blink, but Wylard wouldn't allow it. Taesan realized for the first time that a high-level magician like Wylard could block the activation of a limited blink itself.

He takes a gamble.

With a decision, Taesan's body leaps through the air.

[You have activated a random blink.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The moment of teleportation to an unknown location. The black lines poured towards Taesan, but there was a slight delay that couldn't be helped.

Taesan quickly overlapped his magic. He gathered the frozen world and burst it apart.

Zzzt!

The cold energy of the extreme cold spread towards the world.

The black lines started to push back momentarily. Taesan took advantage of the gap and unleashed his magic all at once.

[You activated the unquenchable flame bird.] [You activated the starlight arrow.] [You activated the earthquake.]

The magic spells were implemented in succession, engulfing the world. With the help of his continuous skill, Taesan's magic speed and power increased gradually. The black lines were slowly pushed back by Taesan.

"Is this endurance? It's not bad, but it's not the answer."

Wirard waved his hand. The black lines were implemented in four directions, centered around Taesan.

Zzzt!

And the black lines merged with each other, drawing the shape of a labyrinth.

Taesan started to create a physical barrier that he couldn't escape from. Wirard intended to suffocate Taesan to death.

But Taesan had also predicted Wirard's actions.

Kuku kuku kung!

The magic poured out relentlessly."

Note: It appears to be a fantasy story with magic and action elements. The names "Taesan" and "Wirard" seem to be characters in the story.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In an instant, dozens of colorful magic spells filled the field of vision. The seven wizards watching from a different location burst into cheers.

"Wow……."

"What is that?"

The intermediate-level magic was something they could also handle. But the power of the magic that Taesan was currently displaying was on a completely different dimension from theirs.

"Is that the level required to be granted advanced magic permission……?"

They all realized how far away their desired path was.

Even Wiraed was overwhelmed by Taesan's magic, which was pouring out relentlessly.

"How much mana does he have?"

Even if he was an immortal, he couldn't handle intermediate-level magic like that. In terms of pure mana quantity, Taesan surpassed even Wiraed himself.

Magic spells that exceeded his predictions poured out, and as a result, Taesan's appearance was momentarily obscured by the scattered mana.

The trajectory of the black lines that had lost Taesan momentarily warped, and Taesan didn't miss the opportunity.

Taesan fired the starlight arrow he had prepared in advance. The light filled the world and poured out. It precisely targeted the gap in the black lines and flew towards Wiraed."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Weirard tried to handle the black dot and block it, and Taesan activated his skill at that moment.

[You have activated Magic Separation.]

Hundreds of light arrows split apart and shot out.

The black line was certainly powerful, but since it was a form of line, it couldn't occupy space itself and block the attack. Taesan thought he would immediately launch his next attack after seeing Weirard's response.

'Excellent.'

Weirard admired.

Taesan, whose powers except for magic were sealed, was significantly weaker than himself.

However, Taesan didn't give up and aimed for the gap, and actually achieved results just before succeeding.

"I didn't think I'd show you this from the start."

Weirard muttered, shaking his line.

The line stretched out long, and soon became a surface.

The black surface covered Weirard's body. The starlight arrows collided with the surface.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

A loud noise erupted, making the surroundings bright like a flash of light.

And when the light faded, Taesan clicked his tongue.

The black surface that protected Weirard didn't have a single scratch.

"The magic I wield is points, lines, and surfaces.""
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Weirard grasped his staff. Dozens of black dots simultaneously formed in the air.

"As long as you can't overcome three things, it's impossible to push me back from this place."

With a calm voice, black lines descended.

* * *

"Did you come?"

As Taesan entered the library, Elia was waiting with an amazed expression.

"You're really strong."

"I may have lost, but I was strong too."

"I told you, didn't I? We're different. The old man reached the pinnacle with his own magic. You're definitely strong like a monster, but the old man is also strong like a monster."

Even if he didn't have the restriction of not being able to use skills outside of magic, he couldn't guarantee a certain victory. Weirard had that much power.

He had to respond to such a strong opponent with only magic. The chances of winning were severely lacking.

"But it's not like I didn't gain anything."

Weirard's magic. The unit of matter.

There was no sign of any power, and no sense of oppression was felt. The way he controlled that magic was extremely simple.

"Concentrating mana to the limit."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

By compressing and compressing mana, I create a single black dot. By extending the compressed power, I create a line, and by broadening the line, I create a surface.

The theory was extremely simple, but its power was immense. Since the mana was compressed to the limit, the wave of power didn't leak out, making it impossible to read the signs of magic activation. The power of compressed mana was also certain.

The drawback was that the area affected by the power was narrow, but that drawback was also resolved by using the surface.

It was a highly useful and intricate magic.

However, it was a method that Taesan couldn't use.

His magic was a gift from the God of Magic. While some degree of transformation was possible, it was impossible to manipulate mana itself like that.

And from the start, he didn't intend to do so.

Wylard's magic was strong because he had devoted his entire life to magic.

On the other hand, magic was not Taesan's main strength.

He was an adventurer.

He was a being who obtained many powers and used them as tools. Unlike a magician, he didn't obsess over magic itself.

So, he only took the advantages.

Taesan stood up.

* * *

Taesan continued to clash with Wylard.

He had fought over fifty battles, and all of them ended in defeat.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's your defeat."

Wiral pointed to Taesan with his staff and said so. Taesan received Wiral's words without any change in expression.

As Taesan came out, Elia cheered him up.

"You failed again today... Don't worry! You'll get there soon!"

Taesan nodded silently. Elia looked at him with a pitiful face.

They were amazed by Taesan's first battle.

The power of magic. The way he used it. He had impressively pressured Wiral, who was beyond their reach, with only intermediate-level magic.

The distrust and hostility towards Taesan had completely disappeared, leaving only respect for the excellent magician.

However, the subsequent battles were all strange. Unlike the first battle, the time it took to lose was significantly shorter, and he couldn't even mount a proper counterattack.

Was he giving up and relying on luck? Elia felt sorry for him.

"Old man, what's wrong with Taesan? Is he giving up and relying on luck?"

Elia asked Wiral, who quietly replied.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Does it seem like he's giving up?"

"No way? It's too weird. He's not even responding differently and is losing too quickly."

"No, it's the opposite. He's actually searching for the answer."

Wiral waved his staff.

"Amazing. Is that the adventurer of the labyrinth? He's perfect in terms of strategy."

"Huh?"

Eliya was taken aback by the completely different evaluation.

Wiral said,

"It's not about losing quickly. Think back to the battles. Has there been a battle that was exactly the same?"

"Uh..."

Eliya paused, searching his memory.

It was just as Wiral said.

During the dozens of battles, the same pattern had never been repeated even once.

Eliya was quietly shocked.

"No way."

"I was led to react in different ways each time, and I didn't intend to do so, but as the battles continued, it eventually became like that. My combat skills are quite exceptional."

It was natural to lose quickly. He had been putting himself in danger to see Wiral's response.

"And that's not all."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Weirard recalled the gaze of Taesan, which was directed at himself.

He was observing not only his own response but also the way he controlled his power.

It was as if he was trying to obtain something.

His magic was the immortal magic that he had created himself, and it was impossible for others to steal.

But Taesan's gaze was as if it was only natural.

It stimulated Weirard's curiosity as a magician.

"What method should I use? This is interesting."

Weirard laughed. Currently, Taesan was absolutely no match for him. But at the same time, he was extremely curious about how Taesan would try to defeat him.

And a few days later.

Taesan came to Weirard again.

"Can I take the test again?"

Weirard looked at Taesan. Taesan's face was different from before. It was a face filled with confidence that he could win.

Weirard nodded.

"Accept. Adventurer of the labyrinth."
