Chapter 482

482. 91st Floor. Ouroboros (3)

Ouroboros. It wasn't a name I had heard for the first time. It was a name that was etched in my mind and impossible to forget.

The wizard chuckled slightly.

"What, you know too?"

"How could I not?"

Taesan opened his inventory.

In his hand was a rough, dusty stone.

[Ouroboros's Vomit Stone] [A divine stone that governs the cycle of all things.] [Can turn back time for one person, once.] [Usage complete.]

An item that could be said to be the starting point of everything. Thanks to this item, he was able to turn back time and make the right choice.

The wizard looked at the stone with a face full of wonder, tilting his head.

"Itaeyeon... Honestly, I have no idea. How did you get that thing?"

The gods remember the time that has passed.

Itaeyeon was an adventurer who had cleared the labyrinth. The wizard couldn't help but feel a sense of astonishment towards her.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No adventurer has ever achieved a meaningful accomplishment in the realm of Uroboros, not even the gods."

"Do you know what she did?"

"I can't see what she did in there either. That place is distorted and twisted, a place where one gets devoured by a snake. She herself couldn't say anything, and didn't say a word."

The magician's eyes were filled with admiration.

"She's an incredibly talented person. Not exactly the kind of talent suited for the purpose of the labyrinth, but it's a unique ability. Maria has chosen well."

Taesan also didn't deny it. She had earned her praise.

"So, what exactly is this place?"

What is Uroboros, anyway?

What does it mean to be a devoured world, exactly?

The magician opened his mouth.

"Uroboros. A snake that governs the cycle of all things. A being that influences the entire universe."

"Is it a god?"

"You could say it's a god, but... it's a bit ambiguous."

The magician trailed off.

"It's not a concept that became strong from its mortal days and reached enlightenment like other transcendents. It was simply born as a being that governs the cycle from the moment of its birth."

"Is it similar to Derasha?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The God of Death, Derasha. She was also a god who governed the death of the world itself from the beginning of creation. It matched Uroboros's explanation.

However, the magician shook his head.

"That concept is a bit different. Derasha is a transcendent being, whereas... Uroboros cannot be considered a transcendent being. If I had to be precise, it's more like a device."

"A device?"

"Exactly what I mean. After an extremely long time, almost an eternity, when all things reach their end. The sleeping Uroboros awakens."

The magician, who was also a transcendent being, couldn't even imagine the length of time required, and his voice sounded like he was reciting a myth.

"And it swallows up the stopped universe and starts a new cycle. That's the role given to Uroboros in the creation of the universe."

"It sounds like it wouldn't do anything now if I just listened to the explanation."

"That's originally correct. It should quietly sleep, not caring about what happens in the universe. But, you see..."

The magician had an ambiguous expression.

"Something went wrong, and the universe stopped, but it woke up way too early. It's like the device broke down."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When Uroboros woke up, it devoured a part of the world. Not only mortals, but also immortals and some transcenders were caught and eaten by Uroboros. And they couldn't come back to the world again."

"Can't even transcenders escape?"

"Uroboros is a fundamental existence that has existed since the creation of the world. No matter how powerful a transcender is, it's hard to deal with."

Transcenders are beings that govern the laws of the world. Their power comes from the laws and concepts of the world.

And Uroboros is the very concept and law itself.

It's an existence close to the source of the power that transcenders possess. That's why even transcenders couldn't intervene carelessly.

"We don't know what's happening there either. So, I'm giving you a quest."

The wizard said.

"Move to the world that was eaten by Uroboros, find out why Uroboros woke up, and what happened to the beings inside. Check that out for me."

That's the 91st floor's quest.

Taesan, who was lost in thought for a moment, asked a curious question.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Did you give a similar quest to Lee Tae-yeon as well?"

"That's right. The quest I gave her was a simple reconnaissance mission. I don't even know how she managed to get the crystal, but..."

"You sent Lee Tae-yeon to a place where even you can't approach?"

"It's not that we can't intervene at all. It's just that it's an extremely dangerous place. It's hard to understand why you would send Lee Tae-yeon there alone."

"It's a bit complicated to explain, but it's different from what you think. To put it simply, we're too big. And she was very small. It's precisely because of that that she could enter Uroboros's interior."

"......I see."

I could understand the concept. The Transcendents are incredibly powerful and strong. To the extent that if they enter Uroboros, they would be strongly bound by its mechanical power.

But Lee Tae-yeon is a mortal. From the perspective of Transcendent beings, she is extremely weak and small. It seems that's why she was able to relatively resist Uroboros's influence.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I could have taken it out directly, so you didn't have to worry about it. And unlike her, you wouldn't even need a connection."

Taesan had a boundary. The power to deny, distort, and alter the laws of the world, which could perfectly escape the influence of Oroboros.

"More than anything, Oroboros had almost stopped its activities a long time ago. But that doesn't mean it's not dangerous. We don't know what's happening inside it either."

Iteayeon couldn't specifically mention what she saw there.

It wasn't that she was hiding it on purpose, but the wizard knew that she couldn't express it, so he didn't intervene excessively.

"If you want, you can refuse. It'll take some time, but you can find something else."

"No."

Taesan shook his head.

"I don't plan on refusing."

Why refuse? It's a great opportunity. He touched the stone.

"Accept."

[Quest accepted.]

The wizard smiled.

* * *

"Let me know when you're ready. I'll send you nearby."

Taesan nodded and opened the community.

It was very lively there.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Everyone in the world was chatting with each other, sharing information. Amidst the casual conversations, there were also those who whispered words of love.

The atmosphere was extremely bright.

It was a lively atmosphere that couldn't be found in the past life. Each line of text was filled with hope.

The one who created it was Taesan. It was himself.

Taesan, who had been reading the posts for a while, opened the chat window.

[Kang Taesan[Alone] : How's it going?] [Lee Taeyeon[Alone] : Oh, what's up.] [Amelia Eirin[Alone] : You're the first to speak. What's going on?] [Kang Junhyuk[Alone] : Wow, hyung? Long time no see.]

The posts came flooding in, as if they had been waiting. Taesan couldn't help but laugh at the speed at which they were coming, which was impossible to achieve if he wasn't constantly monitoring the community.

[Kang Taesan[Alone] : Were you watching the community?] [Lee Taeyeon[Alone] : Yeah, that's right.] [Kang Junhyuk[Alone] : You know, hyung. It's too lonely here. We need to relieve our stress somehow.]

It wasn't a wrong thing to say. The Alone mode was, after all, a place where one was alone. It was hard to find a perfect ally. As such, it was inevitable to find comfort in the community.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Taesan knew that, so he didn't say anything more about it and got straight to the point.

[Taesan [Alone]: How far have you all gotten now?]

They each mentioned the level they had reached.

Gang Jun-hyuk was in the middle of the 60th floor, and Amelia had cleared the 72nd floor.

[Amelia Airin [Alone]: It's definitely gotten harder since the deeper levels. But thanks to the contract with you, it's been easier than I thought.]

Amelia had made a contract with Taesan and was able to use the power of the apostle. Most importantly, she had realized her own strengths.

She now had the possibility of not being inferior to Lee Tae-yeon. It wasn't strange that she was able to descend to the deeper levels without much difficulty.

[Gang Jun-hyuk [Alone]: You're amazing... I'm going to die from exhaustion starting from here.]

[Taesan [Alone]: Of course it's hard at the 60th floor. That's enough. Take your time, don't make any mistakes, and come down slowly. I'll have something to give you when we meet later.]

Taesan, who was now able to make contracts with others, had Gang Jun-hyuk as his next target for the apostle's contract."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[ Gangjunhyeok [Alone] : Yeah. I have to try harder. Thank you, hyung.] [ Gangtaesan [Alone] : What about Lee Taeyeon?] [ Lee Taeyeon [Alone] : Me? I'm on the 78th floor.] [ Amelia Airin [Alone] : This speed is like a monster's.]

Amelia grumbled. She was also doing her best to go down, but Lee Taeyeon was much faster.

"If it's the 78th floor, it's the library of the heavens."

For Lee Taeyeon, it was a floor that posed no problem. She already knew the location of the unread books in the library, which even the administrator, Jorge, didn't know.

No matter how similar their abilities were, Lee Taeyeon's experience of having cleared it once before made her faster, which was unavoidable.

After confirming their locations, Taesan began to have a serious conversation.

They talked about what they were doing there, what would appear next, and the conditions for acquiring skills. They listened intently to Taesan's advice.

The conversation continued, with each topic leading to the next, and after a certain level of clarity was achieved, two hours had passed.

[ Gangtaesan [Alone] : Let's just remember this much for now.] [ Amelia Airin [Alone] : Got it. Thanks.] [ Gangjunhyeok [Alone] : Thanks always, hyung.]

The two of them left the chat window to head back down into the labyrinth.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan grabbed Taeyeon, who was trying to leave together.

[Taesan [Alone]: I have something to talk to you about, so wait a minute.] [Taeyeon [Alone]: Ah, okay. What's going on?] [Taesan [Alone]: I've just arrived at the 91st floor.] [Taeyeon [Alone]: ……Ah.]

Taeyeon seemed to have realized something and wrote something down.

[Taeyeon [Alone]: Uroboros?] [Taesan [Alone]: That's right.] [Taeyeon [Alone]: Didn't the quest change? No, it doesn't matter anyway.] [Taesan [Alone]: What's going on?] [Taeyeon [Alone]: I can't say.]

Firm, unwavering words.

[Taeyeon [Alone]: It's just a concept like that. You might be different, since you have independent power. But I'm not.]

It was a statement that he couldn't mention what had happened there.

Taesan thought for a moment and nodded his head.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Gang Tae-san [Alone]: I know. That's enough.]

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: I'm sorry I couldn't help. By the way, if I do that, will I get the Oroboros quest again? I don't want that...]

[Gang Tae-san [Alone]: The wizard will take care of it. That's it.]

Tae-san stopped talking and closed the chat window.

The wizard watched him with a smile.

"You look okay."

"Did you see everything?"

"No, I don't think he's that rude. But I can guess what they were talking about."

"Whatever, it's fine."

Tae-san closed his eyes.

He focused his mind and recovered his exhausted powers.

A day passed, and when the holy and black colors that had been scattered on the floor returned to their original state, Tae-san opened his eyes.

The wizard's clone was waiting silently. Tae-san spoke to him.

"I'm ready. Send me to where Oroboros is."
