83. 16th Floor, Foolish Boy Who Refines Dreams (1)

The conference room of the guide to vice. People were sitting around a round table. A frivolous man who lazily watched over them as they chattered suddenly spoke as if recalling something.

"By the way, didn't he die?"

"Who said that?"

"Well, um. You know. The guy I mentioned last time."

"Oh, right."

The memory of a fiery spirit came to mind as he muttered. Those who had been fighting among themselves stopped to listen to their conversation.

"What's the matter?"

"Nothing special. It's an old story already over."

The frivolous young man replied lightly. A muscular man frowned upon hearing the explanation.

"Didn't we agree to discuss such matters after the meeting?"

"Let's discuss it with the adventurer from the 13th floor. Who would bother with such a hassle?"

"Still, talk about it. Misunderstandings could lead to incidents."

The man casually advised without seriousness. At most, he was just an adventurer from the 13th floor. They had no need to be concerned.
"So what happened then?"

"He got killed by those from below."

"Expected outcome."

The difference between the 13th and 20th floors was clear. Everyone assumed that Taesan had died on the 20th floor, but the frivolous man shook his head.

"He wasn't killed by the 2nd tier."

"Hmm?"

"Instead, the 2nd tier was the one who got heated and died because of him."

There was a moment of silence.

Interest sparked across the faces of the people.

"So the 13th floor won against the 2nd tier?"

"Is that such a remarkable feat? I've done that too. It's not difficult for those without talent and with broken spirits."

"That's because you've been a strong presence from the outside. The story's villain might be different. And even you couldn't have faced the heat."

"You wouldn't know until you try."

"That's why I said you don't know. Are you deaf?"

They babbled on. To those who had lived through long years without change, Taesan's story was an intriguing tale.

"So, in the end, did he get killed by the 2nd tier?"

"No? Wasn't there talk of a feud with the 3rd tier?"

The muscular man frowned.

"The 30th floor?"

"Yeah."
The frivolous man nodded his head.

Silence fell once again.

"...Is that even possible?"

"Mm."

When they heard the story of winning against the 2nd tier, they were surprised but somewhat accepted it. It was plausible enough given their capabilities.

But if it were the 3rd tier, the story would change.

"...Seems difficult for me too."

"If it's the 20th floor, it's possible. But if it's the 30th floor... it's impossible. The 13th floor me wasn't that strong."

"Even if it's the Dragon's Child?"

"No. From what I've heard, they were just ordinary humans. Even if they were the Dragon's Child, there's no way they'd die together, right?"

"Hmm..."

Defeating the 20th floor and defeating the 30th floor are completely different issues. In this place with accelerated growth rates, even a difference of one floor is significant. Yet, they died together facing an opponent with a staggering difference of 17 floors.

"What a waste."

There was regret in the voice. If they were adventurers of that caliber, they could have been a great asset to them as well. The spirit of injustice spoke calmly.
"Anyway, he's the one who rejected our proposal. In the end, we've become enemies."

"So, who died?"

"A child of the Demons. A guy named Jagan."

"Demon..."

The expression of the red-haired woman murmuring slightly distorted.

"Is he someone worth using?"

"No, it's someone else."

"Oh, really?"

Instantly, the interest in their voices disappeared. It was surprising that the 13th floor defeated the 3rd tier, but the 3rd tier adventurers themselves were of no interest to them.

The spirit of injustice spoke.

"He's dead. Regardless of this or that, unless there's a reincarnation of a lion, there's no chance of meeting again."

"Come to think of it, wasn't he on a quest as a hero?"

The gaze of the frivolous young man focused on one place.

The ashy-haired girl opened her mouth bluntly.

"What's up."

"No, it's nothing."

They tacitly agreed to change the subject.

That was the end of the story about Taesan.

"As the spirit of injustice said, it doesn't matter who's dead. We should talk about what's ahead."

The sturdy man slammed the table.
"Let's go over the strategy for conquering the 74th floor again."

"Have we done this more than two hundred times?"

"Exactly 234 times."

They chuckled and began their discussion with serious expressions.

* * *

Taesan, who cleared the 14th floor, sees his rewards. Due to the continuous appearance of the Guide of Sin, they hadn't even had a chance to check.

The standard clear reward for the 14th floor was ankle guards.

[Ankle Guards of the Ravine] [Magic +4] [Defense +3] [Ankle guards made deep in the ravine, imbued with deep-sea magic.]

"A tribute indeed."

Unless magic items were extraordinarily good, they were all intended as tribute.

And the secret reward was a bracelet.

[Bracelet with Seven Hundred Seventy Symbols] [Strength +10] [Defense +4] [Inside a small bracelet are countless symbols that seem to have all been carved by human hands.]

Not a bad piece of equipment.

He puts it on.

As a secret room reward, he receives two runes of intelligence. Using them raises his intelligence by 10.

And then he descends to the 15th floor.
[Quest Start: 15th Floor.] [Defeat the boss of the 15th floor and proceed.] [Reward: Sapphire Staff] [Secret Reward: ???]

"Passing through."

He greets the dwarf and immediately descends.

The monsters on the 15th floor are Skeleton Knights. With only bones for bodies, they demonstrate rough swordsmanship and swift speed.

Taesan pulls out his arm.

*Crack.*

Bones shatter as the skull flies off into the distance.

Taesan breaks through the room.

There were floors where two monsters came out at the same time, but it made no difference. With a single blow, he crushes the sword, slashes through the chest, and swings his fist to blow off the head.

Too easy.

It was truly overwhelming. Even if these monsters on the 15th floor were opponents who would risk their lives for Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Jun-hyuk, they were too weak for Taesan.

Even ordinary monsters wouldn't stand a chance against adventurers as their stats soared ridiculously high. Taesan continues forward without stopping, cutting down monsters.

His level does not increase. Currently, Taesan's level is 41. It's nearly identical to the level on the 20th floor. Monsters on the 15th floor do not provide proper experience points.
Similarly, the increase in experience points didn't function properly either. Without any particular excitement, he crumpled and trampled through them as a matter of course.

Using the information from the guide of sin, he promptly found the secret room.

He disarmed and disposed of traps. And killed the boss.

It didn't even take twenty minutes.

The reward from the secret room was a ring.

[Frost Ring] [Defense +4] [1% chance to freeze the opponent upon attack.]

And the clear reward. Sapphire Staff.

[Sapphire Staff] [Magic +14] [Sapphires have long been known as excellent gems for gathering magical power. The value of a staff embedded with such a sapphire is not insignificant.]

And the secret reward.

[Bow Made from Troll Tendons] [Attack +17] [Accuracy +50%] [Troll tendons are extremely tough with strong elasticity and even possess regenerative abilities. They have long been perfect materials for archery.]

He hadn't been using the bow due to the presence of magic, but having it didn't hurt.

Taesan gathered his rewards and went to find Release. She was now moving her luggage down to the 14th floor, grumbling.

"...Already down to the 15th floor?"
She looked at the half-moved luggage with a helpless expression.

Putting aside her hardships, Taesan offered her two items he had brought and taught her a basic magic she had learned.

[Basic Magic: Slow] [Mana Cost: 12] [Proficiency: 1%] [Slows down the speed of the target. The degree of slowdown varies depending on the target. There is a chance of failure.]

"Let me demonstrate it once."

Release used Slow on Taesan.

[No need to check! Taesan resisted Slow.]

"...It didn't work?"

"I'll try."

Taesan cast Slow on Release. Unlike Taesan, it succeeded without needing a check.

"It... feels like everything's... ssslowwwiinngg doowwnn."

It felt like forcibly slowing down a video. Release staggered.

"It seems it doesn't slow down that much."

"Now that I've gotten used to it..."

Judging from Release's movements, she seemed about 20% slower. Perhaps the stronger the opponent, the higher the chance of failure and the less the slowdown effect.

Nevertheless, it was a good spell to consider, especially since speed was crucial in any level of combat.
There, the subject of judgment isn't just enemies, but all targets.

Maybe even magic or objects are included.

"I might enjoy finding it."

The scope of application, how far the judgment extends.

The process of finding such things was quite enjoyable.

Release said with a frustrated expression.

"Please h-h-help."

"How do I help you?"

"W-what?"

"This is my first time learning magic too, so I don't know. I don't have a skill to undo it. Don't you know?"

"...I'm not sure."

Release's face turned pale. Even the speed at which it turned pale was about 20% slower, which was somewhat absurd.

* * *

Fortunately for Release, after about ten minutes, it naturally unraveled. She was greatly surprised, but it was beneficial since Taesan had also figured out the duration.

Taesan immediately headed for the 16th floor.

[16th Floor Quest Initiated.] [Defeat the boss of the 16th floor and proceed.] [Reward: Hammer] [Secret Reward: ???]

The monsters on the 16th floor are called Laces, Taesan said.

"Your friends."

"Noisy."
With light-hearted banter, they advance through the floors. It's a rather tricky monster that physical attacks won't work on, but it can't be an enemy to Taesan, who has learned magic. Shooting dozens of Frost Arrows, they quickly move forward.

Before long, they were able to find the room adventurers had mentioned.

A blue door, unlike the usual doors.

Taesan entered there.

A warm heat wafts through. The crackling sound of flames echoes. While the walls of the labyrinth on the 20th floor are generally red, here they are even redder.

Clang, clang.

The cheerful sound of hammering spreads.

There was a man there.

He wasn't human. He was a dwarf. However, he was different from a shop owner. If the shop owner was about half Taesan's height with a full beard, typical of dwarves, the dwarf before them was the opposite.

Firstly, he was tall. Not as tall as an average human, but definitely taller than the shop owner.

And his chin was clean-shaven, smooth, unlike the full beard, and his entire body was a rugged, dusty color.

[You have encountered the dull-witted blacksmith who refines dreams.]

Bang.

Along with the system window, the sound of hammering ceased.

"Are you adventurers?"
The man's voice, surprisingly clear for a man, echoed. Taesan nodded. The dwarf who had been observing Taesan turned his gaze towards the ghost.

"You've come too?"

[Not surprised?]

"With a clueless one who doesn't even tell the truth, there's no way he wouldn't find his way down here somehow. It's been a while."

[Since the last time I was alive, it's been quite a while.]

The clueless one is probably talking about an ogre sage. Indeed, NPCs and monsters with intellect seem to interact with adventurers.

The dwarf, momentarily looking at the ghost, turned his attention to Taesan with apparent disinterest.

"Is he the one who took on your quest this time?"

[Yeah.]

"Surprising. With all the recent commotion, I thought someone would come to clean up."

[I haven't been quiet. I killed them all.]

At the calm response, the dwarf's eyes showed surprise for the first time.

"That's impressive. To defeat adventurers on the 20th floor..."

[Well, it's not exactly that...]

The ghost swallowed the rest of his words. The dwarf extended his hand.

"What's your name?"

"Taesan. Kang Taesan."

"No need for formality. We're on equal footing here."

Blacksmith.
Lee Taeyeon had received a lot of equipment crafted by him. She had said that if he hadn't been there, she wouldn't have been able to reach the depths.

"I am Harfran. I'll be counting on you."
