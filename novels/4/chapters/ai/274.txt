Chapter 275

275. 61st Floor, Test Site (6)

[High-Grade Attack Power Boost Potion] [Permanently increases attack power by 200.] [High-Grade Defense Power Boost Potion] [Permanently increases defense power by 400.]

Taesan's lips curled up.

The increase in attack and defense power was absurdly high. Taesan had the advantage of having the "Eye of the Tiger" skill, so the effect was slightly diminished, but for other adventurers, their attack power would have increased significantly.

And for Taesan, it was only a slight boost, but it was a much better potion than any decent equipment.

Other equipment would need to be replaced over time, but this potion was permanent. Once used, there was no need to worry about it again.

And the ring. Taesan wore a steel ring adorned with a blue gemstone.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Singing Jewel and Resonating Steel Ring] [+300 Health] [+300 Mana] [+100 Strength] [+100 Agility] [+100 Intelligence] [+30 Magic] [+80 Attack Power] [+80 Defense] [The jewel sings and the steel resonates, amplifying and reinforcing each other's abilities.] [When using basic or intermediate magic, there is a 50% chance to activate twice in a row.]

Taesan wore a satisfied expression once again.

The ring could be worn on any of the ten fingers. However, the performance of each ring was relatively lower compared to other equipment.

There were excellent rings, but most of them were specialized in one particular ability.

The pair of rings made by Halfdan was an exception. They could be used beyond the depths.

On the other hand, this ring had superior abilities in all aspects, comparable to mid-level equipment.

Furthermore, it had a special effect that allowed it to activate twice in a row with a 50% chance when using intermediate magic.

Now that he was using intermediate magic, he didn't use basic magic for attacks, but the story was different for support magic.

Considering there were no restrictions on magic, it was possible to use continuous spells like random blinking or aerial jumps. That would be a huge advantage.

"I'll be able to use it for a long time even in the depths. I actually used it until the 85th floor."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

Belldegia said, "The ring changes slowly, so if it's this capable, it could be used until then."

[Obtained the Magician's Music Box.] [A music box created by a magician who couldn't save the princess, filled with emotions.] [Now it contains the song of the ruined world, searching for the peace of the soul.]

Simple explanation: Taesan looked at Belldegia, who opened his mouth with a bitter expression.

"I made it. If I meet the princess, I'll give it to her, but she might not be in her right mind."

"Understood."

Taesan used the potion and put on the ring, taking the music box.

Belldegia looked at Taesan with a faint smile.

"Now I'll leave. Please don't die and go down to the labyrinth... and help the princess."

"No."

But Taesan denied it. Belldegia's face stiffened for a moment.

"What?"

"I didn't say I won't save the princess, I just don't plan to leave yet."

This place was very good.

The monsters in the labyrinth were no match for Taesan. The labyrinth's system was designed to increase proficiency smoothly when the opponent was at a certain level. Taesan's proficiency had increased a bit, but was now stuck.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But the 61st floor was different. The 10-level test was at a level that even Taesan couldn't easily dismiss.

In other words, it was optimized to increase proficiency.

"You can take the test multiple times. I've been doing that."

"Uh, that's true, but there are limits to that, aren't there?"

"Don't you think you can exceed those limits to some extent?"

"That's true."

Bel dentaria realized what Taesan was after and hesitated. Taesan said:

"I'll be in your debt for a while."

"……."

* * *

Taesan continued to challenge the test every day. He focused on increasing his proficiency rather than aiming to pass, so it took time, but he gained a lot.

First, he started increasing his magic proficiency. He took out all sorts of magic and passed the test.

After investing about three days, his magic proficiency reached 60%.

[Magic] [Proficiency: 60%] [You can handle magic with confidence. You can control fire, regulate cold, and manipulate wind, and you can also coordinate each of their powers to achieve the desired result.]

"I finally made it."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"It's been a while since I was stuck in the 50% range, but I've finally reached 60%. Berdengkia couldn't help but be amazed.

"'You've already reached 60% without being a mage who specializes in magic? This is impossible...'

"'I've had several chances to level up my skills.'

Return to Earth. Points that can be used there.

The first time I returned, I invested a lot of points in magic. After leveling up my skills to some extent, the efficiency dropped, and I stopped investing, but I was able to get a lot of help at first.

As soon as I reached 60%, my magic manifestation became more free. The implementation speed increased even further, and its power also increased significantly.

[You activated Frost Arrow.]

Zhzhzh!

The manifested Frost Arrow flies towards Rich. Rich, who was struggling to withstand the consecutive magic attacks, cannot block the Frost Arrow.

Zhzhzh!

[Rich takes 1332 damage.]

The damage increased by about 30% compared to before, and the speed also increased significantly. While it's a relatively small damage compared to Taesan's ability to deal tens of thousands of damage at once, the advantage of Frost Arrow lies in its low consumption and fast implementation speed."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"If I create and fire dozens of them at once, it would be difficult for the opponent to handle.

And as I reached 60%, I also acquired new magic-related skills.

[Magic Separation] [Proficiency: 1%] [Allows you to separate magic.] [Magic Concentration] [Proficiency: 1%] [Allows you to concentrate magic in a specific direction, affecting a wide area.]

In the case of Magic Separation, it was similar to what Verdandi had used. Taesan activated the Starlight Arrow and then Magic Separation.

The arrow then split into dozens of branches. While not as colorful as Verdandi's, there were enough of them.

Kugugugugu!

The separated arrows were fired simultaneously.

Rich's magical barrier was deployed, but it was instantly shattered and destroyed.

The power of magic was weakened by separation, but it allowed for a wider range of attacks, giving me an advantage in terms of spatiality.

And the effect of Magic Concentration was very simple.

[You activated the Frozen World.] [You activated Magic Concentration.]

The Frozen World was activated, and the cold energy spread forward.

Tzzzzz!"

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The wave of ice swept in, and the front was filled with cold air. Taesan confirmed the effect and drew a conclusion.

'It's okay.'

The frozen world was a magic that spread in all directions. It wasn't bad, but it was hard to see a significant effect at a ratio of 1:1.

That skill somewhat made up for that shortcoming. The cold air concentrated in front was clearly stronger than ever before.

Not only did the mastery of magic increase, but the individual magic skills also noticeably improved. Overall, there was a change of about 3 to 4%, which wasn't a small number considering how difficult it was to increase the mastery of magic-related skills.

Bel denturia gazed at that figure with a strange gaze.

'Is this something different from me?'

Would I have tried to increase my mastery by repeating this like this if it were me?

No. To him, the labyrinth was just a obstacle to be overcome. As a magician, he tried to analyze and understand it to some extent, but he had never done it to this extent.

Is it just a place to be attacked simply, or is it a matter of analyzing and grasping the whole and getting something out of it one by one?

The difference was clear even to Bel denturia's eyes.

'Then...'"

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The mountain has been exhausted. I drank the potion and fully recovered my depleted mana.

"Shall we go now?"

"Can we do more?"

"No, it's impossible."

Beldegkia shook her head firmly.

"Allowing you to take an additional test for magic proficiency is already a favor. As a magician, this is the last favor I can grant you. I cannot allow you to take any more."

"I see."

I wanted to improve my proficiency in dark magic and swordsmanship, but it seemed impossible.

I expected as much. If it were possible, I could have continued to improve my proficiency in all skills on the 61st floor.

"Let's head down slowly. But before that, I have something to take care of in the labyrinth."

"Leave? Is something going to happen?"

"Something like that."

Taesan gazed into the air.

The community was very noisy. Anticipation, anxiety, excitement, and various emotions were mixed together, and posts were going up rapidly.

A week ago, it was announced that the Colosseum would open.

And a week has passed.

"I'll take a break for a moment."

The space split open, and a passage appeared.

Taesan entered it."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a vast space. Although it was blocked by a huge wall and ceiling, it was enormously wide and high. The height was so great that an ordinary person wouldn't be able to reach the end of the ceiling.

It was a size that could fit tens of thousands of people, so it was naturally large.

Taesan looked around. Players started to appear one by one.

"Oh, oh oh..."

"This is not a maze or a place on earth, it's the first time I've seen a place like this. Where are we?"

They gathered around, muttering to each other. Some of them saw Taesan and were surprised.

"Taesan-nim!"

Taesan stopped them from bowing their heads.

At his shout, people's attention turned to Taesan.

"Oh..."

"It's Taesan-nim!"

They looked at Taesan with admiration and respect, but they didn't try to grab him or run towards him like before.

The gaze was burdensome, but it was still more comfortable than before.

[The proficiency of divine power increased by 1%.]

He moved, ignoring the increase in proficiency. Soon, he was able to find Kim Hwi-yeon's figure.

"Ah, Taesan."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"People aren't as enthusiastic as they used to be. Did you say something?"

"Yes. I told them to hold back because if they get too excited, they'll be a nuisance to Taesan. I didn't think they'd follow so well, though."

Taesan approached her, and she fought with her life on the line, and thanks to her leadership, many people survived, earning Kim Hwi-yeon great respect from many.

"Mr. Taesan, do you have any idea how things will go?"

"I don't know. Since it's the Colosseum, it'll probably be a one-on-one battle. How are the countries going to meet up?"

"France, Japan, the US, and us. Other countries are either ignoring us or meeting among themselves."

As soon as Kim Hwi-yeon finished speaking, a system window appeared.

[One hour later, the quest begins.]

"I've been thinking about this for a while, but why can't I use honorifics? It's annoying to see this every time. We used honorifics when we returned to Earth, so why is it like this?"

Kim Hwi-yeon grumbled and started gathering people. Taesan moved and found Lee Taeyeon and Kang Junhyuk.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Brother, are you here?"

"Yes."

Taesan nodded and asked, "How far have you come down?"

"We're around the 23rd floor now."

"Did you come down quickly?"

"Well, we had to work hard before the Colosseum opened, so we're a bit tired. Which floor are you on, brother?"

"61st floor."

"……."

The two men's conversation came to an abrupt halt.

"……You'll clear it soon, I suppose."

"I don't think so."

It could have taken longer to reach the 70th floor than to break through the deep layer. In fact, Taesan had done it before.

Kim Hwi-yeon, who was distributing something to people in the distance, approached them.

"Mr. Taesan, put this on your arm. And you too."

She handed him a yellow cloth.

"What's this?"

"I'm not sure what to do, so I'll divide them by difficulty level. Green is easy, blue is normal, red is hard, and yellow is alone. Actually, Mr. Taesan, you don't need this, but……."

There was no one who didn't know Taesan. He was a legend in Korea.

"Since we might meet people from other countries, we've already discussed it with the representatives of each country. Let's tie up the details by mode."

Taesan accepted the assignment.

She started distributing the assignments again. And an hour later, the system window appeared.

[Special Quest Start] [This is the Colosseum. Prove your abilities and show off your skills.] [Various quests will be conducted here.] [Points will be awarded for clearing quests, and the amount of points will vary depending on the achievement.]

Points. Everyone's eyes sparkled at the word. Points that could increase stats and proficiency were extremely valuable.
