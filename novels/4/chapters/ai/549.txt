Chapter 550

550. The Treasure Chest of the Usurper (8)

Kwaaaang!

A massive explosion occurs, and the shockwave alone has the power to turn the planet into dust.

And Taesan breaks through the force and moves forward.

He advances towards the Usurper. And the Usurper takes a step back.

[Out of reach.]

With a short phrase, the authority is activated. The distance between Taesan and the Usurper is forcibly increased. It's as if they are repelling each other like magnets, and the Usurper moves away as much as Taesan approaches.

"What kind of authority is this?"

Taesan mutters, waving his arm. Mana gathers, and thousands of ash-colored threads appear.

[You have activated the colorful, rainbow-colored [Boundary] dash.] [You have activated the certain-hit skill.]

Kukukukuku!

The ash-colored threads sweep through space, dashing towards the Usurper. They forcibly compress the expanding space to approach.

Kaang!

But the moment they reach the Usurper, they shatter like broken glass.

Taesan scowls.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"After the stem, composed of mana and ash, transformed into matter and broke apart, I saw it as a single concept. 

'I can't see the bottom.'

Corruption, exile, oppression, exclusion, monochrome, and so on.

The usurper's power, which had been pulled out, exceeded ten.

Of course, it was only a faint imitation. It was impossible to use the power and concept in a diverse and rich way to grasp its essence.

It was like a foolish and ignorant person wielding a weapon recklessly.

But the weapon was enormous and diverse.

The disadvantage of not being able to utilize it was more than compensated for. If Taesan succeeded in nullifying one power, he would immediately pull out a new one.

'How many will there be?'

Taesan quickly moved his feet. His body accelerated. He traversed the planet in an instant, exceeding the speed of light.

And the usurper grasped all of his movements.

[It cannot escape my gaze.]

It was the power of surveillance.

A vast, universal concept that observes and grasps everything by gazing at something.

The ash and concept collided. The usurper raised his fist and swung it. A massive convergence struck Taesan.

Kwaaaang!"

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan felt a sudden strong burden.

It wasn't just a physical burden. It was as if his soul itself was being directly attacked.

This was also a kind of authority. Taesan gritted his teeth and wrapped his body in a boundary. He protected not only his physical body but also his mind firmly.

"Get up."

The beast's roar echoed.

The beast of the boundary revealed its true form, taking on a distorted, unjust shape, as if to devour the usurper.

The usurper didn't back down.

Instead, it seemed to enjoy itself, charging towards the boundary with a distorted form. Numerous authorities spread out as if they had been waiting.

Kwaaaang!

The powers clashed.

Even though Taesan had pulled out the beast of the boundary, he didn't gain any significant advantage and instead created some distance.

"It's tricky."

One authority alone wasn't a significant problem. As long as it was a concept, no matter how vague, it could be countered.

However, as the authorities continued to emerge one after another, it was practically impossible to counter them.

"What should I do?"

Taesan created some distance and fell into deep thought.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And the usurper was enjoying himself as a usurper.

[You're doing well.]

Each concept he was handling was a complete concept of the universe itself.

Although he couldn't handle it in a complete way, just wielding it was enough to have an impact on the entire universe.

It was the same as handling the power of choice, the power of struggle, the power of death and victory, and the power of magic and swords.

Although he was very weak as a part of the usurper, he was confident that he wouldn't lose to anyone when it came to the treasure box.

But Taesan was holding out.

As he analyzed the powers the usurper was handling one by one, he charged towards him.

[You're strong.]

The usurper couldn't help but acknowledge it.

Taesan was extremely powerful.

Even if he included his heterogeneity, if someone who dominated a complete concept, even a transcendent being or a high god, was slightly lacking in power, he had enough power to respond.

[You're amazing.]

The usurper acknowledged Taesan.

But there was no sign of crisis on his face. Only his unwavering confidence that he would win was visible.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[If I make that mine... I can really take over the outside and become a complete self.]

The thief's face was filled with greed.

He let out a loud laugh and snapped his fingers. The dust of corruption spread in all directions.

[You will eventually be consumed.]

The boundary was not infinite power. In the process of obtaining a complete self, it was stretched to the limit, but ultimately, the user, Taesan, could not bring it out to its full potential.

[Will you be consumed first, or will this place be consumed first? That's also a kind of entertainment. Let's enjoy it once.]

Another authority appeared in the realm.

* * *

Taesan took a step back. Thousands of blades descended upon him.

Taesan gathered the boundary, compressing it. Multiple gray spheres materialized.

And then, he burst them.

The thousands of blades collided with the exploding gray dust, canceling each other out.

"This makes fourteen."

It was the number of authorities the thief had handled.

"I thought it would be much fewer."

The complete concept was around ten. Anything beyond that was just a small concept, and it wasn't a big problem, he thought.

But he had easily surpassed ten.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Despite that, the expression of the usurper was extremely carefree. It was as if he hadn't reached the bottom yet, and was just getting started, as he continued to bring out more and more powers.

'I've killed a lot.'

It meant that a transcender who dominated at least 14 complete concepts had been robbed of their powers.

'Hmm.'

Taesan lightly swung his sword.

'I need to change my plan.'

His original plan was to hold out until the usurper brought out all the concepts of the universe.

Since the usurper couldn't handle their powers properly, it was definitely possible.

However, the amount of concepts the usurper was handling was more than expected.

At that rate, it was likely that Taesan would be exhausted before he could fully counterattack.

After a brief moment of contemplation, Taesan quickly made a decision. He changed his plan and gave up on the long-term battle.

He would take his chance and end it in one go.

And Taesan had just the right card for that.

Kugugugung!

As soon as the decision was made, Taesan launched himself forward. He spread his ash-colored aura in all directions, dominating the space and charging forward.

[I will expel you.]

Zweeooo!

The power of expulsion enveloped Taesan.

But Taesan didn't back down. The boundary that had been condensed in his hand manifested as a power in the world.

Zweeooo!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The world is disconnected.

The power of the beast that walks through time is activated. The realm itself is severed, and the power of expulsion cannot reach Taesan.

Kwaaaang!

I put strength in my feet.

The usurper swings his hand.

[You cannot reach me.]

Space itself expands. The more Taesan approaches, the more space expands.

Taesan doesn't care.

He just accelerates further.

Kugugugugukung!

The expanding space starts to forcibly shrink. The power's effect cannot keep up with Taesan's speed.

Kwaaaang!

He breaks through the power with pure strength and accelerates.

Space cannot withstand the speed and shatters. The extremely compressed boundary shakes in all directions.

The usurper doesn't stay still either. He wields his power to block Taesan.

Taesan doesn't dodge or try to block.

He just breaks through with his body.

Kwadddddd!

The boundary is torn apart in an instant. But it doesn't stop. He approaches without worrying about exhaustion.

[Hmm.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The plunderer also realized it. Taesan had changed his strategy.

And that was the correct answer.

The number of powers he possessed was immeasurable. Taesan would exhaust his strength trying to figure it all out before being defeated. So, it was right to settle the battle quickly.

If it were Taesan, he could easily reach the answer.

The plunderer also knew that fact.

[Whoa.]

The plunderer spreads his arms wide. Like a demon king facing a hero, he welcomes Taesan.

Powers pour out.

The concept of the multiverse, in all its colors, envelops Taesan.

Kwaaaang!

And Taesan breaks through.

[You have activated the possibility denial.]

He denies the possibility of being attacked and charges towards the plunderer.

Kwaaaang!

But the power the plunderer wields is the concept of the universe.

It can't be fully resolved with possibility denial. The boundary denial is eventually exhausted, and Taesan is hit.

[Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.]

And the nullification is activated.

The skill he obtained when he entered alone mode was also effective against the concept of the universe.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The nullification of all attacks is consumed, and the final chance is activated.

Taesan arrived in front of the usurper.

Taesan gripped his sword with a powerful hand.

[You activated Addition.] [You activated the Sword of Tenacity.] [You activated Transformation.] [You activated Strong Strike.] [You activated Vital Point Designation.] [You activated Multiplication.]

The physical strength of the sword is overlapped.

Just that alone shakes the realm. The extremely compressed physical strength is realized in the world.

And that physical strength is covered by the boundary.

The enormous physical strength, tangled with the boundary.

If it hits directly, no one can guarantee that they can withstand it.

And the usurper, as if waiting for this moment, revealed it.

[He knew he could bring it out.]

The usurper clasps his hands together.

[Come forth, power of defense.]

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung!

A great concept arises. It is the concept of defense, which protects and guards something.

The collection of all defense concepts existing throughout the universe perfectly surrounds the usurper.

Taesan did not back down. He wielded his sword and swung it. The condensed gray physical strength and defense collide."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Ku ku ku ku ku ku!

The space is distorting.

The treasure chest of the plunderer cannot withstand the aftermath of the authority and is distorting.

Taesan is pouring more power into his sword. The authority is making a cracking sound and starting to break.

And then, a loud explosion occurred.

* * *

Kuuuuuuuuuung….

The aftermath is slowly subsiding.

And what appeared was a desolate, ruined area.

And the plunderer was standing calmly, but his face was filled with awe.

[…The authority has been shattered.]

What he had brought out to block the ash-colored physical force was the defensive authority.

It was a concept that had pulled out the very idea of defense from the universe.

It was a high-ranking concept among the great concepts, and he had used it to protect himself entirely.

But that defensive authority, a concept that penetrates the entire universe, is now shattered.

It was impossible to use or restore it to its original state.

The ash-colored physical force had utterly destroyed the concept of defense itself.

[Was it possible to get this far?]

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It wasn't just that. The simple aftermath had already broken and destroyed many small concepts.

These small concepts weren't something to be underestimated. They were not just overwhelmed by the complete concept, but had transcended to a level that was far beyond faith.

Even against the fragments of the divine or the shards of the sacred, one could have achieved a sufficient victory.

But that small concept, with just a simple aftermath, had been destroyed in an instant. The usurper let out a hollow laugh. The physical power of the boundary was something beyond his imagination.

However, in the end, he did not fall.

By consuming the power of defense, he succeeded in protecting himself.

And Taesan became empty-handed.

[Your endurance has been activated.] [You have ultimately been defeated.]

The usurper declared with confidence.

Taesan did not deny it.

The usurper's words were not wrong.

He had just used all his strength to destroy one of his powers completely.

But that was all. The usurper still had many powers left.

It was impossible to break through that.

At least, for the current Taesan.

"I'll know soon enough."

The usurper's power.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's about the fundamental usage and intervention. As a result, Taesan learned about a new concept.

Taesan took a step forward. The usurper didn't stop him. It was as if he was saying, "Try it if you can," and watched with a cold gaze.

Taesan reached out to grasp the scattered powers.

[What did I do wrong?]

The usurper sneered.

[Are you trying to take control? I was clearly unable to handle the things that exist here.]

The usurper was shocked.

And the concept of the universe that exists here.

The usurper was unable to do anything beyond imitation.

[But even so, these are mine.]

Even if I couldn't control or dominate, the ownership belonged to the usurper.

[You've lost the power that originated from me, and you can't usurp it. You've become isolated on your own.]

"What will happen?"

The usurper's words were correct. The spiritual ascension had disappeared. Even if spiritual ascension existed, it would only be activated by defeating the opponent, and it had no meaning in the current state.

However, spiritual ascension had transformed into spiritual usurpation.

And spiritual usurpation was an active power, unlike spiritual ascension."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Rakirates was activated unconsciously. He himself didn't know how to control it.

But it's not like that now.

Now, he can control it with his own pure will.

Taesan infused power into the hand that held the authority.

The power that he had been using without understanding, but now his pure authority is activated. The usurper freezes for a moment. He senses something is off and tries to move.

But it's already too late.

The authority is activated.

[You have activated the Domain Invasion.]

The universe's concept begins to fall under Taesan's control."

Note: "Rakirates" and "Domain Invasion" seem to be specific terms or concepts in the original text, so I've left them untranslated. If you have more context or information about what these terms mean, I may be able to provide a more accurate translation.
