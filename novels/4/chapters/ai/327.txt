**Chapter 328**

**328. 71st Floor, The Shadow That Devours Everything (4)**

[You have activated the Frozen World.]

A fierce storm is approaching. The energy contained within is unlike anything seen before.

**Whoosh!**

A massive ice wall rises in front of us. The ice pillars are like a speeding train, freezing the shadow in an instant.

"Phew."

Taesan let out a sigh of relief. The cold air froze, and his breath fell to the ground.

Even without using forced amplification, the power was similar to before.

The dark magic was also not much different.

[You have activated Marbas's Black Wave.]

A black wave crashes down. The power contained within is stronger and more intense than before.

**Boom!**

The shadow's entire body trembles violently as it collides with the wave.

The increase in proficiency was significant, and the corresponding change was evident.

This was one of the main skills he had been handling, and its value had increased even more.

Taesan was not yet satisfied. He had finally found an opponent that could easily raise his proficiency. He wanted to max out all his skills to 100%.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But it was slowly reaching its limit.

The Shadow Ogre had become infinitely bloated and couldn't even stand upright properly.

"If I touch it any more, it won't be good."

Taesan continued to attack the Shadow Ogre with magic and dark magic. Minerva and Barcaza also assisted Taesan.

The Shadow Ogre continued to absorb power until it exceeded its limit.

If left alone, it would self-destruct. So, it was time to put an end to it slowly.

"It's regrettable, but there's no other way."

Taesan's sword was coated with black, and on top of that, a golden light was manifested.

The golden and black colors mixed together, creating a grayish power.

Taesan suppressed the power within his sword and took a step forward. He charged towards the bloated Shadow Ogre, which seemed like it would burst at any moment, and swung his sword.

Ku-u-ung!

The grayish power exploded, engulfing the Shadow Ogre. Despite exceeding its limit, the Shadow Ogre instinctively tried to absorb the grayish power.

Kwaduk.

But it was impossible.

The Shadow Ogre couldn't absorb the grayish power. It was as if it was a forbidden, entirely different concept of power to it."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The shadow gazed at the small being that had pierced itself with a sword.

It had consumed immense power and surpassed its own limits, but at the same time, it was in a state of infinite anxiety. It was a realm that it had never reached before.

That's why it knew.

The small being in front of it was similar to its own existence.

Like the being that had summoned it to this world, it was an existence that it couldn't consume.

No. To be precise, it was slightly different.

That being was even more heterogeneous.

It was thicker, and something was different.

The fact that it couldn't be consumed was the same, but it was fundamentally twisted.

The shadow's consciousness realized late. The power possessed by this small being was something that it couldn't reach no matter how much it consumed and grew its power.

With that thought, the shadow's entire body was shrouded in a gray light.

The power that defied the laws of nature engulfed it.

Kwaaaang!

[You have defeated the Shadow Fiend.]

Taesan sheathed his sword.

Now, he could use the boundary line to a certain extent without risk. It was still dangerous and unsettling, but it was no longer at the level where Taesan had to stake his life like the first time.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The power that the Shadow Ogre had possessed was absorbed by Taesan.

Taesan's eyebrows twitched as he quietly watched the power move.

The Shadow Ogre was a monster that devoured and plundered power. In a sense, it was similar to a spiritual ascension.

So, the spiritual ascension was triggered in a slightly unusual way.

[Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [Your spiritual ascension has been triggered. Your health has permanently increased by 6211.] [Your spiritual ascension has been triggered. The proficiency of the Seed of Life has increased by 22%.] [Your spiritual ascension has been triggered. You have obtained the source of predation.]

At the same time, Taesan could feel that something had changed.

A change had occurred in a more fundamental part of him.

Taesan opened his skill window.

[Special Passive Skill: Seed of Life] [Proficiency: 26%] [It absorbs life and partially plunders the power that exists within it. It can make extremely fine adjustments to spiritual ascension.]

"......Spiritual ascension adjustment?"

No matter how many times he looked, he was certain.

A sentence had appeared in the Seed of Life, saying that it adjusted spiritual ascension.

* * *
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's tuning."

Taesan, who had sent Minerva and Barcazar away, quietly read the explanation of the seed of life.

The skill of "Eclipse Ascension" was the most important skill Taesan possessed.

It was a power that allowed him to steal his opponent's stats and acquire numerous skills, granting him divinity and blackness.

However, it was also a power that Taesan couldn't control.

Despite having acquired many powers and skills while descending into the labyrinth, the Eclipse Ascension still activated on its own, as if it was still lacking in qualifications.

"You can tune that?" The ghost asked in wonder.

[Can you tune that? Is that even possible?]

To the ghost, the Eclipse Ascension seemed like a power that was not permitted to mortals. Taesan had somehow acquired it, but it looked like a skill that couldn't be touched until a certain level of skill was reached.

Taesan, who had gazed at his skill window for a moment, stood up.

He began to search for the shadow around him. Before long, he discovered a shadow that was writhing and crawling in the darkness.

Kwajik.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan thrust his sword into the shadow's body. The shadow was shocked and tried to swallow Taesan whole.

Taesan lightly shook off the shadow and trampled on it.

[You have defeated the starving shadow.]

As soon as he won, power began to flow out of the shadow. It was the activation of the Shadow Elevation.

At the same time, Taesan realized that he could interfere with that power to some extent.

Taesan interfered with the Shadow Elevation he had activated. The incoming power took shape and settled into Taesan.

[Your Shadow Elevation has been activated. Your permanent health has increased by 92.]

His stats have risen.

Until now, the effect of the Shadow Elevation, which he had activated by defeating shadows, was only to increase the proficiency of the Seed of Life.

But now, Taesan had obtained stats by adjusting the Shadow Elevation.

[……I can really do it. What is this.]

The ghost murmured in a tone of admiration. Taesan took a step forward to confirm, and found and defeated many shadows around him one by one.

As a result, he was able to understand the changed Shadow Elevation to some extent.

"I can adjust the stats I obtain a little now."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When I defeat an enemy, the 'Yong-geok' ability is triggered, allowing me to take their stats and skills.

Among them, I can interfere with their stats.

If I focus on agility, I can gain more agility, if I focus on strength, I can gain more strength, and if I focus on vitality, I can gain more vitality.

"It's not that significant, I suppose."

The amount of stats I can gain is extremely small.

Since it's good to balance my stats, there's no reason to obsess over increasing a specific stat.

But when I reached 20%, I was able to adjust my stats.

Then, what would be possible at 40%, 60%?

I could steal the skills I want and trigger the 'Yong-geok' ability at will.

"What kind of skill is this, anyway?"

He had it, but even he couldn't understand the skill.

Taesan continued to find and defeat shadows to gain a more accurate understanding, but it seemed to have reached its limit, and the 'Yong-geok' ability no longer triggered.

There was no more business to attend to here.

Taesan searched for an exit while checking out other skills as well."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Intermediate Magic: Frozen World] [Mana Consumption: 300] [Proficiency: 22%] [Unleashes a chilling energy that freezes everything, allowing for a proper display of its power.]

My proficiency in intermediate magic and some dark magic has reached 20%.

As a result, my damage output and power have increased significantly.

The skills that reached 20% proficiency were Frozen World, Starlight Arrow, Decarabia's Distorted Vegetation, and Marbas's Dark Wave. There were four of them.

It was a satisfying achievement, and I also acquired a new skill.

[Special Passive Skill: Continuous Magic] [Proficiency: 1%] [When casting magic or dark magic in succession, its power and implementation speed increase gradually. If you perform another action in between, it will be canceled.]

It was a simple yet excellent skill. With my current high mana and magic, I could now launch a barrage of attacks using magic and dark magic. It was a skill that amplified my power.

"It's definitely gotten faster."

At this rate, the proficiency growth rate of other skills would also increase noticeably. Even the stagnant Ayrac martial arts and Ability Sword could start to accelerate.

"And what's this?"

There was a flickering shadow on Taesan's hand.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was an energy within him that devoured everything and made it his own.

[The Origin of Devouring] [The source of those born to devour everything.]

It was the first time that the rising of his spirit had brought him materials.

Taesan had grasped the origin of devouring. If he showed it to Half-ran, he would probably understand.

He was a unique opponent in many ways.

Taesan used his domain detection to find his location and moved forward. Because he had defeated the Shadow Aegis, the shadows didn't approach him and instead fled, so there was no interference.

In the end, Taesan arrived at the passageway leading to the 72nd floor.

"There's no secret room."

To find the exit, he activated his domain detection and searched a wide area. He had grasped most of the 71st floor, but he didn't see anything. It seemed like it didn't exist.

Taesan's prediction had hit the mark, and he even obtained the clear reward.

Just as he was about to check the clear reward, the wall crumbled, and Balbam appeared.

[...He's doing all sorts of things.]

He gazed at Taesan with a sidelong glance and muttered to himself."

Note: "Balbam" is likely a name or a title, but it's not a commonly used term in English, so I left it as is. If you have more context or information about what "Balbam" refers to, I can try to provide a more accurate translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What you've destroyed is the master of this place. It's an existence that controls the number of shadows and their strength. Now that the master is gone, this place will crumble. Thanks to that, I'll have to clear the 71st floor again."

"Good luck."

"A magician like you would be nice, but... it's very troublesome. I'll have to search hard to find something useful."

Balbambara let out a deep sigh and turned back into a brick wall. Taesan checked the rewards again.

[Mythical Ankle Protector] [+400 Strength] [+400 Agility] [+400 Intelligence] [+400 Defense] [+7% Action Speed] [A mythical ankle protector used by the hero. It's unclear if it's real, but it contains considerable power.] [Ring made from metal struck by lightning] [+300 Defense] [+50% Electric Resistance] [A ring made from metal that has been struck by lightning since the dawn of time. It boasts absolute defense against electricity.]

The reward's stats were more than double what he had obtained so far, and it even had a special effect like resistance.

"Is this electric-specialized equipment?"

While it might not be useful in general, it seemed like it could be useful in certain situations.

Taesan, who had organized his rewards, stepped into the 72nd floor.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He takes a step into the deeper depths.

[72nd Floor Quest Begins.] [Pass the God's Trial.] [Reward: A belt made by the owner of the brutal space.] [Secret Reward:???]

As soon as he entered the 72nd floor, the space split apart, and the demon lord appeared.

[The next battle will be on the 73rd floor. It's going to be intense.]

"I understand."

Taesan nodded his head. The demon lord who had informed him of the schedule smiled faintly and disappeared.

73rd floor. It was faster than expected. He just had to go down one more floor to fight the guide again.

Passing by the shop owner, he arrived at the 72nd floor, where he found the God's Altar.

The gloomy atmosphere hinted at what kind of domain the owner of the altar possessed.

[You have discovered the Leagueit's Altar.] [First Discovery Bonus] [Your strength has permanently increased by 200, intelligence by 100, and mana by 200.]

He obtained a small but pleasant first discovery bonus.

The ghost murmured quietly.

[Leagueit. The God of Regret.]

The God of Regret.

Taesan gazed at the altar."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The altar with a metaphysical appearance seemed to have a shape that denied and excluded everything it touched.

[Ugh... Is this a god?]

"Is this a god you know?"

[I've never met anyone in the labyrinth. In the labyrinth, it's like... ]

His voice was filled with deep resentment towards the god of regret. It was the first time a ghost had shown a rejection response towards a specific god.

[It's a personal reason, so don't mind. It's not a good god, but it's not that bad either.]

"Is it true that clearing the 72nd floor only requires passing the god's trial?"

[From here on, there are floors like that. But they require even more severe trials. There are more trials that get closer to the essence of the god.]

Taesan gazed at the altar for a moment, then raised his hand. There was no option to ignore the clear conditions and pass.

[Sub-quest starts] [Leugrit wants to test you, who have come to his altar. If you accept, the trial will come to you. If you win, you will be rewarded.] [Reward: Leugrit will decide based on your achievements.]

"I accept."

Taesan said.

Power began to take shape, and the owner of the altar started to reveal their presence.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Legrit offers you a reinforced trial.]

Taesan nodded his head. He had expected it, so it wasn't a big deal.

The world begins to change with a quiet laugh.

In the distorted space, Taesan thought.

"The God of Regret."

The gods each presented a trial fitting for their domain.

If the God of Despair had implemented a destroyed Earth, the God of Regret might do something similar.

What was his regret? Simply thinking about it, it was probably because he had chosen the easy mode at the first selection. Or maybe it was one of the many events that had occurred on Earth, or when he went down to the labyrinth.

Taesan prepared for various possibilities and focused his energy throughout his body.

The distorted space began to set its target.

[Legrit's authority is revealed. Legrit's interference domain decreases.] [Legrit designates the target of his authority.]

Power flows out from the altar. Taesan waited quietly. The power slowly began to approach.

[…Huh?]

But the power wasn't heading towards Taesan.

Legrit's power was heading towards the ghost.

[Wait a minute.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The ghost was shocked by the power that enveloped itself. And as if it didn't know what to do with its confusion, the released power exploded, distorting space and time.

[Quest Condition: Defeat the Demon King and save the world that is being destroyed in your memories.] [Quest Reward: The reward will change depending on the emotions of the owner of the world that is being destroyed.]

The world is changing.

Taesan was summoned to a small room.

He looked around the room. The room, decorated with all sorts of jewels and ornaments, was so lavish that even a royal family would find it impossible to match.

"What is this?"

Taesan turned his head to look at the ghost. The power of the League was targeting the ghost. In other words, this place was likely a location within the ghost's memories.

And Taesan's gaze stopped.

There was a man there.

With platinum-colored straight hair and a classical, handsome face with neither too thin nor too thick features.

And he wore high-quality clothing that proved his status.

Taesan had seen that face before. It was the face of the ghost that appeared during the Sword Trials.

But it was more refined than that.

It was like the ghost's appearance before entering the labyrinth.

"Who are you?"

"......Who are you?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Prince of the Ruined World. Bardley gazed at the towering mountain with a youthful face that belied his worn-out boundaries."

Or, in a more poetic tone:

"The Crown Prince of a World in Ruin. Bardley's countenance, still youthful and untainted, gazed up at the majestic mountain, a stark contrast to the worn and weary borders that had been etched upon his soul."
