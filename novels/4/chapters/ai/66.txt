67. 11th Floor (1)

The ghost trembled violently.

Even after completing the quest, he did not disappear.

First, he suppressed his emotions and checked the rewards. He began with the rewards obtained from clearing the 10th floor.

[Ogre Ring] [Strength +15] [An ogre's ring. It resembles a bracelet to humans.]

He recalled a similar item from a game on Earth. True to its origin from an ogre, it boasted a high strength stat.

And the numerous titles acquired by perfectly clearing the 10th floor.

[Title: Adapted One] [You have proven your adaptation by perfectly clearing a certain number of floors in the labyrinth.] [Strength +8] [Intelligence +8] [Agility +8]

Up until now, the stat bonuses attached to titles were low or nonexistent, but these were notably high.

And it wasn't just the Adapted One title that had such attributes.
[Title: Perfectionist] [You have pierced through all the intricacies of the labyrinth.] [Strength + 10] [Intelligence + 10] [Agility + 10] [Rewards are enhanced when clearing specific floors.] [Title: Wanderer] [You have walked enough paths to prove yourself.] [Strength + 6] [Intelligence + 6] [Agility + 6] [Movement speed + 2%] [Title: Successful Prover] [You have proven significant worth.] [NPCs, gods hold favor towards you.] [Strength + 6] [Intelligence + 6] [Agility + 6] [Title: Adaptable Challenger] [Your journey is not yet over.] [Strength + 4] [Intelligence + 4] [Agility + 4] [Accelerated mastery of all skills.]

Five titles. All possessed high stat values.

Other players are guaranteed to obtain three titles upon clearing the 10th floor.

Even to Taesan, these were significant numbers, needless to say for an ordinary player.

Therefore, upon clearing themes like the 10th floor, one noticeably becomes stronger than before.

And by defeating the Ogre Sage, I obtained the crimson dagger he wielded.

[Crest of Calamity] [A dagger forged from stealing destruction. Though now aged to the point of insignificance, the aura of annihilation within it has yet to dissipate.] [Fixed Attack Power + 10]

"Huh."

I never expected to come across equipment with fixed attack power.

"As far as I remember, I was told I needed to reach at least the 20th floor to obtain this."

A weapon that inflicts only 10 damage, unaffected by all sorts of skills and equipment effects.

At first glance, it may seem meaningless, but the value contained within it was tremendous.
Here is the English translation of the text:

Fixed attacks, like those suffered by ghosts, can completely ignore defense.

Additionally, they unconditionally deal damage regardless of the situation and conditions.

Even if the opponent is immune to physical attacks, they will still receive 10 damage without fail.

Moreover, they penetrate through skills.

They possess a high probability of breaking through even the representative damage reduction skill, Fortitude.

It was similar to the effect of Taesan's Essence Strike used against the final apostle, attached to the weapon.

In both Easy and Normal modes, it was equipment that couldn't be found at all.

"To me, it wasn't particularly meaningful."

While the judgment of fixed attacks was undoubtedly high, it couldn't penetrate through nullification and resilience.

Since Taesan also possessed Essence Strikes, he didn't feel particularly attracted to it.

However, as he didn't yet possess Essence Strikes, there would come a time when he would use it. He placed the dagger in his inventory.

"You used ???." "You obtained the Spear of Restraint."

Although Taesan checked the item with an excited expression just from its name, his enthusiasm quickly cooled.
[Restraint Spear] [Named artifact crafted at the lofty tower.] [Can restrain a target for 1 second. Resistance check is attempted based on the target's level.]

"It's not bad... but..."

It wasn't great either.

If an ordinary player had obtained it, they wouldn't be able to hide their joy.

For those who have no means to stop their enemies, it could buy time and create openings, an item used in critical moments like that.

But for Taesan, it didn't hold much meaning. He already possessed numerous restraining magic spells. There was no reason for him to go through the inconvenient process of taking out and putting away the spear.

If it's a tower of magic, it must refer to a magical tower. In that case, it could have had considerable value as an offering.

Thinking of giving it to Relis, Taesan put it in his inventory and opened his stat window.

[Gang Taesan] [Level: 24] [Shield: 65/65] [Health: 990/990] [Mana: 240/240] [Strength: 406] [Intelligence: 227] [Agility: 332] [Attack Power +30] [Defense +40] [In optimal condition.]

It had been a while since he last checked his stat window.

They were still overwhelmingly high stats. However, compared to those, his attack power and defense were relatively modest.
Now it was time to gradually fill in the gaps.

Taesan spoke up.

"Is everything settled?"

[...More or less.]

The ghost replied in a voice that, though calmer than before, still carried swirling emotions.

[Hah, should I be thankful or spit out hatred for this?]

The ghost let out a bitter laugh.

[Did you accept the quest?]

Taesan nodded.

The reason the ghost disappeared on the 10th floor was because the quest's objective ended there.

But a new quest had been updated. It was a quest to kill all of his revenge targets.

"This will continue a bit longer."

[Well... not bad. I also wanted to see how far you'd go. Watching those bastards' heads roll is quite satisfying.]

The ghost explained in an annoyed tone.

[They're not that great. They rampage around, thinking they're great and causing chaos without understanding a thing.]

Guides on the path of sin.

If what Lee Tae-yeon said was true, then it made sense they would kill the ghost. They were adventurers who wanted to kill anyone not affiliated with them.

[I'll explain later. First things first, let's take care of what needs to be done.]
Light radiates from the ghost's pale hand. Above it, an object begins to take shape.

"What should I give you?"

The hero's reward was simple. He decided based on his mood. That was all there was to it. The reward could be a pebble or even a magnificent artifact.

With a feeling akin to spinning a roulette wheel, a gleaming white sword appeared.

Simple yet sleek, the sword exuded an indiscernible scent of blood. At first glance, it looked valuable.

"Take it. It's a sword I brought from my world." [Artifact of Cabert: Sword imbued with ancestors' blood] [An artifact from a world now lost to oblivion. Claimed countless noble lives.] [Attack Power +20] [When facing enemies of noble lineage, Attack Power +10]

Taesan hesitated.

Seeing Taesan silently staring at the weapon, the ghost became puzzled.

"Why? Don't you like it?"

"It's quite the opposite."

"It's too good."

He didn't think the attack power would be low, but he couldn't imagine it would reach a figure of 20. Realizing why Taesan hesitated, the ghost smirked.
[It was a revered sword with a deep legacy in my empire. Even our ancestors lost their lives to this sword. The labyrinth holds many exceptional items, but this one is reasonably good too.]

Reasonably good? No, it was beyond good. I never expected such a fine weapon. Honestly, the quest was straightforward. Just take the ghost and descend through the floors as usual to defeat the boss. That was all there was to it. The results were more than satisfying.

[If you continue to kill them... I'll give you even more valuable things. Anyway, you'll end up fighting the moment you meet.]

Listening to the melancholic voice, Taesan changed his weapon. He stored the sword of Lakyritas in his inventory and took Cabert's artifact.

Now the attack power was 45. It suddenly increased by 50%.

Satisfied, Taesan went to find Lillies. She greeted him enthusiastically but hesitated upon seeing the ghost.

"Oh?"

[So it turned out like that.]

"Ah. Yes..."

Taesan handed the spear of constraint to the bewildered Lillies.

"With this, can I learn invisibility magic?"

"Wow."

Lillies quickly forgot about the ghost, her eyes sparkling as she eagerly grasped the spear of constraint.

"This artifact is beyond anything you'd see in my world... It should be enough."
"Alright, I'll do it."

Lillies muttered as she took the spear.

Soon, a massive presence appeared.

Taesan silently observed the rippling power from the other side.

'As expected, it's different.'

The purple rift seen on Earth.

The presence and conduit of power before me now are the same.

But everything from the way I feel the power to the discomfort is different.

While Taesan confirmed, Lillies wiped away the dripping sweat from the offering.

"Phew! It was close, but somehow it worked."

[You obtained Invisibility.] [Basic Magic: Invisibility] [Mana Cost: 20] [Proficiency: 1%] [Conceals the body. Can hide from more with proficiency.]

Mana consumption was the largest of the skills he had acquired so far, but it was worth it.

"Does this mean you've learned all the magic you have now?"

Lillies muttered with an expectant face. Now, according to the offering Taesan gave, she too could learn a new magic
Taesan also had no intention of settling for this level of magic, so she would end up acquiring the magic she desired. Taesan spoke up.

"Do you know a means to communicate with the gods?"

The difference between the beings on Earth and these. Certainly, the only way to know for sure is to ask directly.

"Uh, communicate?"

Perhaps it was an abrupt question, as Lillies' pupils widened.

"Um... at least as far as I know, no? Why do you ask?"

[It exists.]

Interpreting Taesan's underlying meaning, the ghost spoke calmly.

[Quite deep, near what's commonly called the depths, but there is a pathway there. Normally, just attempting conversation would drive one mad, so you'd need to screen them, but you shouldn't have any issues.]

"Heh."

As if acknowledging the new fact, Lillies nodded her head.

Taesan bid her farewell and headed for the 11th floor.

The labyrinth changes themes every 10 floors. While the previous floors had moss-covered green rooms overall, the 11th floor consisted of crimson rooms.

Blood and iron mixed, adorned the walls, emitting an unpleasant smell.
[This is beyond the entrance of the labyrinth.] [Things that won't die even if stabbed with a knife survive here. There aren't many beings alive in this place. The darkness here is growing stronger.]

The description had changed.

From the 11th to the 20th floor.

The monsters emerging from here are not alive; they are dead.

[Quest starting from 11th floor.] [Defeat the boss of the 11th floor and proceed.] [Reward: Lion's Ring.] [Secret Reward: ???]

The quest was the same as before. Taesan calmly passed through the room. The dwarf was waiting for him as usual.

"Did you come? I thought it would take months, but you're here sooner than I expected."

"It didn't take as long as you might have thought."

11th floor.

From here on, the items sold in the shop undergo significant changes. It was a time when Taesan could acquire items that Itaeyeon had boasted to him about in the past.

Taesan looked at the dwarf with an expectant face.
