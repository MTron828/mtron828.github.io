Chapter 123

123. Deciding on the King (4)

"You lost."

Tai Shan pulled out the sword embedded in the chest of Xizhang Mountain and said calmly.

"What are you going to do? Are you going to keep going? If so, I won't stop you."

Xizhang Mountain's cold gaze pierced Tai Shan.

Xizhang Mountain shook his head.

"...I don't think so. I lost."

He retreated cleanly.

"I'm retreating."

What kind of strength is this, unable to even lift a finger despite being surrounded by hundreds of people, and defeated in reality.

Their defeat was a fact. There was nothing more to say.

"It's a good choice."

Tai Shan smiled. Xizhang Mountain's back trembled at his smile.

He swallowed his saliva and said:

"...But I'm not willing to give up my life for power."

If he had resisted even a little or denied reality and shouted loudly, he would have died. Xizhang Mountain instinctively sensed this.

"Then it's Kim Huiyuan."

"Yes? Ah, yes."

Kim Huiyuan, who had been watching blankly, suddenly snapped back to reality and approached.
Here is the translation of the text:

"'I said so. I don't think I'll become a king.' And I said I could handle it."

"...Okay."

Kim Hwi-yeon nodded her head with a firm face, looking down at Seo Jang-san with a complicated expression.

"...Seo Jang-san..."

"Will the next king be you?"

Seo Jang-san laughed bitterly.

"I don't think I'm wrong. I couldn't even use my hands against him, but... ultimately, it's the hard mode players who can counter the monsters. Weaker ones have to be sacrificed and survive."

The earth is hell.

In hell, only the strong survive.

Seo Jang-san was trying to do it with his own hands.

"Are you thinking of taking care of them all? What will be the outcome of that conclusion?"

"Just give it up."

Tae-san hit Seo Jang-san's head with his fist. Seo Jang-san wrapped his head with his hands, feeling a dull pain.

"...Okay."

[Seo Jang-san handed over the throne to Kim Hwi-yeon.] [The king has been decided.] [The one who was most involved in the change of kings is Tae-san. If you return to the labyrinth, there will be a bonus.]

* * *

"Thank you."
Here is the translation of the text:

As the hard mode players who fell were cleaned up and people accepted the king's change, Kim Hwi-yeon came to find Taesan and bowed her head.

"What's going on?"

"...I didn't kill Seojangsan."

She knows. That Taesan had no feelings towards Seojangsan whatsoever.

And that he wasn't the kind of person who would spare someone who opposed him just out of mercy.

If she had requested a change and then been killed immediately, it would have certainly led to chaos. Hard mode players who didn't understand the process might have rebelled.

And that evil would have been directed towards Kim Hwi-yeon. Since Taesan killed Seojangsan and she became the king, she had benefited the most from it.

Taesan's relationship with her would have been suspected, and she would have been hit by the backlash. Even if she managed to survive and return to the labyrinth, she would have been excluded from the possibility of being spared.

Kim Hwi-yeon finally realized that Taesan had been thinking about everything from the beginning.

"Okay, then work hard. That's what you can do to repay me."

"...?"

Kim Hwi-yeon sent a strange gaze towards Taesan.

It was a gaze that asked why he was treating her so well.

Taesan smiled slightly.

"It's a debt."

"...Debt?"

(Note: The translation is based on my understanding of the context, and some phrases might be open to interpretation. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification, please let me know!)
Here is the translation of the text:

"Okay."

The Great Mountain smiled faintly.

The previous life.

His third return, when he was weak and fragile.

Due to Choi Jung-hyeok's rebellion, most of the Western and Hard Mode players disappeared. Only 10,000 people survived.

The next time he returned to Seoul, the road was hell. Monsters appeared that they couldn't resist, and humans died like toys.

At that place, Kim Hwi-yeon saved half of her life.

Among them, the Great Mountain was also there.

"People are dying, so it's not nice to watch."

Kim Hwi-yeon's words to the Great Mountain's question on the night she was about to die, "If I run away alone, I can definitely survive."

When order disappeared and the law was nothing, she naturally kept her mouth shut.

The Great Mountain still remembered.

"Really... really grateful. You're doing all this for someone like me... ."

When she looked at the Great Mountain, he was perfect alone. He could do anything.

He easily solved her worries and saved countless people. It was beyond her abilities.
Here is the translation of the text:

Kim Hwi-yeon had admiration for him.

But that person was so concerned about his own weakness that it was hard to believe.

It was difficult to express his gratitude in words.

The gods of the heavens shook their hands.

"It's settled. It's not just because of that."

Seo-jang-san was different from Choi Jung-hyeok. Choi Jung-hyeok would parasitize on others and eat away at them, but would not be of any help. Seo-jang-san, on the other hand, made an effort to save humanity, even if it meant being the center of attention.

When multiple waves appeared during the second return, Seo-jang-san led the way and defeated the monsters.

"'Although he has a problem with his personality, he will listen if you scold him.'"

If he was saved, he could be used effectively. If he didn't listen even after being scolded, Seo-jang-san thought about scolding him until he listened.

"And there's another problem, isn't there?"

"...It's a food problem."

How can you feed and sustain tens of thousands of people?

This problem still remained.

* * *

The king changed from Seo-jang-san to Kim Hwi-yeon.

This fact was announced to everyone through the system. Even if it wasn't announced, those who had seen it directly would make it known soon.
Here is the translation of the text:

The response was contradictory.

"So, is it okay now?"

"Can you live?"

Both the easy mode and normal mode players were delighted. Hard mode players, on the other hand, oppressed them and would lose their lives if they resisted carelessly, so they had to endure the pain and survive.

However, if a new king took notice of them, it would be a good thing for them.

In contrast, the hard mode players were not in a good mood.

"We're fighting with our lives... ...."

"Is it not fair to receive benefits for that?"

Under the leadership of Seojangsan, they acted without hesitation. Since the benefits were suddenly taken away, it was hard to be pleased.

Kim Hui-yeon also knew this fact.

"I won't deny the benefits. Everyone should receive benefits that match their abilities."

It was also true that they protected the majority of players. They had the right to a corresponding responsibility.

She pushed Seojangsan away because he abandoned easy and normal modes. She intended to leave the benefits that excluded him.
Here is the translation of the text:

When the players who played on hard mode heard these words, they didn't show much resistance. This was partly because Kim Hwi-yeon was highly respected in hard mode, and most of them didn't particularly like being bullied either. Additionally, many people in hard mode had friendships with those in normal mode.

Initially, it was a choice that was almost forced, like entering a labyrinth. It was common for players who were children of hard mode players and parents of easy mode players.

No one wanted to see their friend, a hard mode player, being taken advantage of. As long as there were no benefits, there was no reason for them to refuse. Under such thoughts, they accepted Kim Hwi-yeon's intention.

"So, what are you going to do then?" asked Geum Jung-geun. Kim Hwi-yeon closed her eyes.

Ten million lives were in her hands.

It was too heavy.

"But..."

She opened her eyes.

She had accepted it. There was no reason to complain.

"How much food do we have?"

"Not much. Even if it's only for hard mode players, it's not enough. If all ten million people eat, it won't last a day. Since each person brought their own food, we can last for a few days... but the quest period is longer than that."
Here is the translation of the text:

Zhang Jun said, "It's been a whole month. With the food we have, we can't make it no matter what we do."

Of course, there was a basic magic spell for producing food, which consumed mana to create food. This was a very good magic in such a situation, but the problem was the number of people.

Even if he used up all his mana, it wouldn't be enough for 10,000 people to eat.

At this critical moment, there was no reason to use it anyway.

Kim Huiyan closed her eyes and thought for a moment, then said:

"Is there a place nearby where we can get food?"

Kim Huiyan's words made Seo Jang-san glance at Tai Shan's face. Tai Shan's expression turned solemn, and he said cautiously:

"There is a large supermarket nearby. However, the nearby food is all gone, and there's nothing we can salvage."

"We have to go far away."

He made a decision.

"Let's move."

"Go all the way?"

"Yes. We have to get food, there's no choice."

Most of them agreed with his words, but the problem was what came next.

"Why do we have to go?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Some parts of the hard mode refused to comply. Their reasoning was simple: if it's a dangerous thing, why can't we just do it in easy mode? Why should we risk our lives?

"What are we going to do if easy mode doesn't get the job done?"

As expected, Kim Hwi-yeon spoke calmly.

"We all got a lot of points after the first return and went back to the maze, didn't we? Everyone knows how that works."

The point system, which was differentially awarded, had a huge effect. Gold, stats, and skill levels could be increased without risk, and as a result, there was a significant difference between those who got a lot of points and those who didn't.

"This time, the rewards will also be differentially awarded based on performance. So, the more actively you participate in obtaining food, the more you'll get."

The others fell silent, convinced that they could get points and thus the value of taking risks was justified.

"And we're not just joking around about hard and normal modes. We need to bring back as much food as possible, so we'll move as a team to a certain extent."

"Are we supposed to protect them?"

"I won't say we're going to risk our lives. But please do your best to protect them. That's a request."

Kim Hwi-yeon bowed her head. The hard mode players looked hesitant.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, I understand."

"I feel like I'm a bad guy now."

At that time, Seo Jang-san said, "It's still not enough."

"What do you mean?"

"One hundred thousand, no matter how widespread it is, there is a limit. Even if we find food for a week, how do we do it for the next week? How do we survive for a month?"

"Jang-san."

Tae-san said, "You're not allowed to say anything more than that, so shut up."

"... "

"But your question is justified."

"Well, shut up because it's noisy."

"... "

Seo Jang-san closed his mouth with an unhappy face.

Tae-san had a bad feeling towards him. He had been tormenting him with Normal mode and not providing him with food properly. The main logic was that Hard mode should be prepared to fill the stomach and prepare for the future.

Tae-san was also a player in Normal mode, so he did not receive food. He still remembered the painful memory of eating tree roots with an empty stomach.

From his perspective, not killing him was a great mercy.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You don't have to worry, I'll take care of what you said. And if I can find potato or corn seeds, I'll bring them back."

"Really? That might be difficult, right?"

If we can cultivate corn and potatoes, it would be a great help, but it's too short of time. We can't leave before they grow, and when we come back, they might have rotted.

Tai-san shook his head.

"That's not the reason. If there's something we can cultivate, bring it back."

"Hmm... Okay."

Hwi-yeon had a puzzled expression, but nodded her head.

Just then, Jung-geun, who had been quiet, spoke up.

"Is it okay if it's a cultivable food?"

"I think so."

Tai-san didn't know the details. At that time, they had only gotten potatoes. But if potatoes were possible, other things could be too.

"So, I know a place nearby."

"Then let's move together."

After that, Hwi-yeon started forming a team, and Tai-san moved with Jung-geun.

"Where are we going?"

"We can go that way. It's not far."

Tai-san followed Jung-geun. Monsters occasionally popped out, but Tai-san and Jung-geun were not afraid.

"Here we are."
Here is the translation of the text:

When Middle Earth arrived, it was just a small building next to him.

"It's not broken, is it?"

Middle Earth went inside. He passed through a room without any living necessities and arrived at a door leading to the basement.

Middle Earth entered smoothly by inputting a familiar password.

"Ah?"

Tae-san's eyes lit up. The underground space was filled with numerous plants. Although they were all rotten now since they no longer received human care, they had been quite beautiful when they were alive.

"Just wait for a moment."

Middle Earth entered the room with plants. After a while, he brought out a few packages of seeds wrapped in vacuum packaging.

"They seem to be well-preserved, so they haven't rotted or withered. I think they can be replanted."

"What kind of seeds are these?"

"Maize, watermelon, vegetables... there are all sorts of things."

"Good."

It was very good. With so many seeds, there was a big help for survival.

"Sorry, but there's no potato. It's a type of potato cultivation, so they're all rotten and moldy."

"That's okay. How are we going to do it in this place?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Among the people he knew, there was someone who liked to cultivate things. He would occasionally bring someone over and introduce them. I thought it was useless, but I didn't expect it to be used like this.

Middle- aged man smiled wryly.

Not bringing the protagonist over meant that he was already dead. A gloomy expression passed over his face.

"If I can write it this way, I'll be happy, I suppose. But why are you collecting this?"

"You can get skills this way."

The ability to quickly cultivate food anywhere. In fact, it's a skill that has saved humanity until the end.

The wise one knew the law that could be learned.
