Chapter 428

428. The 84th Floor, Levienov's World (1)

"Do you know about the gods?"

"I do."

Belvendia nodded her head. As they descended into the labyrinth, they had obtained a lot of information. They knew about the gods and how they were invading the world.

"My world is one that has been invaded by those gods."

"......Then, Lord Taesan also entered the labyrinth to save the world."

"No. I'm different. I entered the labyrinth in a slightly different way."

"A different way?"

"It's complicated to explain. To put it accurately, the labyrinth invited people from our world at the moment of destruction."

"An invitation?"

Belvendia's eyes widened.

Taesan explained slowly. They had received an invitation from the labyrinth and, at certain intervals, returned to the earth to fight against the gods' minions.

"We're barely holding on. But many people have died. And many more will die."

The number of survivors would be no more than a handful.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan had thought of saving as many people as possible, but the limit was clear.

"So, it seems we need your help."

"You and the princess are strong, so if you help my world, the number of people dying will decrease significantly. What are you going to do?"

Taesan spoke calmly.

"I won't force you. Whatever the case, I'll have to risk my life and fight. If you're willing, then say so."

"Hmm. I've received a greater favor from you than my life, so I should do it, but..."

Beldekia looked at Diana.

"After all, what's most important to me is the princess. I can't let the princess fall into danger again."

"I understand. I don't want to use favors as an excuse to force you either."

The princess had been trapped in a model garden for over a hundred years.

She had finally escaped and was able to enjoy happiness. But having to risk her life and fight against powerful enemies that even transcenders couldn't suppress was a very desperate situation.

It was the moment when Taesan was about to give up and retreat.

"It's okay, Beldekia. Let's accept it. Taesan-nim."

Diana said it as if it was no big deal.

"Princess?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Belldegia is surprised.

"If I hadn't met Taesan-nim, I wouldn't have been able to escape from the model garden. In fact, I was as good as dead. Belldegia did repay me, but I didn't have anything to offer in return, so I was worried. It's good that it turned out well."

"Princess, are you okay? You know more about the power of transcendent beings than anyone else, don't you?"

"I already said that, didn't I? My body was originally dead, after all. Above all, Belldegia. Let's recall why we entered the labyrinth."

"......It was to save our world."

The princess, who was slowly dying, entered the labyrinth with Belldegia to save her world.

"But we failed. Many people lost their lives. We couldn't save the world. So this time...... even if it's people from another world, I want to try saving them with my own hands."

"......"

Belldegia was at a loss for words.

Diana grasped Belldegia's hand.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There are those in his world who need our help. They are the ones who can be saved with our will, without giving up. I don't want to turn a blind eye to the weak."

"......Even if it means risking our lives, right?"

"Yes."

Diana smiled softly. Belvandia let out a dry laugh at her unwavering response.

"You're that kind of person, Princess. I had forgotten."

"Of course, I wouldn't force you to come with me either. You have your own life......"

"No, my life belongs to you, Princess. Your will is my will, so don't worry about it."

"You don't have to call me Princess. Call me by my name, Belvandia."

"......Diana."

"Oh, oh."

Rilise, who had been quiet, spoke up. She was blushing and glancing around awkwardly.

"Hmm."

It was then that Belvandia and Diana carefully created some distance between them.

"Good. Taesan. I and Diana will accept your proposal."

"Thank you."

Taesan expressed his gratitude. It was a life-or-death situation, and he had to be grateful for their help, regardless of whether Taesan had saved them or not.

"What should we do now? Do we have a way to follow you when you return?"

"If we can summon Minerva and the ghost, we can make a contract and make it possible."

Taesan called out to Balbambar and discussed the contract with him.

"Not bad. Beldentia also had a wish and had to leave the labyrinth, so it's good. I'll act as the agent for the contract."

Balbambar readily accepted.

According to the labyrinth's system, a contract was formed between Taesan, Beldentia, and Diana.

[Summoning contract.] [When Taesan returns to Earth, Beldentia and Diana will also return together. If they don't return to Earth, they will temporarily reside in the labyrinth.] [It's okay to stay in the labyrinth for a while. I'll grant you that convenience. In return, you'll have to take on the 61st floor's quest.]

"Got it."

"Thank you, Balbambar."

The settlement was over. Only Relis had an uncertain expression and scratched his cheek.

"Taesan, what about me?"

"Talk to the two of them. See if you can stay with them or if you should follow me."

"You don't need me anymore since you're now offering tributes directly to Lord Zelvand... Uh..."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The release let out a sigh. She also seemed to be worried.

Taesan exchanged greetings with them and went back down to the labyrinth.

At the store, he considered buying equipment, but he was still a bit short on gold. He thought he'd gather a bit more and then make a decision.

And finally, it was time to check on the things he had obtained.

* * *

The first thing he checked was the dark magic.

[Dark Magic Creation] [Proficiency: 6%] [You can create dark magic that can be controlled through a contract with a demon by using some of the power in your world.]

Taesan created a dark magic called "Domain Liberation". It was a dark magic that opened up a domain and realized the magic contained within.

He still didn't fully understand it, but it seemed to be able to be used in a variety of ways. And he realized something through this use.

"The demon's domain can be used in conjunction with boundary magic or forbidden magic."

It wasn't strange, since all three powers were related to the power of the gods. By mixing and fusing the three types of power, he could surpass the power of the transcendents and cancel out the power of the immortals.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"How to deal with the devil's domain. I've got a little direction on that.

[Special Active Skill: Law Denial] [Mana Consumption: 3,000] [Consumption ??? : ???] [Proficiency: 1%] [It can slightly ignore the laws engraved in the world by denying the transcendent power.] [Is this kind of skill even possible...?]

The ghost nodded its head. To deny the power itself...

It was a skill that only Taesan had acquired in the labyrinth, something that no one could have imagined.

To be honest, even Taesan couldn't quite grasp the level of this skill. He knew it was exceptional, but it was too high-level, so he thought he needed to try it out to understand it for sure.

Taesan checked the next skill.

[Special Passive Skill: Undying] [Proficiency: 1%] [The lower your health, the faster your health recovery speed increases dramatically.]

"This must be one of the reasons I could endure so stubbornly."

Sado's wounds were recovering almost instantly. Taesan's proficiency was low, so he couldn't demonstrate its full potential, but it was still valuable. As long as he didn't die in one hit, he could somehow endure and quickly recover his health."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Shoes of the Free Spirit] [Attack Power + 700] [Defense + 400] [Agility + 200] [Action Speed + 20%] [Movement Speed + 20%] [Shoes that allowed the wearer to roam the world freely, unbound by anyone.]

The overall stats were decent. And there was a special effect attached to it.

"It's not like it ignores movement-restricting skills or situations. It means being free from speed-reducing effects, right?"

[Maybe that's right? Having complete freedom in action would be too overpowered.]

Even so, it was a respectable effect. It allowed me to move freely in places like swamps or space, and I wouldn't be affected by speed-reducing skills. It was worth saving over 1,000 adventurers.

Not only did I get equipment, but I also obtained authority. However, Taesan first checked the 83rd floor clear reward.

"[Ring of Endless Descent] [Attack Power + 700] [Defense - 200] [Strength - 100] [Agility - 100] [Intelligence - 100] [The wearer of the ring gains immense power, but everything else is lowered.]

It was the first time I saw equipment that decreased stats. But the attack power was that high, and for Taesan, a stat decrease of 100 was nothing. Taesan put on the ring."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I used [something]. I obtained the thick, sticky mucus that was stuck at the bottom. The thick, sticky mucus that was stuck at the bottom was something that had been wriggling around in the lowest part of the world, unaffected by anything.

The moment I thought of it as a material item, the Taesan's Wrist Guard moved. In an instant, it devoured the mucus and made it its own.

[World-Changing Wrist Guard.] [A wrist guard created by the witch herself, imbuing it with her power. With specific conditions and catalysts, it gained the power to change the laws of the world around the equipment.] [Attack +800] [Defense +800] [If you've learned the Green Witch's magic, you can use [Partial World Change].]

My attack power increased by 200 and my defense power increased by 300. It wasn't a bad boost.

"Well then."

The only thing left was one skill.

[Special Activation Skill: Fall of All Things] [For a certain period of time, everything within a certain range, excluding the user, will fall. You cannot make something higher than your own level fall. This skill has a one-week cooldown after use.]

The power of the Essence. Fall of All Things.

The description seemed different from what the Sage had used, and it needed to be verified. But Taesan alone couldn't verify it properly."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, Taesan went to the Western Library and met Ainshar.

"Do you have a skill that needs verification? Can you help me with it?"

"Anytime, if it's something like that!"

Ainshar readily agreed.

Taesan explained the skill in rough terms. Ainshar's eyes wavered as he listened to the story.

"That's... a very difficult thing to understand. To gain the power of a transcendent being..."

"That's the deal I made."

"It seems the God of Decline was quite eager to deal with you. A stubborn god wouldn't even give their own apostle such power."

Ainshar let out a sigh of admiration.

"That must be the verification you needed. Let's try using it once. I'm curious too."

There was no need to hesitate. Taesan activated the skill.

[You have activated the Decline of All Things.]

"Hmm."

"Huh?"

A faint cry echoed.

Ainshar's eyebrows twitched.

"This is... a strange sensation."

Ainshar gathered golden light. If it were usual, the light would have been bright enough to scorch the world, but now it was dim. The power felt within was also significantly weaker compared to usual."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power to bring down the very power that is manifesting itself is a authority."

Even if Ainzharr, who had been weakened by the fall of all things, were to attack with all his might, he could easily block and counterattack without any problems. The fact that Ainzharr was also affected meant that, unless one was a transcender, they could not escape.

"Ah, it's over. The duration wasn't long, was it?"

Not long after, the golden light, similar to the sun, flickered on Ainzharr's sword again. He let out a dry laugh.

"What an absurd skill this is."

There were no restrictions on the use of this skill. Unless one was a transcender, they could not resist. The target of the fall was all manifesting power.

It was a skill that bound the opponent's entire body.

"That's the power of God... I used to be able to wield it too, but it's been so long ago that it's hazy."

Ainzharr wore a wry smile.

"Next floor, right away."

Taesan said.

The 84th floor was the one Ainzharr had mentioned, where they could rescue Levinov.

It was right in front of them. Ainzharr's eyes flickered.

"...I've been waiting. Please, I beg of you."
