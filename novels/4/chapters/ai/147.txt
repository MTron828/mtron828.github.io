Chapter 148

148. Outside the Heavenly Court (4)

Tae-san sat quietly beside the statue, waiting.

The gods were staring at him with anxious eyes, wondering if he would destroy the statue, but Tae-san had no such intention.

After a while, everyone gathered together.

"It's getting crowded."

His eyes were filled with hundreds of people.

"Just as you said, I've brought everyone here."

The saint gritted his teeth, realizing that the hundreds of gods who had descended to the battlefield were all present.

"...Don't regret it! Everyone! Line up!"

The saint's cry was answered by a brief shout from everyone.

The gods quickly formed a line and surrounded Tae-san. Their movements came to a halt, and the saint grasped a bulging shield.

"O, God! We have gathered here! Please acknowledge our value and manifest yourself in the world!"

With the saint's cry, a powerful aura was felt behind Tae-san's back, emanating from the statue.

The aura spread to the gods. They lowered their shields to the ground. It felt like a seal-like energy, and the target was none other than Tae-san.

Wooooo!

The immense power is suppressing Mount Tai. It's as if a giant is pressing down on it, making Mount Tai's lips curl up.

Their God is the God of Self-Recognition.

The believers themselves have built up values and, receiving the aid of God, bring them to reality. Although an individual may be insignificant, when hundreds gather, the story changes.

By supporting each other, they create a massive seal, receiving the aid of God, and form a bond similar to a seal.

The power suppressing Mount Tai is their values.

Just as their special trait cannot be overcome by physical strength, magic, or skills, it cannot be defeated.

[So, you said that, didn't you? Even if they are weak, as long as God aids them, they can suppress you. Why did you give them the opportunity?]

The ghost couldn't understand it yet.

Mount Tai's opportunity was simple.

I will wait beside the stone statue.

So, go and summon the believers of your God.

And then, with the power of your God, trample me over.
Here is the translation of the text:

In fact, it was as if they had made him fight with their all. The method was completely different from what Tae-san had done before, so the ghost was bewildered.

"I told you, I'll do my best to get it, I'll get it."

Tae-san looked up at the power that was crushing him.

This was not just a simple feeling or divine power. It was the power of hundreds of gods, each with their own will. The accumulation of their powers was crushing Tae-san.

"This is us! This is the power of the gods we believe in!"

A saint who was confident of victory exclaimed, unable to move Tae-san.

"Omniscient one! You will die before our power!"

The saint said, "The gods of the outside world said they would reward us according to our achievements."

Tae-san ignored the saint's words and said to the ghost, "Then what is the greatest reward that the gods of the outside world can give us?"

The ghost hesitated for a moment, then spoke. "I think they will crush the confidence of the gods outside."

"Alright."

The confidence of the gods outside. There was no significant difference between them and the gods of the underworld. The underworld was nothing.

It's about breaking that confidence.

"So I thought of that method."

Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san raised his hand. He placed his hand on the statue and slowly stood up. As he saw the resistance, the saint was startled and shouted.

"Everyone, use your maximum strength! We're going to crush this unbeliever!"

The saints were more energized by the saint's words. The power that had been oppressing Tae-san was even stronger.

"The sun god is also in the mysterious realm."

He had said that the ghost was sitting deep in the mysterious realm.

Hammon was also a sun god. He was born from the sun god who had just been defeated in the sky and was also a sun god.

The god they believed in was similar to the verifying god Fabshwa.

There were many gods who had similar titles.

"So I think I'll like this the most."

Tae-san clenched his fist.

*[You have activated your own verification.]*

Tae-san stands up. The pressure he felt is noticeably reduced.

He turned his gaze to the believers of the self-verifying god.

They were trembling.

"What, what?"

"What's going on?"

"Don't be surprised, everyone!"

The saint shouted hastily, but his trembling gaze was impossible to hide.

"What's going on?"
Here is the translation of the text:

From Taesan, I felt a different aura, one that was unlike anything I had experienced before. A saint who believed in the God of Self-Verification could immediately understand what it was.

That's what I've accumulated.

Taesan's aura was taking shape, flowing out like a form, revealing what he had done and what he had achieved.

"But what about this?"

The problem was the sheer volume of it.

Taesan's aura, which flowed endlessly, was something that even a saint who had reached the peak of magic couldn't imagine.

Not even a warrior who was unbeatable in battle, a saint who believed in a high god, or a magician who had reached the pinnacle of magic could reach it.

The aura that was spreading out was making a barrier that even they couldn't break through.

"Everyone! Be determined! Believe in our God!"

The saint raised his voice in a resolute tone. The ones who were swaying finally regained their composure and put even more pressure on Taesan.

"It's useless."

Taesan revealed a smile. He took a step forward. The barrier created by the gods to prove themselves was starting to be pushed back by Taesan's aura.

"You are nothing."

Even if thousands of people who believed in the God of Self-Verification gathered, they couldn't stop Taesan's proof.

"What you've accumulated is nothing. It's all meaningless."
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san's laughter echoed as he went back again.

The cauldron began to boil with a golden glow.

"...What was this?"

The ghost realized.

The gods of the labyrinth wondered what they would like.

As Tae-san had said, it was to tear apart the external pride. He was proving that what you had accumulated was nothing. With hundreds of proofs, he could trample them down, just by accumulating them in the labyrinth alone.

And he was also telling the god of self-proclamation. Your domain is nothing. The level of the god of self-proclamation who had taken up residence in the labyrinth was much higher.

Lowly.

Tae-san went back again.

"Ah!"

"Ah!"

The power suppressing Tae-san was no different from their own value.

The more they were crushed and torn apart, the more they received a blow to their own strength.

Some couldn't hold on and vomited blood, collapsing.

"It's not possible!"

The saint shouted loudly.

"It can't be like this!"

Everyone who had come here was recognized by the god of self-proclamation as having value. Everyone was an elite and was originally revered in their original world.
Here is the translation of the text:

But it's only because one person was slightly inferior? Their values were not even comparable to that of one person?

"That's impossible!"

His entire life, all his faith, was being denied.

"Didn't you prove yourself on your own? Didn't you come here for that reason?"

Revealing oneself is similar to trampling someone. Even the saint before us went through a similar process. We trampled others and became a shadow of the divine.

"I don't care, but just being here means you've made up your mind."

This is the battlefield of gods.

The condition for victory is to wipe out the followers of other gods.

Fast.

The mountain is walking. With each step, dozens of followers are shedding blood and collapsing.

"That's why you should accept it."

Suddenly, the mountain approached the saint's face and slapped them.

The saint's body fell like a broken doll.

The mountain looked around.

There was no one with a clear mind. Everyone was foaming at the mouth, collapsing, and rolling around on the ground.

"It's over."

The mountain threw a punch. The self-proclaimed god's statue, which had been standing before their followers, shattered.
Here is the translation of the text:

You have destroyed the statue of the God of Self-Proclamation. The God of Self-Proclamation has been driven out of the battlefield of the gods.

The gods of the labyrinth are delighted. The God of Self-Proclamation is extremely pleased. He is completely satisfied with your actions.

The system window announcing that the God of Self-Proclamation is satisfied appeared. This window did not appear when I processed the gods of the three sets before.

"Still."

This is the correct answer. It is the most preferred method to receive the highest reward.

"A, Aah..."

The saint gazed at the broken statue with a face that seemed to be crumbling like the world.

A huge power began to escape through the rift in the sky.

"A, Aahahah!"

The saint screamed. Something translucent was escaping from his body.

This was the same for the fallen saints as well.

"Soul?"

[It seems like that.]

The translucent thing followed the God of Self-Proclamation and disappeared into the rift in the sky.

"The soul belongs to the gods."

It was a natural thing, as it seemed.

It was only natural that the saints who had followed the gods and did not surrender their souls would not be spared.

What will happen to the souls that have been dragged to the gods? Will the defeated gods take revenge on the saints? Or will they show mercy like a sage?

This was a story that had no interest to Tai Shan.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Let's hurry and settle things."

Tae-san immediately moved his footsteps to meet the next gods.

There was also a mansion similar to his own self-awareness god in that place. Tae-san burst open the door with his finger.

"An intruder!"

"Everyone, gather!"

Tae-san beats them up. He knocks down the obstacles and stands before the statue.

"Show them to me. The things you've accumulated. The value you believe in."

And he waits for them to finish their preparations, just like before.

"I'll regret it!"

"I've already heard that before."

This god was a mysterious god who crawled up from the bottom. He had seen the gods use some kind of magical power.

Tae-san's face, which had been blocking the attacks, was pale.

"It's just magic? I thought it was something extraordinary because it was mysterious."

He repels the rushing attacks with fire and ice. He unleashes the wind and crushes the shaking earth.
Here is the translation of the text:

It was a simple movement without any elaborate techniques or ornate decorations. Just that alone was enough to block everything, implying that the god was on a level above them.

But the saint thought that the god was just rushing to block things without doing anything, and laughed out loud.

"Look! This is the magic given to us by our god!"

Pfft!

A rain of ice began to fall.

The saint watched it calmly, being a dignitary.

Meanwhile, a magical arrow flew through the air.

The god roughed it up with his sword.

"Hahah! You can't do anything, you heretic!"

The saint was very pleased.

As the god had entrusted him, the saint knew that the gods who were supposed to be his own kind had all perished in front of him.

The god would give them even greater power.

As the saint was fantasizing happily, the god clenched his fist.

"It's too slow."

Because the god had given it directly, the magic had become a low-level magic.

However, the power of those he was dealing with was extremely weak, and he couldn't even pull out the magic that was embedded.

"There's nothing to gain."

The god made a decision. Now it's time to get rid of it.

He took a step forward.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have triggered the Earthquake.]

Earthquake. In the labyrinth, it's a worthless, not particularly impressive magic.

But it's different here.

The ground is shaking. Those who were confident in their victory and charging forward suddenly stumble and fall.

Kururung!

The earth creaks and groans. Their buildings emit uneasy sounds and decorations start falling.
