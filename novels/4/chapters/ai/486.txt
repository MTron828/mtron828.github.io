**Episode 487**

**487. 91st Floor. Uroboros (8)**

One's true nature. It was something that had to be understood by oneself.

But if one could receive help from others, there was no harm in accepting it.

Essence was a god who governed one's true nature. Then, Essence could understand the true nature of Taesan. That was the thought behind the question, and Essence stroked his chin.

"Understanding one's true nature... You mean realizing your own true nature, right?"

"Yes."

"Well, it's not impossible. Many mortals have come to me seeking to find themselves."

It was possible. Taesan's eyes sparkled.

"But one's true nature is what makes up that individual. If you try to observe it carelessly, your sense of self may waver. To realize it yourself, you must perform a designated ritual in my sanctuary."

"Then, what if I were to leave this place?"

"Then I can do it anytime."

Essence said with a smile.

"Originally, you would have to offer yourself to me to make it possible, but for you, I'll do it without any conditions. And besides, you owe me a favor."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Thank you."

I received a clear answer. If we solve Uroboros and go outside, the god of essence can help us understand its true nature.

"What's good. Let's get to the main point then."

Essential smiled faintly.

"Let's move to kill that damn thing."

* * *

"Will Uroboros return to its original state if we just deal with the worthless ones?"

"Probably. It's like a foreign substance stuck between the gears. If we remove the foreign substance, the machine will return to its original form."

"That's easy to understand."

If we deal with the worthless ones, the quest will be cleared. Essential scowled.

"There's a problem... We don't know how Uroboros will react afterwards. We don't have information on whether it has complete intelligence or can make correct judgments."

If we make a mistake, the restored Uroboros might judge them as foreign substances and try to eliminate them. With concerns in his words, Taesan replied.

"It'll be okay. Probably."

Uroboros looked at Taesan, who was approaching it.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And it seemed like he was going to come in again, so I turned my gaze back to him. At least, I didn't think he would harbor any hostility towards me.

"Well, that's a relief... but we need to be prepared."

In any case, dealing with the useless guy was the top priority. To do that, I needed to take a break first. Taesan had consumed a lot of boundary lines responding to Essential's attack, and the Chaos Call was also on cooldown. He needed time to recover.

Taesan quietly recovered his internal energy in Essential's space.

And Essential gazed at Taesan from a distance.

"What is that guy doing?"

Essential looked at Taesan with an interested gaze. Although he didn't show it outwardly, he was very curious about Taesan's true identity.

"I can't read him either."

He was a god of essence.

If he wanted to, he could read the essence of even an equal existence to some extent.

But with Taesan, only the surface that was visible on the outside could be seen. The deep layers hidden within could not be read.

"There's no one like that, except for the high gods."

But Taesan was not a high god. He possessed a heterogeneous power, but he was clearly a being of this world.

"......I don't know."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Even the great transcendent being couldn't know about Taesan.

An uncontrollable curiosity arose on his face.

He had a personality that couldn't bear not knowing something.

Essential focused his mind and expanded his vision. He tried to see what was deep inside Taesan.

It was his authority. Only a god who governed the essence could observe the deep place.

His vision tried to read Taesan's essence.

Going deeper than the surface psychology, he observed the deep place.

In the end, Essential saw it.

A distorted mental image.

Everything was dark and formless, a mind that couldn't be grasped.

Essential saw what Halfren and Amelia had seen.

"What is this?"

Essential's eyes trembled for a moment. It was much more unfamiliar than he had thought. The bewildered Essential was about to move to gain a deeper understanding.

Something appeared in his vision.

Something formless, whose power and identity couldn't be grasped.

As he tried to grasp it closely, he felt a strong backlash.

[Stop.]

"Laugh."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Essential unknowingly took a step back. His eyes were filled with astonishment.

"What's going on?"

Something inside Taesan was forcing him out.

Of course, if the master of the mind directly refused, Essential would have to find another way, no matter what. But Taesan didn't realize that Essential was reading his mind. As the god of essence, it was difficult for even the transcendent beings who governed concepts to notice his observation.

Despite that, he was driven out by something inside Taesan.

"......This is unusual."

Essential's eyes sparkled with interest.

"Is there something like that too?"

An unknown existence.

It piqued Essential's curiosity. He quietly gazed at Taesan.

And before long, Taesan opened his eyes.

In his field of vision, Essential was staring at him with a fixed gaze.

"Why are you doing that?"

"No."

Essential shook his head and stood up.

"Is the recovery complete?"

"Yes."

"Then let's go."

Essential smiled cheerfully and moved forward.

* * *

They approached the worthless person again.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The intangible energy that had spread out in all directions was growing stronger. 

'You said you could kill that thing?' 

'Yes.' 

'Good. Although the worthless ones have no form, they must have a core that constitutes their being. The core exists deep within the worthless ones. If you pierce through it, you can kill it. The only problem is, that thing is stronger than you.' 

'I can do it.' 

Taesan replied calmly. Essential smiled faintly at Taesan's unwavering attitude.

'You're not arrogant, but...' 

Essential gazed at Taesan with a thoughtful expression.

There was concern in his eyes.

After gazing at Taesan for a moment, he seemed to have made up his mind and placed his hand on Taesan's head. His power began to manifest towards Taesan.

Essential's power infused into Taesan. Taesan did not resist and accepted it.

[You have acquired the special activation skill [Essence of Oneself].]

'This is...' 

'It's better to be certain. You'll naturally learn how to use it. Do you feel it?' 

'Yes.'"

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan quietly grasped the power he had received. He could understand how to use it and its effects as if it were his own hands and feet.

It was mysterious.

"Are you giving me this kind of power?"

The power given by Essential was not something that would be given to a stranger at first meeting. Other gods had also watched over Taesan steadily and given him various trials before granting him power.

"I didn't originally plan to give you this much. I thought I'd give you a moderate level of power. But... I think you need this now. You and I both."

Essential chuckled.

"Well, I've attacked you without warning, and there are other things too. You can think of it as an apology for all those things."

"Thank you."

"That's enough. If you can just get out of here, you can do anything. You can erase that annoying thing from this universe, and I'll be happy. I'll open the way for you."

Essential stepped forward.

A worthless being stirred. It got up and rushed towards Essential with clear malice and hostility.

"It seems that thing has realized it's its own end."

Essential revealed his teeth.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His aura expands, his essence unfolding to manifest in the world.

Essence raises its fist and strikes.

His essence takes shape, covering the worthless ones. An attack that contains himself, ignoring all defense and offense, directly striking the opponent's essence. It was an overwhelming uppercut that surpassed Taesan's essence strike.

To block that one hit, the opponent must also wield a power that matches it. The worthless ones' everything rises to respond to Essence's fist.

Kuuuuung!

The power to make everything worthless collides with the transcendent's power.

The aftermath shakes the inside of Uroboros. The distorted time and space are completely shattered and scattered.

Taesan moved immediately.

[You have activated Chaos Call.]

He ignores the scattered, formless power and breaks through, covering his entire body with a gray, ash-like aura. The worthless ones try to block, but Essence bursts out laughing and intercepts.

"You'll pay for ignoring me!"

Kuuuuung!

A massive shockwave spreads. Although it's not a direct hit, the boundary line that surrounds Taesan's entire body trembles.

This is the true confrontation between the Transcendent and the High God.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even if they were weakened, they were still more powerful than the current Taesan.

'But.'

It wasn't an absolute impossibility.

Kagagaga!

The worthless one created a massive dome to block Essential's attack. Essential clenched its fist and swung it. The outer part of the dome shook violently, creating a gap.

Taesan ran towards the gap. He focused his mind, drew his sword, and filled himself with the boundary line. He stomped his foot.

Quack.

He thrust his sword into the gap and expanded the boundary line. The gap opened, and a path was revealed. Taesan quickly entered the dome created by the worthless one.

Taesan, who had gathered his strength, looked up.

He felt an invisible concentration of power in front of him.

That concentration was different from the external, formless energy. It was thicker and heavier. Even though it was invisible, it was palpable.

That was the core of the worthless one.

Ripple.

The energy began to gather around the core. Centered around the core, the energy took on a human form and appeared in this world.

[A fragment of the worthless one appeared.]"

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The worthless being's true body was comparable in size to the sun. But what was here was only a mountain range at best. Compared to its true body, it was a size that couldn't even be compared to a fly.

It was consuming most of its energy to block the Essential's attack. In reality, the opponent it had to face was only a tiny fragment.

But that was not a clone, but the genuine article itself.

The will of the genuine article could be felt.

A strong, intense hostility towards Taesan.

It didn't feel like a complete intellect, as if it was a beast gazing at an enemy that had invaded its territory.

Just by looking, it was as if it could erase the value of the world with its gaze.

The worthless being's arm moved.

Ku-u-ung!

The condensed power of the physical body became a wave and crashed down. Taesan quickly dodged.

[You have activated the Great Collapse [Chaos].]

The gray Great Collapse was realized in the world, colliding with the physical wave.

And what was being pushed back was the Great Collapse. The Great Collapse, which had crossed the boundary, was being buried by the physical wave, and its power and value were being erased.

Taesan firmly grasped the realm of chaos and charged forward.

Kwaaa-a-a-ang!

The physical body and the gray sword clashed. The power scattered in all directions, exploding outward.

Kagagagak!"

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The aura of the formless entity is trying to adhere to Taesan's entire body.

It's waving its boundary line and shaking it off.

The formless entity's wave is rising straight up, trying to engulf Taesan.

Taesan is rolling his feet and trying to escape.

The formless entity's power is covering everything in all directions, blocking Taesan's movement space and gradually applying pressure. Taesan tries to break free from the boundary line that binds him, but the formless entity's power, which has invaded the space, cannot be easily pushed back by the boundary line.

Taesan clenches his fist.

[You have activated magic overlap.] [You have activated Great Destruction [Chaos].] [You have activated Baal's Dark Space Lockdown.]

Kwagaga!

The ash-colored aura is shaking everything in all directions.

Magic and dark magic, and everything else, are pouring out to open up the space.

But it doesn't reach.

The formless entity's aura is flowing out endlessly, like a bottomless jar, without any signs of weakening despite colliding with essence and countless other things for an immeasurable amount of time.

That's a worthless guy.

If I'm given enough time, even with just that small piece, I can erase an entire galaxy from this world.

"It would have devoured countless planets, suns, black holes, and celestial bodies, rendering their value useless.

'As expected, it's strong.'

Most of its power was focused on blocking the essentials, but it was still surpassing the limits.

However, Taesan was certain.

'I can win.'

The power of the worthless self was capable of rendering the world's value useless.

That power was above the concept of value. Fundamentally, Taesan's power was like a negation magic that stood absolutely superior to everything in the world.

It was close to the concept of divinity.

The material energy surged again. Taesan raised his sword and swung it. The boundary line exploded, sweeping the front.

Kuuuuung!

If it was a power related to concepts and laws, Taesan's boundary line could never be superior.

The problem was that the opponent's power and level were clearly above Taesan's, but that didn't matter. Taesan had a skill that could narrow the gap.

With the current situation, Taesan had a chance of winning even against a part of the divine.

With confidence, Taesan activated his skill.

[You have activated Absolute Resistance.] [You have activated your true nature.]"
