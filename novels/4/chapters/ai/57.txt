58. Easy Mode. Choi Jung-hyuk (2)

Choi Jung-hyuk looked contentedly at the spacious room.

The city hall was crowded right now, with every room packed full of people.

But he was alone in this spacious room.

"This is what power is."

It felt so good.

This was what he had strived for, building up influence through hardship.

"You bastard. Enjoying yourself?"

A woman with long hair snapped at him. Beside her, a boy with a defiant look was biting his lip.

Their bodies were tightly bound in thick chains.

Choi Jung-hyuk scoffed at them.

"Good, isn't it? You ignorant fools will never possess this kind of power."

"You're just playing around. If it weren't for your worthless tricks, you'd be dead."

Itaeyeon taunted him, and Choi Jung-hyuk nodded in agreement.

"Well, I'll give you that. You're strong."

He spoke calmly, but it was an astonishing level. The difference in strength was such that if they faced each other head-on with the power to bend chains and turn walls to gold, limbs would be shattered.

"But luck is on my side."
Choi Jung-hyuk smirked.

The special quest to venture outside. While everyone else was delighted, Choi Jung-hyuk felt a chill.

He had thought he could never meet the Alone Mode.

According to what they had posted on the community, clearing Alone Mode had become a suitable point of contention unlike Hard or Normal Mode.

So, he openly showed disdain and malice towards them, leading to this opportunity to venture outside.

He didn't believe everything posted on the community was true, but if even some of it was, his influence would be completely destroyed. He hesitated and found a way out, but ended up outside with no other options.

However, luckily for him, he was summoned near the city hall, so he could enter without encountering a single monster.

He quickly realized that those who had boasted about the Alone Mode were very weak. Despite some resistance, he subdued them surprisingly easily.

Choi Jung-hyuk realized that most of those in Alone Mode were weak, meaning he could handle even them.
Indeed, as the community had said, if it's a crazy difficulty, everyone would focus solely on enduring.

So he let his guard down. Even when Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Jun-hyuk appeared, he tried to grab them with force.

"These guys are like monsters."

Choi Jung-hyuk clicked his tongue. But those two were different. They tried to grab Choi Jung-hyuk by knocking away the players who tried to grab him. In the momentum of the bull, he had to flee with a hasty screech.

But he won.

"That's why people need to use their heads."

The players in the alone mode. And grasped hold to. Dominion
They entered the labyrinth. It was a world where law and order were absent, risking lives. Thus, people had to live according to the world they were in.

Yet everyone tried to uphold order and the laws of the earth. Everyone tried to help each other and live together.

He wasn't so naive.

Choi Jung-hyuk quickly entered the labyrinth and assessed the difficulty. He was the first to realize the split dimensions and drew several conclusions.

The number of people who can enter the labyrinth is limited. Even if dimensions split, there are so many easy mode players that empty dimensions cannot arise.

In other words, it can be controlled.

With his conclusions in mind, he moved swiftly.

He intercepted those who were slightly ahead.

It's a place without law or order.

Even a slight push can send people into a frenzy.

He gathered these people and began to exert control.

Initially, there were some who resisted, but through violence and persuasion, soon their control became routine.

Except for a few who resisted, everyone followed his words.

It was all so captivating.

"In the end, wherever people gather, it's as sordid as that."

Lee Tae-yeon muttered, watching Choi Jung-hyuk leaning back casually on the sofa.
Sure. You did very well. How long can you keep it up like this?

Choi Jung-hyuk chuckled.

Certainly, he had chosen the Easy Mode. Its limits were clear, even glaring.

Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk. Those in the Alone Mode were truly strong. Even the Hard Mode players from outside didn't compare to their strength.

No matter how strong he became, there existed a wall he could never catch up to.

"Strength isn't everything."

One law from Earth. Power and position are not correlated.

He controls the Easy Mode. Despite the difference in power, their sheer numbers were overwhelming. The side with more voices wins, and he intended to use that to his advantage.

They were there for that purpose.

If he could keep those in the Alone Mode occupied, he could use them as he pleased.

"Fools."

Good people.

But weak.

That's why they were manipulated by someone as clever as him.

"The future looks bright."

"I think so too."

Suddenly, a loud noise erupted from outside.

Boom!

"Whoa!"

Choi Jung-hyuk flinched and hunched over in fright. Dust billowed out thickly.
"What the!"

A man with a drowsy face stood at the door.

* * *

A rough-looking man.

His lean muscles caught the eye.

Choi Jung-hyuk.

A familiar face appeared.

And in another sense, there was someone else he missed.

A face with a youthful but worn look, unlike memory. Perhaps because he was still immature, his emotional changes were clearly visible on his expression.

Lee Tae-yeon stared blankly at him while chained.

"Long time no see."

They had conversed several times through the community, but seeing each other face-to-face felt different.

For a moment, Tae-san glanced at her.

A young boy with a face that stared blankly back at him, just like her.

"You're Kang Joon-hyuk?"

"Yes, uh, yes......"

Kang Joon-hyuk, chained up, hurriedly nodded. Their gaze was not on Tae-san but beside him.

"That's..."

"Oh? Can they see me?"

A ghost muttered to himself at the eyes directed towards him.

"Let's save the story for later."

He bowed.

Tae-san moved forward.

Choi Jung-hyuk flinched for a moment and suppressed a laugh.
"Got it. You're Kang Tae-san?"

"Ah... yes......"

Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk sighed deeply.

"Younger than I expected?"

While Lee Tae-yeon thought to herself, Tae-san stared silently without responding. His subdued gaze momentarily sent chills down their spines, but Choi Jung-hyuk ignored it deliberately.

He's holding hostages. Seeing that he broke the door, he definitely seems strong, but they couldn't lay a hand on him.

"Hyung!"

Jun-geun arrived late, supporting Hwi-yeon.

"Uhh... Jun-geun. Thank you."

Hwi-yeon staggered to her feet. She momentarily glared resentfully at Tae-san, then bit her lip upon seeing Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk chained, and Choi Jung-hyuk.

"You..."

"All the players are here now."

Choi Jung-hyuk leaned back on the sofa nonchalantly.

Hwi-yeon retorted coldly, "Please restrain yourself. If you cross the line any further, I won't stay quiet."

"What right do you have?"

Choi Jung-hyuk countered instead.
"I killed someone. So what did I do? I just intervened because they were fighting and bothering me. Why are you pressuring me like this?"

"This..."

Hwi-yeon gritted her teeth.

She, too, had ears. Among the people she saved, there were those who spoke about Choi Jung-hyuk. It was also said that there were not a few people he dealt with without anyone knowing.

But there's no evidence.

If the opponent was a monster, you could just kick them out, but dealing with a human was something she couldn't grasp.

Finally, Hwi-yeon gave up and calmly asked, "What do you want?"

"What do I want?"

"Don't beat around the bush. You want something, that's why you're causing all this commotion."

At her cold words, Choi Jung-hyuk smirked.

"It's simple. Give me command authority."

"To you, an EZ Mode?"

"You guys are strong, I know that. But have any of you ever commanded?"

"..."

Hwi-yeon couldn't answer. She was just an ordinary university student; being a team leader for a group project was the extent of her experience in giving orders. She certainly had no experience managing an unspecified number of people.

"I've managed people a lot."

"There are probably many others like you."


"Sure. There might be many people in Anyang like that. But have they managed a mode like me?"

Choi Jung-hyuk confidently stated.

"I've managed both Earth and Labyrinth. Achievements in managing both sides."

With this kind of argument, Hwi-yeon had nothing to say. It was true that he had managed the entire Labyrinth in one way or another.

"I want one thing. My safety. And command authority. Guarantee these two things for me. Then I'll release them."

Choi Jung-hyuk spoke leisurely. He was confident that the other party would accept.

They killed monsters, not humans. Regardless of how he came out, there was a judgment that the opponent would only confine him and not kill him.

"..."

Hwi-yeon couldn't answer. She was still young and couldn't judge what was right.

"If you can't judge as a hard mode, who will judge? Are you going to leave it to those on Earth with superficial power?"

Hwi-yeon hesitated. She was still young. When the opponent argued so strongly, it was difficult to say anything in response. Eventually, it was when she accepted.

"What happens if I guarantee it?"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"The quiet Taesan finally spoke up. Choi Jung-hyuk's face twisted at the interruption that had disrupted the smooth progress.

'You think that guarantee will protect your life? If I twist your limbs here, who will shout that promises weren't kept? Who will punish the one who aims to kill you?'

Taesan spoke casually.

'You're mistaken.'

Choi Jung-hyuk thought himself clever. He oppressed people without adhering to order and law.

But he had forgotten that he himself couldn't be bound by order and law. Taesan took a step forward. Seeing Taesan approaching, Choi Jung-hyuk involuntarily trembled.

Looking into Taesan's deeply sunken eyes, Choi Jung-hyuk realized.

The man before him wasn't someone who belonged to order and law like him. A chilling sensation swept over Choi Jung-hyuk in that moment.

'Don't come closer!'

Taesan didn't reply. Choi Jung-hyuk hastily reached for his radio as he watched Taesan slowly approaching. He planned to contact those holding hostages from afar and order them to kill one.

But as he was about to speak into the radio, a cracking sound split the air.

Crack.

The radio in his hand shattered from Taesan's grip.

'Huh?'"
Here's the translation of the text into English:

Itaeyeon's eyes widened. The fact that the walkie-talkie ended up in Taesan's hands meant he had personally moved to take it. However, she hadn't seen anything.

"Y-You bastard!"

Choi Junghyuk gritted his teeth. He wasn't just arrogantly boasting with only one hostage in hand. He pulled the lever.

Crunch!

Along with the collapsing sound, steel bars fell from the ceiling.

"Die!"

The massive steel bars accelerated by gravity fell. Taesan didn't dodge the steel bars that could crush bones and bring down buildings. The steel bars fiercely struck Taesan.

"[Kang Taesan's Block activated.] [0 damage to Kang Taesan.] [0 damage to Kang Taesan.] [0 damage to Kang Taesan.] [0 damage to Kang Taesan.]"

Kicking away the fallen steel bars, Taesan advanced again.

"Wha-what?"

Choi Junghyuk froze for a moment at the system window that appeared before his eyes.

Players have defense, but it's not enough to stop steel bars of that size. We've already tested it. Even someone with defense over 5 would take close to 20 damage.

And yet 0? No damage at all?

He couldn't contain his terror and shouted,

"Come out!"

Kwang!
Here's the translation of the text into English:

As the doors inside the building opened, people poured out. From outside, a crowd had gathered and surrounded the building.

"Why are there so many?"

Junggeun, who had been watching dumbfoundedly, was astonished. Hundreds of people had surrounded them.

Choi Junghyuk shouted harshly,

"Kill them!"

Taesan calmly observed the hundreds of people massing around.
