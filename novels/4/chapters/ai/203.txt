Chapter 204

204. The 51st Floor, the Forest Where Mysterious Things Come to Life (1)

Tai Shan, who was exploring the city, asked a question.

"Who made this?"

No matter how hard he looked, it seemed like adventurers had built this place. A ghost replied.

[We didn't do it. I was here before I came in, and Ainshahr was here before that. It was here even before the inspiration came.]

"So..."

[It was made by a magician. You can easily figure out why it was made.]

As Tai Shan was talking, a man approached him.

"Are you a new adventurer?"

The man, wearing tattered armor, approached Tai Shan. His face was filled with annoyance.

The man stretched out his hand towards Tai Shan.

"I'm fed up, but... I have to do it. My name is Darion."

Tai Shan grasped the man's hand and looked at him.

When Tai Shan met with NPCs before, a system window would appear to introduce them.

However, no system window appeared for Darion.

The meaning was clear.

Darion caught Tai Shan's gaze and shrugged his shoulders.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I figured that I'm not someone trapped in a labyrinth, just like you, an adventurer."

[Are you still here?]

The ghost looked at Darien and said, "Ah, you're here? That means you're dead, doesn't it?"

[So you're here. Is that a complaint?]

"No, no."

Darien suppressed a smile, as if the appearance of a dead warrior as a ghost in front of him was a source of joy.

"Let's hurry up and get some rest first. Follow me."

Darien walked down the road again. Taesan looked around once more.

The scenery was not what one would expect of a labyrinth. There were numerous buildings and roads that were broken but still intact.

And beyond the village, a vast open space could be seen.

"This place is more like a world than a labyrinth."

"You'll understand as you take a look around. Whether you'll go further or stay here like us."

"Us?"

"Everyone here is an adventurer, to be precise."

As he spoke, Darien saw many people, but no system screens appeared.

"You seem to have lived for a long time."
Here is the translation of the text:

As I looked at the building and the village, I could tell that they had lived here for a long time.

Darien smiled wryly.

"This is a place like that. It's a gathering place for those who have lost their way."

Darien walked forward.

"There are three types of adventurers who venture into the labyrinth. One is the adventurer who dies while descending into the labyrinth. This is the most common and most numerous type."

The difficulty of the labyrinth is extremely high. Even for someone who is exceptionally talented and skilled, there is a high chance of death if they let their guard down for even a moment.

As I saw that only one person, Lee Tae-yeon, had survived among the hundreds of thousands who had chosen the solo mode, I realized that even those who were talented and skilled could not survive.

"And then there is the adventurer who reaches the end of the labyrinth. I'm not sure if this is real, though even heroes can die like this."

[If I hadn't gotten hit, it might have been possible, but since I'm dead, it's not.]

I was a bit curious about this.

Were there any other adventurers who had cleared the labyrinth, excluding Lee Tae-yeon?

"Is there a person who has actually cleared it?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"I don't know. I've heard rumors, but I've never seen it with my own eyes. Even the leaders of the guidance corps can't go down there, so what makes you think we can?"

Da-ri said carelessly.

"The other one is us. We're the ones whose hearts are broken."

As the difficulty level increased, the group gave up their strategy and settled in the labyrinth.

Unlike NPCs, they were not bound by contracts or agreements.

The 51st floor was where such people gathered.

"'That's what Ta-yeon said.'"

For a very long time, the guides of evil had not yet taken up their positions, and these people had lived on the 51st floor since ancient times.

Time had come to a standstill for them.

And the guides of evil were waiting for them in the 51st floor, as Min-shin said.

Ta-san expanded his senses and listened to Da-ri's guidance.

"This is a residential area. If you work hard and save money, you can live here."

There were countless single-family homes there. They were taking shape as houses, but were on the verge of collapse. Even the people of a doomed earth lived in better houses than this.

"This is a bar. Come here when you want to eat."

Here is the translation of the text:

Inside the tavern, a woman was drinking alone. She glanced at the mountain and the river, and then said:

"Are you a new adventurer?"

"Yes."

"Well, you're new here. You'll be stuck here just like me. Let's meet and be happy."

"That's not going to happen."

"No, it will happen."

The woman laughed at Taesan.

"We all thought we were superior and moved forward together, but we've all ended up stuck here. So you're the same too."

Darien didn't say a word, as if he agreed with her words.

Through the conversation, Taesan could tell.

Taesan and their values were fundamentally different.

I think it's impossible for the story to proceed like this.

The woman turned around and Darien continued to guide the village.

"This is the church. Those who want to pray can come here and pray."

The exterior of the church was also in disrepair, and the interior was visible.

"There are no one praying."

"I'm going to sleep and meet God."

Taesan chuckled.

"That's the story."
Here is the translation of the text:

Taeyeon said, "The 51st floor is where people with broken hearts live." So she believed she could take a rest here.

However, when she really understood the 51st floor, she realized it was a foolish dream.

This place is a labyrinth.

A labyrinth does not give anything to those who do not descend into it.

And these people are those who do not descend into the labyrinth with broken hearts.

They built the village, gathered food, and repaired buildings, but there was no enough material.

They could buy goods from the shop owner.

However, the problem was collecting the money itself.

If they worked together to catch monsters, they could get gold, but the amount was not abundant. They were people with broken hearts. They did not want to fight for their lives.

Therefore, the 51st floor was always short of food and buildings were crumbling.

And people with broken hearts were jealous of those who advanced.

"'You're a complete failure.'"

"'You'll end up like this if you stay here for a few hundred years.'"

"'Well, I guess.'"

Taeyeon even felt like she would go crazy if she stayed here, so she quickly left.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What are you doing here?"

"Nothing."

Darien replied with a bitter tone.

"We're not doing anything. I'm just receiving guidance from the administrator of the labyrinth and guiding people, but I think I'll have to stop soon. I'm so fed up."

The ones who were lost in the difficulty of the labyrinth. That's why they had given up and sat down.

They were consumed by powerlessness and were literally buried.

"'It's even harder than the guides.'"

No, maybe they were the future forms of the guides.

The ones who were lost and wandering.

That was the 51st floor adventurers.

*

"Really, it's annoying... but I still have to finish the guidance I've taken on."

Darien pointed to the edge of the village with his finger.

There was a forest that was impossible to measure ahead.

"Are you willing to go down there?"

Tae-san nodded his head.

"I don't think it's possible, but I'll tell you this. There's a unicorn with a green horn somewhere in the plain at the end. If you kill it and take its horn, you can escape the 51st floor."
Here is the translation of the text:

Taeyeon said that the 51st floor was extremely unique and that it was completely different from anything she had seen before.

As she said, it was indeed extremely unusual. It was not a maze, but a vast plain where one could find unicorns. The clearance of the floor was finding unicorns in this plain, not in a maze.

"I'm saying this just in case, hero. You can't say it."

[I know. I'm not thinking of talking about the path. The strategy of the maze is only by one's own strength, without anyone's help. ...It's already been broken, but.]

Taeyeon thought that Tae-san was in easy mode and talked about the information about the solo mode. The content was in Tae-san's head.

"I'll tell you in advance, you can enter the house and sleep anywhere. If you want to eat, you can go up to the maze and somehow get it. Of course, there will be penalties, but you can get a small amount of gold by struggling. You can then exchange it with the shop owner."

It was as if Tae-san was saying that she would definitely fail and come back here. Tae-san shook her head.

"I won't come back."

"No, you will come back."

Darien twitched his lips.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I was like you. I descended into the labyrinth faster than anyone. I was full of confidence, thinking I could clear it and make it to the end. But I was blocked here. Not just me, but everyone here is the same.

Darien pointed his finger towards the forest.

"Only those who receive the support of the guides or have the nature of a dragon can cross over. That's it. It's like the demons we've encountered before. If that's not the case, no one can cross over."

Darien spoke with conviction, as if his own thoughts were absolute truth.

"Even the warriors standing next to you are the same. They descended into the labyrinth but couldn't clear it and died."

[You're right, that's a true statement, so I won't say anything about it, but you're bringing it up in a really disgusting way.]

Darien ignored him and continued to speak.

"So you're the same too. Come back and adapt to this place."

"I'm sorry, but I'm different from you."

Tae-san shook his head.

"I'm not like you, stuck at the bottom and unable to scratch the floor. If I'm going to fall, I'll die on the way down."

"...You."

Darien's face suddenly contorted. He shot back with a face wounded by his own pride.

"Okay, then prove it once."

"I'm thinking about it."

Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san entered the forest.

The colors around him were incredibly vibrant and filled his field of vision.

The moment he entered the forest, he realized that the air was different.

"What's this?"

Tae-san suddenly stopped breathing. Having assessed the quality and properties of the air, Tae-san was able to determine it.

"It's not poisonous... is it a hallucinogen?"

[Determination in progress... [Determination successful!]

The determination entered his thoughts, making him feel uneasy. Although it was successful without any problems, the determination continued to come in periodically.

Tae-san looked around the forest.

The forest was incredibly vibrant.

All the colors - orange, green, red, and purple - were mixed together and making his mind dizzy.

[Better be careful. The ones coming out of here are quite mischievous.]

Tae-san moved forward slowly.

And he realized.

"The forest is moving."

Tae-san turned around. The trees and bushes of the forest were moving slowly, blocking the path he had just passed.

When Tae-san looked, he hesitated for a moment before moving on to finish their task.

Tae-san walked forward with a wry smile.
Here is the translation of the text:

As I ventured deeper into the mountain, a corpse caught my eye.

But it was nothing more than a rotten, crumbling skeleton. I thought it might be the body of an adventurer who had gone too far, but the mountain just snickered.

"Whoever it is, they must be a stinker."

[Did you see it?]

"What, a corpse just starting to rot right in front of me? And in this labyrinth? Is that even possible?"

I didn't find any corpses as we descended into the labyrinth. It seemed that someone or something must be responsible for disposing of the bodies.

So, it was possible to assume that this skeleton was intentionally left here by someone.

And then, suddenly, the skeleton sprang to life. It swung its rough, bony hands wildly and charged towards me. I threw a punch at it.

Thud.

The skeleton collapsed and didn't move again.

At the same time, I heard a burst of laughter.

The laughter came from all around me.

It was a high-pitched laughter, like that of a child, but I could sense a deep, cruel intent within it.

As I felt the sudden chill of that intent, I froze in my tracks.

Gasp.
Here is the translation of the text:

The white light pierced through the tree and reached the place where Tai Shan was. Tai Shan quickly rushed to where the light was flying, but there was nothing there.

[He's done it.] [He's done it.]

A voice with a small smile echoed.

[Can I also escape?]

Kii-ing.

The light flew consecutively. Two on the left, one on the right, and two in front.

Tai Shan drew his sword.

[You have activated the "Flowing Water" technique.]

Kii-ing.

The light collided with the sword and moved. Then, Tai Shan twisted his body to avoid the light that couldn't be hit by the sword.

Gugu gugu gung.

The light pierced through the tree.

Tai Shan concentrated his mind.

But he felt nothing.

He was startled by the voice of a fairy.

[He's done it.]

"It's fun, isn't it."

Tai Shan muttered to himself.

The light just now was not Tai Shan, but a normal 51st floor adventurer. If it were him, it would be a life-threatening attack.

Iteyoun said that the difficulty level suddenly increases from the 51st floor, and the increase in difficulty is incomparable to anything that has come before.

A place where mysterious things live and try to kill outsiders.

This is the starting point of a new level.
