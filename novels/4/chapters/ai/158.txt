Chapter 159

159. 35th floor, Guide of Sin (1)

[It was fun to watch. Your battle.]

She sat down on the chair and smiled. It was a smile as if she were happy to see her own child grow up.

[Although it was unrelated to my battlefield, I was slightly disappointed, but I was satisfied enough.]

"It's fortunate."

She had fought in their territory, bearing the inconvenience, with the goal of getting that.

With a smile, Mahsin gazed at the Taesan and tilted his head.

"What are you talking about?"

[…….]

She slowly drew her body back and gazed at the Taesan, narrowing her eyes.

"What's this? Where did you get such a thing?"

She spoke in a puzzled tone.

"It feels like your soul is being directly intervened with. It's a powerful but dangerous ability. It's a strange thing. You can't easily get something like that.]

"Does Mahsin not know?"

Here is the translation of the text:

I am definitely a great god. I know a lot and can do a lot, but I am not all-knowing. Even if I am a god, I cannot know everything.

The goddess was murmuring to herself. The great god noticed what she was saying.

The forgotten goddess's domain.

What happened there was not even known to the gods themselves.

[But I'm not bad. It's dangerous, but... if you have that power, you can get stronger. Then my power will also become stronger.]

"What connection is there between my becoming stronger and the goddess becoming stronger?"

The great god is not the goddess's apostle. She doesn't believe in her.

Although there is no apparent connection, the goddess seemed to say that she was related to the great god.

The goddess dodged the question instead of answering.

[I'll explain why I'm here.]

"You said something before... ."

[The reason I'm here is one thing.]

The goddess cut off the great god's words.

It seemed that she didn't want to explain, so the great god also closed her mouth.

The goddess put on a mischievous expression and opened her mouth.

[You've become stronger.]

Her dark pupils sparkled.

[You've become too strong, haven't you. Faster and stronger than I expected.]

She said that with a ambiguous face.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's a good thing, but it's too fast. I thought you would gain this much power after a while. Even I, the Great Mountain, didn't expect the progress to be this rapid.

I won against the forgotten goddess's messenger, which was the greatest victory. After one battle, my level rose to 4, and I obtained the rewards of rising to a higher rank and defeating the demon.

So, I moved it forward a bit because it seemed unfair.

"What do you want to say?"

"When you enter the 35th floor, you will find the guides who are called the 4th-grade pathfinders waiting for you."

The Great Mountain realized the reason why the god descended.

It was a kind of balance patch. If the Great Mountain continued to grow stronger and reached the 40th floor, the 4th-grade pathfinders would be able to handle it without any problem.

So, I decide to fight against the pathfinders at a stage where it can still be a battle. That was the god's judgment.

The Great Mountain nodded.

"I understand."

It wasn't a bad thing for the Great Mountain either. The sooner they fight, the more they can gain.

The god smiled contentedly at the Great Mountain's fearless answer."
Here is the translation of the text:

[Okay, you've become that strong. And I hope you'll come to my side someday. There are also people waiting for you.]

The echoes of laughter that had been shared disappeared.

[Then, it's goodbye. I'll look forward to seeing you in a deeper place.]

“I'll see you next time.”

The Great Mountain had said goodbye with a smile.

The ghostly spirit, who had been silently watching, whispered to himself.

[It's the first time I've seen a spirit showing emotions to a human like that.]

“Perhaps so.”

The spirit had said that when they first met him. He didn't care about anything that wasn't his own, and didn't place value on humans.

It was a huge change, thinking about it.

As the spirit's aura completely dissipated, the Great Mountain moved. First, he searched for the secret room and dug a hole to collect the reward.

[The Robe of the Ancient King] [Defense +40] [A robe worn by a great king of the past, now only a relic remains. The magical processing for the king's protection is all that remains.]

It was just an average robe.

The Great Mountain was heading towards the boss this time. He drew his sword to face the black knight who was charging towards him, screaming in rage.

Clang!
Here is the translation of the text:

The journalist received the sword of Taesan, but due to the overwhelming difference in strength, he was knocked to the ground. Taesan picked up the sword again. The journalist hastily resisted, but it was already too late.

Creak.

Taesan's sword was wielded several times.

[You have caught the 34th floor boss. You have obtained the basic reward [Haturia's Ring]. You have also discovered the hidden element of the 34th floor and obtained the reward [???].]

It was a long-awaited floor-clearing reward. Taesan checked the ring.

[Haturia's Ring] [Strength + 100] [Magic + 10] [Attack Power + 15] [Defense + 15] [Vitality + 10] [Agility + 10] [Intelligence + 10] [The spirit of the great hero who once wore this ring during his mortal lifetime has left a lingering aura.]

It was a good ring that boosted all abilities. Taesan took off a golden ring that increased vitality by 20.

"It's about time I took off this ring."

This ring was given to him as a gift when he first met Ainthsahar.

The ring had many attachment points, so it took a long time to change them one by one, and he was still using it.

Although it's a gift taken away, I think he would understand.
Here is the translation of the text:

[He used a snake's waist belt hidden in the place.] [He obtained the snake's waist belt hidden in the place.] [The snake's waist belt hidden in the place] [Defense + 40] [Agility + 30] [He made a waist belt with the snake's leather after killing the snake that lived deep in the hole. The snake will remember its own death.]

"It's like explaining something to a person who's not even listening."

Tae-san muttered to himself while putting on the waist belt. Although the performance itself wasn't very good, the waist belt was a decent equipment since it was hard to get.

"Alright."

Tae-san took a deep breath and headed towards the 35th floor.

[Start of 35th floor quest.] [Defeat the boss of the 35th floor and pass through.] [Reward: a helmet filled with madness.] [Hidden reward: ?]

As Tae-san went down the stairs, the shopkeeper looked at him and said, "There are some things waiting outside."

"So I'll handle it."

"Yeah, it's annoying, so get rid of it quickly."

Tae-san passed by the shop.

Tae-san took out his sword and opened the door. There were over 10 people waiting for him.

* * *

The first thing I felt was pressure. The gazes and auras of the people made Tae-san's entire body feel oppressed.

"It's fine."

This level of adventurer would probably kneel down without resistance if they were 30 floors lower.

However, Tae-san was not threatened at all.
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan gazed at them expressionlessly, and the man in front of him let out a sigh. "Is this a true story?..." "Hello?" [You have activated scouting.] [Kazeart] [Level: 84] [Strength: 6213] [Equipped weapon: Sword, Magic]

Taesan's level was 4 levels higher than his.

However, his strength was only half of Taesan's level.

"Get out of the way."

A man with a wolf-like appearance emerged from behind them.

"I'll go first."

"...Arvan. That guy is strong. I understand your intentions, but we need to proceed according to plan."

"Shut up."

The man called Arvan let out a fierce roar.

"We've reached the 40th floor! But now we're asking an adventurer who has only reached the 35th floor to join forces with us? That's ridiculous!"

He roared like a beast, and his rough voice echoed through the room.

"I won't accept it!"

[Arvan activated the Red Winged Wolf.]

Arvan immediately charged at Taesan.

Like a beast, he pounced on the ground with his arms and legs, baring his fangs.

"You're quite fast."

Taesan moved his hand to grab Arvan's head.

(Note: The text appears to be a scene from a game or a fantasy story, and the translation is based on my understanding of the context and language used.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"It seemed like they had all mistakenly thought they had done something wrong, so calm and peaceful as drinking water, when suddenly they were all shocked."

"Ah, ah!"

Arbal suddenly stood up, his eyes wide with excitement, and waved his hands wildly. The wind howled and a fierce attack was launched.

But Taesan remained expressionless, blocking all the attacks.

"Is that it?"

Taesan drew his sword and struck Arbal's chest.

[Arbal took 1060 damage.]

"What's this?"

The onlookers were shocked.

It was a damage that exceeded their expectations.

Taesan didn't stop. He thought about quickly disposing of one of them, so he quickly grabbed Arbal's arm and slammed it to the ground.

"Hah!"

[Arbal activated his beast cry.]

A roar that shook Taesan's emotions enveloped him.

Taesan pushed Arbal's chest with his sword, his expression unchanging.

"Ah, ah..."

Arbal died like that.

[Your level has risen.] [Your aura has been activated.]

"First one."

Taesan muttered to himself and stood up.

Kazeart stared at Taesan with his eyes wide open.

"'Arbal died so easily?'"

Note: The text appears to be from a video game or a fantasy novel, and the characters and events are fictional.
Here is the translation of the text:

Arvan was strong. Even before entering the labyrinth, he was already a renowned warrior among the Red Wolf clan, known for his exceptional abilities. He proudly boasted of his strength.

After entering the labyrinth, he became even stronger, but such a strong Arvan died easily.

"......I'll do it according to plan."

"There won't be time to think leisurely about it."

Tai Shan smiled.

If he had decided to kill them, he could have done so immediately.

But he didn't, because there were more things to be gained by waiting for them to finish preparing.

'Just as I expected, I'm weak.'

For 40 layers, maybe even over 100 years, they would be stuck. The words of those who had lost their instincts for battle and their sense of tension were exactly like that.

"Try it once. What have you prepared?"

"We are strong."

Kazeart said. His words were not false. They all had powers that even the emperor of the outside world couldn't dare to confront.

"But you are stronger than us. We can't win even if we all rush in."

Kuuu!

The labyrinth is trembling.

A massive magical circle is drawn on the floor of the labyrinth. Kazeart's eyes glow red.

And the power that had been flowing from the guides of sin and gathered around Kazeart.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san could sense it.

This was a concentration of power.

"Oh, oh, oh..."

Cazeart couldn't help but let out a sigh and release his emotions.

Four powerful guides, imbued with the power of the 4th tier, appeared before him.

"Whew."

Cazeart took a deep breath and gathered his strength. The guides who had helped him gather his strength all collapsed, exhausted.

"Good."

Cazeart grasped his sword.

"Die!"

Cazeart charged forward.

The speed was unmatched, even by Arvan, and Tae-san was unable to follow it with his eyes. Tae-san quickly drew his sword.

Ka-kak!

The sword swept past. Cazeart, who had moved behind Tae-san, kicked his back.

Tak.

Tae-san swiftly turned around to block the attack.

Ka-kak!

Cazeart's sword clashed with Tae-san's sword. In the end, Tae-san was pushed back.

Tae-san landed on the ground, feeling the power he had sensed earlier.

"Strong."

[The opponent is a formidable foe.]

"You can't defeat me. I've received the power of all of them!"

Note: The text appears to be a scene from a fantasy novel or game, and the characters and terms used are likely specific to that context.
Here is the translation:

Kazeart's face was flushed with excitement as he spread his arms.

Inside the room, there were ten guides of sinful paths lying on the ground.

It seemed to be a way of delivering all his power to one person as the center of the magic circle.

In short, Kazeart's strength was higher than that of the apostle before his downfall.

"However."

That's all.

So, there wouldn't be a problem then.
