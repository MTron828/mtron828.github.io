Chapter 302

302. Skill Acceleration (2)

Tian Shan, who had opened the system window, laughed.

He had really obtained it. It was the skill he had failed to obtain in his previous life and had given up on.

He opened the skill window with a smile.

[SPECIAL ACTIVATION SKILL: Skill Acceleration] [Proficiency: 1%] [Mana Consumption: 100] [Accelerates the action speed of the next skill to be activated.]

A very simple explanation. It was easy to understand.

"This skill affects action speed, isn't it?"

In other words, it was applied to physical skills such as acceleration and jumping.

Since he had obtained a new skill, it was time to confirm its effects. Tian Shan delivered a finishing blow to the weak and worn-out shadow, and then set out to find a new monster. He drew his sword and aimed it at the shadow, taking a step forward.

[You have activated Skill Acceleration.] [You have accelerated.]

His body left a fleeting shadow.

Tian Shan's speed was so fast that it was hard to follow with the naked eye, and it was almost impossible to respond to.
The shadow could not keep up with its speed. The shadow, mimicking the power, could not respond properly and was thrust into the wall.

Kwaaaah!

The shadow writhed as it was thrust into the wall.

Taesan licked his lips.

"What is this?"

[...The speed literally doubled?]

The final speed, which included the basic speed and the additional speed due to acceleration, doubled. It was a mechanism similar to addition.

He checked other skills as well. Taesan kicked the shadow as it struggled to get up.

"You activated the skill Acceleration." "You activated the skill Leap."

Kwoong!

The leaping speed was incredibly fast.

At first glance, it seemed to be a speed that could be mistaken for teleportation. Taesan, who had moved above the shadow's head, aimed his foot downwards.

"You activated the skill Acceleration." "You activated the skill Landing."

Kwaaaah!

The speed of landing on the ground itself increased. The shadow was crushed as if a rock was falling on it.

"Hmm."

Taesan's eyes gleamed.

All skills related to actions such as leaping and landing could be applied.

"I wonder if this can be linked with the Ability Sword."
The effect of the Ability Sword transformed the leap and landing, which is the effect of lifting and slashing the enemy strongly. Taesan tested it himself. He leaped again and slashed the sword towards the shadow. The shadow tried to block the sword.

"You have activated Skill Acceleration." "You have activated Landing."

Thud.

The shadow's defense crumpled.

It was slammed into the ground with a loud noise. Taesan grinned as he sharpened his sword.

It was possible to link with the Ability Sword.

"Good."

The shadow seemed to have no more strength to fight, so Taesan dealt with it and went to find a new monster.

"You have activated Frost Arrow."

Using Skill Acceleration on Frost Arrow. But there was no significant change in the magic.

It only accelerates skills related to movement speed. In the case of magic, there is magic acceleration, so it seemed that it could only be used for that.

"I wonder if this will work too?"

Skills that affect the sword strike itself, such as strong strikes.

Since it was obtained through the Wind Rush, it should be usable. Taesan experimented and his expectations were correct. Skill Acceleration could also be activated for skills like strong strikes or counters.

Taesan continued to explore.
Using all the skills he had, he was able to determine the range of application of skill acceleration, and found that he could use it for most skills that involve physical movement.

He could instantly increase the speed of the ship. It could also be combined with the ability sword.

"Huh. What kind of skill is this?"

The ghost let out a hollow laugh.

The speed becomes that of a ship.

It was no exaggeration to say that it doubled the agility stat. At the same level, it was practically impossible to be an opponent for an adventurer.

The value of skill acceleration could not be expressed in words. Looking only at the advantages, it was a skill at the level of addition or absolute judgment.

"But it's not a skill without drawbacks."

"You have activated skill acceleration." "You have activated gale rush."

The body moves. The gale rush, accelerated to that of a ship, roughly sweeps through the shadows.

Kagagagak!

The shadows are overwhelmed without even putting up much resistance.

It was truly overwhelming, but Taesan's expression was not bright.

"It's impossible to control properly."

Stats are the assets that adventurers build up as they delve into the labyrinth. The increase in speed and strength from the rise in agility or strength stats allowed the adventurer to smoothly handle them as if they had possessed them from the beginning, without any difficulty.
However, it was not a skill acceleration. This skill instantly doubles the speed.

User control and the like did not work there.

Taesan could hardly control the movement of the skill acceleration and handling of the gusting wind.

Even in the part that was originally uncontrollable, only a very small part was controllable once it became amplified.

Other skills were the same. The momentarily increased speed made it impossible for the opponent to respond, but Taesan also found it difficult to adjust organically according to the situation.

If it were a different skill, it would be possible to control it by raising proficiency, but because skill acceleration literally doubles, it was difficult to control.

Moreover, the mana consumption was not insignificant at 100. It couldn't be used for every attack like addition or absolute judgment.

'However.'

It had outstanding performance to the point that such drawbacks were hidden.

In the previous life, it would have been a useless skill. The mana consumption was too high, and as it only accelerated weak stats, there was no significant change.

But now it's different.

This was a skill that was perfect for Taesan in his current mode.

"I'm looking forward to it."
It was time to use the skills properly against the guide.

But it didn't end there. The 17-day repetition also improved the proficiency of various skills.

[Special Activation Skill: Storm Rush] [Proficiency: 20%] [Mana Consumption: 100] [Rush with the sword like a storm. Can control the movement to some extent.]

There were no additional parts added, but there were deleted parts. It was the part about rushing straight ahead.

When I actually used it, unlike before, the storm rush did not end even when changing direction. It was a useful change that could be used in actual combat.

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Madness of Struggle] [Proficiency: 45%] [As you continue to struggle, your movements become faster and your strength increases. The speed of health and mana recovery increases. The effect disappears when the struggle ends.]

The madness of struggle had also surpassed 40% before I knew it. The added part was an increase in the speed of health and mana recovery. For someone like Taesan who had already obtained forced health theft, this kind of recovery skill could have a mutual increasing effect the more there were.
[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Perseverance] [Proficiency: 20%] [Efficiency increases significantly during repetitive tasks.]

Perseverance had also undergone changes, but there were not significant advantages. Originally, Perseverance was a skill that couldn't be activated in normal combat situations.

The skill that underwent the most significant change was undoubtedly Endurance.

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Endurance] [Proficiency: 100%] [Fatigue accumulates very slowly. The time to reach the limit of stamina vastly extends. Even under extreme conditions, movement can continue endlessly.]

Endurance.

When proficiency reaches 100%, the effect achieved is truly infinite combat capability.

Even under extreme conditions, movement can continue endlessly. With determination, one could engage in combat without rest for years.

Of course, it's not without its limits. Even though one can move despite physical exhaustion, muscles still wear out and fatigue accumulates. Movement in a state of exhaustion cannot be maintained indefinitely.

Nevertheless, considering all that, it was an excellent skill. It ensured there would never be a situation of incapacitation.

With a satisfied heart, Tae-san continued forward, organizing the shadows.
Here's the translation of the text:

---

Understand all the way to the secret room and clear the floors. Then, organize the rewards obtained.

[High-grade Attack Power Increase Potion] [Permanently increases attack power by 200.]

The potion that Belltenkia awarded as a reward on the 61st floor. I finally obtained it on the 66th floor.

The reward in the secret room was a bow. It required a lot of strength to use, much like a ballista, but its power was undeniable. With its exceptional range, I thought about keeping it without selling it, just in case.

And the secret reward.

[Whetstone of Razor's Edge] [A whetstone that can sharpen a sword's edge very sharply. However, a sword that is as sharp as extreme can also easily break. Unless handled by a skilled blacksmith and used by a skilled swordsman, it will be no better than a toy.]

An item used to increase the attack power of a sword. Come to think of it, there was a commission for equipment entrusted to Harfran. I planned to go up and check if it had been completed before reaching the depths.

67th floor. The latter half of the 60th floor is beginning.

--- 

This translation captures the essence of the original Korean text, describing a progression through different floors, acquiring rewards, and detailing the characteristics of the items obtained.
[Quest Started on 67th Floor] [Clear the maze of the 67th floor and defeat the boss.] [Reward: Potion of All Stats Increase.] [Secret Reward: ???]

The 67th floor was unusually ordinary. The monsters that appeared were knights with shields, and the structure of the floor was nothing special.

It seemed there would be nothing more to see once he delved deeper into this floor.

With a strange feeling, Taesan slowly progressed through the floor.

And when he reached about halfway through the floor, Taesan felt a strange sensation.

A feeling as if something were calling him.

He had felt this sensation a few times before.

Following this feeling, Taesan pressed against a brick that didn't seem to offer any resistance. The brick made a creaking sound and began to move inward.

Kwoong!

Space expanded, revealing a long passage.

[You have discovered the domain of the Forgotten Goddess.]

* * *

The Forgotten Goddess. Following Ambresha to the 70th floor, Taesan had used the information from Lee Tae-yeon to obtain a blessing.

And it was then that he acquired a special quest.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Special Quest: Forgotten Goddess] [To the creator of the labyrinth, to the gods, and to their followers, all prayed to the forgotten goddess statue. Awakened by your plea, the goddess long forgotten has awakened. She hopes you will rescue her.] [Those blessed by the goddess can feel the power of her statue hidden in the labyrinth.] [Find that place and pray to her.]

It had been a long time since it had come out, and even in the deep, there seemed to be one.

"What could it be this time?"

On the 70th floor, there was no disturbance at the forgotten goddess statue, but in the secret area sought for crafting materials, encountered traps filled with determination and the goddess's apostles.

[You activate reconnaissance.] [You activate essence perception.]

Countless information about the passage comes to mind.

[A place hidden with numerous traps.]

As a result, it was clear that there were only traps here.

Traps were no longer a threat to the mind. However, it was a trap guarding the statue of the goddess. An inexperienced adventurer could suffer significant damage in an instant.

The mind placed its foot into the passage. Then with a loud noise, the walls opened.

Crash!

The ceiling opens and the floor vanishes.

Beyond the expanded brick walls were countless explosives, arrows, and flames.

The mind speaks.

"Get lost."

[You activate the declaration of negation.]

Kugugugung!
The bombs explode before they even reach Mount Taesan. The arrows' trajectories waver as the flames retreat on their own.

Dozens of traps vanish with just a word.

Taesan nods quietly.

"As expected, quite useful."

A command obtained through an elevation in authority. While with the witch, he had grasped its proper usage and effects.

A command projects one's will onto the world. Against things like traps, which move strictly as designed, it wielded a power close to absolute.

The traps that had ensnared Taesan were certainly formidable. The bombs could shake mountains, the arrows possessed the force to cut through waves, and the flames had the power to dry up riverbeds.

Traps that even Taesan must seriously contend with.

Yet, there was no master of that power.

Thus, with a simple command, he could resolve it all.
