Chapter 389

389. The Sixth Return to Earth (6)

"...You! You! You!"

The hard mode player, who had just regained their composure, pointed at Tai Shan.

"What a crazy person! You're attacking us! Are you out of your mind?"

As the commotion died down, people began to appear, and the hard mode players, as well as the Indian gods Chandra and Sudra, who possessed certain powers, were watching them with interest.

"I told you. They wanted to become my people. You tried to kill my people. I just retaliated."

Tai Shan replied with a voice that seemed indifferent.

"It's war!"

The hard mode player growled, his eyes blazing with anger.

"It's war now! You dare to touch us! You won't get away with it!"

The hard mode players glared at Tai Shan with menacing gazes.

They drew out their weapons and aimed them at Tai Shan.

Tai Shan opened his mouth quietly.

"Really?"

"Of course! You're going to die here..."

The words were cut off.
Here is the translation of the text:

The faces of the hard mode players, who were all stern-faced, froze stiff.

"Uh, uhuh."

The only sound that could be heard was the forced silence, as if they were holding their breath.

"If you really want to fight me, I won't stop you, but it's better not to," said the person with a calm tone.

"Uhh... Ahh... "

The hard mode players were drooling like crazy. Their bodies had lost control to their minds. Some of them couldn't hold on and started crying, even.

"You guys are nothing."

The other person spoke calmly.

He wasn't showing off his physical strength or revealing his determination and crushing them. He was just blowing hot air, barely making a peep.

That was enough to make the hard mode players unable to resist and they were crawling on the ground, banging their heads against the ground.

"Ahh... "

The other person's aura was focused only on the hard mode players, so others didn't feel it properly, but it was clear that the person's aura was suppressing them.

"I don't plan to do anything with you. Your resistance to me, and your defeat by me, are all your own freedom."

Here is the translation of the text:

The pressure is mounting, and it's getting harder to breathe. Some people are so exhausted that they can't even take a breath, and their faces have turned pale. A few have even fainted.

Tae-san just stood there, unyielding.

"Huh?"

People start coughing and falling to the ground. The sound of gagging fills the air, and tears stream down their faces.

"Choose freely. It's up to you."

Tae-san spoke calmly.

No one replied.

* * *

After a collision with Tae-san.

Indian hard-mode players remained silent. They realized that it was pointless to resist Tae-san anymore.

Many Indian players witnessed the scene.

The rumor spread like wildfire, and within a day, all Indian players knew the truth.

Indian hard-mode players realized that they couldn't protect themselves.

Tae-san had crushed them all, showing that he had the power to protect himself.

People on the Indian team began to flee in droves.

So many people poured into the Korean team that it's impossible to count them. Korean players welcomed them without discrimination.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Come this way! There's food!"

"Oh, oh...!"

"Corn! There's corn!"

"And fruits?"

"There's endless food! You can eat to your heart's content!"

Those who were being discriminated against naturally didn't receive proper rations. However, Korea had a spare food supply. With fresh vegetables and fruits, they were incredibly happy.

When people heard the news, they started to escape at an even faster pace.

A hard-core player who couldn't stand it pulled out his weapon.

"I'll kill them all!"

Although he had absolute power and strength, he couldn't even make a move against the giant mountain. He couldn't accept this reality. He wanted to take revenge on the giant mountain, even if it meant he would die.

So he decided to kill those who wanted to escape with the giant mountain. The giant mountain would try to stop him, but he planned to kill as many people as possible before that.

It was the moment when he was about to bring down his sword on the screaming people.
Here is the translation of the text:

On a dry sky, a black lightning bolt struck. The lightning bolt that precisely hit him did not have any effect on the surrounding area. He burned to death, black as coal, and fell to the ground.

"Oooh...!"

He punishes those who defy him.

It was like a divine retribution.

No one could escape from then on.

At some point, more than half of the people entered the world below the Great Mountain.

It was a group that had only physical strength, with no sense of justice or morality.

However, there were still people who had not gone yet. Some people doubted the power of the Great Mountain or believed that the Great Mountain would discriminate against them even more.

And then the next wave began.

[Woah...!]

Monsters are going crazy. Indian hardcore players who resisted were broken and scattered like toys.

The ones who could not stop the monsters ran away in despair. Naturally, the players who were behind, including the normal mode players, were exposed to the monsters.

[Oooh!]

"Kyaah...!"

"Save the people!"

It was the moment when the monsters were about to crush the people.

[The Great Mountain activated the Frozen World.] [The Great Mountain activated its magical concentration.]

Zzzt...!
Here is the translation of the text:

The coldness descended upon the world. Monsters that tried to trample people were frozen in place.

"Ah, ah?"

The mountain came crashing down. People stared blankly at it.

Everything in front was frozen. Not a single monster remained, buried in ice.

The monsters that had to be fought, perhaps even the ones they couldn't defeat, were taken care of with a single blow.

And so, the wave ended, and the remaining people began to escape.

In the end, only hard-mode players remained in the land. The descent into the mountain had been going on for a long time.

"......What to do?"

They gathered to hold a meeting.

There was no answer to this situation. Their power, after all, was only meaningful if there was someone below them. Without anyone to acknowledge them, a noble was no longer a noble.

A few hard-mode players from the land abandoned everything and entered the mountain.

However, most of them couldn't even make the decision to enter the mountain.

They were nobles. Absolute rulers. Whatever they desired was fulfilled.
Here is the translation of the text:

If they went down to the depths of Tai Shan, they would have to give up everything they had. They never thought of doing that.

They made a decision. They would show their strength in the next wave.

Tai Shan also couldn't ignore the level of power they had, so they decided to do whatever it took to change people's perspectives and maintain their power.

As the conclusion was reached, there was no longer any conflict.

The situation was thus stabilized.

The people who went down to Tai Shan were able to blend in without any major difficulties. They lived among people, listened to Tai Shan's stories, and gradually began to trust and believe in Tai Shan.

However, they did not worship Tai Shan.

Of course, it was natural. Worship was not something easily achieved.

Originally, they were Hindu believers who believed in non-existent gods.

They strongly felt a sense of rejection towards humans worshiping humans. They trusted Tai Shan, but didn't worship them.

In order to make them worship Tai Shan, what should they do?

It wasn't difficult. They believed in a myth that didn't exist.

So, it would be enough to directly show the power that could be expected from a myth.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Special Quest Start] [The Final Wave has begun.] [Waiting begins: one week.] [Please handle the monster approaching.] [Rewards will be distributed differently depending on the results when returning to the dungeon.]

The Final Wave.

People breathed a sigh of relief, thinking it was over.

However, Tae-san's thoughts were different.

"You're too weak."

So far, only a few A-grade monsters had appeared. He thought that around two S-grade monsters would appear, but none were visible.

Go-shin was pouring all his energy into this final wave.

Tae-san prepared quietly for the moment when the monster would appear.

As time passed, the day of the wave arrived. People lined up, tense-faced, and waited.

Boom!

The space was torn apart. It was enormous in size.

[Wooo!]

Unbelievable monsters appeared.

It was literally filling the horizon with a massive quantity.

[Monster 44 appeared.] [Monster 92 appeared.] [Monster 421 appeared.]

...

Among them were also two-digit monsters. It was the moment when people gritted their teeth and prepared for battle.

Kwak-kwak.

"......eh?"

A startled voice rang out.

The monsters didn't rush towards the people.
Here is the translation of the text:

They began to rush towards the small, black spherical object that was between them.

Quququ.

The creatures that touched the object began to disintegrate and were sucked into it. However, the creatures did not stop. Even the three-digit and two-digit creatures were all being absorbed into the object.

At some point, the number of creatures that filled the horizon was remarkably reduced.

And accordingly, the object was gradually growing larger. The object that was originally as small as a grain of rice was now as big as a person.

It was clear that the creatures were disappearing on their own, but no one was rejoicing.

A primal sense of unease overwhelmed them.

Quququ.

The last creature was swallowed, and the object shook.

The distorted and shaking object became a creature that was impossible to recognize.

Kkuleuk.

It landed on the ground. The Tai Shan scowled.

"This is a bit of a problem."

[!#$!# appeared.]

"...... Eh?"

Indian hard mode players froze in their posture, ready to rush towards the object.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the wave began and the monsters appeared, they were all rushing towards the monsters together, intending to release their strength at once and show off their power in a single moment.

Although they would soon be exposed to the monsters, they were all confident that they could survive because they were all hardcore players.

However, this was a mistake.

They couldn't feel any strength when they were taken in by the unknown form that was unlike the monsters.

However, they could sense that it was dangerous. They realized instinctively that they had reached a dimension that they couldn't feel, and that it was not just a ordinary thing.

"Run, run......"

Just as they were about to turn back to the people, the monster looked at them.

"Uh."

The moment their gaze met, their faces froze.

Their faces turned pale, their legs went limp, and blood flowed from their eyes and nose.

"Ugh......"

"Human soul......"

The Indian hardcore players fell to the ground, unable to get up again.

And then, someone's face turned stiff and they realized that something was strange. Lee Taeyeon shook her body.

"What, what is this? That thing."

An instinctive sense of rejection was felt.
Here is the translation of the text:

Deep within her, something was screaming, a fear and dread she had never experienced before.

"Ah......"

Tae-san looked at that Taeyeon with a glance. It was not an incomprehensible reaction.

"Is something left behind even if time goes back?"

An unidentifiable monster.

Tae-san had seen this monster in his past life.

This monster was the messenger of a high-ranking official who had killed Tae-san and Taeyeon.

"Did you send it down yourself?"

Tae-san revealed this. It seemed like he couldn't bear it, and a joyful smile spread across his face.

The monster looked at them.

[The gaze of #!#$!#.] [You will die.]

The gaze covered the people.

The people's breathing stopped. Their souls wanted to leave their bodies.

This was the gaze of death. No one except Tae-san could resist its absolute will.

The moment when Tae-san was about to spread his divine power to block it.

The powerful presence surrounded the people. The gaze of death was erased.

"Ah, Ah-ha!"

"This is......"

"Ah?"

Taeyeon's eyes widened.

Tae-san opened his mouth.

"Are you already summoned?"

[It's a situation where it's possible right now, you know.]
Here is the translation:

"Along with a carefree voice, God appears in a form."

"[The God of Choice. Maria descends to the earth.]"
