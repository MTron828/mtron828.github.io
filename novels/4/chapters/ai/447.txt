Chapter 448

448. Levienov

"Does the divine power fall if the divine realm is lost?"

"Not everyone is like that. Those who have reached the pinnacle of power through their own strength, like Rakiratas and Maria, won't lose their high-level power even if they lose their divine realm. But I was a local god who received people's faith."

It was the world that maintained her divinity and divine power. But now, she had lost her world.

"Originally, I should have disappeared from there. But because of Ainzhart's faith, I was able to hold on."

Levienov looked at Ainzhart with a soft face.

"Thank you. Ainzhart."

"I just did what I had to do. Goddess."

"There's no need to call me a goddess anymore. I'm no longer a god."

"No."

Ainzhart denied it.

He spoke with an unwavering face.

"Levienov is my goddess. That one thing will never change."

"......Is that so. Thank you."

Levienov no longer denied it.

And Akasha was quietly watching the two of them.

[…….]

Through her connection with Taesan, Akasha's emotions were palpable. It was a complex feeling filled with longing and confusion.

Akasha was praying in front of the forgotten goddess's statue.

She too could have had a relationship with Ainzhaar and Lebinaev that was not so different.

"It's not thanks to me, Lebinaev-nim. It was Taesan who saved you."

"That's right. I'm really grateful, Taesan."

Lebinaev said with a joyful face.

"Even though I lost everything and fell to the level of a mortal... I'm still alive. That's enough. It's all thanks to you."

"I just did what I was supposed to do."

Taesan said calmly. He had received a quest, accepted it, and cleared it.

That was all there was to it for him. Lebinaev smiled faintly.

"Then I should give you a reward fitting for what you've done."

Lebinaev held out his hand. A energy began to gather on the palm of his white hand.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'm no longer a god. I want to give you a blessing, but I don't even have the power to do that. All I have left is a fragment from back then."

Kiiiiing!

It was a platinum-colored fragment with a shape like a forced grip on iron.

The power I felt within it was beyond the understanding of the great mountain.

"It may be useless to me now, but... you might be able to do something with it. Please take it."

The platinum fragment moved onto the great mountain's hand. The great mountain grasped the fragment.

[You have obtained a divine fragment.] [Divine Fragment] [A fragment of the divine power that a being who can no longer be called a god possesses.]

"......This is."

"I also don't know what I can do with this."

Levinehoff spoke softly.

"But you have an incredibly special power. You purified my corruption and can intervene with the laws. Maybe you can handle it somehow?"

"Thank you."

The great mountain grasped the divine fragment.

The divine power. Although it was just a fragment, it was more valuable than divine blood. As the current great mountain, I had no idea how to handle this material.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But it was a very precious material that couldn't be found anywhere. I had to find a way to use it, but it was a sufficient reward.

"If you're satisfied, that's great."

"Then it's my turn now."

Ainzhaar stepped forward, grinning from ear to ear as he patted Taesan's shoulder.

"I'll say it again, but I'm really grateful. Thanks to you, I was able to achieve my dream. So, I have to give you a sufficient reward. First of all... I've collected treasures from around the world."

[You have obtained 300,000G.]

Thirty thousand gold.

Even now that I've reached the depths, it's not a small amount of gold.

And Ainzhaar began to take off the armor he was wearing.

"I was wondering what to give you, but this is the only thing that comes to mind that you'll be satisfied with. Take it. It's the armor that I've worn all my life, blessed by Lord Levienov himself."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have obtained the armor of Ainzhar, blessed by Lebinef.]
[Lebinef's blessing, Ainzhar's armor.]
[Attack power +1000]
[Defense power +1000]
[This armor was carefully crafted by the goddess herself for her beloved servant. Although the goddess's power has largely faded, the servant wore it for a long time, and some of that power remains.]
[The attack power increased by 10% with the Airak martial skill.]

Taesan was amazed.

An attack power of 1,000 was impressive, but the special effect was the real deal.

An additional 10% increase in attack power with the Airak martial skill.

It was equivalent to saying that the attack power would increase by 10%. It was a kind of graduation equipment that could be used until the labyrinth was cleared.

"Are you satisfied?"

"Yes, I am."

"Good, I'm glad. Since you've saved the goddess, I've been wondering what I should do. I'm relieved that you're satisfied."

Ainzhar smiled and asked,

"Then, are you planning to head down to the lower levels?"

"No, I have to return due to the call of the gods. I have a little time left."

A few days of leisure had been gained. It wasn't enough to head down to the lower levels. Ainzhar drew his sword.

"Then, until then, what do you say?"

Taesan nodded readily. He drew his sword as well.

* * *

Taesan spent the remaining time on earth engaging in a duel with Ainzhar.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Now, even if Ainzhart attacked with all his might, I could withstand it. The gap still existed, but it wasn't that big.

As the battle continued, Taesan shared various stories.

"It seems like you've become a hero. You've become a sword."

[He asked quickly, as if he had forgotten.]

"Sorry about that. I was too focused on our conversation to pay attention."

Ainzhart gave a strange glance to Bardley, who had become a sword.

"......Were you born as a sword? Are you satisfied?"

[Is that so?]

"That's enough. As long as I'm alive, the day will come when my wishes will come true. Don't give up, okay?" [I guess so.]

The ghost replied in an ambiguous tone. He had given up on everything. There was nothing left to wish for.

And Akasha also had something to ask Levinov.

[Oh goddess.]

Akasha asked quietly.

[Do you not know about me, Lord Levinov?]

"You are......"

Levinov, who was looking at Akasha, narrowed her eyes. After a moment, she shook her head.

"I apologize. I don't know."

[Is that so......]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The energy I sense from you is definitely familiar, as if you were a being like me... but I don't know anything beyond that."

Even Levienov, who was a transcendent being, didn't know about the god that Akasha believed in.

Unless Akasha herself remembered, there was no way to know about the goddess.

So they continued to fight for several days.

And finally, it came to an end.

"Is it time to go back already?"

"There's still a little time left, but there's one last thing to do. I think it'll be enough by now."

"That's unfortunate."

"You're my benefactor. Feel free to come visit anytime."

"What do you plan to do now?"

Ainzhaar had made a contract for Levienov's sake.

But now, he had achieved his own wish.

"I don't know. I'm not sure."

"Let's meet with the wizard of the labyrinth and have a talk. I should also go thank Metis. After that... I'll have to think about it."

"Even if you say you're retired now, Levienov-nim is definitely a god. The wizard will also give you preferential treatment."

Taesan told them, like Diana and Verdenia, about coming to Earth.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But Ainzharn had an ambiguous face.

"I have received a great favor from you. It's a favor that cannot be repaid. I also don't have a mind to take revenge on the gods. But... for now, I want to stay by Lord Levienov's side."

"Is that so."

Taesan didn't say anything more.

Ainzharn had achieved his lifelong wish.

If he wanted peace, Taesan had no right to stop him.

"But revenge... it's a tempting word. I'll think about it after I've found stability and my mind is at peace."

"That's enough."

Taesan bid farewell to them and headed towards the 61st floor.

There, Beldechka and Diana were chatting quietly.

"Are you back? What's going on?"

"What about Rilish?"

"She said she was tired and went to sleep."

Taesan told them.

"I'll be returning to Earth soon."

The atmosphere changed. From a very peaceful face, it suddenly turned into the face of an adventurer who had gone through countless battles.

"It's about time, isn't it? How much time is left?"

"About a day?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is it today? Do we need to prepare something?"

"If there is, then there is."

Taesan thought for a moment and asked.

"Can we use a magic circle for space movement?"

"It depends on the type. Is it long-distance or short-distance? Is it for many or few? Or is it for a specific target or an unspecified number? What do you need?"

"All of them."

"Hmm."

Veldekiya stroked his chin.

"There are a few things that come to mind. I'll prepare them."

"Thank you."

Taesan bid farewell to them and headed down to the 87th floor.

As usual, the shop owner was there.

"Are you going down?"

"No."

Taesan shook his head and approached the shop owner.

"I'm thinking of buying some equipment."

"Ah."

The shop owner raised the corner of his mouth.

"Have you saved up enough?"

"Yes, plenty."

Taesan currently had around 1.5 million gold. It was the total amount of gold he had obtained while descending from the labyrinth. The shop owner opened up a space.

"Alright. With your current abilities, I can show you almost anything."

Rattle rattle!

A multitude of equipment poured out.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan, who was about to glance at the equipment, burst out laughing as soon as he saw the prices.

[2,000,000G] [1,800,000G]

Even Taesan, who had collected gold up to the 87th floor, couldn't afford some of the equipment.

"What's going on?"

"It's worth the price, considering its performance."

Taesan carefully examined the equipment.

[Extremely compressed Mithril sword] [Attack power +4000] [A sword made by compressing all the Mithril in the world to its limits. Its weight is so heavy that no one can wield it properly.] [The user is penalized for the weight.] [1,700,000G] [Necklace made from the remnants of a god] [Health +10%] [Mana +10%] [Strength +4%] [Agility +4%] [Intelligence +4%] [Attack power +1000] [Gods are essentially immortal, but they too can't avoid the end of their existence. This necklace was made from the remnants of a god at the end of their existence.] [1,800,000G]

Just looking at the simple stats, they increase by several thousand, and the percentages also rise by over 10%.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The equipment they had was not as good as Bardray's and Akasha's, but the ones below that level were decent. There were dozens of them like that.

'Amazing.'

Taesan continued to look around at the equipment.

As he did, a familiar piece of equipment caught his eye.

It was the Mookbit's Wrist Protector.

[Mookbit's Wrist Protector] [A wrist protector made with a dull, colorless light. The power contained within protects the user.] [Reduces all incoming damage by 50%.] [2,000,000G] [……What is this?]

Bardray let out a shocked gasp.

Two million gold.

This was the most expensive equipment here.

Its performance was beyond understanding.

It reduces incoming damage by half?

And Taesan had seen this equipment before.

It was the one that Lee Tae-yeon was wearing.

Taesan realized.

The equipment here was the graduation equipment from the labyrinth."
