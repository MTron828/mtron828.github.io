Chapter 315

315. The Fifth Return, Earth (11)

Ka-a-a-ang!

I dodged the monster's attack and struck back with my sword. The monster let out a loud roar and swung its arms wildly.

The monster was faster and stronger than Taesan. It was impossible to perfectly dodge its attacks.

But that didn't matter.

My depleted health was restored in an instant, accompanied by a golden glow.

Taesan put strength into his legs and unleashed a dual-sword attack. The monster was pushed back slightly with the impact.

[Dealt 3631 damage to the twisted, lifeless creature.] [Oo-o-o-o!]

The monster let out a scream.

It moved its entire body wildly, flailing its arms in all directions. Taesan, who had created some distance, began to gather his mana.

The divine power restored his mana and magic.

With no need to worry about consuming mana and magic, he could now use methods he couldn't before.

[You have activated the Frozen World.]

A severe cold swept in. The monster let out a roar. The cold air was shattered and dispersed by the power contained in the roar.

[You have activated the Frozen World.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan unleashes magic once again.

[You have activated the frozen world.]

He casts magic, and casts it again, and again, and again, activating the frozen world over a hundred times in an instant.

The entire fallen heaven and earth freeze over.

Even the monsters that were initially immune to the cold cannot withstand the extreme cold and are pushed back.

The frozen world is an intermediate-level magic. Even Taesan's magic would deplete his mana instantly if used like this.

Taesan summons divine power.

The depleted mana is restored once again.

Frost spreads, and light explodes. A dark wave crashes down on the monsters, and roots burst forth. Dark threads pierce the earth, carving wounds on the monsters' entire bodies.

Mana and magic are depleted in an instant, only to surge back up again.

[You have activated the distorted ecosystem of Dekaravia.]

A path leading to the demon realm opens.

All magic is poured out, and the demon's roots are brought down to the earth.

Kukukukuku!

The roots pierce through the world, penetrating the earth and reaching the high heavens.

It was more like a single tower than roots.

Note: Dekaravia is likely a proper noun, possibly a location or realm, and has been left untranslated.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A monster that had been pierced through the root let out a loud roar. Then, it destroyed the root and pressed on, advancing forward.

The remnants of the root exploded in all directions, but they were all erased by Beatrice's barrier.

"How disgusting, yet so sturdy."

Taesan, who had been silent, once again drew out his mana.

"Oooo!"

And he was watching the people's reactions.

Darkness, light, and coldness rushed in, and at the same time, a bright golden light exploded, filling the field of vision.

The people's faith grew deeper. Beatrice also looked at the scene with great interest.

[Is this the divine power that mortals can wield?]

The Spirit God is the god of spirits. It's not a being that has completed its divinity through faith, but rather a being that has had divinity from the beginning. Therefore, the sight of mortals receiving people's faith and wielding divinity was also quite interesting to the Spirit God.

[But this is not all.]

He knew about the power that Taesan possessed.

[Show me. What only you have.]

* * *

Kagakag!

He swung his sword, shaking off the distance, and Taesan looked at the monster with an unchanged expression.

[The proficiency of divine power increased by 1%.]

Along with the proficiency window, his senses changed.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Let's avoid the whirling attack and check the skill window. The proficiency of the divine power has reached 80%."

"Wow, it's fast."

"I thought it would take until the next return to reach it, but it's already 80%."

"The changed sensation told Taesan how to handle the divine power.

Taesan grasped the divine power. A golden light spread from his entire body, burning everything around him like the sun.

[Oh oh oh!]

The monster's entire body was engulfed in flames. Its reaction was more intense than any reaction it had shown before.

[Dealt 1631 damage to the twisted, lifeless creature.] [Dealt 2251 damage to the twisted, lifeless creature.] [Dealt 1978 damage to the twisted, lifeless creature.]

The reaction was not fake, and significant damage was being dealt. The monster, writhing in pain, charged at Taesan. Taesan dodged the monster's attack and swung his divine power.

Chiik!

The monster that was touched by the golden light showed an intense reaction.

Divine power is the power of the gods. And the monster is a being that has received the power of the false gods.

The opposing powers burned the monster's body."

Note: "고신" (go-shin) is a term that can be translated to "false gods" or "pseudo-gods", implying that the monster's power is not from the true gods, but from a false or corrupted source.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Is it possible to use divine power not only for recovery but also for attacks?]

"Similar. It's not just that."

As I became able to handle divine power more diversely and intricately, it became easier to deal with monsters.

However, the monster still didn't show any signs of falling.

The monster's entire body was burning, but its movements didn't slow down at all.

"It's not impossible to pierce."

The divine power that continued to rise was simultaneously trying to devour the mountain.

It was as if it was saying, "You, a mortal, are not allowed to go beyond this point," and was slowly devouring the mountain's ego.

It was powerful, but there were clear limitations. I had to end it before the divine power completely devoured him.

Then.

The mountain focused its power.

It gathered the power of the divine. A thick, deep darkness that could devour everything began to flow out of the mountain.

[Oooo…….]

The monster, which was about to charge with a loud cry, stopped in its tracks.

Even a monster that had lost its reason was momentarily filled with fear by the power contained in the blackness.

At the same time, the mountain pulled in the divine power."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Until now, I could only use the power that mixed sacred and black energies in a limited way.

In reality, the boundary that was close to self-destruction was a double-edged sword that even Taesan could not handle.

But now, Taesan has become able to wield the sacred power more properly.

The sacred power wraps around the black energy that has been unleashed. The mixed power transforms into a grayish color and is about to explode.

Taesan pulls the sacred power even stronger.

The sacred power is consumed and refilled repeatedly.

A golden light overlaps, emitting a blinding light that's hard to keep one's eyes open.

The grayish color that seems to explode at any moment is overwhelmed by the powerful sacred energy and is contained within the sword.

The sword, which has received an unbearable power, screams in agony.

Damn it.

Taesan takes a step forward. The monster that sees this late screams and charges towards him.

Taesan's sword moves.

A diagonal line cuts through the sky, and the monster's entire body is torn apart.

[Dealing damage to the twisted, non-living thing.] [Oh, ohohoh!]

A painful scream erupts. Taesan grips his sword tightly and charges again.

"Wow... what is that...?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Minerva let out a divine cry. Taesan was handling an extremely unusual power as if it were his own limbs.

[That's it.]

Beatrice analyzed the power that Taesan had wielded.

[Divine.]

The power of God. A power that exists within the laws.

[And black.]

The power of the abyss. A power that exists beyond the laws.

The two powers were mixed together to create something new. Even Beatrice, who had existed since the early days, had never seen that grayish light, which contained a power that could destroy boundaries.

[Amazing.]

While Beatrice let out a quiet cheer, Taesan continued to wield the grayish light.

Thud.

Every time the grayish light hit, the monster let out a painful cry.

Kwaaaang!

He struck down with his sword. The monster's arm was cut off.

S-class. A monster with strength rivaling a single digit, but it couldn't even put up a decent resistance and was being trampled.

The grayish light that Taesan was wielding now contained that kind of power.

However, Taesan's expression wasn't bright either.

"This is..."

He was continuously consuming divine power to contain the grayish light in his sword.

But even with that much divine power, the grayish light continued to fluctuate.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Like a flame that burns everything, it devours the divine power and grows in size.

As the battle drags on, the gray light that has lost control will go berserk.

And when that time comes, whether it's gray or divine, it will devour the power of the mountain.

But it will end before that. The mountain has taken a stance. Once again, the gray power strikes the monster with great force.

[Oh, oh, oh!]

The monster rises. It shakes its entire body violently and tries to crush the mountain with its arms.

The mountain wields its sword. It's different from before. Although the monster has overwhelming power compared to the mountain, it bounces back the moment it clashes with the sword.

This monster is one that doesn't even have the concept of defense. From the moment the gray power is infused into the mountain's sword, the monster can do nothing.

[Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!]

A loud shout erupts.

The power inside the monster surges, and it begins to transform once again.

Now, it has grown to be as large as a small mountain,

[Oh, oh.]

With a scream-like sound, the monster raises its arm.

[Oh, oh.]

The twisted arm contains the monster's full power.

Note: The translation tries to maintain the original tone and style of the text, but some nuances may be lost in translation.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Evading is impossible. The giant, who was wrapped in Beatrice's domain, was about to crush everything.

Then, he tried to push it down with force.

Taesan stomped his foot. His arm was pushed down. Taesan didn't dodge. He held his sword and thrust it deep into the giant's arm.

Quadruple shock.

A massive pressure crushed Taesan.

[You took 213,024 damage.] [Your last chance has been activated.]

A last chance to block the fatal damage that leads to death.

Taesan released the divine power contained in the sword that was stuck deep in the giant's arm. The suppressed gray energy found an exit and started to explode.

The exploding gray energy distorted the space itself.

Taesan just held his sword straight.

"Aaagh!"

People covered their ears and stumbled back. The explosive power of the gray energy clashed with Beatrice's unfolded screen. The transcendent screen created by the transcendent being itself began to shake violently and crack.

Beatrice exerted her power. The cracked screen returned to its original form.

The explosive power trapped inside slowly began to subside.

When people barely managed to look up, half of the monster had disappeared.

The ghost was shocked."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What kind of power is this...?"

"If I had made a mistake, I would have gotten caught up in this too."

It was fortunate that Beatrice had unfolded the barrier to block it, or else the people who had barely survived would have lost their lives in vain.

A system window announcing victory appeared.

[Your spiritual power has increased. The proficiency of your twisted spiritual tuning has risen by 5%.] [Your spiritual power has increased. You have acquired the special passive skill [Life Devouring].] [The special passive skill [Life Devouring] has changed due to the increase in spiritual power. You have learned the special passive skill [Seed of Life].] [The proficiency of Black has increased by 1%.] [The proficiency of??? has increased by 3%.] [The proficiency of Boundary has increased by #@!#@!%.]

Taesan gazed at the Heaven-Defying Sword, which had turned gray.

The sword's blade was cracked and twisted.

The equipment from the labyrinth, which had never been damaged or broken before, was now broken to the point where it couldn't be used anymore.

"I need to change my sword."

Taesan, who had sheathed his sword, landed on the ground. He felt many gazes fixed on him, staring blankly.

"Oh, oh oh!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They started to shout the name they had been referencing.

They revered Taesan, and his name began to echo.

Their faith gathered, as if it was pressing down on Taesan.

[The proficiency of Divine Power increased by 1%.]

* * *

People shouted Taesan's name with all their might. There were many who shed tears and bowed their heads.

"Ta, Mr. Taesan..."

Kim Hwi-yeon murmured with a dazed expression. Even she, who didn't worship Taesan, had a hint of reverence in her expression.

[This is interesting.]

Beatrice murmured towards Taesan.

[I wonder why the gods showed you favor. It's intriguing.]

His eyes sparkled with curiosity.

However, he prioritized his tasks over satisfying his curiosity about Taesan.

[I need to do what I must do before satisfying my curiosity. You won. This is your reward.] [Divine Power is unleashed.] [Blessings are bestowed.] [You have obtained the blessing of Harmony with Nature.]

The blessing spread to everyone. Those who had been shouting Taesan's name were taken aback by the sudden surge of power.

"What's going on?"

"What is this?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"People are looking at their own bodies, feeling a new sensation that has suddenly emerged.

[And this is the reward you deserve for achieving this feat.]

The blessing of the gods has been bestowed upon all humans.

The power of the gods begins to descend, exclusive to Taesan.

[You have acquired the special passive skill [Direct Contract].] [You have acquired the special passive skill [Blessing of the Spirit God].] [You have obtained the Evolution Stone imbued with the power of nature.]

"Huh?"

The first to notice the change was Minerva. She opened her eyes wide and looked around her body.

"Father?"

[The rest is for you to check directly. It was quite enjoyable.]

With a voice filled with laughter, the Spirit God disappeared from sight.

At the same time, a system window appeared, signaling the end.

[Special Quest Complete.] [Rewards will be distributed differently based on your achievements during the quest.] [You will return to the labyrinth in one day.]
