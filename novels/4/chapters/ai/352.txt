**Chapter 353**

353. 74th Floor, the Battlefield of the Immortals (6)

"There's something I want to ask before that."

Taesan scowled.

"Why did you start recovering your powers even though I didn't return?"

The Transcendents were too hasty. After Taesan returned to the labyrinth, they only needed to recover their powers, and there wouldn't be any problem.

However, they recovered their powers before Taesan even returned to the labyrinth, creating an opening for Goshin to intervene.

If they had made a mistake, Taesan could have died. Balbambara spoke in an ambiguous tone.

[Regarding that, it's unfair. To correct myself, it wasn't multiple Transcendents who recovered Balhaluni's power. It was one Transcendent. And he was a Transcendent who didn't have a foothold in the labyrinth.]

"......Is that so."

Taesan realized.

Although he received the attention and favor of many Transcendents, that was only a story from the Transcendents who had directly met and tested him. There was no way a Transcendent outside the labyrinth would be interested in Taesan.

To such a Transcendent, Taesan was just a mortal, and whether he lived or died was of no concern.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There are also transcendents outside who don't think highly of the labyrinth. From their perspective, it's only natural that a talented individual who could become their slave would flow into the labyrinth.

"I know that."

Even the transcendents we met on the gods' battlefield showed hostility towards the labyrinth. So, it wasn't strange that they would dislike Taesan, who was favored by the labyrinth's transcendents.

"It seemed like the labyrinth's transcendents were going to intervene, but the high gods got in the way and blocked them, so I had to apologize on their behalf instead."

"Alright."

That's understandable. Balbam continued speaking.

"But because of this incident, the gods outside the labyrinth will also take an interest in you. At the very least, your existence will be etched into their minds."

The system window of the Immortal's relics appeared, stating that the gods outside the labyrinth had taken an interest in him.

"Whether that's good luck or bad luck, I don't know. It's beyond my domain. But I'll pray for good luck."

Then, it was time for rewards again.

Balbam asked Taesan,

"You've solved the problem that's been a thorn in the side of transcendents for a long time."

"The 74th floor was a quest created under the gods' request."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even the gods had to borrow the power of mortals to restrain their own divine power.

Completing such a quest without any issues was undoubtedly an outstanding achievement.

[It seems like I'll need a weapon first.]

The black boundary line, which was close to immortality, could not withstand and broke. Balbambara gathered its strength.

[Balbambara activated #000451.] [You obtained the sword created by the labyrinth's mage.] [Sword created by the labyrinth's mage] [Attack power +750] [A sword created by the labyrinth's mage during the design process. Although it was not made seriously, it contains an enormous power within.] [The mage made it as a hobby. It should be useful for you as well.]

Balbambara gathered its strength again.

[It will also provide the materials for the wrist guard.]

Balbambara summoned a gray earth. The quiet wrist guard suddenly came to life and engulfed it.

Clank.

With a pleasant cry, the wrist guard returned once again."

Note: Balbambara seems to be a character or entity in the story, and #000451 appears to be some kind of code or activation phrase. The labyrinth's mage is likely a powerful figure who created the sword and wrist guard.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[World-Changing Wrist Guard.] [A wrist guard created by a witch who directly infused her power into it. With specific conditions and catalysts, it can alter the laws of the world around the equipment, granting it immense power.] [Attack +600] [Defense +500] [If you've learned the green witch's magic, you can use [Partial World Change].]

Attack power increased by 100, and defense power increased by 100. The wrist guard was a clear advantage that could be used until the labyrinth was cleared.

[And then there was that ring.]

Babalamb's gaze fell upon the black and white ring on Taesan's finger.

"[You've reached the limit. This is a light service. I'll break through for you.]"

Babalamb's power enveloped the black and white ring. With a loud "clink" sound, the power contained within the ring surged violently.

The ferocity contained within the black ring decreased, as if it had accepted Taesan.

"[A majestic, dark-colored ring] [Attack +1,250] [A ring created by combining the dragon's claw and the spirit king's flame. It's simply powerful. The great energies of each clashed to form a single ego. The ego is not pure, but violent and recognizes only its twin and its master, rejecting all else. Those who can perfectly tame it will gain another power.]"

"Whoa."

Attack power increased by 250.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was a content that didn't recognize anything other than twins, but the owner was included in it.

[With elegance and mystery mixed, it's dyed in pure white.] [It uses its own spirit and divinity to resonate with the user and assist them. It can also store many powers and use them when needed. It can slightly assist with black powers as well.] [A ring created by mixing the light of the origin and the source of the apostle. The great powers collided and became one. The self is pure and has dignity. It also accepts other things excluding twins. Those who perfectly tame this will gain another power.]

A sentence was added to the white ring, saying it can slightly assist with black powers. Since black powers are a force that needs to be dealt with continuously, it was a useful change.

[Is this all about the equipment? Are you satisfied?]

"Enough."

Taesan nodded his head. Just looking at the attack power, it had increased by 600. This alone was a sufficient reward.

But it didn't end here.

[What you've done is even more amazing. Just wait a moment.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!

The bricks that made up Barbalbam's body collided. It seemed like something was sending a signal.

[It was confirmed.]

A moment later, Barbalbam opened its mouth.

[It was confirmed by the gods of magic and magic. Since you did a favor for the Transcender, I will give you magic and dark magic accordingly.]

It was unexpected to obtain magic and dark magic through Barbalbam.

The power of magic and mana flowed from Barbalbam to Taesan.

[You have obtained the intermediate magic [Concentrated Detection].] [You have obtained the intermediate dark magic [Storm of Unseen Thoughts].] [The reward for the 74th floor is finally over. Farewell.]

With that, Barbalbam's body collapsed.

Taesan checked the magic he had obtained.

[Intermediate Magic: Concentrated Detection] [Proficiency: 1%] [Mana Consumption: 500] [Allows you to concentrate on a specific area and detect it. Can mostly penetrate detection interference and also understand secrets and seals.]

"Detection magic. Not bad."

Since the depth required a wide range of information, the power of detection was extremely important. Since he hadn't obtained perfect reconnaissance yet, the intermediate detection magic would be useful.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**Mid-level Dark Magic: Storm Arrow of Bisago** **Mana Consumption: 700** **Basic Mana Consumption: 200** **Proficiency: 1%** **Summons an arrow containing the storm of Bisago. The intense storm concentrates on a single arrow, piercing and destroying everything in its path. The arrow that pierces the end of the world is extremely powerful.**

"Is this the dark magic version of the Starlight Arrow?"

**You have activated the Storm Arrow of Bisago.**

The storm arrow is summoned.

Taesan shot the arrow straight at the wall of the labyrinth, without leaving any aftermath. The arrow collided with the wall.

**This is a concentration of power.**

All the magic was concentrated on a single arrow. Although the range of power is very narrow, the power concentrated on a single arrow is immense.

It's similar to the Starlight Arrow, but there's a clear difference. It seems to have its own unique uses.

The reward for the 74th floor has ended with this.

However, the confirmation of the reward is not over yet. While defeating the Undying's remnants, Taesan has obtained many things.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Special Activation Skill: Immortal's Arch-nemesis] [Proficiency: 1%] [When facing an immortal, raises one's strength and power to a level that can rival the immortal. However, one must bear the burden of the damage inflicted.]

Just looking at the description, it seemed like an incredibly good skill. It raises one's strength and power to a level that can rival an immortal. It meant that even now, I could somewhat rival a complete immortal.

'But.'

There was a condition that one must bear the burden of the damage inflicted.

I had to directly withstand the mental blow that could crush my spirit just by facing it.

"I guess I can't use it recklessly."

However, the effect itself seemed to have tremendous value, making it worth researching.

[Title: One Who Achieved the Unachievable] [You have achieved what no one else has.] [HP + 3,000] [MP + 1,000] [Strength + 500] [Agility + 500] [Intelligence + 500] [Attack Power + 300] [The unachievable achievement raises one's strength.]

The overall stats were usable, but the biggest gain was the increase in strength written at the end.

In future battles, strength was incredibly important. In a way, it was much more important than simple stats."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The reward that raises your rank, even if only slightly, has a significant meaning, considering that it's not something that can be obtained with a simple victory.

"'It's not that your rank doesn't go up just because you're on the boundary,' the system window said after I defeated the Immortal's Remains. Your rank is on the boundary, but it doesn't mean it won't increase.

"It's reasonable to think that simply increasing your rank won't allow you to surpass mortality.

"Finding a way to do so will likely become my next goal.

"I obtained divine power after defeating the Heavenly Angel, and I got the twisted spiritual tuning after defeating the three-digit monster.

"I got the transcendental skill, Black, after defeating the High Priest's Slave, Hasak.

"And now, after defeating the Immortal's Remains, I've obtained a spiritual skill that raises my spiritual rank.

"What I obtained is a spiritual skill. King of Machinery.

[Spiritual Skill: King of Machinery] [Proficiency: 1%] [The king of machinery, with the power of their rulers. However, the user's rank and power are still too lacking to wield this power.] [This is...].

"The ghost let out a sigh. Taesan also quietly examined the skill."

Note: There may be some nuances or cultural references that don't translate perfectly, but I've done my best to provide an accurate and natural-sounding translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even though Taesan acquired the Soul Skill, nothing significant had changed.

He hadn't obtained any new powers, and his strength or abilities hadn't increased either.

There was only one meaning.

As described in the skill's explanation, Taesan hadn't reached the level where he could wield this skill.

That's why the skill wasn't showing any effects.

And if Taesan couldn't handle it at his current level, there was only one possibility.

The Immortal.

A power that only those who had transcended mortality could possess, a unique authority that belonged to oneself.

The increase in spiritual power had brought that authority as well.

'I had somewhat expected it since I obtained the black color.'

The ghost let out a sigh of relief. Now, he could be certain.

Taesan's Soul Skill, Spiritual Power Increase.

The authority contained within was above that of the Immortal's authority."
