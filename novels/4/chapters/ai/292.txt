**Chapter 293**

**293. The Iron Wall that Protects the World, Shaman (1)**

Clang.

The knight takes a step forward, sword in hand, exuding a fierce aura.

[Are we going to fight right away? Can't we talk a bit first?]

"There's nothing to talk about with you, Hero."

The tone was blunt, refusing to engage in conversation, but the ghost seemed to be enjoying it.

[This guy, is he angry?]

The shaman pauses at the ghost's words.

[I understand the reason. Honestly, are you frustrated? Why did you have to come up here and face this guy? Do you think you've become that weak?]

"Shut up."

The shaman's voice was laced with irritation.

In retrospect, it was understandable. The shaman was a deep-layer adventurer. He must have had pride in himself for having reached the deep layers.

But he had to climb up to the 64th floor labyrinth to face an adventurer.

Leaving aside the other members of the headquarters, it was him who had to do it.

The shaman, who had pride in his own strength, was enraged.
Here is the translation of the text:

However, Shaman's emotions, which had been dwelling on Tai Shan, gradually subsided. He pointed at Tai Shan with his sword, seemingly uninterested.

"It's just frustration, but that's not the important thing."

To be honest, when he first met Tai Shan, he thought he had been deliberately belittled. He was angry.

The opponent was Tai Shan. She didn't want to engage in a life-or-death battle, nor did she want to fight an unfair one-sided battle without a chance of winning.

In other words, Tai Shan had chosen him as an opponent who could somehow win, and Tai Shan thought he was the weakest among the leaders, according to his own judgment.

"I am a seasoned adventurer who has ventured deep."

Hmph. I feel strong.

Many skill windows appear and disappear in front of Shaman.

Shaman looks at Tai Shan with his calmed eyes.

"I know you won against the sword and shield, but those two did not venture deep on their own strength. Show me the power of the depths here."

Therefore, Tai Shan decides to kill him to prove his strength again.

Shaman's determination spread like wildfire.

[The opponent is an enemy who cannot be defeated.]

"Well, then."

Tai Shan also responds.

He activates many buff skills and points at the opponent with his finger.
Here is the translation of the text:

"You've triggered a forced fall."

"Uh."

The shaman was in a daze, and after a moment of self-reflection, he adjusted his stance.

"You have skills that are out of this world."

"You've triggered Sadoha [Darkness and Chaos] and the King's Vessel."

The power of the mountain was expanding and amplifying.

"Let's go, our enemy."

The shaman drew his sword.

"You and I. Which one of us is stronger? Let's prove it."

The mountain's footsteps were steady.

As the mountain charged towards him, the shaman swung his arm.

The great sword spun around.

It was a light, wrist-level attack, but the power contained in the great sword was immense. The single blow knocked the mountain down.

"Hah!"

The swords clashed. A huge shockwave hit the wall.

The shaman felt the weight of the sword and laughed mockingly.

"I'm strong."

At this moment, he was no different from Taeyoon in terms of strength. Although it was an unfair comparison, it meant that he was on the same level as an adventurer who had cleared the labyrinth.

However, the shaman did not seem to have any problem blocking the mountain's attack.

It was not just a difference in stats.
Here is the translation of the text:

Equipment of the depths. And with the power of auxiliary skills, he was colliding with the sword.

And Shaman felt a power that he could sense as a Shaman.

The difference in stats between the adventurer who reached the depths and those who did not was extremely large. When colliding with the sword, the latter would be stuck to the ground and unable to chase after speed.

However, Tai San was overwhelming him with strength and speed.

He had a skill that increased his own stats by a certain ratio when his opponent's stats were higher than his own, which he had obtained from the depths.

However, he was still being pushed back by Tai San in their battle.

"Can't be careless, I suppose."

With a quiet voice, Shaman shook his hand. The great sword tore through everything like a storm and charged towards Tai San.

"Monster!"

Tai San swung his rough hands. He drew the sword, swiped it, and sent it flying.

"It's a monster."

[This battle was not expected, but this kind of opponent was unexpected.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Minerva's tongue is bitten. Barkaja is trembling and releasing his strength. The light emerges, and a storm is summoned by Minerva's gesture.

The shaman, who is pressing the Taesan, turned his gaze.

"Are you the king of the wind?"

Minerva is the king of the wind. Even if she is an adventurer of the utmost depth, she cannot be ignored.

However, the shaman responded very lightly. By adjusting the trajectory of his sword just a little, he split Minerva and Barkaja's strength.

"What?"

Minerva's eyes wavered as she saw her strength being split.

Kaka!

The shaman ignored Minerva and continued to press the Taesan.

"Haha, haha."

Minerva's face was filled with anger as she was completely ignored.

"Well, I'll stop this! Barkaja!"

[As the king's will.]

Barkaja's fundamental nature is a supporting type of spirit. Barkaja claps his hands. Minerva summons her strength. The light beam and wind are amplified, and a storm that can blow away the entire forest is implemented in a narrow labyrinth.

Can this be ignored? The shaman stepped back, and the storm violently rushed towards him.
Here is the translation of the text:

The energy wave was so powerful that even Taesan couldn't ignore it. If such energy was unleashed against him, he would likely struggle to defend himself.

However, Shaman drew his sword.

He charged towards the storm, swinging his sword downwards. The storm dissipated with a loud noise.

"What's going on?"

"You're a newly born spirit king, aren't you?"

Shaman shook his sword to dispel the shock, then spoke.

"I've fought against spirit kings like you and tens of thousands, tens of millions of times."

The leaders were stuck in the depths. The time was so long that it was impossible to count.

They made all-out efforts to break through the depths.

Among these efforts, there was also a mutual struggle.

They fought each other, analyzing each other's strength and pulling themselves up.

For Shaman, Minerva was extremely weak. He could crush her with such a powerful energy no matter how strong she was.

"Kuung!"

Shaman's foot landed.

He arrived in front of Taesan in no time and swung his sword downwards. Taesan responded with a snarl.

"Kaka!"

A spark flew out. Taesan's face contorted under the intense pressure.

"Stronger."

Despite the stats being in his favor, the battle was still evenly matched.
Here is the translation of the text:

Purely from the experience aspect, Shamani was superior because of that. Taesan has also gone through many battles, but Shamani has been training with the top leaders of the guidance group for an indeterminable amount of time that is hard to grasp. From a simple experience perspective, Taesan couldn't catch up.

Minerva and Barcaga are working hard to assist, but it's of no use.

And finally, Barcaga made a decision after thinking that he couldn't get any help.

After all, I am a spirit. There is no death, and even if I fall here, I will only be revived.

Barcaga rushes towards Shamani. It's unexpected that Shamani's face slightly trembles, as if he didn't expect Barcaga to attack him directly.

Even if weak, I am a top-grade spirit. It's not at all ignorable.

Barcaga approaches Shamani and applauds.

The light beam wildly oscillates.

Crushing everything around and aiming at Shamani.

And Shamani responds to all the attacks.

Shamani swings the greatsword around, blocking the light beam and piercing Barcaga's body.

[A loud crash!]
Here is the translation of the text:

Barkaja withstood the shock and released a burst of light. His body was transformed and the world around him was frozen in an instant. Even Shaman was forced to shut his eyes due to the overwhelming light.

Although it was a very small gap, it was a clear gap.

[You have activated acceleration.]

The Taesan charged forward rapidly, aiming his sword at Shaman's waist.

Kaang!

[Shaman's shield has been activated.] [Shaman's fortification has been activated.] [Shaman's immortal shield has been activated.] [Shaman's unyielding armor has been activated.] [Shaman took no damage.]

Boom!

Shaman struck his sword down as if he had been waiting for it.

[You have randomly blinked.]

Taesan's body moved backward. Shaman let out a hiss.

"It's a pity."

Shaman had deliberately allowed the attack and confirmed that his opponent would be shocked and take advantage of the gap. However, due to Barkaja's sacrifice and Taesan's quick response, no significant outcome was achieved, and only information leaked out.

Shaman adjusted his posture calmly.

"I'll use magic too. I've heard that I'm skilled in dark magic, but I'm using various powers."

Taesan stared at Shaman with a blank expression.
Here is the translation of the text:

His current attack power was around 4000. Even without additional attack power-boosting skills, he attacked the enemy's weakness and dealt damage ranging from 5000 to 6000.

However, the damage was 0.

This meant that the enemy in front of him had a defense power higher than Taeyeon's.

Even with a few defense-piercing skills, no damage was dealt, implying that he also had skills that reduced damage to its absolute value.

"'It's getting ridiculous.'"

"'I'm the guide of the wicked ways. Among adventurers, I boast the absolute defense. Die, our enemy.'"

* * *

Kuung!

Shaman rushed forward.

Unlike before, he ignored defense this time. Since he knew he wouldn't take any damage, he wouldn't be held back.

Kuuuung!

Taesan focused on defense. Minerba helped by summoning the wind, but even that was blocked.

[Shaman's Spirit Ignore ability was activated.] [Shaman took 0 damage.]

"What's this?"

Minerba laughed mockingly. The damage was not even registered. Shaman's attack was blocked, and Taesan looked at him with a calm expression.

Shaman's eyes were dull.

His face, which was excitedly agitated from being completely overwhelmed by Taesan, was completely expressionless.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It can't be helped, I guess."

Tai-san made a decision. He started to charge forward with a fierce expression.

Suddenly, Tai-san's momentum changed, and Shaman responded immediately. They clashed their swords at a distance where their arms touched.

Ka-kaga-kaga!

There were dozens of collisions in a single second. The swords clashed fiercely, and Tai-san suddenly twisted his body to attack Shaman's sword.

[Your first attack has been nullified.]

Shaman's physical body returned.

Tai-san stomped his foot, and the air burst out. He gripped his double-edged sword with both hands.

Shaman responded immediately, striking down with his sword to push Tai-san back.

[You have activated "Sweat".]

"Ah."

Shaman's sword's trajectory was deflected. His stance collapsed.

For the first time, his eyes wavered.

Tai-san did not miss the opportunity.

[You have activated "Transformation".] [You have activated "Addition".] [You have activated "Fierce Sword".]

He poured all his strength into one sword.

Shaman realized that the power Tai-san's sword now contained was enough to break through his defenses.
Here is the translation of the text:

Shaman raises the corners of her mouth and activates her skills.

[She has activated the blessing on the target.]

Killing.

A golden barrier surrounds Shaman.

An extremely firm and absolute barrier that even those who have reached the brink of death cannot easily penetrate.

[Shaman has activated the re-establishment.]

And Shaman's stance changes.

As if time was rewinding, her stance, which was about to collapse, transforms into a perfect counterattack stance.

"All attacks are invalid. It's unique and difficult to respond to, but if you know it, there won't be a problem."

Shaman mutters.

Tae-san had fought against Ambrosia before. At that time, she had possessed the absolute invalidation of attacks, which was known to them.

A powerful card that erases attacks and turns back time. It was natural for Tae-san to use it in battle.

Therefore, they decided to aim for it.

After invalidating the attack, they prepared to receive the fatal blow. And their plan succeeded. Shaman stepped forward and swung her sword. A fatal blow that splits mountains and pierces the sky is heading towards Tae-san.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Shaman has triggered a transformation.] [Shaman has triggered the blade of determination.]

Gurgle, a skill to enhance attack power has been triggered.

The sword reaches Taesan.

Shaman has won with certainty.

[Your second attack has been absolutely nullified.]

"What?"

Shaman's body has reverted to its pre-attack state.

He looks at the system window that has appeared in front of him and is shocked.

"'Second!'

Is it possible that you have two skills of that level? Taesan's twin blades are charging towards him. Shaman is quickly flustered.

"'It doesn't matter.'"

He is now receiving the blessing that he has spread out. It is an absolute defense that is difficult to penetrate, even if the leaders of the guidance and the entire organization attack. It's not possible to penetrate with this level of power.

[You have triggered an absolute judgment.]

And his confidence is shattered.

The golden blessing that has touched Taesan's sword is shattered. Before Shaman can even do anything, the sword pierces his armor.

"Koek!"

He cries out in pain and flies away roughly.

Kwa-a-a!

[Shaman took 52154 damage.]

Although the damage is considerable, Taesan's face is not satisfied.

"'As expected, it's troublesome.'"
Here is the translation of the text:

The opponent was not careless even without taking damage.

Knowing that they had been decided as the opponent of the great mountain, they thought that the great mountain's chances of winning were slightly higher, and therefore, they did not show any weakness.

The absolute judgment is a trump card. When using it for the first time, it was necessary to reduce the opponent's vitality to the maximum.

Now that they knew the existence of the absolute judgment, they would not allow the opponent to attack.

Originally, they should have increased their attack power and used it, but they couldn't. The opponent's response was too fast.

Additionally, two attacks were invalidated. It was a gain, but it was not satisfactory.

The great mountain rushed towards Shaman, who had just fallen. However, Shaman took out a gem from his pocket.

Ka-ching!

The gem shattered, and the space expanded.

[Shaman activated the forced space expansion of the Amoral. This item lasts for 10 seconds.]

The space expanded momentarily.

The visible distance remained the same, but no matter how much they moved, they couldn't get closer to Shaman.

"What's going on?"

Shaman stumbled to his feet, despite receiving the arrogant damage.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Shaman received an attack that exceeded his entire physical strength. The skill "Unyielding One" was activated. His physical strength was reduced to one and he survived. The cooldown time for this skill is one year.]

He let out a dry laugh.

The skill "Unyielding One" only activates when he receives an attack that exceeds his entire physical strength.

He had not been able to use this skill even once since obtaining it, but it suddenly activated now.

"That's it, I guess... I need to change my strategy."

Shaman activated a one-time recovery skill, recovering half of his physical strength.

Shaman calmly assessed the situation and drew his sword. His quick thinking and reaction left Tai Shan speechless. He had often taken advantage of the opponent's surprise and inability to respond properly due to the unfamiliar skill, but this time it seemed impossible.

"Alright, you're adventurers too, I suppose."

The opponent was different from any guide he had met before.

A man who refused to give up. A man who was moving forward.

A man who had only used his own abilities to overcome the deepest depths.

He never relaxed and never boasted. He predicted and responded to everything.

"Let's try."

They showed off their cards to each other.

Now it's the real deal.

Tai Shan strengthened his hand holding the sword.
