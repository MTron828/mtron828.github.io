Chapter 193

193. 41st floor. The Great Spirit Chaser (2)

"What are you?"

The man who saw the Taishan mountain shouted, his face filled with anger.

"Do you need water? Or shall we take the adventurous path?"

Next, his face was filled with laughter. His face, filled with joy, soon changed to sadness.

Various emotions passed across the man's face. The ghost who was watching opened its mouth.

"It's been a while. Valencia."

With a melancholy voice, Valencia, the man, spoke.

"Are you dead?"

"You're not here, are you?"

"I'm sorry. I couldn't fulfill your wishes, but I believed that even if it was difficult, you would be able to reach the end of the labyrinth."

"What a lot of things have happened. Are you still the same?"

"I haven't achieved it yet."

A madness gleamed on Valencia's face.

"So, I am here."

"Really, you think it's possible? Your wish?"

"There's no impossible thing. I've seen results, no matter how small."

A confidence filled Valencia's face.
Here is the translation of the text:

When Taesan thought that Valencia's expression was changing dramatically, Valencia's gaze suddenly turned towards Taesan.

"What do you seek in the labyrinth?"

A bitter smile spread across Valencia's face.

"No, it's not that. I've come to find the key to conquering this place. Just like all those who have come to me before."

Taesan could sense exhaustion in Valencia's gaze.

"Can you really fulfill my expectations? No, you're just like the others, passing by without a care."

Valencia spoke gloomily.

"Existences here are mental entities. To kill them, you need a special skill. Go to the room on the far right and purify your anger. Bring back the core, and I'll give you the skill."

[Sub-quest started.] [The madman who pursues great spirits. Valencia wants something from you. Even if it doesn't fulfill his expectations, he will reward you accordingly.] [Conditions: Core of Anger.] [Reward: A skill that allows you to attack mental bodies.]
Here is the translation of the text:

It was a quest similar to one that had driven a demon mad. Taesan nodded his head.

[Sub-quest accepted.]

"Then go. I don't expect much, but let's try it out."

Valencia wrinkled his face with annoyance and snapped his hand.

Taesan left him.

"What do you want?"

The demon who had gone mad had a clear goal of taking revenge on the spirit king who had created him. Rilis had a goal of learning magic.

However, he couldn't find that from Valencia.

From him, all that was visible was madness.

The ghost replied.

[I am a being that pursues the spirit of a being that has transcended mortality. I came to the labyrinth by making a contract with a magician.]

The spirit of a being that has transcended mortality.

Taesan's face contorted as he thought about this.

"Do you want to artificially achieve that? Is that possible?"

Immortal or transcendent beings.

Their power was the ability to destroy stars and create life. To become such a being artificially was absolutely impossible in Taesan's opinion.

The ghost corrected Taesan's words.
Here is the translation of the text:

[It's not their power, but their spirit. I want to have an unyielding, eternal spirit that is all my own.]

"It's the same, isn't it?"

[That's right. It's impossible. But I believe I can achieve it. So I've entered this labyrinth. It's almost like being trapped by Relic.]

The ghost spat.

[Valencia has no talent to escape mortality. But he wants to become a great existence more than anyone else. If he can't have their power, then he'll take their spirit. So he's absorbed thousands of emotions. And this is the result.]

"Am I also unable to control my emotions?"

[Yes. I'm pursuing perfection, but I'm only getting worse. So I'm still stuck here. Even those who are already greatly flawed can make pacts with magicians, but this guy is exceptional.]

The Great Mountain listened to the ghost's words and broke through the room. The intermediate spirits that were stirred by the emotions of anger didn't have any effect on him.

And then the Great Mountain arrived at the room that Valencia had spoken of.

[He found a treasure chest filled with resentment.]

In the center of the room, a small pillar was floating in the air.
Here is the translation of the text:

And there was a terrifying emotion lingering, one that Taesan could sense.

Taesan had already told Iteyan what that was.

It was the pillar that touched the essence of human emotions.

Iteyan had touched the pillar to pass the 40th floor and was then consumed by a sense of anger.

The numerous posts she left on the community at the time were almost like her black history.

[Let's see.]

Taesan placed his hand on the pillar.

At the same time, the emotions overwhelmed Taesan.

The sensation was like the moment a monster suddenly appeared on earth and was thrown into chaos.

The feeling of having to watch people around you die.

The feeling of being unable to resist the cruel treatment of the hard mode, feeling powerless and fragile.

And the feeling of being the only one left alive.

All those emotions rose up, as if they had just occurred, and solidified into a tangible reality that surrounded Taesan.

"Hmm."

Taesan put his hand on the pillar with a firm grip.

The emotion dissipated like a bursting balloon.

"It's a little different, I suppose."

Taesan muttered to himself without any emotional response. It was a mental trial, a fresh experience.
Here is the translation of the text:

From Taesan, emotions burst forth, and a pillar began to form a nucleus.

In the nucleus shining with a white light, not a single speck could be found.

[You have obtained pure anger.] [It's easy to pass by.]

Even ghosts couldn't easily pass by here. They couldn't restrain their boiling anger and had to control their emotions for two whole days.

On the other hand, Taesan was not affected by any emotional influence.

As it was expected, the ghost said calmly.

[Now I'll go back.]

Taesan ground the nucleus and then went back to Valencia.

Upon his prompt return, Valencia was taken aback.

"Already here?"

He had expected it would take at least a week. The time needed to control emotions was that long, so Valencia's face turned pale with surprise.

"...I've given up. Are you going to tell me a strategy or something?"
(Note: The text appears to be a scene from a novel or a comic, with a supernatural element and a sense of tension and emotion.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"I couldn't dare to touch the pillar without knowing its identity and returned to ask for a solution. It was a familiar situation, so Valencia thought it was just like that with Taesan too.

"'It's over. I can only do this much for you.'"

"'Is that enough?'"

Taesan revealed his white core.

Valencia, who had been speaking nervously, stopped in his tracks.

Valencia, who had been staring blankly at the white core, trembled.

"'Okay, just for a moment. Let me see.'"

Taesan had revealed the core because he was supposed to. Valencia hastily took the core and held it tightly.

"'Pure emotions? Is that so?'"

He muttered to himself. He seemed to be in shock, and after a long time, he clenched his hand around the core.

Snap!

The core broke.

And the energy contained within it swallowed Valencia.

"'Oooh...''"

His eyes shone brightly. A huge emotion was overwhelming him, to the point where it was visible from the outside.

After a while, he calmed down and took a deep breath. His eyes were filled with an unavoidable excitement.

With great effort, he composed himself and turned his gaze away.

"'What's this? How did you get this?'"

"'What's that?'"

Note: The original text appears to be a scene from a novel or a story, and the translation is based on my understanding of the context and the characters' actions.
Here is the translation of the text:

"...a core filled only with unbridled anger, without any other emotion. Many adventurers have come and gone, but none have been able to take this core with them, nor have they been able to touch it..."

"I don't know. I just took it, that's all."

Valencia's eyes seemed to be shaken by Tai Shan's response.

Then he laughed.

His laughter was filled with excitement.

"If you're the one, it's possible."

"What is it?"

"It's to make me great."

His eyes gleamed with greed.

"Take this."

Valencia threw a single key.

[Emotional Key] [The key Valencia received when he made a contract. When he truly desires something, this key is given to someone else.]

"Go to the 42nd floor, to the room at the left end. There will be a locked door. If you use the key there, you'll find a pillar, just like before. Touch the pillar and take the core."

[Sub-quest starts] [Valencia is impressed by your pure emotion and is willing to hand over his key. Follow your desires for each floor's emotions, and come back with each core.] [Condition: Each core.] [Reward: Great Spirit.]

A ghost who had been watching quietly spoke.
Here is the translation of the text:

"So this is how it's connected, huh? Back then, I was disappointed and only got one skill thrown at me."

"You brought me something worthless, so what's the point?"

Valencia revealed this with a smile.

"It's not bad compared to others, but it's not up to my standards. But this one is different. This one has reached my standards."

"Is that all?"

The ghost let out a faint smile.

Valencia gazed at Mount Tai with eyes that were aglow with excitement.

"Are you going to refuse?"

The refusal seemed to imply that he would only be able to swallow the bitter pill. Mount Tai nodded his head.

"I'll take it."

Regardless of what happened, it was a quest, and clearing the quest would reward us with something. There was no reason to refuse.

Valencia's eyes sparkled with joy.

"Good, very good. Then, let me take this first."

[I obtained the special skill [Coordinated Mind and Body].]

"Return to me every time you clear a layer and take control of the core. Then, I'll tell you the next destination."

Mount Tai agreed and left.

As we walked through the corridor, the ghost whispered to himself.
Here is the translation:

It's good to be cautious. Most people trapped in a labyrinth are friendly to adventurers, but there are also those who are not. There are also those who can do anything to achieve their own desires.

Taesan broke through the labyrinth.

When I swung the sword at the mental body I had never been able to touch before, it suddenly split apart with a terrible sound.

[Only anger was left in the mind, 1987 damage.]

For the first time, a valid attack became possible. It was thanks to the skill Valencia gave me at the end.

[Special permanent activation skill: Unison of Mind and Body] [With the unison of mind and body, you can attack even opponents that only exist mentally.]

Taesan continued on.

The mental bodies that appeared continued to provoke Taesan's mind, but he didn't feel anything.

[It's not like this can be easily overcome.]

As a ghost who had struggled with the floor's tactics, I felt a strange sensation. Taesan asked, "Is it like this from the 41st to the 50th floor?"

[The theme of the upper layers is already set. It's okay to see it like that.]

"Then I'll be done quickly."

In reality, it was like a sandbag. It seemed that I could pass through the 50th floor without any resistance, as if it were a test by God.
But the ghost denied the idea that was in Taesan's mind.

[It's going to be difficult. Maybe it will take even longer than 30 floors. It could be that long.]

"What's going on?"

[If it's there, it's there. If it's not, it's not. But if I ignore it, I can ignore it completely... I think it will be difficult, you know.]

It was a vague statement. Taesan was trying to figure out what the ghost was saying, but the ghost changed the subject.

[I can't say more. As someone who is not an adventurer, I can only intervene up to a certain limit. You'll understand when you see it for yourself.]

At least, it seemed like nothing was happening.

So, they just kept moving forward.

Taesan continued to advance.

And he was able to conquer the 41st floor much faster than any of the floors he had passed before.
