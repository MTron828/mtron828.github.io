7. 1st Floor (2)

[Itaeyeon [Alone]: Mr. Taesan. How do you deal with the Big Rat?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: Predict its movements by observing its muscles and then strike.] [Itaeyeon [Alone]: You mean react to what you see?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: No. I mean predict.] [Itaeyeon [Alone]: ...How do you observe the muscles of a mouse?]

* * *

*Squeak!*

The Big Rat shouted in threat. Taesan calmly watches the Big Rat.

There is no reaction.

But the Big Rat is a creature that breathes and moves using its muscles. Anyone can observe the body's movements when it tries to do something.

Suddenly, the Big Rat's legs contract. Its chest, which had been rising and falling, swells.

Now is the time.

Taesan swings his sword.

Clang!

*Squeak!*

The charging Big Rat reflexively retreats.

It's about the concept of prediction.

Any creature shows signs when it's about to attack. If you observe closely, it's not so difficult to block it in advance.
Here is the translation of the text:

Professional boxers don't dodge punches by looking at fists, but rather by anticipating shoulder movements.

While the opponent is not human but a rodent, the principle remains the same.

So, from here on.

Taesan extended his arm without lifting his sword.

The Big Rat hesitates and tries to charge again.

But it is once again blocked by Taesan's attack.

"Squeak, squeak."

[The Big Rat feels intimidated by you.] [Its judgment is clouded.]

Even in its tiny red eyes, Taesan notices a hesitation. Right now, its ankles are the only place it can't attack again.

Then, he'll aim for the second easiest place to attack.

The forearm was extended so invitingly.

The decision was quick.

The Big Rat charges. It leaps to bite the forearm.

"Squeak?"

Confusion shows in the Big Rat's eyes. The sensation from the bite is strange. It feels like biting something hard, not flesh.

It tries to retreat belatedly, but the Big Rat's body hangs in mid-air. Its swift movement is sealed off.

"You're finished."

Taesan slams the Big Rat's bitten forearm into the ground.

Thunk!

"Squeak!"
Here is the translation of the text:

The Big Rat shrieks as it's pinned down on its forearm. It struggles to escape, but the difference in basic strength is significant.

Taesan does not miss and stabs his sword into the rat's chest. An unpleasant sensation travels through his hand.

"[Your attack.] [The Big Rat is incapacitated. The damage is greater.] [4 damage to the Big Rat.] [5 damage to the Big Rat.]"

......

"Kki-eek...."

Life fades from its red eyes.

"Hoo!"

As the Big Rat's movement ceases, Taesan finally relaxes his strength.

"Quite challenging."

A rat, a monster that human reflexes can barely match.

But Taesan calmly assessed.

He had won.

Now was the time to reap the rewards.

"[You have defeated the Big Rat.] [Received a large amount of experience points.] [Health has been restored by 5.] [Acquired 43 gold.] [Acquired Big Rat's leather.] [Acquired Big Rat's meat.]"

Taesan crossed this part calmly as well. He had no intention of making a fuss over basic rewards.

"[You have single-handedly defeated a challenging enemy.] [Agility has permanently increased by 1.]"

"Ho-o."
Taesan smiled satisfactorily. In a labyrinth, stats were an unchanging value. Any increase was always a good thing.

But the system window didn't end there.

"[Your Agility has increased permanently by 1 due to a surge of inspiration.] [Acquired basic skill [Swordsmanship].] [You have gained victory in battle with a broadened field of vision. Acquired special passive skill [Vision Control].] [You have gained victory in battle by discerning the opponent's weaknesses. Acquired special passive skill [Insight].] [Even in your first battle, you faced the opponent without hesitation. Acquired special passive skill [Composure].]"

"Huh?"

Taesan was surprised. From here on out, it was beyond his expectations.

But the system window continued to display.

"[You have achieved your first victory against a monster.] [Obtained 100 gold.] [Acquired the title [Brave One].]"

"Killing just a small fry and they're showering me with rewards like this?"

Even in Easy Mode, defeating a boss monster wouldn't yield half as much reward.

Taesan muttered with mixed feelings, but considering the nature of this labyrinth, it was quite natural.

Labyrinths didn't simply judge outcomes based on victory alone.
Here is the translation of the text:

He placed great emphasis on how the process went, how perfectly he secured the victory, and the method he used to achieve the outcome.

Taesan's battle was nearly perfect. Moreover, he was a solo player. The labyrinth merely rewarded him accordingly.

Still, Taesan, who didn't know himself well, felt both pleased and bewildered.

Regardless, a reward was a reward.

"Skill Window."

[Basic Skill: Swordsmanship] [Proficiency: 1%] [Seems capable of wielding a sword.]

It was the most basic skill. Moreover, for Taesan, who had pushed forward with skills, it was also a skill that hadn't been used until the end.

Taesan sighed heavily and checked the next skill.

[Special Passive Skill: Vision Control] [Proficiency: 5%] [Can obtain a broad field of vision. Still within the range of human vision.]

Vision Control. It's a decent skill. Human vision tends to blur outside of where one is focusing, but with Vision Control, one can see many places simultaneously.

This is quite a significant advantage. During battles, vision tends to narrow. Therefore, it becomes difficult to respond when variables arise. With this skill, however, such occurrences would decrease significantly.
Here's the English translation of the text:

In easy mode, he had to surpass the 20th floor to acquire this skill.

And the next skill.

[Special Passive Skill: Composure] [Proficiency: 12%] [Maintains an unwavering mind. Does not panic unless confronted with a presence beyond cognition. Receives adjustments in judgment.]

Composure was also a highly useful skill as it could resist all kinds of judgment.

[Special Passive Skill: Penetration] [Proficiency: 5%] [Can grasp a lot. Still seems to only penetrate weaknesses of living beings.]

"I've already obtained this."

Penetration. Though a very concise description, it was also a skill Taesan had used until the end.

When proficiency reaches 100%, skills evolve. If Penetration evolves several stages, it becomes a skill that penetrates everything around. It becomes complete reconnaissance.

Taesan had obtained Penetration by the 40th floor. Even that was at a fast pace. Hardcore players barely acquired Penetration by the 50th floor.

He had barely obtained such things on the 1st floor.

"Damn social gaps."

He knew there would be differences, but he didn't expect it to be this extreme. With a sigh, he checked his skills again.
Here's the English translation of the text:

[Soul Skill: Soul Elevation] [Proficiency 100%] [The soul has glimpsed a world one level above. Higher-dimensional souls strip away their opponent's strength with each victory.]

"What's this?"

At least it wasn't a skill obtained in this current world. Taesan recalled as he pondered for a moment.

"…When I was fighting S-rank enemies."

When he cleanly shaved off 1.25 million.

At the very end, a system window popped up. In his exhausted state, he nervously skipped over the system window.

"It definitely appeared like this."

[You have entered a state of unconscious immersion. Body and mind become unified.] [A miraculous power is engraved in your soul. You have obtained the Soul Skill [Soul Elevation].] [You were unable to acquire the skill because you were outside the labyrinth. [Soul Elevation] has been sealed.]

Yes. It was sealed. The skill could only be obtained within the labyrinth.

Now that he had entered the labyrinth, it had been unsealed.

"A skill that persists even if time is reversed?"
Here's the English translation of the text:

It must be because it's a skill engraved directly on the soul. Taesan, who was pondering for a moment, shook his head.

"Let's not overthink it."

It wasn't a problem he could solve right away anyway. He had obtained a good skill. That was all that mattered.

Taking something away from opponents with each kill—it implied the potential to infinitely strengthen depending on the conditions. It was hard to find a skill better than this.

With a satisfied expression, Taesan closed the skill window.

"The title... doesn't seem like much."

[Title: Brave One] [You have proven that courage is not recklessness.] [NPCs feel favorably towards you.]

Another favorability title again. Taesan closed the title window without saying a word.

The shopkeeper had told him to come back alive, and he did. That meant the shop would be open.

There was one thing left to do. Taesan returned to the shopkeeper with leather and meat in hand.

* * *

The dwarf who saw Taesan return dropped his pipe.

"...You're alive?"

"Were you hoping for me to die?"

"No, not that."

Hastily picking up his pipe, the dwarf looked at Taesan with a strange expression.
Here's the English translation of the text:

"Surely you didn't come back without encountering any monsters?"

"I encountered them."

"Ah... so you must have escaped. It's not easy to flee from rat bastards, how did you manage to succeed?"

The moment he turned his back, the Big Rat chased him all the way to the safe zone, but its basic damage wasn't high enough, so there was a chance of survival if he ran away quickly.

The dwarf thought Taesan had made that decision. Eyeing his face, the dwarf twitched his eyebrows.

"No fear?"

"Huh?"

"No, never mind."

In a desperate situation, Taesan did not falter. At this rate, there was just enough value in becoming his trading partner.

Taesan opened his inventory and said,

"I caught it."

The dwarf dropped his pipe again.

"... You caught it?"

Taesan took out the Big Rat's leather and meat from his inventory.

"If this is a shop, you sell goods, right? How much can you offer for these?"

"..."

"Sir?"

The dwarf with a blank face finally spoke.

"Did you really catch it?"

"Would I lie about that?"

"...How?"
The dwarf visibly flinched. Taesan's expression seemed to say he was surprised by everything.

"If you catch it, you catch it. Why are you so surprised?"

"You..."

The dwarf was at a loss for words. He gathered himself and cautiously reached out his hand.

"S-show me."

Taesan calmly handed over the leather and meat.

[Big Rat Meat] [Quality: 96%] [Meat from a Big Rat. It can be eaten, if you dare.] [Big Rat Leather] [Quality: 95%] [Leather from a Big Rat. Seems reasonably warm.]

The dwarf's pupils dilated.

It's real. And of the highest quality at that. It meant he had caught it perfectly without any mess.

"How..."

Big Rats are tough. Even his proud soldiers couldn't catch them easily due to their speed. It wasn't a monster for a newcomer to the labyrinth to catch.

But items don't lie. The dwarf, looking at Taesan with disbelief, finally came to his senses belatedly.

"...Alright. Since you've satisfied my conditions, let's open the shop."

His role was that of a shop owner. Now that the conditions were met, it was time to perform his duty.
"What do you need?"

"What are you selling?"

"I've got everything, just tell me."

In that case, what to buy was already decided.

"A Tower Shield. Do you have one?"

"A Tower Shield? A big one?"

"Yes. Something large enough to hold with both hands."

"Why do you want to buy it?"

"I'm planning to smack someone with it. Completely."

"...That's the right answer."

The dwarf let out a breath of admiration. After briefly gazing at Taesan with a look of awe, he reached into the empty space.

"Golden Gate."

Swish.

The dwarf, rummaging through the cracked space, pulled out the Tower Shield. It was large enough to cover a person's body and looked quite sturdy.

"How about this?"

Taesan took the shield and checked it.

[Sturdy Tower Shield] [Attack +1] [Defense +5] [Looks sturdy enough to withstand many attacks.]

Taesan was surprised. It wasn't just decent; equipment of this level would typically only be found on the 7th floor in easy mode.

"How much?"

"500 gold."

It was a fair price. Taesan glanced at his gold stash. 243 gold. He was halfway short.

"I'll have to come back later."
With the increase in stats, catching Big Rats became much easier. He just needed to catch about seven more.

As Taesan was leaving his shield behind, the dwarf grabbed him.

"Where are you going?"

"I'm short on gold."

"Don't worry about that. I'll give it to you for free."

Taesan, who was heading towards the labyrinth, hesitated.

"For free?"

"Yeah."

As if to prove it wasn't a lie, the dwarf tossed the shield.

[You have obtained a Sturdy Tower Shield.]

"Giving it away for free?"

It was an unexpected gesture from a shopkeeper. But the dwarf didn't stop there.

"You've got about 250 gold now, right? There should be something decent you can buy with that. Just wait."

Continuing to pull things from the space, the dwarf puzzled Taesan.

"What's going on?"

'Itaeyeon has said before that the dwarf is always grumpy and has never shown anything to anyone. She said that when she gave him something, he was very disappointed. It's like giving something that doesn't fit in a fountain.

But now the dwarf was generously giving him a handout like a sucker.
