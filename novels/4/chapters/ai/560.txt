**Chapter 561**

561. 98th Floor. The Complete Existence. High Priest (4)

The black ink spreads out, engulfing everything and absorbing it into its own belly, a single authority.

Taesan pulled out a grayish hue.

The boundary, imbued with physical strength, charges towards the black ink and collides with it.

However, the black ink does not budge.

The complete High Priest directly wields its authority. Its power is so strong that Taesan's boundary is caught and devoured, disappearing as if it never existed in the first place.

The ink invades the space, pressuring Taesan. Taesan quickly retreats, creating distance from the invading ink.

"It even devours boundaries, doesn't it?"

The complete High Priest directly wields its authority.

Naturally, its level and scale are incomparable to any existence it has met so far.

Boundaries alone are not enough to counter it.

Then, what if it's the same High Priest's authority?

Taesan focused his mind. The boundary is realized in the world. And as it's realized, the boundary gradually loses its color.

The High Priest's authority. The valueless form appears.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It collides with the authority of the abyssal void that devours everything as it is.

Whoa!

The collision finally occurred. The black ink couldn't devour the valueless thing properly and became distorted.

It connects.

At that moment, Taesan was about to quickly pull out his authority to confirm the situation.

Rumble.

The main body of the abyssal void moves its body. The massive flesh trembles greatly.

And the black ink expands.

The valueless thing is instantly devoured by the authority of the abyssal void and rushes towards Taesan.

"Uh!"

Taesan quickly dodges, but the black ink touches him.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

A boundary negation occurs around Taesan. He tries to shake off the black ink that's trying to devour him and instead tries to devour it.

One of the characteristics of boundary negation. It can take in the enemy's power that touches him and make it his own.

But this time, it's impossible.

There was nothing in the black ink. Since there was no power for the boundary negation to devour, it was instantly consumed.

He pulls out the boundary.

And compresses it into a spherical shape.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!"

Note: The translation tries to maintain the original tone and style of the text, but some nuances may be lost in translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The swirling black ink and ash-colored beads collide. Their powers spread out, and the waves engulf everything in all directions.

But the beads can't hold out for long.

Before long, the black ink completely devours the boundaries.

Taesan folds his arms.

[You have activated magic overlap.]

A magic that combines hundreds of boundaries is manifested.

It's a quality and quantity that can crush a planet into dust and still have a significant impact on a galactic scale. But all of it comes into contact with the ink and is consumed.

"It's tough."

The wizard had said that Taesan was a worthy opponent. But when they actually faced off, it was the opposite.

Mujeogang was close to being Taesan's counter.

The boundaries he possessed were something that existed between the universe and beyond.

Therefore, he had a significant advantage over both sides. If they were to engage in a direct power struggle, Taesan would likely have the upper hand.

So, the transcendents who faced Taesan had to respond to his boundaries in various ways, and Taesan could start the battle with a certain degree of advantage from the beginning.

But Mujeogang was different.

Mujeogang was an empty existence.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was no need to respond from the beginning. Even if it was a boundary, it would be fine to just leave it in an empty space.

"'Doesn't the concept of conquest even have any meaning?'

It was just an empty space. It wasn't a concept that could be conquered.

Taesan's eyes sank.

'Let's try it once.'

The power he obtained by defeating Leviathan was one. Taesan's wrist guard shone.

[You have activated the end.]

It was the end contained in the wrist guard. A massive power that announced the end of all things and brought destruction to the universe.

Normally, this power wouldn't work on Gosin, who was beyond the concept of all things.

But the end was contained within the boundary.

It pulled out everything, including what was in his treasure box, and spread it out.

It was the end of all things.

The power to bring an end to everything, beyond the concept of all things, was realized.

Kwagagaga!

The end exploded and swept everything away. The black ink spread out in an instant.

Taesan focused the exploding end and swung it towards the abyss.

And Taesan himself charged forward. The sword contained a massive power."

Note: "Kwagagaga" is an onomatopoeic word that is difficult to translate, but it's meant to convey a sense of intense energy or explosion.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a calculation to pierce through the road, carrying the end, and deal a blow to the true body of Mujagang with the physical strength that contained multiplication.

But Taesan couldn't move according to plan.

Rumble.

Mujagang's body began to move. Its massive flesh expanded rapidly, growing several times its original size.

And as it grew, it reached the end.

The end was engulfed and disappeared into the flesh.

Without leaving any ripples or distortions, it was as if nothing had happened.

Taesan realized belatedly. That Mujagang's body was truly the real Mujagang.

The swirling black ink was just a simple fragment, a fact that was being stated.

[You activated Teleport [Boundary].

Tat.

You created a distance of about one planet.

Through a series of battles, Taesan was able to roughly understand Mujagang.

The black ink was part of Mujagang's power. That ink devoured and dyed everything it touched, even boundaries.

There was no bottom to it.

The ink, which was the size of a wall, had consumed hundreds of magic that could leave marks on the galaxy itself.

Moreover, Mujagang's flesh lump added to it."

Note: Mujagang appears to be a proper noun, possibly a name or title, and I've left it untranslated.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was a single concept. The Muzegang's body itself was a power.

"It's a monster."

I had consumed a lot of things, but I couldn't deal any damage.

This was the true nature of Gosin.

Just piercing through the water and entering required a considerable amount of power, but even if I managed to enter, Gosin's body would swallow everything.

"What should I do?"

What could I do to defeat Gosin?

I had to deal damage to Gosin's main body.

But that main body itself was a power.

After a moment of contemplation, Taesan made a decision.

"Let's try it simply."

He surrounded himself with a boundary, focused his strength in his legs, and sprinted.

The Muzegang's flesh trembled. The black water droplets left stains on the world like ink.

Taesan didn't dodge.

He ran towards the Muzegang at the fastest speed he could muster.

The Muzegang also realized something from Taesan's movement. Taesan was betting everything on this one attack.

He was thinking of dealing direct damage to him.

The Muzegang laughed at Taesan because it realized that.

He was the one who could encompass everything.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He could swallow everything, including the universe, with his boundless abyss-like power, and then spit it out. No matter how strong his opponent was, it was all the same. If he wanted to, he could contain the entire universe within himself and still have room to spare.

The power of Taesan meant nothing to him.

Black ink-like substances covered Taesan. They broke through the boundaries that surrounded him and reached out to Taesan.

The boundary was quickly consumed. In an instant, Taesan's bare body was exposed, and the attack was neutralized.

But Taesan did not back down.

He moved forward, and forward again. He kept advancing, and finally reached the edge of the abyss.

The abyss opened its mouth wide. It seemed to be saying, "Come on, try it if you dare," with a confident posture.

Taesan took a step forward.

He advanced even further, until his hand was about to touch the abyss.

And he didn't stop there.

[Wait!] [Master?]

Taesan's body entered the abyss.

The abyss was taken aback by his action. It didn't expect Taesan to dive into its depths.

But the abyss soon shook its body with joy.

Its power was a bottomless abyss.

Once someone fell in, they could never come out again.

Even if they were a god, it was all the same.

No big deal. The abyss thought so. This was the end.

The abyss erased Taesan's existence from its mind.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And within his domain, there was someone who dared to wield a crude power.

The demon god.

Next, it would devour that thing.

The dark beast moved its massive body.

The demon god also realized it. The presence of Taesan had disappeared, and the dark beast was approaching.

A look of dismay appeared on the demon god's face.

Ku-u-u-ung.

The dark beast arrived in front of the demon god.

The demon god smiled wryly and gathered its hands.

[...I had expected this possibility too.]

The divine punishment is strong.

It wouldn't be strange even if Taesan lost. This outcome was also not unlikely.

[At least... I'll try to take revenge.]

The demon god muttered to itself and gathered its hands.

Darkness gathered. But that darkness was extremely weak and small compared to the original power she had wielded. Too much power had been consumed so far.

The dark beast ridiculed her.

The moment the black ink was about to splash.

The dark beast's movement stopped.

[...Hmm?]

The demon god, who was about to respond, was also taken aback. The dark beast had suddenly stopped like a bird struck by lightning.

Kkku-ruk.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The body of Mujagang is twisting.

Mujagang's body is a power in and of itself, a bottomless abyss.

Everything gets sucked in and can never come out again.

But within it, a clear wave of power was felt. It was an impossible feat. Mujagang was also taken aback. He had devoured over ten transcenders, but none of them had ever escaped his grasp.

[……Taesan?]

The demon god murmurs.

* * *

[Hey! You! What kind of crazy thing are you doing!] [Ah, ah, ah. Master.]

Bardley shouts and Akasha falls into a panic.

Taesan is currently within Mujagang's power, in the bottomless abyss.

There was nothing to be seen.

There was only an endless, dark cliff.

"It's really endless."

Taesan murmurs. The fact that there was no bottom was not a lie.

This place was literally infinite.

He swings his sword, but it doesn't reach anywhere and disappears. Magic, too, disappears instantly. Anything that appears vanishes somewhere.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The existence of Taesan was also similar, its very existence was about to disappear somewhere.

If it were the current situation, it would last only a day. Being exposed to the power of Gosin with bare hands was not much different.

I couldn't hold out for long.

So, I thought I'd take care of it beforehand.

[What, what, what am I doing... This crazy thing...]

"Anyway, the chances of winning a head-on battle were low."

I had to consume a considerable amount of power just to break through the black ink. And even if I managed to do that, I had to deal direct damage to Mujogang, but that was impossible due to its ability to absorb everything.

So, I decided to infiltrate from the inside.

I'll blow it up from within.

[Ah, no. That's... It sounds good, but what with...]

"I've thought this through. I've had a lot of fun so far."

[What's with...]
"My magic was perfectly absorbed by Mujogang's black ink. But... the boundary of the end was different."

It's infinite, but there's a limit to the power that can be consumed and the intensity of the attack.

"That limit is ridiculously high, though."

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Unlike black ink, I had devoured countless transcenders from the beginning and stored them within myself. It meant that I couldn't reach the limit with a complete concept.

'I can do it.'

If it's Taesan, I can break through that limit.

Then, Bardray finally realized what Taesan was doing.

[Wait a minute. You.]

'It's a gamble, but the possibilities are overflowing.'

[You activated Transformation.]

70,338.

[You activated Addition.]

140,676.

[You activated the Sword of Tenacity.]

422,028.

[You activated Vital Point Designation.]

844,056.

[You activated Intense Strike.] [You activated Copy.]

Kuuuuuuuuung!

The physical force, which had taken shape in the abyss, was bound by the boundary. The boundary and physical force intertwined, giving birth to something new.

Even the abyss, which had destroyed everything and fallen, couldn't grasp the physical force of the boundary.

The attack power had increased even more than before. The damage was over 7 trillion. It was incomparable to before.

But it was still insufficient.

There was no initial skill reset. Multiplication couldn't be overlapped.

However, with the current physical force's authority, he had the power to do so."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan controlled the power of his physical strength.

He stored 7 trillion damage in his sword without unleashing it.

And in that state, he turned everything around.

[You have activated the cycle.]

He recycled all the skills he had used.

And then activated them again.

[You have activated transformation.] [You have activated addition.] [You have activated the sword of determination.] [You have activated rapid targeting.] [You have activated strong strike.] [You have activated copying.]

Damage exceeding 7 trillion was stored in his sword once again. Bardley let out a sigh.

[Wait... just a moment.]

"Hold on."

[No, it's not about holding on. It's like it's going to break.]

"Hold on."

[Ah...].

Taesan focused his mind to control his physical strength. Even he, who controlled physical strength itself, found it difficult to withstand something.

But it's not the end.

[You have activated the ring of distortion of the regretful person. The cooldown of multiplication has been reset.]

Once again.

He overlapped skills without cooldown, such as addition and multiplication.

And once again.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have activated the cycle.]

Kkkkkkkk.

A physical force composed of four multiplications is concentrated within Bardray.

[Uh, uhh.]

Bardray is exerting its power.

It is a massive, ash-colored physical force.

Even within infinity, it shines with a towering authority. The interior of the abyss is distorted and destroyed.

Taesan wields his sword. The sword touches the void.

And infinity begins to collapse.
