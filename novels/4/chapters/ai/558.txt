**Episode 559**

559. 98th Floor. A Complete Existence. Gosin (2)

Gosin.

It's not a part, a fragment, a piece, or a portion.

It's a complete, perfect Gosin that stands before me.

But Taesan's expression didn't change.

"Is that the Gosin I need to handle?"

"I've thought about it. What's the most difficult Gosin for us, and who can handle it. And as a result, it's been decided."

Mujeogang. The Lord of the Abyss. The Administrator of the Bottomless Pit.

Just by the name, I could guess what kind of existence it is and what kind of power it wields.

Taesan nodded.

"Okay. I accept."

[Quest Accepted.]

A system window appeared. A faint sense of relief passed over the magician's face.

"I'm glad I accepted. I was worried about what to do if I rejected it."

"I told you, I didn't think about rejecting it."

"Still, you never know what's on someone's mind. Okay, then I'll ask a favor."

The magician clapped his hands. Space opened up.

Mujeogang must be on the other side.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan entered the open space. As he transcended the space, the wizard said to him:

"Let me tell you, you're not alone in this. You don't have that kind of conscience. There will be someone to help you."

With those words, Taesan arrived at the other side of the space.

And Taesan immediately felt it.

Something was different.

Taesan looked up.

And he could see it.

The black paint that had been applied.

"This is...".

[What the...? This is...]

A part of the universe had been dyed black.

No other description was possible. It was simply, purely black. Akasha muttered in amazement.

[It's like a picture.]

In a landscape painting that was perfectly drawn, indistinguishable from reality, with all colors consumed by the black paint, it looked like it had been carelessly splattered on.

There was no sense of space or reality.

The black paint was dyeing an extremely vast space.

It was enough to engulf dozens of planets and still have some left over. Taesan slowly approached the black paint. As he got closer and examined it, he was able to understand a few more facts.

The black paint was spreading further and further.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was coloring the universe with its own color, as if it was painting its own body.

'Isn't this concept just simple coverage?'

Rather than that, it was closer to devouring and absorbing. It was putting the universe inside its own camouflage.

'Is this some kind of divine punishment?'

Taesan muttered. A distorted wave of power emerged from the black ink.

Kwaaaang!

And from within the ink, a black existence burst out.

[#$#%^! appeared.]

It was a Sage.

The existence with a mottled color revealed its form.

It had a shape similar to a rhombus. The Sage charged towards Taesan. Taesan lightly flicked his finger.

[You have activated the Frost Arrow.]

A cold arrow shot towards the Sage.

Even if it was an elementary magic, the user was Taesan, a Transcender. The Frost Arrow contained power that could shake the balance of a planet.

The Frost Arrow and the Sage collided.

And the Frost Arrow disappeared, buried inside the Sage.

There was no wave or clash of power.

It was as if the Frost Arrow had fallen into an endless hole and vanished. The Sage continued to charge forward.

Kukukuku!

'Is it being absorbed?'"

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan lightly dodged and thought.

Is it the concept of the world being dyed with the concept of Gosin, erasing it?

"......That's not it."

It didn't feel that way. Taesan fired his ice arrow again.

The cold arrow touched the four gods and disappeared, buried in them.

It wasn't about dyeing, but rather a concept of putting it inside himself.

"I get it roughly."

Mujeogang, the administrator of the bottomless pit.

It was literally true. Gosin was a trash can that swallowed everything and threw it away in his pit.

The black ink that covered the world was expanding that pit.

Roughly understanding was over. Taesan didn't dodge the attacking four gods.

A rhombus-shaped figure pierced Taesan.

Taesan grabbed the four gods as they were.

"Let's try to throw this away too."

A boundary occurred in Taesan's hand. He swallowed the four gods and pressured them.

The four gods activated the power they had received and tried to swallow everything and throw it away.

But it didn't happen.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The boundary didn't collapse, but instead, it was stained by the sword. It was only then that I realized something was wrong and desperately tried to escape, but it was impossible. The sword shattered and broke free.

Ka-a-a-ang!

[Your spiritual power has been seized. You have acquired the special skill [Deep Place].]

You have seized the power of the sword.

[Special Skill: Deep Place] [Proficiency: 1%] [A deep and profound abyss. It destroys and devours all things.]

It's not a powerful ability, but a simple skill. At this point, it doesn't provide much help. Since the opponent is essentially a bottomless pit, the power of the sword is likely to be inferior.

However, it was helpful in understanding the power of the divine. Taesan grasped the skill.

"There's a being waiting, I said."

But there was no one around.

Had I fought against the divine and everything been destroyed, leaving no remnants? Taesan was momentarily lost in thought about what to do next.

A presence was felt within the dark ink.

That was the abyss that devours all things. No presence could be felt.

But a clear power and concept were felt within the ink.

It was a massive existence that even the divine power couldn't grasp, a being of immense significance.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Its presence drew closer and closer, and soon the dark ink burst forth.

[Ahahahaha!]

A voice mixed with frustration echoed.

Her pure white skin was tainted with dark ink, and even in the darkness, her black hair shone brilliantly.

The dark ink tried to swallow the being that emerged. She gritted her teeth and swung her fingers.

[Get out.]

The darkness condensed. A pure, universal darkness unlike the blackness of the abyss. A darkness that covered the world and was as black as ink.

The condensed darkness collided with the abyss's power, and they cancelled each other out. A massive wave shook the universe.

But the dark ink didn't back down easily. It somehow managed to cling to its opponent.

And it tried to swallow them whole. The opponent's expression froze.

[Devour.]

And in that moment, the mountain moved.

The beast that followed orders arose. It rushed forward like a wild animal, tearing apart the dark ink that had taken hold and crushing it.

And then, it spat out the darkness and burst forth.

Kwaaaaaaa!

A massive wave spread out. The dark ink that had been consuming the universe was pushed back, if only slightly, but clearly.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$A leisurely woman checks the Taesan late.

[…You are...]

Hair as black as ink, but its color has faded. Sharp feline eyes filled with irritation. A long black dress with slashes, revealing flashes of skin.

"Long time no see, Masin."

Taesan greeted.

* * *

Masin. Lucifer.

One of the transcendents who held goodwill towards Taesan.

No, to be precise, the one who held the greatest goodwill among the transcendents, that wasn't an exaggeration. Masin, who checked Taesan, smiled gently.

[They said reinforcements were coming, and it's you?]

"It seems so."

Masin was about to say more. But the spreading black ink stopped them.

[Hm.]

"You're going right in?"

[Yes, I would like to... but... I'm not in perfect condition either.]

Masin bit their lip. Half of them was covered in black ink. Their aura was quite unstable.

For a complete transcendent who had reached a high level, seeing them in such a shaken state was a first.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It seems like I need a break for a bit. Let's take a step back for a moment."

"Is that okay?"

"I've also revealed my scars. It won't take long to recover, but time can be bought."

"Then let's do it."

Taesan moved to a different location in the universe with Maseon. After getting far enough away from Gosin's influence, Maseon scowled.

"Damn contamination. It's infuriating."

The black ink that had tainted her was shaking her foundation. Taesan, who had been watching her for a moment, reached out his hand.

"Can I take care of it for you?"

"……Oh."

Maseon smiled faintly.

"Let's try it once."

Maseon grasped Taesan's hand. Taesan focused his mind.

"Come out. Eat it away."

He gave an order to the beast. The beast at the boundary obeyed the order.

"Hmph."

Maseon let out a short sigh. A strange sensation enveloped her.

Ka-ga-gak!

The black ink that had tainted her was sucked into the boundary and disappeared. Before long, Maseon regained her original form.

"Oh."

Maseon, who had checked her body, was surprised.

Gosin's contamination had completely disappeared.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If I had tried to remove it myself, it would have taken a considerable amount of time. And I would have suffered significant losses as well."

The state of the demon god was not good. To remove the corruption of the divine punishment, I had to cut off my own domain. It was inevitable that I would suffer a loss of power.

However, Taesan perfectly removed only the corruption of the divine punishment.

"It's directly experienced, and it's truly amazing. If you're with me, we can definitely end the war."

"Have you fully recovered?"

"I want to say yes, but it's not that easy. I need a little rest."

"Then take a rest."

Taesan said calmly. Distorted beings from the other side of the universe were rushing towards us.

They were all apostles of the abyss.

"I'll take care of the troublesome ones."

At the same time, the boundary covered the universe.

The apostles who were rushing towards us were unable to do anything and disappeared. At that sight, the demon god let out a small laugh.

"I have a favor to ask."

The demon god slowly recovered himself.

Meanwhile, Taesan had been dealing with the divine punishment's minions without any problems.

And Taesan asked the demon god a curious question.

"Did you think you would fight the old demon god?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The former ruler of the demon world, the ancient god. The ancient god of the demon world.

Taesan had a past encounter with him.

As an opponent who opposed the ancient god, the ancient god knew how to fight against his existence.

[I was going to do the same, but he deliberately avoided me. I could chase him, but I didn't have the leisure to do so. That's why I came here.]

The ancient god opened his eyes. His gaze at Taesan was filled with joy.

[At the time, I thought I couldn't kill him, and it was frustrating... but now that I think about it, it's fortunate.]

"Why is that?"

[Thanks to that, I can fight alongside you now.]

The ancient god chuckled.

[Once, I wanted to fight alongside you. Well, it wasn't in this direction, but I'll take the direction of supporting you.]

"Is that your support?"

[You're the only one who can kill the ancient god.]

No matter how hard the ancient god tried, he couldn't kill the ancient god. The concept she possessed couldn't deal a blow to the ancient god's essence.

But Taesan was different.

Taesan could kill the ancient god.

[And... you might be stronger than me.]

"A humble remark."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No, this is serious."

The god's voice didn't waver at all. It was as if he was telling the truth with a serious attitude.

"You've become strong on your own, overcoming our trials and proving your worth to reach this place.]

The gods and goddesses.

You've become involved in the great battle that determines the fate of the universe to a considerable extent.

It took an extremely short time to get that far. To the transcenders, it was a moment that was almost instantaneous. From a weak mortal to a lofty position.

"I've come a long way.]

The god muttered to himself, as if he was surprised anew."
