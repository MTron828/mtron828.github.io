**Chapter 358**

358. 76th Floor, Guides of Evil (3)

There were four remaining. Gwonseong, Altire, the black and white twins, and the noble one, Helia.

"Heh heh."

The muscular man, Gwonseong Altire, let out a dry laugh.

"I have an enormous amount of power."

Taesan had divine power, black magic, spirit king power, and destructive power. He used various powers.

And there was nothing that could surpass him.

"How is this possible?"

Altire couldn't accept it.

He had spent his entire life with his fists. He had swung them since he was born, never taking a single day off. He had trained and trained and trained, without worrying about anything else.

He had become Gwonseong.

The other guides here were not much different from him.

A person with exceptional talent, who obsessively focused on what they had and trained to the limit, could barely reach this place. That was the depths.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No matter how much talent one has, if they underestimate their own abilities or turn their attention elsewhere, they will never reach that place.

But now, Taesan had immense power.

Normally, one would think that each individual's power would be weaker compared to those who have dug deep into their own abilities, but Taesan was different.

Each of his abilities was either superior to or on par with those of the guides.

'It's...different.'

Exactly, it's different.

Altia realized that such an existence was a true adventurer capable of conquering the labyrinth.

'But even so, I can't give up.'

Altia clenched his fist. Taesan gazed at him, taking a combat stance.

When Taesan didn't initiate a forced duel, Altia scowled.

'What are you doing?'

'I'm getting tired of this.'

Taesan swung his sword.

'Let's do it all at once.'

'...Even so, that's too arrogant.'

Altia's face hardened. The aura emanating from the black-and-white twins grew stronger, and Helia's face contorted.

'You may be strong, but you're not at a level where you can defeat the four of us.'"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Taesan's victory was only due to the forced duel. Even if the opponent increased by just one person, he couldn't guarantee a win.

In addition, Taesan had exhausted a lot of energy, while the four of them were in top condition.

However, Taesan did not initiate a forced duel.

Altia shook her head.

"If you want that, I won't tell a lie."

"I said it already. Take everything."

"Then."

Kwonseong clenched his fist and shouted loudly.

"I am Kwonseong! I may have been abandoned with nothing, but I am the one who conquered the world with just one fist!"

[Altia activated her first declaration.]

The black and white twins raised their hands.

"The women walk along the hidden lake shore."

This was the preparation process to use a special power.

"The sound of footsteps ringing out and merging."

"And soon, the two become one."

[The black twin activated the fusion.] [The white twin activated the fusion.]

The two bodies collapsed.

"Is that kind of skill possible?"

[A special skill that only twins can possess. It's been a while since I've seen it.]

The collapsed bodies merged into one.

The left side was black, and the right side was white."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The overlapping voices cried out simultaneously.

"I'll kill you."

Helia drew her sword and slashed her own arm, drawing a cross-shaped line.

"I'll make you regret your arrogance."

Chaac!

Instead of red, blue blood flowed out. Taesan muttered.

"Are you not human?"

"That's right. I'm not a ordinary human like you. I'm a descendant of the gods."

The blue blood began to spread throughout Helia's body. Her muscles bulged, and her veins popped out.

[Helia activated her physical burden shift.] [Helia activated her mental burden shift.] [Helia activated her forced divine blood circulation.]

"In the name of the gods, I'll kill you."

"That target is you, after all."

Marsin wanted Taesan to win.

The gods desired their deaths.

Pitiful.

The three guides charged at once.

Taesan drew his sword.

Kuuuuung!

Power clashed with power. The first to charge was Gwonseong Altair.

Sword and fist collided. A fierce gust of wind grazed past Taesan's head.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With a name like Gwonseong, he's an opponent who puts everything on the line with just one punch.

[You activated Acceleration.]

Kagagak!

The sword and fist clashed. Altiaur was incredibly fast and strong. He easily kept up with Taesan's speed.

[You activated Evasion.]

Altiaur's fist, which had been in contact with the sword, slipped away. It wasn't just once. The trajectory of every punch was distorted. Taesan continued to attack in sync with the timing.

[You activated Counter.]

At the moment when Taesan's sword was about to pierce Altiaur's chest, ignoring his attack...

Chwaak!

A sharp and swift strike came. Taesan used a limited blink to dodge it.

The twin, who had become one, was dashing forward like a cat, wielding sharp claws.

Kagagak!

It was fast and powerful. Although the twin was using only one of their two bodies, their speed was similar to Taesan's. Moreover, their movements were like those of a beast, making it difficult to respond.

And with an explosion, Helia's body jumped.

Taesan blocked the falling sword.

Kaang!

"Hmm."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan let out a small sigh.

Although the continuous battle skill made it possible to fight for a long time, it wasn't like there was no physical exhaustion at all. When fighting strong enemies, the physical exhaustion was severe.

Compared to his top condition, Taesan's movements were somewhat slowed down after fighting four or five guides.

However, with his high basic stats, he wasn't in a state where he could be pushed back by the evil guide.

But now, Helia's power was surpassing Taesan's, albeit slightly.

'The buff stats are extremely high.'

And with a buff of this level, there would be a time limit.

Although the duration would be very short, he couldn't guarantee that he could hold out during that time.

[You activated Magic Overlap.] [You activated Frozen World.] [You activated Starlight Arrow.] [You activated Frozen World.]

He condensed his mana and released it.

[You activated Magic Release.] [You activated Forced Amplification.]

The bursting magic engulfed the space. The light and frost combined to destroy everything.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Kwonseong takes a step back, and the twins also quickly create some distance.

But Helia alone does not back down, and swings his sword wildly.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

A loud noise erupts, and the light-infused frost is shattered.

But they can't block it all. The aftermath engulfs Helia.

Kee-ying!

Helia's entire body is wrapped in an even thicker blue aura.

The light and frost shatter, and Helia charges at Taesan once again.

[You have activated the Storm Arrow of Bisago.]

The arrow draws a line and pierces through Helia.

Helia hastily swings his sword down.

Quarddak.

"Kkkkkuuuu!"

The arrow and Helia's sword clash fiercely. Taesan's eyebrows twitch.

'Block it?'

The Storm Arrow of Bisago is one of the top-tier intermediate black magic that Taesan has acquired.

It contains a power that cannot be blocked, having opened up a path to use it.

But Helia is blocking the arrow.

His entire body wrapped in blue aura becomes even thicker.

Ka-aa-aa-ang!

The sound of shattering erupts, and the arrow is repelled. Helia bursts into laughter.

"I'm not weak! I'm not weak! I'm not weak at all!""

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His eyes were red and bloodshot. With a half-mad gaze, he charged towards Taesan.

[You activated the shield of the White Rune's protection.]

Kwaaaang!

The sword and shield clashed, and the shield shattered in one blow.

"Ha, haha, haha!"

The light burst forth. Taesan blinked and swung his hand.

Numerous magic spells and dark magic appeared.

Although it was an attack with overlapping magic, Helia did not fall.

Instead, he broke through the mid-level magic with his body and charged towards Taesan.

Kwonseong and the twins also quickly charged towards Taesan, putting pressure on him.

[Your first attack was absolutely nullified.]

Taesan used the attack nullification to create distance and quickly gathered his mana.

[You activated concentrated detection.]

Keeeing!

The power of detection covered the guides of evil, but they bounced back the moment they touched them.

It didn't work. Helia sneered.

"The power of detection is nothing if you prepare a countermeasure."

It seemed that Taesan had prepared a response to detection while watching Helia fight other guides.

But it didn't matter much. If detection didn't work, he could just confirm it with his body.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ka-ga-ga-gak!"

The battle continues.

I throw my body and block, grasping the rough information and types of powers of the guides.

"Is it the divine blood?"

The blue blood that wraps around Helia. It's not just strong, but it also repels most of the incoming powers and resists.

However, it seemed to be a burden that was too much to bear. As the blue blood thickens, Helia's body turns red, and her eyes turn crimson.

There were two ways to respond.

Endure until self-destruction. Helia's skill is to grant a power that exceeds the limits of her physical body. Clearly, the user's mind and body cannot withstand it for long and will collapse.

But the opponent would also know that. So, they would try to take down Taesan before self-destruction.

And there was enough power to do so.

The three guides charge at once.

Taesan took a step back.

* * *

Taesan blocked the guides' attacks and endured.

She created an opening with magic and even attempted a counterattack.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, the advantage of numbers was useless. The attack nullification was completely consumed. Taesan's entire body was covered in wounds, and his stamina was dwindling.

"You were arrogant. You overestimated yourself and ultimately faced defeat. That's the limit of a heavenly being."

Helia sneered.

He was now certain of his victory. Taesan hadn't pulled out any special moves even as he was being pushed back. It meant he had no more hidden cards up his sleeve.

It was now possible to win even if he were to force a duel.

On the other hand, Altiair had a worried expression.

In his view, Taesan wasn't someone who made mistakes due to overconfidence.

"Let's end this quickly."

Altiair said to Helia and the black-and-white twins. Taesan responded.

"Maybe."

Kiiiiiing!

A small voice was accompanied by the activation of the wrist guard's power.

"Whoa!"

A massive shockwave engulfed them. Altiair hastily threw a punch to dispel the wave.

"That's...….

"Honestly, if we had fought separately, it could have been dangerous."

Taesan had taken down four guides so far.

They hadn't gone down easily. They had somehow targeted Taesan's weaknesses and bought time.

Note: "천것" (cheon-geot) is a term that can be translated to "heavenly being" or "divine being", but it's a bit ambiguous. It seems to imply that Taesan is a powerful or supernatural being, but the exact meaning is unclear without more context.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When I knocked down the net, the duration of the Divine Blessing was almost up.

Since the Divine Blessing is a skill that increases my strength, I couldn't guarantee victory once the duration ended. The ring that resets the cooldown was still under a month-long cooldown, making it unusable.

So, Taesan made a judgment.

Before the Divine Blessing's duration ended, I would finish the analysis all at once.

The armguard that ate the material began to expand and glow. The twin, who realized something was off late, threw their body.

Whoa!

But it didn't reach. The power bursting out of the armguard repelled her.

"The analysis is all done."

[You have activated a partial world change.]

Altia's pupils grew larger.

"This is it!"

The power to change the world itself into one's own domain, which was used when facing the Fire Spirit King.

"I wasn't unable to use it!"

Taesan had not activated the partial world change until now.

Even though it was possible to use it, he didn't, thinking that it was a powerful ability bound by cooldowns and restrictions.

"It's a power that requires careful preparation to use."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The partial world change changes the laws of the world.

To achieve the greatest effect, one had to understand the type and level of the opponent's power.

Taesan grasped all types of power while fighting with the three guides and recorded them on his bracelet.

He didn't trigger a forced duel for that reason.

The world is changing.

The laws of power wielded by the guides are weakening, and Taesan's domain is taking its place.

"What's going on?! I'm a descendant of the gods! The domain of a mere mortal like you can't be my opponent!"

Helia charges towards Taesan with a battle cry.

Taesan lightly waves his hand.

[You have activated the Starlight Arrow.]

It was the Starlight Arrow he had been using all along. Until now, Helia had blocked every shot with his sword.

Believing it would be the same this time, Helia swung his sword again.

Zzzt!

"Kuhh...!"

Helia is sent flying with a pained cry and crashes to the ground.

As he struggles to get up, he gasps out in difficulty.

"Uh, how...….

The blue blood that surrounded him had a crack in it."

Note: "길잡이" is translated to "guide", but it could also be translated to "navigator" or "pathfinder" depending on the context.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power that exceeded what Shinhyeol could withstand was applied, and it was shattered. It was an act that no guide of evil could accomplish.

Altiar and the twin also moved hastily.

The power contained in their attack was not something that could be underestimated, it was their full strength.

But it didn't reach.

Taesan swung his sword. Altiar's fist was split open. He then kicked the twin with all his might.

"Kkkk!"

"Kyaahk!"

It was too different from before.

Taesan was perfectly overwhelming them.

"I'm sorry, but I've recorded too many laws, so I can't hold out for long. So, let's end this quickly."

[You activated Beyond the Boundary.]

Falling into ruin. The power beyond that was bestowed upon Taesan.

[You activated Magic Overlap.]

The frost overlapped.

The twin trembled and took a step back, their fingertips shaking from the cold.

The adventurer who had stepped into the depths was shivering from the cold.

It was impossible to do so simply because of the low temperature.

It had to be stopped.

But how?

The twin quickly leaped towards Taesan, trying to push their body into the cold air with their claws.

Tchzech!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But from the tip of my fingernail to my entire body, I'm freezing up."

"Ahk!"

The twins let out a scream of surprise and jumped back.

A collection of frost that even the strongest warriors couldn't approach, a limit of mortal strength.

Literally, the world was freezing over.

Taesan instinctively realized. This was truly a magic created by the God of Magic itself. The power of a truly frozen world.

"Block it!"

[You have activated Magic Release.] [You have activated Forced Amplification.]

Taesan snapped his fingers. The guides held their breath and flew back. The condensed frozen world enveloped the world.

Note: There are some nuances in the translation that may not be perfectly conveyed, but this should give you a general idea of what the text is saying.
