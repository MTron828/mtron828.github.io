Chapter 314

314. The Fifth Return, Earth (10)

"Whew."

"You've worked hard, Lady."

"You too, Jung-ah."

Finally, the rough sorting was over. Kim Hwi-yeon lay down on the table, exhausted. Hard mode. Even she, who had entered the 40th floor, felt tired from handling so many things.

But now, the rough sorting was over. All that was left was to take a break until they returned to the labyrinth. She was about to take a nap, trying to catch up on her sleep.

Kiiiiing!

A massive shockwave hit them. Kim Hwi-yeon froze in place, still trying to get up.

"...What?"

"Just a moment."

Geum Jung-ah's face was also stiff with shock. They stumbled outside.

"What's that?"

They looked up at the sky and were amazed.

The sky above was opening up.

The power they felt was truly absolute. It was a pure, unadulterated power that was impossible to even imagine.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Everyone who felt the wave of power froze. Especially in the case of Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk, who were in a state of shock, the impact was even stronger.

"Uh..."

"What's going on?"

There had been a few instances where God had descended upon them before. But the sensation they felt now was unusual. It was more brutal and unfamiliar.

They were staring blankly at the sky.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

Suddenly, a massive power struck the sky. The collision of powers distorted space, causing people to scream and stumble.

At the same time, a roar erupted from the sky. A beast craving life, shouting to protect its own from being taken away. Everyone covered their ears. Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk clutched their heads in agony.

"Ugh."

Lee Tae-yeon covered his mouth. The sensation was mentally overwhelming, even though they weren't the target.

Ku-u-u-ung!

The being that let out the roar seemed to be pushed back, and the open sky closed up.

And then, the transformation began.

[Oo-o-o-o!]

A loud cry shook the world. A distorted and twisted being began to swell up and cover the sky.

"What the...!"

Kim Hwi-yeon screamed. He thought it was all over. He couldn't keep up with the sudden events that were unfolding.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Luckily, the system window informed them of the situation.

[Special Quest Start] [Defeat the Monster.]

"Special Quest?"

"Isn't it over yet?"

They murmured among themselves, coming to a conclusion.

"Do we have to defeat that thing?"

Someone's muttering made everyone look at the grotesquely distorted monster.

The monster was so mangled that its original form was unrecognizable.

"Ah......"

"Ugh."

People who looked at the monster covered their heads, stumbling backward in horror.

[Confusion Judgment in Progress......] [Madness Judgment in Progress......] [Mental Breakdown Judgment in Progress......]

"Aaaaah!"

"Uuuuh!"

People covered their heads, screaming in agony. Some had already failed the judgment and started to go berserk. Kim Hwi-yeon gritted his teeth.

"Don't look at it!"

Just looking at it was enough to drive them mad.

But that wasn't the end. From the sky, a dark, black energy was flowing down like lava.

Although they didn't know exactly what it was, they instinctively sensed it.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If they touch that, they will no longer be human."

"Get back!"

Kim Hwi-yeon shouted roughly.

"What's going on?"

In the midst of confusion, they started to flee from the emerging energy.

* * *

Taesan, who had glanced down below, summoned the spirit.

[You have summoned the Wind Spirit King, Minerva.] [You have summoned the highest-grade spirit of various colors, Barcas.] [Master, what's that?]

"Huh? Isn't that the guy who was supposed to be the True Dragon? Why did his existence disappear?"

"They interfered," Taesan said casually, as if trying to calm down the two who were flustered as soon as they appeared.

"Keep an eye on that for me."

Minerva and Barcas quickly grasped the situation after seeing the emerging black energy. The two nodded.

"Got it."

[As the master wishes.]

Minerva's body disappeared and reappeared in front of the people. The people who were stumbling around in the black energy opened their eyes wide in surprise.

Minerva swung her arm. The wind exploded, and the black energy was blown away cleanly.

"Wow!"

"Minerva-nim!"

The people cheered.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But Minerva scowled.

It was heavy.

As the Spirit King, she had to consume a considerable amount of energy just to block it. Kim Hwi-yeon cautiously approached her.

"Minerva-nim, that monster is......"

"I don't know either."

She was a more unusual existence than any monster she had seen.

"Can such a thing exist in this world?"

It was a question that arose.

Kuuuuung!

And a clash of powers began to occur in the heavens and the earth. Minerva looked up at the heavens and muttered quietly.

"Win. Master."

[Oooh!]

The monster that was no longer a dragon roared.

It raised its broken and twisted arm, striking the earth.

The earth dodged the attack, barely avoiding it.

Kuuuuung!

The attack that struck the earth caused it to collapse. Baekdu Mountain began to move. A fierce heat began to rise from the cracked earth.

Seeing the volcano erupting, Taesan opened his mouth.

"Stop."

Kkigigik!

The volcano's activity stopped due to the command.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The intense heat that was about to pierce the earth subsides.

[Oh oh oh!]

And the monster charges at Taesan.

[The opponent is an unbeatable enemy.] [You have activated the "Darkness and Chaos" skill.] [You have activated the "King's Vessel" skill.]

It unleashes a series of combat-related skills. The monster, having lost its sanity, starts to rampage wildly. Everything begins to collapse, and the mountain starts to crumble.

Ka-ga-gak!

Taesan blocks the monster's attack.

But Taesan's body, unable to withstand the force, is blown back. The monster moves its broken body at an incredible speed, almost impossible to track with the eyes. Relying on instinct and intuition, Taesan swings his sword.

Ka-aa-ang!

Taesan's body crashes to the ground again.

The monster stomps on the ground. It jumps and uses its massive body to crush Taesan.

[You have activated a random Blink skill.]

Taesan's body moves directly above the monster. He strikes down with his sword, targeting the vital points and using all his acceleration skills.

Ka-aa-aang!

[Dealt 1233 damage to the twisted, lifeless creature.]

But the sword doesn't pierce through.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It bounces back like it hit a solid iron wall. The monster's body trembles like it's being shaken. Taesan uses his aerial jump to dodge the wild and reckless attack.

[Oh oh oh!]

The monster howls and jumps.

"Faster."

It's not about responding with your eyes, but about reading the opponent's senses and intentions.

"Stronger."

Even with just simple stats, Taesan was overwhelmingly superior. Just by bumping into him, the monster's body was pushed back, and it was struggling to defend itself.

"And harder."

For Taesan, who had absolute judgment, defense was not a problem.

It meant that the monster's strength itself was superior to Taesan's.

[Oh oh oh!]

The monster's body grows larger, like a small hill, and it wildly swings its battered body.

[You have activated Amun's Black Seal.]

A black seal appears in Taesan's hand. He throws the seal at the monster, which is rushing towards him to crush everything.

An explosion occurs.

And the one who gets pushed back is Taesan.

[Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.]

"Ha."

Taesan laughs. With a pure clash of strength, the attack nullification was triggered.

"S-grade."

Among them, a single-digit level of strength.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a monster of a level that Taesan had defeated at the end of his previous life.

"It's not easy."

The monster jumped again, and the power that could destroy a mountain range fell onto Taesan's head.

* * *

"Ugh, ugh, ugh!"

People were shocked by the approaching black energy and ran away. Minerva scrunched up her face and summoned the wind, scattering the black energy.

But the energy kept getting closer.

"Tsk."

Minerva clicked her tongue.

She was the Spirit King, possessing power that rivaled the depths of the labyrinth.

However, as she was currently summoned, she couldn't use her full strength.

She was using all her might to hold back the spreading energy, but she was slowly reaching her limit.

"If this continues, I'll be sent back soon."

Minerva looked around at the people and made up her mind.

"Just once. I'll push with all my might, and at that moment, you all run away."

"Yes, yes?"

Minerva gathered her strength. Resigned to being sent back, she began to gather her remaining energy.

It was the moment she was about to unleash it.

[There's no need for that.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A gentle voice whispered. A massive presence stood before her.

Minerva's eyes widened.

"......Father?"

[The Spirit God, Beatrice, has descended.]

A spiritual entity without a physical body, wavering. The Spirit God revealed herself on earth.

The Spirit God's energy flowed out. Compared to her true power, it was extremely weak, like a grain of dust, but the power of nature perfectly enveloped the Baekdu Mountain.

The dark energy struck the natural barrier, but not even a slight tremor occurred.

[Those annoying things caused a delay, so it's a bit late.]

Beatrice gazed at the collapsed heavens with indifference and said,

[You've crossed the line in a very strange way. Thanks to that, we can intervene from here as well.]

"......Can Father also descend into other worlds?"

Minerva was taken aback. The concept of spirits didn't exist on earth. The Spirit God Beatrice was not a realm that could be intervened with.

Beatrice replied,

[This is a neutral realm. A world that's one step ahead of those and our own. It's a very unique and heterogeneous place, making it possible.]

"Oh, oh, oh......"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

When people saw Beatrice, they instinctively bowed their heads and bodies.

They couldn't even feel the power of Beatrice, let alone comprehend it. But despite that, an uncontrollable sense of awe welled up in their hearts.

Beatrice turned her gaze to the people.

For a moment, she looked at Lee Tae-yeon, then opened her mouth.

"[You should worship a different target. Offer your prayers to him.]"

"Ah……."

Only then did the people realize who they were fighting against.

The people knelt down, clasped their hands together, and began to pray.

"Lord Taesan……."

"Please……."

Until now, people had believed in Taesan and worshipped him as a god, but their faith was a ordinary one, offered to the strong.

But it was different now.

An instinctive sense of rejection towards the dark energy that felt eerie.

A monstrous creature from the heavens that made one's mind collapse just by looking at it.

And the battle that was destroying the very fabric of Baekdu Mountain itself.

It was a scene that was literally driving them mad. Even for those who were accustomed to many situations, it was as if the laws of the world themselves were broken and distorted.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

In the extreme situation, people began to believe that Taesan was the only savior who could save them.

A pure and unadulterated faith flowed towards Taesan, who was untainted by anything else, in the heavens and the earth.

Beatrice gazed at that sight with a mixture of emotions.

[It's ridiculous.]

Faith was the power of human belief.

The faith of hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of people was beyond what humans could comprehend.

There were those who received divinity by accepting people's faith, but most of them were not human to begin with, possessing some degree of divinity from birth.

However, Taesan, despite being human, was perfectly receiving faith without any loss.

The Spirit God was the god of spirits. He had existed in this world since the concept of spirits emerged. There may be stronger gods, but few were older than him.

Even he had never seen a case like Taesan's.

[Show me. Mortal. The power you possess.]

* * *

[OOOOO!]

The monster roared, flailing its body wildly. The earth crumbled and collapsed.

Taesan swung his sword to block the attack, but he couldn't help but allow it.

KAAAAAANG!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Your third absolute defense nullification has been activated.]

"Tch."

Taesan clicked his tongue. All his attack nullifications had been consumed.

But it wasn't a complete loss. He had figured out how to tackle the monster.

[You have activated the Frost Arrow.]

An icy arrow flew out. If the monster were to dodge lightly, it would be easy to avoid, but instead, the monster charged at Taesan. The arrow collided with the monster.

"A monster that charges without defending itself."

As if Taesan's attacks didn't work on it, the monster didn't bother to defend itself against Taesan's attacks.

The monster's pattern of recklessly charging was predictable because it lacked intelligence. If he focused solely on dodging, he could avoid its attacks.

But there was another problem.

[Dealt 1320 damage to the twisted, non-living creature.]

The monster's defense was too high. Even when Taesan landed a hit, the damage wasn't significant.

He lacked power. But Taesan continued to move his body."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If you lack power, you can just attack more. It was the moment when he was about to charge at the monster.

A tremendous power descended. The mountain trembled. The monster also felt a strong shockwave and hesitated, not charging at the mountain.

The mountain turned its gaze. A being with enormous power had descended beside Minerva.

"Is it a divine spirit?"

He unleashed his power, creating a barrier around them. The spreading dark energy was blocked.

Goshin had clearly crossed the line by intervening with the divine dragon. It was predictable that the gods would intervene.

It was a good thing. He could focus solely on his battle now.

The people's faith, which had been wavering in confusion, grew stronger.

It was a statement that the mountain could feel.

[The proficiency of divine power increased by 2%.]

Divine power rose.

[Oh oh oh!]

The monster charged. The mountain didn't dodge. Instead, he used the monster's power to strike back.

[Dealt 2431 damage to the twisted, non-living thing.] [You took 44353 damage.]

In an instant, his health dropped to less than half."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Taesan wears the divine power on his body. His dwindling physical strength is restored in an instant, and his mana and magic also surge.

The divine power soon reached its limit.

However, divine power is something that originates from people's beliefs.

Right now, millions of people are devoting everything to believe in Taesan.

The divine power that had reached its limit surges again in an instant. In just a few seconds, the divine power is restored to its original state.

[The proficiency of divine power has increased by 1%.]"
