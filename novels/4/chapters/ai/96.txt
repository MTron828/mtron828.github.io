97. The Young Lamb of Bekaeseta (7)

The cold of the ice arrows spreads. The grass in the meadow withers instantly, and frost breath emanates.

The mage groans.

"Frost Sphere...."

The pinnacle of ice magic. The mage mistakenly thought Taesan could handle it.

"Now I understand why none of the challengers so far have been able to overcome him."

Using Frost Sphere at such a rapid pace meant the mage belonged to the highest class of spellcaster. Even with a large group, those of lower caliber couldn't even approach him.

"But this time, it's different."

The mage signals. Two inspectors, who had been measuring the distance, charge simultaneously.

Their speed was astonishingly fast. In an instant, they cut through the undergrowth and closed in on Taesan. Watching their approach, Taesan did nothing.

"Huh?"

The mage was perplexed. Mages typically needed time to cast spells. Being so close meant unless they had an artifact, they couldn't respond.

"Is it really going to end this easily?"

The sword pierced Taesan's chest.
And their bodies returned.

"What!"

"Uh!"

"What's happening!"

Onlookers exclaimed in astonishment. Taesan casually looked at them and once again invoked Frost Arrows. Frost arrows floated in the air, increasing in number one by one.

"Uh, uh?"

The inspectors hesitated and moved their swords again.

But once again, their bodies returned to before they swung their swords.

The watching mage exclaimed in disbelief.

"Space, no, time manipulation magic? What is this!"

Lacking knowledge of the labyrinth, he couldn't think of any other explanation.

Meanwhile, Taesan continued to summon Frost Arrows. Now, their numbers were noticeably increasing.

"...Teleportation magic?"

The mage stared at Taesan with sunken eyes.

"Listen, everyone. Perhaps the author is preparing a wide-ranging magic. Looks like until that's complete, we can't move."

It was a perfect illusion.

Even while invoking Frost Arrows, Taesan could move freely.

The mage continued speaking.
"Perhaps he had cast all sorts of auxiliary spells to protect himself from attacks while preparing his magic. However, with that level of power, there are probably limitations."

Though it seemed like a coincidence, like stepping on a frog while backing up, they were getting close to the core. Nullifying attacks could only be activated three times per person, so after multiple attacks, they eventually vanished.

But it was a misconception that they could defeat Taesan by attacking in this manner.

Taesan intended to rectify each one.

They devised a strategy against Taesan and rushed in all at once. The archers shot arrows, the inspectors wielded swords and charged, and the mage chanted spells and launched them.

All of those attacks were erased by nullification.

They stubbornly continued their attacks.

And finally, the nullification ended. The inspector's sword, swinging swiftly, stabbed into Taesan's chest. When his body didn't revert as before, the man laughed and put even more strength into his grip on the sword.

"Die!"

Thunk!

The man was thrown back. He staggered to his feet from where he fell on the ground.

"What?"

Taesan continued chanting with a grim expression.

Now that the nullification was over, all of their attacks were hitting Taesan.
"But the damage doesn't go through.

Swords fail to cut flesh, arrows bounce off like hitting steel plates. Magic doesn't even cause a ripple.

"What in the world!"

In dismayed voices, Taesan thinks to himself.

'As expected, unless it's an aura, it's meaningless.'

His defense exceeds a hundred. Attacks with such ordinary weapons do no damage whatsoever.

'Did I take 60 damage?'

When facing Garant, he deliberately took an aura and received 63 damage. It meant there was 163 damage from just the aura.

'Is there also a defense penetration effect? I want to learn more.'

Taesan thought freely, while those who confronted him were driven to madness.

Their attacks, their actions, have no meaning. Stabbing a sword at the neck only pushes back with counterforce.

The mage shouts in frustration.

"I'm pushing! Let's try to knock him down!"

"Waaaah!"

A person in a giant armor pushes Taesan with a tower shield. But the armor's ground is merely dented, and Taesan doesn't even flinch.
Here's the translation of the text:

"A man ties Taesan's arms with a rope. Taesan pulls his arm away with an annoyed face. The man goes flying.

"Aaah!"

"It's quite a job controlling strength."

Even lightly hitting can kill. Taesan continues to cast frost arrows with an annoyed face.

The frost arrows drawn in the sky gradually increase in size.

Frost forms on the bushes that died unable to withstand the cold.

The man swinging a sword at Taesan cannot withstand the chill and shouts to the magician, hitting it hard.

"Do whatever you can!"

"W-what, what do you want me to do!"

The magician was also panicking. At first, he thought it was simply an enhanced version of the Frost Circle. But over time, he realized it was a transient misplay.

Frost arrows, dozens of Frost Circles, were drawn in the sky.

The magician realized.

That wasn't just a reinforcement of the Frost Circle.

It was just a brute force manifestation of countless Frost Circles.

Attacks towards Taesan gradually come to a halt. With fearful faces, they slowly back away.

"Ah......"

Shadows covered them.

The frost arrows drawn in the sky had become a massive sphere.

Thud.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"The earth freezes. Cold penetrates deep into the ground.

Even nature cannot withstand the freezing cold. Frost gathers around their throats. They shiver, making chattering sounds as they reluctantly spread apart.

"I like wide spaces. It allows for various experiments."

The frost arrows and fiery circles remain still until Taesan fires them.

What if dozens, hundreds of spells are cast and launched all at once?

I've been curious since learning frost arrows, but it was a method I couldn't use in narrow mazes. On Earth, I didn't have the chance to test it because I was too busy blocking monsters, but there are no such monsters here.

Taesan clenched his fist.

[You activated Ice Crystals.]

Ice crystals firmly fix the clustered frost arrows.

Taesan lowers his hand.

[You activated Magic Acceleration.]

The sphere of ice falls to the ground.

The accelerated object collides with the neighboring field.

Boom!

"Aaah!"

"Aaaah!"

People scream as they are thrown away with a loud noise. The magicians try to withstand it with gritted teeth, but they are torn apart by the force alone.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"A moment later, they struggled to stand and looked in astonishment at the field.

Everything in the field was frozen.

The bushes, trees, the entire forestâ€”everything without exception was trapped in a prison of ice. The extreme cold didn't stop there but expanded its domain, engulfing the surroundings.

"This, this...."

The magicians couldn't believe it. Though it was a small field, it was the size of a mountain. It would take ten minutes to walk across.

Everything was trapped in the cold.

'This is....'

It was akin to a natural disaster.

As far as the magicians knew, it was magic of an impossible scale for humans.

'...A dragon?'

A race that protects the world. Only they could achieve this level. Taesan felt satisfied with the awe and fear in their eyes.

"The preparation process was long, but it's usable."

It was a result that made the time spent experimenting worthwhile.

Taesan turned to look at the pursuers.

"Shall we continue?"

There was no reply. Taesan clicked his tongue.

"Then get lost."

* * *

Those who had lost their courage fled.

And they began to spread word of what they had seen far and wide.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"They say the one guarding the princess is a monster.

They call it the incarnation of a dragon.

Until now, it had been mere rumor. Pursuers seeking the princess had all died, thus never truly sensing its actual strength.

But this time, everyone who went returned alive.

With those who experienced it firsthand loudly proclaiming, it couldn't be dismissed as exaggerated hype.

If those who survived were weaklings, mere dust in the masses, they would have been ignored as inflated. But they all belonged to the upper echelons, making it impossible.

Rumors spread about Taesan freezing the mountain. Some say he is a swordmaster and an exceptional sorcerer, while others claim he is a disciple of the dragon.

The rumor grows longer and more elaborate.

As a result, each nation had no choice but to take action.

Until now, targeting the princess had been purely individual. There had been no movement from the collective nations. They were preoccupied with dividing the demon realm and saw no reason to target the princess."
The demons went extinct. If only the princess died, it really would have ended. It was clear that surviving alone had its limits. They would die soon anyway, so there was no need to move.

Furthermore, after Hamon dealt with the demons, there wasn't much interest shown in the princess. It was because the gods were quiet, and there was no need for us to move.

But things were different now.

Even if half of the rumors about Taesan were true, victory was impossible as individuals. Countries quietly prepared to move.

And then Hamon drove the wedge.

"Kill the demon princess and the dog."

Just as with the order to kill the demons, it was a prophecy filled with strong will.

There was no major country to resist the god who destroyed the demons. The world began to move.

Soldiers weren't sent. They realized it wasn't about groups but about strong individuals who could reach Taesan.

Each country sent their strongest forces.

Those known as Swordmasters.

"Oh."

Taesan raised the corners of his mouth with a happy face. Annette, who had been basking in the sun, suddenly stood up in surprise.

"Why are you like this?"

"I've been disappointed so far. But... this should be enough."
A strong force is felt from the other side. Even he who has penetrated the labyrinth is not a force to be underestimated.

Several of them were approaching here. They scattered their strong force as if they had no intention to hide.

Annette's face paled as she realized belatedly.

"S-Swordmasters?"

And it wasn't just one. Beyond the eastern hill, their figures began to appear.

There were four in total.

"This is the end."

If they could defeat them, there would be no one left who could touch him.

"No, this can't be..."

Annette grabbed Taesan's sleeve.

Taesan is undoubtedly monstrously strong. It would not be an exaggeration to call him the strongest human she has ever seen.

But Swordmasters are individuals who surpass human limits. Each of them could bring down an entire city.

And there were four of them.

No matter how strong Taesan is, it's daunting. Annette thought so.

"We have to run. We can't handle them. We have to run..."

Taesan soothes Annette, who stammers with a pale face.

"Just rest for a moment."

In an instant, Annette loses consciousness.

"No..."

With that thought, she collapses.

"Laugh."
Taesan takes her into the cave. He lays her on a grassy blanket and steps outside.

"Are farewells over?"

A middle-aged man with a stern expression appears. His rugged, muscular body reflects a lifetime of hard work and discipline.

"Any usable ones?"

Even the ghost gave up, saying, "Even if I break through the labyrinth, I can see many adventurers and be satisfied with their strength, and four men in front of me."

Red hair, purple hair, white hair, have th his
