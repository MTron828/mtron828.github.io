Article 339

339. 73rd floor, Great Mage Shayian (1)

Tai Shan muttered to himself after reading the description for a moment.

"Is it a designated skill initialization?"

A skill that resets the cool-down time of the skills Tai Shan had obtained in his previous life, allowing him to use it immediately.

After reading the description, Tai Shan suddenly thought of that skill. However, his eyes fell upon closer inspection.

"That level is not it."

The biggest advantage of the designated skill initialization was not resetting the cool-down time. That was just an additional ability.

The true power of the designated skill initialization was to reset the concept of using a skill itself.

For example, skills like addition or multiplication could not be used multiple times in a single attack.

That was a natural restriction. If one could infinitely stack addition in a single attack, the concept of attack power would lose all meaning.

The designated skill initialization was a skill that removed some of these restrictions.

With the skill, Tai Shan could use addition once and then reset it to use it again.
Here is the translation:

In his past life, Taesan used a designated skill initialization technique. Therefore, he was able to deal massive damage, exceeding 100,000.

However, the effect of this ring was only to initialize the cool-down time. It did not remove the constraints on attacks.

Compared to the last chance that eliminated the activation conditions of all skills, the difference was significant. If Taesan had obtained the last chance, he could have handled even the boundary without any risk.

Compared to the two skills, the level was quite different.

However, it was still a significant piece of equipment.

The ability to initialize powerful skills with long cool-down times was an excellent effect in itself.

'From now on, even this kind of equipment will be given?'

It was definitely equipment that fit the situation. Moreover, the fact that you could wear multiple rings at once made it even more valuable.

And, who knows, maybe this could be used to initialize designated skills or obtain the last chance. Although the probability was low, it was not zero.

Taesan was satisfied and checked other equipment as well.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The belt created by the master of a cruel space] [Strength + 500] [Attack power + 200] [Defense power + 500] [A belt created by the master of a cruel space who rules over a twisted space. Once, this belt flowed through the world and many strong rivers exhausted themselves to wear it.]

[The robe of the ruler] [Strength + 300] [Attack power + 180] [Defense power + 400] [A robe created for a great ruler who has been forgotten. Although it has been forgotten, the evidence of devotion to him has not disappeared yet.]

[I used it.] [I obtained the last earring of Brunnhilde.] [The last earring of Brunnhilde] [Vitality + 1500] [Mana + 200] [Strength + 300] [Agility + 300] [Intelligence + 300] [Attack power + 300] [Defense power + 300] [Saint. Brunnhilde's earring, which she barely allowed him to wear before her execution.]

Overall, these were powerful equipment, and there was no special effect other than a ring-like unique feature. It would be enough to be satisfied with this.

"So then."

Now, one more thing is left.

Tae-san touched the black form, which resembled a gemstone.

[The will to bring about extinction] [The will to bring about the extinction of the world, which exists only for the sake of the world's extinction. A very small, allowed desire has been left over.]

The source of destruction, the collection of negation, the will to bring about extinction. A high-value material item was born. Including the will's fragment, there were a total of four.

When searching for Half-Ran, Tae-san moved his steps.

* * *

"Ah, I've come."

Half-Ran greeted Tae-san. He looked at the ghost and asked,

"What's going on? The atmosphere seems to have changed."

[Yes, there is. It's a personal matter, so don't worry about it.]

"I understand."

After being told not to meddle, Half-Ran quietly left. He turned his gaze back to Tae-san.

"What's going on this time? Have you brought another material?"

(Note: Brunnhilde is a character from Germanic mythology, and the earring mentioned in the text is likely a reference to her.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"What can I do with these?"

The Taesan bestowed upon him the will to summon the origin of destruction and annihilation.

The eyes of Half-ran's gaze lit up as he looked at the origin of destruction.

"This is... astonishing."

His voice was filled with admiration.

"A collection of pure greed. 71 floors. Did you come to take over the owner of that place?"

Taesan nodded his head. Half-ran let out a dry laugh.

"Your strength is superior even in the depths. I expected it, but it's still surprising, isn't it."

Even a skilled adventurer who could easily descend 70 floors would find it difficult to enter the depths and be blocked for a long time at the 71st floor. The guides of the wicked path had done so. Although they had exceptional abilities, they were stuck at the 74th floor for a long time.

Considering this, Taesan's existence was undoubtedly unusual. After finishing his words, Half-ran confirmed the will to bring about destruction.

"...".

He looked at the black gemstone for a moment, then frowned.

"This is."

He looked at Taesan and the ghost next to him, and nodded alone.

"It's like that, isn't it."
Here is the translation of the text:

"[Did I say that? It's okay if you don't care.]"

"I understand. There's no need to congratulate me, I'm afraid."

Halfaran expressed condolences and touched the gemstone.

"I told you before, didn't I? I'm not good at handling equipment related to willpower."

"Is that so?"

"From a strength and level perspective, what you showed me before is on the same level as the willpower I've seen. I'd rather find a shortcut than rely on myself."

A madman who had taken up residence in the depths of the heart. The dwarf-like Cosrun. Halfaran said that he was first-class in handling willpower.

As Halfaran examined the gemstone, he looked at the sword of the Great Mountain.

"There's a similar level of willpower inside it too."

"I don't know how to use it, though."

The willpower that had been foretold to defeat the Demon King by devouring the Great Mountain.

It was still embedded in the sword. But it was much sleepier than before. It seemed that it had finished its task, having defeated the Demon King.

The power and level contained in the sword were undoubtedly extraordinary. Since the current Great Mountain was able to surpass mortality and defeat the Demon King, it had granted him the power to do so."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"How can I handle it so that I can become strong, but I don't know the method yet."

Half-ran looked at the sword and said, "If I take this to that guy, I can solve it."

"What's this level of crisis?"

"I said it. That's the level of a first-class person. I don't talk nonsense."

Half-ran handed the materials to Taesan again.

"I don't know exactly where it's located, but I'll be able to meet up soon. Go tell that guy to say it."

"Okay."

Taesan received the materials again.

However, he did not immediately go down to the 73rd floor. He stayed on the 72nd floor and confirmed the community.

Lee Taeyoon and Kang Junhyuk were descending the labyrinth vigorously. Although their skill level with the Authority Sword was still low, it seemed to be rising gradually, as they frequently used the Ability Sword.

As time passed, countries that had cleared the quest and returned to the labyrinth began to appear.

Most of them were small countries or neighboring countries, but it seemed that the Earth was not facing a major problem.
Here is the translation of the text:

Taisan spent a day in the 72nd floor.

After consuming the skills and stats used to defeat Ma Wang, he moved to the 73rd floor.

* * *

The interior of the 73rd floor was not significantly different from what he had seen before. As he entered deeper, he sensed that something was there, but at least for now, it was a normal maze.

However, the power he felt inside was not normal.

Ma Shin said, "The 73rd floor... something evil is waiting at the entrance."

"It's busy."

Taisan pressed against the wall of the maze. Inside, there was a tremendous amount of mana that was stored.

The mana spread out towards the wall, floor, and ceiling, forming numerous patterns.

Taisan passed through the corridor and opened the door.

As he lifted his foot and stepped forward, he sensed it.

The 73rd floor... inside, there were countless magic circles. Various magic spells combined in dozens of ways, covering the walls and ceiling.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the inner power surged and mana flowed like a waterfall, the one who possessed the unique talent that no one in the world could reach, who had devoted their entire life to magic, had finally reached the pinnacle. 

In the midst of this magic, there was an old man.

Wrapped in a robe and grasping a staff, the old man spoke in a solemn voice.

"I've come."

[You are a great wizard. You met Shayan.]

"This time, are you a wizard?"

Tai Shan muttered to himself and drew his sword.

"I've finally arrived here."

Shayan frowned.

When I first learned of Tai Shan's existence, I thought he was just one of many adventurers, and I believed that he would either fall under their rule or meet his demise within a short time.

But Tai Shan, with the blessing of the gods, had unleashed his power and arrived here.

He had defeated the leaders of the two factions and stood before them.

"Congratulations, hero. You've chosen a good tool to achieve your goal. I judged it was impossible to reach the end of the labyrinth before us, but..."

Shayan's ridicule was met with silence from the ghost.

Despite having his enemy right in front of him, the ghost's emotions were extremely calm.

Shayan noticed the abnormality and scowled.
Here is the translation of the text:

"...What was going on? I thought I would see hatred in your eyes the moment you looked at me, but it seems you've been putting a lot of effort into creating the weapon that killed you."

[That's right.]

The ghost finally opened his mouth.

[You're one of the ones who made that weapon. Well, you wouldn't have been able to make it without me getting involved.]

The ghost's emotions were still not shaken.

Shiyan, who didn't know the details, was taken aback in an instant. But he calmed down.

"I don't resent you. If you're going to do that, why did you make a contract with a mage?"

Shiyan glared at Tai Shan.

"I don't accept it. You're strong. Maybe you could even go deeper than us."

The guide to evil. The leader of the group had finally succeeded in breaking through the long-sealed 74th floor.

After that, they were descending into the labyrinth at an extremely fast pace, but Tai Shan was even faster. If you look at the growth rate, it was incomparable to theirs.

"But that's far enough."

Shiyan lowers his wooden cane. Many magic circles unfold, emitting light.

Snap.

The magic circles begin to operate.
Here is the translation of the text:

The philosophical forms of magic begin to rotate and intersect with each other. Amplifying, linking, and synchronizing, a massive power surges forth in an instant.

[Shayan has activated the fixed magical law and rule of the magic circle.] [Shayan has activated the magic circle of natural exclusion.] [Shayan has activated the magic circle of freely fluctuating mana.] [Shayan has activated the forced spatial distortion.] [Shayan has activated the vortex of the angry owner.] [Shayan has activated the magic amplification circle.] [Shayan has activated the collective gathering of all magical powers.]

However, none of these could be achieved in a short time.

It took several days for Shayan to settle down here, design and conceptualize the magic circle, and achieve the power.

"I am the eternal and immortal master of the mausoleum, who has betrayed the world, pursued a higher origin, and reached the peak of knowledge in the labyrinth of inquiry."

Shayan says, pointing to the Tai Mountain with his cane.

"As a great user of magic, I will kill you."
