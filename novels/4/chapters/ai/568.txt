Chapter 569

569. The World Destroyer (5)

Taesan confirmed the changed boundary negation.

[Transcendence: Boundary Negation] [Proficiency: 100%] [Denial of all interference. Everything that tries to interfere with you, whether it's from this world or not, will be rejected and denied, and killed.]

Taesan laughed. The content hadn't changed, but the proficiency part had changed greatly.

The proficiency of boundary negation had reached 100%.

The World Destroyer's self-immunity had been perfectly devoured. As a result, the boundary negation surrounding him had increased greatly. Even just the thickness alone was on a different dimension from before.

It would be extremely difficult for even a high-ranking god or a transcendent being to pierce through this and land an attack on Taesan. In fact, it was as if they had devoured the World Destroyer itself.

[Is there anyone who can land an attack on you?]

Barudray muttered in a tone of newfound respect.

Anyone who faced Taesan would be equivalent to facing both the abyss and the World Destroyer at the same time.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Only by piercing through the deep and profound hole and negating all interference could I land an attack on Taesan.

Even if I barely managed to pierce through the two authorities, there was still the nullification of attacks and the last chance. And there was still a long way to go before I could deal a significant blow to Taesan.

"Huff."

Taesan took a deep breath. The immutable force that surrounded his body was slowly distorting, not following his control.

He grasped and controlled it.

He gradually made the immutable force his own. Before long, the boundary negation slowly regained its stability.

And he achieved his goal.

The authority stolen from the World Destroyer became fully his.

"Good."

He had obtained perfect control. In the process, Taesan also confirmed the proficiency of another skill, which he hadn't done in a long time.

"When did this become 100%?"

[Special Passive Skill: Distorted Spirit Tuning] [Proficiency: 100%] [Distorted beings can manipulate their own spirits. They can control the spirits within themselves or those they possess, and can also use their spirits to directly influence the world.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The proficiency of the distorted aura tuning has reached 100%.

The added part is that the distorted aura denies the intervention of correct things.

It probably means that it denies the concept of the universe.

If there's a problem, it was a part that didn't have much significance to the current Taesan. Anyway, the boundary denial and the void did their job.

[Special Activation Skill: Essence Perception] [Proficiency: 100%] [Perceives the essence of the target. Can identify the source of their power and their weaknesses. Can also understand their thoughts and fundamentals. Can see the deepest part of the target. Even if the target's aura is higher than yours, you can still perceive it partially.]

The proficiency of Essence Perception has also reached 100%. Its effect is that it can easily perceive even high-aura opponents without difficulty.

However, there was no opponent with a higher aura than the current Taesan. It couldn't be said that there were any transcendents, high-ranking gods, or those below or above him."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As I checked my mastery of essential skills, I naturally thought of targeting vital spots.

[Special Activation Skill: Vital Spot Targeting] [Mastery: 97%] [Designate a part of the target as a vital spot and deal double damage when attacking it. You can target the same spot three times in a row. Additionally, the range of targets that can be designated as vital spots has increased significantly.]

"What's going on?"

Taesan was surprised. He didn't know that his mastery of vital spot targeting had already reached 97%.

"I guess that's possible."

When I thought about it carefully, it wasn't a strange occurrence at all.

A skill's mastery is based on how often you use it and what achievements you've made with it. That's the key.

Taesan had activated vital spot targeting every time he used multiplication.

Considering the attack power, it was actually strange that it hadn't reached 100% yet. He hadn't paid much attention to it, but it was a decent achievement.

The skill you can acquire when your mastery of vital spot targeting reaches 100%. Essential Strike."

Let me know if you have any further requests!

"That skill could have had meaning even for the current Taesan. The idea of piercing the essence was exactly that. If he could mix boundaries, he could even deal a proper blow to the gods.

Since the skill was in harmony with Taesan's strength and resonance, it could exert a sufficient effect.

But the other skills were not like that.

Most of Taesan's skills were subordinate to his authority and boundaries. No matter how much he trained or changed the content, it didn't have much significance.

He had become too powerful.

It was strange in itself that the skills of the labyrinth, which were originally for mortals, had any use at all.

"It's a shame."

His main skills had lost their value.

Although he had obtained a greater power and had to endure, he couldn't help but feel a sense of regret.

After roughly confirming, Taesan took off. He left the labyrinth and wandered the universe.

He didn't plan to stay still while the wizards didn't appear. He intended to track down the gods and deal with them one by one.

As he wandered the universe, he searched for the gods' traces. The universe was vast, but the powerful and immense ripples of the gods spread throughout the universe, making it not too difficult to find them."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan wandered around the universe for several days.

He crossed galaxies and saw numerous planets, expanding his senses to find the resonance of the gods.

But Taesan found nothing.

The universe was eerily quiet.

It was as if everything was peaceful, with no problems at all.

"What's going on?"

It was too quiet, even for a peaceful scene.

It really seemed like the gods had vanished from the universe.

What to do? Taesan stopped in his tracks, pondering for a moment, and then took a step forward.

[You have activated Teleport [Boundary].]

Taesan returned to the labyrinth. Before long, the wizard appeared.

"Hello, Taesan."

"Looks like you've got some free time?"

"Yeah. I don't know if this is good or bad, though."

The wizard had a very ambiguous expression.

"You must have noticed too, but the gods have gone into hiding in the universe."

"When did it start?"

"Since you defeated the World Destroyer."

"Right after that day?"

"I knew the gods would respond, but... I didn't expect it to be like this."

Taesan is a being capable of killing the gods.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And they could have taken down Gosin on their own. If things continued like this, the war would have been a guaranteed defeat for Gosin.

Gosin were not foolish or ignorant. On the contrary, they were cunning. It was fully expected that they would come up with some countermeasure.

But the fact that they were hiding their presence completely was unexpected.

"Can they really hide like that?"

"Basically, they're beings from outside the universe, so they can hide if they want to. But if they want to exert influence on the universe, they can't help but reveal themselves...‚Äù

There was no sense of their presence at all.

It was as if they didn't exist in the universe.

"If we think about it simply, it's a good thing for us."

Gosin's power was unchanging and didn't deplete. They didn't need to recover much.

But the Transcendents were different. They needed to recover their depleted authority.

It was a good thing that they could recover their depleted powers by fighting against Gosin.

But it was unsettling.

They couldn't figure out what Gosin were after, so they couldn't come up with a countermeasure.

The Transcendents were taking an uneasy rest.

"Is there nothing we can do?"

"For now, that's the case."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The magician, as if remembering something, bowed his head to Taesan.

"I didn't express my gratitude properly. Thank you."

"What for?"

"For taking care of the World Destroyer."

That was a separate matter from the quest in the labyrinth.

Taesan had taken care of the divine punishment himself, which gave the Transcendents a significant amount of leeway.

"I want to give you some kind of reward, but I need something."

"A reward."

It was already decided.

"Can you raise my skill proficiency?"

"Proficiency?"

"The proficiency of targeting vital points."

"Just a moment."

The magician snapped his fingers. After checking Taesan's proficiency status, his expression became very ambiguous.

"......I know what you're looking for."

The magician stroked his chin for a moment, but his deliberation didn't last long.

"Alright. It's not a quest, but I can do that much for you."

The magician snapped his fingers again. Taesan let out a laugh. He was obtaining the skill he had struggled to acquire in his past life as if it were nothing.

The skill's proficiency level changed.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Your proficiency in Vital Point Identification has reached 100%.] [You possess the essence of understanding, and your proficiency in essence understanding has also reached 100%.] [You have acquired the special skill [Essence Destruction].]"

"Huh?"

"The skill is different."

"It wasn't a physical attack. Taesan opened the system window.

[Special Skill: Essence Destruction] [Proficiency: 1%] [Directly affects the opponent's essence, not just dealing damage, but destroying and shattering it.]

"This is new. I've never seen it before."

In his past life, he had never reached 100% proficiency in essence understanding.

So, he had always been curious. What would happen if he reached 100% proficiency in essence understanding?

But, surprisingly, essence understanding didn't change much.

Instead, essence attacks changed to essence destruction.

"I guess you could say it's a higher-level skill."

Vital Point Identification also changed with a significant effect.

[Special Skill: Vital Point Identification] [Proficiency: 100%] [Designates a vital point on the target and deals double damage when attacking it. Can continuously designate vital points on the same target. Additionally, the range of designatable vital points has greatly expanded, allowing you to designate up to three vital points at once.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The damage didn't change from double, but the limitation on the number of critical hits disappeared. Additionally, I could now designate three critical spots at once.

At the same time, it was a significant change when it came to dealing simultaneous attacks. It was a skill related to damage, and it was valuable to Taesan as well.

"I knew that skill would change in that way, but you're the first adventurer to actually succeed. Well, it's not surprising.

From Taesan's perspective, it was a very good thing. If it was a high-level skill that dealt fundamental damage, its effect would be significant as well. It was likely to be a highly meaningful skill for him now.

"Anyway..."

I had confirmed everything I needed to.

Now I had to do something.

But what should I do?

The wizard also seemed to be worried.

"The 99th floor quest I'll give you is not much different from what you've done."

In the end, it was a high-level quest. There was no reason to give a quest unrelated to high-level quests now.

But all those high-level quests had disappeared.

Now, it was difficult to set new quests.

"Let's wait for now..."

The wizard stroked his chin.

"I'll look for some information on this side as well. Until then, take a rest."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan nodded his head. The wizard had disappeared.

Taesan, who had been staring blankly into space for a moment, wiggled his fingers.

If there's nothing to do, I'll just make something happen.

[You have activated Teleport [Boundary].]

His body transcended space and arrived.

His hometown. Earth.

Taesan, who was now on Earth, could arrive anywhere he wanted.

He looked up at the sky.

A massive hole pierced the sky.

It was currently sealed, but it hadn't disappeared. The massive hole still blocked the sky.

Taesan's eyes narrowed.

Could he block that hole now?

He had also defeated the Gatekeeper and had become even stronger. It wasn't impossible.

"Let's try it."

Taesan had just made up his mind to act when...

The universe distorted.

[Huh?] [What?]

It wasn't just Taesan who felt it. Bardley and Akasha also sensed it at that moment.

Something was twisting.

"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."

Taesan scowled.

"What's going on? This is..."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I look up at the sky. The universe is visible in a direction that is not obscured by cracks.

Innumerable stars. The stars of the solar system.

All of those things are falling.

The universe has started to collapse."

Let me know if you'd like me to help with anything else!
