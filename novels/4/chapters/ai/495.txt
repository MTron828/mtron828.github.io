**Chapter 496**

**92nd Floor. Faith (7)**

[Story. It's not bad. I'll tell you after I've stepped on you and reached the other side!]

Remidaos raises his arm. The divine energy converges around his fingers, which are trembling with divinity.

Kiiiiing.

The converged divine energy becomes a point. The point extends into a line, and the line expands into a surface.

The divine energy, now in a surface form, charges straight at Taesan.

It fills the space, crushing everything in its way. Taesan quickly dodges to the side. A deadly sensation brushes past Taesan's side.

Remidaos's attack doesn't end. Remidaos draws a curved line with his arm, and the divine energy follows his arm to chase Taesan.

"Tch."

Taesan clicks his tongue and puts more strength into his legs. He activates a speed-related skill to try and escape from the divine energy chasing him.

Kiiiiiiing!

The divine energy ravages the universe. Space tears apart, and the elements within its range are annihilated.

Kagagagak!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"No matter how fast you move, you can't be faster than your fingers. The divine power touches the back of the mountain. The self-immutable power is shaken violently.

[You have activated a limited blink.]

Tsk.

The mountain transcends space and perfectly escapes the attack range. Remidaos is amazed.

[Fast, really fast.]

The mountain lets out a laugh.

"This is an unbelievable way of using it."

The way Remidaos used the divine power was similar to the authority of the immortal wizard Wirard, which I saw in the tower of Zelvand. It was like a point, line, and surface.

But it was overwhelmingly stronger. If it had been on that orbit, even a moderate believer would have been crushed to death. It was a power that could erase an entire planet, leaving not a single speck of dust.

The mountain couldn't use the divine power in that way. It wasn't a matter of lacking technique, but a problem of the quantity of divine power.

However, despite using that much divine power, Remidaos didn't show any signs of exhaustion.

It felt like a game's mage using a cheat and casting magic without any limits. Remidaos raises his hand.

[Then, how about this?]

Kyiiiing.

The divine power converges above the mountain.

The converged divine power becomes a golden pillar and falls."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The number exceeded several hundred with ease.

Taesan grasped the trajectory of the falling pillars and leaped out of the way. He dodged through the tiny gap between the pillars.

Remidaws raised his hand. A massive divine sword hurtled towards Taesan. The boundary line on Taesan's sword was dyed with a faint glow.

The ash-colored and massive divine powers collided.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The boundary line looked like a small thread compared to Remidaws' divine power. But it didn't back down, instead pushing back against the divine power.

Taesan poured strength into his sword. The condensed boundary line exploded.

Kwa-a-a-aang!

The divine power shattered, and its fragments flew towards the universe. The sky of the planet within Remidaws' sphere of influence turned a brilliant golden color.

It was an extremely sacred and unforgettable sight. But no one gasped or cheered. They just cowered in fear, bowing their heads.

They were now simply afraid of Remidaws.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I didn't want to hear it, and I didn't want to see it. But the image of Remidao etched in my mind couldn't be erased no matter what means I used.

Some people couldn't bear it and wanted to take their own lives, but no one actually tried. It was because Remidao's anger was too terrifying.

To them, Remidao was no longer a god.

He was just something strange and twisted.

That feeling seeped into Remidao. Something different from the faith he had obtained until now filled his heart.

Remidao accepted it with great pleasure.

[Hahaha! I love it!]

Remidao swung his arm, and a massive divine wave covered the Taesan. Taesan moved his body, but couldn't perfectly dodge it.

Remidao exclaimed in an overheated tone.

[You! You can't beat me! I'm the strongest! Those who can't surpass me can't reach me!]

"Hmm."

Taesan didn't show any particular reaction.

Indeed, Remidao was strong. The faith he had received from the planet that was almost like a furnace for a very long time. The divinity created by that was, in fact, almost infinite.

That was a monster."

Note: "Taesan" is a proper noun, likely a character's name, and I've kept it as is.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If we look at it with simple power, it wouldn't lose to the Concept God either.

'But.'

The entity itself was ultimately a Faith God.

It simply had a divinity close to infinity, but the entity itself wasn't particularly special.

[……For a moment.]

Remidao, who was intoxicated with himself, comes to his senses.

Taesan was unscathed, without a single wound from his pressure.

Only then could Remidao see it. The heterogeneous aura surrounding Taesan's entire body.

That aura was blocking his attack and preventing it from reaching.

[That's.]

"You're a monster. Unless you're at the level of a Concept God, you can't win against me."

Ash-colored aura surrounds Taesan's entire body.

"But that's the same for me."

Taesan had won against a High God, albeit with the help of a Transcender and a small fragment. It wasn't a serious fight, but he had won against a Transcender.

The opponent in front of him was clearly strong.

But even so, they were a being within the boundary. They couldn't reach beyond the boundary.

And Taesan possessed the power beyond the boundary.

"I've grasped it."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"How Remidaos handles divinity is now clear. The verification is complete. Then, let's face him with full power now.

[You have activated Chaos Call.]

Chaos envelops Taesan's body.

* * *

Remidaos reflexively retreated backward, surrounded by an unfamiliar, ashen divinity. The divinity surrounding Remidaos was filled with dismay and confusion.

From that reaction, Taesan realized one fact.

"The boundary is known, but this is unknown."

Remidaos was unaware of Taesan's Chaos Domain.

"I don't know who spoke about me, but it seems they knew me from before."

Taesan readied his sword.

He stomped his foot on the ground and charged towards Remidaos in an instant.

Remidaos also quickly regained his composure and responded immediately. He unleashed a condensed divinity like a wave towards Taesan.

And Taesan didn't dodge the attack. He charged forward head-on. The divinity touched the ashen color.

[What!]

Remidaos let out a loud cry. The divinity that collided with chaos was unable to penetrate and disappeared."

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The ash-colored aura surrounding Taesan's entire body is not a simple boundary. It's a compression of the chaotic realm, limiting it to his physical body. It was a power beyond the boundary. Even if it's a divine power that's extremely condensed, it's almost impossible to pierce through it with simple divine power.

Taesan suddenly reached Remidaos's proximity. Remidaos raised his arm.

Kuuuuuuuuung!

The divine barrier was activated, trying to separate Taesan and Remidaos. Taesan infused his sword with power.

Kwaaaaaaang!

The barrier shattered. Remidaos didn't expect it to break so quickly and couldn't respond immediately. Taesan's sword clashed with Remidaos's divine aura.

Kagagagagak!

With a scraping sound, the divine aura that had taken shape began to distort.

Remidaos gritted his teeth and released all his divine power. The divine wave that shook the surroundings shook the space. In an instant, the chaotic aura that Taesan had unleashed was dispelled.

Kaang!

Taesan's body was pushed back. Remidaos didn't miss the opportunity and created distance between them.

[What the...].

Remidaos gnashed his teeth.

The sword had clashed with the divine aura he had unleashed for only a brief moment, almost an instant. Yet, in that short time, the divine power that had never decreased no matter how much power was used was reduced to a level that could be confirmed.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Remidaos was shocked by the fact, and Taesan was amazed in a different way.

"'It's a boundary where chaos calls and directly collides, and it ends with a significant reduction. That's it.'"

Chaos calls were a power beyond that. If it were a simple divine power, it could be erased instantly. Yet, it didn't reach Remidaos.

It meant that the pure divine power was abundant enough to resist the chaos calls.

"It's going to take a long time."

Taesan launched his body again.

[Die.]

With a quiet anger, the divine power exploded. It was as if the world itself was covering Taesan with divine power.

The amount of power was enough to influence the entire universe.

Compared to that power, the chaos that Taesan had was like a firefly.

The divine power that covered the universe collided with the chaos.

Kugugugung!

But it couldn't penetrate. The chaos trembled and distorted, but Taesan firmly defended against the divine power.

It was impossible to penetrate the chaos calls with simple power. It was a power that shook the very concept itself. To counter it, one had to have a corresponding level of power and concept.

But Remidaos was, in the end, a god of faith.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Despite having overwhelming divinity, his realm remains unchanged.

Kwagagaek!

Taesan opens the path. He charges towards Remidaos, unleashing magic.

The dark magic composed of ash and black magic shakes the world.

Remidaos calls upon his divinity to respond. However, due to the difference in realm, he is slowly being pushed back.

Kwaddeuk.

As a result, Remidaos allows himself to be struck once again.

His divinity, which had momentarily dwindled, begins to fade again. Remidaos lets out a roar of anger, shaking the universe.

[How dare you! How dare you! How dare you!]

Taesan laughs. The more angry he becomes, the better it is for him. Anger makes one lose their reason.

However, Remidaos was not foolish enough to do so.

He gathers the faith of the planet's inhabitants and possesses a power worthy of his stature. If he were foolish from the start, he wouldn't have made it this far.

Remidaos thinks to himself while still angry:

"That guy is handling a power from a higher realm than mine."

However, he is not fully in control of it. If he were, he would have been lying on the ground as a corpse a long time ago.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"...But isn't the power beyond the line not one's own?"

I don't know how it's possible, but if that's the case, I could understand it.

"The one who handles it is the author."

That power was not a complete divine faith.

Then...

Remidaos manifested his divinity. It was the same as before, but somehow different.

The total amount of divinity and its concentration rose above Remidaos' head. The towering mountain that was about to charge forward suddenly stopped.

It was a concentration that surpassed the limits, more than ever before. It was a collection of divinity as bright as the sun.

Kuuuuuuung!

It flew straight towards the mountain.

The mountain chose to dodge instead of taking the hit, and Remidaos revealed his fist as he saw this.

Kwaaaaaaang!

The divinity exploded and covered the mountain.

The extremely compressed divinity shook the world and engulfed the mountain. The mountain's chaos-imbued defense tried to withstand it, but it couldn't and was stripped away. And the cracks in his self-protection quickly spread.

The damage accumulated in his self-protection from blocking the divinity until now had exceeded the limit.

Zzzt zzzt zzzt!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As the self-destructive power bursts out, its impact directly covers the mountain.

[Your first attack has been nullified.]

The attack is erased. The mountain quickly dodges and escapes the explosion's range.

'I've got it.'

The boundary and chaos that the mountain handles are clearly beyond the realm of the gods.

However, the mountain, which is still unable to grasp the concept of a god, let alone reach the level of a complete faith god, is consuming a considerable amount of power to control it.

Until now, Remidaos has been wielding divine power recklessly. Since the power is not concentrated, it cannot pierce through the chaos.

But if it concentrates like that, the chaos that the mountain is handling can be pierced through sufficiently. It's comparable to a god, but there's a clear difference within. Remidaos is a complete faith god, while the mountain is not.

Of course, the cost of using power would be much greater for Remidaos, but it has the divine power to withstand it. It's a unique tactic that only Remidaos can use.

[You will lose to me!]

'No way.'

The powers collide again. The ash-colored and divine energies shake the universe."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And everyone on the planet was watching that scene.

"Ah...?"

Remidaws had shut off all external senses and was genuinely pressuring Taesan. The anger and pressure that directly stimulated people's brains had slightly subsided. As a result, the figure of Taesan fighting Remidaws came into view.

Taesan's power was of a kind that they couldn't understand.

The strange, ash-colored power made them feel an instinctive sense of rejection.

However, despite that, Taesan was still facing off against Remidaws. They were fighting against an existence that was crushing their spirits with fear.

"Ah...".

People closed their eyes and clasped their hands together.

Taesan was not the Remidaws they had served.

But that didn't matter. Taesan was trying to defeat Remidaws. That alone made people want to believe in Taesan.

The faith of the people began to gather towards Taesan, the individual, rather than the being known as Remidaws.
