Chapter 182

182. The World of the Arrogant Giant (8)

The long battle is impossible.

All attacks have been nullified, and I'm left with barely half my remaining stamina. Even if I recover my stamina with a potion, I couldn't find a way to recover the consumed magic and skills.

However, the biggest problem was that the duration of the Sacred Seal was almost over.

So, I had to end the monster during the remaining duration of the Sacred Seal.

Pffft!

The thorns rushed towards the back of the mountain. The mountain focused its mind.

The strong sense of fatigue and exhaustion caused my body to twist again.

The thorns on the mountain's back couldn't penetrate the concentrated energy and bounced back.

The mountain struck the monster's body with a large sword, twisting it forcefully.

Kwajijik.

The sword sprayed out a liquid and tore the monster's body even larger.

[Dealt 4042 damage to the monster.]

The mountain, who had used up all his strength, poured fire onto the monster's wound. The monster's body contorted in pain.

At the same time, another thorn flew towards me.
Here is the translation:

You suddenly activated a random blink.

Clang!

Move in the opposite direction of the thorn's attack and thrust the sword in again, holding it steady.

After thrusting the sword in again, tear it out and scatter flames. The monster's body begins to burn.

Kurururur!

The monster's body shook violently.

The room began to shake violently, as if it might collapse. At the same time, the thorns began to charge again.

As the monster attacked, Taesan focused on defending with his sacred power again.

At the same time, the monster's powerful blows and exhaustion made Taesan's body waver slightly.

"It's no use anymore."

Taesan barely managed to regain his composure. The distorted sacred power adjustment was a significant burden on his mental strength. If he continued to use it like this, he might really collapse.

Taesan used only the minimum defense to cut down the monster.

Gashes began to appear on the monster's body.

Wooo!

The monster howls in pain. The thorns swirl around and rush at Taesan with a force like a storm.

Kuung!

Taesan lowered his shield.
Here is the translation of the text:

You used the shield of Aigis for 1 second, making you immune to all damage, but you couldn't move.

Ka ka ka ka!

A storm of sharp thorns swept across the mountain.

The mountain didn't receive any damage and moved again after 1 second, biting into the monster's flesh.

Black sticky liquid spread out like a swamp, sticking to the mountain's ankles. When it touched the body, a horrifying mental shockwave seeped into the mountain's head.

"Ah, no way."

The mountain shook it off lightly.

At this point, it was impossible for mental attacks to take effect.

The mountain inserted the sword again.

Buzz buzz.

The monster's body trembled greatly. The impact was so severe that its tentacles suddenly stopped moving.

The mountain judged it was an opportunity and pulled out the twin swords, plunging them deeply into the monster's body. The black sticky liquid emitted a squelching sound as it gushed out without hesitation.

The monster was on the brink of death.

And, as usual, a space opened up above the monster's head, and a black energy was released towards the monster.

The mountain watched the scene calmly.

When the monster, rejuvenated by the received power, began to regenerate, the space shook violently.
Here is the translation of the text:

The massive barrier that had been supporting the monster began to tremble uneasily. It was as if a container holding more than its capacity was cracking open.

"Indeed."

The monster's regenerative power was the direct intervention of the gods.

There was a limit to how much interference one could make in an area outside of one's own domain. The gods were guarding that boundary line with great care.

And then, the monster was revived once more, and the boundary line collapsed.

As a result, a new existence emerged.

"Crack!"

The moment the gods overstepped their bounds, a being that had been waiting for an opportunity appeared. A hand shot out from that location, tearing a large hole in space.

As space split apart, a being with starlight-filled eyes appeared.

"It's late."

Taesan muttered to himself and drew his sword.

The god of magic had descended upon this place.

* * *

"Uaaaah!"

The giant let out a roar and swung a hammer at the monster. The monster did not dodge the giant's attack.

Kkkaaa!

"Kuuh!"

Instead, the hammer was swung by the giant who had been struck.

The giant gritted his teeth.

"What's with this...?"

They were being overwhelmed by the monsters.
Here is the translation of the text:

They were only able to defeat B-grade monsters and had no chance of winning against A-grade ones. Although they were aware that their opponents were much stronger than themselves, they could only hold on by making adjustments. However, this was already reaching its limits.

The giants began to fall one by one. Among the giants that numbered in the hundreds, half had already died.

On the other hand, they had only defeated five monsters.

While it was an impressive feat that they had defeated five A-grade monsters with their strength, the situation was still hopeless.

"Warriors, ..."

Their situation was only getting worse. Their clothes were torn to shreds, and their hair was a mess.

The monster that had been suppressed by the sticky liquid suddenly lurched violently. At the same time, the liquid spread out like a wave and attacked the giants.

The warriors hastily gathered and raised their hands.

A massive magical barrier was created.

Kuuuung!

The liquid hit the barrier, accompanied by a deafening sound, and a small crack began to spread.

The warriors strained their strength even further, but the crack continued to grow and spread.

"It's over."

The Giant King smiled cruelly.

The gamble had failed.

At that moment, he was calmly accepting defeat.

Uuuung!
Here is the translation of the text:

The monster's aura, which had been continuously striking against the barrier, began to slowly dissipate.

The Giant King's eyes sparkled.

He released the power he had been using to create the barrier. The aura that had spread all over the world left only a faint residue and disappeared.

"What?"

"This power is..."

It was not just the Giant King who realized this. The giant warriors and monsters who were fighting each other suddenly stopped their attacks and looked towards the castle.

Something enormous had directly descended upon this place.

The Giant King laughed.

"Not too late, are you, god of magic?"

*

[This feels good.]

The god of magic stood with his feet on the ground, laughing.

[It's been a long time since I've been to my hometown. I couldn't come to this place because of something so trivial. I really like it.]

"Was it really the interference of the high gods?"

The god of magic is a giant. He is from the world of arrogant giants, from the land of Valthoria.

However, he had never appeared in this place before.

It can be seen that the god of magic had a strong attachment to his hometown, as he had been given a mission by himself.

It was clear that something was interfering, and the Taesan thought it was the high gods.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, those annoying things have been blocking my return. I'd like to kill those giants, but..."

The god of magic smiled happily as he waved his hand.

"That's the end of it, I suppose."

A space opened up on the monster's head and then closed.

"Of course, as expected. Kang Tae-san. You've done exactly as I wanted. By making the monster stronger, I've forced you to keep killing it, and that's made it possible for me to return. Thanks to that, I was able to come back."

The god of magic seemed to be laughing with joy.

"I'll express my gratitude. Kang Tae-san. It's rare for a god to express gratitude to humans, so I'll consider it an honor."

Clank.

The rift created by the god of magic disappeared, but the monster had already regrown. The monster moved its tentacles and sent thousands of thorns flying towards Kang Tae-san and the god of magic.

"I'll leave it to you."

The god of magic didn't even glance at the monster's attack.

The thorns approaching the god of magic all turned to dust and disappeared.

"I have something to take care of myself."

"I'll do it my way."

"That's what I'll say, but for now, it's a bit tough, isn't it?"
Here is the translation of the text:

The apostle had been released, and his physical and mental strength had reached rock bottom. Now, it was impossible to counter the monster, let alone have a chance to win. The god of magic, who had listened to the words of the Taesan, shook his finger.

"Don't worry."

The god of magic had bestowed his power on the Taesan.

"You have reached the highest state. You have learned the intermediate magic 'Frozen World.' The usage will come naturally."

The Taesan suddenly gained all information about magic, including its effects and power, as soon as Jerbrand's words ended. It was one of the most powerful intermediate magics, and he was pleased.

"...Thank you."

The Taesan nodded his head with a sigh.

"I'll go do my job then."

Jerbrand smiled and left.

The Taesan gazed at the monster, which was trembling with fear. Up until now, it had been a formidable opponent, worthy of risking one's life to counter, but it was no longer a threat.

Ku-kung-kung-kung!

The monster's scales began to move, and thousands of thorns flew towards him again.

"You have activated the Frozen World."

Tze-tze-tze-tze!

Space froze.

A chilling aura was directed at the monster, and the space that had been crumbling due to the battle's aftermath froze, halting its collapse.
Here is the translation of the text:

Suddenly, a vast and static space was created.

The monster's state after being hit by magic was miserable. All its tentacles were frozen and unable to move.

The monster tried to attack Taesan by twisting its frozen tentacles roughly and shooting thorns, but the one who had subdued the monster blocked it.

Taesan smiled and approached the monster.

* * *

Meanwhile, the god of magic moved in front of the giant king. The giants all stared blankly at Jerbrand.

"What is the current king? Nice to meet you."

The giant king, staring blankly at Jerbrand, opened its mouth.

"It's just like what I read in a book, a very small army."

Jerbrand's size was similar to Taesan's. It was a size that couldn't be considered the same as a giant.

"Right. I was a weak and fragile existence who received everyone's pity."

Jerbrand smiled wryly and raised its hand.

"I've received a lot from you, so I should return it."

Here is the translation of the text:

His massive power burst forth from his hand and reached the giants. As soon as his power reached them, the giants were able to feel an overflowing sense of power.

"Oh, oh, oh..."

A vast amount of knowledge flooded into their minds. They were recalling things they had forgotten for a long time, including magic-related things.

Whoosh.

At the same time, the sky split open and a legion of monsters poured out.

Each of these monsters was on par with the slimes that the Demon Generals had fought against.

[It's futile to resist, but it's already too late.]

Jerован smiled, laughing to himself.

The Giant King gazed calmly at his fist.

He had stopped using his mental attacks to block his power a long time ago.

"How long has it been since I've been able to feel my true strength?"

He stood up. He waved his hand towards the S-grade monsters rushing towards him.

The sky opened up and starlight shone down.

Each starlight had the power to shape the earth and distort space. The S-grade monsters were instantly engulfed by the light and disappeared. Some tried to survive the falling light, but they were crushed by the remnants of the light that continued to shine.

Dozens of S-grade monsters.
Here is the translation of the text:

In the previous life, the monsters that Taesan and Itealyeon had barely managed to deal with were all settled in one blow.

The Giant King laughed. He clenched his fist.

"Disappear!"

Kuuhuu!

The Giant King's power spread to every corner of the world.

The cracks that had been standing in each territory one by one were crushed by the power and disappeared.

In no time, all the cracks that existed in Bahulia disappeared.

Kuuhuu!

At the same time, a huge wave was felt inside the castle.

[I think it's over there too.]

A short while later, a black, sticky Taesan appeared.

Taesan spoke calmly.

"The quest is complete. Oh, god of magic."

[I've done it.]

The god of magic smiled widely.
