Chapter 549

549. The Treasure Box of the Usurper (7)

The Usurper.

It's a god.

Taesan quickly created distance between them. He gazed at the Usurper, who was staring back at him with an unblinking gaze.

"...Isn't that the real Usurper?"

The god had said. The Usurper, along with other gods, was also in the state of breaking the seal and entering the treasure box. It wouldn't be guarding the inside of the treasure box.

What Taesan felt from the Usurper in front of him was a sense of incompleteness.

It was as if a part of him was missing. The Usurper laughed, as if he had read Taesan's thoughts.

[Just as you expected. I'm the warehouse keeper who guards the warehouse and catches thieves. You can think of me as a part of him.]

"A part, you say."

The Usurper had created a separate part of himself to guard the treasure box. Since he was originally a warehouse keeper, his power and aura weren't that great.

But he was undoubtedly a part of the Usurper.

Taesan observed his opponent.

Neither human nor monster, it was a distorted form that couldn't be classified as belonging to this world or the gods.

It was like a thousand faces merged into one.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's the essence of the usurper."

[But... it's amazing. How did you manage to get here? You were perfectly hidden, and even I couldn't detect you.]

The usurper was surprised by the fact that Taesan had found the treasure box. For a moment, he pondered the reason, and his gaze fell on Taesan's fingers.

[...I see.]

The usurper muttered to himself, seemingly amazed.

[Thanks to you, I've regained my true self. No, it's not that. The concept is still here, so... I've regained my self-awareness. That's what revealed the location of this place.]

The usurper laughed cheerfully.

[When you intervene, the result can turn out like this. I need to change the location of the box again.]

"It's too long-winded."

Taesan gripped his sword tightly, and his willpower materialized, pressuring the usurper.

The usurper smiled and opened his mouth.

[There's no need for us to fight.]

Note: The translation is based on the assumption that the text is from a fantasy or adventure novel, and some terms may have specific meanings within that context.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

At those words, Taesan hesitated. The usurper continued to speak.

[How about making a deal? Won't you join hands with me?]

"Nonsense."

Taesan rejected him. He and the usurper were enemies. They could never join forces.

But the usurper spoke softly.

[You seem to be misunderstanding something. I and that guy are different entities. I'm stuck in this role as a warehouse keeper for my entire life, while he's just a discarded trash.]

"……."

[I hate him. Even though we're the same, I'm trapped in here, while he's free to roam outside and fulfill his desires.]

The usurper's expression twisted in distaste.

[I hate it. I also want to break free from this suffocating box and walk my own path.]

"Is it possible to express such a self, even partially?"

[It would normally be impossible, but I've been around for too long. At this point, it's not strange for a self to emerge.]

The usurper spoke in a light tone.

[What do you think, adversary? Will you join hands with me and trample him?]

"Then tell me. What's the method?"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's better to use what you can use. Taesan asked. The usurper said with a smile.

[It's simple. If you get eaten by me, that's it.]

"What?"

[If I devour you and use your body as a vessel, I'll be able to act. That's it. You'll get your revenge on the usurper, and I'll gain freedom. Isn't that neat?]

"What nonsense are you talking about?"

Taesan let out a dry laugh.

He thought he could use the proposal to his advantage, but he only wasted time.

The opponent was a monster. It was impossible to make a deal with a twisted and distorted existence like that. Instead of answering, Taesan raised a cloud of ash.

[Is that a refusal? I guess I have no choice.]

The usurper looked genuinely disappointed and raised his finger.

[Then I'll just crush you with my own hands and usurp your power.]

Whoosh. The ash cloud enveloped Taesan.

In a place where numerous concepts were scattered, Taesan took a fighting stance.

[You're strong.]

The usurper let out a pure and innocent cheer.

[Although I can't read his true nature, I can tell he's strong. I can have a decent fight with him. He's far stronger than someone like me.]

The usurper's part wasn't strong.

Note: The translation tries to maintain the nuances and tone of the original text, but some phrases may sound a bit awkward in English due to the differences in language structure and cultural context.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was as if I was a warehouse keeper, and I was close to being a fragment. I could have won without any problems.

[If I were to take that, I would be extremely happy.]

But the usurper didn't think about his defeat at all. He smiled and welcomed Taesan.

[Come on. Enemy.]

* * *

Kuuing!

Taesan's footwork was incredibly fast, and his low-level concept was difficult to grasp. His sword was aimed at the usurper's neck.

And the usurper responded lightly.

He waved his hand, and the scattered concepts were realized according to the warehouse keeper's will.

Kiiing!

A thick, black powder spread out to protect the usurper.

Taesan ignored it and swung his sword. His sword had a boundary attached to it, and he could pierce through any ordinary power at any time.

Kagagagak!

But it didn't pierce through.

Taesan's eyes wavered. The black powder clung to the boundary, trying to erode it.

The powder surged up and engulfed Taesan.

Kagagagak!

A boundary denial occurred. It was trying to intervene with itself and devour it."

Note: The text appears to be a fantasy or action-oriented passage, and some of the terms and concepts may not have direct English translations. I've done my best to provide a natural-sounding translation, but some nuances may be lost in translation.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But the black powder doesn't budge.

Like poison, it seeps into the cracks of the boundary and slowly corrupts and decays its essence.

Taesan gathered the boundary and burst it. The boundary exploded like a bomb, pushing the powder away.

Damn it.

Taesan quickly created some distance.

"What's going on?"

The boundary negation couldn't push it away.

The two became one, and even the worthless might of the apostle couldn't have any influence on it. Unless it was a concept directly handled by a transcender or a high god, it was impossible to respond to the boundary negation.

In other words, it was one thing.

That black powder was the authority of a transcender who dominated a complete concept.

The usurper waved their hand, and the black powder condensed to form a sphere.

And then it exploded.

It swept forward in a fan-shaped trajectory.

"What kind of authority is this?"

It was difficult to accurately grasp what kind of authority it was, as it was distorted and twisted.

Then, as a basic measure, Taesan gathered his mana.

[You have activated the Great Collapse.]

Kuuuuung!

The Great Collapse, which had been realized in the world, collided with the fan-shaped black powder that was spreading.

And Taesan saw it.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The great collapse was rotting away in an instant, crumbling to pieces.

It couldn't even put up a last bit of resistance, and the great collapse was annihilated. The mountain range burst into a grayish hue, blocking the black dust.

'I see.'

This was the power of decay.

The concept of the transcendent being who could decay everything and make it rot, was being manipulated by the usurper.

Kwagagaga!

The dust of decay swept across the land. The mountain range burst its boundaries. The black dust and grayish hue collided, canceling each other out.

[Die, pierced.]

And the usurper didn't stop. A new power was realized.

A long, thin line was drawn in the air.

The usurper lightly waved their hand, and the line charged towards the mountain range.

The mountain range's instincts warned it.

It couldn't be avoided.

No matter how it moved, that line would pierce through the mountain range. That was a power of certain destruction.

Then.

'Come with me.'

Kuheuhehung!

The beast of the boundary appeared.

The joyful, rampaging beast bared its fangs at the line. The beast of the boundary and the line collided.

Kagagagak!

And the one who emerged victorious was, of course, the beast of the boundary.

It broke and shattered the line."

Please note that the translation may not be perfect, and some nuances may be lost in translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[I knew it roughly, but it's beyond my imagination.]

The plunderer speaks calmly and takes a step back.

Dozens of lines appear in the air.

And then they all fire at once.

The beast crouches down, then lets out a howl. The howling, filled with a sense of boundary, shatters the lines and crushes them.

Not all the lines break. Some withstand the howling and try to pierce through the mountain.

The mountain holds up its sword.

Ka-ga-ga-kak!

The line collides with Bardray and breaks. It shakes its body and sends out a shockwave.

All the remaining lines shatter.

And the dust of corruption seeps into the cracks.

It clings to the mountain, trying to corrupt its essence and make it rot away. The boundary's injustice is instantly tainted.

Kwaaaang!

The mountain shakes its body violently. The physical force containing the boundary repels the corruption.

[Up to this point, it's no problem.]

The plunderer thinks lightly and makes a decision.

[I will oppress you.]

With the declaration, the authority is activated. The authority of oppression that exists in the universe.

The mountain is oppressed.

Note: There are some Korean terms and names that may not have direct English translations, so I've kept them as close to the original as possible. Additionally, the text appears to be a fantasy or action-oriented passage, so some of the language and imagery may be intentionally dramatic or exaggerated.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The body, spirit, and soul. All three are trampled and suppressed. The stern emperor's control oppresses the Taesan.

Taesan has given power to his entire body.

The ash-colored energy explodes. Taesan breaks free from all the oppressive forces controlling him with his power.

Blame.

[You have activated acceleration.]

Taesan quickly takes a step forward. In an instant, he dashes forward and thrusts his sword.

The usurper lightly raises his hand.

[You are being expelled.]

Kuuuuung!

Taesan's body is forcibly repelled and sent flying.

He is forcibly expelled at a certain distance from the usurper and instantly becomes distant.

"What's going on?"

The boundary anomaly still remained. Regardless of that, Taesan's existence itself was forcibly excluded by the usurper.

"The power of expulsion?"

It seemed like that concept.

Kagagagak!

Taesan forcibly fixes his flying body with his sword. He breaks the power of expulsion that excludes himself, pulling it up with his spiritual energy.

"I expected as much."

Taesan clicks his tongue.

The usurper usurps the concept of the world.

All the concepts he usurped were in the treasure box.

The countless concepts of the universe, accumulated from the ancient war."

Note: The translation may not be perfect, and some phrases may sound a bit awkward in English. This is because the original text is written in a style that is unique to Korean fantasy novels, which can be difficult to translate directly into English.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[I've killed countless Transcendents outside and stolen their concepts. Everything is here.]

There are countless authorities.

A complete concept that affects the universe itself is realized in the hands of the Usurper. The number is not one.

[You're strong. You can't be compared to someone like me. But... this is my domain.]

Kukukuku...

The universe's concepts, scattered like trash, resonate with the Usurper.

[At least here, you can't defeat me.]

The Usurper laughed.

[Come. My arch-nemesis. Come and be reconciled with my vessel.]

* * *

The dust of corruption covers the domain. It's densely packed, with no gaps, and compresses the space.

Kwaaaang!

The Great Mountain gathers its boundaries. The boundaries slowly lose their color and become worthless.

And it's wielded just like that.

The dust of corruption touches the worthless and disappears, creating a path.

But it's impossible to run along that path.

[If I block the power of corruption, what will happen then.]

The Usurper speaks lightly and waves their hand. Then, the authorities scattered like trash resonate with the will of the Warehouse Keeper and rise up.

Kiiiiing!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A white canvas is drawn in the world.

And it charges straight towards the Taesan, without a single gap, trying to push the entire space away.

"What kind of power is this again?"

Taesan grumbles and focuses his mind.

He concentrates more on the boundary contained in one sword, making it even more solid.

Taesan swings his sword, and the beast howls.

Quadruple crack!

The canvas is torn apart like aluminum foil, and Taesan takes off the white canvas.

And a new power fills that place.

"How much has been stolen."

Taesan clicks his tongue.

The powers that the thief is handling now are enormous concepts that penetrate the universe itself.

He is handling more than five of them.

It means that he has destroyed a transcendent being who ruled over at least five complete concepts.

It's strong.

You can't underestimate each of the powers that the thief is handling now. They are complete powers in themselves, like the gods of victory, selection, and magic. If it weren't for that, they would have been torn apart and destroyed at the boundary.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And it's diverse. When Taesan nullifies one authority, he pulls out another. He continues to fight from a advantageous position.

He handles numerous authorities and continues to pull out new cards.

It was like Taesan.

'I wonder if the guys who were against me until now felt this way.'

An opponent who handles multiple authorities. The usurper was even more so than Taesan. He truly wielded countless diverse concepts.

'But.'

The usurper couldn't fully grasp the concepts of this world.

It was only an imitation at best.

Then, he could be crushed at any moment."
