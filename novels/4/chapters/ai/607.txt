Chapter 608

608. Easy Mode. After the Third Return (2)

Taesan was a person who was known for not showing much emotional change to others.

Even when he was fighting for his life or arguing with Choi Jung-hyuk, his facial expression didn't change much.

But that didn't mean he had an unchanging heart.

There was always anger inside him.

Why did I choose easy mode?

Why can't I have more power than this?

Why do you guys give up so easily?

All sorts of negative emotions flooded in, and one by one, they were sorted out. And at the very bottom, one emotion was stuck.

Revenge.

Taesan's eyes fluttered.

He would trample the earth, forcefully lock up this damn world, and distort their peaceful lives. He would not accept a meaningless death.

He would become stronger.

And he would take revenge on the bastard who created this damn world.

Note: "이지 모드" (Easy Mode) is likely a reference to a game or a situation where the difficulty level is set to "easy", but in this context, it seems to be used metaphorically to describe Taesan's frustration with his current situation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

If I had a power that surpassed a certain level, I could ride the waves of emotions that were about to overflow.

Pfft.

The mountain of trials was about to erupt.

He would survive and become stronger.

* * *

The plan was already set in motion. In reality, the mental preparation had been completed a long time ago. It was just that he couldn't focus on understanding the situation and dealing with the aftermath because he was too busy.

He had to get stronger. No matter what.

So, how could he get stronger?

Four methods immediately came to mind.

Level. Stats. Items. Skills.

After a brief moment of contemplation, Taesan opened the community chat.

[Taesan[Easy] : Hey, Jungnue.] [Jungnue[Hard] : Yeah, what's up, hyung?]

Jungnue was a hard-mode player who was close to Taesan. As they were from the same hometown of Anyang, they easily became friends with Kim Hwi-yeon.

Taesan, who was reminded of Kim Hwi-yeon and felt a pang of sadness, asked Jungnue:

[Taesan[Easy] : What's your current level?] [Jungnue[Hard] : Uh... why suddenly?] [Taesan[Easy] : I need to check something.] [Jungnue[Hard] : It's 21.]

Jungnue replied with a puzzled expression, but answered straightforwardly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"21st level. He is now 27th level. His level was higher than before.

[Kang Tae-san [Easy] : What's the floor number?] [Geum Jung-geun [Hard] : It's the 20th floor.]

20th floor. It was a floor that wasn't even half of Tae-san's current level.

The floor number was low, and the level was low too.

Tae-san asked the final question.

[Kang Tae-san [Easy] : Then, how about his strength stat?] [Geum Jung-geun [Hard] : It's 247.] [Kang Tae-san [Easy] : ……I see.]

Tae-san let out a dry laugh.

His level and floor number were lower than Tae-san's, but his stat was about six times higher.

The difficulty of Easy mode was ridiculously easy. The rewards for clearing the labyrinth were pitifully small.

With stats and levels, there was a clear limit to what he could do.

Even if he cleared the 100th floor, the increase in stats was predictable. He even thought about level grinding, but if there was a certain level difference with the monsters, he couldn't get experience points.

These two methods were impossible.

Then, there was the item.

There were numerous items in the labyrinth. Some could be obtained during the process of clearing the labyrinth, and some could be purchased through the store.

Tae-san looked at his sword."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Sharp Longsword] [Very Sharp Longsword.] [Attack Power +12] [Gang Tae-san [Easy]: How much is your current weapon's attack power?] [Geum Jung-geun [Hard]: Ah, 57.]

Tae-san let out a sigh.

The difference in stats and equipment numbers was enormous.

Even if he went down to the labyrinth, it didn't seem like he could get special equipment. That was a natural limitation of being in easy mode.

Geum Jung-geun, being on the 20th floor, would become even stronger.

On the other hand, he was already on the 50th floor.

This wouldn't do.

He needed to get the power to escape easy mode.

Then, what could that be?

Tae-san, who was deep in thought, opened his mouth.

"Skill window."

The system window appeared, covering his vision.

[Special Passive Skill: Expanded Vision] [Proficiency: 14%] [Can obtain a wide range of vision. Still within the range of human vision.] [Special Passive Skill: Composure] [Proficiency: 10%] [Unwavering mental state. Will not be flustered unless a being beyond human understanding appears. Gains judgment correction.] [Special Passive Skill: Insight] [Proficiency: 14%] [Can perceive many things. Seems to be able to perceive only the weaknesses of living beings for now.]

Taesan asked Junggeun again.

[Taesan (Easy): Did you get the sight expansion?] [Junggeun (Hard): Yes, I got it around the 12th floor.] [Taesan (Easy): Can you tell me about its effect?] [Junggeun (Hard): Ah, don't you have it too, hyung?] [Taesan (Easy): I'm just checking something for a moment.]

Junggeun explained the effect of the sight expansion he had obtained.

The content was the same as what Taesan had.

After that, they did a few more checks. What kind of feeling did they have when they got the sight expansion?

[Junggeun (Hard): How can I put it? Suddenly, my sight expanded greatly. Should I say my field of vision increased? Anyway, it was an amazing feeling.] [Taesan (Easy): Yeah.]

Taesan also had the same sensation when he got the sight expansion.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Gang Tae-san [Easy]: I said I couldn't get it even after trying to figure it out.] [Geum Jung-geun [Hard]: Yeah. How do you get it? It sounds really good when you hear the boss's words, but I don't know how to get it.] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: What are you two talking about?] [Gang Tae-san [Easy]: Aren't you going down to the labyrinth?] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: I don't want to. I hate going down. I want to rest like this.]

Lee Tae-yeon grumbled. She was an Alone mode player, and no one could meet her. Tae-san asked her.

[Gang Tae-san [Easy]: Did you say you got it?] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Yeah, what about it? Why?] [Gang Tae-san [Easy]: Tell me the effect once.]

Lee Tae-yeon explained the effect of the skill with a puzzled expression.

It was the same as the effect of the insight Tae-san had.

[Gang Tae-san [Easy]: That's it.]

Tae-san's eyes narrowed further. The answer was getting closer.

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Anyway, guys. My current situation is... These weird pig-headed people keep...…]

Lee Tae-yeon continued to complain as if she had been waiting for it. Tae-san and Geum Jung-geun listened to her story with moderate interest.

If it were usual, they would have ignored her and done their own work, but now it was right after returning.

They were all exhausted.

They wanted to take a break, even if it was just for a little while.

After a few hours, Lee Tae-yeon's complaints finally ended. Just as they were about to turn off the community and take a break, Geum Jung-geun asked.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Geumjunggeun[Hard]: Hyung, are you okay?] [Gangtaesan[Ezi]: What's up.] [Geumjunggeun[Hard]: No... just... I can kind of guess why you're asking me. How are you doing now?] [Gangtaesan[Ezi]: I'm doing fine. It's nothing.]

Taesan responded indifferently. It seemed like Geumjunggeun's bitter laughter could be heard from beyond the community.

[Geumjunggeun[Hard]: That's unfortunate.]

In Geumjunggeun's eyes, Taesan was strong.

It wasn't just about stats or equipment. Taesan was a strong person in the true sense.

He had taken on players like Choi Joonghyuk in Ezi mode by himself. As a result, he had killed Choi Joonghyuk, who had wielded immense influence, with his own hands. It was something that even skilled Hard mode players couldn't do.

And he had acquired the elusive skills of Huli and Ganpalaran, which no one else had obtained. Only two people possessed those two skills: Lee Taeyeon and Gang Taesan.

Hard mode players complained about the difficulty, but to Geumjunggeun, it was just an empty boast.

Still, wasn't there a way to get stronger? If you risked your life and fought, wouldn't you gain something?

Gang Taesan couldn't get any stronger.

He was an Ezi mode player, after all.

Geumjunggeun found that too unfortunate.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Geumjunggeun[Hard]: If you weren't in easy mode, but in hard mode...]" "[Gangtaesan[Easi]: It's okay.]"

Gangtaesan cut off the conversation coldly.

"[Gangtaesan[Easi]: If there's nothing more to say, I'll leave.] [Geumjunggeun[Hard]: ……Okay, sorry.]"

Taesan turned off the community.

If he weren't in easy mode, but in hard mode, what would have happened?

It was a repetitive and meaningless conversation.

He was, after all, an easy mode player.

So, he would get stronger as an easy mode player.

That was his goal.

Taesan quickly organized his thoughts.

* * *

The path was set. In fact, there was only one from the beginning.

Skill.

Skill was a system that had a fixed effect regardless of the mode. The easy mode Taesan and the hard mode Geumjunggeun. The two had the same effect of securing their field of vision.

Unlike stats and equipment, it was a system of the labyrinth that wasn't affected by difficulty.

Even in easy mode, he had the power to get stronger, just like in hard and alone modes.

Of course, there were still countless problems to consider.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's still unclear how to acquire skills. The skills people have obtained so far have been more like coincidental byproducts.

What is the method of acquiring skills?

How many types of skills are there?

How many skills can be acquired?

All of these were unknown. No one had delved into such detailed conditions just to survive.

I, alone, had to grasp the conditions for acquiring skills, the effects of skills, and how to enhance them. I had to analyze and understand everything.

It was a mentally exhausting task.

And even if I managed to grasp the skills, it was unclear whether I could really become stronger.

Skills are the same regardless of mode, but there are clear differences in the stats and equipment that can utilize those skills.

I had to obtain a skill that could ignore all those restrictions and conditions.

It was a condition that could be said to be impossible, 100% impossible.

But I was willing to try.

The impossible is not impossible.

There is a possibility.

That alone was worth investing in. At the very least, it was worth more than waiting for a meaningless death here.

"Let's try it once."
