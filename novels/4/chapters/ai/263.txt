264. Activation of Special Skill. Absolute Judgment (1)

Taesan was surprised.

"Are you giving me two things?"

Of course, Taesan had accomplished a significant feat.

Having defeated a powerful spirit directly, it was only natural to receive substantial rewards.

However, even considering that, the value of intermediate dark magic was immense. Immediately after saving the world of giants with the Magic God, Zervand, Taesan had received only one reward.

Moreover, as an additional reward for defeating the spirit, he had received the transformation into an apostle and the evolution of the ring. He had not expected to receive one more here.

"I intended to give you only one. But didn't I say? They intervened."

Demons.

Entities who deal with dark magic itself.

"They took an interest in you. And that's almost a favor. To be precise, it's favor mixed with curiosity."

The wizard spoke with a rough face.

"They want to establish a relationship with you. Not through me, but through a more direct contract, they want to give you their power."

---

The text appears to be a part of a narrative involving fantasy elements, including spirits, magic, and demons, discussing rewards and relationships involving magical powers.
"Earlier, you mentioned that things aren't so bad now. I see what you meant by that."

"Whatever the case, I managed to acquire two intermediate dark magics. That's certainly a clear gain." Mashin nodded approvingly.

"One is what I provide. The other is a reward given directly to you by the demon. These two dark magics are among the upper tier of intermediate dark magics, so there should be no room for disappointment."

"Thank you."

Taesan expressed his gratitude. He was satisfied. However, Mashin wore a vague expression.

"They will show interest in you. They might approach you someday. Since I've given you a warning, they won't show hostility... but they might want to test your strength."

Mashin leaned back in his throne.

"Do as you please. You can demonstrate your power or refuse their approach."

"Understood."

It was Taesan's choice through and through. So there was nothing to hesitate about. As long as he followed what Taesan desired, as long as he fulfilled Taesan's wishes.

"Now, is it time for me to descend?"

"Yes. The conquest of the Labyrinth has been significantly delayed recently."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Throughout various trials and returns due to divine intervention, there were many comings and goings. Thanks to that, progress in conquering the labyrinth itself was rather slow.

[Now, before that, I'll convey two things.]

Mashin slowly opened his mouth.

[The 60th floor. They'll be waiting there.]

"You mean a guide."

[Yes. You just need to achieve victory as always.]

Taesan nodded. Mashin continued speaking.

"And soon, interference will occur in the labyrinth. You'll end up meeting each other."

"The Fallen God, Essence?"

At Taesan's words, Mashin's eyebrows twitched.

"How did you... No, I guess you couldn't not know, right?"

Mashin knew that Taesan had returned to the past. Therefore, everything that had happened in the labyrinth was an experience Taesan had already gone through.

"Yes. A party for the child he cherishes will begin. I don't like making meetings like this... but that guy is so stubborn."

Mashin muttered. She didn't seem to favor the Fallen God.

"It will be delivered soon, but I wanted to tell you beforehand."

"Thank you."

Mashin looked at Taesan intently.
Here's the translation of the text:

"It's better to make sure."

She said.

"If Essence approaches you and tries to do something, you can even sell my name."

"...I will remember."

"Then my business is done. It's time for you to move forward with your purpose, Taesan."

Mashin smiled and waved his finger.

"I'll await our next meeting."

As space twisted, Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

"It's been a while even here."

Now, a small space surrounded by brick walls that felt as comfortable as home.

Taesan sat down on the floor.

* * *

It was time to organize what he had obtained. Taesan first looked at the ring.

"[Dyed in black mixed with grandeur] [Attack power +750] [A ring made from the claws of a dragon and the embers of the spirit king mixed together. It's just strong. Great energies clash within to create a single ego. The ego is not pure, violent, and recognizes nothing except twins. Those who perfectly tame it will gain another power.]"

Attack power increased by 250.
If it was smooth, it was smooth, but it was a rewarding compensation that was truly helpful. The value of 250 was still quite significant even now.

Next, Taesan opened the skill window.

The proficiency of Contorted Inspiration Adjustment was 58%. Now, 60% was within reach.

Perhaps due to frequent battles with spirits, the growth rate was overwhelmingly faster compared to other skills.

In addition, abilities like Ability Sword, Small Ember, and Calamitous Ember had significantly increased proficiency.

And as a reward, a transformation into Apostasy.

[Special Activation Skill: Apostasy [Darkness and Chaos]] [The power bestowed by the God of Strife and Death since their birth. Mixed with the power of darkness, only chaos and black remain. For 2 hours, gain a portion of the power possessed by the apostles of the god. Magical power increases significantly, allowing partial control over black magic. This skill cannot be used again for a day after activation.]

The most notable change was in the duration.

What was originally one hour was now two. It meant Apostasy could now be used at a more convenient time.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"And perhaps because the energy of the magic was mixed, there was information that as the amount of magic increased, control over dark magic could be obtained.

"It's alright."

Through this quest, I learned the proper usage of dark magic. I also acquired two more intermediate dark magic skills.

Considering the power of dark magic, it would be a great help in battles.

Moreover, with the addition of one more divine energy, the effectiveness of apostleization itself has also increased. It wasn't bad.

And there's also the Double Casting obtained by defeating Ilane.

[Special Passive Skill: Double Casting] [Proficiency: 1%] [When using mana, magic, or separate energy, you can use two skills simultaneously. However, the implementation speed is significantly delayed.]

Double Casting. There was an opponent who used this in the previous life, an S-class magic user.

Though we barely defeated it through a joint effort with Itaeyeon, it was a monster that kept bursting forth with the power of a god, making even Taesan fear death.

The separate energy mentioned in the explanation must refer to the power of a god.

Taesan tried using it directly.

[You have activated the Frozen World.] [You have activated the Starlight Arrow.]

Zzzztt!

Keeeing!
In the chilling cold, starlight arrows materialized in Taesan's hands. Almost simultaneously manifested nearby, but noticeably slower than before.

Magic had always manifested instantly until now, but this time there was about a second of manifestation time. For someone at Taesan's current level, one second was a monumental difference.

"I can't use it like this. Then..."

[You activated Deccaravia's distorted flora.]

A passage materialized as Taesan prepared to draw power. Before dark magic could manifest, Taesan consecutively invoked spells.

[You activated Starlight Arrow.] [You activated Frost Arrow.] [You activated Scattering Seeds.]

Countless spells were materialized, and Taesan drew power from the passage. Roots stirred fiercely through the labyrinth.

"Seems off, doesn't it?"

"It's not quite right."

While it was possible to use magic while invoking dark magic, the manifestation speed was painfully slow. At this moment, there seemed to be no better option than using the two powers consecutively.

"It must be a matter of proficiency."
Here's the translation of the text:

"It seemed like a skill of no use if proficiency was low. In other words, if proficiency was raised, it might be possible to use both at the usual speed. And the opportunity to raise proficiency would soon come.

Until then, it was a thought to temporarily seal it.

[Intermediate Dark Magic: Naberius's Golden Sword] [Mana Cost: 300] [Base Magic Consumption: 150] [Proficiency: 1%] [Summons the golden sword protecting Naberius's physical body. The summoned sword disappears after one use.]

The explanation was brief. It wasn't strange. Whether it was the frozen world or the starlight arrow, powerful skills often had short explanations.

"The magic consumption is no joke."

150. Currently, the magic at Taesan was around 600. If he opened the passage and used it, it would disappear in just one use.

But it must have such power.

Intermediate Dark Magic.

Taesan anticipated the power and descended into the labyrinth. The best way to find out the exact power was to use it directly on monsters.

[Quest Starts on the 59th Floor.] [Defeat the boss on the 59th floor and proceed.] [Reward: Echo of the Advancing One.] [Secret Reward: ???]"
The monster on the 59th floor, though humanoid, created an eerie atmosphere by covering its eyes with hands longer than its body. Moreover, its entire form appeared covered in tough, scale-like material.

"A timid figure shielding its eyes appeared."

As soon as Taesan saw the monster, he swung his sword.

Slash.

"The timid figure shielding its eyes takes 1324 damage."

"Hmm?"

Taesan's eyebrows twitched.

"It's tough."

Even without using additional power, he couldn't inflict half the damage he usually did. This monster was special.

"The timid figure shielding its eyes. A unique monster."

A ghost muttered. Taesan searched his memory.

"Now that I think about it."

Itaeyeon had mentioned this monster before.

She called it Moore.

Taesan recalled. He chuckled.

"Nice. Didn't expect to get it right away."

"Get what?"

"I'll explain later."

First, there was the exam.

"You have activated Nevaryus's golden sword."

Without opening a passage, dark magic is employed. The golden sword materializes in Taesan's grasp, fitting over the sword he held.

Taesan's eyebrows twitched.

The power emanating from the sword was immense.
The power used in Starlight Arrow was concentrated into one sword.

Taesan wielded a golden sword. Sharp golden light swirled around.

Clang!

The walls of the labyrinth were roughly scratched. Amidst the noisy sound, the figure slowly collapsed.

"[The timid figure shielded its eyes, receiving 9324 damage.]"

"Oh?"

Taesan narrowed his eyes.

Without even opening the passage, using only basic mana consumption, he achieved damage comparable to that of a star.

"Is this a black magic technique that focuses intermediate power into a single sword stroke?"

It might not be suitable for facing many opponents, but it was sufficient to create variables in one-on-one situations.

"And if it's a sword stroke."

Taesan summoned the golden sword once again. Despite everyone dying, he swung it against the monster that stubbornly rose.

"[You triggered a strong strike.] [The timid figure shielded its eyes, receiving 12547 damage.]"

Thunk!

The figure struggling to rise finally collapsed completely.

"[You have emerged victorious against the timid figure shielding its eyes.]"

The damage clearly increased. A satisfied smile crept onto Taesan's lips.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The attack is carried out in the form of a black sword with the power of Taishan's swordsmanship.

In other words, it was possible to use the ability sword in conjunction with the ability.

That meant it could be used to deal a fatal blow in a situation where the opponent couldn't respond.

"You're living up to your mid-level name."

Taishan was satisfied and checked another black magic.

[Mid-level Black Magic: Amun's Black Stake] [Mana Consumption: 400] [Basic Mana Consumption: 170] [Proficiency: 1%] [Summons a black stake imbued with Amun's power. The stake's destructive power is like a strong explosion that can shatter the continent.]

The description alone didn't reveal what kind of effect it would have. Taishan moved on to the next room. He focused his entire body on the monster that appeared.

[You have activated Amun's Black Stake.]

A black stake appeared in Taishan's hand.

Taishan charged at the monster, dodging its attacks and stabbing the stake into its chest.

Kuung!

The stake then exploded.

The monster's chest was torn apart, and it flew backward, crashing into the wall. The monster tried to get up, stumbling and falling again."

Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with!

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"[Dealing 9924 damage to the giant creature with its eyes covered in fear.]

"Is it a trigger that explodes the moment it touches?"

Although it was implemented on his hand, making it impossible to use one of his hands, it was still a considerable force to be reckoned with. The fact that it exploded instantly upon contact was also an advantage. With this level of power, he could have blown through the opponent's defense and pierced through. If he opened the channel and used it, the power would increase even more.

Both of the dark magic he obtained this time had a significant advantage in dealing with a single target, unlike the previous magic and dark magic that were based on the premise of dealing with multiple targets. There was nothing bad about this for Taesan.

And finally,

[Leviathan] [A contract with the devil. If you wish, and if they wish, you can make a direct contract and wield dark magic. However, it is currently just a title and has no effect.]

It seemed that the devil's interest that the demon was talking about was referring to this.

Taesan, who had been looking at his skills for a moment, closed the system window. He had no intention of doing anything with the devil for now.

"Well, now..."

It's time for him to get what he deserves.

Please note that some parts of the translation may not be entirely clear or accurate due to the complexity of the text and the context, which seems to be a fantasy story with elements of gaming.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"Tae-san sorted out the irregularly shaped objects and broke through the room."

Note: "태산" (Tae-san) is a Korean name, and "비적비적" (bi-jeok-bi-jeok) is an onomatopoeia for irregular or uneven shapes. The sentence seems to be describing someone named Tae-san organizing or arranging objects and then breaking through a room or a barrier.
