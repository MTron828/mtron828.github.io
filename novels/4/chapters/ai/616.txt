**Episode 617**

617. Easy Mode. Temporary Time Stop (5)

"Huh?"

Despite acquiring the skill, Taesan's reaction was slow.

The reason was simple.

He was currently in a state of mindlessness, moving automatically.

He had erased the reason for acquiring the skill from his mind, so he didn't think about it.

"......What's going on."

Taesan's stiffened brain slowly started to turn. He let out a dry laugh as he stared blankly at the system window.

"I got it."

He had really acquired the skill.

There was no particular feeling of joy. It just didn't feel real. He hadn't even thought about acquiring the skill halfway through.

He had just moved his body according to the predetermined plan.

But... he had now achieved his goal.

There was no need to move according to the pattern anymore.

He poured his will into his mechanical body. Taesan stumbled out of the room, and the attack nullification skill was triggered repeatedly.

"......How much time has passed?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I didn't think about it at all and just moved, so I didn't even know how much time had passed."

I opened the community. What I saw was numerous posts from Lee Tae-yeon.

[Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Taesan! Where did you go!] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Did you really leave...? No way, didn't you abandon me?] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: I hate it. I hate being alone. I hate it...]

The posts were filled with desperation. Taesan realized that about three months had passed since he last accessed the community.

"It's been longer than I thought."

[Kang Taesan[Ezi]: I'm still here.] [Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Taesan!]

Lee Tae-yeon, who had been keeping an eye on the community, responded immediately.

[Lee Tae-yeon[Alone]: Where did you go! We promised to talk at least once a week! I thought you really left!]

Taesan also felt sorry about this. When he checked the posts that had come up, he saw that Lee Tae-yeon was almost going crazy. It was Taesan's fault for breaking the promise, and he knew it.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Tae-san (Iji): Sorry. I didn't even realize time had passed like this.] [Tae-yeon (Alone): What were you doing, anyway?] [Tae-san (Iji): Acquiring skills.] [Tae-yeon (Alone): Ah, you're still doing that?]

Tae-yeon knew that Tae-san was challenging himself to acquire skills. He also knew that this had been going on for several years.

[Tae-yeon (Alone): I don't want to say anything bad, but... can't you just give up? If you've done that much, isn't it impossible to get it?] [Tae-san (Iji): Well, that's how it was.]

Tae-san didn't deny it either. Objectively, it could be seen as his stubbornness and obstinacy.

But it wasn't like that anymore.

Through their conversation, Tae-yeon sensed something was off and asked.

[Tae-yeon (Alone):...Your answer is weird. Did you really get it?] [Tae-san (Iji): Maybe.] [Tae-yeon (Alone): If you got it, then you got it. What's with the maybe?] [Tae-san (Iji): No, my head isn't working well yet.]

It had been six months since he had been thinking. The skill acquisition window was actually his hallucination. He had such suspicions too.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Kang Tae-san [Easy]: Let's talk about it later. I think we need to sort some things out.] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: Got it. We have to talk! And don't go MIA again!]

Lee Tae-yeon, who had confirmed that Tae-san was still in the labyrinth, felt a little relieved.

Tae-san had turned off the community.

His frozen brain was slowly returning to its original state through his conversation with Lee Tae-yeon.

'...Did I get a skill?'

He couldn't be sure. There was one thing that was most accurate at times like this. He opened the system window.

[You have stopped everything within your range of influence. You have acquired the special skill [Temporary Time Stop].]

A translucent window calmly announced the fact.

You succeeded.

You acquired a skill.

Your efforts were not in vain.

"Ha, haha. Hahahahahaha!"

Laughter echoed through the labyrinth. It had been a while since he had laughed like this. He couldn't even remember.

He was overjoyed. Adrenaline was pumping through his veins.

It was only natural.

He had obtained something beyond his abilities.

He had reached a realm that was beyond his reach, surpassing probability.

"Hahahaha..."

His laughter subsided. His overheated brain slowly cooled down.

"I really did get it."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's a challenge that relies on luck. If you don't have luck, you'll never reach it.

But Taesan succeeded in obtaining it.

How much time did I invest? I don't even remember. Maybe around 5 years?

It was the first time I invested this much time into a single skill.

"Skill Window."

[Special Active Skill: Simple Time Stop] [Proficiency: 1%] [Mana Consumption: 20] [Stops time for 1 second within a 1m radius centered on you. This skill has a 1-week cooldown period after activation.]

Taesan slowly read the skill description and burst out laughing.

Stops time for 1 second within a 1m radius centered on you.

A simple and easy-to-understand description. That's why Taesan could immediately grasp the value of the skill.

Time stop.

A skill that interferes with the concept itself.

"I thought I'd get a good skill, but..."

I didn't expect it to be this level. Taesan lets out a hearty laugh.

He has now crossed the line.

He has obtained a skill that can take him beyond just handling things."

Note: "ìš´" can be translated to "luck" or "chance", but in this context, it seems to refer to the idea that obtaining a certain skill or ability is dependent on luck or chance.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Although there was a cooldown, it was a reasonable line. Considering the skill's effect, even if the cooldown was over a month, it was understandable.

"Ah."

Now it's time to confirm the actual effect of the reward he obtained.

Taesan re-entered the secret room. He stood in the center of the room and swung his sword widely.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

The sword and projectiles collided, creating countless irregularities.

This time, it was a perfect irregularity unlike anything before.

Even he couldn't predict the trajectory.

The needle, sphere, dagger, and arrow were deflected and targeted Taesan's entire body. It was an absolute attack that couldn't be dodged or blocked.

Taesan took a light breath and activated his skill.

[You have activated a temporary time stop. Time within 1m of you will be stopped for 1 second.]

And time stopped.

All projectiles within 1m stopped.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

Projectiles outside the range flew in and collided with the stopped projectiles. But the projectiles didn't move, as if they were fixed in space.

And 1 second passed.

The stopped projectiles began to move again.

Ka-aa-aa-ang!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With a crashing sound, an explosion occurred. During the time that was frozen, the physical forces that were applied simultaneously burst out, and projectiles flew out in all directions as if they were exploding.

'Is this it?'

Taesan emerged from the secret room with a satisfied expression.

It was just as described. The moment he activated his skill, time within a 1-meter radius of him came to a standstill.

Things that were frozen in place didn't move at all, even with external interference.

However, if something entered the range after the skill was activated, it wouldn't be frozen. It was more like a temporary interference rather than creating a boundary.

But for the things that were interfered with, they were perfectly frozen in place.

Dozens of collisions occurred within a second, but not a single movement was visible.

Heh. A laugh escaped. I couldn't count how many times I had laughed, but I couldn't help it.

The skill of the labyrinth was absolute.

Taesan may have had a power that was insignificant compared to Iteyon, but his attack nullification worked even against Iteyon.

Even if the opponent was stronger than Iteyon, or a monster from the 100th floor of the Alone Mode, it wouldn't make a difference.

In other words, there was no opponent that could resist this time stop.

Even if it was just for a second, he could create his own domain."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"One second. It may seem like a short time, but for him, a player of the labyrinth, it was more than enough to reverse the situation, even in easy mode. His abilities far surpassed those of a normal human.

Moreover, his skill only affected those within its range, and after activation, it didn't interfere with anything else.

In other words, this skill was excellent for cooperative play. He could enter the range, freeze time, and let others like Lee Tae-yeon and hard-mode players take care of the rest.

And the most important point:

Currently, his proficiency in time manipulation is at 1%.

And the labyrinth's skills undergo significant changes as proficiency increases.

From 1 minute to 10 minutes, to 100 minutes.

From 1 second to 10 seconds, to 1 minute of stopped time.

That's not all. He has obtained a skill that relies on the uncertain concept of luck, which is beyond what he could have achieved on his own.

Then, in the future, he can acquire skills using similar uncertain concepts like luck.

He saw the possibility.

"Can I use something like the fairy's wings?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The effect of the fairy's wings is to adjust the damage range. But that might not be all. This time, I couldn't use other skills or items to acquire skills, but in a different situation, I might have been able to use them.

'Good.'

It was really good. The years I invested weren't wasted.

Then, what can I get now?

What conditions can I try?

With pleasant imagination, Taesan moved his body."

Note: Taesan is a Korean name, and it seems to be the name of the protagonist or the person referred to in the text.
