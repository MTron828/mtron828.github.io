5. Alone Mode Player (1)

[Easy Mode] [The easiest difficulty. There is plenty to eat here, and shelters at the midpoint of the maze will provide you with much-needed respite. Even an ordinary and weak person can eventually clear it if they try.]

Easy mode.

He chose this mode, which was extremely easy. True to the description, even a clumsy person could clear it sufficiently with determination.

Of course, some people still died. The clearance rate was about 70%.

[Normal Mode] [A moderate difficulty. There is not enough food here, and shelters at the midpoint of the maze are significantly fewer compared to Easy Mode.] [Ordinary people will find it difficult to survive, but if they do their best and maintain a spirit that does not succumb to despair, they can clear it.]

From here, survival rates drop sharply. The average clearance rate for Normal Mode was about 30%.
[Hard Mode] [A difficulty level that tests your limits. Food here is absolutely scarce, and shelters scattered throughout the maze are very few. Monsters will willingly risk their lives to kill you, and without ensuring maximum safety, you will tragically lose your life.]

The clearance rate for Hard Mode was a mere 1%. Those who emerged victorious displayed a strength unparalleled compared to Easy and Normal Modes.

Up until this point, players in the same mode could cooperate. They could clear the labyrinth together and jointly attack bosses.

And finally,

[Alone Mode] [This is a mode where you are completely alone. No one from your world can be found here. The only beings you will encounter are monsters, hostile individuals, and NPCs.] [Luck, talent, wisdom, strategy. In this place that tests everything, you cannot survive. If your life is precious, do not choose this difficulty.]

The description remained harsh. What was amusing was that even after reading this description, about a thousand people still chose Alone Mode.

Among them, only Itaeyeon survived.

In the labyrinth where the clearance rate cannot be known.

At that time, Taesan chose Easy Mode. Because he was weak, because he did not know his own worth.

But now, he knows his own worth.
Taesan looked up at the tear in the sky. Beyond it, there might be even those who had killed him.

Would he have won if he had been at full strength? Taesan thought it was possible. If he had utilized every means and method, perhaps he could have achieved victory.

But would that be the end?

It was only the fourth wave. The monster that appeared in the sky last was stronger than those who had killed him. The strongest monster had yet to reveal itself. In the end, he would have been defeated.

But if he chose not Easy Mode, but the mode where he could gain the most and become the strongest.

Taesan grinned.

"Wait."

[Alone Mode selected.] [May luck be with you.]

His vision flipped, and his body shifted. Taesan closed his eyes and waited quietly.

Soon, the discomfort vanished. When he opened his eyes, he saw a village.

Houses with chimneys. A well in the center of the village.

Before him lay a medieval setting.

"Ha."

Taesan exhaled, tinged with longing and relief.

After a long time, he had returned to this place once again.

* * *

"He looks the same."


The appearance of the village was no different from Easy Mode. What mattered was not the village but the labyrinth, which wasn't originally designed with much attention.

There was nothing to see here. The plan was to confirm minimally and then immediately head towards the labyrinth. Taesan spoke aloud.

"Community."

[Community.] [Posts.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: ??? What is this, everyone?]

Community. The only channel where one could converse with others of different difficulty levels. The pioneers provided a wealth of information that proved immensely helpful.

"There's already a post?"

He logged in and promptly opened the community. If there was a post, it meant someone had immediately shouted out to the community upon entering.

Whoever it was, they adapted quickly. Taesan left a comment.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Fighting.]

He could use the community later. It wasn't crucial now.

"Status."

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 1] [Health: 100/100] [Mana: 10/10] [Strength: 10] [Intelligence: 10] [Agility: 10] [Attack + 0] [Defense + 0] [The subject is in optimal condition.]
A familiar window appears. The stats are laughably weak, prompting involuntary laughter.

Every player entering the labyrinth starts with the same stats.

However, the growth curve varies with the difficulty level. As players progress through the labyrinth and level up, the gap widens gradually and becomes insurmountable.

Simply put, strength directly affects physical power. Players on Hard Mode with stats exceeding a thousand have the power to move mountains and part seas.

Previously, he was confined by Easy Mode's limits, but now it's different.

He's now in Alone Mode. He will become stronger faster than anyone else.

The brief check is over. Taesan headed towards the labyrinth.

Walking through the village, he recalled Itaeyeon's words.

"There's someone guarding the entrance to the labyrinth."

Even in Easy Mode, there was one. An old man with long white beard, a typical NPC who only responded to specific inquiries.

It would be different here. Taesan recalled the description of Alone Mode.
[This is Alone Mode. Here, you will encounter no one from your world. The only beings you will see here are monsters, hostile individuals towards you, and NPCs.]

NPC.

There must be a significant reason for writing that.

Upon arriving at the entrance of the labyrinth, a man was leaning against the cave wall, sound asleep. As Taesan approached, the man lazily opened his eyes.

"Oh, you're already here? I thought it would take at least a month."

The man with black hair yawned as he got up. His sharp eyes were discernible.

"Hmm."

Taesan muttered softly.

As the man stood up, it felt like the very world was rising with him. Something immense seemed to be condensed within his small frame.

Dominance, or perhaps intimidation. Something was felt.

"He's... stronger than Itaeyeon. Even past him, an opponent I can't guarantee victory against."

"Is this the guardian?"

"First off, congratulations. I am the guardian of the labyrinth. I'm the protector of this place, and I'll guide you through it."

The man asked as he stretched.

"What's your name?"

"Kang Taesan. Taesan."

"Taesan. Not a bad name. I'm called Broken Man."

"Broken?"


"Those who fail the challenge become the guardians. Doesn't that sound plausible?"

"Yeah, I suppose so."

Taesan nodded slightly. Outwardly, he maintained a calm demeanor in conversation, but inwardly, he was quite surprised.

"So it's true."

Itaeyeon often spoke to him about how difficult her challenges were. He hadn't paid much attention, but he vaguely remembered because she offered him drinks.

Among those memories, there was one statement that stuck with him.

"[Taesan, how were the NPCs in Easy Mode?] [They were just NPCs. What else would they be?]"

NPCs in the game who repeated actions without intellect, only giving predetermined responses. NPCs in Easy, Normal, and Hard Modes were all like that.

But Itaeyeon disagreed with Taesan's assessment.

[The NPCs in the Alone Mode difficulty were different somehow. They seemed more like people.] [People?] [Yeah. They had proper intelligence, moved freely. That seemed to be one of the differences between Alone Mode and the others.]

NPCs that were not mere machines. They existed only in the Alone Mode.

What could be the reason for their existence only in this mode, not in Easy, Normal, or Hard?
He could easily figure out the reason.

"Perhaps this mode alone is the proper mode."

As Taesan calmly organized his thoughts, Broken Man twitched his eyebrows.

"Why is this guy so calm?"

Having lived only in a peaceful world, Broken Man had expected him to go crazy upon suddenly being confronted with reality.

So initially, Broken Man had planned to knock some sense into him and explain, but Taesan remained unfazed, simply looking at him silently.

"...Are you going to listen to the explanation?"

"Yes."

Taesan replied. Most of what he knew was from the Easy Mode. It was better to listen.

"You've probably heard some rumors, right? Your world is being destroyed by invaders. This place is an opportunity granted by a merciful transcendental being."

Broken Man grumbled.

"Merciful my ass. I'd be happier just being destroyed."

"Is that so."

Taesan was now convinced by his recent line. Broken Man was similar to them.

He meant beings who had come from worlds that had similarly been destroyed.

Broken Man continued speaking.
"This place is a maze. Some call it a tower, call it whatever you want. It has a total of 100 floors, with significant changes every 10 floors, and it naturally gets harder the deeper you go. You'll have to figure out what to eat inside the maze yourself, and as for detailed information, you'll have to find it on your own. That's it."

"...Is that all?"

Broken Man grumbled at the rather clumsy explanation.

"So you want me to explain what's on the 1st floor, what's on the 2nd floor? There's a guy inside who sells stuff, so ask him."

His face showed clear annoyance. Taesan recalled what Itaeyeon had told him.

"The gatekeeper there is so irritable; he'd beat you up just for complaining. I almost died before even entering the maze."

Taesan heeded the Pioneer's advice and kept his mouth shut. Broken Man reached into the space.

"Still, you gotta cover the basics."

Swoosh.

The space split apart.

"Here."

Broken Man threw out a celestial armor and sword from the space.

"Say it's for verification."

"Verified."

The same system window as before appeared in his sight.

[Celestial Armor] [Defense +1] [Seems to block minor attacks.] [Rusty Sword] [Attack +1] [Might break soon.]

"It's basic stuff."

It was exactly the same as the equipment provided in Easy Mode.

"What, not happy with it?"
"No."

Now I can enter the labyrinth. It was a delight in itself.

Broken Man was looking at Taesan in a peculiar way.

"Why are you like this?"

"No, it's nothing."

After a moment of contemplation, Broken Man decided.

"Take this too."

Broken Man handed Taesan a wrist guard.

[Old Wrist Guard] [Defense +1] [Long used and lost its original value. Seems capable of blocking animal fangs.]

Taesan was momentarily confused but accepted it silently.

'What's this?'

Itaeyeon had said he received only a rusty sword and celestial armor. There was no wrist guard.

But Broken Man didn't explain.

"And shout 'Inventory.'"

"Inventory."

A window appeared.

The black window was divided into twenty slots, each capable of holding one item. The same items can stack up to twenty. When it's full, carry it yourself. Otherwise, sell it. And..."

"Status window."

A window appeared in front of Taesan.
"Do you understand?"

"It's common."

Taesan checked the status window familiarly.

[Gang Taesan] [Level: 1] [Health: 100/100] [Mana: 10/10] [Strength: 10] [Intelligence: 10] [Agility: 10] [Attack +1] [Defense +2] [The subject is in optimal condition.]

Seeing the stats, Taesan smiled satisfactorily. A defense difference of 1 had quite a significant meaning early on. It was an unexpected gain.

"Later, I'll personally confirm what else will be added. I'll check what each attribute does and also look into the skills."

Broken Man nodded knowingly.

"Alright, let's go in now."

"Yes."

Taesan swiftly entered the cave.

"Thank you."

"Good luck."

Broken Man waved goodbye to Taesan. He lowered his hand only when his figure disappeared into the darkness.

"Can he survive?"

This place is hell.
Broken Man had seen countless individuals so far. Among them were born warriors and skilled wizards. There were also those known as geniuses, but none of them had conquered this place.

However, when Broken Man looked at Taesan, he saw something different in him.

It wasn't just simple talent or skill, but something more fundamental.

The power to survive.

"I hope he survives."

But he was the guardian of the labyrinth. He couldn't interfere in the labyrinth. There would be no second chance to see Taesan again unless he returned.

Broken Man suppressed his curiosity and guarded the labyrinth.

---

Taesan walked through the cave. There was not a single torch, but he had no problem with visibility as if the sky had opened up.

Soon, the cave ended and a brick corridor appeared.

It was the labyrinth.

As he confirmed the sight, a message blocked Taesan's view.

"This is a labyrinth created long ago by a great magician. There is a rumor that it grants one wish to the conqueror." "This is a place of confinement." "Terrifying beings move without a breath, and living things die here." "Everything here exists to oppress you." "Eternal glory awaits you as you break through the deep and thick maze."

Familiar.

But a different description.
Taesan pushed his way into the brick corridor with a cheerful expression.

"This is the entrance to the labyrinth." "Where those who stab with a sword die and live." "The power here is not that strong."

As he nervously confirmed the content, another window appeared.

"Main Quest Start." "There are many hidden places and secrets here." "Depending on the secrets you find, rewards will be given upon clearing." "1st Floor Quest Start." "Defeat the boss on the 1st floor and proceed." "Reward: Random stat boost potion." "Secret Reward: ???"
