**Episode 512**

512. 94th Floor, Easy Mode (5)

Whoosh!

I loop around, dodging the spores and accelerating even more. My speed is clearly faster than the ghost of the peak era.

Whoooosh!

I focus my mind, expand my vision, and swing my sword.

Whoosh.

[Dealt 745 damage to the Spore.]

With the feeling of something being cut off, Taesan looped again. There was no time to check what it was.

The falling speed increases even more.

Taesan's eyes can no longer see or react to anything. His body is about to touch the ground, and at that moment, he loops again. As soon as he loops, Taesan swings his sword fiercely.

However, the speed of his sword swing cannot keep up with the falling speed.

The sword swung towards the Spore barely grazes past it. It's too fast to see and react. The attack fails, and he loops again.

"Tsk."

It's over. Taesan takes out a potion from his inventory and drinks it.

[You used a Physical Strength Reset Potion.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Whoooo!"

In an instant, a strong repulsive force enveloped Taesan's body. His accelerating body came to a sudden halt, as if it had hit a wall.

Thud.

Taesan landed on the ground. Bardley, who had been watching in a daze, was shocked.

[Huh? Why?]

"There's one condition."

It would have been simple to just deal damage and increase it exponentially. Just keep falling and it would be done. But the condition of multiplication wasn't that easy.

One of the conditions of multiplication.

The system required him to deal damage that increased mid-air, at least once per loop. He had to succeed in attacking at least once per loop.

That's why Taesan didn't remove the cannon.

"This part is the problem."

If the acceleration exceeded a certain level, it would be too late to swing his sword even if he looped back. His body speed couldn't keep up with the deceleration.

Taesan, who had recovered by drinking the potion, took a step forward again.

[You have activated landing.] [You have activated super acceleration.] [You have activated bodily time acceleration.]

Kiiiiing!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The body starts to loop again. It swings its sword to cut and crush the spheres. The cannon fires, and the spheres come flying back.

"It's impossible to see and judge."

Every time it loops, it tries to move in a new way, but it can't keep up. As the falling speed increases, it becomes impossible to track with the eyes.

So, it calculates and reads everything, making judgments.

With one movement, it handles multiple loops.

Taesan looks at the cannon.

The cannon fires as soon as the number of spheres decreases to a certain level.

And the angle at which the spheres come flying is not completely random. There is a pattern.

So, it reads that.

One on the upper right arm.

One on the left wrist.

Two on the right leg. One on the head. One on the abdomen. And many more.

What is the order in which those spheres arrive at Taesan first?

It grasps everything.

The calculation is over. After the sphere on the left wrist brushes past Taesan, it changes the trajectory of its sword.

Whoosh.

One sphere on the upper right arm is cut by the sword. And with that, the body accelerates and loops again.

Taesan didn't change the position of its sword.

Whoosh.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And with that, the spore on his left wrist split in half.

By calculating the position and height of the spores, he could handle multiple loops of attacks with a single movement.

The spores couldn't keep up with Taesan's speed. Compared to Taesan's speed, they seemed to be standing still, making it a possible tactic.

He quickly moved his sword. One spore on his right leg brushed past, and the following spore was cut down by the sword.

 Kwachik.

And in the next loop, the spore that had brushed past his right leg became the target of the attack.

The falling speed accelerated rapidly.

Taesan opened his eyes.

"One, two, three, four, five."

How could he move to handle the maximum number of loops with the minimum movement? He made a judgment in an instant.

 Kwaduduk!

And with a single movement, Taesan handled all the attacks required for five loops.

 Kukukuku!

As soon as the spore he had launched disappeared, the cannon immediately fired a new spore. The same number of spores that had been processed in an instant flew in.

"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan opens his eyes wide and spins his head around. With just one movement, he handles seven loops at once.

Compared to his first attempt, he handles numerous attacks much more stably, and his attack power increases slightly.

[Deals 798 damage to Spore.] [Deals 802 damage to Spore.] [Deals 806 damage to Spore.]

However, it's still not perfect. Since there's no limit to his falling speed, he needs to respond even faster.

Quzip.

Taesan, who somehow managed to succeed, quickly looks at the Spores. He rapidly calculates their positions and how to move in his mind.

And his eyes tremble.

There's no way to handle multiple loops at once.

Although he succeeded in quickly resolving the current loop, he's already in a broken state from there on. His accelerating body can't keep up with the calculations.

"Tsk."

[You used a Physical Strength Reset Potion.]

"I reacted too slowly."

There are definitely cases where you can't handle things at once. I knew that, but it's been a long time, so I momentarily reacted too slowly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Again, I start to fall.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

'One, two, three, four.'

I process the loop at high speed. My body accelerates, and my speed increases.

This time, I see a wider range of possibilities.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

I process the loop and handle the spheres. The cannon fires, and new spheres fly in.

At that moment, Taesan realized.

If I continue like this, I'll end up in the same situation as before.

I won't be able to process the loop if I don't come up with a new approach.

I already knew the solution. Taesan swung his sword and kicked at the same time. One sphere was cut down, and the other was kicked away.

Quaaaang!

The accelerated attack sent the sphere flying wildly.

But it didn't die.

Attacking with equipment that doesn't deal damage won't work.

The sphere bounced off the ground and collided with other spheres, changing their positions.

As a result, I was able to process multiple loops with a single action."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In sync with him, I move my dual swords. In an instant, five loops are resolved.

Kagakagaka!

I judge all possibilities and, if there's no existing path, I create one.

Quadduk.

[Dealing 1002 damage to Spoer.]

I finally see a four-digit damage number.

But it's still not enough.

What he wants is a square, around 2500 damage. There's still a long way to go.

Kagakagaka!

My body accelerates and accelerates. The surrounding space distorts, and my vision blurs. If the labyrinth's system didn't protect my body, my entire body would be torn apart just from the speed.

'One, two, three, four.'

I judge four possibilities and move my sword.

And in an instant, the loop ends. I have no room to spare, having judged new possibilities.

Quadduk!

I quickly move my sword, but it's still not enough.

In the end, my sword barely grazes past.

"Hmm."

Taesan uses a potion and recovers.

'Is this the feeling?'

The awkward, imitation-like sensation that was still lacking has finally returned to perfection.

The adjustment of my senses is complete."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Then I'll get it slowly."

[Already?]

The ghost was surprised. It wasn't that there wasn't enough preparation time. But considering the skill's effect and condition, I thought it would take at least a few months.

But to think of getting it already... I couldn't help but be surprised.

"There aren't many opportunities like this."

To escape the infinite loop, I needed to slow myself down. But the landing skill was a type that couldn't be canceled once it was activated. I couldn't slow down on my own.

It wasn't that I didn't have skills related to speed, but there was no way to solve this level of acceleration.

The item for that was the Physical Strength Reset Potion.

It instantly reset the physical strength applied to me, eliminating the acceleration.

The problem was that it was too expensive. I only had two Physical Strength Reset Potions left.

"This should be enough."

I should be able to get it with this much.

Taesan started falling again.

Ka-ga-gak!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It spins and loops around, accelerating its falling speed to the point where the body can't keep up with its movement.

So, like before, I judge all possible cases and read them.

But I can't solve even eight loops.

More than that.

I calculate up to ten, twenty, thirty loops and move accordingly.

Kagakagak!

I swing my dual swords and kick with my feet. One spore is cut off and another is kicked away.

[Kaaaak!]

The kicked spore flies towards the cannon. The trajectory of the cannon, which collided with the spore, becomes distorted.

Kuuuuung!

The spore is fired from the cannon.

[Kiik!]

The direction the spore flew was straight towards the cliff.

The spore, which flew in the direction it was fired, crashes into the cliff and wobbles around. The spore, which barely regained its senses, is split in half by the mountain.

The number of spores flying in is fixed. Simply calculating the number of cases only goes up to seven or eight.

So, I create my own cases.

And that was an impossible method for him when he was in easy mode."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He clearly excelled in Easy Mode. He grasped the numerous conditions within the labyrinth and obtained powerful skills from there.

But at that time, he had never risked his life to fight against anything.

He only felt the threat to his life at the very beginning when he knew nothing, but after reaching a certain level, he could descend into the labyrinth with stability. He obtained many skills and perfectly fulfilled the conditions and calculations, but the experience that could only be gained in actual combat was empty.

His previous self had barely obtained it through countless repetitions. It was more like relying on luck rather than creating new possibilities.

But it's not like that anymore.

He has grown more than he did in Easy Mode.

Now, he can control the environment and create situations.

Quack.

He slashes the spores. They bounce off the cliff and fly back out. He moves his dual swords to match the position and height of the spores and swings them.

Kagakagak!

He surpasses them.

The rebound of the spores that bounced off the cliff. The speed. And when the momentum accelerates to a certain extent, he calculates where the spores will be.

He perfectly controls it all."

Note: "이지 모드" (Easy Mode) is likely a reference to a game or simulation, where the protagonist is able to excel easily. The text then describes how the protagonist has grown and improved beyond that point.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It creates new possibilities by repeating the loop. The speed gets faster and faster, and the damage exceeds four digits.

Infinite fall.

The accelerating speed becomes unbearable, and the body begins to distort and appear twisted.

If it weren't for the system's protection, it would have been destroyed and reborn long ago.

But not yet.

Taesan swung his sword. The sensation of cutting something was no longer felt, but the system window definitely appeared in his field of vision.

[Dealt 1435 damage to Spore.]"
