**Chapter 499**

**499. The Forgotten Goddess (1)**

"[I...]."

Akasha slowly opened her mouth.

"[Something is... coming to mind. But I can't organize my thoughts myself. Not yet... just a little more, just a little...]."

"Hmm."

The magician stroked his chin. His gaze, which had been fixed on Akasha, was averted.

"I'm curious, but it's not my place to ask. Your master is the one who knows, after all. Take your time to confirm."

"I'll do that."

Taesan replied. The magician seemed to have finished his business and stepped into the space beyond.

"Then I'll be busy too. I'll head back to the labyrinth."

The magician's finger had a portal on it. The energy of the labyrinth could be felt from within.

"Is there anything else you want to ask before you go?"

"What about the thing I gave you? How's that going?"

"Ah."

The magician said, as if recalling something.

"The progress is faster than I thought. I think I can make it to the level you want soon."

"Already?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan was surprised. He thought it would take several decades, but it was progressing faster than expected.

"At first, I couldn't get a feel for it, but using the sacred stone, I was able to adjust it to some extent. It may not be exactly what you want, but... it won't take that long."

"That's great."

Taesan smiled. It seemed like he could achieve his goal faster than expected.

"Then, let's meet soon."

The wizard finished speaking and left.

There was something Taesan needed to check. He opened his skill window.

[Divine] [Proficiency:???] [A symbol obtained by those who receive the world's faith. One who has reached an unshakable and stable position, unwavering in the face of anything. Those who have reached this realm are undoubtedly worthy of being called gods.]

The skill description had changed. Previously, it was written as "one of the qualifications to be called a god," but now it had changed to "a qualification to be called a god."

The title "unwavering and stable position" had also been added.

And Taesan could feel a change that was close to that.

Taesan's aura had changed to become extremely stable.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Now, faith can make his foundation even more solid and strong, but it cannot be shaken or fallen. As long as there is even one person who believes in him, he can maintain his true self as a god.

"Good."

It's not that he gained new powers or reached a level he couldn't reach before, but being able to maintain his foundation stably anywhere is a huge harvest in itself.

The part about proficiency is unclear, but judging from the rising numbers so far, it seemed to have reached at least 60%.

"Is it not 100% yet?"

It was difficult for him to imagine what lay beyond that.

He had gained something. Remidaos only handled divine power and didn't show his own authority. At first, he thought he was hiding it, but now he knew the reason.

[Soul Skill: Divinity] [Proficiency: 1%] [Divinity obtained by burning oneself, brighter than anything, with no bottom. A power obtained by those who have reached a high level, burning everything and barely gaining it.]

Why didn't Remidaos handle his own authority?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was because his own authority was divine. Authority refers to everything he had built up himself. It was only natural that Remidaos' authority, which had received numerous faiths, was related to him.

Taesan stole those powers. Having stolen Remidaos' divine authority and skills, which had been received by numerous faiths, the total amount of divinity had increased by almost three times compared to before. With this much power, he wouldn't have to worry about hitting rock bottom in any ordinary battle.

And that divinity would continue to grow. The faith directed towards him would not disappear.

'The balance has been broken.'

It was already like that, but now the black color was significantly lacking compared to divinity. Unlike divinity, black color could only be obtained by facing a high-ranking god. There was no stable supply source.

'I need to think of a way.'

And he had already thought of this as well. Taesan continued to verify.

[Special Passive Skill: God Slayer] [Proficiency: 1%] [One who has killed a god. The power and dignity of the god you are facing will slightly decrease. When you confront a god, your power and dignity will unconditionally increase.]

A skill obtained by killing a god. God Slayer.

It wasn't much different from other skills that increased power against opponents, but there was a part that caught his eye."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was the part where power and level unconditionally increased.

The current Taesan was a god of faith. This level was a kind of wall. There was no concept of a god beyond this.

But if it unconditionally increased, it wouldn't mean that the current level had stopped.

'How about that.'

What level would it be? It was necessary to check it later.

After finishing his preparations, Taesan looked at Bardray.

'How is it?'

[Not bad. No, actually it's good. This feeling is new to me.]

Bardray's voice was filled with considerable excitement. While defeating Remidaos, some of his power had been imparted to Bardray. It seemed he had obtained a certain amount of power.

[The Prince of the Destroyed World: Bardray] [The Empire of the Destroyed World. The Prince of Kabert. Bardray. Reborn with a sword as his physical body.] [Attack Power +3626] [The proficiency of all sword skills will greatly increase.] [Can manipulate holy energy to assist himself and aid his master.]

His attack power had greatly increased, and he had also obtained self-sustaining holy power. Bardray's level had also risen significantly."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Akasha was not much different from Bardley and had greatly increased in power, obtaining divine power. However, Akasha didn't care about that at all.

Akasha was suffering.

"Is something coming up?"

[Yes, but this memory is... This is...]

Akasha looked very confused, wondering whether it was a memory or what that memory was.

[Please wait for a moment. I'll sort it out soon.]

"Okay."

Since the rough check was over, it was time to return.

Taesan passed through the corridor and entered the labyrinth.

Gwangso welcomed Taesan.

"Haha! Haha haha haha! You're back! You're back!"

It was a dwarf.

The shop owner, with bloodshot eyes, rushed towards Taesan. Taesan took a step back.

"How did it go? Did you kill him?"

Taesan nodded silently. The shop owner's face contorted with a mix of emotions.

"Oh oh oh! Oh oh! Finally!"

He stomped his foot. The emotional wave shook the labyrinth.

"That damn thing is finally dead! It's gone! I'm so happy! Happy!"

He was overjoyed, and suddenly grabbed Taesan's shoulder.

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Thank you so much! Thanks to you, I was able to fulfill my long-cherished dream!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he pulled out a bead from his pocket and threw it into the air. The bead shattered, and a portal opened.

On the other side of the portal, the world of the dwarves, where Taesan had first arrived, came into view.

"Wait! My people! I'm back! Your true king has returned!"

The shop owner shouted, rushing towards the portal.

In an instant, Taesan was left alone in the labyrinth. Bardley muttered in a dazed tone.

"What's going on?"

Kugugung!

At that moment, the floor of the labyrinth collapsed, and Balbambara appeared.

"This is ridiculous. Even if you've fulfilled your dream, you should at least take care of the aftermath as a contractor."

Balbambara said, looking exasperated.

"There's still a lot to take care of. You're dumping everything on me and leaving. I'm going to die from frustration."

"Is this the end?"

[At least for him, it's over. Since he's fulfilled his dream, there's no need for him to stay here anymore.]

"Then what about the reward?"

[Don't worry about that. I'll take care of it.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

As soon as Balbam's words ended, the system window appeared.

[92nd Floor Quest Clear.] [The reward will be determined based on Balbam's and your opinions.]

Quest Clear.

However, the system that followed was different from usual. Balbam opened his mouth.

[The reward for this quest is not clearly defined. It will vary depending on your achievements and your choices.]

The reward for the 92nd floor is equipment from the store.

But that doesn't mean you'll get everything. There will be some limitations.

[The problem is that the one who was supposed to play that role suddenly left.]

Balbam, who was momentarily lost in thought, made a decision.

[Just wait a moment. I'll check quickly and come back.]

"Alright."

Balbam left. Taesan was left alone again.

Taesan looked at Akasha.

The emotions swirling in Akasha were slowly subsiding.

"Is everything settled?"

[Yes.]

Akasha replied in a calm voice.

Akasha had absorbed some of Remidao's power during the process of defeating him.

And he remembered something.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But I couldn't get my memories straight, and I was very confused.

That confusion has settled down now.

"What did you remember?"

[...This is part of it.]

Akasha spoke slowly.

[Part of my memory. Fragments... things I did. And things that happened there... they're coming back to me.] [Does that mean I've recovered my memory?] [No, it's not like that. It's very fragmented and broken into pieces. I don't know what kind of person I was or what emotions I had. But even though it's fragmented, I was able to get some information. Among them was something about the person I served.]

Akasha took a deep breath for a moment. And then spoke slowly.

[I... remembered their name.]

The person Akasha served.

The forgotten goddess who gave Taesan a quest.

"What's their name?"

The moment Akasha was about to say the name, something seemed to happen. But Akasha couldn't open their mouth. It was as if they knew that the moment they said the name, something would go wrong.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan waited in silence. After a considerable amount of time had passed, Akasha finally opened his mouth with difficulty.

"[His name is... Arilnan.]"

A name is a value that an individual possesses.

Moreover, if one's status reaches a certain level, the value of their name becomes extremely high.

The forgotten goddess's name is revealed to the world.

A being that was erased from the world is called forth. The name is engraved in the universe, and the being reappears.

In that process, Taesan felt something.

Something inside him was shaken.

He couldn't understand what it was, but it sent an invisible ripple through the universe. It was as if he was regaining his own power.

The light shines brightly.

A single energy gathers around the empty space.

"[Uh...]."

Bardley is taken aback. Taesan takes a step back.

"Chachazhak!"

The gathered energy takes on a rough form.

It was a radiant, shining woman.

She had long hair that covered her entire body, and her body was curled up like a fetus.

"......Ah."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The voice echoed. It was like the exclamation of someone who had been trapped in a dark prison where not a single ray of light could be seen, finally seeing the world. The woman slowly straightened her body.

'Finally. You've found me.'

She smiled brightly and gazed at the majestic mountain.

[The forgotten goddess, Arilnan has appeared.]"
