**Chapter 329**

**329. The World of the Ghost's Demise (1)**

Bardray gazed at Taesan.

With a mixture of hostility and curiosity, he grasped the magnificent sword at his waist.

"Amazing. You're an assassin who can sneak into my bedroom without making a sound! Who hired someone as skilled as you?"

Taesan didn't respond.

He slightly turned his gaze to look at his side.

[Oh...].

There, as always, was the ghost. He let out a sigh and looked at the prince, who was his own appearance.

Bardray, who possessed a human body.

And Bardray, who had died and taken on the form of a ghost.

There were two Bardrays here.

"I killed all my brothers with my own hands... Are you a god's servant? It doesn't matter what you are."

Bardray drew his sword.

"Let's cut off his limbs and interrogate him!"

He grasped his sword and charged forward. A storm-like sword attack swept towards Taesan.

"What do you think?"

Taesan dodged and asked. The ghost murmured.

[...That's me. Or rather, my past self.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Is that so."

The quest he received was to defeat the Demon King and save the world that was destroyed in his memories.

In other words, this was a world that had already been destroyed, a world of the past. And the target of his memories was none other than the ghost.

Ka-ga-gak!

The sword moved roughly, aiming for the mountain's neck and chest like a wolf.

The swordsmanship was similar to the stormy scar's swordsmanship shown by the ghost, but it was much more clumsy and had many openings. The ghost clicked his tongue.

[What's with this clumsiness? You should've aimed for the leg, not the chest. And you should've attacked three times in a row, not stopping after just two.]

"Do you know that's your past self?"

[I know, but it's still frustrating. Seeing this, I feel a bit embarrassed.]

Ka-ga-gak!

The sword swung wildly, and he dodged it by bending his waist. Bardley's face grew increasingly stern. He took a step forward and put strength into his sword.

"It's not bad, though."

For a human from the outside who hadn't entered the labyrinth, it was a considerable level.

Taesan reached out his hand, and the swung sword was caught in his hand.

"What!"

[Don't break it?]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's already in my memory, so does it have any meaning?"

[Of course. If I were to break it, you and that guy would become perfect enemies.]

As I looked closely, the sword that Bardray was wielding was similar to the artifact of Calvert that the dark mountain possessed. The dark mountain drew its sword according to the ghost's words.

"Ugh!"

Bardray didn't let go of his sword. It was possible because he was a trained warrior.

However, as a result, his body flew into the air.

Bardray was shocked by the overwhelming power.

The dark mountain twisted its hand holding the sword and snatched it away. It pointed the sword at Bardray's neck, which had fallen to the ground.

"......You're quite strong."

Bardray glared at the dark mountain. His entire body was drenched in sweat, but the dark mountain didn't even flinch.

"You, who are the same as me, are just an assassin. It's a pitiful thing. If you were a noble citizen of the empire, you would have received a grand welcome."

Bardray lamented and closed his eyes.

"Congratulations. You've achieved your goal. Kill me."

Bardray accepted his death calmly, and the dark mountain gazed at him with a cold stare.

Of course, the dark mountain had no intention of killing Bardray.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Defeating the Demon King was the quest condition, and it was likely that Bardley was his assistant.

But things got complicated from the start.

Legrit summoned Taesan to Bardley's bedroom, and Bardley suddenly recognized Taesan as an assassin.

They needed to clear up the misunderstanding, but there was no obvious way to do so. When the sensation of a sword piercing his neck didn't come, Bardley opened his eyes.

"...What are you doing? Do you think I'm a hostage or something?"

"That's not it."

"Then kill me. If I'm going to die at the hands of someone as strong as you, I don't think that's so bad."

Bardley closed his eyes again. Just as Taesan was thinking of a way to persuade him, the ghost spoke up.

[Try it my way.]

* * *

The ghost told Taesan a way to persuade Bardley. Taesan listened quietly and then spoke up.

"I have no intention of killing you."

Taesan sheathed his sword.

"You're not my enemy either."

"I don't believe the words of someone who broke into my bedroom."

"I know. That's why I want to earn your trust."

Let me know if you have any further questions or need any clarification!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"As he organized the story the ghost had told, he smoothly spat it out.

'I came to find you to defeat the Demon King. I am the prince of the Kavert Empire.'

At Taesan's words, Bardley opened his eyes.

'You must know too. The Demon King will soon be born and invade the world.'

'...How is that possible.'

Surprise and doubt appeared in Bardley's eyes. The content Taesan had just spoken was unknown to the world, and only the imperial family within the empire knew about it.

Taesan continued speaking.

'Hero. You must know about Kariat.'

'...Yes.'

Hero Kariat. He was a hero who had appeared a long time ago in this world. He had defeated the Demon King who was invading the world and became the ruler of the world.

However, Kariat had fallen during the process of defeating the Demon King. He was consumed by madness, killed many people, and sought power.

All of humanity had gathered to defeat Kariat and killed all of his descendants. Even now, after a long time had passed, he was a being whose name was taboo to speak.

'I am a descendant of Kariat.'

At Taesan's words, Bardley's pupils grew larger."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If you are the prince of the empire, you would know. The descendants of Kariat have not been cut off yet."

"...... Yeah, I know."

There were those who managed to escape while being killed for having Kariat's bloodline. It was a fact that only a very few people in the empire knew.

The master's words flowed out of Taesan's mouth, and Bardley's eyes gradually sank.

"The hair and eye color of Kariat's descendants are all black."

Taesan touched his own hair.

"Because of the unmistakable characteristics, I have always been oppressed. I want to restore the honor of our family that our ancestors ruined. That's why I came to find you. Prince of the empire, I heard that you don't discriminate greatly against our bloodline."

"......"

"I apologize for sneaking into your chambers. If I didn't do it this way, I wouldn't have been able to meet you."

"It's done."

The prince stood up, muttering to himself.

"If you are truly a descendant of Kariat, there would have been no other way to enter here. I will forgive you."

Bardley smiled faintly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You're quite bold. I've mentioned your lineage many times, but to believe in it and come this far is impressive. And that strength, it's truly remarkable."

There was no longer any doubt in his eyes.

Only goodwill and trust towards Taesan remained.

"It's really done."

Taesan's words now were all according to the ghost's story. He spoke with half-doubt, but Bardray had started to trust him.

[That guy is me.]

The ghost said with a smirk.

[I know what you're thinking, what you want to hear, and what you desire. It's not hard to gain the trust of that one guy.]

The most important issue had been resolved.

From now on, it wouldn't be too difficult. Bardray clicked his tongue and looked around.

"Well, it's become quite troublesome."

His room was completely ruined. The decorations on the wall and the carpet were torn and battered due to the battle. It looked more like a ruin than a room.

With this level of disturbance, it wouldn't be strange if someone came to visit. Indeed, the sound of knocking on the door was heard.

"Your Highness, what's going on?"

"There was a bit of a disturbance. Come in."

"I apologize for the intrusion."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The door opened, and a maid entered. She looked at the messy room once, and then at Taesan, and her eyes widened in shock twice.

"......Your Highness? What is this......"

"I told you. There was a bit of a commotion. It's no problem."

"But the culprit......"

She looked at Taesan's black hair and eyes, and her expression was bewildered. Bardley adjusted his clothes and said,

"Don't make a fuss. He's my guest."

"What?"

The maid's eyes grew wide.

She stared at Taesan, her eyes darting back and forth.

"Your Highness, the culprit......"

"When did you start doubting my words?"

Bardley smiled quietly. The maid trembled, then bowed her head.

"I apologize."

"Leave now, and show him to a guest room."

"What? Yes......"

The maid was startled, but then quickly bowed her head under Bardley's cold gaze.

Bardley looked around his room and said,

"Sorry about this. I'll clean up first. We can talk later."

"Yes, I understand."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Then guide me. As my guest, I won't forgive you if you treat me carelessly."

"As you wish, Your Highness."

The maid followed Bardley's words and led Taesan out to the corridor.

The maid, who was leading the way, kept glancing back at Taesan with a fearful expression.

Taesan asked her, "What year is it now?"

"Uh, it's the 876th year of the Imperial Calendar..."

"Is that so?"

Taesan nodded. The maid, still trembling, led him to a room and said, "If you need anything, just ring the bell and call for me."

With that, she quickly left. Taesan sat down on the bed and opened his mouth.

"What do you think?"

[The Great Empire. Cabert said it's been 876 years since he settled here. If my memory is correct, the Demon King appeared in this world in 877. Looking at the scenery outside the corridor... I think we have about three months left.]

Three months until the Demon King's invasion.

The ghost mutters to himself.

[Ugh, this is really bad.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The world of ghosts was destroyed by the Demon King. Three months later, they failed to stop the invasion and were swept away into the labyrinth.

But then, he met his past self and was able to witness himself stopping the Demon King's invasion again.

[The God of Regret... really lives up to his name. As expected, it's not to my liking.]

The ghost, who had momentarily composed himself, began to speak.

[First, defeating the Demon King is a quest condition. I suppose it means helping my past self achieve it.]

"It's the Demon King."

Taesan also had something he was curious about.

"There was a being called the Demon King in the Demon Realm too."

And its power was not that great.

Of course, it was strong and exceptional, but it was not something that could reach Taesan. If it were on the same level, Taesan could have solved everything on his own. But the ghost denied Taesan's thoughts.

[The Demon King of the Demon Realm and the Demon King here are different beings with the same name. You can think of them as a kind of device.]

"A device?"

[Do you remember when we fought the fragment of the wolf that destroyed the world on the 51st floor? How was it?]

"It was quite strong."

Even though it was just a fragment and not the main body, it had the power to give Taesan a hard time."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's the kind of existence. An existence meant to destroy the world. It's hard to compare exactly, but... even you now would find it hard to win."

"Win against that?"

Taesan, who was descending into the depths, was also unable to win. In reality, it meant that it was impossible to counterattack from the outside. It was hard to understand that such an opponent was emerging as an enemy.

The ghost said,

"I told you. It's a mechanistic existence. There's a prophecy about the Demon King. We need to fulfill it to win."

The ghost began to recite the prophecy.
