**Chapter 552**

**552. The Treasure Chest of the Usurper (10)**

The blooming flowers scatter.

Like dandelion flowers riding the wind, they slowly fly towards Taesan.

Thousands, tens of thousands of red flowers fill the field of vision.

Taesan gathers his mana.

[You have activated the colorful, rainbow-colored dash.]

Let's try to understand what kind of power this is by lightly testing it. The rainbow color surges towards the flowers.

And the moment it touches the flowers, they bloom.

**Boom!**

Its size expands, engulfing the space itself. It's like popcorn exploding, and in an instant, it's about to cover Taesan.

The explosion is too fast, leaving no time to activate the Shadow Usurpation. Taesan creates a boundary around himself and takes a step back.

**Boom!**

The bloomed red flowers collide with Taesan, and the ash-colored light rapidly spreads. Taesan quickly escapes from the bloomed flowers. He raises his hand to the scattered concept.

[You have activated the Shadow Usurpation.]

And the power of expulsion is activated.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It rejects and negates everything that touches it, and collides with the red flower that dominates the space.

Expulsion is its own authority. It was clearly one of the complete concepts.

Hooray!

But the red flowers are not pushed away.

Instead, they engulf the complete concept, and bloom even more. Like life, they burst forth in a brilliant blaze.

Expulsion is pierced.

The mountain range raises its boundary. The ash-colored dust that has lost its color is swept away.

The valuelessness spreads throughout the world, rendering everything meaningless, including the blooming red flowers.

But the red flower resisted the valuelessness and maintained its own value.

It bloomed, burst forth, and was born. And although it was just a small fragment, it succeeded in piercing the valuelessness.

The mountain range clenched its fist. The red flower burst forth from the mountain range's hand.

The scattered petals of the flower touched the mountain range.

The mountain range read the concept contained within.

'...It's not a flower.'

The flower was just a simple form. It was closer to being a shape that expressed authority.

The authority of expulsion was pushed back. And even the mountain range's valuelessness couldn't completely eliminate it."

Please let me know if you have any further requests!

"The concept of expulsion was not just a single, absolute power, but a power that existed above and beyond that.

It was like the words of the god of death, Derusha.

It was a concept that had existed from the beginning, taking its place in the universe since its creation.

'Was Arilnan's existence that great?'

[Wither.]

The usurper spoke briefly.

And a massive flower bloomed, covering the entire world. A gigantic flower bud burst forth, towering high.

Its size was like a mountain.

[Blossom.]

And the flower bloomed, dominating the space and trampling everything.

Taesan took a step back, avoiding the dominated space, piercing through the petals, and charging towards the usurper.

The usurper shook his body violently.

[Wither.]

The bloomed flower withered.

And Taesan realized.

Everything heading towards the usurper was withering.

It was not a simple death. It was like the flower wilting in the flow of time.

It was dangerous to approach it. No matter how much caution was taken, it was still dangerous.

In the end, Taesan had no choice but to retreat to a safe distance.

Through the recent battle, Taesan was convinced. The effect of Arilnan's power was not just one."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So far, what I've confirmed is the blooming of flowers. The flowers are blooming. Each and every flower is equivalent to a complete concept, or even surpasses it.

And then, they reach full bloom. In that way, the bloomed flowers fill the space itself, overflowing it.

Taesan felt it when he pierced through the fully bloomed space.

The space was extremely heavy and dense. It was as if there was no empty space, and it was filled to the brim. The density itself was unbelievably high.

And then, there's the fall of flowers.

The fall of flowers was the opposite. The space itself becomes completely empty.

But it was different from being worthless. It was close to a concept where everything rots and withers away, like a withered idea.

'What kind of power is this?'

So far, I've only confirmed three effects.

It's possible to make guesses, but I couldn't accurately determine what kind of concept it was.

However, it's incredibly powerful. It's clear that it's broken through the power of expulsion and even surpassed worthlessness.

The fact that the usurper, who can't even handle power properly, has managed to wield it to that extent means that the power itself is extremely high-level.

'How did you usurp a god like that?'

If you could handle it perfectly, it would seem like a concept even higher than Rakirates, Mashin, or Maria.

But in the end, it's the usurper who wields it."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Then, I could have pierced through anything.

[You activated the Spirit Seizure.]

Many powers manifested in Taesan's hands. The usurper scattered flowers in a distorted shape.

[You activated Acceleration.] [You activated Skill Acceleration.]

And Taesan moved at high speed, aiming for the gaps between the flowers. The usurper made the flowers bloom and flourish, trying to attack Taesan with them.

Taesan didn't back down.

The usurper could exert power, but couldn't focus or control it.

Then, I could pierce through.

[You activated the Spirit Seizure.]

I seized the concept. And with that seized concept, I controlled and wielded it with Taesan's will.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

The power of certainty was realized in Taesan's hands.

And, ash-colored power was contained within.

[Hmm.]

Piiing!

The ash-colored power of certainty shot towards the usurper. The usurper hastily made the flowers fall to block Taesan's attack.

But the attack succeeded in reaching the usurper's vicinity.

[You...]

"It seems I've made it this far."

Taesan laughed.

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The numerous powers scattered all over this place.

Every time I activated the divine theft on each one, I became more and more accustomed to it.

This place was a treasure trove even for Taesan. Normally, it was impossible to use, but it could overwhelmingly raise the proficiency of divine theft.

"Try your best. Keep fighting against me."

He would become stronger and stronger, and the thief would remain in that place.

The thief was only a tool for his practice.

The thief also realized that fact. He could no longer bear it. He was filled with rage and tried to trample Taesan.

Taesan, on the other hand, welcomed him with a smile.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

Concepts clashed with concepts.

The power of Arirnan wielded by the thief collided with the power wielded by Taesan through divine theft.

However, the difference from before was that Taesan's power had a boundary.

And that ratio was increasing steadily.

[Ah, ah, ah, ah!]

The thief couldn't bear the sight.

He perfectly mixed the concepts of the universe and beyond, making them his own complete power."

Note: "영격 찬탈" is translated to "divine theft", but it's a bit of a tricky term. "영격" means "divine" or "spiritual", and "찬탈" means "theft" or "plunder". The term could also be translated to "spiritual plunder" or "divine robbery", but "divine theft" seems to fit the context best.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The thing that the usurper had been aiming for his whole life was exactly that.

He was realizing the concept that he had usurped from Taesan.

The usurper burst into emotions. His great wisdom as a noble being was no longer visible. The petals of flowers wildly covered the entire domain.

That alone was powerful enough.

Even if one were a transcendent being who dominated the entire concept, it would be impossible to easily reach.

But the opponent was Taesan.

He plundered many things and dyed them in a grayish hue. It wasn't just a simple takeover, but he made them his own and controlled them.

Kwaaaah!

The usurper was enraged.

He couldn't control his emotions and swung his power wildly. A massive power exploded.

[Bloom fully!]

Kiiiiing!

Dozens of flowers bloomed. They covered the entire domain.

Taesan focused his mind.

He worked hard to bring out his abilities to their fullest potential.

Taesan charged forward, wielding the power he had usurped, towards the countless blooming flowers.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In that process, his spirit reached an even higher realm. Originally, it took a certain amount of time to grasp the concept, but this time, it was possible to grasp it with just a light touch.

And Taesan reached it.

Like when he was fighting Rakirtas.

He reached the realm he had reached in that moment.

But this time, it was different. Back then, he had reached it by chance and couldn't go any further, but now, he had reached it with his own will.

So Taesan took a step forward.

Kiiiiing!

The flowers bloomed and tried to cover Taesan. Taesan didn't back down. Instead, he stretched out his hand.

The red flower touched Taesan's hand.

[You have activated the Concept Domination.]

And the ownership of the flower changed.

Unlike before, it wasn't a concept that was dominated by someone else, but a concept that the dominator directly controlled and wielded, making it Taesan's own.

The flower's concept, its power, poured into Taesan. In that process, Taesan realized the power of Arilnan.

"This is...….

Taesan burst out laughing.

"Your true self is more amazing than I thought. You've even dominated this. How strong are you?"

[What nonsense...].

"There's nothing more to see from you."

Taesan made the flower he controlled scatter."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Waaaahhh!"

The blooming flowers and the falling flowers collide. The petals scatter everywhere.

"[Yeeeessss!]"

The uncontrollable thief of emotions bursts out.

Taesan bends his knees. He lowers his posture and focuses his energy throughout his body.

"Hooooah!"

He charges forward, not backing down, straight ahead, towards the thief.

The flowers bloom and take over the space. Taesan activates his spiritual thievery.

He steals that power. In the process, he becomes more familiar with spiritual thievery and understands Arin's power.

And finally...

"Crush."

The flowers start to wither, mixed with ash.

Arin's power is now under Taesan's control.

"Bloom."

The withered flowers bloom, trampling everything. Dozens of red flowers burst forth, shattering everything.

In the scattered petals, a path is created between Taesan and the thief.

"[Ah, ah.]"

The thief stumbles backward, fear etched on his face.

"Waaaahhh!"

Taesan's footsteps don't stop. In an instant, he reaches the thief's vicinity.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The usurper hastily tried to draw out their power, but the sword of Taesan pierced the usurper's chest first.

Kwaduk.

[Ugh!]

And the ash-colored explosion occurs. The beast of the boundary rises and begins to devour the usurper's twisted body.

[Ah, ah, ah, ah!] [You have activated the Soul Usurpation.]

Soul Usurpation.

This time, what was usurped was the usurper themselves. The usurper realized that their very existence was being usurped.

[Don't laugh! You, who are so foolish and ignorant, a being of the universe, dare to try to usurp me!]

"You are me. Exactly, that's what you're supposed to become."

Taesan revealed this.

"You are mine."

In the past, the usurper, who was once a part of him, had said this to him. Now, he says it to the usurper.

The usurper was about to let out a scream.

The ash-colored explosion occurs.

The usurper's existence begins to settle into Taesan's interior.

[Ah, ah, ah!]

The usurper tries to resist somehow, but it's all meaningless. The beast of the boundary happily devours all their resistance.

Kukukukuku......

And Taesan devours.

The usurper's part.
