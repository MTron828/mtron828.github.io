Chapter 493

493. 92nd Floor. Faith (4)

"What, what is this?!"

The guards rush over, hearing the commotion. They see Taesan, who has transformed into Remidaos, and are shocked.

"What, what, what, what?"

"I am Remidaos."

A low, resonant voice echoes throughout the city. The dwarves, who had been hiding with their heads buried in their blankets, slowly lift their heads.

"I have come to free you."

"Hah, don't make me laugh!"

Swish!

The guards draw their swords. They are the tools of oppression used to obtain faith, and so they don't recognize Taesan's appearance in their dreams. They seem unaware of his true form.

"What kind of ridiculous disguise is this? You're just spouting nonsense! Die!"

The guards charge at him.

Taesan lightly flicks his finger.

Quake.

A physical shockwave crushes them. In an instant, over a dozen guards are knocked to the ground, unable to even cry out in pain.

"Oh oh oh!"

"Lord Remidaos!"

The dwarf families wail. Their voices echo throughout the city.

Clang.

The door opens one by one, and the dwarves appear.

They approach the place where Taesan is, as if they are possessed.

"Ah, ah......"

"Lord Remidaos?"

They confirm Taesan's appearance with their eyes and collapse to the ground.

With dull eyes, they stare at Taesan in disbelief.

The magnificent golden hair and golden eyes. The resplendent clothes made of gold.

It was exactly the same as the appearance of Lord Remidaos they had seen in their dreams.

[You have activated complete surveillance.] [They are......]

.

.

.

Hundreds, thousands of system windows suddenly cover their field of vision.

All the information about the numerous dwarves that appeared before Taesan is revealed to him.

Taesan quickly filters through the information and opens his mouth.

"I am Remidaos."

"Ah, ah, ah......"

"I prophesied to you. When your emotions and true faith reach me, I will shine brightly and descend upon you. I will lead you to save this world."

"Oh, oh, oh!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The dwarves reacted violently. The reason was simple. It was because Remidaos had appeared in their dreams and spoken directly to them.

"Ki-ki-ki-ing!"

The divine energy enveloped the city, and people's eyes became hazy as they were warmly wrapped in the golden aura.

"Follow me."

Taesan stepped forward, and the dwarves followed him as if they were possessed.

The place Taesan headed towards was the largest building in the center of the city.

The iron-colored building occupied one-third of the city.

"Mo, everyone get ready!"

Inside the building, the dwarves hastily pulled out their weapons. They were all tools created to oppress these people.

Taesan snapped his fingers.

The divine energy revealed itself, and the building was blown away.

"Ku-gu-gu-gung!"

"Aa-aa-aa-ah!"

"Save us!"

The building collapsed, and those who were preparing for battle fled in terror, their faces pale. In an instant, the building that occupied one-third of the city was reduced to ruins.

"Oh, oh-oh-oh……."

The people following Taesan couldn't help but exclaim in amazement.

Despite the massive building collapsing, there was no impact on them. Taesan remained untouched, without even a speck of dust on him.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was an ordinary building with no magical processing whatsoever. It could be easily destroyed with just a bit of strength. Even if it wasn't the great mountain, but just a guide or a leader, it was possible.

But to them, it was truly a miraculous event.

"I will punish those who oppress you and give you freedom."

The people were ecstatic. Their faith, which had been in Remidaos, shifted to the great mountain.

[The proficiency of divinity increased by 1%.]

* * *

"Follow me. Let's directly witness the punishment of those who oppress and force their faith on others."

The great mountain led the people out of the city. They all followed him without exception.

The immortal's residence was exactly on the opposite side of the planet. The great mountain didn't head there directly, but instead went to other villages nearby.

There, he dealt with the tools of oppression and led the people.

At first, even those who were half-hearted began to believe in the great mountain as Remidaos, without a doubt, after seeing his appearance and power.

In an instant, a massive procession was formed. The great mountain led them, thinking to himself.

"I didn't know it would be used like this."

The orb of shape transformation."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was an item I had received from Barija on the 51st floor a long time ago.

I didn't have a particular reason to use it, so I just left it in my inventory. I thought I would never use it, but I guess this opportunity came up.

'As they say, if you have something, you'll use it someday.'

If he hadn't taken on the form of Remidaos, it would have taken a considerable amount of time for them to trust him. But the moment he transformed into Remidaos using the shape-shifting orb, that problem was perfectly solved.

The shape-shifting orb has a short duration, but Taesan could forcibly extend it for now. At least, there wouldn't be a problem until this quest was over.

Taesan looked at the people.

As Taesan's gaze fell on them, they bowed their heads deeply.

Their deep and profound faith in Remidaos was pouring into Taesan.

A faith that had been with them for a very long time, perhaps since birth.

A genuine faith that arose from the heart was taking root within Taesan.

[The proficiency of Divinity increased by 1%.]

'Ah, very good.'"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan moved forward. He visited other cities and towns, liberating them. Although some noise occurred during the process, there were no major issues.

[You have activated complete surveillance.] [Karatuoi has a small doubt in his mind about your curly hair.] [Paparacia is puzzled about how you, who appeared in his dream, are slightly different from Remidaws.]

...

...

Complete surveillance reveals everything.

The meaning of those words is not trivial at all. It tells you how to design a building's structure to withstand earthquakes. It tells you how to handle fire to burn down an entire mountain. Even if Taesan himself doesn't know, complete surveillance provides that information.

If desired, it's possible to gain perfect favor from someone you've just met. In the past, he couldn't bring out his true power due to a lack of mana, but now he can use it as much as he wants.

Using complete surveillance, he gains people's perfect trust.

And he travels around the planet, gathering people's faith.

It was extremely easy, just like the many times he had done it before. Taesan quickly traveled around half of the planet.

And around that time, the other party also started to move.

[What are you doing? You're a great being.]

A voice filled with dismay pierced through the people and reached Taesan.

Taesan looked up.

A strong figure from afar was speaking directly to Taesan.

It must be the immortal ruler of this place, Karak.

[This is the domain of Lord Remidaos. Even if you're a transcendent being, you can't just barge in.]

"I know."

Taesan looked up at the sky. A small, shining white star was visible beyond the vast universe.

"It seems they know too."

Karak thought Taesan understood and started speaking even more strongly.

[How dare you steal Lord Remidaos' faith. He won't just sit back and do nothing. Leave this place immediately. If you do, I might be able to overlook it.]

"Shut up."

[...What are you saying?]

"We'll meet soon anyway. Let's talk then."

Thud.

Taesan forcibly turned away his gaze. The astonished gaze slowly disappeared.

"That... Lord Remidaos?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The dwarves around him looked at Taesan with anxious faces, as if they had sensed something.

Taesan shook his head as if it was nothing and asked them.

"Do you remember your king?"

"King... if you say so."

"Are you referring to Karak?"

"I'm talking about your true king, not him."

The dwarves looked puzzled. They didn't even know that the shop owner existed. It was natural, considering the time he had spent in the labyrinth. Remidaos wouldn't have left any traces of an existence that hindered his faith.

"Pitiful."

It was a matter of little concern to Taesan.

Taesan had gathered the faith of all people.

Except for a small minority, everyone worshiped him, and when Taesan judged that, he moved to finish things.

"I'll go and punish them."

"Oh oh oh!"

"Lord Remidaos, please punish him severely!"

He headed towards the immortal's location. The immortal must have confirmed Taesan's movement, but didn't show any particular reaction.

Taesan led the people to the place where the immortal dwelled.

The place was extremely magnificent. A golden castle that could accommodate thousands of people, and the only presence felt within was that of a single immortal.

"Crush it."

[You have activated the Declaration of Collapse.]

With a short declaration, the castle crumbles.

The immortal resisted with all his might, but everything was crushed by the declaration and disappeared.

Kugugugugu!

In an instant, the castle turned into ruins.

"Oooo!"

Taesan briefly said to the people who were shouting.

"Wait here."

Taesan entered the ruined castle.

After clearing the debris that blocked the way, he encountered the immortal waiting for him.

"You......"

It was a muscular dwarf with a long, luxurious beard. He was staring at Taesan with trembling eyes.

He gritted his teeth.

"This is the domain of Lord Remidaos!"

"I know."

"He is an extremely powerful being! No matter how great you are, you cannot reach him!"

"I don't know about that."

"Leave this place immediately!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The immortal swung his arm wildly, unleashing a powerful shockwave that swept through the surroundings.

"I've conveyed the message to Lord Remidos! Someone dares to trespass on your territory!"

"You wouldn't need to convey it even if you didn't; I already know."

Taesan replied lightly, but Karak shouted coarsely as if he hadn't heard.

"You may be strong, but he is truly transcendent! He is revered by multiple worlds! You cannot defeat him!"

He gasped for breath. Taesan opened his mouth without any particular reaction.

"I already know that."

"......What?"

"What I aim for is exactly what you said."

Karak's pupils widened. His face contorted as he realized Taesan's goal.

"......You!"

Karak clenched his fist, gathering all his strength to strike Taesan.

Taesan lightly lifted his foot. With just that action, Karak's entire strength was shattered and broken. Karak spat out blood and collapsed.

Karak gritted his teeth and got back up.

"Th... You filthy thief!"

"Are you the one saying that?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan smiled mockingly and unleashed his power. The divine energy surged violently, sending fragments flying everywhere. From the outside, people watching saw Karak and Taesan's figures collapse.

"Oooooh!"

The people erupted in cheers. Deep and profound reverence was directed towards Taesan.

"You need to be overwhelmingly defeated. And they need to see that form."

Karak's face contorted in anger.

"You're going to make a spectacle out of me?"

"You're the one who's been playing with them all along, aren't you? It's only fitting that you reap what you sow."

Taesan sneered, drawing his sword.

"There are a lot of places to run around, so let's end this quickly."
