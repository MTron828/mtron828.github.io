**Episode 271**

271. 61st Floor, The Testing Ground (2)

"The weak do not deserve to come down from here."

Beldekia said.

"My test is a kind of minimum requirement. If you can't pass this, you'll only get destroyed if you try to go down."

Deep down.

The first obstacle to get there.

That was the 61st floor.

"How long did it take you, Taeyeon?"

She said it took her three months. Beldekia looked at her with an incredulous gaze, as if she had barely passed.

"Passing is passing, but... this is ridiculous. Was I able to pass like this?"

Beldekia, who had been facing adventurers for an unknown amount of time, laughed mockingly at Taeyeon.

She didn't say how she had passed, so Taesan didn't know either. But he was sure that she hadn't passed in a normal way, since she was a coward.

"Will you accept it?"

"Yes."

Taesan replied.

"Then I'll explain the rough rules."

Beldekia touched her hat.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with!

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"But I can see that you have the power to choose one ability. This power can be obtained from the labyrinth or acquired by yourself outside. It doesn't matter."

Beldegkia taps the floor with her staff, and magic spreads across the floor, starting to engrave a magic circle.

"Martial arts, labyrinth skills, magic... Choose one of your abilities. Then, I'll seal all your other powers."

"Win with just one ability?"

"That's right. This is a test to see how you use that ability and how skillfully you wield it."

A intricately patterned magic circle with numerous geometric shapes appears in front of Beldegkia.

"The test can only be attempted once a day, and it has a difficulty level. It ranges from 1 to 10, with 1 being the easiest and 10 being the hardest."

"What's the level of difficulty?"

"Have you met any strange guides on your way here?"

Taesan nodded, and Beldegkia said:

"The first level is equivalent to the boss monster of the 60th floor. You can think of it that way."

The boss monster of the 60th floor. That means it won't be an easy opponent.

All the adventurers who have reached the 61st floor have defeated the boss, but that's a story of when they used all their abilities.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"If I had only one ability, I would lose 100 out of 100 times. I can see why it took Lee Tae-yeon over three months to figure it out.

"Can you die in a trial?"

"You can be on the brink of death, but you won't die. I said so, didn't I? This is a test. If you die, it's a failure."

It meant that she would keep challenging indefinitely without dying.

"What about 10?"

"Don't even think about it. It's not a difficulty level that's meant to be cleared. Are you going to accept it?"

"Yes."

"Then wait a moment."

Beldengkia's staff pointed at Taesan.

[Beldengkia activated her skill, "Mysterious Power: Target Identification".]

"This skill I obtained while being trapped here. I can see what kind of power the adventurer who found me has. It's ridiculous if the examiner doesn't even know that."

Beldengkia said so and examined Taesan. Soon, her face distorted.

"What the...?"

"Why is that?"

"Magic? That's nothing. Black magic? How do you, a human, possess that?"

"I received it from the devil."

"......The devil?"

Beldengkia was extremely perplexed. She barely managed to open her mouth.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You can challenge... swordsmanship, magic, dark magic, and spirit skills. There are four. Alchemy is not enough, so it's not even a challenge."

Taesan, who had been thinking for a moment, opened his mouth.

"Then let's start with swordsmanship."

"Good."

Beldegkia tapped the completed magic circle with a languid face.

Light arose from the magic circle.

"If it's swordsmanship... is this guy appropriate? Then what level of difficulty will it be?"

"Please make it level 10."

Beldegkia calmly exerted her power at Taesan's words.

"It's not bad to experience reality once and give up."

[Beldegkia activated the implementation.]

The magic circle was implemented, and a knight in black armor holding a lance appeared.

Clang.

[All abilities except swordsmanship were sealed.]

"This is..."

Strong.

It was at the level of the Spirit King's shield, not an opponent that could be found on the 61st floor.

"I told you? That you can't beat it."

Beldegkia held her staff.

"It's not bad to get hit and realize it. Let's start."

Whoosh!

The knight charged, and the lance pierced Taesan's head, shattering the air.

Taesan couldn't even follow the knight's movements and just stood there.

Please let me know if you'd like me to clarify any parts of the translation!

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"Beldengkia calmly observed their appearance.

Those who made the same choice as Taesan were not just one or two. Those who risked their lives, overcame all the absurdities, and arrived here had immense confidence in themselves.

The first thing they did after listening to Beldengkia's explanation was to attempt to pass the 10-step test.

Only one adventurer, Itaeyeon from their past life, chose to start from the first step instead of the 10th step.

In other words, all the adventurers Beldengkia saw chose the 10th step, and they all failed miserably.

This one won't be any different. Although they don't seem weak with a ghost by their side... the 10th step had the power to surpass the 61st floor.

They'll challenge the 10th step, get crushed, and then gradually reduce the difficulty level. Eventually, they'll barely clear the first step with great difficulty.

And they'll be satisfied and pleased with their meager achievement.

Nothing changes. It's always the same.

Their weakness is disgusting. They have such little power, yet they can be confident. It's revolting."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I'll do it sooner or later."

I had given up expecting anything else.

It was the moment when Beldeniz grasped her cane and tried to strike the great mountain with a sigh.

Ka-ga-ga-k!

The sound of clashing steel echoed. Beldeniz's pupils enlarged.

The great mountain parried the knight's charge with its sword.

The great mountain's sword moved. As the afterimage was drawn, the knight's lance shook violently.

Ka-ga-ga-k!

Sparks flew.

Movements that transcended sound collided. The great mountain struck down with its sword, and the knight swung its lance to deflect it.

Kaang!

The great mountain gained distance. With a calm gaze, it looked at the knight.

And Beldeniz watched the scene in a daze.

"Huh?"

"...As expected, fast."

The level of the Spirit King's shield. If judged calmly, it exceeded 70 floors.

But if there was no deep equipment, it wouldn't be a big problem for the great mountain. Due to the increase in spiritual power, it now possessed stats higher than that.

However, Beldeniz, who didn't know this, couldn't understand the scene unfolding before her eyes.

"...Pushing with strength?"

Here is the translation of the text to English:

Belldeck was a wizard.

He was someone who tried to understand the principles and laws of things and grasp their secrets.

As he descended into the labyrinth, he came to realize many things through observation and experience.

The stats of a 10th-level warrior were so extraordinary that even if they obtained almost everything up to the 60th floor, they would still be unable to reach Belldeck's level, which was beyond the norms.

In other words, the 10th level was not designed to be surpassed from the start.

The only possibility was to perfectly understand the warrior's actions and strategies after countless challenges, but no one had succeeded in doing so. It was easy to say, but it required investing almost a year's worth of time, and even then, the possibility of success was slim.

So, everyone tried a few times and realized it was impossible, then gave up.

But...

This is...

Kaang!

Lance and sword clashed, their weapons repelling each other.

The difference in strength was almost negligible.

Even Belldeck, who had overcome countless hardships, struggles, and irrationalities, couldn't accept this irrational sight.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"It didn't end there.

Damn it.

Taesan's sword pierced through the ground.

[You activated Acceleration.]

"What?"

Beldencia was even more surprised. It was clearly a swordsmanship test, but a skill? It was incomprehensible, and Beldencia hastily checked, but the test continued normally.

"What the hell?"

He was flustered.

It was the first time in hundreds of years that he felt such fluster.

Yet, the fight continued.

Taesan's swift strike was blocked by the knight, but his body was pushed back due to the delayed reaction.

[You activated Strong Strike.]

Kaang!

The sword swung with force, and the knight's body was pushed back further.

Koong!

The knight didn't give up easily. He supported his body with his back legs and thrust his spear. Taesan moved his sword to counter the lance aimed at his head.

[You activated Evasion.]

The spear's trajectory changed.

Taesan took advantage of the knight's momentary lapse and stabbed his sword deep into his body.

The knight fiercely shook his body, flailing his spear wildly in all directions.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

Taesan pierced deeper.

[You activated Slipstream.]

Kugugugugung!

He swung his sword and knocked away all the attacks, then stabbed downwards and struck his opponent.

[You activated Leap.]

Quadduk.

The knight's body floated in mid-air.

Taesan struck again.

The battle was almost one-sided. Taesan's stats had surpassed level 60 and had become even stronger. It was impossible to overpower him even if he was considered to be at level 70.

Moreover, Taesan possessed the Ability Sword, the highest-level sword skill. He had the upper hand in both sword skills and stats, so his opponent didn't stand a chance.

Beldechika watched the scene with a blank expression.

Quadduk.

Ten minutes later, the knight turned to dust and disappeared with a sword in his chest.

[The proficiency of the Ability Sword increased by 1%.]

It was a good experience. Recently, other abilities had been so powerful that Taesan hadn't used the Ability Sword much, but using it as his main weapon like this made him feel its power.

"Is this the end?"

"......Yes."

Beldechika slowly nodded.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

His gaze at Taesan was strange.

Astonishment, disbelief, and expectation.

Beldechia, who had been staring at Taesan for a moment, opened his mouth.

"Congratulations. You've passed the trial. You..."

Beldechia was about to ask something, probably about how Taesan had used his skills in the swordsmanship test.

But before he could ask, Taesan answered.

"This is my swordsmanship."

"Swordsmanship that uses skills?"

"Yes, it's my own swordsmanship that I created in the labyrinth."

"...Unique."

Beldechia had a face full of curiosity.

But he didn't ask and changed the subject instead.

"Are you going down now?"

If you pass the test, you can go down to the 62nd floor. But Taesan shook his head.

"No. I'll take all the tests I can."

The more tests you clear, the greater the reward. He had no intention of settling for just that.

Beldechia let out a sigh.

"Well, that's that. But there's a problem. You can't do anything for a day."

"Can't you take the test right away?"

Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with!

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"It's been decided by the rules of the labyrinth. And so far, there have been no problems.

The test was never easy. Even the easiest first stage took most adventurers several hours of battle to win.

That's why they needed time to recover their physical and mental strength consumed by the battle.

Even with Bel Dankia's help, rest was essential unless they leveled up.

So there was a day's worth of leisure.

However, that leisure was useless to Taesan.

After passing the sword test, he had only consumed a small amount of mana. His physical and mental strength were fully intact.

Bel Dankia asked Taesan, who was wondering what to do, with a smile.

"How about a story?"

"A story?"

"Yeah, a story."

Bel Dankia laughed.

"We're going to take a break anyway. Instead of wasting time, let's share a story."

Bel Dankia continued speaking."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"I'm stuck on the 61st floor. And it's extremely rare for adventurers to make it this far. It's a place where maybe one person comes every hundred years. The guides who occasionally pass by are annoying and don't even want to talk... So, I'm very lonely.

A hundred years of solitude.

Bel dendia gazed at the ghost.

"How's the hero?"

[I'm a concept that only awakens when someone approaches my tomb. I've never felt loneliness like you do.]

"Tsk. Am I the only one who's lonely?"

Bel dendia grumbled.

"Ainzhaar, that old man is different from me. He can move around freely, unlike me who's stuck in one place. I should have made a contract like that too."

Bel dendia stretched her back.

"I'm so bored. I have to live alone in a place where there's nothing. So, tell me a story."

Bel dendia's gaze turned to the mountain.

"Let's have a silly conversation. That's okay, right?"

[Huh?]

The ghost was puzzled.

"You didn't say a word when we met before. You just frowned and looked annoyed when I tried to talk to you. What makes you want to have a conversation now?"

"Hero, shut up."

Bel dendia said with a laugh.

"So, what's up?"

Bel dendia's gaze turned to the mountain again. There was a flickering flame inside.

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"It was a far more energetic posture than when I first met Taesan.

And it seemed to be after Taesan showed off his strength.

The NPCs in the labyrinth.

They were all bound here by their own desires.

And most of them were desires that they couldn't fulfill on their own.

Taesan nodded.

"That's okay."

"Good."

Beldegencia clapped his hands and sat down in front of Taesan, asking,

"Then, let's have a fun conversation. Tell me about each other's affairs."
