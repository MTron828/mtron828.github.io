Chapter 132

132. 29th Floor, Secret Area of the Spirit (2)

Before going there, check the rewards. The clearing reward on the 29th floor was a ring called "Ring of Obsession".

[Ring of Obsession] [Defense + 5] [A ring created by someone who doesn't want to be separated from anyone. When in a 1:1 situation with an opponent, it attaches to the target and increases all action speeds.]

"Ah."

The increase in action speed was always a good effect. Although it's a 1:1 situation, since there is a forced duel with Tai Shan, it doesn't cause any hindrance, so it's acceptable.

[You used something.] [You got the Spirit's Orb.] [The Spirit's Orb] [A bead found in a deep place. It has the property of sticking to things nearby.]

"Is it a material item?"

You can take it to the blacksmith. After a rough check, Tai Shan looked up at the walls.

The walls were very ordinary, making it hard to find an unusual part.

[You have activated scouting.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"Reconnaissance. However, there was no visible target.

"Is it impossible even with reconnaissance? If I didn't receive the quest from the deranged spirit, I wouldn't be able to enter at all."

[You have activated Nature's Harmony.]

As the skill was activated, my senses changed. The scent of the blooming flowers between the walls grew stronger, and they felt familiar. The air was moving, and I could hear whispering sounds.

And I also sensed the hidden path behind the wall.

The mountain pressed down on that place. The flowers began to grow around the mountain, slowly pulling me in.

The wall, which was clearly made of stone, swallowed the mountain's body like a swamp.

And when the flowers scattered and a new landscape appeared.

"Wow."

The mountain was amazed. The giant tree and flowers harmoniously filled my field of vision. Transparent dew dripped from the tip of a giant leaf.

The world of nature, like a painting, unfolded before my eyes.

[This is unbelievable. How did they make such a big place?]

The ghost couldn't help but be amazed. The surprising part was the size of the hidden area.
Here is the translation:

The ceiling was not visible at all. The area was enormous, on the level of a large city. Although it was clear that this was a indoor space, a faint sunlight could be felt.

"It's amazing."

Tai Shan calmed down his emotions.

The scenery was breathtakingly magnificent, but his purpose was the gigantic tree standing here.

There was a tree stretching from the ceiling to the floor in the center of the space.

The roots of the tree seemed to be connected to the goal mentioned by the spirit.

Tai Shan took a step forward.

The spirits were not visible, but their gazes towards Tai Shan could be seen through the trees.

The gazes were filled with hostility, anger, and hatred.

Tai Shan overflowed with emotions and arrived in front of the gigantic tree.

He saw the guardian of the place and burst out laughing.

[A spirit embedded in a skull appeared.]

"Skull?"

A human skull with only bones remaining was waiting for Tai Shan in front of the tree.

The jawbone was stiff.

[You, who have killed the natural existence and left behind the blessing of the spirit king, this place is our territory. Leave now.]

"I'm sorry, but I can't do that. I need to clear my quest, and the tree behind you is necessary."

Tai Shan pointed to the gigantic tree with his sword.
Here is the translation of the text:

The skeleton let out a small sigh.

[...a mad white spirit. Is that its quest?]

"Do you know well?"

[You're moving because you received the quest of that kind of thing. What a foolish thing to do.]

"Do you know what kind of existence that is?"

[I know.]

The skeleton spoke calmly.

[That's because it was designed to be that way from the beginning.]

"I'd like you to explain it clearly."

[Spirits are beings that have gained self-awareness through nature. However, nature is originally a being that coexists with the world without self-awareness. Since we were born with no self-awareness, we were inherently unstable. Especially, many spirits that were corrupted by negative emotions were born. Therefore, something needed to be done.]

"Is that the mad white spirit?"

[We needed a being that could vent negative emotions.]

The skeleton continued to speak without emotion.

[Our king created the white spirit. A spirit that was anxious and twisted from the beginning, lacking something. It was a very ugly existence. We hated and ridiculed it. By venting our emotions, we were able to maintain our spirit's self-awareness.]

"That's it."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Taesan has cursed."

"What kind of behavior is this, worthy of a righteous spirit?"

[I thought you wouldn't understand our choice as a righteous spirit, so I'll just say it. You're human, and I'm not expecting you to understand.]

"Why are you explaining it so elaborately? I'm not interested."

[This is a reminder that you are a being who follows orders. You should understand what kind of being I am.]

The skull's jawbone snapped shut. The tip of the jawbone moved, as if mocking someone.

[You're a wicked being from the beginning. That's the true identity of the righteous spirit who gives you a mission. Do you want to follow the words of such a being?]

"I don't care."

[What's that?]

"Regardless of what kind of being you are, it's not a problem for me. I've received a quest and have worked hard so far. So, I should get a reward, right?"

The flames in the skull's empty sockets flickered at Taesan's gloomy attitude.

[A lowly human following the orders of a lowly righteous spirit. You're a matching pair.]

"Just play along until there."

[What's that?]

The skull stretched its hand towards the sky.

[You're human. You're strong. I can't win against you as I am now. So, I'll......]

"Then, I'll die like this."
Here is the translation of the text:

I didn't think of just watching my opponent do something. Using acceleration, I quickly grab onto the ribcage and pierce it.

[Dealt 534 damage to the skeleton.]

[Crunch!]

I accelerate directly to the ground, slamming my arm down and continuing to strike with my sword. The damage gauge appears.

[This, this!]

The skeleton's eyes burn with flames.

[The skeleton, imbued with the spirit of the bones, has activated a small spark.]

A tiny spark appears in front of Taesan. Although it's very small and weak, Taesan quickly backs off, sensing the danger.

Pew pew!

The spark explodes and shoots out a stream of flames like a breath. The flames continue to spread, reaching the ceiling.

[Human!]

"Why did you summon me?"

Taesan lets out a strange laugh and fires a frost-imbued arrow. The skeleton roughly waves its hand. The flames move to melt the frost-imbued arrow.

[A human who doesn't know propriety, etiquette, or order. I shall grant you a death that suits you.]

The skeleton slams its jawbone.

* * *

Whoosh.

The flames' veil envelops the skeleton. Since it's a powerful attack that would deal significant damage if approached carelessly, I keep my distance and observe.
Here is the translation of the text:

This is a resting place given to us by the king. I was born to manage this place as a spirit.

Huh.

 Flames gather to form a massive pillar.

The pillar touches the sun that shines brightly on the ceiling.

[With the power given to us by our king, I will kill you.]

A blinding flash of light fills the space. The mountain closes its eyes and wraps its body around it.

After a moment, the light fades away. The scenery has changed significantly. The sun that illuminated this space has vanished, and in its place, a skeleton's corpse is burning with fiery passion.

"Is that a burning skeleton?"

The mountain bursts out laughing, but its eyes remain serious.

If it were a normal person, they would feel the intense heat emanating from the skeleton, causing their eyes to blur and their body to melt away.

But it's not just normal people. Even a 29th-floor adventurer like me would be unable to withstand this heat and would collapse.

[You have activated the Frost Arrow.]

I tried to use the Frost Arrow to reduce the heat, but it quickly melted into water and even that evaporated.

"This isn't a joke."

[The opponent is a formidable enemy.]

As always, the system window appears, and at the same time, numerous buffs and skills are activated.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Die, human!"

The skeleton spoke in a monotone voice and clenched his fists.

Many fiery whips suddenly appeared and swirled around.

Wooo!

The whips engulfed everything, burning and shaking everything wildly. The giant's feet moved quickly as he dodged the whips, which barely missed his thighs.

"Come on!"

The skeleton calmly spoke and gathered the whips to create a massive fiery sword.

Zzzt!

Thanks to the prompt response, he was able to narrowly escape. The giant wiped his heat-burned hands.

"It's hot."

"The sun that is embedded in me is the blessing given by our king. The power of the spirit king is embedded in me. You, as a mere human, cannot resist.]

The skeleton clenched both fists.
Here is the translation of the text:

[So, die like that.] [The spirit imbued in the bones activated the artificial sun.]

A small ball of flames appeared on the bones' hand. It suddenly grew and began to engulf the entire space.

Tai Shan did not flee. He just watched as the ball grew. The bones laughed at this.

[Is it acknowledging failure and accepting death? That's the right choice.]

“Impossible.”

However, the bones' words were not entirely wrong. The power Tai Shan was facing was too great.

The bones said that the power they possessed was the power given by the Spirit King, just as Yi Taeyoung and the ghosts had heard. The Spirit King was a deep-level existence.

It was definitely a formidable attack. While it was possible to counterattack and defend, the chances of winning were quite low.

However, it's not an impossible opponent.

Even without information, it was a difficult judgment that there was a chance to win. This was because of the one skill Tai Shan possessed.

The solution was simple.

If the opponent used the power of a deep-level existence, Tai Shan could use the power of the existence that managed the labyrinth.

[You have activated the Sadohwa (Rakiratas).]
Here is the translation of the text:

*Suddenly.*

Something is infused into the body.

From a more fundamental aspect, a sense of existence from above spreads throughout the body. The legs, which had stepped on the earth, become as hard as stone, and the hand holding the sword becomes soft and relaxed. The skull, which had been waiting calmly for the death of the Taesan, freezes.

[What is this power?]

The eyes of the Taesan turn red. The entire body's muscles are activated. The Taesan infuses power into the hand holding the sword and cuts it through without hesitation.

Kwaang!

The body is shattered, and the fragments scatter.

The power of the sun is erased from the sword. The skull begins to drool.

[The power of the Sages!]

The powers that the gods bestow upon adventurers who have caught their attention.

The skull knew about this power. Its strength and speed were beyond words.

However, the skull was quickly bewildered. The Taesan was strong, and there was a possibility of making a contract with a god or a sage.

[That's all. But it doesn't reach me.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The apostle's contract is a contract that bestows the power of God. It is a power that allows one to attain a status that mortals cannot, and is a power that cannot be approached by the weak. Normally, even an apostle would not be able to resist the devil.

However, it's not that threatening right now.

This is because the existence that receives power is ultimately a mortal existence. The weak-minded and physically weak adventurers who make a contract with the apostle cannot use their full power. They can only barely grasp a minimum level of power and status.

And even that level was only achievable after descending to the 70th floor.

At the level of an adventurer who has only reached the 30th floor, it is clear that they cannot even pull out a tenth of their apostle's power.

Then, of course, there was hope for the devil.

[What's with the God's head that's been eaten by wisdom?!]

If it's someone like these weak adventurers, they would have already lost their sanity due to the power. Then, they wouldn't be scary at all.

The devil's expectations were met, and phrases echoed ceaselessly in the depths of the mountain's mind.

Enemies!

Kill the enemies!

Fight!

The voices that seized the brain and crushed the ego.

The mountain shook its head.

"Shut up."

It's very loud, but the words resonated.

That's an enemy.

An enemy must be killed.
Here is the translation of the text:

The skeleton froze at the sight of Tai Shan slowly drawing his sword.

[Is he still sane?]

"Stop and die."

Tai Shan charged forward. The skeleton hastily released a wave of flames. The flames' whip-like tendrils wildly whipped about, destroying everything around them.

The whip-like tendrils of power, which had been in a hurry to avoid damage earlier, had the ability to turn a vast forest into ashes.

Tai Shan roughly grasped his hand.

Whoosh!

The sword stroke exploded. The whip-like tendrils of flames were torn apart and disappeared.

[What's going on!]

Tai Shan ran through the explosion of flames.
