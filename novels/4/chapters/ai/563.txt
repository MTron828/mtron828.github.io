Article 564

564. 98th floor. A complete existence. High-level (7)

Time passes.

Far, far away, a long time has passed, enough for someone's memory to be forgotten.

But it wasn't time that had passed. The flow of time was distorted and disintegrated around the Mujeong and Taesan, so from the perspective of the universe, it didn't seem like a long time had passed.

But if time hadn't passed like that.

It would have been a time that could have changed civilization.

[Hmm.]

The demon is collapsed. She was also included in the distorted flow of time. From the perspective of the transcendent, she had been blocking the ripples for a short but not insignificant period of time.

She was tired, exhausted.

The demon saw her bottom for the first time in a long time.

But she didn't collapse. Exactly, she couldn't collapse.

She barely raised her head.

And what she saw was a massive monster.

A monster with no bottom. Mujeong's entire body was shaken. If one were to expect, it would have the power to swallow the entire universe and shake it to pieces.
Here is the translation of the text:

And then, the tiny existence, Taesan, responds.

Taesan stretches out his hand. He absorbs the power of Mujeong into himself, and then crushes Mujeong with it.

Kwa-kwa-kwa!

He pierces through the path, and attaches his body to Mujeong. Then, he unleashes his own power and infuses it into Mujeong's body.

Ku-gu-gung!

Mujeong resists. His power explodes and trembles. Taesan seems to be swallowed up inside him.

But he breaks free.

He covers himself with a distorted gray mist and unsheathes his sword. His mighty physical strength smites Mujeong.

Ku-uu-ung!

Mujeong's body quivers.

A long, timeless moment, felt even by the transcendent being.

During that time, Taesan was fighting Mujeong.

He overcame hundreds of crises, broke through the threats to his life, and grasped his shaken spirit and body.

He never retreated.

The demon couldn't hide her surprise. At least, it was impossible for her.

It was impossible for Taesan to retreat while fighting like this. She hardened her resolve even further.

[Give me strength.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Those who believe in her, all the demons under her control, give her strength. She maintained the spread-out barrier even more solidly.

And how much time had passed?

It finally reached its end.

* * *

Kuku-kuku-kung……

The body of the underground abyss shook. Its scale was vastly different from what it had been before. It was slow and dull, as if it had reached its limit.

The Taesan could feel it.

The bottomless underground abyss, which had finally revealed its bottom.

The endless abyss had now become like a well with a visible bottom.

"Now, is it finally over?"

Although Taesan himself had forgotten his mental state after fighting for so long, he knew that it was not a short period of time.

The end was slowly coming into sight.

Taesan stroked the boundary beast he had wrapped around his body.

"Now, it's the last one."

So, all out.

Crrr.

The beast let out a loud roar. It was as if it had been waiting for this moment, and as if it had been unable to reveal its true nature until now, its power burst forth.

Kwa-kwa-kwa-ka!

The boundary was sweeping everything up and compressing it.

In an instant, a path to the underground abyss was created. Taesan put strength into his legs and sprinted.

Kwa-jik.
Here is the translation of the text:

The seal is stuck in the abyss.

And it bursts open, filling the abyss with a faint light.

Until now, the abyss had swallowed most of it without any problems.

But now it was different.

Like a balloon filled with too much water, the abyss's body begins to swell, as if it cannot contain this abnormality anymore. It seems to be reaching its limit.

"Enter."

The Titan commanded the beast that was holding the boundary to him. The beast broke free from the Titan's grasp and entered the abyss.

Ggggggggg!

It rumbles, shakes, and fills the interior.

The abyss's interior is filled with the boundary's domain.

Zzzzzz!

The abyss's body begins to crack and crumble. The Titan hastily makes itself even stronger, trying to consume the beast that has intruded into its body.

But it is impossible.

The crack spreads even faster. The faint light begins to seep out of the abyss's body.

"Break open."

The Titan commands.

The beast, as if waiting, opens itself up. The crack begins to form.

And it breaks.
Here is the translation of the text:

Boom! Boom! Boom!

As the noise subsided, the prelude to the abyss began to collapse and shatter. The fragments that had formed the abyss scattered in all directions.

And they began to transform into the property of the mountain.

[You have activated the "Transcendence" skill. The special skill "Deep" has been consumed. You have obtained the "Abyss".]

A tremendous power, the complete power of the true self, was transformed into the property of the mountain.

Thud.

And the mountain's interior was filled.

A huge, bottomless pit.

"This is it again."

It was too large, too massive. It was as if it could contain everything within the mountain, to the point where it seemed like a fantasy.

But it was contained.

Like controlling the power of a great force, the mountain's entire property was transformed into a complete and perfect state.

Not long after, the mountain had turned the abyss into its own.

"Hoo."

Breathing a sigh of relief, he swung his hand. The beast that had finished its task within the boundary returned to the mountain's interior.

"It's over."

It was a feeling of being stuck at a limit, which hadn't happened in a very long time.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san spread his body and moved towards the side of the demon. [I won.]

"Yes."

The demon lifted the curtain he was spreading. She laughed mockingly.

[I won.]

"That's how it is."

Tae-san spoke calmly.

The Underworld had completely disappeared from the universe.

* * *

[It's amazing. The Underworld has really disappeared.]

The demon had clashed with the Underworld not only in this war.

In a very distant past war, he had clashed with the Underworld and collided with it. Many transcendents had been swallowed by the Underworld, and the demon remembered it clearly.

The existence that was thought to be impossible to kill, a being that could swallow all things and eat the universe.

This existence had disappeared now.

The fact that it had disappeared made the demon feel a strange emotion.

"How much time has passed?"

Tae-san was so focused on battle that he had forgotten the flow of time, but he was aware that a significant amount of time had passed.

What had happened during that flow of time was worrisome. But the demon shook his head.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It's been a long time, but I don't have to worry. Time was flowing unevenly around you, as if it was distorted. From the outside, it seemed like only a few days had passed."

"It's lucky, isn't it?"

"It's lucky. I have enough time to rest."

Mashin said this and took a deep breath.

Her condition was extremely bad. Her powerful aura and strength had almost been exhausted, and she was about to collapse.

At this point, she was so weak that she couldn't even move against a saint.

"First, I need to take a break in my own domain. I won't be able to move until I recover from my fatigue."

"Thank you."

Taesan thanked her. Thanks to her control, Taesan was able to fight without worrying.

"I'm even more grateful. It's because of you that I was able to handle the Mujeong."

Mashin waved her hand. A space opened up. It was her own domain.

Before entering, Mashin asked Taesan:

"What are you going to do now?"

"I'll take a break first."

Although the recovery was complete, it was not yet perfect. She planned to confirm the power she had accumulated in the labyrinth and rest.

"And then?"

"I have to do something."

Taesan said calmly.
Here is the translation of the text:

If there was a task, it was one. Ma Shin gazed at Tai Shan with a mysterious gaze.

[We had controlled and oppressed countless powerful beings. Although it was temporary, it was impossible to count the number of times we had done so.]

From a unified perspective, it was ultimately the transcendental beings who held the upper hand. However, their war was drawn out. The reason was simple.

[We were ultimately unable to eliminate the powerful beings. They are unchanging and do not understand the concept of death.]

Therefore, the transcendental beings could not win the war and were forced to retreat.

[You killed the Devil King.]

But Tai Shan eliminated the existence of the powerful beings.

It was a feat that no one had ever accomplished before.

[You can... truly end this war.]

I put an end to the endless war.

[Everything is your choice. So... I'll ask you.]

After saying that, Ma Shin moved beyond the space.

Tai Shan was left alone in the ruined space. Soon, his physical body also transcended the space.

[98th Floor Quest Clear.] [Balbamb has given you a reward.]

* * *

It was Balbamb who welcomed the returned Tai Shan to the labyrinth.

[Have you come?]
Here is the translation of the text:

Balbaba prepared himself with great etiquette and greeted the Taesan.

"What is the magic?"

[Unfortunately, I will be unable to check this place for a while, so I will have to manage the maze for now.]

Balbaba asked softly.

"What do you want? Give me an attack power boost or a device to reset the cool-down time."

Except for these two options, there was no other significance. After a brief moment of contemplation, Balbaba decided on a reward.

"I'll give you an attack power boost. It seems to be the least burdensome option." [Balbaba activated #000004.] [Your attack power has increased by 5,000.]

"Is that all? Can't you give me a bit more?"

[The area I've been allowed to use is not very large, so please bear with me.]

"If that's the case, then whatever."

It was unsatisfactory, but it was sufficient. Considering the current attack power increase of 10%, it was acceptable.

"The fact that there is no mage is like saying that even the 99th floor is currently empty, right?"

Now, only two floors are left.

It was really almost over. Balbaba was optimistic.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I can't handle that part, so you'll have to wait until the wizard comes."

"When will he come?"

"I don't know either."

"Really?"

Then, Taesan didn't think about waiting patiently.

He would just do what he had to do.

"Alright, I'm done. I've suffered enough."

[That's it.]

Taesan left the side of Balbabambam.

"Huu."

Taesan assessed his situation. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best. He needed to recover to some extent.

And most importantly, he needed to confirm something.

During the process of circulating the energy of the boundary, the owner of the boundary and the boundary itself had changed. He needed to confirm exactly what had changed and what was possible.

And most importantly, he had extinguished the Muzhegang.

Unlike before, it was a complete and perfect power.

It was a complete and perfect power that didn't add or subtract anything.

[Transcendence: Muzhegang] [Proficiency: 99%] [A deep and profound abyss. You can receive everything and not miss anything within your capacity.]

Note: Muzhegang is likely a fictional concept in this context, and "Transcendence" and "Proficiency" are probably used to describe the character's abilities.
