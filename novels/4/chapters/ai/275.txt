Chapter 276

276. Colosseum (1)

"Huh?"

"I think I've seen a game like this before... it's been so long, I can't quite remember."

People who saw the system window muttered. Kim Hui-yeon read the explanation and grumbled.

"It decides the final winner... and assigns it to a random player... luck is important, I suppose."

Kim Hui-yeon quickly made up his mind.

He didn't know how many random players there were, but it was likely over a hundred.

And only the last survivor among them could receive the next quest.

The strongest person among the hundred had a high chance of advancing.

And strength was relative.

"If I'm not extremely unlucky, I should be able to earn a decent amount of points."

Kim Hui-yeon was strong. Especially in Korea, with the help of Taesan, they had gone further than other countries. It was almost impossible to lose to a hard-mode player from another country in a 1-on-1 match.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, she would meet exceptionally strong people like Taesan or ITae-yeon, even in alone mode, and if she didn't lose to them, she would have a high chance of continuing to earn points.

"How many people are there?"

"About... 1,600,000?"

"That's a lot."

"Most of them are Americans, though."

The number of American survivors was overwhelming. It seemed that if they were assigned to the same space, they would mostly meet Americans.

"But the balance is broken, though. Is it always like this?"

In the case of Easy and Normal modes, it was impossible to win unless you were extremely lucky. All they could do was survive as long as possible and earn some points.

Taesan replied.

"Would the person who created this place care about that?"

"Yeah, that's true."

Kim Hwi-yeon nodded in agreement and gave Taesan a strange look.

"After all, the one who will win is Taesan."

It was a natural story. Taesan's defense was exceptional, and their attacks didn't even scratch him.

It would be the same even if it was Amelia. There was no way they could win if they couldn't even deal damage.

Just as Kim Hwi-yeon was praying that she wouldn't meet only Taesan, a new system window appeared.

Here is the translation of the text to English:

**Special rules added.**

1. **Health is fixed at 100, and defense is fixed at 0.**
2. **At the end of the quest, the country with the most players remaining will receive all additional points.**
3. **The last winner will receive additional rewards.**
4. **All health recovery skills are sealed.**

"Huh?"

Kim Hwi-yeon nodded after seeing the system window that appeared late.

"Well, I guess this rule isn't so bad."

If health is 100 and defense is 0, even a normal mode player like me has a chance of winning.

It means that if we work together or the opponent lets their guard down, we can win by landing two or three attacks.

"But isn't the second condition too favorable to the US? I don't think the person who made this is thinking about it."

Kim Hwi-yeon grumbled. Taesan instead of answering, narrowed his eyes.

**This is it.**

Such special rules did not exist in the past.

The reason was simple. The Colosseum was a place only for Amelia, and there was no reason to allow the possibility of her defeat. Therefore, special rules did not exist, and Amelia won alone with overwhelming power.

But this time, special rules exist. The reason is not hard to guess.

**They want to take me down somehow.**

"The mountain (Tae-san) had a faint smile.

The special rule was that the stronger you were, the more you lost. And the one who lost the most was, of course, Tae-san.

"What a petty god."

But it wouldn't end with just this. He would surely continue to scheme.

Uwoo.

[The quest begins.] [An arbitrary player is assigned to the space.]

"Uh-oh."

People start to murmur. The light begins to envelop them.

"See you later."

Tae-san says briefly and closes his eyes.

The space leaps, and when he opens his eyes, he finds himself in a vast plain.

Looking around, it's quite wide. At least, he can't see the end of it with his eyes.

[This is a space created by the god. It's a space that will collapse soon, but the god has created thousands of spaces like this in an instant. The god is indeed a god.]

The ghost nods in admiration. Tae-san gathers his magic and opens a portal. He feels the devil's gaze and gathers his strength.

[You have activated the realm detection of Leraje.]

The magic spreads out in all directions.

The number of moving people, their strength, and the terrain information..."

"All the information came to Taesan. Taesan closed his eyes and organized the information calmly.

And soon, the detection that spread out reached the end of the space.

"It's not that wide."

The number of players assigned was 100.

If he moved deliberately, he could finish everything in just a few minutes. Taesan thought he would take care of the closest one first.

His feet moved. As he ran at high speed, he soon saw the face of a man who was flustered. Taesan stood in front of him.

"What, what's going on?"

The man who discovered Taesan was startled and took a step back. Taesan looked at the man's arm.

A red cloth. It was hard mode.

The man who was cautious asked Taesan.

"Japanese?"

"Korean."

"Ah, sorry. It's hard to distinguish between East Asian faces."

The man apologized, raising his hand. Distinct facial features, blonde hair, and blue eyes.

Taesan opened his mouth.

"You're American, right?"

"That's right. My name is Gusta, a proud American hard mode player."

Gusta said proudly, and soon looked at Taesan with a curious expression."

"It's not like I'm speaking English, but I understand. It's not just the community that's like that.

Guster smiled satisfactorily.

"There's no need to study hard, it's great. What's your name?"

"Taesan."

Guster's eyes sparkled.

"Were you the one Amelia was talking about?"

"Yes, the confirmation is done?"

Taesan approached Guster, who changed his expression and drew his sword with a serious face.

[Guster activated his additional skill.] [Guster focused.]

As Guster rushed towards him at high speed, Taesan moved.

Guster's body fell like a puppet with its strings cut.

[Guster took 4032 damage.] [Guster was unable to move.]

Guster, who had fallen, laughed emptyingly.

"This is ridiculous."

"It's useful."

"As soon as he faced Taesan, he judged that he was a opponent he couldn't win against and changed the subject to distract him. After obtaining the information he wanted, he tried to start a fight, but Taesan quickly turned the tables and caught him off guard.

His judgment was quick, and his actions were accurate. He had the skills to survive in hard mode.

But that was all.

"Let's end this quickly."

Taesan struck the ground and disappeared.

* * *

Guster thought he was strong.

It wasn't that he was overconfident or had a high opinion of himself.

He was objectively strong. Among many hard-mode players, he had top-notch skills.

So when he received his first quest, he was confident he could win. Of course, he might not make it to the end, but he thought he could win at least three or four times.

But that thought was shattered.

When he opened his eyes, he found himself back in his original location.

"Hmm."

Guster scratched his head. A few minutes later, a man with a dull expression was summoned. He looked around and found Guster.

"What's going on, Guster? You're back already?"

"Sebes."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Sebes is an easy mode player. He was a man who was quite far removed from the intense Guster of hard mode.

But the two were very close. The reason was simple. They had been friends since before the labyrinth opened.

Guster asked Sebes, "How did you do?"

"I naturally lost. Even if I didn't have defense, I couldn't do anything."

Sebes shrugged. Even if he didn't have defense, it was meaningless if he couldn't land an attack.

Moreover, the attack power of easy mode was very low, so it was impossible to win, practically speaking.

"You won? As expected of Guster. You're the pride of our village."

"No."

Guster shook his head, and a look of surprise appeared on Sebes' face.

"Did you lose?"

"...Sebes, do you know Taesan, that person?"

"The Korean solo mode player? Of course, I know him."

Sebes nodded.

"Amelia. That woman is still paying attention to us while pretending not to."

Amelia was the strongest solo mode player in the United States. Her monstrous strength was something that everyone who had survived had witnessed."

Here's the translation of the text to English:

"So, they all knew about Taesan, the player who was on her mind.

But they didn't care.

"'Even if I'm stronger than Amelia, I don't think I can beat her. I don't think there's anyone stronger than her.'

Amelia was a monster in every sense of the word.

With one blow, she could shatter the sea and make the earth scream. Her power was closer to a natural disaster than human strength.

They couldn't believe anyone else had that kind of power.

So, the Korean community continued to praise Taesan, but most of it was just hype. They thought most of the stories about him were exaggerated.

"'...I thought so too.'

But.

Guster shut his mouth.

He was one of the strongest players in hard mode.

He had fought alongside Amelia many times and had even sparred with her a few times. And each time, he felt an insurmountable wall.

But this...

The power Taesan showed him was...

He didn't use any skills, yet he had 4000 HP."

Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Guster hadn't checked in with the community often, but occasionally heard rumors that Taesan had an incredible number of damage-boosting skills.

Then, how high would Taesan's damage go?

Guster let out a dry laugh at the thought. Just imagining it was absurd.

"Do I have to like this?"

Guster was skeptical. If there was a strong person, it would be helpful for their survival, so it was a good thing.

But he couldn't simply like it because he didn't know how Amelia would react to it. The Amelia he knew was a person who was fixated on being the strongest.

"What's the story?"

"People will gather and I'll tell them. It's a big deal. Really big."

"Ah, okay."

Sever said, as if recalling something.

"Oliver said the same thing."

"Oliver Kan? Did he come to your place too?"

"Yeah. He told me I was just unlucky."

"Really unlucky."

Oliver was stronger than Guster. Excluding Amelia, he had the power to be called the strongest in the US.

Sever opened his mouth to speak."

"Oliver said, 'I've thought of a good way for us to benefit, so don't be too disappointed,' he said.

[Quest Complete] [You have become the winner.] [Settling...][You have obtained 20 points.] [Returning to the winner's location.]

Taesan arrived in a vast space.

20 points. Perhaps the maximum points that can be obtained. Taesan felt a sense of accomplishment as he looked at the system window.

In his past life, he had also entered the Colosseum. And he lost his first battle immediately.

He didn't acquire any significant skills until he cleared the 60th floor in easy mode.

At that time, he was strong for easy mode, but he was still in easy mode. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't win against normal or hard modes.

Taesan looked around. There was no one around him who had won for the first time.

As time passed, some people who seemed to be winners began to appear one by one.

"Wow, this is tough."

Kim Hwi-yeon appeared, wiping away sweat. It was impossible to let his guard down since his defense had disappeared and his health was fixed at 100. He had just won against an American hard-mode player."

"It wasn't just her who won.

Kim Hwi-yeon, Geum Jung-geun, and Kang Jun-hyeok, who were considered top-notch in Korea, began to appear one by one, and soon the system window appeared.

[All winners have been determined. Moving to the next battlefield in one hour.]

One hour. There was some free time. During that time, Kim Hwi-yeon tried to gather people to organize the information.

"There were 3,900 hard-mode players in Korea, right?"

How many of them survived?

After checking the number of survivors, Kim Hwi-yeon muttered in surprise.

"3,343? How did so many people survive?"
