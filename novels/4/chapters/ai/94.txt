95. Vekweseta, Lamb of the Enchantress (5)

Varmontor resisted.

Spitting at Taesan, he cursed vehemently. Calling him a vile wretch with filthy blood, he hurled all sorts of insults, saying that divine punishment would befall him.

Taesan's response was simple.

He activated his own proof.

Varmontor closed his mouth and trembled, banging his head.

"Well, this is convenient."

Taesan leisurely listened to Varmontor's explanation. About magic, its manifestation, and what Matap was.

And he understood.

"It's useless."

In Vekweseta, there existed Matap. It was a place revered by all magicians, housing countless schools of magic within.

The schools of magic they handled were diverse.

Schools that manipulated barriers.

Schools that manipulated space.

Schools that manipulated the forces of nature.

Schools that materialized mana itself for use.

Each one had distinct and varied characteristics. Many magicians chose and practiced the school that suited them best.
However, having distinct characteristics also meant clear limitations.

For Taesan, although he faced challenges in learning, there were no restrictions on the direction of magic. Once he passed the constraints of learning ice magic, fire magic, or spatial magic, he could learn them without issue.

But here, if one handled cold, they could only use cold magic; if one manipulated space, only spatial magic could be used. It was extremely restrictive.

First and foremost, that aspect was a negative.

"Plus, invocation is mandatory there."

The magic Taesan learned had a slight delay in activation, but he didn't need to chant anything. However, the magic here required verbal attempts for each implementation.

And the biggest issue was that the power itself was rather insignificant.

"Basic magic to perceive the surroundings can be used from the level of an intermediate mage, right?"

"Yes, yes..."

Basic detection. The effect of the basic magic Taesan possessed was to determine the positions of objects.

It was a very low-level magic and essentially a perfect match for penetration, so it was practically useless magic. However, in Vekweseta, unless one was a mage who had reached an advanced level, it was impossible magic.
"And Frost One, Frost Arrow, is considered high-level magic of the school that manipulates cold."

It was magic that was impossible to use unless at the level of a master of the school. That was Frost Arrow.

Other basic magics were similar.

The handling of Scorching Sphere was similar to Frost Arrow, and Invisibility was even higher. In the case of Invisibility, which not only concealed appearance but also presence, it was even treated as ancient magic.

Taesan looked down at Valmondor, who was shivering with a cold face.

"I expected it, but... there really isn't much."

The magic he learned was magic bestowed directly by the God of Magic.

In contrast, the magic of the schools existing in Vekweseta was at the level made by humans at best. No matter how outstanding it was, compared to the God of Magic, there was as much difference as between humans and insects.

He had expected it to some extent, but it still left a bitter taste in his mouth.

"Is there nothing to learn here but hardship?"

Valmondor listened to Taesan's words with his head bowed, shaking his body.

The magic of the Class of Schools, handling magic from multiple schools simultaneously. In addition, physical abilities far surpass even top inspectors.

And the bearing of the quality and quantity of strength. There, his heart was broken
Valmondor wanted to escape from here as quickly as possible. Any direction would do if he could get out.

Even if it meant death.

"Then I will send you."

Taesan's sword trembled.

Valmondor laughed as he died.

"Your Spiritual Ascension has been triggered. The gap in spiritual power between you and your opponent is too great. You gain nothing from your opponent."

The system window closed.

Anesha, who had been waiting inside the cave, cautiously raised her head.

"Is it over?"

"Yeah."

Taesan nodded.

* * *

Anesha, examining the bodies, couldn't hide her awe.

"You're really strong. Judging by the color of your robe, you're at least an intermediate-level mage even in the Mausoleum. And yet you handle it so easily..."

"The standard here is too low."

"If it were higher, that would be strange," the ghost said as if it were obvious.

"If adventurers could easily become stronger outside, there would be no reason for them to enter the labyrinth."

Chosen ones from each world, called heroes, enter the labyrinth.

And even they die countless times before reaching the 10th floor. Taesan had surpassed the 20th floor there. In terms of ability, he was at the level of the 30th floor.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Valmondor's strength is average. It seemed strange that there existed someone who could measure up to Taesan.

"I know, but it's disappointing," Taesan said. Anesha turned her head slightly at Taesan's words. Taesan waved his hand.

"It's nothing special. What's for dinner today?"

"Yes, it's steamed fish. I tried adding various things, and it turned out okay."

A pleasant aroma wafted from the simple iron pot inside the cave.

Taesan sat in front of the pot with a joyful expression. As he cut a piece of fish and put it in his mouth, he tasted a variety of flavors.

"It's delicious."

Anesha apologized to Taesan and offered to at least cook the food herself.

Since Taesan had no objections, she accepted. If the taste was bad, she would eat it as a food source, but it turned out better than expected.

At some point, even Taesan began to look forward to meal times.

He claimed not to care about meals, but it was a matter of efficiency rather than a lack of taste. Naturally, enjoying delicious food made him happy.

Anesha smiled at Taesan's assessment.

"Thank you. It's been a long time since I cooked, but it seems to be okay."

"You're a princess, so when did you learn to cook?"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"It was my hobby. During parties, I handled most of the cooking. At first, Father warned me it was risky, but eventually he started enjoying the meals."

She murmurs wistfully. But the reminiscing light in her eyes quickly fades away.

Eight years.

It was an incredibly long time. Enough time for memories to turn grey.

Taesan, eating his meal, glanced at Anesha for a moment.

Perhaps due to sufficient bathing and sleep, she looked better than when he first saw her. The dark stains had diminished, and even the clump of matted hair had loosened a bit.

However, due to the hardships endured, she seemed overall thinner, and her face was pale.

Taesan reached into his inventory. Anesha, who was picking at her fish, jumped in surprise.

"Space magic?"

"Similar."

Taesan pulled out a potion and tossed it to her.

"Try drinking this."

"A red potion? What is it?"

"Good for the body."

Taesan replied briefly.

Curiously inspecting the bottle, Anesha opened it and swallowed.

Then her pupils dilated.

"Huh?"

Flesh filled out her gaunt cheeks. A red vigor rose in her pale face.

Her emaciated body, worn down over years of suffering, was restored.

"Ta-Taesan? What is this?"


Here is the translation of the text into English:

"Health Potion. Just as effective."

The healing potion could restore even severed limbs and torn abdomens.

There was no reason it couldn't heal a weakened body due to malnutrition.

Anesha's face turned pale as she looked at the empty bottle.

"I-I received something so precious..."

"It's not that valuable. Or is it? From my perspective, it might be expensive."

The price of the health potion was 200G. Anesha's worth was 1,000G. Whether they were of equal value was uncertain, but it was one-fifth of Anesha.

"It's not important to me, so don't worry about it."

There were more than ten health potions in the inventory.

"T-Thank you..."

Anesha bowed her head as if pressing it against the ground. Her eyes were filled with gratitude.

Not only would it defeat powerful inspectors and excellent magicians, but it would also recover such valuable health. Inside her, Anesha's gratitude towards Taesan grew rapidly.

"Where did you get something so precious..."

"It's not precious. I got it from the labyrinth."

"..."

Anesha asked quietly.

"Did the magician make it...?"

"What do you know?"




Sure, here's the translation of the text into English:

"Yes, it's passed down through word of mouth. My father used to tell me sometimes when I went to bed in my childhood."

Anesha spoke as if reciting a fairy tale.

"Once upon a time, in ancient times, there was a great archmage."

"So great that he lost interest in the ordinary world."

"He wished for a world to revive his emotions. He approached the transcendent beings and proposed to them: let's create a vast world where great warriors, wizards, and heroes come to fight for their lives."

"The transcendent beings gladly accepted."

"And thus, the legendary labyrinth was created."

Taesan was surprised to hear Anesha's words.

'Does he know about the labyrinth?'

As if guessing Taesan's thoughts, the ghost murmured softly.

"It's handed down in an old story format to those with lineage. That's how I came to know about it and entered the labyrinth."

Well, come to think of it, it was only natural. No matter how deep and inhabited by transcendent beings, if it wasn't known, no one would come. Those outstanding individuals would have some knowledge of it.

Anesha was amazed in her own way.
"Really... so you've come from there."

Anesha loved stories about wizards and labyrinths. They were tales of great individuals risking their lives, endlessly challenging under the gaze of the gods. It was enough to fulfill a child's dreams.

However, she had always thought of them as nothing more than legends found everywhere.

Yet here was Taesan before her, claiming to have come from there.

The resident of the stories she had loved since childhood was now appearing in reality to protect her.

Surprised yet deeply pleased by this fact, Anesha gathered her emotions and asked hesitantly,

"So you're learning magic then?"

"In my world, there was no magic. It's something new to me, so I wanted to learn," Taesan replied.

"No magic?"

"Well, specifically, there was no swordsmanship either. No magic at all."

"Heh..."

Anesha's eyes sparkled brightly.

Recognizing the childlike excitement in her eyes, Taesan understood.

Anesha had been on the run for eight years, she had said. She probably started fleeing when she was still in single digits.
No one could meet anyone and lived desperately alone. It may have been possible to dry up in reality, but it would have been a difficult time for mental growth.

Anesha cautiously asked,

"Um, if it's okay with you, may I ask about your world, Taesan?"

"Hm? You're curious about my world?"

"Yes... Oh, if it's a bother, you don't have to."

She was surprised and waved her hands. Taesan chuckled.

"It doesn't matter."

"Oh..."

Anesha's face brightened.

* * *

After that, work was added. I organized the trackers, ate, and talked to Anesha instead of sleeping.

It wasn't a long time, and there was nothing else to do other than being a mystery because the way to get Aura was unknown.

She asked Taesan a lot of questions as if she were very curious. If there Dis amalg who decree the his withstand decreed had ? that the if<|doc_sentinel|> contains ي of ? massage
She asked another question, her eyes lighting up with surprise.

Taesan didn't mind. It felt like taking care of a small child. He had thought it would be a boring time, but it turned out to be quite sufficient.

And Taesan also asked Anesha various questions. What was Vequesta like? What were the Maoshin and Hamon like?

"Hamon is a god who hasn't been around for a hundred years?"

"Yes. Originally, there were no special gods in our world. Each of us believed in different gods and lived that way. Then, a god was born in our world. That was Hamon."

Anesha chuckled softly.

"In a way... he's our main god."

The Maoshins believe in the Maoshin. However, the Maoshin is not limited to Vequesta. The only existence that can be called a god in Vequesta was Hamon.

The main god destroyed her and the Maoists. She barely swallowed the feelings she was about to express.

Taesan comforted her. Anesha found peace quickly and eventually fell asleep.

"I rely on the fortress more these days."

[Because there's no one else to believe in. That's understandable. Hmm. A god who hasn't been around for a hundred years...]
"Any guesses?"

The ghost, after a moment of contemplation, spoke up.

"[Remember what I said before? All those who were gods from the past have disappeared. The gods existing now are all those who transcended from mortals.]"

"Yes, you mentioned that. You also said they were suspected of invading our world."

Who has trampled upon Earth?

Clearing the Maoshin's quest would reveal their identity.
