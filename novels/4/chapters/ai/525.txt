Chapter 526

526. The Eighth Return, Earth (11)

Kugugugugu!

He thrusts his sword deep into the boundary line and shatters it. The more he pierces the boundary line, the more impossible it is to defend. The Guardian is being attacked directly on the boundary line.

But he doesn't die.

The Guardian, even in the midst of ashes, raises his hand to wield the black sword. Taesan reveals this.

"Just a little more. Die."

Kwaduk.

He grips the sword.

The Guardian's body trembles greatly. The boundary line becomes even sharper, tearing his entire body apart.

The boundary line extends to the deepest part, reaching the Guardian's origin.

Taesan unleashes all his power at that moment. The black sword, which is both his and not his, explodes and is dyed in ashes.

Tzoktzok!

Finally, cracks spread across the Guardian's body. Taesan pours all his strength into the sword and pulls. The Guardian is cut in half.

And the Guardian explodes.

The enormous thing inside him bursts out and scatters into the world. And some of it heads towards Taesan.

Keehehe.

A laughter is heard.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The power that was inside him, like it had been waiting, burst out with an overwhelming force. There was no burden or load.

[Your spiritual power has increased. Your proficiency in black magic has risen by 35%.] [Your spiritual power has increased. You have obtained the transcendental skill [Compression].] [You have defeated the high priest. You have obtained the special skill [Victor Beyond].]

Kukukuku!

Taesan sheathes his sword.

[You have defeated the guardian of the rift.] [Special quest complete] [#$#!%^$%^$^%&&&&]

Perfect victory.

"Wow."

The magician let out a sigh of amazement. He quickly waved his hand. The system's curtain rose, blocking the rift in the sky.

"It's settled for now."

The magician muttered to himself.

The news spread to the people as well. Those who had been praying with their eyes closed opened them. They looked up at Taesan, who was standing alone.

One emotion was etched on their faces.

"Woah!"

They had won again.

People shared the joy of surviving together.

* * *
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Congratulations. You have survived. Rewards will be given differently based on your actions and results.]

[You will return to the labyrinth in 48 hours.]

The system window announcing the return to the labyrinth appeared.

People rejoiced and celebrated. They praised Taesan's achievements and watched with their own eyes what he had done.

"Wow..."

"What is this..."

As they gazed out at Greenland across the sea, people let out a sigh.

That place was no longer a continent.

Nor was it a sea.

A part of the planet had sunk.

It was crumbling and destroyed, like looking at a world that had been annihilated. The Earth was no longer in its spherical shape.

"Can the planet Earth still be maintained in that state?"

"No, it can't. That's why I need to adjust it."

The wizard replied lightly and snapped his fingers.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The sunken part rose up. Earth and water were created, restoring the ruined planet.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

"Uh..."

People couldn't close their mouths.

It was like a scene from the creation of the universe. In an instant, the sunken land had returned to its original form.

"Wow..."

"Okay."

Kim Hwi-yeon composed himself and gathered the people.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

First, it was necessary to calculate the number of survivors. Kim Hwi-yeon took people to check the damage.

The damage was less than expected. The strong monsters, including Lee Tae-yeon, had resolved the issue, and the ones they couldn't handle were all left to Tae-san.

Since Tae-san had handled the last monster alone, there was no reason for their damage to be significant. The people's trust in Tae-san had become unshakeable.

And Tae-san was confirming what he had obtained himself.

[Transcendence: Black] [Proficiency: 83%] [Consumption??? :???] [A distorted law that existed before the creation of the world, capable of contaminating and eroding the current laws and concepts to do $%^%^@#!.]

The keeper of the seal had handled a large amount of blackness. The amount of blackness contained in a single orb was more than the total amount Tae-san possessed.

He had obtained a large amount of blackness. The blackness that had filled the floor had exceeded the amount he possessed, and he had obtained an enormous amount.

Tae-san raised his hand.

Whoosh.

The blackness flowed out.

The flowing blackness didn't stop. It filled the surroundings, covered the sky, and still had some left over.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There are a lot."

The amount of black energy has increased overwhelmingly while defeating the gatekeeper.

It's about five times more than before.

The lack of black energy was always a concern. It was because it was far from sufficient compared to the divine. But now, that concern has been somewhat resolved.

"I think I can use the chaos domain properly now."

The excessive consumption of black energy had prevented me from using my abilities properly, but now I think I can handle them to some extent. As my proficiency has increased, all the skills based on black energy have also been enhanced. My self-immolation and time interference abilities have also been strengthened.

Just this alone made it worth defeating the gatekeeper.

But it didn't end there.

[Special Passive Skill: Victor Beyond] [Proficiency: 1%] [You have won against a great being existing beyond. When you face a great being, all your abilities are enhanced to a high level.]

A skill similar to what I've obtained so far. The difference is that it's described as a high level in the explanation itself.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In the system of the labyrinth, being strong meant being truly strong. It meant being reinforced to a considerable level.

And the most important thing.

[Transcendence: Compression] [Proficiency: ~!~] [Compression of something that doesn't belong to this world. #$%$^&*(*)]

Compression.

The gatekeeper had handled the black color and compressed it into a black color. Taesan decided to try it out right away. He started compressing the black color that covered the sky.

Kuku-gu-gu-guk.

The compression was completed in an instant. A single black orb appeared on Taesan's hand.

"Is this it?"

Originally, compressing one's power required a certain amount of burden.

There was no sensation. It was as if he was doing something he could do naturally.

Not bad. Compressing power was similar to focusing. It had more meaning when facing strong enemies.

But it was ambiguous.

The specialized authority granted to the high gods. Even if it increased, the total amount of black color was limited for Taesan, so it wasn't that attractive.

Taesan read the explanation of compression.

Compression of something that doesn't belong to this world.

Then.

Taesan retrieved the black color again and summoned it. This time, it was the uncompressed black color."

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Kiing."

He called upon the divine.

The boundaries of black and divine intertwined, creating a boundary line. In an instant, a boundary line as large as a house appeared in the world.

And Taesan compressed the boundary line.

"Kkikik!"

The boundary line, compressed and compressed, wrapped around Taesan's sword like a thin membrane.

Taesan lightly swung his sword. With just that, the space began to distort.

"Good."

Taesan was satisfied.

The boundary line was undoubtedly powerful.

A power that didn't belong anywhere was superior to all attributes, could remove impurities, and purify. It could even shake concepts.

But the problem was that the boundary line was a power that he couldn't perfectly control.

He could wield it and mix it with magic or the world's sword, but compressing, separating, and adjusting it was impossible.

Therefore, like a magician, he couldn't quickly fill the exhausted area with the boundary line, or like a gatekeeper, compress and concentrate it to break through.

But now, Taesan could also compress the boundary line to concentrate his power.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If it were the current Taesan, it would be possible to break through the boundary line and advance by crushing the orb. If so, compression would also be a very useful authority.

“Oooo…….”

While Taesan was confirming his authority, people returned to Greenland.

They bowed their heads, trembling with fear.

In front of them, the space-time axis was distorted. Taesan had left an indelible scar in the universe by wielding his sword along the trajectory.

The people bowed their heads in reverence at the great miracle.

Taesan was watching the scene with a calm gaze.

"That scar will not be erased."

Suddenly, the wizard who had come to Taesan's side muttered.

"As long as the transcendent being doesn't use his authority directly, it will remain until the universe is destroyed. That's not just a simple physical force, but closer to a concept."

The wizard laughed awkwardly even after saying it himself.

"It's ridiculous to think that physical force alone can reach the realm of authority."

The wizard had unfolded a barrier to protect the earth. It wasn't full power, but he didn't do it lightly either. It was a serious barrier.

However, that barrier was about to be broken through by physical force."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If I hadn't held back my true power, I would have really broken through. Even though it wasn't a direct hit, the aftermath was still that severe.

It's simple physics, but it's reached the realm of power that transcends even the strongest magic. This was something the magician had never seen before.

"And there's no special penalty either."

There was only one penalty: the cooldown time of the skill.

But even that wasn't long. The cooldown time for transformation was one week. It meant that I could unleash a devastating blow that would leave an indelible scar on the world every week.

The attack that only dealt with addition and multiplication was also not weak at all.

Moreover, Taesan's attack power didn't end here.

As I went down into the labyrinth and obtained more equipment, my power would only continue to grow.

"I'll have to give Balbam a good scolding."

It was a kind of balance breaker. If I took just one more step, I would have the power to distort the concept of the world. Even the magician himself didn't expect it to be possible.

"If it's like this, I'm curious about your true identity again. Are you changing or something?"

The magician muttered jokingly, but then spoke seriously.

"Thank you."

Taesan looked at the magician.

"If you hadn't taken care of the gatekeeper, we would have been in big trouble too."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If Taesan had lost, the gatekeeper would have perfectly opened the crack. Even the wizard couldn't intervene. Because he had come down with the right qualifications, and the earth was a gray area anyway.

Then, they also became quite troubled. There were those who had hoped for Taesan's victory even from far away in the universe.

"It's not particularly satisfying, though."

Taesan looked up at the sky.

The crack was still there.

Even though he had won, the earth was still a gray area.

"There's no way. Bright has died, and there's no way to close it now."

"What on earth happened?"

The transcendent being who had existed during the war with the ancient gods had been killed.

And it wasn't the ancient gods who had killed Bright.

"There's a lot to talk about. A lot."

The wizard smiled wryly.

"Let's talk about it in more detail after we return to the labyrinth."

Taesan nodded.

After that, Taesan spent the remaining time giving people power.

He made a contract with Gang Joon-hyuk and Sado, and taught them how to handle spirits and magic. And Taesan continued to practice how to efficiently use the power of compression he had obtained.

And finally, the time came.

They returned to the labyrinth once again."
