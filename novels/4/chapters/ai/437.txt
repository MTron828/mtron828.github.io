**Chapter 438**

438. The 85th Floor, the Ash-Colored Woman, Sosiet Gardenia (6)

[You!]

Dersha resists.

But it's meaningless. The final desperate struggle, the explosion of death, is also blocked by Taesan's boundary.

Taesan's spiritual power upgrade is activated. He takes some of the power that Sosiet's body had.

[Your spiritual power upgrade is activated. Your physical strength will permanently...][Your spiritual power upgrade is activated. You have acquired the special skill [Necromancy].]

And it doesn't stop there.

Taesan starts to take even the power that Sosiet didn't have, which was obtained through someone else's intervention.

[How dare you! You're trying to steal my authority!]

Dersha starts to rampage. Using Sosiet's collapsing body, she tries to push back the spiritual power upgrade.

But it's useless.

The spiritual power upgrade ignores Dersha's resistance and steals the power she gave.

[You...!]

With a furious voice, Dersha is completely expelled.

Quadduk.

Taesan draws his sword. The authority that Dersha gave starts to settle into Taesan.

[Your spiritual power has been activated. You have acquired the special skill [Cradle of Death].]

Sosiet's body had completely collapsed. There was nothing left.

Taesan, who had briefly looked down at the ground, swung his sword.

While Taesan was finishing off Sosiet, Bardray had somehow targeted Taesan's back.

Clang!

The swords clashed. Bardray's incredible swordsmanship sent Taesan's sword flying.

But Sosiet no longer existed.

Taesan's magic and dark magic were unfolding without any hindrance.

[You have activated the Black Space of Baal.]

The dark space, summoned in the labyrinth, rushed towards Bardray.

Bardray, blocked by the space, was pushed back.

"……It seems I was too confident. It doesn't seem to be of much help after all. I guess you can't trust gods."

Bardray scowled. Taesan pointed his sword at him.

"Do you plan to continue?"

Most of the cards he had were already seen through by Taesan, and even Sosiet had been eliminated. Bardray's victory was almost impossible.

But he raised his sword with an unwavering face.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I can't beat you, so what's the point of saying it? If I can't overcome the impossible, I don't deserve to be called a hero! I've prepared for everything, and I've achieved the impossible, and I've reached this place!"

The atmosphere is electrifying.

Bardley shouted.

"Making the impossible possible is my job! Come on! Adventurer! I'll kill you and claim victory!"

The hero kept his word. Despite the uncertainty of victory, he didn't stop moving forward to win.

Taesan also charged at Bardley with all his might.

[You activated the Great Collapse.]

Kugugugung!

A magical sphere that destroys everything appears in the labyrinth. Bardley quickly dodges it. Taesan chases after it and strikes with his sword.

Kagakag!

The swords clash, and Bardley's wrist moves.

The extreme technique that has reached its limit gently knocks down Taesan's hand holding the sword.

Bardley thrusts his sword at Taesan's empty chest. Taesan doesn't block it.

[Your first attack absolute nullification has been activated.]

Bardley's attack is erased.

His pupils enlarge. Taesan thrusts his sword again.

[You activated the Soul Blade.] [You activated the Plus.]

Kwajik.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Dealt 88977 damage to Bardray.] [Bardray's life-threatening crisis has been triggered.] [Bardray's final battle has begun.]"

"Kuh-huh!"

It was just one hit. Although several automatic skills were triggered, they were meaningless.

The one hit that succeeded after dozens of attempts became meaningless, and Bardray himself ended the battle with a single mistake.

Bardray spat out blood and shouted.

"It's your victory! Adventurer!"

The ghost watched its second death without closing its eyes.

* * *

[Your level has increased.] [Your spiritual power has increased, permanently increasing your health...] [Your spiritual power has increased, increasing the proficiency of Ability Sword by 2%, Strong Strike by 1%, and Acceleration by 2%...] [Your spiritual power has increased, acquiring the soul skill [Divine Sword Unity].]

The ghost is a swordmaster.

The proficiency of skills related to him has increased overall.

At the same time, the ghost's physical body disappears.

[85th floor cleared.] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [Obtained the broken sword of horror.] [Obtained???.]

The death of Sosiet.

The ghost's quest has ended.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Congratulations on your victory.]

The Exirea, who had retreated to the other side, reappeared.

[You've passed my trial magnificently, adventurer.]

"Did you get what you wanted?"

[Enough.]

Exirea's voice was filled with satisfaction.

[I am the god of desire, and I know better than anyone the weight of desire that the ghosts possess. Among the mortals I've seen so far, I can count on my fingers the weight of their desires.]

Desire is affection and longing.

Exirea is in charge of the concept of desire itself. If Exirea says so, it's an undeniable truth.

[But while traveling with you, he put aside his own desires for your sake. That alone shows what kind of existence you are. And it was worth it just to see that annoying Dersha get flustered. That alone was enough value.]

"Are you not on good terms with Lady Dersha?"

[She's one of the oldest gods, existing since the birth of the world. That's why she's always nagging about this and that.]

Exirea smiled wryly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[I didn't like that appearance, so I wanted to tease him a bit, but it turned out like this.]"

Exirea said with a smile.

"[You've shown me many things. From now on, it's my turn. Exirea will help you.]"

"Thank you."

"[Gratitude is for him to give. After all, it was the ghost next to you who decided everything.]"

A thin, long laughter was heard.

"[It's not an easy task to give up one's desires for someone else. I was satisfied too. So, I'll give him a personal reward.] [Exirea's interference domain has decreased.]"

The power of the gods enveloped the ghost.

"[Exirea?] [You've achieved the goal of the quest. You've fulfilled your own wish. The contract with the wizard is over.]"

Exirea said calmly. As he said, Taesan no longer felt the contract with the ghost. The sensation that had continued from the 2nd floor had completely disappeared.

"[Unlike others, you exist only as a soul. When the contract ends, you can no longer stay in the labyrinth. Your soul will go to where it originally belonged. But that's too cruel.]"

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The faint presence of the ghost, which had been gradually disappearing, returned to its original state.

["My power is supporting your soul. I can stay by your side for a while longer." [……Thank you.] "But I can't stay for long. I'll finish the mental cleanup quickly."]

With that, Exirea disappeared.

["I can stay by your side for a while longer. But…… it's over now."]

The quest has ended.

The contract has been terminated.

The ghost's journey, this place was the last stop.

* * *

Taesan was about to say something to the ghost, but someone else appeared before him.

Kugugugung!

The bricks of the labyrinth's wall rose up.

The administrator, Balbambara, emerged.

["This level of interference is necessary, but I'll allow it. Since it ended without any issues, there's no problem."]

"What's going on this time?"

["This is the end of the contract. The contract with the being that died together with the ghost is special. If it's the last one, I'll have to take care of it myself."]

Balbambara gazed at the ghost. Although it was maintaining its form thanks to Exirea's power, the ghost was no longer affiliated with the labyrinth.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You, who are like those who have been deceived by the god of downfall, cannot be forgiven in this labyrinth. You should finish the reward processing and be chased out, but... you have proceeded with the quest as a contractor of the labyrinth. I won't interfere for now.]

[Yes.]

[Hmm.]

After a moment of contemplation, Barbalbaba asked the ghost.

[What are you going to do now?] [There's nothing to do. It's already over.] [If you want, you can make a new contract with the labyrinth.]

The ghost hesitated.

[...Is that possible?] [Originally, it would be impossible. But this time is an exception. If you make a new contract, I'll let you stay in the labyrinth.] [Then...] [You can make a wish to the adventurer. Of course, it's a wish that's close to impossible, so you'll have to stay for a very long time. You might not even achieve it until the end of the universe.]

Saving the world from destruction.

Conquering the labyrinth to fulfill your wish, or turning back time.

Both were tasks that were close to impossible.

[I won't force you either. The choice is yours. You have perfect freedom now. You can go back to where you belong, and that's fine too. I'll give you some time, so do as you please.]

Having said that, Barbalbaba was about to leave.

"Just a moment."

But Taesan caught him.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Before I ask, I want to confirm something. Was the labyrinth copied by the gods?"

[Is this referring to the labyrinth created by the gods?]

"Not there, but here."

[……I think I understand what you're saying.]

Many solo mode players, including Lee Tae-yeon, couldn't meet each other. It was because the solo mode was also copied as many times as their numbers.

Those who obtained the title of Transcender were not affected by the gods, but the NPCs in ordinary labyrinths were different.

"For example, in the case of Belzencia and the Ghost, did they not fulfill their wishes in other labyrinths?"

That would be a very unreasonable story. They worked hard to fulfill their wishes, but their counterparts in other places had nothing.

[The wizards are also worried about this issue. You don't need to worry. I've already found the answer.]

Balbambara replied bluntly.

[The question ends here. Then, hero. Wait for your choice.]

Balbambara, who had disappeared, said as if he had remembered something.

[And the 86th floor. I've thought a lot about what to do there. An ordinary labyrinth won't do, but there's nothing suitable, so I did it simply.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Simply?"

[The floor was pulled up.]

It was pulled up.

It meant that the floor below was being pulled up.

[Even at that level, you might be dissatisfied, but it's worth attacking.]

The Balbambara had completely disappeared.

The ghost was silent.

* * *

[Anyway... it's over with this.]

The ghost and Taesan were bound by a quest relationship. That quest had ended.

Then, it was time to give rewards for it.

[You did well. Very well. So, I should give you a suitable reward.]

Power flowed from the ghost to Taesan. It was an unconditional transfer of power, as if giving everything.

[Receive. Everything is mine.] [Cavert's Relic: Sword with Ancestor's Blood] changed to [Cavert's Relic: Last Master]. [You obtained the title "Storm Scar Swordsmanship Successor"]. [You obtained the ring that announces the succession of the fallen empire.] [You obtained Bardley's memento.]
