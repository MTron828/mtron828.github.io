**Chapter 312**

**312. The Fifth Return, Earth (8)**

"Are they two-digit monsters?"

Taesan gazed calmly at the giant.

People were aghast.

Although Korean players had seen them before, for Japanese and Chinese players, it was their first time seeing two-digit monsters. And the power emanating from the monsters was beyond what they could handle.

Just looking at them made their minds feel like they were about to collapse, and their bodies trembled. They could sense that even if they all charged at them, they wouldn't be able to win.

And that wasn't the end of it.

In the open passage, countless three-digit monsters appeared, too many to count.

Each three-digit monster was a hard-mode monster that couldn't be defeated even if dozens of people charged at it.

Hundreds, thousands of such monsters surrounded them.

But they didn't despair.

With resolute faces, they grasped their weapons. An existence with absolute power. An existence that protected them and repelled the monsters.

Taesan's existence prevented them from falling into the fear of death.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They can win.

People sent a gaze of faith to Taesan.

"Minerva. Barcaza. Do you know?"

"I know. I'll help others and come back."

[Don't die. Master.]

"I won't die from that kind of enemy."

Minerva and Barcaza disappeared from view. The people cheered.

And Jinryong was looking at them with a very unpleasant face.

"Despicable things."

But at the same time, it's an opportunity. If the despicable things can defeat the monster that's scaring them, he can receive their worship again.

Jinryong, who had calculated this, moved quickly. He charged towards the monster.

Tat.

The A-grade monster that was at the front rushed towards Jinryong. Jinryong revealed his strength and pulled out his power.

Kwaaaang!

The power exploded.

The A-grade monster and Jinryong clashed with all their might.

This was not the fake A-grade that had appeared until now. This was the real A-grade that had killed many hard-mode players on the dying earth.

Kagagak!

Jinryong was not pushed back by the monster.

On the contrary, he was overwhelming it.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Haha!"

Jinryong forgot about his surroundings and focused on the battle.

The power within him burst out, devouring the monster. The monster resisted and tried to counterattack, but it was slowly being pushed back.

"Die!"

Jinryong clenched his fist.

The explosive power crushed the A-grade monster.

"Phew."

Jinryong wiped away his sweat and smiled victoriously. He had won against the three-digit monster without much difficulty.

"Look!"

He roughly spread his arms, like a ruler.

"I am your master!"

He smiled slyly, turning his body to see people's reactions.

And then he froze.

He was fighting an A-grade monster with all his might, so he had no idea what was happening around him.

Dozens of fallen A-grade monsters came into his view.

He quickly turned his gaze. Taesan had already passed him and was running ahead.

Ku-u-ung!

Dozens of A-grade monsters rushed to kill Taesan.

Taesan grasped swords in both hands and took a stance.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Gang Tae-san activated his Whirlwind Slash.]

Kwajik.

His sword moved. The stormy sword wind summoned a hurricane, tearing everything around him to shreds.

Dozens of A-rank warriors blocking his way were cut down at once.

"Oooo!"

"Yes, indeed!"

Even people who were fighting nearby couldn't help but exclaim in surprise at the sight.

The figure of Jinryong, who had taken down an A-rank warrior, was beyond their comprehension.

"This, this..."

Jinryong's emotions were boiling over, and he stuttered. Meanwhile, Tae-san arrived right in front of the giant.

[——!]

The giant roared and raised his arm. A massive club imbued with earth-shattering power came crashing down.

Tae-san drew his sword.

Zzzzip!

"Kkkkkk!"

The stormy wind sent people flying. Monsters were no exception. In the simple clash of powers, every being in the vicinity was sent tumbling to the ground.

Jinryong was no exception.

"Ahh..."

Jinryong, covered in dirt and dust, gazed blankly at the two fighters.

* * *

"Hmph."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With a shout, Lee Tae-yeon swings her sword. The curved trajectory of her sword skillfully deflects the monster's attack.

Ka-ga-gak!

And then, Kang Joon-hyuk takes advantage of the monster's opening. The monster wildly swings its body, responding to their attacks.

Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk stand firm, their faces set.

Ka-ga-gak!

The sword and the monster's body clash.

After a few minutes, the A-grade monster falls to their combined attack.

"This is ridiculous."

Lee Tae-yeon catches her breath. She and Kang Joon-hyuk possessed a power that no one, except for Jin-ryong and Tae-san, could match. They were confident they could defeat even ten hard-mode players without a problem.

But this three-digit-level monster was not easy to defeat, even with their combined strength.

"This is bad."

"Yeah."

Lee Tae-yeon mutters to herself, glancing around her surroundings.

"Aaah!"

"Kill!"

People and monsters clash.

And the only ones who fall are the players.

In easy mode, hundreds of players charge at a single A-grade monster. When the monster wildly swings its body, they all get knocked out and can't get back up again.

Kwaaaang!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A massive, A-grade monster charges onto the battlefield. Even hard-mode players who try to stop it are blown away like dominoes.

The situation was the worst.

Even in easy mode, the battle itself couldn't be established, and even if they worked together in hard mode, they would have to kill at least a few hundred monsters before they could barely take down one.

The exchange itself didn't happen.

Minerva and Barca were taking down monsters, but the number was still unbearable.

"Phew."

She takes a deep breath.

Her whole body trembles. She wants to run away and hide right now.

But she grips her sword tightly and moves forward.

Kaang!

The monster and sword clash. She quickly moves her body to respond to the monster's attack, with Kang Jun-hyuk supporting her from behind.

Kagagak!

"Kill it!"

"Crush it!"

People shout.

Even though countless people are dying, their morale doesn't drop.

Instead, it only grows.

Kuuuuuuuuung…….

The earth shakes as if there's an earthquake. The sky opens up with the collision of powers.

"Is that the power of the deep layer... it's enormous."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We can also reach it. It'll take a while, but it's possible."

"That's right. But I still can't sense it."

I Tae-yeon shook his head and grasped his sword.

The battlefield between Taesan and the giant was far away, but even here, the waves of power could be felt.

Every time those waves resonated, people's morale grew even higher.

Taesan was fighting against the giant, who seemed unbeatable, even if all humanity came together.

They could win.

They shouted Taesan's name and charged forward.

Even those who didn't worship Taesan were swept away by the overheated atmosphere and extreme situation, and they began to chant his name.

Millions of believers began to emerge.

* * *

Taesan continued to clash swords with the giant.

Whoa!

The waves of power spread across the land, and Taesan created distance with the giant, feeling the power coursing through his sword.

S-grade monsters range from 1 to 99. The monster in front of him was clearly an S-grade.

However, even among S-grades, the difference in power between numbers was significant.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

From 1 to 9, and from 10 to 99, there was an unbridgeable gap between S-grade monsters.

In other words, if it was an S-grade monster with two digits, Taesan could easily win without much difficulty.

Gosin also knew that.

So, why did they send out such a monster?

Taesan glanced back.

On the battlefield, numerous players were being killed by the monster.

And the giant was quietly staring at Taesan.

Instead of attacking first, it was only responding to Taesan's attacks.

"It's the same as before."

Taesan was being held back, and in the meantime, they were dealing with other weak players.

It was a simple but extremely effective method.

So, Taesan's course of action was already decided.

Faster than anyone, without holding back, he would take down the giant.

Taesan accelerated and charged at the giant. The giant swung its club.

Wham!

Although it only grazed the ground, the earth collapsed. But S-grade is S-grade, and Taesan also had the power to withstand a head-on attack.

However, his speed was overwhelmingly superior. And the giant was only wielding its club without any special abilities.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The strategy is simple.

Taesan stamps his foot. The giant swings his club down towards Taesan, who stamps his foot again.

The ground that was hit by the club collapses.

It breaks apart like a puzzle, revealing its inner workings. The shockwave spreads far and wide, even reaching those who are fighting in the distance.

"Uaaaah!"

Lee Taeyeon, who was blocking the monster, stumbles backward. She barely manages to shake off the monster and sends a disbelieving gaze.

"What the...?"

The flat plain splits open, creating a cliff.

It was a battle that changed the map literally.

Taesan runs on the collapsing ground. For him, who has a balancing skill, the unstable footing is no problem at all.

The giant sees Taesan running and wildly swings his club. A massive storm forms, with strong winds swirling around.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

Taesan fiercely swings his sword towards the storm.

[You have activated Storm Sprint.]

The wind generated by the swinging sword surrounds Taesan.

He pierces through the storm just like that.

The winds collide and scatter."

Note: "광풍질주" is a term that seems to be a game mechanic or skill, and I translated it to "Storm Sprint". If you have more context or information about what this term means, I may be able to provide a more accurate translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The giant's power is not supernatural, but physical strength.

In other words, without a foothold, it's hard to launch a proper attack.

[You activated an earthquake.]

Rumble!

The already crumbling ground begins to accelerate its collapse. The mountain opens its mouth.

"Crush!"

The declaration filled with determination pierces the ground, and the ground follows its intent.

The ground gives way. Their bodies start to fall.

The falling giant moves its arm, but the power that flails about without a foothold is not that strong. The mountain spreads its wings.

[You activated the perfect fairy's wings.] [You activated landing.] [You activated skill acceleration.]

Whoosh!

The body accelerates and strikes the giant's club.

The club wobbles greatly, and the giant's body starts to fall even faster.

The mountain attaches itself to the giant and flails its arm.

[You activated partial world alteration.]

Crunch.

The roots of the arm guard expand roughly.

Everything around is shattered. The remnants of the ground turn to sand and disappear, and the giant's club is roughly shaved off.

Boom!"

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The giant's body opens up. Taesan grips his sword.

[You activated Rapid Targeting.] [You activated Acceleration.] [You activated Transformation.] [You activated Addition.] [You activated the Sword of Devotion.] [Dealt 105480 damage to Monster 14.]

With a cry of agony, the giant's body is pushed back even further.

Kwaaaang!

How far did it fall? With a loud crash, the giant crashes to the ground.

The giant gets back up and wildly swings its club.

Taesan's hand, which lightly dodged the attack, holds a black key.

[You activated Amon's Black Key.]

Kwaaaang!

The giant crashes to the ground again.

Taesan grips his sword, taking advantage of the giant's momentary weakness from the shock.

Kwachik.

[Dealt 26840 damage to Monster 14.] [—-!]

The giant, pierced to the heart, lets out a loud roar.

Its entire body's muscles bulge, and the giant regains its energy. Then, it starts attacking wildly.

But Taesan was no longer there.

"Is this the Rampage Pattern?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The giant's rampage. When its health falls below a certain percentage, its strength and speed suddenly increase.

In other words, it meant that the giant's health had decreased significantly. It seemed to have taken considerable damage during its fall from the sky.

[You activated Sabnak's Black Thread.] [You activated Random Blink.]

Kwaaaang!

The black thread explodes and ravages the giant's entire body. The Taesan, which had moved to the sky with Random Blink, lands and accelerates its skill to trample the giant.

[You activated Vital Point Designation.]

You pierce the giant's chest with your sword. The giant roars and swings its arm at Taesan, but it's useless.

[Your first attack's absolute nullification was activated.]

The giant is a monster that only uses its physical strength to attack. In other words, it's an opponent that can be perfectly countered with attack nullification.

During the three times the attack nullification is activated, you deal dozens of sword strikes to the designated vital point, continuously dealing massive damage.

The frost approaches. The roots that penetrate the world arise, blocking the giant's movements, and the flames that burn the world set the giant ablaze."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Mana and magic began to appear on the ground in an instant.

But there was no problem. Taesan pulled out his divine power.

Mana and magic rose again.

Taesan continued to manifest his magic.

When mana and magic appeared on the ground again, the giant collapsed.

[You have defeated Giant 14.] [Your spiritual power has increased. The proficiency of your twisted spiritual tuning has increased by 4%.]

"As expected, I have a lot of stamina."

Mana and magic had all been depleted. Defeating it wasn't difficult, but its stamina was incomparable to that of a labyrinth's existence.

However, aside from its high stamina, the giant-type didn't have any special abilities, so I was able to win faster than expected.

Thanks to the spiritual power increase, the proficiency of my twisted spiritual tuning has now exceeded 60%.

Taesan looked at the giant's corpse.

The giant was certainly strong. In the sense that it bound Taesan, the giant had played a sufficient role.

But somehow, it was lacking.

The gods were showing Taesan their greed.

They were targeting Taesan as an individual.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They, those greedy and powerful beings, didn't think they would retreat from killing people and stop at the boundary of the mountain.

The mountain, which had collapsed underground, emerged and headed towards the battlefield.

There, people were still risking their lives to fight against the A-grade monsters.

With a mighty roar, the mountain crushed the monster's head. Those who saw the mountain's appearance were overjoyed.

"Mountain Lord!"

"You've won!"

Instead of responding, the mountain moved its body.

As the mountain joined the battle, the monsters died instantly. The people, seeing this, shouted the mountain's name and fought against the monsters with renewed vigor.

After some time had passed...

[Special Quest Clear.]

The quest completion window appeared.

They had won.

The people cheered and rejoiced.

"We did it!"

"Hurray!"

They gazed at the mountain with joyful eyes.

"Mountain Lord, thank you!"

"You are truly great!"

Everyone praised the mountain. Even Chinese players were shouting the mountain's name at the top of their lungs.

The power of the two-digit monsters was something that everyone on this battlefield could feel.

They had felt instant death, but the mountain had emerged victorious against such monsters and returned."

Note: "Mountain Lord" is a literal translation of "태산 님", but it may not be the most natural or idiomatic translation in English. Depending on the context, it could be translated as "Mountain King" or "Lord of the Mountain" to better convey the sense of respect and awe.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It also didn't leave any scars.

There was no one who doubted the power of Taesan anymore. If he hadn't been there, they would have all died. Everyone began to call out his name and worship him.

[The proficiency of Divine Power increased by 1%.] [The proficiency of Divine Power increased by 1%.] [The proficiency of Divine Power increased by 1%.]

Divine Power is rapidly increasing.

Taesan looked at the people.

Everyone's gaze was focused on Taesan alone.

And the face of Jinryong, who was watching that scene, was distorted with extreme anger."
