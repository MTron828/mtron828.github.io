**Chapter 519**

**519. The Eighth Return, Earth (4)**

"It's quite strong."

Taesan had become incomparably stronger than before.

As a result, he could vaguely sense the existence of the Gatekeeper.

The energy emanating from the Gatekeeper was extremely heavy and enormous.

Even if it was on the other side of the rift, it was at least a high-ranking divine being. It wasn't an opponent to be underestimated.

"Can I win against that?"

He couldn't be confident. The probability of defeat was higher. It was a formidable opponent.

[Isn't the goal to not fight anyway?]

"That's right."

The Guardians had brought a disk. If they used it, they could permanently seal the heavenly rift.

If that was possible, there was no need to fight the Gatekeeper. They could just seal it from the outside.

"Still, it's better to prepare for contingencies."

[By the way, those Guardians are a bit annoying. Can't they just clean up their act? They're acting like they own the place.]

"It doesn't matter."

Taesan said indifferently.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Anyway, those guys are just messengers, so it's not like they can do anything. They'll figure it out on their own."

* * *

"Huh?"

The guardian was sprawled out on the floor, twitching.

It was unclear what had happened. He thought the woman's arm had been raised, but then she suddenly collapsed.

"Ugh... Ah..."

The man barely managed to get up. For a moment, his legs gave out and he almost fell, but he grabbed onto the wall and stood up.

"Oh, thank goodness."

Lee Tae-yeon let out a sigh of relief.

"You didn't die. I was worried about my strength control."

"You, you..."

The man slowly turned his head, trying to grasp the situation.

As a result, he came up with an answer using his mediocre brain.

Lee Tae-yeon had done something to him.

Anger appeared on the man's face.

"...You! What did you do to me!"

"I told you, I didn't want to."

"What! What!"

The man's voice grew louder. The people around them, who had heard the commotion, started to gather.

"What's going on?"

"What's happening?"

Among them were also the guardians.

"What's going on?"

"...This guy!"

The man gritted his teeth and shouted.

"This guy! They attacked me!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What?"

The faces of the guardians stiffen. A subtle, growing hostility begins to direct itself towards Lee Tae-yeon.

"Ah."

And Lee Tae-yeon's expression remains unchanged, without any particular emotion.

"It's annoying."

There is no sense of crisis or fear. It's just a pure, single feeling of annoyance. It's as if he's looking at a puddle of water on the road he's about to walk on.

"What's going on?"

Akrasian appears. The man who was beaten by Lee Tae-yeon runs up to him and says something.

Akrasian's face contorts in distaste as he listens to the man's story.

"......That's right."

Akrasian looks at Lee Tae-yeon with an unpleasant expression.

"This is a world directly managed by a great being, so I was going to let it slide, but I guess not. I'll have to take a firm grip on order, like usual."

"They started it first. Is this my fault?"

"Of course. We are the guardians who have come down to this place to save you."

Akrasian says, as if asking what the problem is.

"For us, it's only natural that you do what you can do. To refuse that is truly shameless."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ah."

Lee Tae-yeon sighed.

"It's still the same. Really."

Akrasian gestured, and the guardians surrounded Lee Tae-yeon.

"Well, it's done well."

Strict rules and perfect control require an example. Akrasian thought of making Lee Tae-yeon an example this time.

"You're quite strong."

Akrasian muttered, looking at Lee Tae-yeon.

"But even if you're strong, you're not at a level that can reach us. Let's show you what happens when you dare to defy the guardians."

"Ugh...".

Lee Tae-yeon's face still showed no fear, only annoyance.

"Then can I do it instead?"

A bright voice rang out.

Amelia slowly walked over and stood beside Lee Tae-yeon.

"Amelia?"

"You look annoyed. Then can I do it instead?"

"It's okay with me."

Lee Tae-yeon readily agreed. Amelia smiled deeply.

At first, Akrasian, who was about to say "don't interfere," looked at Amelia's face and twisted his own face.

"That woman."
$@$v=v1.13-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I told them I wasn't that strong at first. It was a woman."

"Good job. I'll punish you first."

"What about you guys?"

Amelia sneered. Akrasian twisted his lips.

"You know I'm strong. I'm probably as strong as you."

Akrasian drew his sword.

"But I've saved countless worlds and defeated countless monsters. You're no match for me."

"Cut the nonsense. Bring it on."

Amelia clicked her fingers, looking annoyed. Akrasian bared his teeth and charged.

Fast. An ordinary person wouldn't be able to keep up with this speed. Akrasian swung his sword. Until it was about to hit, Amelia didn't react.

Akrasian was certain of his victory.

At that moment.

Thud.

Akrasian's body crashed to the ground.

"......Huh?"

"This is ridiculous."

Amelia dusted off her hand.

"I had a hunch. I thought I might have some special power. Even if I couldn't understand it, it wouldn't be strange. I had a tiny bit of expectation. But this is just..."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His face, looking down at Akrasian, was filled with disappointment.

"Was I just weak?"

* * *

"Uh, ah."

Akrasian stumbled and got up. His eyes were shaking.

He couldn't even understand what had happened.

When he came to his senses, he was lying on the ground.

He hadn't even seen Amelia's movement. Akrasian's face, which had briefly looked away, was filled with anger.

"......Magic!"

He must have used some kind of dirty trick. Akrasian believed so and charged at Amelia again.

Amelia stretched out her hand.

Thud.

The swinging sword was caught.

"This, this."

It was as if a three-year-old child had swung a tree branch, and Akrasian was easily overpowered. Amelia shook her fist. Akrasian fell to the ground with a strong pain.

"You, you, you!"

Akrasian suppressed his pain. He couldn't accept the current situation.

"I am! The leader of the guardians who have protected numerous worlds, Akrasian!"

"So what?"

Amelia replied indifferently.

"It seems like all the worlds you've protected so far have become weak."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ugh...!"

Akrasian shouted roughly.

"Everyone! Kill this woman!"

"Yes, yes!"

The guardians rushed forward in unison. Amelia smiled brightly.

"That's right. It has to be like this."

Hundreds of guardians rushed forward. Amelia clenched her fists in excitement.

"Whoa!"

A one-on-one battle against hundreds of players unfolded before them.

And the one dominating the battle was Amelia.

"Crash!"

The armor shattered, and the staff broke. The black sword, hastily swung, couldn't even leave a scratch on Amelia's equipment, and the fired bullets were easily deflected with just a wave of her hand.

It was an overwhelming victory. Kim Hwi-yeon was stunned.

"This is...".

"I told you. You don't need to listen to their words."

Diana said calmly.

"They're not weak. They're capable of saving the world. But you're stronger. You're underestimating your own strength."

S-grade monster.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It can destroy the entire world alone. Even if all the beings on a planet gather and combine their powers, they cannot defeat this powerful monster.

And yet, Lee Tae-yeon was able to defeat such an existence alone.

"The universe is vast. There are planet gods, dragons, and immortals. There are also planets that don't have a powerful existence to protect them. With about 300 monsters, you can easily destroy such a planet."

"What? Only 300?"

Kim Hwi-yeon was taken aback. If it was only 300 monsters, it wasn't that strong. He had defeated countless monsters until now.

Diana smiled wryly.

"That's a normal world. You're just too strong."

It was a phrase that had been forgotten, but it was a very obvious truth.

Those who can clear the Elron mode are extremely rare. Even the strongest warriors gathered from the entire universe often can't clear beyond the 50th floor.

The Spirit King, the Great Wizard, and many other strong warriors are blocked at the 70th floor and can't proceed, and that's the labyrinth.

However, in this place, there are two people who have reached the deepest floor, excluding Taesan."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Of course, Lee Tae-yeon was also filtered out, and Amelia was also a monster.

To some extent, even at the Arkashian level, they couldn't fully grasp her strength.

Gang Jun-hyuk was also in a state where only one floor was left until the 70th floor.

In addition, many players, including the leader of India, were descending into the labyrinth without major issues.

Hard mode players were not weak either. They had surpassed the realm of superhumans. The fact that they could solo A-grade monsters at the clear stage already put them above the guardians.

"'I've looked around the entire universe, but it's hard to find a group as strong as you. It's not that you're weak, but rather that the enemies are too strong.'"

Multiple S-grade monsters, including the apostle, descended upon them. Moreover, the fragments of the divine punishment also appeared.

It wasn't an unusual environment for them to think they were weak.

"'You're strong enough. You can have confidence.'"

"'...I see.'"

Kim Hwi-yeon finally understood why Taesan said he didn't need to intervene.

It was because it wasn't worth it."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all, after all the mental anguish I'd been through.

Ku-u-u-ung!

The battle finally subsided, and hundreds of guardians lay defeated on the ground.

And Amelia didn't even break a sweat, her breathing steady and calm.

"It's over."

Amelia lightly brushed off her hand.

* * *

After that, it was a piece of cake.

The guardians couldn't say a word.

Of course, not everyone was like that. There were still those who couldn't come to their senses and were shouting nonsense.

"We're going to save the world...!"

"Shut up. Just shut up."

Amelia knocked them out with a blow to the back of their heads. The guardians watched, but couldn't say a word.

The hierarchy of power had already been established. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't even land a single hit.

They were clearly arrogant.

But they weren't stupid enough to not understand the gap in power.

Amelia muttered with a relieved expression.

"Ah, it's so refreshing. I should've done that earlier."

"Good job."

"What's with you guys being so weak? Are you really the ones who saved the world?"

"Yeah, that's right."

Lee Tae-yeon nodded in agreement. The guardians had indeed saved the world."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But those worlds were only good enough to have A-grade monsters appear, and the gods didn't even bother to pay attention to them.

The guardians believed they were an important group directly led by the transcenders, but from the transcenders' perspective, they were just janitors who took care of annoying tasks.

"Don't bother. It's already over."

That was it. It was a meaningless, valueless task.

After the small incident was over, people moved on. People began to completely ignore the guardians.

The guardians gritted their teeth at the fact, but they couldn't bring themselves to do anything about it.

They dealt with the monsters and moved forward. Minerva opened the path that led to the sea.

And they arrived just below the rift.

"Wow..."

"It's huge."

The rift they saw from below was enormous. It was so big that it would cover the entire Greenland and still have some left over. People felt a strange thrill.

And Taesan was waiting for them there.

"Are you here?"

"Yes."

Taesan glanced at Akrasian, who couldn't say a word and just bowed his head.

Taesan's interest in him ended there.

"Then, get ready."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Taesan said briefly. People organized their equipment and formed a line.

And before long, a quest appeared.

[Special Quest Start.] [Install four small orbs at the edge of the crack to seal the heavenly crack.] [Monsters will do their best to kill you and prevent the seal.] [Risk your life and win.] [Conditions: The orbs must be activated to seal the heavenly crack, and the orbs must not be destroyed under any circumstances.] [Reward: You will receive a reward based on your achievement when you return to the labyrinth.]"

Note: "태산" (Taesan) is a proper noun, likely a character's name, and "미궁" (migung) means "labyrinth".
