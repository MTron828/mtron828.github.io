**Episode 455**

**455. The 7th Return, Earth (7)**

After defeating the Four Gods, there were no significant difficulties.

Whenever there was a crisis, Taesan would directly intervene and take care of the monsters, so there were no more deaths after that.

It was a very strange phenomenon.

Taesan judged that Goshin could send down another Four God. There was a surplus of power to do so.

However, there were no unusual movements.

The number of S-grade monsters decreased noticeably, and there were no difficulties in defense.

Taesan could see through Goshin's plan.

"Are they conserving their power?"

There was an explanation that the destroyed pillars would bring disadvantages in the next quest.

Anyway, since the plan was already ruined when the Four Gods were defeated, it seemed like they would pour all their power into the next quest to capture Taesan.

However, people who didn't know this were extremely happy and thrilled to defeat monsters without much difficulty. They burned with passion and defeated the monsters.

Time passed without any issues, and the quest was completed.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Quest complete.] [One week later. The next quest will proceed. Until then, take care of your injuries and prepare for the upcoming battle.]"

"Woohoo!"

"We did it!"

"We won!"

The people who had blocked the monsters' attack cheered and shouted in joy. Taesan approached Diana and Belldandy, who were exhausted and lying down.

"You did well."

"Ugh, this is tough. My stamina isn't what it used to be."

Belldandy complained with a tired face. Diana's expression didn't change much, but her breathing was noticeably faster.

"This is tough. This is a world that's being invaded by the gods."

"Thanks to you, many people were able to survive. Thank you."

As Taesan faced the apostle, the S-rank continuously appeared.

If the two of them weren't there, Taeyeon would have had to block it alone, but even if she had become stronger, it would have been impossible. If Diana and Belldandy weren't there, the possibility of destruction couldn't be denied.

"No, this is something I wanted to do. Rather, I should be the one thanking you."

Diana smiled softly at the people.

They were rejoicing at having survived the destruction.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

To her, who couldn't save the people she had to save, their faces were a great comfort.

"Is it over now?"

"No. A new quest will begin in a week. But for now, please take a rest."

They were given a week's time. It was a tight schedule just to check the damage, but they had fought fiercely for a month. They also needed a break.

Diana and Belldandy followed the mountain's words. The two approached the rejoicing people.

"Woohoo!"

"The princess and the wizard have arrived!"

"Thank you so much! My son was able to survive thanks to the two of you!"

People welcomed the two with bright faces.

At first, there were suspicious glances towards Belldandy and Diana.

Many people doubted whether they were humans from Earth, wondering if they were spies from a monster or not.

However, as the quest progressed, such people completely disappeared. Everyone expressed their gratitude.

The two perfectly blended in with the people of Earth.

The two were flustered by the people's praise, but they wore joyful faces.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

People were delighted and joyful. They took a break and brought out food that had been cooked for a long time. Although the ingredients were lacking, and the dishes weren't that great, people were still satisfied.

The leaders of each country didn't stop them either. They knew that rewards were necessary.

During that time, Taesan was confirming the new power he had obtained.

[Black: Fragmentation] [Proficiency: 1%] [Can divide and control his own fragments.]

The skill categorized as "Black" was the first of its kind.

It was probably a unique ability that only they could use from the level of a saint. The effect was not hard to imagine.

[You have activated Fragmentation.]

At that moment, something burst out of Taesan's body.

[What the...?]

Bardley was taken aback for a moment.

A human-shaped energy, the same size as Taesan, appeared in front of him, trembling.

That was Taesan himself.

[…You have been divided, Master.]

Akasha was also shocked and muttered to himself. Taesan examined the divided energy.

Although he didn't feel any will, it was undoubtedly himself.

"A part of my power, Geuk, Shinsung... and even Black, I have it all."

[But it's incredibly small. I can easily erase it right now.]

Note: There are some Korean terms and names that may not have direct English translations, so I've kept them as is. Additionally, the text appears to be from a fantasy novel or game, so some terms may be specific to that world or setting.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Mount Tae san has ended fragmentation.

Just as the description of the skill said, it is now possible for him to handle his own burden dividedly.

However, what can be done with this is still not clear.

It will gradually occur to me what can be done with it.

[By the way… how about that thing?]

Bardrey grumbled with a fed-up face.

Tae san is now recognizing himself on the rooftop of a building in Las Vegas.

And around the building, numerous people were bowing their heads.

It was a number that filled the entire city.

Over ten million people were bowing their heads and worshipping towards Tae san.

Tae san has traveled all over the United States to prevent the saint.

Literally, he went back and forth from east to west and defeated the saint. In the process, people directly confirmed his power.

Moreover, it was Tae san who brought Bellancika and Diana, who saved them.

Almost everyone except for a tiny bit worshipped him.

Really, like a god.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

When Taesan tried to block the hole he had made during the process of catching the sword, people showed a difficult expression. When asked about the reason, they replied:

"This is a trace left by Taesan-nim to save us. We must preserve this place and let future generations know about it."

"......Is that so."

In the end, Taesan did not fill the hole.

The divine power had reached 99%. It felt like the limit of the divine power had disappeared. If it were now, it would be possible to cover the entire United States with divine power, with just a little more effort.

But 1% was still lacking.

Taesan knew the reason.

Most people worshipped him, but there were also a few who opposed him.

"I acknowledge his strength, but he's not a god."

Pure non-believers.

People who didn't believe in gods as humans.

"Can such a strong existence really exist? Are they colluding with the enemy?"

Doubters.

Those who doubted Taesan's identity and thought he had a close relationship with the enemy.

There were also those who had various minds and did not worship Taesan.

When their faith was also received, the proficiency would finally reach 100%.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not going to be easy."

In a world on the brink of destruction, where he had received the worship of all people, but the number of people who truly believed in him was small, and he was in a desperate situation. At that time, those who didn't believe in him had all fought against him and died, so it was possible.

Akasha, who had been quiet, spoke up.

"[Master, isn't the problem the people who don't believe in you right now?]"

"That's right."

"[Then the solution is simple. We just need to kill them all. As the master, you can handle it without anyone noticing.]"

Akasha spoke calmly.

Taesan gazed at Akasha, who was perched on his finger, with a puzzled expression.

"[That's too... extreme, isn't it?]"

"[But it's a rational approach. It's hard to change the minds of those who don't believe. Erasing them is more rational than persuading them.]"

"I don't use that method," Taesan replied firmly. If he was going to solve the problem by killing, there were more convenient ways to do so. But Taesan had rejected all of those options and had come to this place.

"[Is that so?]"

Akasha, who had fallen silent for a moment, asked quietly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Master, am I strange?]" "[Isn't that just normal?"]

Bardley spoke with a hint of sarcasm.

"[You'll kill me if I don't believe? That's the kind of thinking only fanatics would have.] [Well... I suppose so.]"

"Has your memory returned?"

As Bardley used his sword, his attack power increased significantly.

Akasha, who grew stronger every time he defeated an enemy, didn't seem to be affected by the change either.

"[That's not it... It's just that it comes naturally. Is it an emotion? Is it an action? It's something like that. I think I was quite cruel during my human days.] [Well, you're a saint who believes in God. It's possible that you're influenced by God's nature. You seem like a pretty ruthless god to me.] [Is this a sense of cruelty? It's a strange feeling.]"

Akasha muttered to himself.

"No, your words are the fastest, but I don't think I'll do that. I'm thinking of a different method."

Taesan said.

Time passed, and a day went by.

People began to check the damage with serious faces. The first thing they checked was the number of destroyed pillars.

"14 out of 108 pillars were destroyed."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I don't know if this is good or bad."

"It's not bad."

Taesan replied. He thought that more than 20 pillars would be destroyed. 14 pillars would be within the acceptable range.

And at the spot where the pillars were destroyed, something strange was visible.

"What is that?"

It was a black substance.

Something dark and mysterious had taken its place, filling the space. People instinctively felt fear and didn't dare to approach.

Taesan approached the substance.

He reached out his hand and touched it. The people watching held their breath.

But nothing happened.

"A barrier?"

He examined it closely, but couldn't figure out what it was specifically. He thought about using a boundary line, but he knew that Goshin was aware of it too.

If he touched it carelessly, it could end up benefiting Goshin, so Taesan decided to handle it at a safe distance.

"Let's leave it for now."

"Yes, but even though the quest is over, there are still pillars that haven't been destroyed?"

"Maybe they'll be used in the next quest or something?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Then, let's arrange the pillars at the center."

Kim Hwi-yeon replied calmly.

The number of dead people wasn't that high.

About 20 million, which was 10% of the entire population, had lost their lives. Although it was a significant loss, they had overcome tens of billions of lives and were quickly getting over their grief and moving forward.

Everything was settled at an incredible speed.

Everyone expected the next quest to be the last one.

And they knew it would be extremely difficult.

But they believed they could overcome it without a doubt.

Everyone steeled themselves and waited for the quest.

And a week passed.

The quest began.

[Special Quest Start.] [14 Destroyed Pillars.] [Condition Check in Progress...][Check Complete.]

Whoa!

A black substance burst out.

The black energy that flowed out began to gather into one.

"Huh?"

People reflexively trembled with fear.

Something was descending upon this place.

It wasn't a sage.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was impossible to describe it as terrifying or eerie. No sentence or vocabulary could explain it.

It was an existence that transcended their cognition itself.

[Condition: Defeat the powerful god who descended before all the pillars are destroyed. If you fail, all humanity will lose their lives.]"
