**Chapter 354**

**354. 75th Floor, Wandering Planet (1)**

In theory, if he defeated another immortal, he could also steal their powers. With a mortal body, he could possess multiple immortal powers.

It was truly ridiculous. An immortal's power was the condensed energy they had built up over their lifetime. To steal that was absurd. Especially for a mortal, not an immortal.

"No way."

The ghost changed his thinking.

It wasn't strange that a mortal had a skill that allowed them to surpass their limits.

What was strange was that, despite having such a skill, they were still stuck at the mortal level.

"Are they filling the gap by stealing?"

In many ways, it was irregular. At least, it couldn't be explained by the ghost's common sense.

Taesan checked the remaining skills. The activation skill he had obtained by crossing the boundary. Beyond the boundary.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Skill Name: Transcendence of Boundary
Mana Cost: ???
Proficiency: 1%
Description: Those who stand on the brink of death and beyond can barely handle the power that lies beyond the boundary. This skill can be used in conjunction with attacks or skills.

"So it's the power from beyond."

It seemed like a skill that needed to be experienced firsthand to fully understand.

[You activated Transcendence of Boundary]

A strange sensation washed over him.

It was as if he was floating in the air, with a sense of detachment from the world.

Tae San gathered his mana.

[You activated Chill of the Abyss]

Whoosh!

A wave of cold enveloped the surroundings. Chill of the Abyss was a mid-level spell that Tae San was particularly fond of and skilled at.

However, the activated Chill of the Abyss was different this time.

The cold swept through everything, freezing it solid.

Tae San was not an exception.

The cold began to spread from his activated finger to his arm. He shivered as his entire body froze, and his breath hitched.

The activated Chill of the Abyss was different from what he had used before. Tae San quickly canceled the spell and distanced himself from it.

Whoosh!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Even though Taesan cancelled the activation, the frozen world still maintained its enormous size. It was as if it didn't follow Taesan's control.

[Is the power contained within the frozen world, which I've been using, different from usual?]

Even if I used magic overlap and forced amplification, I couldn't reach this level of power.

The power was undoubtedly overwhelming. An ordinary mortal wouldn't be able to withstand it.

But the risk was also clear.

"It's hard to control."

It was difficult to use the power from beyond the boundary as Taesan intended. If I made a mistake, I could even harm myself.

"It's risky, but... it's usable."

Control was difficult, but not impossible. Just now, I was able to avoid taking damage by adjusting it to the maximum.

A trump card that could be used more stably than the boundary. It seemed like I could accept it that way.

Finally, all the checks were complete. It was the moment when Taesan was about to head down to the 75th floor.

The space burst open. A thick, dark energy spread out like a labyrinth, creating a path for its master.

Taesan stopped in his tracks. He opened his mouth, facing the one who appeared.

"It's been a long time. Lord Mashin."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The figure of a young girl appeared, accompanied by a god's laughter. She stood in front of Taesan, smiling.

[Thanks to this, I got to see something enjoyable again.]

"Have you been watching?"

[I didn't intervene, but I did keep an eye on things.]

The god smiled mischievously.

[It was an extremely rare sight. The outsiders were also very surprised, and they'll probably be interested in you.]

But I have no intention of backing down. The god muttered quietly.

[The reason I appeared this time is that I have something to deliver to you.]

A black chair materialized behind the god. She sat down and said,

"76th floor. The guides of evil will come to fight you there. And their number is not just one, unlike before.]

"There are several of them, I see."

Taesan nodded, unsurprised. It was an expected development, so there was no significant emotional change.

The guides can no longer take on Taesan alone, so they're trying to overwhelm with numbers. It wasn't an unusual story.

But another question arose.

"That's all well and good, but they still can't defeat me, can they?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's right. If it's you now, you can win even if a few of them come."

The demon nodded.

"I put a restriction on them because it wasn't a fair fight."

Until now, the guides had been overwhelmingly strong. Watching someone's one-sided fight wasn't fun, so the demon put a restriction on the guides. And it was the same in the opposite situation.

"Taesan. I'm thinking of putting a restriction on you regarding leveling up."

"Leveling up?"

"When the level goes up in the labyrinth's system, all statuses are restored."

Health, mana, and even mental power. Everything becomes optimal. Taesan had used that to win before.

"The restriction I'm putting on you is that during battles with guides, you won't be able to recover due to leveling up."

Even if the level goes up, the status won't be restored.

Taesan asked.

"Is it forced?"

"No. You're different from those fools. You can accept my restriction or not. It's entirely your freedom and choice. But if you accept... I'll give you a suitable reward."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The worry was short-lived. Taesan nodded his head.

"I'll accept it."

The fact that the demon gave him such a restriction meant that he still had a good chance of winning.

If he could get another reward, there was no reason to refuse. The demon smiled slyly.

[Good. Then I'll look forward to it. Work hard and get stronger. And someday...].

With that, the demon disappeared.

Taesan headed towards the 75th floor again.

[75th Floor Quest started.] [Clear the world within 1 hour.] [Reward: A ring made from the world's core.] [Secret Reward: ???] [What's this?].

The ghost, who had seen the quest conditions, spoke in a delighted tone.

[Is the 75th floor quest still the same? It's been a long time, but it hasn't changed. And yet...]

"You've cleared this quest before, haven't you?"

[As I said before, there's a floor where you have to clear the world within an hour. That's right here.]

Taesan entered the 75th floor.

The room on the 75th floor had a distorted space. As he entered, the space changed.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan arrived on a planet with nothing on it.

[You have activated the realm detection of Leraje.]

Magic began to spread across the land.

And the only thing that was certain was that there was no one here.

As he looked up, he saw the vast universe. The atmosphere that made up the planet was almost nonexistent.

In the universe, nothing was visible.

Literally, this planet was the only one abandoned.

It was not an environment where life could survive. It was a world that had ended in a different sense from Halfra's world.

"Is it okay if I just complete it without any special conditions?"

The size of the world didn't seem that vast. Compared to the Earth, it was ridiculously small. Even if it wasn't Taesan, but another adventurer, it would be easy to complete with sufficient preparation.

[It can't be that easy, right?]

Just as the ghost's words ended, the system window appeared.

[Complete the world within one hour, breaking through all obstacles.]

The will to conquer the entire world began to manifest, seeping into every corner.

"This is what an obstacle looks like."

Taesan nodded and stomped his foot.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And the will of the world arose, and began to block the great mountain.

* * *

That small, wandering planet was nothing from the start.

It was abandoned in a corner of the universe, unable to belong to any system, and was destined to wander the universe, eventually growing cold and disappearing.

Originally, such a planet would not have any will.

But the wandering planet was unique.

As it wandered the universe, it encountered numerous planets teeming with life, and from a certain moment on, it began to develop a faint will.

The first emotion the wandering planet with a will felt was anger and resentment.

Why was I abandoned like this?

Why do I have to disappear alone and forlorn?

Why can't I nurture life?

Countless emotions echoed throughout the planet.

But there was no life to feel those emotions.

It had a will, but it didn't have the power to make life possible.

So the wandering planet wandered endlessly, filled with anger.

Having a will was the greatest misfortune of the wandering planet.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"For an uncountable amount of time, the planet had been drifting through space, and it was destined to continue living like that. But then, someone arrived on the planet.

"Wow, you've found this place. I'll have to praise you later."

The person who had traversed space and appeared on the planet muttered to himself. The planet, which had been endlessly enraged, stopped in its tracks when it saw the life form that had found its world.

It was a living, breathing being.

The wizard, who would create a labyrinth in the future, smiled and waved his hand.

"Nice to meet you."

The moment his voice was heard, the planet revealed its hostility. The anger that had accumulated over an uncountable amount of time had transformed into hatred towards all living things.

The earth rose up to trample the wizard, and the atmosphere turned toxic.

The wizard grasped all of that hostility.

"Is that it? Not bad."

After grasping it, the wizard applauded.

At the same time, the raging earth calmed down, and the toxic atmosphere quickly returned to normal.

The world was freed from its control. As the planet was taken aback, the wizard asked:

"Do you hate all living things?"

It was a question formed by language, but the meaning behind it was something even the planet could understand."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The planet was hesitant and nodded. It had never had a conversation with anyone before, so its emotions were quite distorted, but the wizard understood easily.

"Then, won't you make a contract with me?"

The wizard proposed to the planet.

As a layer of the labyrinth, connections would be made, and adventurers would regularly come to visit the planet.

It didn't matter what happened to the adventurers who came. They could be killed or left alone.

As long as the adventurers met the conditions, they would move on to another place.

The planet didn't fully understand the contract, but it readily accepted it.

Life came to this abandoned land. And it was up to the planet to do as it pleased with that life.

There was no reason to refuse.

After that, the planet became the 75th layer of the labyrinth.

Many adventurers came. The planet tried to kill them.

Some couldn't withstand it and died, while others managed to survive and return.

What would happen to this life?

How much could it withstand its own power?

The planet's will quietly laughed. From a certain point on, tormenting and killing adventurers became the pillar that supported the planet's will.

For now, it would start lightly. The planet gathered its strength.

Kukuku!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The earth became a massive wall, covering the planet. The weight of the soil was immense, but it was as if the planet's own will was contained within, making it extremely difficult to push through.

This wouldn't kill him. The 75th floor of the planet had grasped the overall strength of the adventurers who visited.

Indeed, the planet pierced through the soil and revealed its form.

But it was different from the planet's expectations.

Even if it broke through the soil, it would suffer some damage, or so it thought. Every adventurer had done so until now.

However, the planet's exterior, which had broken through, was not even covered in a single speck of dust.

No matter how much power was poured into it, the planet did not suffer any damage.

As things didn't go as planned, the planet nervously summoned a gust of wind. The wind gathered and became a massive storm.

This wind contained everything. It was the power that had killed the most adventurers so far.

Originally, it was used just before reaching the destination, but the planet was so frustrated that it used it right away.

The planet believed that it could finally inflict significant damage on the planet.

Facing the raging storm, the planet clenched its fist.

Whooooom!

The storm exploded and disappeared with the thrown fist.

The planet stopped. The planet shook its hand.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
