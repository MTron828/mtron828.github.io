Chapter 195

195. The 44th Floor: The God of Despair, Aphrodia (1)

Before descending to the 44th floor, I searched for a release. She greeted me warmly.

"What's up?"

"There's something to be handed over."

I handed over the equipment I obtained while descending the floor to the God of Magic.

"This intermediate magic is too much to handle, isn't it?"

"Uh... yes?"

"How much more do I need to hand over to get it?"

The difference in power between intermediate and beginner magic was like heaven and earth. If I could learn it, of course, intermediate magic would be the priority.

Aphrodia hesitated and looked at me with an ambiguous face.

"Very, very, very much more?"

"Indeed, it's like that."

The amount of offerings was enormous, making it hard to talk about specific numbers. It was only natural to think about the power of intermediate magic.

"I also received permission, but I haven't learned it yet. I'll work hard."

She let out a strange sound.

Her expression was very bright, as if she would learn a lot.

I turned around and descended to the 44th floor.
Here is the translation of the text:

The monsters on the 44th floor were left with nothing but desperation. It was only natural that they would be meaningless to the Taesan. The ghost muttered to himself as he watched Taesan rushing around like a madman.

"It'll be over in no time, up to the 50th floor, that is. But maybe not? I can't predict what kind of reaction we'll get."

"What's going on?"

The ghost said that it would be difficult to quickly pass through the 40th floor, but he was stopped by something.

"I'll find out soon. If my memory is correct, I should be on the 44th floor."

"Will it take a long time?"

"Maybe?"

So, there must have been something that needed to be done before that.

Taesan opened the community.

[Kang Jun-hyuk [Alone] : Wow, is this real?] [Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard] : Yeah, we're also surprised. We've seen signs of this before, but we didn't think it would actually happen.] [Lee Tae-yeon [Alone] : Congratulations... I guess?] [Geum Jung-geun [Hard] : Yes, isn't it? It's a good thing, no matter what.]

In the community, people were talking loudly. Taesan invited Lee Tae-yeon, Kang Jun-hyuk, Kim Hwi-yeon, and Geum Jung-geun.

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone] : Ah, Taesan-sir?] [Kang Jun-hyuk [Alone] : What's going on?] [Taesan [Alone] : I just wanted to check how things are going after a long time.]
Here is the translation of the text:

It had been a long time since I had made contact with other players. I thought about asking them for advice on what they had been doing and how far they had come, so that I could get some guidance.

[Kang Tae-san [Alone] : What kind of story is this?] [Kim Hui-yeon [Hard] : It's not a big deal, but... someone has come saying they want to get married.]

Tae-san was taken aback.

[Kang Tae-san [Alone] : Are they people you used to date?] [Kim Hui-yeon [Hard] : No, we met for the first time in a labyrinth. They asked me to be their witness, but I refused. We were fighting, and some people were living alone, feeling lonely.]

Kim Hui-yeon sighed. Tae-san stroked his chin.

‘Are people getting married already?’

It wasn't an unusual thing. They were trapped in the labyrinth and had to survive for a long time. Since most people had died, they were struggling with loneliness.

It was natural for people who were lonely to form relationships with each other.

However, it took a long time to get to that point. In the beginning, they had to focus all their energy on surviving, so it wasn't until three to four years later that the first couples started forming.

But now, only half that time had passed.
Here is the translation of the text:

Unlike in the past, I had finally gained some freedom with people. After talking about miscellaneous stories related to the labyrinth, Tae-san asked a question.

[Kang Tae-san: Where have you gotten to so far?] [Lee Tae-yeon: We're on the 15th floor. Jun-hyeok is the same, right?] [Kang Tae-san: You're moving fast.] [Kang Jun-hyeok: It's all thanks to my brother. I'm using the ability sword and black magic... it's really unbelievable.]

Just by reading the text, one could feel the excitement and astonishment. There were also skills that could show such a reaction.

[Kang Jun-hyeok: Originally, I had to struggle even against a single monster, but now it's not that difficult. Although my mana is a bit lacking, I can still overcome it without much trouble. It's all thanks to my brother.] [Kang Tae-san: That's enough.]

The 15th floor. Tae-san thought for a moment about what was next, then wrote in his journal.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Kang Tae-san [Alone]: There's a blacksmith on the 16th floor. If you bring him all the materials you've gathered, he'll make something decent, so make sure to collect them well.]

[Kang Jun-hyeok [Alone]: Is there a blacksmith too?]

[Lee Tae-yeon [Alone]: I was wondering where to use the materials, and it turned out to be there. Got it. Thanks.]

Tae-san changed the subject to talk about hard mode this time. He asked if everything was going smoothly and if there were any problems.

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: We're fine too.]

[Geum Jung-geun [Hard]: The wind of Seir's sword? That's really great. Thanks to that, I've been able to descend more easily so far.]

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: There's a minor issue with black magic, but it's not a big deal, so I'm just ignoring it.]

It seemed that there were no major problems overall.

After confirming, Tae-san closed the community window.

[Kang Tae-san [Alone]: Don't die, come down.]

Tae-san started going down the labyrinth again.

As he went on...

He found what the ghost had said.

[You have discovered Aphrodite's altar.] [Initial discovery bonus. +50 mana, +30 intelligence]

The altar was without a concrete form, having a metaphysical shape.

The power felt thick and dark, interfering with one's emotions.

"What's going on with that time you were talking about?"

[Yes.]

The ghost agreed.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Aphrodite, the god of despair. I don't want to see humans being driven to despair and then overcoming it. That's why I find trials to be an unpleasant hobby. If you're not talented, you'll have to suffer a bit.]

The power that flowed from the altar gathered before Taesan, as if it was approaching me.

There was no reason to refuse.

Taesan placed his hand on the altar.

[Start of sub-quest] Aphrodite wants to test you, who has come to her altar. If you accept, a trial will come to you. If you overcome it, a reward will follow. [Reward: Aphrodite will determine according to your achievements.]

"I accept."

[Acceptance of sub-quest.] [Manifestation of Aphrodite's power. As a counterbalance, Aphrodite's interference area is reduced.] [Aphrodite appears before the altar.]

A massive being descends upon this place.

"What?"

The ghost was taken aback. It didn't expect a god to manifest in the underworld.

Taesan, who is often favored by the gods, may not feel any unusual emotions, but it is extremely rare for a god to manifest directly in the underworld.

A black-haired man appeared, transcending space. With a cold impression, he opened his mouth.

[I've finally met the infamous one, I suppose.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The Mountain God bent his body.

The opponent was a god. There was no way to find fault with him.

When the Mountain God bent his body, Aphrodite's expression slightly relaxed.

[I thought you were arrogant because you received attention from others, but it seems that's not the case. I like it.]

“Can I ask what kind of deed brought you here?”

The Mountain God was taken aback, just like a ghost. It was because there was no reason for Aphrodite to descend.

However, Aphrodite's subsequent words made him realize.

[Many creatures do not favor you. We can award you a reward that is worthy of our consideration, to the extent that we can.]

The divine battlefield.

The gods who had put the Mountain God to the test at that place gave him a reward. However, many gods at the time questioned the magnitude of the reward given to the Mountain God.

Although the Mountain God had achieved a feat worthy of praise, it was unclear whether he was deserving of such a reward.

Aphrodite seemed to have descended to verify this. The Mountain God realized that his expectations were accurate through Aphrodite's subsequent words.
Here is the translation of the text:

[So I'll test you. Are they really fond of you, or is your value truly recognized by you?]

[Aphrodite proposes a strengthened trial to you.]

[Will you accept it?]

Tai Shan nodded his head.

Tai Shan immediately accepted, and Aphrodite's lips slightly curved upwards.

[It's to your liking.]

The power began to envelop the room. Aphrodite opened her mouth.

[Look at your despair and win. That's my trial.] [Aphrodite's manifestation of power. Aphrodite's interference zone is reduced.]

Kuku kuku kuku.

The power began to swallow the space.

The labyrinth began to unravel, and a new space took its place.

It was not simply a transition to another world.

It was a kind of realization.

The space fit together like a puzzle, and Aphrodite's power grew stronger and stronger. A look of astonishment appeared on Aphrodite's face.

[For a moment.]

The power erupted suddenly.

The ghost took a breath. The entire existence of the labyrinth shook momentarily.

Aphrodite let out a sigh.

[......This is.] [Aphrodite's manifestation of power.] [Aphrodite's interference zone is greatly reduced.]

Kuuuuu!
Here is the translation of the text:

The space was turned upside down. The familiar world began to cover the labyrinth. The laughter of Aphrodite echoed from the disappearing world.

[That's what it was. It's fun.]

And the labyrinth disappeared.

The mighty force's wave made Taesan close his eyes.

"How will it be?"

It was not a simple space transfer. The sensation was vastly different from what he had felt before.

Taesan took a deep breath and calmed his mind.

"Brother?"

At the familiar voice, Taesan opened his eyes wide.

A massive door appeared. Taesan gazed blankly and stretched out his hand.

The sensation of the door touched his hand.

Taesan looked back. There was a desolate plain stretching out before him.

And he looked up at the sky.

There, he saw a massive hole.

"Brother? Aren't you coming in? What are you doing?"

A man with a bewildered expression stared at him, and Taesan burst out laughing.

"Jin Jung-geun?"

"Yes, it's me. What's going on? Suddenly?"

Jin Jung-geun looked startled and came down. He looked around Taesan and asked:

"Is the runaway one?"

Taesan remembered this conversation.

His mouth opened naturally.

"I'm dead. My corpse was all eaten by monster-like things."

"Ne?"
Here is the translation of the text to English:

Jung-geun was startled. His face was familiar to him.

"That guy is a hardcore player, but he's already dead?"

"There are three A-grade monsters eating each other nicely."

"Ah......"

Jung-geun's face stiffened.

Taesan's head was complex, as usual.

"Where are you? We have to go quickly......"

"I've taken care of it, so you don't need it."

Taesan passed by Jung-geun.

"Let's go first. My head hurts."

"Ah, okay."

Jung-geun closed the door.

Taesan looked at the scene inside the door.

Ruined buildings.

People eating potatoes with familiar expressions.

He laughed ironically.

This was Seoul before it returned to the past.

It was just about to be destroyed.

* * *

"What's going on?"

Taesan quickly turned his head around.

Was everything until now just a dream? It's impossible. His physical body still felt the experience and strength he had accumulated over time.

"...Statue change."
Here is the translation of the text:

[Kang Tae-san] [Level: 91] [Shield: 1899/1899] [Stamina: 20920/20920] [Mana: 2722/2722] [Magic: 376/376] [Strength: 4693] [Intelligence: 4124] [Agility: 4333] [Attack Power + 858] [Defense Power + 738] [Target is in the best state.]

After checking the stat window, it was certain. He was not in Ji mode, but rather in Eorlon mode.

So, is this a hallucination?

I felt the solid sensation of the ground beneath my feet. I also felt the cool sensation of the wind and the ominous aura from the sky.

Even if my senses are deceived, I cannot deceive my intuition and strength.

This is not a hallucination.

As I approached, I saw Kang Tae-san stop in his tracks and raise an eyebrow.

"Brother, are you going to eat? You must be hungry, right?"

Kang Tae-san stared blankly and then opened his mouth.

"Block it."

"Okay?"

Kang Tae-san clenched his fist. The oppressive atmosphere suddenly assaulted me, and I raised my hands in alarm.

Quack!

I flew backward, still blocking the attack.

Kuuh!

I jumped up from the trash can and stood up.

"Brother! What's going on suddenly?"

"It's just a simple test."

Kang Tae-san waved his fist. I realized from the previous battle that...

Kang Tae-san had the same strength as I remembered.

[This is... quite surprising.]
Here is the translation of the text:

A ghost whispered along with a sigh.

Tae-san burst out laughing. Jung-geun grumbled.

"This is just a test, too. I'll die at the hands of my senior...".

As Jung-geun was telling the story, he suddenly realized something was strange.

"Hey? Senior, didn't you just use your skill? But you just threw me away?"

"It's just a misunderstanding. It's just a misunderstanding."

"Is it a misunderstanding?"

Tae-san wrapped his arm around Jung-geun's shoulder, which was full of confusion.

"Let's go eat."

They headed towards the restaurant. There, a few people were eating. They saw Tae-san and waved at him.

"Tae-san, you're here?"

Tae-san sat down at his seat, greeting them familiarly.

Jung-geun brought a potato. He put it in his mouth and felt the crunchy texture.

Tae-san chewed the potato and summarized the situation.

"It's not a fantasy."

Everything was real. The potato, the Jung-geun in front of him, and the people he was greeting.

This place was really the earth he had returned to before his past.
