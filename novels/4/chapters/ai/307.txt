Chapter 308

308. The Fifth Return, Earth (4)

"Emperor?"

Kim Hwi-yeon asked with a tremble.

Emperor? It was an extremely outdated term.

However, all the Chinese players bowed their heads at the man's words.

Countless people knelt down and bowed their heads. The Korean and Japanese players looked at them in dismay.

When they didn't bow, the dry-looking man let out a mocking laugh.

"As expected, the lowly ones don't know the greatness of His Majesty."

He looked around, taking in the desolate land and the polluted earth. His face twisted in disgust.

"This is not a place fit for the great Emperor to reside! Wait! You lowly ones! First, let's prepare a dwelling for His Majesty, and then we can talk again."

The man gestured. The people carrying the palanquin moved their heavy feet and climbed up Baekdu Mountain.

"What's going on? Who's that?"

The one called the Emperor.

People were flustered by the unexpected situation.

And regardless of their confusion, the quest continued to progress.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

**[Special Quest Begins]**

**[Players from each country have gathered at Baekdu Mountain. A small number of players who have not yet arrived at Baekdu Mountain will receive a large penalty if they do not arrive within the next week.]**

**[For the next week, prepare your base and get ready to defend against monster attacks. The main quest will begin in a week.]**

**[Choose a representative for each country.]**

**[During this quest, players from each country cannot harm each other.]**

“Representative?”

Each country had a leader, but this was the first time they were being asked to directly choose a representative.

“What do we do about this?”

“Kim Hwi-yeon, you do it.”

Taesan said nonchalantly.

“There’s no one else who can do it, right? I don’t want to do it.”

From the beginning, Kim Hwi-yeon had overcome all the conflicts in each region and become the leader. Now, it was impossible for someone else to become the representative.

The only exception was Taesan, but he didn’t want to do it.

“Okay, I will.”

Kim Hwi-yeon became the representative by popular vote.

Japan was not much different. Ichijo Eika became the representative without much conflict.

“What about North Korea...?”

“They’ll figure it out themselves.”

It would be difficult for the numerous factions to choose a representative.

But that wasn’t the important issue.

What was more important was something else.

China.

Their countless players, impossible to count.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

South Korea and Japan were like a handful, numerous to the point of being overwhelming. It was impossible to estimate the number.

And they had to proceed with the quest together.

Players from South Korea and Japan tried to talk to Chinese players and exchange information. They tried to build friendships and coordinate their battle strategies.

But that's where the problem started.

"Hey?"

"Hey... can you please respond?"

Chinese players completely ignored South Korean and Japanese players.

They would avoid eye contact and dodge conversations, making it seem like they were invisible.

People were flustered. To clear the quest, they needed to work together and have a conversation.

But the Chinese players showed no intention of cooperating.

"What's going on?"

Kim Hwi-yeon grumbled.

"What are they trying to do? Are they trying to survive on their own? This is too weird."

"Hmm."

Taesan was also surprised. In his past life, China was not like this.

While many players had survived, it wasn't to this extent, and there was no emperor-like figure.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was more like North Korea, where the leader was unclear and the factions were divided and fighting each other. And as the quest progressed and people kept dying, they gradually regained stability.

But now, it was a completely different scene.

"'The guy who rode the turtle is the emperor,' they said."

And the power that could be felt in that place.

Taesan smiled quietly. There was something he could infer.

Just one day had passed, and a residence for the emperor was prepared.

A withered old man called out to them.

"His Majesty is summoning you."

* * *

"Ah."

Lee Tae-yeon stuck out his tongue. The emperor's residence, created by the heavens, was truly the epitome of luxury.

A massive silk fabric, as large as a sports stadium, was used to create a canopy. Around it were placed extravagant decorations that seemed priceless.

"Is this something I saw in a textbook?"

"That's right. It's a famous statue in China, and it's here......"

Eika muttered to herself, touching the statue in awe.

"What is this? Seriously."

In a situation where humanity's survival was at stake, where they had to risk their lives to fight, they had brought such a large amount of silk and carried this statue here.

"Let's... go in and take a look, shall we?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They didn't know anything about China yet. They didn't even know how they had survived.

The one called the Emperor had summoned representatives from each country: Kim Hwi-yeon, Aika, and also Lee Tae-yeon, Kang Jun-hyeok, and Tae-san. There were only five of them in total.

The withered old man was rambling on about the precautions to take when meeting the Emperor, but they all ignored him.

"Look, we're the only ones who were summoned, so let's take a look around the community, shall we? But there's no answer."

Kang Jun-hyeok grumbled. The fact that he had specifically called out Lee Tae-yeon, Kang Jun-hyeok, and Kang Tae-san meant that he knew they were the strongest in solo mode.

They passed through the entrance and entered the tent.

On the opposite side of the entrance, a high throne was placed.

Kim Hwi-yeon slightly scrunched up his face when he saw the man sitting on it.

"A dragon robe?"

The man was wearing a dragon robe, which ancient emperors used to wear.

The man sitting on the throne looked down at them and spoke in a tone that was calm but full of confidence.

"I am Jinryong, the ruler of the earth."

"What nonsense is this?"

Kang Jun-hyeok clicked his tongue. Jinryong continued to speak without any change in his emotions.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I understand. The insect that crawls on the ground cannot comprehend the thoughts of the bird that flies in the sky. But I am correct."

The tone of Jinryong's voice was filled with arrogance. It was unique.

"You are weak and feeble," Jinryong said.

"You are people who can only survive with someone's protection. Like me, a great person's protection."

Jinryong looked at Kim Hwi-yeon.

"You, who were chosen as Korea's representative. How many players does your country have?"

"......40,000."

"Then, you, Japan's representative. How many survivors does your country have?"

"40,000."

When Jinryong heard that number, he said confidently, "The players I lead in China number 100 million."

100 million.

The overwhelming number left them speechless. Even considering that China had a large population, the survival rate was extremely high.

Taesan was also shocked. In his past life, China had not even survived one-tenth of that.

"40,000 and 40,000. Truly insignificant small numbers."

There was a hint of disdain in Jinryong's voice.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I know that both countries had millions of people. But you couldn't even save that many? Do you have the qualifications to be a leader?"

Kim Hwi-yeon and Aika were speechless at his words.

"You don't have the qualifications."

Jinryong sneered, baring his teeth.

The tent began to flutter.

The faces of everyone except Taesan hardened.

"You don't have the qualifications to rule over people. That's the limit of your inferior people."

Jinryong stood up from his seat.

"Become my people. Follow my orders and carry out my instructions. Then I will save you and protect you as my people."

He spoke confidently, like an emperor.

At the same time, a massive power burst out from Jinryong.

"Ah..."

"Uh."

Kim Hwi-yeon and Aika's faces turned pale. Lee Tae-yeon and Gang Jun-hyeok were shocked.

"For a moment..."

Gang Jun-hyeok had met Amelia before. Her power was monstrous. Gang Jun-hyeok, who had believed that no one except Taesan and Lee Tae-yeon could be his match, thought that he couldn't possibly win against her power.

But the power that Jinryong was showing now was even more overwhelming.

It was impossible to approach him.

It was like the power of an absolute ruler.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ku ku ku ku!"

Their strength was bursting out even more fiercely. Lee Tae-yeon and Kang Joon-hyuk gritted their teeth and endured, but Kim Hwi-yeon and Eika's bodies began to bend.

Jinryong spoke calmly.

"Accept it. Umin. It's the best choice you can make."

Kim Hwi-yeon's lips trembled. It was as if she was being crushed by an overwhelming presence.

But she bit her lip.

Jinryong's face scrunched up in annoyance at her unresponsive attitude, and he was about to increase his strength even more.

"What's going on? Is this all there is to it?"

A quiet murmur was heard.

For the first time, Jinryong's eyes wavered.

Taesan was looking at him with a calm gaze, as if taking a stroll.

"What?"

Jinryong was taken aback. Despite Taesan being right next to him, he hadn't noticed his presence at all.

Taesan looked at Jinryong and said,

"This is fun."

"......You're Taesan, the one who claims to have gone deeper into alone mode than anyone else."

Jinryong bared his teeth.

"It doesn't matter. You're just a human. You can't reach me."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power of Jinryong exploded.

All the pressure was directed at Taesan.

It was a concentrated force that threatened to crush life itself.

Taesan smiled quietly.

A tiny bit of power flowed out of him.

Kiiiiing!

"Whoa!"

Kim Hwi-yeon exhaled, and the wave of power collided with Jinryong's pressure, shattering it.

"......You?"

Jinryong's eyes darted back and forth like a madman.

Kim Hwi-yeon and Eika, unaware of the situation, stared at the two in a daze, gasping for breath.

After a moment of silence, Jinryong opened his mouth.

"......My interest has been broken. Get out. I'll hear your answer later."

He seemed to have no intention of answering further and got down from his throne, heading outside the tent.

As he left, Taesan asked him with a smile, "I heard the North Korean players went to meet you guys."

The group of dozens, divided into smaller units, headed north to join forces with China.

"Where did they go?"

Jinryong left without answering.

Taesan helped Kim Hwi-yeon and Eika to their feet.

"Are you okay?"

"Yeah... I'm fine..."

Kim Hwi-yeon struggled to get up.

"Thank you, Taesan."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ah, thank you......"

"Hyung."

Gang Jun-hyuk asked with a stiff face.

"What's that? That thing?"

"......Isn't it too strong? At that level, shouldn't it be around 50 floors?"

Lee Tae-yeon and Gang Jun-hyuk were flustered. While Kim Hwi-yeon and Aika only felt a simple, immense pressure, the two of them, who were tackling the Alone mode, could feel the power of Jinryong more directly.

"Is there anyone else who has gone down to that level besides you, hyung-nim?"

Jinryong's power was too strong.

Even Lee Tae-yeon and Gang Jun-hyuk had a power that was impossible to win against.

Taesan let out a sigh and said,

"You guys didn't feel it?"

"Yes?"

"What's going on?"

"If you didn't feel it, then that's that."

Taesan muttered to himself alone.

He had felt a massive concentration of power from Jinryong since the moment he met him.

It wasn't something that could be obtained simply by going down to the labyrinth.

Nor was it something that could be obtained by receiving the attention of a god, like Amelia.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power that Jinryong possessed was a mixture of various unstable forces that seemed like they could explode at any moment. And such a kind of power was not something that could be obtained normally.

And when Jinryong used his true nature recognition, Taesan confirmed it.

[A slave of the beast that craves life.]"
