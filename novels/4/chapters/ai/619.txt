**Chapter 620**

**620. The Side Story of the Labyrinth Magician (3)**

If I were to make one, I would do it with all my might.

Then, what kind of dungeon could I make?

There are many types of dungeons. Labyrinths, towers, mazes... and within those, there are diverse forms.

Which form should I choose?

The man, who was momentarily lost in thought, made a decision.

"I think a labyrinth would be good."

The biggest advantage of a labyrinth is that it's not limited to one form. I can create numerous layers, and with each layer having a different structure, I can make a diverse labyrinth.

"Let's make it around 100 layers for now."

I'll decide on that temporarily. As I create it, I might get more excited and make it even deeper.

Then, how should I design it?

How should I create the reward system?

I imagine it, and that imagination is quite enjoyable. The man was designing the labyrinth in his mind, but his enthusiasm slowly faded away.

"......In the end, it's just killing time."

The labyrinth made with all his might, reflecting his tastes. The design might be fun.

But that's all there is to it.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In the end, the design of the labyrinth is nothing but a fleeting pleasure. Even if a mortal enters the labyrinth and tries to conquer it, the man already knows the entire outcome.

Why? Because he is the god of adventure.

He knows all about every concept that is realized through adventure.

What he wants is not that.

It's a change that can permanently fill this emptiness, not just a momentary pleasure.

And at that moment, the man realized.

'...Huh.'

A dry laugh escaped. The man immediately realized that what he had thought was absurd.

But it was enjoyable enough.

Then, isn't that enough?

The man laughed and moved on.

* * *

[You've come to find me. What a strange thing to do.]

The man, the god of cycles, came to find Arilnan. Arilnan asked lazily.

[Did you find the answer?]

"Yes."

[Oh?]

Interest sparkled on Arilnan's face.

[I've seen many transcenders like you, but none of them have found the answer. You've found it? I'm curious. What's the answer?]

"First, I'd like to confirm a few things. Can a transcender abandon their own concept?"

[...Is that the solution?]

Arilnan smiled wryly."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's possible. A concept reached by oneself. If you abandon yourself, you can abandon it. There were even transcendents who made the same decision. But you won't be able to endure it yourself."

It was a natural thing to say.

"To give up a purpose more precious than one's own life, which one had sought since mortal times, was an absurd act. It didn't take much thought to realize it was crazy."

"Abandoning a realm reached by oneself means abandoning oneself. Your spirit will collapse and crumble."

"Maybe that's the case."

The man didn't deny it. It was a sad story. Having reached it, he felt emptiness, but abandoning it would bring even greater emptiness.

However, the man's answer was not that.

"Then I'll ask again. If I abandon my own concept, do I become a mortal?"

"That's... not the case. You're still a transcendent. But you're a transcendent with a vast, empty domain that controls nothing."

The man who heard those words laughed.

"Then I can fill that empty space."

"......I know what you're thinking. It's a plausible idea, but it's impossible."

Arilnan shook his head with a pitiful expression.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You are a god of adventure. It's a result of your existence. Even if you empty and refill that place, the emptiness won't disappear."

It was a matter of course.

The man was a god of adventure.

It was a goal he had aimed for even before he became a transcendent being.

It was, so to speak, the highest point of achievement.

Even if you empty and refill that place, the emptiness won't disappear.

[And there's a big problem. How do you fill the empty space? Are you going to go through hardships again to gain something?]

"No way. I don't think I can dominate the concept again to that extent."

He became a god of adventure not only because of his talent, but also because thousands of lucky coincidences overlapped and happened.

That's what it means to be a transcendent being. It's not something you can easily give up and replace with something new.

The man knew all of that.

He was aiming for something different.

"Then, can't other transcendent beings fill that empty space instead of me?"

[……Huh?]

"I need your help."

The man smiled faintly.

Arilnan stared at the man for a moment, then burst out laughing.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Haha... Are you going to fill your empty domain with our domain?]

"This empty domain. Victory, selection, struggle, and the concept of circulation. Nothing that enters is strange. And you are a powerful transcender. Can't you fill my empty domain to some extent?"

"[That's interesting. Another transcender is filling the empty domain. I've never heard of that before.]

Arlin's eyes sparkled with interest.

"[It's not an impossible story. You are the god of adventure. Your level is quite high. You can even take on the concepts of other transcendents. You might get tainted and broken, but it's not a big problem since it's an empty domain. However, the problem still hasn't been solved.]

"That's true."

The man didn't deny it. Arlin continued.

"[Our domain is not infinite. To fill your domain with concepts, we have to pay the corresponding price.]

Transcenders each dominate the concepts of the universe itself.

To have a huge impact, they have to consume their own interference domain.

In other words, the concepts that exist throughout the universe are being worn away."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If the interference domain of the god of victory decreases, the value of victory in the entire universe decreases.

As it worsens, eventually, the concept itself may disappear from the universe and cease to exist. Arilnan has seen a few transcendents who have disappeared like that.

"It's okay. I don't aim for such a large domain. Just divide it fairly and give it to me."

[Even so, you can't deny the fact that it's being consumed. Above all, you, who have received someone else's domain, can't fill the emptiness either. You know that, so what are you aiming for?]

"It's nothing special."

The man laughed.

"I'm thinking of a fun toy box."

[A toy box?]

"Arilnan, I'll ask you. Why do our transcendents watch over mortals, give them trials, and make some of them apostles?"

[It's because it's necessary for us.]

Arilnan replied calmly.

"A transcendent is someone who has reached the end point. There's nothing more to achieve or strive for. In order for us not to kill ourselves, the concepts we govern must have an impact on the universe."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"How much does the concept of choice affect the universe?

How much does the concept of struggle affect the universe?

It was absolutely necessary for the transcendent being to verify that. When mortals desperately challenge and achieve their own concepts, the transcendent being obtains an indescribable sense of satisfaction.

But it's extremely rare for a man to not feel satisfied with that, and every transcendent being enjoys seeing someone with exceptional talent make efforts related to their concept.

It wasn't just for entertainment; it was necessary for them to exist as transcendent beings who dominate concepts.

"But the universe is vast. There are cases where we can't confirm that someone with the potential to become a transcendent being is exhausted from struggling and disappears."

[Well, that's true.]

The universe is vast. A transcendent being is close to perfection, but not perfect. It's not possible to see all the possibilities of every mortal. It's only about observing the believers who trust and follow themselves.

"What I'm aiming for is simple."

The man smiled brightly.

"I will gather all those possibilities."

[……What did you say?]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I will create a dungeon. Ah, Arirnan. A dungeon created by numerous Overlords combining their powers. A dungeon to test mortals and observe their struggles."

Arirnan's eyes widened.

"A dungeon created by Overlords. Challenge it and seize its power. Its existence will be known throughout the universe. And those with talent from each universe, who believe in their own power, will seek out the dungeon. They will prove themselves before the Overlords and further temper their power. Many possibilities that Arirnan has not seen will gather here."

The dungeon is a model garden.

What can mortals do and where can they reach in this model garden that has been created?

"If Arirnan desires, he can give trials to mortals who come to the dungeon with interest. And if he really likes them, he can even make a direct contract with them as a apostle."

[Not particularly interested in the apostle contract, but... it might be fun.]

Arirnan muttered to himself, his eyes filled with curiosity.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The dungeon created by the transcenders. It's bound to be difficult. And those with sufficient talent will gather, and their struggles will surely be entertaining for us. But then, what will you offer in return?"

"A realm created like that. In itself."

"What?"

"It's a contract. I'll grant the wish of whoever conquers the dungeon. No matter what the wish may be. Even if they want the dungeon itself."

[……You.]

Arilnan was shocked. She finally realized what the man was after.

If the man's words came true, the dungeon would be the man's empty realm in itself.

Giving such a realm meant...

[……Ha, haha, haha! I see what you mean!]

Arilnan laughed like a madwoman. If another transcender had seen that scene, they would have been shocked. Arilnan was one of the oldest transcenders in the universe, and it was extremely rare for her to show such a strong emotion.

But Arilnan couldn't help but laugh. The man's words had a profound meaning. She muttered, her eyes brimming with tears.

"You're planning to artificially create a transcender, aren't you?"
