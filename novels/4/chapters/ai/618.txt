**Chapter 619**

**619. The Outer Story, The Magician of the Labyrinth (2)**

The God of Cycles, Arilnan.

One of the most powerful gods in this world. His power surpasses that of Rakiratas, who controls two concepts.

And, excluding those who were transcendents from birth, he was also one of the oldest gods. At least, that's what he knew.

He was a being worthy of respect, even for men. Arilnan chuckled at his appearance.

[You seem to be worried.]

"There's no need to hide it. You know, don't you?"

[The rumor has already spread among the transcendents.]

"That's right."

The man smiled wryly. It was inevitable that the story would come out among the transcendents, considering how much he had been around.

"Then, Arilnan, do you know what state I'm in?"

The man asked, but he didn't have high expectations. Even Arilnan wouldn't know about his current state, he thought.

So, the man's eyes widened at Arilnan's response.

[I know. I've seen a few transcendents like you.]

"......What? You've seen it?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not often, but it does appear from time to time. You don't think you're special, do you? Well, if you're a transcendent being, it's not strange to think that way."

Arirnan chuckled and said with a playful tone. The man didn't particularly deny it.

"No transcendent being who met me knew about my state."

"I'm very old. It's extremely rare for someone like you to exist. Even if others don't know, it's not strange."

"Derisha didn't know, did she?"

"Those who were transcendent beings from birth are like that. They're not interested in worldly affairs. What's important is their own concept. But beings like you and me weren't transcendent from birth."

They were mortal beings.

They had something they desired and eventually gained control over that concept.

"An imperfect being became close to perfection. That's why there are sometimes cases like yours."

Arirnan murmured quietly.

"Is it emptiness? I haven't seen it in a long time."

"What is this?"

Arirnan gave him the answer he had been longing for.

"I don't know what to say. I don't have a clear concept either. But I think of it as a disease."

"A disease?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The man's face was puzzled.

"Isn't a transcendent being someone who solves such problems?"

[Generally, that's true. So, I also find it hard to express it. But... the more I think about it, the more I think it's correct to call it a disease.]

The man quietly listened to Arirnan's words.

Arirnan continued speaking softly.

"What did you live for?"

"......For adventure."

He wanted to explore the unknown. He wanted to know everything. He wanted to know the mysteries.

So, he dedicated his entire life to knowing them.

He traveled the universe, going on adventures to learn many things. He didn't form bonds with anyone. Only adventure. He lived for that alone.

In the end, he finally reached his goal.

He knew the unknown, knew everything, and realized the mysteries.

His adventure had come to an end.

And at that moment, the man also realized something.

What he had been seeking no longer existed.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Most transcenders are like you, living their entire lives for their own desires. They abandon everything and focus solely on their desires. In the end, they reach their desires and dominate them."

"This is the most common case of becoming a transcender."

"The man also reached that point in a similar way."

"[Usually, those who reach that point feel a sense of satisfaction. But very rarely, there are transcenders who feel emptiness instead.]"

"……It seems I'm in a similar situation."

"[Either you settle into the position you've aimed for, or you lose your purpose and wander. You seem to be the latter.]"

"Is the reason unknown?"

"[I don't know either. Is it because of the values or emotions from when I was a mortal, or is it because of the concept I've dominated myself with?... I don't know that far.]"

The man realized the reason for his emptiness.

He had sought adventure.

He had lived his entire life solely for that.

And ridiculously, at the moment he reached the end of that adventure, there was no longer anything he aimed for.

The man also realized that there was no solution to this problem.

"……How did other transcenders resolve this?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I don't know. There are people who live their whole lives with that emptiness. Some have lost contact. Maybe they found another way... or maybe they collapsed on their own."

"Is that so."

The man smiled bitterly. It meant that there was no solution in the end.

"I'm sorry. I only had expectations and ended up disappointing..."]

"No. I understand the reason, so it's enough. It's a disease. It's only natural to call it that."

The emptiness that arises when one reaches transcendence. It wasn't strange to call it a disease.

Then, how should one solve this disease?

...The answer didn't come out.

* * *

This emptiness was because he became the God of Adventure.

Ironically, it was because he achieved what he had wanted his whole life. He felt emptiness because he lost his goal.

Then, how should one solve this? The answer didn't come out easily.

The first thing that came to mind was to watch over his apostles. He had a few apostles too. They were people who had faithful beliefs and loved adventure.

Was he satisfied by watching over them?

...No. It had no meaning. He was the God of Adventure. He knew everything about the adventures his apostles would embark on and what kind of ending they would meet.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not a particularly enjoyable task for him. Adventure is an exploration of the unknown.

He thought and thought about it.

In the end, he recalled a separate existence.

"The Ancient Ones."

Beings who existed before the universe came into being.

The Ancient Ones.

Many things about them were unknown. What kind of existence they were, what they wanted, what their power was - he didn't know.

If he were to approach the Ancient Ones, he might be able to regain his sense of adventure.

The problem was, the Ancient Ones didn't particularly like transcendents. In fact, it was suicidal. And it was a very gruesome form of suicide.

But the man laughed.

Suicidal behavior? What's the problem with that? From the start, his adventure was suicidal behavior itself.

Knowledge and information about the unknown were worth more than his own life.

"But it's not very appealing."

He disliked the Ancient Ones. It was just an instinctual aversion.

So, what should he do?

The man thought deeply about it.

The answer to his thoughts still didn't come.

* * *

What he wanted was adventure.

An exploration of the unknown."

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

But he is the God of Adventure. There is no longer anything in this universe that can satisfy his sense of adventure.

As he was passing the time idly, he felt someone's presence in his temple.

He turned his gaze to confirm, and saw a young child standing in his temple.

There was no need to wait; the child had directly approached him. The child, who had been searching around the temple, trembled with fear at the god's majestic presence and knelt down.

"Ah, God!"

"What's going on."

"Ah, God, I've come to answer the question you asked and grant your wish!"

"……."

He had told mortals in the past that if they answered his question, he would grant their wish. But he himself had forgotten. Such a thing had existed.

The child, still trembling, opened their mouth.

"I, I don't know the details, but what if we go back to the beginning?"

"It's the beginning. But that means nothing to me now. It's just a small thing to me."

"Then what if we scale it up?"

The man paused.

The child spoke quickly, as if seizing an opportunity.

"Wow! Let's make it huge! Let's make that beginning huge! Then won't something happen? ……Or maybe not."

The child suddenly lost confidence and hung his head in disappointment.

But the man sensed something in the child's words.

"......It's going to be fun, isn't it?"

"Yes, it is!"

"There's value in trying."

The man's eyes began to quietly sparkle.

The child's wish was simple.

The happiness of his family.

So the man used his power to grant that happiness.

The child's family would succeed in all their adventures and achieve their desires.

After that, the man returned to his domain and thought.

"First."

What was the first adventure he had?

He could recall it clearly. It was a dungeon near his home. When he was still a young boy, he had entered the nearby cave out of curiosity. And he got trapped there.

That place was a trap called a dungeon.

A long time ago, a dark wizard had created it as a hellish pit of despair.

There were countless monsters and traps blocking his way.

But the man survived in there.

After three years, he finally reached the end of the dungeon and succeeded in conquering it.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

"After that, he felt a strong desire for adventure.

It was the beginning of his becoming the God of Adventure.

Although it was a distant memory, he could recall it vividly, as if it were yesterday.

"The Dungeon."

A labyrinth, a maze. A closed space.

That was the starting point of his adventure.

"The Dungeon Master."

And the owner of that dungeon, the Dungeon Master.

He decided to create his own dungeon.

Of course, he had tried it before, but he didn't feel any excitement and gave up quickly.

But this time, it's different.

This time, he's really going to do it with all his might.

He's willing to risk everything to make it happen.

He won't stop halfway like he did before, saying it's not fun.

The man felt a spark of interest for the first time in a long while.

What should he create?

And what could he create?

He is the God of Adventure.

What kind of dungeon could he create, putting everything on the line?

He didn't know what would be at the end, but at least he could erase the current sense of emptiness."
