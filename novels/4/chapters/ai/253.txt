254.

254. Ma-gye (3)

"If so, I'll ask for your help."

Tae-san accepted. Annetsa smiled and began to explain.

"As you've felt while using it, black magic is a power that summons the strength of demons."

Annetsa waved her hand. The dark wind of Seyr's sword formed on her hand.

The dark wind gathered and took the shape of a bird. Annetsa gently extended her hand. The bird made of wind flew into the sky, as if it were alive.

"Do you know what kind of being a demon is?"

"I know a little."

He had heard it from a yurei before. They are weaker than gods, but they are strong from the moment they fly. They are under the control of the devil, using black magic to lend them strength, but they are not gentle beings.

"Yes. We summon a part of the power handled by demons. As we use it, the power grows stronger, but it's clear that there's a limit. Tae-san, if you have any black magic, could you tell me one?"

"Decarabia's distorted vegetation."
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan said one black magic spell. Annetsha's eyes widened in amazement.

"Distorted vegetation... one of the black magic spells held by those who guard the palace... You're using that, aren't you? Have you ever tried to use it to its fullest extent?"

Taesan nodded his head. The distorted vegetation was a black magic spell he often used.

"What's its power like?"

"It's at a decent level."

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly impressive either. Taesan could have shattered and destroyed everything and advanced with ease if he were at his level.

"You say it's at a decent level because Taesan-nim can't fully harness the power of black magic. If you handle it properly, even Taesan-nim wouldn't be able to block it easily."

"Ah."

Taesan's eyes lit up.

If what she said was true, it meant that the power of black magic had increased exponentially.

"What kind of concept is this?"

"Black magic is mostly summon-type. We create a channel to summon the power of demons. However, the channel we create is too weak and insufficient for the power of demons to pass through, so we can only summon a fragment of it."
Here is the translation of the text:

As I thought about it, I found that the contents were written on the distorted vegetation.

[The demon, Dekarabia, summons the vegetation that it deals with. It seems that it can only summon the fragments of the roots that have swallowed stars.]

It can only summon the fragments of the roots that have swallowed stars. I thought that the problem would be solved by increasing the skill level, but it seemed that there was a fundamental issue that was different from that.

"That's why we're going to strengthen the channel itself. We need to weave it tightly and implement it firmly to make the demon's power as strong as possible. We can summon it as close as possible to its own essence."

"What about the channel itself?"

"Not difficult."

Annetsha waved her hand. A black wind arose. The color and power of the wind were darker than what the Great Mountain could handle.

"This is the kind of thing."

A complex spell of magic was revealed at the place where the wind arose.

"Why don't you try it? Even the Great Mountain can do it."

The demon's magic.

But the Great Mountain couldn't do it.

"How do you deal with magic?"

"Ah?"

Annetsha was startled.

"You've been dealing with black magic so far? If you look at it that way, you can understand."

"I don't know. I just consumed magic and dealt with it."

(Note: The translation may not be perfect, but I've done my best to provide an accurate translation. If you have any further requests or corrections, please let me know!)
Here is the translation of the text:

"...Is that so?"

Anne was unable to understand Taesan's words. It meant that there was a fundamental difference between them.

Kuandè quietly observed and then intervened.

"Perhaps I need to explain. Your Highness, I went down to a labyrinth created by the gods and goddesses. And that place is governed by a system, you know."

"What system?"

"Yes. If you can obtain power through skills, you can use it naturally even if you don't know the rules or methods. I once used an unusual technique to chase away the hand that was about to destroy the village. You can think of it like that."

"...That's really amazing."

It's amazing that you can use power without understanding it. Anne found it hard to accept. Kuandè looked at Taesan.

"This is probably faster if I explain it. Can you handle magic?"

"Yes."

"In the case of magic, it's okay if you don't understand. The system of the labyrinth has already set the rules for its use, so the skills you've been handling are similar too."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Skill and magic. Both had a fixed effect. The key was to use them at the right timing."

"However, dark magic was different."

Dark magic was a type that summoned the power of demons, unlike magic. It required mastering the art of creating a conduit to harness that power.

To do so, one had to perfectly control one's magic.

Tai Shan summarized his words and closed his eyes.

He sensed the power lurking at the bottom, and began to explore his inner self.

However, he didn't feel any unusual sensations. He knew that something was lodged deep within, but he didn't know how to handle it.

He explained this, and Quanede scratched his cheek.

"You're human, aren't you?"

The wings were meant for birds. Even if they suddenly grew on a human, without knowing how to utilize them, they couldn't fly.

Even if one knew how to utilize them, it wouldn't change anything. The human body was specialized for walking and running, and its structure made it impossible to fly.

Magic was the same. Magic was meant for demons. Tai Shan, as a human, had obtained power as a subordinate of the mysterious, but using it was a separate issue.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I think I have to force my way through, don't I?"

If so, it would be possible to change the structure to make it suitable for dealing with the magic. "Your Highness."

"Uh, I didn't understand it well, but I think it's okay to do it like we do with children, right?"

Annetsha and Kwaned approached Taesan and placed their hands on his back.

"What are you going to do?"

"There are very few people among the demons who can deal with magic, but there are some who are blocked. Generally, adults would pull out the magic and force a path through for them."

Kwaned said this with a serious face.

"I don't know how humans would react, but let's try it first. Keep quiet and observe from the inside."

Taesan closed his eyes.

Annetsha and Kwaned pulled out their magic.

"Hmm."

"Uh...".

Their magic flowed into Taesan.

It was a strange feeling to have someone else's power enter from the inside. The magic began to swirl and descend deep into his body.

"Hmm?"

Annetsha and Kwaned's faces stiffened.

They had inserted their own magic into Taesan's body. They were creating a channel for his magic to flow towards.
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan had many abilities within his body, each occupying its own space.

And Mugi was the lowest and deepest of them all, a force that was.

As they descended to find the way, they were able to feel Taesan's powers overall.

The sensation they felt was immense.

Mugi was like a tiny boat drifting on the ocean, unable to even be grasped, let alone measured.

"This is..."

Annetsa was shocked.

It was on a level beyond the mortal realm.

Quaned gritted his teeth. Breaking through was not an easy task, but as a Quaned-level demon, he could break through even if there were tens of thousands of people in a day.

However, this was too immense.

In this vast place, even creating just one path was exhausting.

Annetsa and Quaned gritted their teeth and inserted Mugi. Then Taesan closed his eyes and observed the deep Mugi.

The two's magic felt like it was piercing the inside.

Although it was a weak force, it was definitely heading towards Taesan's internal organs.

However, it was still lacking.

If it was that weak, it would disappear before reaching Taesan's magic.

So Taesan had to assist.
Here is the translation of the text:

Maqi was stuck deep inside, like adhesive.

Taisan began to touch it.

Slowly but surely, Taisan dispersed the waves above the surface, like stirring a spoon.

Maqi, stuck like adhesive, began to loosen slightly.

At that moment, Taisan gathered its internal strength and slapped Maqi away.

Maqi exploded and jumped up. The thing that was hidden deep below suddenly shot up to the top.

"Ugh!"

Arensha instinctively jumped back in alarm.

A massive Maqi, like a tidal wave, tried to engulf her strength.

She was frightened and tried to run away, but then she regained her composure and connected with Maqi.

A weak but certain path was formed.

"[Maqi's mastery of black magic has increased by 1%.] [A passageway has been obtained.]"

At the same time, Arensha and Quaned retreated.

"Crack!"

"Hmm, hmm."

Quaned was bleeding. Arensha's face was pale and her hands were shaking.

"Are you okay?"

"It's fine."

Arensha smiled wryly.

"Taisan, you're really a monster."

(Note: I translated the text as accurately as possible, but some parts may require further clarification or context to fully understand the story.)
Here is the translation of the text:

It seemed like I had done something wrong, so Tai Shan handed me a vitality-restoring potion.

"Oh, it's been a long time."

Qwaneed drank the potion with a delighted face. His complexion improved slightly.

[You have activated the regenerative area.]

"Let me rest for a bit. I'll handle the carriage."

Although I couldn't handle it earlier, I now know how to make the carriage move.

After finishing our meal, Tai Shan got on the carriage and touched the wall, releasing magic.

The carriage began to run at a fast speed.

Remembering the sensation just now, Tai Shan opened the skill window.

[Black Magic] [Mastery: 40%] [You can manipulate black magic. You can use black magic by consuming magic. The effect of black magic can be pulled to a certain extent depending on the amount of magic consumed. It is a realm where you can fully utilize the true power of black magic.]

The mastery of black magic has reached 40%.

It seemed that reaching 40% was a condition for breaking through the path.

At the same time, I obtained a few auxiliary skills like magic.
Here is the translation of the text:

"[Implementation of Channel] [Proficiency: 1%] [Using magic to pass through the devil's power, I attempted to implement a channel. However, it seems I haven't made a proper channel yet.]

As the saying goes, 'seeing is believing,' Taesan decided to use magic directly.

Ugh.

Magic was implemented on Taesan's hand.

It was a completely new, unfamiliar sensation, unlike mana.

Taesan recalled the way Arnetsha handled magic and followed the same procedure to open the channel.

A strange, ominous feeling emanated from beyond the channel.

He gazed at it.

At the same time, the devil's power burst forth.

[You have activated the Zone Detection of the Leraji.]

Zone Detection.

A dark magic that reads everything and provides information within a certain range.

The range was decent, but the information was too limited. I had never handled it because it was too difficult to grasp.

However, this time was different.

The tremors and scent of the plants touched by Zone Detection. The bloodlust of the demons as they clashed and devoured each other. The gusts of wind and their direction.

It was as if I could see everything with my eyes, and Zone Detection allowed me to perceive every detail.

It felt like I was surveying the entire world.

"This is...""

Here is the translation of the text:

It was a new sensation. Tai Shan had implemented the passage again, accompanied by a sigh.

As the existence beyond the passage recognized Tai Shan, a surge of power emerged.

[You have activated the distorted vegetation of Dekarabia.]

Kuku-kuku-kung!

The vegetation of Dekarabia was a skill that had grown multiple roots, filling the surrounding space. However, this time it was different.

A giant root was rising, like a planet-sized root stuck in the middle of the sky, rough and wild.

Annetsha was shocked.

"Ah? So massive?"

Annetsha had seen the master of distorted vegetation of Dekarabia before. They were also capable of creating passages like Tai Shan.

However, neither the size nor the power was comparable to Tai Shan's.

"This size... is..."

Not just a part of the root.

The core of the root. It could have been summoned as a whole.

Tai Shan had created the root.

It was solid.

Definitely not easily crushable by his power, with its hardness and strength.

"Good."

Tai Shan laughed.

* * *

The newly acquired dark magic power was strong.
Here is the translation of the text:

"At a glance, it seemed impossible to match the intermediate magic, excluding the intermediate magic. However, it was equally clear that it had its downsides.

"'Consumed mana is greater than expected.'

Mana was consumed excessively in the implementation of the tunnel. Although I used only two black magic spells, my mana was almost depleted.

"'And the delay is also long.'

It seemed that the implementation of the tunnel itself took a significant amount of time, whether it was because I was not familiar with it or if it was naturally the case.

"This made it quite difficult to use during battles.

"In addition, it required a considerable amount of concentration, making it difficult to implement during battles. However, it was not a problem for Taesan.

"[Special permanent activation skill: Mind separation] [Proficiency: 4%] [I can see, do, and think about many things at the same time. Its limits are still unclear.]

Thanks to the mind separation skill, which allows me to do many things at once, I was able to implement the tunnel while doing other things.

However, it also had its limitations. When facing an enemy that required me to risk my life, I didn't think I would have the time to create a tunnel during the battle.

"'And.'

The gaze towards Taesan when I opened the tunnel with black magic."
Here is the translation of the text:

Perhaps it was the devil's gaze. Until now, I had only pulled out scraps, so I couldn't feel it, but now he was actually handling the devil's power properly.

They began to realize the truth about the High Mountain.

As a being beneath the god, the ghost said, "They are not gentle existences." "There's no good thing that can be done to attract attention," it said.

However, even if they took on that risk, it was a sufficiently remarkable change. I was curious about how it would change in the case of the dark wave of Marbas.

After excluding meal and rest time, the High Mountain continued to practice implementing the tunnel. Although the mana was decreasing rapidly, since it was a demon, the recovery speed was also fast, so there was no major problem with the practice.

"'I should have taught you later, though……'"

Annetha muttered to herself, unable to have a conversation with the High Mountain due to their gratitude.

Quanede spoke with a nonchalant tone.

"Just go and talk to them, okay?"

"No, it would be a disturbance."

"It's true, Your Highness. You're quite annoying."

"Shh."

The carriage moved silently forward.

And they arrived at the Demon King's Palace.
