13. 1st Floor, Chamber of Secrets (8)

If he doesn't reveal the location of the Goddess, he will continue to live in despair. He will disappear without ever finding what he truly desires until the end.

If he discloses it, Ainz Ooal Gown will find the location of Lebinenov. He would feel immense gratitude towards Taisan and would be willing to do anything for him.

However, what happens next is unpredictable.

Once Ainz Ooal Gown discovers Lebinenov, there's also the possibility of him becoming hostile. There's ample chance that the Goddess might dislike him.

Being a fanatic, he wouldn't even think twice about prioritizing between the Goddess and Taisan. Perhaps he might even suspect and attack him as the one who killed the Goddess. All possibilities are on the table.

Someone stronger than Taeyeon Lee. An NPC who cannot guarantee victory as he did before.

If he were to become hostile towards him, it would pose a major obstacle in breaking through the labyrinth.

"......"

Taisan, who was lost in thought for a moment, spoke.

Ainz Ooal Gown had done a lot for him. A high-level magic item. A ring of attack power. They were far too much to give to a stranger he had just met.
He must respond to him.

"Do you want to know the location of Lebinenov, the beloved Goddess?"

"Yes, finding her is my purpose."

"I know where she is."

"What?"

Ainzhar's face twitched.

"I know where Lebinenov is."

"...Are you joking?"

Ainzhar frowned uncomfortably. He clearly did not believe Taisan's words.

"I have searched the entire labyrinth myself but couldn't find her. How could you possibly know her location on the 1st floor?"

The trust from earlier vanished, replaced by discomfort on his face. It was a natural reaction. From Ainzhar's perspective, Taisan was a newcomer who had just entered the labyrinth. It would be unbelievable for him to have found what Ainzhar himself hadn't discovered over many years.

Taisan had thought about this as well.

"In my world, there are items related to labyrinths."

"Nonsense. Labyrinths don't have maps or anything."

"You might know. Not maps of the entire labyrinth, but maps of specific entities within."

"..."
Without hesitation, Taisan met Ainzhar's gaze, silencing him. Soon, Ainzhar's pupils dilated.

"...A flute that calls the gods? Is that from your world?"

"Yes."

Although in reality, it was different. Taisan nodded.

"An item that reveals the locations of each god. It's something obtainable in the labyrinth."

"How could you possibly..."

"My family possessed information about it. We had already mapped out the locations of the listed gods."

Of course, it was a lie.

There was no such information about the labyrinth in his world.

What he was talking about was the information that Lee Tae-yeon had given him.

A flute that calls the gods. Its effect is to locate the gods. It was an item Lee Tae-yeon had obtained on the 89th floor.

However, she couldn't use the item. Most of the gods mocked and ridiculed her and refused to help her.

As a result, the flute that calls the god of Ùˆ contains lot Even J his ? th
"78th floor. Grand Archive. The 24th secret chamber."

Ainzhar's eyes trembled.

"Levinnof is inside."

"...I see. So there's the Grand Archive there. I haven't checked there yet...."

When Taisan revealed the floor and what was there, Ainzhar seemed to gain confidence in his words. Joy flickered in his eyes.

"Yes! That's the place!"

"I suppose that's enough of a reward."

"Haha! More than enough! It overflows!"

Ainzhar exploded with laughter, grabbing Taisan's shoulder.

"I'm truly grateful! I've never felt gratitude like this towards anyone else! You're my benefactor!"

There was madness in his eyes. Taisan dismissed his fanatic emotions and said calmly:

"My shoulder hurts."

"Oh, sorry. I couldn't control my emotions for a moment."

Ainzhar stepped back with a grin.

"Are you planning to leave right away?"

"Hmm... that might be tough. The 78th floor is deep. It's a dangerous place for me too, so I'll need to prepare adequately before going."
Still, Ainzhar's face was energetic. Now he could find his goal. That alone would be enjoyable.

"Once again, I sincerely thank you. No, it's difficult to express this in words. I want to repay you somehow..."

Ainzhar scratched his head. He couldn't give something too valuable. He risked becoming complacent and arrogant, increasing the likelihood of losing his life.

But in his view, Taisan had given him too much for something insignificant, worthless to him. After desperate deliberation, Ainzhar made a decision.

"If you're as skilled as you seem, it should be fine. Accept this."

There was no reason to refuse giving. Taisan received an old ring without hesitation.

[Rusty Ring] [Stamina +20] [Appears to be a ring distributed to priests in some sect. Now, only one person possesses it after the sect's destruction.]

"Oh."

Taisan inwardly exclaimed. A single ring raised stamina by 20. In easy mode, this was a ring one might luckily acquire by reaching the 30th floor.

"Normally, I wouldn't think to give this to a 1st-floor adventurer... but you seem like an adventurer who won't become lazy. I hope my thoughts are not wrong."


"It'll be fine."

Taisan had already seen the outcome.

There was no time to become lazy.

Ainzhar grinned.

"That's fortunate. I'm truly grateful."

"Are you going down now?"

"I need to prepare too. I can't stay on the 1st floor any longer."

As if not wanting to delay any further, Ainzhar briskly headed towards the door. Before he left, he turned back and waved.

"Thank you! See you again!"

"Goodbye."

"Hahaha! Goddess! I'm going! I, who alone remembers you, I'm heading towards you!"

With laughter tinged with madness, Ainzhar departed.

Could he find the goddess? If he finds her, will she be a dead goddess or a living one?

Regardless, Ainzhar's journey had begun. It would take quite a long time until he met Taisan again.

Taisan raised his shield.

---

After sufficient rest, he began to break through the labyrinth. Taisan wandered through the 1st floor once more.
The big rats attacked him, but now it's not a problem. The reason it was difficult before was because of the lack of agility stats, which hindered his movements. Currently, Taisan's agility is 22. He could react generously.

He caught the big rats and absorbed their agility. When he raised agility by about 3 more points, a system message appeared.

["Your Spirit Rise has been triggered. The gap in power between you and your opponent's spirit is too large. You gained nothing from your opponent."]

"Hmm?"

Taisan paused to confirm the content. Then he realized.

"If the gap is too big, the rise stops."

Now, no matter how many big rats he catches, his agility won't increase. It was regrettable, but he had somewhat anticipated it. If he could gain endlessly without a gap, it would practically mean infinite grind.

He might be able to achieve agility figures in the hundreds only on the 1st floor. It's natural that the creator of the labyrinth would have blocked that level.

However, even with such limitations, the skill is still unreasonable. Increasing stats every time he defeats a monster. Honestly, it was better than any skill he had ever achieved.

As long as this skill exists, other players in solo mode will never be able to catch up with him, no matter how hard they try.
However, now his growth on the 1st floor had stopped. The amount of experience gained seemed to have stopped increasing at some point.

It was about time to slowly head towards the 2nd floor.

However, instead of finding the way down, Taisan started retracing his steps on the 1st floor. He carefully inspected each room and searched for passageways.

In the labyrinth, there were secret rooms.

Usually, there was one hidden on each floor, and finding them would yield great rewards to the discoverer.

Magic staves, rings of levitation, permanent stat boosting potions, and so on. These were items that provided great power in traversing the labyrinth.

Because only one person could enter, the competition was fierce.

Taisan had missed many secret rooms himself.

Due to relying more on luck and experience than skill, it couldn't be helped.

"I've only managed to enter about twenty rooms."

But this place is a solo mode.

No player exists here except for him.

In this place, he could obtain all the secret rooms.

"Could it be the same here?"

Although the maps of the labyrinth differed in difficulty, their basic structure was the same. There were distinctive features in rooms where secret rooms were hidden.

"Here it is."

As Taisan wandered around, he arrived at a room.
The room had no peculiar connections. There was only one door through which one could enter, and inside was an empty room devoid of anything.

A room without a purpose. A room everyone ignored and passed by.

In such a place, there was a secret room.

* * *

Taisan inspects the walls.

They are moss-covered bricks no different from any other room.

The floor and ceiling weren't notably different either.

In such cases, the probability of it being a room found by touching the bricks was high.

"Looks like it's going to be manual labor."

Taisan began examining the nearby bricks without changing his expression.

Pressing, turning, pulling them out.

And if there was no change, he moved on to the next brick.

At least ten seconds passed like this.

There are hundreds of bricks in the room. Each one needs to be checked like this.

It's a mind-numbing level of boredom, but Taisan enjoyed it.

"This should be good enough."

The labyrinth has outcomes based on actions. Manual labor isn't much different. There were rooms he endured for a week without finding anything among the secrets he searched for. Thinking back on those times, now felt like heaven.

The same actions repeated countless times. Taisan checked each brick meticulously without changing his expression.

And around halfway through.
"I found it."

[Proficiency in Perception has increased by 5%.]

Drururuk.

The brick went deep. Nearby bricks followed suit, concealing their appearance in response.

Following was a small passage.

This is indeed the secret room.

[You have discovered the secret room.] [Received the title [Adventurer].] [You have discovered the secret room for the first time. Intelligence permanently increased by 3.]

With the Adventurer title that raises Intelligence by 1 and the initial discovery bonus, that's a total increase of 4. Just that alone made the manual labor worthwhile.

And there was a separate main dish. As Taisan entered the secret room, a passage of suitable length appeared. At the end of it lay a single box.

That's the reward.

Since there was nothing in the passage, it seemed like one could just run and obtain it.

"That can't be true."

Since Itaeyeon didn
Taisan stepped outside. As he wandered through the maze, it didn't take long before he encountered a Big Rat.

"Krik, Kik!"

He stamped and subdued the charging Big Rat with his foot. His agility was now 25. Capturing the Big Rat was no longer a difficult task.

Taisan returned to the secret room with the subdued Big Rat. He then threw it towards the empty passage.

Click.

With a pressing sound, an arrow sliced through the air.

"Kik!"

The Big Rat screamed as it fell down. Its struggling body soon ceased.

"An arrow trap."

True to the first floor's nature, it was a textbook trap. It activated when stepped on, and judging by the single arrow shot, it didn't seem overly challenging.

Taisan stepped where the Big Rat had fallen.

Thud.

An arrow flew towards Taisan's chest. He swiftly moved his hand.

Clack.

The arrow landed in Taisan's hand.

He could handle at least one.

He continued walking.

Thunk!

He caught two arrows aimed at his head and chest simultaneously.

Two weren't a big problem. He stashed the arrows in his inventory and took another step forward. This time, three arrows flew towards him.
Two were caught, and one was dodged by wetting the head.

"Getting tougher as we go."

The distance to the box was roughly ten steps.

Finally, ten arrows flew simultaneously. As the distance was closer, dodging became more difficult.

But that's by normal player standards.

Currently, Taisan's agility is 25. He could handle arrows shot in a regular manner. Even ten arrows weren't impossible to avoid if he used his skills and focused solely on evasion.

So, he thought about grabbing what he could before that happened.
