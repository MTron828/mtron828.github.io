260. Saint of the Old Ma Shin (Part 1)

"What, what do you desire!"

"Thorns. And tell me the location of the saint guarding that place."

The demon started babbling nervously.

Taesan released his grip after memorizing every detail.

*Click, click!*

"Get lost."

"...Is it really true?"

"I said I would spare you. Do you wish to be killed?"

"No."

The demon hastily shook its head and fled.

"Good."

The location was identified. Approximately a month's journey north from here.

Considering the demon's pace, Taesan could arrive much earlier.

Before heading towards the thorns, Taesan opened the hidden system window.

[Your spiritual enhancement has been activated.] [Proficiency in Twisted Spiritual Adjustment has increased by 8%.] [Obtained special continuous activation skill [Cradle Established in the Abyss].]

Though not incredibly strong, he had captured many, significantly boosting his proficiency in spiritual adjustment and gaining a new skill.
Here is the translated text:

[Special Passive Skill: Cradle in the Abyss] [Proficiency: 1%] [Those who live in the deep and dark places recognize it as a sanctuary and gain strength from it. While within the domain of the ancient gods, they can draw upon its power. Currently, this effect is very weak and seems to affect the mind when drawing upon its strength.]

The demons here, having survived for an unimaginable amount of time in the forsaken land, have lost their lifespan and become bound to the earth.

It seemed to be a skill that could be used at will. As an experiment, gathering the power spread across the earth began to adhere to the Taesan.

"Hmm."

As the power was drawn, the body seemed to twist. It began to change strangely from the depths of the mind.

"It seems difficult to use."

If not controlled properly, it would completely break down like them.

However, if used appropriately, it could enhance one's power and strength. It was not a bad skill.

"Ah, found it!"

Squish.

Stamping their foot, they crush the head of the demon shouting in joy.

[You have activated the wings of a perfect fairy.]

Wings spread out.

[You have activated the deer walking the windy path.]

And the wind envelops the body.

It would take a day to reach the distance of the thorn. The plan was to fly in a direction where minimal force was used.

"Minerva. Come along."
Whispering quietly, the demon flew toward the direction indicated. Minerva felt her chasing closely at high speed.

The scenery began to change rapidly. Demons who had been shouting towards Mount Taesan suddenly glanced at it as it swiftly passed by, then hurriedly regained their composure and tried to follow.

However, the more they pursued, the farther the distance seemed to grow. Minerva, following closely behind, clicked her tongue.

"Too fast. I can't keep up properly either."

"Hehe."

Annette, in her arms, tightened her grip on Minerva's hand with a pale, frightened face.

Minerva's speed was like a storm. Even passing by, weak demons were torn apart.

Yet the distance continued to widen. Despite controlling her power to avoid an abrupt recall, as a spirit queen herself, she couldn't catch up.

"As a queen, I can't afford to cry."

Minerva gritted her teeth and pushed her body forward.

Mount Taesan accelerated.

The demons tried to capture him, but it was futile. Every time the wind swept down from Mount Taesan, they burst apart.
The fingers still numbered five more. However, they did not appear to be aiming for anything.

It was possible to guess where and what they were doing.

And so, a week passed.

Taesan arrived at the destination.

* * *

"It really was a thorn."

A massive jet-black thorn was stuck into the ground.

Thorns as tall as mountains exuded a palpable force even from afar.

"...A rift in the sky of the Earth."

Although the total amount of sensed power was overwhelming, the emanation felt strangely familiar in some indescribable way.

"Whew. Master."

Minerva, who arrived late, catches her breath. Anetsha collapses, panting heavily.

"Uh, ugh."

"Are you okay?"

"No..."

Anetsha squats down, trying to gather herself.

Barcaza, arriving even later than them, complains.

"[Isn't this too quick? If the king hadn't lent his power, I'd still be far away.]"

"Well, I adjusted for you guys, didn't I?"

If Minerva had really sped up, she would have been instantly teleported.

Barcaza grunted.

"[Truly a monster.]"

"Now what are we going to do?"
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"First of all... I have to approach. And take care of the guys in front too."

Ahead of the thorns, numerous demons were waiting.

Among them, there were five particularly strong demons. One of them looked at Taesan and proudly said,

"Look. Was I right? You eventually came this way? Is there any reason to run around with sore feet?"

"Hmm... That's true. I was skeptical, but you were right."

A woman holding a rapier approached with a smile.

"I am the second finger who worships the proud and great god. Just curious, have you met the other fingers?"

Taesan nodded.

The woman's smile grew wider.

"But coming here means you've defeated them all, right? Good. Very good. With this, I can become the first finger."

She chuckled.

"Now even the great god will take an interest in me!"

"Is that so?"

Taesan casually drew his sword.

The woman twirled her rapier.

"You must be strong. So you must have fought and defeated the other fingers. But they're not weak either."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

Her eyes narrowed sharply.

"She's not showing it, but she must have expended a lot of energy, right? Avoiding fights with demons all the way here would have taken another great effort."

Taesan realized what the woman and the other demons were aiming for and waiting for here.

She tapped her foot happily.

"I've succeeded in gambling!"

Another finger aimed at Taesan. And Taesan knocked it down.

In the process, Taesan, tired from coming all the way here with injuries, was targeted.

"They're like hyenas."

All the demons gathered here were aiming for it.

Except for the fingers, the demons probably came to bet on the possibility that the fingers might lose. That was to kill Taesan, who had become empty.

"Call as you like. The important thing is to win."

The woman revealed this.

"So die!"

The woman rushed in. It was a very impatient posture, perhaps to avoid being taken away by others.

Ping!

The rapier aimed at Taesan's head.

Taesan raised his hand.

Crash!
The wind howled, slapping against their faces. The woman's face trembled.

"Huh?"

Her rapier was caught by Taesan's fingers.

"Not a bad move. Nicely aimed."

But the premise was flawed.

Taesan hadn't weakened enough to be injured while facing her fingers.

Crunch.

"Oof."

Taesan's sword pierced the woman's chest. She coughed up blood and staggered back.

"Go to sleep!"

"I have no intention of prolonging this."

[You have activated Frozen World.] [You have activated Starlight Arrow.]

Biting cold engulfed the surroundings. The woman recoiled in fear, dodging narrowly.

Clang!

She narrowly avoided the clinging chill. Those nearby who couldn't evade froze instantly.

Taesan launched an arrow formed in his hand.

A glimmer fades nearby.

"Aaargh!"

The woman's body ignited. The other fingers suffered the same fate. Their abilities were too inadequate to fend off the attack.

In the midst of the light, Taesan rushed toward them.

His sword pierced their heart.

"Thud."
Confused fingers were all organized. Perhaps because they thought Mount Taesan had weakened and let their guard down, it was much simpler than before.

"Hyenas are all like this."

Mount Taesan, who had organized everything in an instant, turned his gaze.

He was inside a massive black wall. Beyond the wall, a powerful force was emanating.

Waves dispersed in all directions, creating a domain of ancient spirits.

And next to those thorns, he felt someone's presence.

"Distorted demons are now rushing in this direction. Please handle them."

"Got it."

[Understood, Master.]

"I'll do my best."

Mount Taesan entrusted the approach of the demons and approached the wall.

He placed his hand on the wall and exerted strength. With a thunderous noise, the wall shattered. Shards flew in all directions towards the thorns.

At that moment, darkness arose.

The shards flying towards the thorns were instantly swallowed up and disappeared.

"You're quite fierce."

A gentle voice echoed. It was a mild voice that seemed to have no connection with battle.

"These thorns were the last gift from our God. They cannot be touched by mere shards."

It was a man dressed in black clothing.
He had grown his hair long down to his neck, and his face was so frail that it couldn't kill even a single bug.

He smiled towards Mount Taesan and grasped his robe.

"Hello. You must be the strong one."

With bowed waist, he spoke softly.

"I am feeble in body, but I am Illyne, entrusted with the position of the saint of the great one."

"Pleased to meet you."

Taesan drew his sword. Illyne raised his hand as if about to rush forward.

"I do not oppose your actions. Eventually, you and I will fight. But before that, shall we have a brief conversation?"

Taesan looked at Illyne's face.

There was no hostility.

But for an immeasurable time, a being believed in by the ascetics couldn't be in his right mind. His expression couldn't be trusted, but Taesan sheathed his sword for now.

The saint of the ascetics wanted to talk.

And Taesan was curious too.

Illyne smiled gently.

"Thank you."

"What is it that you wish to discuss?"

"It's not difficult. It's quite straightforward."

He looked at Taesan and began to speak.
When I set foot here, the Almighty showed you a single emotion. Do you know what it was?

"It was greed."

Gosin showed greed to Taesan.

Ilarin nodded.

"That's odd."

Gosin is a perfect being from birth. Their power remains undiminished and mighty.

Even the Transcendents struggled to easily block the interference of the gods in the world.

Such an existence revealed greed to Taesan, a mortal.

Though Taesan is strong, compared to Transcendents or Immortals, he was undeniably weak. His potential was just that—potential, not yet realized.

It wasn't merely strength that showed him greed.

Something else, different from that.

"What do you think the Almighty desires from you? Why do you think they tried not to kill you?"

Ilarin spoke softly.

"You know the answer to that."

There was hardly anything to ponder.

What does Gosin desire from him?

It's not just simple power.

Among what he possesses, there was something that caught Gosin's attention.

The rise of a spiritual power.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The power gained from that effort.

And the boundary, created mixed with the divine."
