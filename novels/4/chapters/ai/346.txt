Chapter 347

347. 74th Floor, Battlefield of Immortals (1)

Tai Shan accepted Elriel's proposal.

The core of the Spirit King had great value to the spirits, but to Tai Shan, it was just a good material. If a corresponding reward was given, there would be no reason to refuse.

[I thank you for accepting the proposal. You are a contractor of Minerva.]

Elriel expressed his gratitude and slowly moved the spirit's soul and the Spirit King's core.

[There may be a brief shock. Please step back... You won't need to.]

Elriel turned back to Tai Shan.

[You may watch as you like. Then, everyone.] [Understood.]

The five Spirit Kings, including Minerva, gathered in front of Elriel.

Tai Shan, watching from behind, asked:

"So you're going to become the Fire Spirit King?"
Here is the translation of the text:

That will be difficult. The demon that has gone mad has obtained the power of the demon king by breaking free from the core of the demon king's power, but the demon king is not just a being of physical strength. The demon's current state is not very good.

The demon that has gone mad has sacrificed everything to harm the demon king of fire.

It was not possible to simply burn away life. There was a determination to abandon even one's soul and all that was left, so it was possible.

[However, it will consume a significant amount of energy to recover from this state. I am not worthy of the demon king's power.]

The demon's spirit and the demon king's core are slowly approaching each other, swirling together.

[It is to absorb the demon king's power and core. If you make a mistake, it could be dangerous, so focus.]

Kuuuung!

The two powers collide, and a ripple effect spreads.

A powerful energy bursts forth from the core. It was an energy that was extremely condensed and could not be underestimated.

[Let's begin.]

The demon kings gather their strength to restrain the outburst of power. The mountain is now experiencing a movement of power that is incomprehensible.

[Uuuuh... .]

The demon kings let out a sigh.

Their strength is undoubtedly strong, but it was clearly below that of the mountain. It was insufficient to restrain the power that arose from the collision.
Here is the translation of the text:

In that situation, Eriell displayed his strength.

A bright and warm light spread from within the tree.

The collision of power began to yield to an even stronger power, slowly merging and finding stability.

The mountain god opened his eyes.

Eriell was the strongest of the five spirit kings. It was clear that he was capable of directly displaying his strength.

"'The minimum of the immortal.'"

He was a spirit with power that transcended mortality. Even without the other four spirit kings, Eriell could easily suppress the explosion.

Kiying.

The two cores slowly merged into one.

The white turned into a red, and then into a dark gray.

[......That's it.]

Eriell had controlled his strength. The glow slowly faded away.

The spirit's restless soul regained its composure.

[Thank you. I am a contractor of Minerba. You're welcome for.......]

Eriell suddenly stopped speaking.

Hua!

The restless spirit's soul suddenly scattered in all directions.

The scattered soul spread throughout the spirit realm.

A quiet voice whispered from the soul passing by the mountain god's ear.

[Thank you.]

Note: The text appears to be a fantasy story, possibly from a novel or comic book. The translation is based on the context and grammar of the text, but some parts may be open to interpretation.
Here is the translation of the text:

After the spirit's outburst, it disappeared.

The only things left were the spirit kings and the power between them, a faint, grey energy.

"What's wrong?"

"No, it's not that."

Eriol slowly fluttered her wings.

"The fusion of powers has been successfully completed. However, the wayward spirit only retained enough power to sustain itself and abandoned the rest."

"Abandoned?"

It was as if the spirit had judged that it had achieved its desire and no longer had any regrets about the power it had abandoned, or perhaps it simply didn't want to be controlled by Vishnu's power, which had created it. The wayward spirit did not absorb the spirit kings' power.

As a result, the remaining power was left behind.

"Ah......" "This is..."

The spirit kings' eyes gleamed with desire.

It took a considerable amount of power to stabilize the wayward spirit. That's why they used the spirit king's core.

However, the power contained in the spirit king's core was not all that was needed.

The wayward spirit only took the minimum amount of power and abandoned the rest, leaving it behind.

As a result, a considerable amount of power remained here.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It seems to have turned out well."

Eriol said.

"This power is originally yours. Although you couldn't separate the power, you received it all because a lunatic spirit abandoned it, but if the spirit had abandoned it on its own, the story would be different. The remaining power is yours, the contract holder."

"That's right?"

Taisei gazed at the power and pondered for a moment.

How should he handle it? Taisei made a decision.

"Minerva, eat it up."

"Is it okay?"

"You need to get a little stronger."

Taisei's words made Minerva let out a pained expression. She couldn't argue with it. In fact, her power was significantly inferior compared to Taisei's.

"I guess I need to get stronger soon. Thank you."

She placed her hand on the remnants of the power.

The power was absorbed into her.

"Ugh..."

Minerva began to digest the power, exhaling slowly. The power emanating from her grew stronger.

Taisei, who had been watching her for a moment, asked Eriol:

"So, what happened to the lunatic spirit that abandoned it?"
Here is the translation of the text:

[Although I've revived my soul, recovery still requires time, you know. When I think the time has come, I will be reborn as a spirit here. Erriel said with a satisfied tone. Tai Shan also had a relatively good outcome. The mad spirit gave great help in defeating Vishnu. It's better to be in a normal state than to be in a broken state.]

[It seems that I'm looking forward to becoming a certain kind of spirit. Thank you for giving up your core as the Spirit King. I will respond with an answer that is not lacking, as well.]

Erriel fluttered his wings. A radiant light began to take shape in front of him, clustering and forming a figure.

[Take it. It's a power that can be wielded by a mortal being, within its limitations. You can use it to achieve what you want.]

[You have obtained the pure determination of light.]

As Erriel said, the determination of light was incredibly dense and powerful.

[However, even this is inferior to the core of the Spirit King. If you have something else in mind, please let me know. I will do my best to accommodate you.]

"Then..."

Tai Shan looked around inside the tree. The countless branches were entwined with flowers and leaves.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Can I take these materials away?"

These materials can be used as part of a partial world change. It was a chance that couldn't be missed.

After a moment of contemplation, Eriol soon agreed.

[Originally, it was forbidden, but I have been granted that much authority. As long as you take them in moderation, it's fine.]

"Thank you. Then can I take one more?"

[Please say.]

Tai Shan looked at Eriol with his mouth open.

"Can I fight with you?"

[What?] [Are you crazy?]

The spirit kings who had been watching with an air of detachment were shocked.

[Eriol is a spirit who has existed since the beginning of the spirit world. You can't even approach him as a human.]

The longer an existence, the stronger it is.

And this place was the spirit world. There was no limitation on the power of the spirits.

Eriol briefly looked at Tai Shan and nodded affirmatively.

[If you want to see it, it's fine. Come this way.]

* * *

The place Eriol brought Tai Shan to was a vast open field.
Here is the translation of the text:

This is a place where the gods fought a long time ago. After that, it became a dead zone. 

Tai Shan drew his sword.

Eriol has the power of an immortal being.

It's a huge experience to fight someone of that caliber without risking one's life. Tai Shan was not one to let such an opportunity slip away.

The gods who had come to watch said:

["Please go easy on her, Eriol. Minerva won't take kindly to her contractor getting hurt and doing nothing about it." "Oh, well..."]

Eriol looked at Tai Shan, who was taking a fighting stance, and said:

["It's not necessary."]

Light bursts forth. A radiant glow envelops the world, and everything begins to burn.

Tai Shan gathered all his strength.

He activated all his buffs and leapt into the air.

Power collides.

"Wahahahah!"

["What's this!"]

The gods who were watching were shocked. It was clear that Tai Shan was the one who was struggling. He wasn't putting up much of a fight and was focused solely on defense.

However, it's not that he was defeated by Eriol's power. He was managing to hold on.

The immortal being's power was being endured by a mortal body. He managed to shake off the overwhelming light and move.
[What's that.]

The spirit kings are at a loss for words.

It wasn't long before the battle was over. As Taesan began to reach his limit, Ariel gathered his strength.

"I guess this will do."

Taesan nodded, catching his breath.

It was a good experience. He had a rough idea of how to move and respond to opponents at the level of immortals.

Ariel said quietly, "You. You straddle the boundary."

"The boundary?"

"The boundary of mortality."

Not inside, not outside, but exactly in the middle.

That was Ariel's assessment of Taesan.

"Crossing that line is incredibly difficult... but it's amazing. I look forward to seeing what path you will take."

Afterwards, Taesan gathered various materials in the spirit world. As a result, he was able to obtain materials that could be used for partial world changes twice.

What he obtained was Minerva's reinforcement. Materials for partial world changes. Materials for equipment and battle experience with immortals.

Satisfied, Taesan returned to the labyrinth.
The first thing he did when he came back was to go to Hafran.

"This is...,"

Hafran, who accepted the pure crystal of light, looked blankly.

"...Where did you get this?"

"I got it from a spirit. Can you make it?"

"It's possible."

Hafran grumbled with a troubled look.

"It's the limit of the power I can handle. With this kind of material, what I can make is limited."

"Make it with the most useful one."

"Got it. It's going to take some time."

Hafran picked up a hammer.

Taesan left him and confirmed the reward on the 73rd floor.
[Shoes that leave footprints on every land.] [Attack +200] [Defense +500] [Strength +600] [Agility +600] [Action Speed +20%] [Movement Speed +20%] [A human wanted to leave their footprints on all the lands of the world. They started the challenge from the time they took their first steps, and achieved their wish the day before they died.] [Iron Wall Helmet] [Attack +150] [Strength +300] [Defense +400] [Magic Resistance +10] [A helmet made by compressing the iron wall itself, protecting the world.]

The rewards on the 73rd floor were overall high-quality equipment, especially the helmet which had both strength stats and magic resistance.

And now, the 74th floor begins.

After decades, or maybe even centuries of being blocked, Taesan finally reached the recently breakthrough floor.

[74th floor quest started.] [Obtain information from the battlefield of the immortals.] [Reward: ???] [Secret Reward: ???]

Upon reaching the 74th floor, there was nothing. In such cases, there was usually only one thing that happened.

Something would appear to give a quest.

The maze's bricks assembled and revealed the figure of Balbambba.

"You've come. You probably won't need to worry too much."

"Are you going to explain?"

"The 74th floor is a unique floor. The system alone cannot fully explain it, so I have to appear myself."

Balbambba spoke.

"The battlefield of the immortals. Countless immortals fought and died, and at the end, the abandoned land. Valhalluni. That is where you need to go to clear the 74th floor."
