Article 186

186. The Resolve (1)

Tae-san designates the vital spot on the horse and the horse immediately prioritizes defending that spot.

Tae-san sees this and takes a step back. His determination shoots towards the horse with great force.

The horse momentarily trembles.

It senses that Tae-san is targeting its weak point, which is located at the back of its neck. Therefore, it moves to protect its neck, and the designated vital spot is inadvertently exposed.

Tae-san seizes the opportunity.

"Psss."

He mutters to himself and retrieves his sword.

He adjusts his mental state through a conceptual skill. This is not limited by physical constraints. He simply decides to attack the horse's weak point and sends his intention to the horse.

Since nothing has directly affected the situation, there is no issue with the conditions for obtaining the resolve.

Tae-san designates the vital spot, manifests his intention to restrict the horse's actions, and then attacks.

The process repeats itself. The ghostly observer laughs mockingly.

[It's quite troublesome.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Just like the skills Taesan had obtained so far, this one was also extremely difficult to achieve.

First, a forced duel.

Conduct a duel against a large number of enemies, assuming only one opponent, and win.

Taesan used his paralysis arrow to suppress the crowd and quickly obtained it. However, this was only possible at a low level.

As you go down the level, you will encounter a large number of monsters at once, but this is not a common occurrence.

Even if you do encounter them, the number is so large that it's hard to count, or each one fully assists the others, making it impossible to ignore them.

At levels below a certain standard, the monsters themselves can resist paralysis and other states, making it difficult to ignore them. Therefore, it's essentially impossible to acquire this skill in the early stages.

Additionally, the condition to ignore attacks was also extremely demanding. Not only had to allow attacks, but also not lose any health, and even had to wear no defensive equipment.

Without a shield, this skill was unlearnable, and even with a shield, it was only possible to obtain it by minimizing damage as much as possible.

Note: Taesan appears to be a character in a game or story, and the text is describing a specific skill or ability that they are trying to obtain.
Here is the translation of the text:

Of course, the numerical value of the protection barrier has increased to the point where it can be easily obtained, but it's possible that it's not that simple.

However, the labyrinth does not easily give out skills. I thought that even if the numerical value of the protection barrier increases, there would be another constraint added.

And then, the skill that doubles the final damage.

It's a skill with an effect that's hard to believe. And its value increases as you descend into the labyrinth.

There was no skill other than perseverance that could be used to pull off a stunt like this. And even I, a ghost, was the same.

It was a condition that was almost impossible, something that no one would attempt, and yet I had to clear it to obtain an overwhelming skill.

The ghost remembered something.

"...the manager said that, didn't he?"

Skills are not created, but rather created when a certain condition is met and deemed suitable.

"Is the important thing creativity and imagination?"

The one who created this system is the mage of the labyrinth.

A person who directly approaches the gods and trades with them.
Here is the translation of the text:

With the help of their power, he had created such a vast space.

The old man wondered what kind of conditions the skills were acquired under, and he gradually began to grasp the situation.

Kaah!

"Seventy-seven."

The Tai Shan muttered to himself. He was almost there. If he hit it successfully just a few more times, he would succeed.

The knight stood still, as if thinking about something. Then, he suddenly rushed at Tai Shan again.

Tai Shan activated the "Quick Target" skill. The knight protected the designated area with his body, while Tai Shan, as usual, aimed at the nape of the neck with his intention.

A shivering sensation, the aura of death, swept over the knight's back.

However, the knight did not change his stance.

Kuuuung!

Tai Shan scowled. The knight, without protecting the exposed nape, slashed at Tai Shan with his sword.

As Tai Shan dodged the attack and retreated, he moved his intention again.

But this time, the knight seemed to have no intention of protecting his nape and continued to rush at Tai Shan with reckless abandon.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san realized. The general had no intention of defending his vital points. He was only trying to block Tae-san's attacks and counterattack.

However, Tae-san judged that it was impossible to completely dodge the general's attack and moved his sword.

Kaang!

The swords clashed.

It was as if they had started from the beginning. The ghost laughed maniacally.

[Is this just like a mad repetition like addition?]

In a sense, it was even more intense. The addition continued to repeat the same attack, but this time, the general had to put his heart and soul into both attacking and dodging.

"It doesn't matter."

Time was not important to Tae-san.

What was important was that he could gain something.

Tae-san designated his next target and charged again. The general, who had been defeated by Tae-san's attack, charged again, exposing his weaknesses.

Tae-san watched the general charging towards him. He read the trajectory of the general's sword and twisted his body.

Zzzt!

The general's sword cut through the wind and whirled around.

But Tae-san didn't take a step back, and by twisting his body, he was able to dodge all the attacks.
Here is the translation of the text:

As the horse's movements became faster and faster, the vulnerable part it had been protecting was exposed.

The moment he saw that, Tai-san rushed over like a shooting star.

The horse hastily tried to defend itself, but Tai-san's sword struck the exposed part like a snake.

"This is the first one," Tai-san muttered.

*

The horse changed its method in response to Tai-san's attack. It stopped defending its neck and only defended the vulnerable part.

As a result, Tai-san also changed his method.

His stats were overwhelmingly higher than the horse's. Moreover, his proficiency in high-level skills allowed him to partially read the horse's intentions, making it difficult to dodge the attack. Therefore, the horse focused only on evasive maneuvers until it was exposed again.

Before long, the exhausted horse unintentionally exposed its vulnerable part.

"Ha! This is the thirty-third one," Tai-san muttered.

As Tai-san continued to succeed around fifty times, the horse changed its method again.

The horse, which had been buried in a deep underground tomb, had a unique sword technique. Although it was unorthodox, its well-controlled movements pinned Tai-san down.
Here is the translation of the text:

But suddenly, Tai Shan abandoned his sword technique and started pushing forward with his body.

Taishan quickly tried to dodge the knight's attack, but the distance was too close. Eventually, Taishan had to allow the knight's charge.

"Hmm."

It was back to the beginning again.

A ghost shook its head repeatedly.

[I felt like I was going crazy, but I guess I wouldn't have thought so.]

After spending several hours, he had almost succeeded, expecting to succeed in about 90 attempts. However, when the knight changed his response, he had to start from the beginning again.

He had to repeat this process over and over again. It was a task that required an almost infinite amount of time.

"Isn't this better than addition?"

[Why? It's the same thing.]

"This can at least be obtained with certainty."

[...]

The ghost realized what Tai Shan was trying to say.

Addition required blocking variables to obtain a result. However, the variable was something that Tai Shan couldn't control, so it was a variable.
Here is the translation of the text:

When Tai Shan could obtain the addition, all he could do was swing his sword repeatedly. That was all. He was extremely limited in what he could do.

As he said, if he was unlucky, he wouldn't be able to get the skill of addition even if he lived for a lifetime.

In contrast, Pil-jeong could manage variables. Monsters would respond to Tai Shan's attacks one by one, trying to hinder him.

So, the story is simple.

If one could grasp all the countermeasures the opponent was drawing and attack accordingly, success would be a matter of time.

[Farewell.]

The ghost let out a sarcastic laugh.

Tai Shan continued to move.

After about 50 times, the general changed the pattern again.

Tai Shan, who couldn't respond immediately, had to start from the beginning again.

However, Tai Shan's expression didn't change.

And soon, the general's pattern became repetitive within a certain flow.

Tai Shan judged that the general couldn't come up with new patterns and moved immediately.

"Ah."

The general changed the number. He changed patterns and tried to press Tai Shan.

But it was all Tai Shan had experienced before.
Here is the translation of the text:

It wasn't like I was seeing it for the first time, so responding wasn't difficult.

And so, I slowly approached the end.

Whoosh.

The Taesan's sword struck at the vital spot. The knight's body shook greatly.

"This is enough for a hundred times."

[You have been continuously attacking your opponent's vital spot. You have obtained the special skill "Piercing".]

I finally obtained the skill. The ghostly being let out a sigh of amazement.

[Even if I had felt it before, it's truly amazing. Is there someone who can achieve success even with my method?]

"It's likely."

In his previous life, he had taught the method to many people, but only Taeyeon had succeeded.

Now that I have obtained Piercing, I have no further business with the knight.

I rush towards the stumbling knight, draw out my sword, and strike it into their neck.

Whoosh.

The knight falls like that.

[You have defeated the knight who was consumed by the deep abyss.] [Your level has risen.] [You have obtained a Rune of the Elements.] [You have obtained a ???.]

"Ahh."

Taesan lets out a small sigh. Although it's familiar, it still took a hundred times to strike at the vital spot, and controlling my will with a conceptual skill was also tiring.
Here is the translation of the text:

But ultimately, I succeeded.

[Special activation skill: Piercing] [Mana consumption: 50] [Proficiency: 1%] [Guaranteed to hit the next attack on the opponent. This attack cannot be dodged.]

It was a skill that lived up to its name. I launched an attack that could not be dodged at the opponent. The only things the opponent could do were to erase, block, or take the attack.

[I don't know... this is amazing. Are you giving me this skill too?]

The piercing skill, which forces a specific response from the opponent, was a skill comparable to nullifying attacks or forcing a duel.

On top of that, I had an ability sword.

Since this skill could be used endlessly as long as the premise of clashing swords was met, it was possible to pull out its efficiency to the extreme by linking it.

However, I was not satisfied yet.

There were still many skills I could obtain. I thought about acquiring all of them as soon as the conditions were met.

All of my skills from my previous life.

And the additional skills I could obtain with solo mode stats.

If I combined all of them, I couldn't even imagine how powerful I would become.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san confirmed the rewards for clearing the 38th floor first.

[Rune of Lightning] [Infuses the equipment with the power of lightning.]

It was unknown when to replace the weapon. The ghost said that it was possible to obtain the weapon used by oneself later, so Tae-san launched the rune onto the arrow.

Paja.

A blue glow appeared on the arrow.

[Lightning Arrow with Self-Awareness: Rune of Lightning] [A self-moving arrow that moves to protect its owner. It moves on its own and cannot exceed a certain range.] [Current owner: Kang Tae-san] [The user's level is insufficient. Attack power: 1] [The rune is imbued, increasing attack power by 30] [The attacked enemy will be affected by an abnormal state.]

The attack power increased by 30. In addition, the effect of adding a thunderbolt to the arrow, similar to the one that hit the tall tree, also had a small but good effect of judging abnormal states each time it attacked.

Tae-san took out the arrows.

The two arrows were crackling with lightning.

"It's fine, I guess."

It wasn't a bad change. However, the explanation that the level was insufficient and the attack power was not increasing as expected left Tae-san wondering how to increase it.
Here is the translation of the text:

[He used it.] [He got the dispelling sword of magic release.] [The dispelling sword of magic release] [A sword imbued with the dispelling magic. It can remove the seal of magic, but it cannot remove a higher seal of magic imbued in the sword.]

The dispelling sword of magic release. Having it would be a useful equipment that could be used at some point.

Tai-san took out the sword and went down to the 40th floor.

[Start of 40th floor quest.] [Defeat the boss of the 40th floor and pass through.] [Reward: Necklace of the noble] [Secret reward: ???]

Finally, it was the 40th floor.

The knights had settled in the 30th floor and the end was in sight.

Tai-san was about to move towards the floor when the darkness parted and a girl appeared.

"What's going on this time?"

Despite the sudden appearance of the demon, Tai-san remained calm.

He had guessed the reason. There was no reason for her to appear before him in this way.

Guiding the path of sin.

They had moved.
