Chapter 469

469. 89th Floor, the Outpost of the Gods (2)

"The atmosphere is better than I thought. I thought we'd be wary of each other and try to kill each other."

"Everyone who comes here for the first time thinks that. But we're all abandoned in this crappy world, aren't we? We should at least get along with each other."

"That's right."

They weren't abandoned.

They had abandoned the world themselves.

And yet, they claimed to be abandoned. Taesan hid a smile as he poured himself a drink.

"Cheers! Let's have fun!"

They laughed and chatted, enjoying a small celebration. Taesan quietly raised his cup to his lips, calmly assessing the servants.

"They're at the level of immortals."

They had barely managed to reach that level, but each and every one of them possessed the strength of an immortal.

They were by no means weak. Each one of them could destroy a world as easily as taking a stroll.

But for Taesan, there was an unbridgeable gap between them.

After observing them for a moment, Taesan opened his mouth again.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Anyway, it's quite surprising. I thought I was the only one, but it seems there are many people in the same situation."

"What, those people who are kind enough to tell us aren't like that, are they? They're all busy, so it's understandable."

"I happened to meet that person and made a contract, so I don't know the details of their side. Can I ask?"

"Of course! Ask me anything! What are you curious about?"

The man showed a very kind attitude towards Taesan. Taesan asked him.

"Just... I'm curious about everything. About the gods and about you people."

"Okay, I'll explain. From the beginning, that is."

The man opened his mouth.

He started explaining this and that. The existence of the gods and how they made a contract with them. Most of it was a story that Taesan already knew.

However, since it was from the gods' perspective, it was quite different from what Taesan knew.

"Originally, this world belonged to them! Those who are called transcendents, who don't have the proper qualifications, chased them out and took their place by force!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Gosin existed before the universe existed. Then, the Transcendent One appeared. Simply put, the man's words were not wrong, but, oh, the great devil. Baal had said so.

Gosin and the demons, who existed before the creation of the world, possessed original sin.

They were the ones who denied the flow of time.

If they had the proper qualifications, it was a speech that couldn't be made.

"That's right."

Taesan nodded calmly. The man, fueled by his god, shouted even louder.

"I've reached an unparalleled height! I've made the world my own. That's the rightful result of my efforts!"

The man slammed his fist on the table with a distorted face.

"But that damn Transcendent One intervened in my world! Their actions were not permitted, and they tried to kill me! I barely escaped, but as a result, I lost everything!"

"Me too!"

Everyone shouted out their own circumstances. The man spread his arms wide.

"The Transcendent Ones are corrupt! They must die, and their existence must be erased from this world!"

"That's right!"

They didn't stop their frenzied shouting.

Taesan quietly nodded in agreement and listened to their story."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"And after a long time had passed, a piece of information that Taesan had been waiting for finally came out of their mouths, which had calmed down a bit.

'I could have become a servant of the filthy contaminated god.'

It was the first time he had heard the name of the god.

Taesan's eyes sparkled.

'If it's the filthy contaminated god...'

'You're the one who has the most interest in them. Thanks to their power being relatively burden-free, more than half of the people here are their servants.'

'I see.'

'And if there's someone who frequently intervenes, wouldn't it be the darkness that spreads endlessly?'

'Right? The two of them are the ones who appear the most, anyway?'

Both were beings he had never heard of before. Taesan organized the information in his mind.

'Is it a characteristic of the power that Goshin possesses?'

If it's a power that intervenes in this world with minimal burden, it would be a power close to the laws of nature.

And the more such power, the easier it is to intervene in the world.

After thinking for a moment, Taesan opened his mouth.

'Does the World Destroyer not intervene well?'

'Yeah. That's why you're amazing. I heard for the first time that they created a servant.'

The man looked at Taesan with an amazed expression."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You're someone who's too enormous to casually enter this world, right? That's correct. If you made a contract with them, did you happen to see their true form? Just how big are they, anyway?"

He had seen the seventh droplet of blood. The distance between it and the main body was too great. He couldn't help but tell a moderate lie. Taesan shook his head.

"I don't know either. At least, I couldn't grasp it with my perception."

"Is that so...?"

They seemed to accept Taesan's lie with a face that said "that's possible."

Even if Taesan hid his power, they would know that he was on the level of an immortal.

As an immortal, it was normal for even the size of the main body of the High God to be impossible to grasp.

Taesan opened his mouth again.

"Does the Empty Monarch, who often intervenes, also do so?"

"Huh? How do you know that?"

"I had the chance to."

"No, they don't intervene easily either. They only do so very rarely, about once every hundred years or so."

"I see."

A middle-aged man who had been listening to the conversation from behind spoke up.

"They had an avatar. It was always running around, causing chaos everywhere."

"Ah, the one who insisted on using only their own power, not the authority of the gods?"

"It's been a while since we've heard from that guy. What's he up to?"

"Hmm? Did he go somewhere far away to have fun or something?"

They exchanged opinions among themselves.

Taesan could tell who they were talking about.

It was the avatar that had been waiting in the world of Levinov, which he had destroyed.

"It's not like we can have a direct conversation with each other, connected like that."

He had become a subordinate of Goshin, but fundamentally, there wasn't much difference.

"He'll be doing well on his own. There are also various other people like that."

Information about Goshin continued to flow from their mouths.

The worthless one.

The king beyond.

The one who rules the universe.

The one who encompasses everything.

The usurper.

"They're all people who don't show their faces now. Among them, the usurper is someone we only know by name."

"Is that so?"

"A very long time ago... during the war with the Transcendents, he actively fought... but it's too old of a story, so we don't know much about it either. His powers are also unknown."

[…….]

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Akasha, who had been quiet, suddenly trembled.

It was a very small, almost imperceptible tremor, one that even he himself couldn't detect.

"Is it reacting to the name 'Chantal'?"

Taesan stored that information in his mind. The man continued speaking.

"And the monster that walks through time. The administrator of this place serves that person."

"The administrator...?"

"There's one of their incarnations here. That guy is managing this place, and he's ridiculously powerful."

"Is he temporarily absent right now?"

On this planet, the aura of someone that powerful couldn't be felt.

"He's temporarily absent, busy destroying a world. He's quite busy."

"Envious... I wish I could become one of their incarnations too..."

Someone muttered with a tone full of envy. Taesan's eyes quietly sparkled.

"I see."

"Is that enough?"

"That's sufficient. Thank you."

"What's that?"

The man chuckled and patted Taesan's shoulder.

"We're comrades who will be together forever, unless we die. Feel free to talk to me anytime. I'll listen to everything you have to say."

"Yes."

Taesan replied quietly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"After that, they started conversing with each other.

Most of the stories were about how they had destroyed some world and the resistance they had faced, but occasionally they would get some useful information.

Taesan quietly listened, and then someone spoke up as if they had remembered something.

"And what about that guy, what happened to him?"

"Who's that guy?"

"You know, the one they're interested in, the existence of this world."

"Ah, you mean the guy from the labyrinth? It's amazing, isn't it? I don't think they even made a contract, but somehow they're using their power."

They brought up Taesan as the main topic of the conversation.

"Don't we need to go stop that guy too?"

"I don't know. Our master seemed to have plans to move initially, but recently, there's been no word. I'd like to crush the foolish ones who dare to defy them with my own hands."

Someone grumbled. Taesan gazed at them with a cold expression.

"Are you serious? You think you can win if you use their power too?"

"What's impossible? Even if I can't do it alone, if we all combine our strength, it's possible, isn't it?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

At that moment, a sudden silence fell.

"Shall we take action ourselves?"

"What's the hurry? They're already considering him a significant nuisance. It's a gesture to alleviate their concerns."

"Hmm..."

The sudden silence fell again.

The one who started the conversation continued to persuade the others.

"No matter how strong he is, if all of us here take action, we can win. Are you scared or something?"

"Don't talk nonsense. Even if we use their power, we're just thieves without justification. Why be afraid?"

"What's there to be afraid of, then? Let's take action. Let's find him and tear him apart. We'll offer ourselves as sacrifices to them! Then, they'll deeply favor us!"

He whispered to them.

"Don't you want to gain their favor too? If we kill him, we can become that."

The atmosphere changed.

Those who were hesitant at first began to find the proposal appealing.

"Hmm..."

"It's not bad..."

They decided to take action to kill Taesan themselves.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The opinion was tilted.

"But I don't even know how it happened, so how can I do it?"

"Don't worry, I know."

The one who started the story spoke confidently.

"I have an informant, so I've heard the story roughly. First, it's about a black-haired, black-eyed person."

"Hmm, hmm."

"And it's not a white person. It's a yellow race."

"And?"

"They're using the power of those people, and everyone knows it. And their face is..."

He began to describe the characteristics of Taesan one by one.

Taesan, who had been quietly listening, was surprised. It was because it was surprisingly accurate.

He had traveled to many worlds, and it wasn't unusual for there to be a spy from the Goshin among them.

The story continued to unfold.

The man who had been quietly listening opened his mouth.

"Is it similar to our new recruit?"

Their gazes turned to Taesan.

The one who had been describing Taesan's characteristics suddenly said, "......That's right."

"Hey, what a coincidence. How did you get here? This is a place where even transcendents can't intervene carelessly."

"But that guy can handle their powers, can't he?"

The atmosphere suddenly turned silent.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The atmosphere changed again.

Taesan was staring at them with a blank expression.

"...It's just a simple coincidence, I suppose."

The man grabbed Taesan's shoulder with a cheerful tone.

"Our new recruit can't be that incompetent, right? And why did he come in here? This is their territory. It's suicidal! Isn't it?"

Taesan didn't respond.

He just stared at them with a blank expression.

The man's face slowly hardened. He took his hand off Taesan's shoulder. As he stumbled backward, Taesan's mouth opened.

"There's one thing I'm curious about."

"Huh, what?"

"Is there a difference in rank among the gods?"

"Uh... I've heard there is, but... we don't know the details."

"Is that so. If it's too big to enter carelessly, then the World Destroyer must be a high-ranking god. That's fortunate."

If the seventh fragment, which has that level of power, is considered lower-ranking among the gods, it will be quite difficult.

[Should we handle it slowly?]

"I've gotten everything I needed."

Taesan stood up from his seat.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His hand somehow held a Badley.

The atmosphere was tense, like a rubber band stretched to its limit. Taesan, who had become rigid, spoke to them.

"You said you'd kill me? Let's see how you'll do it."

"......Kill!"

They let out a scream-like cry.

The slaves, who numbered over ten, rushed towards Taesan.

Taesan grasped his sword and swung it. The ash-colored explosion erased the small building, leaving no trace behind.
