**Chapter 376**

**376. The 78th Floor, the Library of the Gods (1)**

“Huff.”

The Lion King exhaled.

His entire body was trembling.

The energy he had unleashed with all his might was barely protecting his body, but his unstable appearance seemed like it would shatter at any moment.

The Lion King looked up.

In the endless, ash-colored space, black spheres were floating like stars.

The Lion King gritted his teeth and moved forward.

Kukukuk.

A powerful pressure crushed him. The space itself was distorting, trying to twist his entire body.

“Grrr!”

The Lion King unleashed his power. It was the full force of his strength, which had reached the limits of his mortality.

But it was meaningless.

Like a single drop of water falling into the ocean, only a small ripple spread and disappeared, and the ash-colored space remained eerily calm.

The Lion King advanced with a stern face.

He had used up all his gold to prioritize defense and equipped himself with protective gear, but each piece was being destroyed one by one. After barely managing to protect his crumbling body, he finally arrived in front of a massive black sphere.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"……Oh great existence!"

The Lion King sat down, overwhelmed, and shouted.

"You who gaze upon the destruction of all things, who despise all laws, oh ruler! This humble body! I call out to you in your domain!"

As he shouted, the Lion King pulled out numerous jewels from his bosom and threw them away.

The jewels were engulfed by a massive sphere and disappeared.

The Lion King bowed his head to the ground. From here on, he didn't know what would happen. He swallowed his dry saliva and waited quietly.

Ku-gung.

The sphere trembled.

A tremendous pressure crushed the Lion King's entire body. He barely endured the overwhelming force that seemed to melt his mind.

The force slowly subsided.

And then, it descended upon this place.

[You pitiful thing.]

A voice filled with disdain echoed. The space trembled just from the vibrations in the voice.

[You're commendable for daring to enter my domain. But do you think you can call me, you insignificant thing?]

The Lion King's entire body began to crumble. His resistance and strength were meaningless. There was a gap of that magnitude between them.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The Lion King remained still, continuing to bow his head.

Then, the power that had been pressing down on him began to subside slightly.

[Answer me. What brings you to my domain?]

The first step had been passed.

The Lion King, suppressing his pounding chest, spoke.

"Greatest Transcender, I have a proposal for you."

As soon as he finished speaking, an overwhelming power, unlike anything before, enveloped the Lion King.

The Lion King's consciousness was momentarily cut off.

[How dare you make a proposal to me?]

The emotion contained in that voice was singular: anger.

The Lion King opened his trembling lips.

"Don't you want to distort the plans of other gods?"

As soon as he spoke, the power that had been trampling the Lion King vanished.

The Lion King didn't even have time to catch his breath before continuing to speak.

"A certain adventurer is descending into the labyrinth. He possesses immense power. Many gods are fond of him, and they want to make him their subordinate when he dies."

This was the opportunity. The Lion King didn't stop speaking.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If there's no major problem, he will clear the labyrinth. The other gods will be delighted and satisfied to see his appearance. They will think that creating the labyrinth was worthwhile."

The Lion King's eyes gleamed.

"Don't you want to crush their expectations? Don't you want to make their faith and trust meaningless and trample on their confident actions?"

The voice was quiet. The Lion King waited.

After a moment, the voice spoke up.

[It will be a delightful thing, indeed.]

It was decided.

The Lion King clenched his fist.

"I will assist your will. I will become your tool and carry out your intentions."

[Why do I have to deal with your trivial matters?]

"You cannot directly intervene in the adventurer's journey."

One of the laws that bound the Labyrinth's god. The gods could not directly interfere with the Labyrinth's adventurers. Many gods did not like to get involved in the affairs of the guides of evil, but this was not a story limited to just them.

However, there were many gods in the Labyrinth.

And to the gods, good and evil had no meaning. They moved according to their own domain.

There were also gods who did not like the Labyrinth's guides.

[So?]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The sharp voice had subsided.

[You can't even touch it, so accept your pitiful self?]

"No. This is just a plea for mercy."

The Lion King bowed his head quietly.

He felt the gaze directed at him.

The Lion King closed his eyes. The outcome had already slipped out of his hands. He could only offer a prayer to someone, unsure of who it would reach.

[Good.]

The Lion King opened his eyes.

[I'll acknowledge your pathetic effort, but it's not what you desire. Don't regret it. Mortal.]

Power enveloped the Lion King.

* * *

Balbam appeared, gazing silently at the mountain, then spoke abruptly.

[My head hurts.]

Balbam said, sounding exhausted.

[You really hurt my head.]

"What's wrong?"

[Nothing's wrong. The clear is not a problem. Among all adventurers who cleared the 77th floor, you were the most perfect.]

77th floor. The quest to stabilize the world destroyed by the gods.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Most adventurers solved problems with violence and brute force. As long as they could somehow survive and clear the quest, they were satisfied with the minimum requirement.

On the other hand, Taesan perfectly cleared the quest. Even Balbambara didn't expect him to solve it to this extent.

The problem was on the other side of his head.

[You've reached a high level, albeit limited. You're someone who couldn't even reach the 80th floor.]

"Did you know?"

[I'm the administrator. I know most of what happens here.]

Balbambara spoke in a troubled tone.

[Well, it's not like it never happens. There are cases where people reach a high level through contracts with gods. But... this is the first time someone has reached it with their own power...].

Balbambara, who was worried, shook his head.

[The mage will handle it. I won't bother.]

He had exceeded his jurisdiction.

Balbambara gave up. From now on, he would leave all problems related to Taesan to the mage. He was certain that was the least painful choice.

[Then, what about the reward?]

This was also a problem.

Taesan had perfectly cleared the quest, exceeding his expectations.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"So, I had to give him a suitable reward.

But now, Taesan has reached the limit, albeit partially. A mediocre reward wouldn't be enough to satisfy Taesan.

After much contemplation, Balbam decided.

[It's better to go simple in times like these.]

Power is bestowed upon Taesan.

[You have obtained the title [Savior of the World].] [You have obtained the ring of the World Savior.] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [Check the rewards yourself.]

Balbam's body begins to crumble. Just before he leaves, he says:

[You are currently unstable. If you reach the perfect realm, the wizard will come to find you.]

"I understand."

With those final words, Balbam disappears.

Taesan checks the rewards.

[Title: Savior of the World] [A title given to those who perfectly save the world.] [HP + 2000] [MP + 500] [Magic + 200] [Attack + 200] [Defense + 200]

Taesan realizes what Balbam meant by 'going simple'."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a title that only greatly increased ability values.

"That's fine."

Unlike equipment, the title's performance was demonstrated just by possessing it. With this level of performance, it was not inferior even when compared to a single high-grade equipment.

[Ring of the World Savior] [Reward given to those who restored the world on the brink of destruction.] [Mana +500] [Magic +100] [Attack Power +300]

All the stats that would be helpful to Taesan were attached. It was a considerable performance.

The blood-red hammer, which was a basic clear reward, was not a weapon to be used, so I thought of selling it at the store.

And the skills.

[Special Divine Skill: Sanctuary Creation] [Proficiency: 1%] [Consumed Divine Power:???] [Creates a sanctuary by materializing one's divine power and creating a domain. The size and characteristics of the sanctuary vary depending on the consumed divine power and implementation method.]

It was the first divine skill I obtained.

It was a skill that would be more helpful on Earth than in the labyrinth. It was optimal for use on the devastated Earth."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was possible to maintain it indefinitely as long as people's faith did not waver. Low-ranking monsters wouldn't even be able to approach the holy land.

And then, there was the transcendent skill that was like blackness.

[Transcendent Skill: Eternal Unwavering Faith] [Proficiency: 1%] [Consumption: Faith and Vigor] [You receive faith from all living beings in one world. They will send you unwavering faith forever. By consuming their faith and your own vigor, you can obtain complete divinity.]

"Hmm."

I had a rough idea of the skill's effect.

[You have activated Eternal Unwavering Faith.]

In an instant, the inner world of Taesan expanded.

The faith of people who worshipped him from beyond space poured into him. His strong physique and mental state reached a higher level simultaneously.

The omnipotence he felt on the verge of destruction in the previous world dominated his entire body.

[Oh.]

The ghost let out an involuntary cheer.

Taesan, at this moment, had surpassed mortality.

[Is this real...?]

"No."

Taesan cancelled the skill. The omnipotence disappeared, and his physical strength took its place.

"Not yet."

It was clear that he could temporarily surpass mortality, but...

Note: "Taesan" is a Korean name, and I left it untranslated as it is a proper noun.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But the duration and stability were the problems. Considering the burden it placed, it was difficult to sustain it for even a few minutes.

And his faith was being consumed at an abnormal rate. The number of people who believed in him didn't even reach 10,000. If he forced himself to use it, there was a possibility that the sacred ground maintained by his faith would collapse.

"...Is it a realm limited to that world?"

It was a matter of course when you thought about it.

He had become a god by receiving the faith of all people in a world on the brink of destruction. It was a realm achieved through a shortcut.

In other words, the power he had as a god could only be used in a world on the brink of destruction.

It seemed like a huge burden to use that power in a different place.

[It's still a ridiculous story. At least, it's a power that can temporarily surpass mortality. Do you know what that means?]

The ghost said in a slightly excited tone.

[It means that unless you can surpass mortality, you can't win against me.]

It was different from before.

Even if you stepped into the boundary, you couldn't win against the absolute mountain. It was an unchanging fact.

"It's still an unstable power, but...".

The upcoming Earth Return Quest."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Players from China, Japan, and Korea had already been worshiping Taesan.

What would happen if people from other countries also started worshiping Taesan?

Through the community, the story of Taesan spread far and wide, and soon his name was known in other countries as well.

Many people died while fighting monsters or descending into labyrinths, but the surviving players were numerous, unlike the world on the brink of destruction.

If they were to receive faith from them, and if they were to receive the qualifications on Earth as well...

They would be able to maintain the effects of their skills stably. Perhaps they could even achieve 100% mastery of divine power.

The return ahead was anticipated.

Taesan headed towards the 78th floor. The quest window blocked his view.

[78th Floor Quest Begins.] [Successfully complete the librarian's request in the Library of Heaven.] [Reward: Book of Knowledge.] [Secret Reward: ???]"
