19. 2nd Floor, God of Struggle and Death. Rakyiratas (4)

[Gang Taesan [Alone]: Don't take it.] [Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: Um... I'm tempted though... How can I not?] [Gang Taesan [Alone]: It's a problem that Itaeyeon is scared and you have no fear. Let me give you a simple example. You didn't get it because you were scared?] [Gang Junhyuk [Alone]: Yes. How do I get it?] [Gang Taesan [Alone]: Can you get it if you just used the wanted our When Would Maybe you have now gives Nevertheless the to so  Among his even the one now among the advantages he's injunction Chinese invasion to give a
If it were a different monster, I wouldn't mind, but goblins use weapons. When fighting with the same type of weapon, the advantage of a rapier is more valuable than attack speed.

Still, it's not a bad weapon. It could be useful when fighting up close. Taesan put the short sword in his inventory and checked a small shield.

[Wooden Shield] [Defense +3] [Not that big. It can block most attacks, but it might break under too strong an attack.]

Its performance is inferior to the tower shield. It has 2 lower defense and no attack power. But Taesan hesitated.

"From here on, the tower shield isn't much use."

Unlike the Big Rat, goblins are numerous and agile. They pressure him by coordinating with each other. While the tower shield has an advantage in a 1:1 situation, it's not suitable for fighting multiple opponents.

Moreover, it's too big. Its size covers Taesan's entire body, limiting his field of vision.

Rather than avoiding attacks by covering more than necessary, focusing on blocking poses issues for his movements.

Taesan made his decision. He put away the tower shield and drew out the rusty sword.
In his right hand, a shield. And in his left, a sword. Normally it would be the opposite, but being left-handed, this setup suited him better.

His defense decreased by 2. However, against goblins, this was the optimal setup.

Sword and shield.

It was a combination he had used for quite a long time.

He earned 200 gold. Each goblin dropped 50 gold. Not bad.

With his preparations complete, Taesan headed towards the corridor.

* * *

In the next room, he found four goblins: one wielding a bow, one with a spear, one with a short sword, and one with a longsword. There were slight variations from before, but Taesan's approach remained largely unchanged.

Taesan charged at the goblins.

"Kaak!"

"Kieek!"

He blocked attacks with his shield and thrust with his sword.

It was much more stable than using the tower shield. He could handle minor damage easily. Taking down just one would almost fully restore his condition.

[8 damage to the goblin with the short sword.] [You have defeated the goblin with the short sword.]

"Kaaa...."
The goblins crumble down. The eyes of the goblin holding the bow, having killed its comrade, turn wide with fear. Suddenly, another goblin wielding a longsword hesitates upon seeing its fallen ally. Taesan seizes the opportunity without hesitation and charges at the goblin.

"Kieek!"

Thwack!

He strikes the goblin's arm with his shield. The hand holding the weapon trembles, and Taesan pierces with his sword.

[You have defeated the goblin wielding the longsword.]

"Kiee..."

"Kaaak!"

A spear thrusts towards Taesan. He deflects it with his sword and blocks incoming arrows with his shield. The goblin with the spear screams in rage and swings its weapon towards Taesan.

In an instant, it becomes apparent. The goblin holding the spear is terribly inexperienced. It's clear they've lost control in their anger.

Taesan moves instinctively. He deflects the spear with his shield and strikes with his sword. The spear flies through the air.

"Ka, kaak."

He overpowers the goblin who lost its weapon.

[You have defeated the goblin who lost its spear.]

It was a swift response system. Only one goblin remains with a bow. Taesan desperately tries to shoot arrows, but he casually knocks them away with his sword. A bow without backup was not intimidating.

"Ka, kaak."

He approaches the trembling goblin. His sword comes down with a strike.
Here's the translation of the text:

[You have defeated the goblin wielding a bow.] [Your level has increased.] [You are in your best condition.] [As a reward for leveling up, your health has increased by 10.] [As a reward for leveling up, your strength has permanently increased by 1. Agility has permanently increased by 2. Intelligence has permanently increased by 1.]

You have increased significantly. Balanced growth was the best method.

There was no change in the foreign ascension. Four signs of an intelligence rise to one.

"Status window."

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 4] [Health: 165/165] [Mana: 15/15] [Strength: 18] [Intelligence: 24] [Agility: 32] [Attack + 3] [Defense + 5] [The target is in the best condition.]

It's still a funny status. It was like it was before the end of this one. ë§Œ 20 floors, now 2, are among the force's growth.
Here's the translation of the text:

She probably had lower stats than the average in Alone Mode as she had missed a lot in haste.

No one knew because there were no survivors except her.

Taesan, checking the status window contentedly, quickly checked the equipment.

"Sword. Sword, come out."

There was a goblin holding a sword. Since the dagger had an attack power of 1, the probability of the sword being 2 was high.

Two arrows. One bow. And there was a sword.

"Yes!"

Taesan quickly confirmed.

[Rustless Sword] [Attack + 2] [Seems decent enough to use.]

"Good."

A rise in attack power by 1. It looked quite modest, but above all, it held significant value.

Additional attack power in the maze is all calculated as a total sum.

When attack power 1 goes up, damage that would have been 8 becomes 9.

When the base damage is low like this, the decision between whether to strike once more depending on the difference between attack powers 1 and 2 is made.

At first glance, attack power was much more important than other stats.

He was quite satisfied with just the sword. But there was more reward. Taesan's pupils widened as he checked the bow.
Here's the translation of the text:

[Bow] [Attack + 1] [Accuracy + 40%] [Seems like it can be used decently.]

"This is good too."

The bow he was using now had no attack power, relying solely on the arrow's attack power.

Due to Ayrock's weapon skill, it delivered a reasonable amount of damage, but without it, it would have been quite weak.

The accuracy rate was also very low at 20%, requiring considerable effort when shooting arrows.

Two problems were solved at once. Taesan happily organized his bow.

"You're out now."

He put the rusty sword in his inventory and took out the Rustless Sword.

He became stronger once. Already, by switching to sword and shield, he dealt with four goblins without using a single skill. Now, he could handle it even without using arrows.

After finishing the organization, Taesan headed back to the corridor.

Similar to before, he opened the door slightly and checked inside.

"Huh?"

Taesan entered the room. There were no goblins inside. But it wasn't just an empty room.

Inside the room, there was an altar for a deity.

"You have discovered the Altar of Rakiratas."

* * * 


Here's the translation of the text:

[First Discovery Bonus] [Intelligence permanently increased by 1. Mana permanently increased by 2.]

Intelligence and mana. They were always decent stats. Taesan looked at the altar.

A circular altar was placed in the middle of the room.

It was adorned with gruesome bloodstains, and sharp decorations hinted at the nature of the altar's owner.

The god of the labyrinth has many personalities.

There are gods who are friendly to players and gods who are hostile. There are also those who see them as objects of ridicule, and those who show compassion.

But most of them are gods who are regarded as playthings, as Yoo Tae-yeon once said.

Rakiratas.

The name of the god that appeared in the system window. Taesan tried to remember what kind of god it was.

"The god of struggle and death."

That's all he knew. Yoo Tae-yeon didn't bother to find out, as he was a target of ridicule and mockery among the gods. Taesan put his hand on the altar.

[Altar of Rakiratas] [An altar created by those who serve Rakiratas. It is a gateway connected to the god. Rakiratas can exert influence through this place.]
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"The altar of those who serve the god. Every time Yoo Tae-yeon arrived here, he said he received a quest. As he finished his thoughts, a frightening crimson mist spread throughout the room.

A massive presence was felt beyond the altar. It was thicker and heavier in power than the monsters he had seen.

If this is what is felt through the passage, most people would go insane the moment they directly faced it.

'Is this a god?'

Things that exist only in alone mode. Rakiratas is one of them. A quest window appeared.

[Sub-quest started] [Rakiratas wants to test you, who have come to his altar. If you accept, trials will come to you. If you overcome them, rewards will follow.] [Reward: Determined by Rakiratas according to your achievements.]

Upon arriving at the altar, you can challenge the trials imposed by the god. Yoo Tae-yeon also discovered Rakiratas' altar on the second floor and was offered the same quest.

However, she did not accept.

Instinctively, Yoo Tae-yeon felt that the trial was something she couldn't handle. She hurriedly escaped from the room. Therefore, she had no information at all about what the trial was, or what kind it was.

Taesan was considering accepting.

'Cost and reward.'"
Here's the translation of the text into English:

"Risking his life to break through the secret room, he obtained the Staff of Flames.

Blocking Ainzhar's strike, he mastered the Art of Iirak.

Achieving the achievement thought to be impossible, he rewarded more than that moment.

It was the same in Easy Mode, but here was more.

There was no thought of running away like a coward. Taesan accepted the sub-quest.

[Sub-quest started] [Rakiratas is pleased with your choice.]

Crimson mist fills the room before the altar.

The mist gathers and forms legs. Riding the legs, knees form, thighs are made. Chest, abdomen, and head sculpt into one human form.

It doesn't end there. The mist-formed shape is swallowed up again.

Gradually, the mist disappears, revealing crimson armor.

Clang.

The crimson armor extends a hand.

The remaining mist gathers into the form of a sword.

[You have encountered Rakiratas' Offspring [Fake].] [Trial of Rakiratas: Defeat Rakiratas' Offspring [Fake].]

* * *

Taesan widened the gap and killed Rakiratas' Offspring [Fake]."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

It was armor reminiscent of what a medieval knight would wear. It securely encased every part of the limbs and perfectly protected the head with a helmet. No matter how closely one inspected it, finding any gaps was difficult.

Clang.

The crimson knight raised his sword, pointing it towards Taesan. Even just by observing his stance without fighting, one could tell.

That figure is infinitely stronger than goblins.

Taesan gripped his shield and sword.

The knight, who had been watching Taesan for a moment, shifted his stance.

Whoosh!

With a speed that didn't seem possible while wearing armor, he rushed towards Taesan. However, Taesan remained unfazed. He had encountered countless beings whose appearance and presence did not match. He swung his shield towards the descending sword.

Clang!

It was Taesan who was pushed back. A tingling sensation spread through his arm where he had blocked.

[You received 25 damage.]

"Huh."

A rueful smile escaped at the unexpected damage. If this much damage gets through, the shield is meaningless even if it's blocked. Taesan took a step back and widened the distance. He put away his shield and drew a rusty sword.

"Dual swords, it's been a while."

Whoosh!

Once again, the knight thrust forward. The entire room trembled with the weighty force vibrating through. The knight slashed vigorously across horizontally.

Taesan swung his sword in response.

The sound of metal clashing reverberated. Again, it was Taesan who was pushed back.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

---

With two encounters, Taesan realized. The knight held the upper hand in strength. It wasn't a huge difference, but facing head-on meant inevitable defeat.

Then what about agility? Taesan turned his body and began to flee. The knight chased after him.

Clang! Clang!

Listening to the harsh sound of iron, Taesan noticed.

Agility was his advantage. The distance between the knight and him was gradually widening. It wasn't a significant difference, but it wasn't insignificant either.

The opponent had the advantage in strength, while he had it in agility. Taesan, who was fleeing, suddenly turned his body. He rushed towards the knight and struck down with his sword.

The pursuing knight hastily raised his sword.

Clang!

The swords clashed. Their hands were locked. However, Taesan wielded dual swords. With his free left hand, he jabbed at the knight's side.

Clink!

[Dealt 6 damage to [Fake] Knight of Laki Ratas.]

The armor was pierced. It mitigated the damage due to the protective gear, but it was sufficient.

Taesan continued his assault. He jabbed at the waist with his left hand again. This time, it dealt 5 damage.

The knight did not remain passive either. With force, he parried the sword and aimed diagonally at Taesan.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

Instead of blocking, Taesan dives into his opponent's embrace. He slips right under their hand to evade the attack.

With this, there's no room for Taesan to swing his sword, but he possesses the Iralik technique. Swiftly, he thrusts his sword and swings his fist.

[Dealt 4 damage to [Fake] Knight of Laki Ratas.]

It was a good decision to purchase the gloves of the martial arts. If Taesan had hit the armor with his bare hands, he would have suffered greater damage.

The knight tries to widen the distance to swing the sword, but Taesan sticks close to him.

As a last resort, the knight attempts to swing the sword, but Taesan reaches out and grabs his wrist. He strikes the leg, then the neck, and pushes with his shoulder.

4, 3, 4. A total of 11 damage is dealt.

"Not bad."

Taesan cleared all 100 floors of the labyrinth. Even though it was in easy mode, the experience wasn't wasted.

Methods to face enemies stronger than oneself.

Methods to face enemies weaker in agility.

He knew all the methods to face multiple opponents.

The knight may have the upper hand in strength, but Taesan excels in agility. So, he should get in close and create a situation where the knight cannot fully utilize his strength.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

The strength stat decreases significantly if you don't engage directly and create no space to apply strength, which increases muscular strength.

He was using the tactics he enjoyed in the past.

He staggers and sticks close again to the knight who is being pushed back.

He kicks to block the knight's attempt to swing the sword and instead kicks with his knee.

Taesan blocks with his foot.

Although he has the upper hand in strength, the difference isn't significant. He can suppress before proper acceleration.

"Is it easier than I thought?"

Taesan thought as he swung his fist. But it was expected.

This is the second floor. Even though it's the easy mode, it doesn't provide enemies that are impossible to clear.

The species of Laki Ratas may have stats that don't seem like those of an enemy on the second floor, but they didn't have the intelligence and sense to match it. Some balance was maintained.

The player, who was overwhelmed by overwhelming stats, barely manages to win by devising all sorts of methods.

That's the picture Laki Ratas wants.

But Taesan's stats are not low.

As he received additional rewards by seeing everything on the first floor and increasing his spiritual rise, he is not inferior to the species of Laki Ratas.
Here is the English translation of the text:

---

Even if he were a player just entering the labyrinth, given Taesan's stats now, he could engage in a fair fight. Taesan was already a player who had cleared the labyrinth.

He perfectly understood the countermeasures, so he could easily capture it.

And there was someone who didn't like that.

[Laki Ratas feels a slight confusion.]

Even though his species is a formidable opponent for a player on the second floor, Taesan was engaging in battle perfectly, without taking any damage after the initial encounter. It was something that would evoke admiration even in the eyes of a god.

But Laki Ratas is the god of struggle and death.

He doesn't want one-sided fights; he desires intense battles where those with lesser abilities weave victory through strategy, technique, and wisdom. That realm belongs to overwhelming and deceit.

After much deliberation, Laki Ratas made a decision.

He decided to return what he had taken.

To let the strong knight reclaim what he possessed.

[Laki Ratas's authority manifests. As a price, Laki Ratas's interference domain diminishes.] [Laki Ratas's species [fake] regains intelligence. Laki Ratas's species [fake] regains skills.] [Rewards from trials are greatly enhanced.]

"What?"


Here is the translation of the text:

---

Suddenly, Taesan frowned at the window blocking his view. A red light suddenly emanated from the dead eyes within the crimson helmet.

[You have encountered Laki Ratas's species.]

The label "fake" attached behind disappeared.

Clank.

The knight gripped the sword with both hands. Taesan tried to block, but he was in a lowered posture. In contrast, the knight stood fully erect. Being taller, his reach was beyond Taesan's grasp.

The knight swung down in the same stance as holding the sword. The tip of the hilt. The pommel aimed towards Taesan's head.

"Tsk."

If it continues like this, there's no longer a way to fight. Taesan withdrew. The knight raised the sword again.

A precise strike. It's difficult to block with all the force contained within. Narrowly evade.

Using the force of the downward strike, the knight thrusts forward.

Not swinging randomly as before, but a perfectly controlled thrust with full force.

With no room to dodge, Taesan pushes the sword back. The knight's sword clashes and twists the trajectory.

"Oh."

The knight twists his wrist. The knight's sword twists and begins to plunge under Taesan's sword. Despite trying to push it in somehow, it is perfectly blocked.

--- 


Here is the translation of the text:

---

The knight raised his sword as it was. 

Clang!

Already at a disadvantage in strength, Taesan couldn't resist the force pushing against him, and the sword moved in a direction where he couldn't properly resist. Taesan's hand, unable to withstand it, lifted significantly.

The knight moved his foot as it was. Taesan wrapped his body with his forearm. Taesan kicked.

"Ugh!"

[You received 12 damage.]

Since it was a foot and not a weapon, the damage wasn't significant. However, the kick disrupted his stance.

The knight didn't miss the opportunity. He quickly ran up and stabbed with his sword. Taesan rolled on the ground.

Kagak!

The sword struck the ground. It was stuck quite deeply, taking some time to pull out. Thanks to this, Taesan managed to create distance and regain his stance.

"Damn it. What's he trying to do?"

Taesan gritted his teeth.

The situation suddenly changed. Originally strong with high stats, and now with intelligence added, he became significantly stronger.

Above all, his skill level was extraordinarily high. Even when facing the sword directly, it was like being hopelessly deflected.

In terms of skill alone, he was superior to anyone Taesan had encountered.

As the servant of Laki Ratas's species, who had regained his intelligence, he aimed to carry out his master's orders. He dashed towards Taesan.
