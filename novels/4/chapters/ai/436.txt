Chapter 437

437. The 85th Floor, the Ash-Colored Woman, Sosiet Gardenia (5)

"With the contract with Sosiet, I will help you. I am Ehilly's apostle."

[Dersha changed the owner of the puppeteer.]

Bardley temporarily gained control over Sosiet, who had become Dersha's possession.

"That's mine. I won't let you have even a small scratch."

"I can't guarantee that. I'll try my best."

"Hmph."

Dersha chuckled and left Sosiet.

"Then, let's try again."

"Do as you please."

"Forced duels can't be used, it seems."

It's like doll magic. Forced duels can't deal damage unless the target is specified, but they can attack dolls or possessions without any issues.

"Sosiet."

Bardley said briefly. Sosiet, who had lost all will and only followed orders, drew a line in the air according to Bardley's will.

Whoosh.

The air split open. A space with a rough mixture of black and red colors appeared.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was no feeling inside. It was as if the space was just painted with colors.

But Taesan knew.

That was death itself.

Death was rushing towards Taesan. Taesan fiercely pulled up his divine power and spread it in all directions.

The divine power that collided with the dark red space let out a loud roar as they shattered each other.

And Bardley wasn't just standing still either. Bardley, who had gathered his strength, grasped his sword with both hands.

[Bardley activated his Divine Sword Union.]

Tat.

Bardley leaped forward.

His movement was incomparable to before. If Taesan didn't respond properly, he would be overwhelmed in an instant.

Ka-ga-gak!

Taesan blocked Bardley's attack. He dodged the rushing sword strikes, countered, and activated his skill.

[You activated your Slip Away skill.]

Slip Away, a labyrinthine skill that deflects the opponent's sword. Bardley also knew its effect from experience.

But Bardley didn't let up on his sword strikes.

Instead, he swung his sword even more fiercely towards Taesan.

There was no need to worry about the opponent's attack the moment Slip Away was activated. Just deflect the sword and counterattack."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan thrust his sword at Bardray.

As their swords were about to clash, the "Flow" ability was triggered, and Bardray's sword trajectory was distorted.

At that moment, Bardray's wrist moved.

His wrist, which moved very smoothly, forcibly corrected the distorted trajectory of his sword. There was no delay in the process. It was a sword technique that was almost divine.

Kaang!

The swords clashed.

Taesan created some distance first. Then, he charged towards Bardray, sword in hand.

[You activated "Strong Strike".] [You activated "Acceleration".]

The sword came crashing down.

Even if Bardray had become Ehilly's apostle, his stats were still overwhelmingly inferior to Taesan's. Moreover, Taesan had used Strong Strike and Acceleration. Bardray couldn't respond.

But Bardray didn't back down.

He moved his sword towards the descending blade.

Kaang!

At the moment when Bardray's sword, which had clashed with Taesan's, began to be overwhelmed by the immense power difference, Bardray's wrist moved again.

Kagakag.

The sword, which moved very smoothly, like a living being, slipped out of Taesan's grasp.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With overwhelming power and speed, he responded with just one technique.

"Tch."

Taesan bit his tongue and created distance again.

It was a technique that was impossible to achieve with the simple concept of wielding a sword well.

His opponent had become a god of swords, able to wield some of the divine power like other gods.

That was exactly the superhuman movement that Bardley was currently using.

Bardley charged at Taesan.

His sword was as sharp as a wolf's fang.

It was the first fang of the Storm Scar's wolf.

Kagakagak!

[You have activated Storm Dash.]

Taesan wildly swung his sword, responding to Bardley's attack with a storm-like movement.

It was impossible to win with just superior power and speed. Something different was needed.

[You have activated Counter.]

An automatic skill that responds to the opponent's attack and counterattacks. Counter.

Even if the user couldn't block the attack, it would block it for them.

Kagakagak!

Taesan's body moved, dodging Bardley's attack and striking back. He thrust his sword straight in.

And in that moment, Bardley's sword movement changed."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His sword began to pierce through Taesan's sword like a snake.

The second sword. The dance of the warrior.

In itself, it was enough to counter with a counterattack.

But that was only the case when dealing with the warrior's dance alone.

Bardray, like a wolf, fiercely pressured Taesan, and like a snake, pierced through.

In Bardray's hand, the wolf's fang and the warrior's dance appeared simultaneously. The automatic counterattack that could respond automatically began to fail.

Ka-ga-gak!

Taesan was forced to retreat.

[...Can the Storm Scar sword be used in such a way?]

The ghost couldn't hide its surprise. Bardray's swordsmanship had reached a level that even he, who had created the Storm Scar sword, couldn't imagine.

The god of swords. As Ehil's apostle, his swordsmanship itself had reached a higher level.

Ka-ga-gak!

In the end, Taesan was pushed back again.

The stats were overwhelmingly superior. The ability sword was at a higher level than the Storm Scar sword.

Yet, Taesan was unable to do anything against Bardray and was being pushed back.

'Is this the apostle of the god of swords?'
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The god who rules over the sword itself. His apostle possesses the power.

You cannot win with a sword. Then, you respond with a different ability.

[You have activated the Frozen World [Negation].]

A magic mixed with blackness is activated.

Cold air rushes towards Bardley.

Bardley, who was being pressured harshly, swings his sword with a stiff face.

The negation magic has the power to surpass all attributes.

Just like the power of the immortal Wirad was neutralized, Bardley also couldn't easily break through the negation magic. Bardley focused on blocking the negation magic.

And Taesan didn't miss that opportunity.

He quickly rushed in and stabbed Bardley's back. It was a perfect opening that couldn't be blocked even with a skill.

It was the moment when Taesan thought he had succeeded in his attack.

Bardley's body suddenly moved.

While blocking the negation magic that was rushing towards him, he turned his body and swung his sword towards Taesan.

It was a physically impossible movement, as if space was bending and the time axis was compressing.

Ka-ga-gak!

In the end, Taesan couldn't inflict any damage. Taesan scowled."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not just about handling one sword well."

Bardley charged forward and shouted.

"Sosiet!"

At the same time, a crimson death swept in.

What was embedded in Sosiet was Derusha's authority, the power to control death.

Taesan wielded his divine power to push back death. Sosiet's corpse swung its arm. The space cracked open, and numerous corpses reappeared. They all rushed towards Taesan at once.

They were different from the corpses he had faced initially.

Perhaps due to Derusha's authority, the corpses' movements seemed incredibly natural, as if they had a will of their own. They harbored malice towards Taesan.

[You have activated the Mana Storm [Abnormal].]

Kagagak!

A black storm shook the labyrinth.

The corpses were torn apart by the storm, but some of them endured and charged towards Taesan.

"This is tough."

In a situation where swordsmanship couldn't gain the upper hand, magic or dark magic, like Sosiet's, would be blocked.

I even thought of summoning Minerva, but this was a battle that transcended mortality. She wouldn't be of much help.

Taesan moved his body with a calm gaze.

* * *
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Kuaaaang!

The sword and sword clashed.

Death occurred, and it was pushed back by dark magic and divine power.

Taesan didn't stop.

He blocked all of Bardray and Sosiet's attacks and counterattacked. Bardray, who was pushed back, scowled.

"You're not getting tired at all."

Taesan's face didn't have a single drop of sweat, whereas Bardray himself was slightly out of breath. The difference in basic physical strength was much greater than expected.

"...And how many substitute skills do you have?"

With Sosiet's help, Bardray continued to target Taesan's weaknesses.

However, Taesan kept pulling out new skills to counter those weaknesses.

He hid his body in darkness, unleashed destructive power, or erased Bardray's attacks altogether.

No matter how hard they pressured him and created openings, he would always counter with a new card.

And Taesan was getting more and more accustomed to Bardray and Sosiet's movements. As time passed, it was becoming harder to expose his weaknesses.

To be honest, if Sosiet hadn't been there, the gap would have been so great that they would have lost long ago."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Bardley, with a scrunched-up face, put down his sword.

"What are you doing?"

There was a ghost in his gaze.

"I know I can't defeat you with my own strength. So I'll ask you. You, who have died. Why are you just standing there?"

Bardley looked at the ghost.

"If he dies, I'll be revived. I'll be able to clear the labyrinth again. And I'll be able to clear it."

That wasn't arrogance.

According to Taesan's judgment, Bardley's talent and skills were more than enough to clear the labyrinth.

"You must have been with him for a long time. You must know all about his weaknesses and the cards he holds. Tell me right now. Then I'll defeat him, and our wishes will come true."

[That's impossible.]

The ghost said calmly.

[Even if you clear it, your wish won't come true.]

"You're lying," Bardley denied flatly.

"If I clear the labyrinth, I'll be able to grant my wish. I obtained that information and entered the labyrinth."

[Clearing and conquering are different. No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to conquer it with your current abilities.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I don't believe what you're saying."

Bardley said sharply.

"Even if what you're saying is true, what's the point of that?"

Bardley pounded his chest roughly.

"I came here to save everyone! It doesn't matter if it's impossible! I won't give up! If I can't make my wish come true, I'll find another way, even if it means turning back time, to save my world!"

It was a declaration bordering on madness.

It was the cry of someone who would never give up on their wish.

[You're... really different from me.]

The ghost said quietly.

He too had once been like that. He would have sacrificed his own life for his wish. He would have abandoned his conscience without hesitation.

But the ghost had experienced many things with Taesan and had watched over him. His immature spirit had grown and had come to accept reality.

As a result, he had accepted his own failure.

[I'm not saying you're wrong. But I'm no longer like you. Your words don't reach me.]

"...You!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The face of Bardley, who had finished his preparations, was distorted.

Taesan straightened his sword.

Exirea and Ehili, the authorities of Dersha.

As a god's authority that manipulates the laws themselves, Taesan found it difficult to deal with.

So, he focused on defense and evasion rather than attack.

As a result, Taesan was able to grasp the overall power that Bardley and Sosiet were wielding.

'If they're not showing any special abilities even now, it means they've shown everything they've got so far.'

So, it's time to end this.

[You activated Baal's Black Space Collapse.]

Whoa!

The space, dyed black, surged forward like a wave. Bardley shouted roughly.

"Sosiet!"

The crimson death arose, colliding with the space collapse.

Neither side was pushed back, and they clashed fiercely.

Taesan added more power to it.

[You activated the Great Destruction [Rejection].]

Whoa whoa whoa!

Right now, Taesan was using the twisted spirit tuning to cast the rejection magic without partially changing the world.

And Taesan used the twisted spirit tuning to cast the completed rejection magic, destroying it in an instant."

Note: The translation may not be perfect, and some nuances may be lost in translation.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You activated the Magic Explosion.] [You activated Aegis's Shield.]

A dark sphere exploded, shaking the surroundings. Death was distorted and pierced.

Exposed to the aftermath, Bardley chose to dodge instead of defend. The power contained in the massive destruction was so immense that it couldn't be blocked without taking damage, so it was a wise decision.

However, as a result, the distance between Sosiet and Bardley grew farther apart.

Taesan grasped the air.

[You activated the World's Sword.]

Kugugung!

A massive sword appeared in Taesan's hand.

What was contained within was the world itself.

Taesan filled the sword with darkness and swung it towards Bardley.

Bardley hastily blocked it.

Kagagagak!

"Kuuuuuh!"

Taesan, who had sent Bardley flying, immediately charged towards Sosiet.

Sosiet tried to summon the corpses, but Taesan was faster. Bardley was focused on blocking the World's Sword and couldn't give orders quickly.

Pwhoosh!

Taesan's sword pierced Sosiet.

The power of Dersha, which was embedded within Sosiet, began to stir.

[How dare you wound my own.]

A voice filled with rage echoed.

Note: There are some Korean-specific terms and names that may not have direct English translations, so I've kept them as close to the original as possible.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was Derusha's voice.

[You didn't think you could touch the Overlord's belongings and get away with it, did you?]

At the same time, Sosiet's eyes widened greatly.

"Kyaah!"

A scream burst out. The power of Derusha that had been dormant within her burst out violently, engulfing Taesan.

It was the law of death.

[You have triggered the downfall of all things.] [You have triggered the negation of the law.] [You have triggered the exclusion of selection.]

Taesan also resisted with the Overlord's power.

However, what engulfed Taesan was the law of death itself.

No matter how hard he tried to resist or negate it, he couldn't escape. The law of death was determined to leave an indelible scar on Taesan's soul and body.

[Let's see you try to resist with your pitiful strength.]

Derusha sneered. The boundary that Taesan possessed could only be handled with a sword. Protecting his entire body was impossible.

However, Taesan spread his black aura throughout his body without any emotional change.

Taesan's proficiency with his black aura had reached 20%.

As a result, Taesan was able to handle his black aura a bit more stably.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It mixes divinity into black.

The boundary line created in this way wraps around Taesan's entire body.

Unlike the extremely unstable boundary repulsion, the boundary line wrapped around Taesan's entire body without a single gap.

The laws and concepts of the world begin to lose their effect on Taesan.

Death becomes distant from Taesan.

[……You!]

A voice filled with astonishment rings out. Taesan explodes the boundary line that wraps around his entire body. Sosiet's corpse collapses in an instant.
