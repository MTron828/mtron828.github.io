303. 67th Floor (1)

Unclaimed power does not reach Taesan. To put it extremely, such traps could never pose a threat to Taesan, and it wasn't limited to just traps.

Even in natural disasters, like the sea rising to swallow continents, volcanoes erupting to overturn the world, and the earth splitting to drop everything into chaos...

In cases where the world itself acts not out of its own will but merely as natural phenomena, as in Harfran's world, a single word could calm it.

The concept of 'command' meant projecting one's will onto the world.

Taesan advanced once more. Walls opened again, and countless traps sprung out.

"Clear them."

[You have activated the declaration of denial.]

Kugugung!

The traps vanish, crushed under Taesan's will. The ghost whistled.

[Impressive.]

Even the ghost was amazed. Taesan expended no significant amount of power. Even his mental strength, the sole cost of his command, seemed unaffected.
[Immortals or transcendents must have something like this... It's truly astonishing.]

"So they must have created a place like this."

"That's right."

As Taesan continued onward, he discovered a statue of the goddess.

He sat in front of it and offered a prayer.

"You prayed to the forgotten goddess. You have gained the blessing of the will of the goddess [Blessing of the Will of the Forgotten Goddess]. [Blessing of the Will: Blessing of the Forgotten Goddess' Will] [It's a blessing of the goddess. Your will becomes even stronger and firmer, not easily yielding even to great individuals. Yet it's still quite feeble as a divine blessing.]

Blessing of the will. Taesan tested it by invoking flames with his command. His headache noticeably diminished compared to before receiving the blessing.

Having obtained exactly the blessing he needed, Taesan smiled with satisfaction. With this, he has obtained three blessings of the goddess.

'Next is the profound one.'

As Taesan thought that and turned to leave, the system window appeared before his eyes.
Here's the translation of the text:

"Your repeated prayers have somewhat restored the goddess's sanctity." "Special quest initiated." "The forgotten goddess, forgotten even by herself, has had her sanctity somewhat restored by your repeated prayers. However, it is so faint that it cannot exert much influence in the world. As a goddess with the ego of a child, she wishes to regain her power." "Condition: Find someone who worships the forgotten goddess and restore her faith." "Reward: Complete blessing of the goddess."

"Well, that's how it is."

Taesan's eyes sparkled.

Repeated prayers. A goddess seeking herself and trying to regain her power.

It seemed that was the flow of the quest. Taesan checked the quest conditions.

'Someone who worships the forgotten goddess?'

The goddess had said she was forgotten by mortals and gods alike. It seemed unlikely that there were those who worshipped such a goddess.

The ghost spoke.

"It seems like a quest that can't be immediately fulfilled. Once the condition is met, the quest will progress on its own."

"In the end, it's profound."

First, the 71st floor. He had to get there.

And it wasn't long. Right now, he was on the 67th floor. Just four more floors up and he would reach the depths.

Taesan pushed the quest to the back of his mind and ventured outside again.

He pushed forward, defeating knights.

He searched for secret rooms, tidied up, and checked for any hidden elements. That's how Taesan conquered the 67th floor.

And just as everything was settled and only one boss remained, the quest window appeared.

"Special quest initiated." "Return to Earth."
*Special Quest Initiated* [Return to Earth.] [Several days later. You will return to the land you abandoned. Expand your territory in cooperation with others. Overcome trials and return to the labyrinth. Rewards will be determined based on achievements.] [This quest cannot be refused.]

Quest for Earth's Return.

In his previous life, Taesan recalled how long each return quest took.

"It's gotten faster."

"What has?"

"The time for return."

There have been a total of four returns so far. During those four times, they met people, gathered them, and gathered everyone in the country.

So far, the speed at which the return quests start has not differed much from the previous life. Therefore, Taesan could predict and prepare somewhat in advance.

And unlike the previous times, the fifth return from the previous life took place after a considerably longer interval. They speculated it was because the quest went on a global scale.
However, the fifth return quest appeared much faster than in their past lives.

With various variables different from their previous life, the return to Earth seemed to have sped up.

Taesan opened a community. Naturally, the community was incredibly noisy. It was so difficult to read the posts due to Koreans as well as Japanese, French, and Americans all chatting together.

[Taeyeon Lee invites you to chat.]

When Taesan accepted the invitation, he recognized some of the people in the conversation.

[Taeyeon Lee [Alone]: Oh, Mr. Taesan. Hello.] [Kim Hwiyeon [Hard]: Ugh, my head hurts. Isn't it too early?] [Amelia Erin [Alone]: ...Hello.]

Taesan responds vaguely to the quiet greetings. The same people who had gathered before were still there.

[Kim Hwiyeon [Hard]: Since everyone seems to be here now, let's discuss how to proceed with the quest.] [Oliver Kahn [Hard]: Even if we say that, we have too little information.]

Up until now, the quests had been conducted within one country. Predicting how the quest would progress wasn't too difficult.
However, from now on, it was a quest on a global scale. During that period, predicting such scope was nearly impossible.

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: Still, we must consider all possibilities. That way, we can be prepared.]

They began to discuss.

Taesan watched quietly without participating in the conversation.

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: Considering the flow so far, it's unlikely that all countries will meet at once. Only some countries will meet, right?] [Daniel D'Armond [Hard]: Should we only allow connected countries to meet? Or within a certain range?] [Oliver Kahn [Hard]: It seems it'll be by countries rather than a range. The sizes vary greatly by country to lump them into a certain range.]

In the case of the United States or China, it was similar to combining all of Europe.

[Ichijo Eika [Hard]: Quests so far have centered around each region, not size. Could it be the same this time?] [Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: If that's the case... ]

If so, then the countries Korea would meet were already decided.

[Kim Hwi-yeon [Hard]: It seems likely that Japan and I will meet.] [Ichijo Eika [Hard]: Probably so? Counting on you.]
The atmosphere wasn't bad. Kim Hwiyeon had already exchanged some words with Japanese players. There were few elements that could cause disturbance.

However, there were separate issues.

[Kim Hwiyeon [Hard]: If we're talking about meeting, it won't be just Japan. Maybe... including North Korea or China, right?] [Ichijo Eika [Hard]: That's a possibility.] [Keum Junggeun [Hard]: Chinese players using external communities. Has it never happened?] [Kim Hwiyeon [Hard]: Yes.]

There were communities where people from designated countries conversed, communities where people from all countries conversed, and communities exclusive to people from a particular country.

The Chinese community was very active. They exchanged information while conversing with each other.

But they never ventured outside their own community.

[Oliver Kahn [Hard]: Frankly speaking, it's chilling.]

As the quest expanded to the world, people were very excited. Realizing survival wasn't just about themselves, they hurriedly attempted to converse with people from other countries.
After the excitement subsided, some countries imposed restrictions on external conversations to prevent unrest, although very few did so and not forcefully. Occasionally, people from different countries shared various stories in integrated communities.

However, China was an exception.

Players from China had never once emerged from their own community.

Moreover, they ignored all questions and invitations.

A player's country focuses on where they were when summoned. While many players were American, there were also a considerable number of Chinese who grew up there.

Yet they refused all invitations and conversations, even those from family members.

[Oliver Kahn [Hard]: It's quite alien there. It could be tough if China gets involved.] [Kim Hwiyeon [Hard]: Well... we'll have to see.] [Ichijo Aika [Hard]: What about North Korea?] [Kim Hwiyeon [Hard]: Conversations don't even appear in their community. There must be someone alive there, judging by the existence of the community, but they say nothing at all.] [Oliver Kahn [Hard]: They must have their own challenges. We're not so different. They say cartels still thrive in Mexico, after all. It's a tough job to tidy up.]


They exchanged information, predicting cautiously. Even Taesan had questions.

[Kim Hwiyeon [Hard]: Taesan, do you have any expectations?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: Similar to you guys. Nothing particularly new.]

Taesan retained memories from past lives. However, he found it hard to believe things would flow as smoothly as they had in his previous life this time.

Too much had already gone awry. With the return timing accelerating so rapidly, various changes were sure to occur. Whatever he said wouldn't hold much weight.

So Taesan decided he needed to do what he had to do.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: How far have you guys descended?] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Junhyuk and I have just reached the 30th floor.]

The 30th floor. It was within Taeyeon and Junhyuk's expected range. But Amelia was a bit different.

[Amelia Eirin [Alone]: I'm on the 42nd floor.] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: Fast, aren't you?]

Taesan was slightly surprised.

The deeper into the labyrinth they descended, the steeper the difficulty rose. Of course, Amelia originally possessed strength that surpassed floor levels, so it wouldn't be too difficult for her, but the moment divine trials intervened, the story changed.
Amelia escaped the clutches of the God of Despair. While it meant her soul was liberated, it also meant she lost a significant portion of her power.

So, I thought there would be a delay in the strategy, but there was not much difference from before. Amelia retorted to Taesan's words.

[Amelia Eirin [Alone]: Who do you think I am? I am Amelia. The strongest player in America. Even if I don't have the support of a god, my strength will never diminish.]

After a moment of silence, Amelia added.

[Amelia Eirin [Alone]: ...Actually, you providing information and skills was the biggest help.]

Taesan chuckled.

What was on the 42nd floor? Taesan couldn't recall anything specific. After briefly recollecting, Taesan realized.

The 44th floor.

There resided the God of Despair.

So then, what is Amelia's despair?

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: Cheer up.] [Amelia Eirin [Alone]: Huh, huh? Thanks.]

Amelia responded in surprise to the sudden encouragement. After exchanging various conversations, Taesan logged off from the community.
The trials of God differ in content for each person. It wasn't the kind that could give information. Amelia could only hope to overcome it herself.

"A few days later, this is it."

Return to Earth.

The gods waiting there.

It will proceed in a completely different way from the previous life.

Until then, gather as much as possible and return. Taesan grasped the sword and began to break through the labyrinth once again.
