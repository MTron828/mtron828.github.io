Chapter 142

142. The 32nd Floor, the God of Swords, Ehillier (2)

Tae-san gazed at the ghost with a physical body.

His hair was a pure white color. It was straight and did not have any curls, and it fluttered softly whenever he moved his body.

His appearance was that of a typical, well-proportioned handsome man.

His clothes were extremely luxurious, as if they belonged to a prince who had proclaimed himself as such. However, they were not too formal and were suitable for easy movement.

"This is..."

The ghost, Badrey, was still breathing heavily. The golden eyes were filled with surprise.

"What, what mirror? Show me the mirror."

"Don't you know not to waste your time on trivial things?"

But there was something similar. Tae-san activated the ice arrow. He looked at his own face reflected in the ice and touched his cheeks.

"Ah."

Badrey's laughter echoed. It was a mixture of disappointment, joy, and various emotions that flashed across his eyes.

"This is it."

He muttered to himself, his expression filled with shock and amazement.

"I didn't think something like this would be possible..."

"Is that your body?"
(Note: The story seems to be a fantasy or supernatural one, and the translation may not be 100% accurate without more context.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, isn't it great? The girls look at me like I'm crazy when they see me."

Badrey spoke jokingly and chuckled. However, he was met with a stern expression from Taesan, who was not amused.

"Don't be too shocked. I'm shocked too."

"Is this a kind of trial?"

"Maybe so? Given what's been given to us."

Badrey was holding two spirit swords, which had suddenly appeared in his hand. He shook them lightly and said,

"Perhaps this is a temporary body until we pass the trial. Once we pass the trial, we'll return to our ghostly bodies. This is risky. We might not want to end the trial."

It's hard to say how many tens or hundreds of years it's been. The feeling of finding his lost physical body was evident from Badrey's expression alone.

"Still... I must fulfill my duty."

Badrey drew his sword towards Taesan.

Taesan also drew his two swords.

The conditions of the trial were confirmed through the system.

First condition:

Succeed in landing a single blow on an equal opponent as a ghost.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Let's just say that my stats are perfectly matched with yours. Compared to my peak strength, I'm a bit lacking, but this is not bad."

Badray said as he wielded his sword, and with each swing, the sword's trajectory became faster and more precise.

"This should be enough."

Whoosh!

The sword struck the air.

Since stats directly affect the body, it's normal for them to change suddenly and make it hard to adapt, but the ghost finished adjusting his body with just twenty sword strikes.

"My skills are also... matched with yours."

The ghost's sword was wildly shaking. Taesan knew that this was the dance of a demon, but he couldn't follow it. The movements of the wildly shaking sword were hard to grasp.

"I can only dance like a demon and use wolf fangs. The conditions are equal, just as explained."

"They don't seem equal at all."

Skill and stats didn't matter at all. The warrior in front of him was superior in swordsmanship.

"That's what trials are for, I suppose."

Badray laughed.

Taesan remembered the second condition: all skills unrelated to swordsmanship are prohibited.
He had to abandon his strongest card and engage in battle. "It's a bit disconcerting, but it's a good opportunity. You're still a master of the sword, and I'm sure you know exactly what you need."

Bardray shook the tip of his sword. "You can't just wait around. Come and see for yourself."

As Bardray had said, this ordeal would not end until the conditions were cleared. The correct answer was to do whatever it took, whether to kill or be killed. The moment the conclusion was reached, Tai Shan's foot landed.

The opponent was someone who had mastered the sword techniques. Unusual skills were of no use. It was from the very beginning, all-out.

The sword trembled and was driven like a wolf. Bardray was impressed.

"That's correct."

For him now, techniques like those were meaningless. He could crush everything and tear it apart. So, he would pour out all his strength from the very beginning. That was Tai Shan's choice, and it was a perfect answer.

"But being correct doesn't always mean success."

Bardray's hand trembled. It was very gentle, but also sharp.

The trajectory of the sword, like a dance, completely neutralized Tai Shan's sharp movements.
Here is the translation of the text:

Badrey thrust his sword at Tai Shan's shoulder. Tai Shan barely dodged and counterattacked on his side.

Badrey responded simply, grabbing Tai Shan's leg and restricting his movement, and then pushed him straight on.

Tai Shan's body was pushed back, stumbling and staggering.

"Still, there's no answer to this."

Tai Shan shook his sword in frustration.

Although their stats and skills were the same, the man in front of him was overwhelmingly stronger in terms of swordsmanship.

Tai Shan was Pavsha's disciple. Malsten had the same stats and skills as him, but he didn't even allow him to strike back, and was overwhelmed.

This was also the case. Tai Shan's swordsmanship was the same as Badrey's, which he had mastered in the past. The master and apprentice were like two sides of the same coin. Whoever was on top was clear. Even with skills, it was impossible to succeed in a single strike.

"Then I'll give up?"

"Nonsense."

Tai Shan kicked his foot.

* * *

Tai Shan challenged.

He changed his style, transformed his pattern, and twisted his movement to attack Badrey.

And Badrey blocked everything.

"That's not enough."
(Note: The translation is in Simplified Chinese characters, as per the RULES.)
Here is the translation of the text:

Badrei wielded his sword. Although the movement was simple and not very complex, it was enough to block all of Tai-san's attacks.

"That won't reach me."

Badrei struck Tai-san's vital point, and Tai-san let out a weak groan as he stumbled back.

Tai-san quickly recovered and charged at Badrei.

Badrei welcomed him with a smile.

This time, it was different. The movement of the sword was trembling. It was like a will-o'-the-wisp, completely different from the sword technique Tai-san had shown before.

"It's okay to change, but the foundation of this movement is the sword technique I taught you. I also gave you a similar change. Of course, I know the countermeasure."

Badrei easily deflected Tai-san's attempt.

"Really?"

Tai-san let out a sarcastic laugh.

No matter what Tai-san tried, Badrei perfectly blocked it. Malleset felt the same feeling he had felt before.

Badrei spoke calmly, without breaking a sweat.

"I told you, that won't work. We need something else."

"Be quiet, it's loud."

Tai-san pouted and narrowed his eyes.

"It can't work like this."

He mixed different variations of the sword technique he had learned from Badrei, combining them with his own skills.
Here is the translation of the text:

But it didn't all work out. Bader seemed to know everything beforehand, and he blocked it all with just a light movement.

Bader's proficiency in using his storm-scarred skills was 100%. It meant that he could perfectly wield his sword, whether it was a change in movement, a transformation in pattern, or any other derived from it.

"'I need something else.'"

Tai Shan closed his eyes. Bader smiled at the sight.

"'Still.'"

It took Tai Shan 100 attempts to figure out the answer. Some might say he was slow, but from Bader's perspective, it was ridiculously fast.

Tai Shan's innate talent was not exceptional. If someone said that Bader was more talented than Tai Shan, they could count dozens.

Of course, Tai Shan had talent, but it was at a level where he could find it with some effort.

However, Tai Shan had the ability to organize his thoughts and derive answers through experience, which was more remarkable than talent.
Here is the translation of the text:

Just by looking at the results before us, it was clear. Tae-san said that he was stuck at the 31st floor and couldn't find a way to go further. He said it was hard to move forward.

Of course, it was a natural thing.

The wound was from Bardray, not Tae-san's swordsmanship.

In the end, there was a limit to how far one could reach. The fact that he couldn't allow a single blow from someone with the same stats was evidence of this.

"'It's strong enough just like that.'"

If you train properly, focus on your sword, and drill deeply, you can reach a level where you can take on even the most skilled opponents.

However, what allowed Tae-san to come this far was not his swordsmanship, but rather his diverse skills. Swordsmanship was only a supporting role.

"'I'm no match for him with my sword.'"

He was someone who had mastered Bardray's sword perfectly. Even with the limitations of the skill system, his experience was unparalleled. Even if Tae-san tried hundreds of times, he wouldn't be able to reach him.

And it's the same even if Tae-san had reached 100% skill level.

After all, it's his swordsmanship that he has.

It's the swordsmanship he learned, developed, and perfected.
Here is the translation of the text:

It's impossible for someone else to handle the art of swords better than the creator, unless they are a genius on the continent. As for Taesan, he didn't have that level of talent.

"However, I can't just give up."

The black sword of the storm wound was already adapting to Taesan's movements. Giving up everything would be more difficult than starting from level one and reaching the current level.

So, it had to be swallowed.

Just like Malyster of old, he had to absorb the knowledge and transform it into his own.

Bardray waited quietly.

After an hour, Taesan opened his eyes.

His eyes were calm and gentle. Bardray smiled and nodded.

"It's done, I suppose."

"To some extent."

The perfect answer was not yet complete.

However, it seemed that they would be able to pass this trial.

[Bardray started creating the art of swords.]

Bardray eagerly waited for Taesan. Taesan cleared his mind and grasped the two swords.

The system window appeared suddenly, but Bardray cleared it all. Many information and rewards were revealed, but it was not important now.

This time, Bardray approached Taesan unlike before. Taesan responded as if waiting for him.
Here is the translation of the text:

The sword of Badrei was violently trembling. Although it was also a sword known to Taesan, the one that could not be blocked was hidden inside. Taesan had never been able to block it until now. The difference in skill was too great.

But this time was different.

Kagak!

Taesan and Badrei's swords clashed.

Badrei used the dance of the demon to move his sword smoothly, and Taesan also responded with the same dance. However, this sword strike was different from the previous ones. Although it looked similar to the dance of the demon, the aura hidden inside was completely different.

The dance of the demon is a technique that makes the direction of power curved and moves together with the dance, causing the opponent's sword to flutter. However, Taesan's current movement was more violent and reckless. The direction of power was not curved, but straight.

It was a sudden change, and such changes usually lead to bad outcomes, but this time it was the opposite. Badrei was unable to easily subdue Taesan.

"But... isn't it not that impressive?"

Badrei raised an eyebrow. It was a change that could be blocked if one made up their mind to do so. As a ghost appeared a little stronger, Taesan immediately began to retreat.

Kagak!
Here is the translation of the text:

The mud has splattered.

Tae-san had thought about it while closing his eyes.

The dark scar on the stormy wound is not his. Although his swordsmanship is outstanding, he cannot master it perfectly.

Just by looking at the battles so far, it's clear. He has used his swordsmanship effectively, but it's only as an individual technique, not in harmony with his other abilities.

He's different from a hero.

Swordsmanship is not his main strength.

So, what is his main strength? What does he believe in and why did he come here?

What should his swordsmanship be used for?

The answer was already decided.
