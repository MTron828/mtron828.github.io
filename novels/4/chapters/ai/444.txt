Chapter 445

445. 87th Floor. Ma Gyeong (2)

Vishnu's gaze towards Lee Tae-yeon was filled with intense discomfort and anger.

"How dare you..."

Lee Tae-yeon was a member of the Guide's faction.

The higher-ups, who had recognized her talent when she encountered the Guide, allowed her to reach the deeper levels.

They judged that if she was with them, she would be a great help to their clearances.

In reality, Lee Tae-yeon did not disappoint and descended through the labyrinth without any obstacles, meeting their expectations.

However, at some point, Lee Tae-yeon suddenly changed.

She transformed into a completely different person, actively and rapidly clearing the labyrinth at a speed that surpassed even the higher-ups themselves.

The sudden change left the higher-ups bewildered, and they investigated Lee Tae-yeon, but they couldn't find anything special.

The contract between Maria and Lee Tae-yeon was a future contract. At present, she was just an ordinary mortal receiving Maria's attention.

As a result, the higher-ups concluded that there was no particular issue with Lee Tae-yeon.

They were simply delighted that she had blossomed her talent and would be a great help to clearing the floors.

But just as they were about to enter the 70th floor.

The moment they seriously asked for Lee Tae-yeon's cooperation, Lee Tae-yeon didn't listen to their words.

She claimed she would act alone.

Vishnu said coldly.

"You're acting like you have a god behind you, aren't you?"

Of course, they were going to punish the traitor.

But when all the high-ranking officials gathered to deal with her, they realized.

The goddess of choice, Maria, was behind Lee Tae-yeon.

Maria, who had quietly descended, said briefly to them.

[This child is mine.]

At her words, they couldn't do anything. Vishnu, recalling the memory of that time, gritted his teeth.

"You were a very cunning little rat. A dirty traitor."

"Hmm, it's not betrayal. You just don't understand."

Lee Tae-yeon snorted. She didn't show any fear, even with them in front of her. She was very calm.

Vishnu furrowed his brow.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She remembered the first time she met Lee Tae-yeon. Even at their casual conversations, her body would tremble and shrink back. It was the same when they met a few times after that.

But suddenly, she became extremely confident.

They thought it was because Lee Tae-yeon had received Maria's support.

However, Vishnu's thoughts, who had faced him directly, were different.

Lee Tae-yeon had changed not only in his actions but also in his personality, completely transforming.

It was a change that couldn't be explained simply by the fact that a god was protecting him.

"It doesn't matter."

Vishnu muttered, and flames erupted on his arm. The air in the labyrinth grew hotter.

Vishnu wore a fascinating smile.

"In the end, your god didn't protect you. You will face death."

Maria, who had descended, made a proposal to them.

[But it wouldn't be in line with the labyrinth's purpose to let them retreat like this.]

One of the reasons the labyrinth was created was to witness the mortal's desperate struggle for survival.

[So I'll make a proposal. I'll allow a battle between one of you and my child.]

And there, Vishnu was chosen.

The flames began to dominate the labyrinth.

Vishnu's face was extremely confident.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Although she hadn't yet broken through the 74th floor, she had stayed in the depths for a long time and had cultivated a lot of power. On the other hand, Lee Tae-yeon had just descended into the depths and was still inexperienced.

Vishnu was confident of victory and said,

"Well, then die. Traitor."

"I'm not a traitor!"

Lee Tae-yeon, who was grumbling, drew his sword with a serious face.

[Vishnu activated the avatar of nature.]

Vishnu was the first to move.

Flames erupted.

A blaze like a tsunami engulfed Lee Tae-yeon.

It was impossible to block it perfectly. Lee Tae-yeon quickly judged the situation and jumped out of the way.

Vishnu quickly controlled the flames, chasing Lee Tae-yeon like a living creature and blocking her path.

The rising heat slowly drained her physical strength and blocked her breathing.

The world began to be dyed with flames.

"She's definitely strong."

Lee Tae-yeon licked her lips with a tired face.

In her past life, she hadn't fought against the executives from the start. Instead, she had pretended to be their ally, secretly clearing the floors and escaping. So, she didn't know exactly how strong they were.

It wasn't until this life that she realized it.

The executives were monsters.

But she had also become a monster.

Lee Tae-yeon's eyes sank.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Your strong heart has been activated.] [Your weak will has been activated.]

She faced the flames that were rushing towards her and drew her sword.

[You have activated "Flowing".]

Whoosh!

The flames wrapped around her sword. Vishnu's pupils grew larger.

"......You?"

"Let's do this properly."

[Itaeon activated Porus's transparent darkness.]

Itaeon's entire body was covered in a transparent color.

"Black magic!"

Vishnu was shocked. A human, Itaeon, was using black magic.

With the clearance of the Taesan's Earth Quest, the people of the earth gained the ability to wield magic. But Vishnu, who didn't know this, was greatly flustered.

"But!"

However, a few low-level black magic spells wouldn't have much of an impact on the battle. Even if Itaeon hid her body, it was just a simple appearance. Her location could be easily grasped at any moment.

Itaeon also knew this well.

So, she targeted Vishnu's weakness.

Kugugugukung!

The flames exploded and rushed towards them. The power was distorted, confusing their vision and senses.

"Now."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You activated the hidden shadow.] [You activated the breath of the hidden rat.]

Vishnu's eyes trembled.

She momentarily lost track of Taeyeon's location.

It was as if she had really disappeared.

Whoosh!

"Kkkk!"

So, she allowed the sword to pierce her own chest.

Vishnu unleashed a flame that pushed Taeyeon back. Taeyeon retreated calmly.

Vishnu fiercely unleashed a flame again.

The battle resumed. Taeyeon blocked Vishnu's attack and opened her inventory.

[Taeyeon activated the rainbow-colored vision disorder powder.]

It was a consumable item sold by the shop owner.

The scattered rainbow-colored powder distorted their vision. Vishnu's face contorted as she released a flame to blow the powder away.

And Taeyeon seized that moment.

[You activated the hidden shadow.] [You activated the breath of the hidden rat.]

Vishnu unleashed flames in all directions. Taeyeon dodged the flames and stabbed Vishnu's stomach again.

"What the...!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Vishnu burst out laughing, spewing out flames wildly. But Lee Tae-yeon was already far away.

The hidden breath of a rat.

One of her main skills.

It was difficult to acquire in her current life, but after risking her life on the 71st floor, she was finally able to obtain it.

Although her proficiency was lower than in her previous life, where she could perfectly hide her body even from the monsters of the high gods, and there were skills she hadn't acquired, she had to take advantage of the opportunity. But that alone was enough.

"......You're a real rat, aren't you?"

Vishnu suppressed his wounds and let out a cold cry.

"You're a rat who hides your appearance and only targets others' weaknesses. Do you think you can break through the depths with that kind of method?"

"Yes."

Lee Tae-yeon replied.

Lee Tae-yeon had an unwavering confidence in her eyes, as if she had seen the future.

Vishnu was unknowingly shaken by that gaze.

"......Don't laugh!"

Vishnu gritted his teeth.

She had momentarily lost track of Lee Tae-yeon's presence.

But that didn't mean she was defeated. She still had many cards she hadn't used yet.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The flames gathered around her, and the gathered flames turned white.

"Behold! This is my world, permitted by the King of the Spirit Realm!"

The white flames burst forth, engulfing the space.

[Vishnu activated the King's World.]

The space was rewritten, and the laws of the world were distorted, changing the air.

Iteayeon realized.

This place, the 72nd floor of the labyrinth, had transformed into Vishnu's world.

"No matter how you hide, I'll burn the entire world! You can't escape!"

"Ugh……."

Iteayeon bit his tongue.

"Did Taesan win against this? How did he do it?"

This was Vishnu's true intention.

Vishnu, who had activated the King's World, was absolutely unbeatable in her current state.

The skill created a gap so vast that even if you fought a hundred times, you would lose every time.

Iteayeon was genuinely impressed.

"Incredible."

"Die, you rat!"

Vishnu was about to engulf the world in flames.

[Iteayeon activated Selection Exclusion.]

The flames that had engulfed the world went out.

The activation of Vishnu's King's World was erased.

"Well, I guess I don't have to fight then."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"......Ah?"

The world of Vishnu's king is undoubtedly powerful.

But even so, it's just a mortal's skill.

If it were a god's authority, I could erase it without any resistance.

"Is this enough?"

[You have activated the 100th possibility.]

You are judging the 100th possibility.

The answer that comes out is that she loses all 100 times.

"Even if I seal the king's world, I still lose? Is the gap still that big?"

[You have activated the 100th exclusion.] [You have activated the 100th possibility.] [You have activated the 100th exclusion.]

The skill continues to activate.

It doesn't stop, repeating more than 10 times.

"......What is that skill?"

Vishnu, who barely escaped the shock, stuttered and asked.

The 100th possibility?

It was a skill that he had never heard of, and its effects were unimaginable.

Lee Tae-yeon answered.

"A skill that even Taesan couldn't possess, my own skill."

"Taesan?"

Vishnu didn't know about Taesan's existence. Lee Tae-yeon shrugged his shoulders.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There's such a monster. Right now, it's too expensive to use because it consumes too much mana and mental power, so I can't use it much."

So, after progressing through the battle to a certain extent and blocking the card of despair, I used it.

Twenty-four possibilities out of a hundred were activated.

A total of 2,324 possibilities were judged.

1,242 defeats.

1,081 draws.

One victory.

I found the answer.

Itearyn opened her inventory. Her hand was holding a gray powder.

"Then, let's try again. Your Majesty, the Spirit King."

Itearyn charged towards Vishnu.

* * *

[You activated magic overlap.] [You activated great destruction.] [You activated great destruction.] [You activated great destruction.] [You activated magic release.]

The overlapping magic is released.

The condensed sphere sweeps across the battlefield. In an instant, thousands of monsters are wiped out.

[Your level has increased.]

But new monsters fill the space in an instant.

Taesan's face is pale as he summons his magic.

[You activated Baal's dark space slash.]

The darkened space rushes forward, erasing the monsters once again.

$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$For ten days, Tae-san had relentlessly battled to conquer the 87th floor.

As a result, he had defeated most of the monsters residing here.

However, the cleaning up was not over yet. It had tired Tae-san to the point of exhaustion.

'There was no skill worth obtaining.'

It was just an expansive battlefield, and the monsters that appeared were mostly brutes, utilizing only their raw power.

Under such ordinary conditions, Tae-san had already obtained almost all the skills he could.

Nonetheless, with the multitude of monsters, he could harmonize with Bardray and enhance its movements. Most importantly, he could increase Bardray's attack power.

[The Prince of the Ruined World: Bardray] [The prince of the ruined empire, Cabert's prince, Bardray. He was reborn with a sword as his flesh and blood.] [Attack Power + 2596]

Depending on the opponent's strength, the increase in attack power changed, and considering the countless monsters he had defeated, the increase was not that significant. However, it was still an increase of nearly 100 in attack power, which was quite satisfying.

There was not much left now.

And at that moment, a transmission from the President arrived for Tae-san.

"Here it is."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It was the former Western District of Halfra.

The content written inside was simple. It was a message telling him to come to himself, now that the arrangement was complete.

It meant that the preparation to modify the ring he had requested was finished.

There was no need to hesitate any further.

Taesan broke through the 87th floor at an incredible speed.

[87th Floor Cleared.] [Obtained the Dark Snake Fragment, which had been tainted by darkness.] [Obtained???.] [Dark Snake Fragment] [A snake that had settled deep in the abyss was carved. No one knows who carved it or what it was carved with. However, despite being a simple carving, it contains a power that is daunting to even gaze upon.] [Used???.] [Obtained the Deeply Slumbering Golden Ring.] [Deeply Slumbering Golden Ring] [Health +3000] [Mana +500] [Strength +500] [Agility +500] [Attack Power +300] [Defense +300] [A ring that once shone with a light similar to the sun, but has now been tainted by darkness and fallen into a state of chaos. The power within it has been mixed with darkness, becoming extremely turbid.]

After checking the rewards, Taesan went up to the next floor.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"His footsteps were faster than usual.

Taesan arrived at Half Ran's smithy.

Although he looked extremely exhausted, Half Ran, with sparkling eyes, was waiting for him.

"I'm here. The preparations are complete. Let's start right away.""

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
