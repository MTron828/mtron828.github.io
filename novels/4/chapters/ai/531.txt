**Chapter 532**

**532. 95th Floor. Essence (6)**

Numerous skills and powers are changing and evolving.

And Taesan has arrived.

Complete. In his own domain. At his own level.

"Phew."

Taesan took a short breath. The unstable atmosphere that had been wavering just a moment ago had suddenly stabilized.

Taesan looked around.

The scenery had changed completely. The distorted form that he had broken down himself had transformed into something new, expanding and solidifying.

It was not just a simple scenery, but a perfect, complete world.

"Good."

[……You.]

The usurper was stiff, his voice filled with denial.

[Don't laugh.]

Ka-ga-ga-kak!

The boundary line appears. The gray, unbalanced energy rushes towards Taesan, trying to destroy him.

[You are me. You are mine.]

"It was like that before."

Taesan snapped his fingers.

"But it's not like that now."

Ka-aa-ang!

The boundary line created by the usurper disappears. The unauthorized power within Taesan's domain is expelled.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The usurper was no longer his split self. The fundamental power of the spirit had collapsed, and something entirely new had emerged, covering the contamination that had shrouded his mind. It was as if the contamination had been completely covered by Gang Taesan himself.

It was just a simple foreign substance.

Then, that foreign substance had to be removed. Taesan grabbed Bardley.

Whoosh.

The boundary line enveloped Bardley.

Originally, the boundary line was a power that mixed the sacred and black colors. Naturally, it required summoning the sacred and black colors first and then mixing them.

But this time, it was different.

From Taesan's body, the boundary line burst out directly. It was as if it didn't need to be mixed anymore, and it was Taesan's power itself.

The quality and intensity of the boundary line itself were also distinctly different from before. The boundary lines he had handled until now seemed like simple fakes.

And most of all, it was natural.

Like manipulating his limbs, the manifestation of the boundary line was smooth. The manifested boundary line flew towards the usurper like a dark energy.

The usurper quickly summoned his own boundary line. But its color and quality were perfectly different from Taesan's. The two different boundary lines collided.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

And what broke was the usurper's boundary line.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Without any resistance or pause, the boundary of Taesan trampled and crushed everything in its path. And then, it swallowed the usurper whole.

The usurper's entire body was dyed in a dark, ashy color and buried.

Taesan gazed at the sight for a moment, then lifted its foot. The ashy color trembled on Taesan's foot.

And as it stepped on the ground, Taesan's body suddenly turned into ash.

The figure reappeared right above the usurper.

[Huh?]

Bardley was shocked by the sudden spatial movement. Taesan didn't care and trampled the fallen usurper.

The boundary rose up. It was very natural, but also thick and heavy.

It burst out in hundreds, thousands of directions, pounding the usurper's entire body. The usurper tried to resist, but Taesan trampled and crushed everything.

Crunch.

In just a few seconds, Taesan completely subdued the usurper.

"It can't be destroyed like this. I still have many questions for you."

When had the usurper started targeting him?

How had its corruption been achieved?

When had it started to recognize Taesan as its enemy?

While it was possible to make some inferences, there were still many uncertain parts. Taesan intended to get answers to these questions this time.

[...How pitiful.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The usurper suddenly became quiet. The disturbance and confusion subsided, leaving only a sense of regret.

[I thought I could finally achieve my long-cherished desire... but it's not that easy. There's nothing I can do. It's frustrating.]

"Enough of the small talk."

Taesan exerted strength in his legs. The usurper's body began to break apart, and his energy scattered like fog.

"Would you please give me an answer?"

But the usurper didn't respond.

He just said what he had to say.

[It's regrettable, but I'll have to take the orthodox approach now.]

The usurper laughed. He looked like Taesan, but his laughter was infinitely distorted.

[Step on your own body and erase your mind to usurp it.]

At the same time, the usurper exploded.

The remnants inside him began to scatter in all directions. Taesan was shocked. He tried to catch the scattered things according to his master's will.

But he couldn't block them all. They dodged and weaved, spreading out.

Taesan waved his hand in frustration.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The boundary line is happening. Unlike before, it perfectly follows the control of Taesan, and like a hunting dog chasing its prey, it grasps the bursting concepts.

Kwaaa!

But the remnants overcome the boundary line and accelerate. Taesan's face contorts.

"Is this the descent?"

Unlike before, a high and distorted power is felt. It's unclear what method was used, but it seems that the usurper has temporarily descended directly.

Taesan tries to pull out the boundary line and capture the usurper.

And in that moment, Taesan realizes.

What he has been holding inside is truly trying to reveal itself to the world.

Gasp.

The beast lets out a cry, wailing as if it wants to escape from us.

It's enormous and thick.

More so than anything Taesan has seen before.

"Ugh."

Taesan unknowingly suppresses his power.

The unobstructed remnants gather together and accelerate violently.

Zzzt!

The wall of the mind begins to shatter.

The will to escape from here and scatter its own filth throughout the universe is revealed.

And outside, Essential is waiting. He sits with his legs crossed, gazing at the mirror with a vacant expression.

"How will this turn out?"

A quiet voice whispers.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Honestly, he was also half-doubtful. There was something inside Taesan. And it was either equal to himself or a higher being.

Originally, there wouldn't be a problem. That place was Taesan's inner world, where he could wield absolute power.

But Taesan was a distorted, essential being that couldn't be grasped.

Due to its uniqueness, even the essential couldn't be certain of Taesan's victory.

'If there's no problem, that's good.'

He waited for the situation to settle with an anxious heart.

Suddenly...

'...Huh?'

The mirror cracked.

In an instant, Taesan, who had thought he could settle everything and come out, realized something strange.

From the crack, a clear, divine energy was felt.

'How dare you!'

Essential hastily activated its fundamental authority. It tightly restrained and sealed the mirror.

But the crack didn't stop.

Crack, crack, crack!

It twisted all authority and control, and finally burst out of the mirror.

Kwagagagang!

And it revealed its form.

Essential gritted its teeth.

'Thief!'

[It's been a while.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The plunderer responds in a quiet voice. With a chuckle, they surpass the Essential and fly beyond the universe.

The Essential has activated its authority. The power that grasps the essence itself tries to grasp the plunderer. But the plunderer lightly places their hand on the authority.

Ka-a-a-ang!

The Essential's power is plundered and shattered. The Essential is enraged.

"Damn it!"

And so, the plunderer advances, eventually reaching the boundary of the universe.

[Then, take care.] [Shut up.]

A nervous voice rings out. The plunderer bursts into laughter, exploding with joy.

And the noise erupts.

A massive sound that those of lower ranks cannot even perceive. But those of higher ranks can clearly hear it, no matter where they are in the universe.

The boundary shakes the universe, leaving a massive scar.

Along with the boundary, the concept of this world is also mixed in.

With the permission of the concept, a massive rift begins to form in the universe.

Ki-ki-ki-ki-kik!

With an indelible scar, the other side reveals its form.

A massive scar appears on the boundary facing the gods.

Tzok-tzok-tzek!

Gold spreads, and a gap appears.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And beyond that, distorted beings gaze at him.

"......Damn essence!"

Essential, who quickly grasped the situation, let out a string of curses.

The balance of the universe begins to waver.

* * *

Quadruped.

Taesan, who had sorted everything out, stepped out of the mirror.

And what Taesan saw was a broken universe.

The boundaries were distorted and collapsing. He could sense the presence of beings that seemed to be watching from beyond.

"What a mess."

"I'm out."

"What happened?"

"Well, it seems like we both have a lot to talk about."

Essential sat down with a wry smile.

"Let's hear it first. What happened?"

"It's nothing much."

Taesan explained calmly, telling Essential about the events that had taken place in his mind.

Essential stroked his chin after listening to the explanation.

"So that's how it was... I knew there was something inside you, but I didn't think it was involved that deeply. But that's strange. How did you win?"

"I threw it away."

"Threw it away?"

Essential asked again, his face showing that he didn't understand.

"Threw it away means you threw away yourself?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The realm I had reached."

"......Huh."

Essential let out a sigh of amazement.

"That's... incredible."

Essential was a transcendent being who governed the concept of essence.

To him, essence was more important than his own life. He would rather choose death than give it up.

Taesan had abandoned it without hesitation. The fact that Essential was purely amazed by this.

"Still, thanks to that, I've changed a lot."

"Many things have changed."

Essential was finally able to see Taesan properly.

He was the god of essence. He had a deeper and broader understanding of the concept of essence than anyone else.

"You're......"

But even Essential couldn't understand Taesan.

"It's stabilized."

That was the first feeling he had.

"There was distortion before. A twisted, unfindable cause that had ruined your foundation. But now, that distortion is nowhere to be seen. What did you do?"

"I've become whole again."

Essential let out a dry laugh.

"Incredible."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not impossible.

The concept of the Transcender was distorted and broken, and there were cases where it was emptied and refilled. Although it was difficult to find from the birth of the universe, it wasn't nonexistent.

However, it was an extremely difficult task.

To abandon what one had devoted their entire life to and refill it anew was unthinkable. Even if one was a Transcender, they couldn't withstand the mental exhaustion and wavering of their spirit during the process, and it was a futile effort.

Taesan, who had been preparing for a long time and had a strong sense of determination, tried to overcome this challenge while fighting against powerful enemies, and succeeded without any problems.

"Where have you reached now?... I don't know either."

It was impossible to determine whether Taesan's current level was higher or lower than his Essential self. Even though Taesan had become whole, it was still impossible to read him. It had become even more impossible to read him.

"Can I take a look for a moment?"

"If you'd like."

Essential, who had received Taesan's permission, activated his power. The gaze that read the essence of the universe tried to read Taesan.

"...What is this?"

As a result, Essential was confused.

It was impossible to read. Not a single thing."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

When he used his powers sincerely, he could read his opponent's mind, even if they were a high-ranking official. Although it was impossible to delve deep into their innermost thoughts, he could grasp their surface-level thoughts and approximate their power level.

But Taesan was an exception.

Literally, he couldn't read anything. It was as if he existed yet didn't exist at the same time. He couldn't gauge his power level or strength at all.

The fact that the fundamental god couldn't read him meant that there was no being in this universe that could understand Taesan.

"......You need to understand yourself. I don't know either."

"I'll do that."

Taesan nodded his head. It wasn't surprising, as he had half-expected it.

"Thank you. For giving me myself."

If Essential hadn't given him the concept of self, it would have been extremely difficult for him to fill the void within himself. Essential chuckled.

"There's no need to thank me for the reward of your actions. I didn't know you'd handle it that well, but..."

Essential smiled in satisfaction.

The story had been told roughly.

Now it was his turn to ask.

Taesan gazed beyond the universe.

There, a massive rift existed.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Energies that seemed to belong to the gods were seeping out from the cracks, swirling and spreading.

And multiple transcendents appeared. They were trying to use their powers to block the cracks, but it wasn't working properly.

To fix a broken dam, you need to empty out everything inside first. But that was impossible.

"What was inside you was a usurper. It has escaped to the outside."

"I knew that."

The gods descended. Although it was an incomplete descent, the gods themselves appeared in the universe.

"But there's no reason for it to be like that."

The gods were already being expelled. Even if a single god were to come now, it wouldn't be able to do anything about the boundary that had already expelled the gods.

"That's how it should be. But... if the transcendents of this world intervene, the story changes a bit."

Taesan immediately thought of a transcendent.

"Essence."

"You damn fallen god. What are you trying to do?"

Essence clicked her tongue."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's an event that happened too suddenly, so for now, we also have a lot to confirm. Let's go back to the labyrinth for now. We'll talk after we've organized everything."

"Alright then."

Taesan nodded his head. The condition of the quest was to see the essence. Taesan had cleared it perfectly.

[95th Floor Quest Complete.] [Obtained a stable integer.] [Obtained ???.]

And Taesan returned to the labyrinth.

The wizard was nowhere to be seen. He must be very busy. It wasn't bad for Taesan either.

He had reached a new level.

Even Taesan himself didn't know where he was. If the God of Essence couldn't understand, no one would.

What had changed, and where had he arrived?

He needed to properly understand what was going on.
