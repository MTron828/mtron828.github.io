**Chapter 529**

529. 95th Floor. Essence (3)

The first thing Taesan felt was discomfort.

The air itself felt like a damp, murky swamp.

An unpleasant sensation overwhelmed his senses. He had just entered his own subconscious. It was his own.

But Taesan was not at all comfortable.

Taesan looked up.

What he saw was a distorted, unrecognizable world filled with twisted forms.

It was his subconscious.

Halfren, Amelia, and Essential were saying something.

[……Is this your subconscious?] [This is…… strange. It doesn't feel like our master's.]

"I know," Taesan replied lightly.

This subconscious was corrupted.

"Is this me?"

But he was not whole.

Taesan took a step forward.

He delved deeper into his subconscious. No matter how far he went, all he saw were distorted, corrupted forms. Bardley felt a sense of rejection, and Akasha let out a sigh.

He was contaminated.

"I knew that from before. The words of the Transcenders that they had said to him came to mind.

['The power you possess is unaffected by time, and you still have it.'] ['You haven't reached Transcendence yet. You don't have your own domain.'] ['But your power isn't affected by the flow of time.'] ['And that power even surpasses the strength of the Immortals and the Noble Ones.']

Maria had said that to Taesan. You're somehow wrong. The power you possess is beyond my understanding.

['Why couldn't you surpass mortality in your past life?'] ['You should have surpassed mortality there. It's only natural.'] ['But the spiritual growth you achieved then is still with you even after time has turned back. And with that, you can even surpass the power of the Noble Ones and the Immortals, and even the Transcenders.'] ['What made you like that? What twisted you like that? I'm searching for the answer now, but... it's not coming easily.']"

Note: The translation tries to maintain the original tone and nuance of the text, but some phrases may have been rephrased for better clarity in English.

"And the wizard said. You were originally supposed to surpass mortality. Even if you reached the realm of transcendence, it wouldn't be strange, and you had achieved enough accomplishments and possibilities.

But it didn't happen.

Instead of surpassing mortality, Taesan acquired a distorted skill called 'Spiritual Ascension'.

A mystery that had remained unsolved until now.

Now I can understand.

It's the divine power.

Those things had a deep connection with Taesan. I don't know when it started, but Taesan had been tainted by them.

Feeling an affinity for the divine power and being able to wield black magic must be because of that.

But still, the mystery remained.

How could he control the boundary line?

The boundary line has nothing to do with the divine power. They can't use the concepts of this world. Only Taesan had the ability to mix and wield sacred and black magic.

I can solve many mysteries here.

Taesan continued to move forward. As a result, Taesan was able to see one vast land.

It was not tainted.

It was a very small land, just big enough for one person to enter, but it was undoubtedly a part of this world. The surrounding taint couldn't even invade that land.

[What is this?]"

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It must have been what I had before I was contaminated."

A mental image from the time when I was an ordinary human.

Although it was very small and weak, it managed to maintain its position even in the midst of contamination.

This made one thing certain.

His contamination did not start from his birth.

It happened later.

Then, when did it start? It wasn't difficult to guess.

Moving forward again, a small land disappeared, and soon many things got mixed up and destroyed.

And as I moved forward, I could feel it.

The things that were covered up were getting bigger and thicker.

It was a time when his mental image was growing and becoming stronger.

It was probably easy mode. He polished himself there. As he grew mentally, it was natural for his mental image to grow accordingly.

It was just distorted and destroyed, so I couldn't know its original form and what its foundation was.

Taesan continued to walk.

His mental image kept growing. The distorted forms, which were once the size of a small building, soon transformed into mountain-like sizes.

And in the end, Taesan could see it.

Note: "Taesan" appears to be a proper noun, possibly a name or a place, and I've left it untranslated. If you have more context or information about what "Taesan" refers to, I'd be happy to help with the translation.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A massive aggregation. A massive and dense something.

The current Taesan is an unattainable, lofty, and great destination.

It's not a simple mortal realm. Taesan knew that.

'...Transcendence.'

Even Taesan, who grasped the concept of the world as an individual, couldn't reach the end.

That was the place.

'Is this it?'

That was the realm he had reached in his past life.

But its form was infinitely distorted and corrupted.

It wasn't originally like that.

It would have become something radiant, more magnificent than anyone, forming the concept of the world.

Yes. It was like the words of the transcenders.

But the corruption crushed that possibility and made it into something entirely different. That was the possibility he lost, and the destination.

Taesan approaches the corrupted form and raises his hand.

What was it before it was corrupted? He tries to grasp and read it. He closes his eyes, focuses his senses, and observes his inner self.

'...'

But it's impossible."

Note: "Taesan" appears to be a proper noun, possibly a name or title, and I've left it untranslated.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Even though it was his own mind, he couldn't grasp or read his greatest thought. It was as if a canvas had already been tainted with mud, and a picture was drawn on top of it.

"I'm the owner, aren't I?"

Taesan muttered to himself and let out a sigh.

Taesan continued to move forward.

After that, something changed. Although it was distorted and broken, it became somewhat familiar and readable. The sensation grew stronger as he moved forward.

Thud.

And Taesan reached the end of his mind.

There was a being there.

[...What?]

Bardley was taken aback for a moment.

This was Taesan's mind. But there was a completely different existence inside him.

No, it wasn't entirely different.

Because it looked exactly like Taesan.

Except for its entire body being ash-colored and fluttering, it was perfectly identical to Taesan.

[Ah...].

Akasha's body trembled for a moment. She had no proper memories, only fragments remaining except for her name.

But despite that, Akasha felt fear.

A primal fear was etched into her instincts. Bardley was bewildered, and Akasha was frightened. And Taesan took a step forward.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was inside him, but it wasn't his. That thing was overflowing and spreading its dark color, engulfing its surroundings, but Taesan didn't know.

It lifted its head and looked at Taesan.

Their eyes met.

[You have encountered.]

The system couldn't write a name for it, nor was it a name that was broken like the gods' and couldn't be read.

It was just empty.

And Taesan had seen this empty system several times before.

"When did it start following me?"

There was no answer. Taesan didn't expect a response, so he didn't mind and drew his sword.

"Is it a plunderer? Or something else?"

It gazed at Taesan with a dull expression.

And its mouth opened.

[It's a shame.]

A somewhat languid, yet greedy voice. It was also a tired, old man's voice.

It was the voice that was heard when the essence was about to awaken.

[If I had just waited a little longer, it would have been complete.]

It stood up from its seat. The dark color overflowed and covered everything.

Taesan scowled.

"That thing."

That dark color was somehow familiar."

Please let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

In that blackness, there was the energy of the apostles and gods that he had defeated so far. He had devoured and wielded it, so it was impossible to know.

The power in front of him was being handled as if it were his own.

[But even now, it's a tempting fruit.]

The darkness enveloped his opponent. And Taesan saw it.

In that darkness, there was something mixed from this world.

But it was different from Taesan. It was mixed, but it didn't form a perfect boundary like his. It was just an imitation.

He spat.

"Usurper."

The heterogeneous existence that had taken root within him.

The usurper. There was no other god who could imitate the things of this world except the usurper.

The fact wasn't particularly surprising. It was something he had already predicted. There was no other god who could defile him except the usurper.

But he didn't know that it had penetrated so deeply into him.

How did the forced arrival reveal the bottom of the blackness that was pulled out?

The reason was simple.

It was because the usurper's blackness was pulled out.

[You are mine.]

A quiet voice echoed in Taesan's mind.

* * *

Kwaaaang!

An explosion occurred.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan burst out of the darkness, defeating the usurper's blackness.

[What the...!]

Only then did Bardley unleash the emotions he had been holding back.

[What the...! Why do you have something like that inside you!]

"I don't know, so don't ask."

Whoosh.

The boundary line rose up and surrounded Bardley. He swung his sword wildly.

Zzzt!

The blackness was shattered.

Taesan narrowed his eyes, sensing the power he felt.

"It's not the usurper himself."

The power he sensed was not that great. At least, it wasn't the original self that had taken residence within him.

It was unlikely that such a being could secretly take residence within Taesan.

"Is it a split spirit?"

The usurper's split spirit lightly swung its finger. The created boundary line became a wave, sweeping away Taesan's consciousness. Taesan also pulled out a boundary line to confront it.

Quadruple crash!

It broke and crushed. Taesan was puzzled by the sensation he felt through his hand.

"It's stronger than I thought."

He knew there was something inside him, but he thought its strength would be insignificant.

The reason was simple.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Taesan didn't realize that there was something inside him until he reached a certain level of enlightenment and looked into his own heart.

The same was true for the Transcenders. They saw Taesan's distortion, but they didn't know the exact reason. Even the highest-ranking Transcenders, such as Mashin, the wizard, and Maria, didn't know. Only those who had directly seen into his heart had noticed the existence of the Usurper.

The Transcenders were too weak to understand. That was what Taesan had thought until now, but the power the Usurper was showing was far beyond his expectations.

"I don't know what it is."

Why was it lodged in Taesan's mind? Why did it have such power without being detected? He didn't know anything, but one thing was certain.

It was an enemy of Taesan.

It was his enemy.

Then, there was only one thing Taesan could do. He gripped his sword tightly.

Let's take it down first and think later. The darkness seeped into Taesan's hand.

[You have activated Chaos Call.]

The boundary of the realm surrounded Taesan. It was a distorted power that only Taesan possessed, beyond the concepts of this world and the gods. There was no one who had resisted this power until now. If there was, it would be crushed by an overwhelming amount or quality."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Taesan infuses his entire body with power and charges forward. The distorted boundary lines shatter simultaneously, creating a path towards the usurper.

And the usurper stretches out his arm.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

The boundary's domain begins to split. Taesan's pupils enlarge.

The usurper is blocking his sword with his arm.

The problem was that the arm that was wrapped around it was not the distorted boundary line, but just a ordinary black sword.

It was extremely compressed, but not an enormous amount. Even now, Taesan could easily handle it at a very ordinary level.

But he couldn't penetrate it.

It wasn't a problem of simple quantity or quality, nor was it a conceptual issue.

It was a more fundamental problem.

[You're mistaken.]

Gasp.

The usurper grasps his sword. The boundary line splits sharply, but can't inflict a wound on the usurper's hand.

Smell. The distorted things that spread throughout the mind begin to move. It was as if the usurper was the owner, with a free and unrestricted movement.

[I am you.]

And the mind that arose begins to devour Taesan.

[You are mine.]"
