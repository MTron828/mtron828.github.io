22. 2nd Floor, Buried Ones. Ghost of the Warrior (7)

The objective is hunting goblins.

Now, there's no need to be cautious. Taesan's stats have skyrocketed absurdly by capturing the breed of Lakyratath. Passing through the corridor, Taesan arrived at the door and kicked it.

Bang!

Four goblins looked at him in surprise.

"Kiiik!"

[A goblin with a bow appeared.] [A goblin with a spear appeared.] [A goblin with a spear appeared.] [A goblin with a shortsword appeared.]

Taesan calmly drew his bow. He shot a paralysis arrow towards the goblin with a bow.

[12 damage to the goblin with a bow.] [The target is paralyzed. Unable to move until the next attack hits, or for 30 seconds.]

"Kkiik."

The goblin spasms, pulling its arm and stiffening. Three left. Taesan drew his sword and shield.

"Kaaak!"

Taesan pushed with his shield.

[6 damage to the goblin with a shortsword.]

"Kkiik!"

Although pushed lightly, the goblin staggered back three steps. Two goblins with spears thrust their weapons towards Taesan.
I see everything.

Agility enhances peripheral vision as well.

Taesan parries the spear on the left with his sword.

The goblin couldn't withstand the force, and the spear flies away.

He deftly avoids the remaining goblin's spear and stabs its neck.

"Kieek."

[12 damage to the goblin with a spear.]

The goblin with a shortsword finally rushes in. One goblin with a spear rushes to pick up the thrown spear.

A one-on-one situation. The goblin desperately swings its spear.

[You activate a counter. You retaliate against the next attack.]

You naturally evade and stab your opponent.

[30 damage to the goblin with a spear.] [You have defeated the goblin with a spear.]

"Keuk, Keaek."

The goblin dies from two attacks. He's much stronger now than when he first entered the 2nd floor. The goblins are no longer a match for him.

What he's confirming now is evidence of his struggle.

[Your evidence of struggle has been activated.]

For a moment, clarity returns. Taesan's face brightens with a clear sense of relief.

"Oh?"
In a maze, skills that reduce mental fatigue are exceedingly rare. Even if they exist, they are so weak that they are hardly noticeable. Despite having ample physical stamina, there were frequent occasions when rest was necessary due to mental fatigue.

However, evidence of struggle clearly showed a decrease in fatigue.

Furthermore, there was an increase in stats. Taesan opened the status window to confirm. All stats had increased by 1 point each.

His movement speed had also increased. Taesan moved his hand to verify.

"About 5%?"

On top of that, his mana had been fully restored. Against goblins, this meant he could continue using counter skills without mana depletion.

It was quite advantageous. Even when surrounded by many enemies, if he managed to kill one, he could then go on a rampage.

As long as the battle continued, it was a skill that significantly reduced the likelihood of defeat.

"Kieek!"

He dodged the shortsword aiming diagonally and grabbed the wrist. He pulled the goblin towards him and thrust into its belly.

"Kaaak!"

He swung his shield at the charging goblin with a spear, knocking it away. Then he thrust into its belly again.

[You have emerged victorious against the goblin with a shortsword.] [Your evidence of struggle has been activated.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"Once again, everything speeds up. Taesan dashes towards the goblin holding the thrown spear. The goblin panics and tries to stab with the spear, but Taesan easily deflects it with his shield. The spear flies off.

"Kieek!"

14, 14, 13.

[You have emerged victorious against the goblin with a shortsword.] [Your evidence of struggle has been activated.]

The swift battle ends. Now the goblin, holding a just-unfrozen bow, was unsure of what to do. Taesan advanced confidently.

The sword moves. Damage figures appear.

"Kieeee......"

[You have emerged victorious against the goblin with a bow.] [Your evidence of struggle has ended.]

The lingering strength in his body dissipates. It was enough to feel a momentary sense of helplessness.

"Quite good?"

In summary, it was mental recovery, an increase in all stats, enhanced speed of movement, and restoration of health and mana.

It had too many effects to be attributed to a single skill. Considering that most acceleration skills typically possess only one of these effects, Evidence of Struggle was by far the most comprehensive acceleration skill Taesan had encountered.

There were no restrictions. There were no limits.

As long as the premise condition of continued combat was met, it meant endless fighting.

It was a skill that could become a main skill depending on the situation.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Moreover, in such lower depths, where monsters often swarm, it proved to be quite useful.

Skills worth acquiring are certainly not easy to come by.

"It packs quite a punch."

They were different from Dwarves or Ainzhar. While they acknowledged Taesan's abilities, they were cautious about giving something in return, fearing it might lead to complacency.

However, Rakiratas provided rewards worthy of their achievements.

Taesan finished confirming and began organizing the rewards.

Intelligence increased by 4 points due to the reward. It was a consistently beneficial increase.

He checks the gold. 200 gold in total, with 50 gold each. Equipment consists of one dagger and two arrows.

It's decent but still lacking. Taesan gripped his sword and headed down the corridor.

* * *

He roughly deflects arrows shot desperately and approaches. He bends the goblin trying to cry out.

"Keeek!"
Here is the translation of the text:

"[13 damage to the goblin with a bow.]" "[You have won against the goblin with a bow.]" "[Evidence of your struggle has ended.]" "[Your level has increased.]" "[You have reached the best condition.]" "[As a reward for leveling up, your health has increased by 15.]" "[As a reward for leveling up, agility has permanently increased by 2. Strength has permanently increased by 2.]" "[Your skill '영격 상승' has been activated. Intelligence will permanently increase by 1.]"

Taesan wiped the blood off his sword.

"Maybe this will do."

He searched six rooms. After defeating twenty-four goblins, he leveled up.

"Status window."

[강태산] [Level: 7] [Health: 205/205] [Mana: 22/22] [Strength: 29] [Intelligence: 39] [Agility: 42] [Attack + 7] [Defense + 7] [Target is in the best condition.]

The increase in intelligence stood out more than other stats. Originally, it should have risen higher, but it seemed to hit a limit, failing to surpass the wall at 40.

Still, it was a significant increase. Without the activation of the skill, he would have barely reached the fifth floor.

He also earned a lot of gold. 1,200 gold. Selling duplicate weapons could bring it up to 2,400 gold. Besides just earning money, he acquired useful equipment.

[해진 발목 보호대] [Defense + 1] [Seems to block minor attacks.] [해진 가죽 갑옷] [Defense + 2] [Seems to block moderate attacks.]
Taesan didn't pay much attention to it, but defense was essential for players. As they increased it, they could reduce absolute damage received, leading some to focus solely on raising defense.

He cleared six rooms, totaling nine rooms so far. It was about time to finish the second floor. Before that, Taesan planned to visit the shop.

As Taesan returned to the shop, the dwarf greeted him with a puzzled expression.

"What's up? Why are you back again?"

"I'm looking to buy equipment."

"Equipment? You think I'm going to sell you something better than your current weapons?"

The dwarf's face stiffened as if finding it strange.

"…Ah, the cursed weapon skill. Damn it."

"Can you show me some accessories then?"

The dwarf hesitated, not showing any accessories on the floor above. He worried that offering such benefits might prevent Taesan from overcoming the labyrinth.

But accessories were not included there. The dwarf sighed deeply.

"Fine. You should be fine, I guess. Take these."

The dwarf reluctantly opened a space, and numerous accessories spilled out. There were well over fifty items. Taesan whistled and began checking each one.

"I'll pass on the stat necklace."

Normally, he would have grabbed it first. Stats applied regardless of where they were worn.
However, as long as there was an increase in attack power, it wasn't all that important.

What Taesan was going to pick up now were accessories for attack power or defense.

Among them, Taesan noticed a necklace made of iron.

[Iron Cross Necklace] [Attack Power +1] [A necklace worn by those who worshipped the god of war. It seemed useless, but they believed it protected them.] [600G]

Contrary to its description, it was quite useful to Taesan. He opened his inventory and took out duplicate equipment.

"How much will you give me for these?"

"...Did you bring all of these?"

The dwarf checked with a weary look at the pile of equipment.

"It should fetch around 1400 gold. Selling them all?"

There was no reason to keep things that just filled up the inventory. Taesan sold them neatly and received the gold.

2,600 gold. A quick calculation showed he could buy four more accessories.

Taesan held the Iron Cross Necklace and continued to look for more.

As a result, he found three more pieces of equipment that were just right for him now.

[Rusty Bracelet] [Attack Power +1] [Feels like it'll break if you hit something.] [600G]
Here is the English translation of the text:

Literally, something would be blocked or shattered into pieces with a bracelet to deliver a shock. However, Taesan didn't need to use attack power alone, so it didn't matter.

[Jing-Embossed Gloves] [Attack Power +2] [Protects hands. Seems like it can hurt enemies a bit more.] [900G]

An upgrade to the martial artist's gloves. The word 'more' has been added as a modifier.

[Sharp-Ended Leather Boots] [Attack Power +1] [If aimed at the end, can hurt a bit more. Seems useless for defense.] [500G]

"I'll take these."

In total, 2600 gold. It was exactly what he had.

"Alright. Take 'em."

Taesan quickly equipped the gear, checked his attack power.

[Attack Power +11]

Now, even against goblins, at worst it's three hits. With good aim, he could handle two hits. A counter blow would be a one-hit kill.

He had clearly become stronger than before. Eye-lock technique. A really good skill. Taesan was satisfied, but the dwarf grumbled.

"Satisfied?"

"For now."

"You damn old man. Why'd you give him that? Now there's nothing left to buy. Go quickly."
The dwarf waved his hand dismissively. Though he seemed somewhat dismissive, Taesan was already quite satisfied. Without any further response, he headed towards the labyrinth.

"Well then, see you next time."

"Let's meet on the next floor, shall we? Hm?"

Taesan didn't respond to the earnest voice.

As Taesan returned to the labyrinth and wandered around, there were no goblins in sight. He cleared nine rooms. It meant he was close to encountering the boss.

As Taesan strolled through the corridor without much thought, a distinctive door caught his eye.

There was an orange door in front of Taesan.

"What's this?"

The boss room has a red door. Taesan had never seen an orange door before. He racked his memory, but even Itaeyeon hadn't mentioned it. Since she avoided places she deemed dangerous, there were gaps in her information.

It's a different kind of room.

And such rooms are where rewards are given.

Taesan opened the door. Inside were two goblins. They were impressively armed with neatly fitted leather armor and unblemished swords.

"Kyaak."

"Krrk."

They looked at Taesan and drew their weapons. Unlike the goblins he had encountered so far, they didn't rush in immediately but remained wary of Taesan.
[Elite Goblin. Atlock has appeared.] [Elite Goblin. Genesis has appeared.]

Named monsters.

They were guarding a small grave.

[You have discovered the grave of a warrior.]
