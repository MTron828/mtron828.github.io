**Chapter 494**

494. 92nd Floor. Faith (5)

Karak lets out a loud roar.

With a face filled with anger, he charges towards Taesan. His fist contains Karak's full power.

"Is this the authority of physical strength?"

Taesan, facing the immortal's power, lightly sticks out his finger.

The swung fist hits the finger. A massive shockwave sweeps through the surroundings, causing the onlookers to scream in terror.

"Ah……."

But Taesan doesn't flinch at all.

Karak's fist is blocked by Taesan's finger and cannot move forward. Despair appears on Karak's face.

Taesan simply flicks his finger.

Karak's body flies backward like it was hit by a cannonball.

"Woah!"

"Lord Remidos!"

Those who were slowly raising their heads let out a shout of amazement at the sight. Their faith in Taesan grows even stronger in the face of absolute power.

"Get up."

"Uuuuuuuuh!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Karak endured the pain and barely got up. He had an unyielding spirit and determination to fight, even against a strong opponent. Taesan smiled, seemingly satisfied with his appearance.

Taesan took a step forward.

In an instant, he moved behind Karak and swung his sword.

Karak hastily defended himself with his fists, but his defense was crushed. Karak fell to the ground, helpless.

The crowd's cheers grew even louder at the sight.

Taesan approached him again.

"Ha!"

Karak hastily protected himself, but Taesan grabbed his arm and threw him away.

Taesan was a transcendent being.

To him, the immortal Karak was nothing. He could easily suppress him with just a word.

However, Taesan continued to give Karak room to respond, applying only a light pressure. The more people saw this, the more their faith in Taesan grew.

Karak's face twisted in anger.

"What are you doing? Stop toying with me and kill me! Don't mock me!"

"No."

Taesan replied lightly. Karak let out a loud cry and charged at Taesan.

Kuuuuung!

The battle continued, with Taesan clearly in the dominant position. Karak desperately resisted, but his efforts were futile, like a three-year-old child's tantrum.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

People gaze at that figure with a dazed expression.

And after several tens of minutes.

Taesan, who had made up his mind, put strength into his legs.

He charges towards Karak. Karak tries to protect himself reflexively, but the ash-colored sword pierces through Karak's chest.

"Kuhhuhu!"

"Well done."

"This, this can't be. I...…."

Kwaaaang!

The ash color explodes.

Karak dies without even leaving a last word.

"If you treated the people of the world as toys for your faith, you should have been prepared to die like that."

Taesan says calmly. The surge in his aura does not activate. It's because the difference in their auras is too great.

But Bardley and Akasha were different.

[Hmm.] [This is...….]

The power of the immortal seeps into Bardley and Akasha. The two let out a small groan under the intense power and aura.

The people who followed Taesan gaze at him in a daze. They belatedly realize that the immortal who had controlled them has died.

"Ohhhh!"

Their faith explodes.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The faith that was wavering a little has now become complete, facing the great mountain. The great mountain's realm has reached an unprecedented height in an instant.

[The proficiency of divinity has increased by 3%.]

The great mountain has now become the god of this planet.

The one who has grasped divinity opened his mouth.

"I will leave you now."

"Ahhhh!"

"Lord Remidaos, please don't leave us!"

"Don't worry. Soon, my true representative will come. He is the one who was once your king, but was banished by the corrupt ones."

"Ahhhh..."

"Lord Remidaos..."

The people regained some composure.

Whether they would accept the shop owner's words was unknown, but that was a part he had to take responsibility for. The great mountain activated teleportation.

"I will always be watching over you."

[You have activated Teleport [Chaos].]

The great mountain disappeared, shrouded in ash. The people wept bitterly. They continued to send their faith towards the great mountain for several hours, standing in the same spot.

* * *

The great mountain, having left the planet, immediately moved to another planet.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$That planet was no different from the first planet, with the exception that humans lived there instead of dwarves.

The besieged undying one. Remidios, who has been gaining people's faith by appearing in their dreams and claiming to save them from the besiegers.

Therefore, the peak also used the same method as the first planet.

"I am Remidios."

Leading people by calling himself Remidios, gaining their trust, and dealing with those who besiege them.

In this way, slowly leading people, the peak approached the undying.

"Fool!"

But this time was different. The undying waited confidently for the peak.

"Daring to touch us! Word has already been sent to him. You also seem to have reached a great level, but he is far greater than you! You cannot... ."

"You talk too much."

The peak drew his sword. The undying swiftly leaped out of the way as the peak quickly approached.

"You!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan showed people his overwhelming power, just like on the first planet. And when it reached its peak, he finished it off.

"Ah, I will regret this!"

The immortal faced death with a distorted face.

"Oh!"

"Lord Remidaos!"

People's faith turned to Taesan. They believed him to be Remidaos, and their long-accumulated faith was sent to him.

Taesan became a god on another planet once again. Bardley said, as if it was unbelievable.

[Was it supposed to be this easy?]

"The conditions were all met, that's why."

They were already being oppressed by someone, and they believed in someone within that oppression.

Taesan simply stole the faith that had already been built up in the middle. There was no reason for it to be difficult.

"It's not like it's supposed to be this easy, but... there's no harm in it."

Taesan immediately moved on to the next planet. The third one was the same. Taesan accumulated faith from them and went to find the immortal.

This time, the immortal's reaction was different. He backed away, his face twisted in despair.

"Why! Why aren't you moving! Your things are being stolen, and why are you silent!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He didn't show any signs of surrender. It was as if something was wrong, and he couldn't help but keep running away.

Of course, Taesan didn't let him go.

The Immortal, even as he was dying, had a face that couldn't understand why, rather than resentment towards Taesan.

"Why, why..."

The Immortal fell like that.

The people's faith exploded and surged towards Taesan.

[The proficiency of the Divine has increased by 2%.]

Taesan gathered the faith of three planets like that.

His divinity began to change, becoming more solid and stable.

Taesan went to find another planet just like that.

As soon as he arrived, a powerful force ambushed Taesan. Taesan lightly flicked his finger, and the forces that attacked him were torn apart and disappeared.

"Heh heh heh!"

"Kill him!"

Four Immortals revealed themselves.

They attacked Taesan with desperate faces.

"This time, I'll take the initiative."

It didn't matter. He was receiving even more faith, and his divinity was becoming more stable. Whether a few Immortals attacked him or not, it made no difference to Taesan.

Taesan lightly waved his finger. A black figure appeared in the world."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The black color gradually faded away, and eventually transformed into a formless energy.

Taesan hurled the worthless thing at the immortals.

The worthless thing was extremely small, about the size of an insect, and didn't seem to have any presence. The immortals didn't pay much attention to it and tried to erase it with their powers.

But the moment they touched it, they realized something was off.

"Eeek!"

"Wait, just a moment!"

They were shocked and tried to shake it off, but the worthless thing clung to them even more, rendering the immortals' powers meaningless.

Fear appeared on their faces.

All their accumulated strength and prestige, which they had built up until now, became meaningless. Everything disappeared and was erased, becoming worthless.

They struggled to shake it off, but couldn't. The worthless thing slowly consumed them, erasing everything they had.

"Ugh, disgusting."

They felt a fear greater than death.

After flailing about for a while, they realized they had no way out and begged Taesan.

"Please, please... we're begging you. Please..."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You're not going to kill me now. You need me to stay alive."

Taesan retrieved his useless sword.

It seemed that the immortal being, who ruled over another planet, had moved to this location to stop Taesan.

"It's meaningless anyway."

The immortals were sprawled out on the ground, twitching.

"Why... why, Lord Remidaos..."

"Does the transcendent being not move?"

"I informed him, but... he's silent... why... why..."

The immortal muttered with a dull expression.

"I don't know."

Taesan shook his head.

"Why is it so quiet?"

Remidaos, the transcendent being who received the planet's worship.

He was clearly watching over Taesan.

He must have seen Taesan steal his worship and kill his underlings.

But he didn't take any further action.

Taesan's original plan was to steal the worship before Remidaos noticed, and when Remidaos moved to stop him, to reveal his true identity to the people and shake their faith.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, Remidao didn't show any movement. Thanks to that, he was able to gain numerous believers, but it was too quiet. It was as if Taesan's goal was to steal away the faith of others.

Perfect reconnaissance can obtain all information, but there are clear limitations. It is impossible to acquire information above a certain level.

Therefore, Taesan couldn't know what Remidao was aiming for.

"I don't know, but..."

There's no reason to refuse if he's not going to stop. He'll take everything he can get. Taesan had captured the immortals.

* * *

Taesan traveled around the planets.

With the captured immortals in tow, he told people, "I am Remidao, and I have come to punish them."

People believed Taesan was Remidao and worshiped him.

After a long time had passed, Taesan received faith from all the planets.

"Phew."

He took a deep breath. The powerful aura, the lofty faith, settled within Taesan. His divinity was seeking perfect stability. Bardley and Akasha had also obtained great power.

Among them, Akasha's change was particularly noticeable. Akasha was constantly letting out small, stifled cries, as if something was stuck.

"What's coming to mind?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Something... something is holding me back. Just a little, just a little more is all I need...]

Akasha was still lacking. Taesan was the same. It seemed that they couldn't reach the realm of a complete transcender with this much, as if something was blocking their way.

"It's too short."

It was because they had built up their faith too quickly, and therefore hadn't reached the realm of a complete transcender yet.

But aside from that, there were no difficulties. The process of building up faith was too easy, to the point of being tedious.

The reason was clear.

Taesan gazed at the white star beyond the universe.

He was currently in a state where someone had stolen the faith that had been built up.

However, the original owner of the faith didn't show any movement.

While the faith of all the planets that worshiped him was being stolen, Remidao didn't budge. It was as if the owner of an empty house had left the door wide open, inviting theft. There was no reason to be anxious.

"What do you want?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I've already accumulated all the faith I need. So, I'll go directly and confirm it myself. For the purpose of achieving the quest, I'll head towards the one who originally received the faith.

Taesan stretched out his hand into the void. The space split apart, and Taesan leaped across the space."

Note: "태산" (Taesan) is a proper noun, likely a character's name, so I left it untranslated.
