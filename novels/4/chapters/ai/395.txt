Chapter 396

396. 79th Floor, the Struggle Floor (2)

[What's the point of this? Even the wizard has abandoned his post. What do you want me to do about it?]

Balbambara let out a sigh.

"Does your head hurt?"

[It's because of someone, but I can't blame you, even though I want to.]

He let out a groan.

[You've become immortal. It means you've already achieved the goal the labyrinth desires.]

"I don't plan on stopping here."

There was still much to gain. Just because he had become immortal didn't mean he would stop.

[That's right…….]

Balbambara's words trailed off. Taesan was trying to head down to the 79th floor.

But Balbambara blocked the passage, refusing to budge.

Taesan stared at him with a puzzled expression.

"What's going on?"

[I'm torn. Should I let you go down or make you stop here?] [What's going on? Are you trying to stop me from going down to the labyrinth?]

The ghost was shocked. The administrator was blocking the adventurer's progress. It was unprecedented. Balbambara spoke in a rough tone.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"This is something that shouldn't happen in the first place. My job is to maintain the labyrinth and reward adventurers. Stopping adventurers isn't my job, but... the current situation is too unusual."

Balbambara gazed at Taesan.

The emotions in that gaze were extremely complex.

"You've reached a certain point. Going any further would be contradictory to the labyrinth's purpose in a sense."

The labyrinth was created by the gods to observe the mortal struggle for survival.

It was never assumed that an immortal would clear the labyrinth.

It was only natural. Among the beings that tested adventurers, there were also immortals. An immortal giving trials to another immortal was a ridiculous concept.

"Ainz Ooal Gown seemed to be clearing the labyrinth with enthusiasm."

"He made a contract with a wizard. He can move freely within the labyrinth, but he can't gain any systemic advantages. He can't receive rewards even if he clears a floor, and his level won't increase either. It's a necessary procedure for an immortal to enter the labyrinth."

Balbambara was an administrator.

He was in a position where he had to resolve and fix the labyrinth's anomalies.

Taesan was the anomaly itself.

But he couldn't help but worry.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The problem was how they reached the pinnacle.

Those who had surpassed mortal limits while breaking through the labyrinth had mostly done so through a contract with a god.

Since their souls belonged to the god, they could no longer be called adventurers. They were naturally excluded from the labyrinth.

However, Taesan had reached immortality through his own power while breaking through the labyrinth.

The question was, what to do with someone who had surpassed mortal limits through their own power.

It was an unprecedented event. There had been a few who had reached immortality, but it had always happened after clearing the labyrinth.

After much contemplation, Balbam decided on a course of action.

"First, let's go down. We need to call a wizard to find an answer."

Balbam stepped back, and Taesan descended the stairs, opening his mouth.

"Do we need to stop him just because he's become immortal? It's not like it was any different when we easily cleared the previous floors."

The ordinary floors had already been unable to stop Taesan's progress.

Unless it was a special floor like God's Trial, he had easily overcome them all. He thought that becoming immortal wouldn't change anything."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When you reach the 79th floor, you'll understand the reason. I'll tell you in advance, but do it moderately. The reward will be paid in full under my authority."

Balbambara disappeared with an answer.

As Taesan went down the stairs, the shop owner was there.

"I finally got it. What should I buy...?"

He was saying this while smoking a pipe, but when he saw Taesan, he shut his mouth.

The pipe fell from his mouth with a clinking sound.

"...You."

"Hello."

Taesan greeted him calmly. The shop owner stared at Taesan blankly.

"...You've arrived."

"That's right."

"Ha, haha! Hahahahaha!"

A bright smile burst out, filled with genuine joy. His eyes sparkled as he showed his teeth.

"Yes! You've reached that point! If that's the case! I! I!"

He was excited and his face turned red.

The lost king, filled with all sorts of emotions, shouted.

"I can fulfill my wish!"

His voice echoed loudly in the small room.

The shop owner, who had expressed his emotions, regained his composure and put the pipe in his mouth again.

"So, what do you want to buy?"

"Not yet. I haven't gathered enough gold."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Then let's see later."

He said with a smile.

Taesan passed by the shop owner.

[...Was that guy's wish related to the immortal?]

"Do you not know what it is?"

[You said so. The shop owner didn't like me because I couldn't fulfill my own wish. If it's related to the immortal, it might be possible.]

The ghost was strong, but it was within the bounds of a mortal. The ghost let out a dry laugh.

[Why did that guy create a labyrinth from the start and get stuck here? He needs an immortal. What kind of wish is that? No, if it's like what Balbam said, isn't it impossible to fulfill from the start?]

"Hmm."

You'll find out if you go down. He still hasn't reached the level the shop owner wants.

Taesan passed through the corridor and opened the door.

It was incredibly vast.

It was more like a vast plain than a labyrinth. And there, numerous lives were moving about.

"This is the 79th floor."

The world of struggle.

There's only one thing to do here. Prove your own strength.

Note: "Balbam" seems to be a name or a term, but I couldn't find any information about it. If you have more context or information about it, I'd be happy to help further.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taeyun had spent a long time on the 79th floor, one of the floors that took a long time to clear.

There were countless beasts here. They killed each other, stole each other's power, and grew stronger. And among them, the strongest being ruled over this 79th floor.

This was a place where you had to defeat a certain number of beasts or fight the king of this place to prove your strength.

Of course, Taeyun intended to clean up everything, despite what Balbam said.

He grasped his sword and took a step forward. In an instant, his body disappeared.

And then, he stopped in front of two beasts engaged in a desperate struggle.

One was a black dog with three heads, spewing flames from its mouth and melting everything around it.

The other was a being with a snake's lower body and a human upper body, with snake-like hair, similar to Medusa. Its entire body was covered in wounds, as if it was determined to kill each other.

They suddenly stopped fighting when they saw Taeyun appear.

"Bring it on."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan waited calmly for their attack. He was thinking of making a rough assessment.

But no matter how much time passed, they didn't attack Taesan.

They just stood still, like statues.

Taesan scowled. At that moment, the dog lowered its posture.

"Woof, woof."

The dog lay down on the ground, exposing its belly.

It was a posture of absolute obedience. Medusa was no different. It trembled all over, slowly approaching, and desperately lowered its head.

[...What's going on?]

"What's this?"

Taesan muttered, looking puzzled.

* * *

The 79th floor was a world of struggle.

The beings here didn't fear death. They sought life-or-death battles, rejoiced in fighting strong enemies, and charged forward without hesitation.

Dozens of monsters challenged the king who ruled this place every day, losing their lives. It was a world where only beasts who lived to fight existed.

That's what Lee Tae-yeon had said.

"But...…."

However, the monsters in front of him now didn't show any signs of that fighting spirit.

They begged for their lives desperately, like mice in front of a cat.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Their eyes were filled with only fear.

"[...This isn't like them. Why are they acting like this? You guys didn't used to be like this, did you? I've had to suffer so much just to deal with you. Why are you suddenly acting like pets?]

The ghost also muttered in a state of considerable confusion. The 79th floor was a floor that the ghost had visited when it was descending into the labyrinth. Therefore, the ghost couldn't hide its confusion.

Taesan took a step forward to confirm. As he moved his body, the two monsters that were desperately clinging to him were startled and ran away.

Taesan then moved to a place where more beasts were gathered.

There, dozens of beasts were fighting each other, showcasing their strength.

They were by no means weak. Even an ordinary adventurer on the 79th floor would have to use all their strength to fight just one of them.

Taesan landed in front of them.

At that moment, the monsters that were fighting stopped simultaneously.

"......Khhhh!"

A scream erupted from all directions. Some monsters fled in a hurry, while others gave up and ran towards Taesan, clinging to him.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It had become clear by this point.

Taesan had reached the level of an immortal.

And an immortal was a being of a higher dimension, different from a mortal. Even if they tried to hide their presence, everyone who saw them instinctively knew they were a being of a different level.

That's why even the monsters living on the 79th floor couldn't dare to challenge Taesan.

"'Was this what Balbam said?'"

It was only natural. Struggle was something that occurred between beings of the same life. But if fighting itself had no meaning, and the opponent was on a different level than oneself...

There was no point in struggling.

The beasts that moved according to their instincts couldn't even think of attacking.

Seeing this, I could understand why Balbam was worried. The reason for the design of the labyrinth, the struggle itself, was invalid. It was certainly a difficult situation for the administrator.

"It's difficult."

Taesan sat on his arm, stroking the eagle's feathers. When Taesan's hand touched it, the eagle's wings trembled."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They had given up fighting and were begging to be spared. Dealing with these kinds of people was also a very troublesome task.

"...Balbam said that if we just did it moderately, we would be rewarded."

It seemed that he knew the monsters on the 79th floor would give up fighting, and that's why he said that - to leave them alone.

So, Taesan didn't think he needed to lift a finger.

He wandered around the 79th floor. The monsters that saw him wandering around either ran away or clung to him, trying to get close to his body. It was one of the two.

Since there was no battle, there was nothing to do.

Taesan prioritized finding the secret room. The 79th floor was very vast, but it wasn't difficult for Taesan at this point.

The moment he became immortal, his perspective on the world changed. He could sense where the secret room was without using his skills.

As a result, Taesan found the secret room at an incredibly fast speed."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Shoes of one who lived for the sake of struggle.] [Attack power + 600] [Defense + 300] [Strength + 300] [Action speed + 19%] [Movement speed + 18%] [These shoes were worn by a being who struggled with the world from the moment they couldn't even speak properly. They lived only for the sake of struggle, but ultimately failed and died. However, their emotions and resentment remain in the shoes.]

The stats and defense of these shoes were lower than the ones I'm currently wearing, but their attack power was higher. They were a decent piece of equipment.

After finding the secret room, there was nothing left to do.

In the end, Taesan went to see the 79th floor king.

The king was a massive black bear. Its entire body was covered in wounds, but its muscles were tightly packed beneath its fur.

"You're strong."

The bear had the same level of power as the leader of the Sinful Pathfinders.

The bear quietly looked down at Taesan, then slowly lowered its posture.

It kneeled down, pressing its head to the ground, taking a stance of absolute obedience to Taesan.

Taesan patted the bear's head.

[79th floor cleared.] [The power of Balbam's authority has been activated. Forced clearance has been triggered.] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [You have obtained the ring of one who succeeded in struggle.] [You have obtained ???.] [You have perfectly conquered one floor without a single battle. You have obtained the special skill [Absolute Authority].]"

Note: "Balbam" is likely a proper noun, but I couldn't find any information on what it refers to. It may be a name or a term specific to the game or story.
