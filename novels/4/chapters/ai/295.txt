Chapter 296

296. The Green Witch (1)

"It's dead."

A cold voice resonates. However, there was an uncontrollable tremble hidden within.

"It's dead."

The mage gazed at the extinguished gemstone, his face twisted in a scowl.

"The Shaman has died."

"...Really?"

"The gemstone does not lie. We knew it. The Shaman no longer exists in the labyrinth."

A faint cry echoes from all directions. Ambresia's face turns pale as she scratches her head.

"Do we need to hold a funeral?"

"We are adventurers who risk our lives to descend into the labyrinth. We have already lost our lives. We have decided not to dwell on each other's deaths."

"But that's when we died while descending into the labyrinth, isn't it? But this is... "

Ambresia is unable to continue speaking. The Fire Spirit King closes his eyes. The Lion King twitches his eyebrows.

"...I don't understand. What's going on?"

His voice trembles with confusion.
Here is the translation of the text:

"No, it's true that Shaman lost, but it's only been a day since he went down. Did he really break through their defense in just one day? Is that really possible?"

The Lion King looked around at them and asked.

"Is there anyone among us who can break through Shaman's defense in just one day?"

No one readily raised their hand in response. So-sei opened her mouth.

"I might be able to do it."

Her cold but beautiful voice echoed.

"And Lion King, you too might have a chance. Since we're both focused on offense, if the Great Mage is ready, we might be able to break through. The Divine King might not be able to either?"

"I'm impossible," the Divine King whispered. "Shaman's defense is specialized against the Divine, and even if it's me, I couldn't break through it."

"And you two also have a chance, but in reality, it's impossible."

"...?"

So-sei quietly nodded her head.

If Shaman didn't respond differently and just kept taking their attacks, he might have been able to hold out for a few days.

The guide of evil.
Here is the translation of the text:

He who boasts of his absolute defensive prowess.

The weight of his words was by no means light.

However, Tai Shan has already won against Shaman within a day.

"Ah, it's troublesome."

A voice that mixed a sigh was raised.

"Very troublesome……"

They hardly thought that Shaman would lose. Unlike other guides, they were different.

Shaman was their comrade, and they had countless times fought together, progressing with a deep-level strategy.

From their perspective, it was hard to believe that a novice adventurer who had not yet reached the deep level would lose against Shaman, whom they had closely watched for a long time.

Ambrosia scratched her head.

"Hmm... let's calm down first. It's already happened, right?"

"......Yeah, that's right."

Their eyes quickly regained their composure.

A labyrinth is a place where anything can happen, exceeding the scope of imagination. No matter how unexpected the situation, being able to quickly regain composure is a virtue that anyone who has reached the deep level should possess.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Do not mourn Shaman. If someone wants to personally pay their respects, I won't stop them. Especially not the Lord of the Flames. You were somewhat familiar with Shaman, weren't you?"

The Lord of the Flames nodded. Her eyes had a solemn look.

They had been staying here for an uncountable amount of time. Although they weren't close enough to risk their lives for each other, they had a certain understanding.

"Then let's start confirming."

They still didn't know any information about the Great Mountain. The reason was that the gods blocked the acquisition of each other's information for a fair fight.

But now they could make an educated guess.

It was clear that Shaman had lost, and that alone was information.

"There are those among us who have not won against Shaman, yet Shaman was chosen."

The gods don't want to watch a futile fight. They want to see a fierce battle between evenly matched opponents.

In other words, among them, only Shaman had the ability to win against the Great Mountain.

"Does he have a piercing skill?"

"But it's impossible with just a simple piercing skill. Shaman also has a counter-skill for piercing."

Note: The text appears to be a conversation between characters in a fantasy story, likely in a world with magical or supernatural elements. The characters are discussing the defeat of a person named Shaman and the implications of this event.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The Shaman had worn multiple defensive equipment. Even if he could penetrate defense at a high rate, could an adventurer who had not reached the depths yet break through in a day?"

The silent So-seot asked the Great Mage.

"Is it possible to break through with magic?"

"It's possible. Magic is a great power. However, a long and arduous preparation process is necessary."

The Great Mage shook his staff.

"We need to create a magic circle, control the space, and prepare the implementation of magic. Even if we fail, we need to prepare at least several days in advance. That guy will be waiting for us at the 64th floor, so it's impossible."

"The Shaman also had a recovery skill. Then he must also have a skill to reduce recovery."

"Amberia, you said you had a skill to nullify attacks when fighting us? Can you tell me more about that?"

They began discussing. They started to investigate information about Tai-san one by one.

* * *

"Now we're making a lot of noise, aren't we?"

[What's that?]

"The leaders are talking."

[......Ah ha.]

The ghost realized. He smiled slightly.

[Of course.]

Tai-san had won against the Shaman. It was a guide with absolute defensive power, as expected.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even if the information is blocked by the divine being, it is still a piece of information in itself.

What kind of method did Taesan use to break through Shaman? And how did he win? I will share my opinions about that.

Moreover, I also conjecture that Taesan could break through the defense.

"It doesn't matter."

Since we would have fought against the commander anyway, it was already known information. I had expected something like that.

The important thing is that Taesan became stronger faster and more surely than they had expected.

Taesan attacked the 65th floor. In an instant, he cleared out the monsters and arrived at the boss's room.

[Some part of the world-engulfing vines appeared.]

The boss's room was completely covered in vines.

The vines writhed wildly and tried to swallow Taesan whole. Taesan opened his mouth.

" Burn it."

Flames rose from the end of the vines and started burning the entire vine mass.

Ignoring the excruciating pain, he manifests his magic. Light and cold energy swept through.

Kuku, kuku, kuku...
Here is the translation of the text:

"You have won against a part of the world covered with vines. You have obtained the staff of the Green Witch. The staff of the Green Witch, which once belonged to the Green Witch who ruled the northern forest of the world. When you handle the witch's magic, the power increases significantly.

"What is the witch's magic?"

It was a new word to him. For him, magic was only the magic of the magic god.

A ghost spoke.

"Since I've seen the era of immortality, I think it's a being that has escaped the era of immortality. Among the beings that have escaped the era of immortality, there is a god who creates his own magic. However, ......."

"Is the magic of the magic god inferior compared to the magic of the magic god?"

It's probably so? The magic god is the god of magic itself, so his value is great, but this place is a labyrinth, so it's relative. The value is lower.

The clear condition has been met. The stairs leading down to the 66th floor have opened.

However, the secret reward has not been obtained.

The hidden element of the floor can be obtained as a reward when discovered.

I couldn't find what I had never missed once before.

"The secret room is not visible."

Tai Shan scowled. He examined the labyrinth carefully while passing through the floors, but the secret room was nowhere to be found."
Here is the translation of the text:

So I thought there was no secret room on this floor, but it seems that's not the case.

"I'll have to search for it."

* * *

"What are you doing?"

"Finding secrets."

Tae-san walked around the 65th floor, which had been cleared. At first, the ghost was silent, but as an hour passed, then two hours, then three hours, and eventually a day passed, it had to speak out.

"[You know my heart. Since you've taken care of everything, you can't afford to miss the secret reward, can you.]"

The secret reward is obtained when clearing the entire floor.

The secret reward is superior to the reward for clearing the floor. If you perfectly grasp the floor and navigate the maze, a title is also given.

Tae-san couldn't easily give up. He would definitely find it. That's why the ghost was silent.

However, as time passed, it had to speak out.

"[Isn't it a type of secret reward that can't be obtained?]

Tae-san's scouting. And grasping the essence.

Both were skills that were difficult for an adventurer on this floor to possess.
Here is the translation:

There, Tai Shan had skills for detecting black magic and magic, as well as skills that could not be missed. In reality, it was impossible for him to miss something, and it was either one of two things: the system was lying or it was impossible to understand in a normal way.

[The system is not lying.]

Skills are absolute. The system only speaks the truth, and stats cannot be negated.

That was the trust of the labyrinth that the one who had descended into it would naturally possess.

[In other words, it means that there is a secret room that can only be found in a different way, and then you may never be able to find it.]

One had to be born with a special bloodline or form a relationship with someone inside the labyrinth or possess a special skill.

There were rewards that could be obtained by fulfilling certain conditions in the labyrinth. For example, Tai Shan had found the forgotten goddess's room and obtained the reward, which was part of this process.

[One cannot obtain everything.]

The ghost said:

It is impossible to figure out the secrets of the labyrinth. This place, created by the transcendent and the wizard, is a place that mortals dare not predict.

In other words, there are things that must be given up.
Here is the translation of the text:

Of course, it's not easy to overlook the conditions of conquest, as much as one may not know what they are......

It's not enough to simply clear the labyrinth. One must conquer it in order to achieve one's wishes.

So, what does it mean to conquer?

One cannot afford to miss the secret rewards without knowing that. 

However, if there is a specific condition that must be met, it may be impossible to obtain it in the first place. If that's the case, it wouldn't matter even if one misses the conditions of conquest.

Is it possible to consider conquering the labyrinth if one can't even get one's hands on the kind of secrets that can't be obtained? 

The ghost thought so, but the wizard didn't seem to want that either.

"No."

But the mountain god shook his head.

"Just one more day."

It's not yet time to give up.

The mountain god continued to search, and the ghost respected the mountain god's choice.

And so, the mountain god stayed on the 65th floor for a whole week.

"I won't come out."
Here is the translation of the text:

Taesan shook his hand. Despite carefully examining each brick, nothing came out. The fact that Taesan, who had a profound understanding of the essence, couldn't find anything, meant that it was truly non-existent.

As the ghost had said, it was likely that the special conditions had not been met.

However,

There was something here that couldn't be expressed in words. It was a hunch and instinct. Taesan, who had obtained numerous skills, had developed a hunch about the possibility.

"'The Witch's Domain.'"

This was the Witch's Domain, it was said.

So, who was that witch?

A presence involved with the floor.

It was likely that the owner of the wrist guard Taesan possessed was the witch.

So, what was the extent of her strength?

Could a witch who could create equipment that was still useful even at a deep level, truly be mortal?

[You have activated the Sado-hwa chaos and darkness.] [You have activated the King's Vessel.] [Oh?]

Taesan suddenly activated his skills, causing the ghost to be startled. Taesan, who had elevated his level by one step, looked around.

Nothing had changed.

The 65th floor was still ordinary, covered in weeds.

A determination was formed. It became a language that had an impact on reality.

"Open it."

[You have activated the declaration of abolition.]

Kuung!
Here is the translation of the text:

The space is going to be torn apart.

A place that was hidden in the gap between the floors is starting to appear.

[The proficiency of reconnaissance has increased by 4%.]
[The proficiency of essence perception has increased by 3%.]
[The proficiency of incantation has increased by 2%.] [Huh?]

"Is this what secrecy is?"

Tai Shan's eyes widened. It's impossible to get there without holding an incantation.

This is really, only Tai Shan knows this kind of secret.

The floors are starting to change. The bricks disappear, and various plants fill the space.

A thick and heavy smell wafts.

At the same time, the power that wraps around the entire area can be felt.

Before long, Tai Shan was placed in the middle of a deep and dense forest.

[You have arrived at the green witch's domain.] [You have grasped the hidden element of the 65th floor. You have obtained a reward [???].]
