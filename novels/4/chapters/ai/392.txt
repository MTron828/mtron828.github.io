Article 393

393. The Sixth Return to the Earth (10)

[Manifestation of Divine Power] [Blessing is bestowed.] [I have obtained the blessing of God, which is an unshakeable choice.]

The blessing of God is bestowed upon the people of the world. Tai Shan opened the skill window.

[Divine Blessing: Unshakeable Choice] [If you have absolute confidence in your choices without the slightest doubt, when you take action, all action speeds will increase, and attack power and defense will increase slightly. Additionally, you will have a wider range of vision and sharper senses.]

A conditional buff. However, meeting the conditions was not difficult. Players who have descended into the labyrinth until now have been able to act without doubting their choices.

This blessing not only increases stats but also increases vision, senses, attack power, and defense. It will be a great help in exploring the labyrinth.

People shout with joy and excitement.

And Tai Shan obtained another ability.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Special Skill Activation: Exclusion.] [You can choose one of the enemy's attacks and cancel it. This skill can only be activated once per battle and has a daily cooldown. You cannot cancel attacks that are higher than your own level.]

Taisan read the skill description and let out a small sigh.

This is an attack-cancelling skill. It's like excluding the enemy's choice and erasing the result of the attack. It seems quite useful, similar to the skill "Melancholy of Destruction".

'That's similar.'

Taisan's attack invalidation and effect were almost identical. Attack invalidation prevents Taisan from choosing a skill to counter, but exclusion is more valuable in terms of being a skill that can be activated.

This skill was unusual for a simple reward. Maria explained the mystery.

[That's part of my power of selection. It's a part of it. Are you satisfied?]

"Is that enough? Do you think it's reasonable for me to give you this power, someone who isn't my apostle?"

[You've dealt with those annoying guys' apostles, so you can handle this much.]

Maria chuckled. Taisan accepted it gratefully.

Maria's reward was over.

Now it was time to re-examine the power he possessed.

Taisan quietly observed himself. What state was he in after achieving immortality?
Here is the translation of the given text:

"At this moment, he has undoubtedly reached immortality.

However, it was thanks to the faith of the players from the Three Kingdoms, Russia, and India.

The fact that he has reached immortality is certain. Even if people's faith disappears, the level he has reached will not collapse.

However, since he has not surpassed himself, but rather relies on people's faith, the power itself may weaken.

Apart from reaching immortality, he has also obtained many other things. It's time to confirm them slowly.

[Skill: Revenge] [Proficiency: 1%] [When fighting an existence that defeated you, your speed and attack power will increase slightly. If the opposing existence is stronger than you, your stats will increase proportionally.]

A skill obtained during a rematch with an apostle. This is because the apostle was formed from his memories, which is why he couldn't obtain it during the trial of the God of Despair.

"'There's no more use for it, I suppose.'"

The existence that defeated the Taesan was the sole, highest-ranking apostle in all of his past and current lives. Although he lost to Ainshahr in a battle, he will not activate this skill in a battle where he doesn't put his life on the line."
Here is the translation of the text:

[Special Permanent Active Skill: High God's Enemy] [Proficiency: 1%] [You have been recognized as an enemy of the High God's invasion of the world. When fighting against beings related to the High God, your stats and action speed will increase. Additionally, you will not be easily corrupted by their erosion and can deal more direct damage to their essence.]

This skill is similar to but more optimized for the High God. The permanent active skill will become increasingly more beneficial as it levels up.

[Title: Savior.] [You have saved the world from the existence that seeks to destroy it.] [When you prevent the destruction of the world, the majority of lives will send you deep trust and faith.] [The faith and saintliness you receive from them will be amplified.]

The Savior title has a fairly high effect. Even if you don't stay on the ground, but rather go down to the underworld, you will often find yourself opposing the High God. And most of the time, it will be a request to save a world from destruction.

In most cases, the title had a significant effect. This level is sufficient to be considered valuable.

Additionally, the proficiency of many skills has increased. Especially, the seed of life has increased by 13% and is now at 40%.

The High God's apostle has the power to consume their opponent and make them their own. Therefore, the proficiency of the seed of life seems to have increased significantly.

The proficiency of saintly power has also reached 90%.
Here is the translation of the text:

Perhaps, if I receive faith from all players on Earth, it would reach 100%.

If that were the case, the Earth would have become one's own domain, and it would have been possible to transcend the boundaries.

Although it's still in the realm of speculation, it was definitely possible.

And because I, the eternal being, had defeated the devil with the title of destroyer, I was able to obtain a skill related to ascension.

[Soul Skill: Destroyer] [Proficiency: 1%] [The destroyer of all things. What you crush and destroy is soon your power and strength. However, this power is difficult to handle, and it requires the user's level and qualifications.]

The power of the eternal being was similar to the explanation of the king of machinery.

However, there was a difference from before.

It was stated that the user's level and qualifications were insufficient to properly handle this power.

However, it was possible to handle it to some extent.

The verification of what was obtained was now complete.

Tae-san took a step forward.

* * *

Now, it's time to think about what we can do.

Of course, the first thing to verify would be the soul skill.
Here is the translation of the text:

"[Soul Skill: King of Machinery] [Proficiency: 1%] [The king of machinery. The power possessed by their master. However, this power is beyond the user's qualifications and abilities.]"

"'It's certain.'"

Originally, there was an explanation that the user's power was too insufficient to handle this power.

The soul skill is the power of the immortal. But now, Taesan has reached the level of immortality.

So, there was no reason to be unable to handle it.

As Taesan moved to confirm, he saw Kim Hwiyeon and people struggling to get the tractor to work at the front.

"What are you doing?"

"Oh! Oh! Taesan-nim!"

People's eyes widened in shock as they gazed at him. Taesan asked them.

"What do you plan to do with the tractor?"

"We're starting to feel the limitations of cultivation, so..."

Kim Hwiyeon opened her mouth.

Now, the number of people has become too numerous. We need to feed and support countless people.

The simple cultivation can feed and support everyone, but now the area needed for cultivation has become incredibly vast.

It is more efficient to use machines than for people to dig one by one, so he was looking for a way to repair the broken tractor.
Here is the translation of the text:

"But it seems like it's going to be difficult. Even if I can somehow find the oil, the internal structure is damaged... and I don't have the spare parts either."

Kim Hwi-yeon shook his head.

Tae-san gazed blankly at the tractor.

He stretched out his hand.

[The manifestation of Tae-san's power. The king of machinery has been activated.]

Kiying!

The power is being implemented.

The tractor emitted a loud noise and the damaged parts began to move. People gasped and backed away.

[...What?]

A ghostly voice made a strange sound.

Tae-san didn't know the structure of the tractor. He had no idea how it moved.

But he didn't care.

He didn't need to know or understand.

All he had to do was find the answer in his head.

Rrrrr.

The tractor, now silent, roared to life with the sound of its engine. People's eyes widened in surprise.

"There is oil, but it won't last long. I'll figure it out myself."

"Oh, okay..."

People nodded dully. Kim Hwi-yeon rolled his eyes.

"Is this also possible?"

"It's possible this time."

Tae-san, who had given a rough answer, flew out of the city with his body.

He arrived at the massive, damaged power plant.
Here is the translation of the text:

The power plant was enormous, capable of supplying power to an entire city, but it had now fallen into disrepair and was in a state of complete disarray.

[The manifestation of Kang Tae-san's power. The king of machinery has been activated.]

The manifestation of power.

I didn't know how the power plant was operating, but it didn't matter. I already knew the answer.

The parts were moving in mid-air, circulating among the machines. It filled the space and couldn't be filled, so it was transformed into parts of another machine.

Tae-san snapped his fingers.

The power plant began to operate with a loud noise.

"Is this power?"

[Really, it's unbelievable.]

A ghost muttered to himself. Although Tae-san had obtained the immortal's power, I didn't think it was real until I saw him using it directly.

Power is something that has been accumulated over a lifetime.

Tae-san was not only using the result, but also treating it like his own strength.

[What are you doing?]

"I don't know."

The ascension to a higher realm was also an unknown skill.

After further verification, it was possible to understand the usage method of the king of machinery.

"It's impossible to create a machine from scratch or create non-existent parts."

Note: The text appears to be a fantasy story, and some of the concepts and terms used may be unfamiliar or require context to fully understand.
Here is the translation:

At present, he could only repair machines. It was his only skill.

According to the skill description, he lacked the qualifications and level. Although he had just become an immortal, he was far from being able to freely control the powers of other immortals. He was still limited.

"Still, it's usable."

When rebuilding the civilization of the earth, the most pressing issue was indeed the machines. In modern society, even skilled technicians could not start from scratch. It took a considerable amount of time and effort to pull electricity and create all the machines from scratch.

He could perfectly solve this problem with his mechanical skills.

"Is the law of regulation also usable? I'll test it if I can."

[I don't understand.]

The ghost laughed hollowly. He thought about it, but his head hurt, so he decided not to think about it.

After confirming the soul skill, Taesan was playing with the materials he possessed.

[Determined New Blood] [Essence of the World]

The materials he had obtained before, but he lacked the qualifications and strength to handle them, so he had kept them.

Now, he could handle them to some extent.
Here is the translation of the text:

"How are you going to write it?"

"I am still thinking about it."

He was not the Great Leader. He couldn't even melt it. He thought about doing it on his own, but it would take a long time to prepare. He couldn't think of a way to use it immediately.

"Just do it comfortably. It's yours now."

"I'm thinking about it, but... are you not going to turn back?"

Taesan turned his gaze away.

Maria was quietly smiling at that place.

"What a joke. You're trying to kick me out like that."

"The others left as soon as they finished settling things, so I'm curious."

Rakiratas, Maisin, and Beatrix also left the earth immediately after receiving blessings. Unlike them, Maria was still staying on earth.

"There's still something to see."

"What is it?"

"You'll soon find out."

As he said that, Maria's figure disappeared.

Taesan couldn't understand Maria's purpose.

Time passed afterwards. It was already two days away from returning to the labyrinth.

People waited calmly for their return.
Here is the translation of the text:

Tae-san had finished all his checks and was resting quietly in the heavens.

"Huu."

Lee Tae-yeon came up to the heavens, drenched in sweat.

"Ah, Tae-san. You're here."

"There's no need to bother. I'm here with Jun-hyeok to spar. We're back."

"Yes. I'm not sure when I'll come back next time, but I have to enjoy the scenery before I go."

Lee Tae-yeon nodded her head.

She was more proactive than she was in her previous life. She was really strong now.

"By the way, Maria is still here, isn't she..."

"Why? Is it uncomfortable?"

"It's not that. I can't express it with words, but I have a strange feeling about something."

Tae-san looked at her for a moment before checking the link connected to her.

What is this?

Even now, it couldn't be understood. Suddenly, Tae-san thought of Maria's gift, a flower arrangement.

Tae-san took the flower arrangement. Since he had become immortal, he could sense the power within it more accurately than before.

"What's this? It's pretty."
Here is the translation of the text:

Taeyeon looked at the flower arrangement with a strange expression. Tae-san slowly examined the flower arrangement.

[You have activated your intuition.] [You have activated your surveillance.]

The information of the flower arrangement was read.

This was not for Tae-san, but for someone else.

And who was that someone?

Tae-san's face suddenly contorted. Taeyeon trembled with surprise.

"Why are you doing this?"

"...".

Tae-san looked at Taeyeon without speaking.

He handed her the flower arrangement.

"Is this a gift?"

Taeyeon hesitated, receiving the flower arrangement.

At the same time, the flower arrangement lit up.

[Maria's gift has been activated.]

"Wow?"

Taeyeon's eyes widened. The flower arrangement was absorbed into her body.

And Tae-san could see it.

The link that was hidden inside her was amplified.

"Wow, wow, wow?"

Taeyeon was extremely startled. The light enveloped her gently, seemingly unrelated to anything.
