261. The Saint of the Ancient Vein (Part 2)

"Your power is foreign. To seize the strength of those inside. It cannot be."

Minerva said similar words. To seize the power of the ancient gods. Not just the power of monsters, but the power of the ancient gods themselves. Even the gods said it was foreign.

Irlaine responded.

"The gods are close to omniscient but do not know everything. They probably didn't expect your abilities to reach this extent."

Irlaine smiled.

It was a smile that seemed pleased with the current situation, a smile that welled up from within.

"I don't know exactly either. The great one taught me all the knowledge, but my mind wasn't perfect enough to accept it all. In the end, I'm just a mortal."

Irlaine looked regretful, as if truly lamenting.

"But even such a humble me knows just one thing."


Here's the translation of the text into English:

Illeine extended his hand with a twisted smile. Darkness twisted as a staff appeared in his hand.

"The Great One has something he desires of you. And that is to set him free."

Freedom.

To Taesan, it did not resonate so well.

"I am his apostle."

Illeine raised the staff.

The dark energy scattered across the abandoned land began to gather into the staff.

"All that I am is for him. I exist to fulfill his desires."

Hmm.

The dark energy spread out. Minerva, who had been waiting for the demons to come from outside, shivered.

An ominous energy wafted. She had seen such an energy in Arulia before.

"Master. Stay strong."

She murmured softly.

Taesan drew his sword. He gathered his strength in response to Illeine.

[You activated Apostlehood [Mixed Grace].] [You activated Vessel of the King.] [You activated the Small Spark.] [You activated the Path of the Wind-Walking Deer.]
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"The Apostle's power descends upon Taesan. The vessel of the Spirit King resonates with the ring, transmitting strength to Taesan.

Dominance over flames forms, and the wind envelops Taesan's body.

And furthermore.

['The opponent faces a difficult victory.'] ['The thirst for battle has been triggered.'] ['A fair duel has been triggered.'] ['Proof of limits has been triggered.'] ['Contempt of the strong has been triggered.'] ['Half-body theory has been triggered.'] ['Giant killer has been triggered.'] ['Those who go against great will have been triggered.']

All sorts of buffs settle on Taesan's physique. Much stronger than before, Taesan imbues power into the hand holding the sword.

Ilaein smiled.

"Welcome. Those who have come here by Mason, Lucifer. I will show you who the true master of this land is."

* * *

Thump.

Taesan stomped his foot.

Ilaein felt his body disappear in an instant.

Such speed that it couldn't even be properly perceived. Ilaein shook his staff.

Whoosh. Darkness poured out in all directions. Taesan's sword, which had moved behind Ilaein, was blocked by the darkness.

"As expected, you're fast. There's no chance of winning if we fight with our bodies."
Ilarin exclaimed in admiration. Even if all the fingers present here combined their strength, it couldn't compare to the speed.

"But my power doesn't originate from the physical."

The staff struck the ground. As power gathered at the staff's tip, it eventually evoked a phenomenon.

Shwaa-ja-ja-zhak!

Dark rain began to fall.

A rain that corrodes upon contact, dyeing everything in its own color. Taesan gathered strength. Flames shook the surroundings along with the wind. The dark rain scattered in all directions.

Meanwhile, power was gathering again on Ilarin's staff.

Squelch.

The power materialized as waves of darkness surged.

Thick and deep, the energy that pervaded the entire earth gathered into the staff's power, attempting to trample Taesan. Taesan spread the wings of a fairy and soared.

"Hmm."

Taesan observed the power Ilarin wielded.

"Similar."

To Arulia, the noble fool who fought with him. The power and sensation he wielded were similar.

But it was much stronger. Its intensity, quality, and power were incomparable.

The staff gathered power once again.
The black beetles emerged from the ground, attempting to pierce through Mount Taesan. 

Mount Taesan swung its sword to fend them off, but the beetles, as if possessing their own will, dodged the sword and rushed forward.

Crunch.

Mount Taesan fiercely kicked, sending the beetles flying.

"When the Great One ruled the underworld, their magic existed here," Ilarain revealed.

"Now forgotten, the magic of the Great One once spread throughout the underworld, showcasing its greatness."

The staff resonated.

Kwoong!

The ground collapsed, pillars rising like dominoes to pierce Mount Taesan. Mount Taesan leaped high into the sky to avoid them, but the pillars continued to rise towards him as if determined not to miss.

With a flick of his tongue, Mount Taesan soared higher than the pillars could reach.

Kuuuuung!

Suddenly, the pillars rose dramatically, high enough to pierce Mount Taesan flying in the sky.

Mount Taesan struck down with his sword.

The pillars collapsed and shattered.

Seemingly satisfied with its task, no more pillars rose.

Fundamentally, it resembled dark magic, yet more sinister and alien.
Here's the translation of the text:

"Ilaine smiled faintly.

"Thank you. Your confusion bought us some time. Thanks to that, we can now eliminate the most troublesome thing."

Power gathered in the staff.

Then the air changed.

The air, thick and sticky like mucus, tried to compress around Taesan's whole body. Ilaine murmured.

"The power to erase the attack itself. It's quite bothersome."

Ilaine was familiar with nullifying attacks. Having fought with spirits many times before, it wasn't strange to start responding gradually.

The moment the air tried to stick to Taesan, intangible forces surrounded him, shattering the approaching air and preventing it from getting close.

"...I haven't heard of such power before."

"I'm not stupid enough to leave obvious weaknesses alone."

This was the absolute sanctuary obtained for this purpose.

"It's become difficult."

Ilaine calmly struck the staff down. Power surged and began to envelop his body.

'The flute that calls silence... is it a pipe of doban?'

Here's the translation of the text into English:

"Ilaine smiled faintly.

"Thank you. Your confusion bought us some time. Thanks to that, we can now eliminate the most troublesome thing."

Power gathered in the staff.

Then the air changed.

The air, thick and sticky like mucus, tried to compress around Taesan's entire body. Ilaine muttered.

"The power to erase the attack itself. That's quite annoying."

Ilaine was aware of attack nullification. Having fought with spirits many times, gradually responding wasn't unusual.

The moment the air tried to adhere to Taesan, intangible forces surrounding him moved. They shattered the approaching air, denying it access.

"...I haven't heard of such power before."

"I'm not stupid enough to overlook obvious weaknesses."

This was the absolute defense acquired for this purpose.

"It's become difficult."

Ilaine calmly struck the staff downward. Power surged, enveloping his body.

'Is it the pipe that calls silence...?'


Here is the translation of the text:

For 10 minutes, the flute prohibited the use of all magic. The target included Taesan as well.

Though it was said to be ancient Maesin's magic, it was unclear whether the flute would target Taesan. Taesan did not draw the flute, as it could lead to a fight where Taesan would penalize himself.

Up until now, Illein had roughly grasped the power that he handled.

"There's a delay."

Illein was implementing various powers with the help of ancient power. And the stronger the power, the longer the process of the power surging.

"......"

As if Taesan didn't like something, he frowned.

He stretched out his arm.

[You have activated Starlight Arrow.] [You have activated Magic Acceleration.]

A shaft of light manifested in Taesan's hand. It flew straight towards Illein.

Illein concentrated his strength with a stern face.

Kuuuuung!

Light and darkness collided and vanished. Taesan once again launched the Starlight Arrow towards Illein, who was thrown through the air.

Kuuuuuuung!

The light ignited the darkness.

Taesan extended his hand again.

[You have activated Starlight Arrow.] [You have activated Magic Acceleration.]

Kuuung!

"Ugh!"
"If I were my past self, I would have been rather difficult."

Back then, he never properly experienced the full effects of protection. Perhaps the nullification of attacks became meaningless due to the altered atmosphere. And he probably couldn't evade the various onslaughts properly.

Even if he managed to overcome somehow, he would have shown all the cards he had.

But it wasn't like that now.

Now, he possessed a very high amount of mana. His intelligence was also high, significantly reducing the mana consumption of magic.

Because of this, he could cast intermediate magic like Starlight Arrow without much burden.

Ilarin gathered strength with his staff to a certain extent, then went through the process of implementing magic.

In contrast, Starlight Arrow manifested immediately upon use.

He inevitably held the upper hand in speed.

Zzzeek!

Ilarin's hands grew dizzy under the successive onslaught of arrows. Finally, Ilarin failed to block the Starlight Arrow and couldn't gather his strength.

Taesan didn't miss that opportunity.
Here's the translation of the text:

"You activated Starlight Arrow. You activated Stealth. You activated Acceleration.

Starlight Arrow explodes, blocking Ilalin's line of sight. Then you activate Stealth to conceal yourself and charge forward with Acceleration in an instant.

While Ilalin is occupied blocking Starlight Arrow, you jab at their flank.

"Ugh!"

*Clang!*

Rather than the sensation of a blade cutting through flesh, a sound of impact echoes.

There was gold on Ilalin's flank, and from there, a dark aura slowly oozes out.

It appeared to be a dark defense clad in flesh.

Blame.

Mountains plunge into Ilalin. Ilalin swings their staff. Blades of darkness leap from all directions.

You move your hand.

"You activated continuous attacks."

Sword strikes of illusions are drawn all around. You ward off the surging darkness and smash it to pieces.

The moment Ilalin tries to unleash the power of their staff, you grab the hand holding the staff.

*Thud.*

Twisting the arm, you strike the solar plexus with your knee. Ilalin's eyes momentarily flicker.

And then you thrust the sword in.

"You activated Blade of Spirit."

*Kwak.*
Here's the translation of the text into English:

Penetrating through the darkness, it plunges deep into the chest. With a crash, Illyne's body slams into the ground.

"Cough."

Illyne coughs up blood.

His entire body was crumbling.

"You're strong."

"Don't babble, just call me."

Taesan twisted the sword stuck in his chest. There was no face with joy of victory or satisfaction of winning.

Illyne smiled faintly.

"Did you notice?"

"You're not a fool enough not to know that."

Illyne was implementing ancient magic using his own strength, not borrowing power from others or utilizing the power of the ancestors spreading on the ground.

And it was like magic. It was a power that drew out one's own power inside the body, so there was no need for a long casting time.

It meant that Illyne had no reason to be pushed back by the speed of Taesan's star arrow.

But Illyne's casting time was incredibly long.

It meant that Illyne was preparing something simultaneously with double casting while fighting him.
The skill allowed him to cast two spells simultaneously, albeit slowing down his casting speed. He had encountered such skills when fighting S-rank monsters in his previous life.

"I apologize, Your Greatness. This humble body has failed to fulfill your will."

Iraein's words were filled with apology.

Darkness began to gather around his body.

"Therefore, please forgive! It means allowing Your Greatness to descend upon this filthy land!"

Kuuung!

Darkness erupted.

Taisan spurred himself into action.

Outside, they prepared for battle as demons approached one by one. It was when Anetsha and Kwaned tensely drew their weapons.

"...Hm?"

Minerva's face stiffened.

From the thorny side, a tremendous shockwave spread out across the exhausted land.

"Ah... this is... dangerous."

Minerva scratched her cheek as the abandoned land's exhausted power was being recovered.

["Hmm. Is this how it is?"]

"Huh?"

"O, our Lord!"

["Hello. My children."]

The Lord greeted them with a smile. Anetsha and Kwaned were amazed and bowed deeply.

The Lord shifted his gaze.
The rushing demons fell one by one. They were bound by the power of the earth. As the earth's power was reclaimed, soul and body naturally separated.

An expanse of abandoned land too vast to comprehend.

The reclaimed area spread throughout the entire place, gathering into thorns.

"Do you wish to hold onto all of this, even if it means giving up everything else?"

The ancient spirit could not interfere in the underworld. He had been banished.

But the abandoned land still belonged to the ancient spirit's domain. Thus, he could not interfere here either.

The only way the ancient spirit could interfere was by issuing decrees through the thorns. That was the extent of his influence.

But there was one way he could exert more influence.

It was to give up everything.

Then, although it was a very small space, the ancient spirit's domain could be formed for a short time.

It was to seize Mount Taesan.

"But it won't be easy."

She chuckled softly.

Kuuung!

A huge force coalesced into thorns. Mount Taesan intensified the power enveloping the entire body. Otherwise, it would have been a concentration of power that would collapse with the flesh.

Before anyone knew it, a massive black barrier had formed around the thorns.

"I cannot leave."


I tapped on the barrier, but it was extremely sturdy. It was impossible to open it without employing the power of grey.

This place was no longer the underworld.

It was a dimension different from that.

Thorns distort space and open a passage.

There, a gigantic being appears.

It had a human form, but no head. Its entire body was glossy black, and it had eight arms.

"Smaller than the old god I saw in Arulia."

But Taesan could feel it. A being on par with him. A transcendent being capable of taking lives just by existing.

"Hello. Are you an ancient spirit?"
