**Episode 457**

457. The Seventh Return, Earth (9)

Wooooo!

The ground shakes. Several pillars that couldn't withstand the force collapse. The power of Zelvand, which was suppressing the giant, weakens.

The giant starts to rampage even more.

It swings its arms wildly, summoning a storm that destroys the world.

[You have activated the Mana Storm [Abnormal].]

Kagagagak!

Taesan also summons a storm to erase the aftermath.

Taesan clicks his tongue.

Although he's barely holding on, the situation isn't good. Hiding his body is meaningless. With his special sensing ability, he can detect Taesan's location even if he uses a stealth skill.

Moreover, except for the injury on the sole of his foot, which was caused by the giant's power, he can't inflict significant damage.

'I'm not strong enough.'

The boundary is clearly transcendent power, but it's Taesan, the immortal, who wields it. With his power, he can't easily pierce the giant's body.

There's only one chance if there's a possibility.

It's clear where to aim.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$Tae-san looked at his own fiery red eyes from the top of a high mountain.

His only fiery red eyes. That place was likely to be the vital point.

If there was a problem, he had to climb up to the high sky to attack the eyes.

The fact that he was currently withstanding one attack cancellation while the giant was unable to attack freely was possible because he was moving under the giant's foot.

If he targeted the eyes, he would also be exposed to the giant's attacks.

But Tae-san put strength in the hand holding the sword and took a deep breath.

The opponent is clearly stronger than himself.

Trying to win without any risk is an extremely arrogant and foolish thing.

As always, risking his life, and moving forward.

Tae-san withdrew the protective line that protected his body and instead left his sanctity. There was not much blackness left to handle. He thought of saving it for the last attack.

Tae-san knelt down. Putting all his strength into his lower body, he struck the ground.

[You have activated a jump.] [You have activated acceleration.]

His body made a roaring sound and flew towards the giant's eyes.

"Oooooo!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The people who were watching that figure knelt down. Their faith was imbued in Taesan.

The giant responded immediately. He lifted his foot high and brought it down with force.

There were still two invalidation attacks left. However, due to the power of the divine punishment, he couldn't erase the attacks, so he had to dodge all of them to get close to Taesan's eyes.

Taesan put strength into his foot and kicked the air fiercely.

[You activated aerial jump.]

Kuuuuuuung!

He barely dodged the foot that was coming down.

The divine aura that surrounded his entire body was distorted, and the aftermath enveloped Taesan.

[Your second attack!@#!%#]

The invalidation attack was activated.

However, he didn't fall to the ground. The divine aura minimized the impact of the aftermath.

Taesan spread his wings and accelerated towards the eyes.

Buuuuuung!

The divine punishment raised its arm high and brought its elbow down.

A crushing pressure, as if the sky was falling, pressed down on Taesan.

It was impossible to break through that with his own strength alone. But Taesan didn't stop.

[You activated selection exclusion.]

Kuuuuuuung!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The world is distorted in an instant. The power of the transcendent and the power of the divine collide, causing chaos in the world.

His elbow stops moving, but only for a brief moment.

The pressure weakens momentarily. Taesan doesn't miss the opportunity. He moves quickly and brushes past the elbow.

[Your third attack is invalid!]

The third attack is nullified.

In return, Taesan reaches the giant's chin.

Boom!

The giant's arm, which was swung down, is swung back up. Taesan doesn't dodge this time.

[You have activated the shield of Aegis, imbued with divinity.]

Thud.

Taesan's fist, swung from below, lands a direct hit.

Despite using the invincible shield, his entire body shudders. His bones are crushed, and his flesh is torn apart.

Taesan grits his teeth and wraps his body in divinity even more strongly.

Kuuuuuuuuung!

Taesan's body, unable to withstand the power, is sent flying high into the air. People scream in despair, and even Lee Tae-yeon thinks Taesan has lost for a moment.

"It's brutal."

As Taesan is sent flying by the power, he mutters to himself."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Aegis's shield was immune to damage. However, due to the power of the divine, the shield's effect was pierced. In an instant, his entire body was severely injured.

Taesan, who controlled the divine, restored his broken and damaged body.

After recovering his body, he looked around.

It was a dark space.

There, countless stars were visible.

He was now in the universe.

Taesan grasped his sword tightly. He didn't avoid the attack, but rather intentionally took it.

With his power alone, he couldn't pierce the divine's body. His eyes were exposed, but instead, his defense seemed even more solid.

So, he used the divine's power to fly all the way to the universe in an instant.

[You activated Landing.]

His body began to fall from the universe.

Normally, he would have fallen to the ground in an instant, but thanks to flying all the way to the universe, it took a considerable amount of time to fall.

One of the characteristics of Landing.

The longer the activation time, the more it accelerates.

And there was no limit to that acceleration.

[You activated Acceleration.] [You activated Skill Acceleration.]

"Ah?"

The people who were despairing looked up at the sky in surprise.

A meteor was falling from the sky.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

Taesan descended upon the earth.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The giant took a rough step forward. Using its waist, it threw a punch.

Taesan didn't dodge this time either. The moment the punch touched Taesan, a skill was activated.

[Your last chance has been activated.]

A skill that can block a deadly attack just once, for sure.

But, just like the skills until now, it didn't activate properly.

Taesan knew that his last chance wouldn't activate properly.

Instead, he was aiming for that.

If he couldn't block it, he could at least make it graze.

Taesan twisted his body. The thrown punch barely grazed past Taesan's side.

The aftermath enveloped Taesan.

[You took 3,252,478 damage.] [Your Endurance has been activated.]

It wasn't a direct hit. It was just a fragment, not a perfect blow. The power was significantly suppressed by Zelvand's pillar.

Even so, over three million damage was dealt.

There was no longer any defense left.

But thanks to that, Taesan was able to slow down and dodge the attack without slowing down.

Taesan drew his sword, sharpening the boundary line even more.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The giant's response was extremely simple. He quickly raised his arm and covered his eyes. Just that was enough to make it impossible to pierce through the mountain.

But the mountain, as if it had been waiting, unleashed all the power it had accumulated.

[You have activated the collapse of all things.] [You have activated Memorize.] [You have activated the distorted ring of regret.]

Kwaaaang!

The power explodes.

Magic, dark magic, and all the divine powers and skills he possessed. He unleashed them all at once, directing them at the giant's hand.

The giant's body shook violently. Even if he was a strong god, he couldn't help but be shocked by such a powerful force at this distance.

However, the giant did not budge. Despite shaking, he firmly maintained his hand, which was protecting his eyes.

And there, the mountain's ring shone.

[You have activated the ring of revenge.]

The mountain unleashed an amount of damage equivalent to the damage it had received.

The god's own power struck back at him. His feet were pushed back, and finally, his arm was raised.

Bloodshot eyes appeared.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan imbues the boundary line with a sharp edge. He activates the sword of transformation, and with a swift strike, he pierces through. The giant closes his eyes late, but it's already too late. The boundary line pierces through his eyeballs.

Kwajik.

[Seventh fragment of the black giant @#%$%$] [!!!!!!]

A silent scream erupts.

A fierce howling engulfs Taesan. With all his might, Taesan tries to withstand it, but he's no match and falls to the ground.

[Are you okay?]

"No. I'm going to die."

Taesan struggles to get up, but the giant has grasped his eyeballs.

Between them, a stream of red blood flows out.

Taesan laughs with joy.

He has successfully inflicted an irreparable wound on the giant's body.

However, the situation is not as good as it seems.

He has exhausted all his strength. He has exceeded his limits and can no longer manipulate the boundary line. All his emergency skills have been activated.

Although the giant has lost his eyes, his sensory abilities alone are enough to crush Taesan.

The chances of victory are extremely slim.

But the onlookers who witnessed the battle thought differently.

Taesan is fighting against an unbeatable enemy, refusing to back down and fighting for them.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$And finally, at the end of the battle, she drove the sword into his fiery red eyes.

People burst with emotion at the sight, like a scene from a mythic struggle.

"Ah..."

Amelia couldn't help but let out a moan.

She thought Tanash was amazing, but she didn't worship him. She believed she could catch up to him one day. No matter how overwhelming Tanash's abilities were, her belief never wavered.

But now, her belief has shattered.

And in its place, a new belief begins to take hold.

Belief surges. Even the skeptics and the doubters empty their hearts, sending only one emotion.

All of humanity sends their worship towards Tanash.

And that worship soon becomes a power that dwells within Tanash.

* * *

In an instant, everything is restored.

The body surpasses its peak condition, reaching a place it had never reached before.

[The proficiency in Divine Power has increased by 1%.]
[Divine Power proficiency has reached 100%. Divine Power has evolved into [Sanctity].]
[You have become the [Earth's God].]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A change occurred in his senses. He couldn't put it into words, but he had obtained something.

It was something high-dimensional.

He turned his gaze. Where his gaze fell, there was the earth.

The earth felt closer.

The swaying wind and the trembling earth felt like his own limbs.

The giant wasn't just standing still, watching. He took a big step forward and swung his leg. Since all defense skills had been consumed, he had to dodge for sure.

But it wasn't that scary now.

Faith had materialized into a divine aura that enveloped his entire body.

Kwaaaang!

Taesan's sword clashed with the giant's foot.

His body was pushed back, but he didn't take any damage.

He had successfully blocked the giant's attack.

[This is...].

Akasha let out a sigh. Even she, who was directly in sync with Taesan, couldn't understand the realm he had reached.

[Master, what realm have you reached?]

Taesan didn't respond, instead gazing at the divine aura enveloping his body.

A brilliant, shining golden light.

Both its intensity and quality were different from before, transcending dimensions."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The giant, who had been staring at Taesan, activated the Great Collapse. A black sphere instantly turned sacred.

A gray sphere flew towards the giant.

The giant stretched out his hand and grasped the Great Collapse.

Kuuuuuuuuung!

The Great Collapse exploded, and the giant's hand trembled greatly.

From the open hand, red blood flowed out profusely.

[The seventh fragment of the Black Giant @^%$#%]

"Ha."

Taesan let out a deep breath.

A sense of omnipotence dominated his entire body. It felt like he could do anything.

He didn't restrain his power.

[You have activated the Creation of the Sacred Land.]

A brilliant golden light enveloped the world.

It was so bright that those who watched had to cover their eyes.

Taesan imbued it with blackness.

Although he had used up all his capacity, there were no longer any such limitations. The created sacred land was instantly dyed black.

Jerband, who was watching, was amazed.

A vast, ash-colored realm appeared in the world.

It was a realm that only Taesan could create, one that no one else could make.

[You have obtained the Chaos Realm.]

Let me know if you have any further requests!
