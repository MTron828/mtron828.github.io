**Episode 357**

357. The 76th Floor, Guides of Evil (2)

Floria didn't back down.

Even though he knew it was a losing battle, he continued to move forward, searching for an opening to strike.

Of course, it was impossible, but he couldn't give up.

Kwaaaang!

"Ugh!"

Floria was slammed to the ground, his entire body covered in wounds.

As he struggled in agony, Taesan struck him with his sword. Floria endured the pain and activated his skill.

[Floria activated his designated mark acceleration.] [You activated limited blink.]

"I'm getting tired of this."

As Floria's body accelerated, Taesan teleported above his head.

It was already clear where Floria would move to and where he would end up.

Floria belatedly raised his sword, but Taesan's sword pierced his chest.

Kwaduk.

"This is the end for me..."

[You have defeated Floria.] [Your level has increased.] [Your level has increased.] [According to the demon's contract, level-up recovery is limited.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Floria was defeated.

But it wasn't easy.

Taesan tried to block Floria's movement with Dekaravia's distorted ecosystem.

And Floria broke through it by mobilizing all the equipment she had.

As a result, Taesan had to continue activating Dekaravia's distorted ecosystem.

Although there was no significant loss of physical strength, her magic was reduced by nearly half.

Kuuuuung!

Floria's defeat was simultaneous with a surge of power. It was a fierce attack that didn't give any chance to recover.

Taesan drew his sword.

[You have activated a forced duel. For 12 seconds, you will not take damage from anyone except Gloria.] [Your proficiency in forced duels has increased by 1%.]

The attacks reaching Taesan were erased. The great warrior saint. Gloria was the next target. Taesan, wearing a golden armor and golden hair, charged towards the woman.

The woman, with a stern face, drew her sword.

"Light!"

[Gloria activated the saint's blessing.] [Gloria activated the chosen one.] [Gloria activated the holy incarnation.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The light enveloped her. Taesan realized that it was the divine power of God.

Gloria held a sword and shield, responding to Taesan's attack.

Ka-a-a-ang!

The shockwave covered Taesan.

"Did you withstand it?"

Taesan scowled. His current stats were 20,000, far surpassing those of Lee Tae-yeon. In a battle of strength, he couldn't handle it like Flora, and it was only normal.

But Gloria was not backing down from Taesan.

With holy light covering her entire body, she swung her sword wildly.

Ka-ga-ga-k!

[Gloria activated the Heavenly Punishment of the Sacred Sword.]

The air split, and swords of light rained down randomly. Due to Gloria's relentless attack, the defense was nullified.

"I am a warrior of God! Any being that dares to touch the ground cannot reach me!"

Gloria charged at Taesan with a shout filled with conviction.

Helia told her to stall for time, but she had no intention of following that advice.

Taesan had consumed a lot of energy while fighting Flora. If she poured everything into it, she could win. She believed so.

Ka-ga-ga-k!

Taesan blocked Gloria's attack and grasped the situation.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It wasn't her pure power. A high divine power was supporting her strength and speed.

Then...

How could one counter someone else's divinity? Taesan had experienced it in the world of ghosts.

Kiying!

A light burst out from Taesan. It was similar to the golden light wrapped around Gloria, but it was more intense and of a higher level.

"What?"

Gloria, who had been charging fiercely, stopped in her tracks.

A divine power was emanating from Taesan.

"How...?"

Before Gloria could even express her doubts, Taesan's divinity enveloped her.

Ka-chang!

"Kuek!"

The golden light wrapped around Gloria shattered like broken glass. The divine protection had disappeared.

"What, how...?"

Gloria looked at Taesan with a bewildered expression.

The entire room was surrounded by Taesan's divinity.

"It's possible after all."

Taesan muttered to himself. Divinity could be countered by another divinity. And the divinity wrapped around Gloria was not her own, but rather something she had received from someone else.

On the other hand, Taesan's divinity was his own. The difference in level was so great that he could shatter the divinity wrapped around Gloria.

Taesan leaped forward. Gloria was shocked and raised her shield."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Aaaaah!"

"Unbelievable!"

Gloria, who couldn't withstand the shock, stumbled backward.

From then on, it was an overwhelming battle. Gloria, who had lost her divine power, had no way to counterattack.

"What's going on?"

The other guides watching her let out a sigh.

"How is it possible to destroy Gloria's divine power? That's impossible!"

Gloria's power wasn't that great. Her speed was ordinary, and the skills she acquired while navigating the labyrinth weren't special either.

But she had a deep and sincere faith that no one could match.

She believed that no one trusted God as much as she did, and in reality, no one who believed in God could even come close to her divine power.

When she wore her divine power, other guides couldn't easily pierce through it. It was an ironclad shield, a solid wall that was different from the shaman's.

But now, it was being shattered by Taesan's divine power.

"It doesn't matter. It's only natural that he's stronger than us from the start."

Helia said nonchalantly, his lips curling up.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With this battle, I've used my divine power."

"With that level of divine power, Taesan won't be able to use it anymore."

"In the end, we will win."

As the battle continues, Taesan's power will be consumed one by one.

In the end, he will fight with all his cards exhausted.

"Hmph!"

Gloria, prepared for the absolute judgment, continued to recover and endure.

But that was all.

Crash.

Taesan's sword broke through her armor.

She spat out blood and fell.

"Ah, God... Now, to you..."

[Your level has increased.]

This time, I used my divine power. Now, I can't use boundary lines or boundary rebounds.

My health was also consumed, and I used the Sword of Devotion and Copy to take him down at once.

There was no time to rest. The next opponent is Cliff, the ruler of the black abyss.

He wielded an unfathomable darkness that had no bottom.

Whoa!

Endlessly, the deep and profound abyss erupted. Taesan has cast a spell.

[You have activated the Frozen World.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was a frozen world where magic overlap was used. The power contained within was undoubtedly the power of the gods, located at the edge of mortality.

But the moment it touched the darkness that burst out like a beast, it was buried and disappeared.

"Magic, black magic, is undoubtedly the power of the gods, but it's the mortal beings who wield it. It's out of my reach."

Cliff, who was covered in black, said so and pulled out even more power.

The darkness enveloped the world.

Everything was dyed and consumed.

Taesan activated black magic this time, but it was also consumed and covered Taesan.

While withstanding the attack with nullification, Taesan thought:

"Magic, black magic, it's not that."

It's a completely different power. And the power Cliff wielded was consuming all of Taesan's power.

After consuming three attack nullifications, Taesan realized:

The power Cliff wielded was the power of destruction.

It was the power to destroy the world, a power that the Demon King and those who received the mission to destroy the world possessed, consuming and annihilating everything. That's why magic and black magic didn't work.

But how a labyrinth adventurer like Cliff came to possess such power was unknown, but if that's the case, there's a card to counter it."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If they use the power of destruction, then we can use it too."

[You have ignited the spark of calamity.]

A flame of destruction bursts out. It's the power that the wolf who burned the world had. Cliff sneers.

"The power of a mere mortal is nothing to be concerned about."

Taesan was undoubtedly strong. The process of defeating Floria and Gloria was astonishing.

"But"

It was still just the power of a mortal. Impressive, but nothing more.

On the other hand, what he possessed was the power of destruction itself, which was beyond mortal reach from the start.

"If there was divinity, it would have been dangerous."

Divine power is the power of God. It could have countered the power of destruction he was unleashing.

But Taesan had already used divine power in his battle against Gloria.

He had used up all his cards to block his own power. Cliff was certain, and darkness burst forth.

The flame of destruction surged violently and collided with Cliff's darkness.

"......What?"

Cliff's face stiffens. Taesan is gathering his power once again.

[You have activated the call of destruction.]

The power of the demon king, who had destroyed the world of the undead, is realized.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Cliff's darkness is trampled and disappears in an instant. Cliff gathers his strength in shock.

"Don't laugh!"

He was the only survivor of a world destroyed by endless darkness.

Wandering the destroyed world, he absorbed the remnants of destruction that remained after destroying the world.

What he possessed was the power of destruction. It was his very being.

To defeat him, one had to either withstand his power until it was completely exhausted or attack his mind. His weakness was that his power consumption was enormous, making it impossible to fight for long.

But now, Taesan was pushing back against Cliff's power with his own strength.

"How can a mortal being! Possess the power of destruction!"

Kwaang!

The power explodes, and space opens up.

[You have activated acceleration.] [You have activated skill acceleration.]

Taesan dashes towards Cliff, his feet pounding the ground. Cliff hastily gathers his strength, but Taesan uses a limited blink to move behind Cliff's back.

"Move!"

The power envelops Taesan.

Taesan focuses his strength in his feet and swings his sword.

He pierces through the darkness and strikes Cliff's neck.

"Kkuek!"

He has succeeded in getting close.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Cliff had relied on the power of destruction to descend into the labyrinth, so his movements themselves were insignificant. The moment he allowed access, he had no chance of winning. He was quickly pushed back.

"...I also had the power of destruction. It doesn't matter. I've used it up in this battle too."

Helian barely managed to suppress his astonishment.

The power of divinity and destruction? It was unexpected, but nothing had changed. Taesan had exhausted his strength again this time. If he continued to exhaust his strength, he could win. His faith had not yet disappeared.

Next was the master of the echoing valley, Estevan.

He had a stiff, hardened face and waved his hand. The space opened, and numerous beasts emerged.

[Estevan summoned a biting wolf.] [Estevan summoned a terrifying beast.] [Estevan summoned a rat hiding in the shadows.]

Numerous distorted beasts charged at Taesan.

While Taesan was fighting with other guides, Estevan had finished preparing and summoned an endless number of beasts, each one incredibly powerful. Taesan couldn't easily defeat them either.

"Do you think it's a very foolish method to fight by moving your own body?"

"Is that so?"

Then Taesan would also respond with summoning."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You are the King of the Wind Spirit. You summoned Minerva.] [You are a shield of diverse colors. You summoned Barcas.]

The beasts that were running wildly with the wind suddenly take flight.

Minerva lets out a sly smile.

"This is easy to understand!"

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The wind blows fiercely in all directions. Esteban's face stiffens.

"......This is beyond my expectations."

Minerva has gone mad, absorbing the power of the Fire Spirit King and obtaining the remaining power. She is now stronger than when she fought Shaiyan.

The wind and beasts collide and explode.

Esteban grits his teeth and grabs the air.

[Esteban summoned the Lord of the Valley.]

A massive snake appears from beyond the space.

The power contained within it is the ultimate limit of mortality.

Esteban's lifelong companion, who has never been defeated or yielded, is his symbol itself.

"Hoo."

Minerva's fighting spirit burns brighter as she gathers her power.

The collision occurs. The wind and the snake's body clash, releasing a massive wave of power.

Minerva is certainly strong, but the Lord of the Valley is also a trump card held by a deep-seated adventurer. It's not easily pushed back.

Ku-u-u-ung!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The powers collide. Minerva and the owner of the valley exert their full strength against each other, and Taesan also doesn't remain still.

Taesan charges towards Esteban.

Esteban opens up space.

Innumerable beasts emerge one after another. A massive gorilla swings its fists, and a wolf-like beast targets the neck.

There are too many to take down one by one.

[You activate Magic Overlap.]

The overlapped frozen world rushes in. Taesan gathers his strength once again.

[You activate Forced Amplification.]

Zzzt! Zzzt!

The extreme cold envelops the entire space. The beasts scream and try to resist, but the frost freezes all their resistance.

In an instant, a frozen space is formed.

[You activate Starlight Arrow.]

The arrow shoots towards Esteban. Esteban is shocked and opens up space again, summoning more beasts.

The endless stream of beasts is wiped out by magic.

Esteban's trump card. The owner of the valley is fighting Minerva. The remaining beasts are not weak, but they are not at a level that can rival Taesan.

[Ahhhh!]

"It can't be!"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The owner of the valley was about to move in response to Esteban's crisis, but Minerva blew away the wind and suppressed him.

The battle continued.

"……."

Helia couldn't say that they could win, that they had exhausted their strength.

She just kept her mouth shut and watched the battle with a stiff, hardened face.

Taesan, who had trampled and defeated the beasts, pierced Esteban's chest.

Esteban spat out blood and shouted.

"It's your victory. But I won't die easily! Monster!"

[Esteban activated the forced return of all summoned creatures.]

Kugugugugu!

"Ugh!"

In an instant, Minerva and Barcaza's bodies distorted. All summoned creatures within the designated space began to be forcibly returned.

Minerva tried to resist with all her might, but Esteban's final strength, which had grasped the space itself, continued to press down on Minerva.

"I can't fight anymore. I have to go back. You win, master."

"Alright."

Minerva and Barcaza disappeared.

Taesan raised his sword.

"Next."
