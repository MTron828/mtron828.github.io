Chapter 537

537. The Pantheon (3)

A quiet voice resonates. The voice is too small and faint, so no transcendent being pays attention to it.

Only Taesan listens to Rakiratas's words.

Taesan's gaze falls on Rakiratas, who looks back at him with a mysterious smile.

Zhelvand opens his mouth.

[Didn't you call us to confirm something? Then can't we just confirm it?]

"Are you confirming?"

[We can't read you. It's not just the transcendent beings, but I also can't.]

Baal says. Even he, who is close to being a god, can't read Taesan.

[So, let's try to understand you properly here.] [Essence and Baal, and we'll combine our powers to read you. There's no reason we can't read you.] [We'll read you and understand what your true nature is close to. Our actions will change depending on the result.]

"Then do it."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There was no reason to refuse the offer. Although it was a bit embarrassing to reveal himself in front of the transcenders, it wasn't a big problem.

On the contrary, if he could learn more about himself through this opportunity, it wouldn't be bad either.

[Hmm.]

But the Essential had a strange face.

The god of essence, who was supposed to be confident, was now uncertain.

[What's the harm in trying?] [Then let's start right away. It's been a while since everyone gathered their strength together.] [Has it been a thousand years?] [It's been even longer than that.]

A quiet murmur arose, and a massive power and intensity that contrasted with it was felt.

'...This is.'

It's enormous.

No other emotions were possible. It was simply enormous. Even though it could be read, it had to be given up. A transcender who ruled the universe itself. Something created by the eighteen of them gathering their strength together.

It was a catalyst for amplification.

[Then I'll ask.] [I understand.]

The god of essence exercises his authority. The authority to grasp and read the essence of objects and individuals, permitted only to the Essential.

That authority, using the transcenders' catalyst, becomes even more enormous.

A collection of authorities that could reveal even the deepest inner workings, even if it was a high-ranking god.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It covers the Taesan. It tries to bring out everything from Taesan and reveal it to the world.

Grrr...

The beast's roar is heard. It seems to dislike the power that covers it, and it tries to resist.

"Stay still."

Taesan suppresses the beast. Although the beast lets out a dissatisfied cry, it follows its master's orders.

Ku-gu-gu-gung......

The power that has finished its task slowly fades away. The true god retrieves the power.

[What happened?]

Other transcendents ask the true god. The true god doesn't answer.

It just has a slightly annoyed, but somehow expected, expression. The face of the demon god changes when it sees that expression.

[Impossible.] [Can't read it.]

The true god scatters the retrieved power.

It was completely empty.

[Can't see anything. What it is, what level it has reached, what its foundation is.]

* * *

A small ripple spreads momentarily. Since everyone is a transcendent, there is no frivolity. It was a wave that barely touched the surface.

But a clear wave, nonetheless.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The fact that the Transcendents showed emotions on the surface was an event in itself.

[Is that possible?]

Lakiratas asked with an interested tone.

"You are a god of essence. We lent you our power, and Baal was also with us. Even if it's a high-ranking god, you should be able to read it, but you didn't understand anything?" [In reality, that's what happened, so even if you ask me, I can't answer. Still, it's amazing.]

Essential gazed at Taesan. There was curiosity in his eyes.

[The fact that you can't read this either... the possibilities are narrowing down.]

The power of essence he used now was amplified by many Transcendents and Baal, allowing him to read a lot of things.

It went beyond the concept of this world, even if it's a high-ranking god.

And yet, the fact that he couldn't read it was one thing.

Taesan meant that it was neither of the two.

It was something completely different. From the start, the method itself was close to being wrong.

[So, in the end, there's no answer.]

The plan was distorted.

[There's nothing we can know.]

Dersha spoke roughly."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[The balance has already been broken. It won't be long before their filthy power spreads throughout the universe.]

[We need to stop the broken balance, but... we can only do that after their power has weakened a bit. At the very least, we need to exclude two or three of the gods and then it might be possible.]

[In the end, war is unavoidable.]

It's an ancient story, one that even transcendent beings can hardly remember.

The war against the gods.

Many gods lost themselves in that war. We succeeded in banishing the gods, but the damage was not insignificant.

[The problem is, we've become weaker than we were back then.]

Many transcendent beings died.

Even though it was a long time ago, the number of losses has not been fully recovered.

On the other hand, the gods' losses were minimal. They don't have the concept of death, so they didn't disappear. Except for a few, they didn't perish.

They've become weaker, but our enemies haven't.

Derisha looked at Baal.

[If the demon hadn't betrayed us back then, I wonder what would have happened.] [If you had treated me a bit more kindly, excluding the demon, you're too cold towards me, it hurts my heart.] [Shut up.]

Derisha ignored Baal's words and continued.

[We can't guarantee victory.]

The probability of defeat was higher.

That's the reality.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[And besides, that dirty traitor is on their side. That individual may not be a big problem, but as a being in this world, they could have some influence in some way.]

Derusha said with a distorted face in the silence.

"[So, there's no need to leave the unstable element behind.]

The enemy is heading towards Taesan.

"[As transcendents, we can't read where that thing has reached. It's like a divine message.] [It's different from a divine message. If we had the power from earlier, we could have read everything even if it was a divine message.] [So, it's a more troublesome existence.]

They can't guarantee victory even if they don't do anything. There's no need to leave the unstable element Taesan behind.

That was Derusha's judgment, and it wasn't particularly wrong. In reality, many transcendents were sending hostility and murderous intent towards Taesan.

But there were also many transcendents who opposed that.

"[No way.]"

Mashin said softly, his cat-like eyes curving softly.

"[He can help us. I'm sure of it.] [It's not a wrong thing to say.]"

The god of choice, Maria, agreed with Mashin's words."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He saved the beloved goddess Levienov. We removed the contamination that we couldn't resolve and purified her. And most importantly, he killed the High God. It's an achievement we've never accomplished before."

"The High God was the weakest, and it's embarrassing to even call it a High God. During the process of breaking through the seal, it lost a significant amount of power and dignity, becoming extremely weak."

"But still, the High God was a High God. It was an existence that didn't understand the concept of death."

"Taesan annihilated that High God."

"He doesn't oppose us. He's not in a hostile relationship with the High Gods. You can tell just by looking at what's happened so far."

"The problem with his inner self has also been resolved. He's free now. We can't read his mind, but that's not a big issue."

"Transcenders who have a connection with Taesan and have a favorable impression of him are defending Taesan."

"He can help us. In the upcoming war against the High Gods, his uniqueness can become a great strength."

"But the opposite is also true."

"The opinions don't align. A quiet mage who was listening shakes his head."

"Let's just have a simple vote. How many Transcenders think Taesan should be dealt with?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Transcenders express their opinions in their own ways. Nine transcenders claim that they must handle the Taesan."

"What about the opposition?"

The opinions were expressed again. There were nine.

"It's half and half."

The transcenders who were not present here were either neutral or didn't have the qualification to express their opinions about Taesan.

In the end, everything had to be decided here.

Derusha raised her finger with a distorted face.

[Yes. I won't deny your opinions either. We might be on the same side. But you're overlooking something.] [What is it?] [Do you think that existence can really help us with its power?]

There was no answer. Derusha twisted her lips.

[It's strong, but that's all. Even the transcenders outside could handle it to some extent. What we need for the upcoming war is not just a strong person. We need an overwhelming power.]

A strong person who can face the entire Holy Spirit alone.

It had to be a transcender who could govern a single concept. Derusha seized the opportunity and continued speaking quickly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's easier to destroy than to restore. Even if it's weak, it's possible to expand the cracks that have already been damaged. There's no need to leave behind useless things that don't help.

Then, let's just verify it directly.

Lakiratas's voice echoed. Dersha scowled.

...What's going on? ...Don't we need to go through the verification process? We can't read his realm.

Not even the gods of the universe could understand the realm that Gangtaesan had reached. It meant that no one in the universe could read it.

Then, there was only one way to verify it.

To fight him directly.

To reveal everything, using all our strength.

Mashin said with a serious tone.

"Should one of us fight him?" "I don't think it's a bad judgment if we choose correctly."

Lakiratas looked at Dersha.

"You're excluded first, Dersha. Your power is the power of death. It's useless against someone who doesn't have the concept of death, so you weren't of much help in the war of the gods either." ...

Dersha wanted to retort, but kept his mouth shut. It was the truth.

Dersha was the god of death, who had existed since the creation of the universe."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Although it boasts of its immense power, its limitations were clear. It was powerless against beings that didn't understand the concept of death.

[You know that your powers don't work on emotional opponents, but it would be nice if you could calm down a bit.]

"I am not a god," Taesan argued. Rakiratas smiled quietly.

[Then, does the concept of death exist for you?]

"……."

Taesan couldn't answer.

[We'll verify that part later. Dersha, you're excluded. Those who are hostile towards him are also excluded. Even if we've finished verifying, we might still try to kill him.]

[Then…….]

Mashin's eyes sparkled. She tried to stand up, but Rakiratas stopped her.

[Those who have feelings for him are also excluded. It seems like you can't seriously try to kill him.]

Rakiratas said lightly.

[You can't know through simple duels or practice. You have to risk your life and fight with all your heart to understand his true nature. You're also incapable of that.]

[…So what's the conclusion?] [I'll take care of it.]

Rakiratas said.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

In his eyes, a strong passion and struggle were visible.

[I'll test him directly myself.] [What?] [What's that supposed to mean?] [It's been a while since the last trial. Gang Tae-san.]

Rakiratas ignored the words of other transcendents. His gaze was fixed only on Tae-san.

[Prove yourself to me.] [Sub-quest starts] [Rakiratas wants to test you. If you accept, the trial will come to you. If you win, there will be a reward.] [Reward: Rakiratas will determine it based on your achievement.] [Rakiratas's trial: Prove your struggle and death to Rakiratas.]
