**Episode 458**

**458. The Seventh Return, Earth (10)**

The ash-colored domain covers the entire United States. At the same time, the screen that Zelvand had been showing to people is cut off.

"Huh?"

"What's going on?"

People are confused. Lee Tae-yeon also unknowingly looks at Zelvand, but Zelvand shakes his head.

"It's not me who did it. It's what he did."

"What?"

"This is interesting."

Zelvand looks at the ash-colored domain with an interested face.

Zelvand's magic had been forcibly canceled within the ash-colored domain without permission.

Even with his vision, he couldn't understand what kind of power was contained within the ash.

It was literally heterogeneous. This space couldn't be said to be part of this world.

But it wasn't a divine space either.

It was a space created solely for Taesan.

**Kwaaaang!**

The battle continues within the ash-colored domain. Taesan, covered in ash, charges towards Godsin.

The giant raises his arm and strikes down. Taesan doesn't back down and leaps forward, wielding his sword to slash at the ash.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Waaaah!"

Taesan was pushed back. But he wasn't the only one who was pushed back.

The giant also stumbled backward.

He managed to counterattack the blow that was meant to kill him.

The giant, looking displeased, straightened up and stretched out his arm. Taesan activated his Great Collapse.

[You have activated Great Collapse [Chaos].]

The grayish Great Collapse collided with the giant.

With a loud crash, the giant's arm was pushed back.

[!!!!!]

A howling sound erupted. The giant's deafening roar. The power contained within was extremely strong. If he had his original power, this alone would have torn the atmosphere apart.

But not here.

Taesan, who had triggered the howling and absorbed it, put strength into his legs and charged at the giant.

"Woooaaaah!"

He wrapped the boundary line around his entire body, strengthening his physique and swinging his arms. The giant's massive fist and sword clashed, causing the space to violently shake.

"Waaaah!"

This is Taesan's domain.

Everything is in his grasp.

The giant began to stumble backward, focusing on defense rather than attack.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The dark ash that had engulfed the world climbed up the giant's leg and wrapped around its body. The giant tried to shake it off, but the dark ash clung to it, slowly covering its entire body.

Kagaga!

A scar appeared on the giant's wrist where it had clashed with Taesan's sword. Blood gushed out like a waterfall.

In the world of dark ash, the power that had bound the giant's body began to distort and shatter.

Quadduduk!

The giant's fingers were blown away, and flesh scattered in all directions.

Taesan held his sword tightly and struck his chest with a loud thud.

Kwaaaang!

The giant couldn't withstand it and collapsed. Taesan stood on its chest.

"Devour it."

Chwaachwaak!

According to Taesan's will, the dark ash rose up and clung to the giant's entire body. It grasped its limbs and ripped open its chest. In an instant, the giant's internal organs were exposed. The giant tried to resist, but it couldn't shake off the dark ash that had wrapped around its entire body.

And inside its chest, the giant's core was revealed.

Taesan reached out into the air, and space split open.

[You have activated the World Sword [Chaos].]

It was a broken World Sword.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It took a long time to recover the Black Sword of the World after it was used once. Moreover, it was broken due to the giant's attack, so it couldn't be used for a while.

But it doesn't matter.

The ash-colored aura is gathering. The boundary line is filled with the fragments of the broken World Sword.

Holding the sword mixed with ash, I strike down at the giant's core.

Quadruple shock!

The giant's core screams. The giant resists, shaking its entire body, but the ash-colored aura doesn't budge.

The core can't withstand it and cracks like a spider's web. Taesan gathers all the power of the world into the sword and gives it strength.

Kaang!

The core shatters like a glass bead. The power contained within bursts out into the world. It tries to return to its owner, transcending space.

But the boundary line forcibly blocks its movement. As Taesan's spiritual power rises, it forcibly steals the power trying to return to its owner."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have defeated the seventh fragment of the World Destroyer.] [Your spiritual power has been activated.] [The proficiency of your twisted spiritual tuning has increased by 6%.] [The proficiency of your black aura has increased by 6%.] [The proficiency of your boundary line has increased by!%@@#.] [The proficiency of your will of all things has increased by 5%.] [The proficiency of your chaos domain has increased by #%!@.] [You have stolen the transcendent [Self-Immutable].] [You have fought against the high god and won, without your will being broken. You have obtained the special skill [Resistance to the Beyond].]

The system window closed, and a small droplet of blood appeared in the broken core.

Taesan reached out and grabbed the droplet of blood.

[You have obtained the World Destroyer's blood.]

It was over.

Taesan turned off the chaos domain. Suddenly, a strong sense of exhaustion and fatigue dominated his entire body. His body, which was normally immune to fatigue, was in a state of exhaustion.

"It was closer than I thought."

The gray light faded, and Zelvand's magic began to work again.

What people saw was Taesan standing alone in the desolate world.

Taesan was the victor.

A thunderous applause erupted, loud enough to shake the United States.

They had survived.

They had won.

[Quest complete.] [You will return to the labyrinth in a week.]

* * *

A celebration began. Normally, people wouldn't be overly joyful after completing a global quest, as the damage was too great.

But this time was different.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The quest to protect the pillar also suffered minimal damage thanks to Taesan, and in the final quest, not a single person died.

It was a perfect clear that couldn't be more successful.

And then there was the power and authority that Taesan displayed.

They emerged victorious against a monster that was impossible to describe, and the atmosphere couldn't be bad.

Taesan was also fully satisfied. He had achieved all the goals he had aimed for.

[Divine] [Proficiency: ???] [A symbol obtained by one who receives the world's faith, achieving one of the qualifications to be called a god.]

His divine power transformed into perfect divinity.

And the change that occurred was enormous.

Taesan effortlessly exerted his power. A golden light spread throughout the world, eventually covering the entire United States.

And there was no significant consumption of power or mental energy.

Until now, there had been a limit to the power of divinity. It seemed to be blocked, as if it wouldn't be allowed to exceed a certain level.

But now that limit has disappeared.

If the total amount of power permits, it's possible to cover the entire world with divinity."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The quality and scope of the divine power had also changed. Until now, the divine power had focused on recovering physical strength and playing a defensive role, but now it could be used for attacks as well.

That's why Taesan was able to successfully defend against Goshin's attack using only his divine power.

Moreover, it was now possible to imbue magic or dark magic with divine power.

It could strengthen one's entire body and even oppress one's opponent. In terms of auxiliary abilities, it was almost omnipotent.

To that extent, the boundary of mixing divine power with blackness could also be utilized to a significant degree. It was no longer just about wrapping oneself in a sword or protecting one's entire body, but about creating a domain itself.

[Chaotic Domain] [Proficiency: ???] [A domain created by mixing divine power with blackness. The user can control everything within the domain according to their will.]

Taesan, who had been gazing at his skills, activated the Chaotic Domain.

He unfolded it to a small range, about the size of a single building.

It was a grayish domain.

As the master of the domain, Taesan knew.

Here, the laws of the world did not apply.

If one wanted to, they could even erase the concept of death itself in this place.

Of course, there were limitations."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

On Earth, the amount of divine power he received was infinite, and it was as if the constraints had virtually disappeared.

However, even with the divine power he received, he couldn't keep up with the amount of divine power being consumed in the Chaos Realm.

It was difficult to predict whether he could withstand the consumption rate in a place other than Earth.

As he was checking the effects and constraints, someone stepped into his world.

"How do you feel?"

"Not bad," Taesan replied.

Zelvand smiled brightly and entered the ash-colored realm.

Taesan looked at him. This was his world. He could read Zelvand's power and strength.

But at the same time, Taesan realized.

He still couldn't read everything.

He could understand the surface-level parts, but it was impossible to grasp Zelvand's deeper aspects.

"It's still far away."

"Really? I think it's the opposite," Zelvand said.

Zelvand stretched out his arm. Magic was about to take shape, but the ash-colored space did not permit it.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The realm you've reached now is a realm that only applies here. It may not be much when viewed from the entire universe, but it's not that rare either. From my perspective, it's not that impressive. It's a place where one's own world is limited and incomplete when they step out of their own world."

"Like Harmon and Lebinafov, it was a realm achieved through faith."

"And those gods had a huge gap with the transcendent beings who truly dominated the concept."

"You can see that just by how easily the demon god crushed Harmon."

"But even I, a god of magic, cannot use magic freely in your space. Of course, if I were to seriously try to kill you, the story would be different... but even that is hard to believe."

"The limited transcendent being, Taesan, created a gray space that dominated and controlled the concept of magic, restricting the magic handled by Zelvand."

"It was clear that the chaotic realm had its own unique characteristics."

"Of course, it's still lacking. The place you've reached is an unstable place achieved only through faith. That alone is not enough to reach us. But... if you were to rise to a place equal to ours, what would happen?"

"There was pure curiosity on Zelvand's face."

"Taesan shook his head."

"I don't know how to achieve it either."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He was in a bewildered state.

Even the wizard who created the labyrinth didn't know what had happened to him. Looking ahead, he couldn't be sure what his goal was or how to reach the same level as the transcenders.

Zelvand laughed.

"Take your time, we'll help you."

Zelvand's power was revealed. Taesan escaped from the chaotic realm.

"There's a lot more to talk about, but... first, I need to do what I have to do. You've won against the divine punishment. You deserve a reward."

[Divine power is revealed.] [Blessings are bestowed.] [You have obtained the divine blessing of magical talent.]

The blessing is bestowed upon all humanity.

People who were enjoying the festival are stunned. They feel a new sensation they've never experienced before.

[Divine blessing: magical talent] [This is a divine blessing. You will gain talent in magic. Additionally, by receiving recognition from the god of magic and offering sacrifices, you can obtain magic.]

"...... Are you okay?"

Magic is something that, except for a very small number of talented individuals, cannot be learned.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You could tell just by looking at Bardley, who couldn't even handle magic properly and gave up.

But now, all humans on Earth can use magic.

"'The cost is high, but you've shown me something worthy, so it doesn't matter. However, this blessing is meaningless to you. So, I'll give you something of your own.'

The God of Magic laughed.

"'You defeated the golem on your own without my help, using only your own power. You still have a lot of capacity left.'

Power flowed from him once again. But it wasn't to someone else - it was to Taesan.

[You have acquired the advanced magic [Teleport].] [You have acquired the title [Great Mage].]"
