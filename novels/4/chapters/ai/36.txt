Episode 37

37. 5th Floor, God of Victory. Baltazahr (2)

Taesan continued to move through the rooms. Without a single break, he ran all the way to the fifth room at a rapid pace and managed to clear it.

"It's getting tougher."

Taesan massaged his tingling wrists. As the rooms progressed, the orcs became stronger, and the last one was a bit risky. From now on, he could expect opponents strong enough to merit substantial rewards.

Instead of heading straight to the next room, Taesan sat down on the floor.

The trial of the God of Victory was a series of 1:1 victories. The repetition was starting to wear him out.

"It's getting a bit disappointing."

As the matches forced a 1:1 situation, there were fewer variables to exploit for gains. As the opponents grew stronger, there was less room to develop skills, and his stats were not yet at that level.

[The gods give appropriate rewards. There's no need to be disappointed.]

"I guess so."

It wasn't all bad right now.

The stronger the opponent, the greater the boost in morale. On top of that, he had obtained some small items. Selling them in the shop would fetch a decent amount of money.
Now, if we pass through here, it's the 6th floor. And we can learn magic.

"Were you a humble soul hoping for magic?"

"That kid?"

"How did you find out?"

The woman named Lillis was weak. Despite surviving for quite a while, she hadn't managed to pass the 10th floor yet. Taesan hadn't expected such a weak presence to be here.

"Do you know that the constraints of lifespan disappear here?"

Taesan nodded.

In the labyrinth, lifespan wasn't an issue. If it were, most players would age and die or become elderly before they could exit.

"She's been here since I first entered the labyrinth. She was moaning on the 4th floor just like now. I felt sorry seeing her about to be killed by orcs, so I saved her and listened to her story. She's truly a pitiful soul."

"... How long has it been?"

"Well, how long? Perhaps not more than a hundred years in outside time?"

She hadn't managed to leave the 10th floor in over a hundred years. She hadn't properly learned magic either.

It was a distant tale.
Here is the English translation of the text:

"He entered here to learn magic, but he was a pitiful guy with no talent even to grasp a simple spell. He was so pitiful that I helped him a bit. I never thought he would still be alive."

The ghost murmured in an amazed voice.

Indeed, that was the case. Not aiming for the top, but surviving for a hundred years without dying was an impressive feat in itself.

"Are there NPCs like that here?"

People who came in with their own goals, not to conquer the labyrinth.

There was certainly a possibility.

* * *

After a brief rest, Taesan broke through the room once again.

Abandoning the melee and repeating victories, he finally cleared the ninth room.

The ninth was a named orc, a being named Valtaran. He began the battle shouting for an honorable death towards Taesan,

And Taesan emerged victorious.

The watching ghost exclaimed in admiration.

"So it wasn't just a high-level skill, but could also be countered. I didn't know that either."

As an orc named Valtaran, he used many skills including "Parry". Ordinary players would have been confused by the variety of skills, but it was actually beneficial for Taesan. He knew all the weaknesses and countermeasures of "Parry".
Here is the English translation of the text:

"On Valt's torso, red blood was flowing. It won't be long before he dies from bleeding.

It was his victory.

"My friend. Who are you?"

Valt's face showed perplexity instead of anger or joy at his defeat.

"Amazing. To utilize counters like that. It's astonishing. Indeed, you are a great warrior. But... I wonder. Are you truly an adventurer of the 5th floor?"

Valt had activated his flow and charged. Though his assault, which neglected defense, might have revealed openings from confusion, Taesan easily thwarted it.

Taesan activated his counter and charged forward.

Attacking the opponent and preventing the flow, the disrupted orbit revealed openings, and the body, which was manipulated by the opponent's weapon, was forced to activate the counter to regain control of the body.

Counter is a skill that forcibly moves the body.

Even if the trajectory was disrupted by the flow, it immediately corrected the body.

At first glance, it sounds like a reasonable method.

It's the perfect answer that can change the course of the fight in an instant, as it focuses on the counter, allowing for greater damage.


Here is the English translation of the text:

"However, that answer can only be derived after penetrating countless labyrinths, understanding the activation method, advantages, disadvantages, and numerous conditions of the skill.

"It's not just information. It's movement experienced and felt directly. It's unknowable."

Taesan remained silent.

Valt broke into a satisfied smile.

"Doubts remain... but it was a satisfying fight. I have something to boast to my comrades."

The orc took off an earring and tossed it over.

"You also value material rewards in victory. Take it, human. It's a reward of victory."

A monster giving a reward directly.

Taesan collected the earring with surprise.

"Go. Warrior."

The vitality faded from Valt's face.

[You are an elite orc. You defeated Valt.]

* * *

Orcs.

They hope for an honorable death.

There must be a reason they accepted the trial of the gods.

Taesan inspected the earring.

[Valt's Earring] [Strength +5] [An earring Valt made himself when he came of age. It's said that items used with affection gain strength over time.]

A strength stat of 5. It wasn't an item that could be obtained on at least the 5th floor.

And victory rewards.
Here is the English translation of the text:

[You have defeated a formidable opponent single-handedly. Strength permanently increases by 4. Agility permanently increases by 3. Stamina permanently increases by 10.] [Your Resolute Rise has been triggered. Strength permanently increases by 5. Agility permanently increases by 4. Stamina permanently increases by 5.] [Your Resolute Rise has been triggered. Proficiency in Dropping increases by 7%.]

And here's one more.

[Your Thirst for Victory has been triggered. Strength permanently increases by 4. Agility permanently increases by 3. Stamina permanently increases by 10.]

The total increase in simple stat points was 23. Stamina increased by a total of 25. Proficiency also increased by 7%.

"Quite useful."

In fact, these increases were not just simple numbers. They were skills reaching the highest tier: Contempt of the Strong, Thirst for Victory, Thirst for Battle—all three were at the top level.

Though his level had not increased, it felt like his stats had. Additionally, proficiency in Dropping was nearing 50%.

Taesan, after confirming everything, checked his status window.

[Gang Taesan] [Level: 15] [Shield: 24/24] [Health: 575/575] [Mana: 80/80] [Strength: 112] [Intelligence: 75] [Agility: 85] [Attack +18] [Defense +19] [Condition: Optimal.]

His Strength had already surpassed the stats he had reached before. Agility was also on the edge.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Reaching 100 floors after barely clearing the 5th floor was equivalent to that time. The difference was truly unbelievable.

And I was able to gain a skill as well.

[Special Passive Skill: Fair Duel] [Proficiency: 1%] [Stats increase when in a 1:1 situation with an opponent, amount of increase proportional to proficiency.]

I haven't had a chance to use it yet, so I don't know how much the stats will increase, but it's a passive skill. Since it doesn't consume mana, that's the only advantage. Of course, it's good to have.

Now I have exactly 30 skills.

And only one room remains.

Before going, Taesan discussed it on the community board. While Taesan was breaking through, Itaeyeon and Kang Junhyuk were slowly clearing the 2nd floor as well.

[Itaeyeon [Alone]: I slightly open the door and throw stone-like things to lure them in one by one, so I manage to catch them.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Noona, you're really good at thinking about these things.]

They were figuring out how to catch goblins and clearing each room one by one.

The progress was slow, but since it was moving forward, it was a method close to the correct answer."
Here is the English translation of the text:

"Players from the 1st floor were gradually heading towards the 2nd floor as well. With Giant Rats, if you have oil and Molotov cocktails, it's not that difficult to clear them.

However, surviving beyond that was a separate matter, and Taesan couldn't help with that.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: It's better to gather everything you can on the 1st floor before moving on. Recovery methods disappear on the 2nd floor.] [Moon Jaesung [Alone]: Agreed.]

The Fountain of Life ceases functioning the moment you leave the 1st floor.

Because rewards also drastically diminish, it was difficult to go back and grind.

Time passed with some warnings and advice given.

Most of the community consisted of players in Alone mode. Players in other modes didn't need to use the community as they met face-to-face.

[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Oh, hyung, I found the altar.] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: Do you expect me to listen if you speak?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: You're saying it like that, so I have to listen. You know better than me.] [Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: It's fascinating. Even hearing that, you still want to do it? I didn't even want to touch it.]

They were discussing like that."
[Choi Junghyuk [Easy]: They're just fooling around.]

[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: ...Me?]

[Choi Junghyuk [Easy]: Seriously, they're doing everything from drumming to gonging. Can't you do it moderately without furrowing your brow?]

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: What are you saying?]

[Choi Junghyuk [Easy]: Stop showing off.]

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: ...Showing off?]

Lee Taeyeon posted a short message. It contained many meaningful words.

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: Are we, showing off?]

[Choi Junghyuk [Easy]: Then what? You guys are really just fooling around.]

Posts filled with this resentment continued to come up.

[Choi Junghyuk [Easy]: When I quietly observe, it's absurd. What? Can't even touch the Giant Rats? You have to burn them down without dreaming of a head-on battle with the boss? Where is that place?]

[Lee Taeyeon [Alone]: ...You.]

[Choi Junghyuk [Easy]: Don't show off in the community as if it's somewhere others don't know about. Right? Let's keep it moderate.]

[Gal Heejoong [Easy]: That's right. It's not that kind of community over there, right? I understand you can't meet people, but could you please restrain yourself a bit?]

[Moon Suhan [Easy]: Isn't it more like not being able to meet people? Isn't it just scamming?]

Posts from Easy mode players flooded in. Alone mode players, who had been staring blankly, erupted in anger.
[Lee Sang [Alone]: You guys!]
[Moon Jaesung [Alone]: Are you calling that a comment now? How do you think we feel while we're here like this?]
[Kim Taejin [Alone]: Wow. Seriously ridiculous ㅋㅋㅋ Choosing Easy mode and saying things like that?]
[Gal Heejoong [Easy]: Who told you to choose Alone mode? You guys chose it yourselves, so why the uproar?]
[Choi Junghyuk [Easy]: Other mode players are all quiet, seriously. They talk too much.]

Emotions intensify as they begin to argue. The emotions go back and forth as if they were about to stab each other with a sword.

Taesan calmly watched the scene unfold.

Earthlings entered the labyrinth and a month passed. It was a time to settle down after adapting to Easy or Normal mode. From here on, as long as you pay attention to safety, there's no chance of dying.

And leisure makes people focus elsewhere.

They want to release the anger trapped in a horrible place.

They want to create something to release their emotions.

Players in Alone mode, who chatter incessantly in the community, are the most appropriate targets.

Easy mode players felt even more so because they couldn't feel that difficulty.

"But still, it wasn't supposed to be like this."

There were disputes in the previous world too, but it didn't escalate to this extent.

They are all victims trapped in the same place. Victims resent other victims more than the perpetrators, but still, there is a sense of camaraderie, so it ended as a minor quarrel.

Taesan looked at the posts coming up.
[Choi Junghyuk [Easy]: Wow. Is this really Easy mode? Are you making fun of Easy mode players? It's not a joke ㅋㅋㅋ]

Choi Junghyuk.

A name he had seen in the previous world.

"Of course, it's him."

"What about him?"

"Talking about this side."

He must have intensified emotions. Taesan, who had been watching quietly, raised the corners of his mouth.

[Choi Junghyuk [Easy]: And Kang Taesan? He's the funniest. What's with all the boasting? I burst out laughing when I saw it for real.] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Is he really crazy?] [Choi Junghyuk [Easy]: Even their skills are absurd. Endure in HP1 state? Isn't that just telling us to die? Why do you guys believe in such nonsense?]

Snickering.

Laughter broke out.

It's understandable why Choi Junghyuk is coming out like this. He probably formed a guild by now. In the previous world, there was a troublemaker named Gra, but now, with no one to stop him, he practically conquered everything.

And every group needs enemies.

A labyrinth isn't something huge, but an enemy big enough to vent emotions and blow off steam.

Choi Junghyuk is not a fool.
Alone mode and Easy mode cannot meet, and if what the Alone mode says is true, they must think that clearing is impossible to say such things.

Those who only make difficult noises but cannot meet.

It was appropriate as an enemy target.

But Choi Junghyuk didn't know one thing.

Taesan calmly posted a message.

[Kang Taesan [Alone]: See you in a month.] [Choi Junghyuk [Easy]: ...What?]

He seemed bewildered.

Taesan didn't say anything more and closed the community.

He was about to pay the price for making fun of him.

He intended to go down before that.

[Are you just going to skip it?]

"There's no reason to delay."

Taesan got up.

There was almost no depletion of fatigue. His health and mana were also restored simultaneously with the fall.

Taesan headed to the next room.

[Orc chieftain. Ratran appeared.]

A single orc was waiting for him, wielding a greatsword with both hands planted on the ground.

"You're not a lord."

"Will a lord like you come out already? That's weird. If that guy's legs were still intact, you'd be dead."
Here is the translation of the text:

"Even with the significant penalty of being unable to move, it's difficult to guarantee victory against Road Rank. Orcs are superior monsters compared to goblins, so even if they have become stronger, it would be nearly impossible to overcome them.

"The tribe chief is not weak either. He possesses the strength to handle a chief alone. As this is the final trial, the caliber is high, and while adventurers here face formidable foes... well, if it's you, you'll overcome it."

His calm words carried a clear sense of trust.

Ratran looked at him and spoke.

"So you've come this far. Great warrior. I appreciate your fighting spirit. We should have an enjoyable duel."

Ratran wielded his greatsword.

"Your proud comrades must have left satisfied?"

Taesan nodded. Ratran grinned.

"Then that's good. I used to think gods were useless... but this time seems different. I should express my gratitude."

"You seem more interested in the duel than killing me."

Considering his role as the guardian of the labyrinth, refusing the trial of the gods is the correct answer.

It would significantly increase their chances of victory if everyone moved together to pressure Taesan.

But the orcs didn't do that.

All twenty orcs agreed to the trial.

"What good would killing you serve?"
Here is the translation of the text:

Ratran wore a determined expression.

"We are bound in this place by fate. Not only do we not see any glorious battles, but we also do not know when we will be liberated. Yet, you ask us to trample you underfoot with our own hands, even to show you a glorious death? To engage in such meaningless and worthless acts?"

Ratran bared his teeth.

"That cannot be."

Madness flickered across his face.

"It must not be so. You must show us glory."

The air crackled sharply.

"Warrior! Demonstrate your strength to me!"

[System Message: "The opponent is a challenging enemy. Your thirst for battle has been triggered."] ["You have activated disdain for the strong. You receive a bonus to judgment against enemies."] ["It is a 1:1 situation with the opponent. Your honorable duel has been activated."]

The system window appeared one after another. Ratran let out a roar.

"And bring death to me!"

[System: "Ratran has activated charge."] ["Ratran has activated rage."]
