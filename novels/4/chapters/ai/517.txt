**Episode 518**

**518. The Eighth Return, Earth (3)**

A calm voice resonated.

The atmosphere turned cold, and the guardians' faces distorted.

"Are we... weak?"

"We're not weak. We're not weak."

But that's about it.

"It doesn't seem like we can save the world. Did we really save the world?"

"How dare you! You're being reckless!"

One of the guardians couldn't hold back and burst out in anger, gripping their weapon tightly.

"What's wrong with how I feel?"

Amelia muttered, her face showing no signs of tension.

Arkashian struggled to suppress his emotions and twisted his lips.

"...You're strong."

"You're moderately strong. There are some monstrous people, but..."

"But you're like a frog in a well. You can't even save this world."

"That's... um..."

Amelia shrugged. There was nothing to say, as it was the truth.

"But that doesn't mean you're strong either."

"You."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In an instant, a fierce battle atmosphere erupted. The tension was so palpable that it seemed like a collision was imminent.

"'Education is necessary,' he said.

It was the moment when Arkrasian was about to draw his sword. Amelia watched the series of actions with a calm demeanor.

But the sword didn't come out. It was because Taesan, who had appeared out of nowhere, was watching them.

'Ah, Taesan.'

'Yes, Lord Gang Taesan.'

Taesan gazed at Arkrasian with an emotionless stare, causing Arkraesian to break out in a cold sweat.

Taesan stood quietly in place for a moment before leaving again.

Arkraesian barely managed to suppress his excitement.

'That was close.'

Their master was a transcendent being. If he attacked recklessly, he would incur the wrath of the transcendent being.

Arkraesian regained his composure.

'It doesn't matter what you say. No matter what, you guys couldn't even save this small world. And we've saved countless worlds.'

That was an undeniable truth. Amelia didn't say anything about it either.

She just looked suspicious.

'...I see.'"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Amelia nodded her head as if she had come to a realization. Akrasian smiled wryly, thinking that she was backing down from her stance.

"Do you really think your experiences and knowledge are superior to ours? That's not foolish at all. Think about it carefully."

There was a silence.

* * *

The conclusion was not difficult to reach.

The players from Earth decided to follow the Guardians' words.

It was only natural. The Guardians had succeeded in protecting numerous worlds from the grasp of destruction. In contrast, they had not.

The difference in pure achievement was clear, and they couldn't help but follow. The overall opinion was decided in favor of following the Guardians.

However, there was one concern.

People like Amelia and Lee Tae-yeon, who had stepped into the depths.

There was a high possibility that they would resist. Amelia, in particular, seemed to distrust the Guardians.

But contrary to expectations, there was no resistance.

"I don't care. Let's just go with it. It's fine."

"Take care of it yourself."

Lee Tae-yeon said calmly, and Amelia also looked uninterested.

"......Is it really okay? We're going to follow their words."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's not like we're going to fight anyway, right? Then I won't bother. Of course, I have no intention of following anyone."

"What did you say?"

"My master is Taesan."

Amelia said this without any shame.

She was Taesan's only apostle. She had dedicated her soul to him, and everything about her belonged to Taesan.

"There's only one being who can give me orders, and that's Taesan."

All other beings were nothing to her. They couldn't bind her.

"Not even Kim Hwi-yeon or Oliver. You guys are just temporary representatives appointed by Taesan, so I'll follow for now... but those others are different."

"Are you okay? If we clash, it could be a problem..."

"What's the issue?"

Her attitude was too nonchalant, as if asking what the problem was. Lee Tae-yeon's attitude wasn't much different either.

Her attitude was unsettling, but for now, a conclusion had been reached.

The guardians began to control and manage the players.

At first, it was a bit difficult to handle the enormous number of players, but with Kim Hwi-yeon's help, they were soon able to control them.

And they set off. To Greenland. Towards the crack in the sky just below.

This time, too, monsters appeared to block their path.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Whoa!] [Wow!] [Monster 48881 has appeared.] [Monster 97745 has appeared.] [Monster 32319 has appeared.] [Monster 47515 has appeared.]

Thousands of monsters are charging from the front. Akrasian grasped his weapon, as if he had been waiting for this moment.

"Behold. You foolish ones."

He spoke confidently, with an arrogant tone.

"This is our power."

The guardians charged forward.

They collided with thousands of monsters at an incredibly fast speed.

"Kwaaa!"

The monsters were torn apart and destroyed.

"Hahaha!"

One of the guardians burst out laughing and swung his axe. The monsters were torn apart and split open.

"Woow!"

One monster dodged the axe and grabbed the guardian's arm.

"Heh!"

The guardian roughly pushed his body forward, and the monster flew away.

"Thud."

The guardians didn't stop.

In an instant, the monsters were cleared out.

Before long, the guardians, who had handled all the monsters, raised their hands with proud faces.

"Woohoo!"

The victorious cheers echoed. Akrasian looked at the people of the earth with a proud face.

"This is our power!"

But there was no response.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Many astonished gazes were felt. Akrasian thought they were surprised by their own strength and said with a proud face:

"We saved the world. We naturally have this much power."

Akrasian, who was in a good mood, said as if to tell them not to be embarrassed:

"What's the big deal? These are just moderately strong monsters. If it weren't for the help of the Transcendents, we wouldn't have been able to handle them until now. We did a good job."

But again, there was no response.

The reason was simple. They were not astonished by the strength of the guardians.

"Why are they only B-rank?"

They had expected at least A-rank, hundreds or thousands, but they were only B-rank. At that level, even they could have solved the problem without any issues.

And what was even more strange was that the guardians who saved the world were proud of having defeated only that level of monsters.

People felt a sense of disconnection. It was as if they had heard that the greatest warrior had fought against the most fearsome enemy, a stray dog from the neighborhood.

Of course, there was no problem. In the end, the monsters could be defeated, and thanks to the guardians, they didn't have to fight.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"We can move forward without any harm, so it wasn't a loss. There was no need to dwell on the mystery."

However, Kim Hwi-yeon's worries only grew.

They knew nothing about the Guardians. They only knew that they had saved countless worlds, but they didn't know what kind of group they were, what their nature was, or anything about them.

Could they be trusted to make judgments?

As the representative of Taesan, who had given many orders, she couldn't help but worry.

In the end, she went to see Taesan.

"What do you think?"

She shared her concerns with Taesan.

And Taesan replied.

"You guys handle it."

"What?"

"I don't plan to get involved in the problems between the Guardians and you guys."

It was a struggle between mortals. It was a matter of life and death, and it was up to them to resolve it. It wasn't something that they couldn't handle.

"You guys rely too much on me. Of course, you have to rely on me. If I weren't here, you wouldn't be able to survive. But if you leave all the judgment to me, you'll become unable to do anything without me."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

“He…….”

Kim Hwi-yeon's words got stuck in his throat for a moment.

It wasn't a wrong thing to say. The guardians and their problems could be solved without Taesan's help. He was too used to asking for help.

"Now, you need to stand on your own."

Above all, Taesan's help was unnecessary for this problem.

"I have my own things to do too."

"What things?"

"I'll go ahead and check it out."

Taesan snapped his fingers, and Minerva appeared, cutting through the wind.

"Long time no see. It's been too long, hasn't it?"

"Sorry. But you didn't have to come out."

The enemies Taesan was fighting now were all ones that Minerva couldn't handle. There was no need to summon her.

"Minerva, create a path for them when they cross the sea."

"Got it!"

Taesan stood up. Kim Hwi-yeon hastily opened his mouth.

"Uh, Mr. Taesan?"

"If you don't know something, ask Diana. Please take care of it."

With that, Taesan disappeared. Kim Hwi-yeon stared blankly at the empty sky.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

* * *

Taesan had disappeared.

The fact spread quickly, and people were in an uproar. The realization that their absolute leader had vanished sent them into a panic.

Kim Hwi-yeon desperately tried to calm them down.

"Taesan left to take care of some business," he said. "He'll be waiting for us at our destination."

The people's confusion slowly subsided.

And when the guardians, who had learned of Taesan's departure, revealed their true nature, night fell. People began to prepare their lodgings and rest.

At that moment, the guardians seized the people.

"Halt," Akrasian said, standing before them.

"From today on, sleeping together without permission is forbidden. Keep a distance from each other and sleep separately."

"What?"

"Order and discipline are crumbling. I'll make sure you understand that."

"What's going on?"

People were bewildered.

So, it was a rule that made no sense. Akrasian scowled.

"Are you going to ignore the rules I've set?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With a fierce voice, Akrasian drew his sword. People grumbled and followed Akrasian's orders due to his oppressive attitude.

It was okay up until then. It was uncomfortable, but it wasn't a big problem.

However, as time went on, Akrasian's rules became more numerous.

"Don't talk when we're fighting monsters."

"We need people to serve us at our meals. Bring them."

"We need people to wash our bodies."

They were the ones who came to Earth to help, and they were treated with favor and given many concessions. But they were gradually crossing the line, trying to establish a master-servant relationship like nobles and slaves.

People's dissatisfaction began to accumulate one by one.

"What's going on?"

"Is this right, even if they came to help us?"

The dissatisfaction was eventually conveyed to Kim Hwi-yeon, who led them. In the end, Kim Hwi-yeon went to see Diana.

"Do you know about them, Diana?"

"I do."

Diana spoke about the information she knew. They were the ones who saved the world from the threat of Goshin.

And they had also come to save their own world."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But my world was not a world that was destroyed by the gods. It was their misunderstanding."

Diana wore a sorrowful smile.

"Still... they said they could save our world. At a time when everyone was in despair, hope was born that we could survive. People were overjoyed and gave them everything they wanted. Food and drink. Gold and treasure. Even women."

"Then, did your world not get destroyed, Princess?"

"No."

Diana spoke calmly.

"My world was destroyed."

"What?"

Kim Hwi-yeon's pupils widened. There was no reason for the world to be destroyed based on the story so far.

"The reason for its destruction is simple."

Beldegia spoke with a scornful face.

"When the world was on the brink of collapse, those who enjoyed everything to the fullest said they didn't need a world like this if there were no gods, and left."

"Ha, but they said they could save it..."

"They said it was possible. They didn't say they would do it, and they laughed at us. I didn't care whether the world was destroyed or not, so I don't have any complaints, but they're really ridiculous."

"......"

Kim Hwi-yeon closed his mouth. Diana spoke coldly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"They are clearly righteous people. It's not something anyone can do, moving to save the world. But they're not entirely good either."

"If they weren't righteous from the start, the princess would have destroyed them. It's close to that."

"That's... true."

Kim Hwi-yeon's head became complicated. Diana looked at her with a puzzled expression, tilting her head.

"What are you worried about?"

"Huh?"

"You don't need to worry about it."

"But they came to help us. So, at least, we should listen to what they have to say..."

"No."

Diana cut off Kim Hwi-yeon's words.

"You don't need to listen to the guardians' words."

"Huh?"

"Ah, I see. That's why you're like that."

Diana nodded as if she understood.

"It seems like Amelia or Lee Tae-yeon knew, but you didn't, Kim Hwi-yeon."

"What's...?"

"We believed their words and treated them with respect in the past because they were much stronger than us and had the ability to save the world. But that's not the case with you."

"......That's what you mean."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Why do you follow the words of those who are weaker than yourselves? They're nothing to you."

Diana asked with a pure and innocent question, as if she couldn't understand.

* * *

"It's so boring."

One of the guardians grumbled.

Although monsters appeared, they weren't threatening enough. There was nothing left but ruins, and it was all destroyed.

"Hmm..."

He clicked his tongue.

Many people from the earth passed by in front of him.

The guardian, who had glanced at them for a moment, moved.

"Over there. You. Come here."

He grabbed a woman. The woman pointed to herself with a puzzled expression.

"Me?"

"Yes."

He led the woman to a place with fewer people and said confidently.

"We're saving you. We're protecting this world from destruction."

"Uh... so?"

"Then shouldn't you give us a suitable reward?"

The guardian's face showed greed.

"Ah."

The woman nodded as if she knew what he wanted.

"No way."

"...... What?"

The man's face distorted.

"No way," she said.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He can't understand a word."

The guardian raised his fist. He was thinking of threatening him first and then forcing him to listen.

"How annoying."

But the woman, Lee Tae-yeon, didn't show any signs of tension on her face.

She just looked annoyed. Lee Tae-yeon's hand trembled.

Thud.

At the same time, the guardian's body was slammed against the wall.

* * *

And then, at that moment.

Taesan had arrived at the bottom of the crack.

"Hmm."

The massive crack that pierced the sky.

It was definitely getting bigger little by little.

And the enormous power that could be felt from beyond.

'The Gatekeeper.'

The one who guards the crack.

"This time, it's that one," Taesan muttered to himself.
