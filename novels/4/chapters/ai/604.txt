**Episode 605**

605. Extra Story, 1st Floor, Lee Tae-yeon (7)

"......You look strong."

Lee Tae-yeon swallowed her saliva.

The eerie red eyes were staring at her with a fierce gaze.

"But..."

Lee Tae-yeon didn't back down.

She gripped her sword and shield tightly and took a step forward instead.

She had become stronger. She had gained numerous experiences in the labyrinth, leveled up, and equipped herself.

She had become stronger. She could go further.

[You have activated Insight.]

Insight. A very valuable skill that allows you to identify your opponent's weakness.

Insight enveloped the Giant Rat.

"......Huh?"

And she was taken aback.

The weakness didn't appear. It was something that had never happened before.

Her mind quickly judged the reason.

At her level, she couldn't identify the weakness of the opponent in front of her.

No other possibilities came to mind.

"Just a moment..."

Then, there was no time to think. The Giant Rat let out a loud roar and charged at her.

"Kiiiiik!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's fast. Much faster than her. Itearyeon hastily raised her shield.

The giant rat's claw struck the shield.

Thud!

"Kyaaah!"

She let out a scream. Her body flew backward. She crashed into the wall and got up with a groan.

"What, what's going on?!"

There was no damage, but the shock was real.

There was no time to assess the situation. The giant rat had already arrived in front of her.

Itearyeon hastily raised her arm.

"Keeeeeek!"

Thud!

The claw struck the shield.

Her body was slammed to the ground. A powerful shockwave ran through her entire body. The giant rat swung its claws wildly.

"Heeek!"

[You activated combat evasion.]

Combat evasion. Automatically dodges the opponent's attack. Itearyeon's body moved to dodge the giant rat's attack, twisting her waist and jumping away.

But she couldn't dodge it.

One claw scratched her arm.

[You took 5 damage.]

"Ugh!"

Itearyeon's pupils trembled. She couldn't perfectly dodge the attack with combat evasion. In reality, it meant that the giant rat's attack was unavoidable."

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Eeek!"

I raise my shield.

Every time the giant rat's claws come down, the impact spreads, and cracks start to form on my shield. I desperately swing my sword. The sword pierces the giant rat's body.

[Giant Rat takes 4 damage.]

"Eeek!"

The giant rat becomes enraged. It fiercely bares its teeth and pounds on my shield. The cracks on my shield spread rapidly.

And finally...

Crash.

My shield shatters.

I'm left exposed to the giant rat, defenseless. As if it was waiting, the giant rat bites into my neck.

Gulp.

My neck is bitten, and the pain seeps into my brain.

[You take 8 damage.]

"Ow!"

I strike back with my sword. The giant rat takes damage, but it's not enough. The big rat grabs my body and shakes me violently. The wound grows rapidly, and blood spills all over the floor.

[You take 8 damage.] [You take 9 damage.] [You take 12 damage.]

My health is dwindling rapidly.

Fear fills my eyes.

I absolutely can't win.

If this continues, I'll die.

Perfect ending.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[Your path of death has been activated.] [Your path of life has been activated.]

A skill that announces death. And a skill that announces survival. Both are activated.

The announcements are all the same.

If I go like this, I'll die.

I have to escape.

"Eeek!"

Ityeon tries to turn her body around to escape. But the Giant Rat doesn't let her go. It grabs her shoulder and knocks her down.

"Kkkk!"

Her health drops to half in an instant. Fear fills her eyes, and it's all-consuming.

"Aaaaah!"

A tearing scream echoes out.

Ityeon hastily opens her inventory and grabs something to throw.

[She activated the Exclusion Potion.]

Kiiing!

A physical barrier forms. The Giant Rat's body is pushed back.

Ityeon takes advantage of the gap and hastily runs towards the door.

[You activated Escape.]

"Kiiing!"

The Giant Rat charges with a loud roar. Ityeon quickly takes out potions from her inventory.

[She activated the Exclusion Potion.] [She activated the Block Potion.] [She activated the Defense Potion.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

If I were to prepare numerous potions for emergencies, I would use them all up.

The giant rat that was chasing me was blocked by the numerous potions.

I barely grabbed the door handle.

"Kiik!"

"Kwaaaang!"

The door closed, and a loud noise spread.

I survived.

I let out a sigh of relief and sat down on the floor.

* * *

Thud, thud.

I arrived at the store in a daze.

The store owner looked at me with a mixture of surprise and concern.

"You barely made it alive."

"……."

I collapsed onto the floor again.

I really came close to dying.

"Ha, haha……."

To be honest, I was full of confidence until I entered the boss room.

I had become stronger than when I first entered the labyrinth.

I had fought many battles and raised my skill proficiency and stats accordingly.

At first, I was terrified of the big rat, but now I could defeat it easily with one hand, even without a shield.

As a result, I gained confidence.

Not the kind of confidence that comes from being reckless, but the kind that comes from following the right path, the path that others acknowledge.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

And her confidence was shattered to pieces in the battle against the Giant Rat.

"I'm scared."

It wasn't just about losing. The loss itself wasn't that significant. What mattered was surviving.

But through that process, she clearly realized what kind of person she was.

"I'm a coward."

This was a battlefield where lives were at stake.

The threats to her life were countless.

What mattered was what she gained from that place.

Did she find a way to survive those threats? How did she identify and exploit the enemy's weaknesses?

That would depend on what kind of adventurer she was.

But all she could think of was avoiding battle.

She couldn't even conceive of counterattacking the Giant Rat's attack, exploiting its weaknesses, and fighting for her life. That was the limit of her humanity.

Unless she died and was reborn, she couldn't clear the labyrinth using conventional methods.

"Then..."

Lee Tae-yeon clenched her fist.

* * *

She realized that she had been arrogant.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

She had to clear the labyrinth in her own way.

"I can't win."

Lee Tae-yeon acknowledged it calmly.

The Giant Rat was impossible to defeat.

Even if she blocked it with a shield, she would be pushed back by its strength, and eventually, she would have to allow an opening. It was also difficult to aim for an opening because the battle avoidance skill didn't work properly.

Above all, her attack power was too low. She didn't know how much health the Giant Rat had, but it was probably higher than the Big Rat's. She would die before that.

In other words, she had to avoid the battle.

Then, how could she avoid the battle and achieve victory?

"Find the weakness..."

But the opponent was too strong. It was impossible to even gauge its strength.

It was also terrifying to confront it directly.

She thought.

She thought and thought, and her mind started racing wildly.

Thousands of possibilities moved around in her head.

It was a desperate struggle to survive and clear the labyrinth.

[The proficiency of the Path of Life increased by 2%.]

"...Giant Rat."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Its appearance was identical to that of a Big Rat. Even its basic combat style seemed similar, making it seem like a nearly identical species.

Then, would its weaknesses be the same as well?

She got up from her seat and headed out to the store. Before she knew it, a respawned Big Rat was waiting for her.

"Let's start with the sword first."

She muttered to herself as she drew her sword.

First, the sword.

There didn't seem to be any particularly noticeable weaknesses. No matter where she struck, the damage was similar. The reproductive organs took a bit more damage, but it wasn't significantly meaningful, and it was impossible to aim for them.

Next, she tried using a bow.

There was something called a paralyzing arrow. It seemed possible, but it required an exorbitant amount of money.

It seemed like she would need at least 100 arrows to kill a Giant Rat, but the efficiency was too poor.

She searched and searched for dozens of methods.

And finally.

She found the answer.

* * *

"Here we go again."

She muttered to herself. A Giant Rat was right in front of her.

With a sneer, as if mocking Lee Tae-yeon, she slowly approached with a creepy laugh.

Lee Tae-yeon opened her inventory.

And dozens of oil bottles poured out.

Ka-ching!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With a crashing sound, the oil spreads widely on the floor, enough to soak up to Tae-yeon's ankles.

And then Tae-yeon strikes a match to ignite the fire.

"Well, it's farewell."

Tae-yeon quickly throws his body. The match touches the oil.

A fierce flame erupts through the closing door.

"Kiiiiik!"

The giant rat's scream echoes.

[Giant Rat takes 1 damage.] [Giant Rat takes 2 damage.] [Giant Rat takes 1 damage.]

...

...

[Burn damage judgment successful!]

"How long will it take?"

Tae-yeon muttered to himself, still sitting by the door.

Unlike other installations, the giant rat's body had a lot of fat, which meant it would burn well in the fire.

And the floor of the labyrinth was made of bricks, but all the gaps were blocked. It meant that the liquid wouldn't flow underneath.

The door also had no gaps, making it possible to create a perfect sealed room.

Having understood this, Tae-yeon came up with an answer."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I buy oil to the extent that it fills the boss room. Although I spent a lot of gold, it was at least more efficient than buying arrows.

Next is simple.

I close the door and wait. Until the Giant Rat dies. The boss can't leave the room. It was as easy as eating cake.

Time passes.

"Kiiiiik!"

[The Giant Rat got angry and entered a Berserker state.]

"Berserker? Is this the 2nd phase? This is ridiculous."

A head-on confrontation was still unlikely to win. She waited blankly.

And finally.

The crying sounds gradually decreased and stopped."

**Story**

After a long time had passed...

"Ugh."

Lee Tae-yeon got up from her seat.

As she opened the door, a storm of flames rushed towards her. She quickly dodged and calmed down, looking around the room to see that everything was on fire.

The Giant Rat had been completely incinerated and turned into a charred black.

"Heh heh."

I cleared it.

Lee Tae-yeon went down the stairs, where the shop owner was waiting for her.

"......You cleared it."

"How did you do it?"

"I don't know."

The shop owner shook his head.

"You will eventually hit a wall."

The labyrinth is cruel, but at the same time, it is kind. It shows a little mercy to children who are struggling. It's possible to clear the labyrinth in the same way as Lee Tae-yeon.

But that's only the beginning of the labyrinth's story.

As you go deeper, eventually, the shortcuts will be blocked. The controllers of the labyrinth, the transcenders, and the administrators of the labyrinth, Balbam, have no weaknesses. You will eventually hit a wall.

And that will be Lee Tae-yeon's grave.

"I don't know."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Tae-yeon herself didn't know. How far she could go with this method. Where she would stumble.

And where she would make her grave, for that matter.

"But not now."

She would move forward.

She would survive.

Tae-yeon opened the door on the 2nd floor."
