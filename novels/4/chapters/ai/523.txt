Chapter 524

524. The Eighth Return, Earth (9)

[You have activated Chaos Call.] [Your enemy's divine punishment has been activated.] [Your enormous will, which goes against your opponent, has been activated.]

.

.

.

Numerous skills are activated. Your physical and mental strength reach an even higher level.

"Huu."

Taesan quietly gazed at his opponent.

The gatekeeper also looked back at Taesan.

There was no emotion in their gaze. Only a mechanical will, fulfilling their assigned role, was visible.

Ooong.

The gatekeeper raised their hand.

A black color flowed out of the gatekeeper's entire body like a waterfall. The black color, which slowly gathered in the sky, eventually formed hundreds of square shapes.

The gatekeeper clenched their fist.

The black shapes, made of darkness, began to compress.

Ggggggguuuu.

Due to the distorted power of compression, the space-time axis became distorted. Before long, the hundreds of shapes transformed into small ball-like forms.

The gatekeeper lowered their arm.

Hundreds of balls flew towards Taesan.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan infused his feet with strength. He tensed his entire body and moved.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

He launched himself into the air.

Taesan instantly arrived at the opposite side of Greenland. And the beads precisely followed him.

Chwe-ae-ae-ak!

The fastest bead among them flew towards Taesan.

Taesan drew his sword and prepared for battle.

Ka-aa-ang!

The bead collided with Taesan's sword.

And the sensation Taesan felt was heavy.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

Taesan's body was pushed back slightly. And in that moment, hundreds of beads flew towards his entire body.

It was impossible to block or dodge.

Quickly judging the situation, Taesan gathered his mana.

[You activated Blink.]

Taesan's body moved, and the beads flew towards him without any delay.

Taesan infused his sword with strength.

[You activated Acceleration.] [You activated Strong Strike.]

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

He swung his sword, knocking the beads away and dodging.

But it was impossible.

Ka-aa-aa-ang!

"It's too heavy."

Each bead was heavy. Even if Taesan tried his best to knock them away, it was extremely difficult.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Kagaga!"

There was no choice but to create an opening, and the orb scraped off Taesan's entire body in an instant.

His self-defense was consumed in an instant. Taesan strongly pulled the boundary line, and it burst forth. A storm-like power exploded, and the orbs flew away simultaneously.

Taesan roughly stretched out his hand.

He caught one of the flying orbs and struck it down with his sword.

"Kagaga!"

The boundary line was a distorted power that surpassed all the strengths of the world.

But the orb did not break.

Taesan made the boundary line in his sword even stronger and sharper. Only then did the sword slowly begin to pierce the orb.

Taesan put strength into his hand.

"Crunch."

The orb shattered, and the power inside it exploded and scattered.

"It's ridiculously tough."

Taesan clicked his tongue. The compressed black color in that one orb had lightly surpassed Taesan's limits. It was compressed to the extent that it could withstand even the boundary line.

Hundreds of orbs.

Each one was tougher and more powerful than a mediocre swordsman. Even with acceleration, Taesan was pushed back by their power.

$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Things more powerful than apostles, hundreds of them, are being manipulated at once by the high priest.

The mountain focuses its spirit and moves its body again.

* * *

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung!

The orb is being pressed down. Just that alone is enough to destroy the earth. If the magician hadn't unfolded the barrier, the planet earth would have ceased to exist.

It can't be blocked with just a sword.

Then, let's do it with quantity and size as well.

[You have activated magic overlap.] [You have activated Great Collapse [Chaos].]

You overlap the Great Collapse of injustice. High-level magic. And on top of that, you mix in the boundary line, one of his powerful cards.

[You have activated magic release.]

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung!

The overlapping gray Great Collapse flies away.

The gatekeeper waves his hand. The orbs gather together and charge towards the Great Collapse like a spear.

Ka-ga-ga-ga-kak!

A massive collision occurs. The magician's unfolded barrier trembles for a moment.

"Hmm."

The magician snaps his fingers. The barrier that surrounds the world becomes even more solid.

"I should get a bit more serious too."

The magician swings his arms widely. The barrier becomes even more solid.

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The giant vortex and the orb collide, trying to devour each other.

Tzzzzt!

And the one that breaks is the giant vortex.

The mountain's eyes tremble.

The condensed orb resonates with itself, amplifying its power. The giant vortex can no longer withstand it and explodes.

Kuuuuuuuuuuuuung!

A massive explosion of power occurs.

The orbs scatter in all directions. But soon, they gather again and charge towards the mountain.

Kagagagak!

The mountain quickly creates distance and activates its skill.

[You have activated the Call of Destruction.]

A massive power that destroys the world rushes towards the orb.

And the orb, without any resistance, shatters the Call of Destruction and breaks free.

The mountain breaks through the boundary and pushes the orb away, raising its finger.

[You have activated Baal's Designated Space Collapse.]

Baal's direct dark magic, which rivals high-level magic. The guardian's body begins to distort under the influence of the dark magic.

But soon, it returns to its original form. Without taking any significant damage, it lightly waves its hand and manipulates the orb.

The mountain clicks its tongue.

"Is this what they call a 'high priest'?"
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Until now, the only ones who could block the boundary line were the Transcendents. Even the physical body of the World Destroyer's fragment was easily pierced by the boundary line.

However, the opponent in front of me was different. The orb they controlled not only resisted the boundary line but also managed to pierce through it.

The mage responded by using the boundary line to fill in the newly collapsed area, whereas the swordmaster simply compressed the black color to an extreme degree, making it impossible for the boundary line to pierce through.

It's strong. Even stronger than the current Taesan.

The orb is shattered. Taesan stretches out his hand into the air.

[You have activated the World's Sword [Chaos].]

A massive, ash-colored sword appears in Taesan's hand. He swings it wildly, and hundreds of orbs and swords clash.

No matter how densely the black color is compressed, the boundary line is a power that surpasses it. A few orbs are unable to withstand the pressure and shatter.

However, the World's Sword was no exception. Cracks begin to form at the tip of the sword, and soon the entire sword is affected.

Zzzt!

The World's Sword is broken.

Taesan still holds his hand up.

[You have activated the Multicolored Rainbow-Colored Dash.]

Rainbow-colored lights manifest in the world. Hundreds, thousands of rays collide with the black orbs.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Ka-ga-ga-gak!"

The orb slowly moves forward.

Breaking through the foolish, ignorant obstacles in its way, it approaches the Taesan.

This won't do. Taesan quickly judges the situation and cancels the activation, instead using teleportation.

[You have used teleportation.]

You move to a location just below the high, cracked sky.

The orb quickly follows, but you manage to gain a small amount of time. You quickly analyze your opponent's characteristics.

"It doesn't move."

The orb handler seems to specialize in controlling the orb, as they don't move at all during the battle, except to move their hands. They remain still in their place.

In the end, the only thing you need to be wary of is the orb.

However, the orb is sturdy and powerful. It's not something that can be broken with Taesan's power, but it would still require a significant amount of energy to do so.

Even if you break a few, there are still hundreds of orbs left.

It's not hard to imagine what would have happened if the real deal had come down in an incomplete state like this.

"The exchange rate is too bad."

If you continue to exchange blows, you will lose.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The opponent is clearly stronger than Taesan. If we continue like this, our skills will be consumed one by one, and we'll eventually lose.

This won't do.

We can't win with honest methods.

So, we'll consume a lot and take a risk, aiming for one big hit.

And Taesan had a powerful single hit that was enough to take him down.

Taesan made his decision.

[You activated your landing skill.] [You activated your acceleration skill.] [You activated your skill acceleration.]

Your body rapidly descends, falling towards the ground in an instant. You're heading towards the gatekeeper. The orb is rushing towards Taesan as if it had been waiting.

Taesan raised his hand.

[You activated Baal's shattered fragment.]

The shattered fragment appears before Taesan's eyes. And there, the magician's magic is activated.

[You activated a colorful, rainbow-colored dash.]

The rainbow color touches Baal's fragment.

Zzzt!

And it amplifies. The rainbow color turns completely black, and thousands of tendrils rush forth.

Kkkkkkkuuuu!

The orb collides with it. This time, it doesn't get pushed back easily. The orbs clash fiercely, creating a path towards the gatekeeper.

The gatekeeper waves his hand.

Kiiiiing!"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The beads spin at an incredible speed, to the point where they can't be seen with the naked eye, and then accelerate again.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

The dark, jet-black aura starts to surge again. Even if Baal, who has been around since the beginning, and the labyrinth's magician combine their powers, it's still impossible.

But this is enough.

Taesan's goal is to create a path for the gatekeeper. He unleashes everything he has.

[You have activated the collapse of all things.] [You have activated the Great Destruction [Chaos].]

The colorful, rainbow-colored aura continues to activate, piercing through and creating a path.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

But it starts to get pierced little by little.

A few beads aim for the gap in the dark aura and fly towards Taesan. Taesan swings his sword.

Ka-aa-ang!

He knocks the beads away and pushes them back.

It's not possible to block everything. There's also an unavoidable trajectory that must be dodged.

Taesan doesn't dodge. Instead, he pushes his body forward even more.

[Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.]

Thanks to the skill granted by the magician, even the attacks of the divine punishment are nullified without issue.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Your second attack nullification has been activated.]

You cannot approach Goshin without taking any damage. There was a significant gap between you and Taesan.

[Your third attack nullification has been activated.]

Kagagagak!

And Taesan finally reached the gatekeeper's proximity.

And at that moment, the black thread ended. The fragment of Baal also disappeared.

Mana and magic were exhausted, revealing the ground.

Taesan was left standing naked in front of the gatekeeper.

But Taesan didn't stop. Instead, he advanced even further.

Hundreds of orbs rushed towards Taesan. It was impossible to dodge or block them.

At that moment, Taesan's body moved.

[The last chance has been activated.]

Kagagagak!

His physical body moved in an impossible direction, distorting itself.

The last chance. He must defend against the deadly attack that would lead to his death.

Taesan took a step forward.

The gatekeeper was right in front of him.

He had exhausted everything to get this far. He had to gain something here. Taesan grasped his sword.

And the gatekeeper lightly waved his hand.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The beads gathered in front of the gatekeeper and created a massive wall.

The absolute defense of all the gathered beads.

It couldn't be pierced even with the boundary line.

And if it were just a collection like that, it would be impossible to multiply.

The 44 billion physical strength was certainly impressive, but its limit was clear. It wasn't enough to pierce the gatekeeper's full power.

So, the solution was simple.

The current attack power of Taesan is 33,223, and the defense power is 15,192.

[You activated the conversion.]

The defense power is converted to an attack power value. With the effect of the Ability Sword, an additional 20% is added.

An attack power value of 51,451 is achieved.

[You activated the addition.]

102,902.

[You activated the Soul Blade.]

Soul Blade.

Its effect triples the damage.

308,706.

[You activated the Critical Hit.]

And Critical Hit.

The target of Critical Hit is not limited to just living things. It designates the critical point of the bead in front.

The effect of Critical Hit doubles the damage.

[You activated the Strong Strike.] [You activated the Acceleration.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"He activates all his attack power-up skills and overlaps them. The sword begins to contain physical strength.

Kkkkkk.

With just that, the world distorts.

The gatekeeper suddenly raises his hand. Something is off. I need to take care of that before it moves.

But it's too late.

Taesan has drawn his sword.

"If I block this, I'll die obediently."

[You have activated Multiply.] [You have activated Copy.]"
