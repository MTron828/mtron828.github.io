Episode 10

10. 1st Floor (5)

[Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: Hey. Hyung. Is this really the correct method?] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: High risk, high return. Don't you know? If the gap gets too big, you won't get anything, so now is the best timing, right?] [Kang Junhyuk [Alone]: No. It's not that kind of problem. Ah, really... I'm sorry, Hyung. I really can't do this.] [Kang Taesan [Alone]: Do as you wish. I'm not the one who will suffer.] [Lee Taejoon [Alone]: Junhyuk, you're not the odd one out. No one but that person has gotten anything.]

Skills involve combinations.

When specific skills meet certain situations, new skills are created.

Taesan, who stood up from his seat, takes a deep breath.

[You activated apnea.]

Having activated the skill, Taesan begins to swing his rusty sword.

Being able to endure twice as much is a story of staying still. The story changes if you take action. Oxygen demands from his entire body cause his face to turn red in an instant.

But Taesan doesn't stop swinging his sword.
He executes sword strikes numbering in the tens.

Eventually, as his sword strikes reach one hundred.

[You executed countless attacks in one breath. Acquired special activation skill [Apnea Attack].] [You have acquired more than ten skills and reached a level where you can confidently say you've acquired skills.] [Acquired title [Skill Player].]

"Hoo!"

Taesan exhales roughly.

Attacks have a tempo. Just as he read and caught the movement of the big rat, humans also foresee before moving.

The Apnea Attack was a skill that allowed him to freely change that tempo.

During attacks, not breathing for 10 seconds eliminates restrictions, creating enough variables.

It was a skill he enjoyed using until he emerged from the labyrinth.

"Title screen."

[Title: Skill Player] [You have acquired 10 skills. All skills receive an additional bonus to proficiency.]

A good title that can be obtained by default. It wasn't bad.

"Status screen."
[Kang Taesan] [Level: 3] [Health: 120/120] [Mana: 12/12] [Strength: 10] [Intelligence: 12] [Agility: 21] [Attack +1] [Defense +7] [The target is exhausted.]

Certainly fast. When passing through the first floor, Itaeyeon mentioned that his agility had become 13. It was an overwhelming speed.

Looking solely at agility, reaching the 5th floor even in hard mode is a stat achievable. Taesan, who was enjoying looking at the status screen, stroked his chin.

"Should I make one?"

Right now, he has acquired many skills. Even if a hard player reaches the 3rd floor, he would be weaker than him on the 1st floor. Considering how exponentially stronger one becomes with each lower floor, it was an incredibly fast speed.

But he lacks a main skill.

Skills that exceed the value of ten skills. Skills that can close the gap in stats. People called such skills main skills.

To give a simple example, addition that just adds current attack power.

Multiplication that squares current attack power.

Complete reconnaissance that comprehends all hidden factors and situations around.

Nullification attack that eliminates the result of the attack itself.

Forced duel that prevents anyone but the target from interfering.
Here's the translation of the text:

---

It's the makeshift time stop that stops the time around you, which everyone has been able to place their tongues on.

That's everyone's main skill. A skill that can exert overwhelming power over other players of the same level with just one. He had more than dozens of main skills.

Taesan was thinking of creating one of them.

He drank from the spring. All fatigue was relieved, and he went outside.

* * *

Most main skills have quite stringent acquisition conditions, perhaps due to their power.

For instance, Complete Reconnaissance is barely achievable only after Insight has evolved two or three times.

Considering that ordinary players can't even achieve a single skill evolution, it was practically an impossible skill.

However, there was one skill that could be created even on the 1st floor. Ironically, it was a skill that would be difficult to obtain if not now.

Taesan stood quietly in the passage and waited.

Before long, a snickering sound rang out.

[Big Rat has appeared.]

The Big Rat eyed Taesan. Taesan took a stance and raised his shield. Instinctively, the Big Rat dashed towards Taesan's exposed ankle.

[You receive 4 damage.]

"Snick, Squeak!"

Here's the translation of the text:

The Big Rat quickly scurries away. Taesan remained unmoving.

After a moment of surveying, the Big Rat charges again. Taesan calmly focused his gaze.

He saw it all. Agility not only enhances reflexes and speed but also cultivates overall cognitive abilities. With an agility of 21, Taesan could have taken the shot as soon as the Big Rat entered.

But he doesn't move.

[You receive 3 damage.]

"Squeak."

Thinking Taesan didn't react, the Big Rat happily squealed. Now, instead of fleeing, it circles under Taesan's feet and nibbles.

The damage window steadily rises.

Like clothes getting wet in a drizzle, Taesan's health slowly decreases.

But he doesn't move.

Taesan opens the status window to check his health.

[Health 23/120]

'I'll need to take a few more hits.'

He doesn't move. The Big Rat continues its assault.

[You receive 4 damage.]

Remaining health 19.

[You receive 3 damage.]

16.

[You receive 4 damage.]

12.

[You receive 3 damage.] [You are in critical condition.]

9.

[You receive 4 damage.] [You receive 4 damage.] [You are in critical condition.] [Death Mastery increased by 3%.] [Composure Mastery increased by 2%.]

It wasn't until his health dropped to a level where one more hit would mean death that Taesan finally moved. He swung down his shield.

*Clang!*

"Squeak, squeak!"

The Big Rat, which had been eagerly gnawing, hastily retreated. Taesan stood firm like a solid fortress.

"Squeak!"

The Big Rat didn't like the idea of its dying prey resisting. It immediately lunged forward again, aiming for any opening. It dug its teeth into Taesan's ankle from under the shield.

*Clang!*

"Squeak!"

However, the shield moved, blocking the Big Rat's attack. Startled, the Big Rat backed off.

[You are in critical condition.] [Death Mastery increased by 2%.] [Composure Mastery increased by 2%.] [You have perfectly blocked the opponent's attack. Acquired special passive skill [Block].]

Block. A great skill that completely nullifies damage below a certain threshold.

But it's not the skill he's hoping for right now. Taesan cleared his spear and once again aimed at the Big Rat.

"Squeak!"

The Big Rat hesitated and then charged again, aiming for a gap in the shield.

*Clang!*

Here's the translation of the text into English:

---

But the shield moved and blocked the Big Rat. The Big Rat had no choice but to retreat again.

[You are in critical condition.] [Death Mastery increased by 1%.] [Composure Mastery increased by 2%.]

There was a skill called Endurance.

It nullified fatal damage once and completely negated all damage for a certain period of time.

Nullification was a very powerful effect.

It allowed ignoring an unavoidable strike from the opponent and could counterattack, and it could break through traps that could not be passed even at the risk of life.

For Taesan, who had experienced much fortune, it was skillful enough to be called a main skill.

Thunk!

[You are in critical condition.] [Death Mastery increased by 2%.] [Composure Mastery increased by 2%.]

However, apart from Taesan, there was no one else who had acquired it. Those curious about him asked Taesan after clearing the labyrinth. They asked how he learned Endurance.

Taesan replied without difficulty.

[You are in critical condition.] [Death Mastery increased by 2%.] [Composure Mastery increased by 1%.]

Here is the English translation of the text:

---

Skills have predetermined methods of acquisition. The easiest way is to receive them from someone else. Basic skills like Herb Identification were obtained this way.

However, skills that are transferable are only basic skills. Skills useful for navigating dungeons cannot be acquired this way.

The second method is achievement. Achieving what others have not done grants skills that correspond to the achievement.

[You are in critical condition.] [Death Mastery increased by 2%.] [Composure Mastery increased by 2%.]

Lastly, it's about implementing the effects of skills in a similar manner.

In a broad sense, swordsmanship and shield techniques were similar concepts.

Swordsmanship was obtained by wielding a sword, and shield techniques were obtained by handling a shield.

Suppressing breath granted Breath Holding, and repeatedly swinging a sword before exhaling granted Breathless Attack.

Then, how should one acquire Endurance, which nullifies attacks leading to death?

It's simple.

[You are in critical condition.] [Death Mastery increased by 2%.] [Composure Mastery increased by 2%.]

Just block attacks leading to death consecutively.

[You blocked attacks that could have killed you several times. You have acquired the special passive skill [Endurance].]

You acquired a skill. Taesan immediately charged at Big Rat. Despite Big Rat's attempt to flee in terror, the shield crushed the small figure.

*Click!*

[You have vanquished Big Rat.] [Your Agility has permanently increased by 1 due to Awakening.] [You gained a small amount of experience.] [. . .]

You clear away the dripping spear and open the skill window.

[Special Passive Skill: Endurance] [Proficiency: 1%] [Nullifies attacks leading to death. Ignores all damage for 1 second afterward.]

Taesan smiled.

Itaeyeon heard about obtaining Endurance and called him insane. Junggeun also looked at him with concern.

But Taesan felt differently. He couldn't understand those who refused to obtain a skill that could save their lives out of fear.

If you make a mistake, you may die as a result, but compared to the rewards, isn't it a very light gamble? The labyrinth is a place where you can't gain anything without risking your life.

Taesan simply followed that rule.

Taesan returned to the spring to recover his health and began the verification process.

[Special Passive Skill: Block] [Proficiency: 1%] [Blocks damage below a certain threshold. Currently can only block damage below 1.]

Depending on proficiency, Block was a useful skill that could handle dot damage without issue.

The main problem was how difficult it was to increase proficiency. Because it required a lot of time and patience, there were no specialists who dealt with it.

Taesan also had no immediate plans to increase proficiency. He put it off for later.

The proficiency of Death's Line and Coldness was quite significant.

[Special Passive Skill: Coldness] [Proficiency: 31%] [A steady mind. Does not panic unless an existence beyond cognition appears. Gains appropriate adjustments in judgment.] [Special Passive Skill: Death's Line] [Proficiency: 68%] [Can detect moments leading to death. Activates in most crises. Also activates during significant damage.]

Both texts had changed. Especially Death's Line was attractive. It meant he could foresee most traps in advance.

"Are there any more skills to acquire?"

There seemed to be a few, but he couldn't remember. Recalling all two hundred skills at once was difficult. Taesan searched his memory.

"There was a Sage!"

A loud voice rang out then. Taesan reflexively drew his shield.

"Good reflexes!"

The elderly man in golden armor looked at him with laughter.

Monsters cannot enter the Fountain of Life.

That's an NPC.

[You have encountered a Seeker of Gods.]

"Hello."

He greeted without lowering his guard. Itaeyeon had said most NPCs in Alon Mode were lunatics. Recalling if she had ever mentioned the elderly knight in golden armor, he continued speaking.

The knight stroked his white beard and asked,

"Are you an adventurer?"

"An adventurer?"

"A term referring to those striving to conquer the Labyrinth. Is that correct?"

"Yes."

They conversed while feeling out memories.

[When I was resting at the Fountain of Life on the first floor, an old knight came. Was he a holy knight serving a god?]

And did she say Moore?

It came to mind. Taesan quickly raised his shield. The holy knight approached confidently. Despite the considerable distance between them and Taesan, he arrived at arm's length in just one step.

The holy knight grinned and raised his fist.

"Let's see you block this."

[Ainzhar activated a non-lethal attack.] [Ainzhar's attack.]

His fist struck Taesan.
