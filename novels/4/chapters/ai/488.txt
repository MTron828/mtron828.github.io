**Chapter 489**

489. 91st Floor. Uroboros (10)

A new power fills the inside of Taesan.

Taesan quietly tames the power. Although he struggled as if he didn't want it to be his, the surge in his spiritual energy unshakably seized the authority of the worthless ones.

"Phew."

Taesan took a breath. At the same time, the high level of spiritual energy he had reached plummeted. As the absolute resistance effect ended, the burden crushed Taesan.

"Hmm."

His entire body trembled. His mind momentarily reached its limit, and his body collapsed.

Taesan quickly unfolded his divine power. His broken body and mind began to recover rapidly, illuminated by a golden light.

"That was close."

If he had reacted even a little slower, it would have been extremely dangerous. Despite having his own essence, the burden was unbearable. He would need to take a few days off and rest.

"It's not a power to be used lightly."

But he had won.

Essential smiled and landed beside Taesan.

"I've really erased it from this world."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The figure of the worthless being who had been tormenting Uroboros ceaselessly was nowhere to be seen. It had been completely erased from this universe, leaving not a single speck behind.

The death of Gosin. Although it was only a small part, the fact remained unchanged. Even the Essentials, who had lived for a long time, had never seen anything like it before.

The Essential smiled with a satisfied expression and muttered to himself.

"I thought I could win, but I didn't think it would be this easy."

"I didn't know either."

The opponent was just a small fragment of the worthless being, barely a fraction of its whole. The Essential had been strongly suppressing it, and Taesan couldn't even focus his full power.

He thought that would be enough to win.

But it was Gosin, after all. He thought it would be a tough fight, but he ended up winning more easily than expected.

And he knew the reason why.

'Absolute Resistance.'

It raised the opponent's level to match his own.

Taesan was able to temporarily become an equal to the worthless being.

The duration of the effect was extremely short, as it was originally meant to be used as a last resort.

However, the duration had increased significantly, and the burden had decreased substantially."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But the power of the Essential, which is its own essence, was not everything.

'There's something inside me.'

Amelia, who had seen Half-ran's true form, couldn't understand it.

Taesan finally saw it too.

"You're worried, aren't you?"

The Essential chuckled.

"Well, you can be happy for now. You're the winner. The loser is Gosin."

"......I understand."

As the Essential said, Taesan could now enjoy the joy of victory. He lifted his head.

Ku-gu-gu-gung!

The world, the space, was distorting.

The foreign substance was removed, and Uroboros, who was freed, moved awkwardly.

"Well, from here on, it's the real deal."

The Essential revealed its power with an ambiguous expression. Its essence formed a domain.

As time and space stabilized, Uroboros's true body appeared in Taesan's sight.

"......It's smaller."

It was much smaller than Taesan had thought. It was similar in size to a common snake found on Earth.

Uroboros, with its dark scales, wriggled.

It seemed to have regained its composure, turned its head towards its surroundings, and looked at Taesan and the Essential.

"Hmm."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Even when facing a worthless opponent, the essential's face, which never lost its smile, showed signs of tension for the first time.

Uroboros is the snake of cycles.

It is one of the largest concepts that make up the world. If they were to judge and oppose it as an other, even the essential would have to risk its life.

Uroboros slowly approached them. There was no hostility in its movement. The essential, who had been on guard, was taken aback for a moment.

"Huh?"

Uroboros stopped in front of Taesan.

Its small eyes gazed quietly at Taesan.

With an attitude as if it was seeking something, Taesan extended his hand.

The snake quietly slithered past Taesan's hand, leaving something behind. A strange sensation lingered on Taesan's hand.

Uroboros rose into the air again, quietly curling up its body. The influence of Uroboros, which had engulfed the world, began to shrink.

Kugugugugugu!

The distorted time of the broken world began to return to its original form.

Taesan saw it.

The broken planet and universe. All the beings within, returning to their original form after an uncountable amount of time.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The entire world was returning to a state before it was eaten by Uroboros. Essential let out a sigh of amazement.

"Amazing."

The time that was returning to the past had finally come to an end. The power of Uroboros, which had devoured the universe, had disappeared.

The small snake in front of them suddenly distorted and then hid its appearance.

"I'll return everything and go. It can't speak, but it seems to have some level of intelligence."

"It seems that way."

Taesan looked at his hand.

Inside, there was a single scale of Uroboros's dark, lustrous armor.

[You have obtained Uroboros's scale.]

"Is this a reward for removing the foreign substance? In the end, it was you who eliminated the worthless ones, but even though you protected me for a long time, I got nothing."

Essential grumbled, but his expression was more joyful than dissatisfied.

"I'm back."

Essential gazed at the universe with a relieved face.

The transcendent being, who had been trapped inside Uroboros for an eternity, had finally returned to the universe.

"Once again, I express my gratitude. Taesan. Thanks to you, I was able to return to this place."

"No, I also gained a lot."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Just having my own essence was worth struggling for. And I gained the power of the divine and the scales of Uroboros. This alone was enough as a quest reward.

Essential chuckled.

"That's fortunate, but there's still something I need to give you."

A gaze at his own essence.

Essential said it was possible. But Essential's face was ambiguous.

"For that, I need my altar and shrine... but honestly, I don't know. Whether that place is being managed, and whether the mortals who serve me are still there. The apostles have all disappeared, too."

Essential had been trapped inside Uroboros for too long. Even an immortal was pushed to the limit, so it was likely that Essential had almost forgotten about the outside world.

"There are many things to take care of first. It'll take some time."

"I understand."

Taesan nodded his head simply. He didn't think it would be done immediately. The amount of time it would take was within his expected range.

"I'm sorry to say this is the reward, but take this."

Essential tapped Taesan's forehead.

A very small, fragment-like thing settled inside Taesan.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[You have obtained [yourself].]

"What is this?"

He couldn't say it was an authority. From the depths of the great mountain, he didn't feel anything.

"That's something you build yourself. It's a vessel that holds your existence. Right now, it doesn't have any meaning, but... later on, it will be useful."

Essential gazed at the great mountain with a mysterious smile.

The great mountain scowled.

"What do you see in me?"

The great mountain also sensed it. Although he himself didn't realize it, Essential saw something in him.

Essential quietly smiled.

"I'll put that off for later enjoyment. It's not something to talk about with your current self."

"……."

"Don't think badly of it. It's also for your sake."

He chuckled and took a step back. The space distorted, and the world beyond began to appear.

"I said it was a labyrinth. I'll have to investigate that too. See you later, mixed-up guy! I'll come find you again!"

With those final words, Essential leaped beyond the space.

The vast universe was left with the great mountain standing alone.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan, who had been gazing at that figure, also opened up the space. He inserted his body into the expanded space.

"Good job."

The wizard's voice quietly resonated.

* * *

[Quest Clear.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [Your level has risen.] [You have obtained the Returning Flute.] [You have obtained ???.]

The system window announcing the rewards blocked his view. Through it, the wizard's astonished face was visible.

"I didn't expect you to solve it this perfectly."

Taesan had exceeded the wizard's expectations. The universe-devouring Uroboros no longer existed. Uroboros had returned to its original state to do what it was supposed to do.

"Then, let's hear it. What exactly happened?"

The wizard asked with a very curious expression.

Taesan explained slowly.

What had happened inside Uroboros. Why it had been destroyed. And who was inside it.

"Was it Goshin?"

The wizard muttered, looking like he had expected as much.

Note: Uroboros is a mythological symbol of a snake eating its own tail, often representing cycles and self-destruction. Goshin is likely a character or entity mentioned earlier in the story.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I had expected it. There's no one else who can destroy Uroboros besides them. A worthless person went that far, didn't they? It was a more dangerous situation than I thought. And Essential... it's been a while since I've heard that name."

"Do you know?"

"We fought together as Transcenders back in the day, so of course I know."

The wizard spoke in a nonchalant tone.

"Since the concept didn't disappear, I thought Gosin must have killed him, but he didn't show up, so I wondered where he went, and it turns out he was inside Uroboros. I'll have to go meet him later."

"He didn't seem to recognize you, though."

"I've changed a lot since then. I'm the owner of the labyrinth now."

The wizard chuckled.

"So, the conclusion is that we destroyed the worthless person's fragment and restored Uroboros to its original state. Excellent. Well done."

The wizard was extremely pleased. His gaze towards Taesan was filled with favor.

"You did a great job. I didn't expect you to solve it on your own. I should give you a bigger reward for this."

The basic structure of the labyrinth is to give rewards to adventurers based on their achievements.

Taesan had done something that even Transcenders couldn't do, so the reward had to be enormous.

That's why Taesan asked the wizard, "Can I decide?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Go ahead and talk. I can hear everything anyway."

"That's right."

Taesan, who had returned to the labyrinth, opened his clenched fist.

The magician, who was smiling and looking at him, stopped.

In his hand was a scale of Uroboros.

The magician's face stiffened.

"......Just a moment."

[Uroboros' Scale] [The scale of the god who governs the cycle of all things. Its power is contained within.]

Taesan had obtained the scale directly from Uroboros.

Unlike Weisuk, it didn't have any special abilities. It meant that it was meaningless in its current state.

"Can you use this material to create what I want?"
