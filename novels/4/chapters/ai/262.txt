263. The Old Master (2)

The attack of the mortal struck the transcendental's body.

It was an incredibly astonishing event. An accomplishment that no one had achieved in thousands of years.

Taesan, unaware of this, was satisfied alone. Despite not a scratch on the body of the old master, the fact that the attack landed satisfied Taesan.

One arm of the old master moved. A tremendously powerful force accumulated, even beyond Taesan's control.

Yet Taesan responded with a smile.

"This time, victory is mine."

Boom!

The force gathered in the master's arm disperses.

Slowly, without regathering, it begins to be sucked into another dimension.

"It's time limit."

With Ilain's help, the old master descended into this place. And there was a time limit for the descent.

Originally, he might have endured longer than this, but he used excessive force to crush Taesan. The wave of energy used at the end was the largest.

Now the old master could no longer do anything in this place.

"So, get lost."
The black barrier surrounding them begins to collapse. Space expands and gently envelops the ancient evil.

The ancient evil has vanished.

[Congratulations.]

He offered sincere words of congratulations.

[You have won. This time.]

And the ancient evil concealed its presence.

With the powerful presence erased completely, Taesan's shoulders slumped.

'Was the spiritual ascension not triggered?'

Though disappointed, there was a part of him that thought it had gone well.

An alien presence. The very flesh of a transcendent being. If he had activated spiritual ascension against such a foe, it might have ended Taesan instead.

Not yet. Becoming stronger. Gaining power once more.

His tense body relaxes. The combativeness and determination that filled his mind vanish without a trace.

The battle didn't last long, but he was more exhausted than from any battle in his past lives.

"...Phew."

Taesan put strength back into his legs.

As the ancient evil said, he had emerged victorious. If that's the case, he should stand proudly as the winner.

Hwak!

The black barrier completely collapsed.

The surroundings came into view.

"Lord Taesan...."
Annette shouted in a trembling voice. Taesan, who noticed the cup beside them, frowned.

"Have you been watching?"

[Yes.]

Taesan nodded.

Her face was filled with endless satisfaction and pride.

"I wish you had helped a little."

[I believed you would win. And indeed, you returned victorious.]

"Well, yes..."

Taesan grumbled and turned away.

*Cough! Cough!*

The black space vanished, revealing Illyne, who had been buried within it.

He let out a bitter laugh.

"Hahaha... You truly are remarkable. Not only did you personally confront the great one and survive, but your spirit remains intact..."

Illyne's gaze upon Taesan was peculiar.

It was as if he were beholding something immense.

"You. Are you truly mortal? It raises doubts."

"For now, yes."

They hadn't yet reached their level. But someday, they would.

"First of all... congratulations. You have triumphed against the great one."

Illyne laughed as he neared death.
"However, this isn't a bad outcome for them either. You've confirmed your own strength firsthand, and now you understand even more clearly what you can do."

In the future, it meant that the Goshins would more directly aim for Mount Taesan.

In a voice as if his limbs were collapsing, Ilan said, dying.

"I wonder what path you'll take...?"

"You won't see what happens."

Taesan drove the sword into his chest. His body completely collapsed.

"That's quite... regrettable."

[Your spiritual awakening has been triggered.] [Proficiency in the special continuous activation skill [Cradle Dormant in Abyss] has increased by 6%.] [Proficiency in the special continuous activation skill [Twisted Spiritual Adjustment] has increased by 5%.] [Acquired the special continuous activation skill [Double Casting].]

The saint of Goshin died like that.

Taesan pulled out the sword. A ghost approached him.

"Did you win?"

"Yeah."

Taesan replied shortly. The ghost chuckled.

"A monstrous fellow."

"Hmm..."

Minerva, who had fallen, began to rise with her head in her hands.

"Why is she lying down?"

"Master made her faint for a moment. It was a bit noisy. Because of you."

"The master..."
Minerva quickly glanced around her. Her pupils dilated as she confirmed the sight of Taesan.

"Master!"

She rushed towards Taesan.

Stroking her head as she embraced herself, she said,

"I'm alive."

"Oh, Master. Master..."

Minerva rested her head against Taesan, tears streaming down. Her clothes were damp, but she didn't mind.

[Mashin did promise a solid answer, but seeing it happen is strange. How did he manage to overcome this?]

"Now it's a real monster. Hard to believe I faced that thing."

Barkaja asked curiously, and Quanad grumbled. Anetsha approached, holding back tears, and said,

"Congratulations. You truly are Taesan."

"Yeah."

After briefly looking at her, Taesan turned his gaze to Mashin.

"Mashin. You've completed your commission. How do you feel?"

[Very good. Very satisfied. Kang Taesan.]

Mashin chuckled.

* * *

The quest was over. It was time to return to the Labyrinth.

Thanks to Mashin's consideration, Taesan remained in the demon realm for a while.

[Even you must be quite tired. Rest easy.]

---

This translation captures the essence of the Korean text, conveying the emotional and narrative elements present in the original passage.
It was a thoughtful consideration. The battle with the ancient spirit was exhausting both mentally and physically. Taking a rest before entering the labyrinth was beneficial.

Barcaza and Minerva were momentarily summoned to the spirit realm.

Barcaza had expended considerable energy breaking through the forsaken land, while Minerva had poured all her strength into rescuing the ancient spirit during their fight.

As a result, Taesan rested in the demon realm for a day.

"It's about time."

There was little physical harm; if any, it was mental fatigue, which recovered within a day.

Now it was time to return to the labyrinth.

At that moment, Anetsha entered as the door opened.

"Taesan, are you feeling okay for a moment?"

"Yeah."

She sat opposite Taesan. After a brief pause, she spoke up.

"Taesan, you're truly amazing..."

It was pure admiration and respect.

The ancient spirit. A transcendent being that once dominated the demon realm as seen in legends. Though pursued by spirits, Taesan was on par with such beings.

To return victorious against such a being. Taesan lowered his head.

"It's not that remarkable."
Here's the translation of the text:

"No, it's quite remarkable. If it were me, I would have accepted defeat the moment I saw it."

Annette chuckled softly. She stopped laughing and asked,

"Lord Taesan, are you leaving now?"

"Yes, that's right."

"...Do you have any plans to come back here again?"

"Well, if there's a reason, I might come back. I can't say for certain."

"Then... may I ask just one thing?"

"Go ahead."

She took Taesan's hand.

"Someday, just once, I hope you'll come back here again."

Taesan nodded.

"I'll try."

"That's enough then."

Annette smiled.

After she left, Taesan waved his hand towards space. The space opened up and Taesan's body was sucked into it.

["Have you rested enough?"]

"Yes."

Mashin was seated on the throne.

She smiled broadly.

["As I mentioned earlier, I hope you find a place to rest your body."]

"I'll keep that in mind."

["That'll do. I'm not forcing you, so feel comfortable."]

Mashin crossed her legs.
Here is the translation of the text:

"[자아. 그러면 네가 그 고생을 한 보답을 받을 시간이지?]"
"Self. So it's time for you to receive the reward for your efforts?"

보상의 시간이었다.
It was time for compensation.

"[하지만 그 전에 궁금한 것이 제법 있어 보이는데?]"
"But before that, there seems to be something quite curious?"

“상당히 많지요.”
"Quite a lot, yes."

하지만 마신은 답하지 않으리라. 본능적으로 알 수 있었다.
But Mashin wouldn't answer. I could sense it instinctively.

마신이 애매한 얼굴로 입을 열었다.
Mashin opened his mouth with a vague expression.

"[무엇 때문인지는 추측하고 있을 거야. 네가 가진 경계선. 그 힘 때문이지. 하지만…… 예상했듯이, 나는 너에게 그 질문에 대한 답을 할 수 없어.]"
"I would guess it's because of what you possess. Because of your boundaries. Because of that power. But... as expected, I cannot answer that question for you."

그녀가 머리카락을 빙글빙글 돌렸다.
She twirled her hair around her finger.

"[왜냐하면 그건 네가 감당하기 어려운 일이거든.]"
"Because it's something you can't handle."

“제가 얻어낸, 제 힘인데도 말입니까?”
"Even though it's power I've acquired?"

[간단해. 네가 가진 그 힘으로 무엇을 할 수 있는지 알면 아주 많은 존재가 너를 노릴 거거든. 거기에는 초월자나 불멸자도 포함되어 있지.]
"It's simple. If others know what you can do with that power, many beings will target you. Including transcendent beings or immortals."

“……꽤 큰일인가 보군요.”
"...That sounds like quite a problem."

필멸자만이 아닌, 초월자조차 그를 죽이려 하다니. 달리 말하면 그들조차 태산이 가진 회색의 힘을 이질적으로 보고 있다는 의미였다.
Not only mortals, but even transcendent beings would try to kill him. In other words, they viewed the grey power he possessed as something alien.

마신이 쓴웃음을 지었다.
Mashin gave a bitter smile.
The ancient ones showed nothing but rage and hatred after being banished from this world. But greed, now that's unexpected. Do you realize how strange it is for an existence like yours, unchanging since birth, nearly eternal, to desire your power?

Mashin sighed.

"So I can't tell you. Knowing that would only confuse you more."

"Very well then."

"Hmm. Who would've thought you could obtain even that with the labyrinth's system."

She muttered. Mashin, who seemed to be lost in thought for a moment, clapped his hands to change the mood.

"Let's get to the point then. Taesan. You've perfectly fulfilled what I desired."

He erased the entire expanse of abandoned land that had been bothering his eyes. Not only that, he even managed to overcome the ancient Mashin who descended.

It couldn't have been more satisfying.

"As a reward, become my apostle..."

"I won't."

Taesan flatly refused.

Mashin, seemingly expecting Taesan's rejection, waved his finger without much change in expression.

"Well, I suppose so. There's no reason for you to become anyone's apostle right now. However... the power of an apostle itself will greatly aid you. So, for now, I'll give you this."

The aura of divinity enveloped Taesan.
Here's the translation of the text:

"The special activation skill [Apostle Transformation [Mixed Elegance]] has transformed into the special activation skill [Apostle Transformation [Darkness and Chaos]]. [You'll be satisfied when you check. Very. Seriously.]

Apostle Transformation was currently one of the most crucial skills, with high-ranking enemies popping up left and right. Therefore, the transformation of Apostle Transformation was one of the most satisfying rewards that could be gained.

[And... the ring you possess.]

The mage looked at the black ring.

[For white ones, they're too unique and demand too much power, so I can't touch them, but black ones should be doable.]

The mage's power imbued into the black ring. The ring emitted power as if resisting. The mage waved his finger as if finding it cute.

[Stay quiet there.]

*Kwoong!*

Power gathered into the ring.

The ring made a slight sound and the felt power became even stronger.

[I've loosened the restrictions imposed due to your lack of power a bit. Your ego has grown stronger accordingly, but... you should be able to manage it without issues now.]

"Thank you."

*For what. It's an inadequate reward considering what you've done.*

And it's not over yet. The mage added quietly.

The main reward was strictly black magic. All other rewards were personally given by the mage.
Here's the translation of the text:

"I originally intended to give you one intermediate dark magic spell. Among them, it was quite a decent one.

That much would have been a reward satisfying even a wealthy person. Just by seeing the frozen world or starlight arrows, one could understand the level of intermediate class.

But Mashin had a dubious expression.

'However, those guys interfered midway.'

'Those guys?'

'Demons who lend their power through dark magic, with whom I made a pact.'

Mashin narrowed his eyes.

'They have become interested in you.'

'...That doesn't sound like good news.'

Demons.

From the moment they are born, they are complete like gods, but their power itself isn't particularly great, so they make contracts with Mashin and lend their strength to the demons.

However, it's only because they're not as great as gods that they easily surpass the level of mortals.

Just by opening a passage and using beginner dark magic, one could see the power.

'It's not great news, but at least for now, it shouldn't be bad. Accept it.'

Darkness adheres to Taesan. It materializes and becomes part of the power."
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[You have obtained Intermediate Dark Magic [Naberius's Golden Blade].] [You have obtained Intermediate Dark Magic [Amon's Ebony Spike].] [You have obtained [Lemegeton].]"
