206. The Mysterious Forest of the 51st Floor (3)

"Will you receive it?"

He looked at me strongly and said. Taesan nodded his head.

"Yes."

If Itea-yeon's words were true, then to break through the 51st floor, I had to clear the gremmlin's quests first. Although there might be other ways, this was the standard route, so there was no reason to refuse.

[Accepting the sub-quest.]

The gremmlin let out a sly smile.

"Then, the first one is about those detestable fairy kids. They're very proud of their wings. Take them away and bring them to me."

"It's scary."

"They boasted about it to me first. I'm a lowly person who can't fly, and I'm stepping on the ground. Get out of our territory. If I take away their wings, what will they say?"

The gremmlin chuckled and waved his hand.

"Okay."

"What will you give me?"

I asked for something to help me clear the quest, such as an item or skill, but the gremmlin answered with a sly tone.

"Why would I give it to you? You should figure it out yourself."
Here is the translation of the text:

He pointed to himself with his index finger.

"I have something I want to ask you, so I've given you a quest."

This time, his finger was pointing at Taesan.

"So, the rest is up to you to handle. If you bring it back, I'll reward you, but if you can't, it will be a failure. It's only natural, isn't it?"

"What if I want to give up the quest and go back?"

"In that case, I'll send you back."

Gremelin spoke without any change in his expression.

"I'm not forcing you. You can choose whether to receive my quest or leave the forest and go back. Everything is up to your choice."

Gremelin didn't directly grab Taesan. It seemed like he was implying that whoever made the choice would have to take responsibility for it.

"Are you going to send me back?"

"Yes. If you want, I can send you back to the village with just one gesture. Will you do it?"

"No."

Taesan shook his head and thought.

"It seems like I'm being given a choice again."

He thought it was strange. The difficulty had suddenly increased, but he had never seen this city before. And there were people gathered there who seemed to have their hearts broken. The more he thought about it, the more unnatural it felt.
Here is the translation:

Taisean had finally understood the reason after encountering Gremelin directly.

The reason why the 51st floor was so unusual was because it was a kind of filter.

Should I go further?

Should I not?

I think those in the village would not give up easily. They would continue to receive Gremelin's quest and make an effort to break through the 51st floor.

However, all their efforts would have failed.

And eventually, they would realize that it was not allowed for themselves, that no matter how hard they tried, they could not go further, and that they could not overcome this filter.

Those who had given up would stay in the village created by the magician as a refuge.

The reason why only those who had given up were in the village was simple. Those who did not give up would either die trying to break through the 51st floor or head towards the 52nd floor after overcoming the filter, just like Yongsa, Quaned, and Iteyeon.

"Can I just bring back my wings? It doesn't matter how many there are?"

"It's better to have many, but at least one is enough."

Taisean left the forest.
Here is the translation of the text:

I escaped from the monochrome trees and arrived at a forest that was as colorful as a rainbow. Then, I heard the voices of the fairies again.

"[It's out!]" "[A fun human has come out!]" "[Let's play!]" they exclaimed.

Their laughter echoed and they scattered. The light that had disappeared earlier returned. The fairy king began to move his body to avoid them.

"Pa-pa-pa!"

The light pierced through the trees and was replaced by other trees.

"I wonder what Taeyoon did back then."

The fairies attack adventurers to the extent that they can survive and then leave, not to be seen for a long time.

After experiencing this several times, Taeyoon chose a method to prevent the fairies from getting bored.

Like a jester, she danced and sang, revealing her emotions. Since she was a woman with a rich emotional expression, she couldn't help but act out.

The fairies were curious about Taeyoon's appearance and watched her.

It was not a game of playing, but a game of watching, so the fairies did not attack. Taeyoon continued to play the fool.

The fairies' boundary with Taeyoon disappeared, and the distance between them grew closer.

The result of Taeyoon's fooling around for more than a month was this.
Here is the translation of the text:

And then, as Taeyeon judged that they were close enough, she rushed forward like a mad dog and grabbed the demon's neck.

Maybe her strategy was also one of the correct answers. But Taesan didn't think about using that.

Kiying.

Taesan, who had avoided all the light, clenched his fist.

[You activated the Marble Sea's black wave.]

Kuoooong!

The black wave charged towards the forest, trampling everything in its path. The demons' figures could be seen in the distance, attacking from afar.

[Run away.] [Run away.]

The demons let out brief cries and started running away.

Their distance was too far. The ordinary attack couldn't reach them.

So, it seemed that physical attacks wouldn't work.

[You activated acceleration.]

The body flew towards the demons at a rapid pace, their cries growing louder and scattering. Taesan targeted the demon closest to him.

[You activated emotional interference.] [Aagh, Ahh!]

Just as the demon was about to escape, Taesan suddenly grabbed its head and twisted its body. The demon, unable to quickly return to the forest, was quickly caught by Taesan.
Here is the translation of the text:

The goblin tried to hide in the forest, but it was too late. Taesan's sword had already pierced the goblin.

[Whoops!]

The goblin's face contorted in pain.

Taesan dropped his sword to the ground and the goblin let out a few more cries before collapsing.

[Aren't you feeling like a villain?]

"It's about that," Taesan said.

The goblin had a beautiful appearance, like something out of a fairy tale.

Taesan killed the goblin with his sword, and he felt a strange sensation.

Taesan took the goblin's wings from its corpse and returned to the realm of the gremlin. He blew a horn and gazed at Taesan with a bewildered expression.

"Already? ...No, I didn't give up. Did I?"

"Here."

Taesan handed the goblin's wings to the gremlin.

The gremlin muttered to himself, seemingly perplexed.

"...Right. What is this? Why did I get it so quickly? Even the fastest one took a week, but..."

His face was puzzled, but soon turned into a beaming smile as he attached the goblin's wings to his back.

"What's wrong?"

"It looks weird."

The gremlin's green body shone with the goblin's wings, which looked very unusual.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Hmm. It's probably because the size is different, right? It would be great if there were many fairy wings."

As expected, the next line from the goblin was:

"Take more of the fairies' wings."

"I don't think I can take any more than this."

The fairies had already been defeated by Taesan. It's likely that they wouldn't have come out if they had been cautious.

"Don't worry about that. I'll take care of it."

The goblin smiled mischievously.

* * *

"The fairy wings have special pheromones. They combine with the pheromones of their kind to inform each other of their location."

Bloop-bloop.

Something was simmering in the pot. The goblin put the fairy wings into it.

"And once I process these..."

He scattered various roots and branches around and put them into the pot.

"And then this..."

He finally added a black fragment to the pot.

Chi-chi-chi!

Suddenly, the simmering liquids quickly solidified. In no time, only small crystals remained.

The goblin gathered the crystals and pressed them tightly.

"I can now find the dwelling place of the fairies with this."
Here is the translation of the text:

"This can be done even if you have just one of those, right?"

"Yes. As long as you know the location, it's like having the wing of a fairy, which can be done with just one."

[The mark made by the wings of a fairy] [A mark made by high-level alchemy. It seems to guide you to the resting place of the fairies.]

"And since you are you now, it would have become a goal for those things, so you can take this too."

Gremory began to mix something with the remaining decisions. After completing it, he poured it into the mirror of the mountain god.

[You have obtained the transparent cloak of the fairy.] [The transparent cloak of the fairy] [A cloak made by high-level alchemy. It allows you to hide your body within a certain time range from the perception of the fairies, and the forest also recognizes you as a mysterious existence and does not change.]

"With this, you can go to the lair of those guys without any problems."

The mountain god read the effects quietly.

Both parts mentioned alchemy.

The mountain god's eyes sparkled with interest.

"If there's alchemy, can you combine something like medicine?"

"It's possible. That's why I can live and create my own domain here."

Gremory said with a pleased face.
Here is the translation of the text:

"If I've reached the pinnacle of alchemy, I have a different kind of power that's not magic. Although there's a lot to prepare, the effect is undeniable. Not only can I survive with my skills, but I can also live with the power of alchemy. Just look at this forest, which I've created with my own hands."

As I actually entered the Gremelin's Forest, the forest stopped changing. He had written something to prevent external beings from entering, it seemed.

"Those pesky little elves can't help but shine light from afar, but at least the threat of death is gone, so I'm satisfied."

"Are you creating a domain?"

"There are other abilities too, but that's the main one. If I handle it well, I can even turn the entire forest into my domain."

Gremelin sneered.

Tai Shan asked, "Can I also learn alchemy?"

Alchemy.

There was excitement. Iteyan had received a blessing powder made from the wings of a fairy as a reward for clearing the 51st floor, and it had an extraordinary effect of being able to use it infinitely without reducing mana for a certain period of time if applied to the body.

Since she used it all up while navigating the labyrinth, she hadn't directly experienced it herself, but if the effect was real, it would be quite significant for Tai Shan. It meant she could use it dozens of times in a row to thaw the frozen world.
Here is the translation of the text:

Perhaps that was also made through alchemy. If learned, not only would it be a reward, but also the ability to make something like that on one's own.

And the design of the area.

Even if it's inside the labyrinth, the value of those words is extremely high on this earth.

If obtained, it would be a great help.

"...You? Alchemy?"

Gremelin's face was filled with a sense of refusal. It was as if he had seen someone trying to take away a treasure he had painstakingly protected.

"This is something I've spent my whole life working on. I've collected this as my only hope because I don't want to live with those miserable relatives. Because of this, I was able to enter the labyrinth and take up residence here."

Gremelin spread his arms wide.

"Look at this forest! It's like a treasure trove of alchemy! The value of the scattered herbs is like gold, and even a single tree root is worth a fortune, as it only appears once every few decades outside!"

His face, which had been radiant with excitement, suddenly contorted with anger.
Here is the translation of the text:

"I didn't like my fellow humans. They are lowly and live day by day, barely surviving. So I learned alchemy. I learned it by dedicating my life to it, and I thought I had finally obtained the mysterious power to be on equal terms with them. But nothing changed. To them, I'm still just a grotesque goblin."

He chuckled.

"Did you say you wanted to learn alchemy?"

His eyes, filled with anger, turned to the goblin.

"Then kill those things. And bring me what I desire. Depending on what you bring and what you do, my mood will change."

"Alright."

The answer was received.

The goblin's body stiffened. It seemed to hesitate as Taesan was about to leave.

"Are you accepting this?"

"Why refuse?"

He would receive a perfect compensation. If not, the meaning of coming this far would be lost.

"Can I get the fairy's wings first?"

"Ah, ah, ah."

The goblin stuttered in response.

Taesan quickly ran through the forest. It was as if the cloak made of powder allowed him to enter the rainbow-colored forest, where the fairies were nowhere to be seen.

Taesan took out a bead and read the wave of power and its direction.

He approached quickly, but quietly. The forest didn't follow Taesan, so he was able to arrive at his destination faster than expected.

There was a small lake there.
Here is the translation of the text:

Above, numerous sprites were sprinkling water and playing.

And among them, there was also a giant sprite, three times larger than the others.

[The Fairy Queen appeared.] [It looks like she's on a trip with the others.]

A ghost whispered softly.

[Far stronger than the other sprites. It's not a monster from the 51st floor.]

"Instead, it's good."

Gremory's mood changed depending on what he brought.

If he brought the Queen's wings, he would be satisfied to that extent.

Tae-san quietly observed the sprites and began to devise a strategy.
