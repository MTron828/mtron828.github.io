304. 68th Floor

Crash.

The boss falls to the sword of Taesan. Rewards are given along with the floor clear window.

[You obtained Potion of All Stat Increases.] [You obtained ???] [Potion of All Stat Increases] [Increases all stats.] [You used Potion of All Stat Increases.] [Permanently increased health by 300, mana by 100, magic power by 50, strength by 200, agility by 200, intelligence by 200.]

Cleared 67th Floor.

Level increased by 2 levels. All secret rewards and rewards in the secret room are equipment related to black magic. Offered to the demon, I was able to learn intermediate black magic after a long time.

[Intermediate Black Magic: Sabnac's Abyssal Thread] [Mana Cost: 500] [Basic Magic Cost: 150] [Proficiency: 1%] [Summons Abyssal Threads made of Sabnac's power. Originally meant to carve worlds, now degraded to the level of carving the earth.]

Taesan immediately descended without delay.
The Earth Return quest is only noted to start a few days later, with no exact time specified. Until then, the plan was to descend as quickly as possible.

[Quest Start on 68th Floor] [Clear the labyrinth of the 68th floor and defeat the boss.] [Reward: Bracelet that once shed crimson blood] [Secret Reward: ???]

The 68th floor was much like the 67th, with nothing particularly unusual, so Taesan swiftly passed through the labyrinth.

Clearing monsters and improving proficiency, he progressed towards the boss.

At some point, ordinary floor monsters ceased to be significant opponents, prompting Taesan to focus more on increasing proficiency.

As a result, upon reaching the 68th floor, changes in proficiency brought about several skills with altered effects.

[Highest Grade Skill: Eye-lock Weapon Technique] [Proficiency: 40%] [A technique handling weapons and physicality. It became quite proficient, ensuring no loss in power transfer and capable of slightly affecting attack and defense stats.]

One of the skills that changed was the Eye-lock Weapon Technique.

It was a skill that saw such terrifyingly little change in proficiency. He acquired it immediately upon entering the labyrinth, and now it was only at 40%.
When detection reached 100% and reconnaissance expertise surpassed 60%, the proficiency increase was truly inexplicably high.

However, the change when proficiency rose was also unmistakable.

As Irik's weapon skill reached 40%, it was noted that it could affect attack and defense stats.

Taesan tested it directly on a monster. Handling the evolved Irik weapon skill due to increased proficiency came naturally to him, posing no issue.

The monster on the 68th floor was a dinosaur-like creature, a Tyrannosaurus. Taesan concentrated, wielding his sword toward the charging monster's mouth.

Thunk.

"Aaaargh!"

[5581 damage to the Guardian of the Deep Den.]

The monster recoiled with a scream. Observing the damage display, Taesan gauged the adjusted damage.

His current attack power was around 4900. Except for using Irik's weapon skill, the attack had no other changes to its base power. Yet it resulted in 5500 damage.

"About a 10% variance?"

A 10% increase in attack and defense. Taesan let out a bitter laugh.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Even though my proficiency is only 40%, it increased both attack and defense by 10%. As expected, the Irik weapon skill itself alters standards.

"With something like this, I pulled off thirty-five thousand damage."

It was a very light attack, not a genuine one. He had come to the heart of the depths and had not yet the confidence to overcome Ainztahr, having won over the guiding leadership.

'Loving goddess. Levinevnof.'

Ainztahr was coming down the labyrinth to find that god.

In his previous life, he hadn't found the goddess. At least, Lee Tae-yeon thought so.

But this time, Taesan had shown him the goddess's location.

The 78th floor's Great Treasury. The 24th secret room.

As he approached, he grew curious. Had Ainztahr indeed achieved his purpose?

What actions would he show when he met the goddess?

[Special Activating Skill: Breathless Attack] [Mana Consumption: 2] [Proficiency: 81%] [During battle, can move with breath ignored for about 3 minutes, using full power.]

Even the small Breathless Attack skill has increased proficiency.

And sensory enhancement, too, has reached 100% proficiency.
[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Enhanced Sensory Perception] [Proficiency: 100%] [Enhances sensory perception. Able to sense life and objects such as corners. Can better perceive the unseen. Observes an area within a certain radius around oneself.]

There was no change in the content itself when proficiency was at 80%. However, upon reaching 100%, a new skill emerged.

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Sensory Resonance] [Proficiency: 1%] [Resonates with the senses within a certain radius around oneself. It seems the range is not yet fully understood.]

A certain range. That is, from the center of Mount Taesan to the size of a labyrinth room.

It felt as if everything was within reach, as if touching, sniffing, and detecting all things were within my senses.

Until now, I've gained skills to observe and understand the surroundings several times, but sensory resonance was much more direct than those. It literally felt like the range that the body could reach had expanded.

Naturally, the sharp senses that were already sharp became even sharper. Now, even the brain would find it impossible to approach beside Taesan, avoiding his eyes and senses.

"I wonder if this is possible with Lee Taeyeon."

She possessed many combat evasion skills. Some of them did not fall far behind the main skills Taesan possessed.
In a previous life, Taesan frequently sparred with Itaeyeon, but even then, he couldn't find Itaeyeon when she deliberately hid herself.

She was truly specialized in evasion.

However, in their previous lives, those skills rarely shone. Since there were hardly any opponents to face except for Taesan and Itaeyeon when confronting S-rank threats that dashed in at every moment.

If Itaeyeon were to hide now, many others would perish, so she had no choice but to seal most of her evasion-related skills.

"What a pity, this woman," muttered Taesan.

In addition, proficiency in various minor skills had greatly increased. With the depths in sight, the number of skills now reaching 100% was also quite substantial.

Taesan cleared the 68th floor. The boss on the 68th floor was a monster like a red Tyrannosaurus. Taesan manifested magic towards the rushing monster.

"You have activated Sabnack's Ebony Thread."

Kiing.

A bunched thread appeared over Taesan's hand. Shortly after, the thread began to unravel, shaking the surroundings. Taesan quickly drew out his shield.

"You have activated Aegis's Shield."

Kagagagagak!
Here's the translation of the text:

"The thread cuts through the entire space. Even though Taesan was fiercely striking, the damage was nullified by the Aegis shield.

Kuuuuung!

The charging Tyrannosaurus rex is torn to pieces and falls.

The newly obtained Sabnack's jet-black thread shreds everything around it.

Even Taesan, the user, was astonished.

When first used, I didn't know and activated it, and about 20% of my health disappeared.

The power was undeniable. It possessed greater power than any skill Taesan wielded.

However, its stability was lacking. If used carelessly, it could become a suicide bomber.

Fortunately, there was some time before the entwined thread unraveled. I could avoid damage by escaping with a random blink or the like.

Understanding the power and usage of the skill, Taesan began checking the rewards on the 68th floor.

[Bracelet with the Flowing Crimson Blood] [Strength + 400] [Agility + 200] [Attack Power + 200] [Defense + 200] [A bracelet dyed with the crimson blood of an adult. The one who killed the great and merciful adult carried this bracelet throughout their life.]"
As always, it was a reliable equipment. As he delved deeper, the performance of the equipment seemed to be improving.

In the case of secret rooms and secret rewards, both were rings.

[Ring of the Black Witch's Ebony] [Dark Magic + 50] [Magic + 50] [Intelligence + 100] [A ring wielded by the black witch who ruled over the darkened lands and worshipped a demon that dominated the darkened earth. Her posthumous ring flowed into the labyrinth.] [Ring of the Cruel Tyrant] [Strength + 200] [Attack Power + 100] [Defense + 100] [A ring of the tyrant who alone conquered the world. He wiped out anyone who opposed his views, even down to killing a dog. Until he died of old age, the world was darkness itself.]

Taesan replaced his equipment and ventured into the labyrinth once more.

Floor 69 began.

Taesan raised his sword.

---

Swish.

In the blue forest, Taesan swung his sword down. A beast charging to trample him was cleaved in half and disappeared.
The quest on the 69th floor was to find a single flower in the dense forest. As they traversed through the forest, monsters hidden within attacked them, making it extremely difficult to find the flower amidst the vast and dense vegetation.

Of course, it posed no problem for Taesan.

With his heightened senses, he could easily block the monsters' attacks without even seeing them. Able to immediately pinpoint the location of treasures through reconnaissance and understanding of essence, Taesan advanced straight towards the treasure.

And there, Taesan discovered a golden flower. The moment he tried to pluck the flower, space suddenly tore apart, revealing darkness.

"Hello?"

"Long time no see," Taesan bowed politely.

Jet-black hair. Youthful face.

It was Mashin.

"I suppose you know why I've appeared?"

Taesan nodded. Mashin appearing like this meant it was time once again to fight the harbinger of sin and evil.

"Your next opponent is on the 70th floor. It's the final place leading to the depths. They'll be waiting there."

"Is that so."

"And from now on, I've altered the rules a bit. Your power is almost reaching them."

It wasn't difficult to understand what he meant.
The following is the translation of the Korean text:

Throughout the battles with Taesan and the leadership, Mashin has largely sided with Taesan. This was not due to favoritism towards him, but rather to ensure that there could be a fair fight between them.

In other words, Taesan has now reached a point where Mashin no longer favors him excessively. Mashin spoke up.

"I've kept your information from reaching them so far."

This was a significant advantage for Taesan. Many of Taesan's skills make a big difference based on whether their effects are known.

"But now, I'm going to remove that restriction. The guides we meet from now on will understand your skills, and that information will flow to them."

"Understood."

Taesan nodded. Upon his easy acceptance, Mashin smiled faintly.

"I thought you might complain a little. It's a very disadvantageous condition for you, isn't it?"

"It's something you personally decided, Mashin. It means it's fair for both of us to fight."

And so Taesan simply follows.

Mashin chuckled satisfactorily.

"Will you be returning to your hometown this time?"

"Yes."

"As always, return victorious. I'll be waiting for your victory report."

With those words, Mashin disappeared from sight.
New guidepost leadership. Who could the opponent be?

There was a guess as to who the opponent might be.

Taesan held a golden flower in his hand.

Clearing level 69.

At the same time, a system window announcing return to Earth appeared.

* * *

[Returning to Earth in one hour. Please finish your preparations.]

"He's even kind."

An hour later. It was a difficult time to descend further down the levels. It seemed necessary to return to Earth before stepping on level 70.

And there was something to do in the remaining hour.

Taesan climbed the labyrinth. 65th floor. There he found Hafran, hammering away.

"You came."

Hafran was there with a grim face.

"Is it done?"

Taesan had commissioned the creation of an equipment piece using materials obtained from Hafran's devastated world.

As much as the materials were challenging, it seemed Hafran had struggled quite a bit with the crafting. Hafran nodded.

"The timing's good. Finished it just a while ago."

"Faster than I expected. Thought it'd take longer than this."
"Most of it was material from my world. But I thought it was dying. Damn equipment kept rejecting my touch, it was a nightmare."

Harfran grumbled. His words sparked Taesan's interest.

Equipment rejecting Harfran's touch.

It meant equipment usable even after deep dives, not just a pair of rings made earlier. Harfran handed Taesan a bracelet.

"Take it. The equipment you wanted, something you can handle with willpower."

[You have acquired a bracelet steeped in despair, a part of the world.]
