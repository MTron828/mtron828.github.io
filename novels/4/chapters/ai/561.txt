**Chapter 562**

562. 98th Floor. A Complete Existence. Gosin (5)

Kwaaaaaa!

The condensed physical power is unleashed. The accumulated power within it sweeps through all directions.

Kwagagagagagang!

The interior of the abyss is swept away. The black things are crushed and scattered by the gray physical power.

The abyss. The administrator of the bottomless pit. Its authority is, literally, infinite.

That infinite power is swept away by physical power.

The abyss couldn't help but come this far. It realized that the massive mountain it had devoured was trying to come out from within itself.

The abyss was enraged.

It is the one who devours everything.

There is nothing it cannot contain.

If it just wills it, it can contain not only the universe but also the Gosin in its hole. It was a being with such immense power.

The only existence granted infinity. That was the abyss.

To confront that infinity head-on...

The abyss expands its abyss, fueled by rage and its own power.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan could feel it. The inner universe of Mujegang was expanding infinitely. Its speed was surpassing the expansion speed of the universe.

So, what's going on?

What he wanted was not to fill infinity.

It was to break through infinity.

With his physical strength, it was more than possible.

"I understand why the wizard had to face Mujegang."

With a thought, his sword flashed. The sword destroyed the space, and the shockwave swept through in all directions.

The infinitely expanding space couldn't withstand Taesan's physical strength.

Mujegang realized.

This was something he couldn't swallow.

It was a fact that something was surpassing his own realm.

The shockwave was so intense that it could be felt even from the outside. The demon god let out a groan.

[Unbelievable…….]

Crunch.

The infinite power was shattered.

Taesan poured out his strength and pulled back.

[Mujegang took 782,560,331,566 damage.] [Mujegang took 782,560,331,566 damage.] [Mujegang took 783,333,127,124 damage.] [Mujegang took 783,333,127,124 damage.] [Mujegang took 55,864,546,432 damage.] [Mujegang took 55,554,576,412 damage.]

Note: Mujegang seems to be a powerful entity, and Taesan is using his physical strength to attack it. The numbers at the end appear to be damage values, indicating the amount of damage Taesan is dealing to Mujegang.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Total damage exceeding 3 digits.

Everything is converted to physical strength, sweeping through the interior of the void.

Whoa!

Infinity opens up. A massive hole is created due to physical strength, and the universe reveals its form.

Waaaah!

The remaining aftermath still ravages the universe, sweeping away all concepts of time and space within its range, including their original forms. Even the gods are shocked and shrouded in darkness.

[Ugh...].

But the darkness is stripped away in an instant. The goddess's eyes become serious. She clenches her fist.

Kiiiiing.

A thick and deep darkness creates a protective barrier around her.

Kukukukuku….

Only then could she be free from the aftermath of physical strength.

[…Unbelievable.]

The goddess let out a dry laugh. It wasn't a direct hit. She was somewhat distant from the aftermath. She must have consumed considerable power while penetrating the void's body.

Even so, she had to use all her might to barely block it.

Sigh.

Taesan returned to the universe through the hole."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He turned around to check the state of the abyss. Taesan wore a satisfied smile.

"Good."

Part of the abyss was torn open. Like a burst of gunfire, the abyss's power was constantly pouring out from within.

Ku-gu-gu-gung......

The abyss's body trembled. The feeling of pain that seemed to tear the heavens apart was contained within.

[Uh, uh.]

Bardley let out a sigh.

[This time, it seems like it's really broken.]

"It's not broken, I said."

[It's giving me the chills. What is this?] [Master... this is.]

Akasha also couldn't continue speaking. The demon approached with a flustered face.

[Taesan, how...].

"I just forced my way through with power."

[You forced your way through the abyss with power?]

The demon let out a laugh.

Who was the abyss? It was the owner of the bottomless abyss. It could render everything that reached it meaningless, making it all worthless.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Not a few transcenders were trapped inside the abyss and couldn't escape. Even if all the transcenders in the universe gathered, they couldn't find a way to suppress the abyss, so they forcibly expanded the space itself to create a space where nothing could reach. They couldn't find an answer with the orthodox method, so they used a shortcut.

But Taesan has now broken through the abyss with his power.

It meant that he had accomplished something that no transcender in the universe could do.

[How is that possible?]

"The abyss clearly devours everything. There's no bottom."

Even the universe or gods could be contained within it.

"But there's a limit to what it can devour."

It didn't mean that it could truly devour everything; it just didn't have a bottom.

Just like the black ink, if the concept and power were too high, the abyss couldn't devour it.

And the physical force created by multiplication was a power that the abyss couldn't devour.

That's what broke through the infinite.

[……Do you know what that means?]

It meant that the power Taesan wielded now surpassed any transcender in the universe. The idea of breaking through the infinite with power itself was unimaginable.

[It's beyond my imagination. I don't know if the wizard will be happy or sad.]

The wizard smiled faintly."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[No matter what, I'm back safely. Did you intentionally let me in?]"

"I judged that it would be more effective to detonate it from the inside rather than responding from the outside. And I had a card that could do just that."

"[Wow, that's amazing.]"

"But still, you really went inside the abyss. If you made a mistake, you might not have been able to come back out again. Mashin laughed, and his eyes shone with admiration and respect."

"[You're amazing, as always...]"

A sincere voice resonated.

But there was no time to chat leisurely.

!!!!

The existence of this world was overwhelmed by an unbearable howling.

The abyss trembled. A dark, inky liquid poured out of the holes in the flesh-like mass.

The amount was unimaginable.

It was as if it would corrupt the entire universe.

"[You dealt a significant blow to the abyss with one strike. It's not recoverable. But... it's still dangerous.]"

Mashin gathered his dark energy with a serious face.

"[Those liquids flowing out are beyond the abyss's control. If we're not careful, the entire universe might get sucked in and disappear.]"

KUUUUUUUUUUUUNG!
Here is the translation of the text:

The darkness spreads. A massive curtain, separating the two and the universe, is born.

[I can try to block it, but it's hard to hold out for long... I'm sorry, but I'll ask again.]

"I understand."

Blame.

Taesan has arrived in front of Mujeong's lair.

Mujeong, who had been in pain, looks at Taesan.

It contains pain and intense hatred.

It was a fierce enemy intent on harming Taesan, who had inflicted wounds on their own power.

"I have inflicted harm, after all."

However, there is still little hope. Taesan had used up one of their strongest cards, just like it was nothing.

The pressure is still intense.

It's okay to say that it's one step higher.

So, it was necessary to take one step higher.

The boundary beast is summoned. A distorted figure, accompanied by a crying sound, is realized in the world.

This is the realization of the boundary itself. A world between the universe and beyond.

However, it was still difficult to break through Mujeong's lair.

Mujeong's body trembles. The boundary, and so on. It seems to be saying, "I'll swallow everything and bury it all" with a greedy look.
Here is the translation of the text:

If I were a monster of the border, I could tear everything apart and break through with my power. However, it was impossible to break through the true body of the Mujeong with my physical strength, as it was not bound by any limits.

In the end, I had to rely on the power to transcend the boundary to break through it.

At least, the monster of the border did not have the power to break through everything and crush the pride of the true body.

Therefore, I gave it that power and boundary.

The most distinctive feature of the border was that it had both a domain and a sense of self as a monster.

Even without the command of the Taesan, I could act according to my own will.

Then, can I truly give life to that sense of self?

Can I truly bring life to the border as a living being?

The Taesan had the power to make that possible.

[You have activated the cycle.]

Kiing.

The cycle touches the monster of the border.

The monster of the border lets out a low wail. From the beginning, it showed a rejection response to the cycle. The Taesan also knew this fact.

So, he gradually trained the monster like an animal.

He gradually got it used to the cycle.

As a result, the monster did not strongly reject the cycle from a certain point on.

"Accept."

I issue a command with power.
Here is the translation of the text:

And finally, the completeness of the cycle is contained within the beast.

Thud.

The sound of pounding echoes.

The beast, which had not possessed a true form, begins to take on a physical shape.

The boundary begins to cycle. It rotates and revolves, creating a rule and regulation for itself.

The area begins to expand.

The beast of the boundary is undoubtedly powerful.

It surpasses all things, including all living beings, and its own domain is extremely vast and lofty.

However, it was not perfect.

The boundary is a realm beyond. It is wielded in this universe.

Ultimately, it appears as something external in the universe.

The concept of the external is wielded in the universe. Of course, there would be some loss, as it is inevitable. Even if the boundary surpasses all things, it is not enough to solve all problems with just that.

But now, the boundary begins to encompass the laws of the world.

Crrr...

And finally...

The beast becomes alive.

[The owner of the boundary has changed.] [The transcendent [boundary] has changed.]
Here is the translation of the text to English:

The system window did not appear. All that was left was that two things had changed, obtained by Taesan.

But Taesan knew what had happened and what had changed better than anyone else.

Gulp.

The material boundary took its place next to Taesan.

It was the same as an amorphous entity without a proper form. However, it could be touched and felt now.

The boundary's level had changed.

But this change was not bad.

!!!

The enraged bottomless pit expanded its body. The abyss flowing out shot towards Taesan.

Only with the pure boundary could not respond to that abyss. It could only be broken down using physical power multiplied by a thousand.

But now it was no longer the case.

"Hold back."

A zone of life was born. It obtained the perfect physical power and flew towards the abyss with its own will, colliding with it.

Kwaaaah!

With a loud noise, the abyss burst apart. The boundary rushed out and took its place next to Taesan.

"Now it's done."

Taesan laughed joyfully.

The power of a complete and intact high spirit.

With its own power, it could respond to the boundary alone, without any other external force.
He has reached a level equal to his highest state and is saying "Let's do it again properly."
