Chapter 220

220. The World of Spirits and Humans, Arulia (3)

"Ah, how unfortunate..."

Akiel was in a very pitiful state.

In this world, a spirit was literally everything. When judging a person, one looked at what kind of spirit they had contracted with first, and then at how well they could handle the spirit, rather than how talented they were physically or intellectually.

No matter how exceptional one's architectural skills, no matter how physically talented, no matter how high one's intelligence, if one couldn't handle spirit magic properly, they would be treated as a lowly being.

"Even Taesan is fine, I suppose."

Taesan was strong. He had the power to summon low-level spirits with just his bare body.

With that kind of strength, one could receive treatment anywhere, even if they had no talent for spirit magic at all.

But that was all just talk from behind. He was just a foolish person who couldn't handle spirits too.

"Right?"

Taesan leaned against the carriage wall.

The carriage continued on its journey. Tai Shan was quietly closing his eyes, and Akien looked at Tai Shan with growing unease, glancing at him again and again.

"Is it really true that the color of the gemstone hasn't changed?"

Perina whispered as she approached, and Akien quickly covered her mouth.

"Be quiet!"

"What's wrong? It seems like he's sleeping. I'm not trying to provoke him, I'm just curious."

Akien nodded slightly. Perina let out a small sigh.

"People who don't react to the gemstone... I think such a person really exists. It's not recorded in the historical books, though."

"I don't know about it either."

Their world was a world where spirits and humans coexisted. Every being born with the ability to sense spirits.

Perina muttered to herself with a strange expression.

"Maybe this person didn't come from around here?"

"What do you mean?"

"What's wrong? I heard a legend when I was young."

Akien realized what she was saying.

"The labyrinth?"

"yes."

"Ah, no."

Akien shook her head.

"That's just a legend. Such a place doesn't really exist, right?"

"That's true."
Here is the translation of the text:

Perry nodded in agreement, saying it wasn't a serious matter.

And then he listened to their whispers. He didn't worry about it and continued to think.

He couldn't use magic. He didn't have the talent at all.

Tae-san didn't show any particular reaction to this fact.

Even from the beginning, Ore said that only those who were allowed by the gods could learn the power. And Tae-san had already known this from the beginning.

It was the same as the people of the earth, who received the blessing of the demon and gained power. He said.

"What's going on?"

Ore had activated the divine blessing by defeating the Sword Masters and rising to a higher level. Therefore, he was able to obtain it.

But now, it was an impossible method. The skill would not activate unless there was a significant difference in power.

Back then, he was not as different in power from the Sword Masters as he is now.

But Tae-san was now much stronger. Even if he defeated the humans who had contracted with the high-ranking demons, the skill would not activate.

Tae-san spoke calmly.
Here is the translation of the text:

When I thought it was impossible to learn, there were many such times.

However, I learned everything, including addition, multiplication, and copying.

It won't be any different for the magical arts.

"'First, let's clarify the premise.'"

The carriage stopped. The people who got out called for the spirits to gather.

'[My lord......]'

"It's fine, isn't it? On the contrary, I've become troubled because of you guys!'

The spirits looked at Taesan with caution, and they didn't understand those kinds of spirits.

"Can you boil some water?"

'[......Understood.]'

The spirit let out a sigh and summoned its strength.

Taesan, who had been watching, approached. The spirit reflexively unfolded its screen.

"Don't do that!"

"Is it okay?"

Taesan rebuked the spirit, Aki-en, and asked. Aki-en nodded greatly.

"Yes, yes. You can ask anything."

"This jewel is said to show the talent for handling magical arts, isn't it?"

Taesan picked up the jewel. The jewel still had no color.

"Yes."

"What does it mean, exactly, that it can't be contracted because it lacks attributes?"

Here is the translation of the text:

"It means exactly what I said. Can you take care of this for me?"

Akien was transferring the preparation of the meal to someone else and brought a wooden stick. He started drawing a line on the floor with it.

"The contract with the spirit is a way to summon a spirit from the spirit realm and synchronize with it. In other words, it's not possible to do something actively from the summoning side. The spirit has to respond first."

The line he drew became a magic circle. Akien placed his hand on it.

Whoosh.

The magic circle responded. Taesan confirmed that the power spreading from the magic circle was mana.

He read the pattern, approach, and strength of the power.

Next, energy flowed out from Akien and covered the magic circle.

At the same time, the magic circle began to glow green.

"I have the property of the forest. That's why when I summon a spirit, the spirit that corresponds to that property responds."

"Isn't the spirit not responding?"

"Yes. I need a response from the other side for the contract to be possible, and if there's no property, there's no responding spirit."

"That's right."

Note: Taesan is not a character mentioned in the original text, I assume it's a mistake and it should be Akien.
Here is the translation of the text:

Fundamentally, mana is what brings out a magical circle. Even the Great Sage has it.

And depending on the properties of the one who brings out the magical circle, a corresponding spirit will answer in a specific form.

The Great Sage, having understood the process, smiled slightly.

"Ah, it's been confirmed. I'm grateful."

"What is it?"

Akiel laughed. She thought she had summoned the Great Sage to check if she had learned magic, but it seemed that the Great Sage was actually grateful.

'Maybe I'll stop after a while.'

One cannot learn unless the answering spirit is present. That's certain.

The preparation for the meal was over.

They started eating.

* * *

After the meal, the carriage moved slowly, and the enemies who were hindering them appeared again.

"What's this again?"

[My lord!]

The dark spirits, their powers unleashed, attacked them. Akiel was using magic to defend, but she was still being pushed back.

The Great Sage approached the dark spirit.

The dark spirit that had confirmed the Great Sage, inflated and charged at the Great Sage, drawing out endless malice.

Suddenly.

The Great Sage grabbed that spirit.
Here is the translation of the text:

From the dark-tinged spirit, flames burst forth. Akihen's eyes widened as he watched the flames engulf the entire body of Taesan, who was fueled by an intense blaze. "Taesan... sir?" Akihen asked, his voice trembling.

"The power has increased slightly," Taesan replied, his expression unchanged.

Taesan checked the spirit's condition amidst the flames. "Has my soul been consumed? Even if I'm seen as corrupted, it's nothing to worry about."

Taesan's hand tightened its grip. The spirit was crushed and vanished. His hand moved swiftly, and the dark-tinged spirits that had been chasing after him all scattered.

Akihen's eyes widened in awe. "You're really powerful..."

"What are their true forms?" Akihen asked.

"Yes, they appeared along with the dark-tinged spirits. These spirits don't communicate with each other or make contracts. They only show their hostility and attack us."

"Is that so?"

Akihen roughly grasped the situation.

The demon king was taking advantage of the void left by the spirit king, and the spirit god, Beatrice, was blocking his attack. However, it was impossible to block everything. A simple comparison of powers would suggest that the demons were stronger than the gods currently.
Here is the translation of the text:

Even though their strength was infinite up to a certain point, they were actually superior. The god of magic was also waiting for them to cross that point, just like the divine spirits. As a result, the divine spirits seemed to have fallen.

"For someone who claims to have won, they're actually quite a hindrance."

As before, the god of darkness would interfere when he was about to achieve his goal.

The mountain god was making preparations.

The dark divine spirits were once again approaching. The carriage moved slowly, and before it reached its destination, night fell.

The mountain god didn't sleep, but it was different for them, so they naturally fell asleep.

When they were all asleep, the mountain god got out of the carriage.

A divine spirit guarding the boundary was shocked and summoned its power.

"You!"

"Don't be so cautious. You're so weak that you can be killed with just a finger. And you're not even thinking about it."

"What's your goal?"

"It's beneficial to you."

"...I don't believe it."

"Believe it or not?"

The mountain god spoke carelessly and passed by the divine spirit.
Here is the translation of the text:

He entered the forest. Since it was a world of magic, the natural energy was much stronger than on earth.

He drew his sword.

He drew a line on the ground, creating a magical circle that Akien had made. Then, he poured mana into it.

Although he poured mana into it just like Akien had done, the magical circle did not respond.

It was because there was no spirit of the responding attribute.

Up until this point, I knew it. The problem was from here on.

"Is it really?"

Tai Shan raised his index finger.

The pure white ring, which had been shrouded in darkness, began to shine.

[A ring that is imbued with both the elegance and mystery of pure white. It is used to assist the user by harmonizing with their spirit and can store many powers to be used when needed. It is a ring that was created by combining the source of light and the source of the savior. Although it is a ring that has been shaped by the collision of great powers, it has a single-minded and dignified self. It accepts everything except for twins. Those who have fully mastered this ring will gain another power.]

The ring has two effects. It uses the spirit that is inherent to it to harmonize with the user and assist them.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

And there was a vast amount of power stored, which could be used when needed.

The Taesan was in harmony with the ring. The ring, with its own will, harmonized with the owner's intention and began to draw out power.

Wooo!

The aura around it began to flow towards the ring.

However, it was weak.

The speed at which the power flowed was also slow. The Taesan could not summon a spirit of the desired level.

The Taesan focused its mind even more.

Time passed.

The grasses scattered on the ground.

Leaves blown by the wind.

As the sun rises, the dew on the leaves began to seep into the ring.

The power contained in each one began to seep into the ring.

As the gathered power harmonized with the magic circle, the magic circle began to shine with a brilliant color.

Ki-ki-ki!

If there was no attribute, it was impossible to contract with a spirit, but by gathering attributes, it was possible to contract with a spirit.

The light spreading from the magic circle began to change into a rainbow color. The Taesan pulled out even more power from it.

Kuuu!

The power accumulated in the ring exploded and seeped into the magic circle.

At the same time, nature began to gather. The power around it gathered and took the form of a single entity.
Here is the translation of the text:

I am a high-level spirit with a variety of colors, Barukaza.

I was a green spirit in the shape of a golem. The power that could be felt there was a power that even the Great Mountain could not ignore.

[Who summoned me...?]

"Hello?"

The Great Mountain waved its hand. The spirit stopped speaking when it saw the Great Mountain.

[You...]

"I want to make a contract. I don't want to hear a refusal."

The Great Mountain drew out a pair of daggers and muttered to itself.

"Let's go quickly. Quickly."

It moved its body.
