11. 1st Floor. The Seeker of God. Holy Knight Ainzhar (6)

The fist moved.

Slowly.

But with certainty.

[Your Death Line has been activated.]

The system window warned. Even without that, he couldn't have known.

That fist holds the power to kill him.

His body moved faster than his mind. Taesan raised his shield. He hunched his posture in preparation for the impact.

Kwung.

The shield meets the fist. Taesan is astonished by the force felt beyond.

"This..."

It's not just a matter of strong power. It was heavy. It felt like the very mountain itself was pressing down.

Taesan grits his teeth. He swells his muscles to their limits. He forcibly twists the direction of the force.

Kkagak!

With a rough sound, he moves the shield. He deflects the point of impact of the fist and redirects the force.

[You have received the power of the mountain. Strength permanently increases by 1.] [You have released the power of the mountain. Acquired special activation skill [Deflection].]

"Hoho?"

Admiration fills Ainzhar's face.

"Well then, how about this?"
Here is the translation of the text into English:

The fist aimed straight ahead. It headed directly towards Taesan, crushing the shield's movement attempting to deflect its power.

Taesan quickly made his decision.

I can't block that. The difference in strength is too great, technique or whatever.

If that's the case, then don't block it.

He tensed his body. As Taesan lowered his stance, the trajectory of the fist naturally moved downwards. The tilted shield and fist aligned.

Taesan let go of the shield. He forcefully kicked backwards with all his might.

Kwaaang!

[You have received 35,211 damage.] [Activation of Non-Lethal Attack. Damage nullified.]

"Kuock!"

His body slammed into the wall with the shield. The sturdy labyrinth stone wall crumbled, revealing the sight beyond.

Taesan confirmed this fact through the sensation on his back and let out a bitter laugh.

"What kind of thing is this?"

To demolish the labyrinth's wall in one blow. Unheard of. Whatever player or monster he had encountered before, the old man before his eyes achieved something they couldn't even dream of.

And on top of that, the damage.

Despite his best efforts to reduce the damage by throwing his body, it was thirty-five thousand. Just this one blow is enough to tell.

This old man is incomparably stronger than Lee Taeyeon.

"What on earth...?"
Here is the English translation of the text:

"There were only gatekeepers and pure monsters. Even then, it was difficult to guarantee a win against the previous Gra."

"Hooh!"

But the old man was looking at Taesan with an admiring expression.

"I thought I'd get a hundred thousand, but I barely got thirty thousand! Impressive!"

"You can't just stand there and take it."

"That's true."

Chuckling, the old man asked Taesan,

"Who are you?"

"Do I have a reason to tell you that?"

Taesan replied sharply. The old man chuckled.

"So that's why you didn't use lethal attacks. I have no intention of killing a first-time opponent either. Even if I had attacked you sincerely, you had the resilience to endure it. I judged there was no issue."

"...Did you see it?"

"Mm!"

Nodding vigorously with a clenched fist,

"The determination to step into death to survive! It was truly admirable! And indeed, you have excellent skills! Dodging my attacks with such weak stats!"

The old man spat with force. Taesan furrowed his brow as he listened to the old man's words.

"Do you know about skills?"
Here is the translation of the text:

NPCs with their own consciousness exist only in Alon Mode. However, Itaeyeon had never heard them say they knew skills.

There were two possible answers. Either they didn't say, or maybe she didn't know either.

"Honestly, I was worried I might be weak, but it was a pointless worry! I have overflowing passing points!"

The old man looking at Taesan looked infinitely satisfied.

"Adventurer. What is your name?"

"Kang Taesan."

"Taesan! It's a very honorable meeting!"

The old man, Ainzhar, smiled brightly.

"Blessings on this miracle! I am one who seeks God. They call me Ainzhar!"

* * *

Ainzhar now seemed to have no intention of doing anything to him. Taesan first regained control of his body. There was no damage from the non-lethal attack, but the tingling shock didn't disappear.

As he regulated his body, he checked his skills.

[Special Activation Skill: Deflect] [Mana Cost: 5] [Proficiency: 24%] [Redirects the center of attacks to reduce damage. Seems like it can deflect attacks from any weapon.]

Taesan, checking his proficiency, let out a bitter laugh.

Already 24% proficiency. It meant it was worth blocking a single blow.
Here is the translation of the text:

Moreover, his strength increased by 1. It was extremely rare for a stat increase to occur without any conditions. It was the result reflecting the impact of Ainzhar's attack.

"Why do you look like that?"

"It's nothing."

"If you have any questions, ask me anything! I'll answer!"

The old man shouted jovially. Taesan, observing his demeanor, narrowed his eyes.

'As expected, different.'

Itaeyeon had also met Ainzhar at the First Floor Fountain of Life. She too mentioned undergoing the test of a single blow, just like Taesan.

But she didn't react at all.

Just as she arrived at the safety zone and breathed a sigh of relief, the old man suddenly appeared and threw a punch. It was an attack with enough force to kill him. She, who was just starting to adapt, had no response.

Ainzhar licked his lips towards Itaeyeon, who was staring blankly at the fist.

["You're just a coward."]

With those words, Ainzhar left. He turned away from the fountain, casting a scornful glance at her.

Itaeyeon said she never saw Ainzhar again.

If one were to believe her words were true, Ainzhar's attitude towards Itaeyeon and Taesan was markedly different. Ainzhar looked upon Taesan with a satisfied expression.
"May I ask you something?"

"Anything!"

"Why did you suddenly attack? Was it to torment the weak?"

Now they're only on the first floor. There's no one here who can face someone like Ainzhar. In a sense, this was a bug NPC.

"That's not it. Even so, as a Paladin, would I persecute the weak?"

The Golden Knight said confidently.

"I'm here to evaluate those who visit this place."

"Evaluate?"

"Whether they're worth surviving here. Whether they're worth my recognition. There's no one more annoying than those who don't understand themselves."

Ainzhar chuckled.

"In that sense, you've passed with flying colors. Excellent!"

"Oh, thank you."

Taesan responded somewhat awkwardly to Ainzhar, who pointed a thumb at himself. It was confusing to see him so different from the image he had heard.

But thanks to this, he was able to sort things out to some extent.

Recognition of worth.

That was Ainzhar's criterion for evaluation. Itaeyeon didn't pass, but Taesan must have. The reason for the different attitudes must have been because of that.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"So, there should be no reason to be hostile towards him. Rather, you should treat him with kindness," Taesan, having finished confirming it, asked.

"You mentioned Ainzhar?"

Itaeyeon hadn't spoken to Ainzhar. Taesan also didn't know what kind of person Ainzhar was, or what his purpose was. He needed to gather information firsthand.

"Yes! It is the name bestowed upon me by my glorious father!"

"You mentioned seeking gods."

There were several gods in the labyrinth. However, most players didn't pay much attention to them.

The reason was simple.

They only existed in the alone mode.

Itaeyeon had said that various gods tested players and rewarded them. And he often complained about how terrible and dirty they were.

Since Taesan was usually the target, he knew many gods.

Even their information.

"May I ask what kind of god it is?"

"Sure! The more who know our god, the better!"

Ainzhar said cheerfully.

"The god I serve is the goddess I love. Revinenoflane!"

Taesan hesitated when he heard the name.

"Revinenof. Is that correct?"
Sure! Here's the translation of the text into English:

"Yeah! There's no way to get her name wrong! We all served Lady Revinenof!"

Ainzhar looked up at the ceiling with a dazed expression.

"We called out her name at the beginning and end of each day. She was a truly magnificent goddess who bestowed love upon her devotees. In my world, there was no goddess as beloved as her."

Ainzhar shrugged his shoulders.

"Unfortunately, since my world has perished, I'm the only one left who remembers her."

"...Are you here to find her?"

"Exactly. But I haven't even grasped a clue yet..."

Ainzhar shook his head sadly. Watching him appear melancholic, Taesan thought to himself.

'Revinenof.'

Taesan knew about her too. She was the goddess Itaeyeon had told him about. He also knew which floor she was on.

But there was one problem.

'It was said she was dead.'

The beautiful goddess had been torn apart gruesomely. Taesan remembered Itaeyeon's community post where he described it as disgusting.

If Itaeyeon, who had overcome countless hardships, spoke of it in such a way, it must have been truly dreadful.
When Taesan pondered over the truth, Ainzhar's eyes lit up.

"Taesan, may I ask you a question?"

"What is it?"

"Have you ever felt the need to rush down into the labyrinth, even for a moment?"

"No, not at all."

His goal was not to clear the labyrinth but to understand and strategize. He had no intention of leaving until he obtained all the rewards.

Ainzhar clapped his hands.

"That's good. Taesan, have you ever thought about learning Revinenof's techniques from me?"

* * *

"Sure."

Taesan responded promptly. His answer, without a hint of hesitation, caught Ainzhar off guard.

"...No hesitation at all. I thought you might hesitate a bit."

"There's no reason for me to refuse."

Ainzhar is formidable. He's such a powerful presence within the labyrinth's NPCs that it's impossible to understand. If he were outside, Taesan would not have survived.

Given such power offering skills, there was no reason to refuse. None at all.

"What's the cost?"

"Of course, there isn't one. It's my duty to make up for attacking you out of the blue."

"Apologize?"

"Exactly for attacking you suddenly."
"Ainzhar shook his head with an expression of embarrassment.

"Even though it was a test, I wielded violence against you, someone I just met. As a Paladin, I deeply regret what I did."

Taesan let out a bitter laugh at Ainzhar's sincerely apologetic expression.

"Well then, you could have just not attacked me in the first place."

"That's a different story," Ainzhar said shamelessly.

"I apologize to you because you are someone worth apologizing to. If not, I would have just spat and left."

Ainzhar had actually done that to Itaeyeon. He left her with a scornful glance.

"He's really crazy."

But to him, it was a good direction for a departure.

"A simple verbal apology is worthless. If you are an adventurer, I thought you'd want valuable skills, so I decided on this. Is that alright?"

"Of course, it's good."

One skill for one non-lethal attack. Compared to risking your life to get the skills, this is an easy task. Taesan was prepared to do it hundreds of times. As if he was relieved, Ainzhar wiped his chest.
"I'm really fortunate. I almost acted in a way that would have offended the gods."

His face genuinely expressed relief. Seeing that further complaints might provoke more criticism, Taesan was satisfied with the situation.

Unlike Itaeyeon, there was a strong possibility that he would continue to meet Ainzhar. He judged it advantageous to maintain a balanced relationship rather than risking damage by being greedy.
