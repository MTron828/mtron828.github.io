Chapter 589

589. Extra Story, Mashin (1)

"Did Mashin-nim call me?"

[That's right.]

"What's the reason?"

[You don't know yourself.]

"……Is that your story."

Taesan recalled his memories and looked at Baal.

"But why did you come?"

The conversation with Mashin. It had nothing to do with Baal. Baal chuckled.

[It seemed embarrassing to take the initiative himself.]

"Embarrassing?"

[I don't understand either. You're a child with a unique sensitivity, aren't you cute?]

Baal looked pleased.

As before, when he was related to Mashin, he had a rich sensitivity.

[So, what do you plan to do?]

"There's nothing else to do, so it's fine."

Taesan nodded. Baal extended his hand to Taesan.

[There's no reason to hesitate, so let's go.]

Taesan took Baal's hand.

And the space changed.

Taesan left the earth and arrived in a new realm.

A massive castle.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$A building that is so long and wide it's hard to see the end of the hallway.

Black gem decorations, pillars stretching up to the sky, and a high ceiling that looks fragile.

It was truly a giant castle.

And the owner of the castle was waiting.

A girl in black was sitting on a high throne, looking down at Taesan with her arms propped up.

Black hair flowing down to the floor.

Sharp, feline eyes.

A long black dress.

['Stay as you are.']

Taesan lightly bowed his body, reminiscing for a moment.

"Hello, Mara."

* * *

In the past, when Taesan first met Mara, he assumed a perfect posture of obedience.

He bowed his body and lowered his head.

But now, he no longer did. It was a very light bow, and Mara also had a face that considered it natural.

[It's been a while.]

"It's been a month, hasn't it. Time sure flies."

[Has it been that long? I thought it had been much longer since I was so busy.]

Mara leaned back on the throne with a tired face.

[At least some things have been sorted out.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Everyone lived happily after winning the war. There is no such ending. It took a considerable amount of time to clean up afterwards.

[All the transcenders worked together to tidy up the universe. It's hard to find any remaining traces of the divine punishment.]

"If you had told me, I would have helped."

[You've already helped enough.]

Masin smiled faintly.

[This is our business now. Taesan. It's already over anyway.]

"Congratulations."

[Thank you. Most of the cleanup is done. So... now I can indulge in my personal desires.]

Masin muttered to herself.

[It's a bit embarrassing, but I also want to show off quickly.]

After taking a deep breath, Masin spoke to Taesan.

[Taesan. Do you remember what I said when everything was ending?]

"I remember the story about you."

She had told Taesan about herself during the battle against the divine punishment. When everything was over, she wanted to tell Taesan about herself.

[Taesan. Who do you think I am?]

"Masin Lucifer, the goddess of magic and the mother of all demonkind."

[That's right.]

Masin nodded her head.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Then, Taesan, what kind of god am I like?]

"Hmm, isn't it like the concept of a god of death?"

A god who is the concept itself, a god of death, like Derasha, who has existed since the creation of the world, a solitary and complete god. An existence like that.

But Mashin shook his head.

[There are several gods who have existed since the creation of the world, like Derasha, but I don't fit into that category. Have you ever heard of a god of air or a god of iron? It's like that.]

Mashin was like a fundamental element that makes up the universe. There is no god who controls elements.

[Excluding those who have existed since the creation of the world, there are conceptual gods.]

A conceptual god is one who achieves something and reaches a certain level by doing so, dominating the concept itself.

The god of struggle and death lives on through struggle and death, dominating two concepts.

The god of victory lived a life of victory and succeeded, becoming the god of victory.

[But I'm not a conceptual god either.]

Mashin has never fought for the concept of Mashin.

[I'm a god of faith, formed by the collective faith of the Mashin tribe, a god of faith.]

Let me know if you'd like me to help with anything else!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Faith Gods. Many mortals send their faith, and when it accumulates to a certain level, they become Faith Gods. They might be the most numerous type of gods in the universe. I've seen many Faith Gods in the Tai Mountain.

However, there was a huge difference between them and the Demon Gods.

"You're strong, aren't you?"

[That's right.]

The Demon God affirmed.

Faith Gods are not ultimately strong on their own. Of course, individual abilities are also exceptional, and they can gain numerous faiths, but the fundamental power of Faith Gods is at the mortal level. They cannot be called gods. Their power is established through faith. As much as that, they are unstable. If their faith disappears, their authority as gods will collapse.

There is also a clear limit.

Of course, they have immense power, but they can never reach the level of Concept Gods.

It was an unbridgeable, absolute difference between those who rely solely on themselves and those who rely on others.

But the Demon God was not like that.

She was a Faith God, yet she was as strong as a Concept God. And she was not unstable. She had an extremely stable power."

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I am strong. Even the gods of intermediate concepts cannot reach me. I am not inferior to those who dominate the highest concepts. How is that possible?"

"Every demon worships you, after all."

"That's correct."

The demon god smiled faintly.

Every demon worships the demon god. There are hardly any demons who don't.

The demons of Begueseta. They were the demons who had occupied half of the world, but only fifty of them remained, and they were persecuted, dying in the forest, and even after countless prayers, the demon god did not respond, so they abandoned their faith in the demon god.

It meant that they had abandoned their faith in the demon god only in the most extreme circumstances.

"The demons that exist in this universe, from the moment they are born, worship and have faith in me. That faith is absolute."

The demon god smiled as if it was ridiculous.

"Isn't it ridiculous? It's absurd. If every human being in the universe, from the moment they are born, has absolute faith in someone, what would it be like?"

"That's... a terrifying thing."

One's own will doesn't matter. From the moment they are born, they are determined to worship someone. And that's true for every human being in the universe.

It's a kind of curse.

"I am a created god."

The demon god said quietly.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

[I'm the only one in the universe, a distorted existence. A tool for the demon tribe. What am I?]

The demon god gazed at Taesan.

His black eyes were fixed on Taesan.

[What would you think if you saw the birth of a being like me?]

"Do you want to show it to me?"

[I'm lonely, so I just want to show myself to someone. I hope it's you.]

There was a small sense of anxiety in the demon god's eyes.

[Will you accept it?]

"Yes."

Taesan nodded his head.

* * *

The demon god let out a sigh of relief.

[I'm glad. Honestly, I was worried you might refuse, saying it's troublesome.]

"I don't think that way. I've received a lot from you."

The demon god had given Taesan a lot of attention.

If you ask who the god who took care of him the most was, it would undoubtedly be the demon god.

"What's more, I'm curious too."

What kind of existence is the demon god? Where did it come from, and what is its origin?

Taesan was also curious about the distorted starting point of the demon god.

"What's more, there's nothing to do anyway."

[I'll just kill time somehow.]

Note: The text appears to be a dialogue between the demon god and Taesan, with the demon god being a mysterious and powerful being who is curious about its own existence and origin.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Mashin laughed with a "coo-coo" sound. Unlike before, he was overflowing with confidence, back to his usual self.

"So, how do you do it? Are you going to tell me, Mashin-nim?"

[No, I don't think it's that simple. I want you to see it for yourself, experience it, and feel it.]

Mashin stretched out his hand into the air.

And a powerful energy gathered.

Space and time twisted and condensed into a single shape. It was a small black stone.

Taesan scrunched up his face.

"……Uroboros's keystone?"

[It's a fake.]

Mashin spoke calmly.

[With Uroboros's corruption removed, it's become somewhat usable. Uroboros's keystone. It's just that I've brought out the fragment contained within.]

Mashin grasped the stone.

[But it's possible to return to a distorted form, at least.]

Without exerting any influence on the present world.

It's just a well-made fake, but...

It's still possible to return to the past.

[You'll be moving to a time when the universe wasn't like it is now, when it was ruled by the gods.]

"It seems like anything is possible."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Do you know how hard I worked to get this? It was as difficult as dealing with a divine retribution."

Mashin said with a playful tone.

"Of course, it's not something that can be maintained for a long time, just a fragment of a distorted parallel world. But... it's enough to see everything."

"What can I do there?"

"Whatever you want."

Mashin said, as if it was your choice.

"You can do as you please. I have no right or meaning to force anything on you. But if you ask me... just watch. From the beginning to the end."

"Is that your intention?"

Taesan nodded. Mashin snapped his fingers. A black stone slowly entered Taesan's palm.

[Uroboros's Fragment: Fragment] [A divine stone that governs the cycle of all things. That fragment.] [Only once. You can move to a broken past by distorting the flow of time. You can't stay there for long, and you can't gain anything.] [Go and see. And tell me your impression.]

Taesan nodded.

He left Mashin's realm. Baal was waiting for him.

"Did you accept?"

Note: Uroboros is a mythological symbol of a snake eating its own tail, often representing cycles and eternity.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"There's no reason to refuse, so..."

[If it becomes like that, I'll also see my past self. It's a strange feeling.]

Baal had a joyful expression. It was just as Baal said. He was a being similar to a god, existing since before the creation of the universe.

He must have existed even before the gods existed.

And the probability of him being involved with them is high.

"What did you wish for?"

Taesan asked Baal.

Baal had betrayed the gods.

By collaborating with the gods, he managed the demons and made contracts with the demon tribes.

When the gods became gods, Baal said he received a lot of help from them.

When asked about the reason, Baal told Taesan.

It was a simple, extremely personal reason.

He said that even beings like himself, who are similar to gods, cannot control their emotions as they please.

[What did I wish for? I can't answer that either. I don't even understand myself.]

Baal said with a sigh.

[The gods want you to understand yourself. That's... I suppose I'm the same, in a way.]

Note: The text appears to be a dialogue between Taesan and Baal, with some internal monologues and philosophical musings. The translation tries to preserve the nuances and tone of the original text.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

His finger points towards Taesan. Light enters him. Taesan does not refuse.

[If so, my past self will not recognize your distortion.]

"Is that so."

[Go and see. And tell me your thoughts once. About me, and that child.]

Taesan grips the stone with a powerful hand. The stone shatters. Along with the sound of breaking, the world begins to distort.

Note: Taesan appears to be a proper noun, possibly a name or a title, and I've left it untranslated. If you have more context or information about what Taesan refers to, I'd be happy to try and provide a more accurate translation.
