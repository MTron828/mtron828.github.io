Episode 89

89. 19th Floor, Masin. Lucifer (1)

Taesan first checked the helmet handed to him by Valoran.

[Helmet of Valoran] [Defense +22] [Action Speed +3%] [Helmet of a knight who was once great in life. Though the soul is tainted, the will imbued in the equipment remains.]

Action and movement speed bonuses are typically found on boots. Having them on a helmet meant it was a remarkably exceptional piece of gear.

It was equipment well worth having even without using any skills.

And just like when clearing the 10th floor, he gained numerous titles once again.
[Title: The Progressing One] [You have not only completely surpassed a certain number of floors in the labyrinth, but have also proven you can go even further.] [Strength + 15] [Intelligence + 15] [Agility + 15] 

[Title: The One Who Touched Perfection's Dust] [You have penetrated everything within the labyrinth. It's a modest achievement but clear progress.] [Strength + 18] [Intelligence + 18] [Agility + 18] [Rewards are enhanced upon clearing specific floors.]

[Title: The One Who Reached the Beginning of the Path] [You have begun to walk the path to prove yourself.] [Strength + 12] [Intelligence + 12] [Agility + 12] [Movement Speed + 4%] 

[Title: The One Who Succeeded in Challenge] [You have successfully faced meaningful challenges and further proven yourself.] [NPCs and gods favor you.] [Strength + 12] [Intelligence + 12] [Agility + 12]

Up to this point, the titles obtained upon clearing the 10th floor were similar, but now significantly enhanced. Additionally, there was a unique title obtained upon clearing the 20th floor.

[Title: The Accumulated] [You have accumulated sufficient strength. This is your proof.] [Mana + 21] [Agility + 16] [All skill proficiencies accelerate further.]

The title, "The Accumulated," evaluated all actions taken down to the 20th floor, providing a special ability.

For Taesan, it was an acceleration in skill proficiency. Since his main focus was skills, it was natural.

Though the acceleration was minimal and hard to notice, it would eventually make a significant difference as more were obtained one by one.

And he also gained another skill.

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Proof of Oneself] [What you have accumulated manifests and revolves around you.]

According to Itaeyeon, it was a skill that exerted a kind of intimidation.

The monsters he killed, the mental strength he gained descending the labyrinth, and his physical strengthâ€”all of these contributed.
Here is the translation of the text into English:

"All of that resided within his physical body, exerting a presence in all directions.

In reality, whenever he met Itaeyeon, there was always a subtle aura swirling around her.

It was a kind of power that made the weak tremble upon facing it. One could say it embodied a certain strength.

Having confirmed all clear rewards, Taesan now discovered a hidden reward.

The hidden reward was a pair of shoes.

[Shoes of Sharp Scars] [Attack + 4] [Defense + 14] [Agility + 10] [Movement Speed + 12%] [Action Speed + 6%] [Shoes with a dizzyingly distorted pattern. It seems like it would hurt a lot to kick someone with them.]

The defense and agility were exactly twice that of the shoes he currently wore.

They also boasted higher movement and action speeds, and even added to his attack power. There was no reason not to switch.

The hidden reward was a Rune of Strength. His strength increased by 20.

"Status Window."
Here is the translation of the text into English:

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 43] [Shield: 192/192] [Health: 2250/2250] [Mana: 514/514] [Strength: 765] [Intelligence: 533] [Agility: 688] [Attack + 83] [Defense + 115] [The target is in optimal condition.]

Once again, he had become tremendously stronger. Taesan smiled happily.

At this rate, he could catch up to Itaeyeon's previous stats before reaching the depths.

Taesan ascended the labyrinth once again to meet with Rilis. She was panting as she moved her belongings.

"You went down again?"

"I came up to the 20th floor."

"Oh..."

She looked at her belongings with a despairing expression.

"Why don't you just stay? It would be easier for me to come up."

"...No. I have things to receive; I can't be bothered."

She briefly frowned, but Rilis nodded. In her own way, it seemed like an expression of gratitude.

She roughly tidied her things and brightened her eyes.

"So, did you come here with an offering?"

Taesan nodded as he pulled out equipment obtained from defeating the liches one by one. Each time an item came out, Rilis exclaimed in admiration.

"Wow!"

"With this, maybe I can learn something too?"

"More than enough!"
Here is the English translation of the text:

She organized her equipment with a wide smile. As usual, she prayed and offered sacrifices to the gods.

"I'll teach you right away!"

"[You have learned Mid-Air Leap.] [Beginner Magic: Mid-Air Leap] [Mana Cost: 10] [Proficiency: 1%] [Leap into the air. Can only be used once at a time for now.]"

"Should I explain?"

"No."

Now that she had learned it, it would be most convenient to try it out herself. Taesan promptly slammed the ground.

Thunk.

His body soared into the sky. He ascended almost to the ceiling, then began to fall under the influence of gravity. When Taesan was about halfway down, he activated the skill.

"[You have activated Mid-Air Leap.]"

A foothold appeared beneath his feet. Taesan exerted force with his feet, stepping on the intangible foothold. His body soared into the sky once more.

Upon landing on the ground, Taesan realized.

"So, it's a double jump."

It was a skill frequently seen in games. By leaping in mid-air and jumping again, he could understand it immediately.

"It's a good magic."
Based on Taesan's experience, skills that could defy the laws of physics usually turned out to be winners. Being able to change direction mid-air was a significant advantage in both combat and movement.

"I wonder if it can be combined with the Big Leap?"

A skill that propelled the body greatly. Big Leap. Taesan wondered if it could be activated in conjunction with mid-air leap.

Naturally, his thoughts went in that direction.

"Let's check it out next time."

"Take care!"

After parting ways with Lillis, Taesan returned to the 20th floor. There was a room there that Taesan had intentionally avoided.

"[Death Knight has appeared.]"

Inside was a single Death Knight. Taesan stripped off all his equipment upon seeing it.

The ghost realized.

"[Are you trying to learn Nullify?]"

"Yeah, exactly."

"[...Is there more you want to learn?]"

"I'll figure that out."

From the 20th floor onwards, the levels were gradually similar, reaching a level where skills could be obtained. That's why he had intentionally left one room untouched.

Taesan used the fairy dust he had obtained as a reward.

Then he waited quietly for the attack.

The Death Knight thrust its sword.

"[Your first attack nullification has been activated.]"

Since nullification did not count as a judgment when obtaining it, all nullifications were used for the attack.
"[Your second attack nullification has been activated.]"

Two attacks were nullified, and Taesan tensed his muscles throughout his body. The Death Knight thrust its sword.

He minimized the damage by twisting his body to its limits.

"[You received 62 damage.]"

Taesan's shield was at 192. Simple calculation allowed up to four times.

Once again, he strained his body to its limits.

"[You received 61 damage.]"

And once more.

The Death Knight thrust its sword again. Taesan braced his body against the sword aimed at his side. A discomforting sensation accompanied the tearing of flesh.

"[You received 65 damage.] [Your health did not decrease on the third attack. You have acquired the special skill [Third Attack Absolute Nullification].]"

He narrowly managed to withstand the third attack. Taesan drew his sword and dispatched the Death Knight.

"As expected, it seems up to the third is possible."

"Yeah, indeed."

The ghost chuckled softly. It was a sight he had seen before, yet it was always an unbelievable sight.

"Wasn't this skill originally obtained in conjunction with the shield?"

"Yeah, seems like it."
Skill obtainable only by clearing the enhanced trials of Rakyiratas. Shield.

Since the shield does not rely on health checks, acquiring attack nullification was relatively easy. It seemed to be a skill obtainable through some kind of combination. Breaking through the enhanced trials yielded additional rewards, it seemed.

"I guess it's designed that way from the start."

However, since no one had cleared Rakyiratas' enhanced trials so far, it appeared to be unknown.

"Hmm. That makes sense then. It's not a skill one would normally acquire."

"Is that so?"

If that was the case, then who knows. Taesan had achieved it without anything at the end of effort.

However, the understanding was objectively going.


After forming a contract with the Ghost, Taesan never rested even for a single day. He descended into the labyrinth, sleeping minimally and pushing forward relentlessly.

If he were a normal human, burnout would have come long ago. Even without that, his mental resilience would have crumbled soon.

No matter how exceptional Taesan was, there would inevitably be limits. He needed moments of rest, devoid of any thought.

Taesan gave a perplexed look.

"Teach me swordsmanship."

"What?"

"Since we have a couple of days free, teach me swordsmanship during that time. I want to learn some theory now."

Until now, he had only used it alongside practical combat. He wanted to grasp the theoretical aspects more thoroughly.

"..."

The Ghost was at a loss for words. Taesan looked at the Ghost who was silent and asked,

"Aren't you going to teach me?"

"No, it's not that."

The Ghost let out a hollow laugh.

"This guy is really something strange."

---

The Ghost obediently taught him swordsmanship. Moving his body, he reacquainted himself with the principles and theories he had roughly grasped before.

For two days, they continued refining his physical abilities in this manner, significantly boosting his proficiency as a result.
[High-Level Skill: Storm Scar Sword] [Proficiency: 29%] [Swordsmanship passed down from a destroyed world. Currently, only one person has mastered it. It can be considered at the level of proficiency even for beginners.]

In just two days, he was able to raise it by a remarkable 5%. He also felt a corresponding improvement.

"Since it's a process of organizing what you've accumulated, it was easier to raise. It'll get a lot harder from here."

"Then that's enough."

Being a high-level skill, he didn't expect it to be easy to raise from the beginning. This level of progress was satisfying enough.

And now it was time to receive his reward.

Taesan went to find Hafran. Hafran, who had been hammering, opened his mouth when he saw him.

"You came at a good time. I just finished."

Hafran showed him a colorless spherical bead. Energy was swaying inside.

"I processed it into the simplest form. It'll be easier to use this way than in a unique form. The advantage of combining it enhances its strengths. Hand over your weapon."

Taesan obediently handed over his sword. Hafran struck the bead against the sword. As the bead shattered, the energy inside began to flow into the sword.

"Take it."

"Is that it?"

"Should I hammer something noisier, then?"
With a tired expression, Hafran handed it over. Taesan received it and checked.

[Artifact of Cabert: Sword Bathed in Ancestor's Blood] [Artifact of a world now destroyed. Claimed the lives of countless nobles.] [Attack Power +30] [When facing all enemies, Attack Power +15]

Taesan paused. The ghost, who had been watching with great interest, exclaimed in admiration.

"Was this level possible?"

"Because it enhances its advantages. It was easy to make since there's nothing special. Are you satisfied?"

Taesan nodded in approval. The enhancement surpassed his satisfaction.

The base attack power increased by 10. Moreover, the attack power that rose when facing noble bloodlines increased from 10 to 15, and it changed to apply when facing all enemies.

Considering that there were practically no opponents with noble bloodlines, this meant an increase in attack power by 25.

It was a change beyond what Taesan had expected. With a weapon like this, he could use it until he truly delved deep. Taesan expressed his gratitude.

"Thank you."

"It's a deal. There's no need to thank me."

Hafran clapped his hands together.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The next visit will be after you have become sufficiently strong. The world will be watching you, so it will be much harder next time."

He knew that part well. The hostility directed towards him before his return was endlessly eerie.

"If you have any materials or the like, bring them even if not really necessary. Don't bother with trivial things."

"Do I have to keep going up to the 15th floor?"

If Hafran stayed here, he might have to go down to the depths and then climb back up to the 15th floor again.

"Normally, yes. But since you're different from the others, I guess I'll have to make some effort."

Hafran shook his hammer.

"Let's go down every five floors. It's a hassle to carry more than that."

"That works."

Reduce the hassle a bit.

Finally done, Taesan bid farewell to Hafran and descended back to the 19th floor.

Taesan placed his hand on the altar of the mage.

Magic pours out.

Thick, black mist fills the room.

Within it, a gaze is felt.

Curiosity.

Irritation.

And other various emotions could be felt in that gaze. Taesan waited quietly. Eventually, a system window appeared.

"Lucifer invites you to his realm."
