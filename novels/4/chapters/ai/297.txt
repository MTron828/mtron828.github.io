Chapter 298

298. The Green Witch (3)

"The immortal ones want to kill you because you possess a possibility that they cannot have. In other words, it's because they have given up. But... I'm not."

The witch smiled bitterly.

"I haven't given up yet."

Suddenly.

The whip, which was wrapped around the mountain's arm, slowly approached the witch.

The witch, who was drinking tea, laughed at the whip and said, "Come here."

The whip slapped the witch's body. It was like the movement of a child who had been separated from their parents for a long time.

"That child sold it to you. It's a nostalgic thing."

"Are you talking about the shop owner?"

"The Dwarf King. He lost everything but couldn't recover it, so he made a contract with the wizard. A pitiful child."

The witch who was stroking the whip got up from her seat.

"Let's rest for now. I'll tell you the details later."

Here is the translation of the text:

Tai Shan gazed at the sea of trees. This place, where various plants grew and moved, had a similar feeling to the mystical forest that lived on the 51st floor.

[The weeds that swayed and trembled] [It had a strong and unyielding power that could shake the earth. However, it was difficult to harmonize, and it could only be controlled under specific conditions.]

Tai Shan could see a lot of information from the plants around him. And this information was something he had seen before.

‘Alchemy.’

The power that the 51st floor goblin had mastered and taught him, a power different from magic.

Most of what was here was similar to that.

Alchemy was indeed useful, but it had a condition that had to be set up beforehand. Therefore, it was practically impossible to use it when he was not on earth.

Could he raise his proficiency to the level where he could use it even in the labyrinth? Tai Shan touched the leaves of the tree.

"How is it?"

A witch who had appeared behind Tai Shan's back suddenly asked.

"This place is my own domain. My world."

"It's enormous, and powerful too."

Tai Shan pulled his hand back from the leaves. It was not an empty boast. This forest was stronger than any world Tai Shan had seen before.
Here is the translation of the text:

The creator of the world itself. That is the eternal one.

It was truly the feat of the gods.

The mortal was not even worthy of looking at it, yet the witch had an unsatisfactory expression.

"'I invested time that cannot be measured to create my proud world. But you, who are receiving the attention of the gods, should know it.'"

The witch smiled wryly.

"Is my domain different from theirs?"

The Taesan nodded silently.

Eternal being. The existence that governs its own domain.

Their domain was complete in itself. No one could reach it, nor could they intervene, and it was governed by the absolute laws of the gods.

The Taesan, who had been invited to many of the gods' domains, knew.

Their domain was a single universe in itself.

It was a region that ran solely by their laws and rules.

In contrast, the witch's domain was undoubtedly strong, but it was a simple and imperfect world. It was incomplete, and there was no concept of law that governed it, making it a ordinary world.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Transcendents do not govern themselves, and their domain does not exist. They are absolute within their own domain, just like the absolute.

The witch knelt down and scraped the ground. The weeds obeyed her will and began to move down.

"Unlike the Immortals, I only surpassed the mortal realm. That's all. I didn't get to see a higher world."

The witch muttered to herself.

"What's the difference between me and them? What makes them Transcendents, and what keeps me a Mortal?"

The witch quietly muttered to herself, looking at the Taishan.

"I came here to make a deal with the magician to learn that."

The Taishan saw the Immortal. The odd, twisted being was consumed by jealousy, unable to become a Transcendent and seeking to kill mortals who had the potential to become Transcendents.

The witch was different. She wanted to leave her position as an Immortal and become a Transcendent.

"Can you tell me about that?"

The method of becoming a Transcendent.

The Taishan shook his head. He didn't know such a thing.

"I don't know."

"No, you do know."

The witch said, her tone full of conviction.
Here is the translation of the text:

"If it can't be done, I've made it impossible for you to enter this place. Even if you don't know it yourself, what you've accumulated will be the answer to that."

A witch who had appeared waved her staff. The forest began to shake and tremble.

The world itself began to move within her palm.

Even if she wasn't an immortal, she remained an independent immortal.

"So, let's make a deal. You're a remarkable one."

She smiled broadly as she turned her back on the shaking world.

"You'll show me what I want. In return, I'll give you what you're expecting."

[Sub-quest starts] [The green witch who has become immortal wants to have her own domain. She hopes you can tell her how to do it.] [Quest condition: The starting point for becoming immortal] [Reward: The witch's magic.]

"Will you accept?"

The mountainous figure nodded silently at the witch's calm smile.

[Sub-quest starts]

"Thank you."

"It seems you don't have the power of refusal."

If he refuses, she made a gesture to force him to accept. The witch laughed merrily.

"I'm sorry. But I'm also inevitable."

She clapped her hands.
(Note: Please note that this is a translation of a fantasy story and some parts may seem unusual or unrealistic.)
Here is the translation of the text:

"Alright, let's start then."

* * *

[So you've come to me for that reason?]

"If you're willing, you can have a decent fight with this child."

The giant by the lake said with a grin.

[I'll follow your lord's command. So if that's the case, shall we fight like this?]

"Yes. Fight hard. With the determination to kill each other."

The witch began to watch casually, spacing herself out.

"I said that, but I'm also an immortal and a transcendent being. I don't know what the standard is that separates the two."

"So I'll check it out, I suppose."

"That's right. The battlefield is a very simple yardstick."

[Umm... Is that what the lord meant?]

The giant by the lake gathered his strength. The Tai Shan wielded his sword.

Hoo!

The strength exploded.

The giant by the lake was really determined to kill Tai Shan. Tai Shan also began to take the giant seriously.

And the witch watched the scene with a blank expression.

'As expected, he's strong.'
Note: The translation may not be perfect, but I've tried my best to convey the meaning of the text.
Here is the translation of the text:

She was amazed in silence. Although she had not ventured out of her own domain, she had multiple eyes and ears, so she knew the entire story within the labyrinth.

Therefore, she was also aware of the adventurer, Taesan, who was of great interest to the gods.

The arrogant and proud gods had taken a direct interest in this adventurer.

And the immortal beings hated him and wanted to kill him.

She was fascinated by his strength and power. And when she directly witnessed Taesan's power, she was amazed.

The giant of the lake, who she was currently dealing with, was one of the strongest among the mortal beings, created by her own efforts.

This kind of existence was something that an adventurer who had not yet reached the depths of the labyrinth could not easily deal with.

"'The level of interest of the gods is overwhelming,'"

But it's still lacking.

It's definitely remarkable, but it's not up to the level of the witch's expectations.

What she wants is the power to transcend. She had possessed such power during her mortal days.

However, she was unable to transcend. With just this level of power, she could accomplish nothing.

'Is it a problem of a different kind, not related to power?'
Here is the translation of the text:

At that moment, she was about to take her seat in the mysterious realm. According to the contract, she said to the magician, "When an adventurer who can provide the starting point for going beyond the limits comes, please invite them to my territory."

The magician agreed.

Thus, the witch and the magician made a contract.

However, it was a story that was getting close to impossible. It was a law that was unknown to anyone, that an immortal could become a transcendental being. If it were that simple, there would have been no reason for countless immortals to be jealous.

The witch also knew this fact well.

Despite this, she made the contract because of a glimmer of hope.

The witch was initially thinking of stopping the fight. It was a moment when she wanted to grasp the power of the Taesan in a different way, not through battle.

The giant of the lake suddenly unleashed its power.

[Block this too!]

A whirlpool of swirling water. A blow that crushes mountains and cuts across the sea.

The Taesan opened its mouth towards the whirlpool.

"Scattered."

Pffft!

The whirlpool exploded and the water scattered in all directions. The giant was shocked, and the witch's eyes widened.

"What's the spell?"

The power shown by the Taesan was a power that she also knew.

A power that could affect the physical world through mere willpower.
Here is the translation of the text:

The transmigrators, who were beyond the realm of transmigration, were the only ones who could obtain such power.

"How?"

The question was asked.

And curiosity arose.

If I, as a transmigrator, had obtained the decree, maybe it was indeed.

The witch's excitement subsided, and she shook her staff. The giant of the lake sank down with a loud noise.

"[Master, Master?]"

"'Here, that's all.'"

The witch, who had stopped fighting, looked at the Taesan.

The witch looked up at Taesan with a curious expression.

"What did you mean by 'ascension of the mysterious power'?"

Taesan explained.

"Ascension of the mysterious power?"

The witch was puzzled.

"What kind of skill is that?"

"I don't know the details myself."

It was a skill obtained during the previous life, when I fought against S-grade opponents. Its effects were undoubtedly astonishing. Even against a powerful monster, Taesan was able to obtain many things.

However, it was too extraordinary, and I didn't know where it came from or what its limitations were. That was the whole story.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Do you not know what the witch doesn't know?"

She was an immortal. And Taesan was a mortal. The other gods who met Taesan were aware of the power he possessed, but the witch seemed to be unaware of what he actually had.

"I'm an immortal."

The witch spoke calmly.

"Of course, I'm powerful and immortal, but that's all. You can grasp the general power you possess, but you can't know everything like the transcendent beings. It's really a pitiful place."

The witch smiled wryly.

"So I'll check it one by one. Let's do it again."

Taesan continued to use incantations as the witch said.

He used them in various conditions, continuously observing the intensity and the extent of their influence.

"Stop it. Kneel down."

The green witch activated the declaration of submission.

The declaration, filled with willpower, was about to crush Taesan. Her knees were forced to bend, and she was about to surrender to the witch from deep within her heart.

But Taesan gathered his willpower and shouted:

"No."

[You have activated the declaration of denial.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The will to crush Taesan has vanished.

Taesan pressed against my forehead. It was painful, but I could endure it.

[The mage's proficiency level increased by 1%.]

"Is it the declaration of the mortal to resist?"

The witch's face was filled with awe.

"Amazing."

"Is it really that extraordinary?"

"It's extraordinary. The fact that it has transcended the boundaries of mortality means that it exists in a completely different realm from the mortal. For example, if you try to kill an ant trapped in a cup, can the ant resist?"

It's impossible. Humans can crush the cup, and the ant will do nothing and die.

There was a difference in power between the mortal and the existence that had transcended mortality.

"What you've done now is similar to that."

As an ant trapped in a cup, I have endured and withstood human malice.

The declaration of the existence that has transcended mortality is meant to convey that meaning.

"Do you have a headache every time you handle the declaration?"

The witch, who had been thinking for a moment, said.
Here is the translation of the text:

"It seems that the power contained in the grade is not enough to deal with it, so it will be like that. The grade will decrease as it rises, but it's hard to completely solve it. Since the power of dependence is a force that can only be handled by transcending mortality, it's absurd to say that a mortal has mastered it.

But Tai San was actually handling the command.

The witch thought quietly.

'Is it a rise to the spirit rank?'

Tai San obtained the command because he had risen to the spirit rank to counter the world and acquired a conceptual skill. The witch listened to Tai San's story and also understood the rise to the spirit rank.

And the more she discovered, the more she was amazed.

The rise to the spirit rank seizes the power contained in the soul. That's not particularly remarkable. It's not rare for someone to kill an opponent and take their power.

However, the seizure of power has its own limitations. Even if someone is extremely powerful, it's rare for them to seize the power of someone stronger than themselves.

On the other hand, the rise to the spirit rank has no limitations.

Even those who have reached the brink of mortality, or monsters who want to destroy the world as tools of the gods, or even the world's own will.

It seized power without exception.

"What's this?"

Even a witch who has lived for a long time couldn't understand this power."
Here is the translation of the text:

I had seen the monster that was within my domain brought out and use the "Eternal Mountain" to ascend to a higher realm, but I still couldn't understand the flow of power.

I, who was immortal, couldn't understand the skills possessed by mortals.

And it didn't end there. The witch's pupils expanded as she touched the gray power that the Eternal Mountain was handling.

The Eternal Mountain roughly swung the gray power. Part of the forest was crushed and disappeared.

Kuku, kuku, kuku...

The power contained within was something that surpassed the power of mortals.

The witch asked in a trembling voice:

"What is that?"

"I don't know."

The Eternal Mountain said, shrugging his shoulders, and only knew that the gods were also unable to answer about the gray power. They didn't know what kind of power it was or what kind of effect it would have.

"...Amazing."

Her eyebrows twitched with surprise.

She couldn't understand the power.

These things were the starting point for transcending the path.

The witch smiled.

"Is this place really the correct one?"

I had searched for thousands, tens of thousands of years, and even more. I had to escape mortality and embark on the path of transcendence.

The half-forgotten path was finally taking shape.

The witch calmed down and said:

"Let's keep checking."
