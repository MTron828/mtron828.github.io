Chapter 209

209. On the 51st floor, the mysterious beings are living in a forest (6)

Tai Shan moved his wings.

His body felt a strange sensation, and he was lifted a little into the air. Before he could fly off the cliff, he needed to get used to the new sensation. Tai Shan moved his body slightly with his wings.

"I'm not flying by flapping my arms."

The wings were a kind of power source. By focusing his mind on the wings and willing them to move, he could fly through the air.

"It's complicated."

Tai Shan controlled the wings and flew through the air. However, his movements were awkward. It was as if he was about to fall off the bike like a child learning to ride for the first time, and he felt anxious.

[It's because of the fairy's power. It's different from magic or black magic. It's a power that humans are never allowed to have, so it's hard to adapt.]

Tai Shan added strength to his wings.

Suddenly, his body accelerated forward. As he tried to rush towards the wall with the movement of the wings, Tai Shan hastily planted his feet on the ground.

His body collided with the ground and slid. Tai Shan, who had barely landed, smiled.
Here is the translation of the text:

"The skill can't be used."

I tried to activate it, but it didn't work, so I had to move my feet directly. If I did that, there was a possibility that the counterattack would also fail to activate.

"I need to adapt a bit."

Tae-san continued to handle the wings.

After repeated practice, I realized that the wings were similar to a sports car.

If I moved slowly and carefully, it wasn't difficult to control. However, the moment I tried to accelerate to a certain speed, I suddenly accelerated and it became hard to control.

The problem was the sudden change in speed.

[You have accelerated your mind.]

I move the wings again. The accelerated mind makes the movement of objects seem slow.

When the wing tries to accelerate beyond a certain speed, Tae-san concentrated his mind.

Paang!

The direction changes. I continue to concentrate my mind and try to adjust the direction.

I head straight ahead, but before hitting the wall, I turn left. Then, before hitting the left wall, I turn left again.

Tae-san, who had repeated the movements, returned to his original position.

"This should be enough, right?"
Here is the translation of the text:

It wasn't satisfactory, but it seemed sufficient to pass the current quest.

Tae-san spread his wings towards the endless abyss.

Ku-uuu!

His body soared into the sky.

It wasn't a leap or a jump in mid-air. He was literally flying through the sky right now.

Pulu-pulu!

He accelerated his wings. The distant destination was getting closer.

Just as the destination came into view, Tae-san put his strength into his wings.

Pa-aa!

Suddenly, his body stopped and the air exploded.

[First Quest Complete.] [Second Quest.] [Use the fairy's wings to cross the abyss and arrive at the next location.]

And then, another abyss unfolded before Tae-san.

And there were several walls built to avoid them.

The hidden room on the 51st floor, created by the dragon who possessed mysterious powers, gave visitors the wings of the fairies.

However, to obtain the wings of the fairies, one had to pass the quests, which were step-by-step. The more quests one cleared, the more exceptional wings one could obtain.

"'Tae-yun has already cleared the third stage, didn't he?'"
Here is the translation of the text:

She judged that it was impossible to go beyond that point and stopped there. The wings obtained by Taesan had no distance limit for flying and could only be sustained for one hour.

It was barely enough even for the third stage.

Taesan slammed into the ground.

As Taesan spread his wings, he flew towards the precipice.

Just as he was about to hit the obstacle in front of him, he changed direction and flew past it. However, another obstacle appeared on the other side of the wall.

Taesan quickly controlled his wings and descended to the ground.

Then, he sprang up and landed at the next destination.

"This isn't so hard, is it?"

[Taesan passed the second quest. Third quest. Please use the fairy's wings to fly over the precipice to the next point.]

Taesan saw the next precipice.

There was nothing there. It looked like he could fly over it and reach the next point just like the first precipice.

But it wasn't that easy. Taesan focused his mind and slammed into the ground.

No way.

Taesan spread his wings and flew rapidly towards the next point.

As Taesan flew, something flew towards him. Taesan twisted his body narrowly.

"Arrow?"

It was also an arrow that Taesan couldn't avoid, moving at an incredibly fast speed.

Pa-pa-pa!
Here is the translation of the text:

As the air crackled and several arrows flew out simultaneously, Tai Shan quickly changed direction. Then, another arrow flew towards him in the direction he had moved, and he dodged it again. He realized that arrows were flying towards him every time he moved.

So, he had to keep changing direction to avoid the arrows and reach his destination.

"Ah, it's tough."

Tai Shan focused his mind. His wings were like a supercar that accelerated when it exceeded a certain speed. It was hard to control.

Tai Shan was thinking of using that.

Paaang!

His wings suddenly unfolded, and his body accelerated forward. And then, an arrow flew towards Tai Shan, who was accelerating.

Tai Shan dodged upwards.

And just before he hit the ceiling, he sprinted forward.

Pababak!

Tai Shan dodged to the left, like a jet plane, as another arrow flew towards him.

He moved forward in a straight line, accelerating explosively, without controlling his speed, and dodging to the side. This was his choice, and it worked well. The arrows that flew towards Tai Shan failed to hit him and vanished on the other side.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Blame."

Tae-san has arrived at the destination.

[Completed the third quest.] [The fourth quest.] [Use the fairy's wings to cross the precipice and arrive at the next location.]

Tae-san looked at the precipice in front of him.

Just like the previous precipice, there was nothing.

But since I've come this far, I know what's going on. There's an unseen danger.

Tae-san gave up here.

She almost died at the third precipice, and she narrowly survived. Therefore, she judged that this was too much for herself.

She thought about figuring out whether it was real or not.

She's flying towards the precipice. The moment she lifted her feet off the ground, a loud sound echoed from behind.

It was a sound that was getting closer and closer.

Tae-san's eyes widened.

"Damn it."

Ku-uuu!

She's accelerating. A creepy feeling is chasing her at a rapid pace from behind.

She glanced back quickly.

A massive wall was chasing after Tae-san, as if it was going to crush her.

Kwa-kuu!
Here is the translation of the text:

And then giant boulders began to fly towards them, drawing curves in the air. The arrows also got tangled between them, aiming at Taesan.

"Well chosen!"

If Itaewon had been greedy, she would have died here.

Taesan moved her body. She avoided the projectiles like the third quest, but the movement was interrupted, and the wall was approaching her quickly.

She had to minimize the loss of movement.

Taesan perceived the trajectory and number of incoming projectiles and accelerated. She ran quickly straight ahead, not to the left or right.

Phew!

She narrowly avoided the flying boulders. When it seemed impossible to avoid them, she raised her arms to defend herself.

Whoosh!

[You took 2503 damage.]

The skill itself was sealed in this area, so the attack was ineffective.

She minimized the damage and advanced, getting more skilled in her wing movement.

Pfft!

She dodged the boulders that were flying towards her all at once.

The approaching wall was about to cling to her back.

The wing gave her a strength that seemed to tear. She accelerated to a speed that the incoming projectiles couldn't catch up to, and landed safely at the destination.
Here is the translation of the text:

"Acknowledged."

[Fourth quest completed.] [Fifth quest.] [Use the fairy's wings to defeat the enemy on the cliff.]

The Great Mountain shook its arms. Although it took a little damage, it was not severe.

As instructed, there was a small dragon that could fly in the air above the cliff.

The Great Mountain immediately landed on the ground.

The dragon rushed towards it with a roar and a scream.

[Ahhh!]

Kaaaang!

The dragon was not very strong. Even an average 51st-floor adventurer might not have seen it as a threat to the Great Mountain.

It seemed that the Great Mountain had adapted to the wing's movements to defeat the enemy, which was the intended meaning.

The Great Mountain followed this intention. Instead of immediately defeating the dragon, it became more familiar with the wing's movements. As the battle continued, the Great Mountain's movements became smoother.

Pow!

The Great Mountain judged that there was nothing more to be obtained and defeated the dragon.

[Quest completed.] [You have obtained the special skill [Perfect Fairy's Wings].]

After landing on the ground, the Great Mountain checked the skill.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

[Skill: Wing of the Perfect Fairy] [Mana consumption: 50] [Proficiency: 15%] [The Wing of the Perfect Fairy can be used at will by the user, with no limitations on distance or time. It seems that only linear movement is possible for now.]

"Ah!"

A smile appeared on the face of the Great Mountain.

I thought it might be, but after clearing the 5th level, I actually got a wing that has no limitations on distance or time.

My proficiency increased as I cleared the quest, so when I obtained it, my proficiency was already high.

As I increase my proficiency, my wing movements become increasingly free, and eventually, I can move freely like Itealyen said.

The Great Mountain, satisfied with the reward, stepped out.

[You have activated the Wing of the Perfect Fairy.]

The wing unfolded.

The Great Mountain crossed the forest as is. It was slightly slower than running, but there was no significant difference.

Now, all that's left is to find the Unicorn.

The Great Mountain began to look around the entire forest.

* * *

As the Gremelin said, the Unicorn was not easily visible.

After almost two days of wandering through the forest, I still couldn't find its location. I judged that the final quest would be difficult, so the Great Mountain silently continued to search the forest.

And after another day, I was able to find the Unicorn with great difficulty.
Here is the translation of the text:

The small spring of blue light. A white-horned unicorn was drinking water there.

[Unicorn appeared.]

The unicorn, who had been drinking water for a moment, suddenly raised its head and looked exactly at the place where Tai Shan was.

[Hih!]

The unicorn let out a cry and began to run away. Tai Shan's face scrunched up at the sight of the unicorn disappearing quickly.

"What's going on?"

It was different from the story.

Since it couldn't be overlooked, Tai Shan began to chase after it quickly.

[Hih hih hih!]

The unicorn let out a cry. At the same time, a light rain began to fall from the sky, accompanied by the white light from its horn.

Tai Shan activated the white rune shield to block and followed behind.

"Are you running away?"

[Why run away? You thought you could be caught quietly?]

"I heard it that way."

Iteyan said that the unicorn was the easiest to catch. Since it appeared in front of itself and didn't run away, but instead kept showing its figure around, it was quickly caught.

However, the unicorn that appeared in front of Tai Shan now seemed to have no intention of being caught.

[Hih hih!]

It was actually mocking the one following behind.

[Ah... That's it.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The ghost spoke with a eerie tone.

"That's because he's a unicorn, isn't it?"

The mountain laughed loudly.

"What's going on?"

"If it's not that kind of case, it would be hard. I spent a whole week just trying to catch it."

It seems that it won't be easy to catch it, but it doesn't matter.

"You have activated Mephisto's black lightning."

Kururin!

The lightning strikes the unicorn. The unicorn's body suddenly freezes.

"Hih, hihin!"

The unicorn lets out a scream and swings its horn. The energy from the horn wraps around the mountain's body.

"You are slowed down. All your movements become slower."

"You have activated the adventurer's determination."

The abnormal state is cleared, and you rush towards the unicorn. The unicorn is startled and speeds up even more.

"You have activated Dekarabia's twisted vegetation."

Kururin!

The roots rise up and advance. The unicorn starts to block the way.

The unicorn receives the horn and creates a path while wailing.

"Hih, hihin!"
Here is the translation of the text:

The cries of the forest spread throughout the entire forest. Soon, the trees began to stir and rise, blocking the path ahead.

Tai Shan was carelessly strolling.

[You have activated the forced duel.]

Tuderudong!

The trees that were blocking the way collided with Tai Shan and bounced off.

[You have activated the deer walking on wind.]

[You have activated the small spark.]

The wind carried the flames and spread them in all directions.

The forest is burning, and the unicorn's hiding place is gradually disappearing. The unicorn lets out a scream and pounds the ground.

[Hehehe!]

The unicorn, which has risen high into the sky, looks down at the ground with a seemingly carefree smile, as if knowing that Tai Shan, a human, will not be able to reach it.

[You have activated the perfect fairy's wings.]

Whoosh! The wings unfold behind Tai Shan's back.

It charges straight towards the sky. The unicorn's appearance causes it to jump back in surprise, and Tai Shan also starts to chase after it, controlling the wings.

[You have activated the acceleration.]

The body accelerates again from the sky.
Here is the translation of the text:

The Unicorn's speed increased even more, but it was getting closer and closer. It seemed to have realized it couldn't escape, so the Unicorn suddenly began to move its body freely in the air, as if it had broken free from the straight line of movement. Since I couldn't catch up with it, I had to let it go.

[Heh heh!]

Then the Unicorn laughed at me again. I remained expressionless and activated my skill.

[You have activated the spread of ice beads.] [You have activated the icy arrow.] [You have activated the pursuit.]

Countless ice arrows and ice beads shot towards the Unicorn at once.

The Unicorn, who was laughing, suddenly panicked and tried to dodge. However, since I had to dodge two attacks from the Unicorn and myself at the same time, my movement became increasingly awkward.

And the Unicorn's position arrived at the place I wanted.

I didn't miss the moment.

[You have activated a random blink.]

I moved above the Unicorn.

I chased after the Unicorn in mid-air and branded it. I forced the Unicorn to move to that place, making it go there.

I grabbed the Unicorn's neck.

The Unicorn panicked and tried to escape, but I stepped on it and crushed it.

Kwaaaang!

The ground shook and a crater was formed.

I finished with a final blow.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"You have defeated the unicorn. Your level has risen. The ascension of the divine has been triggered. You have obtained the white horn of the unicorn. Quest completed. If you return to Gremelin, he will tell you the way to the 52nd floor and reward you."
