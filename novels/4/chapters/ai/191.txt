Chapter 192

192. 41st floor. The Great Madness of Pursuing Great Spirits (1)

In a place where the leaders of the guidance were gathered, a murmuring sound echoed. They were whispering to each other.

"It's finally over."

"Although it's an unexpected outcome, it's a pity."

They didn't seem to be greatly perturbed. Quanede's strength was undoubtedly impressive, but the power that had been vaguely visible until now was not to be underestimated. They had expected that the probability of defeat would be higher than that of victory.

And there was another reason why they weren't greatly perturbed.

The Spirit King said:

"Even so, that power belongs to us. Then it doesn't matter."

Petrice's contract. The spirit and power of Quanede's soul, which was sealed in the contract, returned to them. Their gaze fell on the girl with a jet-black hair.

"You received what you agreed to. Sis."

"Yes."

Sis said in a flat tone. The Spirit King smiled and asked:

"What's the feeling? Receiving the power of others?"
Here is the translation of the text:

It was the first time for them to make a contract to transfer soul and power. Although they asked with curiosity, Sosie still remained expressionless.

"I don't know. I didn't receive it."

"What?"

The face of the Spirit King shook for the first time.

"...According to the contract, you didn't receive that power, did you?"

"I did receive it."

Sosie's eyelids narrowed.

"But I didn't receive anything. Neither soul nor power nor anything else came to me."

"What's the matter?"

The atmosphere suddenly became tense.

"Is Conrade dead?"

"Yes. The life-connected gem shattered. His body has met death."

An old man holding a staff made of ancient wood spoke in a stern voice. As the holder of the title of Great Mage, he was the creator of the life-connected gem that linked the lives of those above and below.

"There's no way to deceive it..."

"It's impossible, exactly."

"What do you mean?"

"You can just go through the labyrinth."

The old man struck the staff against the ground.

"The life gem only works inside the labyrinth. Once you go out, the life gem's flame will automatically extinguish. But as long as Petricia's contract exists, you can't leave the labyrinth."

Note: Conrade is likely a character mentioned earlier in the story, and Petricia's contract is the mysterious contract mentioned in the first sentence.
Here is the translation of the text:

"There's no way to break it, I suppose."

The immortal's contract. To break it, that's impossible, at least from their perspective.

"Then...?"

"Queen is dead."

"Did that power not return to us?"

Silence descended along with the conclusion.

"I'd better confirm it. Call Petricia. The great mage."

"Ugh. I don't want to be the target of anger."

The great mage arrived, her face distorted, and began drawing a line on the ground with her staff. Soon, the magic circle was complete, and the great mage shook her robe.

"Everyone, get your heads down. Don't want to burst."

They crouched down.

The great mage struck the magic circle with her staff, muttering something.

And power surged forth.

A massive and terrifying power. The kind of power that made them look like insects, even among the immortal.

The great mage shouted.

"Surge forth! Petricia! A being who has escaped the position of the immortal!"

Ku-ku-ung!

Instantly, a tremendous pressure crushed them, and silence descended.

[What's this?]
Here is the translation of the text:

His voice, filled with irritation, rang out. The great wizard bowed deeply.

"I pay my respects to a great existence, though my body is humble!"

The great wizard swallowed his saliva. His expression showed he was not pleased. If he were to provoke the immortal at this time, even something insignificant could enrage him, so he had to be cautious.

He carefully asked, "Immortal, may I ask one question?"

"What is it?"

"We have offered sacrifices and made a deal with Lady Petricia."

The sacrifices they offered were not insignificant. Even those who dwelled deep within the earth held the sacrifices in high esteem.

"But the power has not returned to us. May I ask what happened to the contract?"

...

The immortal remained silent. The great wizard sat in silence, his head bowed.

Only after a long time did the immortal speak.

"[I will not accept any future contracts with that person.]"

"Yes?"

The great wizard's head jerked up in surprise at the unexpected response. Lady Petricia said with a face filled with irritation:

"Are you questioning my decision?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Ah, no."

[You should know that. From now on, if something related to that guy appears in the contract I'm writing, you'd better be prepared.]

"I, then, would say that our offering is......"

[Can I ask you to return the offering I have given you?]

Petria's voice trembled with anger. The mage was taken aback by the oppression and power, and shouted loudly.

"No! The offering belongs to Lady Petria!"

[Be careful. Those kind of people are like insects. You can crush them whenever you want.]

Petria left, her words laced with anger.

The mage wiped the sweat from his brow and stood up.

"Those eternal ones are really frustrating. I don't want to deal with them."

"...The contract hasn't been fulfilled."

The eternal ones had no reason to be so frustrated. In the end, they had to make the offering as planned, but failed to achieve their goals.

"It's troublesome."

A man who had been silent until then spoke up. He was the same man who had made the decision to bring Quaneed.

"The only certain thing is that the contract has been broken, and it's possible that that guy has received all the power."

Note: Quaneed is likely a character in the story, but I couldn't find any information about it, so I left it as is.
Here is the translation of the text:

They had made a deal with Petricia with the intention of obtaining Quan's power, but there was also a reason to prevent Taesan from getting anything. However, all their plans were shattered.

"What kind of people are there in the 5th floor?"

"Uh... nothing special. Just ordinary people."

Their eyes fell as they heard that they couldn't stop Taesan.

The man said, "Find a way. We have to kill that guy somehow."

Since Quan was dead, they no longer had any room for flexibility.

They began to move with serious faces.

Regardless of what they did, Taesan arrived at the 41st floor with a calm face.

The outer wall of the 41st floor was worn out and crumbling.

Dust piled up, as if no human hands had touched it. Even the floor, which was not the wall, was the same, causing dust to fly up every time they took a step.

There was a store owner there.

"Did you come?"

"Yes."

"Are you going to buy something this time?"

Taesan nodded his head.

The store owner smiled.

"How much is it?"

"It's around thirty thousand."
Here is the translation of the text:

While selling the materials with enthusiasm, I managed to collect around 270,000 gold coins and came down. The shop owner blew a whistle.

"There are many, aren't there? There are still those who haven't reached the depths yet, and they're like that. Can't I buy two more at this price?"

"Let me see."

The shop owner opened the space as if waiting for this moment and poured out one by one.

At a glance, it was clear that these were not ordinary equipment.

"Those that are decent, take your time to inspect them."

"I'll take a look."

The mountain smiled and began to inspect the items.

[The Executioner's Axe] [Axe that has beheaded tens of thousands of people. Among the victims were a great wizard, a king who was greater than anyone, and a sage who understood all things.] [Attack power + 130] [When fighting enemies with noble blood, attack power + 30] [300,000G]

"Ah."

The performance of the axe from the moment I picked it up was unbelievable.

The basic attack power was a staggering 130. The performance was so good that it was like the sword I was currently using was shining with light.

The only drawback was the incredibly high price that matched its performance.

It was impossible to buy it with the money I had.

"Are these items for sale?"
Here is the translation of the text:

"Of course not."

The shopkeeper said with a face that seemed to say "of course" naturally.

"Most of the equipment here is stuff that even a normal person can't survive. It's like showing off, saying that you can get these things if you go down further. And if not, you'll have to do a challenge quest like the one you got before, but I won't give it to you."

"That's a pity."

If the quest had been possible, he could have gotten most of the items. Taesan expressed his disappointment and the shopkeeper scolded him with a gesture of annoyance.

"What's wrong with you? Check it slowly."

The equipment Taesan picked up next was a magic staff with a gemstone attached to the tip.

Note: The translation is in Simplified Chinese, as per the rules.
Here is the translation of the text:

"[A Jewel-Encrusted Staff with the Essence of Stars] [It has been imbued with the essence of stars by inflicting wounds on the stars themselves.] [Magic + 70] [Special activation skill '[The Curse of the Wretched]' can be used.] [290,000G] [Mantle Ring] [A ring once used by the great Mantle, with an unknown true value. Although it is said to have a faint residual power that transcends mortal bounds, its actual strength is unclear.] [Mana + 400] [Intelligence + 200] [Defense + 80] [250,000G] [Earrings with the Sounds of All Things] [Earrings that contain the sounds of all things in the universe. Their value is immeasurable.] [Strength + 200] [Agility + 200] [Intelligence + 200] [Special activation skill '[Echoes of Sound]' can be used.] [270,000G]"

"What do you think?"

The shop owner, proud of the items, asked Taesan to inspect each one. Taesan nodded.

"It's really great."

To be honest, he was impressed.

Although the prices were very high, the abilities were worth it. If he bought just one of these items, he would be significantly stronger.

"'This is a tough one.'

What should I prioritize?

First, let's exclude weapons. The spirit said that I could obtain the weapons I used before.

Armor is the same. High defense is not that meaningful to me now.

Accessories. Or perhaps enhanced items. Their effects would be on attack power.

Or maybe items with special effects would be good too. Just then, a staff that caught Taesan's eye appeared.

"I'll start with this one."

Taesan picked up a flute."
Here is the translation of the text:

"[The Piper's Call] [This is the piper that a certain musician who loved silence used to play.] [When used, it prohibits the use of all magic within a 10-minute range. This item can only be used once a day.] [70,000G]

I had seen this piper at the shop before. As I descended the stairs, I noticed that the number of magic users increased. Every time I went to another world through the trials of the gods, I would always encounter someone who used magic.

Having this item was tempting, but I couldn't afford it back then, so I was planning to buy it now.

The shop owner seemed to accept my choice.

"That's acceptable. It's better to bring it back in its entirety than to abandon it halfway. So, what do you want to buy now?"

"I'll think about it for a bit more."

Now I have 200,000 gold left. With this, the level of my equipment will naturally decrease.

As I checked each item one by one, the shop owner shook his head.

"There's no merit worth changing that much."

The difference wasn't significant, and even if it was, there was no need to change it urgently. The shop owner looked at me with a puzzled expression after hearing my words.

"Is there nothing else? What's going on with you?"

Note: The text appears to be a scene from a fantasy story, where the protagonist is discussing the purchase of a piper's call item with a shop owner. The item has a unique ability to prohibit the use of magic within a certain range, but can only be used once a day. The protagonist is considering purchasing the item, but is hesitant due to the cost.
Here is the translation:

"You say your equipment doesn't make sense. After breaking through the trials of God and understanding everything, there's nothing bad about it."

"Hmm."

Tai Shan continued to examine the items, but nothing pleased him.

Just then, a leather cord appeared.

A simple leather cord with no patterns, it was extremely ordinary compared to other items. However, a subtle aura was discernible.

[A faint blessing can be felt in the leather cord] [A leather cord that wraps around the hilt of a sword. It's unknown who used it or who made it. The only thing that can be known is that it was made to hold a sword that can kill with a single bite, leading to death.] [Attack power + 20] [The longer you wield a sword with a leather cord, the higher your swordsmanship will become, and the more your attack power will increase.] [All debuff effects received while holding the sword are nullified.] [This effect can be cancelled at any time and switched to another weapon.] [200,000G]

The effect itself was nothing special. At first glance, it seemed like a ridiculously low number considering the price, with an attack power increase of only 20.

However, continuous growth was possible.
Here is the translation of the text:

There was also the effect that he could switch to a different weapon at any time. After a moment of contemplation, Taesan picked up his band.

"I'll do it with this."

"It's not bad either. It's a good choice."

The shop owner also looked at Taesan's choice with a pleased expression.

That was the end of everything at the shop.

Taesan expressed his gratitude and headed towards the corridor. The shop owner opened his mouth with a ambiguous expression.

"Are we at floor 41 now? Then we can see those things soon."

"What things?"

"There are. It's a bit annoying and frustrating, but... nothing much will happen to you."

It was a profound remark.

Taesan put it in his mind and walked out of the corridor.

[A furious mind appeared.]

A translucent sphere appeared.

The sphere began to tremble and Taesan could feel an attack heading towards his mind.

[Emotional turmoil judgment...][Judgment failed!]

Taesan shook his head to dispel the turmoil.

'As expected.'

Iteyan said. There were also floors in the labyrinth where only mental bodies appeared, and it was extremely difficult to break through when you had to deal with them, he said.

But it was of no concern to Taesan.
Here is the translation:

The concrete was stimulating his mind intensely, but to Taesan, it didn't evoke any particular feeling. The ghost spoke monotonously.

[It's impossible to overcome the existence of gods and their anger, let alone the existence of a labyrinth.]

Taesan swung his sword. The concrete broke, but the damage gauge didn't appear.

The broken concrete merged back together and intensely stimulated Taesan's mind once more.

Floor 41.

This place was the same as the floor of the spirit that had passed before. It was impossible to attack a spiritual body with ordinary methods.

'It's not impossible, but...'

If a sage is summoned through a ritual, it's possible to deal damage to a spiritual entity. However, it was an impossible choice for anyone other than Taesan.

So, just like the floor of the spirit, there was an existence that gave quests on this floor as well.

Taesan ignored the spiritual bodies and broke through the labyrinth. He sent a feeling of anger to each spiritual body he met, but ignored them all.

[I also had a hard time breaking through this, you know.]

The ghost murmured in amazement.
Here is the translation of the text:

This place was the 41st floor. It was impossible for the monster to attack weakly. Even the ghost took about an hour to break through a single room. The monster was one that had a significant impact on the mind.

However, Taesan was very calm.

[Taesan's skill level increased by 1%.]

Taesan walked around the entire room. His movements seemed like he knew the strategy, but the ghost didn't think much of it. By now, Taesan had shown too much, so he wouldn't be surprised by that.

After walking around, he found a room.

Unlike other doors, there was not a single speck of dust on this black door.

Taesan opened it.

Inside, a man with wild hair was laughing maniacally.

"Hahahah!"

[You have encountered a madman who is pursuing great spirituality.]
