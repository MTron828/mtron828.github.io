**Chapter 540**

**540. The Pantheon (6)**

"[He's like a beast.]"

Maria muttered to herself as she watched the battle from beyond the realm.

"[He's barbaric. I don't see any dignity or elegance in him, someone who has transcended.]"

Struggle and death. Two great authorities.

Rakiratas handled them with pure violence.

It was an extremely simple and foolish action, but for Rakiratas, it was the correct answer. Zelvand muttered in amazement.

"[I couldn't overpower him like that either.]"

He doesn't lose. He controls his actions with magic, forces his way, and creates a path to victory.

But he can't break through the boundaries and physical strength head-on like that. That's an overwhelming violence that only Rakiratas can achieve.

"[In the end, the conclusion is clear.]"

Dersha sneered.

"[He can't help us.]"

Taesan was trying to hold out against Rakiratas.

But that was all.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Rakiratas didn't even try to suppress or counterattack. He didn't feel any resistance and overwhelmed Taesan.

[He's too weak.] [Hmph.]

Essential stroked his chin, but didn't refute.

It was because it was the truth.

Rakiratas was undoubtedly powerful. As someone who controlled two authorities, he was among the top-tier transcendents.

But that didn't mean he had to be overwhelmingly dominant.

Taesan also had authority. It was ambiguous to say they were on the same level, but it was safe to say they were similar.

At the very least, Taesan should have counterattacked and dealt some damage.

But Taesan was too busy trying to hold on. It was as if he was a being of a lower dimension.

[Rakiratas is genuinely trying to kill him, but it's not his full power. If it were, he would have died instantly and turned to dust.] [That's not a wrong statement.]

There was no denial. Anyone who couldn't acknowledge the obvious was foolish and wouldn't have reached transcendence in the first place.

[But... it's still strange, though.]

Essential's eyes held a sense of wonder.

If Taesan was truly a being of a lower dimension than them, they should have been able to read his concept.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But it's impossible.

Taesan is fighting with all his might, but I still can't read his essence and aura.

[What's going on?] [There's no need to watch anymore. Let's take care of him right now...]

Dersha seemed to have grabbed an opportunity and was about to speak quickly.

But she shut her mouth.

The other transcendents were the same. An awkward silence fell in an instant.

Their gazes were fixed on Taesan.

To be exact, they were focused on the existence next to Taesan.

[…Just for a moment.]

Mashin scrunched up her face. Her face was filled with bewilderment.

[What's that?] 

A gray beast appeared in the realm.

[…Is that life?]

It was life. Clear emotions and will were visible.

But it couldn't be read.

It was life, but not life from this world. Nor was it life from the divine realm.

It was heteromorphic. Very much so.

[…What is this?] [I can't read it.]"

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

That beast was impossible to comprehend even with the transcendent beings' gaze. Like a dark veil absorbing light, it devoured their observation and concepts, leaving nothing behind.

Their intuition warned them. They couldn't read anything. It was impossible to grasp its essence or its level of power.

But that was dangerous.

As a transcendent being, their instinct was warning them about the ash-gray beast. It was something that could destroy the universe itself.

[Dangerous... but that's.]

* * *

A cry is heard.

It was like a beast released from a rusty cage, laughing with joy. The sound of the beast's laughter is heard.

Krrr...

It was something composed of ash-gray material.

Although it didn't have a proper form, a self similar to the beast's could be felt within it. It was guarding the side of the mountain.

Rakiratas laughed.

[Is that the source of your power? It's unusual.]

Krrr.

The beast lets out a small cry, gazing at Rakiratas with a wary eye.

Its behavior was like a dog protecting its master from an enemy.

Rakiratas' eyes sparkled.

[Is it alive? A power with a self? I've never heard of such a thing.]

"I was surprised at first too," [someone] said.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The boundary had a self that was settled in.

"So, I couldn't use it until now."

He had a power, but he had a solitary and complete self. To wield his power properly, he had to perfectly control the beast's self, but it was impossible for Taesan until now.

It was like having a pet that didn't listen to its owner's words. He followed his orders, but he couldn't control it. Taesan couldn't perfectly control his power because it kept acting on its own.

But it's not like that anymore.

Now, Taesan has obtained the right to control his power by becoming one with himself.

Now, he can control the beast at the boundary.

[Good. Then let's do it properly.]

Rakiratas smiled and put strength into his legs. His body quickly approached Taesan's vicinity.

Taesan didn't move.

Instead, he gave an order.

"Block."

The beast howled. It was happy to respond to its owner's command.

A grayish something scattered like fog and covered Rakiratas.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Rakiratas swung his axe. The boundary, which had been unable to withstand the two powers contained in that axe, was blown away.

Kagagagak!

But this time it was different.

The beast did not back down and instead bit into the axe with its jaws. Rakiratas' face changed in an instant.

With the power contained, the axe was swung wildly. The aftermath alone was enough to tear apart the realm created by the transcendents.

Kwaaaang!

The axe blade was about to cut down the beast at the boundary.

But the beast pulled out even more of its dark energy. Separate from Taesan, it was acting on its own will.

Tzzzzz!

The powers clashed and bounced off each other.

[Ha.]

Rakiratas let out a hollow laugh. He instinctively knew what kind of existence the beast in front of him was.

[Is the concept itself becoming a living being?]

Death, struggle, physical strength, selection, magic.

Each one was a massive concept.

The beast that Taesan controlled was that concept. The concept itself had a self and was being realized in this world.

[Well, I suppose it's not bad, even if it's unusual.]

The beast did not stop and charged towards Rakiratas' neck.

Rakiratas revealed his true intentions.

[Good! Good!]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

He bursts into laughter. With a genuinely joyful expression, he flashes a bright smile and grips his axe tightly.

Rakiratas unleashes his power.

The struggle to the death begins. He tries to trample and crush the beast clinging to him.

Kaah!

But the beast doesn't back down. It targets Rakiratas's weaknesses like a fierce dog.

The beast at the boundary is confronting the struggle and death head-on.

Kwah!

Their powers clash. Taesan quickly gathers his hands.

[You have activated the colorful, rainbow-colored [Boundary] dash.]

Ash-colored roots burst forth.

The difference from before is that each ray of light contains the beast's ego.

Like a living being, it evades Rakiratas's attacks and defense, targeting his entire body.

Kwah!

Rakiratas swings his axe. The struggle and death become a line, crushing and scattering the ash-colored roots.

But the beast targets the gap between them.

It digs into the axe's gap and collides with Rakiratas's body.

Kwah!

A loud crash erupts. Rakiratas's body is pushed backward.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The boundary had stained Rakiratas' body. The power that flowed out of Rakiratas pushed back the boundary, but his physical body suffered a slight loss.

Taesan had finally succeeded in dealing a blow to Rakiratas' physical body.

[Haha, haha, haha, haha!]

And Rakiratas was extremely delighted by that fact.

[Good! That's right! Show me your struggle! If not, I'll kill you!]

Rakiratas' eyes turned red.

[Rakiratas activated the concept of struggle and death.]

The power was activated.

And the world itself underwent a transformation.

The struggle that had been activated in the previous world had also changed at the atomic level, but it was limited to a local domain like the boundary world. The world was just a simple relative expression.

But now, it was literally the universe.

The concept of all things was transformed into the concept of struggle and death. The universe itself became a perfect possession of Rakiratas.

And the beast, as if responding to it, let out a howl. Taesan gave the order.

"Destroy it."

With a howl, the beast exploded itself.

The scattered beast fragments flew in all directions, trampling and polluting the world transformed into struggle and death.

Kwaaaah!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The Taesan unleashes its body.

It avoids the death of the world itself, which is rushing towards it, and creates a path.

The beast howls and strikes the void, causing the universe to tear apart and distort.

But it doesn't reach.

The beast is slowly being driven out of its place.

That is the power of Rakiratas.

It's not that it's not possible, but it's something that's equivalent to it. The universe itself is struggling and dying, so the boundary is virtually non-existent.

'It's possible to use it like that.'

Changing the concept of the entire world to one's own possession. At least, the current Taesan is unable to do so in an impossible way.

The beast howls and struggles. The universe itself collapses and is pushed back by the whirling ash-colored vortex.

But in the end, it's slowly pushed back. The boundary is clearly heterogeneous and powerful. Taesan is also controlling the beast to some extent.

But it's not perfect.

It's only now that it's possible to barely hold on, but it's still immature. In this state, it's impossible to confront Rakiratas's authority head-on.

Kwaaaah!

Taesan is being slowly pressured and its range of action is being restricted.

Kagagagak!"

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

However, Taesan's expression remained unchanged.

He had staked his life on the battle and was re-examining himself.

But that didn't mean he could defeat Rakiratas. It meant he could finally bring out the power that he couldn't even bring out halfway, and his limits were still clear.

He was still immature and couldn't bring out the bottom of his power.

So Taesan was waiting for an opportunity.

A very small gap that he could approach.

In response to Taesan's thoughts, the beast moved. The grayish color condensed into a clear, single form.

[Oh.]

Rakiratas let out a sigh of admiration.

The boundary, the realm itself, was gathered into that small form. It was like the universe was condensed into a small shape. It was a breathtaking sight.

The beast charged towards Rakiratas. The world that was pressing in was shattered and broken. The sound of wailing echoed through the realm.

Taesan also took a step forward. He followed the path created by the beast and approached Rakiratas.

Rakiratas lightly waved his hand.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The universe, transformed into Rakiratas's, is concentrated as it is. The universe itself tramples on the beast.

Two worlds collide.

It was only natural that the one being pushed back was covered in ashes. The fundamental difference between the two worlds was too great, making it an inevitable outcome.

However, the beast does not back down.

Even as it is trampled, crushed, and torn apart, it creates a path towards Rakiratas.

Kuaaaang!

The howling spreads, and the world trembles, halting the pressure on the beast.

Kwaaaang!

And the beast charges forward, towards Rakiratas.

[Stronghold.]

Rakiratas speaks calmly, swinging his axe.

The beast bares its fangs, but is repelled, already having exhausted its strength in creating a path.

But that's enough.

Taesan digs into Rakiratas's underside.

[You have activated Addition.] [You have activated the Sword of Tenacity.]

.

.

.

[You have activated Multiplication.]

Numerous skills are activated.

The physical force is concentrated within Taesan's sword.

It is a single authority. Taesan's massive collection, which allows him to dominate the concept of physical force.

$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

It's compressed and twisted. The transcenders who created the realm have made a massive scar.

Rakiratas smiled as if he had been waiting.

[Finally, it's out!]

Rakiratas also knew about the multiplication. A physical force that leaves a mark on the universe itself. He couldn't have missed its aftermath. From the beginning, he had been watching the battle on Earth.

That's why he was waiting more than anyone else. For Taesan to wield the multiplication.

He meant to crush it head-on himself.

[Ohra.]

Rakiratas raises his axe.

The universe is compressed by the axe.

All things, the concept of struggle and death itself, become one.

That was Rakiratas's full power.

Kuuuuuuung!

The axe and Taesan's sword collide. The aftermath covers the realm. It's not enough, and the realm starts to crack.

[Hmph.] [Is this it?]

The transcenders who were watching are shocked. The power of Rakiratas and Taesan within their realm had been suppressed to the limit. If not, it would have affected the universe itself, which is why they created the realm in the first place.

But now, that realm is starting to shake.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The transcenders further solidified their concepts and created a robust realm.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

A clash of condensed power and authority, and the winner was Rakiratas.

Ku-gu-gu-gu-gung!

Physical strength was torn apart and disappeared in the struggle and death.

Rakiratas wore a victorious smile.

[I won.]

However, his condition wasn't that great either. Despite dominating all things, his power itself was significantly consumed. His state was visibly depleted.

But compared to Taesan, his condition was relatively better.

Taesan had exhausted both his boundaries and physical strength. In reality, he had hit rock bottom.

Ku-u-u-ung!

The axe was swung.

Taesan had clearly consumed most of his power.

But there was still one power he had never used before.

A strange and twisted power that was beyond his understanding, even to himself, which had been dormant until now.

But it was no longer the case.

The spirit, body, and power achieved perfect unity.

Taesan himself didn't know what he was doing.

But his body, power, and strength moved first.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The mountain's arm moved. His hand touched the axe of Rakirates.

[You have activated the Spirit's Usurpation.]"
