**Chapter 377**

377. 78th Floor, the Library of All Creation (2)

Taesan, who had stepped onto the 78th floor, was greatly surprised.

The 78th floor was completely different from the floors he had passed through so far.

In the endless space, countless bookshelves were lined up, with only enough space between them for a single person to barely move.

And on the bookshelves, an uncountable number of books were tightly packed.

There were no monsters in sight, only the musty smell of old books filling the space.

Although there was no light, it was bright enough to read without any problems. And it was incredibly vast. Taesan had never seen a floor as large as this before.

It was literally endless.

[You have activated the Realm Detection of Leraje.]

Even after using black magic, he couldn't confirm the end of the floor.

It was as if all the books in the world were gathered here, and it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say so.

"As I heard."

The 78th floor, the Library of All Creation. It was one of the floors that Itaeyeon had told many stories about.

"There's no place that hasn't changed. But there's also a place that can't be changed."

The ghost murmured, filled with longing.

Taesan browsed through the bookshelves, scanning the titles of the books.

"[Goblin Ecology.] [The Great Adventurer, Palanka's Monster Cooking Method.] [Are Elves Really Gentle and Nature-Loving Beings Like Humans Think?]"

"There's all sorts of things."

As he looked around, he saw that there were all kinds of books, from useless ones that required specialized knowledge to understand, to others.

"[This is the Library of Everything. If it has the form of a book, then it exists. Literally, everything exists.]"

"Did the wizard and Balbambara create a place like this?"

"[No. It wasn't those two who created this place. The one who created this place is the God of Knowledge, Metis.]"

The ghost continued to speak calmly.

"[Metis's domain, where all knowledge is organized and stored. That's exactly the Library of Everything.]"

"Is it knowledge?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan pulled out a book. It was a simple novel for entertainment. It didn't fit in with the divine realm, but if the opponent was the God of Knowledge, it was understandable.

To the gods, their domain was their own and everything. The God of Knowledge was seeking and collecting all the knowledge that existed in the world.

Taesan put the book back and went inside.

No matter how far he walked, the bookshelves seemed endless. The tightly packed books were dizzying. Taesan walked endlessly and finally discovered a small space.

There were numerous chairs and desks, making it a perfect haven for reading books.

And a man was sitting in a chair, reading a thick book like an encyclopedia.

The man, who wore glasses and had neatly cut hair, looked very serious. He seemed to have noticed Taesan's presence, but he continued to read his book calmly.

[You have met Jorge, the librarian of the Library of the Omniscient.]

* * *

Jorge didn't say a word.

He just kept reading his book.

Taesan didn't speak to him either and pulled out a book. The title was "A Study on the Beards of Female Dwarves".

The only sound in the silence was the rustling of pages.

After finishing the book, Jorge closed it.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"A polite customer, indeed."

Just like the first impression, his voice was rough, but somehow it had a dignified tone.

"The process of acquiring knowledge should not be interfered with. All those who came before didn't know that and were impolite, but you, at least, have manners."

There was a hint of kindness in Jorge's gaze as he looked at Taesan.

"You were right."

Taesan thought to himself, closing his book.

Iteayeon had discovered a librarian on the 78th floor and suddenly started talking to him while he was reading. Jorge, who was interrupted while reading, faced Iteayeon with a very annoyed expression.

He said it was very difficult after that. Iteayeon was branded as impolite and would always make a sour face whenever he did something on the 78th floor, clicking his tongue. Remembering that, Jorge didn't interrupt him while he was reading.

[It's been a long time.]

"......Hero."

Jorge's eyes sparkled as he looked at the ghost.

"You died. I thought you would be able to reach the end of the labyrinth, but what happened?"

[It was my mistake.]

The ghost spoke calmly.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"[The Lion King and Sosiet. Did you pass by?]"

"Yes. It wasn't long ago. They were impolite things."

Horhe clicked his tongue. And, as if he understood, he gazed at the ghost.

"Is it betrayal? I can understand. It's unfortunate. You had said something about them to me."

"[It's already past, so it's okay. I died as you said. Now I'm a being that can't be involved.]"

"That's right. The adventurer who came to this place is the one I need to talk to."

Horhe looked at Taesan and opened his mouth.

"Adventurer. What's your name?"

"Kang Taesan."

"Kang Taesan. Do you know where this place is?"

"The Library of Eternity. The realm of Metis, the goddess of knowledge."

"I see. You must have heard it from the hero. That's right."

Horhe nodded his head.

"This is the realm of Metis. It's the Library of Eternity, where all the knowledge she has built up is stored."

A sea of books that would take a lifetime to read, even if you invested your entire life.

"I am honored to have received Metis' recognition and am the administrator of this place."

Note: There are some cultural and context-specific references in the text that may not be immediately clear to non-Korean readers. For example, "사자왕" (Lion King) and "소시엣" (Sosiet) are likely references to characters or titles from a specific story or game. Additionally, the concept of "만상의 서고" (Library of Eternity) and "메티스" (Metis) may be specific to Korean mythology or fiction.

Jorge smiled with a satisfied expression, as if he was proud of himself.

"Thanks to him, I was able to accumulate knowledge endlessly. No matter how much I thank him, it's not enough. That's why I, as a librarian, will do my best to fulfill his will."

Jorge said quietly.

"This is the library of the universe. You can stay here as long as you want."

"Is there no time limit?"

"There isn't. Knowledge doesn't restrict those who desire it. You can stay here as long as you want."

It was a fact that I already knew.

There was no time limit on clearing the 78th floor.

If you wanted, you could stay and accumulate knowledge without clearing it. I heard that Lee Tae-yeon also stayed here for a very long time.

"It's Metis's mercy. I'll be grateful. But... if you want to leave this place and move forward, I'll grant you one request."

"What is it?"

Jorge stood up and brought out a book. As he opened the book, he said...
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"I've been guarding this place as an administrator for a long time. But even I can't read all the books here."

The owner of this place is the God of Knowledge. It was impossible to read all of his knowledge.

"I'm still lacking."

Horge's eyes sparkled.

What was contained within was a passion for knowledge.

"Bring me the books I couldn't find, the ones I couldn't read. That's my request." [Quest start.] [Horge, the administrator of the Library of the Universe, is a greedy person. He wants to learn all the knowledge in the world with an insatiable desire for knowledge that has no bottom. Find the books he wants and bring them to him.] [Reward: The reward will vary depending on how satisfied Horge is with the books you bring.]

"I understand."

[Quest accepted.]

"You're going to move forward too, huh. I can't understand."

Horge looked at Taesan with a gaze that truly couldn't understand. As a seeker of knowledge, he couldn't understand adventurers who wanted to leave the Library of the Universe until they died.

Taesan asked him, "Does it matter what kind of book you couldn't find?"
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"That's right. Any old book is fine. If it's something I don't know, then..."

Horhe turned his gaze back to the book and said,

"If it's difficult, I can even bring you a book that I can't access. This is the divine library. There are books that even those without qualifications can't access, so choose as you like."

The story was over. As Taesan was about to leave, Horhe suddenly remembered and said,

"There are a few conditions to keep in mind while staying here."

He raised his finger.

"One. Don't dirty the books. Although adventurers like you can't touch the domain of Metis, there is such a thing as etiquette. If you cross the line, I'll expel you. And two. Don't touch me."

Horhe flipped through the pages with a bothered expression.

"There are occasionally people who try to do something to me. Let me say it beforehand, I have absolute authority here."

Horhe rustled the paper.

In an instant, the air changed.

Metis' domain began to press down on Taesan according to Horhe's will.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"What's inside is absolute will. Without using boundaries or eternal, unshakable faith, resistance was impossible.

"I am the only administrator permitted by Metis in this place. This is also my domain. Just remember these two things."

Taesan nodded his head. Horhe refocused on the book. At the same time, the oppressive feeling suddenly disappeared.

"That's enough. Then, go ahead and wander around, accumulating knowledge. Adventurer."

* * *

The quest clear condition is to find a book that Horhe hasn't read.

At first glance, it seemed incredibly easy. This place was ridiculously vast. Even Taesan now found it difficult to see the end of it.

To that extent, it was possible to think that any book would do, as long as it was one that Horhe hadn't read.

But this place was deep.

A deep-level quest wouldn't be that easy.

"Did it take around three years?"

It was the time it took for Lee Taeyeon to clear the 78th floor.

She hadn't been particularly attached to clearing it, but it still took an incredibly long time.

Horhe had memorized almost every book in this place.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It doesn't matter which book you take, you'll just say you've read it and refuse, right?" Taeyeon had said. There was a memory of complaining about it on the community, saying "Isn't that a lie?"

[What are we going to do? It'll take a lot of time to clear it methodically.]

The ghost also knew that and told Taesan. Taesan moved between the bookshelves.

"Let's think about it calmly for now."

There's no need to rush. Taesan already knew the method to clear it. If he wanted to, he could clear it right away.

But Taesan didn't intend to do so.

This is the realm of the God of Knowledge.

It's no exaggeration to say that all knowledge in the world is gathered here.

Taesan slowly browsed through the books, selecting titles that seemed interesting and started reading.

"You know a lot of things because of this place, right?"

Immortal, Transcendent, Faith, Spirit, and so on. The ghost really knew a lot and helped Taesan by telling him this and that.

Among them, there was a lot of knowledge that couldn't be obtained through normal means.

The place where that knowledge was obtained was right here, the Library of the Universe.

The ghost nodded in agreement.

[Yes. Most of the knowledge you desire is here. If you just find it, you can solve any question.]
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Lee Tae-yeon was the same. This was one of the floors she didn't dislike. She had spent a lot of time here reading books and passing the time.

Taesan didn't think of just passing by, even if it wasn't to that extent.

There were many things she was curious about. Faith, divinity, transcendence, and things related to gods.

She intended to resolve many doubts here. Taesan slowly turned the pages of the book.
