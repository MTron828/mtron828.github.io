Chapter 443

443. The 86th Floor, the World of the Incomplete (5)

"Let's check it out first."

Cosrun returned the relic of Cabert to Taesan.

[Cabert's Relic: The Last Owner] [A relic of a world that has already been destroyed. It has taken the lives of many imperial families. You have become the last owner of this sword. If the owner changes, all the sword's abilities will disappear.] [It has no value as a weapon in its current incomplete state. A vessel to contain a soul is prepared.]

"The attack power stats have completely disappeared."

"What I want is not to put a soul into the sword, but for the sword to become a soul. I've modified it to match the characteristics of the soul. As a result, its value as a sword has disappeared, but that doesn't matter. Once everything is over, it will boast unparalleled performance that can't be compared to before."

Cosrun smiled brightly and entered the cave.

Inside, there was an altar that seemed to have been prepared at some point.

A strong will and power were swirling around the four pillars that surrounded the altar. And in the center of the pillars, a space to insert the sword was visible.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"If you stand on the altar and insert the artifact of Cabert, it'll be fine."

"Can I do it??"

"No. The soul that will become the sword must do it directly."

[I'm sorry, but I can't exert physical strength.]

The ghost was a dead person. Unless it was a special situation, it couldn't have any influence on the world. Coslun said calmly.

"That's what the altar is for, so don't worry."

Coslun fiddled with the numerous devices around the altar.

Kiiing!

Then, the device started to operate. A strange wave spread throughout the cave.

[This is...].

At the same time, the ghost's body began to take on color.

Until now, it was like a illusion created by steam, but now it was regaining its own color.

"You'll be able to wield the sword with physical strength."

[......]

The ghost stretched out its hand. The artifact of Cabert was gently grasped in its hand.

[...It's been a while since I've held this sword again.]

"Now that we're going to become one, there's no need to get sentimental. We're short on time. Let's go in now."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The ghost grasped the relic of Carbert and entered the altar. Coslun spoke slowly.

"From here on, gaze deeply at what you desire. Fundamentally, it will take the form of a sword, but its power will be determined by what you wish for."

[What I desire.]

"Then let's start!"

Coslun's face was filled with excitement as he pressed the device. The ghost inserted the relic of Carbert into the pillar's groove.

Kiiiiing!

The altar emitted a loud noise. The energies resonated with each other, amplifying their power.

The amplified power focused on the ghost and the sword.

[Ugh.]

The ghost let out a small groan.

It was an extremely unpleasant sensation. The feeling of all the elements that made up its being distorting and being contaminated. The ghost controlled itself and thought deeply in its mind.

"What I desire."

Kugugugugung!

Along with the noise, the ghost's form began to collapse.

At the same time, the relic of Carbert floated up into the air.

The sword, which had been distorted and collapsing due to the powerful force, met with the ghost.

It wasn't just a matter of putting a soul into the sword, but rather becoming a perfect one.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A life form with the shape of a sword begins to be born.

"Woohoo!"

Cosrun shouted with a face full of joy.

The fusion seemed to be successful. There was no resistance felt in Bardley's soul, which was becoming one with the sword. It was as if they had been one from the beginning, accepting each other.

"I did it! I did it!"

Cosrun let out a triumphant cry.

At that moment, a single sword was being created.

Something descended between them.

A power that was pure, law-like, and beyond any force or resistance.

It touched the ghost.

[Ah.]

The ghost let out a sigh.

"Uh, uh, uh!"

Cosrun's face suddenly changed. The state of the sword and the ghost, which were becoming one, suddenly distorted.

"What's going on! What's happening!"

He frantically operated the device, but nothing changed.

The ghost's soul was being pulled back to where it originally belonged.

"Why is this happening!"

Cosrun's face was one of incomprehension.

But Taesan could see.

The one pulling the ghost was the law of the world.

'Is it death?'
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The law of the world is that a soul that has lost its body must go to the underworld. It was forcing the ghost, who wanted to be reborn with a sword, to go with it.

"That's not going to work."

Taesan spread out his black aura. In an instant, the cave was dyed black. Koslun's pupils grew larger.

"What's going on?"

Taesan mixed his divine power into it.

The ash-colored aura covered the cave.

The death that was trying to take the ghost away was blocked at the boundary and couldn't reach the ghost.

The ghost, who had regained its freedom, was enraged with the sword. The ghost deeply wished for its own desire.

"Kugugugugung!"

The ash-colored aura covered the world.

"Uuuuuuh......"

Koslun stumbled and barely got up. The altar was destroyed, leaving no trace behind.

And in the center of it, one sword was stuck.

"Success...?"

Koslun muttered. Taesan approached the sword.

Its appearance was similar to the relic of Kabert.

But what was felt inside was a completely different thing, yet it was a familiar kind to Taesan.

"What's going on?"

[...It's cold. I can barely feel any warmth.]

The ghost's voice echoed.

Taesan grasped the relic of Kabert.

[You have obtained the prince of the destroyed world: Bardley.]

Let me know if you need any further assistance!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

***

It was no longer a relic of Cavert. This black sword was Bardley itself.

"Creak. Creak."

Coslun approached, brushing away the dust.

When he saw Bardley in Taesan's hand, he rushed towards him like a wild dog.

"Wow, how did you do it! You succeeded?"

[Is that so?]

Bardley escaped from Taesan's hand and floated alone. Its movement, freely roaming the air, was as natural as a person moving their body.

"Oooo... Oooooh!"

An uncontrollable joy appeared on Coslun's face.

"Hahaha! I did it! I did it! I succeeded!"

Coslun, who was jumping around, grabbed Taesan's hand.

"Thank you. I'm really grateful! It's all thanks to you."

"Does this mean you've achieved your wish?"

"No. That's not it."

Coslun denied it with an excited face.

"While it's true that I've achieved the impossible feat of creating a weapon that's almost alive through the fusion of a weapon and a soul, what I wanted was to see with my own eyes that the weapon I created has surpassed mortality."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Bardeley had obtained the possibility, but he still couldn't surpass mortality. It was hard to believe that Kosrun's wish had come true.

But Kosrun was extremely satisfied.

"It's enough with this. I'm more than satisfied. If Bardeley becomes immortal later, come find me for sure. I have to see it with my own eyes!"

[Well, I can do that much.]

"Oo……."

Kosrun's body trembled with excitement.

"It's all thanks to you."

He looked at Taesan. To think about it, the reason he was able to obtain the possibility of fulfilling his wish was because Taesan had brought the ghost here.

"What's your name again?"

"Taesan."

"Ah, Taesan. Is there anything else? Tell me anything. I'll make it happen."

But Taesan looked at Kosrun's face and shook his head.

His face was extremely pale, not much different from a corpse.

"Let's talk about it later. I need to confirm some things too."

"Ah……."

It was as if Kosrun had suddenly remembered his exhaustion, and his legs began to wobble.

"That's... that's right. Sorry. I need to rest for a bit. I'll come back later."

Note: There may be some nuances or cultural references that don't translate perfectly, but I've done my best to provide an accurate translation.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Cosrun stumbled and headed towards his own space. Taesan, who saw his appearance, came out from the outside.

"How's your sense?"

[What's this... I've become a sword. It's just a weird feeling. My senses are a bit off, but it doesn't seem to be a big problem when it comes to acting.]

The bardley, which had risen alone in the air, moved quickly. A sharp whooshing sound and a sword aura were drawn.

But somehow, it felt awkward. It was like a child who couldn't handle the weight of a sword.

[It's too awkward. It'll take some time to get used to handling myself as a sword. But it's not bad. I'm satisfied.]

"Well done. Congratulations."

Taesan congratulated him sincerely. Bardley responded.

[Thank you.]

"What are you going to do now?"

The current Bardley was perfectly free.

It didn't matter if he wasn't by Taesan's side anymore. Taesan wouldn't stop him even if he wanted to leave.

[I chose to become a sword because I want to see your remaining journey.]

Bardley said calmly.

[If I think about the favor I received from you, leaving would be too conscienceless, wouldn't it?]

"That's true."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan said with a smile, like a joke. Bardray returned to Taesan's hand.

[You're the only one who has the qualification to wield me. I don't think of leaving you.] [You have received Bardray's recognition. Everything about the Stormscar sword is now yours.]

At the same time as Bardray's recognition, the knowledge and experiences related to the Stormscar sword began to seep into Taesan.

The knowledge, experience, and effort. Everything was contained within Taesan. Taesan wielded Bardray with ease. The sword flashed with a sharp whooshing sound, swinging wildly like a storm.

This swordsmanship was that of the Stormscar sword. It was no wonder, since Taesan had directly learned the Stormscar sword from the ghost.

However, the sword that was now being wielded was far surpassing the level that Taesan had previously handled.

[Is this how my wish is being fulfilled... It's amazing.]

"What did you wish for?"

[It was nothing much. I just thought it would be nice if I could become a sword and teach others the Stormscar sword. That's what I thought. Is this how it turned out? It's a bit different from the wind, but it's not bad.]

Note: "폭풍흉터" is translated to "Stormscar", but it's a bit of a rough translation. "폭풍" means "storm" and "흉터" means "scar", so it could also be translated to "Storm Scar" or "Scar of the Storm".
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Taesan was able to wield the sword of Stormscar perfectly.

The Ability Sword was ultimately a swordsmanship based on Stormscar. Being able to wield the swordsmanship that serves as its foundation means that the proficiency of the Ability Sword has increased.

Taesan had reached the pinnacle of swordsmanship that the ghost had spent his entire life to achieve.

[And one more thing.] [Bardray activated his shape-shifting ability.]

The sword floated in the air, and its shape began to change. The blade warped and the hilt twisted.

Before long, a Bardray made of iron in human form appeared.

[The sensation remains the same, but is this enough?]

"Did you want to take on a human form?"

[Similar. It's inconvenient to be just a sword, so I sometimes want to take on a human form. For now, this is fine.]

Bardray transformed back into a sword and returned to Taesan.

[Then, let's check.]

"Is it okay?"

Bardray was originally an adventurer, but now he has become Taesan's weapon. Taesan needed to verify its performance.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"But it might be uncomfortable for Bardray, so I was deliberately putting it off."

"It doesn't matter. I was prepared for that much, anyway. It actually became a weapon, didn't it?"

Bardray said lightly.

"I became your weapon. You cleared the 86th floor and completed Coslun's quest, and I'm the reward you got. Feel free to check it out."

"Then that's that."

Taesan didn't refuse either. A system window about Bardray appeared.

[The Prince of the Ruined World: Bardray] [The Prince of the Ruined Empire, Cabert. Bardray, who was reborn with a sword as his physical body.] [Attack power +2500] [The proficiency of all swordsmanship skills will greatly increase.] [Bardray can move on his own and wield his swordsmanship.] [Bardray can grow on his own. His attack power will increase as he defeats enemies.] [Only those recognized by Bardray can wield Bardray.] [Those recognized by Bardray as sword users can perfectly wield the Storm Scar sword.] [Once a day, Bardray can activate his own will to manifest his form for an hour.]
