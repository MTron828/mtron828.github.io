614. Easy Mode. Simulated Time Stop (2)

A treasure chest was visible beyond the faintly moving projectiles.

One had to pass through these projectiles to proceed. The reward of the secret room awaited there.

Kagagagagaga!

The projectiles collide and rebound, filling up the room.

One must avoid all of them to get through. It seems incredibly difficult.

However, it wasn't as hard as it looked.

There was a pattern to them, assuming one didn't touch the projectiles.

By separating all the projectiles into several patterns and moving according to those patterns - it was a sort of bomb-dodging.

Indeed, Taesan took no more than two days to pass through to the secret room.

He hadn't spent years here for the reward.

"Be patient."

Taesan grumbles and enters. His movements were slow, as if taking a leisurely stroll, but the projectiles perfectly avoided him.

And Taesan stood in the center of the room, the size of a playground.

Kagagagagaga!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The projectiles moving erratically around me.

The fact that this many projectiles were rebounding and filling the room was a special condition in itself. It was a room that I couldn't see again, at least not twice.

I wondered if I could gain something here, and the condition came to mind immediately.

Blocking all projectiles.

He would obtain a skill by blocking all projectiles that approached him to a certain extent.

A skill that blocked all projectiles, an absolute skill.

The simpler and clearer the condition of a skill, the more powerful the skill obtained. In that sense, blocking projectiles was a skill that could be obtained with certainty.

Taesan immediately attempted to block the projectiles.

But he failed.

It wasn't that he didn't invest enough. He invested years of time, but gave up, judging it impossible.

"It's been a while."

Taesan drew two swords. He couldn't use a shield. A skill was something that couldn't be obtained by anyone through ordinary means.

A projectile that seemed to be empty passed by him, hitting Taesan's sword.

Kagagagak!

And the sound spread.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

The pattern that was perfectly aligned like a machine due to external interference is distorted. In an instant, the space is filled with projectiles. Some of them fly towards Taesan.

Taesan takes a short breath. He moves his sword erratically with both hands.

Ka-ga-gak!

He knocks away the sphere flying in from the left. The sphere that hit the sword flies in a different direction, colliding with the projectiles flying towards Taesan. They bounce off each other, creating a kind of curtain.

He pulls out his right-hand sword long. He presses down on the projectiles, making them bounce off the ground, and then stabs. The needle flying in at high speed flies back in the opposite direction.

Hundreds of projectiles fly towards Taesan.

But none of them reach him.

It's as if there's an invisible circular barrier centered around Taesan that they can't penetrate. Taesan's sword moves erratically. The projectiles bounce off each other, repelling and pushing each other away.

It's a phenomenon that can't be described as a miracle.

A transcendent point achieved through pure technique and calculation alone.

And then 10 seconds pass.

Ka-gak!
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

A single arrow flew towards Taesan's face, but he dodged it by tilting his head. However, the arrow grazed his cheek as it passed by.

[Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.]

"Tch."

He clicked his tongue.

Although he had only allowed a single hit, it was a failure in itself. Taesan quickly retreated to a secret room. The projectiles attacked him frantically, but the attack nullification skill rendered them all ineffective.

Kugugung!

The door closed.

Taesan sheathed his sword.

"I guess it's just not meant to be."

He let out a sigh.

To acquire the projectile-blocking skill, he would have to block every single projectile's approach himself.

However, there were too many projectiles.

The moment external interference occurred, the predetermined pattern was disrupted, and chaos erupted in an instant. It was impossible to sense and block everything.

If it were Lee Tae-yeon, it might be possible. But he was in easy mode. The limitations of his stats couldn't be helped.

So Taesan thought simply.

He found a pattern in the chaos he had created.

From the initial interference, he determined the timing, angle, and force required to deflect each projectile to a certain extent.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"After that, how could he manipulate the sword to prevent the projectiles from colliding with each other and approaching Taesan?

He calculated everything and programmed it into his body like a machine.

But he was not a machine. He was a living, breathing human.

He tried to identify the irregular patterns of thousands of projectiles. It was a task possible only with a supercomputer. His brain had limitations, and patterns beyond his predictions emerged after 10 seconds.

He knew it from the moment he tried to acquire the skill. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't block it for more than a certain amount of time. Still, he invested years of time, hoping that if he persisted to the limit, he might be able to obtain the skill.

But it was a futile hope.

Even if he endured for 10 seconds, the system window was bleak.

'Is it 20 seconds? Or maybe 1 minute?'

Either way, it was impossible. He invested years of time and finally came to a conclusion.

This failure was a deeply painful one for him as well."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The blockage of all projectiles. If he could acquire it, he would have absolute defense against a specific opponent, and it wouldn't be an exaggeration. Among the monsters, there were many bomb-type monsters, and it meant he could ignore them all.

But in the end, it was a failure. With his skills, it was a skill that was impossible to obtain. It was already concluded that it was impossible.

He didn't come here to reacquire that skill.

Taesan re-entered the secret room.

Click.

The platform was pressed, and the projectiles came out again. This place reset the projectiles every time he entered and exited the secret room. If it weren't for that, he wouldn't have even tried in the first place.

"Hmm."

Taesan gazed at the projectiles with a blank expression. His mind was racing at high speed.

Right now, he was thinking about the effect and condition of a single skill.

After several tens of minutes, the answer came out.

"It's possible, but..."

It was an absurd thing to do, but if he relied on luck, he might be able to get it.

Anyway, what he wanted was an irregular skill. It couldn't be obtained through normal means like other skills. Other players might ask what was normal about that, but that's how Taesan thought."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

Then, he re-examines the conditions. Taesan unsheathes his sword towards the incoming projectiles. The massive sphere that collides with the sword lets out a loud noise as it bounces back.

Ka-a-a-ang!

The sphere he just touched is the largest projectile. It's flying towards a thin needle and collides with it. Naturally, the needle should be crushed and the sphere should advance effortlessly.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

But the phenomenon that appears is entirely different.

The massive sphere and the needle bounce back simultaneously.

The bounced sphere collides with other smaller projectiles and moves around erratically. It's a phenomenon that defies the laws of physics.

All the projectiles here, regardless of their size and shape, have 100% identical kinetic energy and weight.

It's as if they're the same object, just with different appearances. If you only focus on their volume, the calculation becomes much simpler.

And.

He focuses on the moment when the projectiles collide with each other.

Ka-a-a-ang!

The needle and the arrowhead collide and bounce back in opposite directions.

At that moment, Taesan can see it.

The moment when the projectiles collide, they briefly come to a standstill.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"At first, I thought that the object thrown high into the sky would momentarily come to a standstill in mid-air, where its kinetic energy and potential energy would be in balance, due to the collision.

But upon closer inspection, it was entirely different.

Every projectile here comes to a brief halt for a very short time when it makes contact with something.

It's as if time has stopped.

I don't know the reason. Maybe it's the system of the labyrinth. All he knew was that when a projectile collides with something, it stops for about 0.05 seconds.

This part was crucial.

It was the key to obtaining the skill he desired.

"It's okay, since we're using the labyrinth's characteristics."

It may be a trick, but it doesn't matter. The labyrinth, which blocks all tricks, generously allows users to find their own way.

I reset the trap and stand in the center of the room. Thousands of projectiles are moving wildly.

Taesan points his sword towards that place.

Ka-boom!

The predetermined pattern is disrupted, and the projectiles start flying around like crazy."

Note: "미궁" (migung) is translated to "labyrinth", but it could also be translated to "maze" or "dungeon" depending on the context.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"How does it react when touched? I've grasped the pattern well enough over the past year. I could perfectly block the projectiles approaching the mountain within 10 seconds.

But that's not what he wants now.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

The projectiles that were repelled like crazy fly towards the mountain.

The mountain quickly moves its sword, deflecting and pushing back the projectiles. The projectiles that are flying around in all directions pierce his entire body.

[Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.] [Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.] [Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.] [Your first attack has been absolutely nullified.]

The attack nullification continues to activate. The mountain doesn't panic. This was exactly the situation he was aiming for.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

He discards the attack nullification window and focuses.

He touches the projectiles and makes them go crazy, centering around him.

Ka-ga-ga-gak!

"This is how it reacts when touched, and this is the pattern that comes out."

He remembers the pattern, exits the room, and re-enters. Then, he touches the projectiles again.

Ka-ga-ga-ga-gak!"

Note: The "Ka-ga-ga-gak" sounds seem to be some kind of onomatopoeia or sound effects, possibly indicating the sound of the projectiles moving or the mountain's sword clashing with them.
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"With a speed that's like going crazy, I swing my sword towards the projectiles flying towards me. The projectiles, deflected by my sword, collide with each other.

The collided projectiles come to a halt in mid-air.

It's an extremely short, fleeting moment that you wouldn't even notice if you weren't focused.

Ka-chak.

I move both hands. My sword clashes with the projectiles, and they crash into each other.

And in that moment.

For an instant, five projectiles surrounding Taesan come to a complete stop.

Taesan's eyes narrow. His mind accelerates further, and his physical senses become even more acute.

What he's trying to do is simple.

The projectiles enter his domain.

And he stops them.

By colliding, crashing, and rebounding, he brings all the projectiles within his range to a halt.

In just 0.05 seconds, everything comes to a standstill.

It's as if time itself has stopped, except for him."
