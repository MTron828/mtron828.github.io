Chapter 230

230. 52nd Floor (1)

[Are you okay?]

"Am I okay?"

[Hmmm... ]

The ghost couldn't believe the reaction. However, as the owner, there was nothing more to say. He was really fine, except for feeling a bit mentally exhausted. There was no other abnormality.

[Is that so? Master. I almost had a moment where our contract connection was about to break off.]

"There's no problem. If there was a problem, I would have known first."

The owner shook his head. Barkazar was about to say something.

"Is that the end?"

Just then, the wind blew.

Minerva appeared. Barkazar bowed his head.

[Have you come? Your Majesty.]

"Yes, Barkazar."

Minerva looked at Barkazar for a moment before turning her gaze away.

"We're done too. As long as I'm here, the divine being cannot interfere with this world."

She looked at the owner with a gloomy face.

"Now... it's goodbye. It's hard to meet again."

[We've made a contract, haven't we? If you want, you can come anytime.]
Here is the translation of the text:

"Although I can, I have to protect this world. When I made a contract with you, a part of my power entered you, making my defense weaker. So, I have to work even harder. That's why I might not be able to meet you."

Minerva shook her head.

"Don't worry about power. The power that has been achieved through the contract is already yours."

She smiled and waved her hand.

"I'm glad. Tae-san. And I'm grateful. I wish you well on your path."

With that, the world was covered in darkness. The light that filled the entire view made Tae-san close his eyes.

When the light faded and he opened his eyes, he was back in the space where he first met Beatrice.

[Ah, ahah.]

Barca stumbled.

Tae-san turned his gaze.

[Well done, mortal.]

Beatrice was there.

* * *

[Ah, our lord. This humble body, is it worthy to be your lord...?]

Barca stumbled again. Even when he met the Archangel, he would express his respect with a calm demeanor, but he was so flustered that he couldn't even speak properly.

[It's done. My child.]

Beatrice lightly grasped Barca with her power.

[You've done well. I praise you.] [Oh, ohohoh...]

Barca's body trembled with emotion.
Here is the translation of the text:

Beatrice looked at Tai Shan.

[You did a great job too. It was the best result I could have hoped for.]

Beatrice's voice was filled with satisfaction.

Tai Shan opened his mouth.

"Did you use your abilities?"

[To some extent, I restrained myself, but they always find another way. I expected that you would interfere, so I was prepared. The key was timing.]

Beatrice chuckled. The current result was a very pleasant sight.

[No matter how much interference there is, there is a limit to what I can do. If the Spirit King becomes complete, I can deal with it. I can take care of it easily and solve the problem without any issues. The key is to hold on until then, but I judged that you could do it. The result was a success.]

Beatrice's gaze at Tai Shan was filled with kindness.

[Even if there is no consumption of strength, this level of interference means that I won't be able to show my face for a while. You did a great job. Human.]

The trick was over.

It was now time to wait for the reward.
Here is the translation of the text:

You have fulfilled what I was expecting of you, so I will grant you a reward that matches your efforts.

Boom.

The power of the High God envelops the entire realm.

[Originally, I was going to give you the power to stabilize the vessel. The vessel of the High God is now difficult for you to handle, so I was trying to provide assistance. But it's no longer necessary.]

The Ring of Pure White. This equipment, which has the effect of storing power, was able to handle the power obtained through the contract with the High God without any problems.

[Even the hands of the mortal can produce such things. It's astonishing. Although there is still a lack of power, and it's not yet fully effective, but when all the restrictions are lifted, it will be quite usable.] [Ah.]

The Transcendent One acknowledged the effect of the ring. The existence of a power that can make even the High God seem like dust was a shocking statement. The ghost let out a small sigh at the fact.

[So I will change my plan.]

The power is now directed towards the Great Mountain.

[First, I will acknowledge you. You have helped me according to my will, and everything that follows my will will accept you.]

The High God acknowledged the Great Mountain. The mere words shook the world.
Here is the translation of the text:

[The one who defies nature has evolved into the one who rules nature.] [And this is a gift for a cute child.] [You have received a special permanent skill called [Proxy of Contract].]

The power resonated deeply within the depths of Tai Shan's heart.

That was a kind of channel. Tai Shan could sense it instinctively.

[The pitiful child needs a reliable existence. Since I have already entrusted my heart to you, I cannot abandon you.]

"Thank you."

Tai Shan bowed in gratitude. The Holy Spirit spoke indifferently.

[Not yet. You have fulfilled what I expected, so can you do one more thing for me?]

Beatrice, gazing at Tai Shan with a thoughtful expression, shook her head.

[Barcas. You cannot receive my power. You have already received it from that child, so if you try to obtain more here, your soul will be destroyed.] [Such unnecessary words. I am thrilled just to have seen my lord.]

Barcas did not seem to think about it, and Beatrice continued to speak.

[So, look at the spirit sealed to your sword.]

"Are you talking about a mad spirit?"

The mad spirit wanted to avenge the Holy Spirit and had sacrificed everything to seal itself to the sword.

[Do not grant the pitiful one's wish.]
Here is the translation of the text:

The spirit of Mount Tai rose and flew towards Beatrice. He lightly caressed the tip of the sword.

Suddenly, the being imbued in the sword appeared.

A white, trembling thing was shaking. Beatrice, who was anxious about the white thing, said:

[I affirm you.]

The being's power was imbued in the white thing.

The white thing began to tremble.

The power and presence felt there were different from before.

The white thing became one with the sword again. The gentle sword, which had flown towards Beatrice, was caught by Mount Tai, who said:

"Are you okay?"

The mad spirit's wish was the death of the Fire Spirit King.

[It doesn't matter. Both are my children. So I will respect and reward them accordingly.]

Beatrice opened her mouth.

[That's the end of my reward.]

Mount Tai bowed his head sincerely.

"Thank you."

He had gained many things. The reward was more than what he had expected from the agreement with the Spirit King. Moreover, he had gained many things. The value of the time spent was there.

Beatrice looked at Mount Tai and said:

[You have been swallowed up by that guy.]
Here is the translation of the text:

Koshin was gathering power to kill Taesan by scattering his shadows. And when Taesan approached, Koshin scattered his power and devoured his soul.

[But it's not a problem at all.]

It was Koshin who swallowed Taesan. Beatrice didn't know the details, but it's likely that Koshin's power was intended to crush Taesan's spirit.

The power of the overman.

That was not the kind of power that a mortal could withstand. Even those who had been trained could go insane just by looking at the overman.

If it was just a matter of gazing, then there was no need to say anything.

But Taesan didn't show any unusual signs. From the perspective of the gods, there was no problem with his spirit or body.

[It seems that what they said was true. Is there also a point of arrival like this?]

Beatrice muttered to herself. Koshin's power was gradually weakening, and Taesan began to return to his mystified state.

[I suppose even the gods have noticed Koshin's abnormality. From now on, we'll approach it with a different method, so be careful.]

"Thank you for the advice."

[Ah, and one more thing.]

Beatrice began to talk as if she had realized something.

Here is the translation of the text:

"I don't intend to get involved in the power you've obtained. Although it's surprising that such a thing is possible, it's something you've achieved through your own efforts, so there's no problem with you having it.

However, some people may not take kindly to your having the power they possess. Be mindful of that."

"Okay."

Tai Shan nodded his head.

"Then, adventurer, explore the labyrinth and fulfill our and your wishes."

With that, Tai Shan returned to the labyrinth.

"Ah..."

Tai Shan let out a sigh and sat down.

Initially, it flowed smoothly, but suddenly an event occurred at the end. I didn't think it would be easy, but it was indeed difficult.

"Wow, is this the labyrinth?"

Barca looked at the labyrinth with a fascinated expression.

"...Ah, a powerful entity. It's felt just by the power I can sense. Good, very good."

Barca laughed happily.

While he was exploring the labyrinth, Tai Shan also had something to take care of. He had obtained many things.

He needed to check how to handle them and what methods to use.
Here is the translation of the text:

Title: [One who has made a pact with the king] [World Guardian. I have made a pact with the Lord of the Spirits, the King of the Spirits. My dominance over spirits has increased, and I can exert influence over nature.]

The effects of my title have already been felt. When I made a pact with the King of the Spirits, I was able to sense nature itself.

And when I combined this effect with the skills I obtained at that time, it became even stronger.

[Special permanent activation skill: Harmony with Nature] [Proficiency: 1%] [I can exert influence over nature and harmonize with it. However, I can't pull off anything significant yet.]

"It doesn't feel like it's getting any lighter."

The influence of nature that the Great Mountain sensed was a direct influence over the weather.

If I wanted to, I could make it rain in a place where the sun was shining brightly and let the sun shine through in a place where it was shrouded in mist.

This is a trivial matter compared to the Great Mountain, which can create waterfalls and manifest deserts.

[It's only natural for someone at the Lord of the Spirits' level to consider this a trivial matter. They are beings who can create waterfalls and manifest deserts.]

"It's like I'm becoming increasingly detached from humanity."

[Is that so now?]

"I suppose so."

The Great Mountain continued to confirm this.
Here is the translation of the text:

"[Special Activation Skill: King's Vessel] [Proficiency: 1%] [Mana Consumption: 300] [A part of the king's vessel, possessed by the king of spirits, is embedded in one's body. If one does not have the corresponding strength, penalties will be incurred.] 'Still.'"

This skill was able to summon a part of the king's vessel. Normally, it would be difficult for someone like Taesan, who didn't have the corresponding strength, to use it, but since I have the ring, I was able to use it without any issues.

"[The material is material, as expected, but it's still quite surprising. To receive the king's power despite being incomplete...]."

So, Beatrice was also interested in the ring.

This skill was the greatest reward for making a contract with the king of spirits. If used in conjunction with the Sado's transformation, even an incomplete Sado could fight without being inferior to a complete Sado.

"'I'll be able to fight soon.'"

It's not a fake Sado created by divine trials, but a real Sado. The one who killed Taeyun and defeated him in the end.

Although I'm not strong enough to win yet, I can still fight. He is getting stronger and stronger.

"[Can we summon it?]"

He asked, looking curious.

"[I said it was impossible, just like Minerva, but I'm not sure...]"
Here is the translation of the text:

Minerva said, "I must protect this world. I need to recover the power that was released by the contract." She said she couldn't stay together with him.

"What's up?"

[Spirit Contract: Wind Spirit King Minerva] [Proficiency: 1%] [Mana Consumption for Summoning: 1000] [You have contracted with Minerva. You can summon Minerva and give her orders. You can also use some of Minerva's power.]

Summoning the Spirit King.

It consumed 1000 mana, which meant it was a powerful effect.

"I'll try it and see."

[You are the Wind Spirit King Minerva. You have summoned Minerva.]

Wooo.

The space opened up, and at the same time, the power that had been hidden within Tai Shan began to stir.

[Your contract's executor has been activated.]

The space was forcibly opened by a powerful force.

And a woman with blue hair fell from the sky.

"Ah, ah?"

Minerva, who had been summoned to the labyrinth, sat on the ground with a bewildered expression, looking around.
