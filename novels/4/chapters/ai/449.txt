**Episode 450**

**450. The Seventh Return, Earth (2)**

[Special Quest Start] [This quest targets all of humanity.] [All surviving humans must gather at a specific location. Overcome the hardships you face while gathering and arrive at the designated location.] [This quest has no time limit.] [The more influence you have on other players during the encounter, the more points you will receive when you return to the labyrinth.]

The quest begins.

The leaders and strongmen of each country gathered in the conference room, their faces serious, and began to discuss.

"Has the location been confirmed?"

"It's the United States."

India's leader, Kamal Hasan, asked, and Russia's leader, Viktor Stanichin, replied.

"It's only fitting that the country that once held power should be the last to decorate the end. But I'm not exactly thrilled about it."

Viktor grumbled. His homeland, Russia, had been a rival of the United States until the world was on the brink of destruction. The fact that the United States was the final gathering place didn't exactly put him in a good mood.

"Since the world is in this state, it's only natural for fools to cling to their outdated emotions."

"I have to go to Las Vegas in the US. Fortunately, there's no time limit like in the previous quest."

"Las Vegas... is it?"

Gang Joon-hyuk spoke with an ambiguous expression.

"How are we supposed to get there?"

The question was met with silence.

All the quests so far had involved traveling long distances. They had to cross continents and oceans.

But this time, it was different.

This time, they had to cross not just a continent, but the entire world.

"How many kilometers is it from here?"

"Estimated to be... 6,500 miles. 10,000 kilometers. That's a straight-line distance, including the North Pacific Ocean. If we go by land, it could be twice that. It's roughly half the circumference of the Earth."

"...I have no idea how long it'll take."

Kim Hwi-yeon let out a dry laugh.

It was a quest that could take years to complete.

Unless they had Taesan.

"But since we have Taesan, it won't take that long."

Everyone's gaze turned to Taesan. The strongest of them all, who could defeat all the monsters and lead the way forward.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Generally speaking, it's not a distance that can be walked, but even in easy mode, players can surpass the average human level. There was no issue with stamina.

"Then, how are we going to cross the sea?"

"I remember there being a land adjacent to Canada on the Russian side. We can go through that way."

"I've checked too. There's a port town in the Chukchi Autonomous Okrug called Welles. It's very close to Alaska. Although it's a one-hour flight, I think he can handle it."

"Yes, it's definitely possible."

Kim Hwi-yeon nodded his head.

Taesan had experience crossing the sea between Japan and Korea. For him, a one-hour flight was a manageable distance.

"It's going to be a long journey. We need to prepare thoroughly."

A conclusion was reached.

They began to prepare for their departure. With a massive number of people to move, they had to prepare thoroughly.

And Taesan, who had been quietly listening to the conversation, opened his mouth.

"What are you guys talking about?"

"We're discussing our move. Why are you asking?"

"There's no need to go through Russia. We're going to go straight."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

“……Huh?”

They were taken aback for a moment.

Kamal Hasan, who had interpreted Taesan's words, spoke with a bewildered face.

"You mean to say that if we go in a straight line, we'll cross the Pacific Ocean?"

"That's right. We'll take the shortest route and cross the Pacific to get to the United States."

"No, that's not possible. It's the fastest way, but..."

Kim Hwi-yeon stuttered.

"What, the Pacific Ocean? The distance would be over 10,000 kilometers, and the depth would be over 10,000 meters too. Even if you're Taesan, that's impossible, right?"

The scale was different from crossing the seas between Japan and Korea.

They had to split the Pacific Ocean itself.

It was like saying they would split the world.

Taesan replied calmly.

"This time, we won't be splitting the sea, but... it's not impossible. It's not that difficult either."

"Huh..."

"No, I'm not doubting your power, but... it's hard to believe."

Everyone except for Lee Tae-yeon and Beldeukia was taken aback. They barely managed to compose themselves.

"But if what you said is true, we could save a lot of time."

"Call me when you're ready."

Taesan left the conference room.
$@$v=v1.16-rv2$@$In confusion, they sorted out the situation and spoke to the people.

We are going to cross the Pacific.

Everyone was surprised. However, the surprise soon turned into belief towards the mountain. There was hardly any resistance, except for a little worry.

After that, it was a straight path. They started moving in a straight line from the heaven and earth towards America.

[Wow! Wow! Wow!]

Monsters came out to block them.

As it was their seventh return, the monsters were very strong. There were countless B-grade monsters, and among them, there were also A-grade monsters that even hard mode players couldn't easily beat.

Everyone started the battle with their lives on the line.

And the mountain spoke.

"Velacacia, Ms. Diana. And Bardray. Move appropriately and knock down the monsters."

"What do you mean by appropriately?"

"Just make sure they don't die. They also need a life-threatening battle for themselves."

"Okay."

They moved quickly. Thousands of monsters came running from the other side. There were also several A-grade monsters among them.
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"When hard mode players were about to block it, Belzencia swung her hand.

Countless magic spells were drawn. Fire and ice, wind and earth exploded all at once.

Kwaaaang!

Thousands of monsters flew in at once.

People's eyes widened in amazement.

Diana also moved lightly, but the result was not light. Dozens of monsters were cut down at once. Bardley also swung his sword, slashing the monsters left and right.

"Wow!"

People couldn't help but exclaim at the overwhelming strength that was on a different level.

When they had a chance, Taesan used them to engage in a duel with the players in Elon mode.

Except for Lee Tae-yeon, everyone else couldn't even put up a decent resistance, but fighting against an overwhelmingly strong opponent was still a great help to them. Belzencia was also increasingly impressed by their growth in battle.

"It's considerable, isn't it? Even excluding Lee Tae-yeon, who is favored by Maria, the other three also have a chance to clear Elon mode. They'll have to take risks with their lives dozens of times, but it's not impossible."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It was different from the previous life. It wasn't just Lee Tae-yeon who could clear the Alone mode. There were about ten people who had the talent and strength to clear the Alone mode.

And they would become a great force in reclaiming the Earth.

Taesan's wishes were gradually coming true.

They arrived at the East Sea. Their destination was Japan. To head to the United States, they had to go through Japan first.

"Look over there."

Victor muttered, narrowing his eyes. As superhumans, they could see Japan across the sea.

"Can we really cross this?"

"Yes."

Aika nodded vigorously.

Taesan said,

"Freeze it."

[You have activated the Declaration of Freeze.]

Whoa!

The seawater began to freeze like cracks spreading on glass.

The cold spread further. A chilling cold enveloped them.

"Ah……."

"This is……."

All the seas visible on the horizon were freezing.

"Oh, oh, oh……."

A sound mixed with sighs flowed out.

Only the players from Japan and Jeju Island saw Taesan dividing the sea. There weren't many of them."
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"Not even they had seen the entire ocean frozen. An unimaginable power, like a divine miracle, burst forth with cheers and astonishment.

"I never thought we'd be able to walk on the ocean like this."

Victor muttered.

With cheers and reverence, they quickly crossed over to Japan.

The Japanese people, who had set foot on their homeland, were overwhelmed with emotion and kissed the ground.

People gathered various necessities as they traversed Japan. Although monsters appeared, Diana and Beldegia took care of the strong ones, so there were no major issues.

Therefore, they arrived at the end of Japan in just a few days.

"It's the Pacific Ocean."

Lee Tae-yeon muttered.

Before them lay the vast ocean.

"I don't see anything."

"The Earth is round, so it's only natural that we can't see what's on the other side of the horizon."

There was nothing visible across the sea.

Only the endless horizon stretched out.

Taesan stood before the ocean, exerting his influence over nature and declaring with strong will:

"Freeze!"

[You have activated the Declaration of Freeze.]

Zzzt!

The ocean froze. People erupted in cheers.

Let me know if you have any further requests!
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"In an instant, the entire ocean froze.

"As expected, it's Taesan-nim."

"Oooo..."

Players in Easy, Normal, and Hard modes were simply amazed and astonished. They had already seen him freeze the East Sea, so there was nothing to be surprised about.

But the strong players, including those in Hell mode, were different.

They were speechless.

Their eyes were filled with distrust and awe.

Even someone like Hasan or Viktor, who had exceptional sensing abilities, could feel the immense power.

That's why they could sense the scope of Taesan's power, even if only slightly.

Iteayeon asked with a puzzled expression, "How far did you freeze it?"

"The entire North Pacific Ocean. Since there are many people and it's a long distance, I wanted to make it safe."

Taesan replied calmly.

Iteayeon burst out laughing.

The North Pacific Ocean was enormous, rivaling the size of the Asian continent.

Taesan had frozen an area of that scale without expending much energy.

It meant that he could exert influence on a continental scale if he wanted to.

Taesan spoke as if it was no big deal."
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"It's a natural phenomenon without any will. It's not difficult to intervene."

"That's a remark that only applies to you, don't you know? I was aware of it, but... you're a real monster."

She muttered in a tone mixed with admiration.

Belvandia couldn't help but be amazed as well.

He was also someone who had reached the pinnacle of his power, someone who had touched the edge of mortality. It wasn't impossible to exert influence over an area of this scale.

However, to do so, he would have to prepare for over a year, using numerous magic circles and tools.

Even then, there was a high possibility that someone could intervene and easily disrupt it.

But Taesan took care of it with a single, casual remark.

Moreover, it didn't even seem unstable. Even if countless people walked on the frozen sea, there wouldn't be any problem.

"Is this the power of an immortal?"

In the stunned silence, Taesan moved forward.

"Then let's go."

* * *

"Whale."

Kim Hwi-yeon muttered. On the surface of the sea, a whale had its head stuck out, frozen in place.

It wasn't just the whale.

Countless fish living in the Pacific Ocean...
$@$v=undefined-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

They were all visible beneath the frozen surface of the sea.

The entire North Pacific Ocean, located between Japan and the United States, was now frozen solid.

"What is this?"

Iteayeon stuck out her tongue. She could have made a path using her items even in the East Sea, but freezing the entire Pacific Ocean was an unimaginable feat, even for her.

"Taesan, isn't it okay if there are monsters under the sea?"

"No problem."

Taesan replied. The monsters under the sea were pounding on the ice, but unless they were at the Sado level, they couldn't break the ice he had created.

They advanced through the frozen Pacific Ocean.

Latecomer monsters rushed to attack them.

[Woohoo!] [You have activated the Frozen World.]

Zzzt zzzt zzzt!

The frozen sea rose up. A cold tidal wave formed and charged forward. The monsters that had rushed in were frozen in place, unable to move.

"Taesan-nim……."

Their reverence and faith in Taesan grew even stronger.

And that faith took physical form and settled into Taesan.

[The proficiency of Divine Power has increased by 1%.]
$@$v=v1.20-rv2$@$Here is the translation of the text to English:

"My long-awaited sacred power proficiency has finally increased. Now, I'm not far from reaching 100%."

"The greatest goal of Taesan's return this time was to reach 100% of sacred power."
