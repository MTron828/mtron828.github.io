Chapter 202

202. The Crazy Person on the 50th Floor (1)

"[It'll be soon, even up to the 50th floor.]"

"There's nothing special, so it's fine, I guess."

There was nothing that could stop him. As Taesan climbed down to the 48th floor, he organized the items he had obtained one by one.

Let's exclude the items to be given away as offerings and those to be sold at the store. There weren't many.

[The armguard with a will to kill everything except its owner. It was made by a witch's whim. There is still something hidden. It has absorbed the red rose thorn and the green bamboo root.] [Attack power + 75] [Defense power + 10]

The reward for clearing the 45th floor was the green bamboo root. Since there was no special explanation, I thought of selling it at the store or using it as a material, but suddenly the armguard sprang up and absorbed the bamboo root.

Half-ran said so. It was clear that the witch had entered this place.

As I went down the floor, I would be able to find the traces of it.

And I got a few more rings.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Ring of All Men's Fury] [Strength + 100] [Agility + 100] [Attack Power + 30] [The ring has absorbed the emotions of all who have worn it. The emotions are still lingering.]

[Ring of Silent Companions] [Intelligence + 150] [Defense + 50] [Silence is considered a virtue of sages. Those who do not keep silent are not sages.]

[Ring of Soaria's Crimson] [Agility + 100] [Attack Power + 50] [Defense + 20] [This ring was worn by Soaria, who wielded a bloody sword. He killed thousands of people, and the blood dripped onto the ring.]

I have changed three rings. Now, the rings I obtained from the upper level are almost useless.

And I also got a belt.

[North's Lord's Belt] [Strength + 50] [Attack Power + 30] [Defense + 70] [The one who wears this belt can rule the entire North. In reality, most people who wore it ruled the North, and those who did not were killed without leaving a name.]

After putting on the belt, my attack power is now 1000.

Although I have not replaced my equipment with a proper one, the number is still very high. It's a satisfying reward.

I changed four things.

The rest are not very necessary, so I've replaced what I can, and sold the rest to the shop for gold.

"Ha ha ha! Hehehe!"

As Taesan passes through the layers, Valencia's emotions are becoming more and more evident.

Taesan is not interested and continues to descend the layers.
Here is the translation of the text:

As I descended, I went through one confirmation process.

"It's become useful by a lot."

[Special permanent activation skill: Twisted Spirit Regulation] [Skill level: 35%] [Twisted existences can manipulate their own spirits. By carrying a considerable burden, they can control their own spirits or the spirits they possess.]

The S-grade and apostles created by Aphrodia, whom I met on the earth.

I defeated them with spirit enhancement and greatly increased the skill level of Twisted Spirit Regulation.

Most skills change their content and effectiveness when they exceed 20%. Twisted Spirit Regulation was no exception.

Tai Shan focused his mind and shook his fingers. Suddenly, fatigue covered him, and a powerful qi surged through his fingertips.

Although I didn't use divine transformation, I was able to regulate my own qi to some extent.

Although his qi level was still low, it was not very useful, but it was a signpost for the direction of the skill. The burden I felt every time I touched the spirit also decreased.
Here is the translation of the text:

With this, I could have used the "Eclipse" skill against ordinary enemies, not just strong ones like Sado.

"It's not bad."

The Taesan summoned the Eclipse and advanced once more.

He grasped the entirety of the 48th floor and advanced. Then, he met the boss and dealt with it.

[Your level has risen.]

As Taesan's level and the monster's level have roughly matched, his level has risen significantly as well. Before entering the 41st floor, he was level 91, but now he is level 97.

[Taesan] [Level: 97] [Shield: 2109/2109] [Health: 23020/23020] [Mana: 3002/3002] [Magic: 426/426] [Strength: 5138] [Intelligence: 4474] [Agility: 4758] [Attack Power + 996] [Defense Power + 837] [Target is in the best state.]

The reward for leveling up varies depending on what you did before leveling up. Since I didn't fight a single proper battle and just defeated the mental bodies, I didn't get a large reward like before, but I still got a decent amount.

As for strength, it's now about half of Itae's. The speed was extremely fast.
Here is the translation of the text:

There was no special reward. I had thought about selling everything at the shop and handed over the emotional core to Valencia, and then arrived at the 49th floor.

[Start of 49th floor quest.] [Defeat the 49th floor boss and pass through.] [Reward: Amulet of the Sealed One] [Secret reward: ???]

The moment the mountain god put his foot down, darkness parted.

It was a demon who appeared.

[I came to tell you something.]

"Is it related to guidance?"

She appeared, and there was only one reason for her appearance. The demon nodded its head.

[They won't be waiting at the 50th floor. They've all prepared together at the 51st floor.]

"51st floor, you say? I heard you couldn't go down further than that, but it seems you're allowed to."

[It would be too one-sided a fight if you go on like that.]

Even if the 5th-ranked adventurers at the 50th floor banded together, they couldn't possibly win against the current mountain god. So, the demon must have given permission.

51st floor.

What I heard from Taeyoung was true, and if the guides were gathered together at that place, it could be quite troublesome.

"Understood."

The mountain god nodded its head. Although the confirmation is over, the demon gazed at the mountain god with a bland expression before leaving immediately.
Here is the translation of the text:

"What did he see in you?"

"What are you saying?"

"It's Aphrodite's words. I became curious because I heard him talking loudly."

Tai Shan suddenly understood the meaning of the god's words.

The gods knew that he had used the stone thrown by Uroburos to return to the past.

However, he did not know what happened during that process, what was there, and what he was dealing with.

"I'm curious. What do you have, and what did you deal with?"

"You will know later."

"If it doesn't happen that way, I'll make it happen."

The god smiled wryly.

"Just come down a little. I have something to ask you."

With that, the god disappeared.

Tai Shan began to descend the floor again.

The 49th floor was a spiritual body with a calm and serene emotion. An ordinary adventurer might have lost all their will and become a doll-like statue, scattered with emotions.

Of course, it didn't work on Tai Shan, so he cleared the floor quickly by handling everything.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Mali-ra-Baria's Wristband] [Attack Power + 65] [Defense Power + 100] [Wristband of a great adventurer who reached the end of the world. Adventuring comes with risks, and only those who have overcome all challenges can be weak.]

Except for the wristband, all other equipment and items were useless, so I had to go to the market to sell them.

Tae-san had obtained the core of emotions and went to Valencia.

He was not excited or angry, but just quietly smiled.

"Now it's the last one."

"Yes, it is."

"Do you know one thing? Great people always receive sacrifices. They take away life and spirit in exchange for greatness."

Valencia revealed this.

"Take away my last spirit. Then everything will be over."

It seemed that he had no intention of hiding anything anymore.

As expected, Tae-san went down to the 50th floor without any emotional response.

[Start of 50th Floor Quest] [Defeat the boss of the 50th floor and pass through.] [Reward: Hepineisia's Armor] [Secret Reward: ???]

Finally, it was the 50th floor.

The spirits would not appear here.

The monsters of the 50th floor were only arrogant and haughty spirits. I quickly processed and moved forward.

I obtained pure emotions by touching the pillar.

And I solved everything, including the boss.
Here is the translation of the text:

[Your level has risen.] [You have reached the 50th floor. You have obtained the title "Arrival".] [You have cleared the 50th floor perfectly. You have obtained the title "One Who Obtains Satisfaction".] [You have cleared all floors up to the 50th perfectly. You have obtained the title "One Who Approaches Perfection Gradually".] [You have descended halfway into the labyrinth. While there will be even greater challenges ahead, it is a feat that will be remembered in history. You have obtained the title "Strong and Excellent". You have obtained the special active skill "Strong and Excellent".] [Your footsteps will be followed by your descendants.]

As before, many rewards have come at once. Tae-san has confirmed the clearing rewards for the 50th floor.

[Hephesian Armor] [Strength + 100] [Defense + 130] [A armor created by the great sage who inherited the blood of the gods. It is impossible to make even a small dent in this ordinary-looking armor.]

With a high defense and moderate strength, it is better than the armor I am currently wearing, so I will wear it.

[I used ???.] [I obtained a projectile.] [Projectile] [If inserted into the target's wound, it can cause significant damage and pain.]

"It's simple."

Although it's simple, it's a good effect that can be seen at a glance. Since it says "significant damage" in the description, it means that even at the 50th floor, it can deal significant damage.

If used in combination with addition, it appears to be an item that can quickly reduce damage.
Here is the translation of the text:

Title: [Reached One]

[Halfway to the Abyss] [You have reached the halfway point to the Abyss.]

[Increased Vitality + 200] [Increased Strength + 100] [Increased Attack Power + 50] [Increased Defense Power + 50]

Title: [Satisfied with the Outcome]

[You have started to achieve satisfying results on your own.]

[Increased Strength + 100] [Increased Agility + 100] [Increased Intelligence + 100] [Increased Attack Power + 50] [Increased Defense Power + 50]

Title: [Approaching Perfection]

[You are gradually approaching perfection in your strategy.]

[Increased Vitality + 300] [Increased Mana + 100] [Increased Attack Power + 60] [Increased Defense Power + 50]

Title: [Robust and Exceptional]

[You have proven to be extremely robust and exceptional, capable of overcoming many challenges.]

[Increased Attack Power + 100] [Increased Defense Power + 100]

The effects of the titles are even better than before, and it's not surprising given the trend so far.

[Special Passive Skill: Robust One]

[You have developed an extremely high resistance to pain. You are not easily defeated and can maintain your composure in any situation. As long as your spirit remains unbroken, your physical body will not falter.]

"Is this a skill that gives an advantage in both body and spirit?"

While it may not be very useful for Taesan in terms of mental strength, it's a significant advantage in terms of physical resilience. The fact that your resistance to pain has increased is undoubtedly a good thing.

[Taesan] [Level: 99] [Shield: 2209/2209] [Vitality: 24020/24020] [Mana: 3032/3032] [Magic: 535/535] [Strength: 5450] [Intelligence: 4614] [Agility: 4938] [Attack Power + 1315] [Defense Power + 1177] [The target is in an excellent state.]

"Good."

The 100th level was within reach.
Here is the translation of the text:

Physical strength, power, intelligence, and agility all surged to new heights, and attack power suddenly skyrocketed. As expected, each time the layer's theme was cleared, it became noticeably stronger.

[Then let's take care of this messy stuff.]

Tae-san took the core and went down to the 41st floor.

There, Valencia was waiting with a worried look on his face.

"What's happened?"

"Here."

Tae-san handed over the pure emotional core. Valencia's body trembled with excitement.

"Oh, ohohoh... ohoh!"

He couldn't hold back his emotions and let out a loud shout.

"Ha, hahah!"

His emotions began to take shape. Thousands, tens of thousands of things gathered to form a massive power.

"Right! This is it! This is my power! This is where I need to reach!"

Valencia exclaimed with a distorted face from joy.

Tae-san asked with an uninterested face.

"So, can we give the reward now?"

Valencia's laughter was cut off.

"...And it turns out there's something I haven't said yet."

He smiled slyly.
Here is the translation of the text to English:

"The emotions I possess are undoubtedly great and diverse. However, I am lacking in reaching great spiritual heights. This is because the spirit requires a corresponding physical body, but my physical body is weak, to say the least."

Valencia's lips stretched out in a straight line.

"So, become a sacrifice!"

The emotions surged in like a tidal wave. The Taesan mountain directly struck the ground.

Ku-kuku-kung!

The force that swept the entire room caused the Taesan to calmly draw his sword.

"It's only natural."

It was impossible to understand. If he gathered his quest and Valencia attacked him, it was obvious.

"Take me in!"

Ku-uu-ung!

The emotions became a knife, trying to pierce through the Taesan's entire body.

The Taesan focused his energy.

Kaga-gang!

He struck down the entire emotional storm and landed on the ground, muttering to himself.

"What's interesting is that, if I kill you, what will happen to the adventurers who come to this place in the future?"

"What, what?"

"No, it's of no concern."

There was a time when a spirit had already disappeared like this. At that time, the Balbambal had come to temporarily resolve the issue.

"So, there's no problem. Die. Madman."
