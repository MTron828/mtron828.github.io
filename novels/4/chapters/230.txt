Chapter 231: 52nd Floor (2)

"Hello?"

Taesan waved his hand.

Minerva stared blankly at Taesan.

"Uh, uh?"

She looked around—a small space made of bricks, with immense powers that could be felt inside.

"Taesan?"

"We meet again."

Taesan nodded. Confusion deepened on Minerva's face.

"I shouldn't be able to be summoned by you?"

She was supposed to protect Arulia. Hence, she had signed a contract that excluded summoning when she made the pact with Taesan.

"Is this what they call a gift?"

Taesan checked the skill that had been activated when he summoned Minerva.

sytem_start

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Proxy of the Contract]

[Acts on behalf of the contract with the Spirit King, thereby handling some of the resulting powers.]

It seemed like a skill where Beatrice controlled the power used to bring Minerva here.

Realizing the situation belatedly, Minerva’s expression darkened.

“…I see now. So my mother has given you this kind of help…”

Her voice was filled with emotion.

“Haha. I thought we’d never meet again. Nice to see you.”

Minerva smiled and approached Taesan.

Taesan kept his distance as Minerva opened her arms.

“What? Why are you stepping back?”

“It was okay back then, but it’s a bit awkward now.”

The previous Minerva had the appearance of a child. But now, she looked like a mature woman, making it awkward to hug her as before.

Minerva puffed up her cheeks. Although she had become a complete Spirit King, she hadn’t matured much mentally.

Taesan stroked her hair, and she giggled happily.

“Good.”

[Your Majesty.]

“Ah. Barkaza. Hello to you too? And the ghost?”

[Hello. The contract with the Spirit King. And the summoning of the Spirit King. The sight of those deep beings would be interesting.]

The ghost chuckled.

Only then did Minerva realize where she had been summoned.

“Is this the Labyrinth?”

“Yes.”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Interesting.”

She scanned the surroundings with a hint of intrigue in her eyes, impressed by the powerful forces she sensed momentarily.

“Powerful. I cannot underestimate it.”

A Guardian of the World. In a way, there might be no being stronger than her in the entire universe.

However, in the Labyrinth, several forces felt comparable or even stronger than hers, sparking her curiosity.

“Are there also spirits here?”

“There are.”

The Fire Spirit King.

She was an enemy of Taesan. Predicting how Minerva, when facing another Spirit King, would react was difficult.

Would she show hostility as a renegade, or be confused as kin?

It seemed Minerva guessed Taesan’s concerns.

“Don’t worry. I’ve made a pact with you. No matter who the opponent is, I’m on your side. Except for my mother, that is.”

“That’s a relief.”

It didn’t seem like there would be any problems when fighting the Spirit King.

The assessment of the situation was complete.

Now it was time to get to the main topic.

“How much power can you use?”

“Um.”

Minerva groaned and raised her hand. Wind gathered there. The heavily condensed wind began to take shape and materialize.

Minerva clenched her fist.

The wind exploded and struck the Labyrinth. Taesan’s hair was wildly tousled.

“…I can’t use my full power. At best, am I around the highest level of top-grade spirits?”

[It’s natural since this guy still doesn’t have the power to fully manage a Spirit King level contract. But still, it seems to be the highest among the top-grade.]

The ghost spoke in an admiring tone.

[With just Minerva and Barkaza alone, you could break through the Labyrinth.]

“What about the constraints on summoning time?”

“My mother handles the power used during summoning. It feels like I’m reverse summoned when all that power is consumed. Conversely, if the power is managed well, I could potentially stay indefinitely?”

“That’s fine.”

Taesan nodded. It wasn’t a bad deal.

The stronger he became, the closer to her true form the power of the Spirit King would also become. Beatrice had given him a satisfactory reward.

“It doesn’t seem like I’m needed right now.”

“That’s right, for now.”

“Then I’ll be heading back. I think I’ll be quite busy for a while.”

Minerva had just been born. Naturally, she would have many tasks to attend to in Arulia.

“Alright.”

“Heh. Taesan. See you later.”

Minerva grinned and waved her hand.

The Wind Spirit King concealed herself beyond the space of the labyrinth.

Barkaza groaned.

[It feels good to be with the king, but I hope this doesn’t overshadow my own contract.]

“That won’t happen.”

Barkaza also had plenty of his own matters to attend to.

And the verification was not yet complete.

[Title: Ruler of Nature]

[A Power of the Spirit God. Recognized by Beatrice. All spirits accept your existence and affirm it. You can also exercise vast influence over nature.]

[All damage to spirits +30%]

There were three skills granting influence over nature. This overlap made it possible to control the weather.

Damage had also increased by 10%. It was a favorable change.

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Clear Mirror, Still Water]

[Proficiency: 58%]

[Unwavering mind. Immutable will. Unbreakable spirit. Immortal struggle.]

And the Clear Mirror, Still Water proficiency, which had increased tremendously as he overcame the ordeal of the high gods.

A few more sentences were added later, but the overall feeling hadn’t changed much. It felt like the power he originally had was just now being added to the content.

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Twisted Soul Tuning]

[Proficiency: 42%]

[Twisted beings can manipulate their own soul by taking on a reasonable burden. This allows them to control the power that resides within or is possessed by them, and also to adjust the soul within a certain range.]

The Twisted Soul Tuning also changed beyond 40%.

The first change was a reduction in the burden. And it became possible to adjust the spirit power of others, not just one’s own, within a certain range.

“It’s not for offense, but for defense.”

When an attack imbued with this power was launched, it could be manipulated to deflect it to some extent. Both the description and the sensed meaning suggested this.

This was a pivotal change. The adversaries against whom he couldn’t guarantee victory all wielded high spirit power, so disrupting their spirit power meant disrupting their attacks as well.

And then, there was the transformation in the crazed spirit.

[A spirit yearning for revenge has settled within. Attack power +80, +30% attack power against spirits, and +60% against Spirit Kings. Can activate spirit skills [Abandoned Blade] and [Fury of the Affirmed] against Spirit Kings.]

The attack power had increased by 50.

Furthermore, the attack power against spirits had risen by 10% and against Spirit Kings by 20%.

The skill [Fury of the Affirmed] had also been unlocked.

Overall, these enhancements were specifically designed to defeat a Spirit King.

He was eager to encounter the Fire Spirit King.

The proficiency of the concept skill had increased as well, though it wasn’t a notable change. It seemed to be reaching a point of saturation.

“So.”

This was the conclusion.

One skill remained, both eagerly awaited and somewhat disconcerting.

[Transcendence: Black]

[Proficiency: 1%]

[Consumption ??? : ???]

[?#[email protected]!! #[email protected]# @#@11.

“What could this be?”

A skill acquired while thwarting the passage of the high gods.

The power of the high gods had entered him through Soul Ascension.

The consumption was unknown, and the details were not documented.

Essentially, it was a skill shrouded in mystery.

The ghost groaned.

[Honestly, it seems quite ominous, doesn't it? It might be okay to just leave it be... but that's not a choice you'd make.]

A new card had been drawn.

Ignoring it was not an option.

Whether it would be beneficial or detrimental, he had to test it first.

Taesan activated the skill.

[You have activated Black.]

Taesan’s shadow flickered.

The moving shadow appeared to possess its own will as it advanced.

[Master?]

[Huh?]

The ghost was taken aback.

The power emanating from the quivering shadow was equal to the power he had experienced.

A shadow that consumes and corrodes everything in its path.

This power resembled that of Hazzak, who had forged a pact with the high gods.

Taesan slightly furrowed his brow. An unpleasant sensation was surreptitiously creeping into his mind. It felt as though his mind was being tainted merely by wielding it.

Taesan extinguished the shadow. The erosion that had been gnawing at his consciousness subsided.

“It’s usable, but it’s going to be challenging.”

While the erosion could be suppressed, in critical battles where a slight edge could determine victory or defeat, its use seemed problematic. Depending on the shadow’s efficiency, it was a skill that could serve as a double-edged sword.

[This is…]

And the ghost was still unable to conceal its astonishment.

That shadow was a direct ability from a high god. In essence, it was the power of the high god itself.

The fact that Taesan possessed such power without forming a contract was remarkable.

Just as the ghost was about to speak, the Labyrinth contorted.

Koogooong!

The bricks trembled. The floor elevated as power converged.

[I don't know how you entered here.]

The entity known as Balbabamba displayed hostility. A fierce murderous intent surged towards Taesan.

Barkaza quickly erected a barrier. But it shattered instantly. It was a force and fury beyond his control.

[How dare a minion of a high god tread here. I'll make you regret that arrogance…]

Balbabamba paused, gathering power, and then saw Taesan.

[...You.]

“Hello?”

Taesan waved his hand.

After a moment of silence, Balbabamba spoke.

[The power of a high god was felt here.]

“This?”

[You have activated Black.]

The shadow flickered. Witnessing Taesan wield the power of a high god, Balbabamba was rendered speechless.

[...Did you directly form a contract with a high god?]

“Hardly. Why would I strike a deal with those beings?”

[That… makes sense. Just wait a moment.]

Balbabamba’s presence intensified.

[As the administrator of the Labyrinth, I command: Reveal yourself.]

His gaze swept over Taesan.

[This is...]

And a groan escaped.

[This is… curious.]

“I’m puzzled too.”

Taesan drew his sword. Although the details were unknown, Balbabamba showed hostility towards the black power Taesan possessed.

Balbabamba shook his head.

[No need to worry. I understand the situation. I have no plans to interfere.]

“That’s a relief.”

[The power you just used belongs to the high gods. That's why I thought their minions had come. It's confusing.]

Balbabamba’s presence faded. The Labyrinth began to return to its original form.

[It’s quite strange, but since no contract has been formed, I have no plans to intervene. Continue on through the Labyrinth.]

Balbabamba’s last words echoed faintly.

[Was this what the wizard hoped for?]

His presence completely disappeared.

[That was a close call.]

[An existence I can't handle. There are such beings scattered throughout the Labyrinth.]

The ghost spoke up. Barkaza was impressed.

[You should be careful using this. Personally, I'd recommend not using it at all.]

Balbabamba had shown murderous intent towards Taesan. The gods likely would react similarly.

‘This must have been what Beatrice was talking about.’

She wouldn’t interfere, but there were those who might view it unfavorably.

Taesan was referring to the black power he had acquired.

This was the power of a high god. Unlike the indirectly gained Twisted Soul Tuning, this was the power that a high god itself possessed.

Naturally, the beings of this world would view it unfavorably.

Taesan planned to seal the black power unless it was absolutely necessary. Gods were self-centered, and just using it posed a risk of killing him.

All checks were complete.

Now, it was time to descend into the Labyrinth again.

Taesan moved forward. Barkaza, seemingly a bit excited, followed him.

[A transparent snake has appeared.]

“Barkaza.”

Koong.

Barkaza clapped his hands.

Light arose and swirled around.

The transparent snake, moving erratically to avoid it, was buried and disappeared under the light filling the room.

[He's gotten stronger too. At this rate, he could handle up to the 60th floor alone.]

[It's a blessing from the king. Also, a transparent snake that can't be sensed yet has the power equivalent to a high spirit. That's the kind of entity we're facing. Exciting. Very exciting.]

Joy was evident in Barkaza’s voice.

Engaging joyfully in combat himself, Barkaza enabled Taesan to clear the 52nd floor without lifting a finger.

They breached the secret room and confronted the boss. The boss of the 52nd floor was a transparent scorpion.

[Home.]

Koogooong!

The light surged. Being a boss, the scorpion did not fall easily. It distorted the light with its pincers and charged at Barkaza.

[Hahaha!]

Barkaza burst out laughing.

Taesan did not intervene.

Victory was naturally Barkaza’s. However, it wasn’t an easy fight and took a considerable amount of time.

[That was fun.]

Barkaza laughed, his voice more energetic than Taesan had ever heard before.

[It was definitely the right decision to follow the master. To think such a place existed.]

“Looks like you’re satisfied. That’s good.”

Taesan checked the rewards.

First, the purplish leaves obtained from the secret room were absorbed by the wrist guards, which possessed murderous intent, enhancing them.

[Murderous Intent Wrist Guards.]

[Wrist guards that seek to kill everything except their owner. Created by a witch's whim. There are still hidden aspects. It has absorbed red rose thorns, green vine roots, and cursed leaves.]

[Attack Power +125]

[Defense +10]

The attack power had increased by 50. Now, the attack power had perfectly surpassed 2000.

[Necklace of the Invisible]

[Defense +100]

[Necklace said to be used by a magician who forever concealed his appearance.]

[Wearing the necklace grants a weak invisibility state. Invisibility does not break unless the wearer attacks someone or bumps into something.]

“Oh?”

A piece of equipment that granted permanent invisibility when worn.

It was a valuable piece of equipment. The enemies Taesan faced could easily detect invisibility, so it was unnecessary for him, but it could prove very useful for various quests.

“It’s essential to have this.”

And then, the secret reward.

[You have used ???]

[You have obtained the Shoes of Leaping to the World's End.]

[Shoes of Leaping to the World's End]

[Attack Power +60]

[Defense +200]

[Agility +150]

[Movement Speed +20%]

[Action Speed +12%]

[Shoes rumored to be able to reach the world's end. Whether this is true or not remains unknown.]

[Can leap greater distances.]

[Can teleport a very short distance. This effect can only be used once per hour.]

“Blink, huh.”

They were quite impressive. Unlike random blink, he could leap to any place he desired.

The shoes he was currently wearing also had the effect of clearing status abnormalities once a day, which was quite beneficial, but it was worth switching.

Having changed all his equipment, Taesan descended to the 53rd floor.

‘I need to descend quickly.’

A lot of time had passed since his last return to Earth. From what Taesan remembered, there wasn’t much time left.

It was time for the things he had built up to be put to use.

It was about time. He planned to gain as much as possible before then.

“There’s a lot to do.”

Taesan murmured as he descended the stairs.
