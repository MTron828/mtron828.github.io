Chapter 127

“Uh, uuh?”

Kim Hwiyeon, who was in awe, was surprised in a different sense. Not only her, but also the people lying around and those who had barely managed to get up felt the same.

A tremendous power began to envelop their bodies. Kim Hwiyeon looked at her fist with widened eyes.

Squeeze.

She clenched her fist. The power transmitted to her arm. Its intensity. And a more efficient way to deliver that power.

All of that was drawn in her mind. Countless methods that she hadn’t known, or hadn’t been aware of, blossomed like fireworks.

“What is this?”

Junggeun, who was feeling a similar sensation, felt the same.

“Stats, leveling up? … It’s not that concept. This is……

Kim Hwiyeon swallowed her saliva.

It was a talent.

An innate power was descending into their bodies.

And Taesan felt it, too. Taesan grunted at the power that had settled in his body.

“This is curious.”

Taesan threw a short punch. Bang, and the air exploded.

The process of extending the fist, pulling it back, and retracting it was much faster and more accurate than before.

“Your… power?”

［You have received the blessing of the talent of [Struggle and Death] from the God］.

［It is a blessing given to only a very few of those who believe and follow me. Be grateful and respectful, mortals.］

Lakiratas spoke arrogantly. Taesan couldn’t refute that.

Squeeze.

He clenched his fist. The sensation was different. It wasn’t just that he had become faster or stronger; something more fundamental had changed.

‘Talent.’

A power that could not be acquired postnatally but was inherent from birth. That was what he had obtained.

‘With this power.’

He could become stronger. It wasn’t just that he had become stronger now; it was a power with the possibility of growth.

It was amazing. It was exciting. And that wasn’t the end.

“Is it not just me but all of humanity that has received this?”

[Yes. Originally, such power wasn't meant to be given to worthless beings like you, but it has become interesting.]

Although Lakiratas muttered this, Taesan was too astonished to even respond.

This level of divine power was given to all humanity. This wasn’t a small matter. Depending on the situation, even the players in Easy Mode could become more than twice as strong as in their previous lives.

It was certainly a happy event, but there were things he didn’t understand.

“Why?”

Lakiratas was a god. Gods disdained those they didn’t acknowledge and gave them nothing.

But to give power to all humanity. At least, it was not what Taesan had expected.

Lakiratas spoke bluntly.

[It's a contract. It's a transaction as well. Your head isn't bad. Make a guess.]

Taesan closed his mouth and started thinking. It didn’t take long to figure out the answer.

“Is it related to monsters and high gods?”

[Correct.]

The power emanating from the throne fluctuated. It seemed to ripple as if it was enjoying itself.

[They tried to cross the line. So, I made a contract.]

“…B-grade monster.”

At least it wasn’t a monster that should have appeared this early. If that had been possible, it would have expelled Taesan from this world long ago.

The fact that it wasn’t the case meant that there was something special about this time.

[You have met our expectations and triumphed magnificently. We praise you, mortal.]

Taesan looked at the throne. Lakiratas’ tone was as if they had watched their entire fight.

Lakiratas then said with a sunken gaze.

[Do not be mistaken about your enemies, mortal. We are, at the very least, not your enemies.]

“What’s going on?”

Information was needed. Why had Lakiratas descended here?

After pondering, Lakiratas was silent for a moment.

[It doesn't matter now. We created the labyrinth to see the struggle of great heroes and warriors. The high gods didn't like us for that.]

“So they went around destroying worlds.”

According to Lucifer’s words, 258 worlds had fallen into the hands of the high gods.

It must be very displeasing for the gods who took residence in the labyrinth. Lakiratas’ voice was annoyed.

[They are beings who refuse to admit defeat and struggle futilely. Those filthy beings are crumpling and trampling upon worlds that may enter the labyrinth. Did you think we would simply watch that happen?]

“So you called us there.”

The people from the worlds that were perishing without a trace called into the labyrinth because it was a pity to lose the potential of them entering.

It was somewhat expected, so there wasn’t much shock. It was just a feeling of realization.

[But... I have a question.]

The ghost, who had been silent, spoke.

[May I dare to ask you a question, O great being.] RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

[Hm.]

Lakiratas’ gaze turned to the ghost. Just that made the ghost’s body shake uneasily. It started to flicker like a TV with static.

[Your courage is noted, and I grant you permission to speak. Speak, dead one.]

[...Thank you.]

The ghost swallowed and opened its mouth.

[Even for beings like you, it would have been difficult to call all humans from a certain world.]

[Originally, yes. But they interfered and made a hole. Thanks to that, the process became easier.]

[I see... That's how it is.]

[It wasn't to hear such an insignificant story that you wished to speak. Continue.]

[According to the words of the one I am bound to, most of the people here did not enter the labyrinth. They entered a different place mimicking the labyrinth.]

Taesan realized what the ghost was trying to say.

Easy, Normal, Hard Modes, etc. People on Earth were divided into countless modes. Previously, that was taken for granted, but the thought changed as he proceeded through Solo Mode.

The real one was only the Solo Mode. The rest were all fake.

The ghost was questioning that.

[Originally, you all would have entered our world. But they interfered and made it troublesome. Imbalance arose, and dimensions warped.]

The interference of the high gods.

That seemed to have created the division of modes.

[So, it was quite annoying previously, but... at least not this time.]

Lakiratas spoke in a pleased voice.

His gaze was on Taesan.

[That's it. If you want to know more, come and find me. I will be waiting in the deep.]

“Understood.”

Taesan replied. However, Lakiratas did not disappear. His throne was still on the ground.

“What’s going on?”

As Taesan was momentarily flustered, Lakiratas spoke.

[Mortal. Become my apostle.]

“I believe I’ve declined that offer before.”

When Taesan faced an enhanced trial at Lakiratas’s altar, the god had proposed the apostle contract.

Since Lakiratas was a capricious god and he didn’t like being tied down, Taesan had refused.

[True, you did, then. But circumstances have changed. The old gods may be defeated, but they are too powerful for mortals. And the vermin are also after you. You surely don't want to perish namelessly.]

Lakiratas spoke with the arrogance of a god.

[I will grant you the honor of guarding my side. Accept it, mortal.]

[Huff.]

The ghost was surprised and gulped at Lakiratas’s words.

The reaction was concerning, but a reply was due.

“You probably know my answer.”

He had no intention of being tied down to a god. Especially when one of his goals was to become as strong as the gods. Becoming an apostle might have limitations.

[Hmm. I expected that. If you had accepted, that young one would have been agitated.]

It seemed Lakiratas had little hope.

[Still, it was fun. I look forward to your fighting spirit.]

Lakiratas’s power gradually faded. His throne began to sink into the ground.

[Oh, right.]

Lakiratas suddenly remembered something.

[You defeated that thing using a mere tool. Impressive. I was quite satisfied. Accept this gift.]

From the disappearing throne, power separated and entered Taesan.

[You have acquired the special activation skill [Apostle of Lakiratas].]

[Go back to the labyrinth and check. It'll likely help your plans.]

At the cryptic statement, Taesan laughed.

“Did you know?”

[How could I not? Still, I permit it. You may use my name.]

“Thank you.”

Taesan nodded. With Lakiratas’s permission following that of the Demon God, there seemed to be nothing holding him back.

[I hope to see more entertaining exploits, mortal.]

And then Lakiratas disappeared. His presence was no longer felt.

[Whew!]

The ghost exhaled the breath he had been holding.

[Just by his gaze, I thought I was a goner.]

“Why did you speak then?”

[Did you think I wanted to? You were curious, so I asked for you.]

The ghost grumbled. Indeed, the information he shared was vital, and Taesan was grateful.

“The modes occurred due to the interference of the high gods.”

Easy, Normal, and Hard Modes. While the specifics were unknown, it seemed all these difficulties arose from the high gods’ intervention. It didn’t seem like the gods of the labyrinth wished for it.

The ghost mumbled in an exasperated tone.

[It's funny. Lakiratas offering a mortal the position to guard his side?]

“What does that position mean?”

[Exactly what it sounds like. You'd be responsible for one of the duties of a god. It's beyond a mere apostle. It's akin to a divine entity.]

“So, becoming a god?”

[Something like that.]

There was a hint of jest in the statement, but the ghost answered seriously.

Taesan hesitated for a moment.

“Are you saying I can actually become a god?”

[It may not be a complete status, but you'll definitely be free from the confines of mortality. That's what's funny. As far as I know, only three beings have ever become one of Lakiratas's fingers since its inception… and now such an offer is being made to an adventurer who hasn't even surpassed the 50th floor?]

“A god, huh?”

Surpassing mortality to become an immortal being. It was an astonishing offer, but he wasn’t ready to accept it just yet.

“I should head back.”

Taesan returned to the battlefield. The place was filled with people in turmoil. Everyone was frantically swinging their fists, trying to understand their newfound power.

Looking around, Taesan’s eyes widened.

“Half of them survived.”

He had expected only about 20% or 30% to survive, but the number was much greater.

“What are they all doing?”

“Ah, Mr. Taesan!”

Kim Hwiyeon approached with a panicked face.

“What’s happened…? Something has settled within my body…”

“Let’s sort things out first.”

The blessings of Lakiratas won’t disappear. He could check it when they return to the labyrinth.

More importantly, there were things to be done. Kim Hwiyeon nodded in agreement, her face somber.

Two full days passed. It wasn’t until a day before their return that things were finally sorted out. Nearly half of them had perished, with the majority being from the Easy and Normal modes.

While there were also many casualties among the Hard Mode players, they managed to hold on by consistently adapting, thus minimizing their losses.

Everyone was in low spirits. The expected easy return journey had cost them nearly half of their comrades, casting a shadow over their mood.

But they didn’t succumb to despair.

Having endured numerous trials, they couldn’t dwell on the dead now. Those who survived mourned the dead, discussed the power they had each obtained, and began to debate strategies.

Taesan, along with Lee Taeyeon and Kang Junhyeok, adjusted his movements through training.

The blessing bestowed by Lakiratas. The talent of strife and death.

[God's Blessing: Talent of Strife and Death]

[Obtain all talents related to strife and death.]

It was a simple explanation, but its implications were profound.
