Winter Wonderland
0.00 / 0.00

Taesan began by checking the wand.

[Random Spirit Wand] [This is a magical wand created by chance. Even its creator does not know why it contains such magic. It can use the basic magic [Random Spirit Attack].] [Basic Magic: Random Spirit Attack] [Mana Consumption: 5] [It uses randomly disadvantageous mental magic on the target. Attempts to induce a status abnormality on the target.]

It was a wand in the truest sense and casted adverse mental magic, such as confusion, curse, madness, and others, on the target. The randomness was a concern, but it wasn’t a major downside since the spells were only within the frame of disadvantageous effects.

Then, the 2nd floor’s clear reward: a basic mana increase potion.

[Beginner's Mana Increase Potion] [A liquid containing the power of mana. Drinking it will increase your mana.]

Taesan immediately drank it.

[Your mana permanently increases by 10.]

It was a satisfying increase. Now, Taesan’s mana was at 41. By simple calculation, he could use the Flow skill nearly eight times.

“Good.”

Now, for the remaining reward: ???.

“What is this?”

Since it was a reward for clearing a secret element of the level, it should be better than the clear reward. Taesan checked the reward with anticipation.

[You used ???.] [You have obtained the Despicable Thief's Tool.]

A tool that looked like a lockpick appeared in Taesan’s hand. He was momentarily confused, as he had assumed the reward would be related to stats.

“What’s this?”

[Despicable Thief's Tool] [It's a tool only possessed by despicable individuals. If lost, you'll likely be abandoned by your comrades.] [It attempts to disarm traps and unlock locks.]

“Oh?”

Taesan was surprised. It was equipment that aided in disarming traps and unlocking locks.

“I didn’t expect to get this.”

There were traps that needed to be triggered no matter what.

They were a type of guaranteed trap. Without a tool like this, he would have had to reluctantly give up on the reward behind it. Moreover, boxes with traps and locks would gradually start to appear starting from the 5th floor. If he had this tool, it would be possible to attempt to disarm them.

It was an extremely good item. Plus, using this tool could also lead to gaining skills in trap detection and lock unlocking.

Though it didn’t have a direct combat advantage, it could prove useful for making progress in the labyrinth. The ghost grumbled.

[You're really getting everything.]

“Why are you so dissatisfied?”

[Would a dead person be happy to see a living person achieve things?]

“Well, when you put it that way.”

Taesan agreed with the ghost’s valid point.

The ghost was someone similar to him, but had failed at conquering the labyrinth. Watching Taesan gradually make progress in the labyrinth could stir up a lot of emotions.

Anyway, the verification was complete.

Taesan headed towards the passageway leading downwards. As he descended the passageway, a quest window appeared.

[3rd Floor Quest Start.] [Defeat the boss of the 3rd floor and proceed.] [Reward: Beginner's Health Increase Potion.] [Secret Reward: ???]

A Beginner’s Health Increase Potion. It was an item that increased your health by 50 points.

Just like the Mana Increase Potion, it was a very good item. After checking, Taesan opened the door where the dwarf was waiting for him.

“Oh. You’re here?”

“I am.”

The dwarf, who had greeted him with a happy face, suddenly frowned.

“…What?”

[Isn't that the old fogey? He's still alive, not dead yet?]

The ghost chuckled as the dwarf clicked his tongue.

“You’ve accepted the quest.”

[He accepted it. That's why I'm here. Are you blind?]

Ignoring the ghost’s words, the dwarf spoke to Taesan.

“That one’s just a noisy loser. Don’t let it bother you.”

[An old man who can only pray is boasting.]

They were both acting antagonistic to each other. If the dwarf’s reaction to the ghost was indifference and scorn, then the ghost’s was hostility, criticism, and mockery.

[But, can the old man tell me what not to bother with? It seems quite valuable, this one.]

The ghost spoke playfully.

[Why don't you try touching it? I want to see the old man go crazy.]

“You? Touch that?”

The dwarf chuckled as Taesan waved his hand.

“Both of you, stop squabbling and focus on me, the main character.”

“Ah, sorry. That loser kept making a fuss.”

The dwarf apologized obediently. As expected, the dwarf was very friendly to him.

“There’s no way you’ll be influenced by that guy. Do you want to buy something?”

“Not yet.”

He hadn’t collected enough money. He was planning to roam around the third floor and come back.

“Then, see you next time. And if possible, get rid of that thing.”

[Heh.]

The ghost snorted. As they exited the shop and entered the third floor, Taesan asked,

“Why don’t you two get along?”

[How can we? That old man is so sinister and stupid.]

His voice was filled with animosity.

[You should be careful too. The old man treats you well if he thinks you're beneficial, but he can turn on you at any time. You can't trust him.]

“Is this a story from when you were alive?”

[Or after I bit the dust?]

If he was alive, then it must have been when he was navigating the labyrinth. It must have been a situation similar to Taesan’s current one.

Someone he could not trust. The ghost described the shop owner in this way. Taesan entered the labyrinth.

“Kyaak!”

“Keee!”

Just like on the second floor, four goblins were waiting.

The second and third floors of the Solo Mode overlapped, and the types of monsters that appeared were the same.

The only difference was that instead of goblins using bows, there were goblins using magic here.

“Kyaak!”

[A goblin holding a staff has cast a Confusion spell.] [No judgment required! You withstand with your indomitable spirit.] [All stats have increased.]

Taesan drew his sword nonchalantly.

Three minutes later, only Taesan and the ghost remained in the room.

“The third floor is easier than the second.”

[I'd like to refute that, but you're right, so I have nothing to say.]

The ghost grumbled.

[Should've been tough here, you know? I almost died here several times, yet you passed it just like that.]

The ghost was not wrong. The goblins here used illusion magic. Plus, there had been three goblin guards.

It was difficult to go past three guards, and dealing with them one by one opened the chance to be afflicted by a confusion judgment. In a way, it was like a deadlock.

However, Taesan was half immune to mental abnormalities. It was even easier than on the second floor since it was as if one goblin was missing in the fight.

Taesan casually started to break through the labyrinth. He moved to another room and dealt with the goblins. This time, it took two minutes.

[Oh my.]

The ghost, who had been quietly watching, marveled at this.

[Watching you, your movement is pretty good. The techniques learned in real battle have clear limits, but you cover them with your sense and observation. ……I think you can reach the middle floors without any problems.]

He didn’t intend to be satisfied with just the middle floors.

He planned to clear the whole thing.

Taesan kept roaming the labyrinth while hunting goblins. The ghost, finding it strange, asked.

[Why are you killing all of them? With your current level, they won't give you much experience. Isn't it better to just descend quickly?]

The ghost was not wrong.

Though they only gave a small amount of experience, with Taesan’s current stats, he could easily handle the fourth and fifth floors.

Any experience boost was also limited due to the gap in levels, so the only things he could gain were money and equipment.

Taesan answered flatly.

“Because there’s a quest.”

[A quest? What more could you possibly have to take now?]

“Lakiratas.”

[Huh?]

The ghost paused.

[That guy gives out such quests? This is the first time I've heard of this.]

“Did you also go through the trial?”

[I did. And I cleared it without any issues.]

The ghost boasted. Now that he mentioned it, Taesan was curious. As he killed a goblin, he asked,

“What is Lakiratas’ Servant?”

[That is quite literally his servant. It's when the lowly ones offer themselves to Lakiratas to become stronger. The price is eternal enslavement, but some are content with that.]

The ghost spoke as if he couldn’t comprehend it.

[Still, they do become strong. If it's real and not fake, you need to get past at least the 5th floor to stand a chance against them. Maybe they think it's worth dedicating their pitiful lives?]

From the ghost’s story, it didn’t seem like the trial had suddenly become harder. Still, he seemed well-informed about Lakiratas, given that he made it to the deeper levels.

Taesan asked,

“Do you know what an ‘Apostle’s Contract’ is?”

[Huh?]

The ghost asked in surprise.

[How do you know about that?]

“Lakiratas proposed it to me.”

[... He proposed it to you?]

The ghost closed his mouth, seemingly quite flustered. He seemed to ponder for a moment but soon opened his mouth again.

[You're strong enough to receive the proposal now. Hmph. I didn't get it.]

The ghost grumbled.

[Where should I start explaining?]

“You’re willing to explain?”

The dwarf was reluctant to discuss the contract. He expected a slight refusal even though they had a bet, but this was unexpected.

[I'm already a dead man! I am bound by rules, but there is no restriction on information. And if the old man doesn't tell you, it's also for your sake. It's a shoddy, half-hearted consideration.]

The ghost chuckled.

[Why should I care about you? We'll part ways on the 10th floor anyway.]

The ghost wasn’t on his side, but that was better. Frankly, he didn’t need the dwarf’s consideration.

What he needed was information. About this place, the NPCs’ goals, and who the gods were.

The ghost began to answer his questions.

[Each god is in charge of their own realm. Some are in charge of victory, others are in charge of defeat, and so on. Among them, Lakiratas is the god of struggle and death. And he is also the strangest god.]

“Strange?”

[Despite being a god, he behaves very lightly. He breaches contracts as he pleases and tries to help those he likes by even draining his own power. He is like a child, I suppose? But he is incredibly strong and suppresses any rebellion. He's a difficult god to describe.]

As he listened to the explanation, he became curious.

“What are gods?”

At least they were not the same as the gods that were known on Earth. Judging from the ghost’s words, there seemed to be at least dozens of them.

[Those who helped design the labyrinth.]

“Design?”

[Do you remember the system window you saw when you entered here?]

Taesan tried to recall it.

“……A labyrinth created by a wizard.”

[This place is a labyrinth created long ago by a great wizard. It is rumored that a wish is granted to anyone who conquers it.]

A labyrinth created by a great wizard. That’s what this place is.

[But it would be hard to create it alone. The wizard sought out the transcendent ones and shared his plan. He wanted to create a grand labyrinth, a tower leading underground. He wanted to invite countless warriors and heroes to break through it. Didn't they want to witness their challenges, their struggles wagering their lives, and their fleeting deaths?]

“They must have liked it.”

[Liked it? They went absolutely wild. They supported the wizard wholeheartedly. This place, the labyrinth, was designed after a significant time, even for the gods.]

It was a bigger story than he thought. The ghost finished talking.

[And the gods took their place in this labyrinth, which they had painstakingly created. They judged those who entered the labyrinth from the depths, the lower layers. They imposed trials, granted visions, and evaluated worth. And among them, a proposal to those who particularly caught their fancy. That is the Apostle's Contract.]L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
