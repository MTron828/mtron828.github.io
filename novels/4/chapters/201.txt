Chapter 202: 50th Floor, The Insanity Of A Madman (1)

[Reaching the 50th floor won't take long.]

If theres nothing out of the ordinary, thats likely.

Nothing could deter him. Taesan organized the items he had acquired while making his way down to the 48th floor.

Excluding those meant for tributes and those destined for sale at the shop, there werent many left.

[A wrist guard imbued with murderous intent.]

[A wrist guard that seeks to kill everything except its owner. Crafted on a whim by a witch. Yet, something hidden lies within. It has consumed a red rose thorn and a green vine root.]

[Attack Power: +75]

[Defense: +10]

The reward for clearing the 45th floor was a green vine root. Since it lacked a specific description, he considered offering it to the shop or using it as a crafting material, but then, the wrist guard suddenly rose and devoured the vine.

Hafran had mentioned it. Theres a definite chance that a witch had entered the labyrinth in the past.

As he descended further, he might uncover signs of her presence.

He also acquired a few more rings.

[Ring filled with everyone's rage]

[Strength: +100]

[Agility: +100]

[Attack Power: +30]

[This ring harbors the feelings of rage towards its wearer from everyone. It contains remnants of such emotions.]

[Ring of one who embraced silence]

[Intelligence: +150]

[Defense: +50]

[Silence is considered the virtue of the wise. In other words, those who do not keep silent are not deemed wise.]

[Somaria's red ring]

[Agility: +100]

[Attack Power: +50]

[Defense: +20]

[Ring of Somaria, who wielded a blood-red sword. The blood of thousands slain flowed down the sword, imbuing the ring.]

He replaced three rings. Now, the rings obtained from the higher floors that lacked any special effects were almost entirely swapped out.

He also managed to acquire a belt.

[Belt worn by the master of the north]

[Strength: +50]

[Attack Power: +30]

[Defense: +70]

[It is said that the wearer of this belt can dominate the entire north. In reality, most who wore it did rule the north. And those who did not, perished without leaving their names in history.]

Wearing the belt, his attack power had soared to nearly 1000.

Even without substituting it for a proper weapon, the figure was impressively high. The rewards were gratifying.

Four items underwent such transformation.

The rest, deemed somewhat unnecessary, were either offered up or sold at the shop for gold when they couldnt be presented as tributes.

Heheheh! Heek!

As Taesan conquered each floor, Valencias madness intensified with every emotion transmitted.

Taesan continued his descent, indifferent.

With each level, he underwent a verification process.

Its become much more usable.

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: Twisted Soul Tuning]

[Proficiency: 35%]

[Twisted beings can manipulate their own soul in a twisted manner. This allows control over one's own or possessed spirit energy at the cost of bearing a significant burden.]

The S-class and apostles he encountered on the Earth created by Aphrodia.

Defeating them with Soul Ascension significantly increased the proficiency of Twisted Soul Tuning.

Most skills evolved and enhanced their effects once they surpassed 20% proficiency. Twisted Soul Tuning was no exception.

Taesan focused and energized his fingers. Instantly, he was hit by a wave of fatigue, accompanied by a powerful force at his fingertips.

Even without resorting to Apostle Transformation, he had become capable of tuning his soul to some extent.

Although his soul seemed somewhat limited due to its low level, it indicated the skills potential direction. The burden felt when engaging with spirits had also diminished.

This meant that it was now possible to use soul tuning against not just formidable enemies like apostles but also against ordinary foes.

Not bad.

Taesan reclaimed his soul and pressed on.

He mastered everything on the 48th floor and proceeded, confronting the boss.

[Your level has increased.]

As Taesans level and the monsters levels had somewhat aligned, his level also rose to a decent extent. Before entering the 41st floor, it was 91, but now it was 97.

[Kang Taesan]

[Level: 97]

[Protection: 2109/2109]

[Health: 23020/23020]

[Mana: 3002/3002]

[Magic: 426/426]

[Strength: 5138]

[Intelligence: 4474]

[Agility: 4758]

[Attack Power: +996]

[The target is in the best condition.]

The rewards for leveling up depend on the actions taken up to that point. Since he had defeated the spirits without a proper battle, he didnt receive as large a reward as before, but still gained a significant amount.

Now, his strength was nearly half that of Lee Taeyeons. It was an incredibly fast pace.

There were no special rewards. Thinking of selling everything at the shop, he handed the core of emotions to Valencia and arrived at the 49th floor.

[Start of the 49th-floor quest.]

[Defeat the boss of the 49th floor and pass through.]

[Reward: The Regalia of Those Submerged in Darkness]

[Secret Reward: ???]

The moment Taesan stepped onto the 49th floor, the darkness split apart.

The Demon God appeared.

[I've come to tell you something.]

Is it about the Guides?

There was only one reason for her appearance. The Demon God nodded.

[They won't be waiting on the 50th floor. On the 51st floor, everyone has finished preparing together.]

The 51st floor? I heard its not possible to go any lower than the hierarchy, but it seems youve allowed it.

[It would be too one-sided otherwise.]

The adventurers of the 5th hierarchy, even if they banded together, could not overcome Taesan as he was now. So, the Demon God must have permitted it.

The 51st floor.

What Lee Taeyeon had said was true, and if the Guides were indeed gathered there, it could become quite troublesome.

Understood.

Taesan nodded. The verification was complete, but instead of leaving immediately, the Demon God gazed intently at Taesan.

[What did that one see in you?]

What do you mean?

[Aphrodia. My curiosity was piqued after hearing that one's incessant ramblings.]

Taesan grasped the meaning behind the Demon Gods words.

The gods were aware that he had utilized the Ouroboros stone to travel back in time.

However, they were oblivious to the specifics of that process, what he encountered, or the challenges he faced.

[I'm intrigued. What you hold and what you've endured.]

Youll discover in due time.

[So it shall be. If not, I shall ensure it.]

The Demon Gods smile was faint.

[Come down a bit further. I have a request for you.]

With those words, the Demon God vanished.

Taesan resumed his descent.

The 49th floor emanated a spirit of serene emotions. Any average adventurer might lose all motivation and remain motionless like a doll, their emotions dissipating.

Of course, this had no effect on Taesan, who swiftly conquered the floor.

[Malira-Variya's Bracelet]

[Attack Power + 65]

[Defense + 100]

[This bracelet belonged to a legendary adventurer who ventured to the world's end. Adventure entails risks, and only the truly formidable can conquer them all.]

Aside from the bracelet, the remaining equipment and items were of no value, destined either for tribute or sale.

Taesan collected the core of emotions he had amassed and sought out Valencia.

This time, he did not burst into laughter but offered a quiet smile instead.

This is the final time.

Yes.

Do you understand? The eminent ones always demand offerings. They seize life and spirit in return for their magnificence.

Valencia showed his teeth.

Bring me the last spirit. Then, all will be concluded.

Anticipating this, Taesan proceeded to the 50th floor without much sentiment.

[Beginning of the 50th-floor quest.]

[Defeat the boss of the 50th floor and proceed.]

[Reward: Armor of Hephaesia]

[Secret Reward: ???]

At last, he had reached the 50th floor.

No spirits would appear beyond this point.

The monsters on the 50th floor were spirits consumed by nothing but arrogance and pride. He swiftly dispatched them and continued forward.

He touched a pillar and was flooded with pure emotions.

Then, he resolved everything up to the boss.

[Your level has increased.]

[You have reached the 50th floor. You've obtained the title [The One Who Reached].]

[You have perfectly cleared the 50th floor. You've obtained the title [The One Who Takes Satisfaction].]

[You have perfectly understood and cleared all floors up to the 50th floor. You've obtained the title [The One Getting Closer to Perfection].]

[You have descended nearly half of the Labyrinth. More challenges await you, but it's a significant achievement that will be remembered in history. You've obtained the title [The Strong and Outstanding One]. You've obtained the special continuous activation skill [The Strong One].]

[Your footsteps will be followed by those who come after you.]

Just like before, numerous rewards arrived all at once. Taesan first checked the clear rewards for the 50th floor.

[Armor of Hephaesia]

[Strength + 100]

[Defense + 130]

[Armor created by a blacksmith rumored to have inherited the blood of gods. Not even a dent can be made on this ordinary-looking black armor.]

With its high defense and decent strength stats, it was superior to the armor he was currently wearing, so he equipped it immediately.

[Used ???]

[Gained a Wedge.]

[Wedge]

[When inserted into the target's wound, it can cause tremendous damage and pain.]

Simple.

Simple yet evidently effective. The description mentioned tremendous damage, indicating it could inflict significantly high damage even by the 50th floors standards.

Paired with Addition, it seemed like an item capable of dealing instant fatal damage.

[Title: The One Who Reached]

[The one who has arrived at the halfway point of the Labyrinth.]

[Health + 200]

[Strength + 100]

[Attack Power + 50]

[Defense + 50]

[Title: The One Who Takes Satisfaction]

[You have begun to achieve satisfactory outcomes for yourself.]

[Strength + 100]

[Agility + 100]

[Intelligence + 100]

[Attack Power + 50]

[Defense + 50]

[Title: The One Getting Closer to Perfection]

[You are meaningfully approaching a perfect conquest.]

[Health + 300]

[Mana + 100]

[Attack Power + 60]

[Defense + 50]

[Title: The Strong and Outstanding One]

[You have proven to be incredibly strong and outstanding, enough to overcome many challenges.]

[Attack Power + 100]

[Defense + 100]

The effects of the titles were better than those at the 40th floor. This was somewhat expected, given the trend up to this point.

[Special Continuous Activation Skill: The Strong One]

[Your resistance to pain has significantly increased. You will not easily fall and can maintain your composure in any situation. As long as your spirit does not break, your body will not fall.]

A skill that provides an advantage to both mind and body.

While the mental aspect was not of much use to Taesan, the physical aspect was different. There were moments when his movements would pause momentarily due to pain, so increased resistance was definitely beneficial.

[Kang Taesan]

[Level: 99]

[Shield: 2209/2209]

[Health: 24020/24020]

[Mana: 3032/3032]

[Magic: 535/535]

[Strength: 5450]

[Intelligence: 4614]

[Agility: 4938]

[Attack Power: +1315]

[Defense: +1177]

[The target is in optimal condition.]

This is good.

Level 100 was within reach.

Health, strength, intelligence, and agility all increased significantly, and attack power surged as well. Indeed, he became noticeably stronger with each set theme was cleared.

[Now it's time to deal with that nagging issue.]

Taesan collected the core and went down to the 41st floor.

There, Valencia, who was waiting anxiously, brightened up at his arrival.

How did it go?

Here.

Taesan handed over the pure core of emotions. Valencia trembled with emotion.

Oh, ohhhh OHHH!

Unable to contain his emotions, he screamed loudly.

Ha, hahaha!

The emotions began to materialize. Thousands, tens of thousands of them gathered, forming a massive force in themselves.

Yes! This is it! This is my power! This is where I must reach!

Valencia exclaimed, his face twisted in joy.

Taesan asked, his face showing no interest.

Then, I suppose its time for my reward.

Valencias laughter abruptly stopped.

Come to think of it, theres something I didnt tell you.

He grinned slyly.

The emotions I possess are indeed great and varied. However, theyre insufficient to reach a great spirit. Because a spirit needs a corresponding body, and my body is too frail.

Valencias smile tore wider.

So, youll become the sacrifice!

Emotions surged like a wave. Taesan immediately stomped the ground.

Boom!

With the entire room swirling with force, Taesan calmly drew his sword.

I thought as much.

It was too obvious. As Taesan collected the quests, it was clear Valencia would attack him.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Be devoured by me!

Woosh!

Emotions turned into blades, attempting to pierce through Taesans entire body.

Taesan concentrated his spirit.

Clash!

He knocked down all the pouring emotions and landed on the ground, murmuring.

I wonder, if I kill you, what happens to the adventurers who come here after?

What, what?

Never mind, it doesnt matter.

There had been instances where spirits disappeared before. Balbambamba showed up temporarily to fix it then.

Then theres no issue. Die, madman.
