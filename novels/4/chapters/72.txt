He had a goal, but nothing would change.

As Maria said, he was in a very weak state right now. He hadn’t learned multiplication yet, not even addition, the essence strike, or copying.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

So he would descend.

Deeper.

To a place where he could become stronger.

“But before that.”

He hadn’t checked what he had gained from the sudden invitation. He checked Maria’s reward first.

[Shape Changing Weapon] [Attack + 15] [Selectable weapon.] [It can transform into the form of a dagger or a long sword.]

It had decent attack power and was attached to a special ability. Taesan immediately checked it. The weapon changed into a short dagger and then transformed into a normal-looking longsword.

He could use it as two different weapons. The attack power seemed to not change even when the shape changed.

Taesan, who had finished checking the weapon, checked his new skill next.

[Special Activation Skill: Freedom of Choice] [Mana Consumption: 20] [Proficiency: 1%] [It is possible to convert stats. The ratio doesn't seem to be very high yet.]

Stat conversion. It was something he hadn’t seen yet. Taesan immediately experimented.

The possible conversion ratio was 10%. Agility, Strength, Intelligence, Health, Mana, Shield, Attack, and Defense could be converted among each other. It seemed impossible to convert two types at the same time.

“Not bad.”

Changing around his stats could be important, depending on the situation. There were times when health was of no value, while there were other times when defense had no value.

Those meaningless stats could be changed to important ones as necessary. The effective ratio was only 10% now, but the ratio would rise further as proficiency rose.

Eventually, it might be possible to convert 100%. Depending on how it was used, it was a useful skill.

“She gives rewards as promised.”

Maria’s reward wasn’t the only thing. As difficult as Maria’s trials were, additional rewards could be obtained.

First, there were skills that had significantly increased in proficiency.

[Special Activation Skill: Breathless Attack] [Mana Consumption: 2] [Proficiency: 21%] [It allows movements that ignore breathing during combat. Currently, it only lasts for about 20 seconds. The fatigue of muscles decreases.]

The Breathless Attack skill, which he had been using tirelessly, finally passed 20% proficiency and added the content that the fatigue of muscles decreases.

The Breathless Attack was tiring because the movements became more intense as breathing was ignored. It was a good change that alleviated this fatigue.

[Special Always-on Skill: View Expansion] [Proficiency: 80%] [You can obtain a wide field of view. It has greatly exceeded the human category.]

View Expansion was quickly rising, almost reaching 100%.

Most skills change dramatically the moment they hit 100%. It was safe to say they became entirely different skills from what they used to be.

It might be possible to reach 100% at this speed before breaking through the 20th floor. With a little hope, Taesan checked the other skills.

Perhaps due to the endless fights, he was able to learn a new skill.

[Your mind is out of sync with the flow of time. You've obtained the Special Activation Skill [Mind Acceleration].]

‘I’ve been feeling like time was a bit off.’

During Maria’s trials, the enemies and his own movements seemed generally slower than expected.

Mind Acceleration. In Easy Mode, there were not many occasions to fight intensely enough for the time in his mind to twist to that extent, so he could not learn this skill in his previous life.

[Special Activation Skill: Mind Acceleration] [Mana Consumption: 8] [Proficiency: 1%] [Accelerates the mind. The flow of time twists very slightly. It seems like it can only be used for 10 seconds at this point.] [You have activated Mind Acceleration.]

He used the skill, but nothing seemed to change.

Taesan raised his arm.

‘Slow.’

The speed at which his arm moved felt strangely slow. His mind was moving faster than the time outside. It was a very subtle difference, but it was a definite difference.

‘So this is the skill.’

Having more time to think during combat was equivalent to increasing the chances of winning. The value would increase more and more as proficiency was raised. Its usefulness could just be below a main skill.

As he learned each of these things, he became stronger. At that moment, Taesan finished checking and was about to move.

There was something in his pocket.

“What’s this?”

It was a tiny flower-shaped ornament. Its seven petals were colorful like a rainbow.

[Maria's Gift] [A gift given to a human loved by the gods. Currently, it has no effects.]

“Ghost?”

[Uh, what?]

“What is this?”

[Uh...... It's the first time I'm seeing it too.]

The ghost also didn’t know.

“It won’t be bad.”

It would be an item given in goodwill, so Taesan put it back in his pocket.

Finally, Taesan moved.

He killed the monsters he encountered and found the secret room. He disarmed traps and collected rewards.

In the process, his proficiency in Trap Disarmament reached 20%.

[Special Activation Skill: Trap Disarmament] [Mana Consumption: 1] [Proficiency: 20%] [Attempts to disarm traps. There seems to be a low chance of success.]

Although it didn’t mean much, it felt good.

The reward for the secret room was a pair of fine leather gloves.

[Powerful Gloves] [Attack Power +5] [Defense Power +3] [The best gloves made by a famous craftsman. They are strong enough to block even sword strikes.]

“It’s been a while since I’ve changed gloves.”

He changed his equipment and headed towards the boss room.

[A Less Rotten Ghoul has appeared.]

It was quite a straightforward name. As the name implied, the ghoul still had red flesh left and bared its teeth. Taesan scrunched up his face.

“It smells.”

Swoosh.

He swung his fist.

The ghoul was knocked to the ground.

He stepped on it repeatedly until it disappeared with a scream.

[You have defeated the Less Rotten Ghoul.]

The boss of the 12th floor. If it were Lee Taeyeon or Kang Junhyeok, they would have literally fought for their lives and barely won.

However, for him, it was too easy. He didn’t feel even a slight crisis.

That dissatisfaction was felt by Taesan.

“It’s too easy.”

He had become far too strong for the floor he was on. The only way he could feel difficulty was by meeting a Trial of God or a Named monster.

He naturally missed out on most of the benefits that came with encountering a boss on equal terms.

First of all, he didn’t get any real reward for defeating the boss. Furthermore, Soul Ascension also did not properly work. These were things he couldn’t gain because he was too strong.

That made Taesan feel regretful.

He wouldn’t have thought much of it if it had been before. Even if he couldn’t take care of such small details, clearing the levels would be no problem. However, if he was now aiming for the gods, he had to take in as much as he could.

“I wonder if there’s a way.”

As there was no particular method yet, he had no choice but to descend.

Of course, it wasn’t like he gained nothing. The Soul Ascension effect, though small, had worked, and his level had risen by two from clearing the floors, making him now level 28. He could still achieve significant stat increases.

The clear rewards for the 12th floor and the secret rewards were magic-related.

Thinking that he wouldn’t particularly need them, he went to Lilis. She greeted Taesan with sparkling eyes.

“I’ve been waiting for you to come! Did you bring it?”

“Here.”

When Taesan handed the items over, she excitedly took them and checked. Soon she showed a satisfied smile.

“This should do it! Finally, I, too!”

She was going to learn basic magic. Her pupils gleamed at that fact.

As she muttered something, the magical items disappeared. They were offered as a sacrifice. After praying with her eyes closed for a moment, she opened them with a flash.

“I did it!”

Unable to contain her joy, she jumped around the room.

“Now I can learn one basic magic! Yahoo! Finally!”

“Aren’t you being too noisy?”

“Basic magic! Basic magic! It’s worth that much!”

“Well…”

To him, who had created the Blazing Orb and Frost Arrow, it didn’t seem that significant. Recognizing Taesan’s reaction, Lillis pouted.

“People risk their lives to learn this…”

“So, what can you learn?”

At Taesan’s question, Lilis composed herself and put a finger on her lips.

“First of all, you aren’t allowed to choose. The gods decide and bestow it.”

“So there’s no choice.”

He nodded calmly, as he had expected this.

“Then let me learn.”

“Okay. Just wait a moment.”

She closed her eyes again and murmured something. A force descended on her from the void.

‘Is that the power of magic?’

It was a wave of mana so strong that even Taesan could sense it. Lilis opened her eyes.

“I’ve learned it.”

“Which one is it?”

“It’s a status effect magic. I’ll let you know which magic it is when you learn it. Let’s postpone the fun for later.”

As she spoke, a constant smile was on Lilis’s face. The ghost asked with a smile of his own.

[Is it really that good?]

“Good or not, it’s basic magic! I struggled to learn Invisibility, but I easily learned one this time! Thank you so much!”

Lilis spread her arms wide, intending to hug Taesan. Taesan distanced himself, and she fell to the ground.

“Ouch!”

“What the hell are you doing all of a sudden?”

“Uh… I wanted to express my joy.”

Taesan chuckled softly.

“No need for that. I’ll come back when I have more offerings next time.”

“Mmm. See you again!”

She said goodbye with a shaky smile.

Taesan went down to the 13th floor.

[13th floor quest start.] [Defeat the boss of the 13th floor and pass.] [Reward: Ring of Severance.] [Secret Reward: ???]

He didn’t have enough money to use the store. The dwarf also looked sullen, as if there was nothing else to bet on besides penalty play. He arrived at the 13th floor without much conversation.

The 13th floor was a zombie den. Like goblins, they attacked in large numbers, but each individual was weak. While roughly fending them off and breaking through, he felt a presence.

As Taesan was about to crush a zombie’s head, he paused. His presence detection sense had activated sharply. Someone was approaching him from beyond the door.

Soon, as the door opened, the presence revealed itself.

“Ugh. Annoying. How long do I have to patrol…”

A man with red hair and a bold face appeared. He saw Taesan, and his pupils dilated.

“Oh, what?”

“Hello.”

Crack.

Taesan smashed the zombie’s head and spoke. The man stammered at Taesan, looking perplexed.

“Oh, hello?”

[Your detection skill has been activated.] [Levabas Aita] [Level: 42]

Level 42. He was 14 levels higher than Taesan.

“Uh… are you new? I was surprised. It’s been so long.”

Levabas scratched his cheek, looking at Taesan, then his gaze fell on the ghost. Levabas’s face twisted.

The ghost sneered.

[Piss pants. You're still alive?]

“… Why are you here?”

Levabas frowned at the ghost.
