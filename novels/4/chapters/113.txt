Chapter 114: Twenty Fourth Level, Guides Of Sin (3)

The approaching presence caused Taesan to lift his head.

“Hello?”

“He’s younger than I thought.”

“Appearances don’t mean much, but… he does look young. Barely twenty, maybe?”

The Guides of Sin assessed Taesan with a relaxed attitude.

Taesan counted their number.

After the four, no one else was visible.

“Just four of you?”

He thought all the guides of the third hierarchy would come.

Considering that Taesan had defeated Jagan when he was on the second hierarchy and that Horian was also dead, it would have been the right decision for them all to come. But just four?

[They've been stuck here for decades. Maybe in the past… but now their strength has all faded.]

“I thought everyone would come… does it not matter?”

Whether there were many or few, it didn’t matter to him. The woman awkwardly waved her hand.

“Um… hero. Hello?”

[Pleasant, but we aren't supposed to greet, are we?]

“Yeah, you’re right.”

The eyes of the awkwardly smiling guides started to sink.

In an instant, the atmosphere became tense. Taesan drew his sword.

[You have activated Reconnaissance.]

［Hajing Roya］

［Level: 65］

［HP: 3165］

［Equipped Weapon: Spear］

［The Subjugated］

A man with brown hair and an Arabic appearance, holding a trident, was staring at Taesan.

［Baben Ruata］

［Level: 65］

［HP: 2995］

［Equipped Weapon: Dagger］

［The Subjugated］

A man in black attire clinging to his whole body, not holding any weapon. He looked like a rogue.

［Arinesia Clieus］

［HP: 2350］

［Equipped Weapon: Staff］

［The Subjugated］

The only woman among them. With her long blue hair and holding a staff, she looked like a mage.

［Casian］

［HP: 2991］

［Equipped Weapon: Bow］

［The Subjugated］

And lastly, an archer.

Roles were clearly distributed. Taesan shrugged his shoulders, activating his whole body’s muscles and beginning the awakening of his mind.

“No need for lengthy talk, right?”

“Of course.”

With the reply, Taesan stepped forward.

[You have activated Walking the Wind Path of the Deer.]

[You have activated Acceleration.]

It was an incredibly fast speed. They were startled by the approach that greatly exceeded their expectations.

However, they were adventurers on the 30th floor. They quickly started responding. The mage shook her staff.

[Arinesia has activated Madness.]

[No judgment needed!]

“What, what?”

The madness was repelled. Casian shot his bow. It was a speed and power suitable for the 30th floor.

Taesan didn’t dodge but manipulated the wind. The gathered wind altered the trajectory of the arrow. The arrow didn’t even graze him and passed by.

“Tsk!”

Clang!

Hajing’s spear and Taesan’s sword collided. Hajing was horrified by the force felt from across the spear.

‘He’s stronger than me!’

Taesan had superior stats. Hajing had strengthened himself to the limit on the 30th floor and naturally believed he would have the upper hand, but this belief created a gap in his movements.

Blue flames rose on Taesan’s sword. It slid past Hajing’s spear and pierced his chest.

[Hajing received 226 damage.]

“Hold on!”

“What damage is this!”

The rest of them didn’t just watch. The mage was chanting a spell, the archer was drawing his bow, and the rogue was trying to stab Taesan in the back with a dagger.

[You have activated Decarabia's Distorted Life.]

And then, roots surged in. The guides hastily ceased their attacks and distanced themselves from the sweeping black energy of vegetation.

“A forbidden spell!”

“He’s not a demon…!”

Crack.

While they were adjusting, Taesan continued to pressure Hajing.

Hajing wasn’t just taking it. He activated his skills and tried to escape the crisis with his spear techniques.

But all of it was blocked.

The skills were neutralized by Taesan’s slight movements, and the spear techniques were penetrated by the Stormscar Sword. In an instant, over half of his energy was drained.

“Do something!”

“Easier said than done!”

[You have activated Frost Arrow.]

[You have activated Blazing Orb.]

While pressing Hajing, Taesan continued to pressure the other three with magic, dark magic, and elemental skills. Arinesia cried out in frustration as the attacks came flying at the exact time when they tried to do something.

“Does he have eyes on his back or what!”

Taesan’s field of vision was nearly 100%.

In fact, there was practically no blind spot. For them, who only had 40, 50% proficiency, it was a level of freedom that was hard to understand.

Taesan swung his sword harshly, and the force violently shook Hajing’s spear. Taesan then thrust his sword.

“Ah.”

The spear flew into the sky. Taesan’s sword pierced through Hajing’s chest.

“Ah, aah…”

[You have defeated Hajing Roya.]

“Darn it!”

Arinesia clenched her teeth and waved her hand. Her mana drained out rapidly, and a spell materialized.

[Arinesia has activated Storm Arrow.]

Clink clink clink!

The wind split, creating a massive arrow. Taesan, who deflected the arrow, maintained his posture.

“It’s strong.”

It was one of the strongest magics he had ever seen.

It looked powerful enough to drain hundreds of health points if it hit properly.

[Intermediate Magic... It's usable if you're on the 30th floor.]

Arinesia glared sharply at Taesan as she waved her hand.

The arrow was fired. It filled the room, leaving no place to dodge.

And he had no intention to dodge either.

[You have activated Forced Duel. For 10 seconds, no one except Baben Ruata can deal damage to you.]

The arrow, connecting with Taesan, exploded. It lost its magic and dispersed in every direction.

“What, what?”

Without understanding what had happened, Taesan charged towards them.

The Guides of Sin.

They were not weak. If the strength of the four was combined properly, they could easily pressure Taesan.

However, their coordination was very poor, and they were not prepared.

The rogue couldn’t target Taesan’s back, and the archer couldn’t pressure him at all. Due to constant restrictions, the mage couldn’t materialize any magic.

Even the late materialized magic lost its meaning due to Forced Duel.

They probably never coordinated with each other. It was natural since there was no enemy to fight together.

Even if their coordination was perfect, nothing would change.

Forced Duel that prevented anyone other than the target from intervening.

As long as he had it, outnumbering Taesan had no meaning.

And this was the result.

“Cough.”

“That was somewhat annoying.”

The chest of the last remaining guide was pierced. He tried to escape in every way possible but couldn’t hide from Taesan’s eyes. The light disappeared from the rogue’s eyes.

[You have defeated Baben Ruata.]

[Your level has increased.]

[Your Soul Ascension has activated. Agility permanently increased by 36. Strength permanently increased by 21. Intelligence permanently increased by 19. Health permanently increased by 100.]

[You have acquired the special activation skill [Stealth].]

Having defeated the four guides, his level increased by 4. His stats increased more, and he also acquired two skills.

“Status window.”

[Kang Taesan]

[Level: 62]

[Shield: 329/329]

[Health: 3830/3830]

[Mana: 716/716]

[Magic: 44/44]

[Strength: 1246]

[Intelligence: 915]

[Agility: 1102]

[Attack Power + 145]

[Defense + 172]

[Subject is in the best condition.]

All stats had increased by about 100. He gained levels equivalent to passing through two floors by just defeating the four guides.

And there were also skills.

[Special Activation Skill: Stealth]

[Mana Consumption: 20]

[Proficiency: 1%]

[It hides the body. It conceals the presence. It's still very immature.]

It was the activation skill version of invisibility. Judging by the similar description, it seemed the effects weren’t much different either.

Perhaps it was a skill used by those who couldn’t learn magic. It didn’t mean much, but it wasn’t bad either.

[Basic Magic: Wind Explosion]

[Mana Consumption: 9]

[Proficiency: 1%]

[Causes an explosion of wind.]

A very simple description. The effect was as simple as the description. Taesan raised his finger.

[You have activated Wind Explosion.]

Boom!

Wind exploded right in front of Taesan. It harshly slapped his face and tried to push him back.

The power itself wasn’t very impressive, but like the lightning, it had no delay and wasn’t confined to Taesan’s surroundings. It was quite usable in restricting the opponent’s actions or blocking projectiles.

“So when are they coming?”

These four weren’t the end. If the ghost was right, there were about five more left.

[Well… I don't think they are coming.]

The ghost mumbled in an ambiguous tone.

“They are dead.”

In the silence, a man’s voice echoed. The flames in all four jewels in front of him had extinguished.

“… All four of them?”

“Yes.”

With a voice like a groan, the manager spoke.

“All… are dead.”

“So quickly? It hasn’t even been two hours yet!”

Someone denied it and shouted.

“Even if they couldn’t win, they could have escaped! Don’t lie!”

“I thought so, too. That’s why I sent them.”

The difference in equipment was absolute. However excellent the adventurer were, they were adventurers from the 24th floor. To break through those with equipment from the 30th floor would take a considerable amount of time. He believed they could escape without much difficulty, even if a problem arose.

“But… they are all dead.”

Silence fell again.

The manager hesitantly opened his mouth.

“Do we have to go down and fight too?”

“… That’s not a tempting suggestion. He killed four in just two hours. I don’t think it will be different with six.”

A woman who had regained her composure mumbled. It wasn’t a wrong judgment, but it wasn’t the right one either.

“If that demon was here…”

The demon who had left the third tier a while ago.

The guide who had received permission from the executives to enter the deep levels. They were the guides permitted to places where others weren’t.

Initially, they had felt jealousy and envy. They wanted to see with their own eyes what was different. However, they realized this in the short time spent together.

That demon was monstrously strong. Despite being on the same floor, they were completely no match for him.

He could have been a match for the intruder. But the manager shook his head.

“He already went down. And he said he wouldn’t come back. It’s a pointless imagination.”

“Then what should we do…”

They couldn’t decide and were confused. Somehow, the manager came up with an idea and spoke.

“Let’s wait for now. He’s still on the 24th floor.”

Their location was the 30th floor. It would take time for him to come down. A man frowned.

“Give him time to get stronger?”

“Our chances of winning are low anyway. So, we should give time and communicate below.”

“…So we are waiting until the absent executives return.”

At the dismal decision, they all groaned.

It sounded grand, but the conclusion was simple. They couldn’t beat the adventurer of the 24th floor, so they hoped the executives would come back soon.

If their prayer succeeded, they could survive; if it failed, they would die.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Their abilities couldn’t influence this choice at all.

“But we have no other means.”

The manager spoke as if making a final plea. The others also agreed in silence.

“So, the conclusion is rough. Let’s communicate and then run. We endure somehow until the executives get better.”

“……This sucks.”

Someone muttered grimly. They all gave bitter laughs.

Taesan, who was resting against the wall, muttered.

“They are not coming.”

He waited about two hours. It was enough time for them to realize the anomaly and come down, but there was no sign of them.

“Your prediction was right.”

[The Guides are the ones with broken spirits. So, they are cowards, and they procrastinate. Still disappointing.]

The ghost muttered in a contemptuous tone.

[They probably decided to wait until the executives came back. Whether it is wise or foolish…]

“It doesn’t matter either way.”

It didn’t matter even if the executives came down. He was prepared for them.

“But… It seems I need to give it a bit of time.”

[Huh? Why?]

“A quest has appeared.”

Taesan looked into the void.

The quest window stated another return to Earth.
