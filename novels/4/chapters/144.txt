Chapter 145

[Intermediate? They're giving you that already?]

“Yes. That’s why I’m not sure. Are they serious?”

[It's a god similar to the God of Swords, so it doesn't seem like a joke... But it's extraordinary, right? Intermediate magic on the 30th floor?]

“Can you explain in a way I can understand?”

Taesan waved his hand to interrupt their conversation.

“What does it mean to learn intermediate magic?”

[Ah, that's right. You haven't seen intermediate magic before. You've used magic, so you know what basic magic is like, right?] RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“I’m well aware.”

In the Labyrinth, the value of magic was extremely high. Up to the 30th floor, it was possible to clear levels using only basic magic.

Outside the Labyrinth, its value increased even more.

The magicians in Vekveta who saw the magic he used were astounded. It was something only the best magicians in their world could barely use or not cast at all.

And that was just basic magic.

So, what level would intermediate magic be?

The ghost answered his question.

[It's magic that can even make an impact in the deep layers. Simply put, you know the Guides of Sin you've seen? Even they have to avoid this magic.]

“Huh.”

Taesan’s lips curled up naturally.

A skill that could deal damage even to those who had reached the deep layers. It was definitely valuable if it could harm those who could cause physical interference with just their emotions.

Lilis mumbled with an ambiguous face.

“Normally, you wouldn’t get this until you get past the 50th floor…”

[Right. This guy is just special.]

“I’m happy, but it’s a bit… odd to be too happy about it.”

Lilis grumbled. Taesan, still with unresolved questions, asked again.

“What about advanced magic?”

If just moving from basic to intermediate created such a difference, anything beyond would certainly make an even bigger impact.

[A few at the top of the Guides of Sin can use it. Magic that makes it possible to conquer the deep layers on its own. Though those idiots can't do it.]

“And what about the highest level?”

[I don't know about that.]

The ghost shook its white hair.

[Never seen anyone use it. Does it even exist? Not sure about that.]

“I’m not sure either…”

Lilis scratched her cheek with an uncertain face. If a magician who dedicated her life to magic and a warrior who reached the deep layers didn’t know its existence, it truly meant it was an uncharted territory.

“Is there anything higher than the highest-ranking skill?”

Taesan had the highest skill, the Airak weapon technique. The ghost was surprised about how he got it but wasn’t shocked by the skill itself.

Knowing about the existence of the highest skill and not knowing about the highest magic was unexpected.

The ghost spoke calmly.

[Magic is harder to learn and more valuable than simple skills. Skills and swordsmanship can be approached by anyone, but magic is cut off at the line of talent from the start. And among those, the highest level...]

“Beyond the deep layers?”

[I don't know. Even the apostles of the god of magic I met, none of them used the highest levels of magic.]

Taesan concluded the conversation there. He was curious but not interested enough to delve deeper.

“So when can I learn intermediate magic?”

“Not right away. The god will send a trial when the time is right, and you’ll be granted the ability after passing it.”

“So, not yet, then.”

That meant he had to continue conquering the Labyrinth. Taesan bid farewell to Lilis and headed towards the 33rd floor.

[Start of the 33rd Floor Quest]

[Defeat the boss of the 33rd floor and pass through.]

[Reward: Shield of Protection]

[Secret Reward: ???]

As usual, the quest and reward windows appeared. Taesan cleared the notifications and went down the stairs.

The shopkeeper looked puzzled.

“Why do you keep coming and going?”

“I had to learn some magic.”

“That useless girl you’re talking about.”

The shopkeeper had an indifferent face. To him, who was only interested in conquering the Labyrinth, Lilis, who lived off Taesan, was of no value.

“You’re not buying anything this time either?”

“I’m not buying, but I have something to ask.”

“What do you want to ask?”

“What is this exactly?”

Taesan raised his wrist. The whip with thorns was firmly attached to his arm.

The shopkeeper grimaced.

“Why did it change?”

“It absorbed a material on its own and transformed.”

“Is that so?”

“Didn’t you sell this?”

The shopkeeper seemed unaware as well. He spoke as if making an excuse.

“I did sell it, but I didn’t make it. I received it from someone else. Why? It was written there, wasn’t it?”

Taesan recalled the whip’s description.

“It said it was made by a witch’s whim.”

“Yes. I got it from that woman. It looked normal when I examined it, so I put it up for sale. I don’t know much about it.”

“Were you close with her?”

“Not really?”

The shopkeeper wrinkled his nose.

“She wasn’t weird, but she had strong opinions. Some people liked that, but not me. Why do you ask?”

“I wondered if she entered here too.”

A witch capable of creating such useful equipment for the Labyrinth. If she had such skills, it was likely she could have entered the Labyrinth.

The shopkeeper seemed thoughtful at Taesan’s words.

“There’s a possibility… Yes. There is a possibility. She said she had no intention of coming, but she was very fickle.”

“That’s all I needed to know.”

The thorn absorbed by the wrist guard was said to be from the witch’s house.

The shopkeeper’s ignorance suggested it might have entered the Labyrinth through other means.

Taesan left the shopkeeper and moved on.

“Now that I think about it, I should check the new magic.”

Taesan reviewed the magic.

[Basic Magic: Seal]

[Mana Consumption: 1]

[Proficiency: 1%]

[Imprints a seal on your location. Subsequent magic will target the sealed location.]

“More of a support spell than an attack?”

Taesan immediately experimented. He activated Seal, moved forward, and then cast a spell.

[You have activated Frost Arrow.]

Swoosh!

As soon as it was activated, the spell flew and pierced the spot marked by the Seal.

“How should I use this?”

Originally, spells like Frost Arrow or Fireball could be directed as Taesan wished. Imprinting the Seal could actually become a penalty.

Taesan thought for a moment and then came up with an idea for another spell.

“Let’s try this.”

Taesan imprinted a Seal and moved again. After putting some distance, he cast a spell.

[You have activated Random Blink.]

The Blink activated toward the spot marked by the Seal.

“This is good.”

The downside of Random Blink was the unpredictability of the teleportation location, but this was resolved with just one Seal. There was the limitation that he could only imprint the Seal where he had stepped before, but that was a manageable downside in combat.

Taesan moved on, satisfied.

The 33rd floor had a knight wielding a hammer. The hammer, cutting through the air, contained a force difficult for an ordinary adventurer to withstand.

Clang!

But Taesan effortlessly deflected the hammer.

He then quickly activated Acceleration and easily took down the knight.

“This floor is quite good.”

It was perfect for practicing his newly learned swordsmanship.

Taesan breached the room.

He continued to train his swordsmanship, focusing on raising the proficiency of the Ability Sword by dragging out the fights with monsters rather than dispatching them quickly.

And the results were clear.

[Advanced Swordsmanship: Ability Sword]

[Proficiency: 12%]

[A unique swordsmanship created by an adventurer of the Labyrinth. It is based on the system of the Labyrinth. Developed from the swordsmanship used by the Prince of the Destroyed World. Several skills can be perfectly integrated with this swordsmanship.]

“Already at 12%.”

He had raised the proficiency by 4% just by passing through one floor. It was a very fast rate, even when facing enemies much weaker than Taesan. The ghost was also impressed.

[Is it because it's your own creation? It's really fast. At this rate, you might reach 20% by the mid-30s.]

But that was not all. A few skills related to swordsmanship also increased in proficiency and changed.

[Special Activation Skill: Aura]

[Proficiency: 20%]

[A reward given to those who have mastered the sword. You have begun to understand Aura.]

An aura flickered around Taesan’s sword.

The aura was not like sparks but burned like the flames of a bonfire. It was a result of increased proficiency and stabilization of the aura.

“That took a while.”

He wasn’t sure about the effects, but it likely increased damage as a skill without any mana consumption.

And Critical Attack also changed.

[Special Constant Activation Skill: Critical Attack]

[Proficiency: 20%]

[Deals greater damage when attacking the enemy's weak points. Adds a bit more than half of the usual damage.]

Apart from the added damage, there wasn’t much change. Still, it was a useful change, and Taesan happily accepted it.

The reward for the 33rd floor’s secret room was a golden bow.

‘Since I have magic, I can sell this in the shop.’

Soon, he reached the boss.

[A Black Hammer Knight with only instinct remaining has appeared.]

Whoosh!

The giant hammer was swung. Despite being on the 33rd floor, the hammer had a weightiness even Taesan could feel.

However, its movements were very slow. It seemed like a boss that required dodging rather than blocking attacks.

Taesan swung his sword fiercely.

Clang!

The thin sword collided with the giant hammer and knocked it away. Taesan continued to time his attacks against the knight’s hammer or strike its armor.

[You have defeated the Black Hammer Knight with only instinct remaining.]

[The proficiency of Ability Sword has increased by 1%.]

[Your level has risen.]

It had been a while since his last level-up. He thought it wouldn’t happen for a while due to the significant level gap with the monsters, but apparently, he had accumulated enough experience.

[Shield of Protection]

[Defense + 50]

[A shield crafted with great care but failed to protect its charge. Merely being robust was not enough to guard someone.]

[Used ???.]

[You have obtained the Ghost-Haunted Hammer of Pama.]

[Ghost-Haunted Hammer of Pama]

[Attack Power + 70]

[A massive hammer that can only just be lifted with two hands. It was created to annihilate ghosts, but as a result, countless spirits have taken residence in it.]

[Attack Power against Ghost Attributes + 20]

“There’s nothing useful here.”

He didn’t use shields. Though high in attack power, the hammer was a two-handed weapon according to its description. Taesan, despite his high stats, preferred not to be forced to use two-handed weapons.

Thus, it was destined for the shop.

Taesan returned to the entrance and sold the accumulated equipment and miscellaneous materials to the shopkeeper.

“Time to go.”

Vargan had said to go to the left end of the 33rd floor. A small door appeared as he reached the last room on the left.

Entering it, he found a small altar.

Two small steles, like a gateway, were set up at a slight distance from each other.

[Someone who will let you out of the Tower will come.]

As the ghost murmured, power began to descend onto the altar. The gathering energy felt familiar.

“Lakiratas?”

[We meet again, Kang Taesan.]

From the dissipating energy, a voice full of interest echoed.

“Are you overseeing this?”

[Doesn't it seem fitting?]

“I suppose so.”

Struggle and death. It was an area fitting for a battlefield.

Lakiratas asked with a hint of amusement.

[Have you decided to head to their battlefield?]

“It seems I’m the only one suitable for the task.”

[Indeed. It took quite some time to find a suitable one due to the petty restrictions those outside have imposed.]

Lakiratas’ voice was gentle. Taesan could feel the friendliness in his voice.

It was a fresh shock for Taesan. Even when they last met on Earth, Lakiratas seemed to harbor good feelings towards Taesan, but he had not smiled or spoken softly. His voice was always blunt and calm.

But now, it was very different.

Above all, Lakiratas was addressing Taesan not as a mere mortal but by his name.

[I have little interest in the outside. Some may find it bothersome or annoying, but to me, it's meaningless. Whatever they do, it doesn't negatively affect me.]

Lakiratas was the god of struggle and death. If the gods outside created a battlefield leading their followers to death, it would be satisfactory for him.

[However, this is something I look forward to. It's not just the futile acts of mortals.]

Laughing, Lakiratas spoke.

[Will you accept it?]

[Special Quest Start]

[Participate in the battlefield of the gods outside and show them the greatness of the Labyrinth.]

[Condition: Conquest of the Battlefield]

[Reward: Vargan and the gods of the Labyrinth will give suitable rewards based on the performance.]

“I accept.”

Taesan nodded. Lakiratas chuckled.

[This is enjoyable. Very enjoyable. This is an emotion I haven't felt in a long time since taking this tedious position.]
