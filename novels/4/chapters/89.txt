“Huh.”

Taesan had expected an invitation. However, he assumed there would be a minimal trial to clear first, so he was momentarily taken aback.

“Does it mean there’s no need for a trial because they already know, or…”

“It could also mean they don’t want to give a trial.”

Taesan, who had been glancing at the system window for a moment, moved his hand.

[You have accepted Lucifer's invitation.] [Lucifer's domain welcomes you.]

The world warped. The labyrinth was overlaid with darkness, materializing an entirely different world.

The world that emerged was different from Maria’s domain.

If her domain was a temple standing alone in a space akin to the void of the universe, Lucifer’s domain was a vast castle.

Taesan was summoned inside a building so long and wide that it was hard to see the end of the corridor.

Taesan quietly inspected the interior of the castle.

Black gem decorations. Pillars that reached up to the end of the sky. A high ceiling that appeared faintly visible.

It was indeed a massive castle.

[Hmm.]

A dissatisfied voice echoed. Taesan realized belatedly.

A girl in black was looking down at Taesan from a high, high throne, resting her arms on its sides.

Her black hair flowed down to the base of the throne.

Eyes as sharp as a cat’s.

A long black dress.

Taesan was slightly taken aback.

When he had met Maria, he had felt an incalculable power. So, he could immediately realize that it had manifested.

But it wasn’t the same with this girl.

On the surface, she was just an ordinary and cute child, and he didn’t feel any power from her.

The girl opened her mouth.

[Are you just going to stare blankly?]

Taesan came to his senses belatedly. The girl was welcoming him from her grand throne as if she were a queen.

It wasn’t hard to guess what she wanted.

Taesan bent his knee.

“Greetings, Your Majesty.”

Demon God Lucifer.

Her true form was the young girl in front of him.

The girl, who had been staring down at Taesan, spoke.

[You kneel obediently.]

“I’m not so clueless that I can’t read the room.”

He couldn’t tell what emotions the deity in front of him had towards him. It was likely that she was hostile.

After all, he had killed someone who could be considered part of her lineage.

It was his judgment that it would be correct to move obediently as she wanted.

And that was the right answer.

[Not bad. If you were defiant, I would have crushed your head.]

A chilling sensation grazed Taesan’s neck at her light voice. The muscles throughout his body began to contract naturally.

The girl waved her hand.

[No, I'm just kidding. I can't crush your head. That would upset quite a few people. Instead,…..]

A dreary gaze was directed towards Taesan.

[Hmm. I've seen through the eyes of the pitiful one, but you're definitely unique. Could someone like you really exist in this world?]

At the incomprehensible words, Taesan’s eyebrows twitched.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

[If you don't understand, that's fine. It's none of my concern.]

With a languid attitude, the girl caught her own hair with her toes and swayed it back and forth.

[I have no intention of seeking retribution for your killing of the pitiful one. It was a rightful battle and victory for you.]

“That’s a relief.”

She didn’t seem to hold any negative feelings about him killing Jagan.

[The reason you came to me must be for magical energy. Right?]

Taesan nodded.

The consumption required for dark magic. Magical energy.

He had accepted Lucifer’s invitation because he wanted that.

Lucifer shook her head, and her silk-like hair swayed gently.

[You're a human.]

A small finger pointed towards Taesan.

[And I am a Demon God. Mana is the power of my beings. Humans are not mine.]

“… You’re saying you can’t give it to me.”

As she said, magic power belonged to the demons. In fact, even the ghost couldn’t obtain anything from Lucifer’s altar when he had passed by it when he was alive.

But Lucifer had deliberately brought Taesan into her realm. This meant there was another way.

[If you ask whether I can bestow upon you the power that only my beings can possess, yes, I can.]

“But didn’t you say you couldn’t give it?”

[Ordinarily, yes. But you already have a portion of my power, albeit through a loophole. That one beside you wasn't qualified, but you are.]

Taesan was able to comprehend what Lucifer was saying.

From Jagan, Taesan had taken black magic, a skill humans couldn’t learn, due to Soul Ascension.

Meaning he was learning skills that required magic power, thus fulfilling the minimum requirement. Lucifer murmured with a faintly interested expression on her face.

[It's definitely unique. Is that your power......]

Taesan cast a questioning glance at Lucifer, but she simply continued speaking.

[I can bestow mana upon you by putting you through a trial; if you pass, you'll receive it. But would that be enough? You responded to my invitation hoping for something more, right?]

Taesan didn’t deny it. Lucifer continued in a languid tone.

[You'd want more than just magic power. Like receiving a new spell from a god of magic, you want a new path from me, right?]

It wouldn’t be a big deal if it was just about receiving magic power. Unless he met and defeated new demons to steal their black magic spells, the black magic he could use was limited.

Taesan desired more. He hoped he could learn new black magic from Lucifer to possess a greater number of cards to use in battle.

Lucifer responded to Taesan’s wish.

[It's possible. You have a sliver of my power. Adding one or two more won't make a difference.]

Taesan clenched his fist triumphantly, out of Lucifer’s sight.

Looking at black magic at the same level as magic, Taesan could now wield four powers: swordsmanship, skills, magic, and black magic. The difference was undeniably huge when it came to battle.

[But everything comes at a cost, Kang Taesan.]

Her sharp eyes softly glowed.

[The reward I will give you will not be satisfied with a simple trial.]

“Do you want me to become an apostle?”

All the gods that Taesan met wanted this. Lucifer burst into laughter.

[Hardly. It may seem like Marianna and other gods want that, but I am a Demon God. A mere human can't become my apostle. Only pure demons can become my apostles.]

Lucifer stated confidently.

[They're really foolish. No matter how exceptional you are, you're still human. It's rather pitiful that they're begging so desperately. It diminishes their dignity as gods.]

“Were you watching me?”

[Why would I watch a fight of a child that's not even mine? I'm not interested.]

It was an attitude showing strong self-esteem, and Taesan was rather grateful for it. The proposals to become an apostle were subtly tiring for him, who had no such intention.

[What I want from you is a simple relationship of following commands and receiving rewards.]

It wasn’t a bad proposition for Taesan.

“Please proceed.”

[It's simple. Protect my lamb.]

A quest window appears.

[Sub Quest Begins] [The Demon God, Lucifer, wants help for her child who is being oppressed.] [However, that world is a realm where she could not intrude. She hopes you, who can enter that place, will help her child.] [Reward: Lucifer will determine based on your performance.]

Taesan scanned it and opened his mouth.

“Do I have to go to another world?”

[You have experience going into the foolish world of that dull-witted one, right? It's not a ruined world, so you don't have to worry.]

Lucifer frowned. Wrinkles formed on the girl’s pretty cheeks.

[My lamb is suffering from oppression and pain in a world where I have been lost. Take her to a safe place.]

“I heard you’ve settled here and abandoned the outside world.”

[The pitiful child seems to have misunderstood something. I moved my dwelling, not abandoned it. Where my child is, my gaze also exists. I'm just not paying attention because this place is more fun.]

Wherever demons existed, Lucifer watched. Thus, her power was subtly revealed. Taesan closed his mouth and thought.

‘It’s not a quest that will end in a short period of time.’

He didn’t know who the lamb she was referring to was, but they were likely in a dangerous situation. It was severe enough for Lucifer to request that he take them directly to a safe place.

‘It won’t be easy either.’

It was a quest given by a god who considered her own trials to be insufficient. It would be harder than any strengthened trial.

While considering this, Taesan made a decision.

“I accept.”

Lucifer smiled.

[Good.]

“However, I have another request.”

The ghost, who had been waiting quietly, swallowed its breath. A mortal was making a request to a god first. If it was a hasty god, they would have shown anger immediately.

Lucifer narrowed her eyes.

[Are you asking something from a god without giving anything in return? Normally, I would've become furious... but I can't do that this time.]

Lucifer’s energy that was flowing out suddenly subsided. This made it clear.

Lucifer had initially seen Taesan and had said that she had no intention to hurt him, even though they were interested in him. It was an insincere statement.

It meant that she was a god who was weaker than Lakiratas or Maria or that she respected them. She would not rashly touch Taesan in such a case.

[Speak. If it's nonsense, I'll ignore it.]

Facing the grumbling Lucifer, Taesan spoke.

“Do you know about the one who invaded my world?”

[...Ah.]

The smile on Lucifer’s face deepened.

[I will forgive you for asking something without giving anything in return. You want to know who they are, right? That's fine. If you carry out my command to my satisfaction, I will also tell you about them.]

Having gained everything he wanted, Taesan nodded.

“Then that’s settled.”

[Good. I know it's a hassle, but I need to give you a basic explanation. Listen carefully as I will explain only once.]

Lucifer started to explain.

[The world you're going to is known as Vekveta to us. It's a world where magic exists, guarded by dragons. The strength of the world itself is average... but it's guarded by an annoying entity.]

A faint irritation appeared on Lucifer’s face.

[A world where weak and frail beings torment my subjects.]

Lucifer clenched her jaw, and her hair fell loose.

[The world of the god of light born of the planet, governed by Hamon. That's where you're going.]

Taesan squinted his eyes. The sunlight coming down from the sky was dazzling.

It had been a very long time since he’d seen the sun. There was no such thing as sunlight inside the labyrinth, and ever since the earth was invaded by monsters, the sun had been obscured by holes. It was the sun he was seeing after an innumerable amount of time.

“So, this is Vekveta.”

Taesan murmured as he looked around.

“There doesn’t seem to be much difference.”

He saw a forest. There were rocks of a striking color, and next to them ran a blue river.

At first glance, it was just like Earth.

[You know by just looking at the Guides of Sin, right? The most common form is that of a human.]

“I guess I won’t be chased around for being a monster. Never thought I’d end up in another world in my life.”

This world didn’t seem to be on the verge of destruction, nor did it appear to be invaded by monsters.

The people here would live and die in an ordinary way, just like on the old Earth.

That felt strange to him. To Taesan, this normality felt incredibly distant.

[It doesn't look like you have time to be lost in thought.]

“That seems to be the case.”

Through his detection skill, Taesan sensed several presences from the other side of the forest.

Several pursuers.

And one being pursued.
