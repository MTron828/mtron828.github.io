Majestic Desert Splendor

The goblins were teasing each other, nudging their shields, and bumping their heads together. They seemed to be very friendly with each other.

“Heehee.”

“Kekek.”

Kang Taesan watched them expressionlessly.

Facing a single goblin wasn’t an issue.

In Easy Mode, they were the typical monsters of the 10th floor and were relatively weak.

The 1st-floor boss, the Giant Rat, was much stronger in terms of sheer power.

However, the difference between goblins and other monsters was that they possessed a rudimentary level of intelligence.

They could cooperate, set traps, and hunt in groups. They became stronger the more of them there were.

Thanks to these factors, they were commonly seen on both the middle and upper floors.

There were four goblins in the room.

In Easy Mode, a group of such numbers would not appear until you went past the 20th floor.

Moreover, multiple players could confront them in Easy Mode, making their numbers more manageable.

But here, Taesan was alone.

Taesan was keenly aware of this and had adequately prepared strategies to handle them. He then analyzed the goblins’ weapons.

Two out of four were wielding what appeared to be longswords. However, they were only longswords relative to the goblins. If Taesan were to wield them, they would look closer to short swords.

Another one was armed with a shield and a dagger. The shield was small, barely covering the upper body.

The last goblin was holding a bow.

It would probably provide cover from the rear when he attacked. Their clothing consisted of thin leather outfits that barely covered their loins. Their defensive ability was likely to be around 1 or 2.

After checking their equipment, Taesan determined the order of engagement. He mentally mapped out a scenario on how to handle them.

Once he finished his assessment, Taesan kicked the door open and stepped inside.

Crash!

“Kahk!”

“Kiyaek!”

The goblins were taken aback by his sudden appearance. However, it was only a moment before the glint of malice appeared in their eyes and their chattering vanished. All that remained were monsters ready to kill their enemy.

Taesan immediately drew his bow, notched a paralysis arrow, pulled the string, and fired.

Thud.

“Kiyaek!”

[10 Damage to the goblin using the bow] [Target is paralyzed. It cannot move until it is hit again or for the next 30 seconds]

Compared to the Giant Rat, a regular monster like this goblin remained paralyzed for longer.

Taesan pulled out another paralysis arrow.

The goblins were screaming and rushing toward Taesan.

In this urgent situation, panic could lead to failure, but Taesan pulled the bowstring without any hint of confusion.

[Calmness proficiency has increased by 1%.]

He fired his arrow, piercing the arm of the rushing goblin who wielded the short sword.

“Kik, Kiyik.”

The goblin trembled and stopped, leaving only its eyes to roll wildly. Two were already neutralized - the goblin with the short sword and the one with the bow. Only the other goblin with the short sword and the one with the shield remained.

They were already in close proximity, and it was not possible to shoot arrows anymore. The goblin with the shield struck out at Taesan with its dagger.

Taesan quickly put his bow away and pulled out his tower shield. He dodged the dagger and pushed back with the Tower Shield.

Thump.

“Kaak!”

The goblin with the shield was repelled. The size difference between the shields was overwhelming. Taesan also has the upper hand in strength. In a head-on clash, Taesan would win.

[3 Damage to the goblin with the shield.]

However, the damage was minimal since the opponent was also defending with a shield. From his memory, a goblin’s HP ranged from 40 to 50. Killing by pushing it with a shield was virtually impossible.

“Kareuk!”

The goblin with the short sword swung his blade.

Clang!

The tower shield split, but the damage was bearable. Taesan braced himself and then explosively struck back at the goblin.

[8 Damage to the goblin with the short sword]

“Kaak!”

Taesan closed in on the reeling goblin. He deflected the wildly swinging sword and tripped the goblin, causing it to fall over. Taesan then mounted the goblin.

“Kaak! Kaak!”

The pinned goblin flailed, trying to somehow escape, but it was already suppressed. There was no way for such a weakened opponent to break free. Taesan struck down with his tower shield, and the goblin’s head reeled.

[The goblin with the short sword is in a weakened state. It will take more damage] [15 Damage to the goblin with the short sword] [14 Damage to the goblin with the short sword]

“Kak, Kagak.”

The goblin’s pupils dilated. One more strike, and it would die. However, as Taesan lifted his tower shield,

“Kaaak!”

The goblin with the shield had rushed in to intervene. Taesan repelled it without even standing up from his seated position. The goblin with the shield retreated impotently once more.

[14 Damage to the goblin with the short sword] [You have defeated the goblin with the short sword]

The system window did not visibly appear. Taesan, who found it bothersome as it obstructed his view, set it to appear only after the battle ended.

One had been dealt with. The problem was that the effect of the paralysis arrow had worn off.

“Kaaak!”

“Ki-eak!”

The three goblins were enraged at having lost a companion. The goblin with the bow harshly pulled back the string, and his arrow impacted with the tower shield.

[2 Damage to you]

“Ki-eak!”

The goblin wielding the short sword moved and aimed for the unprotected flank that was beyond the tower shield, but Taesan managed to block it. As the goblin was repulsed, the other goblin who wielded the shield slipped in and attempted to forcibly yank the tower shield away.

“Kaak!”

“Tsk.”

Taesan clicked his tongue and jerked the tower shield roughly, and the goblin with the shield was thrown off. However, a gap was created, and the goblin with the short sword didn’t miss it.

“Ki-eak!”

The blade was targeted at Taesan’s neck. He quickly jerked his head to dodge, but his skin was still nicked.

[7 Damage to you]

As Taesan tried to push the goblin with the short sword away using the tower shield, an arrow was shot at him. In the end, Taesan had no choice but to back away.

‘This is indeed tricky.’

The goblins covered each other’s vulnerabilities, making openings for the other goblins. Their cooperation was flawless, not giving Taesan a chance to act. This could have been quite dangerous if he hadn’t taken one out beforehand.

To win, he had to break their teamwork. Taesan drew in a deep breath.

[You have activated your Breathless Attack. You are free of breathing limitations for the next 10 seconds]

He pushed forward with his tower shield at the charging goblin.

“Kak, Kaaak!”

His attack was momentarily twice as fast as before, causing the confused goblin to back away.

The goblin with the short sword hastened to his comrade’s aid, but their coordination was already shattered.

Taesan thrust roughly with his tower shield, and the goblins were thrown off.

As the two goblins distanced themselves from Taesan, he gained some respite. Taesan stored his shield and pulled out his Flame Staff.

[You have activated Fireball]

A fireball was shot toward the goblin, preparing to fire an arrow. The goblin stared dumbly at the incoming fireball.

“Kaak?”

Boom!

[15 Damage to the Goblin shooting the bow] [No judgment needed! The Goblin shooting the bow is in a burning state]

“Ki-e-eak!”

The goblin engulfed in flames, shrieked and jumped around. Judging by the looks of it, it didn’t seem to have the presence of mind to shoot arrows anymore.

Meanwhile, the two goblins were charging towards Taesan again. Taesan switched back to his tower shield and stored his staff.

“Kaak! Kaak!”

The two goblins energetically hammered at the tower shield, but unlike before, they didn’t have the support of arrows. There were plenty of openings.

Kwoong!

[9 Damage to the Goblin with the short sword]

“Ki-eak!”

The goblin was thrown off. Taesan quickly stowed the tower shield in his inventory and drew his rusty sword to charge at the goblin with the shield.

The goblin tried to protect itself with its shield while waiting for its comrade to return, but Taesan had no intention of leaving him be.

Unlike the tower shield, the rusty sword was a one-handed weapon. He grabbed the goblin’s shield with his free hand.

“Kik!”

The goblin desperately tried to protect its body with the shield, but Taesan was stronger. The shield was forcibly pulled away, exposing its body, and Taesan swung his rusty sword.

[9 Damage to the Goblin with the shield] [8 Damage to the Goblin with the shield]

“Kik….”

The goblin collapsed.

[You have defeated the Goblin with the shield]

Two were down, and two remained. However, since one was writhing crazily on the floor while covered in flames, there was only functionally one left.

“Ggik, Kkik.”

[The Goblin with the short sword is intimidated by you. It is constrained in its actions]

The Goblin with the short sword backed away with a worried look on its face. As Taesan approached, it gritted its teeth and swung its sword. Taesan parried with his sword and stabbed it in the throat.

[9 Damage to the Goblin with the short sword]

“Keeak!”

He parried again and pierced its throat.

[9 Damage to the Goblin with the short sword] [You have defeated the Goblin with the short sword]

Only one remained.

Taesan approached the goblin, who was still burning and screaming.

“Kii-eek……”

With its last breath, the goblin transformed into a reward.

[You have defeated the Goblin with the bow]

He was victorious. Taesan sat down and wiped away his sweat. He then massaged his muscles throughout his body and began to relax.

“It’s doable.”

It was not easy. He used two Paralysis Arrows and expended a considerable amount of energy.

However, it wasn’t life-threatening.

His health and mana were significantly depleted, but they were fully recovered through the reward of victory, and he didn’t use any skills besides the Breathless Assault and Fireball. The progress was much smoother than expected.

As he proceeded, the number of goblins would increase, and their equipment would improve. Still, it shouldn’t be too difficult, considering he gained stat points through the bonus he received from Soul Ascension.

Taesan began to confirm the rewards.

His level did not increase. Judging by the amount of experience points, it seemed like he would level up after clearing one more room.

[Your Soul Ascension increase has been triggered. Your intelligence permanently increases by 1]

“How simple.”

The same message appeared four times. Taesan murmured to the uniform system window with some apprehension.

Nevertheless, the increase in intelligence was not bad. He would gain bonuses for various mental checks, and the amount of mana consumed would also decrease. It was an important stat as he would need to use skills more often in the future.

His proficiency also steadily increased, and finally, the content of a few skills changed.

[Constant Special Activation Skill: Vision Enhancement] [Proficiency: 20%] [You can obtain a broad field of view. It has slightly surpassed human standards]

Usually, changes began to occur from around 20% proficiency.

The phrase ‘It has slightly surpassed human standards’ was added to Vision Enhancement.

In reality, this meant that Taesan had a perfectly clear 270-degree field of view, something that normal humans would not be able to see.

He could even perhaps perceive a little beyond objects that obstructed his view.

It was a good change.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

On the second floor, several goblins would attack at the same time. The possibility of being surrounded and hit from behind would then disappear with this skill. Even after leaving the second floor, a broad field of view was always an advantage.

Insight also had a change in its description.

[Constant Special Activation Skill: Insight] [Proficiency: 24%] [You can perceive a lot. It seems to be able to identify only the weaknesses of creatures. You might also be able to find hidden rooms. Very occasionally, it informs you of important information]

“Great.”

Taesan muttered softly. The change in Vision Enhancement was good, but this was even better.

‘Very occasionally, it informs you of important information.’

That single sentence held tremendous value here.

It effectively artificially induced the luck necessary to survive in the labyrinth. Depending on when it was activated, it would be as valuable as endurance and agility.

The proficiency of Insight increased quite slowly, so he thought he would have to reach at least the 5th floor to get the upgrade, but it was much faster. It was a pleasant miscalculation.

Now, it was time for items.

Instead of giving meat and leather, the goblins dropped the equipment they were wearing with a certain level of probability.

A small sword and a small shield were lying in front of Taesan.

“It’s about time to change one.”

The equipment changed with every floor that he progressed. Taesan began to check.
