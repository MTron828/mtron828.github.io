He had acquired three skills at once. This was a first for Taesan, so he began to check his skills.

[Special Permanent Skill: Thirst for Battle] [Proficiency: 1%] [When facing a difficult enemy or an unbeatable foe, you feel exhilaration. Everything about you is enhanced.]

“A skill specifically for tough opponents?”

That was exactly what the description stated.

He wasn’t sure about the exact numbers, but if it was an average increase, he could find a lot of use for it.

Especially considering how often he encountered difficult or unbeatable foes here.

[Special Permanent Skill: Thirst for Victory] [Proficiency: 1%] [You receive greater rewards when you achieve victory against a difficult or unbeatable enemy.]

“Huh.”

A skill linked directly to the rewards? Taesan had never seen such a skill before. He confirmed the content.

The effect was additional rewards when achieving victory against a tough opponent.

Although he didn’t know what kind of additional rewards, like Thirst for Battle, it would likely be quite useful.

And now the last one. Contempt for the Strong.

[Special Activation Skill: Contempt for the Strong] [Mana Consumption: 1] [Proficiency: 1%] [When facing a difficult or unbeatable foe, you can receive a judgment bonus.]

“Hmm……”

Taesan pondered this, trying to understand the effect.

“Does it mean I get the judgment bonus twice?”

If that was the case, it was a great skill. The increase in judgment bonus was quite significant. The reason he was able to beat the Lord this time was that all his stats increased due to the judgment bonus.

If he could receive it twice, it would be a great help when facing a tough opponent.

The victory reward was fully satisfying. It was time to check the other rewards.

[Your level has increased.] [As a reward for leveling up, your health has increased by 25.] [As a reward for leveling up, your strength has permanently increased by 4. Your agility has permanently increased by 4. Your mana has permanently increased by 4.] [Your level has increased.] [You have reached your optimal state.] [As a reward for leveling up, your health has increased by 30.] [As a reward for leveling up, your strength has permanently increased by 5. Your agility has permanently increased by 6. Your mana has permanently increased by 5.]

He had leveled up twice. Usually, even against a tough opponent, it ended with just one level up. This change clearly showed what kind of level the Lord was. It was truly breathtaking, even when he thought about it again.

He would have died if he had made the slightest mistake. If the Lord’s leg had been intact, Taesan would not have thought of fighting and would have fled. He was trying to challenge the labyrinth, not to commit suicide.

It was that level of strength.

And then the Soul Ascension.

[Your Soul Ascension has been activated. Your strength has permanently increased by 7. Your health has permanently increased by 30. Your mana has permanently increased by 10.]

It was a simple but definite increase. And Soul Ascension was not just a skill that stole stats. Taesan checked the remaining system window.

[Your Soul Ascension has been activated. The proficiency of Breathless attack increases by 6%.] [Your Soul Ascension has been activated. You have obtained the special activation skill [Strong Blow].]

Taesan’s pupils dilated.

“I got a skill too? What kind of skill is this?”

It was truly beyond imagination. He thought Soul Ascension was good, but he had to revise his thoughts if it also gave him skills.

“It’s incomparable.”

A skill that could proudly be the best among all skills.

That was Soul Ascension. At this point, it was more of a top-tier skill rather than a multiplier.

Considering what kind of hardships one had to endure and what dangers one had to overcome to obtain a skill, this alone was a main skill level.

Taesan whistled while checking Strong Blow.

[Special Activation Skill: Strong Blow] [Mana Consumption: ?] [Proficiency: 1%] [Your next attack hits harder.]

The mana consumption wasn’t even listed. The description was brief, but Strong Blow was a good skill used till the end by even Hard Mode players.

The effect was simple. Additional damage was added to the skill used in proportion to the mana used. As the proficiency increased, the amount of mana consumed, and the more skills used, the damage exponentially increased.

It was a skill that many players loved to use as it could hold a lot in one blow.

However, Taesan, being an Easy Mode player, had low basic attack power and hence didn’t use this discarded skill.

It wasn’t like Addition, which doubled the attack power itself, but a skill that judged the damage when attacking, so there was no way to use it.

Moreover, since he had too many skills, using Strong Blow was quite a waste of mana.

But it was different now.

It could be very useful.

And he also received a piece of equipment. It was a necklace adorned with beast teeth.

[Necklace for the Master] [Attack Power + 3] [Defense Power + 3] [Strength + 3] [Agility + 3] [Intelligence + 3] [A necklace made by goblins praying for three days for their master. It is imbued with spiritual power.]

“Hah.”

Taesan laughed with satisfaction.

The stats attached to the necklace were unbelievable.

While the stats were impressive, the necklace even had attack and defense power. The necklace had the highest defense power among all the equipment he was wearing now.

Taesan swapped his necklace. While the necklace with 2 attack power wasn’t bad, it couldn’t compare to the Lord’s Necklace.

It seemed like the increase in stats was over.

“Status window.”

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 12] [Health: 430/430] [Mana: 75/75] [Strength: 63] [Intelligence: 71] [Agility: 58] [Attack Power + 18] [Defense Power + 12] [The target is in its best condition.]

The overall increase in power was significantly high at a glance. With this rate, he should be able to reach the stats he had when he cleared Easy Mode by the 5th floor.

But it didn’t stop there. Taesan gained a skill that he hadn’t even anticipated.

[You have charged towards your enemy at high-speed countless times. You have obtained the special activation skill [Acceleration].] [Special Activation Skill: Acceleration] [Mana Consumption: 5] [Proficiency: 1%] [Accelerates towards the target.]

“I already got Acceleration?”

‘Accelerates towards the target.’ It was a very simple description. In the labyrinth, shorter descriptions often denoted stronger skills. Acceleration was one of those skills.

If the criterion of rushing towards the target was met, he would run at a speed double his usual. The criteria were relatively generous and could be used in most situations. Once the proficiency reached 100%, he could also get the Hyper-Acceleration that he frequently used.

‘I thought it would be quite a struggle to get this.’

One of the methods to obtain a skill was to replicate its effect. To get Acceleration, one had to create various potions, conditions, and situations and try them. Yet the chances of obtaining it were low.

Perhaps, he got it because he received a judgment of achieving an impossible victory. It was an unexpected harvest.

Taesan finished his checks with a satisfied face.

He became strong in an instant. The risk and return were definitely worth it. It was certainly worth investing in this.

“This is the answer.”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

[You……]

The ghost spoke softly. Noticing a different tone than before, Taesan smirked.

“What’s wrong?”

[No, it's nothing.]

The ghost shook its head and then forced itself to speak with an enthusiastic voice.

[So, are we going down now?]

“We have to go to Lakiratas first.”

Though it seemed odd, Taesan didn’t question it. He ascended to the 2nd floor and arrived at Lakiratas’ Altar.

A crimson mist congealed, and a transcendent something revealed itself beyond the altar.

[Huh.]

The ghost flinched for a moment and hid behind Taesan’s back as if to conceal itself. Lakiratas, as if indifferent to the ghost, sent out a system message.

[You have passed Lakiratas' Trial. Rewards are given to you according to Lakiratas' evaluation.] [Lakiratas was greatly satisfied with your struggle. Lakiratas wishes to give you a worthy reward.]

Taesan looked at the system message with indifference.

Lakiratas must have known about the Goblin Lord hidden on the 3rd floor. The likelihood was high that he had given such a trial because he wanted to watch the battle between the Lord and Taesan.

A life-or-death battle. Strategy, talent, skill, and luck. A bloody fight that demanded all of these.

Struggle and death. Lakiratas was clearly asserting his dominion.

[Lakiratas proposes the Apostle's Contract to you.]

“I told you I won’t accept it.”

He promptly hit the refusal button. The ghost was taken aback.

[You, you. Wait a minute.]

“What’s up?”

[Then Lakiratas will…….]

“Doesn’t matter, does it?”

The entity that existed beyond this space chuckled as if it found this quite amusing.

The ghost closed its mouth.

[Lakiratas' influence area has decreased.] [Lakiratas gives you a reward. You have received [Shield]. You have received the special permanent activation skill [Shield Increase].]

“Shield?”

It seemed like a reward related to stats. Taesan opened the status window to check.

“Hmm?”

[Kang Taesan] [Level: 12] [Shield: 10/10] [Health: 430/430] [Mana: 75/75]

A new item labeled ‘Shield’ was added above ‘Health’.

“Ghost?”

[I don't know either. It's a stat I've never seen before.]

It seemed to be a reward only given by Lakiratas. Taesan also checked the skill he had received.

[Special Permanent Activation Skill: Shield Increase] [Proficiency: 1%] [You have gained a shield that blocks damage. The value of the shield increases proportionally with your health.]

Taesan, who read the skill, tapped his chin.

A shield that blocks damage. It increases in proportion to health.

‘Feels like a second health bar.’

Health would probably be depleted after the shield, and once the shield reached 0, health would start to diminish. It seemed to work in that way.

If Taesan’s guess was right, it was a very good skill.

He didn’t know how much the proportional value would be, but it was the same as saying that his health would increase. No, it was even better.

The shield was marked entirely differently. It wasn’t a judgment of health.

This means there was a moment when health was not depleted, even when damage was taken.

‘Is it possible?’

A single possibility passed through his mind.

Still in the realm of speculation, he tidied up his thoughts and looked at the altar. The red fog was disappearing as if everything was over.

[Lakiratas looks forward to your next meeting.]

The fog disappeared. Only the altar to worship the deity remained.

[Whew!]

The ghost exhaled belatedly. It had been on high alert since Lakiratas revealed its presence.

[Darn it. I didn't expect to be so nervous even when I was already dead.]

“Why are you so scared? Doesn’t seem like something worth fearing.”

[Once you know what kind of entity it is, you'll think differently.]

“We’ll see.”

He had already seen similar things outside.

Taesan indifferently descended the labyrinth. He passed the 3rd floor and arrived at the 4th.

[4th floor quest begins.] [Defeat the boss of the 4th floor and pass.] [Reward: Ashen Wrist Guard.] [Secret Reward: ???]

The reward for the 4th floor was equipment. Ashen Wrist Guard. Considering the rewards given so far, it was likely to be pretty useful equipment. Taesan, who was checking the secret reward, realized something belatedly.

“I haven’t used the reward yet.”

The secret reward ??? from the 3rd floor.

He obtained the reward he hadn’t been able to get by defeating the Lord. He had completely forgotten while dealing with so many rewards. Taesan belatedly started to check.

[You have used ???] [You have obtained a Proficiency Increase Potion.]

“Eh?”

Taesan was taken aback by an unexpected potion.

[Proficiency Increase Potion] [Increases the proficiency of one skill by 5%.]

“Really.”

Increases proficiency. He had never seen such a description. It was surprising since it was a well-known fact that proficiency could only be obtained through endless usage and mastery.

But the reward in itself was splendid.

A full 5%.

Considering that you would have to grind for days to increase the proficiency of a top-tier skill by 5%, it was a very good reward.

For now, he would set it aside. It would be more beneficial to find an appropriate skill to use the potion on rather than using it immediately.

Taesan put the potion into his inventory and turned toward the room. Inside, the dwarf was waiting.

“You’re here?”

“Yes, I am.”

The dwarf, who had been examining Taesan for a moment, had a look of admiration on his face.

“A protective shield? Rakiratas gave that too? He’s really dishing out the rewards.”

“Can you see it?”

“It’s obvious when it’s floating above your head.”

Whether NPCs in the labyrinth had such abilities or had a related skill, it appeared that Taesan’s status was visible to the dwarf’s eyes.

“Looks like you beat Hage-Ha. Did he have a good time?”

“He seemed quite satisfied.”

“Oh? That’s at least a good thing.”

The dwarf said with a poker face.

“There’s nothing harder than meeting a satisfying death here. Just like the guy behind you.”
