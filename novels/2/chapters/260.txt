Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player - Episode 260"

It's Time to Reveal.

Feeling frustrated, he used the unique ability of the angel, 'Divine Execution,' but as long as there was the title of a superior being, there was no way he would be defeated.

[An ordinary human unaffected by Divine Execution. Astonishing.]

Gabriel, who sighed, now utilized telekinesis.

Although Ryu Min felt the intangible force restraining his body, it was only temporary. Whether it was telekinesis or brute strength, Ryu Min managed to break free.

Crash!

Gabriel rolled, destroying objects in his path.

The house was now a mess, evidence of the ongoing battle.

[Aaargh!]

Seemingly driven mad by the heat, the opponent swung the chain wildly.

Avoiding it wasn't difficult, but it was still a troublesome weapon that required constant attention.

'I'd like to cut that chain, but it won't be easy.'

Despite adjusting his strength, Ryu Min couldn't break through with his attacks seeing them all blocked.

'If I can't neutralize the weapon, I have to neutralize something else.'

Ryu Min's movements suddenly accelerated.

Speed to the extent that even Gabriel, who could read the future, struggled to keep up.

A look of surprise flashed on his face.

Understandable, given the speed even he couldn't anticipate.

Swish!

For the first time, Gabriel sprayed golden blood.

Thud!

Both of the arms holding the chain cleanly severed.

[Kkuhh!]

Simultaneously, blood flowed from Raphael's mouth.

'Indeed, Raphael was taking the impact meant for Gabriel.'

Seeing Gabriel unharmed despite his attacks, Ryu Min had his doubts.

He knew that he was receiving a buff from Raphael, preventing damage.

However, could such a powerful buff be used without any cost?

'But in reality, there was a cost. It was absorbing the impact as magical energy.'

The more Ryu Min attacked Gabriel, the more magical energy drained from Raphael.

Once he realized this, Ryu Min shifted his focus from Raphael to Gabriel.

As long as it wasn't Raphael, Gabriel wouldn't pose a significant threat.

[Kkuhhhh...!]

After losing both arms, Gabriel's contorted face in agony was quite a sight, but there was no time to be captivated.

Sha-ah-ah-ah-

In the blink of an eye, his arms were restored.

[Thanks, Raphael.] [You're welcome. But I'm running low on magical energy.] [Already? How much is left?] [At best, around 5%... ] [What?]

Gabriel was genuinely surprised.

Raphael, possessing an ocean-like amount of magical power, had endured three days protecting hundreds of combat angels during the last celestial battle.

However, now he fell to the ground within just five minutes of the current battle?

[Blocking attacks a couple of times and recovering a few times is all I can do. I need time to recover magical energy... ] [Damn. This is serious.]

Watching the two, Ryu Min smirked.

'Looks like they've hit their limits. In that case...'

Observing a sweating Raphael, Ryu Min suddenly disappeared.

As he approached in an instant, Raphael's eyes widened.

[Ah.]

That was Raphael's last word uttered in Ryu Min's house.

Kwa-cha-aang!

A well-aimed attack sent Raphael flying, shattering the living room window.

Thanks to the remaining magical power, it prevented a fatal injury, but there was no avoiding being thrown outside the building.

[R-Raphael!]

A startled Gabriel soon expected it would be his turn.

It was inevitable.

The sturdy support that had been protecting him had lost its strength.

'What the gods said was right. It's tough for just the two of us.'

Cornered, Gabriel sought a way to turn the situation around.

In less than a second, he thought of a solution.

'Why didn't I think of this before?'

Gabriel carefully observed the movements of the black scythe.

Although it seemed like a reckless fight, he felt intuitively that his brother was concerned about him.

'You'll know if you try.'

Shwooroorook!

Ignoring the scythe attacking him, Gabriel threw his chain.

The target was the family of the scythe, trembling in the corner.

'If my guess is correct, the scythe...'

Kaang-!

'Will try to protect its family.'

Sure enough, the black scythe, casting aside the chain, protected its sibling.

[Humans are truly foolish beings.]
ChatGPT

Even if Raphael was providing assistance, why bother protecting a completely useless ordinary person?

Because they're family?

Because they're someone precious?

What good were such emotions during a battle?

If they became a weakness, weren't they just a liability?

It would be more fitting to boldly cast them aside.

"Now that I know the weakness, thoroughly torment them."

Gabriel no longer paid attention to Ryu Min's attacks. He focused solely on Ryu Won, swinging the chain.

Clang-clang!

Every time Ryu Min tried to intervene with the scythe, he couldn't prevent the shockwaves from wreaking havoc in the house.

Kwaang-kwaang!

"Uh, uh!"

As the house became a mess, Ryu Won was frightened. Even a fool could see that an angel was targeting him.

"What should I do? Because of me, Black Scythe is in trouble."

Cornered and unable to move, he faced the Black Scythe protecting him.

And the male angel attacking from various angles.

Ryu Won thought all of this was because of him.

"No, it's not because of you."

Reading his brother's inner thoughts during the battle, Ryu Min silently shook his head.

"It's because of me."

The Archangels were sent from above to kill him. Unable to win through strength alone, they had come to his home, even taking his family hostage.

"Although I set up the protection of the hero in case of such situations..."

He hadn't expected that the time would come so quickly.

Kwaang-kwaang!

"Hehe, foolish human. You're in such a rush to block!"

The chains closed in like a tightening noose.

Now, even a small opening would be enough to stab his brother.

"It's unexpectedly challenging to fight while adjusting my strength."

If Gabriel were an ordinary Archangel, he would have retaliated immediately. However, Gabriel had the ability to read the future three seconds ahead.

Because of this ability, he couldn't find a chance to break through.

"If I create an opening, my brother will get hurt."

Strictly speaking, it wasn't his brother who would get hurt; it would be himself, and the impact wouldn't be trivial.

"But that fellow is stalling for time."

Although it seemed like he was recklessly attacking, it was not the case.
ChatGPT

Even if he himself were to be defeated, there was a calculation in the subconscious that soon Raphael, who had recovered his strength, would come to heal him.

"Before that, let's finish this."

He reluctantly decided to use a bit more power and accelerated his movements.

"Amplify."

A rune of lightning that increased attack speed and movement speed by 100%, making Ryu Min disappear in an instant.

"Huh!"

While Gabriel, bewildered and about to attempt something, the scythe of death had already passed through his lower body, creating a pool of golden blood oozing from the severed section.

"Kuugh..."

Gabriel's expression crumpled like a scroll.

How much pain was this? It seemed to be the first time he had experienced such pain since the celestial battle.

"Looks good."

With a brief comment, Ryu Min felt relieved.

Though the separation of upper and lower body looked gruesome, Gabriel wouldn't die immediately.

"It would be troublesome if he died like this. I haven't used the blessing yet."

First, he would safely move his brother to a secure place, then change into the Helm of Thanatos and deal with these beings.

"Let's go, Ryu Won."

At Ryu Min's gesture, Ryu Won cautiously came out of the room.

There was no time to spare to observe the trashed living room, with a bomb-like chaos and an angel helplessly bleeding in the center.

They just needed to escape this predicament and evacuate outside.

That's when it happened.

Fluttering, an angel entered through the broken living room window.

Seeing the appearance of an ally, Gabriel managed a faint smile.

"R-Raphael...?" [Gabriel-nim!]

Immediately, Raphael started chanting a healing spell, and Gabriel's upper and lower body neatly joined together.

"Kkut, I spilled too much blood; it's dizzying." [Are you okay?] [And you?] [Are you alright?] [I've depleted too much magical energy blocking his attacks. With the current magical power, I can barely defend a few more times.] [He was tougher than expected.]

Gabriel's gaze reached the front door.

The Black Scythe and its family had already escaped.
ChatGPT

"What should we do?" [We have to chase them.] [Isn't it difficult for us alone?] [But we can't go back empty-handed. And it's not entirely hopeless.]

The recent battle made it clear.

What the opponent's weakness was.

"If that guy relentlessly attacks only his brother, the Black Scythe will inevitably reveal a gap."

Now that the weakness was known, with Raphael joining them, they could gain the upper hand in battle compared to before.

"I don't know why he didn't finish me off and ran away, but you made a mistake."

Knowing his brother's location, Gabriel gestured towards his subordinates.

"Let's go." [Yes.]

There was no time to take the elevator.

They had to get away from the angels as quickly as possible.

"This way."

Following the Black Scythe's gesture, Ryu Won, who was running without thinking, soon realized where he had suggested.

"It's a dead end here!"

Shouting in the corridor with only a window, Ryu Won's voice, but the Black Scythe's voice was calm.

"Why do you think it's a dead end?"

Crash-!

"You can go out through the window."

"What?"

Breaking the window with the scythe, the wind rushed in.

Were they suggesting jumping down from the 43rd floor?

For a moment, Ryu Won felt dizzy.

"Don't be scared. I'm not jumping to die."

"T-then..."

"Just hold on tight. No time to explain."

Ryu Won, with a frightened expression, hugged the waist of the Black Scythe.

And then, abruptly.

"Aaah!"

The Black Scythe really jumped out of the window.

For a moment, it felt like they were going to die.

Flutter-

Wings emerged from the back, and the Black Scythe stabilized in mid-air. Ryu Won finally felt relieved.

"Phew... I thought I was going to die."

He heard his brother's voice from behind, but it was too early to feel relieved.

'We succeeded in escaping, but the angels might still pursue us.'

Raphael could heal Gabriel and then immediately track them down.

If he knew their locations.

'On the other hand, not knowing our locations, they might just wait at home.'

After placing his brother in a safe place, Ryu Min planned to go to where the angels were and finish things.

But the thought didn't last long.

The angels followed suit as if they knew.

'So they could track us after all?'
ChatGPT

A sigh escaped, but there was no other choice.

The only option was to kill the angels while carrying his brother.

"This place won't do. At least, we need to get as far away from the city as possible. So that others won't be harmed."

However, the flight speed of the angels was faster than expected.

Ryu Won, who turned around suddenly, shouted in surprise.

"A-a-angel is following us! We're going to get caught!"

"I know."

Ryu Min, who said briefly, lowered the altitude.

'Before killing them, I have to buy some time to talk to my brother at least.'

When they descended to the ground, the angel was above their heads.

"T-the angel is right above us!"

"Just hold on tight."

Confirming that there were no obstacles in the straight line ahead, Ryu Min used the Rune of Light.

'Light Speed.'

With a flash of light, he covered a distance of about 2 km in an instant.

With this, it would take a while for the angels to catch up.

"Huh! Did you teleport for a moment? How did you...?"

"Right now, that's not important. The angels are still chasing us, and they won't let us go until we're dead."

"T-then what should we do?"

"What else can we do? We have to kill them."

He said confidently, but his brother had a cautious look as if he didn't know what to say.

Ryu Min chuckled as if to say he understood.

"Don't worry. If I could have killed them earlier, I would have. They're probably wondering why we ran away instead of killing them."

"Uh, okay."

"Don't worry. The display I showed earlier is not even half of my true power."

"C-can you really win?"

"Of course. But to do that..."

Ryu Min took off the white mask.

And just like removing the mask of the Infiltrator, he released the Assassin's mask.

"I have no choice but to reveal my identity. It's about time."

"What?"

Ryu Won's question quickly turned into surprise.

The body of the Black Scythe was changing.

The height decreased, and the dark skin turned white.

The muscular body became petite, and the face began to resemble someone familiar.

"Hyung...?"
