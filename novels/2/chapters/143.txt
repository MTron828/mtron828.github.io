Title: Episode 143 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Field Training

"We are the 5-Minute Rapid Response Team that immediately deploys upon receiving a report while waiting here. Our top priority mission is to rush to the scene, assess the situation, and rescue citizens from threats."

Ryu Min conducted theoretical training while drawing on a whiteboard set up in the temporary assembly area.

Even though it was evening, the eyes of the members listening to the training were sparkling with enthusiasm.

The person who had resentful eyes just a while ago seemed so absorbed in the training that one might wonder if it was the same person.

"Criminal players often feel like they are special beings, but at the same time, there is fear of whether they can survive the next round. Therefore, when they are cornered, they are in a mentally unstable and dangerous state."

The team members nodded in agreement, understanding the sentiments expressed.

The fear of the next round was something they had all experienced.

"When the mind is exhausted, it's easy to fall into the temptation to do everything one wants before dying in the next round. That's why they have no brakes. The sentiment is to unleash all the impulses that were suppressed before facing failure."

That was why crimes by players occurred frequently.

"So, theft, robbery, rape, murder, etc., there is no hesitation in committing crimes. Since they have already practiced killing people in the fourth round, the murder rehearsal is over for them. They have no fear. They look down on citizens and even mock the police. But now, things are different."

Ryu Min's eyes shone from behind the mask.

"We need to instill fear in them. We also need to change the perception of citizens who distrust both the police and players. From now on, we will conduct practical training to learn about these aspects. In essence, it's a real-life scenario."

The members swallowed nervously.

It was impossible not to feel tense on the first day of practical training.

"The practical training will take place in Seoul. According to statistics, most of the players' residences are concentrated in Seoul. Shall we check if there are any reports received right away?"

Ryu Min turned on the radio that he had turned off.

Static - Static -
ChatGPT

They tuned the frequency to receive reports at any time and checked the computer to see if there were any previous reports.

"Lucky us. Fortunately, there have been no reports during the hour we've been training. It's a pity for those who wanted a practical opportunity, but nonetheless, it's best that we don't have to respond to an emergency."

"Ah."

"Let's resume the training then..."

At that moment, a sound came from the previously silent radio.

"Incident occurrence, incident occurrence, Code Zero One, Code Zero One, emergency bell report for players at a convenience store in Seongnae-dong, please confirm the exact location. Over."

Beep-beep-beep-

The reporting notification system installed in the temporary assembly area also sounded an alarm.

Ryu Min muttered under his breath, "Unlucky."

Certainly, luck was not on their side.

For criminal players.

Ee-yong, ee-yong, ee-yong-

The team members, riding in a van with a police mark, listened to the explanation of the team leader.

"Three minutes ago, we received a report from a convenience store in Seongnae-dong. As the player-specific emergency bell has been pressed, there is a high possibility of being threatened by a player. In other words, it's an emergency situation."

The team members tensed at the mention of an emergency situation.

It was natural since they were going to the scene for the first time, perhaps for a drunk driving check or something.

"Criminal players are like time bombs that can go off at any moment. That's why quick judgment is crucial. Since today is the first day, I'll show you a demonstration. Just watch how it's done."

"Yes!"

After another two minutes, the reported convenience store came into view.

The team members, who arrived precisely in five minutes, rushed in following Ryu Min.

Or, that was the plan.

Until Ryu Min stopped before entering the road.

"Why? Why are you coming out again?"

"The situation has already been assessed. Just go in once."

Within about 5 seconds of entering, the situation was assessed and finished?

With puzzled faces, the team members entered the convenience store.

"Oops!"

"Ah!"

A regretful sigh erupted from the team members' mouths as they saw the scene.

The 40-year-old store owner, presumed to be the reporter, was already dead.

The clear knife marks on the neck and the blood-soaked cash register portrayed a gruesome scene.

"That damn bastard. Attacking an ordinary person with no resistance..."
ChatGPT

"Where the hell did this bastard go?"

The enraged team members were agitated, but there was no sign of any commotion at the convenience store.

Judging by the open cash register, it seemed like the culprit took money from the owner, killed them, and made a run for it.

The members, who had just come out briskly, approached Ryu Min, who was surveying the surroundings.

"Team leader, we've checked the area."

"Alright, have you assessed the situation?"

"Yes. The person who seems to be the owner is dead, and the culprit seems to have disappeared. But how did you finish assessing the situation so quickly?"

"When I entered, I found a middle-aged civilian who appeared to be the store owner dead at the cash register, and there's no sign detected by our senses. Just seeing this, you can tell that the guy killed and fled."

"Ah. Then should we go inside and look for evidence against the culprit? Maybe check the surveillance footage..."

"He's not just a common criminal; he's a player. It's an urgent situation with a guy who is essentially a walking time bomb. There's no time to leisurely collect evidence. We don't know when another victim might appear."

"Ah..."

The team members nodded in agreement, acknowledging that what Ryu Min said was true.

"Now what do we do? We don't have any information about the culprit."

"No information indeed. Looking at the situation, it seems like the traces of someone urgently fleeing are evident. It's probably his first time killing a civilian. He's not likely to be a smart one either."

"What? How do you know that?"

"Firstly, there's no cash in the cash register. The motive was money. He achieved his goal but still killed the store owner. It was probably out of fear of being reported. But even after killing the owner, he didn't use a basic skill to erase the common traces? The guy who killed someone out of fear of being reported left evidence stupidly. Why do you think that happened?"

"Well, I'm not sure."

"He probably got flustered after killing someone. In other words, he's a newbie unfamiliar with such situations. Most likely, it's his first time killing a civilian."

"..."

The team members were left astonished, half-opening their mouths.

To make such judgments with just a brief glance?

The more you see of the team leader, the more surprising they become.

"Where do you think a newbie criminal, who killed a civilian for the first time, would run off to?"

"Well, I'm not sure."
ChatGPT

"In my opinion..."

Ryu Min shifted his steps towards the alley next to the convenience store.

"He probably escaped through a narrow alley like this rather than the open main road. He likely wanted to hide inconspicuously in a dark place for the time being."

"Ah, then if we follow the alley, we might find him?"

"That's right. What we need now is the skill for exploring the surroundings. Should I try using the skill first?"

Ryu Min activated one of the common skills, [Surroundings Exploration].

It functions like a minimap, showing the surroundings within a radius of 500 meters.

In front of Ryu Min, a map window appeared, visible to others as well.

The map showed many red dots, seemingly indicating living beings. Among them, there was one dot that was moving.

"Look. Can you see the guy on the map running into the alley?"

"Uh, yes, I can really see it!"

As Ryu Min mentioned, there was a dot moving exclusively along the alley, as if trying to avoid people's eyes.

"That guy is highly likely the culprit."

"Oh!"

"Let's try to catch him before he escapes."

"Yes, understood!"

The team members followed Ryu Min into the alley.

However, as the distance quickly widened, Ryu Min's figure disappeared from their sight.

"What, what's going on? Did the team leader's speed increase like that?"

As if it were a car or a bicycle?

Although they were running at full speed, they couldn't catch up with Ryu Min's running pace.

That was only natural.

During the duel, Ryu Min wasn't wearing any items, but now he was fully equipped with gear.

With a significant increase in agility stats, his movement speed couldn't be the same as before.

As the team leader's unseen figure continued to run, the team members sighed.

"We can't catch up. Absolutely not."

"The more we see, the more impressive he is."

Having lost sight of Ryu Min, they had no choice but to rely on the surroundings exploration skill.

The members with the skill checked the map and chased after the Black Scythe.

Not long after, the team members could see a confrontation between Black Scythe and a suspect in the alley.

However, the suspect had someone's neck in his grip.

"Don't come any closer! You damn bastard!"

"P-please, save me. Please."
ChatGPT

A woman in her mid-30s was being held hostage by the suspect.

It seemed that the player was once again threatening a civilian.

"That crazy son of a...!"

It appeared that, while running through the alley, the suspect had encountered and taken the woman as a hostage.

Looking at the man holding a dagger to the woman's neck, the team members were convinced.

He was undoubtedly the culprit who killed the store owner and fled.

"Who the hell are you guys! Why are you chasing me! If you come any closer, I'll slit this woman's throat!"

The team members hesitated.

In this situation, a wrong move could result in a hole in the neck.

Provoking the man without careful consideration might lead to a terrible outcome.

"Um, sir, please calm down..."

"Sir my ass! Do I look like a sir to you? Huh!?"

Seeing the agitated culprit, who was even spitting while speaking, it was clear that his mental state wasn't stable.

"Hey, what's with the guy in the mask? Why is he silently staring at me? Is he your friend? And why haven't you put away your weapons?"

"Please, spare us, spare us..."

"Hey, you damn bitch, try to keep quiet! Do you want to provoke me? Shut up, or else, stab..."

That's when it happened.

Boom!

The man's head seemed to explode as if hit by a bomb.

Ryu Min's whip-like extended scythe precisely pierced through the suspect's face.

Swiftly and without any chance for a reaction.

Splash-

The woman, terrified by the sight of the corpse, crawled back in fear.

Swoosh-

Ryu Min, who mercilessly killed the suspect, retrieved his scythe.

Witnessing this coldness, the team members were left speechless and dumbfounded.

"Are you okay?"

"Y-yes..."

"Don't worry. You're safe now."

Ryu Min reassured the trembling woman and then turned to the team members.

"Why did you do that?"

"W-why did you kill the suspect without arresting him...?"

"According to the major player regulations, there are two cases where the immediate disposal of criminal players is allowed. One is when the player has committed serious crimes such as murder, robbery, and rape. The other is when it is judged to be an emergency situation causing harm to civilians. He falls under both categories. Killing the store owner is just circumstantial evidence, but checking the CCTV and matching the attire should provide proof. Even if not, he was already a target for immediate disposal as he posed a threat to civilians at the moment he killed the store owner."

"..."

"At the scene, swift decision-making is more vital than anything else. The speed at which you apprehend criminals can prevent additional victims. It's the same now. If I hadn't intervened, there could have been a second victim just because she crossed paths with him in the alley."

The team members couldn't deny it.

Perhaps if Ryu Min hadn't chased after them, the woman would have died simply because they encountered each other in the alley.

Ryu Min's pursuit with the scythe caused the suspect to panic and take the woman as a hostage.

"It was too dangerous to apprehend him alive without killing. This is why immediate disposal was necessary. Comparing players to time bombs also stems from this. If you can't wrap the entire body to stop the time bomb, it's wise to remove the detonator early by neutralizing the threat."

In reality, Ryu Min didn't just remove the detonator but obliterated the entire brain. However, the team members didn't consider it a cruel punishment.

Having already witnessed the brutal murder scene, they couldn't afford to sympathize with the criminal.

Well, even if that wasn't the case, they were members ready to go after criminals.

"Team leader, what about the body? Should we handle it by erasing the traces?"

"No, we can't obliterate the evidence. Regular police must have received the report and are on their way here. Our job is to deal with player threats and report the situation. The rest can be left to the civilians."

"Oh, I see."

"Now, after watching the demonstration, you roughly understand what to do, right? The key is quick decision-making, tracking down criminals, and saving lives. Got it?"

"Yes! We understand!"

Seeing the well-prepared team members, Ryu Min couldn't help but smile contentedly under his mask.
