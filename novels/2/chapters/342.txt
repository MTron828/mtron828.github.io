Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player - Episode 342"

101st Round (6)

Ryumin, who saw Terra, was surprised.

'Absorbing 20 million Terra just by catching two....'

He felt a powerful force engulfing his entire body.

A feeling of vitality filling his entire body.

Instinctively, he knew how to utilize Terra.

'When using skills, covering them with Terra enhances the effect.'

The power to trace Chaos tearing through space also originated from Terra.

In other words, consuming a lot of Terra could deal confirmed damage to Chaos.

'So, that's why you need to gather Terra.'

To inflict definite damage on Chaos, more Terra is needed.

Therefore, even though he became rich in Terra in an instant, greed arose.

The desire to kill gods for more abilities and Terra.

However, Ryumin shook off the temptation, lowering his head.

'I won't kill innocent gods. First, I'll only kill gods helping Chaos.'

Having more Terra is a joyful thing, but he has no intention of committing merciless slaughter.

Aren't gods also a form of life?

'I may have killed angels and demons, but...'

After letting out a self-deprecating laugh, he checked the newly acquired skills.

[Temporary Skill - Master of Waiting]

Effect: A passive skill that completely dominates light and air. Can exert various physical forces.

[Temporary Skill - Jailer of Hell]

Effect: A passive skill that controls and manages the underground prison Tartaros.

'Both are not bad.'

His level had also increased to 463, and his stats had increased significantly.

Satisfactory results.

However, the place was eerie to celebrate.

There were people bound.

'Humans like me? They seem to have been brutally tortured.'

The human bound and bleeding heavily, whom Ryumin had never seen before, wasn't a comrade.

'At least they weren't my fellow players.'

Thinking that he looked young and might have been eliminated early, Ryumin shuddered for a moment.

It was because he read the person's inner thoughts and identified his identity.

'Who is this person...?'

Recognizing that it wasn't a threat, Ryumin first cut the ropes that bound the person with a sickle.

Snick

The human lying on the ground groaned and struggled to lift their head despite the pain when they saw Ryumin.

"T-Thank you... for saving me..."

"You're a player, aren't you? And you've undergone regression a hundred times."

Was it surprise at Ryumin's words?

The focus shifted to the eyes of the person who had been collapsing.

"How did you know that...?"

"I'm also a player. You could say I'm your junior, considering the number of regressions."

"J-Junior...?"

To the confused individual, Ryumin introduced himself.

"My nickname is Black Scythe. I'm gearing up for the 7th celestial demon battle, still participating in rounds as a player. And you?"

"I'm Kang Hansik... My player nickname is the same."

"Are you Korean?"

"Korea? Where's that country?"

Ryumin quickly realized that the other person wasn't from the same Earth.

"It seems the Earth I'm on and your Earth are different."

"More importantly, how did you know I've regressed a hundred times?"

In this situation, Ryumin decided to be honest.

"I have a rune that reads thoughts."

"T-Really?"

"Yes. I unconsciously knew that you had regressed a hundred times. Did you obtain the Rune of Time Reversal?"

"Yes. By any chance, did you also...?"

"Yes. I also obtained the Rune of a Hundred Regressions."

"Ah, so that's why you referred to me as your junior."

"What happened? Kang Hansik. Seeing you here, it seems like you've passed the Final Round. Why are you in such a predicament? What happened during this time?"

"Well... it's a long story..."

With a sigh, Kang Hansik recalled the past.

"It was on New Year's Day. A devil appeared and told me to clear up to Round 20."

"Your guide was a devil, huh? Ours were angels."
ChatGPT

"I see. What about the angels? Are they truly angelic in personality?"

"They're no different from demons."

"Haha, somehow I had a feeling it would be like that. Still, angels are at least beautiful, while demons, in appearance and actions, are the embodiment of evil."

Kang Hansik, with his teeth chattering, seemed to shudder even at the thought.

"The game was hell itself. I heard the devil's explanation in the first round, and before even catching goblins, fear took over. But luckily, I got an extraordinary rune and had the chance to overcome the difficulties."

"The Rune of Time Reversal, you mean."

"Yes, that rune turned an ordinary me into an extraordinary being. I thought I had gone insane after dying a hundred times, but... I never gave up until the end. I believed in the promise of granting a wish."

"So, after a hundred regressions, you managed to pass the Final Round?"

"That's right."

Ryumin suddenly remembered.

The species that loses in the Celestial Demon Battle gets the opportunity to breed humans in the next war.

"How many Celestial Demon Battles have you been through?"

"For the Final Round, you mean? As far as I remember, it was the 6th."

Ryumin realized this person was in his previous unit.

"In the 5th Celestial Demon Battle, angels won, so in the 6th, demons must have taken over the program. That means this person was in my previous unit."

"But even in the program run by demons, there was a Rune of Time Reversal?"

This implies that the attempt to kill Chaos is not the first.

"Gaia designed it so that weapons could be created regardless of angels or demons."

If Ryumin had ended up as a demon instead of an angel in the program run by demons?

"If you kill the devil guide, a Death Class advancement item comes out, and if you defeat demon nobles, you receive the Blessing of Angels in reverse? But isn't the Akashic Record in the heavenly realm? So how would you contact Luvahia in the case of falling to demons?"

As he continued his thoughts, a natural question arose.

"The sure thing is that this person doesn't know. He doesn't know about Luvahia and Gaia's existence."

Despite reaching the Final Round, they didn't know about their existence?

In other words, it would be correct to assume that their completion as weapons was insufficient, preventing them from meeting them.
ChatGPT

"Kang Hansik, have you ever tried killing demons during the progress?"

"Demons? How would one kill those bastards? They can crush people with just their gaze."

'Indeed, it seems that even the guide from the demon side is given the power to kill demons.'

If Kang Hansik had never killed demons, his growth would have been extraordinary, at least in the eyes of the gods.

Ryumin took this opportunity to ask some curious questions.

"Kang Hansik, was the Round 20 boss also a Red Dragon for you?"

"Yes. I can't remember its full name, but I'm sure about that. Barely managed to kill the creature with my comrades and proceeded to the Final Round."

'While the role of the guide is different, the content of the rounds seems to be the same.'

Ryumin chuckled and said, "Still, I envy you for having comrades. I, on the other hand, thought we had insufficient numbers and sacrificed one regression."

"What are you talking about? Sacrificing a regression because of insufficient numbers?"

"I'm talking about the boss room. If there aren't at least five people when entering, it disappears, right?"

"Disappear? What on earth are you talking about...?"

A puzzled reaction.

Thinking Ryumin might be mistaken, he asked in more detail.

"There wasn't a restriction on the number of people when entering the boss room?"

"There was no such thing."

"There wasn't a condition that it disappears if there are less than five people when entering?"

"Definitely not. Can't remember important rounds like Round 20."

To verify the truth, Ryumin delved into Kang Hansik's thoughts.

'It's the same. The guardians guarding before entering the boss room, the transition to the boss room once on the platform.'

But there was one difference.

There was a discrepancy in the entry conditions.

'Their system didn't have a 5-person limit...'

Ryumin's face froze as if his brain had suddenly shut down.

Somehow, it felt like he had been hit in the back of the head.

Had he lost the 99th regression due to that restriction?

"What happened afterward? Did you pass the Final Round alone?"

"Ah, that's what we were talking about. Yes, indeed. As the only one who passed the Final Round, I went to a place called the Room of Wishes. And I made a wish. I didn't need power or anything; I just asked to erase all memories from the experiences in this otherworld."

"Memories?"
ChatGPT

"It was too painful, you know? The images of dead comrades lingered in my mind. How could I live alone with that?"

"..."

"But they said, even if the contribution score is insufficient, memories can't be erased. Then I asked if they could make me rich, and surprisingly, that was possible. So, I asked them to do that for me. I wanted to live comfortably for the rest of my life without worrying about anything."

Ryumin nodded as if he understood. After regressing a hundred times, Kang Hansik probably just wanted some rest now.

At that moment, a faint smile appeared on Kang Hansik's lips, as if recalling that time.

"It was such a good time. I didn't have to worry about being dragged every month, and a huge sum of money was deposited in my bank account. I became what's commonly known as a 'gold spoon' in my twenties. Ah, I'm not sure if you're familiar with the term."

"Yes, we use that expression too."

"Oh, really? Anyway, I lived without money worries, met a beautiful wife, and even had children like rabbits. I lived without regrets. Even without the power of the system, I was truly, truly happy."

The end of his life was simple.

After living for more than a hundred years, happily raising grandchildren and great-grandchildren, he peacefully passed away in old age.

"It was a life without regrets. But I didn't know until the end. That beyond this, hell was waiting..."

"What happened?"

Kang Hansik, who had been gloomy, sighed and continued his story.

"While spending time in the underworld, I heard from the guardian that my wife and children were trapped in Tartarus. Then, everything turned upside down. I don't know if you're aware, but Tartarus is a notorious prison."

"So you came to rescue your family?"

"Yes. I was just an ordinary soul, and there was nothing I could do, but I simply couldn't stand by."

What happened afterward was predictable.

In an attempt to rescue his family, he infiltrated Tartarus, but ultimately got caught by the warden, Erebus, and suffered daily torture.

"I endured the torture, believing that if I could endure, my family wouldn't be harmed. I endured relentlessly, even sacrificing everything, even my family's share. It felt like I might die at any moment, but I couldn't die; that was the reality of this place."

"So, you've been living like this for years?"

"Yes. This is the story of my experiences until now."
ChatGPT

Ryumin nodded thoughtfully, reflecting on Kang Hansik's life.

Kang Hansik, a player from another Earth, had the ability to regress 100 times, just like Ryumin. However, unlike Ryumin, he had no ambition to kill demons and simply grew in an ordinary way. The only remarkable achievement was conquering the Final Round and making a modest wish for wealth.

"In summary, he regressed a hundred times but didn't reach the level of wielding a god's weapon like me. That's why he never had a chance to contact Luviahiwa."

In the aspect of desiring a normal life, Ryumin realized there wasn't much difference between them.

"If I hadn't killed angels... If I hadn't killed the Archangel and had grown moderately to conquer the Final Round... Would my life have been different?"

Ryumin shook his head as if trying to erase these meaningless fantasies. It was too late to turn back now.

Above all, when looking back at Kang Hansik's life, it was difficult to consider it a success.

Wasn't he enduring a painful life in an underground prison?

His wife and children, too.

"Mr. Kang Hansik, do you know where your family is being held?"

"I know."

Ryumin smiled as he spoke.

"Guide me. Since we've met like this, it must be fate. Let me help you escape."
