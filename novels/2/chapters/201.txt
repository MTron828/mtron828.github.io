Title: Episode 201 of the 100th Regression for Max Level Players

The Fifth Trial

[Hidden Sub-Quest Available!]

└ Overcome three or more trials alone

└ Upon success ▶ Rune Package Reward

[You have completed the sub-quest!] [Rune Package has been delivered to your inventory.]

Ryumin, satisfied with the rewards, smiled.

'It's here. Sub-quest rewards.'

The reason he had been facing the trials alone until now was not for any other purpose.

He had to obtain the rewards from the sub-quests.

'The first trial didn't count since I didn't directly face it.'

From the second to the fourth, he handled them all alone.

That allowed him to claim the rewards, but in reality, this round had one more sub-quest.

'That's why I brought the tactician.'

In the last, the fifth trial, he planned to use the tactician to obtain the reward for the second sub-quest as well.

'Not just me, but all party members, of course.'

Except for the tactician among the party members.

'Should I try my luck with the draw?'

Ryumin immediately manipulated the system and used the Rune Package.

[You have used the Rune Package.] [Congratulations! You have obtained the 'Rune of Reputation'!] [The acquired rune is automatically engraved on the player's body!] [Rune of Reputation]

Effect: Reputation gained in otherworldly realms increases by one level. There is no neutrality; one can receive friendly treatment anywhere.

Ryumin himself didn't know what rune would come out of the Rune Package.

Although he didn't know if the result was determined at the moment of obtaining the item, a new rune came out with each round.

'So, I didn't have high expectations, but....'

A quite good rune came out.

'Reputation in otherworldly realms rises by one more level.'

Neutrality can be treated as friendly, and friendliness can be elevated to extremely friendly.

Sure enough, after obtaining the rune, his reputation changed.
ChatGPT

[Human Reputation for the Last Time Reverser has increased from 'Ally of Heaven' to 'Hostile.'] [Devil's Reputation for the Black Scythe has increased from 'Friendly' to 'Very Friendly.'] [Human Reputation for the Black Scythe has increased from 'Friendly' to 'Very Friendly.'] [Elf's Reputation for the Black Scythe has increased from 'Very Friendly' to 'Eternal Alliance.']

..............

..............

..............

All reputations have increased by one level.

All titles that Ryumin possesses have also been upgraded.

'Except for the Last Time Reverser, I can now receive friendly treatment from all races.'

All neutral reputations turned friendly, and the originally good reputations became even better.

Especially the reputations with demons, dwarves, and elves.

Ryumin's lips naturally curled up because there was something to gain from them.

'This should significantly shorten the time.'

Since there was no need to work hard on reputation tasks, it became easier to obtain what he desired.

'It's similar to conquering round 13 without any hassle.'

When it reaches round 13, he originally planned to visit only the elves, but now he should also visit the dwarves.

After finishing his business, Ryumin gestured to his waiting comrades.

"Let's go."

Thanks to Ryumin, the party members, who had successfully conquered, soon arrived at the location of the last trial.

"Is this the place?"

In front of them was a path where nothing could be seen, like an abyss.

Unable to release their steps as they couldn't know what was beyond the path, a message appeared at the right moment.

└ Within 1 hour, all party members must pass through the traps and reach the end of the passage

└ Upon success ▶ Register as the survival team and calculate experience points for rewards

└ Upon failure ▶ Total party annihilation

'Total party annihilation upon failure?'

Ignoring the startled John, an explanatory message appeared.

[In front of you lies a passage covered in the darkness of an abyss that cannot be illuminated by any light.] [Traps are scattered throughout the darkness, and upon contact with a trap, the target will be annihilated immediately.] [However, when the target is annihilated, the trap is simultaneously removed and does not regenerate.] [If all party members safely reach the end of the passage within the time limit, the trial will end.] [On the contrary, if they cannot reach the end of the passage by the end of the time limit, it will be considered a failure.] [Note that, except for summoning, all skills are prohibited here.] [Due to narrow visibility, rely on each other's backs and calmly strategize.]

Perhaps because it's the last trial, failure means complete party annihilation.

John, shouting as if venting his pent-up frustration, said determinedly, "10 million points and a sincere apology. If you don't do these two things right away, I won't cooperate. Then, not only you but all party members will be annihilated. Me? I don't care if I die, as long as I can kill you."

Though he spoke in such a manner, in reality, it was just an empty threat.

Who in the world would put their own life on the line just to try to kill someone else?

The desire for revenge was strong, but John wasn't that extreme.

'But I have to make such a threat for him to accept the deal, right?'

To make the Black Scythe kneel, he had to come out strongly.

After all, the fate of that guy's lifeline was in his hands, so there was no need to be afraid.

'If I get 10 million points, I can buy an experience pack and reach max level in one go. Then, I should be able to compete with the current Black Scythe.'

He had also prepared a plan for when the conquest ended and the party was disbanded.

He didn't casually offer 10 million points without any thought.

'You have no choice but to accept. Why? Because not only your life is at stake but also the lives of other party members. Kuhuhu.'

Since that guy is also human, he can't be without guilt.

Even to save his party members, he would have to lower himself and agree.

At least, that's what he thought.

"Get lost."

"Alright. I accept the deal... What?"

John's mind went blank for a moment at the unexpected response.

"What did you just say?"

"I told you to get lost. We'll find our way through."

"Huh, this bastard must be out of his mind. Didn't you hear the explanation? If you touch a trap, you'll be annihilated immediately. Without any way to illuminate the darkness. Do you think you can avoid the traps and proceed just like that? Even if you're skilled, you'll have to rely on my summons, won't you?"

"Wait and see."

"What?"

John, bewildered by the unexpected answer, burst into laughter.

"Damn, alright, go ahead and try. Are you trying to rely on your instincts like an idiot? Even if you somehow manage to avoid the traps, do you think you can go on like that forever without knowing what's ahead?"

"Let's see about that."

With baseless confidence, John ignored the Black Scythe's advice and stood in front of the passage.

No matter where he looked, all he could see was darkness in the abyss-like passage.
ChatGPT

Entering that space itself was terrifying, but the Black Scythe took the first step without hesitation.

'Huh? Everything seems fine?'

As if standing above the darkness, the Black Scythe, in perfect condition, turned to look at the comrades.

"What are you waiting for? Don't just stand there, follow me."

"Oh, yes!"

"Line up in a row and follow. Stay no more than 3 steps away from the person in front. If you hesitate and take the wrong turn, you might face annihilation right there."

The Black Scythe, saying this, took the lead and walked.

Walking through the darkness was not a difficult task for him.

'He seems bewildered.'

Looking at the tactician standing alone, Ryumin smirked.

'Well, that's understandable. He's walking through this abyss of darkness without even a summoned creature.'

Originally, the trial was supposed to require a summoned creature according to the conquest strategy. Walking with a summoned creature, falling into a trap, and then proceeding with a summoned creature again – that was the key strategy for this trial.

But for Ryumin, a regressive player, a summoned creature was unnecessary.

'Because I have memorized the path.'

Where to go safely, where the traps are, even if I can't see them – I know it all.

Because I've learned and memorized everything through experience.

'After walking five steps, a trap will come out.'

Ryumin avoided the trap and walked beside the two footsteps.

Then, like a train game, the party members followed suit.

'This way, there's no risk of annihilation. There's no need for a summoner.'

In reality, the cave of the trial was at a level where Ryumin alone could conquer it.

The party members were only gathered to proceed with the trial.

In fact, no matter who became a party member, the trial was already prepped.

'Someone might ask this. If I can conquer it alone, why bother putting a tactician in the party?'

The reason was simple.

He needed to trigger the second sub-quest.

'The condition for the second sub-quest is [Overcome the trial without the help of a summoner].'

In other words, leave the summoner in the rear, let the rest of the team reach the end of the passage first, and the second sub-quest is completed.

'And then, all members except the summoner receive the sub-quest reward.'

Then, what happens to the summoner who entered last?
ChatGPT

Not only would he fail to receive the reward, but he would also receive a permanent debuff.

That was the reason John Delgado was reluctantly inserted into the party.

To achieve the second sub-quest and give him a permanent debuff.

'If you wanted to assassinate me, you should've paid the price.'

Smirking, Ryumin stepped onto the final ground.

Thunk-

Following Ryumin, Minjuri, Jeffrey, and Jusungtak safely reached the end of the passage, and a message appeared.

[You have completed the sub-quest!]
