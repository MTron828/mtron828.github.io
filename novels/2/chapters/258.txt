Title: "Episode 258 of the 100th Rebirth for a Max Level Player"

The Younger Brother is in Danger.

Ryumin had once invoked the hero's protection for his younger brother in the past.

A miraculous protective skill that grants invincibility for 10 seconds when under attack.

Is that skill activated now?

The meaning was clear.

"My brother... is in danger."

He didn't even know if the skill he had set just in case would really be triggered.

[Time remaining until choice: 00:00:09]

"There's not much time."

He doesn't know who attacked his brother.

He only knows that he needs to make a quick decision to ensure his brother's safety.

[Please choose one of the following.]

└ 1. Move to the target

└ 2. Summon the target

[Time remaining until choice: 00:00:08]

"I have to choose one now."

In the case of option 1, there is an advantage in teleporting to the target and seeking revenge immediately...

"But there's a risk of my brother getting involved in the fight."

On the other hand, option 2 has the advantage of summoning his brother and completely protecting him from the attacker.

"If I think about safety, it's option 2, but immediate revenge is impossible."

[Time remaining until choice: 00:00:06]

Time is running out.

It's decision time.

Ryumin's lips were dry.

10 minutes before the start of Round 16.

"Gabriel, is it really right for just the two of us to go?"

At the provoking words, a wrinkle formed on Gabriel's smooth forehead.

"What are you talking about, Rafael? Are you doubting my skills right now?" [No, that's not what I mean, but to cleanly finish it, wouldn't it be better to involve Lord Michael as well...?]

Rafael stopped speaking mid-sentence.

Gabriel's face was now horribly distorted.

"On top of trying to stop me from going alone, are you suggesting that we're not enough? Am I that incapable?"

"If I've offended you, I apologize."

Though Gabriel was upset, it didn't mean he couldn't understand.

[I understand as well. The human called the Black Scythe unexpectedly poses a threat to our Archangels.]

[....]

[But humans are still humans. Just because a lizard sprouted wings doesn't mean it can become a dragon. There's no need to worry; nothing significant will happen.]

[I'm not worried either. During the 5th Heavenly Demon War, who else but me witnessed the exploits of Lord Gabriel up close? Moreover, Lord Gabriel has the ability to see the future.]

[Calling it the future is a bit modest. It's just predicting the opponent's movements.]

[Still, thanks to that ability, hasn't Lord Gabriel gained the reputation of being a hero and the Archangel of Providence?]

[Knowing that, why do you speak as if you're uneasy?]

[We've sent Archangels before, but haven't they continuously failed? I wanted to ensure a decisive conclusion this time. The potential of that insignificant human is beyond expectations.]

[Don't worry. It will be fine. With you and me together.]

It wasn't an empty promise.

Although Rafael had no combat abilities, he held the rank of 3rd among the Archangels.

If supported by her, known as the Healing Archangel, Gabriel had nothing to fear.

[Even without Lord Michael, we can overwhelm them. I guarantee I can kill in one minute, no, 10 seconds.]

[Are you going to kill without subduing?]

[He's already a human who killed four Archangels. There's no shortage of reasons to execute him.]

Rafael nodded, but this was a decision made solely by Gabriel.

Since Michael had instructed not to kill but to subdue.

'Can't let that filthy creature ascend to the heavens.'

He had intended to use Time Stop to explode the head as soon as he saw it, but the chances of success were low.

Seeing other Archangels die so futilely.

'Even if Time Stop fails, killing is easy.'

If ordered not to kill but felt compelled to do so due to a perceived threat to life?

Michael would have to acknowledge it.

[Lord Gabriel. Round 16 has begun.]

[Since the round setting is in the human realm, we can descend without any cost.]

Gabriel smirked and pulled out a golden chain.

[Alright, let's go. Let's finish this quickly.]

[Yes.]

[Wait a moment!]

Just as they were about to descend, Gabriel suddenly stopped.

[Why are you doing this?]

[Divine revelation.]

[Yes?]

[God has called for me.]

It wasn't something particularly surprising.

As the Archangel of Providence, Gabriel occasionally heard the voice of God.

[He says for you to come with me.]

[Who is speaking?]

[You'll know when you see.]

Saying so, Gabriel led the way, and Rafael followed behind him.

Passing through the palace of the heavens, they arrived at a place surrounded by a barrier.

Swoosh—

As they pierced through the barrier, time seemed to stop, and a silent darkness enveloped the surroundings.

[Ah....]

[There's nothing to be afraid of.]

A surprised Rafael turned his gaze to where a pitch-black darkness lay.
ChatGPT

[This is my domain, where no one can interfere. It's not a place created out of fear but suitable for discreet conversations.]

[R-Really sorry for showing my, my unworthy self. O Lord.]

There was a reason why Rafael was trembling.

The being in front of him was a colossal figure that surpassed his expectations.

Knowing this fact, Gabriel asked in the most polite tone possible.

[May we inquire about the reason you summoned us?] [I heard that a certain human is causing headaches. So, I decided to investigate a bit.] [Investigate...?] [I mean, the strength and weaknesses of the human called the Black Scythe.] [Ah...]
[Are you curious about the results?] [Yes.]

After a moment of silence, the voice of God flowed from the darkness.

[It was concluded that with your combined strength, you cannot handle him directly.] [....]

Even combining the 2nd and 3rd ranked Archangels couldn't defeat one human?

It was a statement that trampled on their pride, but Gabriel didn't show any reaction.

In front of a God who ranked at the highest level even among gods, anyone would be mindful of their expression.

[There's no chance in a direct confrontation. If I hadn't called you, like other Archangels, you would have lost your physical forms and perished.]
[...While it may sound impertinent, we are confident. We will definitely avenge and restore the honor of the heavens.]
[You're saying the same things as the already dead Archangels.]
[....]
[Did those fellows die because they lacked confidence? No, they died simply because they were overpowered. They were also ignorant.]
[....]
[The ignorant often brim with confidence. If you build baseless confidence without accurately gauging the opponent's level, how are you any different from the dead Archangels?]
[I apologize. I was short-sighted.]

Gabriel sighed, but God was merciful.

[Lift your head. I didn't summon you here to kill your confidence.] [Then...?] [I called you to assist with your strategy. I've identified the human's weaknesses.]

"Weaknesses?"

Finally, the words heard from God were somewhat surprising.

Considering they came from God, the method was quite humble.
ChatGPT

[Animals tend to cherish their families. The human known as the Black Scythe has only one family. Tell him the location and make him take hostages. Then, the Black Scythe will have no choice but to surrender.] [Certainly, capturing hostages could lead the situation in our favor.]

Upon learning this unknown fact, Gabriel's lips formed a subtle smile.

While normally one might find it distasteful, now was not the time to be picky about means and methods. Gabriel was not originally the type to nitpick about such things.

[It's indeed a strategy that appeals to me. Hehe.] [Well, the conversation is over. Report to Michael and leave.]

Suddenly, the darkness that had enveloped the surroundings disappeared, and the light of heaven illuminated the area.

[Let's go, Raphael.]

Before heading out, the two angels stopped by the headquarters and met Michael. After discussing the conversation with God, Michael showed an unusually surprised expression.

[God... made such a suggestion?] [It wasn't a suggestion but an order. In my judgment, targeting hostages first seemed reasonable.] [Hmm....]

Michael had to hide his surprise.

'He intervened to that extent... Wasn't He originally uninterested in our affairs?'

It was a known unknown, but the crucial point was that the situation had become more serious.

'If we had faced him head-on, Black Scythe might have won, as Luvahi said...'

But if they capture hostages, the situation changes. It would limit Black Scythe's actions.

[Then, we'll go now.] [...Sure.]

With no justification to detain them, Michael could only watch the departing figures of the two angels.

└ Content: Hello. I'm a father with a 24-year-old son. Our son has joined a group called the Cult of Sashin.

He used to wait in his room before midnight, but this time, he left, saying he has to start overseas.

He says it's something the Cult of Sashin asked him to do, but they won't disclose where he's going.

They say not to worry since it's related to the Cult of Sashin, but is it trustworthy?

[Total Comments: 9]

└ Reply: I'm a mom with a 20-year-old daughter. I was worried when she said she has to go overseas alone because she's a member of the Cult of Sashin. But it seems there's someone in the same situation as me.

└ Oh, so the statement about going overseas as a group from the Cult of Sashin is true?

└ It seems so.
ChatGPT

└My younger sibling received a message to go overseas from the Cult of Sashin. Black Scythe instructed not to reveal where they are going under any circumstances, as it could endanger others.

└At least my son didn't lie. Thank you for the response.

└My acquaintance is also a player in the Cult of Sashin, and it seems trustworthy. They have provided strategies, and that's how I managed to survive.

└Are there still people suspecting the Cult of Sashin?

└The Cult of Sashin is trustworthy. Especially since it's operated by Black Scythe. There must be a reason, so trust and wait.

└In Round 15, Black Scythe took care of the Cult of Sashin members. There won't be anything to worry about.

Ryuwon, reading a post on the player community "Plagal," nodded in agreement, seemingly empathizing.

"Many people here seem worried like me."

He had already checked because of his brother, who had been staying out overnight, and now there was such a post.

"Maybe he went to meet his girlfriend?"

After all, why would someone who always stayed at home suddenly go out overnight?

He must have had something to deal with.

"Anyway, thankfully. Since he joined the Cult of Sashin, there's nothing to worry about."

Worried about his brother's well-being, Ryuwon went to his room feeling somewhat relieved.

Thud-

Closing the door and lying down on the bed, he closed his eyes.

Various thoughts came to mind, but most of them were concerns about his brother.

"Will he survive this time too? He's none other than the Prophet."

Although he still couldn't sleep well due to worry, it wasn't as severe as before.

"Nothing will happen. As long as he's in the Cult of Sashin, Black Scythe will protect him."

As usual, when he slept and woke up, his brother, who had returned home, would greet him with a smile.

Believing this, Ryuwon fell asleep.

It wasn't the time to worry about his brother now.

[@!%!@#%......]

"What is this sound?"

Still awake, Ryuwon heard voices in his ears.

He thought it might be noise from the neighboring floor, but that was only for a moment.

The sound was coming from a closer place than he thought.

[!@#!@......] [%&#!@......]

Since the voices were different, at least two people were conversing.

Guessing the origin, it seemed to be coming from the living room.

"Co-Could it be a burglar?"

Could a burglar enter without making any noise like this?
ChatGPT

Tension ran down Ryuwon's spine.

At that moment, when there was no thought in his mind about what to do next.

Thunk!

The door creaked open, allowing light to flood in.

"You were hiding here."

The presumed intruder, whom Ryuwon thought was a thief, turned out to be an angel.

A dazzlingly beautiful male angel and a female angel.

However, given the widespread atrocities committed by the angels, the public's image of angels was no better than that of demons.

Shivering, Ryuwon was met with a smirk from the male angel.

"Looks like even a pathetic human like you recognizes strength."

"Is this person Black Scythe?"

"No, Black Scythe is on the island. This means..."

A devilish smile crept onto Gabriel's lips.

"It means it's the perfect situation for taking a hostage."

Saying so, Gabriel reached out to Ryuwon.

"Hey!?"

Ryuwon's floating body was suspended in the air.

"Rather than just taking you, it's better to cut off an arm as a warning."

"Ah, ah."

Whether Ryuwon trembled in fear or not, Gabriel swung the golden chain he held.

Shrrrk-!

The chain coiled around one arm like a snake, glowing bright red.

Sccccreech-

"Uh, aaaaah!"

The sound of burning and screams amused the angels as if it were entertaining.

But the amusement didn't last long.

"What's this? The arm didn't get severed?" "Strange."

Even though it was a situation where losing an arm wouldn't be a problem, the human was somehow enduring.

"Upon closer inspection, there aren't even any wounds."

Despite screaming, only his clothes had burned, leaving no injuries on his skin.

"Uh, aaaah... What?"

It was only then that Ryuwon realized he felt no pain at all.

"What have you done, human? How did you resist the Judgment Chains?" "...."

"I know you understand me. Speak quickly."

"Well, uh...."

He couldn't answer. He didn't even know what had happened.

"It won't work. I might have to tear your arm off myself...."

That's when it happened.

Kwaaaaang-!

Gabriel was thrown against the wall and crashed into the living room.

As the chain loosened, Ryuwon, who had been hanging in mid-air, fell to the floor.
ChatGPT

"Ugh..."

Ryuwon, rising with pain in his buttocks, suddenly fell silent.

Someone wearing a mask stood there, guarding him.
