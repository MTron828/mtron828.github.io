[결투 시작]

두 사람은 서로 마주보며 결투의 시작을 알린다. 존 델가도는 조건에 따라 모든 장비와 스킬을 사용하지 않고, 한 걸음도 움직이지 않기로 했다. 그리고 선공을 무작위로 양보하며 무기를 가지고 털끝이라도 건드리기만 하면 승리할 수 있다.

반면 상대인 류민은 어떠한 페널티도 없다. 그는 웃음을 참으며 존의 선택을 알아차렸다. 무언가를 알고 웃는 듯한 그의 표정은 이 결투에 대한 자신감으로 가득 차 있었다.

좌중에선 이 광경을 지켜보며 호기심어린 시선이 고개를 내밀었다. 그들도 누가 이 결투에서 승리할지 예측하기 어려웠다. 누가 먼저 움직이면 패배하는 규칙 속에서의 대결은 예측 불가능한 결과를 가져올 것이 분명했다.

[5, 4, 3, 2, 1...]

경고음과 함께 결투가 시작된다. 두 사람은 정적인 상태로 서로를 바라보며 예민한 상황을 맞이한다. 주변은 긴장감으로 가득찼고, 류민의 웃음 속에는 어떤 비밀스러운 계획이 숨어있는 것처럼 보인다.

Furthermore, by imposing penalties, the balance has been appropriately adjusted.

Although it seems disadvantageous, it was only designed to appear promising.

"Even though the situation involves no skill usage, no movement, and even conceding the initiative..."

Ryumin had no worries.

Confident that with the runes of inner thoughts and foresight, he could see through any move, regardless of the choice.

"Concede the initiative. Come."

"No need to say..."

Fwoosh—

"Got it, you bastard!"

A ghostly figure materialized at the tip of John Delgado's staff.

An ethereal undead, Sariel, who only takes damage from magical attacks, with nothing left but a skull.

"Kill that bastard!"

At the owner's command, Sariel rushed forward and, in the blink of an eye, was right in front of John.

So fast that it seemed like teleportation.

Soon, Sariel's skeletal form drew a line as the weapon it once wielded in its past life gleamed.

Having conceded the initiative as agreed, Ryumin simply moved his upper body to easily dodge. Then, with just one word:

"Discharge."

Zap— A lightning bolt shot through Sariel's torso, piercing through not only its body but also the household ceiling.

"What, what the!?"

The exit of the Archangel summon was truly anticlimactic, but John Delgado was not surprised by that.

"I said skills were prohibited!"

"This isn't a skill; it's a rune effect."

"You damn cheat!"

Realizing he had been deceived, John Delgado calmly pulled out his next move.

Woo-woo-woo—

Five ethereal undead were generated from the tip of the staff, dispersing in all directions and simultaneously attacking Ryumin.

However, nothing changed.

"Area Discharge."

With a single ability, the surroundings were completely cleared.

But John was prepared for this and immediately summoned five more.

"No need to unleash all my power at once. After all, it's cleared in one shot."

John's strategy was simple.

Divide the forces and attack.

"I'm sure that damn ability has a cooldown."

Even if he attacks with five at a time, the cooldown should prevent him from doing it continuously.

A smile crept onto John's face.

This was the plan prepared for such a situation, and it was undoubtedly a strategy with a high chance of success.

If Ryumin didn't have the Dark Rune.

"Disperse."

Rising dark orbs transformed into dozens of blades, spreading in all directions.

Swish, swish, swish, swish, swish—!

Perhaps due to the mixed magical damage, the ethereal undead were hit by the blades and vanished.

Not a single one left.

Among them was John Delgado as well.

"Ugh..."

John, with dark blades embedded in his forehead, dropped to his knees.

[The duel has ended. The victory goes to 'Black Scythe.'] [As the opponent has been defeated, you are now a slave to 'Black Scythe,' to serve and obey for the rest of your life.]

The duel was over.

A smile crept onto Ryumin's lips.

'Went according to plan.'

Just like Joo Sung-tak, he turned John into a slave through a duel.

As the wounds on John's forehead disappeared, he, still kneeling, raised his head.

"I greet my master."

"Oh well. John. I have something else to test with you."

"Please give me your orders."

Even though Sariel was killed just now, it was a duel, so who knows.

"Summon an angel."

"The cooldown has 5 minutes remaining. Shall I wait a bit?"

"Yeah, do that."

Five minutes later, John once again summoned ethereal undead.

Without self-awareness, Sariel couldn't recognize Ryumin.

'What if killing a summon earns me stacks? Let's test that. Discharge.'

Zap!

Immediately firing a lightning bolt, Ryumin obliterated Sariel.

But there was no new message, and the demon rune count remained unchanged.

[Angels defeated: 1/100]

'Killing Sariel didn't count except for the first time.'

In other words, killing summoned angels doesn't contribute to building demon rune stacks.

'Well, if killing summons could gain benefits, there would be chaos worldwide.'

If that were the case, players worldwide wouldn't just stand by quietly.

'Maybe all summoners cooperatively raise their levels in reality.'

He knew that killing summons or any other creatures wouldn't yield experience points or gold.

If they did, players worldwide would be actively participating.

'Probably every summoner is desperately leveling up in this dire situation.'

Knowing that killing summons wouldn't bring any gains, he tested it just in case.

'It shows how desperate my situation is.'
