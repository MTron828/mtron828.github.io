Title: Episode 248 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

The Second Mission

Whaahk-

The once dark space suddenly brightened.

The place where people stood was a large square capable of accommodating two thousand people.

"Ah, it's finally visible now."

"Now the skills work properly."

"By the way, what could the second mission be?"

"Maybe the Black Scythe? Judging by the way they're talking, it seems like they know the strategy."

"Why don't you ask?"

"Nah, I don't want to. I'm not particularly curious. If you're curious, you ask."

"Well, I'm not really curious either."

They said so, but people sneaked glances at Ryu Min from the corner of their eyes.

They were curious if he knew about the second mission.

But they couldn't bring themselves to ask.

Because of Ryu Min's frozen expression and the unusual atmosphere.

"Why does he look so gloomy?"

"What's wrong with him?"

"Is the second mission difficult?"

People murmured, but it wasn't just Ryu Min who was stiffened.

Even the disciples of the Cult of Reapers were anxiously awaiting the next mission with worried expressions.

Ryu Min already knew.

That this mission meant killing each other.

After a while, the message everyone had been waiting for appeared.

[We will now begin the second mission.]

└ Kill each other from now on.

└ If anyone is killed within the 30-minute time limit, they pass.

[The number of participants who passed is 1,152, which is half of the participants.] [Participants who do not pass within the time limit will all be eliminated.] [Success allows you to challenge the third mission.] [Current number of survivors: 2,303] [Time remaining until the next mission: 00:29:59]

The eyes of those who saw the mission widened.

"Kill each other?"

"Like in the 4th round?"

Unpleasant memories flashed in the minds of the people.

The fourth round of death where they had to kill and be killed to survive.

Gulp-

Swallowing saliva, they looked at the person next to them.

Already, someone with a gleam of life in their eyes could be seen.

With wary eyes, they cautiously distanced themselves from each other.

'Kill each other for 30 minutes...'.
ChatGPT

"The Black Scythe's expression is now understood why it's so stern."

Honestly, unless someone is a crazy psychopathic killer, who would want to kill another person?

What's the benefit of taking someone's life?

But now, there was a clear benefit.

The right to survive.

By taking someone else's life, one could gain the right to survive.

However, no one immediately acted on it.

No matter what, wielding a knife against someone else was an intimidating prospect.

"Now, they want us to kill each other..."

"What kind of messed-up mission is this?"

A comrade who had endured for 14 months became an enemy in an instant.

While some hesitated due to ethical or moral reasons.

"Close your eyes and kill."

"It's unavoidable for survival, isn't it?"

"After all, it's a world where you climb up by stepping on others. This is also a kind of competition."

There were also those who rationalized that they had to kill.

In the midst of this surreal situation, while people were just watching each other, the disciples of the Cult of Reapers drew closer to each other.

It was because of the orders from the Black Scythe mentioned earlier.

"The second mission is a mission to kill each other. You may not know, but a gruesome slaughter like the fourth round will likely happen. However, don't get swept up in the atmosphere and don't participate in the killing. Don't even aim a knife at each other. Just gather as fellow members of the Cult of Reapers and watch the situation. If someone attacks first, it's okay to kill. But until then, observe the situation with me. Do not step forward under any circumstances until I give the signal."

Even if a slaughter occurs, do not step forward.

It's okay to kill if someone attacks first.

Trust and protect each other as comrades.

Stay still until I give the signal.

To adhere to the four instructions from the Black Scythe, the disciples trusted each other and gathered.

As they didn't know what situation would unfold, the Black Scythe's order to wait and see first was reasonable.

There was also trust in the Black Scythe.

On the contrary, for those outside the Cult of Reapers, it was a dire situation.

"Are we all just going to watch like this? Shouldn't we do something?"

In response to someone's outcry, a heated outcry burst out.

"What are you suggesting? We kill each other?"

"If we don't kill, everyone will be eliminated. We have no choice but to kill."
ChatGPT

"If each person kills just one, we'll pass through perfectly."

"A math genius here."

"Don't mock. Do you have any better ideas?"

"Me? I don't have any thoughts."

"Hey, how about having a tournament instead?"

"A tournament? You must be kidding."

"Hey, don't talk like that. How about we organize a tournament?"

"Tournament? Are you out of your mind?"

"Well, you shouldn't talk too harshly just because it's the underworld, right?"

"We need to make reasonable sense. But who will decide the matchups? Who will face the Black Scythe?"

"If a foolish guy suggests having a tournament, then it'll work."

"Oh, sorry. I was too shortsighted. I was stupid. Then, could you smart people suggest something else?"

"Black Scythe knows, right? Since he knew the strategy for the first mission."

"Black Scythe? Do you also know the strategy for this mission?"

"If you know, please tell us."

The eyes of the audience were on Ryu Min, but he had no specific answer.

There was no other way except killing.

After remaining silent for a while, Ryu Min casually spoke.

"We have to kill. Is there any other choice?"

"...."

The players inwardly sighed, realizing that it wasn't the answer they hoped for.

The more they thought, the more there was only one answer.

'Is there really no other way but to kill?'

According to the system, they had no choice but to kill each other.

It took 10 minutes for them to realize this.

"We're running out of time. It's already been 10 minutes."

"If we continue like this, everyone will be eliminated. Shouldn't at least half survive?"

"Then you go ahead and kill first!"

"W-Well, that's a bit..."

A deadlock ensued.

Despite experiencing murder in the fourth round, people couldn't easily stab each other now.

Ironically, those who hesitated had experienced that hell and were reluctant to do it again.

In a way, they had survived for over a year not just as competitors but as comrades.

'Everyone seems to hesitate after all.'

Ryu Min had already expected this confrontation.

It was the same in the fourth round.

'Need to change the situation.'

They had to kill each other.

To achieve that, Ryu Min decided to use the Desperation Doctrine.

Ryu Min's gaze reached John Delgado, who was in the distance.

"Execute it."
ChatGPT

Giving a nod, John Delgado slightly lowered his head. And not long after,

Swoosh!

"Aaaargh!"

A chilling sound of flesh being pierced was heard.

Swish!

The attention of those around gathered towards a man who had collapsed to the ground.

The first victim had occurred.

None other than a follower of the Desperation Doctrine.

And the person who killed him, as well.

"I-It's murder!"

"Look at him! His nickname turned red!"

"What are fellow followers doing attacking each other?"

Nearby Desperation Doctrine followers were bewildered.

The situation where one follower killed another was absurd to them, but they didn't know.

That behind it all was their leader, John Delgado.

Ryu Min, who was at a distance, twisted his lips while observing the murder scene.

'The followers seem to listen to the words of the sorcerer better than expected.'

Beforehand, John Delgado had separately met with the followers and made a proposal.

Kill one follower nearby when he gives the signal.

In return, he promised not only the strategy for the next round but also the position of an Elder.

'Was it really worth going along with such a scheme?'

What was amusing was that not just one or two but many followers accepted that proposal.

Thud! Swoosh!

"Argh!"

"Ack!"

Desperation Doctrine followers swung their daggers towards their comrades.

They unhesitatingly killed followers, solely believing in the leader's proposal.

"Hahaha, aaargh!"

A follower who laughed while killing a fellow follower was stabbed by another follower's blade and died.

That follower, in turn, was turned into a corpse by yet another follower.

In this way, a bloody massacre was unfolding among the Desperation Doctrine followers.

All were fanatics who fell for John Delgado's promise.

Thud! Thud!

"Aaaah!"

"Kill them!"

As the followers suddenly started killing each other, Berber could only be astonished.

"Why are you doing this? Why suddenly!?"

Because he couldn't imagine there was a hidden plot.

"Hey, you crazy bastards! What do you think you're doing attacking your own side!?"

To him, the Desperation Doctrine followers were valuable resources and troops, meant to become the next leader.

It was a waste for them to die like this.

But no matter how much he tried to stop them, they showed no mercy in wielding their blades.

Why were they suddenly fighting like this?
ChatGPT

The idea of killing John Delgado and expanding his influence seemed absurd to him. However, the murders were not limited to just the followers of the Desperation Doctrine.

"Kill him!"

"You son of a b****, come here!"

"Die! Die!"

As if a dam had burst, people mercilessly attacked each other with their knives.

Seeing the Desperation Doctrine followers fighting, others quickly decided to join in.

In the midst of this chaos, there were those who rationalized their participation as inevitable for survival.

'Hmm.'

Amidst the confusion, Ryu Min silently observed the situation.

The followers of the Cult of Reapers also refrained from getting involved in the killings and observed the situation.

They followed Ryu Min's instruction not to act recklessly until there were specific orders.

Ryu Min looked at the quest progress window and waited for the right moment.

[Current Survivors: 2,102] [Current Passers: 201/1,152]

[Current Survivors: 2,050] [Current Passers: 253/1,152]

[Current Survivors: 1,991] [Current Passers: 312/1,152]

As the number of survivors decreased and the number of passers increased, Ryu Min patiently waited.

'It's not time yet. A little more killing is needed.'

While Ryu Min remained composed, the Cult of Reapers followers became anxious as the number of passers increased rapidly.

They wondered if they should join the killings quickly, fearing that they might miss out on the opportunity.

But the followers trusted the Black Scythe.

They eagerly waited for his command, and finally...

'The time has come.'

When the number of passers exceeded 400, Ryu Min gestured with his eyes, giving the command.

To John Delgado.

'Summon them.'

John, who happened to be looking in their direction, nodded and began casting the resurrection skill on the corpses.

"Rise."

The light emanating from the end of his staff moved towards the lifeless bodies scattered around.

Gradually.

"Grrrrrr...."

Hundreds of corpses rose like zombies.

Even those who were fighting without thinking paused their attacks, surprised by the spectacle.

Thunk thunk thunk—

The undead, moving in formation like an army, headed towards a particular direction.

"What, what are those?"

"They're coming this way?"

It was none other than a horde of Cult of Reapers members.

The gathered army of undead aimed at the Cult of Reapers, ready to launch an attack.
ChatGPT

"In truth, I came here to sacrifice my life."

Contrary to appearances, the undead had no intention of attacking the Cult of Reapers. They had simply come to die.

"It's less of a guilty conscience to kill already dead corpses than to kill living people."

Ryu Min's strategy was to target the real undead to count the numbers.

Thunk thunk—

As John Delgado's summoned creatures approached, Ryu Min shouted as if signaling the perfect moment.

"All members of the Cult of Reapers! Kill those undead! One for each person!"

Executing the command was not difficult since they were not real people but summoned entities.

Thud! Thud!

Moreover, they offered no resistance.

"Why aren't they resisting?"

While it was puzzling, the Cult of Reapers followers soon opened their eyes in surprise.

"Huh? What is this message...?"

"We killed the undead, and this pops up?"

When Ryu Min killed one of the nearby undead, he could see the same message as the followers:

"You have committed murder. You have passed the second mission."
