Episode 113 of the 100th Rebirth of the Max-Level Player

Level 60
As players began pointing their swords at each other, as expected.

"It's about time to make a move."

As if waiting for this moment, Ryumin evaded his position.

After that, he used invisibility and changed his appearance without anyone noticing.

Into the appearance of Lost Yak.

"If I help the dwarves in the form of the Black Scythe, it will be revealed that the betrayers have betrayed."

Remaining invisible, Ryumin observed the situation.

He was waiting.

For the moment when the betrayers attacked the dwarves.

"When the identification process begins, they'll start feeling anxious. Then, fearing exposure, the betrayers will try to kill the dwarves first."

Even if others didn't know, identifying the dwarves' leader was quite easy due to the small number of participants.

As someone who had experienced the past, Ryumin was aware of such events in advance.

"Usually, they suggest identifying around the 4th to 6th wave, but this time it's a bit late."

It didn't matter much since the variables were within an acceptable range. For Ryumin, hiding transparently and waiting like this was sufficient.

Waiting for the prey to take the bait.

"Finally, they are moving."

Betrayers' movements were captured in Ryumin's eyes.

Having known the betrayers' faces beforehand and being able to read their thoughts made it easy to see through them.

"They are aiming for the leader of the dwarves, Haimer."

Four betrayers were targeting Haimer.

Ryumin took out the prepared Hwandudaedo.

Naturally, he didn't draw the scythe to avoid revealing his identity.

Although not as skilled as when using the main weapon, it was sufficient against four individuals who were not even level 30.

The sound of their movements echoed.

The betrayers moved.

Remaining invisible beside Haimer, who was unaware, Ryumin didn't reveal himself.

"Not yet. I have to intervene at the most dramatic timing. That way, I can maximize Haimer's favorability."

The betrayers rushed towards Haimer simultaneously.

"What's happening, warriors of another world? Why is this suddenly happening?"

Haimer was still shouting, unaware that he had become the target.

Eventually, he realized that there was a blade targeting him belatedly, but by then, it was already too late.

No, it was the moment when he thought it was too late.

Swish!

As Ryumin swung his sword, the invisibility was lifted.

"Are you okay?"

"Uh, uh, you are..."

"Hide behind me. These guys are targeting Lord Hymer."

After delivering the appropriate lines to Hymer, Ryumin glanced around.

Two in front, two in the back.

Four betrayers surrounded Ryumin and Hymer.

They exuded a somewhat convincing aura.

"What the heck is this guy? Where did he come from?"

"Don't interfere, just get lost. If you don't want to die."

If the face of the Black Scythe had been visible, the puppies would have whimpered at Ryumin.

"No, there's no time, so just die too."

"You brought this upon yourself by trying to save the dwarf. Don't resent us."

In the blink of an eye, all four rushed simultaneously.

If it weren't for four blades, it would have been an unstoppable angle.

However.

Swish, swish, swish, swish—

Ryumin, who had deflected all the sword blades, stabbed the chest of one betrayer.

Thud—

"Ugh!"

"I warned you."

After pulling out his Hwandudaedo, Ryumin immediately parried the sword of the guy behind him and sliced through his shoulder.

Squelch—

"Argh!"

"I don't show mercy to those who point a sword at me seriously."

In an instant, the two remaining betrayers were startled.

But what was even more bewildering was the sight of one's own body that suddenly appeared.

Moreover, with the neck severed, the body staggered and fell.

Thunk, thunk—

It wasn't until the two heads fell to the ground that Ryumin finished speaking.

"You brought this upon yourselves. Don't resent us."

No answer came from the already dead.

The nearby players who witnessed Ryumin's skills marveled.

"Wow, what's going on? Who is that person?"

"He's no joke."

Since it was the face of Lost Yak, no one could have guessed it was the Black Scythe.

He was even wearing different armor on top of the sword.

"Amazing, isn't it? Saving a dwarf like that."

"Why didn't we notice such a skilled person?"

"Oh? Now that you mention it, it seems so."

The sense of wonder quickly turned into acceptance.

With over 200 participants, it was not surprising that someone new could go unnoticed.

Amidst all this, as I lowered my head, I saw that the Dwarf, Hymer, was still trying to calm his surprised heart.

Seemingly, he hadn't considered the possibility of being attacked by his own guards, who were not even monsters.

"W-What's going on?"

"There is a traitor among our team."

"A t-traitor?"

"The scene we just witnessed attacking each other was an attempt to expose the traitor."

Understanding seemed to dawn on Hymer now as he nodded, sweeping his beard.

"To think there was a traitor among the warriors from another world. This could have been a big problem."

"Lord Hymer! We must protest to the temple immediately!"

"Yes! Those we were supposed to guard have turned into enemies!"

"Going on like this to our destination...!"

"Gahmaaan!!!"

Dwarves who were protesting against Hymer's outburst simultaneously fell silent.

The voices were so loud that even players who had been observing each other stopped what they were doing to look around.

"Why argue about that now? Isn't the most confusing thing at the moment that the traitor is hiding among us, not the warriors from another world?"

"...."

"...."

Hymer looked up at Ryumin.

"Thanks to you, I have saved this wretched life. Please let me know your name, my benefactor."

Hymer awaited an answer with eyes that sparkled incongruently with his appearance.

As Ryumin, who had to conceal his identity, he couldn't outright say he was the Black Scythe, especially with so much attention around.

"Moreover, it's even harder to benefit from the dwarves if I reveal a false nickname in this situation."

A perplexing situation.

"But it's not like there's no solution."

While others were still unaware, there was a system for such moments.

Titles.

Ryumin selected one of the various titles he had acquired and pressed 'Release Concealment.'

[Ahead Leader]

Above his head, instead of a nickname, the title appeared.

Although nicknames could be hidden, titles could not.

Players stared wide-eyed at this sight.

"What's that? Why is that person's nickname not visible?"

"Why don't we have it?"

Players who didn't know about titles assumed it was a nickname and raised questions.

"Well, since I've never obtained one, I wouldn't know."

As it was more challenging to acquire titles than runes, Ryumin understood the reactions around him.

At that moment, Hymer showed a surprised expression.

"Huh? You, are you the 'Ahead Leader'?"

It seemed that even he could see the revealed title.

"But for those from another world, it means something different."

To players, it was simply a replacement for a nickname.

"But for these guys, it seems to have some meaning."

As if there was an internally predetermined story, revealing a title would elicit a reaction.

"So, you are the 'Ahead Leader.'"

"Oh, that makes sense!"

"Ahead Leader. Your reputation precedes you."

As Ryumin had nothing to lose by revealing the title, he played along.

"Is that so? I don't think I'm that famous."

"Haha, the Ahead Leader is humble."

Hymer burst into laughter and then conveyed gratitude with a serious expression.

"Thank you for saving me, Ahead Leader. If it weren't for you, I would have ended up as a crushed beetle on the cobblestone."

Watching Hymer shiver, Ryumin asked cautiously.

"Do I need to tell you my name?"

"What meaning does a name have? The reputation of the Ahead Leader is already well-known."

Ryumin nodded in agreement.

"Indeed, titles can be a substitute for nicknames."

Now, even if he met a different dwarf rather than Hymer, revealing this title would likely earn the dwarf's favor.

As if to prove this, a message appeared right on cue.

"The dwarf's opinion of the 'Ahead Leader' has increased from 'Neutral' to 'Friendly.'"

He had successfully garnered the dwarf's favor as he intended.

"This is the functional role of titles."

While Ryumin was smiling at the message, the task of exposing the betrayers continued.

However.

"Grrr— Grrr!"

"Grrrr!"

The sudden attack of orcs interrupted the betrayer identification process.

This time, Ryumin, in the appearance of Lost Yak rather than the Black Scythe, protected the dwarves from the orcs.

It was an action taken to further solidify the goodwill.

Sure enough:

Having an "Ahead Leader" really makes me feel secure.
Your skills are outstanding compared to other warriors.
If you use the weapon I made, it would truly be an honor.

The dwarves who watched Ryumin's prowess silently admired him.

Ryumin sighed at the slightly slower hunting speed than usual.

"But the dwarves are watching, and I can't release the transformation. I guess I have to hunt with the Hwandudaedo for this wave."

Although the hunting speed was a bit disappointing compared to usual, there wasn't a significant difference.

If it had been the scythe, he could have killed four in one stroke, but using the Hwandudaedo required stabbing four times, which was a bit cumbersome.

"But if I can build goodwill with the dwarves and get rewards, it's worth it."

He might receive the rewards he aimed for once the escort was over, but just in case, he decided to build up his reputation.

There was no harm in making sure.

At that moment, a welcome message appeared before Ryumin's eyes as he fought the orcs.

[Level Up!] [Your rank has risen from 'Expert' to 'Master.'] [You can now use the Duel Request feature.]

Reaching level 60, Ryumin's rank had ascended to Master. With this, the Duel Request feature became available, a useful function in many ways.

"You can wager each other's items and fight, or make promises and fight," he thought.

In simpler terms, it allowed one-on-one duels where participants put something at stake, commonly used in reality rather than in otherworldly situations.

[As a promotion bonus, the Death Mark skill is strengthened!] [Additional damage of the Death Mark skill is increased from 140% to 160%.] [As a promotion bonus, the Night of Death skill is strengthened!] [The range of the Night of Death skill is increased from 1,000m to 1,500m.] [As a promotion bonus, the Moonlight Island skill is strengthened!] [The range damage of the Moonlight Island skill is increased from 1,200% to 1,800%.]

Existing skills were sequentially enhanced.

While it was a welcome occurrence, Ryumin's attention was drawn more to a new skill than the upgrades.
