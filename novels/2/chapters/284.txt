Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 284"

Episode 284: Encounter with the Demon Grand Duke

Upon Ryu Min's acceptance, Michael's expression blossomed like a flower in full bloom.

[Thanks! It's not easy to casually accept a request that could be burdensome.]

"Just taking a moment to see the face of the Demon Grand Duke, what's so difficult about that? Besides, aren't we comrades who sailed on the same ship? It's not that difficult to ask for your support until Round 20."

[Thanks for thinking that way! Indeed, you're different from other humans, awake and aware!]

Despite Michael's laughter and his supportive attitude, his true feelings were different.

Hmph, like a less shaken insect. Falling into a trap so easily, you won't be able to escape once you step into the Demon Castle.

Though Michael pretended to laugh and support Ryu Min, the latter, who could read thoughts, couldn't be unaware of the truth.

'You're the foolish one, Michael. Do you think I would meet the Demon Grand Duke without any plan?'

Ryu Min sneered inwardly, but in Michael's eyes, it just seemed like a gullible person smiling.

[Shall we go now? This seems like a good timing with the gods watching.]

"Sure, lead the way."

Michael nodded and soared into the sky.

Ryu Min, too, spread his black wings and followed behind.

Whooooosh-

Amidst their flight, the sound of war horns announcing the beginning of the war reached them.

Along with it, the shouts of both sides shook the heavens and the earth.

[Whoaaa!] [Let's kill them! Dirty demon bastards!] [Dog-like angel bastards!]

5,000 angels clashed with 10,000 demons on the ground.

Watching the scene from above, it couldn't be anything other than a spectacle.

At that moment, players could be seen among the angels, cutting down demons amid the chaos.

'Our missionary disciples are desperate.'

Given that one's fate is determined based on contributions, it's inevitable for them to be devoted to achieving results.

Minjuri with buffs, Kristin, Victor, and Russell, even if they stay still, their contributions increase, so there's no need to worry.

'Supporters don't have to worry either. I told them to save their bodies as much as possible.'

Moreover, since I've already explained the appearance and characteristics of the demons that should be cautious, it won't be a chaotic scream in the middle of the war like last time.

[Over there.]

As Michael flew, he pointed beyond the hill with a gesture.

Unlike now, where sulfur flames soared, a shadowy area emerged as if swallowed by darkness.

[That's the Demon Castle.]

No need to say it; it was evident.

There was only one building that looked like a castle.

Thunk-

Ryu Min, who followed Michael down to the ground, turned around.

The sight of angels and demons fighting just moments ago was nowhere to be seen.

It was so quiet that it didn't seem like a war zone at all.

[My guidance ends here. You can walk to the Demon Castle on your own.]

"Can't I just fly?"

[If you want to be hit by blind attacks, you can, but I don't recommend it.]

Apparently, unidentified intruders are attacked without question.

"Let's walk, then."

[A brilliant choice. Well then, until we meet again.]

If I can get out. Kick.

Although Ryu Min heard the hidden thoughts, he didn't show it and just nodded.

Anyway, he would meet Michael again shortly.

Flutter-

Michael, who soared into the sky, returned to the battlefield without any lingering regrets.

'He probably thinks he won't see me anymore. Once he enters the Demon Castle, it's impossible to escape.'

But Ryu Min had no intention of willingly falling into a trap.

Nor did he plan to offer his soul to the demons.

'For now, should I go see the face of the Demon Grand Duke?'

As he walked through the barren land toward the majestic castle gate, the sound of a dog barking could be heard somewhere.

Woof! Woof!

A three-headed Cerberus growled behind the iron bars.

Beside it, demons with tridents stood guard as if they were ready to open the iron bars at any moment.

It seemed they would unleash the beast immediately if they deemed Ryu Min an enemy.

At that moment, the gatekeeper guarding the castle gate approached Ryu Min.

[Are you the Black Scythe?]

"Yes, I am."

Thanks to the translation function, communication with the demons was possible.

More surprising than that was a mere soldier recognizing him.

[Please come this way. We've been waiting for you.]

Contrary to Michael's concerns, it was a straightforward reception, but Ryu Min was not surprised.
ChatGPT

‘My reputation with the demons is an eternal alliance. They wouldn't dare to disrespect me.’

Judging from the reputation, I had already guessed.

As Ryu Min followed the soldier into the castle, a message popped up.

[You have left your position during the round.] [If you do not return to the designated location within 1 hour, your player qualification will be revoked.] [Time remaining until disqualification: 00:59:59]

It was the same message as when he entered the heavenly realm, but Ryu Min wasn't surprised.

He knew it would come to this.

However, a slightly different message appeared compared to the heavenly realm.

[You have entered the territory of the Demon King.] [Without the permission of the Demon Grand Duke, who has inherited the Demon King's authority, you cannot leave the Demon Castle.]

Once again, I couldn't leave without permission.

'Just as Michael read my thoughts.'

By now, it was the time to notice the trap and get angry, but Ryu Min, who already knew, walked silently.

With a face devoid of any worry, he explored the vast hall.

Clack, clack-

The interior felt eerie and desolate, but Ryu Min didn't flinch.

Rather, he walked confidently, even when facing the Demon Grand Duke.

[We have brought the awaited guest, Your Excellency.]

In the blazing throne, there was a giant that seemed to be over 10 meters tall.

The skin was dark, and if it stayed still, one might mistake it for a statue, but the tail moved, confirming it was a living being.

[Well done. You may leave now, Crom.] [Yes.]

As the gatekeeper stepped back, Ryu Min looked up at the Demon Grand Duke as if surprised.

'Judging by how he even memorized the name of a mere gatekeeper, he might not be a tyrant.'

While Ryu Min had killed numerous demons, encountering the Demon Grand Duke was a first, just like with the Archangel in the previous episodes.

'But in this round, there are many developments I'm experiencing for the first time, perhaps due to my own actions. Meeting the Archangel for the first time and now the Demon Grand Duke.'

The Demon Grand Duke's appearance was a bit different from what Ryu Min had expected.

He had thought the Demon Grand Duke would look more demonic, but he seemed to exude a handsome vibe.

If only he were of normal height, many women would have chased after him.

However, despite his appearance, his tone was not refined.

[So, you're the Black Scythe. I've been waiting.]

"You?"

In response to Ryu Min's question, Fluctuos' lips curled up.

[Why? Did you think I would speak politely and show respect like other angels?]

"Aren't your demons in an eternal alliance with me?"

[Speaking of the system's reputation. Believing in such empty words. How trivial.]

Fluctuos let out a cynical chuckle.

[Demons, too, have raised humans. We know what abilities players possess and what they seek.]

Suddenly, Fluctuos' expression distorted wickedly.

[Pathetic human scum. Puppets of the system. Foolish humans who can't live without those numbers. Like amoebas that even their owners can't recognize.]

Fluctuos abruptly shifted from his tirade and regained his composure.

[Sorry for the sudden profanity. But isn't it all true? Your humans lack intelligence.]

"…"

[Of course, I don't fail to understand. Having gained such power through the system, it's not strange to rely on it.]

Sharp fangs were revealed outside Fluctuos' lips as he grinned.

[I appreciate you for killing the Archangels. From our perspective, you might be considered an aristocrat worthy of an eternal alliance. But nothing lasts forever. Although the system is said to be the creation of the gods, one must realize there are beings not bound by it.]

"Do you want to claim you're a god yourself? That's why you don't fall under the influence of reputation, unlike other soldiers?"

Fluctuos raised his eyebrows in surprise.

[Hoho, I thought all humans were fools, but maybe that's not entirely true. Yes, I am a god. At least, here in the Demon Castle.]

"Strictly speaking, you're not a god."

Ryu Min, though mocking, Fluctuos didn't take the bait.

[Dismiss such trivial provocations. Do you think a being as great as me would succumb to such petty tricks?]

"Cut the evasion. Anyway, you're not a god, right?"
ChatGPT

[Though not a god, I am an existence close to divinity. Here in the Demon Castle, I hold a position equivalent to that of a god.]

"So, is that why you're stuck in this desolate castle? Reeking of a widower?"

Even though Fluctuos had said provocations wouldn't work, Ryu Min noticed a subtle twitch of his eyebrows.

[Aren't you afraid of death, lowly human?]

"We're in an alliance, remember?"

[Foolish. What have you learned so far? Relying so confidently on just one reputation?]

"I get it. Here, you're like a god, and the influence of the system doesn't reach you. That's why reputation means nothing, and you could trample me to death right now."

[You understand, yet how can you be so confident?]

"Because you won't kill me."

Fluctuos sent a surprised look once again.

[Why do you think that?]

"Mikael told me. Despite having the authority of the Akashic Records, he demanded to have me until the end."

[That bastard said that too?]

"He said more. That your demons and angels are engaging in this to raise humans as mercenaries."

[Like a hypocritical angel. He doesn't spare any words against humans.]

"You're not in a position to curse others. Here you are, having a conversation with a human like me. If you were going to kill me, you could have stepped on me and killed me immediately. What's there to regret? It's not just a lonely chat you're having for the sake of conversation, is it?"

[What are you trying to say? Do you think I have something I desire from the likes of you? Ridiculous. That's it.]

"You have nothing you want? Then try killing me."

[…….]

Apparently, Fluctuos couldn't bring himself to do it.

"See, you do have something you want. So, without much ado, tell me what you want. I'll listen, and then I'll make my judgment."

[Impressive confidence. Fine. I like it, Black Scythe. Since it has come to this, I'll speak the truth.]

With a serious expression, Fluctuos spoke.

[I want your soul.]

"My soul?"

[For us demons, a human soul is a valuable material. I won't specify what it becomes, but we need a powerful soul like yours.]
ChatGPT

"I have a powerful soul? Isn't it the same for me and everyone else?"

"Nonsense. Human souls are not treated equally. You might not know, but the abilities of players come from the soul, not the physical body. In other words, if a player demonstrates prowess, their soul can also be used as high-quality material. It's like the quality of an item varying depending on the product."

"Treating me like an object doesn't sit well with me."

"Your feelings don't matter. No matter what anyone says, you are my possession."

"Are you openly treating me like an object now?"

"Did I say something wrong? As compensation for killing my avatar, I demanded you from the gods, and I received you before the end of Round 18. It was a legitimate request."

"So, whether you kill me or not and use my soul as material, why bother talking so much?"

"The reason is simple. Unlike what I may seem, I am somewhat divine. Not as barbaric as forcefully adopting a stray dog at home. Well, if you don't listen, I may have to beat some sense into you."

"So, you're politely informing me before killing me and using my soul as material?"

"That's the idea."

Ryu Min found it absurd, but he didn't assume that the other was lying. He believed the statement that divine power was at its peak in the Demon Castle.

'As evidence, my thoughts aren't readable.'

Moreover, the recently acquired Eternal Item 'Eyes of Insight' was penetrating the essence of the opponent.

[Fluctuos]

└ Race: Demon

└ Nature: Evil

└ Position: Demon Grand Duke

└ Notable: The ruler of the demon realm, acting as the de facto leader due to the vacancy of the demonic monarch. Exhibits influence equivalent to divine beings within the Demon Castle.

└ Weakness: …….

'The evil nature is probably from my perspective.'

Most likely.

Even though he explicitly didn't announce that he would kill him for materials, Ryu Min maintained a confident attitude.

"So, what now? Are you going to kill me?"

"...Seeing you still so confident, you truly don't fear death."

"I haven't considered dying yet."
ChatGPT

"You have no choice. What I'm saying is a notification. I will kill you, extract your soul, and use it as a material to cultivate the demon realm. In any case, within the Demon Castle, no one can escape without my permission. Even Michael couldn't enter without it; didn't he run away from the castle's front? So, it's better to accept it willingly. I'm still treating you somewhat divinely."

"There are three points in your statement that I'd like to clarify...."

Ryu Min looked up at Fluctuos and folded his fingers.

"First, Michael didn't bring me here. I came here on my own. Second, I have no intention of running away."

As he folded two fingers, the middle finger pointed at the Demon Grand Duke.

"Third, I have no intention of dying."

"Can't you understand what I'm saying, human? That's your choice...."

"No? I know. That's how you see it. However, what if your perspective changes when you hear what I have to say from now on?"

"What are you trying to say?"

A smile escaped from Ryu Min's lips.

"I'm going to make one proposal to you."
