Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 192"

Bait

"Ugh, it's boring."

A yawn escaped Busan Assassin's Gwon Nam-cheol's mouth.

Since Ryu Min organized the existing Felseba members with Ma Kyung-rok, crimes among players had significantly decreased. With mostly upright players remaining, it was safe to say there were no criminal players.

That was why Gwon Nam-cheol was feeling bored.

"There's hardly any news, but still, this is too dull."

Incidents occurred about once every two weeks. It was a series of quiet days. Working every day like this felt like earning money effortlessly.

"Wouldn't it be nice to see the captain's face one more time?"

Nam-cheol suddenly remembered the first time he encountered the Black Scythe. After losing overwhelmingly in a duel, he corrected his dialect and learned a lot as a squad member.

"I was so pathetic, rushing in like a puppy without a clue."

Thinking about it now, it was worth a chuckle, but it was still a valuable experience.

When else would he have a chance to duel with the Black Scythe if not for that time?

"You're truly amazing. How did you manage to earn 20 million points in the 11th round?"

As a fellow squad member, he felt proud for some reason. They hadn't met lately due to the captain's busy schedule, but it would be nice to see his face again.

"What are you doing for three hours?"

Nam-cheol, yawning and checking the time, was about to close his eyes when suddenly -

Beep beep beep -

A clear alarm sound.

Nam-cheol, wide awake, grabbed the radio.

"Incident reported, incident reported, Code Zero One, Code Zero One, emergency bell for players at GS24 convenience store in Gwangjin-gu, Seoul. Swift response requested. Over."

"Unit 18."

Nam-cheol, who received the incident report, quickly left the temporary Seoul Gwangjin Police Station where he was stationed.

Since the report location was nearby, running was faster than taking a car.

It had been almost two weeks since the last incident, so there was a slight tension.

"Who's the lunatic attempting robbery? If that's the case, they're truly foolish."

Title: "Two Months Since the Establishment of the CPF Unit"

South Korea's public safety was considered stable.

Everyone in South Korea knew about the CPF public service advertisements featuring Seo Ah-rin, as seen on TV. Committing crimes in Korea could lead to inevitable death.

"Committing crimes in a place like this."

Nam-cheol thought that perhaps it was a foreign player or someone who didn't know about CPF.

"Here?"

Nam-cheol, having arrived at the reported location, immediately opened the convenience store door.

Clang-

The scene before his eyes was gruesome.

A man in his 40s, who seemed to be the store owner, was dead with his throat slit.

The sight brought back memories of his first real-life mission, and Nam-cheol's eyes trembled beneath.

"Crazy convenience store robber, if caught, you're dead, remember!"

Following the manual, he used his exploration skills to check for any movement.

Several red dots were visible, but upon closer inspection, they were just ordinary people.

"Could it be this guy?"

There was only one point moving hastily.

After suspecting the individual, Nam-cheol immediately went in pursuit.

Tap-tap-tap-

The distance quickly closed in.

To prepare for such situations, Nam-cheol had purchased shoes from the special store that increased his movement speed.

"Hey! Stop right there!"

Even though Nam-cheol shouted for him to stop upon seeing the suspect, he fled.

Doubt turned into certainty.

"I said stop! Hey, you!"

Nam-cheol, seeing the suspect heading into a dead-end alley, smiled with a sense of satisfaction.

"Caught you, huh?"

As Nam-cheol entered the alley, he stopped walking.

He had chased one person, but there were two people standing in the alley.

In a manner that seemed like they were waiting for him, Nam-cheol felt an ominous vibe.

Turning around at the sound of footsteps, two more figures appeared.

In no time, he found himself surrounded by four people.

"What's going on? Are these guys from another country?"

Judging by their faces and attire, they seemed to be foreign players.

Nam-cheol swallowed his dry spit as he was encircled.

"Who are you guys?"

He asked in Korean, but there was no response.

They just smirked, as if finding the situation amusing.

"Heh, this guy looks scared."

"We were chasing one person, and suddenly it became four. That surprised you, didn't it?"
ChatGPT

"Stop blabbering when we can't communicate. Let's get to work right away."

"Alright. Let's subdue them first. We should use the bait strategy."

As all four raised their weapons simultaneously, Gwon Nam-cheol finally felt the severity of the situation.

"Darn it, this is bad. No wonder I felt a yawn coming today..."

He didn't have confidence in facing four opponents, but wasn't he the Busan Assassin?

"Darn it, come at me. When you go, always bring two or more people."

He activated the buff skills of the Blade Master, enhancing his blade and agility.

A blue light radiated from the long blade, increasing both attack power and attack speed.

With a determined look in his eyes, he raised the sword, causing the approaching individuals to hesitate with surprised expressions.

"This guy, looks like a pushover just by looking at his eyes."

"Don't be scared. There are four of us."

"Who said I'm scared? As the top ranker in the Brazil region, do you think I'm afraid of a punk like this?"

"Then come at me first."

"Heh, watch closely. I'll knock him down in a minute."

The Brazilian ranker, [Bricks], quickly closed the distance.

Surprised by the speed, Nam-cheol swung his sword, but...

Crash!

His steel fist, a skill of the Monk class, effortlessly blocked the attack.

From that point on,

Crash, Bang, Crash...

Several exchanges occurred, but all of Nam-cheol's strikes were blocked by Bricks' iron fist.

"Do you think you can defeat me with that flimsy blade? Heh."

Once he clenched his fist, the Monk's skill, Iron Fist, was a counter to all melee jobs.

"Darn it, why does it sound like metal hitting metal?"

Puzzled, Nam-cheol decided he needed to make use of the reach of his sword.

But due to the gum-like adherence of the foreign players, the distance didn't open up.

"Huh?"

Bricks suddenly pressed his palm against his abdomen.

"Explosion!"

Boom!

"Ugh!"

With a massive explosion, Nam-cheol was thrown back.

Flying 10 meters, he hit the wall before falling to the ground.

"Ugh..."

Even wearing armor, the internal organs felt shaken, and the impact didn't dissipate.

"What's this? Not even X? Didn't even take a minute."

Bricks arrogantly sneered.
ChatGPT

"Don't hold back, just watch. I'll take care of that guy."

"Can't I enjoy a bit as well? I want to have some fun too."

"Asura, if you end up dying, what can we do?"

"Alright. Let's just leave it to Bricks."

The three bumped fists while bantering, expressing their complete disinterest. Nam-cheol also noticed that.

"These guys..."

Though he felt hot at being ignored, the reality was that he couldn't even compete with that iron fist.

"Why am I dealing with these guys..."

While they were ranked as the top 12 in their respective countries, Nam-cheol was unaware of that fact.

"Die... X deity."

"What did you say? Damn it."

In an instant, Nam-cheol disappeared.

Bricks was surprised, but he hadn't truly vanished. He had simply approached quickly.

He was momentarily startled by the unexpected speed but soon grinned.

Since there was no issue blocking with his iron fist, he checked the trajectory of the blade and accurately brought down his fist.

Crash- It should have made the normal sound, but surprisingly, a different sound echoed.

Squelch!

"Huh?"

The blade quickly altered its path and sliced through Bricks' wrist.

While his iron fist could block anything when clenched, a fist was still just a fist. The wrist was vulnerable.

"Ugh, ugh!"

Seeing his severed wrist, a mocking laughter erupted from behind.

"Bricks, I knew it would turn out like that."

"Why did you insist on going alone?"

"The second-ranked player in Brazil is going to cry unjustly."

He had allowed it once, but not twice.

Crash, Crash.

Bricks, who had blocked the blade with a single punch, once again extended his palm.

"Feng!"

Phooom!

"Cough!"

Hit by the wind like a cannon, Nam-cheol was slammed into the wall once again.

"Bricks, should we lend a hand?"

"Shut up! I'll be the one to kill that bastard."

"Hey, you can't kill him. Remember? We need to lure the Black Scythe using him, right?"

"It's not like he's the only bait! Other teams will rescue the bait!"

"Don't you know that we have to at least see if he can be used as bait or not?"
ChatGPT

Bricks calmed down a bit at the sensible words.

"Fine. Let's try to have a conversation."

With his wrist treated for bleeding, Bricks approached Gwon Nam-cheol.

"Hey, are you close with your squad leader?"

"What?"

"Your leader, Boss, Dark Scythe."

Even though Gwon Nam-cheol was not proficient in English, he understood the words "Boss" and "Dark Scythe."

"Are you talking about our squad leader?"

"What are you saying? Can't this guy understand?"

"It seems like he can?"

"Hey, phone number. Do you know your boss's phone number? Call here. Call to this place."

Nam-cheol's expression changed dramatically as he understood Bricks' words.

"What the hell."

"What did you say?"

"I said, fuck you, you son of a bitch."

"Fuck? Wow, this is ridiculous. Hey guys, what should we do with this guy?"

It was at that moment that Bricks turned his head to his comrades.

"Watch out!"

Nam-cheol's blade thrust towards Bricks' throat.

However, intentionally leaving an opening, Bricks had already twisted his upper body, moving to the side of Nam-cheol.

"Do I look like an X god to you?"

His iron fist struck Nam-cheol's side.

Crack-

"Kwahh!"

As his ribs broke, Nam-cheol groaned in pain and fell over.

Thunk-

"Aaargh!"

Stepping on his wrist, the knife fell from Nam-cheol's hand.

"See? Looking at this guy thrashing around, he doesn't seem willing to give us the number, right?"

"Seems like it."

"Okay? Can I play with this guy now?"

"Do as you please. Just don't drag it out for too long. We're short on time."

"Alright."

A devilish smile appeared on Bricks' face as he looked down at Nam-cheol.

"You picked the wrong fight. How dare this son of a bitch bring my hand to this state? Grind his entire body's bones to pulp, and let him die painfully until the end."

"Ugh..."

As Bricks' enraged fist was about to strike,

"Hey, there are four guys to use as corpses?"

A man in a robe walked into the alley.

It was Joo Sung-taek, who appeared on the instructions of the Black Scythe.

"What's this? Those guys."

Bricks glared at him sharply, but it was a mistake.
ChatGPT

Giving Joo Sung-taek an opportunity to curse in fear.

"Ahh..."

While Bricks was shivering as if suddenly seeing a ghost, his comrades looked at him strangely.

Swiftly approaching, Joo Sung-taek thrust a dagger into Bricks' neck.

Thud!

After easily killing Bricks, he tossed the corpse towards where the others were gathered.

"Corpse Explosion."

Boom, boom, bang!

The three unsuspecting disciples were bounced away like springs.

Enhanced corpse explosion using the soul storage skill was quite powerful.

"Ughhh..."

"Uckkk..."

"Ughh..."

The 12 disciples, whose lower bodies were instantly blown away, groaned in agony before succumbing to death.

"Tsk, those who can't even defeat me dared to target someone else."

After spitting on the corpses, Joo Sung-taek stored only the souls of the killed individuals and returned to Gwon Nam-cheol.

"Are you okay?"

Though his stomach was aching, and his ribs and wrist were shattered, Gwon Nam-cheol could quickly get up.

"T-Thank you for helping. But how did you come here?"

"I just happened to pass by and heard some noise."

He didn't bring up the topic of the Black Scythe as per his master's instructions.

In fact, it was thanks to the order to monitor the members that he was able to appear at just the right moment.

"Well then, I'll be going."

"Uh, wait a moment!"

Leaving Gwon Nam-cheol behind, Joo Sung-taek exited the alley and immediately made a call to someone.

"Master. As you expected, there were people approaching our members."

-Really? How many were there?

"There were four of them, but there was no one mentioned as a sorcerer."

-They're divided into three teams and moving. How did you handle it?

"I killed them all."

-Well done. Keep an eye on the other members. If you come across a sorcerer, don't kill them.

"I will follow your orders."

After ending the call with Joo Sung-taek, Ryu Min put on his coat.

"They move faster than I thought."

It was a good decision to have the members monitored in advance.

"Now that it's come to this, I need to act too."

The 12 disciples would probably target the members simultaneously.

As bait to call for their squad leader.

"Let's move."

Although he could appear at the right time thanks to Joo Sung-taek's intervention, he thought about how he could have gotten there sooner.
ChatGPT

Someone might have already died.

Someone might have betrayed them.

Sure enough.

Drrroonng- drrroonng-

A call came from one of the squad members.

"Hello?"

-Captain? Uh, I have something to discuss. Can you come over here?

"Oh? Where?"

Ryu Min chuckled dryly after hearing the location.

'Betrayal is still present in this round.'

His prediction was on point.
