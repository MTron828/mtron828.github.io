Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player Episode 321"

Confirmed Defeat

Shaaaak-!

Karmugus' face was severed from the skull.

"Huh?"

It was a pathetic death, surprising enough to astonish Ryu Min, who had attacked.

Thud- Kwoong!

Ryu Min landed on the ground as the dragon's body collapsed terrifyingly sideways.

"He died so easily?"

Still, even though it was a boss, Ryu Min didn't think he would die with just an ordinary attack.

So, even as a message appeared in front of him, Ryu Min's expression remained dumbfounded.

[Experience Points +10,000,000] [Acquired experience points have exceeded 100,000.] [Experience points are converted to 100 stat points.] [Level up!]

Defeating one boss made him reach level 111.

No, it was defeating a dragon that was rather disappointing to be called a boss.

"I knew my damage was strong, but... I didn't expect I could withstand a normal attack like that."

Ryu Min stared at the disappearing corpse of Karmugus with a bewildered expression.

Other players' gazes were similar.

"Did he really die? In just one hit?"

"Haha... The so-called boss wasn't anything special, was it?"

"I feel so relieved now."

They had prepared various strategies to face the boss, only to end up with a result so anticlimactic that it took the wind out of their sails.

"Great Black Scythe, well done! It feels awkward to say well done because it was so easy, but haha..."

"We finally cleared round 20! Get ready to make a wish, everyone!"

"Oh, I didn't think about a wish... What should I wish for?"

"Ask to make me rich like Bill Gates. Become a tycoon who surpasses Bill Gates."

"I wish for eternal happiness and well-being for me and my family. To live without pain and be happy for a lifetime."

"Huh? That overlaps with mine? I was thinking of that wish too."

"What happens if our wishes overlap?"

"Maybe both will come true?"

"How about asking for eternal life for all of us together?"

"Hahaha! That sounds good!"

People were happily discussing their wishes, but Ryu Min's expression was not pleasant.

"No. It can't end like this."

It seems that defeating Karmugus is confirmed based on the gained experience points.

However, for some reason, it felt off.

While Ryu Min remained tense, Min Ju-ri approached.

"Thank you, Black Scythe."

"...."

"Black Scythe?"

"Yeah, sure."

"What's wrong? Your expression doesn't look good..."

"It's not over yet."

"Huh? It's not over?"

"The message isn't popping up."

As people heard Ryu Min's words, their voices faded.

"Huh? Come to think of it, why isn't the end message showing?"

"The round should be over since we defeated the boss, right?"

"Does the round end immediately after defeating it?"

"Something seems strange?"

"Angel! Come out quickly! We conquered round 20!"

Despite the calls, the angel did not appear.

Only then did people sense something odd, and they looked around nervously.

"Black Scythe. What's going on..."

"Wait."

Ryu Min, sensing a change, raised his hand.

At that moment.

Fwoosh-

All the torches that were lit went out.

When darkness descended in an instant, people were bewildered.

But more surprising than that was something else.

Light.

A radiant white light shining in the darkness.

With that light, a presence appeared.

Flutter-

A being with enormous wings unfolded before them, none other than an angel.

Arhtaros.

He revealed his form.

"Did the angel really appear when you called?"

"But it's not the same angel we saw earlier, right?"

"Is it an angel giving rewards?"

People, who were murmuring, couldn't take their eyes off the dazzling figure of the self-luminous angel.

Some had ecstatic expressions.

Some were full of anticipation, thinking it might be an angel giving rewards. However, Ryu Min, who knew the identity, could only gaze at the figure with a cold look.

'Finally, Arhtaros has appeared.'

He had anticipated that Arhtaros would show up before the end of round 20.

Therefore, it was not something too surprising.

'I thought I might meet him in the boss room, but he actually appeared.'

The opponent was the only one who overwhelmed Ryu Min with stats in the tens of billions.

Naturally, Ryu Min should have been nervous, but strangely, he felt a sense of calm.

Was it like the feeling when you study like crazy and then the questions that come out in the test match what you've reviewed?

"I would have been disappointed if it didn't show up."

The strategies planned with teammates in reality were all preparations for the final showdown with Arhtaros.

Because he was someone who had once targeted him, Ryu Min anticipated that they would definitely cross paths.

"Good. If it's an opponent I can't avoid anyway, it's better to finish it decisively this time."

Even though he had a bit of a hard time in their previous fight, Ryu Min was confident that he wouldn't lose.

He had become much stronger than before, and he was benefiting from the buffs of his teammates.

Especially thanks to Min Ju-ri's max-level skill 'Double Buff,' the effects of Bless were applied to him in duplicate.

"In other words, my stats increased fourfold with just one Bless."

With this, it was clear that if the opponent's skill level remained unchanged, he wouldn't stand a chance.

"Seeing you again, the mortal Black Scythe."

At Arhtaros' words, everyone turned to look at Ryu Min.

"Do you two know each other? Black Scythe?"

"Yeah, we do. He's someone I've fought against."

Without taking his eyes off Arhtaros, Ryu Min asked, "So, what's going on here?"

[What's going on? I came to exterminate all of you humans.]

The players' expressions stiffened at the mention of "exterminate."

Some realized that they were facing an enemy.

"Ridiculous. Worthless creatures like you standing against someone without even knowing who they are."

"Who was the one who got knocked out by those worthless creatures?"

Even with Ryu Min's provocation, Arhtaros showed no reaction.

He stared back with emotionless eyes.

[I acknowledge your strength, Black Scythe. It's not just your skill, but when I saw you walking around unscathed, having erased the memories from that time, I was honestly surprised. You seem to possess far more abilities than I thought.]

"So, did you come out this time after studying a bit more? Seeking revenge?"

[The emotion of revenge is a luxury for me. There's nothing as meaningless as harboring petty emotions towards the opponent.]
ChatGPT

"So why are you interfering with us? Weren't you seeking human mercenaries to win in the Celestial Demon War? If we can't pass Round 20, not only can we not help, but the gods who bet on the Celestials will lose in the wager."

[War no longer matters now. The Higher One wishes to annihilate you and overturn the board.]

"...."

[I move for that reason alone. I harbor no personal emotions or grievances towards you. Frankly, whether you humans live or die is of no concern to me. However...]

"So, you're just following the orders of the Higher One?"

[Yes.]

"Did that guy who gave the orders call himself the Primordial God?"

Arhtaros, whose expression remained unchanged, slightly twitched his eyebrows.

[Your tone is irritating. You're not someone to speak so disrespectfully.]

"Irritating? The Primordial God is nothing but a damn piece of garbage."

Swearing at the superior clearly had an effect.

Arhtaros, who claimed to be emotionless, showed a hint of anger that hadn't been seen before.

[Do you think provoking me will end well?]

"That's not something a guy who died thirty times should say, right?"

[I admit I was overpowered. However, don't delude yourself into thinking I fear you. The reason I stepped back then was because I judged that your memory had been erased. It wasn't out of fear.]

"I see. You're an existence that doesn't die. But can't you kneel before me with your power?"

An equal relationship where they couldn't kill each other.

That was the relationship between Black Scythe and Arhtaros.

However, Arhtaros smiled.

It wasn't without a plan that he appeared without any countermeasures.

[Still, I can tie the fate of you and the humans here.]

"What are you talking about?"

[Why do you think Round 20 isn't ending?]

Ryu Min furrowed his brow as he read Arhtaros's thoughts.

"No way..."

[With the help of the Primordial God, the Round 20 boss has been changed to me. It's not a feeble Red Dragon that died in one hit just now.]

"That means..."

Arhtaros smiled with a hint of satisfaction.

[Yes. To pass the round, you have to kill me. But can you kill me? Me, who endlessly resurrects even after death?]

"...."
ChatGPT

Do we have to kill Arhtaros, cursed with immortality, to pass the round?

It seemed impossible.

It was ideal to tie himself up with his own ankles according to his words.

[Even if you can't pass by killing me, if I stay still, you will be annihilated by the rules after the time limit. So, your defeat is essentially confirmed.]

Ryu Min nodded in agreement.

"Yeah, your words are correct. However."

Swish-

When he aimed the scythe, Arhtaros's gaze strangely changed.

"I'll have to try everything I can."

[Foolish. Mortal. You dare to rush in knowing it's a dead-end.]

"Actually, because it's a dead-end, isn't it necessary to try everything we can?"

[That's why I call you foolish, human. No matter how you resist, the outcome won't change...]

Before Arhtaros could finish speaking, his head fell.

Thud-

Players who were tense about the boss's death widened their eyes.

"D-Did he kill him?"

"W-We won. Black Scythe won!"

"Not yet!"

At Ryu Min's shout, people who were cheering turned to him with puzzled eyes.

"It's not a time to celebrate. Look over there."

"Huh?"

As they turned their gaze, everyone collectively held their breath.

Strangely, Arhtaros's severed head was reattaching itself.

"That guy is an immortal. No matter how many times you kill him, he keeps coming back to life."

"What? An i-immortal?"

"S-So, how do we kill him?"

"You fool! He's immortal, so we can't kill him!"

"C-Crazy. Earlier, he said the defeat was confirmed, and now this was his intention?"

Ryu Min shouted again at the bewildered people.

"Don't be surprised! Stay calm and maintain tension! If you straighten up your mind, there will be a way."

[A way?]

Arhtaros, fully resurrected, sneered openly.

[If you can't kill me, how do you plan to pass the round?]

"But we can't just sit back and do nothing."

[I'd rather stay still; it would be less painful. I have no intention of just standing still.]

"Is that so?"

Smirking, Ryu Min pulled up the corners of his mouth.

"Then let's give it a try."
