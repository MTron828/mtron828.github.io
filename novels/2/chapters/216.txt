Title: Episode 216 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Information Sharing

[Hero's Rune]

Effect: Accumulates 1 stack (up to 100) each time rescuing another person.

As the number of stacks increases, all stats increase. Conversely, when stacks decrease, the stat boost decreases.

By consuming 100 stacks, the caster can cast "Hero's Protection" on a designated person they want to protect.

During the activation of Hero's Protection, the caster can use "Hero's Touch."

└ Hero's Protection ▶ Activates upon receiving an attack, providing an absolute shield that blocks any attack for 10 seconds.

Once cast, it lasts indefinitely until triggered. It can only be cast on one target, and it cannot be used on oneself.

If stacks are rebuilt and cast on another target, the previous target is released.

└ Hero's Touch ▶ Can move to or summon the location of the target protected by Hero's Protection.

Can only be used within 10 seconds after the activation of Hero's Protection.

"I finally obtained it. The Hero's Rune."

Among the essential list of 18 runes that must be obtained, this rune is useful when protecting a specific target.

"When the target is attacked, they become invincible for 10 seconds. During that time, you can use Hero's Touch to move to or summon the target's location."

For example, if you cast this skill on your younger sibling, they will be in a 10-second invincible state when attacked by someone.

At that moment, an alert will appear for Ryu Min, providing two choices.

Whether to use Hero's Touch to summon the younger sibling or move towards their location.

"It's truly a skill optimized for protecting your younger sibling."

Additionally, stacking the rune increases all stats, which is not bad.

It can be considered as a buff, as the stats only increase when there are stacks.

"Still, where else can you get all stats raised by 100? This rune alone is worth obtaining."

The condition is to rescue 100 people in crisis, but there's no need to worry.

Aren't there plenty of people here?

"You just have to use tricks like when obtaining the rune."

Summon the demon again and defeat it, and it will be recognized as saving people.

"The problem is that once a person is saved, they cannot be saved again."

Having already used up 100 slots, new people were needed to fill the remaining ones.

Fortunately, when all procedures were completed, the number of believers exceeded 170, including both Plesba members and non-members.

Considering there are 175 Korean players, almost everyone had joined.

"Better than expected. To gather this many."

Instead, despite using up 1.7 million points, it was not regrettable.

Considering the ease of consolidating players, it turned out to be a cost-effective deal.

"If we had filled up to 200, it would have been better, but opportunities don't last forever."

Ryumin, thinking that everyone had arrived, proceeded with his plan.

"Leader."

Hutaeseok, who received a nod, nodded again, aware that it was time to summon the second demon, having already given a signal.

Passing through the crowd, Hutaeseok secretly planted a seed on the ground.

Pong-

It was not difficult to plant the black seed. Just by using the skill, the black object seeped into the ground.

Hutaeseok nodded slightly, looking at Ryumin.

It meant that the second summoning was ready.

Watching the timing, Ryumin adjusted his mask and signaled.

Suddenly, a stem the thickness of a tree trunk shot up.

"Kkyaaa!"

Since it is summoned randomly, it is unknown which demon will be summoned. However, even Ryumin could not help but be surprised this time.

"That's Requiem, one of the top demons, right?"

With the sudden appearance of the second demon, players were once again thrown into confusion.

But only for a moment.

Perseuk-!

As Ryumin's scythe directly beheaded it, the situation came to an immediate end.

"Summoning another demon despite the warning. You really seem to be ignoring my words."

Although Ryumin spoke as if angry towards the virtual enemy, the face hidden behind the mask remained calm.

Instead, he chuckled while looking at the message that appeared before him.

[Hero's Rune Stack: 70/100] [All stats increase by 70 with the effect of Hero's Rune.]

"Good. Now I just need to stack 30 more."
ChatGPT

"When I reach 100 stacks, I can protect my younger sibling with Hero's Protection. Since there's no urgency yet, if I gradually accumulate them, there shouldn't be any problems."

"I'm done with this matter."

No, there was still one more thing left.

There was information to share with the 170 believers gathered here – the strategy for the upcoming 16th round.

"Now, I shouldn't just take care of acquaintances around me. The more people, the better."

Thinking about the approaching 16th round, it's best if as many players as possible survive. However, there's no reason to protect even the wicked.

"I've carefully examined everyone's true feelings, and there doesn't seem to be anyone with character issues. Even if I open up the strategy, it shouldn't cause any problems."

Of course, revealing the existence of the Prophet is not in the plans. It's enough to say that the information for the next round was obtained through a special reward selection box.

"Following this, there will be speeches from the Leader and Black Scythe. Those who have completed their registration, please come inside."

Following Eom Jun-seok's guidance, people entered the building.

As they took their seats in the large-scale worship hall that could accommodate 700 people, Hutaeseok ascended the platform.

"Welcome. Believers, I am the leader of the Church of the New Dawn, Nopaeinnoge. My real name is Hutaeseok. I'm grateful that more people have come than expected..."

Hutaeseok began his speech.

It was nothing special, just a simple greeting.

The person with important things to say was someone else.

"...That's all I have to say. Thank you. Now, let's move on to the words you've all been waiting for from Black Scythe."

As Ryumin, wearing a mask, ascended the platform, he looked around.

170 believers were all gazing at him.

"Nice to meet you. As you know, I am Black Scythe. Due to circumstances, I cannot reveal my face or real name. I hope you understand."

The believers nodded.

Although they were curious about Black Scythe's identity, it wasn't crucial at the moment. More importantly, they were curious about the information he was about to reveal.

"Using this opportunity, I'd like to convey important information to you. It's classified information that shouldn't be disclosed elsewhere."

"Classified?"

Amidst the murmurs, Ryumin's shocking statement continued to reverberate among the people.
ChatGPT

"I have information about the next round. I intend to share it here and now."

The murmurs inside the hall, which were buzzing a moment ago, quieted down like a splash of cold water.

The idea of knowing information about the next round in advance was unprecedented.

"I'm sure you're curious about the source of this information, but it's simple. If you become the first in the entire zone, you receive a special reward selection box. With that reward, you can choose information about the next round. I often chose that reward and easily conquered the next rounds."

Among the astonished believers, there were even those who nodded in agreement.

"Ah... So that's why Black Scythe was able to conquer rounds so easily."

It now made sense why they thought his insight was remarkable.

"I'm revealing this fact now because we can no longer stand by and watch the number of players decrease. That's the reason I'm sharing the information about the 13th round with all of you. To survive together."

To willingly share information for the greater cause of survival, sacrificing personal rewards—what a display of altruism.

"Ah..."

"Black Scythe, sir..."

In the face of such nobility, the believers were collectively moved.

Some had already developed a degree of faith, even clasping their hands together.

Seeing their reactions, Ryumin smiled beneath his mask.

"For the sake of the 16th round, let's all try to survive as much as possible."

Slowly, he began to unfold the strategy.

"Sariel will not return. It is presumed that she has died."

Upon hearing the news as powerful as a thunderbolt, some angels sighed, while others chuckled.

"Well, I expected this. If 7th place fell, it's not strange for 6th place to follow suit."

Raguel, ranking 5th and the Archangel of Justice, sneered.

From the beginning, he was not pleased with sending someone other than himself as the 6th.

"Laguel. Are you gossiping about the Archangel among Archangels just because she's not here?"

When Gabriel issued a stern warning, Raguel smirked with pursed lips.
ChatGPT

"Isn't that an accurate statement? Just because I sent the 6th place, we ended up with five Archangels. This is clearly a misjudgment."

"Say that in front of Archangel Michael. Let's see if you won't end up in the punishment pouch."

[...]

The punishment pouch is the celestial realm's punishment of being confined in a venomous prison where bugs abound.

For Raguel, who was unusually clean, there was no choice but to keep his mouth shut.

"Don't complain like that. Archangel Michael's judgment was not wrong. Sariel was more than capable on her own. The darkness of a Reaper class and the darkness of an Archangel are different."

"But why did it end up like this?"

"I don't know."

"Are there things even Archangel Gabriel, with prophecy and revelations, doesn't know?"

"I have been given such titles simply because my physical form is composed of a material suitable for conveying God's words. My outer shell is merely a medium used to transmit God's messages."

Raguel's expression remained unchanged even after Gabriel's words.

Regardless, wasn't it an unchanging fact that he failed to capture Black Scythe?

"Judging by your expression, it seems this situation is unsatisfactory."

"Honestly, yes. If I had taken the lead, it would have been over for sure."

"That's unknown. Even if you had taken the lead, the result might have been the same."

Provoked by the nonchalant taunt, Raguel lost his temper.

"Archangel Gabriel, treating me as equal to those 6th and 7th ranks...!"

"Watch your words."

At the sound of a majestic voice, they turned to see the radiant appearance of the top-ranked Archangel, Michael.

"Where is the Archangel who denigrates our fallen comrades as if they were insignificant?"

"I-I apologize."

Bowing immediately to the dignified voice, it was Raguel who didn't know.

That the culprit who drove the angels to their deaths was right in front of him.

"I admit that Sariel's death was unexpected. It's my mistake."

"No, Archangel Michael's judgment was not wrong. The human called Black Scythe was much stronger than anticipated."

"That's right. I didn't even know Sariel would die."

It wasn't an empty excuse; it was genuine regret.

While Raguel thought Sariel might be weaker than himself, she was still considered a formidable enemy as a Reaper, so there was concern about Black Scythe being drawn to heaven and possibly being disqualified as a player.
ChatGPT

Thus, his wish to become a god would not easily fade away.

"But it seems the worry was unnecessary."

Archangel Michael, who had already obtained information from Akashic Records through Rubahiro, contemplated.

"He didn't even suffer a scratch against Sariel?"

Because of this, despite Michael's serious expression, he could be reassured.

He now had faith that even if they sent the next Archangel, Black Scythe would prevail.

"It seems like it's Raghuel's turn to step up."

"Is that so, Archangel Michael? Are you giving me a chance?"

"Yes, execute your brother. Bring him back alive, as I said. Can you handle that?"

"Of course! Just leave it to me! I'll bring that vermin who deserves to die for sure..."

"That won't do."

The two angels turned their heads at the interjecting voice. It was none other than Gabriel expressing a dissenting opinion.

"Although it's true that Raghuel is strong, sending him alone is also risky. It seems better to go with Uriel, who is ranked 4th."

"No, Archangel Michael! I'm more than enough alone!"

"Yes, sending Uriel as well would be a good idea."

Even when Raphael, ranked 3rd, tried to intervene, Michael had no choice but to ponder.

"Sending both 4th and 5th ranks? That's a bit..."

If it were only Raghuel, he believed Black Scythe could be defeated.

However, the thought of adding Uriel, the Archangel of light and flames, made him worry.

"Can Black Scythe really defeat the two of them?"

Michael nodded inwardly.

Even if he defeated Sariel without a scratch, it might be impossible to handle the two.

Whether in terms of combat power or numerical advantage, they were different from Sariel.

"Archangel Michael, please make a decision."

At Gabriel's urging, Michael could not remain indecisive.

There was no justification to send only Raghuel.

"Rather than repeating the same mistake, it's better to send both to ensure a decisive conclusion."

Having accepted it with a murmur, Michael spoke with a solemn voice.

"Uriel and Raghuel, listen. Bring back Black Scythe decisively in the 13th round."

"Yes, Archangel Michael. Don't worry; we'll handle it."

"We'll cleanly bring him back as per your instructions."

The two angels replied with confident voices.
