Title: The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 319

Episode 319: The Start of Round 20

72 humans appeared in a colorless space.

Perhaps due to it being the last, the number of participants was modest, but Ryu Min was satisfied with this alone.

"When I first came, I was alone."

However, in the 20th round, the second experience, Ryu Min was not alone.

There was no need to worry about being alone, as many participants stood shoulder to shoulder with him.

"You've finally made it here."

At the sudden voice, Ryu Min looked up to see the angel Milen with a delighted face.

"I had my doubts, but I never thought you'd make it to Round 20. I thought at most one or two would survive, but I didn't expect this many. Truly impressive."

People looked at Milen with faces expressing they didn't understand what was so impressive, but the angel paid no mind.

After all, once she guided them to the end, they would no longer be seen.

"As you've come all the way to the final round, I can't help but hear your impressions. Anyone want to share?"

No one spoke at her words.

Only eyes filled with resentment.

It wasn't that anyone came here willingly.

"Why do your expressions look like that? Aren't you happy? If you clear this round, you can fulfill your wishes. If all 72 pass, every one of you will have your wishes granted!"

"Enough, open the quest window."

At Ryu Min's command, Milen flinched and then awkwardly smiled.

"Haha, you must be curious. Shall we check what the long-awaited 20th round quest is right away?"

People couldn't hide their surprise at the quest window that appeared.

"What, what is this? It's all question marks?"

"I can't see the quest."

"Am I the only one who can't see it?"

With a rumble, people were bewildered.

Among them, the only one not surprised was Ryu Min, who had already experienced it.

"I was confused at first too. It's frustrating."
ChatGPT

Feeling the need to figure out the quest on his own, Ryu Min thoroughly explored the entire continent.

As a result, he discovered a temple with a boss room, but he knew that he would have been as perplexed as others if it weren't for that finding.

"The problem is that the boss room may not be the final quest."

Until he faced annihilation in front of the boss room, the quest had not been revealed.

This meant that even Ryu Min, at the present moment, didn't know the details of the 20th-round mission.

People, who had felt frustrated, looked at the angel as if seeking answers.

"Hoho, seems like you're all surprised because the quest isn't visible. Unfortunately, the quest for this round is private. Don't worry too much; it will naturally be revealed as you progress through the rounds... Heek!"

Ryu Min, leaping through the air, closed the distance in an instant and seized the angel's throat with the grip of death.

"Keuk, kek!"

"Tell me honestly. What is the quest for Round 20? If not, I'll snap your neck right here."

"Keuk, I, I have to release this to speak!"

Releasing the struggling creature, Ryu Min allowed it to catch its breath while wheezing.

"Now tell me. Don't waste time with private or whatever."

"I, I don't know! I'm just following the system's guidance...!"

Milen spoke briefly and then gasped for breath.

The intense gaze of Ryu Min, as if ready to tear the angel apart at any moment, pressured its body.

"Don't lie. Did you think I wouldn't know that you angels have been doing this more than once or twice?"

"I really don't know! I, I'm new to handling guidance! This is my first time!"

Trembling, the angel spoke with evident fear.

The fact that Ryu Min was notorious for massacring angels added to its anxiety.

'He's not lying.'

Reading the thoughts, Ryu Min withdrew his gaze and descended.

"Believe me. Now explain."

"Yes, yes!"

The angel, who had been rubbing its sore throat, continued its explanation.

"As I said earlier, I don't know about the mission. Angels assigned to guidance are always newcomers... But if you conquer this round, everyone can survive. You can also get all your wishes granted. Of course, I don't know the details, so even if you ask, I won't be able to tell you. I just repeat what I heard from the manual..."
ChatGPT

Milan, usually not one to babble excuses, seemed particularly flustered under Ryu Min's threat.

"For your information, the stage for this round is a fantasy world, and we can't determine the quest objective. Because of that, we don't know the criteria for passing, and there are no sub-quests either."

"W-Well..."

"You mean you know nothing?"

"Sigh..."

Sighs escaped from the mouths of people, almost involuntarily.

"If I may provide some useful information, in this round, hunting monsters won't accumulate experience points or gold. So, those who haven't reached the maximum level need not waste time hunting..."

"No need to worry about that. We're all at the max level."

In response to Ryu Min's words, Milen forced an awkward smile.

"That's fortunate. Very fortunate."

"Any other information?"

"Uh, what else was there? Right, in this round, all of you are in a party. We may not know the mission's identity, but at least it's not a mission where you kill each other."

"Ah."

"That's a relief."

Audible sighs of relief echoed as concerns were silently eased.

"That concludes the explanation. Oh, there's not much information, so it might feel daunting, but since it's the last one, muster your strength. Well then!"

As if fleeing, the angel disappeared with a flash of light, and a slightly ominous message appeared in front of the people.

"In a moment, Round 20 will begin." "Due to the nature of the round, no rewards will be given for defeating monsters." "30 seconds later, you will be transported to the fantasy world."

When transported to the fantasy world, the players did not scatter.

They all moved to the same location.

"Where is this?"

"It's full of trees, so I can't tell where we are."

While people were wandering, Ryu Min knew.

It was the same starting point as the previous round.

"This is a place called the Forest of Maw. It's at the edge of the Lutus Mountains, and nearby is the Kingdom of Brahm."

"Ah."

People nodded, but unease lingered.

What good is knowing the location?

Especially when they don't know the most crucial quest objective.

That's why everyone relied on the practical leader, Black Scythe.

"Now what? Black Scythe?"
ChatGPT

"What should we do when the quest is private?"

"Seeing that we've been summoned here, does it mean we should try hunting monsters?"

Various opinions were voiced as everyone speculated, but Ryu Min shook his head.

The direction was already set.

"Let's start by exploring the surroundings. There might be hints about the quest."

"Should we all split up then?"

'Why split up when we already know the way?'

Suppressing his inner thoughts, Ryu Min nodded.

"No. It's dangerous to split up without a means of communication. Stick together and move."

"Understood."

"Let's go."

The group followed Ryu Min through the Forest of Maw. Since he remembered the location of the temple with the boss room, he took the lead.

Of course, to onlookers, it seemed like he was just strolling along.

"If we walk like this for an hour, we'll reach the ancient temple in ruins. The boss room is there."

Unable to reveal this fact to the people, Ryu Min pretended to explore the surroundings, wandering aimlessly.

"Black Scythe."

At that moment, Min Ju-ri approached Ryu Min and asked.

"Since we don't know what situation might arise, should I cast buffs on people in advance?"

"Sure. Go ahead. We're in a party anyway."

Although he had intended to make the request in front of the boss room, doing it now wouldn't hurt.

"Um... I apologize."

Min Ju-ri hesitated and then spoke with an awkward smile.

"I couldn't recognize your face. I saw in the news that Black Scythe revealed his face in front of people. But even after seeing that, I still couldn't recognize you in the café..."

"What's the big deal?"

"Thinking about it now, I apologize for criticizing you so much for pretending to be an ordinary person when I couldn't recognize you. I'm sorry."

"Don't bother. There's nothing to apologize for."

Ryu Min turned his head with an expression that clearly conveyed he didn't care.

However, beneath the indifferent expression, there was bitterness.

'Looks like memories about me were completely wiped.'

It was disheartening to be treated like a stranger, with only memories about Black Scythe remaining.

Yet, on the other hand, there was a sense of relief seeing himself free from the pain.

At that moment,

"Krrrr."
ChatGPT

The atmosphere was disrupted by the sudden appearance of monsters blocking the path for the group.

Despite the occasional monsters, as befitting the Forest of Maw, they posed no threat as long as Ryu Min was present.

[Experience Points +1,200]

"My experience points increased?"

Unexpectedly, Ryu Min gained experience points from the monsters that were expected to give nothing.

"Is it because of the Transcendent Rune?"

He suspected that it might be due to the rune that allowed him to gain experience points from all enemies.

Although the amount was small, Ryu Min was satisfied.

The fact that he could gain benefits that others couldn't was fulfilling.

"And with the increase in experience points, my stats will also rise with the Growth Rune."

Not only that, but accumulating a certain amount of experience points would also allow him to level up with the Transcendent Rune.

"I'd like to leisurely hunt monsters, but unfortunately, I don't have time for that."

Even though there was room for further growth, Ryu Min focused on reaching the destination rather than hunting.

There might be a time limit on the mission, so it was better to hurry.

"Oh? Have we finally left the forest?"

After walking for a while, they exited the Forest of Maw.

"Now that we're out of the forest, should we pick up the pace?"

Looking at the nodding companions, Ryu Min sprinted across the plain.

The estimated one-hour journey to the destination was reduced to 30 minutes.

By rushing with the others, they managed to shorten the time.

"Hey, what's this place?"

"Looks like some abandoned temple, doesn't it?"

Between the Forest of Maw and the Maze Forest, there was a crumbling ancient temple.

It was none other than the location where the boss room was hidden.

Ryu Min, who had discovered the temple by chance while walking, approached it.

"It seems like a suspicious place we haven't seen before. It's worth investigating."

In fact, it had been there in the previous round, but they couldn't access it; it was blocked by the system.

"You couldn't enter before the 20th round because the system had sealed it with a barrier."

Therefore, any trick to open the door and enter early wouldn't work.

It was impossible to enter by any means as long as it was blocked by the barrier.

Except now, in the 20th round.

"Found the boss room here too, just like the temple I found in the previous round, which took two hours to find. This time, I found it in 30 minutes."

Unlike before, he had some time now.

"The boss room is here."
ChatGPT

It was as if a bomber had just passed, leaving only debris behind. However, there was a separate, real entrance to this place.

"Everyone, come over here."

As Ryu Min casually cleared away the debris, a hidden underground staircase was revealed.

The boss room was below.

"It looks like there's something below here for sure. We should check it out, right?"

His companions nodded in agreement with Ryu Min's words.

"Then, let's all get ready before going in."
