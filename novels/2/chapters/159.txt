Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 159"

The Blessing of the Devil

Before Baeyul's Arrival

Ryumin called for Yantti.

"Yantti, do you remember what I asked you to do before? Tame 100 Millworms. Did you do it?"

"Of course, master. Just a hundred? I brought 1,000 of them for you."

Yantti's profession was a Tamer.

She could dominate and handle animals, insects, and monsters other than humans.

Of course, it was not always guaranteed, and the success rate increased as the intelligence and level of the target to be tamed decreased.

Therefore, taming 100 Millworms was not a difficult task for Yantti.

"Just in case, have you dominated anything other than Millworms?"

"I've dominated monsters of various kinds, starting from goblins. Boss monsters like Minotaurs had a higher level, so I couldn't tame them."

"It will be possible later. Right now, your level is low, that's why."

There was no limit to the number of monsters Yantti could tame.

Similar to being able to endlessly put items in the inventory, she could collect an unlimited number of monsters and insects.

However, there was a limit to the number she could summon simultaneously.

Summoning hundreds of tamed monsters all at once was not possible.

"I just summoned 100 for now."

"Yes!"

When Yantti used her skill, 100 Millworms appeared on the ground.

If it was an insect in reality, as long as it was tamed by Yantti, she could bring it to another dimension.

Crunch!

[Current Kill Count: 100/100] [All stats increase by 100% due to the Rune of Slaughter effect.]

As Ryumin stepped on and killed all 100 at once, the Rune of Slaughter buff was instantly filled.

While he was chuckling, a light flickered in front of him.

An angel, who had sent a rescue signal, appeared.

"Hmm."

Ryumin observed the being quietly.

You could gauge the strength of an angel by looking at its wings.

"The more wings and the longer, the stronger they are."

However, the battle angel in front of Ryumin clearly had short wings.
ChatGPT

Of course, compared to a regular angel named Kalen, the wings were longer.

'With four wings and judging by the length, it's probably a 6th-grade angel.'

Ryumin's knowledge of angel ranks was natural, thanks to his previous experiences. He had gathered various information by interrogating angels.

Even though he might not know advanced information, he was well-versed in basic information about the heavenly realm.

Therefore, Ryumin didn't feel the need to interrogate angels any further.

'Just kill them.'

Since he could read their thoughts with the Rune of Innermost Thoughts, there was no need to ask for information.

He could easily discern the angel's name, Baiel, and the fact that he was confident in his swordsmanship, all without a word being spoken.

'First, let's try a potion.'

Ignoring whatever Baiel was saying, Ryumin took out a potion and used it.

It was an intermediate potion, and all stats increased by 8.

While not a significant boost, increasing stats even by a little was necessary to maximize the initial rewards.

Filling the Rune of Slaughter buff and deliberately using the Ascension skill against the battle angel were also for this reason.

[Ascended State Activated.] [All stats, damage, attack speed, and movement speed increased by 44%.] [All damage received from enemies decreased by 44%.] [Probability of enemies detecting you reduced by 44%.]

'It's like using a big sword to catch a small chicken, but there's no choice.'

After provoking before using Ascension, the battle angel rushed in to attack as soon as Ryumin killed him.

Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo-

It was a reasonably fast speed, but it didn't affect Ryumin at all.

It wasn't just that; his current agility alone was over 8,800.

'Round buff, Rune of Balance, Rune of Slaughter, First Angel Slayer, and Minjuri's buff, all multiplied together, the increase was tremendous.'

Adding the Ascension effect on top of that resulted in an insane stat boost.

[Crack, crunch......]

With one swing of Ryumin's scythe, Baiel fell, spraying blood.

He ordered Kalen, who had become contemplative, to summon more.

In the meantime, Ryumin checked the message that appeared right after killing Baiel.
ChatGPT

[You have slain a Battle Angel.] [Confirmed as the player who first killed a Battle Angel.] [As a reward for the first Battle Angel kill, the 'Blessing of the Devil' buff has been applied.] [As a reward for the first Battle Angel kill, the 'Devil's Rune' has been obtained.] [The acquired rune is automatically engraved on the player's body!]

Just by defeating one Battle Angel, a cascade of messages appeared.

The first-time rewards were surprisingly generous.

'Above all, the Blessing of the Devil buff is the best.'

Ryumin's gaze then turned to the next message that appeared.

[You have been blessed by the Devil.] [Based on the current total stats (40,890), the following effects apply.] [Upon defeating an angel, receive gold equal to 1x (40,890) of the baseline. Increases up to 1,000x (40,890,000) depending on the angel's level.] [Upon defeating an angel, gain stat points equal to 0.01% (4) of the baseline. Increases up to 10% (4,089) depending on the angel's level.] [Upon defeating an angel, reputation with the demon faction slightly increases.] [The buff lasts until the end of the current round.]

The Blessing of the Devil is an extraordinary buff that allows you to gain stats and gold with each angel slain.

The rewards increase up to 1,000 times based on the level of the defeated angel.

'Just looking at the minimum values shows how incredible it is.'

Currently, for each angel slain, Ryumin gains 4 stat points and 40,890 gold.

Getting 4 stat points per angel killed?

'This is totally OP.'

It was almost like gaining a level with each angel killed.

'And this is just the minimum. The stronger the angel, the more I'll get.'

Of course, if it were someone else, they wouldn't have received such benefits.

It was because of the various buffs that inflated his stats, allowing him to receive such rewards.

The values of the rewards were determined based on the stats at the time of receiving the blessing.

'This is why I wanted to increase my stats even a little.'

The only drawback was that the buff lasted only until the end of the current round...

'But it's not a problem. I have the Devil's Rune.'

[Devil's Rune]

Effect: After defeating 100 angels, the 'Blessing of the Devil' buff can be used.

Even after the round ends, with the Devil's Rune, one can receive the blessing again as long as angels are defeated.

Though it comes with the condition of having to kill angels.
ChatGPT

‘It can't end with just killing one angel. I must kill at least 100. Whether to receive the reward of the blessing or to use the Blessing of the Devil again next time.’

Upon calculating the remaining time, Ryumin realized that he had at least an hour to hunt angels.

The rest of the time had to be spent completing sub-quests.

"Hey."

[...Yes?]

"Summon more."

Ryumin ordered Kalen to summon more angels.

Initially, five angels appeared, and then ten.

The outcome was predictable.

[You have defeated the 5th-grade angel 'Raphir'!] [Stat Points +8] [Gold +81,780] [Angels defeated: 15/100] [You have defeated the 5th-grade angel 'Bellu'!] [Stat Points +8] [Gold +81,780] [Angels defeated: 16/100]

'As expected, all 5th and 6th-grade angels. Send stronger ones.'

This time, ten angels appeared again.

Judging by their wings, they seemed to be 4th-grade angels.

[You, the human who slaughters angels.] [Boldly picking fights. I must make you die as painfully as possible.] [Pathetic human. Seems unlucky.]

But ironically, the unlucky ones were not Ryumin but the angels.

With heavily inflated stats, a few swings of the scythe were enough to end the situation.

[You have defeated the 4th-grade angel 'Volua'!] [Stat Points +16] [Gold +163,560] [Angels defeated: 26/100]

'Even 2nd or 3rd-grade would do; send stronger ones.'

Since time was limited, he hoped for stronger opponents.

Besides, there was no worry about reaching the ears of the seven Archangels.

'The high-ranking nobles won't casually appear here.'

Moreover, would selfish angels move just because a few soldiers died?

If they were to appear, it was more likely out of boredom.

'Once I reach 100 like this, I can go and break the sub-quest.'

Had he killed around 50?

When he had killed up to 4th-grade angels, steadily increasing his stats, a variable appeared.

[Hmm, were you killing angels in a place like this?]

Unlike before, a silent Ryumin faced the appearance of an angel with long and splendid wings.

'This... could it be... one of the seven Archangels?'

The angel in front of him clearly possessed extraordinary power among them.
ChatGPT

Just by looking at the wings, you could tell.

Majestic wings that, when spread, seemed to exceed 20 meters in grandeur.

A total of 8 wings, combined on both sides.

‘Certainly one of the seven Archangels.’

You could recognize a 1st-grade angel when you saw one.

Their wings couldn't exceed six in number.

‘But looking at the face, it's not the one I encountered in the previous round.’

Though lacking the overwhelming force of the one Ryumin had encountered before, this one still gave off an uneasy feeling.

‘What happened? Suddenly, one of the seven Archangels appears?’

Originally, he could have leisurely filled the quota of 100 angels and returned; nothing would have happened.

Nothing happened in the previous round, and the one before that, and the one before that.

So, he was at ease, but suddenly, a guy he hadn't seen before appeared out of nowhere.

Moreover, at this early timing.

‘Has the future shifted?’

Ryumin, maintaining tension, observed what the newcomer had to say.

[Are you the Black Scythe?]

‘You know my nickname?’

[Seeing you wielding a scythe, it seems correct. Well, the Akashic Record can't be wrong.]

‘Akashic Record?’

It was a term he had heard before.

When he defeated a High Orc in just one second, and when he broke through the 99th floor of the Tower of Trials.

Each time, a message appeared saying that it had been recorded in the Akashic Record.

[You set a new record twice, so I came to see. I also heard that you are killing my precious soldiers.]

‘Ah.’

Now Ryumin could roughly deduce the cause of the variable.

‘Originally, at this point, I should have been recorded in the Akashic Record only once for breaking through the Tower of Trials. But I set a new record twice.’

Defeating the High Orc in one second was a first this round.

Because of that, he ended up being recorded twice in the Akashic Record at this point.

It seemed that was what had created the variable.

‘What to do? Should I fight? There doesn't seem to be an immediate enemy, but...’

Since his thoughts were readable, he could understand.

The guy appeared out of curiosity.

However, there was a disdain for humans in his demeanor.

And upon closer inspection, Ryumin could discern more.
ChatGPT

Whatever it took, he was determined to kill himself to erase his existence.

‘This has become a bit troublesome. What should I do? Is there a chance if I fight?’

In a brief moment, Ryumin desperately dug into his inner thoughts, collecting information about his opponent.

He also learned that the guy's name was Remiel.

He belonged to the lowest rank among the seven Archangels and possessed the power of lightning.

‘He can read thoughts like other angels and foresee the future seven seconds ahead. Maybe there's a chance.’

At least once, Ryumin had the desire to challenge the seven Archangels.

He wondered what reward he would get if he killed him.

Considering there were hidden rewards even from ordinary angels, the system probably had rewards for the seven Archangels as well.

‘The unfortunate part is that there's no more time to contemplate.’

If he was going to fight, he had to do it now.

Soon, the Ascension would end.

‘If I kill Yantti's monsters, I can reset the time.’

But Ryumin didn't give Yantti any attention.

He didn't even glance in her direction.

To avoid interference, she had hidden in a remote corner long ago.

‘Yantti's abilities need to be continually utilized. I can't let her die here just to maintain the Ascension buff.’

Time was of the essence.

There were only ten seconds left until the Ascension ended.

Anyone needed to die to reset the time.

Especially if he was going to fight the seven Archangels.

‘In that case…’

Ryumin's gaze shifted to Kalen, who was next to Remiel.

The sickle scythe quickly extended.

At the same time, Remiel opened his mouth.

[Why so silent? Can't we have a conversation at least...]

Splat!

Kalen's head shattered into pieces, and blood sprayed towards Remiel.

Along with it, Ryumin's Ascension time reset.

‘Done!’

Fortunately, he was able to maintain the Ascension, but judging by the expression, Remiel seemed infuriated.

[No need for conversation, is that it?]

Sparks flew around Remiel's entire body, which had been showing signs of anger.

[I'll grant your wish. Human.]
