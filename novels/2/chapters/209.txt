Title: Episode 209 of the 100th Rebirth of a Max Level Player

Parking Lot

Ryumin decided to meet Russell while abroad.

He had some things to discuss in person, and he was curious about Russell's financial situation.

"Mr. Ryu! Long time no see!"

Russell approached with a friendly wave at JFK International Airport in New York.

Ryumin also smiled and approached, shaking hands.

"Did it take a long time to come?"

"Oh, no. I watched a movie and took a nap, so it was quick."

It takes 7 hours from the UK to the US.

Although Ryumin had intended to visit considering the considerable distance, Russell insisted on coming himself.

"How about going to the market? We can talk over lunch."

"Oh, how did you know I'm hungry? Sure, let's go!"

Ryumin, who took Russell to a steakhouse at the airport, ordered various items from the menu.

"Do you think you can eat it all since you seem hungry?"

"Oh, yes. If you're going to eat meat, you have to eat this much."

"Don't worry about money at all. I'll cover everything."

"Oh, what are you saying! Of course, I should pay. I can't take advantage of free prophecies. Do you have a lot of money?"

When the topic of money came up, Ryumin remembered the advice he had given before.

"By the way, did you sell the stocks?"

"Oh, yes. I sold them as soon as I heard. Thanks to that, I made some money. It's the first time in my life that such a large sum has come into my bank account."

"How much did you make?"

"40,000 pounds."

Russell had invested 14,000 pounds in Ma Kyung-rok's company.

Now, it had nearly tripled to become a substantial sum of 40,000 pounds.

In Korean won, it was 65 million won.

Now he could comfortably take a break for several years without worrying about the rent.

"You made a lot."

"I, who had no capital, touched such a large sum... It's all thanks to the prophet. So, about the account..."

Before he could finish speaking, Ryumin raised his head.

As if he knew what he was going to say.

"Russell, use that money however you want."

"Huh? But didn't the prophet provide the initial capital? Since I borrowed the money, I should naturally repay it..."

"Do you remember what I said when we first met?"

Russell, who had been pondering, nodded.

"You mentioned investing in my potential."

"Yes. I have already deposited the investment funds with you. I don't plan to withdraw it until you reach the pinnacle of the blacksmith. I'm not someone who needs the money urgently."

"..."

"The ones who need money are the ones who should have it. So, use it as you please, Russell. If it feels burdensome to spend borrowed money, you can just keep the principal. Use the rest freely. After all, it's money that Russell has earned through direct investment."

In hindsight, both the initial capital and the investment information were all from Ryumin, so it couldn't be considered Russell's money.

However, since Russell wanted to hold it under the pretext of investment, Ryumin could only accept it with a grateful heart.

"I understand the intentions of the prophet. I may lack manners, but I will use this money for my living expenses. Thank you very much."

"Thanking someone for that amount of money, come on. But more importantly, I have something important to discuss with you..."

"Oh, is that why you came here? Please tell me."

As if prepared to listen, Russell leaned in, and Ryumin opened his mouth with a serious expression.

"Have you heard about the nickname 'Black Scythe'?"

"Black Scythe? Of course!"

Russell, too, was aware of the top-ranked player.

"In the next 13 rounds, Black Scythe will come for you."

"What? Black Scythe?"

Not only was it surprising that the top-ranked player was coming, but how could someone faceless find him?

"How do they know about me?"

"I don't know. But you'll find out soon. I will tell Black Scythe to meet Russell."

"What?"

The meaning of those words was clear.

"Wa, wait. Are you saying that you're acquainted with Black Scythe in real life?"

"Yes. I ended up forming a connection with them."

Russell, who initially looked puzzled, eventually nodded in understanding.

If Ryumin was a prophet who could see the future, he must also know the true identity of Black Scythe.

It wasn't so strange for the two of them to be acquainted in real life.

After ending the call, Ryumin immediately contacted Jeffrey.

"Jeffrey. Where is Christine?"

-She arrived in Korea a little while ago.

"Good. Lure her to the location I'm sending. You remember how to phrase it, right?"

-Of course.

"As soon as we hang up, proceed with the plan."

-I'll take care of it.

After sending Jeffrey a location text, Ryumin also called Seo Arin.

In the unmistakable voice of Black Scythe.

Ma Kyung-sang and Ma Kyung-soo were not originally close.

Growing up under a strict father while taking business classes, they saw each other as rivals.

They bickered like ordinary brothers, but it was all due to the competition for succession.

To them, brothers were just obstacles to be removed, realizing that only money ruled the world.

But the wariness and rivalry towards each other were only until last year.

As the eldest son, Ma Kyung-rok's company began to grow, they became uneasy.

Once it seemed like they would meet their father's conditions, they joined forces.

It was a temporary alliance to deal with a common enemy.

"Kyung-sang, have you thought about the plan?"

"Yeah, I thought about it. Kyung-soo, it's better to go with the plan you suggested."

"Right? The plan I proposed is the most realistic and has a high chance of success, isn't it?"

"It seems like that."

The plan proposed by the youngest, Ma Kyung-soo, was indeed simple.

Wearing a mask, they would kidnap Ma Kyung-rok on his way back from the company and propose a duel.

They would set the conditions of the duel in their favor.

To ensure they would win without fail.

It might be refused due to the disadvantageous conditions, but Ma Kyung-rok would have no choice but to listen.

If they threatened to kill him right away, what could he do?

He would have to accept with tears in his eyes.

"Hyung, if we follow my plan, we can smoothly send Kyung-rok hyung away. The one who wins the duel steps back from the successor position. Whether we win or not, it will be advantageous for us."

"So, accepting the duel will end everything?"

"Yes. It's practically our victory. Moreover, if we add a condition not to disclose anything, we can completely exclude Kyung-rok hyung from the successor dispute."
ChatGPT

"When the time comes, we'll compete fairly, just between us, okay?"

"Yeah, absolutely. Until then, we must never betray each other. Got it, hyung?"

"Hey! Do I look like someone who would do that? Don't you backstab me."

"I know, I know. Just consider it as words said without thinking too much."

Although Ma Kyung-soo tried to console by saying not to take the words to heart, inwardly, he was holding back a smirk.

'Once I deal with Ma Kyung-rok, next in line is you, you little brat.'

They joined forces to deal with the enemy known as Ma Kyung-rok, but Ma Kyung-soo intended to claim the successor position for himself.

By any means necessary.

"But what if Kyung-rok hyung rebels? Do we really have to resort to brotherly infighting?"

'Pathetic guy. The youngest son with a mind like a flower garden! Just pathetic.'

Ma Kyung-soo, who thought the question was pathetic, kept his thoughts to himself.

Regardless, Ma Kyung-sang was a convenient second brother to use.

"We have to. It's better not to kill him if possible, but if he resists to the point where it's difficult to control him..."

A glint of determination flickered in Ma Kyung-soo's eyes.

"We have to kill him. Even if he's the eldest."

"Hey, isn't that going too far? No matter what, killing is..."

"Then, is kidnapping a better option than murder?"

"Isn't that better than killing?"

"Hyung. Do you think you can inherit the Oseong Group without being prepared for that? Or do you plan to undermine me later? Already laying the groundwork?"

"Oh, no. Nothing like that. I was just thinking if there's a better way than killing..."

"So you're giving him a chance to live. If he accepts the duel, Kyung-rok hyung can still save his life."

"But, you know. Can the two of us really beat Kyung-rok hyung?"

"Why can't we? We're all at a similar level, right? Do you think we'd lose to Kyung-rok hyung, even with more experience?"

"Well, there's a feeling, you know? Haven't you felt it?"

"What?"

"The vibe Kyung-rok hyung gives off. Sometimes, his gaze gives me chills. At those times, it's like he's saying, 'Get lost, you serial killer.'"

"What are you talking about, hyung? Why would Kyung-rok hyung be scary? Don't tell me you're getting scared and keep undermining him?"
ChatGPT

"Ah, no, who's scared? It just happened sometimes."

"No need to be scared, hyung. Ma Kyung-rok isn't Black Scythe, and can't the two of us handle that guy?"

"Yeah, right?"

Unlike the confident Ma Kyung-soo, Ma Kyung-sang looked a bit worried.

'Ah, my idiotic second brother. Getting scared over this kind of thing. As expected, there's no successor material other than me.'

Thinking this, Ma Kyung-soo soon arrived at Ma Kyung-sang's underground parking lot.

"Hyung, should we have a detailed meeting tomorrow?"

"Yeah. We have plenty of time. Text me about what time tomorrow."

As Ma Kyung-soo nodded and got into the car, Ma Kyung-sang shook his hand.

"Be careful."

"I got it, hyung. Huh? What the hell."

As Ma Kyung-soo started the Porsche, he saw a warning light and got out of the car.

"What's wrong?"

"Looks like a flat tire."

"Suddenly?"

"I don't know. Oh, here. There's a hole, damn it."

"Yeah, drive more carefully. Do you go racing with your car club every morning?"

"Oh, right, I quit that a while ago."

"Then why did the tire suddenly go flat?"

"I have no idea. Oh, here we go. Some jerk probably..."

Sighing, Ma Kyung-soo looked at his brother.

"What can we do? Should I borrow your car at least?"

"Oh, it's a hassle... Alright, wait. I'll bring the car key."

While Ma Kyung-sang went up to the apartment, Ma Kyung-soo waited, smoking a cigarette.

Tick-tock-

"Ah, damn. Why won't this stick..."

The moment Ma Kyung-soo sensed someone approaching, he looked up.

"Hyung, you came so so...!"

Smack!

Struck by a shield, Ma Kyung-soo lost consciousness. Three minutes later, Ma Kyung-sang appeared.

"Kyung-soo, where are you? I brought the car key. Huh?"

Ma Kyung-sang, who was looking around, found a cigarette and a lighter where his brother was.

"What's this? This is Kyung-soo's..."

As he picked up the items, he felt someone rapidly approaching from behind.

Thinking it might be his younger brother, he turned his head, only to be struck hard in the face by the shield.

Thud-

"We're ready, sir. Yes. We'll take them now."

Soon, the van Ahn Sang-chul was in swiftly left the parking lot.
