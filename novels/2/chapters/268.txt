Title: Episode 268 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

At the Hotel

"Kristin?"

A worried voice came through when the call was answered.

Prophet, are you okay?

"Why are you suddenly saying that?"

-I visited your house, and I heard that it's broken.

Ryumin sighed quietly.

There's no one who doesn't know what happened.

"It happened unexpectedly. But you visited my house... Are you currently in Korea?"

-Yes. Not only that, but I'm in front of the hotel, too.

"Really?"

Surprised, Ryumin quickly searched for Kristin to track her.

[Facial and name match found. Tracking the target.] [Location of the target 'Kristin Craig' identified.] [Currently 78m away.] [Follow the arrow in front to track the target.]

She seems to be really in front of the hotel, or at least nearby.

I came all the way here. Can I see your face for a moment?

"...Sure."

After ending the call, Ryumin grabbed her coat and told her younger sibling.

"I'm going to meet someone for a moment."

"Who?"

"A colleague."

Following the tracking arrow, she found Kristin sitting in the lobby.

"Oh, Ryumin."

"Why are you here without saying anything?"

"I'm sorry. Seeing your house like that made me worried."

"Follow me."

Ryumin took Kristin to a nearby cafe for now.

"What do you want to eat? Choose whatever you like. I'll pay."

"No, it's okay. I suddenly came here, so I shouldn't..."

"Even so, if a guest comes, can I not treat them? Choose freely."

"T-Thank you."

Kristin ordered a simple cup of coffee.

After Ryumin ordered the same, she got to the point.

"I thought you went to the United States... Why did you come to our house?"

"Oh, that's not for any other reason. Last time, you came to the U.S. to tell me about the prophecy, right? So, I thought it's my turn to visit this time..."

"Is that really the only reason?"

"Yes..."

Ryumin stared at Kristin as if scrutinizing her.

It was a somewhat sharp gaze, but Kristin, instead of feeling intimidated, seemed rather embarrassed and lowered her eyes.

"Really. You came for such an insignificant reason."

Reading Ryumin's thoughts, she inwardly sighed, but at the same time, she felt grateful. No matter how tough someone is, being cared for by someone weakens the heart.

"Um, I-I'm sorry."

Misunderstanding Ryumin's continued stern gaze, Kristin apologized again.

"I came to talk and find you... Was it too sudden?"

"It was indeed sudden."

"I'm really sorry. By the way, what happened? Why did your house end up like that?"

"Angels came to visit."

"What?"

Since Kristin already knew the truth, Ryumin didn't hide anything and explained the situation.

"You might not know, but angels think of me as their enemy. But I never expected them to come to our house and target my sister."

"An, angels targeted your sister? Is she okay?"

"Fortunately, I was able to intervene before it was too late."

"Angels? What happened to them?"

"How did it go?"

Ryumin smirked.

Just that cynical smile was enough of an answer.

"No one was hurt, so I'm really relieved."

"I also think the same way."

"Is that why you returned to the island late? Dealing with the angels..."

"That's right."

"I hope there won't be such incidents next time..."

"Actually, because of that, I've been on edge lately. The anxiety of possibly losing my sister..."

As if just the thought of it was unpleasant, Ryumin turned her gaze outside the window.

Looking at the vast sky and the city below resembling toy blocks, her chest felt constricted with frustration.

However, Kristin, with lingering concern in her eyes, looked at Ryumin.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes. I'm fine."

"Um, I don't know how this may sound, but..."

After a moment of hesitation, Kristin gathered courage.

"If you ever need anything, feel free to rely on me."

"..."

“I wouldn't be alive if it weren't for the Black Scythe, right? So don't feel burdened and use me anytime. If it's to protect my sister 24/7, I'll do it. I may not have the power to stop angels, but it's better than having nothing, right?”

Telling her to use her as she pleases.

Kristin never expected to hear such words from Ryumin.

"It's okay to use and discard me. Whatever it is, I want to be of help to the Black Scythe. I truly mean it."

Ryumin just silently stared at Kristin.

'It's sincere. Even without reading her thoughts, I can feel it.'

She could sense Kristin's sincere desire to help in any way possible.

"Thank you for your words, but there's really nothing for you to help with at the moment."

"If I stay by your sister's side..."

Ryumin earnestly shook her head.

"The angel I dealt with is not an easy opponent. As a supporter like you, you won't even be able to play the role of a normal shield."

"Is that so..."

Although Kristin looked disheartened by the blunt words, it was an unavoidable truth.

Kristin is a crucial asset.

They can't afford to lose her as just a shield.

Sipping her coffee, Kristin looked pitiful, like a wet puppy caught in the rain.

Her attitude seemed to convey that helping the Black Scythe was her sole source of happiness.

Ryumin reluctantly added, "It doesn't mean I'm rejecting your help. If there's something needed later on, I promise to call you."

"Really?"

Nodding, Kristin's face noticeably brightened.

"You promised! If there's anything I can help with, I'll definitely call."

"You're already helping enough."

"No, helping as a supporter is obvious. I want to be of help in personal matters."

"Yes, yes. Let's promise."

Ryumin has nothing to lose.

But she can't handle Kristin, a key force.

"Shall we leave once you finish the drink?"

"Yes."

Ryumin and Kristin left the cafe.

The two stood in front of the elevator, exchanging farewell greetings.

"I'd like to accompany you to the airport if possible, but I don't know what might happen to my sister."

"I understand. If you need anything, feel free to call. I'll be running to you a month after taking the plane."

Eventually, Kristin, entering the elevator, waved and smiled.

While Ryumin went into the lobby restroom, Minjuri was mentally organizing the scene she had witnessed.

"Why did Chrisi meet Min?"

When Ryumin's name appeared in the tracking results, Minjuri decided to go and see him.

To confirm if the Ryumin she knew was indeed the one here.

That's how she ended up at this hotel and coincidentally found a woman resembling Chrisi in the lobby.

She witnessed everything, from Ryumin meeting Chrisi to having coffee and chatting in the cafe.

"What could they have to talk about?"

She couldn't hear the conversation as she kept a distance of over 30 meters.

She watched silently, wearing a worried expression, but then saw Chrisi suddenly brightening up and laughing.

"What could they be talking about that makes her laugh so happily?"

Even a third party could tell this was jealousy, but the individuals involved were unaware.

"Did Ryumin call her? Why did he choose Chrisi when he promised to let me know first once he decided where to stay?"

Is this the love triangle she had only heard about?

Her mind became complicated.

Though she rarely felt stressed, contemplating this alone wouldn't lead to any answers.

The most certain solution was to ask Ryumin.

"I should ask when he comes out."

She stared at the entrance to the restroom, waiting, but he didn't come out.

"What's going on? Is there some big trouble...?"

"Minjuri."

"Eek!"

Startled by the voice from behind, Minjuri turned around.

It was Ryumin.

Her heart, which had just revived, almost fell again.

"You got startled, huh?"

"Someone said I was being followed, and it turns out it was you?"

"Oh, you knew?"

Ryumin smiled slyly at the flustered Minjuri.

"Of course. My detection range is 60 meters."

He didn't explain the reason, though.

"What are you doing here?"

"Well, um, that's..."

"You followed me with Tracking too?"

"You too...?"

"Chrisi also came to the hotel. With Tracking."

"Oh... I thought you called me."

It turned out he didn't call.

Just like her, Chrisi had also come on her own with Tracking.

The small misunderstanding was resolved.

"I was actually planning to tell you the address, but let's talk now."

"Uh-huh."

The two of them took their seats in the cafe again.

It was the same place where they had talked with Kristin.

"Order something to drink. I'll pay."

"What about you?"

"As you might have seen, I already had something to eat earlier."

"Uh, sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop..."

"It's okay."

Understanding, Ryumin waited for Minjuri's coffee to arrive before getting to the main point.

"What did you want to talk about?"

"Huh?"

"You called me and said you had something to discuss in person. What's the matter?"

After hesitating to answer Ryumin's question, Minjuri finally spoke after taking a deep breath.

"You... Did you lie to me?"

"What are you talking about?"

"Your nickname, is it really Lost Yak?"

"..."

"At the end of the round, when the Black Scythe called you, I paid close attention, and there was no such nickname. What's going on?"

"Well, that..."

"That's not the only strange thing."

As if resolving to solve all curiosities at once, Minjuri continued.

"When I use Tracking, even if I know your name and face, it doesn't match."

"..."

"I'm not talking about Tracking in the Otherworld. I'm talking about reality. In reality, your name and face don't match even when using Tracking. Isn't that strange, even for you?"

"..."

"There's another strange thing. No matter how much I looked on the remote island, I couldn't see your appearance. Even though it was undoubtedly a realistic, non-customized body."

The number matches, but the appearance doesn't show?

That would indeed feel quite strange.

"Were you... Were you really on the island from the beginning?"

Ryumin remained silent.

Minjuri was asking questions with the assumption that she already had the answers.

'I do have the answers.'

But it's an answer she can't reveal.

An answer that must be kept hidden.

To explain everything, she would have to reveal her true identity.

Then, suddenly, a phrase flashed through Ryumin's mind.

Shouldn't you reveal your identity? So that you won't be shocked like me?

Why did her sister's words come to her now?

'Perhaps... she might understand.'

As soon as the thought of testing it out crossed her mind, Ryumin's mouth moved.
