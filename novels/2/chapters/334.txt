Title: "Episode 334 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player"

7th Heavenly War

As the message disappeared, the location changed.

It was a vast meadow, different from the hellish background of Round 18.

"Is this where the final round took place?"

Alone, he looked around.

Woosh-

With the sound of a horn, a massive gate opened, and winged battle angels stepped onto the meadow.

It was the players' turn.

"How many are there in total?"

Countless angels poured in through the gate without a break.

Angels, all armed to the teeth with fierce expressions, quickly filled the surroundings.

The once spacious meadow now seemed narrow.

"Probably around 100,000?"

Ryumin's estimate was accurate.

[A moment later, a war between 100,921 Celestials (+1 player) and 283,078 demons will begin.] [The faction whose forces fall below 10% first will be considered defeated.] [Then, after a 10-minute waiting period, the 7th Heavenly War will commence.]

100,000 against 280,000.

Even a kindergartener could predict the outcome, but the crucial factor was not the quantity but the quality.

On this battlefield, with skill alone, one could turn the tide.

"However, objectively speaking, the Celestials probably won't win."

With the death of the 7 Archangels, there were only a few top-tier angels left to represent the Celestials.

"Other gods probably don't know. It's a principle not to disclose internal affairs before the war."

Gods like Chaos or Artharos and some related gods like Nemesis or Moros might be aware, but the rest probably remained ignorant.

Once news spread about the death of the Archangels, chaos would ensue.

"So, they must have thoroughly concealed the information, even about me."

There was a high chance that no one knew he had defeated Plutonictos and become the Demon King.

They wouldn't have informed all deities about his transformation into the Demon King.

On the contrary, the angels, who had been watching the demon forces with faces full of concern, turned their heads at the sound coming from behind.

As if staring at an enemy, they uncomfortably gave way with displeased looks.

For Ryumin to pass through.

Step by step, Ryumin advanced, piercing through the crowd of angels that split like the Honghai.

Then, coming to a stop at the forefront, he scanned the soldiers like a commander inspecting his troops.

"Listen up, the 100,000 here, gather."

Though everyone frowned at Ryumin's command, posing as a commander out of the blue, it was only for a moment.

A title hidden above Ryumin's head was revealed.

[The title 'Ruler of the Sky' has been publicly revealed.] [Player 'Black Scythe' is promoted to Archangel status.] [All angels recognize the player as an Archangel.]

When he disclosed the title that granted him equal status to an Archangel, the gaze of the angels changed.

From resentful looks to admiring eyes.

Having noticed the change, Ryumin lifted one corner of his mouth.

"From now on, I am your commander."

In the hall of the gods adorned like a VVIP viewing section.

There, an untimely confusion was unfolding.

"What happened? Why can't we see the Archangels on the Celestial side?" [Is it true? I can't see them even if I rub my eyes and look again.] [The 7 Archangels who secured victory in the 5th Heavenly War are missing?] [How could this happen!] [What happened during this time?]

About a dozen gods who had bet on the Celestials were bewildered, clutching their heads.

On the screen they were watching, there were reliable battle angels, but there was no sign of the Archangels anywhere.

Even a thorough search with divine vision yielded the same result.

It felt like having the rug pulled out from under them, believing in an axe that turned out to be a foot.

[Oh, is it possible that they haven't entered the battle yet?] [It seems summoning has already concluded. The 100,000 there are the entirety of our forces.] [There aren't any additional human mercenaries either.] [Those human mercenaries are not important! What matters is the fact that the core of our forces, the Archangels, is missing!] [It's not like they purposely chose not to participate, so what happened?] [Could it be that the Archangels were assassinated beforehand...?] [That's absurd. How could demons infiltrate the celestial realm?] [Daphne is correct. Isn't it a rule not to interfere with each other before a war?] [Then how could the demons kill the Archangels beforehand...?] [I don't know about that.]

It was unimaginable for the gods that they were killed not by demons but by humans.

[Regardless, the situation is not good. Without the Archangels, our chances of winning are slim.] [Indeed. On top of that, the opposition has 72 demon nobles in a numerical disadvantage.] [This war is a complete failure. It's a Celestial defeat.] [Ugh! Don't speak of defeat! I've wagered all my Terra on this match!] [Ugh, it wasn't because the odds were high...] [Ughhhh...]

Sighs echoed as the gods' expressions rapidly darkened.

Despite the evident power difference, they didn't know.

That the demons not only lacked a core force but also that the Celestials had a legion called the Black Scythe.

[There's nothing we can do. We can only hope the Goddess of Victory favors the Celestials.] [By the way, if there are no Archangels, who is leading?] [That's a good point... huh?]

One god looked at the screen with widened eyes.

It seemed that it was not a celestial commander but rather a single human giving orders in front of the Archangels.

[What's with that human? Is he insane?] [Is he bragging because there are no Archangels?] [What's with the random mercenary taking charge!]

They were outraged by the absurd situation, but what happened next was even more astonishing.

Upon the human's words, the battle angels cheered and, as if following orders, were flying behind him.

[What, what are they doing? Cheering for a human?] [Have they lost their minds as a group?]

As the war began with the sound of horns, the 100,000 battle angels, led by Ryumin, soared over the plain.

The sight of numerous angels flying in formation was truly spectacular.

For gods who had witnessed the Heavenly Wars many times, it was nothing surprising.

However, the gods couldn't help but watch in disbelief as a single human stood at the forefront, spreading his black wings like a general.

When Ryumin killed the 7 Archangels and obtained the title "Ruler of the Sky," he didn't know how to use it.

The description stated that he had become equal to an Archangel, but he didn't know where to apply it or how to utilize it.

"If Luvahy hadn't informed me, I might have never known."

If he hadn't heard about how to apply the title and command through it, the battle angels wouldn't be following him like chicks.

"I need to command them to quickly end the 7th Heavenly War and seize the Wishing Stone."

According to Luvahy, as soon as the demon count drops below 10%, the 7th Heavenly War will end, and the Wishing Stone will appear.

But what if, even for a brief moment, the Wishing Stone is exposed, and someone else touches it before him?

"The Wishing Stone recognizes that entity as the target of the wish and grants whatever they desire."

Mikael's method of using Ryumin to become a god was revealed here.

He planned to steal the Wishing Stone in passing to fulfill his own wish.

"He was plotting such a despicable plan. Anyway, Mikael, you're finished."

Now, with no hindrance from Mikael, he could seize the Wishing Stone by simply reducing the number of demons.

Then, he could proceed with the plan he and Luvahy had devised.

Coincidentally, demons were approaching from the opposite side, flapping their bat-like wings as they entered the range.

"Shall I loosen up a bit?"

The demons, who were approaching with fierce momentum, stopped abruptly when they saw Ryumin.

[Hmm? Hey, wait! Stop.] [W-what is that?] [It's the Demon King!]

Although the demons belatedly noticed Ryumin in mid-air, their fate was already sealed.

"Disappear."

Ryumin's scythe transformed into a massive form and sliced through the air.

Hundreds of demons turned into ashes in an instant.

"Accept your deaths quietly, everyone."

As Ryumin finished speaking, the angels and demons who had been approaching collided in the sky.

[Wow!] [Kill them!]

However, there was no resistance from the demon side.

A little while ago, he had issued an order through the power of the Demon King, making them unable to resist.

Puffaaah-

Puff-!

One-sided slaughter began.

Only the corpses of demons fell to the ground.

Ryumin also swung his giant scythe to reduce the forces.

It was incredibly easy to cut down enemies who offered no resistance.

"I need to reduce their numbers quickly before Chaos appears..."
ChatGPT

However, regardless of Ryumin's intentions, the sky opened up, and familiar eyes looked down at him.

[As expected. Did you think you could escape me?]

As anticipated, Chaos appeared.
