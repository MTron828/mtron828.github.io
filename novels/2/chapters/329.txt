Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 329"

Eternal Weapon

Click, click-

On the stage where the camera shutters were clicking, Ryu Min spoke to the audience with a heavy expression.

"What happened in round 20."

"Round 20 was a mission to defeat the final boss. Me and 72 other players were well-prepared and faced the boss, but..."

Ryu Min paused for a moment.

The image of a dying comrade came vividly to his mind.

"In the end, only I could survive."

"So, does that mean you can now fulfill your wish?"

A journalist unable to hold back the question shouted.

But Ryu Min shook his head.

"No, it doesn't. As it turns out, round 20 was not the final round. There is a final round called the Final Round, and it's said that you can fulfill your wish by conquering it."

"The Final Round?"

"There was one more round?"

The buzzing journalists quickly grabbed their laptops.

"When is this Final Round?"

In response to the journalist's question from a moment ago, Ryu Min spoke in a solemn voice.

"One month from now, on September 1st at midnight, the last round will begin."

[Among the 72 who entered round 20, only one survivor, the Black Scythe.] [The Black Scythe said, "Round 20 was not the end. There is a Final Round...."] [The last survivor, the Black Scythe, expresses condolences for the deaths of the 71 who fought against the boss....]

A situation where 71 people died, and only one survived.

Families of the deceased were filled with tears at this unexpected turn of events.

"Sob, Juriya... our daughter...."

Even before receiving the news through a news article, Min Dohoon had confirmed his daughter's death and shed endless tears.

Perhaps recalling the cheerful smile he had before entering the other world, his emotions became even more overwhelming.

"What happened. How could this happen? Leaving Dad alone and going first... How am I supposed to live now, sob."

Min Dohoon, who was crying so much that his throat became hoarse, quietly realized how surprised he was that he could cry so much.
ChatGPT

And to his surprise, he found himself relying on his daughter more than he had thought.

Exhausted and shedding tears, his next action was a denial of reality.

"Is this a lie? Is this all a dream? A convincingly crafted dream. I must have unknowingly fallen asleep and am now having a nightmare. Somehow, I had a feeling it would turn out like this."

As Min Dohoon muttered to himself, tears dropped from his eyes.

"Please tell me it's a dream. Wake me up as if nothing happened. Huh? I'm begging you like this... Oh God..."

Now pleading with God, he well understood that the dead do not come back.

There had been no cases of survival after the end of a round.

Then, unexpectedly, the sound of a doorbell rang.

Ding-dong, ding-dong.

For a moment, he stepped away from his sorrow and went to the front door.

Through the peephole, he saw a familiar face.

"Black... Scythe?"

"Hello, sir. Can I come in for a moment?"

Opening the door, Min Dohoon nodded and let Ryu Min in.

When the young man had won the lottery at his convenience store, he had only known him as a fortunate youth, but now he knew.

He knew his true identity as the Black Scythe.

He knew him as Min Juri's high school classmate.

"Have you heard the news?"

"...It was on the news."

"I'm sorry. I couldn't protect her..."

In response to Ryu Min's apology, Min Dohoon shook his head.

"There's no need to apologize. You probably did your best."

Of course.

After nodding, Ryu Min asked cautiously.

"...How is Juri?"

"She's in that room over there."

Pointing to the bed in the indicated room, Min Juri lay there.

As if peacefully asleep.

"Looks like she's sleeping... but she's not breathing."

"..."

"Is there any way to save her?"

Min Dohoon asked with hopeful eyes, but Ryu Min's response was sharp.

"It's impossible. After the soul transfer, she's already gone, and no matter what we try, we can't bring her back. Now, resurrection potions won't work since she's no longer a player."

Even if it wasn't him, others had already attempted to revive those eliminated from the rounds in reality.

However, bringing back a non-player entity with a potion of life was impossible.
ChatGPT

The resurrection skill didn't work either.

"As expected...?"

Though he asked already knowing the answer, it was as he expected.

Min Dohoon, who sighed deeply, asked quietly.

"How did our daughter go... Did she suffer?"

"No. There was no chance for that."

"That's somewhat of a relief..."

Strictly speaking, it wasn't instant death, but Ryu Min couldn't help but lie.

He knew better than anyone how agonizing the grief of losing a family member could be.

"Looking at her like this, it seems as if she's just peacefully sleeping. It's hard to believe she's gone..."

Ryu Min gently placed his hand on Min Dohoon's shoulders, who was locked in sorrow.

After a while, he removed his hand from the trembling shoulders and quietly turned away.

"I'm sorry, Dad. If I had known it would turn out like this, I would have done better... Sob."

Min Juri's father had more tears to shed.

He wasn't ready to let his daughter go.

"I shouldn't interfere."

Clank-

Opening the front door and leaving the house, Ryu Min let out a sigh.

His chest felt heavy.

He had come to console Juri's family, but witnessing someone else's sorrow was still distressing.

"But it's better to convey how her last moments were. Even if it's a pure white lie."

That was why Ryu Min had come to the families of the deceased.

71 people had died.

It was a significant number, but thanks to the runes of memory, Ryu Min could clearly remember who each of them was.

"Have you heard about Kristin?"

"I have."

At a glance, Nathan might seem unemotional, but Ryu Min understood.

He knew that Nathan was engulfed in the grief of losing his child.

"Jeffrey also passed away, right?"

"Yes."

"Both of them must have gone to a better place. So, don't worry anymore."

Nathan spoke as if making a pledge, but the swollen eyes revealed how much he had cried.

"But he doesn't say they've gone to heaven."

Reading the thoughts, Ryu Min understood.

His belief in God was already shattered.

It was only natural after the axe he believed in turned on him.

Confusion about what to believe in echoed in his mind.

Feeling it was time to leave, Ryu Min bowed his head.

"Well then, I'll be going."
ChatGPT

"Yeah. Thanks for coming like this."

For three days, Ryu Min traveled around the world, meeting the families of the deceased and personally delivering words of empty comfort while attending ongoing funerals.

"Sigh. Just hearing funeral music for three days, this is not something I can do."

But still, it had to be done.

At least for the sake of the fallen comrades.

"Brother, you're back?"

"Yeah."

Returning home, Ryu Min gave a brief greeting before heading into his room.

In the meantime, he could feel his younger brother's gaze looking at him reproachfully, but he paid it no mind.

He understood why he was being looked at like that.

"He probably feels guilty for surviving alone..."

Ryu Min wasn't as melancholy as one might expect.

Losing a comrade was undoubtedly a sad event, but moping around wouldn't help.

"I have to move forward somehow on my own."

And seek revenge.

To kill the god known as Chaos, he would do anything.

"Anger is better than sadness. At least it becomes the driving force towards a goal."

He wasn't sure how to exact revenge.

For now, he planned to kill more deity followers to achieve the Soul Bond quest.

"Azharoth is already dead, and I need to find and kill Moros, the so-called Night Goddess... Oh, I also need to find and kill that guy, Moloath."

If they collaborated with Chaos, he would hunt them all down.

He didn't know how to find them, but he would.

A sigh escaped him, but it wasn't all bad news.

"I've been so busy running around that I haven't had a chance to check until now."

Ryu Min had received items as rewards for the 20th round.

"Now, let's see what's in the special reward selection box."

With expectant eyes, he used the box.

[You can choose one of the following special rewards.] [Please touch the desired reward.]

└ 1. Stat Increase Buff (50%) - Limited to Final Round
└ 2. Temporary Skill - Invincibility - Limited to Final Round
└ 3. Temporary Skill - Sweep - Limited to Final Round

Upon closer inspection, the box didn't seem all that special.

"Well, having invincibility isn't too shabby, is it?"

If it was for the Final Round mission, he already knew.
ChatGPT

Standing on the side of the Celestials and leading the victory in the Celestial Demon War.

In such a situation, stat buffs and sweeping skills would undoubtedly be helpful, but Ryu Min couldn't ignore the possibility that Chaos might appear.

"Stats are meaningless in front of Chaos. I need a skill that can guarantee a fatal blow since I already have one."

Therefore, Ryu Min had only one option.

"Option 2, invincibility. Nothing could be more useful than this."

Choosing invincibility as a temporary skill once again, Ryu Min looked at his inventory.

There he saw the refined Aether he had received as a reward.

"Thanks to receiving one more this time, I now have two refined Aethers. Now, I can create the Eternal Weapon."

Although he already had the Flame Branch received as a commemoration of becoming a demon king, wouldn't it be nice to have one more weapon?

"I'll combine them right away."

Placing the materials on the combination window, he pressed the combine button.

[Combining an Eternal-grade item.] [It takes time to create a high-tier item. Please be patient.] [Combining materials...] [Analyzing the user's soul...] [Sync adjustment...] [Combination successful!] [You have created the 'Dark Reaper.' ] [Dark Reaper]

-Classification: Weapon

-Grade: Eternal

-Attack Power: 9,999

-Effect: Deals confirmed damage to entities of darkness.

-Durability: Infinite

-Usage Restriction: Black Scythe (Soul Bound)

-Description: A weapon that can kill gods.

Ryu Min, who was looking at the information, widened his eyes.

"This... for facing Chaos?"

If it had a dark attribute, the only entity that came to mind was Chaos.

Could it deal confirmed damage to Chaos?

"This is a completely tailor-made weapon!"

Of course, whether this weapon would work against Chaos or not couldn't be known until tested.

"But if it's true that Chaos has a dark attribute and confirmed damage, according to my assumption..."

It seemed promising.

He could potentially deliver significant blows to Chaos.

Feeling a glimmer of hope, Ryu Min chuckled.

"It was a good decision to create this weapon."

However, there was still a sense of regret.
ChatGPT

What if I had created this weapon sooner, leaving aside other Eternal equipment?

Wouldn't there have been different results?

"I'm looking forward to the day I meet Chaos."

With the thought that he could finally seek revenge, Ryu Min raised the corners of his mouth, but that didn't mean he would quietly wait for the Final Round.

Creak-

Ryu Min, who opened the door, informed his younger brother.

"Won-ah, I'll be away for a moment."

"Huh? Uh, where are you going?"

Smiling at his somewhat worried brother, Ryu Min spoke.

"To the Demon Realm."
