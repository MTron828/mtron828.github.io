Title: Regression 202 of Level Max Player

Second Sub Quest

[Hidden Sub Quest Available!]

└ Overcome the Trial without the Help of a Summoner

└ Upon Success ▶ Granting the Elixir of Immunity

[Sub Quest Completed!] [The Elixir of Immunity has been granted to the inventory.]

Party members who received the Sub Quest reward had bewildered expressions.

It was an unexpected message.

"Did, did Black Scythe-nim also receive it? The Sub Quest reward...."

"I received it."

Although an unknown potion was given as a reward, Ryumin knew its value.

[Elixir of Immunity]

Category: Consumable

Grade: Legendary

Effect: Immunity to all attributes for 1 minute

Usage Restriction: Master grade and above

Description: A potion that can perfectly resist all attribute damage. It tastes bitter when consumed.

There had been instances in the Tower of Trials where an indomitable resistance potion was obtained.

'It blocked 95% of resistance to the three major attributes.'

It was an item of higher compatibility that could cover a wider range of attributes and resist up to 100%.

Although the duration was short.

'It's a potion that can be a great help in emergencies. Especially when facing a strong opponent.'

Even with 95% resistance, if the opponent's attribute damage was at an unbearable level, one could die from just 5% damage.

'That's why potions that block 100% are much more valuable.'

The Elixir of Immunity was a potion not easily obtainable.

'Victor would probably have to reach level max to create it.'

It might not be needed now, but having it could be useful someday.

However, the reason why party members were stunned was not only because of the reward.

"The quest condition was to overcome the trial without the help of a summoner...."

It was a quest that could not be obtained if one did not follow Black Scythe.

"Did Black Scythe-nim know? That a Sub Quest would come out?"

"I'm not a prophet. How would I know that?"

"You really didn't know?"

"That's what I said."

Ryumin consistently responded to Minjuri's questions with a nonchalant attitude, but that didn't resolve Minjuri's doubts.

"Then how did you know about the traps and avoid them? They weren't visible at all except for the backs of the people in front of you..."

"It's intuition."

"Excuse me?"

"I just avoided them by intuition."

It was an vague answer, but Minjuri didn't press further and thought it best to leave it at that.

"Well, Black Scythe-nim has excellent insight, so..."

She speculated that he might have a type of rune that could see through traps.

"With this, I've completed all five trials."

"Not yet. One person hasn't come."

"Oh, you mean John Delga."

Observing Ryumin's expression, Minjuri hesitated before speaking.

"I overheard your conversation earlier, and it seemed like there's some tension between you two..."

"There was. It's none of your concern."

"Oh, I'm not prying into your personal matters. I just wanted to caution you because, based on that person's actions, it seems like you should be careful."

"A level 50 worrying about a level 90."

Ryumin smiled mischievously at Minjuri.

"Thanks for the advice. I'll be cautious."

"Oh, no. I shouldn't give advice on your affairs. It was an unnecessary meddling on my part. I'm sure Black Scythe-nim won't be in any danger..."

"I'm a person too, and I could be in danger. Just the concern itself is appreciated."

"Yes..."

Having heard the words of gratitude twice, Minjuri seemed to feel shy.

"By the way, when do you think John Delga will come? Is he on his way? What if he doesn't come? He might be plotting revenge against us."

"Don't worry about that. He'll definitely come."

Despite these assurances, Minjuri couldn't help but anxiously gaze at the teleportation passage.

As all party members had to arrive for the strategy, it was a matter of concern until everyone was present.

"What the... what's going on?"

John Delga stared at the darkness of the teleportation passage with a bewildered look.

"He really left? Ignoring my proposal?"

Black Scythe, the summoner himself, not only ignored his words but walked straight into the darkness with his party members.

"Is he really throwing his life away just because of his pride?"
ChatGPT

Honestly, whether that guy is dead or alive, I can't tell.

Just to be sure, I tried using the tracking skill, but it was unresponsive.

It seems that nothing works except the summoning skill.

"He must be dead. Yeah, he's probably dead."

John was convinced.

He hadn't taken more than a few steps before disappearing with his party.

Even if it's Black Scythe, he wouldn't be able to see through the darkness, right?

"Damn idiots. To die so pathetically just because I happened to meet a bad leader."

Having firmly concluded that he was dead, John summoned one of his creatures.

"I have to survive too."

With the summoned creature at the forefront, he pierced through the darkness.

He fell into traps along the way, leading to the demise of his summoned creatures, but he promptly summoned another to find his way again.

For ten minutes, he consumed his summoned creatures, navigating through the traps.

"There's light over there; it looks like the end."

Finally, John, reaching the end of the passage, stepped on the ground with a smile.

That's when it happened.

"Now you're here? It took you long enough."

John's face froze rapidly, as if he had seen a ghost.

Black Scythe was alive.

"H-How...?"

"How did I survive? Well, I avoided the traps and crossed, so I'm alive."

"..."

And it wasn't just Black Scythe.

The other party members also looked at him with intact bodies.

But it was a different kind of gaze than before.

"Damn it. My image is ruined."

There was no reason to be seen that way, but there was no reason to receive such a critical gaze either.

He wanted to shout out to fix his appearance, but that wasn't the problem.

The real problem was Black Scythe right in front of him.

"What did you say to me earlier? Pay me 10 million points, kneel, and apologize?"

"Uh, well, that... that was..."

"Let's discuss it after leaving this place. It seems like we need a face-to-face conversation, considering the situation."

Realizing the implications of those words, John scratched his head.

"Damn it, screwed up."

John regretted bullying others without thinking about the consequences.

"Could Black Scythe have crossed on his own...?"

He never thought it would turn out like this.

"Damn lucky bastard."

He complained internally, but John didn't know.
ChatGPT

Now was not the time to criticize someone else's luck.

[As a summoner, you have arrived last in the fifth trial.] [A penalty is applied to you for not considering your party members.] [All your stats permanently decrease by 50%.] [The stats of your summoned creatures also permanently decrease by 50%.]

"What is this, damn it?"

Upon seeing the message, curses involuntarily slipped out of his mouth.

A permanent 50% decrease in all stats? And not just for himself, but also for his summoned creatures?

It was absurd.

When unexpected situations unfolded one after another, he was left speechless.

"Why? What's going on?"

Black Scythe asked nonchalantly, but there was no energy to respond.

His mind was simply numbed by despair and frustration.

'His mental state is completely gone.'

Ryumin, who had silently chuckled at the success of his secretly planned operation, took his eyes off John Delga.

Now, John Delga posed no threat at all.

His stats had dropped to a level lower than level 30.

'But I can't just leave him be.'

He had used everything he could use, so it wouldn't matter if he killed him.

No, it might be better to cleanly deal with him, considering potential repercussions.

'For now, let's assess the situation with Messiah.'

Since there was no need to make an immediate decision, he decided to spare his life for the time being.

[You have successfully completed the fifth trial.] [The team's strategy time is 00:15:49.] [Congratulations! You have passed all the trials!] [Experience points rewards based on the records of each trial will be given shortly.] [Calculating experience points. Please wait a moment.]

Finally, experience points were distributed to the party members.

The party members, who weren't expecting much, were surprised as they saw their levels shoot up by 10 to 12 levels at once.

"Wow, Black Scythe-nim! I've become a Master grade!"

"I guess I reached level 60."

"Me too! I finally became a Master."

"I learned a new skill!"

Minjuri, Jeffrey, and Jusungtak checked their skill windows with excited faces.

All of them reached nearly level 60 and became Master grades.

Reading their thoughts, John Delga wasn't an exception.

'Did I only go up by one level?'
ChatGPT

Seeing that he had reached level 91, a sarcastic smile crossed his face.

Well, it didn't really matter.

After all, he could easily hit the max level with points.

He was just not intentionally raising it.

"Minju. What skill did you learn?"

"It's a skill called [Buff Zone]. Should I give it a try?"

Ryumin nodded, and before Minjuri cast the buff, she applied the three-set buffs again.

[With the effect of the Bless skill, all stats increase by 80%.] [With the effect of the Swift skill, attack speed and movement speed increase by 80%.] [The Safety Barrier skill has been cast.] [You can receive protection twice from physical attacks.]

With the increase in grade, the buffs were enhanced compared to before.

"Now, I'll use the Buff Zone."

As Minjuri cast the skill, a yellow magic circle spread beneath her feet.

It was an area-of-effect skill that covered a radius of 30 meters.

"What's the effect?"

"While within the range, it enhances the effects of the buffs I applied by one level. It also resets the duration."

Upon checking, the stat increase from Bless had indeed gone up.

'It increased to 100%?'

Swift was also at 100%, and the Safety Barrier protected three times.

'In other words, the buffs are strengthened as if it were when hitting the max level?'

Then what would happen if she cast Buff Zone when reaching max level?

Would it exceed 100% and perhaps reach 120%?

'An incredible skill.'

Suddenly, Ryumin felt anticipation for what skill Minjuri would learn when she hit max level.

He hadn't kept her alive until now, so he didn't know.

'This round will go until the end.'

Ryumin, who had been smiling satisfactorily, momentarily turned serious.

In the 60m detection range, there was a reaction from a life form.

'Who is it?'

There shouldn't be someone suddenly appearing at the end of the trial.

Except for the angel guide.

'No, angels don't come here either. They just wait in the colorless waiting area.'

The tension that had eased suddenly tightened again.

Staring sternly in one direction, Minjuri asked, "Why are you like that, Black Scythe-nim?"

"Look over there."

In the darkness that Ryumin was gazing into, a figure of a person appeared.

"An angel?"
ChatGPT

The presence that the party members saw was none other than an angel.

Moreover, it had over ten wings, and its length could be dozens of meters.

"..."

"..."

The party members remained silent, exchanging glances.

They realized that this was different from the typical guiding angel.

Even John, who had been dazed, couldn't help but snap out of it at the appearance of the angel.

Ryumin, upon seeing the figure, immediately recognized its identity.

'A Greater Angel has appeared?'

Reading his thoughts, she even knew the name.

The angel was Sarie, the 6th-ranked Greater Angel.

"You are Black Scythe."

Sarie produced a melody from between her wings, her voice low.

"If you don't want to die, don't resist. It's an order to quietly come with me."
