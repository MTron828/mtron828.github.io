Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player - Episode 345"

Episode 345: The 101st Round (9)

Chaos was startled.

He never expected that the spear he threw would come back.

Though taken aback, he quickly composed himself and skillfully avoided the attack by manipulating space through various paths.

Even if it was a guided attack, once it entered his manipulated space, it was rendered useless.

However, the impact he took once was not easily forgotten.

"How on earth did this human survive? Doesn't he use Terra in the human category? Doesn't he reflect attacks?"

When designing the system, he hadn't considered abilities he hadn't seen.

He generally entrusted everything to Gaia and didn't scrutinize it closely.

"That negligence has become a weapon threatening me and has come back to haunt me."

The monster raised by Gaia has turned into a god and is now a threat to him.

"I must kill it at all costs. Absolutely!"

Until a little while ago, he was sweating to avoid attacks using Terra, but not anymore.

"Die right here."

Even if he had to go, he was determined to create a spear of instant death and throw it.

However, Ryumin used only one skill without dodging.

"Temporary skill, invincibility."

As the radiant golden light deflected the spear, Chaos could only look surprised.

Not because it wasn't effective, but because he found himself in a situation where he had to wait for a whole minute with nothing to do.

Watching Chaos, who was taken aback, Ryumin inwardly mocked him.

"It must sting a bit. Since all players, including me, are under invincibility."

Now that the helpless one can do only one thing.

Throw the spear of instant death when the invincibility ends.

Previously, unfortunately, on that last strike, Minjuri, Kristin, and Sophia had died.

"Not anymore."

Because there is a countermeasure now.

[Remaining Invincibility Time: 00:00:05]

As Ryumin's invincibility time approached 5 seconds, the invincibility of his earlier teammates expired.

At that precise moment, Chaos joyfully unleashed the spear of instant death he had kept ready.

"Everyone, disappear and die!"

"Now, Kristin!"

Responding to Ryumin's voice, Kristin used her skill.

Total Invincibility, Protect Cell.

The time under invincibility was only 5 seconds, but it was not enough to protect all allies.

Tingtingtingtingting-!

Chaos, witnessing even the last strike being blocked, became enraged, but he couldn't linger any longer and disappeared.

The system had expelled him as an outsider.

[Round 20 has ended.] [Calculating results.]

"I'm alive!"

"Everyone survived!"

"I never thought a termination message could be this welcoming!"

Everyone shouted in joy.

Ryumin also smiled broadly as if joining the celebration.

"Not a single person died."

[97 players have achieved Round 20.] [Congratulations. You are now qualified to challenge the final round and fulfill your wishes with the 'Wishing Stone' upon completing the mission of the final round.]

Unlike before when he was the only one left, this was a triumph of everyone surviving.

Ryumin and the other 97 players survived, but there was no time for celebration.

The final round awaited them.

"I'm sure Chaos will appear again this time without fail."

He wasn't the type to give up like this.

Sharpening the blades of revenge, they eagerly awaited the seemingly inevitable final round.

"Everyone has probably experienced it, but Chaos is considered the strongest among the gods. Even for me, with a level exceeding 600, he's a formidable opponent. Perhaps the final round might become our tomb."

The followers of the God of Death couldn't hide their anxious expressions at Ryumin's speech.

"I'm not saying this to scare you. It's just a reminder to stay alert because the opponent is tough. However, there's no need to worry. There's nothing to fear from an opponent we've already faced."

With a sly smile, Ryumin got to the point.

"Now, I'll tell you the strategy for the final round against Chaos."

"Yes!"

The 96 players
ChatGPT

Only 96 mercenaries were added, but the value of a max-level player surpasses that of an ordinary battle angel.

"While their physical abilities may be no more than those of ordinary battle angels, players have skills."

Originally designed to act as variables in the war, players are a noteworthy presence on the angelic side.

Despite angels harboring contempt for humans.

"Listen, everyone."

Ryumin, now elevated to Archangel, captured the attention of both angels and players with his words.

"Our goal is to end the war as quickly as possible. When the battle begins, eliminate the enemy as quickly as possible. We have

Seemingly belated, Chaos let out a painful scream.

Simultaneously, the fatal spears that had been thrust forward withdrew, hiding like turtles in their shells.

"Darn it, Gaia's plaything again!"

As if determined not to be mere prey, Chaos, even in the midst of phase shift, summoned the spear of instant death that could be used during the transformation.

Ninety-seven red spears adorned the sky.

Originally intended to eliminate players in one go, Ryumin had no intention of being on the receiving end.

"Kristin!"

"Yes!"

Just as the spears were released, the Protect Cell was activated.

The golden light surrounding the players repelled the spears.

"Ignore invincibility and focus on the battle!"

As if they already knew, players relentlessly reduced the number of demons.

They understood that whether attacks came or not, ending the round as quickly as possible was the shortcut to survival.

"These bastards...!"

Having blocked a single attack with invincibility, the problem was what came next.

"Do you think you can claim the Wishing Stone!"

Creating the spear of instant death once again, Ryumin shouted, "Gather!"

Following the command, players moved as one.

"Die!"

Chaos's second spear of instant death charged towards the players.

However, according to the prearranged plan, players had already hidden behind the summoned creature's wall.

"Resonance's Echo!"

At Searin's cry, invincibility was cast on all summoned creatures.

Along with it, the spears that were targeting the players were blocked by the summoned creatures.

By making the summoned creatures invincible, they managed to block the second spear as well.

"How long can you keep blocking... Aaargh!"

Without saying more, Chaos screamed.

It was because he had been hit by the reflected spear of instant death through the Rune of Knight Resurrection.

Ryumin watched the scene with a disappointed expression.

"Looks like it only grazed him, he didn't die."

Well, it wouldn't be so careless as to die from its own attack.

"How about it, Chaos? Evading my attacks, avoiding reflected damage, creating the spear of instant death—feels chaotic, doesn't it?"

[Iiiiiiik!]

Ryumin continued to deplete Chaos by using Terra for attacks.

The optimal strategy was to kill Chaos right here, so Ryumin did his best.

However.

"Ugh, already running out of Terra?"

The statement that 100 billion Terra was needed was not an exaggeration; his strength was exhausted.

Realizing that he could no longer torment Chaos, Ryumin shifted his focus to the ground.

Given the circumstances, giving up on killing Chaos and swiftly seizing the Wishing Stone was the only option.

"Do you think you can do that!"

The third spear of instant death targeted the 97 humans.

Now, there was truly no way to block it.

If the party members were as they used to be.

"Makyeongrok! Now!"

At Ryumin's command, Makyeongrok used the max-level skill [Space Leap].

Dark aura emitted from Makyeongrok's body enveloped himself and all party members.

Even Ryumin.

Swoosh—

As their bodies turned translucent, the spear of instant death passed through and struck the ground.

Thud!

No one in the center suffered any damage.

They simply observed the situation as if turned into ghosts.

"Space Leap is an evasion skill that sends all party members to a dimensional rift. There's no better skill to avoid his attacks."

In a way, it was a skill similar to Chaos's phase shift.

The difference was that the duration was 5 minutes, and in this state, they couldn't attack or move.

Of course, they could exit the rift if they wished.

Like this.

Swoosh—

Having returned from the dimensional space, Ryumin, regaining his original color, moved alone.

"As long as Space Leap is not released, my comrades are safe for 5 minutes. In the meantime, I..."

Ryumin's eyes gleamed ominously.

"I'll sweep away the demons."

Swoosh— Swoosh—

Even though Ryumin was the only one involved in the war, the number of demons dwindled geometrically.

Unable to tolerate the sight, Chaos shouted in anger.

"You rat! Just disappear already!"

One spear of instant death targeted Ryumin.

However, without looking back, Ryumin used a saved skill.

[Temporary skill 'Invincibility' is activated.] [Immune to all damage for 60 seconds.] [You have used a one-time-use skill.] [The skill disappears from the skill window.]

Ping!
ChatGPT

Seeing the spear of instant death bounce off without any force, Chaos wore a bewildered expression.

"Invincibility again?"

"Now, it's my time for the next minute."

Smirking, Ryumin's eyes glowed red.

Then, pulling back his scythe, he gathered energy.

"I'll send it with Terra this time."

Pouring the remaining Terra into the scythe, a combo of Red Moon and Moonlight Island swept through the demons.

Kwakwakwakwakwa-boom!

Kwukwakwakwakwa-boom!

Kwakwakwakwakwa-boom!

With an expanded range compared to before, tens of thousands of demons fell.

Chaos could only stare dumbfounded at the sight.

Until the number of demons dropped below 10%.

[Demonic forces have decreased to less than 10%.] [The 7th Celestial War concludes with a victory for the Celestial faction.]

With the ominous appearance of the message, the 97 players were greeted by a gleaming light.

Wishing Stones in various colors appeared before each of them.
