Title: Episode 176 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Those Chasing the Black Scythe

After the start of Round 11, Ma Kyung-rok looked around.

With a more bewildered expression than usual.

"Darn it, we're all scattered, aren't we?"

Despite being a team battle, they dispersed like it was a solo match.

It was an unexpected situation that even the prophet had not foreseen, making it even more confusing.

"What happened? Did the prophet forget to mention it? Or maybe..."

Ma Kyung-rok shook his head.

Perhaps the prophet intentionally omitted some information.

There would be no benefit to doing so.

"They probably didn't know we would scatter."

Even a seemingly perfect prophet occasionally overlooks important information.

"Darn, there's no way to find Kristin like this."

Ma Kyung-rok had intended to protect his fianc√©e, Kristin.

Even if it meant pretending to seek help, so as not to be caught easily.

"To be honest, I don't really love her. How could I develop such feelings for a foreigner in just a few months?"

An engaged woman with nothing but a facade.

However, he did not wish any harm to come to her.

After all, no businessman wishes for their business relationships to break.

"I wanted to protect her... but now I can't even track her."

Though her nickname is Chrissy, he had never met her in the other world and didn't know her face.

This made it impossible to track her without the necessary conditions.

"I have to accumulate points through quests, but how can I help Kristin? There seems to be no way."

The only thing he could do was focus on accumulating points to keep the team alive.

"No need to worry. Didn't the prophet say? A savior who will rescue Kristin will appear."

As long as it happens as predicted by the prophecy, it means he won't die, so there's no need for him to take action.

Even though he wanted to step up, he couldn't.

"Let's concentrate on accumulating points. Where should I go for the quest?"

Conveniently, there was a well-paved road in front of him that seemed suitable for a carriage.

At the end of that road, a large city with fortified walls came into view.

"Is this a kingdom? There should be a lot of quests there."

As Ma Kyung-rok walked, he suddenly had this thought.

"What if I encounter other players while wandering around?"

If they were Korean players, they would probably greet each other with a smile, but what about players from other countries?

"There's nothing good about teaming up with players from other countries according to the rules."

They live in different places and aren't even on the same team. They can't share points and communication is impossible. They are just competitors that need to be eliminated.

"If you kill other players, you get points, right? A lot of them, too."

In that sense, players from other countries were good prey to kill.

They were like walking points.

"If I don't kill them, they'll try to kill me first. I'm probably not the only one thinking this way."

With this thought in mind, Ma Kyung-rok made a decision.

He would observe the situation when encountering players from other countries and then decide whether to kill them.

It was an unavoidable action for survival.

"Wait. Maybe instead of doing quests, it's better to find and kill players from other countries to accumulate points?"

If done well, he might even become the top-ranked player and become a zone representative.

"No, becoming a zone representative is not good. You'll just get killed by the Black Scythe right away."

High-level players are not subject to the authority of zone representatives, so even if he became one, the Black Scythe would still be unstoppable.

"For now, aiming for the second place in the rankings is the best. Anyway, the first place will be the Black Scythe."

He decided to try completing a sub-quest first and then think about which method would be better for accumulating points, whether killing players or completing quests.

"Let's see if there's anyone around first."

He used the exploration skill to check for red dots in the vicinity.

"Huh? Behind me... there's someone?"

Seeing a red dot approaching from behind, Ma Kyung-rok drew his sword and turned around.

"What the... Oh, Chief Ahn?"

"Representative!"

Approaching happily like a dog meeting its owner was none other than Ahn Sang-cheol.

"What happened? Chief Ahn. Did you come after me?"
ChatGPT

"Of course. As soon as I landed in a strange place, I decided to track down Representative-nim first. Since we're on the same team, wouldn't it be better to move together?"

Ma Kyung-rok nodded.

It was already awkward to walk alone, and having his right-hand man by his side made him feel more secure.

"Shall we go on a quest together?"

"Yes, Representative-nim. But..."

"...?"

"If possible, wouldn't it be better to move with the help of a buffer?"

"Buffer? Is that a democratic term?"

"Yes. It always feels empty and somehow like a loss when I'm not receiving buffs by your side."

That made sense.

With just one buff, the stats increased by 70%, making a significant difference between receiving it and not. The current situation, where he wasn't receiving it, even felt like being under a debuff.

"Well, that makes sense. With the Bless buff, we'll be fine for three hours."

"Then let's track down Democracy."

As Ahn Sang-cheol was about to use the tracking skill, Ma Kyung-rok stopped him.

"No, let's go to the Black Scythe instead of Democracy."

"What? The Black Scythe?"

"Democracy will undoubtedly try to move with the Black Scythe. If we, who aren't close to Democracy, approach, it will only create unnecessary suspicion. It's better to stick with the relatively friendly Black Scythe. Naturally, we'll receive Democracy's buff, and we can see how he accumulates points."

"Well, the Black Scythe has consistently maintained exceptional performance in any round. I'll follow Representative-nim's advice."

The two of them laughed and changed their direction.

The target they were tracking was none other than the Black Scythe.

At the same time.

In different countries, many people shared Ma Kyung-rok's thoughts.

"Angels definitely said that, right? Killing other players earns you points."

"That's right."

Chinese player [Siez Kong] smiled with a wicked grin.

While ordinary people might hesitate about murder, he was different.

Having risen to a high position in the underworld at his late twenties with exceptional talent, killing was an easy task for him.

"Earning points is ridiculously easy. Can't we just catch and kill anyone we see?"

"Yes, sir. However, we shouldn't kill Chinese players."

"Do I look like I don't know that, you idiot? Ah, damn!"

As he took a threatening stance, his subordinate immediately apologized.
ChatGPT

"I spoke out of turn. I apologize."

Even though he was a subordinate who engaged in dirty work in the other world, there was no dissatisfaction.

Siez Kong acknowledged his skills in killing people.

"If you don't want to die today, listen to me carefully. You should survive until the end, take a high-ranking position, and live through it all. Tsk!"

"I apologize!"

"We will trust and follow only Siez Kong-nim!"

As the nine subordinates bowed their heads, Siez Kong expressed a satisfied smile.

"I mean, just listen to what I say. I'll keep everyone alive."

In the future, the world would be dominated by players.

Ordinary people would become slaves, and only the players who survived until the end would rule as kings.

"The Black Society is no exception. As long as you endure the rounds, you can easily shake off your competitors."

Currently, the players controlled the Black Society.

The middle-aged ordinary executives had already been eliminated and replaced a long time ago.

The players who now held real power were naturally in their twenties, and he, too, was one of them, quickly rising to a high-ranking position with recognized skills.

"It's not the strong ones who devour the Black Society. It's those who endure the rounds and eventually reach the top."

Siez Kong also had a dream of reaching a higher position.

For that dream, he could kill players from other countries without hesitation.

Killing people was his specialty as a berserker class.

"From now on, we will hunt players from other countries. Think of them as monsters. The moment you see them, kill them without any mercy. That's the way for us to survive."

"But, Siez Kong-nim, how do we differentiate players from other countries? We can't see their nicknames, and their appearance is likely customized."

"You fool. You can figure that out by talking to them. Since we won't understand each other's language."

"Oh, I see."

"Now that you understand, let's move. Turn on the surrounding exploration skill, find everyone in sight, and kill them all."

"Got it, Siez Kong-nim."

With laughter and his subordinates in tow, Siez Kong immediately put his plan into action.

Two red dots appeared nearby.

"Let's go!"

Drawing his sword, as he ran towards them, the distance quickly closed.
ChatGPT

Judging by appearances, it seemed to be a Western player.

"What the?"

Although a Westerner who had detected their approach through footsteps, it was already too late.

"Hey, are you guys Chinese?"

"What..."

"I knew it wasn't. Damn foreigners."

Without hesitation, Siez Kong activated a skill.

"Crimson Grasp."

Suddenly, a giant hand with a red light emerged from the air, grabbing one of the Westerners.

In an instant, a crimson blade fell from above onto the head of the Westerner, who had been pulled in close.

Thunk!

"Ho, Holy sh*t!!!"

Upon seeing his comrade fall, the startled Westerner swung his sword without looking back.

Or at least, that's what he intended.

Until Siez Kong's subordinates got to him.

Thunk, thunk, thunk!

"Gahhh...."

Looking at the dead Westerner like a ragdoll, Siez Kong asked his subordinates.

"Who delivered the final blow?"

"I think it was me."

"How many points did we get?"

"We got 290 points."

"Really? I have 350 points. Odd."

Regardless of high or low, why did people get different points?

With the corpse in front of him, Siez Kong got lost in thought.

The conclusion he came to was one.

"Could it be that points vary based on level?"

If the level is low, fewer points, and if it's high, more points?

"Then, the higher the level, the more points you get?"

Suddenly, someone came to mind.

The player who held an overwhelming level, the former Zone Rank 1, the Black Scythe.

"His level was 90, right?"

If he could somehow kill the Black Scythe, he might be able to monopolize an unimaginable number of points.

"That guy is a Korean player, well-known fact. If I manage to kill him, I might skyrocket to Rank 1 in an instant. Becoming a Zone Representative would be a bonus."

A wicked smile crept up on his face, but the problem was how to kill him.

As Siez Kong pondered, his gaze subtly shifted toward his subordinates.

"Wouldn't sacrificing these subordinates somehow work? Moreover, I can speak a bit of Korean."

If he pretended to be a Korean and approached, using his subordinates as shields, could he deal a fatal blow?
ChatGPT

It might surprisingly be possible.

"For now, I should keep this a secret from my subordinates. There might be some idiots who get scared just hearing the name Black Scythe."

At that moment, a subordinate brought in an Asian person.

"Siez Kong-nim! We caught the guy who was trying to escape nearby. Please kill him yourself to accumulate points."

"Why, why are you doing this? I have no intention of fighting. I was just passing by!"

"Wait."

Siez Kong listened to the guy's words and narrowed his eyes.

"Are you Korean?"

"Yes? Uh, yes, I can speak Korean?"

"A little."

"Haha, that's fortunate. Please ask these people to let me go. I beg you..."

"Before that, let me ask you one thing. Have you seen the Black Scythe?"

"Black Scythe? Yes, I have. We were in the same zone."

"Is that so?"

Siez Kong, with a sly smile, thrust a knife into the Korean's neck.

"Argh!"

"Do you have the tracking skill, yes or no?"

"Yes, yes, I do!"

"Then guide me to the Black Scythe right now. If you don't want to die."
