Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 230"

Episode 230: Sniper

"Thank you for including me in the role of the Messiah. However, let me say...."

At the location where the Black Scythe was awaited, doubt suddenly crept in.

"Will the Black Scythe really come? All the way to this distant land in the United States?"

"It will come. Whether with good intentions or bad. If it's with bad intentions, the danger will be significant."

"What do you mean? Are they coming to kill us if their intentions are malicious?"

In response to the subordinate's question, Yang Chuwen did not deny.

"Yeah, they might come to kill us. The one who killed the other 12 apostles won't leave us alone."

"Then shouldn't we not be here? We should avoid it right now..."

"Jang So-wi."

The look in Yang Chuwen's eyes as he looked at his subordinate became cold.

"What are you doing, acting unbecomingly? Now you're worried about your life?"

"No, it's not that. Isn't the opponent an opponent? Rather than dying meaninglessly, it's better to..."

"Hey, why is it meaningless? Didn't you hear the plan? Just the fact that the Black Scythe is coming here is already half the success. It's an opportunity to crack open their skull."

"Is that so...?"

"So you don't have to worry. Just stand here with us to divert attention. It's for Dark Soul to snipe effectively."

"Understood, boss."

Yang Chuwen patted his shoulder and extended his hand to Spaniard.

"Give me the radio."

"Here it is."

Click-

Yang Chuwen turned on the radio and began the voice test.

"Can you hear me well? Dark Soul?"

-Yes, I can hear you.

"Can you see us?"

-I can see you in detail, down to the nostrils.

"Don't make any dirty sounds and snipe well. If you miss once, there won't be another chance."

-Don't worry. If the opponent stays still, I won't miss.

"Yeah. The Black Scythe will definitely attract attention, so be careful with your shots."

-Don't worry.

Taking his hand off the radio, Yang Chuwen still had an unsatisfied expression.

"It's annoying that our fate is in the hands of those bastards."

"What did you say?"
ChatGPT

"It's nothing."

Muttering in Chinese, he handed the radio back to Spaniard and checked the time.

There were 10 minutes left until the appointed time.

"Will they really come?"

He boasted to his colleagues, but in reality, there was no guarantee that the Black Scythe would show up.

"If it were me, I wouldn't go considering the likelihood of a trap."

But since the opponent was the Black Scythe, there was also a thought that they might come precisely because it was expected to be a trap.

With confidence in his skills to the point of snorting at traps.

Always at the top, his pride was strong.

"Considering how he dealt with the 12 apostles, he doesn't seem like the type to leave any loose ends. The possibility of him coming is greater. So, don't let your guard down."

Yang Chuwen turned to his colleagues with a more serious expression than ever.

"I'll say this without mercy. If the Black Scythe appears, don't be afraid and look straight at him. If you turn your gaze for no reason, the Black Scythe is likely to turn his head along with it."

"Are you saying to attract attention as much as possible for a good sniper shot?"

"That's right. Spaniard, focus attention with the declaration that you'll surrender first. Express a sincere desire to join under the Black Scythe. If necessary, all three of you should kneel down to create a chance when he lets his guard down. Got it?"

"Yes."

"Understood."

"Good. Now let's brace ourselves and wait. Today might be the last day of our lives."

Gulp-

While swallowing saliva, they waited in tension.

At that moment, the three people's gazes focused on one place.

Step by stepâ€”

A figure with a large scythe in a white mask was approaching.

The first emotion Dark Soul felt when he obtained the profession of a sniper was joy.

It was a familiar job to him, as he was already an enthusiast of FPS games.

"Indeed, being a sniper suits me. There's nothing like the satisfaction of taking down enemies with a single shot."

However, the reality was, to put it bluntly, a dead-end.

At the age of 26, he spent his time at home playing games, without seeking a job.

That was Dark Soul's true identity.

Therefore, those around him did not view him favorably.

Not his family, not his friends, not even the societal gaze.

"Why do they wear colored glasses when gaming is more beneficial than smoking?"
ChatGPT

"Study, that's right. So you can eat and live. Get a job, you loser."

Even though he wasn't causing harm to others, people liked to meddle in his life.

"It's my life, why interfere and make a fuss about it?"

After all, life is lived only once.

Dark Soul's philosophy was to enjoy life fully and intensely rather than living a thin and long life.

Despite being constantly pointed out not to rationalize his actions by those around him.

"Why strive so hard in life? With my grades at the bottom, my life is already ruined. Isn't it better to live as I please?"

Enduring all kinds of hardships and efforts to catch up with a lifetime of silver spoons, was it really worth it?

Dark Soul didn't want to live greedily with a below-average salary.

He believed that reducing the time spent on effort and enjoying life was a better cost-benefit ratio.

"In today's world, only fools become fools by striving. Look, I wished for failure, and look, I actually ended up a failure."

Ultimately, the world turned out as Dark Soul had thought.

Instead of receiving rewards for his efforts, 1.8 billion people ended up living a countdown to their lives.

Surprisingly, Dark Soul had survived well until now, whether he had talent or not, his current thoughts were different.

"It's not talent. I was just lucky. If I make a mistake, that luck might not last until today."

If he were to get hit by a bullet or fail to assassinate the Black Scythe.

Dark Soul's life might come to an end here as well.

"Will I get hit? I'm ranked 1st in the Japanese rankings. How many skulls have I shattered so far?"

The sniper profession didn't require the careful assembly of guns, estimating wind direction and distance, or shooting carefully, as portrayed in movies.

Just take out the sniper rifle from the inventory, find a spot, lie down, and that's it.

After all, the [Sniper Rune] he possessed increased the accuracy.

Especially, if he shot from a lying down position instead of a kneeling position, the accuracy tripled.

There was no need to measure things like wind direction or bullet speed, as in reality.

"As long as I know how to hit the opponent in the crosshair like in FPS games, there's no problem."

Of course, there was a definite effective range for the gun, so distance had to be considered.

In other words, if you only focused on the effective range, even those unfamiliar with sniping could hit the target.
ChatGPT

"As long as I'm shooting from a lying position, there's no chance of getting hit. Once it's in the crosshair, I can shoot and kill right away."

After enhancing the bullet damage with the [Sniper] skill, ignoring defense with the [Penetration] skill, and adding the [One Shot, One Kill] buff?

It didn't matter who it was; he could put a hole in their head.

"Come on, show yourself once. You, Jocensing. I'll kill you with one shot."

There was no fear of retaliation.

He was aiming from the maximum range of the sniper rifle he currently possessed, which was 1 km.

If he appeared at the agreed-upon location, he would be killed on the spot.

With confidence, he peered through the scope when suddenly - a click, a transmission came through the radio.

The voice wasn't audible.

But it was certain that it was a signal sent by Spaniard.

They had agreed to transmit a silent radio signal upon witnessing the Black Scythe.

"He's here, he came. Where is he?"

Looking through the scope, there it was.

The figure of a villain wearing a white mask was approaching.

"It's the Black Scythe."

He hadn't actually met him, but he could instinctively tell that it was the Black Scythe.

Just by looking, he had an unusual scythe and wore the same mask seen in the media.

Dark Soul, swallowing dry saliva, focused his attention on the movement of the Black Scythe through the scope.

"He's entered the range as planned. If he stops, shoot and kill him immediately."

Buff skills were already activated.

Unlike real sniper rifles, as long as the crosshair was aligned and the trigger was pulled, a recoil-free bullet was fired.

In that case, like cutting a hundred dolls with a single slash, the head would twist and fall.

There was no exception for the Black Scythe.

He was also human.

"Whew, take a deep breath. This one shot will decide everything."

Just as he was waiting for the Black Scythe to stop.

Thud-

The Black Scythe finally stopped walking.

"Now!"

Pew-!

Seizing the opportunity, his fingers moved without hesitation.

His reaction speed was so fast that even he admired it.

With a blink of an eye, the Black Scythe, caught in the crosshair, was seen collapsing with brains splattering.

"I... I killed him! Dark Soul shouted with exhilaration.

"I killed the Black Scythe. Hahaha! I killed him! I did it!"

Even when he magnified the scope again, it was the same.
ChatGPT

A puddle of blood was forming around the head of the Black Scythe, which was embedded in the ground.

Observing the fallen Black Scythe, the three disciples were smiling.

The pride of bending the neck of the enemy leader, like a victorious general, surged through them. However, suddenly, an odd thought crossed Dark Soul's mind.

"Come to think of it, why isn't the message popping up? Now that I've killed him, shouldn't I be the zone representative?"

In reality, can one take away the position of a representative just by killing them?

He felt puzzled, but what was certain was that he had killed the famous Black Scythe.

"It's good anyway. Jocensing getting 1st place in the entire zone was annoying. Haha, well done."

He was chuckling, but only for a moment.

"I found him."

Startled by the voice coming from behind, Dark Soul had no choice but to stiffen his face.

Not because the recently killed Black Scythe was standing there unharmed.

"How... How are you alive?"

"How am I alive? Well, it's because I'm not the one who died."

Then it happened.

Click-

Just in time, an urgent voice came through the radio.

What happened? Dark Soul! The guy's corpse suddenly disappeared! I clearly saw him spraying blood and dying right in front of me, but he disappeared like he was possessed by a ghost! Huh? What are you saying! Why isn't there any response...?

Dark Soul couldn't respond to Yang Chuwen's voice.

Because the corpse that supposedly disappeared was standing in front of him, aiming a scythe at him.

"If you don't want to die, it's better to put down that gun. Don't bother with useless thoughts."

Dark Soul shuddered.

'This guy. He's not just sharp, he's way beyond that.'

He considered launching a surprise no-scope shot, but decided against it.

If the opponent was truly the Black Scythe, any resistance would be useless.

"If you listen well, I won't kill you. Don't worry."

"What... What do you want?"

"For now, let's go to your friends."

When Ryumin gestured forward, Dark Soul moved cautiously, glancing at him.

'What is he thinking? It's not like he's planning to spare me. Could it be that they're gathering everyone in one place to kill us?'

Maybe it's an opportunity. If they join forces with their colleagues, there might be a chance.

But his colleagues are not the type to just stand by and let things happen.
ChatGPT

Even if I die, I will choose the path of resistance.

Of course, he didn't have a desire to die so meaninglessly.

'I should watch for an opportunity and escape while my colleagues attack the Black Scythe.'

Using his colleagues might provide a chance.

Even if he has to survive alone, wouldn't it be better?

'Please. Be scared, but don't die, my comrades. At least create an opening for me to escape.'

With such desperate thoughts, he reached the end of the alley, which was the sniping location.

As he entered the alley, he saw Yang Chuwen, Jang So-wi, and Spainard standing motionless.

And there was also a young Asian woman.

"Welcome, Master."

The woman respectfully bowed her head towards the Black Scythe.

Whether it was Korean or not, Dark Soul didn't find it surprising.

It wasn't strange for a player of the caliber of the Black Scythe to have a secretary.

The problem was that the one who bowed wasn't just the Black Scythe.

"Welcome! Lord Black Scythe!"

All the members of the Messiah bowed at a 90-degree angle towards the Black Scythe.

"What is this...?"

Dark Soul, astonished by the unexpected situation, mumbled with bitten lips.

"These bastards have attached themselves to the Black Scythe!"

It was clear that they had clung to him like leeches in order to survive.

"I knew this would happen! These shameless bastards!"

"You will become like them soon."

"What?"

Upon hearing the Black Scythe's words, Dark Soul immediately snorted in disdain.

"Like leeches. You might be able to kill me, but you can't control my mind..."

"Dominate."

With Ryu Min's single word, Yang Chuwen stepped forward.

It didn't take long for Dark Soul's eyes to become glazed and dominated.

"Nice to meet you, Master."

"No, from now on, your master is Lord Black Scythe. Greet him."

"I greet the new Master."

Dark Soul, now mentally dominated, bowed and greeted.

Looking down at his submissive figure, Ryu Min smirked.

With this, the organization called Messiah disappeared forever.
