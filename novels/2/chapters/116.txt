Max Level Player's 100th Regression Episode 116

Staged Situation

"Eom Jun-seok?"

Ryu Min remembered the opponent's nickname.

He was the one who drew attention when they caught the High Orc.

Of course, he didn't intentionally attract attention; he was just frozen in place.

"You remember my nickname?"

"I vaguely remember seeing it."

Either way, he was the one who set a spectacular record of a 1-second Time Attack.

How could Ryu Min forget?

"But why is this guy here?"

Someone who hadn't spoken a word to him approached first and started a conversation.

With a somewhat awkward expression.

"Oh, Black Scythe remembers me... It was a good idea to strike up a conversation!"

Reading his thoughts, it seemed there were no ulterior motives.

It looked like he just approached to say hello.

Despite knowing this, Ryu Min asked bluntly:

"What do you want from me?"

"Oh, you, uh, saved me back then, and I felt bad for not even thanking you."

Eom Jun-seok bowed his head with a sincere and serious expression.

"Thank you for saving my life."

'I should be the one thankful. Thanks for drawing the aggro of the High Orc.'

Without revealing his true thoughts, Ryu Min simply nodded.

"Got it. Now, go."

Even though it sounded like an urging, Eom Jun-seok didn't turn away.

Reading his thoughts, he seemed regretful.

'Ah, wait. Could it be?'

Ryu Min looked back and forth between Huh Tae-seok and Eom Jun-seok.

Their gazes on him seemed surprisingly similar.

'It feels like I've gained another follower....'

Eom Jun-seok, pretending not to hear Ryu Min's words, only said what he wanted to say.

"It's an honor to party with Black Scythe. Please take care of me."

"Wait a moment. Did you say your name is Eom Jun-seok? What do you mean by Black Scythe saved you?"

"Ah, well, that's...."

In response to Huh Tae-seok's question, Eom Jun-seok explained the dire situation at the time in detail.

"Ah, so Black Scythe appeared then."

"Yes. I was really lucky. But you...."

"I guess the introduction is overdue. I'm Nopain Noge, by the way. Are you by any chance interested in religion?"

"Yes? Religion?"

“I'm currently recruiting new members...”

The two who exchanged greetings continued their conversation.

Meanwhile, Ryu Min, the central figure in the conversation, stayed back.

'I wonder who might be the next leader. Even in this situation, he's recruiting new believers.'

Huh Tae-seok, who seemed unclear about what to do, continued the conversation confidently in front of Eom Jun-seok.

His expression was serious regarding matters related to the Black Scythe.

'Go ahead, do what you want. It's not a bad thing if followers increase.'

Although the murmuring between the two of them felt secretive, Ryu Min didn't mind.

As long as they didn't interfere, it was fine.

At that moment, Elf Yoo Grito used the wind spirit to communicate with everyone.

"We will now depart. Please take care, warriors of the Otherworld."

With that signal, the carriages started moving.

Clatter, clatter...

The white horses pulled the wheelless carriages.

Along the formation of 30 carriages, over 700 players also moved.

Without anyone saying so, they naturally divided on both sides, guarding the carriages.

They remained alert to the surroundings, not knowing when monsters might appear.

Their demeanor was quite serious.

Although the forest was beautiful, they didn't lose their discernment to the point of being entranced.

Wasn't this the Otherworld, where anything could pop out at any moment?

However, unlike other players, Ryu Min didn't show signs of tension.

Instead, he seemed relaxed, as if he had just come out for a drink in the neighborhood.

Because he already knew what kind of monsters would appear and when.

Also, the level of those monsters.

'Harpy, Lizardman, Were Wolf. They'll come out alternately. Every 10 minutes.'

Similar to Dwarven Top, there would be 30 rounds of attacks this time as well.

However, the number of monsters would be halved.

Since the monsters were twice as powerful as orcs.

'Each person needs to take down ten. It won't be easy for the players here.'

It was an intermediate difficulty level, so a challenging journey awaited, but other than Ryu Min, no one knew that fact.

"Kheeheehee!"

"Kyahaha!"

Flapping their wings, harpies flew in from the forest.

"It's monsters! Everyone, be careful!"
ChatGPT

Flying monsters were a first for the players, so they were initially bewildered. However, the confusion was brief.

Swish!

Seeing Ryu Min effortlessly take down a harpy, players realized that, despite flying, these creatures had to come down to attack on the ground.

'Even though they fly, they can only attack from the ground with their beaks and claws. It's easy to handle when they get close.'

Perhaps stimulated by Ryu Min, who was effortlessly slashing both sides with Death's Scythe, players wielded their weapons and used skills to protect the elves.

Huh Tae-seok and Eom Jun-seok weren't idle either.

Shrrrrrraak-

"Kiiit?"

As the black chain bound a harpy that came too close,

Pueok!

A black arrow pierced through its head.

While Huh Tae-seok waited for the cooldown, the harpy flew toward him for a moment.

Thud!

After Eom Jun-seok's sword cut through the harpy's abdomen, he mercilessly crushed its fallen body.

"Thank you, Master Jun-seok."

"Be careful, Master Noge."

"By the way, you'll consider my proposal, right?"

"Let's deal with these first and talk later."

The harpy hunting went smoothly.

Perhaps because they were birds, they were quite agile, but they were manageable.

They gave more experience points than orcs, and they were less resilient.

Even so, with suddenly appearing flying monsters, the players each heaved a sigh of relief.

"Phew, flying monsters, that was a surprise."

"But they weren't much when we actually faced them, right?"

"But the experience points are quite substantial."

"With 740 people sharing, it won't be much, will it?"

Nevertheless, they figured that as long as they kept hunting like this, their levels would increase.

There were also comments about the Black Scythe's performance.

"Did you see earlier? Black Scythe fighting."

"He was slashing both sides with the scythe."

"It's the first time monsters looked pitiful."

There was a lively discussion, but Ryu Min knew.

'Even this leisurely atmosphere will turn into a sigh after some time.'

If granted a wish right now, he might say he wanted to stretch out and take a break, such was the exhausting journey that awaited.

'He'll realize it soon.'

About three minutes later, lizardmen hidden in the forest rushed at them like a band of thieves.

Having fought one battle and taken a brief rest:

"Awwww!"

"What, what's happening?"

"We had lizards earlier, and now it's werewolves?"

Warewolves harassed the players, not allowing them to rest.

"Heuk, heug..."

Just after defeating them and taking a few steps, harpies flew in.

"Why are there so many dog-like monsters?"

Once again, lizardmen attacked.

"Does this make sense? Are monsters of this level waiting in the forest to ambush us?"

"No way, are they waiting? Maybe they regenerate like in games."

Hunting was good, but shouldn't there be time to rest?

Even though monsters appeared every 10 minutes, there was no time left after fighting and moving.

Players had to endure a relentless forced march, killing monsters and moving every 10 minutes for 5 hours.

Players only realized this fact after the end of the 5 waves.

"Hoo, hoo. Are you okay, Master Black Scythe?"

"As you can see."

Unlike the discharged followers, Ryu Min, who was still full of energy, was leisurely allocating stats.

These stats weren't gained from leveling up; they came from the stats provided by the bead of the afterlife.

"1 stat point for every 100 kills. Is there another item as cheat-like as this?"

With 2 points given per level-up, it was the same as leveling up by killing 200 monsters.

Considering the slow increase in levels, it was an incredible item.

Stats obtained through the bead were more than those gained by leveling up.

It was like robbing Peter to pay Paul.

Anyway, Ryu Min found the situation amusing.

"With so many monsters and the ability to recover durability, it seems busy allocating stats, doesn't it?"

Currently, Ryu Min was thinking of balancing the runes and raising four stats evenly.

"Even without the balance rune, it's good to evenly distribute the stats for balance."

He experimented with various combinations while repeating the rounds, wondering how to get stronger.

But the conclusion was clear.

Nothing was stronger than well-balanced stats.

When Ryu Min finished distributing the stats, Yugrito urged him.

"The journey is not over yet, warriors of the otherworld. It seems the monsters are all cleared, so we will move now."

"Ah, they don't even give us a break."

"We'll probably encounter more monsters after a few steps."

Players, who complained while getting up and dusting off their bottoms, guarded the sides of the carriage.

If they couldn't protect the elf on the top, it was the players who faced destruction.

Even if they didn't like it, they had no choice but to move.

Not only the regular groups showed signs of movement.

"The betrayer group has started moving."

With the thought that they might collapse first in the midst of the relentless monster attacks, the four betrayers huddled together.

Reading their thoughts, it was revealed that they planned to strike the elf on the top during the chaos caused by the monster attacks.

"It won't be easy. These guys are not ordinary elf merchants."

The merchants driving the carriage were actually knights escorting a princess.

Moreover, there were two protective spells laid by spirits on the carriage the princess was riding.

"If you touch the carriage handle, a magic that activates the wind's blade, and a magic that throws you away with antigravity."

If they managed to break through all of that and capture the princess?

"Then the game is over."

Even if they only threatened to kill the princess, the elf knights would likely be hesitant.

In other words, if they captured the princess, the betrayer group would have a definite advantage.

Then, they could complete the betrayer quest without any more bloodshed.

"By threatening to kill the princess for the remaining time, I can stall and prevent the top from reaching its destination."

In that sense, aiming for the princess was indeed more efficient.

"There's no way the betrayer group knows that the princess is inside."

Reading their thoughts, it turned out they were just suspicious of the carriage with exquisite patterns.

They probably believed there were precious items inside.

"The princess is valuable, so it worked out anyway."

Even if they headed to Moro, as long as they reached Seoul, the betrayers agreed to target the carriage the princess was riding.

"Come to think of it, the monsters appearing this time are werewolves, right?"

If they timed their skills when the monsters appeared?

He thought he could stage the desired situation.

Then, he would likely achieve the desired result.

"I don't know if they'll succeed, but I should be prepared."

Ryumin subtly shifted his position.

To a place where others' gazes couldn't reach.

At that moment, shouts echoed from various places.

"Monsters!"

"They're werewolves!"

Right on cue, werewolves appeared.

In that moment, Ryumin used a skill.

"Night of Death."

Instantly, darkness swallowed the forest.

Players were taken aback, but soon they calmly faced the monsters.

It was because they already knew it was the skill of the Black Scythe.

"Black Scythe used a skill; it doesn't matter."

"It's dark, but we can still see."

However, there was something they overlooked.

The fact that werewolves became 30% stronger at night.

"Awoo-!"

The eyes of the werewolves glowed red, and their claws became sharper.

"Uh?"

Players were surprised as the werewolves moved with more agility than before.

On the other hand, it was an opportunity for the betrayer group.

"It seems the Black Scythe used the skill to work in the dark."

"Thanks, Black Scythe!"

At this moment, the four rushed towards the carriage.

It looked like there might be precious items with sophisticated patterns.

"Let's rob there and threaten the elves somehow to stop them!"

With such thoughts, they approached the carriage.

Perhaps because it was dark, the elf merchants didn't notice their movements.

The betrayers' attack was only detected when one of them touched the carriage handle.

"Whiiing- Squeak!"

"Uh?"

The hand was cut off by the wind's blade.

"Ahahaha!"

At the betrayer's scream, the elves turned their heads toward the carriage where the princess was.

"What's going on?"

"These warriors from another world dare to touch the carriage!"

Then, another betrayer tried to open the carriage door.

However, a reverse magic spell triggered, sending the betrayer's body soaring into the sky.

"Uh? Uh? Uh?"

At a certain point, the magic was released.

"Aaah!"

The betrayer fell to the ground.

It was a gruesome death that was too horrifying to look at.

But there were still two betrayers left.

Crack!

Opening the carriage door revealed an elf with rabbit-like eyes staring back.

It was Princess Yufenellia.

"I thought there were precious items...."

"But there's something even better, right? Hehehe."

The traitors revealed this with laughter.

Once they capture the princess, the game will be over.

"The princess is in danger!"

Hearing the commotion from the carriage, Elf Captain Yugrito swiftly drew his sword and rushed over.

"What are you all doing? Protect the princess!"

Yugrito, about to say "Protect the princess," closed his mouth.

The two traitors who attacked the carriage were already sprawled on the ground.

"How did this happen..."

The darkness had already dissipated, and sunlight was shining on the carriage.

There, a man was poking the traitors on the ground, as if confirming if they had fainted.

It was none other than Black Scythe.
