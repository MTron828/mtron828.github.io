Title: The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 269

Is this a joke?

Lost Yak asked, and a strange answer came back.

"A Black Scythe? Is this a joke?"

"Just because I said I'm the Black Scythe."

Even after saying it again, Minjoo didn't easily believe it.

"Don't play around. I'm serious."

"I'm serious too."

"You can't be the Black Scythe."

Minjoo denied it without even considering the possibility that Ryu Min might be the Black Scythe.

From Ryu Min's honest perspective, it was a ridiculous situation. His pride was subtly hurt because he couldn't see much of a difference between himself now and the Black Scythe.

"Why would I be the Black Scythe?"

"Everything is different, starting from your height. Your voice, atmosphere, everything is different. It's like a completely different person."

"..."

Seeing him strongly deny it, it seemed like he had made an effort to look different conceptually.

'Is there really no room for doubt?'

Although he could prove it, the thought of the aftermath of revealing the truth made him hesitant.

It felt somewhat frightening.

"If I have to make an excuse, I should come up with something plausible."

"Okay. I'll tell the truth. Actually, I lied to you. My nickname is not Lost Yak."

"My suspicion was correct? No wonder I couldn't find any search results."

While she didn't believe in the Black Scythe, she easily believed this.

'If it turns out like this, there's no choice. I have to hide my identity until the end.'

Ryu Min concealed the truth with a plausible lie.

"When I mentioned the nickname Lost Yak, it was back when I was in the Cult of Reincarnation, right? There were a lot of people around, so I deliberately lied."

"Why?"

"If the existence of a prophet is revealed, it could be troublesome. It was my way of protecting myself. It's burdensome to attract unnecessary attention."

"Ah..."

Minjoo opened her mouth as if understanding, but her doubts were not completely resolved.

"Then what about the mismatch in names?"

"I have a rune that disrupts tracking by others. Even if they know my face and name, I can't be traced because of that."

"Ah..."

It was a somewhat valid reason.

It's not like he's lying because he doesn't want to tell me, right?

Reading her thoughts, Minjoo wasn't completely trusting, but she seemed to understand and let it go to some extent.

She thought he would tell her when the time was right.

'Even though I told the truth, she still doesn't believe me. That's frustrating.'

For Minjoo, the relationship between the Black Scythe and himself seemed unimaginable.

'In a way, it's fortunate. If this is the reaction now, the shock when she finds out my true identity will be quite significant...'

He hoped she would eventually believe.

Despite clearing up some misunderstandings, Minjoo still wore a dissatisfied expression.

"And what about Krishi? Why did you come to find her?"

'Was it because she felt uncomfortable about that?'

Indeed, if a man she secretly admired met another woman alone in a hotel, it would be enough to spark jealousy.

"It's nothing. She came to hear the prophecy for the next round. Don't misunderstand."

"She comes to track me without saying a word, just to hear a prophecy?"

"She came without saying a word just like you did."

"..."

Minjoo, who was momentarily speechless, admitted belatedly that she had misunderstood.

"I believe you. There's no emotion between us."

"Is it not allowed to have emotions?"

"No, it's not! You are my..."

Minjoo, who was about to say something embarrassing, quickly closed her mouth.

Anyway, it's not allowed! Don't pay attention to anyone else. Got it?"

"I got it."

After saying it, Minjoo turned her head in embarrassment and sipped her coffee.

From Ryu Min's perspective, her actions seemed cute as he could see through her inner thoughts.

"While you're at it, I'll tell you the strategy for Round 17."

"Uh-huh."

Huh Tae-seok was lost in thought in the leader's room.

The only man currently troubling him was Alex Pearson. Is he really taking sides within the organization?

Based on what he had observed so far, Alex had contacted five people - Dorothy, Victor, Sophia, Russell, and Joyong-ho.

All of them were members of the Cult of Reincarnation.

'Why did he meet them in person? What's his purpose?'
ChatGPT

Although he couldn't eavesdrop on the conversation, he was definitely suspicious.

If he's traveling around the world to personally visit, there must be some important request or reason for it, right?

'Something fishy is going on.'

There's a hunch, but no concrete evidence.

'If only I could find evidence, it might be helpful to the Black Scythe...'

Just then, the phone on the desk rang.

Huh Tae-seok, seeing the caller ID, hurriedly answered the phone.

"Yes, Black Scythe. What's the matter?"

How many days are left until the regular meeting?

Huh Tae-seok's eyes turned to the calendar on the desk.

"Just one day left."

Change the schedule to tomorrow.

"Tomorrow?"

This meant gathering all the followers by tomorrow.

"What's the matter?"

Do you remember the task we did last time?

"Task?... Are you talking about planting the black seeds among the people?"

Yes, exactly. I need to do that again. While we're at it, I'll also share the strategy for Round 17.

Doing that absurd task of summoning demons and killing them again?

For some reason, if it's the word of God, it must be followed.

"All right. I'll gather the followers right away."

Even though Huh Tae-seok ended the call with a relaxed voice, his expression quickly changed to anxiety.

'What should I do? I unexpectedly get to meet the Black Scythe earlier than expected?'

The original plan was to secure evidence of Alex being a traitor and then open up to the people under their watchful eyes.

But with the meeting moved up, time became pressing.

'I need to secure evidence. Evidence...'

In the limited time, there was only one way that came to mind.

'I have no choice but to ask directly.'

Huh Tae-seok entered the contact information of the followers and sent a group message.

[Hello, this is Leader Huh Tae-seok.

The regular meeting scheduled for Friday has been changed to Tuesday evening at 6 p.m. I apologize for the sudden change in date.

It may be urgent, but on this day, the Black Scythe will share the strategy for the next round. Please make sure to attend without fail. Thank you.]
ChatGPT

Hello everyone, this is Leader Heo Tae-suk. The regular meeting...]

Below, he kindly transcribed the text into English.

Except for one person.

He sent Alex Pearson a different time and place.

'This way, I can confront him directly.'

After all, he planned to meet in person to extract evidence.

Upon receiving the text, Alex immediately boarded a silent airplane.

It takes approximately 10 hours to travel from Germany to Korea.

Time was of the essence.

'I don't know why they suddenly changed the time...'

He couldn't afford to miss the meeting.

Didn't they mention that they would share the strategy for Round 17?

'I have to go no matter what.'

With such determination, Alex, arriving at Incheon International Airport as quickly as possible, showed the meeting place to the taxi driver.

"Here. Please go here."

"Huh? Passenger. Is this address correct? This is just an empty lot with nothing around..."

"Please go fast. Okay? It's late."

"Late? Okay, okay. As long as I get paid."

With unanswered questions, the taxi driver, who headed towards the meeting place, simply took the money and left, leaving Alex alone in the empty lot.

"Is this the right place? Why is nobody here?"

Even though he arrived 20 minutes late to the agreed-upon time, there was no one on the empty lot.

Alex couldn't understand the reason, but he didn't mind.

Because the person he needed to ask was approaching.

"Leader!"

The approaching person was Huh Tae-seok.

He smiled with joy, but only for a moment.

'What's going on?'

Sensing an unusual atmosphere, Alex tightened his expression.

'Is something wrong?'

Unlike usual, Huh Tae-seok's expression was stiff, and he was even wearing equipment.

"Leader, your expression doesn't look good. What's wrong..."

"Alex."

Huh Tae-seok interrupted and spoke in English that he had prepared.

"Tell the truth."

"Yes? What on earth..."

"Don't lie."

Alex wasn't sure what he was being asked to say, but the atmosphere was heavy.

It could be felt in the eyes.

'No way...'

Wearing equipment to meet the followers meant something different.
ChatGPT

It means that he can be attacked at any time.

It's like showing a gun to someone and telling them not to make trouble.

'I don't know what's going on, but someone is hostile towards me.'

Feeling that way, Alex quickly put on his equipment.

It's natural to wear equipment when you feel threatened.

But Huh Tae-seok, as if expecting it, raised the corners of his mouth and cast a skill.

"Black Chains."

Chains that appeared out of thin air bound Alex's limbs.

Even though he had the equipment on, Alex found himself unable to move, and he opened his eyes wide.

"What are you doing...!"

"If you speak the truth, you won't have to face a harsh situation."

Summoning black arrows, Huh Tae-seok aimed at Alex and spoke in rehearsed English.

"You. What kind of trick are you plotting?"

"Trick? What on earth are you talking about..."

"I know everything, so speak the truth!"

Huh Tae-seok growled.

The black arrow created over his shoulder seemed ready to pierce the heart at any moment.

"Dorothy, Victor, Sophia, Russell, Joyong-ho!"

Alex, upon hearing the list, opened his surprised eyes.

"You met these people I just mentioned, right? Why did you contact them?"

"How did you...?"

For a moment, Alex's expression twisted with a passing thought.

"Did you spy on me from behind?"

"Speak the truth..."

Boom!

When Alex shattered the mana shield he had cast on his body, Huh Tae-seok was thrown backward.

At the same time, the chains that had bound him disappeared.

"Did you follow me? Why? Why?"

"Ugh, did this son of a b**** attack me...?"

Huh Tae-seok gritted his teeth.

Fortunately, there were no serious injuries, but the one who attacked first was that guy.

"Demonization."

With horns appearing on his forehead, Huh Tae-seok transformed into a demon.

Seeing him summon four black arrows, Alex opened his eyes alertly.

"So this is how it's going to be?"

Seemingly with no intention of avoiding a fight, he prepared an ice spear.

The situation was on the verge of an imminent battle.

"Stop it."

At that moment, someone intervened between them.

However, it was already too late.

"Huh!"

Both of them were already casting spells at each other.

Zap! Zap! Zap!
ChatGPT

The accidentally intersecting spells hit the person who unintentionally got in between.

While a level 70 spell had the power to rip apart the limbs of an ordinary person, the opponent was not an ordinary individual.

"That, that is..."

At the spot where the spell hit, there was a barrier of darkness.

Once the barrier was lifted, the figure of the man who had intervened became visible.

A body with a sickly pale complexion, devoid of even a trace of vitality.

"What are you doing? Stick together."

The man in the mask, the Black Scythe, reprimanded the two in a low-pitched voice.
