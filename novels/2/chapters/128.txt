Title: Episode 128 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Investigation

Elimination of Jangbokchul 14 hours ago.

Ryumin found a familiar name on the murder list.

'Joo Sungtak? Did this guy also join Plexeba?'

The name and age match, but the nickname is slightly different.

'Nickname is [Dungjaengideul]? Shouldn't it originally be [Dung Meongcheongideul]?'

Considering the different rankings listed, it seems like he manipulated the information a bit when joining.

'So that's why Joo Sungtak wasn't in a leadership position?'

Joo Sungtak is a skilled player ranking 2nd or 3rd in the entire area.

If he had been in a leadership position, they would have met sooner, but manipulating information explains why they haven't met yet.

'Looking at the joining date, it seems he joined early on... but did he only join without any activity?'

Checking the café, there are no posted articles or comments.

It seems he just passed the murder interview and quietly lived on.

'Naturally, this guy deserves to die, but there's still some use for him...'

Reluctantly, a decision was made to spare him.

But in the end, it's just another life lost like the others.

Just a longer extension of that period.

'Huh?'

Looking at the list again, a nickname that seemed familiar appeared.

'Name: Hong Suna. Nickname: Bolppangjjinppang. Age: 22. Occupation: Actress.'

Suddenly, Seo Arin came to mind.

Same age, same occupation.

If they acted in the same production, they might have been acquainted.

'Should I search for her?'

Searching for Hong Suna on the internet revealed several articles.

[Surviving Actress Hong Suna in the 8th Round, Her Chameleon-like Charm!] [Hong Suna, Seo Arin, Goo Yeonseung, Jangbokchul, Popular Celebrity Players Survive Another Round...] [Actress Hong Suna Signs Advertisement Contract with Major Agency! Reason to Keep Living Emerges!] [Hong Suna Confirmed to Appear on Variety Program 'Players'! Anticipation for the Role...]

It turns out she is a popular actress in her twenties who has survived so far, alongside Seo Arin, boosting their popularity.

'Assisting murder in Plexeba and still confidently active in the entertainment industry... What a conscienceless woman.'

Anyway, the information that she assisted in murder is known only to the leaders.
ChatGPT

"If the leaders remain silent, it won't be known to the public.

However, Plexeba won't make a fuss about it either. It's like spitting while lying down.

'Because they know that fact, they are probably openly active.'

Tsk tsk. Ryumin, who was clicking his tongue, went to check Hong Suna's Instagram to gather some information.

Among various pictures, there was a photo of her with Seo Arin.

'Just looking at the photos, they seem quite close.'

In addition to the two women smiling brightly, there were many other photos.

Mostly selfies of Hong Suna pretending to be cute.

Other photos included shots with friends.

Among them, Ryumin closely examined one photo.

It was a recent picture taken with male actors in front of a club, and underneath it had this caption:

[A snapshot with close fellow actors at a frequently visited club. From the left, Junior Joo Jiseung, Senior Goo Yeonseung, Senior Jangbokchul, Junior Kang Suhyun... We had fun again today!]

'Fellow actors?'

Names he had seen somewhere before.

Just to be sure, he looked at the murder list again.

He compared the names with those of people in the acting profession.

"Hmm."

Every one of them was a player who had joined Plexeba without exception.

'They were gossiping among themselves, and all the actors are Plexeba members?'

Committing crimes such as murder, rape, and aiding, they shamelessly pretended to live as ordinary humans.

Moreover, they were living under the spotlight as celebrities.

Ryumin, unable to hide his astonishment, accessed the Instagram accounts of each actor.

There were many photos of them taking pictures of each other's faces, claiming to be close.

'All these actors are close to each other, and they're Plexeba members? There's something fishy about this.'

When murderers gather, what kind of mischief might they get up to?

Could they be plotting another crime?

With that thought, after investigating, he found one commonality.

'All these pictures were taken at the same club.'

Looking at photos taken against the same club background, Ryumin grabbed his coat.

There was definitely a foul smell.

If he went to the club, something more might come out.

"Hyung, where are you going?"

"I'll be back in a moment."

"At this hour?"

After nodding, he opened the front door and left his younger sibling behind.

"Go to sleep first. I might be late."

Rrrrrrrumble-

The club's location wasn't far from here.

After driving the Lamborghini for about 20 minutes, Ryumin arrived.

It was well past midnight, making it a good time to go to the club.

"I'm not going for fun; it's for investigation purposes."

He boldly parked his car in the public parking lot and walked a short distance.

"Here."

Ryumin, who found the club he saw on Instagram, was quickly disappointed.

Contrary to what he expected from movies, there was no muscular bouncer at the entrance, dressed for security checks.

Instead, not only was there no bouncer, but the club's door was also locked.

"What? They don't open the club door at this time, almost like it's a peak hour?"

Certainly suspicious.

He looked around the building and found a back door, which, unsurprisingly, was also locked.

"I sense there's someone inside using my detection skill, but what's going on?"

The doors were locked on both sides, yet there seemed to be someone within 30 meters?

"Strange, very strange."

If there were windows, he might have broken them to intrude, but the club was underground.

How should he get in?

"Should I think deeply about this?"

Thud-

He just forcefully opened the door.

Afterward, he used invisibility to conceal himself and entered.

Wearing ghost-walking boots, his footsteps made no sound.

"...."

The club seemed quiet, as if it weren't operational.

"But there were people inside."

Ryumin, guided by the sensed presence, walked toward it.

"Huh?"

The person, who seemed to have a detection skill, looked in his direction.

Ryumin immediately stepped out of the 30-meter range.

"Strange. Did I sense it wrong?"

When he couldn't see or sense anyone, the man tilted his head with a grin and walked again.

"That guy is Joo Jiseung, an actor."

Despite confirming the face, Ryumin felt uneasy.

"This is tough; everyone and everything seem to have detection skills, making it difficult to approach properly."

He realized that invisibility wasn't the best skill.

"Until I get the Rune of Luck, there's no choice."

Fortunately, he could obtain the Rune of Luck in the 9th round.

Until then, he considered it unavoidable and cautiously trailed Joo Jiseung, maintaining a distance of 31 meters to avoid detection.
ChatGPT

Walking down the hallway, Joo Jiseung soon came across three people coming out of a room.

Their faces were familiar to him.

"The names were Goo Yeonseung, Jangbokchul, and Kang Suhyun, right?"

Perhaps because it was quiet, their conversation could be heard even though there was a 30-meter gap.

"Oh? Senior, where are you going?"

"I'm going to get some drinks. Also, some marijuana."

"Have you already smoked everything?"

"Yeah. I said I would bring it, so these guys couldn't resist and followed me out."

In response to Goo Yeonseung's words, his younger siblings spoke.

"Hey, can the younger ones stay still while the older brother moves?"

"Hehe, it's not because my younger siblings eagerly wanted to come out."

The laughter sounded like that of someone already addicted to marijuana.

"While not being able to control their bodies properly. Just relax. I'll bring both the alcohol and marijuana."

"Um, then, can we ask for a favor?"

"Of course. I'm going inside to sing some songs. Since I'm bringing everything, you guys just wait inside."

"Hehe, thank you! Senior!"

When Jangbokchul bowed respectfully, Goo Yeonseung smirked.

"When you greet like that, you really seem like a gangster."

"My face does look like that of a gangster. Hehe."

"Goo senior. Even though Jangbokchul senior looks like that, he's incredibly pure. He hasn't even done it once. Kekeke."

"Oh, really? Unexpected for someone who looks like a bandit?"

"Hehe, don't tease me, seniors."

Embarrassed, Jangbokchul adjusted his hair.

"No wonder for a while, Goo senior kept calling out Seo Arin's name as if he had a sticker on her ear. There was a reason for the obsession?"

When Seo Arin's name came out of Goo Yeonseung's mouth, Ryumin's gaze changed.

"Senior, but is it really true that I can see Seo Arin tomorrow?"

"Yeah. She contacted me. They've set up a meeting at the café for lunch."

"T-Then, am I really taking off my bachelor label tomorrow?"

"Of course. Our Bokchul's ideal type is rolling in; how can I not share? I'll let you have the first go."

"T-Thank you, senior! Thank you so much!"

Jangbokchul bowed his waist repeatedly.

"But in return, it's our turn next, right?"
ChatGPT

"Oh, that's obvious! I'll go first, and then you can have your way, Senior."

"Is this brat telling me to go first until the end?"

"Hahaha!"

Jangbokchul genuinely seemed to be in a good mood.

"By the way, keep hearing 'Senior' from you all the time makes me feel like I've become a gangster. Just call me Senior."

"It sounds better to say 'Hyung' than 'Senior,' isn't it? Hehe."

"But still, it might seem weird to others if you call me that."

"Oh, come on. I'm doing it because I might not have that kind of sensitivity? In front of others, it's only natural to call you 'Senior.'"

Grinning, Jangbokchul, who wiped his hands like a Parisian, laughed softly.

Reading his thoughts, it seemed he was unfolding a wing of unimaginable imagination that couldn't be put into words.

Hehe, when Seo Arin comes tomorrow, I should try everything, you damn woman.

Ryumin turned away as if there was nothing more to hear.

Having read his inner thoughts, he had obtained the crucial information.

'These guys are planning to kill Seo Arin.'

He never expected Seo Arin to be involved.

'What I investigated out of curiosity is connecting like this. There were only trash around Seo Arin, right?'

Seo Arin probably didn't know.

That she would be betrayed by an actor she considered her closest friend.

'Tomorrow, I'll find out. How foolish it is to trust people.'

As a player who had completed 99 rounds, Ryumin had witnessed countless scenes like this.

'Anyway, this is an opportunity. A chance to gain genuine favor from Seo Arin.'

If he could save Seo Arin from a crisis under the name of the Black Scythe?

He could make her completely his person.

'While men can dominate using charisma, it doesn't work with women because they aren't swayed by charm.'

That was why he didn't kill those guys and turned away.

'It's better to wipe them out when they're gathered in one place. Killing them now won't make Seo Arin appreciate my efforts.'

Of course, how gaining Seo Arin's favor would affect the future was uncertain.

It couldn't be assumed that it would only have positive effects.

However, leaving it unattended was not an option.

This opportunity was too valuable to throw away on Magyeongrok.
ChatGPT

"I'd be better off saving myself than relying on Magyeongrok's paintings. Right now, it's a cooperative relationship, but Magyeongrok could become an obstacle for Ryumin."

Bzzt—Thud.

Exiting the club, Ryumin awaited the break of dawn.

"If I stalk Hong Seon-ah tomorrow, I can seize a perfect opportunity."

It was time to conduct the trash cleanup personally.

As of the current moment, 14 hours later, in Ryumin's hands was the corpse of the trash named Jangbokchul.

He had followed Hong Seon-ah, entered the club, and killed Jangbokchul, who was in the public restroom.

"If I show him the body, it'll deliver a clear message."

After raising the head of the limp guy with a broken neck, he grabbed the nape and moved.

Of course, to portray himself as the Black Scythe, he wore a white mask.

Intentionally changing into different shoes instead of the ghostwalk boots, he entered with audible footsteps.

Tap-tap—

He spotted Seo Arin, who was almost about to be in serious trouble.

The actors' gazes turned toward Ryumin.

No, precisely, they focused on the seemingly unharmed corpse in front of him.

"Hey? Bokchul! Here's your beloved Seo Arin..."

As they noticed their own figure behind the corpse, the expressions of the actors froze.

"Who are you?!"

"Could it be him?"

He erased all traces of Jangbokchul's corpse.

"You said there was a smell of trash around here. Seems like you all gathered here."

"I asked you who you are!"

Without saying a word, Ryumin raised the Death Scythe.

The audience collectively held their breath.

Unless they were fools, that alone was enough of an answer.

"That, that is..."

"A scythe?"

"Could it be the Black Scythe?"

Some actors shook their heads in denial.

"Nah, it can't be. Why would the Black Scythe show up here?"

"Right. There's no guarantee that only that guy would wield the scythe."

Two actors who were chatting let go of Seo Arin and stepped forward.

The loyal dogs who were wagging their tails at Gyuyeonseung.

"Hey, you son of a bitch. How did you get in here?"

"You killed Bokchul? Huh?"
ChatGPT

Ryumin sighed as he uttered, "It seems like the situation hasn't been fully assessed yet..."

"The bastard is sighing in front of us? Prepare to get...!"

Swish—

Ryumin's scythe moved once in the darkness.

The heads of the two actors flowed down as if sliding.

No sound was heard as their heads were cut off, much like slicing tofu.

In an instant, the two people turned into corpses.

Thud-thud! Thud-thud!

"Gasp!"

The remaining actors trembled in horror.

A stunned expression was evident on every face.

There was no exception for Seo Arin.

"I-Is that the Black Scythe? Really?"

Although she was skeptical due to the different voice, Seo Arin couldn't disbelieve the presence she knew as the Black Scythe.

Ryumin aimed the scythe at the remaining individuals.

"Since it's troublesome, come at me together. And don't even think about scheming against me."

A muffled voice flowed from the mask.

"Since none of you will leave this place alive anyway."
