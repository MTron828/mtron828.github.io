Title: Episode 317 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Test

Although Minjoo pretended not to know, Ryumin did not respond.

"The person I met back then turned out to be the Black Scythe Lord... The world is really small."

"..."

"But why did you do that? You lied to me, saying you were just an ordinary person."

He had been curious all along about why she was letting her guard down.

The reason she concealed her identity.

"It's nothing. You didn't know about me, so I just played a little joke."

"Then why in the cafe where I was..."

"Do I need a reason not to go to a cafe?"

"..."

"I just happened to run into you. Don't pay it any mind."

"W-Well, okay."

"Now, explain in front of people."

"Yes..."

Although there was something dubious, Minjoo turned her head in agreement.

"Hello, I'm Buffer Minjoo Lee. Since you already know about other skills, I'll start by revealing my max level skill. My max level skill is named 'Dual Buff,' where the buff effect received once is applied again..."

As expected, Minjoo's max level skill was also useful.

"It's incredible that buffs can be received twice. It's overpowered."

It was necessary to test whether buffs from other professions could also be applied.

"It can only be used on one target, but that alone is tremendous."

Not only Minjoo, but other professions were the same.

From what he heard, there were no skills that fell short of expectations.

"These are skills I've never heard of, but they could be useful with good strategy."

In fact, Ryumin didn't know any max level skills.

Not that there weren't any; the only player who reached max level and survived up to round 20 was himself.

Therefore, he had asked for explanations from others.

To check and find out if there were any useful max level skills from other professions.

"It seems clear how to strategize."

After everyone's explanations, Ryumin spoke.

"Take a short break. During that time, I'll organize the skills and plan the strategy."

At Ryumin's command, people dispersed for a break.

However, Ryumin was busy forming strategies in his mind by combining the skills he had just heard.

There were so many skills to memorize to the point of being overwhelming, but Ryumin's memory was unparalleled, so there was no issue.

At that moment, someone extended their face to the side.

"Black Scythe Lord."

It was Seo Arin.

"No, should I call you the Prophet? Or is it Ryumin, sir?"

"Call me whatever you're comfortable with, Seo Baewoonim."

"You can also call Ryumin comfortably. Why suddenly use honorifics?"

"I'm younger, that's why."

"When you just ascended to the stage, you spoke informally..."

"At that time, I was the Black Scythe. Wouldn't it be awkward if the Black Scythe suddenly used honorifics?"

"Well, that's true. Haha."

Seo Arin, who had a smiling expression, but it was only for a moment. She erased the smile, as if there was something serious to discuss.

"Hey, Ryumin. I have something I want to ask."

"Go ahead."

"What happened between you and Minjoo? She was saying strange things."

"...What kind of things?"

With a face that seemed awkward even upon further reflection, Seo Arin said, "She asked who Ryumin was, and you acted like you really didn't know. Why did you do that? What happened?"

"Oh, that's... We had a little disagreement."

"So, you're pretending not to know each other because of that?"

"Yes. So, please don't ask any more, and just go along with the flow."

"Ah... I see."

As Seo Arin nodded and turned away, a muffled voice was heard from her thoughts.

Is it a lover's quarrel? Somehow it feels bitter.

Seo Arin sighed, but it was actually Ryumin who felt the bitterness.

'If we had a quarrel, we could reconcile. But now, there's no opportunity for that, is there?'

There was no possibility of reconciliation with Minjoo; they had truly become estranged.

'Can't be helped. We have to move forward for each other.'

After shaking his head once, Ryumin looked for Victor.

"Oh! Black Scythe Lord."

"Black Scythe Lord?"

The expressions of Victor and Sofia visibly brightened upon seeing Ryumin.

Having rescued them from demons before, Ryumin had completely won the favor of the two.

"I want to know the progress of the potions."

"Oh, you mean Life Potions?"

"Yes."

"You currently have 51 Life Potions. Thanks to the materials you provided, Black Scythe Lord, I was able to make this many."

"Thank you. Can I distribute them to people? We might encounter situations where we need to save each other."

"Of course. Would you like me to give them out too?"

"I would appreciate that."

As Victor nodded and tried to take out several potions, Ryumin clapped his hands.

"Just give me one. I don't need more than that."

Life Potions also have a cooldown of one hour, just like resurrection. Having many potions doesn't mean you can revive everyone, indicating the limitation. Sharing them one by one was the best option.

"Additionally, there are healing potions and potions that boost various stats, right? I hope you've also distributed those to people."

"I already made more than enough with that in mind. Haha!"

Smiling along with Victor, Ryumin called people over.

Then, Victor approached and distributed potions of various types one by one.

After finalizing the strategy, Ryumin explained the plan to the group.

"The 20th round is likely to be the round where we face a boss. Regardless of which boss comes out, I'll take it on first. It's better to face unnecessary damage than to let it accumulate."

People nodded in agreement.

It seemed wise to assess the boss's level by having the strongest Black Scythe face it first.

"If the boss is weak, I'll easily defeat it. But if it's not? There's a high chance you won't suffer any significant damage if you don't rush in. So, focus on defense rather than advancing."

In other words, it meant to stay back as rushing forward would only result in a burden.

A bitter smile appeared on the faces of the people.

"For those with long-range attack capabilities, you can provide support from the back. However, for melee classes, it's better not to advance as much and focus on protecting the long-range attackers. I've thought out the tactics, and I'll explain each one now..."

Players listened attentively, as if determined not to miss a single word of Ryumin's explanation.

As they had saved the last round, their determination to conquer was strong.

After explaining for a long time, the briefing finally concluded.

"...That's the end of my explanation. Everyone, make sure to understand the plan well, and if there are any parts you don't know, consult Leader Eom Junseok. Now, let's disperse before the sun sets."

Descending from the stage, Ryumin found two people among the dispersing crowd.

"Yamti, Jon Delgado. Stay back for a moment."

"Yes."

Once the people disappeared, Ryumin began to speak.

"Yamti, your max level skill was boss-level taming, right?"

"Yes."

"Tell me more. What does it say in the description?"

"Exactly, it says that I can tame boss-level monsters. However, it also mentions that it's impossible for monsters above a certain level."

"Do you know what that certain level is?"

"No."

If they could really tame boss-level creatures, it would be helpful. It was almost like adding another player to the team.

"The problem is figuring out up to what level of bosses can be tamed."

They needed to test this.

"The two of you have a place to go with me."

"Yes? Where are we going?"

Ryumin's mouth curled up slightly.

"To the Demon Realm."

Three people appeared in the quiet Demon Castle.

"Ah!"

"..."

Yamti and Jon Delgado had instantly moved to a different space, but what surprised them wasn't for the usual reasons.

[You have left your position during the round.] [If you do not return to the designated area within 1 hour, your player status will be revoked.] [Time remaining until status revocation: 00:59:59]

It was the ominous warning message that caught their attention.

"It, it showed a strange message, Master."

"If you don't return within 1 hour, it says your status will be revoked..."

"I know. I'm looking at the same message."

"What happens if your status is revoked?"
ChatGPT

"As a player, your abilities disappear, and you can escape from the survival game."

"Isn't that a good thing then?"

"But instead, you have to live in the Demon Realm. Can you handle that?"

Upon hearing that, the two fell silent, as if making an unspoken agreement.

At that moment, a certain idea crossed Yamti's mind.

"Oh? Wait a minute. There's a way! Master, if you bring me, who has been revoked, back to reality, we can rescue many people from the survival game..."

"Did you think I haven't considered that? As much as I'd like to, regular people can't warp together. The moment they warp, their bodies can't withstand it and break apart."

"Ah..."

Seeing the disappointed Yamti, Ryumin didn't say it, but it seemed she also wanted to escape from the survival game somehow.

"By the way, why did you bring us to the Demon Realm?"

"I have something to test."

After saying that, Ryumin closed his eyes and stood still.

It was contacting the high-ranking nobles, but Yamti and Jon Delgado, unaware of this, could only look perplexed.

"It's coming soon."

"Yes? Who is coming..."

Suddenly, demons arrived through a portal, revealing one by one.

Starting from 1st Seat Libu to 10th Seat Bifrons, a total of ten high-ranking demons.

"Allow me to introduce them. These are my subordinates."

[Have you called, O King!]

All the demons kneeled and bowed their heads. Seeing the demons' respectful behavior, Yamti and Jon Delgado were taken aback.

They had heard that their owner had become the ruler of the Demon Realm, but witnessing the actual treatment made them realize it.

"Alright, raise your heads."

Ryumin, who gestured as if feeling burdened, commanded the demons to lift their heads.

"Stand in a line, facing this way, not that way."

Pointing to the demons lined up, he spoke to Yamti.

"Now, try taming the one you want from among them."

"Yes? Taming?"

"It says you can tame boss-level creatures."

"But it's written that it only works on monsters..."

"You never know. It might work on these guys too."

In Ryumin's eyes, monsters and demons were almost the same. There might be a difference in intelligence, but it wasn't significant.
ChatGPT

"Taming demons... Are you trying to control them as summoned creatures?"

"Yeah."

"You're already the Demon King. Can't you just warp them here?"

"It doesn't work that way."

He had already attempted to warp demons. If it were possible, he would use them as a force to defeat the 20th-round boss. However, Ryumin could only bring the demon ranked 1st in the Demon Realm, Citri.

"Did you see Citri in the 19th round? I could only bring that one to another dimension. Other demons couldn't."

"Why?"

"Because only the 1st rank can break free from the dimensional restrictions, according to the rules of the Demon Realm."

"But other demons crossed over just fine."

Yamti was referring to the invasion of demons, led by Phlunictos, in the 19th round.

"That was possible thanks to a private route Arthros opened, allowing demons to cross over to the Demon Realm. Now, with the passage closed, it's an impossible situation."

He didn't need to explicitly explain the details.

"It was possible back then, but not now. Just know that."

"Ah..."

"So, I want you to try. See if you can tame demons other than Citri."

If it worked, demons could be used as a force.
