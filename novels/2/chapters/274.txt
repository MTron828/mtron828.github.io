Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 274"

Episode 274: "Encounter with an Unseen Item"

A feast of numerous reward messages.

With a casual glance, and with just one skill, so many messages popped up.

"It's to be expected. After all, I defeated a dragon."

To some, it might seem excessive, but the opponent was a dragon.

Even a party of max-level players would barely be able to defeat the ultimate boss monster, the dragon.

In other words, in the 17 rounds leading up to reaching the max level, it was impossible to defeat this monster.

"Since I managed to defeat it for the first time, it's only natural that rewards are pouring in."

Ryumin scanned the familiar reward messages with a practiced eye.

These were rewards he had already received in the previous rounds.

[Title - Dragon Slayer]

Acquisition Condition: Obtained by defeating a dragon for the first time.

Effect: All stats double when facing dragonkin. Monsters instinctively fear you.

Ryumin didn't really need this title.

He had no plans to hunt dragons in the future, so what use was there in increasing stats against dragonkin?

"Well, it might make hunting monsters easier since they instinctively fear me, but..."

For Ryumin, who had no plans for future hunting, this ability was useless.

The newly acquired rune was no different.

[Memory Rune]

Effect: Never forget anything once seen, remembering everything.

Being already highly intelligent, Ryumin's memory was unmatched.

"Still, they're offering it, so might as well take it."

More than the title and rune, Ryumin's attention was drawn to something else.

[Dragon Slayer's Necklace]

Category: Necklace

Grade: Godly

Effect: All stats +50, Skill damage +50%, Resistance to all elemental damage +30%

Durability: 20,000/20,000

Usage Restriction: Master Grade or higher

Description: A mark given only to the dragon slayer who first killed a dragon. Made from the dragon's claw.

"I finally got it. A godly-grade necklace."

The effects of the godly grade were impressive, living up to its name.

"Increasing stats and skill damage is good, but the increase in elemental damage resistance is quite significant."
ChatGPT

Ryumin couldn't avoid all skills, no matter how skilled he was. Even in a boss battle, when hit by an area-of-effect skill, the outcome was uncertain.

"At times like that, this elemental resistance will be a big help."

The harvest was satisfying, but the rewards didn't end there. From the condensed ether to dragon scales, horns, and even teeth—perhaps due to his high luck stat, various materials emerged.

All of them were materials whose use he didn't know.

"I can't be expected to know the purpose of every material."

Didn't a bunch of unknown materials come out when he used the Infinite Material Pouch last time?

"I don't need condensed ether anymore since I can't create Godly-grade items, and I don't know what to do with dragon-related materials either..."

Though it was frustrating, the fortunate part was that a blueprint emerged.

It was a design he had never seen before in his lifetime.

"Death's Aura? What's this?"

[Design: Death's Aura]

Category: Consumable

Description: An item with six combinations written on it to create Eternal-grade Death's Aura. It's advisable to prepare a memo before using it.

Ryumin's eyes widened upon reading the information.

It stated that he could create an Eternal-grade item, a grade he had never heard of before.

"Eternal grade?"

He might not know, but it was undoubtedly a grade higher than Godly grade.

Wasn't it mentioned in the description of Refined Ether that it could be used to create items of Godly grade or higher?

"Then the materials must definitely contain Refined Ether."

In any case, he had to try making it.

At least there wouldn't be any loss.

"But before that..."

Ryumin turned his head.

He needed to deal with the 21 pairs of eyes that were looking at him with a burdensome expression.

"To defeat a dragon in one blow..."

"Impressive, truly impressive."

"Hey, how about working exclusively for our mercenary group? We'll pay you handsomely."

Ryumin tilted his head, as if there was no need for consideration.

Working under an NPC was out of the question.

"No thanks. Just give me the rewards."

"Well, if you insist."

After a moment, the rewards for dragon subjugation quest were given.

[You have completed the subjugation quest!] [Experience +2.38%] [Gold +100,000]
ChatGPT

Despite the meager rewards, the reason for accepting them was to ensure that the mercenaries would leave.

"Since you've received your rewards, you can leave now."

"I have some business, so I'll leave later."

"Is that so? Then take your time."

The mercenaries left the cave, leaving only Ryumin behind. Being alone posed no problem as there was a warp gate that would appear when retracing the path back to the barracks.

"But before that, let's slowly combine the materials."

Ryumin promptly used the blueprint. Although it suggested preparing a memo, it wasn't necessary. With his high intelligence and the Memory Rune, he could remember everything.

Swoosh—

As the scroll with the design disappeared, golden letters unfolded before his eyes.

["Used the 'Design: Death's Aura.'"] ["You can now create Death's Aura, an Eternal-grade item, using the next combination."] [Main Ingredient]

Dragon scales

[Sub-Ingredients]

Refined Ether

Condensed Ether

Devil's Pendant

Devil's Heart

Murky Energy

"This is...?"

After confirming the materials, Ryumin's eyes lit up.

"They are all the materials I have...!"

As expected, Refined Ether was included among the ingredients. Moreover, the dragon scales and condensed ether were from the item he had just received.

"I already have the Devil's Pendant, and the Devil's Heart and Murky Energy are materials from the Infinite Material Pouch."

Especially the last items mentioned—heart and energy—were initially considered useless, but they weren't.

"It turns out they have incredible utility."

Perhaps the other unfamiliar items from the Infinite Material Pouch could also be used to create Eternal-grade items.

With an excited heart, Ryumin placed all the materials on the combination window.

Although he happened to have the materials, without the blueprint, he wouldn't have been able to make it on his own.

"I didn't even know that the main ingredient was dragon scales."

Realizing the importance of blueprints once again, he pressed the combine button.

[Combining an Eternal-grade item.] [Creating a high-tier item takes time. Please be patient.] [Combining materials...] [Analyzing the user's soul...] [Synchronization in progress...]
ChatGPT

Various unknown messages appeared, dragging on the time, but Ryumin remained patient.

"They mentioned that it would take a while for such a high-tier item."

With the anticipation of obtaining an extraordinary item, he waited with a joyful heart, and the result was:

[Combination Success!] [You have created 'Death's Aura.']

A new item entered his inventory.

[Death's Aura]

Category: Armor

Grade: Eternal

Defense: 5,000

Effects: All stats +200, 50% reduction in all opponent's stats classified as enemies

Durability: Infinite

Usage Restriction: Black Scythe (Soul Bound)

Description: A soul-bound item that exerts influence not on the user's physical body but on the soul. It cannot be transferred to others. It can be applied in conjunction with other equipment items.

Reading the item information with astonished eyes, Ryumin focused on the last sentence.

"It can be worn in conjunction with other equipment? Even with Godly-grade items?"

As it was classified as armor, he needed to unequip his current Tanatos's Black Mage Robe to wear it.

However.

"Wear."

By using the command to wear the item, Death's Aura was equipped without being unequipped, as it replaced Tanatos's Black Mage Robe.

There was no need to check the equipment window.

The immediate changes in his body were noticeable.

A discomforting yet familiar aura flowed from Ryumin's entire body.

It was the effect of wearing Death's Aura, an Eternal-grade item.

"This is no joke."

Even the fact that it could be worn in conjunction with another item was incredible. Not only did his defense increase by 5,000, but all his stats also rose by 200.

Above all, it had the ability to apply a debuff, reducing the stats of enemies classified as opponents by 50%.

"Does that mean it won't affect those I consider allies?"

Strictly speaking, it meant that Ryumin could decide whether or not to apply a debuff to his opponents.

"Nice, isn't it?"

A smile appeared on Ryumin's face.

He obtained an item beyond his expectations.

"If there's armor, there must be other classifications, right?"

Weapons, helmets, gloves, shoes, and more.

He might be able to create items for every body part.

"Since Refined Ether is needed, I can make another one."

Of course, he would need a blueprint, but at the moment, he didn't know where to find one.
ChatGPT

Assuming there are materials, the only option is to try out combinations without a blueprint.

"It's a method akin to manual labor, but there's no other choice."

Ryumin placed the materials on the combination window to attempt creating another Eternal-grade equipment without a blueprint.

Naturally, he included Refined Ether as a sub-ingredient and filled the rest with unfamiliar materials.

Brilliant radiance, dazzling wing feathers, essence of corruption, penetrating gaze, and so on—all were materials from the Infinite Material Pouch.

For the main ingredient, Ryumin experimented by substituting dragon horns and teeth.

[Invalid combination.] [Invalid combination.] [Invalid combination.] [Invalid combination.]

...

But after trying dozens, even hundreds of times, all attempts failed, eventually forcing Ryumin to give up.

"It seems like there should be Condensed Ether in the sub-ingredients."

Refined Ether and Condensed Ether. Given that both were used, it was highly likely they could be included in other Eternal-grade equipment.

"I'll try the combinations after the round ends. We'll receive Condensed Ether as a reward this round."

Not only Ryumin but everyone would receive it.

Then everyone could wear Godly-grade items.

Obtaining other Godly-grade materials wouldn't be difficult.

"But I should focus on creating higher-tier Eternal-grade items."

In the last 100 rounds, he discovered a grade he had never seen before, without knowing the combinations.

"If my Luck stat wasn't this high, I wouldn't have received blueprints."

All of this was a harvest he gained by stacking transcendent stats while defeating Archangels.

He regretted not trying to kill Archangels sooner, but time already passed, and there was no way to turn it back.

"There's no choice. I can only learn from now on."

With such thoughts, Ryumin turned and walked through the cave.

The feeling of exploring an unknown area wasn't so bad.

Suddenly, he wondered if he needed to become stronger than he is now.

"I might face the top-ranked Archangel, and they could be much stronger than I imagine."

It could happen either in this round or the next, but he needed to be prepared for that moment.
ChatGPT

I need to become even stronger.

However, Ryumin didn't have time for that.

Pause—

The encounter happened sooner than expected.

"I've been waiting. Black Scythe."

As Ryumin took a step forward, he instinctively recognized the figure blocking his way.

The one standing in front of him was none other than the top-ranked Archangel.
