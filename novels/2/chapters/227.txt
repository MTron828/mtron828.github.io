Title: "Chapter 227 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player"

Divine Grade Weapons

After the end of the 13th round, Ryu Min's first action upon opening his eyes was to go look for his younger brother.

"Did you have breakfast?"

"Huh? Hyung! You're safe again this time. I was worried because you weren't waking up even after waiting."

It was Ryu Won who, even though it was already 10 in the morning, had just prepared and was eating breakfast belatedly because he was hungry.

"I told you. There's no need to wait."

"But what if I'm worried? What if I wake up after sleeping, and you're not awake? I have to go into the community and refresh to see if other players have woken up, you know?"

The community was an anonymous community where posts related to players were made. For ordinary people, this was the only place to get information about players.

"That's where you get information? Check if it's time for me to come back."

"Yeah. Ordinary people like us can't know the round end time."

'Well, since the end time varies for each round, ordinary people can only wait without any certainty.'

Understanding his brother's frustration, Ryu Min couldn't reveal when the next round would end.

After all, due to his younger brother, the existence of the prophet might be exposed to the outside world.

"You're not posting anything related to me in the community, are you?"

"Of course not. I've never even left a comment."

Seeing his unjustly accused younger brother, Ryu Min felt relieved.

"Well, that's a relief. Anyway, don't worry about me. Is it reasonable for the prophet not to pass the round?"

"But you fight monsters a lot, so I'm worried."

"Did you forget? A year ago, I took care of that gangster, Bang Tae-gyu, with my bare fists."

"He's just an ordinary person. According to the posts on the community, monsters are unbelievably strong."

"I'm strong too."

"By the way, has it already been a year since that incident?"

Ryu Won suddenly felt strange.

At that time, the world was in chaos with 1.8 billion people being taken away, but now he was adapting nonchalantly.

He himself was the same.

At first, he stayed up all night with wide eyes because of his brother's worries, but now he sleeps and eats without any problem.

Still, there was some concern about whether he would get hurt.

'Who worries about whom.'

Reading his brother's thoughts, Ryu Min chuckled and then reached out with a serious expression.

"Just a moment. Don't be surprised."

"Yeah? What's going on?"

Light emanated from Ryu Min's hand and was absorbed into his brother's body as if being sucked in.

"What are you doing?"

"Some kind of protective measure."

In fact, he had cast a hero's protection on his brother.

With this, even if his brother were to be ambushed by a villain, a 10-second invincibility would activate, and an alarm would sound for himself, allowing him to be reassured.

'I'll have to stack up the hero's rune stacks again. There's no rush since there will be an opportunity in Round 16.'

Smiling, Ryu Min sat down at the dining table.

"Get me some food too. Let's eat together."

"Yeah."

After finishing the meal with his brother, Ryu Min returned to his room.

Lying on the bed and looking at the ceiling, he organized his plans for the future.

'My mercenary rank is up to Master. The preparations to defeat the dragon are complete.'

After killing the Archangel and during the remaining time, Ryu Min continued the subjugation quests.

As a result, he could reach the Master rank, but there wasn't enough time to defeat the dragon, so he could only hope for the next opportunity.

'I should catch the dragon in Round 17, which is when I can go to the fantasy world.'

Then he thought about what he could do in the real world after that.

The first thing that came to mind was the combination of Divine-grade weapons.

'Since I remembered, let's start right away.'

He opened the combination window and placed the materials one by one.

[Main Material]

-Corrupted God's Scythe

[Sub-materials]

-Concentrated Ether

-Concentrated Ether

-Black Iron Powder

-Adamantium Plate

-Core of Magic

'I'm glad I bought Divine-grade weapon materials from Heimer in advance.'

Fortunately, Archangels appeared, and he had the Ether he needed.

'Can things really be solved to this extent?'

With a sly smile, he pressed the combination button.

[Combining Divine-grade items.] [It will be transformed into an item suitable for the current occupation.] [Combination successful!] ['Thanatos's Black Scythe' has been created.] [Thanatos's Black Scythe]

-Classification: Weapon

-Grade: Divine

-Attack Power: 4,444
ChatGPT

Effect: The scythe's width can be increased up to 5 times, and its length can be extended up to a maximum of 20 times. However, the damage is dispersed based on the number of targets within the range. Additionally, the weapon is imbued with magical damage equal to 100% of intelligence.

Durability: 20,000/20,000

Usage Restriction: Master Grade or higher

Description: A weapon created using the divine power of the god of death, Thanatos. Grants additional effects when worn as a set item.

It felt like an upgraded version of the sickle-scythe he used to use.

'It's much better. The previous one only had an attack power of 666, and the size increased by only 5 times.'

This time, the attack power is incredibly high at 4,444.

With the scythe's length able to be increased up to 20 times, assuming a scythe length of 2.5m, it could reach up to 50m, allowing him to stab enemies from a considerable distance.

It was also good for sweeping through a large area with the widened surface of the scythe.

'The damage may be dispersed, but it's actually better. I've become unbelievably strong now.'

Ryu Min had become much stronger compared to the previous round.

Since killing the Archangel Remiel, his growth curve had steeply risen.

That's why he felt a bit of regret.

'If I had known, I should have tried killing Archangels sooner.'

Killing an Archangel was a first in this round.

He didn't know he could accumulate such benefits with the blessing of the devil.

'Back then, the goal was to break the round, and there was no room for leisurely dealing with Archangels.'

Above all, the first Archangel he encountered seems to be someone like Michael, who is currently in the top spot.

It was only natural that he didn't have the courage to challenge him.

It was inevitable that he had to kill Remiel due to the appearance of variables, but...

'It's water under the bridge. I can't avoid fighting the Archangels. However, I shouldn't act recklessly and let things unfold as they may.'

Since this was the last opportunity, he needed to be careful with every action.

Set Effect of Thanatos's Attire (5/5)

2 Set Effect: Resistance +20%

3 Set Effect: Skill Damage +10%

4 Set Effect: 30% Reduction in Received Damage

5 Set Effect: All set equipment options +10%

Ryu Min, satisfied after confirming the 5-set option effect, let out a content smile.

It seemed that the options were enhanced by 10% like the equipment Russell provided.

'What if I receive Russell's equipment enhancement on top of this?'

In multiplication, only the options that are improved become 32%.
ChatGPT

This level of stats should be a great help.

'I've obtained all Divine-grade equipment with this. Obtaining Divine-grade accessories can be done gradually by defeating bosses... Now, what should I do in reality? Rune operations?'

There are a total of 5 runes that can be obtained in reality.

Among them, 3 have been acquired, and the remaining 2 need to be obtained.

'One can be obtained in Round 16, and what's urgent now, gathering players?'

Even if the number of players has decreased, there are still about 5,000 players worldwide.

Among them, there are still human scum who oppress ordinary people.

'Certainly, there must be countries that control the military and treat ordinary people as slaves as if they were kings.'

If these scum from such countries were suppressed, bringing freedom to the nation?

It would not only gain the support of other countries but also elevate the reputation of the Black Scythe.

'In doing so, I can bring uncontrollable players under my control. If they are controlled, I can save as many people as possible in Round 15.'

In addition, if he acted under the name of the Cult of Reapers, he could widely spread its influence.

'This time, I won't move quietly like during the IS incident. I'll publicly announce that I will help countries in need, gather information, and then take action.'

It's the foundation he has built for this purpose.

As the Deputy Commander of CPF, and as the judge of justice who eliminated IS.

Now is the time to move from behind the scenes.

'I need the President's help.'

Smirking, Ryu Min searched through Lost Yak's phone to find the Blue House's number.

It was the number he had rejected the President's commendation a while ago.

["Where is Michael?"] ["He went into the Akashic Records to check for news. He said to wait a little longer."]

In response to Raphael's words, Gabriel nodded.

After a while, Michael appeared in the meeting room with light.

["Have you come, Michael?"] ["Have you been waiting long?"] ["No. By the way, the news..."]

Michael, with a solemn expression, raised his head, creating an atmosphere of tension.

With just that gesture, Gabriel and Raphael couldn't help but be surprised.

Since the assumption that the assassination would fail was not in their minds.
ChatGPT

["Even Raphael and Uriel failed..."] ["Is it true? Michael? Is there some mistake...?"] ["It's certain. I'm on my way back after directly checking the records in the Akashic Records on how Raphael and Uriel died. Despite engaging in a fierce battle, they ultimately lost."]

The phrase "fierce battle" was a lie.

'In fact, it was overwhelmingly one-sided. Even I didn't expect such combat power.'

Contrary to expectations, the Black Scythe was powerful.

Yet, he hid the fact that he was overwhelmingly defeated by the Archangels.

It would be troublesome if he mentioned it carelessly and then had to insist that he had to take care of the Black Scythe.

'It's better to say that I struggled. If I step forward, I can only kill the Black Scythe.'

Ideally, he shouldn't be the one to step forward.

The desire to cut open the goose's belly that lays the golden egg had not yet arisen.

With a still somber expression, Michael continued.

["Not only them, but also 200 fifth-grade angels died."] ["Fifth-grade angels? Did Raphael and Uriel take soldiers with them?"] ["Perhaps they tried to handle it secretly among themselves. In the end, they were all wiped out."] ["It was unexpectedly strong. The Black Scythe, that is."]

Gabriel, who spoke thus, fell into deep thought.

He seemed to be contemplating a countermeasure.

'This is a big problem. Gabriel's strategy is something no one can withstand.'

Even the Black Scythe, who overwhelmingly defeated the Archangels, could be in danger if Gabriel genuinely steps forward.

The victory in the fifth Demon-Angel War 200 years ago was due to Gabriel's cunning.

'Although I contributed a lot, in a way, Gabriel could be considered the hero of the last war.'

The higher-ups are already paying attention to Gabriel's possible role in the upcoming seventh Demon-Angel War.

As much as expectations were placed on him, if Gabriel sincerely steps forward, the Black Scythe may no longer be protectable.

'I never thought the situation would lead to Gabriel taking action. Unexpectedly, the Black Scythe dealt with the Archangels too quickly.'

A solution needs to be found.

A way to prevent Gabriel from stepping forward.

At that moment, Raphael broke the silence and spoke.

["Michael, this won't do. It seems it's our turn now."] ["It seems so."] ["Rather than dragging it out, how about we all descend to the human realm at once and kill the Black Scythe?"] ["Including me?"] ["Yes."]
ChatGPT

In response to Raphael's suggestion, Michael deliberately expressed dissatisfaction.

["Do I have to step forward just to catch such a pest? As the heavens above the heavens, should I?"] ["But it might be difficult with just me and Gabriel..."] ["Surprising. The 2nd and 3rd Archangels are afraid of just one human."] ["I'm not afraid; it's just a suggestion to decisively resolve the matter."] ["Even so, my pride won't allow me to step forward."] ["But..."] ["Stop it, Raphael."]

Gabriel, who had finished his thoughts, interrupted Raphael.

["There's no need for Michael to step forward. Moreover, neither of us will."] ["What do you mean, Gabriel? You won't step forward?"]

When Michael asked with a surprised look, Gabriel explained the stratagem he had come up with.

To maintain the appearance of surprise, Michael had to manage his expression as best as possible.

That's how effective and fatal the stratagem was against the Black Scythe.

'This is a big problem. If they really use that operation, the Black Scythe...'

The end of the grand act might come with the conclusion of Round 14.

["What do you think, Michael? Shall we proceed with the operation right away?"] ["Hmm, not a bad plan."] ["I'll take that as acceptance and proceed."] ["Sure. I'll make sure to inform Nemesis."] ["Thank you."]

'Oh no... This is serious. This time, it might really be dangerous, Black Scythe.'

The other Archangels couldn't see Michael's troubled expression.
