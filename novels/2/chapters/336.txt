Title: Regression 100th Episode of a Max Level Player

Episode 336: Final Round Ends

"Cheating!"

Chaos quickly changed dimensions, twisting the paths to evade the approaching moonlight islands, which followed like guided missiles. Dodging the five moonlight islands in this manner, Chaos managed to avoid them all, but Ryu Min smiled.

"At least I succeeded in confusing him."

He had expected Chaos to be affected by the confirmed damage against the dark attribute. However, contrary to his expectations, Chaos somehow managed to evade by folding dimensions.

"But it seems to have some effect, judging by the bewildered expression."

Although Chaos had suffered no damage, the fact that there was now a way to inflict damage was meaningful. It was also significant that Ryu Min temporarily halted the enemy's attack.

"What was that attack just now? How did it track my location in a human-themed area...?"

Chaos asked, but Ryu Min remained silent. His focus was solely on exterminating the demons; he had no time to spare.

"No time. I need to finish this game as quickly as possible."

While restraining Chaos with a 5-combo of moonlight islands, Ryu Min killed a thousand demons along the path.

However, over a hundred thousand demons still remained.

[Remaining Personnel Status]

└ Celestials: 73,289 (72.62% survival)

└ Demons: 124,458 (43.96% survival)

└ Players: 1

Glancing at the progress window, Ryu Min saw the demon count decreasing in real-time.

"The number of demons has decreased significantly. At this rate, we can reduce it to below 10% soon, but..."

He wondered what would happen if Chaos intervened.

"Should I impose more restraint?"

Clearly, the scythe cutting through the darkness was undoubtedly consumed by Chaos. Although it wasn't confirmed damage, the attack seemed to track his location like a guided missile. Even so, Chaos could twist dimensions to evade the damage.

"Restraint seems meaningless in the current situation. Remember when he summoned the spear of instant death even while using phase shift."

Right now, ending the game takes precedence over attacking Chaos.

Chaos knows that if it's not now, there won't be another chance, so he is desperately trying to block Ryu Min.

"I need to kill the demons faster."

Ryu Min gathered the demons in one place using the authority of the Demon King. Then, he used area-of-effect skills to eliminate them all.

"Heavenly Judgment."

"Avalanche."

"Area Discharge."

He utilized runes of lightning and shot black daggers as well. He unleashed all the area-of-effect skills he knew, desperately trying to kill them.

However, Chaos, who had discovered Ryu Min's location, couldn't just watch quietly.

"You thunderous monkey! Your rampage ends now!"

The summoned spear of instant death was immediately aimed at Ryu Min.

Sssaaak-

With a sound, the thrown spear changed its trajectory and accurately pierced into Ryu Min's heart as he moved.

No, it would be more accurate to say it went in as if being absorbed.

"Received a lethal attack." "Rune of Knight's Revival is activated." "Reflecting the target's attack."

The reflection ability that had thrown Chaos into confusion activated. It returned directly to the owner across space, but Chaos was unfazed.

"Are you going to get hit by the same attack twice?"

Having already experienced the reflection ability, Chaos folded dimensions once and skillfully avoided the attack.

Then, he summoned the spear of instant death once again.

"Now, you can't avoid it."

Chaos, with a crescent moon-like smirk, thrust the spear straight at Ryu Min.

"Die, human."

With an unstoppable force, the spear stabbed into Ryu Min.

Did he already know that it was unavoidable?

Ryu Min, without any resistance, swung the scythe until the end, cutting down the demons.

Even until the moment the spear pierced his heart.

Swoosh-

"Kook!"

Crimson blood flowed out of Ryu Min's mouth, and his body stopped moving.

Thud-

The spear disappeared, leaving only a pierced corpse in its place.

It was the end of the wielder of the black scythe.

"Kuh, kuhuhuhuhut! Kahaha! Finally, you're dead, Gaia's plaything! Kuhuhuhuhu! What kind of weapon dies with a single spear thrust? Stupid pawn!"
ChatGPT

Chaos babbled on, but he didn't know.

Ryu Min had one more life left.

[Last Time Reverser Title Activated.] [Remains in soul state for 1 minute.] [Can revive with full health at desired timing.] [Do you want to resurrect now? Y/N] [Remaining time: 00:00:59] [Resurrection opportunity disappears when time limit ends.]

The resurrection title obtained right at the beginning.

It shone at a crucial moment.

"If I didn't have this title, I would have died without a chance. Or was it thanks to Sophia saving me in the boss room?"

If it wasn't for Sophia's sacrifice, he wouldn't be here now.

Nevertheless, he gained a bit of time.

Though it felt unpleasant to look at his own corpse.

"It seems becoming a god was real. Seeing the crimson blood flowing."

He looked away from his body and stared at Chaos.

"I don't feel like resurrecting right away. Laugh as much as you want. You won't be able to laugh in a moment."

Chaos continued to burst into laughter as if he thought he had truly killed Ryu Min.

"Laugh all you want. You won't be able to laugh soon."

He might be surprised as if he saw a ghost, but Ryu Min had no intention of resurrecting immediately.

"I have to delay as much time as possible before resurrecting. That way, I can reduce the number of demons a bit more."

Even in the midst of his death, the war between Celestials and demons continued.

No, it was more like a massacre than a war.

Although it was a pitiful sight for the demons, it couldn't be helped for the sake of clearing the game.

"I'll wait until the last second to resurrect."

It's not over until it's over.

Hoping for the demons to die as much as possible, Ryu Min watched the remaining time.

[Remaining time: 00:00:01]

As soon as the time came, he touched the resurrection message.

Shaaa-

As his dead body revived, Ryu Min's perspective changed from third-person to first-person.

"Huh?"

Chaos, who never expected Ryu Min to resurrect, widened his eyes.

"H-How did you come back to life?"

Without bothering to answer, Ryu Min immediately rushed towards the demons.

Squelch- Squelch!

Swinging the scythe widely for a massive massacre, Ryu Min shifted his attention to the progress window.

"Now, only 70,000 more to go."

It was almost down to less than 10%.

As Ryu Min went on a final sprint, Chaos had no room to be surprised.

"Even if you resurrect, it's meaningless! I'll end it if you die again!"

The spear of instant death appeared once again and struck Ryu Min's body.

But Ryu Min still had a cherished hidden card.

"Invincible."

His body shone with a golden light as the temporary skill, invincibility, was activated.

[Temporary skill 'Invincible' activated.] [Immune to all damage for 60 seconds.] [You have used a disposable skill.] [The skill disappears from the skill window.]

The spear of instant death, capable of killing anyone, couldn't penetrate the invincibility and bounced away.

"I-I blocked it with invincibility?"

Ignoring Chaos's bewildered voice, Ryu Min massacred the demons without any interference.

Empowered by invincibility, he freely wreaked havoc without anyone to stop him.

As the game neared its end with 10 seconds left, the moment to finish the game arrived.

"Just need to take this down. Only this!"

"Oh, no!"

Chaos tried to throw the spear of instant death to stop Ryu Min, but it was futile.

No matter how many spears came, invincibility repelled all attacks.

"It's working perfectly."

Smiling, Ryu Min was able to defeat the demons as much as he had aimed for.

[Demon forces have decreased to less than 10%.] [The 7th Heaven-Demon War concludes with a victory for the Celestial faction.]

The moment victory was confirmed, a light flashed before Ryu Min's eyes.

A brilliant, iridescent stone was within arm's reach.

"This is it."

Even without anyone guiding him, he instinctively knew.

This was the clear reward for the final round.

A wish-granting wishing stone.

[The duration of the temporary skill 'Invincible' has ended.]

Instantly, the invincibility wore off, and almost simultaneously, a scream-like outcry echoed.

"You can't touch that thing, you wretch!"

The sky's space opened, and numerous spears emerged, aiming for Ryu Min's head.
ChatGPT

Ryu Min, who was reaching for the wishing stone, instinctively gave a command.

"Block it!"

Thousands of battle angels nearby rushed like goalkeepers.

However, the guided spears skillfully avoided obstacles, charging toward their target.

Although the angels' blocking wasn't meaningless.

Thud-

Thanks to buying time, Ryu Min's hand reached the wishing stone without delay.

[Player 'Black Scythe' enters the Wish Room.]

"Where is this?"

A completely white space with nothing visible.

Ryu Min, who had been restless, looked at his own body.

"My soul?"

His body was transparent like a soul.

Moreover, it wasn't the customized appearance of the black scythe.

Though he couldn't see his face, it seemed to resemble his real form.

"Has the avatar of the other world been abandoned now?"

The black scythe, which had felt like a real body, disappeared, leaving a somewhat regretful feeling.

"Anyway, I really entered. The Wish Room."

Originally, he didn't expect to be able to kill Chaos.

Ryu Min's goal so far was to touch the wishing stone and enter the Wish Room.

Up to this point, everything went according to the plan.

"As Rubahi said, now the system message should appear."

Sure enough.

[Hello. Welcome to the Wish Room.] [If you have any questions, feel free to ask.] [Whether you ask with your thoughts or verbally, it doesn't matter. I will answer sincerely.]

A message appeared before him, and a clear voice echoed.

Relieved by the expected situation, Ryu Min threw a simple question as a test.

"Where is this?"

[This is the Wish Room, accessible only to those who have touched the wishing stone. Tell me your wish, and I will calculate its value and let you know if it's possible.]

"You calculate the value and tell me if it's possible? Didn't you say you would grant any wish?"

[I never said such a thing.]

Certainly, according to the angels, they claimed that any wish would be granted.

But now, facing the situation, it was either the angels lied or they didn't know the function of the wishing stone. It had to be one of the two.
ChatGPT

Perhaps if it were someone else, they would have felt like they were struck in the back of the head, but Ryu Min, who had heard it from Rubahi, already knew.

That the value determined the level of the wish.

Knowing this, he still asked to confirm.

"What does 'value' mean?"

[It refers to the contribution you made to the victory in the Final Round of the war. This value determines the size of your wish.]

"So, you mean the wish changes based on the contribution in the final round."

[That's correct.]

'Even in the 18th round, there was something called contribution.'

Ryu Min asked straightforwardly.

"So, what's my contribution score?"

[Converted to points, it is 382,291,481.]

"About 4 billion, huh? What kind of wish can I fulfill with that score?"

[The converted value is quite high. Most wishes, such as creation or destruction, are possible.]

"Can I kill a god then? For example, like Chaos."

[It is not possible. The target cannot be removed.]

At the immediate response, Ryu Min burst into a bitter laugh.

'Well, it's a being that created the system along with Gaia, so it's impossible for it to die.'

Even he found the question ridiculous.

"Then what about other gods? Like those Nick or Moros types."

[You can kill them, but only one is possible.]

"Just one? Huh, it's better to do it myself."

Ryu Min chuckled, thinking about his comrades.

"What about resurrecting people who have died so far?"

[It is possible. However, with the current value you have, you can only resurrect about 382,291 people.]

18 billion people died, and he could only save about 382,000 with his current value.

"What about gaining the power to kill Chaos?"

"What about weakening Chaos?"

He threw various wishes, but the system repeated that it was impossible.

It seemed that the system thoroughly excluded any wishes related to Chaos.

Ryu Min sighed as if there was no choice.

'As promised with Rubahi, I can only proceed with the plan.'

It's uncertain whether the wish will pass.

With a determined expression, Ryu Min asked, "Is this also possible? Turning back time with memories intact."
