Title: Episode 326 of the 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player

Weakness of Chaos

"Maybe I should keep one just in case the situation arises where I need it."

After leaving one dominant position, Ryu Min looked around at the people.

Now, there was no one engaging in crazy actions attacking allies.

Except for the few who regained their senses through the dominant position, most were just unconscious.

"Perhaps because they were all resurrected with the potion of life, there are no dead people."

Since everyone had a potion in hand, there was no problem in reviving them.

However, the number of people was too small.

"28 people are unconscious, and only 44 remain..."

Although their power was greatly diminished, there was more a sense of frustration than regret.

"Can we really defeat Chaos just because we have more people?"

Even if there were hundreds or thousands more survivors than now, could they kill that existence in the sky?

The primordial being called the god among gods?

Ryu Min thought it was unlikely.

[It was a good decision to minimize damage by making allies unconscious. However,]

Wuuung-

As 72 spaces opened in the sky, crimson spears appeared.

[Let's see if we can dodge the spears of mortality.]

"Everyone, dodge!"

Ryu Min urgently shouted, but the spears had already fallen.

Thud, thud, thud!

"Koah!"

"Crack!"

"Heoack!"

What fell like a rain of arrows precisely pierced through the foreheads and penetrated into the abdomens.

Those who were unconscious could not avoid it, and their heads exploded as they died.

A terrifying scene where numerous people became a pitiful sight in an instant.

However, not everyone experienced that fate.

"Heoack, I-I'm alive."

"M-Me too."

Some managed to twist their bodies and avoid it, while others were able to save their lives thanks to their summoned creatures acting as shields.

"S-Samduyong...!"

"Krrrrrrr...."

Witnessing the appearance of the dead Samduyong on behalf of its owner, Yanti did not shed tears.

She only directed her anger towards the giant eyeball and issued attack orders.

"Harpies! Kill that guy!"

The harpies that soared into the air extended their talons towards the eye of Chaos.

At that moment, the people watching the attack widened their eyes.

The harpies had passed through as if crossing a wave.

"To think they would try to attack me with such feeble creatures. It's ridiculous."

Although only their eyes were visible, Chaos was clearly mocking.

"You cannot attack me. No, it would be more accurate to say that your attacks do not reach me."

"An opponent that our attacks don't reach..."

Despair spread through the faces of the surviving players like cancer cells.

"Still, don't expect praise. That so many humans have survived the spears of mortality is surprising."

Certainly, on the ground, there were many people standing despite Chaos's words.

"Out of 72, 30 have survived."

While Ryu Min could easily evade at this speed, it was unexpected that others, too, managed to survive.

"Anyone with a potion of life! Please revive this person."

"Me! I have one."

As people actively moved to resurrect even the dead, the number of survivors increased.

The cooperative effort looked good, but Ryu Min's expression remained grim.

There was no visible hope.

"Reviving the dead is just a temporary solution. It only buys us a little time."

However, not reviving them was not an option either.

There was nothing else they could do.

"We need to buy time. Until a way to salvage the situation comes to mind."

For that, they needed an invincibility skill.

Ryu Min urgently searched for Kristin.

"Kristin! How much time is left on the cooldown for Protect Cell?"

"3, 30 minutes."

"Ugh..."

The number that came out was enough to make him sigh.

"Do we have to endure for 30 minutes to use the overall invincibility? Half of us are already dead, and we're supposed to endure with what?"

Even if they endure, the time available for the overall invincibility is only a few seconds.

"Darn it. We can't attack Chaos either."

It seemed that Chaos was immune to attacks, as evidenced by the harpies' unsuccessful assault.

It was truly a hopeless situation.

Stimulating such a being recklessly might lead to an even more powerful counterattack.

"A situation where we can't do this or that."
ChatGPT

As if they couldn't afford to stay still, the surviving people launched attacks towards Chaos.

"Eat this, you bastard!"

"Die!"

Arrows, spells, thrown weapons, and more.

People capable of long-range attacks attacked the floating eyeball in their own ways, but it was all in vain.

It shimmered like a hologram, effortlessly passing through to the other side.

"Did you not hear my words even with your ears? Your attacks are useless, aren't they?"

Of course, they knew it was futile.

However, the people didn't stop their attacks.

It was all they could do.

"Darn it, Chaos's gaze has become intense."

Seeing the abruptly fierce gaze, Ryu Min had a gut feeling.

Chaos, whose demeanor had become uncomfortable, was about to unleash another attack.

"I don't want to provoke it, but there's no other way."

Ryu Min, who had considered about three methods, decided to stake everything on one of them and flew towards Chaos.

Meanwhile, Chaos furrowed its brow as if annoyed by the attacks of tiny beings like gnats.

"Annoying humans. Just die."

The death sentence was pronounced.

Once again, space opened, and as many spears of mortality appeared as there were remaining people.

Shoooosh!

The raining spears mercilessly pierced the remaining individuals.

Some managed to anticipate the timing and avoid the attack, but they were only a few.

"Ugh!"

"Kooeok!"

The group of around thirty people was reduced to half.

Among the dead was Seo Arin.

She had sacrificed her summoned creature to save others but failed to protect herself.

"Arin!"

Thanks to the sacrifice of the Soul Knight, Minjuri survived and hurriedly ran towards her.

Fortunately, only her heart was pierced, so her body was relatively intact.

As Minjuri took out a potion of life and used it, Seo Arin opened her eyelids.

"Huh... Minjuri?"

"Are you awake?"

"Yes. What about the others...?"

"Thanks to Seo Arin, we survived. Both of us. Thank you so much."

"Ah, that's a relief."

Although Seo Arin briefly smiled, it didn't last long.

Looking up, Chaos was once again opening a space.

"It's too early to be relieved that we're alive. If it attacks again, and if the attacks continue, all of you will eventually die without a single one left..."
ChatGPT

Chaos interrupted its words in an instant.

It was to avoid the sudden attack of the Moonlight Island.

Quaquaquaquack-!

The shock was so immense that the interior of the temple vibrated.

But Ryu Min was quietly disappointed.

"To leave not even a trace of dust..."

Even with an attack infused with tens of millions of stats, the boss room did not crumble.

"But one attempt is not enough."

Ryu Min's gaze, glowing red, targeted Chaos and the temple behind it.

[It must be useless...]
Chaos projected space without finishing the sentence.

The Moonlight Island passing through it struck the temple's wall.

Once, twice, thrice, four times.

Quaquaquaquack-!

Quaquaquaquack-!

Quaquaquaquack-!

Kukukukukukung-!

In an attempt to possibly blow up the temple, Ryu Min consecutively launched the Moonlight Island five times.

However.

Thud-

Only a bit of dust fell, and no further damage occurred.

"Ugh, can't break through and escape, huh?"

Ryu Min's first thought for a solution was to escape the boss room.

He had tried this method, thinking that if he destroyed the wall, they could escape unharmed, but his hopes were dashed.

Still, there was some achievement.

Namely, Ryu Min discovered Chaos's weakness.

"That thing... Even though it says attacking is useless, it mysteriously interrupts talking as soon as the attack hits."

Perhaps Chaos is not exposed to attacks during the use of skills or conversation?

So it intentionally interrupts communication before the Moonlight Island hits?

From that assumption, Ryu Min attempted the second solution.

"If this assumption is correct, I should be able to inflict damage on that guy."

While others may not know, Ryu Min's body was filled with divine power.

As the only being capable of harming the gods, Chaos must have sensed a threat.

Therefore, it projected space to avoid the Moonlight Island before it hit.

"You act arrogant like a human. Do you think your attacks can reach me?"

"If they can't, why are you getting so worked up? It's strange."

"Your arrogant behavior itself irritates me."
ChatGPT

"What did I do to trigger this?"

[Such arrogance...]

Before Chaos could finish speaking, Ryu Min's scythe struck like lightning.

It was a counterattack aimed at the timing of speech, but Chaos's reaction seemed quicker as the scythe passed through.

"You interrupted me?"

"Did I? You're the one who interrupted first out of fear."

[You figured it out, didn't you? I cannot use phase transition while I'm speaking.]

It seemed that phase transition was some form of evasion technique.

[Nevertheless, it's futile. Even if you're fast, it's a technique you can evade only 0.1 seconds earlier. That's why you can't reach me.]

"Is that so? But..."

Ryu Min raised his scythe.

"I can still make it so you can't attack."

Using the amplification skill, Ryu Min increased the flow of electricity throughout his body and unleashed a rapid series of attacks at an incredible speed.

Shoosh-shoosh-shoosh-shoosh-shoosh!

Hovering in the air, he delivered hundreds of scythe strikes, pummeling Chaos's eye as if pulverizing it.

From Chaos's perspective, it felt frustrating.

There was no chance to speak while evading with the phase transition.

Shoosh-shoosh-shoosh-shoosh-shoosh!

Shoosh-shoosh-shoosh-shoosh-shoosh!

Despite the extremely fast attacks, Chaos suffered no significant damage.

No matter how much Ryu Min increased his speed, it was the same.

With the phase transition technique, it evaded all the attacks.

"So, the claim about being able to evade 0.1 seconds earlier was true."

Although all the attacks missed, Ryu Min laughed.

At least he had bought some time, preventing Chaos from attacking.

However, Ryu Min overlooked a crucial fact.

[Black Scythe!]

It was none other than Arthros.

"Oh, no. I should have dealt with that guy..."

Despite sealing the technique, Arthros possessed physical abilities similar to Ryu Min.

If left alone, he could annihilate Ryu Min's allies quietly.

Immediately, Ryu Min used the runic chains to restrict Arthros's movements.

Shalalalak-

Arthros, who was about to move opportunistically, found himself in a helpless situation once again.

However, his actions were not entirely in vain.

The moment he paused to use the chains, Chaos seized the opportunity to attack.

[Tear that human apart! Kill him now!]

As space opened, an enormous spear of mortality appeared, unlike anything seen before.
ChatGPT

The size of the spear was such that if it hit directly, it could tear the body apart and cause fatal damage.

However, Ryu Min did not evade the spear.

Instead, he took the hit as if to show off.

It was to return it to Chaos.

[Received an attack leading to death.] [Rune of Knight's Revival is activated.] [Reflecting the attacker's assault.]

This was the third solution Ryu Min had in mind.
