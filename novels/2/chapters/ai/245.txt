Title: "Level 100 Player's 245th Regression - Episode 245"

Day by Day

"I need some more time to think."

"What?"

"I can't make a decision right now."

Ryumin did not reject Minjuri's confession.

He postponed it, saying he needed time.

"If I reject her here, Minjuri's mental state won't recover easily."

Courageous, yet filled with anticipation, it was a confession with some expectations.

But what if he firmly rejects her?

Wouldn't it crumble down like a sandcastle, causing disappointment?

What if her mental state shatters?

Can he survive until Round 20?

Ryumin's thoughts were skeptical.

"Maybe I'll even turn my back on the Black Scythe."

For Minjuri, rejection is the worst outcome.

It might have a negative impact on both Ryumin and the Black Scythe.

That's why he hoped to delay the confession as much as possible.

"But it seems like it'll be today...."

Deciding that an immediate rejection could be the worst choice, he chose to postpone.

It was the best decision for both of them.

"You want more time...?"

"Yeah. It's too sudden... I need time to organize my thoughts."

"...Okay. Take your time. Let me know when you're ready to answer."

With those words, Minjuri stood up and left the cafe without looking back.

Watching her leave, Ryumin tilted his head.

"What did I do wrong?"

In a quiet room.

Ryumin's gaze absentmindedly fixed on the wall clock.

Tick-tock - Tock!

The clock's minute hand precisely pointed to 12 o'clock.

"In 12 hours, Round 15 will begin...."

Ryumin, looking at his phone, became lost in thought.

"The one who regrets should contact first, right?"

He reviewed the messages exchanged with Minjuri.

-3 weeks ago-

[Minjuri: Have you made up your mind?] [Ryumin: Not yet....] [Minjuri: I'll be waiting for your answer.]

-2 weeks ago-

[Minjuri: Ryumin, do you need more time to think?] [Ryumin: Uh, please wait a bit longer.]

-1 week ago-
ChatGPT

[Minjuri: What about the answer?] [Ryumin: Ah, just a little more.] [Minjuri: It's been over two weeks. Still not ready?] [Ryumin: Sorry. I want to make a careful decision.]

Three weeks ago.

Since Minjuri unexpectedly confessed, Ryumin had been avoiding giving an answer.

And now, on the day with 12 hours left until Round 15, Ryumin had to make a decision.

"I have to somehow meet her today."

There's no more time to procrastinate.

"I should tell her the strategy for Round 15 and give her the Invisibility Potion...."

In the name of the Black Scythe, Ryumin shared the strategy with the followers of the Sasin Religion.

He also gave Invisibility Potions to Seo Arin and Yamti.

"Minjuri is the only one who hasn't heard the strategy."

Minjuri did not even attend the regular gatherings of the Sasin Religion.

It indicated her mentally unstable state.

"Did I delay it too much?"

Although he felt sorry, it was better than bluntly rejecting her.

Otherwise, Minjuri's mental state might really break down.

"By avoiding the answer like this, Minjuri must have felt it. That I am avoiding the rejection."

Unless she's a fool, she'll know.

With some sense, she'll know.

Because there's such a thing as intuition.

"But still, persistently asking is probably because she wants a definite answer like yes or no."

However, he didn't have the courage to say it.

While in this pending state, there might be some hope, but what if he rejects her?

Wouldn't it eliminate even that hope?

"If I reject her, it might get even more serious. She might not even talk to me at all."

Well, it doesn't matter in the context of the real world.

As long as the relationship with the Black Scythe doesn't get disrupted.

"I want to maintain our current camaraderie, but I'm afraid Minjuri, after hearing the rejection, might not be mentally okay...."

That was what he feared.

Losing Minjuri as a comrade.

Losing Minjuri as a friend.

"Anyway, I have to suggest meeting today. If I delay it more, there won't be time...."

At that moment, a message popped up on Ryumin's phone.

[Minjuri: I want to meet.]

Ryumin immediately replied.

[Ryumin: Sure, let's meet. How about the cafe we met before 2 PM?] [Minjuri: Sounds good.]

"I wanted to meet her anyway, but she contacted me first."

With a sly smile, Ryumin put on his coat.

Perfect time to have coffee, 1:30 PM in the afternoon.

Normally, the cafe would have been bustling, but the inside was calm.

The view through the showcase was not much different from the outside.

"I've changed a lot about the survival games."

Now, finding a young person on the street in Seoul is harder than finding Mr. Kim.

All cafes had been converted to unmanned.

"It's actually better. It's quiet for serious conversations."

Despite sending persistent but non-demanding messages, Minjuri was rejected every time.

That's why today, there was a kind of determination in Minjuri's eyes.

"Today, I will definitely hear the answer."

A resolution to hear the answer regarding Ryumin's confession.

Of course, Minjuri was not a fool.

She knew that Ryumin had subtly hinted at the answer.

"I may already know the result. But still...."

Even so, she wanted to hear the answer from Ryumin's mouth.

Otherwise, she couldn't escape from this prolonged torture of hope.

"Maybe he'll reject me...."

Her thoughts were complicated, but it was okay.

She had plenty of time to think, and that's why she came to the meeting place early.

Ding-

When the cafe door opened, the face of the man she loved for four years appeared.

Ryumin, a high school classmate she had been secretly in love with for four years.

Since she had gathered the courage, she wouldn't give up now.

"Did you come?"

"Uh, you're early?"

"Yeah."

"Well, what do you want to drink? I'll buy."

"No, I can't let you treat me forever. I'll pay, sit down. Double espresso, right? With an extra shot."

"Uh-huh."

As Ryumin brought the coffee, Minjuri accepted it with a somewhat flustered expression.

"Here."

"Thank you."

The two sat in silence, just drinking their coffee.

"Oh, what should I do? Now that I'm about to ask, I can't find the courage."

It was frightening, but she had to do it.

Even if she heard a rejection.

Minjuri mustered up the courage, and her mouth opened.

"Um... do you have something to say to me?"

"Oh."

Ryumin let out a somewhat awkward laugh.

No, would it be more accurate to say it was a perplexed laugh?

"Do you want to hear the answer to the question you asked before?"

"Yeah."

"Sorry, but I need more time...."

"Again?"

As she tried to postpone the answer again, she found herself unexpectedly tearing up.
ChatGPT

"How much more time do you need?"

"...."

"Three weeks wasn't enough? That should be plenty of time to organize your thoughts."

"It's not something I can decide so easily..."

"Ryumin!"

Minjuri, who shouted, looked directly into Ryumin's eyes.

"Stop dragging it out and make a decision. How long do you plan to keep dragging it out? Don't you realize this is causing me even greater pain? It's like enduring the torture of hope."

"...."

"While you were buying time, I've also thought a lot. Whether there is any falsehood in my feelings towards you. Whether it's just a fleeting flame."

Minjuri's gaze was extremely serious.

"But the more I think about it, the more I become convinced. My decision was not wrong. Even if I regret it, I need to let you know my feelings clearly."

Everything is difficult in the beginning.

Minjuri, who once opened her heart, now didn't hesitate to express her feelings.

"So, now I want to hear it. Your sincere feelings. I can't wait any longer."

"...."

"Answer me. Do you like me?"

Ryumin lifted his head and spoke with a serious expression.

"I do."

Minjuri was surprised by the answer, but only for a moment.

"But I like you as a friend, not romantically."

With a firm rejection, Minjuri's expression stiffened.

It was the expected answer, but hearing it felt like being stabbed in the heart with a dagger.

"I'm sorry. It's not the answer I was hoping for."

"Oh, no. I appreciate your honesty."

"...."

"...."

Silence settled between them again.

The silence was more awkward than before, making it difficult to breathe.

"It hurts."

This is what it feels like to be rejected by someone you've been in love with.

Minjuri didn't know what else to say.

Her mind felt blank as if someone had pressed a reset button.

In the midst of the awkward atmosphere, Ryumin broke the silence first.

"I'm sorry. But you're a really good friend to me. Someone I don't want to lose."

"...."

"So, can we forget about this and continue being friends like before?"

'Friends?'

It felt awkward.
ChatGPT

Not long ago, the words that felt so close now seemed distant.

"Can we really continue as casually as before? Pretend the confession never happened?"

Minjuri felt uncertain.

Perhaps she had opened Pandora's box.

She wondered if Ryumin was right in constantly delaying the answer.

"Juri."

"Yeah?"

"Because there's no answer. Are we still friends?"

"Um, yeah. Friends, friends."

Minjuri suddenly became curious.

Is there a case where someone confessed and got rejected, but then returned to being friends?

Is it right to go back to being friends as if the recent events were erased from memory?

"I'm relieved. I'm glad we can remain friends."

"...."

"Okay, now I'll tell you the strategy for Round 15."

"Uh, sure...."

Minjuri, confused by the fact that her confession seemed to be forgotten, was in disarray.

"Did I hear it correctly?"

Ryumin, who had parted ways with Minjuri, felt uneasy for no reason.

Throughout the explanation of the strategy, he showed signs of being unable to concentrate.

"I had no choice but to reject the confession because there was no sign of stepping back...."

He wasn't sure if he did the right thing.

Minjuri's complex thoughts about whether they could go back to being friends echoed in his mind.

"Well, whatever. As long as we conquer the rounds, that's all that matters."

He had provided Invisibility Potions and explained the strategy for Round 15.

Even though rejecting the confession would be difficult for Minjuri, she had no choice but to move forward for survival.

"Honestly, I even thought about using the Memory Erasure Potion. But it's a bit too precious to use it to erase a confession."

Contrary to his concerns, Minjuri didn't seem as shocked.

Erasing memories wasn't necessary.

"With time, Minjuri will probably heal and move on, just like before."

With that in mind, Ryumin returned home and lay down on his bed five minutes before midnight.

And as midnight struck, he unknowingly closed his eyes.

When he finally opened his eyes, a completely different world unfolded before him.

"It's the start of Round 15."

People gradually appear in the monochrome space.

Ryumin stands still, mentally reviewing the tasks for this round.

"The core members who received the Invisibility Potion should have no problem with the first mission, and the second mission can be easily handled by utilizing the Desperation Cultists. And in the third mission, regardless of anything, Kristin's performance is crucial."

With the temporary healing skill received, protecting Kristin shouldn't be a problem.

Berbera also intends to monitor closely, so unexpected events are less likely to occur.

"But the variable for this round is the angels...."

It's uncertain when the Archangel will appear again.

They might intervene with the players as they did last time.

"I shouldn't let my guard down."

While staying vigilant of the surroundings.

"Oh, hello, Master of the Black Scythe."

Someone approaches and greets Ryumin.
