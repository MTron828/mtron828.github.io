Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 139"

Episode 139: "A Rare Dining Out Experience"

[Temporary Skill – Transcendence]

Effect: All stats, damage, attack speed, and movement speed increase by 44%, and all damage received from enemies is reduced by 44%.

Additionally, there is a 44% decrease in the probability of enemies detecting the player.

The effect lasts for 4 minutes, and if an enemy is defeated, the duration is reset.

It can be deactivated and has a cooldown of 44 minutes.

It is an extraordinary skill that boosts all attributes by 44% and reduces incoming damage by almost half.

"Should I try using it while wearing it?"

On a whim, Ryumin memorized the activation command.

"Transcendence."

At that moment, Ryumin's body became translucent, and a dark aura slowly emanated.

[Transcendence state activated.] [All stats, damage, attack speed, and movement speed increased by 44%.] [All damage received from enemies reduced by 44%.] [Probability of enemies detecting the player decreased by 44%.]

All 44.

Since the number 4 is associated with death in Korea, it seems to have been set to 4.

"Still, the effect is amazing. Additionally, I can hide my face."

To others, Ryumin currently appeared like a dark shadow.

His body was covered in a black energy that floated like smoke, and this effect extended to his equipment as well.

"From head to toe, I must look like a black figure. Even the scythe."

Using the scythe, it can be assumed that it's a black scythe, but the face is not visible.

"I can maintain it for 4 minutes, but if I defeat enemies, the duration resets."

In other words, if something is continuously killed within 4 minutes, it can be maintained indefinitely.

"It's quite useful, especially on the battlefield."

In a battlefield where life and death battles unfold, Transcendence would last until the war ends.

It's a skill perfect for such situations.

"However, the cooldown is longer than expected, so it's not a skill to be overused."

44 minutes, not 4, is a somewhat burdensome cooldown.

Therefore, Ryumin had no intention of using Transcendence unless it was absolutely necessary.

Knock, knock—

"Hey?"

At that moment, Ryumin's door opened, and his younger brother entered.

"You were in your room?"

"Yeah."

Having sensed his brother's presence long before, Ryumin had deactivated Transcendence and was smiling in ordinary attire.

"It was so quiet that I thought you went out again."

"What's going on?"

"It's almost dinner time. I thought it would be nice to go out for a meal with my older brother after a long time..."

"We can't dine out. You know how dangerous the situation outside is these days."

"I know. But it's frustrating to stay home all the time."

It was understandable.

For a whopping 8 months, Ryumin had advised his younger brother to refrain from going out. His brother had obediently followed, ordering delivery food and rarely going out.

"I occasionally went out for a meal, but it didn't happen often."

Calling it dining out would be an exaggeration; it happened only once or twice before the player spread his wings.

"From your perspective, it must be frustrating."

While his brother was confined to the house, Ryumin, the owner, went out here and there for work.

As expected, when he read his brother's thoughts, he realized his younger sibling was quite upset.

"How can you confine me at home, saying it's dangerous outside, while you're out and about everywhere?"

Reading his thoughts further, it seemed that his younger brother was feeling quite resentful.

"Perhaps I was too focused on my own thoughts, restricting your outings because of the memories of being kidnapped."

At this point, he needed to lighten his brother's mood a bit.

It was still risky for him to go out as he pleased, but with the player's influence decreasing lately, it should be fine.

Moreover, wasn't he right there by his side?

"You've been stuck at home for too long, right? I get it. Let's dine out tonight."

"Really? Oh yeah!"

Ryuwon, more pleased about smelling the outdoor air than the thought of eating something delicious, expressed his joy like a child.

"Is it really that exciting?"

Since he enjoyed it so much, maybe dining out once a week would be a good idea.

At that moment, an idea popped into Ryumin's head to lift his brother's spirits.

"If I invite that person, my brother would be happy, right?"

Thinking that calling and suggesting they have a meal together would please his brother, Ryumin made plans with his younger sibling.

Tonight was going to be a rare dining out experience.

Dinner time.
ChatGPT

"The world is in such a state, and yet there are still so many people here?"

"Probably because it's such a famous restaurant."

The brothers, who had secured a spot at the renowned charcoal-grilled ribs restaurant, were grilling meat.

Sizzle—

Even just hearing the sound made the ears happy.

"It feels really good to come out like this with my brother after such a long time."

"I feel the same way."

After hesitating for a moment, Ryuwon gathered the courage.

"To be honest, I felt a bit hurt by you, hyung. You told me to stay at home, but you freely roam outside..."

"I'm a player. You're an ordinary person. And you know how dangerous it is outside, just by watching the news."

"I know. I know, but... It still hurts a bit."

If the patient younger brother was saying this, it must have been quite difficult for him.

Ryumin genuinely felt sorry.

"I'm living like this obsessively for you and my brother. To return to a normal life. But if I neglect the present in pursuit of my goals, that would be as foolish as it gets."

Ryumin promised to pay more attention to his younger brother.

"I'm sorry. Have I neglected you a lot? Just bear with it a little longer. Once this month passes, there won't be many Korean players left, so public safety should be somewhat maintained. The era of criminals running wild, as it is now, will come to an end."

"Oh, really? Does that mean I can go out next month?"

"Yeah. You can trust the words of your prophetic brother."

Ryumin's words were true.

Currently, there were only about 3,000 Korean players remaining.

After completing the 10 rounds, only around 700 of them would survive.

"Since only a quarter will survive the 10 rounds."

How many criminal players could there be among the 700?

Even if there were, they would likely be a small elite who knew how to keep a low profile.

"After all, even if they want to commit crimes, they won't be able to engage in external activities."

Moreover, as the reputation of the Black Scythe rises, mindless looting and roaming like now will no longer happen.

Of course, this is based on the premise that he becomes the captain of the special player unit.

"I've given instructions to Yumti, so when the time comes, he'll give me a call."
ChatGPT

Anyway, a month later, there would be no worries about public safety in South Korea.

"The problem is that the lunatics aren't just in Korea."

Expanding worldwide, there is an excess of trash that needs to be eliminated.

If the trash enters Korea, it becomes a separate issue.

"So, we need to elevate Korea's status and firmly establish the position of the Black Scythe."

Controlling players with the power of national enemies' supply was the best solution to lead humanity away from the path of dystopia.

"Okay, it's done. Eat a lot."

"Yeah, hyung, you should eat a lot too!"

Ryumin and Ryuwon each picked up meat and placed it on the lettuce.

On top of that, they added garlic, ssamjang (dipping sauce), peppers, and green onions, then carefully wrapped the ssam.

And just as they were about to open their mouths wide to eat.

Bang!

A loud noise came from a nearby table.

"Damn it, where's the manager! Manager, come out!"

Because of the loud voice, people around stopped grilling meat and looked over.

Ryumin and Ryuwon also turned their gaze while muttering.

"W-What's going on?"

"Look at this! There's a hair in the meat! They sell this crap for us to eat? Huh?"

Due to the man's yelling, the manager bowed repeatedly with a sullen expression.

There was no other choice.

Just by looking, it was clear the other person was in their twenties.

A player beyond the realm of ordinary people.

"Probably revealing the truth under the influence of alcohol."

While players might not get drunk, they were unpredictable.

"I'm sorry, sir. It seems a staff member's hair accidentally got into the meat. We'll immediately bring out a new serving."

Bowing repeatedly, the manager tried to handle the situation quietly.

Usually, that would have been the case.

Usually.

Crash! Smash!

The table was smashed to pieces, and the dishes on top spilled onto the floor.

The customer, clearly not calming down, shattered the dining table as if to vent his anger.

"You son of a bitch. If you bring out another piece of meat, will that solve the problem? What about the mood I've already ruined? What about the appetite I've lost because of this? You should take responsibility for everything!"

"Uhm, sir, breaking the furniture like this..."
ChatGPT

"This guy dares to talk back? Huh, what kind of restaurant owner talks back to a customer? And on top of that, a lowly ordinary guy!"

As the man raised a fuss, resembling a medieval noble chastising a commoner, he changed his attire.

Tsuuuh—

As a gleaming axe appeared in his hand, the restaurant owner finally realized the seriousness of the situation.

This customer was no ordinary troublemaker.

As if truly becoming an ordinary person, the manager, with both hands pressed together, earnestly spoke.

"I'm sorry, sir. We sincerely apologize for making you feel uncomfortable."

"If sorry was enough? There should be compensation, shouldn't there? Compensation!"

"Uh, what kind of compensation would be suitable..."

The man immediately formed a round shape with his thumb and forefinger.

"Give me money. Everything you've got."

"H-How much specifically..."

Crash!

The table on the floor shattered into pieces with a single kick.

"I told you, didn't I? Bring out everything you've got."

"Oh, okay."

While the owner went to fetch the cash, the man raised the axe, glaring at the people around.

"What are you looking at, you sons of bitches! Never seen this before?"

After yelling, people who were initially watching discreetly averted their eyes.

Most of the people inside the store were ordinary individuals aged 30 and above.

There was no way they could confront players with bravado or strength.

Crazy, what's wrong with that guy? Is he a player?

They said all players were potential criminals, and it turns out to be true.

Geez, I should eat quickly and get out before sparks start flying.

While Ryumin read the thoughts of the customers, his younger brother voiced his concerned thoughts.

"Hyung, why is that person like that?"

"Why is he like that? He's deliberately making a scene to legally extort some money."

"No, why do players act like that? Can't they earn money by working?"

"Because there's no time for that. They act like that because there's no time for that. This could be their last month alive; who would want to work a part-time job to earn money? It's better to plunder."

That's why players raided street vendors.

Because they were at a dead end.

Because it was easy money.

"But even after the Large Player Bill, I thought it would decrease, but it seems not. Just look at how shamelessly they engage in illegal activities. We really need the activation of the Large Player Unit soon..."
ChatGPT

Ryumin's right hand, as he was saying this, was quite busy.

"Hyung, what are you doing?"

"I'm tinkering with the system."

Touching his fingers in the air, Ryumin configured the equipment window to a two steps lower Regular grade and recited the activation code for wearing it.

Tsuuuh—

"Why suddenly wear equipment?"

"Among the customers, it seems I'm the only player here. Can't just leave it like this, can we?"

As Ryumin stood up, his brother, surprised, tried to stop him.

"H-Hyung! It's dangerous, so just stay still."

"Leaving a guy like that alone is even more dangerous."

Adding, "I'll be back soon," Ryumin walked towards the man.

Since even the equipment had been changed to regular grade, there was no reason for suspicion.

In the meantime, the owner returned with a wad of cash.

"Boss. Why did it take so long to bring that small amount of money? You didn't report it to the police, did you?"

"W-Well, no. Why would I do that? Anyway, here..."

"What's this?"

The man who received the cash raised an eyebrow.

"Is this everything you have?"

The cash the owner brought was barely 200,000 won.

It wasn't the expected money from a popular restaurant that should have at least a daily sales of a million won.

"Are you kidding me? Stick 200,000 won to your nose!"

"W-Well, recently we mainly use card payments, so we don't have much cash. It's true!"

"Then I'll call my account, you put 10 million won in there."

"What? T-Ten million won?"

"Why are you surprised? It's a cheap price for my mental compensation. What? Too little? Should I raise it?"

"No, no."

"Then do as I say when I ask nicely. You have a phone, right? Transfer the money right here in front of me."

"W-Well, I don't have that much money in my account, so that's difficult..."

"This guy is lying even when I tell him to show it! Do I look easy? Are you joking? Huh?"

When he menacingly brandished the axe, Ryumin walked toward the man.

As the man who received the money raised his eyebrows.

"What is this guy doing? What now?"

Ryumin grabbed the man's wrist.

"Enough of this now."

"This X-only guy... Who are you again?"

Ryumin tightened his grip on the man's hand.

"Now, let's stop this."

"This X-only guy... Who are you again?"

Ryumin tightened his grip on the man's hand.

"Now, let's stop this."
ChatGPT

Did he feel immense strength from the caught wrist?

The man's expression instantly tensed, even though Ryumin had adjusted it not to break.

"You shouldn't cause a disturbance in a crowded place. It might ruin the meal with all the noise."

"Are you going to let go of my hand?"

"If I let go, won't you cause trouble?"

"Okay, okay. I got it. So let go quickly!"

As the grip, which seemed like it might break or might not, intensified, the man's expression became desperate.

Of course, Ryumin had no intention of breaking the man's wrist.

He just wanted to threaten him enough to chase him away.

But it was just Ryumin's wish.

Reading his thoughts, it seemed the man had no intention of leaving.

"Let go, you X-only bastard!"

"Do you have no intention of stepping back even if I let go?"

"No! What are you going to do?"

"We have to wait like this until the police arrive."

"What? Police? Is this bastard trying to kill me?"

Was he trying to escape before the police arrived?

At that moment, another axe was held from the man's opposite hand.

It turned out to be a gladiator who handled dual axes.

"Just die, you X-arm!"

As if he was about to chop off his head, he swung the axe.

'Huh? A shield?'

Ryumin looked at the shield unfolding before his eyes.

Kaang!

The axe bounced off the shield.

Ryumin released the man's wrist and turned his head.

A familiar woman appeared leading a fairy.

It was none other than Seo Arin.
