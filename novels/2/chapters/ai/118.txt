Title: Episode 118 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Top of the Human Realm

When Ryu Min arrived at the waiting area alone, the angel Ariel was taken aback.

[Are you the only one who survived?]

"Yes."

They didn't know the betrayer group had already perished.

[Dying without even being able to go to the top of the human realm. Truly useless beings.]

'I thought I could survive a bit longer to show the upper ones an interesting scene.'

Ariel, hiding her true feelings, shook her head hesitantly.

[Well, what can you do? You have to carry out the mission even if you're alone. The Black Scythe. You do know this is your last chance, right?]

"I'm aware."

[If you fail the betrayer quest in the human realm, there's no mercy. We don't show mercy, claiming the top spot in the rankings.]

'I know. We're strictly governed by the system.'

[By the way, there are 1,201 people in the human realm. In other words, it's a fight between whether you survive or the 1,201 survive.]

That's also understood without saying.

Since the quest is at a crossroads, one of the groups must perish.

[If you win, 1,201 will perish, but well, what can you do? You have to survive even if you have to abandon the majority, right?]

"...."

[It would be amusing to see the top-ranked player perish, but I hope you survive if possible. It seems more fun to abandon the majority, hehe.]

With those words from the angel, Ryu Min's background changed.

In the distance, a mountain is visible.

Green trees can also be seen.

A neatly arranged road is visible, suitable for carriages to pass through.

But what caught Ryu Min's attention more than those things was the players.

A large number of players, numbering in the thousands, were bustling.

'As expected, the human realm is the most popular.'

There is no other reason for the crowd.

It's simply easier to deal with fellow humans than with the species of other realms.

Familiarity seems more comfortable and easier than novelty.

'But the most challenging is the top of the human realm.'
ChatGPT

The top of the human realm features strong monsters such as trolls, ghouls, skeletons, minotaurs, and more.

'Even if they appear at a rate of one per person, it won't be easy. It's not something players in their early thirties can handle, especially if they haven't surpassed level 50.'

Although it might be manageable for those above level 50, for players in their early thirties like Ryu Min, it's a level of monsters that is difficult to handle.

'Still, with a large number, I should be able to somehow deal with them. Moreover, there's also the Archbishop.'

If the Elf realm had a princess, the human realm has an Archbishop.

'Even though he lacks combat abilities, the Archbishop will protect the top and the players.'

The wide-ranging buffs from the Archbishop will enhance the players' combat power and survivability.

Unlike other realms, they can progress with the help of beings from another realm.

'That indicates the difficulty level, but just receiving assistance is reassuring enough.'

Of course, Ryu Min wasn't bothered by such trivial matters.

Even with his stats reduced by 20% twice, he could still exert 64% of his original strength. He was confident.

'Even if my strength has diminished, the monsters coming out of here are all my prey.'

If he couldn't even break a sweat from exercising after a meal until now, would the ones coming out of here make him break a sweat or not?

And that's with his strength reduced to 64% as the benchmark.

'It would have been easier without the stat debuffs.'

While thinking about such things, Ryu Min turned his head.

There was an approaching popularity.

"Excuse me, are you by any chance the Black Scythe?"

When Ryu Min looked, the person was startled and covered their mouth with their hand.

"Oh, it's really you! The Black Scythe!"

"The Black Scythe?"

"The Black Scythe came to the top of the human realm?"

The excitement grew, and people began to gather.

It felt like watching animals at a zoo.

Ryu Min openly displayed an uncomfortable expression.

"Mr. Black Scythe! Can I get an autograph?"

"Please do it for me too! Mr. Black Scythe, I'm your true fan!"

"Can we shake hands just once?"

But there's always someone who doesn't read the atmosphere.

Ryu Min, as if saying he had no choice, pulled out his scythe.

"Don't come any closer. You'll die."

When he glared at them with a deadly gaze, the approaching players flinched.

"Go away."

With those words, the players turned their gazes away and dispersed.
ChatGPT

Knowing there's nothing good about probing the feelings of the Black Scythe, Ryu Min turned his annoyed gaze when he heard a voice despite telling them to go away.

But there was a familiar face there.

"An Sang Cheol?"

"Oh, so you are the Black Scythe. I never thought you'd choose the same top. Nice to meet you."

"Yeah."

An Sang Cheol spoke with a smile, but Ryu Min couldn't treat him warmly. The memory of him betraying Ryu Min during the 7th round was still vivid, even if it was an illusion.

Ryu Min asked, already knowing the answer, "Why are you alone?"

"Seo Arin went to the Dwarf realm. He thought it seemed easier there..."

Even though Ryu Min knew it wasn't easier but rather knew it was easy, An Sang Cheol was evasive. He still believed he couldn't reveal anything about the prophecy.

'He didn't hesitate to talk about it in the illusion. Was the illusion just an illusion then?'

Ryu Min was a bit less worried. As long as An Sang Cheol wasn't insane, he wouldn't betray. Ryu Min's prophecy would be needed until the last round.

'If he betrays, it would probably be Ma Kyung Rok's doing. He's not the type to act on his own.'

But it was strange that, for some reason, he chose the human realm after separating from Seo Arin. Even though he knew it was the most difficult.

To find out the reason, Ryu Min delved into An Sang Cheol's inner thoughts.

'Ha. Was that the reason?'

The reason was to become stronger.

However, the purpose of becoming stronger was not for his own sake.

'It was to become stronger with the thought of possibly becoming an enemy of Ma Kyung Rok.'

There cannot be two kings under the same sky. An Sang Cheol, wanting to establish Ma Kyung Rok as king, was considering the possibility that the Black Scythe might become an obstacle.

In preparation for that time, he wanted to become strong, even if it was just to stay by his lord's side.

'Didn't know he was trying to restrain me?'

The thought of trying to catch up to him seemed pitiful, but Ryu Min decided to watch. To see how much he would grow.

At that moment, another person, who had a friendship with Ryu Min, approached.

"Oh? Black Scythe?"

It was the Mercenary King Jo Yong Ho.

"You were in the human realm too?"
ChatGPT

"Yes. It seems there are more people gathered around here than last time."

There were roughly twenty people around Jo Yong Ho this time.

"Last time there were only five, but now it seems he's recruited more mercenaries."

Mercenaries receive bonus stats when they sign a contract with the Mercenary King. There is no reason for them not to follow Jo Yong Ho.

"Do you remember what I said before? If you need help, I'll lend a hand."

"I remember."

"Is there anything you need right now?"

"Not at the moment. Let's postpone it for next time."

"Haha, understood."

There was no trace of suspicion in Jo Yong Ho's laughter.

'The personalities of An Sang Cheol and Jo Yong Ho seem to differ here.'

One sees the Black Scythe as a potential threat, while the other perceives him as a perfect ally.

Even though both received his assistance, their perspectives are remarkably different.

"Then I'll be on my way since I have things to do. Nice meeting you."

"Sure."

Jo Yong Ho, along with his group, entered the crowd of people.

Observing him talking to various individuals, it seemed like he was looking for players with the Mercenary profession.

'With the large number of players in the human realm, he can quickly build up his influence.'

At that moment, a message appeared in front of everyone.

[Escort the Human Realm]

└ Safely escort the Human Realm to its destination.

└ If successful, everyone will receive experience points as a reward.

└ The individual who contributes significantly to eliminating betrayers will receive a sub-quest reward.

└ If all betrayers are eliminated without exception, additional rewards will be given to everyone.

[Current Participant Status]

└ Participants: 1,202

└ Betrayers: 1

Players looking at the participant status expressed complaints.

"Only one betrayer?"

"I thought there were a few more."

"How are we supposed to find one among 1,202?"

Players lost their enthusiasm for a mission that was like finding a needle in a haystack.

"Still, it's better to search. Shall we attack each other?"

"Let's do it!"

As before, players tried to identify the betrayer by attacking each other.

But among them, no player dared to provoke the Black Scythe.

Except for An Sang Cheol, who had some connection.
ChatGPT

"Black Scythe, I apologize."

"You're not trying to stab me, are you?"

"If you're not a betrayer, you won't get hurt, right? Or maybe?"

An Sang Cheol was quick to catch on, even though Ryu Min deliberately hinted at it.

"Hmm, let's consider there's no sub-quest. It seems to be beyond the difficulty level of this world."

"That would be more comfortable."

An Sang Cheol, realizing that the opponent was the Black Scythe, gave up early.

'He's not betraying like in the illusion.'

Unless An Sang Cheol is a fool, he won't shout that the Black Scythe is a betrayer. Considering the debts he owes and turning the Rank 1 player into an enemy, it wouldn't end well for him.

"I will keep the secret. Rest assured."

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

Although Ryu Min shrugged, An Sang Cheol just smiled and didn't say anything else.

As if he knew everything.

At that moment, the Archbishop's escorted group started approaching.

"Is that the carriage we need to escort?"

"Whoa, look at that carriage. Did someone important ride it?"

It was too luxurious to be an ordinary top.

There were at least 50 carriages, and the one that seemed to carry the Archbishop was larger, more luxurious, and ran on a different track from the others.

'Does the Archbishop's carriage have to stand out like this?'

Monsters may not choose carriage designs, but making such an impression can easily become a target for humans.

'Good for me, being part of the betrayer group.'

As the carriages stopped, a man who seemed to be in charge of the Human Realm approached, clearing his throat.

"Uh, greetings. Hello, warriors from another realm. I am Kalos, the commander of the escort for the Hormos Merchant Union."

His polite greeting made him seem like a formidable figure, fitting the introduction of an escort commander.

"We are transporting goods at the request of the Holy Empire and, at the same time, are entrusted with the protection of Archbishop Laverre. However, the journey through the Labrattan Mountains to the Kingdom of Brahm is treacherous, so we had no choice but to seek help from the temple."

Although the escort commander explained extensively, it fell on deaf ears for the players.

"The Archbishop?"

"Indeed, someone high-ranking was riding it, huh?"
ChatGPT

"Is that the carriage?"

It's enough to know who needs to be escorted and protected.

"Well then, before we depart, let's hear from Archbishop-nim."

Soon, the door of the most splendid and luxurious carriage opened.

An old man with white hair spoke with a dignified expression.

"Warriors from another realm. I am grateful that you are participating in this escort. The journey to the destination may be treacherous, but do not worry. I hope there is light on your path and I will bless you."

No player asked what the blessing was, as a message appeared shortly after.

[Archbishop Laverre casts the blessing 'Holy Shield.'][A shield is created that blocks the enemy's basic attack 1 time.][Archbishop Laverre casts the blessing 'Sacred Touch.'][All stats increase by 5.]

As the buff was applied, the players' faces turned pale.

"Oh, the NPC is giving buffs?"

"Did you get buffed too? So did I."

"Me too!"

"Is it applied to everyone here?"

"That Archbishop guy is quite useful, isn't he?"

Players who received buffs for the first time were amused, but it wasn't something to be happy about.

The Archbishop was going to face monsters with a difficulty level high enough to warrant applying buffs.

'Trolls, goblins, these are not dangerous. The real danger is boss-level monsters.'

Exactly at the 25th wave, a boss monster would appear.

At that time, players would likely be exhausted, making it challenging to defeat the boss.

'What if I step forward and demonstrate overwhelming skills?'

It would catch the Archbishop's attention, and he valued skill, allowing me to gain his favor.

'And favor leads to items.'

It was an opportunity to obtain the Rune of the Future.

'After obtaining that, I have to kill the Archbishop and the other merchants.'

Defeating the inhabitants of the Otherworld to prevent the Human Realm from reaching its destination.

That way, Ryu Min, the betrayer, could survive.

On the contrary, the regular group of 1,201 players would likely fail the quest.

'But that doesn't mean they'll be annihilated.'

There was a way.

A way for the 1,201 players and Ryu Min not to face annihilation.
