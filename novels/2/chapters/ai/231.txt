Title: The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player - Episode 231

A Country Dominated by Authority

Right before his avatar took a fatal shot and died,

Ryumin used his tracking skill to search for Dark Soul.

It wasn't because there was no one else at the promised meeting place but him.

"As expected, there was a trap."

Dark Soul was preparing for a sniper shot 1 km away.

"To think he believes he can kill me with a sniper. He still hasn't come to his senses."

Despite narrowing the gap from 12 disciples to 4, Ryumin thought it made them realize the difference in power. It was a misconception.

"They won't be the ones to listen until they're on the brink of death."

If strength doesn't work, there are other ways.

Using Yangti to turn them into slaves.

"I'd like to challenge them to a duel, but proud individuals like them won't accept. It's also troublesome."

Just making eye contact can control people. How convenient is that?

The reason for bringing Yangti was here.

"Yangti, go and dominate them."

"Um, Lord of the Black Scythe?"

Looking at Yangti, Yangchowen, Jangsuwi, and Spainard, Yangti spoke.

"There's not enough space to dominate them all."

"Who are you currently dominating?"

"Commissioner of Police, Chairman of Plesiba, Jeffrey. That's three."

Yangti can control a total of five people.

There are only two spots left.

"Release the Commissioner of Police. He's useless now since the President is favorable towards us. The same goes for the Plesiba Chairman. There's no need for him when he has absorbed the Plesiba members into the Sacred Cult."

Even if it costs money to rent a private jet, it doesn't matter.

You can demand it from the President, or Ryu Min, who has a trillion won, can easily get it.

"Understood. Then what about Jeffrey?"

"Just leave him, just in case. Releasing his control shouldn't cause any issues."

By releasing the temptation, four spots became available.

Even considering the fact that once tempted, the same target cannot be tempted again, it was still a problem-free decision.

"Greetings, Master."

"Greetings to the new Master."

After dominating even the last brought Dark Soul, all four disciples kneel and greet.

"Get up. What's the point if someone sees us like this."

Although they are under Yangti, they followed my orders like slaves because I delegated authority to him.

"But, Master, what do you plan to do by dominating these guys? Instead of just killing them..."

Was it because the competition increased that made him uncomfortable?

Looking at Yangti with an uneasy expression, Ryumin replied.

"It's meaningless to kill them. I gain nothing from it. I'll use them as much as I need and then kill them."

Killing them now would only reduce the number of survivors TO.

Since I intended to save as many people as possible in Round 15, it would be troublesome if the number of players decreased further.

Of course, if killing them brings benefits, the story might change.

"Now that the goal is achieved, let's go back. Disband yourselves. I don't have any tasks for you yet."

"Yes, Master."

"Don't say the word 'Master' in front of others."

"Oh, understood. Then..."

After bowing, the four disciples stepped back.

"Yangti, let's go as well."

"Yes."

Just as Ryumin took a step, his phone vibrated.

It seemed like he received an email.

"Is the investigation complete?"

The contents of the email were surprisingly simple.

[Sender: National Intelligence Agency Director Kwak Min-seok]

└Content: If you enter the secret code I informed you of the day before yesterday, you can access the security document. I wish you all the best.

When I went to the Blue House the other day, I received a 12-digit number for file inspection.

I remember the secretary was surprised that I didn't write it down on a note.

'291294719481.'

Entering all 12 digits, the security page opens.

└Rebel leader's nickname: Doonggadoonga

└First report: January 5, 2023, 22:12, called the Korean Embassy (☎Listen to the conversation).

└Evidence: All trade transactions have been blocked since last month, and routes and ports are blocked. No articles have been published.

Ryumin, who quickly confirmed the information, raised his head.

The destination was decided.

"Did we receive a tip?"

"Yes."

"Where are you going?"

"For now, we're heading to nearby Mexico."

"Then can I..."

"No."

Flutter-

Wings spread behind Ryumin.

"I'm going alone. Yangti, join your colleagues and continue promoting the Sacred Cult. Let them know about my situation if I can't join."

"Yes, Master. Please take care."

"What is there to be careful about."

Ryumin, who let out a dry laugh, soared into the sky.

Yangti, who had been gazing up at the sky until he became a black dot and disappeared, moved his feet belatedly.

Cartel member Gustavo always thought.

"Someday, I'll kill all the members here and take over the organization."

Despite being beaten by senior members every day under the pretext of military training, he endured the life in the organization because of his ambition to rise higher.

He dreamed of reaching the top of the organization someday, enjoying a luxurious life with women like the high-ranking officials.

With such grand dreams, he joined the organization and committed various crimes, including robbery, arson, murder, rape, human trafficking, and drug smuggling.

'Damn it. How long do I have to stay at the bottom?'

For him, young and powerless, promotion was nothing more than a distant dream.

That was until the major upheaval a year ago.

"P-please spare me. Spare me... aargh!"

Gustavo, who plunged a knife into the heart, smiled wickedly.

The reason the man in front of him was dying was simple.

'How dare he look straight into the eyes of Mexico's top-ranking eyes with such insolent eyes?'

Just because his gaze was insolent.

That was the only reason.

That alone was enough for the man to die.

He was just an inferior commoner who could be killed without any consequences.

"Hey, you, your clothes are stained with blood. Filthy. Hey, slave. Come here and clean up the corpse."

"Yes, yes!"

After the major upheaval in 2022.

Gustavo, hiding his claws, survived cunningly.

As a result, he rose to become the top-ranked player in Mexico, allowing him to fulfill a long-standing promise.

He killed all the senior members and old bosses who had tormented him, creating a new cartel unit.

A cartel organization composed solely of players.

But it didn't end there.

After reorganizing the organization, the first thing he did was seize control of the government.

There were frictions with rebels during the process, but the outcome was as clear as day.

An army of players that couldn't be subdued even with guns was beyond the capabilities of ordinary soldiers to stop.

"We have taken control of the Mexican government. I personally severed the president's neck, and I burned his wife and children alive. We also crushed all government officials. Mexico is now ruled by our organization. There is no hope for you inferior civilians."

This happened just one month ago.

It was Gustavo's actions after reaching level 60.

For the Mexican citizens, it was nothing short of shocking.

"From now on, we control all media. We will seize citizens' phones, block the internet, and cut off all communication networks. Broadcasting will also be halted."

The reason Gustavo gave such orders to his subordinates was clear.

To turn the country into a land ruled solely by force, a lawless land.

Gustavo's reign of terror didn't stop there.

"From now on, civilians are declared slaves of the players. The position of inferior civilians is to crawl like dogs. The words of players are the law, and any civilian who opposes players will be executed on the spot."

In a world of survival of the fittest, it was the natural order for the strong to survive.

To create his kingdom ruled solely by strength, it was necessary to enslave civilians from the beginning.

"But what's that noise...?"

Where Gustavo was looking, there was a TV.
ChatGPT

"[...If there is a player who, intoxicated by power, seizes control and oppresses civilians, please stop immediately... If the misconduct does not cease... I will personally come to pass judgment.]"

"Judgment? Judgment, you say?"

Mockery spilled out of Gustavo's mouth as he watched the translated subtitles.

Wasn't it a declaration of war, not just breaking down his kingdom?

"F*cking Yellow Monkey. Such arrogance pierces the sky."

He couldn't understand why he would do that, but all he could do was laugh.

It seemed impossible.

Entering Mexico was impossible in the first place.

"Come on, come and try. If you see any suspicious aircraft or ships, just shoot missiles to intercept them."

Taking control of the government also meant swallowing the military.

Monitoring maritime and airspace, they had instructed to shoot down any incoming object without prior contact.

'We have no intention of interacting with other countries. There are no flights or ships either.'

To become a lawless land, Mexico completely cut off external communication and became a thoroughly isolated country.

It was essentially holding millions of citizens hostage.

In such a situation, the Black Scythe couldn't possibly enter Mexico.

Even if he were to learn about the current situation here.

"The audacious Black Scythe. Daring to pass judgment or whatever? This won't work. Soon, we should mobilize the military and retaliate against Korea. We'll show them exactly what happens if they mess with me."

Currently, there was no one in Mexico who could touch him.

Both the cartel and the military were under his command.

'I am the king, and this is my country.'

Even the Black Scythe wouldn't dare to invade his kingdom.

Knock-

With a knock, someone entered the room.

"Gustavo, Doonggadoonga has arrived."

"Oh, has it gotten this late already?"

Gustavo stood up and nodded at his secretary.

"Prepare a welcoming ceremony since our guest has arrived. Twenty beautiful and well-shaped slaves."

"Understood."

As the secretary silently cursed Gustavo as a pervert and stepped aside, Doonggadoonga entered the room.

"Welcome, Gustavo."

"Please come in, Doonggadoonga. You've traveled a long way."

"A long way, you say. What nonsense. It's quick with a private jet, you know."

"Please have a seat here."

As Doonggadoonga laughed lightly and sat on the sofa, he naturally glanced at the TV.
ChatGPT

"It seems the Black Scythe gave a speech. I happened to visit regarding that issue..."

Doonggadoonga's expression became serious.

"What do you think? About that speech."

"Nonsense, well, it's not worth thinking deeply about."

"He targeted us, didn't he?"

"Well, he did, but he didn't say it knowing. Even if he knows that we control the government, it won't change anything."

"Do you have any countermeasures?"

"What kind of countermeasure can there be? Besides, he'll be dead before he even enters the country."

"Since you're intercepting any unauthorized aircraft or ships, there's nothing to worry about, right?"

"That's right. We can comfortably handle our affairs here with the slaves."
