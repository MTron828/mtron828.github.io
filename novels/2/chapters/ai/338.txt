Title: Episode 338 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player

Round 101 (Part 2)

Did Ryu Min-Ju reveal her true identity early on?

Reading her inner thoughts through the rune, her self-confidence has increased.

"It should be fine since there's no one to expose me."

Nevertheless, she warned not to tell anyone else.

"After saying it, does it feel refreshing inside?"

No longer needing to hide in the other realm or use a fake nickname, she felt mentally at ease.

Building trust with people was just a bonus.

Later, she changed her business and company name with Ma Kyung-Rok at the Plop Market.

She started her business earlier than the previous round.

There were no issues, though.

In Round 5, she and Min-Ju defeated the orcs together, and she even competed for the record in time attack against a high orc.

As a reward, she obtained the Assassin's Mask and got listed in the Akashic Records.

Everything went as planned.

"Now, I should slowly kill Hwang Yong-Min."

She killed the unnecessary Hwang Yong-Min and built a friendship with Russell.

She warned Kristin about being cautious in Round 11, taught Joo Sung-Tak true education, saved National Assembly member Lee Sung-Hyun, made Yum-Ti a slave, and warned Seo Ah-Rin that actors might betray her.

By dominating the Chief of Police, she was appointed as the deputy commander of CPF, conquered the Trial Tower up to the 99th floor, and once again recorded her achievements in the Akashic Records.

"Now, Remiel, the 7th-ranked Archangel, will surely become interested in my records. Even if not, Luvahai will likely send someone subtly."

After exterminating IS in Nigeria and saving Victor, she recruited a Battle Angel when Round 10 began.

She became the first to kill a Battle Angel, gaining a deceptive buff called the Devil's Blessing.

She also killed the Remiel sent by Luvahai.

"Now, this is the real beginning."

Initiating her growth, Ryu Min controlled Jeffrey, Joo Sung-Tak, and Ma Kyung-Rok using Yum-Ti.

Dominating these three people, not without some hostility, dispelled her anxiety.

"With this, there shouldn't be any dangerous situations."

After that, in Round 11, she saved Kristin and entered the Labyrinth Forest to obtain the Ring of the Doppelganger.

She didn't forget to earn 20 million points at the gambling den.

"I could become max level if I use the points. However, it's a waste to use the invincibility effect now."

She had already reached the max level and had no intention of wasting the invincibility effect.

It's always good to save whenever possible, whether in the previous round or now.

"Now, should I try killing the 12 Apostles?"

Having already experienced 100 rounds, she knew exactly who was targeting her.

Without waiting, Ryu Min eliminated those who posed a threat to dispel any anxiety.

Of course, she spared John Delga.

Considering the benefits he had provided earlier, his value as a slave was sufficient.

In Round 12, she killed Sariel, the 6th-ranked Archangel.

Ma Kyung-Rok's company was listed on the KOSPI, achieving great success.

Seeing Ma Kyung-Rok recognized by her father, Ryu Min felt a sense of pride deep inside.

"Is it because of the thought of being a slave? Everything seems to make me proud."

Before, Ma Kyung-Rok was unpredictable, but not anymore.

By making him a slave, she completely had him on a leash.

Perhaps because of this, Ryu Min was extremely pleased with the company's growth.

"The problem is that the Ma Kyung-Sang brothers won't stay quiet."

Jealous of the successor Ma Kyung-Rok, the other two brothers planned a crime, but it was all within Ryu Min's grasp.

By receiving a promise from Ma Kyung-Rok, who had subdued his brothers through a duel, to withdraw from the succession fight, the incident was temporarily resolved.

"Now, there shouldn't be any contempt towards Kristin and Seo Ah-Rin from Ma Kyung-Rok."

Although Ma Kyung-Rok's survival was different from before, it was unavoidable to utilize his max-level skills.

An Sang-Cheol was no different.

"Now that the number of players has decreased, should I sell some stocks?"

Ryu Min sold her entire 31% stake in the company.

Since it was a timing for the stock price to hit a downturn, she had no regrets.

"Ma Kyung-Rok's company might waver because of me, but well, it doesn't matter."

She might receive criticism from the chairman, but Ma Kyung-Rok was her slave.

Whether the company fails or not, there won't be any anger or unexpected actions.

Regardless of what happens to the slave, she earned 1 trillion, and that's all that mattered.

Afterwards, in Round 13, she openly took down the players who were ruling the country by killing Raguel and Uriel.

As a result, as planned, the public opinion of the Black Scythe improved, its reputation soared, and it became a figure that players feared.

"The security is perfect, and there are no dangerous elements. I've achieved the goal of controlling the surrounding situation to some extent."

Now, the real challenge begins.

"Gabriel will try to kill me using the Devil's Resurrection Book in Round 14."

The Devil's Resurrection Book was an item intentionally dropped by Phlunictus in the previous Demon and Angel War.

According to the rules that they shouldn't interfere with each other before the Demon and Angel War, using that item was not allowed.

However, Gabriel initiates the plan, thinking that if he offers the soul of the Black Scythe as a sacrifice, Phlunictus won't object.

With the help of the revenge goddess Nemesis.

"Nemesis will recommend someone to handle the job for her [Soso Mokbang]. Gabriel will directly hand over the Devil's Resurrection Book to him."

However, the plan ultimately fails, leading to Phlunictus and Arthas targeting her.

"And even Chaos."

If she can manage to conclude this situation well, she might be able to avoid the gaze of Chaos.

"Chaos must not know about my existence. Chaos is an unbeatable being no matter how much I grow."

So, she has one plan in mind.

To prevent the use of the Devil's Resurrection Book.

If she can block the use of the Devil's Resurrection Book, Phlunictus won't detect its usage, and she can buy some time.

But how does she stop it?

"There's a very simple way."

Smirking, Ryu Min sought out Min-Joo as soon as Round 14 began.

"Please give me a buff."

"Sure, I got it."

After receiving a set of three buffs, she went to Yum-Ti.

"Do you have 100 Mill Worms? Bring them out."

"Yes, Mistress."

She killed the Mill Worms, stacking the Rune of Slaughter up to 100.

With all preparations complete, she went to find a small mukbang (eating show).

"Hey."

"Who...? Oh!"

The small mukbang was startled.

It seems that they didn't expect the arrival of the Black Scythe they resented.

"Follow me when I ask nicely."

"W-Why me!"

Instead of answering, Ryu Min summoned her scythe.

Swish!

[Thud!]

After taking a surprise hit to his health, she used the Divine Transformation and Devil's Blessing.

"You... You are...!"

"It's me. The Black Scythe you've been looking for."

Smirking, Ryu Min, now in her true form, killed Gabriel.

"Operation successful."

Ryu Min's plan was nothing more than disguising herself as a small mukbang to ascend to heaven.

Thus, the key to the plan was killing Gabriel before he could use the Devil's Resurrection Book.

"This way, there should be no room for Phlunictus to intervene."

But since she was already there, it would be best to deal with everyone.

Using her tracking skill, Ryu Min found the remaining targets.

[Target 'Raphael's location has been identified.] [Currently 631m away.] [Target 'Michael's location has been identified.] [Currently 632m away.]

"The distance is similar; they must be together."

Seeing that they were not too far away, it seemed that she wouldn't be too late to deal with them.

Having made her decision, Ryu Min allocated her stats and moved.

Despite it being a 2v1, she didn't think it would be easy.

"I took advantage of the element of surprise to easily kill Gabriel. With Raphael and Michael, I have to face them head-on."

So, she didn't assume an easy victory but also didn't consider defeat.

She had a trump card up her sleeve.

After a while, Ryu Min encountered Raphael and Michael.

"You, you are the Black Scythe?" [How is a human here?]

Although the two were surprised, Ryu Min, in her assassin manner, swung her scythe without answering.

The peaceful hall of heaven turned into a fierce battlefield in an instant, but only Ryu Min was fervently engaged.

"These guys are stronger than I thought."

Did she attack too early?

Surprisingly, the two angels resisted well.

"Raphael and Michael are more challenging than Gabriel."

Of course, that was to be expected.

Michael, known as the god of combat, was the dealer.

Raphael, known as the angel of healing, was the supporter.

"The offensive may be strong, but I still have the advantage. I can see Michael getting flustered."
ChatGPT

Due to the sudden attack, Michael found himself fighting Ryu Min, but in reality, he probably didn't want to kill the Black Scythe.

He likely intended to keep Ryu Min alive until the final round, intercept the wish stone, and fulfill his wish of becoming a god.

"But it seems he just gave up on that wish."

Michael's offensive became more aggressive, probably because he judged that keeping the Black Scythe alive was risky.

It was a moment when the tense tug-of-war suddenly shifted.

"Is this how it turns out?"

It would be unfavorable to delay any longer, as someone else might appear.

Ryu Min pushed the two angels away with her scythe and increased the distance.

Then, she pulled the scythe back and assumed the Crescent Moon Stance.

Seizing the opportunity, Michael rushed forward.

"You fool! Showing a gap in front of me!"

The movement of pulling the scythe back seemed like a vulnerability in his eyes.

However, what appeared as a vulnerability was purely a decoy.

As long as she had invincibility, the probability of losing to them was originally nonexistent.

"Purchased an experience pack using 5,000,000 points."

In an instant, she reached level 99, and a brilliant light enveloped her body.

"To celebrate reaching the max level, all health is restored, and I enter a 1-minute invincible state."

Boom!

As invincibility activated, Michael's sword struck Ryu Min's skin but couldn't penetrate it.

The well-timed burst of bright light only severed the bodies of Michael and Raphael.

Rustle!

Raphael died, and Michael, twisting his body, barely managed to survive.

However.

"Death sentence."

When she activated the max-level skill, the nearly depleted health of Michael exploded like a bomb.

Boom!

└Defeat 7 Archangels

└Current number of defeated Archangels (7/7)

└If successful ▶ Progress to Divine Transformation

[You have completed the Soul Bond quest.] [As a reward for completing the Soul Bond quest, 'Divine Transformation' will now proceed.]

It was quite an early timing for Divine Transformation.
