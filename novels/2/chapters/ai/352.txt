Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 352"

Transcendent Being

Becoming a transcendent being was simpler than expected.

All one had to do was lie on the ritual altar and absorb the energy of the god of massacre.

[Transforming absorbed energy into unique components and overlaying them.] [Progress 1%…….] [Progress 2%…….] [Time remaining until complete fusion with the soul: 97 minutes and 31 seconds]

Ryumin, after reading the message, asked Mindojun, "What does the message say?"

"It's the process of becoming a transcendent being. It takes about 100 minutes."

"What exactly is a transcendent being?"

"In your dimension, there are gods, right? In our dimension, we have transcendent beings. Strictly speaking, it refers to entities that can use the functions of Elsis."

"Elsis?"

"It's a system created by the primordial god 'El.' It can perform various functions but requires the energy called Divine Force. In your terms, does 'Terra' fit into this category?"

Elsis, Divine Force—Ryumin didn't fully comprehend what they were talking about. She only vaguely understood the concepts.

In reality, Ryumin's interest lay elsewhere. "Anyway, if one becomes a transcendent being, they can restore the deleted rune system, right?"

"That's right. Not only runes but also levels, skills, items, and stats can all be summoned. If you become a transcendent being and use Elsis's functions."

In other words, Ryumin was becoming a transcendent being and being reborn as a new race.

"Take it easy for the next 100 minutes. During that time, I'll fix the boiling energy next to you."

"…."

How could one rest comfortably when a mysterious being was taking care of them with intense eyes?

"Um, Mindojun, I have a question."

"You're curious why I'm helping, right?"

As if reading her thoughts, Mindojun immediately answered.

"It's nothing special. We're both humans. It feels like looking at my past."

Ryumin felt puzzled as she looked at Mindojun, who smiled so kindly.

It was unimaginable that such a friendly being carried the terrifying title of the god of massacre. "Rest well. I'm fine, so don't worry."

"Thank you."

Ryumin sighed with relief and closed her eyes for the first time in a while.

How much time had passed?

What woke her from her slumber was none other than the voice of the system.

[Progress 98%…….] [Progress 99%…….] [Time remaining until complete fusion with the soul: 10 seconds] [Progress 100%] [The changed components elevate the soul's power.] [Entered the realm of the transcendent being.] [Access permission granted for Elsis.] [50.1% of the soul is filled with Divine Force.] [Dear new user, welcome to Elsis.] [From now on, you can enjoy all the benefits of Elsis by consuming Divine Force.] [May the divine blessing of El shine brighter than heavenly light by your side.]

[Black Scythe? Black Scythe.] [Yes?] [Why are you so absent-minded?] [Oh, sorry. I was checking the system.] [The system of Elsis? Or…] [The original system.]

Ryumin closed the popped-up system window.

33 runes and skills, the Thanatos equipment set, and finally, the level 635 and millions of stats she had last recorded.

Everything was restored to its original state.

'I should be able to defeat Chaos with this. Even Gaia.'

Ryumin, who had been wearing a confident smile, looked at Chronos with a regretful expression.

[Were you reviewing the operation?] [Yes.] [I'm sorry. Shall we review it once more?]

Ryumin and Chronos were planning a strategy against Chaos and Gaia.

No matter how much power she had regained from the past, facing them alone would be challenging.

Chronos's assistance was absolutely necessary.

Chronos also found himself in a situation where he needed her help.

'It would have been better if Mindojun-nim were here too...'

In this operation, the god of massacre, Mindojun, had to be excluded.

His body was one that couldn't escape from her dimension.
ChatGPT

[First, Black Scythe-nim, you need to secure the Terra buried in Drakania. Once you do that, Gaia, who has formed an alliance with Chaos, will surely appear. At that moment, I will open a rift in spacetime and pull everyone into the interstices of spacetime.] [So, we fight each other in that rift?] [Exactly. Since it's a spacetime I created, you won't be able to escape until you defeat me.]

In short, it was a declaration that they would forcibly initiate a fight in an octagon where no one could escape.

[Will things go as planned?] [Don't worry, Black Scythe-nim. If we follow the strategy I devised, there won't be any problems. Should we synchronize our breathing in preparation for the battle?]

With a nod, Ryumin drew her scythe.

After some practice with Chronos, they were ready.

[When should we depart?] [As soon as possible would be preferable.] [Understood. Let's go right now. Secure the Terra, and then lure them in.] [Of course. Don't worry; I'll always be watching from the Celestial Realm.]

With a determined look, Ryumin stepped into the warp gate installed in Paradise.

[Coordinates set.] [See you later.]

With a shimmering sound, Ryumin's body disappeared without a trace.

A desolate land that could rival the name "Land of Death," Drakania.

Ryumin stepped foot there once again.

[There's no time.]

Thud!

As soon as she arrived, Ryumin, who started running, headed towards the mountain range where Terra was buried.

Having already identified the location, there was no hesitation.

[We need to secure Terra as quickly as possible.]

Chronos was scheduled to arrive here with a slight time difference.

Even if they were a bit late, it was better to avoid detection immediately upon leaving Paradise.

[They're probably watching my actions from Paradise.]

Her task was to obtain Terra, lure in Gaia and Chaos, and then, after joining forces with Chronos, engage in a 2v2 battle, as the two of them had planned.

[Here it is.]

Behind the altar, beyond the dragon's mountain range, a large pit came into view.

In this place, a massive amount of Terra, stored by Gaia, was said to be dormant.

Thud!

Without hesitation, as she threw herself into the pit, a bright light surged towards Ryumin.

The light, which sparkled and reacted, suddenly transformed like a storm, engulfing Ryumin.

[Urgggh!]

An immense amount of Terra surged into her bloodstream and flooded her entire body.

It felt like her body would burst at any moment, but she was a transcendent being and a vessel for Terra.

There were no limits to the amount she could endure.

Aaaaah!

Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-crrash!
ChatGPT

Suddenly, an explosion occurred in the pit.

The mountain shook as if it were a volcanic eruption, but strangely, the person involved, Ryumin, remained unharmed.

Thud!

Like a bomb had gone off, Ryumin jumped out of the mess that the pit had become.

"That was quite a noisy sound."

Certainly, with an explosion of this magnitude, even Gaia, who claimed to penetrate all movements of the earth, would not be unaware.

"It's over there! I heard the sound from over there!" "Huh? Hey, there's a human there!" "Krrrr! Is that the one? The traitor of Gaia who betrayed the Dragon Lord?" "Kill her! Kill her right now!"

Having heard the commotion, hundreds of dragonkin ascended the mountain.

"The opponent we're facing is dragonkin." "With the Dragon Slayer title effect, all stats are doubled."

Feeling her stats doubling, Ryumin summoned her scythe.

"If you want to kill me."

Kiiiiing-

The power infused with moonlight and Terra made the scythe vibrate.

"Prepare dozens of dragon trucks to kill me, it won't be enough."

As she rotated once, the Moonlight Island expanded its range to 360 degrees, sweeping down the entire mountain like a moonlit whirlwind.

Kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-kwa-crash!

The deathly moonlight that cut down all trees, rocks, and terrains also mowed down hundreds of dragonkin.

[Experience Points +413,920,293] [Experience Points +309,528,901] [Experience Points +598,230,138]

............

......

[Your level has increased!] [Your level has increased!] [Your level has increased!]

............

......

[Reached level 740!]

With just one Moonlight Island, turning the surroundings into rubble, Ryumin murmured.

"To face me, you'll need to summon Gaia." "Are you looking for me?"

A voice that could be heard even though there were no survivors.

Ryumin couldn't forget that sound, as if it echoed through the ground.

"There you are, Gaia."

There was no one where Ryumin was looking.

However, shortly after,

Tsuuuu-

Gaia, now taking the form of a middle-aged woman, gazed at Ryumin with an expressionless face.

"The atmosphere has changed a lot since we last met." "Where is Chaos?"

Gaia seemed a bit surprised at Ryumin's words.
ChatGPT

[Surprising. Did you know that I joined forces with Chaos?] [I did. I even knew that you and Chaos were targeting Chronos.] [Even knowing that, you boldly appeared to target Terra. Have you lost your mind?] [With just Terra, I can easily crush both of you.]

Gaia's eyes narrowed at the defiant statement.

"Arrogant... trying to ruin our affairs with a toy theme." "I'll ask again. Where is Chaos?" "Here, insignificant human."

As Ryumin searched, the space opened, and the familiar eye of Chaos appeared as if it had been waiting.

"Look, look, and I can't watch anymore because it's so astounding. Instead of hiding like a mouse, you appear like this, even though you know that you collaborated with Gaia. You seem really eager to die." "Shouldn't you repay the debt you owe?" "Hmph, getting a little Terra makes you act all high and mighty." "Even though that Terra is worth 10 billion, it's still impressive."

As Ryumin mentioned, the Terra she had absorbed a while ago amounted to a staggering 10 billion.

An ideal amount to kill Chaos.

However, Chaos, without showing any signs of surprise, just chuckled.

"You foolish human. Seems like you don't grasp the subject. Do you know who the presence in front of you is? It's Gaia, called the goddess of creation. And I am Chaos, known as the god of destruction. Do you think that mere 100 billion Terra is significant when we are combined? Try having 1 trillion. See if it can be a match for us." "Well, you only know if it's long or short after seeing it, don't you?" "Even if you don't see it, you know what you don't know, only you don't know it." "What do you mean by not knowing...?"

At that moment, Chaos, Gaia, and Ryumin fell into a gap of pitch-black dimensions.

Chronos, who appeared unexpectedly, had opened spacetime as planned and pushed everyone into it.

"What the heck!"

When they regained their senses, all three of them were in an unknown and spatial gap.

It was what they called the interstice of spacetime.

"Uh, where is this... the interstice of spacetime that only Chronos can open?" "Damn it, we fell for it. Chronos is here."

They were trapped in a dimensionless space where time did not flow.

"Quickly, try something! Honey!" "It's impossible. This is an infinite space, like a black hole. It's not a place where you can escape with spatial leap."

Although the two were trapped, it didn't mean there was no way out.
ChatGPT

[If he opened the interstice of spacetime, Chronos will also be here.] [Right! If we kill that guy, we can get out!]

Gaia and Chaos glared with determination, searching for Chronos.

However, to their surprise, Chronos was right in front of them.

Taking on the form of a human.

"Father, mother. The son you've been looking for has returned. Aren't you glad?" "Chronos! You stupid brat!" "Finally, we meet, you little brat!"

To utter curses right after seeing their son after so long.

Chronos closed his eyes with a self-deprecating smile.

It had been a while since he had seen his son, but it seemed the greeting was full of obscenities.

Regardless of why he desired his own power so much, it didn't matter now.

It was fine.

Nothing mattered anymore.

"I'll just kill you both. And then, I will regain my freedom." "Chronos! What kind of disrespectful talk is that to your parents!" "You, you damn brat!"

Chronos' gaze turned towards Ryumin.

"Let's begin." "Yes."

Ryumin, brandishing her scythe, rushed forward first.
