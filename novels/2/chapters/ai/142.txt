Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 142"

Challenge Accepted

Gonamcheol honestly didn't like the Black Scythe.

"Believe and follow someone who doesn't even reveal their face as a squad leader. I'm not that naive."

Whether it's the Black Scythe or not doesn't matter.

Isn't trust between people more important?

"How do we conduct the duel?"

"First, move to a wide area."

As Ryumin went outside, the members followed.

"Namcheol, fighting."

"Thank you."

"Flatten your nose a bit for me."

"I'll leave it to you."

Some had already become friendly and whispered words of encouragement to Gonamcheol.

Ten members came out to the front yard of the gathering place.

Everyone watched the two with curious eyes.

A night duel under the lamplights.

"It would have been nice if there were popcorn or something."

"Haha, true."

Watching the squeaky audience, Ryumin chuckled.

"Laugh freely now. After this guy is done, it's your turn."

Ryumin had no intention of dueling only with Gonamcheol from the beginning.

He planned to duel with all ten present here.

Of course, it wasn't just for the sake of a simple fight.

It was to assess their skills, talents, and determination as the squad leader.

"Come a bit closer. I need to send a duel request."

"Got it."

The two stood facing each other with a distance of 10 meters.

Manipulating something in the air, Ryumin thought of a message visible only to Gonamcheol.

[The opponent in front of you has challenged the nickname 'Busan Fighter' to a duel.] [Duel Type ▶ Non-lethal Simple Combat] [Victory Condition ▶ Inflict any amount of damage] [If the opponent wins ▶ Fix Busan Fighter's dialect, acknowledge as squad leader] [If Busan Fighter wins ▶ Resign from the position of the opponent's squad leader] [Opponent's Penalty ▶ Prohibition of all equipment and skill usage] [Busan Fighter's Penalty ▶ None] [Will you accept the duel under these conditions? Y/N]

While Gonamcheol was bewildered by the message, Ryumin spoke.

"If you accept, the duel will proceed according to the conditions written there."
ChatGPT

"What's this penalty thing?"

"It's literally penalties we each set for ourselves."

"Then..."

"Yeah. As you can see, I'm going to deactivate all my items and face you. I won't use any skills either."

"..."

Gonamcheol's mouth twitched.

Being a squad leader was messing with a man's pride.

"Don't misunderstand it as looking down on you. It's to balance things out. I can't seriously fight someone at level 89 wearing equipment when they're at level 40."

"Then what about this victory condition?"

"It's what each person has to abide by when they win. Like a kind of bet, you know? Of course, you can't violate the agreement. The moment you accept, the system forces you to act accordingly."

"..."

Gonamcheol looked at what he had to abide by if he won.

"If I win, I have to resign from the position of squad leader?"

Since it was forcing actions, he couldn't go back on it.

Of course, assuming he wins.

"It's reasonable, kid. No matter how high your level is, you can't ignore the power of equipment."

Just by calculating the stats, an 89-level without equipment would be similar to a 40-level with full gear.

No, the 40-level might even be higher, especially with good equipment.

That's why Gonamcheol was confident.

His equipment was better than anyone else's.

"It wasn't allowed against the opponent, but most of my equipment is rare. I even have a unique one."

The items played a significant role in him reaching level 40.

"Even if your level is high, if you don't wear equipment, your stats will be extremely low. Then, there's no way to win."

With that thought, Gonamcheol confidently accepted.

[A duel has been established.] [The duel between the two will begin in 10 seconds.]

This message was transmitted to everyone nearby.

Gonamcheol widened the distance with a serious gaze.

"Don't make me regret setting my own penalty."

However, there was one fact he overlooked.

No matter how much equipment Ryumin didn't wear, each of his stats was close to 300.

[Bing! The duel begins!]

Tada datadat -

As soon as it started, Gonamcheol closed the distance.
ChatGPT

In the hands of the Blade Master at level 40, a sharp short sword gleamed.

Considering the claim of invincibility, he was genuinely planning to go all out.

As the distance closed, he sequentially used three skills.

"Dogi, Kkwedo, Dance of Blades!"

A blue light emanated from the short sword, increasing its weapon attack power by 70%.

With the Kkwedo buff, the attack speed also soared by 70%.

Subsequently, Gonamcheol's body moved brilliantly, like a dance of blades, aiming to overpower his opponent.

Tak tak tak tak tak -!

"Huh?"

However, right after using the skills, Gonamcheol couldn't help but look surprised.

It was because he saw the opponent deflecting the skills with the blade of his hand.

"Does this make sense? He deflected all the skills with his hands?"

It wasn't just an ordinary attack; the skill inflicted five times the usual damage.

And he deflected each one with his hands?

It was an impossible feat unless he accurately read the trajectory of the blades and swiftly deflected them with precise speed.

"This, this can't be happening. It must be a coincidence. If I try harder, surely the result will be different."

Despite witnessing it, Gonamcheol swung his sword.

However, as if knowing the path of every attack, Ryumin deflected the blades with his hands.

Without moving from his spot.

"This is insane, absolutely insane."

It wasn't like a choreographed scene from a movie; how could someone deflect weapons with bare hands?

No, it would be impossible even in a movie.

At that moment, a familiar notification appeared in his field of vision.

[Dance of Blades cooldown has ended.]

"Alright. Let's see you block this one!"

Gonamcheol's sword danced once again.

Despite the momentum, Ryumin effortlessly deflected them with his palms.

Tak tak tak tak tak -!

Deflecting all the attacks just like before, Gonamcheol wore a dumbfounded expression once again.

Of course, for Ryumin, it was nothing surprising.

"If I can dodge bullets with Agility 300, stopping these moves is a piece of cake."

With the Rune of Foresight, blocking attacks of this speed was not challenging.

"Seems like your mental fortitude is as fragile as a hair. Shall we finish this up?"

After blocking the second attempt, Gonamcheol no longer dismissed it as a coincidence.
ChatGPT

He was just swinging the sword with a face that seemed to have "defeat" written on his forehead meaninglessly.

Swish-!

"Crunch!"

After dodging the sword, he delivered a Body Blow, and the sound of ribs breaking echoed.

However, the pain was brief.

[The duel has ended. The opponent has won.] [Executing the correction of Busan Fighter's dialect and acknowledging him as the squad leader, as he lost under the nickname 'Busan Fighter.']

As soon as the message appeared, it was as if time had reversed, and the pain disappeared.

The broken ribs, which had seemed out of place, were now back in their original position.

While it was fortunate that the injuries were healed, the mental damage remained.

Gonamcheol, feeling the stark difference in skill, lowered his head in frustration.

"I've lost. As promised, I'll acknowledge you as the squad leader. I'll also fix my dialect."

"Good. I appreciate that."

Ryumin smiled and looked around at the other squad members.

They all had their mouths wide open, remembering the scene of the duel.

What did I just witness? Did he really deflect all the attacks with his hands?

This is insane. Is this the rumored power of the Black Scythe?

How can he avoid getting a scratch?

Even without any items, facing like this?

Is it true that the level 89 is this powerful?

They were continuously shocked and impressed by the unbelievable display of skill.

However, that sense of awe was short-lived.

"Hey, anyone wish there was popcorn here?" Ryumin asked the squad members.

"Yes? Uh, me?"

"Yeah. Come closer. Let's have a round."

"Oh, no. I'll acknowledge it. It's clear that the Black Scythe's prowess is unmatched. Haha..."

"Hmm, it seems like you're not listening to your squad leader's words already."

"Yes?"

"I don't like repeating myself. Go on."

"...I'll go."

The squad member approached Ryumin, tearfully accepting his fate.

"Wait for the rest. Since they all have to face me one-on-one."

"... "

The faces of the other squad members turned pale.

Ryumin dueled individually with each of the 10 squad members.

He displayed ghostly skills, deflecting weapons with his hands, just like he did with Gonamcheol.

As a result, the squad members couldn't even look at Ryumin.
ChatGPT

Using skills, fakes, changing attack patterns—no matter what he tried, Ryumin effortlessly blocked everything with his bare hands, amplifying the sense of helplessness beyond imagination.

"Everyone, thanks for your efforts in the duels. It must have been tough, so take a seat and rest."

"..."

There was no physical strain on them, only mental exhaustion. The squad members looked at Ryumin with eyes filled with awe, even though they couldn't see his face beneath the mask. They could tell the squad leader before them hadn't shed a single drop of sweat.

He's a monster, really.

He didn't even wear any items, and yet the opponent couldn't do a thing.

Being the top ranker is on a different level.

In the face of such a vast difference, the squad members involuntarily lowered their heads. Feelings of defeat and helplessness engulfed them. Some even found themselves resenting the Black Scythe that they had been carrying around like a trophy.

"Since I lost in the duel, you all acknowledge me as the Black Scythe, right? I believe this is more than enough to prove my qualification as the squad leader?"

"Yes..."

While he had proven his qualification, he was a squad leader who killed the squad members' morale and invited resentment. However, it was not yet time for resentment.

"Sit down and tell me your impressions of the duels, one by one. First, Gonamcheol."

"Yes?"

"Your movements, judgment, momentum, everything is good, but the skill utilization is lacking. The Blade Master's skills aren't meant to be used like that. You activated Dogi and Kkwedo buffs and then used Dance of Blades, but the skill didn't apply the increased values of the two buffs. Instead, using the skill only incurred a delay. So, if you were going to use it, you should have used Dance of Blades first after applying the buffs, or buff first and then wait for an opening to time the skill. Personally, I recommend changing your attacking habits to the latter style. Dance of Blades has a casting delay, so using it when retrieving the knife helps reduce the delay."

"..."

"Next is Hwang Manki. As a Gladiator, your movements are good, but you rely too much on the Rage skill and neglect defense. Lowering your weapon below the chest during a battle is no different from surrendering or asking to be killed. It seems more like a habit than mere carelessness, so fix it."

"..."
ChatGPT

"Next is Kang Sihyuk. Excellent in all aspects among the squad members, including skill utilization, judgment, and combat sense. He even mixes in skills with fakes. However, there's a tendency to easily give up when predicting the opponent's strength. I understand, but it would have been better if you had shown enough perseverance to try until the end. It's regrettable."

"Oh... Thank you. I'll correct it."

Kang Sihyuk spoke sincerely.

On the other hand, the squad members were all surprised.

How did he know his own name and occupation without being told?

It wasn't surprising at all.

As a squad leader, it was natural for him to be familiar with the squad members' personal information.

What surprised them was something else.

He didn't duel just to suppress us but to give feedback?

It wasn't to boost morale?

-No wonder he could finish quickly but chose not to...

The squad members, who hadn't known about such intentions in the duel, wore bewildered expressions.

Especially when he listed their strengths and weaknesses, providing feedback like a pair of tongs, it was even more astonishing.

It felt like receiving an unexpected gift.

At the same time, the squad members' perception changed.

Just a moment ago, their eyes showed loss and resentment, but now they were filled with admiration and goodwill.

They realized that the man with the Black Scythe wasn't just strong in terms of power.

"I hope you reflect on your weaknesses through this duel... Well, looking at your expressions, I don't think there's anything to worry about. Now that we're done with one-on-one training, shall we move on to theoretical education?"

"Yes, Squad Leader!"

"Please, Squad Leader!"

Ryumin chuckled.

Unlike the beginning, the squad members were now filled with determination.
