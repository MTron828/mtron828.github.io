Title: Episode 298 of the 100th Rebirth of a Max Level Player

Temporary Alliance

Without much time for deep thought, Minjuri turned her body to confirm.

A Dark Ancient Tree was staring at her.

"Ah...!"

Caught.

She had been moving forward without considering what might be behind her.

Grrrr-

A bizarre howling sound accompanied the tree branch reaching out.

Swish-!

"Phew."

Minjuri was horrified as she narrowly avoided a tree branch grazing her side.

If she had been a little slower, it could have pierced her heart.

"I thought it was slow, but it's incredibly fast?"

Her feet were slow, but the attacks were swift.

Minjuri, realizing this wasn't the time for it, swiftly dodged the approaching branches.

Swish- Swish-!

Darting around the trees, she ran as if possessed.

She knew she couldn't win against trees with that speed.

She could only trust her buffed-up leg movement speed.

Thinking she had created enough distance, Minjuri looked back.

"It seems like it can't catch up, only fast in attacking."

She thought it was fortunate, but Minjuri overlooked something.

Huh?

Huh.

"Ah..."

Seeing three monsters all staring at her, Minjuri froze.

"I have to go back the way I came..."

As Minjuri turned around, she couldn't help but be astonished.

"Seo Arin...?"

The player who had been chasing her just a moment ago, Seo Arin, was now surprisingly close.

"What happened? We were at least 500 meters apart a moment ago."

The distance had closed while she was focused on the monsters.

Just as Seo Arin noticed Minjuri, she stopped walking.

Their eyes met, but there was no time for greetings.

"Let's run. The monsters are coming!"

Minjuri quickly warned, rushing past Seo Arin.

However, there was no sign of panic on Seo Arin's face, as if she had no intention of running away.

Instead, she walked towards where the monsters were.

With a puzzled expression, Minjuri stopped running and shouted, "What are you doing? It's dangerous over there..."

Thump, thump, thump -

As three Golems jumped to draw the monster's aggro, two Soul Knights appeared on the side and skillfully cut the tree branches.

Swoosh, swoosh!

Kieeeak!

The monsters let out terrifying screams, and four Fairies simultaneously shot rays at them.

Crrrrrack!

Amidst the agonizing pain, the trees transformed into firewood under the ruthless slashing of the Soul Knights.

Minjuri, who watched the scene blankly, felt an unexpected sense of confusion.

The warning seemed pointless now that the monsters had been neatly taken care of.

"What did I say earlier? It was dangerous, wasn't it?"

"...Y-yes, I knew it was dangerous."

Minjuri, who answered like that, suddenly changed her attitude and glared with a resentful look.

"But why did you follow me?"

"Follow you?"

"Don't play innocent. Did you think Seo Arin wouldn't notice you approaching me?"

"Approach me? Me?"

"The distance closed, didn't it?"

Making a bewildered expression at those words, Seo Arin let out a sigh.

"I don't know what delusions you have, but I was just looking for a hunting ground. I happened to come this way."

"So, you didn't follow me?"

"Why would I follow you?"

"The reason is clear enough."

Minjuri's words made Seo Arin momentarily think, and then she sighed again.

"Do you think I came after you to kill you or something?"

"That's the only conclusion I can draw from my perspective."

"Hah, what do you take people for? Even if we're competitors, I don't plan to commit murder to take possession of the Black Scythe."

"Black Scythe? What are you talking about? You said Seo Arin likes Minji."

"Oh!"

Flustered, Seo Arin closed her mouth like a trap.

Due to the confusion of equating Ryu Min and the Black Scythe, a slip of the tongue occurred.

"R-right. I like Ryu Min."

"But a moment ago, you mentioned taking possession of the Black Scythe as if it were a goal."

"I, I misunderstood."

"There's nothing else to misunderstand. The two have completely different styles...."

Minjuri mumbled to herself, but that was it.

She didn't press the matter any further.
ChatGPT

Seo Arin let out a silent sigh of relief.

"Black Scythe asked me to keep the secret, so I shouldn't talk about it."

Anyway, even if she did, Minjuri probably wouldn't believe it.

Wasn't Minjuri the one who didn't believe it even after hearing the words directly from Black Scythe?

"Why doesn't she know a bit when it's somewhat suspicious? Is it because we were high school classmates?"

Perhaps being high school classmates was the reason she didn't suspect anything.

Because the image of the fragile Ryu Min from back then was engraved in her mind.

"Even so, how can she be so clueless..."

Minjuri gave her a scornful look as she slightly raised her head.

"What's wrong? That unpleasant look?"

"It's nothing."

"By saying that, it feels even more unpleasant."

"Don't I feel more unpleasant hearing such comments from someone younger?"

"What does it matter how much of an age difference there is?"

"Aren't two years of age difference significant on your end too? Did you eat together with seniors at school?"

"What are you saying?"

An unnecessary argument erupted in the untimely forest.

Although it wasn't suitable to converse given the surroundings were surrounded by monsters, they seemed indifferent, tearing into each other.

"Why did you enter such a forest without strength?"

"Don't be mistaken. Do you think I entered because I wanted to? The starting point was here."

"If I hadn't appeared, you would have died helplessly."

"Even if you ignore the buffer, it wouldn't have happened. I could have handled it alone."

"Who was the one running away in fear just now?"

"Are you scared of poop? I avoided it because there's no need to fight."

"Then I guess you could have easily escaped the forest without me?"

"I could have done that even without you."

"Fine, I'll go ahead. Don't worry, I'll leave some monsters for you to hunt, Minjuri."

"Yeah, yeah. Thanks a lot."

As the two of them exchanged barbs, they both turned their heads simultaneously at the sound of a fart.

As if they couldn't stand the sight of each other.

"If Seo Arin goes back to where she came from, she'll find the exit."
ChatGPT

Minjuri was lost in her thoughts and took a step, while Seo Arin also turned her steps towards where Minjuri had been.

As they walked in opposite directions, distancing themselves from each other, a sudden stop by both of them occurred, as if they had made some unspoken agreement.

It was none other than a message that had come to mind.

[The first death has occurred.] [The deceased player's nickname is 'VeryGood.'] [Since 10 minutes have passed after death, we will proceed to eliminate the player.] [Current remaining players: 142] [Eliminated players: 1] [Time left until the end of the round: 71:31:38]

The two of them were unaware that a death notification had appeared.

They didn't know who the person with the nickname was.

The timing wasn't right, considering they were engaged in a verbal spat.

"A player is down..."

"It hasn't even been 30 minutes since it started..."

With a sense of urgency, Seo Arin and Minjuri looked at each other, as if they had made a promise.

It wasn't the time to waste unnecessary emotions.

They had to be cautious, as other players might target them.

Though they couldn't be sure that a player had died.

"Um... Seo Arin?"

"Why, what is it?"

Minjuri hesitated and nervously bit her lower lip.

Then, as if gathering courage, she bit down harder on her lower lip.

"Um, would it be okay if we stick together for a while?"

"...."

"No, I-I mean, you just saw the message, right? Someone died. We don't know if they were killed by a monster or a player, but... it might be dangerous to go alone, don't you think?"

"I'm not in danger. As you can see, my summoned creatures are strong enough."

Although Seo Arin dismissed it with a single bounce, Minjuri gathered more courage.

"Even so, you can't handle threats alone at the level of Black Scythe. You never know when and what kind of danger might arise."

"Well... I admit that."

"So, even though you might not like it, how about forming a temporary alliance? If I cast buffs, you and your summoned creatures will become twice as strong."

"Hmm..."

There was no flaw in Minjuri's proposal.

It would be foolish to miss the opportunity to become twice as strong.

'Not that Minjuri would ambush me or anything.'
ChatGPT

How dangerous could it be for a buffer without any combat skills to launch a surprise attack? Moreover, for 24 hours, her summoned creatures would act as bodyguards.

'Is she not considering that I might launch a surprise attack in return? What part of me does she trust to make such a proposal?'

It seemed that Minjuri didn't think Seo Arin would attack.

So, she could make such an unfavorable proposal.

"Alright. Let's cooperate for a while. But we shouldn't stab each other in the back."

"If you say that, it's nagging."

"Let's agree to give up on betraying each other. What do you think?"

Minjuri nodded as if she liked the idea.

"We shouldn't betray each other. Both me and Seo Arin."

As Ryu Min's name came up, Minjuri's gaze became more serious.

Seo Arin also wore a solemn expression, as if she couldn't give up on Ryu Min.

"Please cast the buffs. I'll ask my summoned creatures to protect Minjuri."

"Alright."

Minjuri's set of three buffs was applied to Seo Arin.

As a result, not only Seo Arin but also her summoned creatures became stronger.

They strengthened according to Seo Arin's stats.

"Thank you."

"It's not that big of a deal."

"Since it's dangerous here, let's get out of the forest for now."

"Sure."

As Seo Arin took the lead with her summoned creatures, Minjuri followed.

Rustle, rustle!

The Dark Ancient Trees were quite formidable monsters, but they were no match for the duo.

"Stay a bit closer. It's dangerous if you get too far away."

"Oh, okay."

As Minjuri, who had been walking a bit apart, got closer.

Swoosh!

Suddenly, a tree branch sprang out from the side.

However.

Kieeeak!

The scream came not from Minjuri but from the monster.

Seo Arin's Soul Knight appeared at the perfect timing and cut through the tree branch.

"Don't worry. My Soul Knight will protect you, Minjuri."

"Oh... thank you."

"It's not that big of a deal."

Having decided to cooperate, the two of them decided to exit the forest, for now. Although they wished to track down Black Scythe, it was impossible.

Most players who saw the mission were taken aback.

Not so much because of the 72-hour survival aspect, but more due to the requirement of reducing the number of players to 72 or fewer by killing others.

Even Kristin was bewildered.

'I have to kill others like in the 4th round? I can't do that....'

In the 4th round, she knew they would resurrect, allowing her to get away with shedding some blood.

However, this time, she was told she had to kill others for real, and if she died, there was no chance of revival even after 10 minutes.

'Can I really bring myself to kill others?'

She had a job that saved lives, yet she had to participate in murder.

A gloominess crossed Kristin's face, but only for a moment.

She realized that she didn't necessarily have to kill.

Seeing the message about the first death, she thought, 'Even if I don't kill, someone else will.'

In that case, there was no need for her hands to be stained with blood.

She just had to wait until the number of players became 72 or fewer.

Then, she could survive without shedding a drop of blood.

Unlike the 4th round, where killing each other was the goal, this time, survival was the ultimate quest objective.

'If it's about survival, I'm confident. I have healing skills, after all.'

Heal was a skill that not only healed wounds but also restored health.

Though Kristin lacked combat abilities, she was confident in enduring.

'I should go to a place with no monsters if possible.'

However, Kristin's starting point was none other than a forest.

When she activated the exploration skill, she realized the area was packed with monsters.

'I have to get out of this forest, no matter what.'

Then, it happened.

[The second player has died.] [The player's nickname is 'abcdef.'] [Since 10 minutes have passed after death, we will proceed with player elimination.] [Current remaining players: 141] [Players eliminated: 2] [Time remaining until the round ends: 71:23:52]

'Another death? It hasn't even been 10 minutes since the first player died?'

Could anyone really want to kill a fellow survivor so soon?

In the previous round, didn't they team up to face the demons together?

'I don't know... For now, I have to focus on my own survival....'
ChatGPT

At that moment, as she turned her body with such thoughts.

Crackling-

Kristin's body froze like ice.

A notorious monster, an Ogre, was looking down at her with ferocity.
