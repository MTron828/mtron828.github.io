Title: Episode 305 of the 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player

Marbas

[A twentieth death has occurred.] [The deceased player's nickname is 'NopainNogain.']

When Fluctus learned of the death of the seed he had planted, he harbored no regrets.

His lips were only filled with a smirk.

"So, you finally died." "Is it true that the human planted the devil's seed?" "Yes."

Bazago, ranked 3rd in the Skeleton-faced hierarchy, flashed his red eyes.

"I located the position, and the death occurred 5 km away from here." "Who killed him?" "The Black Scythe."

Upon hearing the name, Fluctus let out a laugh.

To think that he would have to kill a comrade with his own hands.

Whether the Black Scythe succeeded in annoying Den or not, Fluctus didn't care.

"He died earlier than expected. I anticipated that the Black Scythe would kill him, but still."

It's challenging for other players to kill humans injected with the devil's seed.

Since they gain a different level of combat power after receiving a portion of his strength.

Curious about Fluctus' regretful expression, Bazago asked, "Are you disappointed? Just because you lost one piece on the board?" "What's regrettable about an uncontrollable guy dying? It's just disappointing that other humans haven't died more."

Fluctus had hoped to turn NopainNogain into a demon and make him kill numerous humans.

However, the plan ended with the demonized human dying due to the unexpected appearance of the Black Scythe.

"Well, thanks to Moros giving information, at least I got rid of one key connection."

Fluctus wanted to demonize humans one by one, but he couldn't misuse his power by detaching it.

Moreover, the condition was that the human must be filled with a desire for slaughter.

"Perhaps that's why I brought these 72 noble demons?"

Fluctus looked at the subordinates next to Bazago.

The 4th and 5th in the hierarchy stood side by side in a motionless posture.

[Report the situation, Bazago.] [I will report. Currently, according to the orders, high-ranking demons up to rank 10 have arrived in the Otherworld. They are executing the command to slaughter players as soon as they arrive.] [You must have used a route that won't be detected when coming here, right?] [That's correct. We used the path opened by Lord Artaros, so there should be no issues.] [It's not "there should be no issues," it's "there must be none." If it catches the eye of another god, it will not only be troublesome for me but also for Lord Artaros.] [We are handling it as quietly as possible.] [Good. That's why I called you eight.]

Eight demon nobles appeared in the Otherworld.

Rank 1 Baal and Rank 2 Agaros had already died in the previous round, so only those from rank 3 to 10 were summoned to participate in hunting humans.

Fluctus glanced at Bazago, ranked 3rd, Gamigin, ranked 4th, and Marbas, ranked 5th.

[Except for you three who arrived late, the rest seems to have scattered and are killing humans.] [Yes. By the way...]

Bazago, noticing a sharp tone, was the first to lower his head.

"We apologize for arriving late." "I apologize, Lord Bazago." "I'm sorry."

As the three bowed in unison, Fluctus's discomfort eased.

"Well, if things are busy, it can happen. It's actually better this way. If we had appeared all at once, the gods might have noticed."

"Thank you for understanding." "Isn't it time to just kill all the humans now?"

Even as they spoke, the number of deaths had exceeded thirty.

With the high-ranking demons he summoned actively hunting humans, the rate of death was increasing.

"In reality, interference by demons in the game of Celestials is a violation of the rules, but..."

Whatever, who cares.

With Archangel Artaros supporting and a god from a much higher origin behind, in case things went wrong.

"If things go wrong, that bastard Artaros will handle it."

He just needed to release his subordinates as ordered, eliminate all players except the Black Scythe, and disappear.

"Now you can go. Be as efficient as possible in hunting." "Understood." "To hunt efficiently, spread out." "Of course. The humans here are a weak race that can be easily dealt with even alone, right?"

Without saying a word, Bazago and other demon nobles, including themselves, showed confident expressions as if they had planned to act alone.

Fluctus wasn't particularly worried.

Demon nobles ranked 3rd, 4th, and 5th were equivalent to skillful players of the 3rd rank of Archangels.

Even if all the players here stuck together, it was certain that they couldn't win against such formidable power.

However, there was just one person who bothered him.
ChatGPT

[No room for complacency. I'll say it again, Black Scythe. Never, under any circumstances, touch that human. Despite having the appearance of a human, he is undeniably a god. An irregular powerful enough to render Lord Artaros lifeless. Whether it's a direct confrontation or a surprise attack, it's out of the question. He's an opponent you must avoid at all costs.] [Rest assured on that point. His face is already well known to us. I promise that the moment even a strand of hair is visible, we will flee without looking back.] [There won't be a chance to flee. We need to return to the demon realm immediately. Since he doesn't have the ability to warp, he won't be able to follow us to the demon realm.] [Understood. You can put your worries to rest.]

Even with the reassurances from his subordinates, Fluctus couldn't easily shake off his concerns. The opponent was none other than the Black Scythe.

'Well, there shouldn't be any problems. Each of them is scattered, engaging in hunting. How could that little guy handle it alone?'

Thinking this way, even if he heard news of his subordinates being attacked, he believed he could buy time to escape.

It was at the moment when Fluctus, with a sly smile, gave the order to disperse.

[Lord Bazago, three humans are approaching within a 50m radius.]

Fluctus turned his head at Bazago's words.

They are indeed coming in this direction.

[In that case, let's go meet them.]

Fluctus, who was closest, moved first. Closing the distance in an instant, the human woman retreated with a startled gasp.

"Hehe, it seems our prey has rolled right into our hands." "That's right." "All three are human women." "Lucky for our first hunt."

The demon nobles ranked 3rd, 4th, and 5th added their remarks one by one.

It seemed that all three were quite pleasing as prey, as none of them could take their eyes off.

Fluctus spoke as if indulging them.

"I'll let you have the prey. Who's going to step forward?"

At his words, Gamigin and Marbas simultaneously looked at Bazago.

"The decision is yours, Lord Bazago." "I'm fine. I'm not interested in human women. You two decide."

At that moment, Marbas, with a lion's face, looked at Gamigin, who had a fox's face.

"Hmm. Lord Gamigin? How about letting me have it? My favorite thing is the screams of human women."

'I like it too...'

Though Gamigin only thought inwardly, seeing Marbas, who was drooling while speaking, he couldn't help but concede. Moreover, in a situation where his immediate superior had conceded, if he didn't follow suit, the situation would become awkward.

"Alright. I'll leave it to Marbas." "Thank you. Hehehe."

Once the decision was made, Fluctus spoke.

"Then, except for Marbas, the rest of you should spread out and start hunting. Bazago, you'll accompany me." "Yes, Lord Bazago."

The obedient noble demons scattered in all directions.
ChatGPT

Fluctus was no exception.

The only one left behind was Marbas.

"What, what's going on?"

Yamti couldn't comprehend the current situation.

It's not like he didn't hear the conversation.

The translation function interpreted even the words of the demon.

It was just that the situation of being left alone without understanding was puzzling.

"Only the demon with the lion's face is left, right?"

Yamti asked, firmly grasping the situation.

How did they seem so easygoing that they all left him behind?

Of course, the opponent did look formidable.

With a lion's face, a naturally dirty impression, and a physique as heavy as two brown bears combined.

"Still, wouldn't we be able to win if the three of us teamed up?"

The tamer herself, the summoner Seo Arin, and the buffer Min Juri.

Two summoners and one supporter.

Not a bad combination.

"Considering that Seo Arin's firepower is at least equivalent to three people, seeing her defeat monsters in the forest."

If she summoned all her monsters, her firepower would rival that of a summoned creature of John Delga.

"If the three of us attack together, we can win."

The three women exchanged glances, implying that they should attack together if things went awry.

The lion-faced Marbas seemed to have noticed their intention, smiling with a sinister grin.

"Pitiful humans. Do whatever you can without paying attention to me. Try struggling a bit before you die."

"......"

"......"

"......"

"Anyway, even if I give you the chance to attack first, you'll just be wary. Well then, let me make the first move. Let me hear the screams of some human or another...."

When he approached again with renewed appetite, Marbas raised his hand, the size of a bear's paw.

Clang!

The sword of the Soul Knight, stabbed sneakily, was easily blocked.

Clang- Clang- Clang!

He quickly thrust the sword, but Marbas's movements were surprisingly fast, despite his appearance.

He could block all the sword strikes with just one hand.

"Huuaaah. If you're this slow, can you even touch a strand of my fur?"

However, the Soul Knight was not alone.

Whoosh!
ChatGPT

Another knight approached from behind with a sneak attack, but Marbas, as if already aware, agilely twisted his body.

Clang- Clang- Clang!

Subsequently, the combined attack of the two knights continued, but Marbas still had a bored expression.

"This, this. It has slowed down enough to handle with one hand, hasn't it?"

Marbas, with an expression of boredom, grabbed the blade with his hand and casually snapped it.

Crack- Crack-!

The Soul Knights lost their weapons in an instant, but Seo Arin's summoned creatures weren't finished with that.

Chi-ee-eek-!

The light fired by four fairies thoroughly burned Marbas's head.

However, surprisingly, only a slight singeing on the fur occurred, and there was no visible damage.

Feeling puzzled, Seo Arin stopped her attacks. Marbas looked at her with a smiling face.

"Why? Try more. It feels warm and nice. Hehe."

"A-attack again!"

Following Seo Arin's command, the fairy, golem, and Soul Knight simultaneously attacked Marbas.

However, the combined attack proved ineffective.

"Khaaaaah-!"

The summoned creatures were cleanly annihilated with a single strike from Marbas, the lion-faced demon.

"Ahh...."

Seeing the summoned creatures disappear with just one shout, Seo Arin and Min Juri couldn't hide their shock.

'Those summon creatures that were so powerful, gone with a single strike...'

With unbelieving eyes, Min Juri asked the question.

"Ca-can you summon more? This isn't the end, right?"

"I can't summon now. I have to wait for a 10-minute cooldown to summon again."

"It ended so anticlimactically like this? What about the summon reinforcement you learned at level 60?"

"I already used it! On the Soul Knight!"

Yet, it was easily countered.

Min Juri, who had no combat abilities, had nothing to say.

'Even with all the buffs up to the support zone, we're defeated so easily...'

While the two despaired, Marbas remained leisurely.

"No need to be too desperate. It's only natural that an egg can't beat a rock."

Having confirmed that his skills were inferior to that of bugs, Marbas now had only one thing left to enjoy.

"Now then, whose limb shall I tear off first? I hope it's the human with the beautiful voice... Yes! You."

At Marbas's pointing, Min Juri was taken aback.
ChatGPT

[That voice I just heard suits my style. I was hoping to start with...you.]

At that moment,

Dozens of monsters were summoned, forming a wall in front of Marbas.

[So, there's another summoner. Well, it's just a lantern in the wind anyway.]

With a chuckle, Marbas once again roared like a lion.

[Khaaaaah-!]

The approaching monsters were annihilated in an instant.

'Hmph, how foolish.'

Marbas thought that they couldn't even buy time and disappeared meaninglessly. However, that was not the case.

[Hooho?]

The three women were now flying in the sky along with the summoned monsters.
