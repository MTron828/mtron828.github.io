Title: The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player - Episode 115

Episode 115. Elf Upper Level

[Dwarf Upper Level Escort Mission has ended.] [Current Participant Status]

└ Participants: 190

└ Betrayers: 5

The Dwarf Upper Level Escort Mission concluded with only 40 casualties.

Among them, 24 were betrayers who died at the hands of fellow humans, not monsters.

"I survived."

Ryumin and the other four managed to survive without being exposed until the end.

Of course, more challenges awaited them despite surviving.

[Since the upper level was not obstructed until the destination, all stats will decrease by 20% until the round ends.] [The betrayer group will move to the waiting area shortly.]

Avoiding detection during the extraction operation was a relief, but the failure of the group mission was a grim outcome.

This applied to betrayers other than Ryumin.

"Reaching level 70 at the Dwarf Upper Level. Unexpectedly, the experience points were scarce."

Maybe he could surpass level 80 in this round.

"It's over now, Black Scythe."

"Thank you for your hard work."

Minjuri and Seo Arin approached for a farewell.

Their expressions revealed a sense of reluctance to part ways.

"Good job. See you in the next round."

With Ryumin's words, the background changed.

Upon regaining consciousness, they found themselves standing in a gray space.

[Kyahaha, you've returned, betrayers? Oh,]

Angel Ariel squinted her delicate eyebrows.

[Only five left? Haaa. Much fewer than expected.]

"Expected? Did the angel anticipate all of us dying like this?"

[Yes. I anticipated that the betrayer identification process would quickly filter out the small number in the Dwarf Upper Level. Did you really feel at ease, thinking the difficulty was low?]

"...."

The betrayer who had initiated the conversation kept silent as if struck by a realization.

[Kyahaha, then you truly are innocent. Or stupid? Isn't it natural that it's difficult to hide one's identity when the number of people is low?]

In reality, the Dwarf Upper Level was the most challenging level for betrayer groups.

What was said to be easy was purely from the perspective of a regular group.

[Still, the fortunate thing is that there's still hope for you all. You have two chances left.]

Whether it's the Elf Upper Level or the Human Upper Level, if either one fails to reach the destination, the betrayer group can survive.

If they can prevent it, that is.

[Cheer up. The Elf Upper Level, which we'll proceed to next, won't be as difficult as this one. The number of participants is around 700.]

Betrayers, excluding Ryumin, were surprised by the number, which was more than three times the previous.

Certainly, the beautiful elves are more popular than the ugly dwarves.

[This time, the five of you should gather and strategize well. However, you'll have to endure the stat penalty. Hehehe.]

The five betrayers looked at each other.

In such a situation, there was no desire for handshakes or anything of the sort.

They just kept an eye on each other's faces, thinking about remembering who is an ally.

"Since there are only five left, let's do well this time."

"Yes. If we want to survive, we have to stick together."

"Shall we plan some strategy? Black Scythe?"

The attention of the four turned to Ryumin.

Though seeking permission felt like naturally appointing him as the leader.

"Do as you please."

Ryumin had no intention of mingling with them.

Even if there's a common goal, solo is solo.

He can't trust those who are not in his party.

"Do you, Black Scythe, not plan to join the strategy?"

"That's right. I've never seen him take the lead, even when the dwarves attacked earlier..."

One betrayer spoke but stopped talking, sealing his lips.

Ryumin's lively gaze naturally made him close his mouth.

"Why should I believe any of you? We're not even in the same party."

"But we are in the same group..."

"Just sharing the same goal doesn't change the fact that each individual is the same. Experience points come separately for that reason."

Ryumin bluntly rejected them and turned away.

"Rather than idle thoughts, it's better to go hunting."

As he declared solo play, the betrayers' expressions darkened as if betrayed.

It seems they lack confidence in attacking the Upper Level without Black Scythe.

Watching their reactions, Ariel chuckled softly.

"This is a mess. It seems even within the group, opinions aren't aligning. Well, I don't care about that, so just do whatever you want. As long as you move us to the Elf Upper Level, I'm good."

"But Angel, if we go to the Elf Upper Level, won't the players there have waited for us for five hours?"

"Oh, didn't I mention it? While the betrayer group is on a mission, time is frozen for the humans in the other Upper Levels. The humans who just finished the Dwarf Upper Level attack also experienced the same."

It meant that only the Upper Level the betrayer group participated in had time passing.

"If we don't do it this way, while you're tackling three Upper Levels, the other Upper Levels would have to spend boring time. Unnecessary suspicions could arise. So, don't worry about the other humans. Right now, what's most important is yourselves, isn't it? Kyahaha."

Listening to a more unfortunate voice than ever, the betrayers waited for their transfer.

"Shall we go to the Elf Upper Level then? Please, make sure to succeed this time."

Changing the location can be helpful for a change of mood.

The ones who realized this were none other than the betrayer group.

"Is this...?"

"The Elf Upper Level quest location?"

Unlike the dreary rocky terrain of the Dwarf Upper Level, here, lush trees filled the air with fragrance.

Moreover, the most significant difference was undoubtedly the players.

"Wow, are we starting the escort here?"

"Choosing the Elf Upper Level, and it starts in a place like an Elf village?"

"But why are there so many people?"

"I chose it because I wanted to see all elves, that's all."

As the angel mentioned, around 700 people crowded the forest.

"If there are this many people..."

"It won't be easy to confirm by poking like last time."

On one hand, the betrayers felt fortunate that there was no fear of being exposed in advance.

However,

[Betrayer group failure penalty: All stats decrease by 20%.]

The message that popped up on one side brought nothing but a sense of frustration.

Ryumin didn't pay any attention to the message.

"Even this time, it will start in the same way. Surprised by the lack of nicknames and surprised by the number of betrayers."

As Ryumin predicted, players were once again surprised, this time by the absence of each other's nicknames, after being startled by the lack of them before.

[Elf Upper Level Escort]

└ Safely escort the Elf Upper Level to its destination.

└ Upon successful escort, everyone will receive experience points as a reward.

└ One person who significantly contributes to eliminating betrayers will receive a sub-quest reward.

└ If all betrayers are eliminated without leaving any behind, an additional reward will be given to everyone.

[Current Participant Status]

└ Participants: 740

└ Betrayers: 5

"Look at this. There are five betrayers among us!"

"How do we find them?"

"How about attacking each other to find out?"

Players who were pondering started poking each other from the beginning.

However, it didn't take long for them to realize that individually stabbing over 700 people was impossible and gave up.

"Haa, we need to catch those betrayers."

"How do we find those five?"

"It's uncomfortable, like having bugs in the mouth, really."

As people sighed irritably, the betrayer group breathed a sigh of relief.

Just then, clatter-clatter—

Unfailingly, a procession of carriages appeared.

It was an incredibly long line that seemed to have no end.

"Wow, elves, elves."

"Really. They look just like the elves in the game."

"Seriously, they're identical to the elf character I raised."

Elves with pointed ears, both men and women, had features of pure white skin and beautiful appearance.

Completely different from dwarves who looked like uncles and grandpas.

Above all, the carriages without wheels, levitated by magic, caught the eye.

The noble demeanor of the elves was beyond compare.

"Greetings, warriors from another realm. As promised, you've been waiting here as agreed."

A tall elf man stepped forward and politely bowed.

"I am Yugrithor, in charge of the Magic Upper Level of Elsorium. I am truly grateful for the warriors of the sanctuary coming to greet us."

His smiling face was enough to shake the hearts of female players.

For the male players, it was an undeniably charming smile.

"Hello, warriors of the other realm. I am Yugrithor, in charge of the Magic Upper Level of Elsorium. As promised, you have been waiting here."

It was a common practice for beings from other realms to address players this way.
ChatGPT

For Ryumin, it was a familiar situation, but players conversing with beings from another realm for the first time were fascinated just by being interpreters.

"Wow, do elves really exist?"

"Or are they artificially created beings?"

"Just ask. Are you really an elf?"

"Yes? What do you mean by that?"

Yugrithor chuckled, raising his eyebrows. Ryumin couldn't help but wonder if there was a hidden meaning behind it, but to him, it seemed like a foolish question.

It was like asking a human, "Are you really a human?"

"The important thing is not whether elves really exist. It's how much benefit you can gain by using elves."

Just as he gained the Rune of Endurance by improving his reputation with the Dwarf race, there was something to gain from the elves as well.

"The elixir that is said to be given only to important guests by treating elves really well. That's what I need to obtain during this escort mission."

Then, how could he receive such special treatment from the elves?

The answer was simple.

"Just like with the dwarves last time, save their lives."

But for that to happen, the betrayers needed to make a move, and it didn't seem like they had a strong enough motivation for that.

"Even if they attack, the spirits of the land and the wind spirits surrounding the elf knights disguised as merchants will protect them. But I'll have to wait for the monsters to attack and rescue them from the crisis."

However, even if Ryumin rescued the elf merchants, he would likely only receive gratitude.

"As I said, they are elf knights from Elsorium disguised as merchants."

It was clear why the knights were disguised as merchants.

"They have something to protect."

If Ryumin successfully protected that precious thing?

Certainly, he would be treated not only as a VIP but also as a lifelong benefactor.

"Where that precious thing is..."

Ryumin's gaze scanned the caravan.

Among the 30 carriages, only the 15th carriage in the middle had a distinctly different design and pattern.

"There. There, the elf princess is hiding."

The elf princess, Yufinelsia.

If Ryumin protected her from the monster attack, he could surely get what he wanted from the elves.

At that moment, someone familiar to Ryumin appeared.

"Huh? Black Scythe?"

It was none other than Heo Taeseok.
ChatGPT

"No-pyein-noge. So, you're here."

"How did the Black Scythe...?"

"How did I? Obviously, since I chose the Elf Upper Level, I'm here."

After speaking, reading the thoughts, Heo Taeseok's question wasn't meant to inquire how he knew and made the choice.

"This guy thinks I followed him."

It was a ridiculous misunderstanding, but there was no need to correct it. Heo Taeseok, realizing his mistake, nodded to himself.

The Black Scythe can't possibly know that I chose the Elf Upper Level. So, is this fate? A fateful encounter to party with the Black Scythe again?

Heo Taeseok was determined to somehow connect himself with the Black Scythe.

"...Why are you looking at me like that?"

"Oh, no, it's nothing. Hehe..."

Heo Taeseok, who had been staring at Ryumin, turned his head awkwardly, as if embarrassed, perhaps feeling the weight of Ryumin's gaze.

'I guess he knows my intentions, making his gaze awkward.'

Quietly rolling his tongue, Ryumin felt a bit uncomfortable, but there was another person who made him uneasy.

"Black Scythe?"

"Hmm? Who are you...?"

An unexpected person approached Ryumin.
