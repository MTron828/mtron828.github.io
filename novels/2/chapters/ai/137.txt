Title: Episode 137 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Suppression Ends

"Shii-eek!"

"Kiiiiit!"

Screams of lizardmen echoed from various places.

Clatter, clatter, clatter-!

Clatter, clatter, clatter, clatter-!

Sounds of something being chopped in large quantities could also be heard.

The players' gazes converged towards the origin of the sound.

And, inevitably, their expressions turned perplexed.

"C-Crazy. Isn't that a black scythe?"

"The lizardmen chose a black scythe for subjugation?"

"By the way, what is that weapon, exactly?"

"What is it that every time it swings, ten monsters fall like dominos?"

It was a bizarre scythe.

Its length extended like a whip, slicing through the waists of ten monsters and then retracting.

The attacking speed was so fast that the swing itself couldn't be seen.

Every blink of an eye seemed to reveal a spectacle of lizards being torn apart.

Truly, the Grim Reaper's hand.

It seemed as if it was reaping the monsters' lives into pieces.

"But looking at the numbers, it seems to have come out according to our party size..."

"It's sweeping everything with that black scythe...."

Clearing monsters that were supposed to be defeated by one person each alone?

Rather than getting angry, it was simply absurd.

"..."

The NPCs, seemingly sharing the same sentiment, watched in silence.

Even Minjuri, who was staring blankly at the battle with the black scythe, suddenly realized.

"Oh, now I understand why Black Scythe said his battle wouldn't be helpful."

Indeed, how could one grasp the attack patterns and characteristics of lizardmen while carrying out a peasant massacre?

Minjuri decided it would be better to watch and learn from other players' battles.

With that judgment, Minjuri moved to a different location.

After all, the players were desperately trying to defeat the lizardmen, afraid of having their share taken by the black scythe.

Whether intentionally or not, Ryumin focused solely on massacring lizardmen.

"Do I even need to use the Moonlight Island for this?"

Originally, the plan was to use the Moonlight Island to its full potential, but considering the damage, it was unnecessary.

"I knew it was advantageous for mass slaughter, but I didn't expect it to be this effective."
ChatGPT

Thanks to Minjuri's buff, it felt like things were getting faster and stronger.

"Kiiiiit-!"

After killing the last lizardman, Ryumin turned around.

The players were watching him with resentful eyes.

"Did I kill too many?"

It wasn't strange to be resented when he swept through the monsters as if it were his own world.

Ryumin's gaze suddenly turned to a corner of his field of vision.

[Current Kill Count: 823/100]

"When I came down from the tower, it was 402. So, did I kill 421?"

With 602 people, there should have been 602 monsters. Among them, Ryumin alone took about 70%.

"That's a gaze that could send resentment."

Ryumin didn't avoid eye contact.

Players averted their eyes first, feeling awkward.

It was frustrating, but there was no other option for them as the weaker ones.

"If you're jealous, become strong like me."

Becoming strong and killing a lot were both abilities. There was no reason to see it as unfair with an envious gaze.

It was a result achieved through his own efforts.

Having lived in a competitive society, he understood this fact.

That's why no one dared to say a word to the Black Scythe.

Of course, the fear of provoking him and facing consequences played a significant role.

"It's fortunate it's not a party."

If it were a party, they might have protested to Ryumin, knowing that allies couldn't attack each other.

"No, not just not knowing, they would have definitely protested. 'Hunt more reasonably.'"

Certainly, Ryumin had no intention of monopolizing the lizardmen.

Leaving some for other players was necessary for the survival of everyone.

While pondering these thoughts, Minjuri approached and raised her thumb.

"Wow, Black Scythe. It's truly amazing. I didn't know that weapon was so good. Well, of course, it's probably because of Black Scythe's skill."

"It's a hard-earned weapon, so it's natural."

Even with compliments, Ryumin responded with a nonchalant expression.

"Have you faced the lizardmen?"

"Yes. I caught about two of them, and it was easier than I thought. Even easier than when I first killed an orc."

"I told you. You've gotten stronger."
ChatGPT

"Hehe, looks like you've really gotten strong. If you do well, you might hit level 40 in this round, right?"

She spoke cheerfully, but Minjuri was secretly worried.

If Black Scythe continues to monopolize monsters like this, it might be tough... No, the issue isn't reaching level 40; it's whether he can secure a ranking...

It was a natural concern, considering their lives were at stake. It was a concern shared by other players.

"I know. Do you think I would kill all the other players just to gain a little more experience? Don't worry."

Originally, Ryumin had planned to stop hunting after reaching a thousand kills.

"A thousand should be enough to secure the top spot for the entire area."

Even in the previous round, no player other than Ryumin had reached a thousand kills.

"Just a little more. I'm almost there."

Considering the monsters he killed in the Trial Tower would also be included in the count, he only needed to kill about 200 more.

Then, he would safely pass through.

"What level are you now?"

"Me? I'm at level 38."

"Just two more levels, and you'll learn a new skill."

Saying that, Ryumin resumed hunting when the lizardmen attacked again. Once again, the players seemed puzzled when he swept the monsters with his scythe, but only for a moment.

After Ryumin reached his goal by killing 200 more monsters and stopped hunting, a sense of confusion filled the eyes of the people.

"Why did he suddenly stop hunting?"

"Is he taking a break now?"

"Anyway, now's our chance! We don't know when he'll start again!"

However, after that moment, Ryumin didn't touch the lizardmen. The players, puzzled but at the same time relieved, asked Minjuri's innocent question.

"Black Scythe, why aren't you hunting more?"

In response to Minjuri's pure question, Ryumin answered like a true leader.

"I've killed a lot. Besides, bothering other players by killing small fry won't do any good for their experience points."

"Ah... So, is it for our sake?"

'For us. If I have to specify, it's because of you.'

Although those words almost slipped out, Ryumin forced himself to swallow them. Minjuri, misunderstanding once again, blushed and began to imagine strange things.

"There are still many monsters to kill now. Hurry up and reach level 40. I'm curious about what skill you'll learn."

"Yes! Please wait a little longer!"
ChatGPT

Minjuri energetically announced that she finally reached level 40 upon defeating 280 lizardmen.

"I've finally reached the Expert rank!"

"Congratulations! What's the skill?"

"I'll show you right away!"

Light flowed from Minjuri's hand.

Considering Minjuri's role as a buffer, the skill she learned this time was also a buff.

[Skill Safety Barrier has been activated.] [You can receive protection from one physical attack.] [Duration: 00:29:59]

Safety Barrier.

It was an absolute shield that provided protection from one physical attack.

"Normally, shields have a certain strength, but this skill is different."

It was a deceptive skill that would defend against any physical attack without exception.

In other words, it meant that even Ryumin's full-powered strike could be defended against.

It was a good skill that could save her life in unexpected ambushes.

"It seems to be a skill that blocks any physical attack once. If you want to reuse it on the same target, you have to wait for 30 minutes."

"It's a good enough skill to justify that wait."

Considering it was an absolute defensive barrier, applying a personal cooldown was not unusual.

"Later on, when the skill is enhanced at level 60, it will defend against both physical and magical attacks."

Minjuri hadn't survived beyond level 60, so she didn't know, but that was the case.

"Bless and Swift have also been enhanced. Would you like to try them out?"

"Sure."

With Minjuri's buffs, all her stats, attack speed, and movement speed increased by 70%.

This was due to the enhancement of the two skills.

"It has improved significantly. However, don't be satisfied with just reaching level 40. Keep hunting."

"Yes!"

The subjugation continued.

Some players, like Minjuri, seemed to have reached level 40, as voices of reflection echoed.

After three hours, the subjugation finally came to an end.

Captain Kaltz, the subjugation leader, looked at the players with a satisfied smile.

"Soldiers, with this, the subjugation of the Mire of the Abyss is over. Lizardmen worked so hard that even their seeds would dry up. Thanks to all of you, merchants from the nearby Brahham Kingdom can now safely travel the highway. It's all thanks to you! Hiring warriors from other realms wasn't in vain!"
ChatGPT

Kaltz, who was not sparing in his praise, suddenly fixed his gaze on someone.

A man who hadn't caught a single lizardman since his overwhelming performance in the early stages.

Kaltz, with a reverent gaze directed towards the Black Scythe, spoke.

"Great job, everyone. The subjugation is over. Disband!"

As Kaltz finished speaking, a message appeared unexpectedly.

[Lizardman Subjugation has ended.] [You are rewarded with 100,000 gold for the subjugation.] [Your contribution to the mercenary group is recorded.] [Your mercenary group rank has been upgraded from 'Novice' to 'Veteran.']

"Wow, 100,000 gold?"

"Wow, amazing!"

"Damn, the system, this son of a... it's more generous than expected, isn't it?"

Players cheered at the unexpected rewards.

On the other hand, Ryumin didn't show much excitement about the gold.

Not because he didn't appreciate it, but because he already had 1.5 million gold in his possession.

"Hey, the system, it's more generous than expected, huh?"

Players cheered at the unexpectedly generous rewards.

On the other hand, Ryumin didn't show much excitement about the gold.

Not because he didn't appreciate it, but because he already had 1.5 million gold in his possession.

"Hey, the system, it's more generous than expected, huh?"

Players cheered at the unexpectedly generous rewards.

On the other hand, Ryumin didn't show much excitement about the gold.

Not because he didn't appreciate it, but because he already had 1.5 million gold in his possession.

"Now, since most players have reached level 40, the gold trade should become more active."

Now, players could trade gold using the trading function.

Upon returning, more players would likely start using gold features rather than cash.

And merchants offering services in exchange for gold, like cleaning up corpses or finding specific people using tracking skills, would increase.

The same would be true for the Pluf Pluf Market.

Ryumin had already instructed Magyeongrok to create a gold direct trade item in preparation for this.

Although gold transactions would become active at the end of the round, Ryumin already had enough gold.

"I guess I won't have much use for this gold other than buying legendary materials from Pluf Pluf."

So, what should he do with this abundance of gold?
ChatGPT

'I should use it on none other than NPCs.'

Gold is a universally accepted currency even in the fantasy world.

With the introduction of the trading function, it becomes possible to engage in gold transactions with NPCs.

'For now, it seems like I won't have much use for gold, but later on, there will be various ways to spend it.'

Sometimes, gold goes into the billions when raising the reputation of a temple, or it is used to acquire materials or items from blacksmiths.

'It can also be used as a bribe for influential figures, and its uses are varied.'

Therefore, even if it seems useless now, having more gold will be beneficial in the future.

[Subjugation complete.] [Will move to the starting point shortly.]

As soon as he blinked, a monochromatic space appeared instead of the Mire of the Abyss.

It was the starting point.

Players appeared all over the place as the subjugation ended at the same time.

Just like the first time, when thousands of people gathered, an angel appeared.

[Have you all finished the subjugation? How was it? Wasn't the first round the easiest, as expected?]

Players nodded in agreement.

Having experienced it, the difficulty seemed to be in the correct order.

[By the way, unlike the first time, it seems like there are fewer participants, doesn't it?]

"Well, now that you mention it, it does seem like that."

[Unfortunately, out of the 571 who chose number 5, not a single person survived.]

"Gasp..."

The subjugation monster for number 5 was the Minotaur.

If one appeared per person, it would have been challenging to handle.

[In other subjugations, there were some casualties as well, but don't be too sad. It's actually a good thing that the competition has decreased, right?]

"...."

Honestly, there were no players mourning.

In an era where even family members fought against each other, who would mourn someone else's death?

[Now, let's take a look at the results of the tally!]
