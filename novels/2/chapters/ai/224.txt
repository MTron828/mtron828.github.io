Title: Episode 224 of the 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player

Decisive Battle

[Target 'Uriel' has been located.] [Currently at a distance of 601m.]

Ryumin, with black wings fluttering, checked the remaining distance in the sky.

'Getting closer.'

Finding an angel is not difficult with the tracking skill.

However, even after an hour, he didn't know if he was still in the Forest of Chaos.

'Did I spend too much time calling for reinforcements?'

He wondered how many reinforcements he called while he was away.

'Hopefully more than 99.'

With an excited heart, he activated the surrounding exploration skill.

Many red dots were scattered throughout the Forest of Chaos.

'This is... more than expected.'

Counting the numbers, it easily exceeded 100.

Approximately close to 200.

It wasn't an illusion.

As he entered within 100m, it became even more certain.

[There are 202 enemies within a 100m radius.] [With the effect of the Rune of One Hundred, all stats are increased by 100%.]

'Sure. Except for the two archangels, I called 200.'

It seemed that he called reinforcements to deal with himself, but it turned out well.

'With this, I can even stack the Devil's Blessing one more time.'

Ryumin, who was trying to suppress a laugh, slowly descended to the ground.

In the forest turned into a field of tension, Raguel and Uriel silently stared at him.

'Of course, they knew I was coming. That's why they prepared such a surprise event.'

Despite hiding behind a tree, thinking he could surprise them, Ryumin, with his detection ability, couldn't go unnoticed.

'Am I too obvious? There's no need to read minds for this.'

While the archangels in front of him attracted attention, he planned to surprise with a force of 200.

They didn't even realize they were exposed.

'Don't they know I have detection abilities?'

Whatever, it was fine.

He had gathered more sacrifices than expected.

'I want to surprise them, so they should at least pretend to be surprised.'

Ignoring the surrounding gazes on purpose, Ryumin approached the archangels.

"You guys. You're still here?"

[Some damn bug ripped off my wings.]

"Can't you walk without wings? Pitiful."

Raguel's expression crumpled at the insignificant provocation.

'Oh. Holding back the anger? Is it because of the operation?'

After sighing, Raguel spoke in a manner to draw attention.

[Why did you run away? I noticed you didn't even look back.]

"Just two of you didn't seem scary."

[Wasn't it because you couldn't use the ability to turn black?]

"Oh, this?"

Ryumin immediately used the Transcendence skill.

[...!]

Unexpectedly, Uriel and Raguel's eyes widened.

"Why? Surprised? Is the cooldown already back?"

[...].

"I ran away, so why wouldn't I come back? I'm confident, that's why."

As if about to start a battle at any moment, Uriel urgently shouted.

[Attack!]

At that signal, the 200 troops hidden in the forest revealed themselves.

[Wow!]

Fifth-grade combat angels, each wielding their weapons, rushed towards the black targets.

Even the archangels weren't just watching.

[We've been waiting for you to transform like that! Hehehe, prepare to die!]

Raguel revealed his malicious nature and charged alongside his subordinates.

Uriel, like a wizard, prepared a spell to suppress Ryumin from behind.

Despite all the angels rushing to kill him, Ryumin remained calm.

'Should I show off my skills a bit?'

The moment he decided, Ryumin disappeared like a ghost.

[Huh?]

The angels, losing their target, were momentarily dumbfounded.

The scroll of light prepared by Uriel also wrapped around the air before disappearing.

[Wh-where did this human go?]

Both Raguel and Uriel were confused, looking around.

Even the eyes of the archangels couldn't see Ryumin.

'Do archangels not see through invisibility? Or is it because of the rune of stealth that erases even the presence?'
ChatGPT

Having obtained valuable information, Ryumin moved like the wind.

Swoosh! Thud!

Sounds of something breaking and collapsing followed in sequence.

Looking at the origin of the sound, Ryumin saw angels lying dead with twisted necks.

[Ar-Archangels! Come look here, break!]

Ryumin quickly turned his head to another angel, grabbing their head.

Swoosh! Thud-

[Number of angels eliminated: 21/100]

In no time, Ryumin, who had killed over 20, rapidly filled in the numbers.

[Here, he's here! The human is here!]

A soldier shouted, but it was unnecessary to say.

Uriel and Raguel were also watching their subordinates falling with astonished faces.

"C-Crazy. What kind of speed is that?"

"It's hard to even follow with the eyes."

Ryumin's movements were as fast as a beam of light.

Once he found a target, their necks were already broken, and he was gone.

Only an afterimage remained.

There was no time for an observer's eyes to rest.

[Ki-Kill! Kill that guy!]

Even with Raguel's command, the combat angels couldn't move.

How can you kill an enemy you can't even follow with your eyes?

Even if they swung their swords, they only brushed against the afterimage.

They couldn't possibly catch up with Ryumin's movements.

Thud- Thud- Thud-!

[Damn it...!]

As the casualties continued to rise, Raguel and Uriel became anxious.

The forest was now filled with the corpses of soldiers whose necks had been broken.

[Block him! Block him! Everyone charge!]

Perhaps frustrated by being helplessly attacked, Uriel, who had been silent, shouted angrily, but there was no response.

"Damn it. At this rate, my spells..."

No matter how many fancy techniques he had, there was no spell that could catch up with that speed.

Most spells would just miss.

"I have no choice. I'll have to burn down this entire area."

Before the damage got worse, it needed to be stopped.

With that thought, Uriel raised his dagger high into the sky and began to chant a spell.

A radiant light gathered at the tip of the dagger.

[U-Uriel, sir?]

Recognizing the nature of the spell, Raguel, now more bewildered than before, had a surprised expression.
ChatGPT

[Are you really going to use that spell? If you make a mistake, our soldiers could...]

[There's no other way! Can you stop that insane monster? Huh?]

Speechless, Raguel tightly sealed his lips.

Even in his eyes, the black scythe was a monster.

It was overwhelming in speed, to the point where it couldn't be called human, even from his perspective an hour ago.

And he expected himself to stop it?

Raguel silently shook his head.

'Impossible.'

Even for his superior, Uriel, it seemed impossible as he bit his tongue, unable to utter a word.

[Even at this moment, soldiers are dying. This is the only way.] [But...]

[Don't say anything more. Your delay is affecting the spell. Tsk.] [I'm sorry.]

With a chilled tongue, Uriel continued chanting the spell.

'It's already urgent, and if I delay any longer, that thing will notice.'

But Uriel didn't know.

Even amidst his chaotic movements, Ryumin's gaze did not miss the archangels.

Therefore, he had already figured out what kind of spell it was.

'A plan to completely obliterate the area within a radius of 100m, including his subordinates.'

Ryumin, who had detected the preparation of a large-scale area-of-effect technique, looked at the message.

[Number of angels eliminated: 100/100] [The conditions for using the Devil's Blessing have been met.] [You can use the Devil's Blessing by memorizing the activation word at any time.]

He had just reached 100 and fulfilled the conditions.

[There are 102 enemy entities within a 100m radius.] [With the Rune of One Hundred, all stats are increased by 100%.]

Along with the Rune of One Hundred.

'It's time.'

Confirming that he was in the optimal state with all the stats that could be increased, Ryumin cast a buff on himself.
ChatGPT

[Received the Devil's Blessing.] [Based on the current total stats (363,417), the following effects will be applied:] [Upon defeating an angel, gain gold equal to 1x the base value (363,417). Can increase up to 1,000x (363,417,000) based on the angel's level.] [Upon defeating an angel, gain stat points equal to 0.01% of the base value (36). Can increase up to 10% (36,341) based on the angel's level.] [Upon defeating an angel, reputation with the demon faction slightly increases.] [The buff will last until the end of this round.]

The total stat is approximately 360,000.

An average of 90,000 per stat.

It was insane stats, but there was no time to be impressed.

If he didn't stop Uriel right away, precious angels would be annihilated.

'The distance is too far. In that case...'

With a swift motion, he cast the Night of Death, turning the area pitch black.

Though the 100 5th-grade angels and two archangels were momentarily confused, it didn't last long.

[Heh, you might think of canceling the spell with artificial darkness, but it's useless. Darkness that can extinguish the light of the heavens is nowhere to be found.]

As explained by Raguel, the light gathered on the dagger was still shining.

Finally, as the spell seemed to be completed, a faint smile appeared on Uriel's lips.

[Preparations are complete, Raguel. Brace yourself for the storm.]

As Uriel, about to lower the dagger to cast the storm of light and flames, prepared for the [Heavenly Wrath], a momentary flash occurred in the darkness.

Together with red eyes.

Kwakwakwakwa-kwak-!

Ryumin's Moonlight Flash wiped out 30 of the 5th-grade angels.

And also one arm of Uriel.

[Urgh...]

As his arm flew off, it was natural for the memorized spell to be canceled.

Uriel looked into the darkness where the flash had come from.

'That insect has such a powerful skill...'

It was a mistake not to investigate the skills of the Reaper, thinking it was an easy opponent.

Is that the reason?

Uriel and Raguel were surprised by the fact that Ryumin's attack was not yet over.

Kwakwakwakwa-kwak-!

[Number of angels eliminated: 67/100]

Kwakwakwakwa-kwak-!

[Number of angels eliminated: 100/100] [Conditions for using the Devil's Blessing have been met.] [You can use the Devil's Blessing by memorizing the activation word at any time.]

In just about six seconds, 100 angels vanished without a trace.

It was only natural, considering that even a slight brush with the powerful waves of moonlight caused bodies to contort and crumble.

"Th-This can't be..."

Was it shocking that all of the subordinates were killed by Moonlight Flash in three strikes?

Raguel, with eyes showing disbelief, wandered through the devastated forest.

"Wh-Where did he go? Soldiers, come out and don't hide!"
ChatGPT

However, Raguel had no time to search for the soldiers.

There were still two Moonlight Flashes left.

The intentionally diverted Moonlight Flash sliced through one of Raguel's legs as it passed.

[Argh!]

Falling to the ground, he groaned in pain, but it wasn't over yet.

Kwakwakwakwa-kwak-!

The consecutive Moonlight Flash gracefully passed, scorching Raguel's cheek.

[Ahh! My, my face! My face!]

Approaching the glowing Raguel, Ryumin commented, "You're more disgusting than bugs."

With a skeletal face, Raguel rushed forward with a crazed look.

[This bug's─ Kuk!]

The scythe swiftly pierced Raguel's heart and pulled out.

Thud-

Ignoring the fallen archangel, Ryumin walked towards Uriel.

Perturbed, Uriel cast a spell with one arm.

Thud-!

A cage of light fell from the sky, binding Ryumin.

[Got you! I caught─]

Crack-!

With a single swing, the cage shattered.

Collecting himself, Uriel calmly cast the next spell.

Whirr-!

A scroll of light appeared in the air, restraining Ryumin.

Uriel smiled with a resolute expression.

Crack-

He tore it apart with sheer strength.

Despite unleashing storms of light, exploding blades, Ryumin suffered no more than a speck of damage.

No matter what measures were taken, he couldn't delay the approaching Reaper.

Thunk-

Ryumin's steps halted only when he reached a distance reachable by extending his arm.

[You, you... Now I understand. You were hiding your power.]

"I needed soldiers."

[What? Are you saying I led soldiers here deliberately?]

"Well, yes. I didn't expect to call so many, but thanks to that, I could prepare another blessing for the next time."

"Thank you for that."

Did Uriel sense that he was about to be killed despite those words?

Instead of begging for his life, Uriel spoke with determination.

[...If you kill me, you'll regret it. Those above me won't let you off.]

"Isn't it the same if I don't kill you?"

[...]
ChatGPT

"If you want to live, just honestly ask to spare your life."

[I'm not even considering sparing it.]

"You know it well."

Thud-!

As Ryumin quickly pierced and withdrew from Uriel's heart, Uriel's body leaned forward.

It was a swift and unnoticeable death, leaving no trace of when he moved.
