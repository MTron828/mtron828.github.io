Title: "Episode 214 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player"

The Request of the Black Scythe

In a rural area of Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province.

A sign with engraved Chinese characters hung in a place that seemed like an ordinary house.

Sashinkyō (死神敎) - Death God Religion.

While someone might label it as a cult, fortunately, the villagers paid no attention to it.

No, most people didn't even know that someone was using a humble house as a religious facility.

Except for the followers of the Death God Religion.

"High Priest."

"Oh, Eom Chugi-gyeong."

"What's on your mind?"

Heo Taeseok, who was sitting at a desk lost in thought, sighed as if he understood.

"It's because of the finances, what else."

It might seem absurd to spend money on operating just one humble house called the Death God Religion, but surprisingly, it did cost money.

"During weekdays, I travel nationwide to recruit new believers, and on weekends, I host gatherings and dinners to ensure the believers don't leave... It's not a small expense."

Calculating the costs of overseas pilgrimages to recruit followers, it turned out that a considerable amount of money was needed.

Especially during social gatherings, where expenses added up significantly; taking several people out for drinks, going to second and third rounds easily cost around 500,000 won.

"Repeating this every week, it's only natural that we need money."

Meanwhile, the head of the religion himself had nothing much to do and spent his time leisurely.

"It's my fault. I was too complacent. I was too eager and didn't face reality."

"...Is the situation that difficult?"

Heo Taeseok responded with a sigh.

"Selling items has its limits now. I sold everything worth selling for living and operating expenses. Moreover, even the Ploplop Market is in danger of closing recently..."

Heo Taeseok, who used to sell equipment on the Ploplop Market whenever he needed money, found himself unable to do so now.

Of course, he could sell items on platforms like Used Market Cafe, but it was incomparably inconvenient compared to Ploplop.

"Ugh..."

"Hmm..."

Watching the pitiful leader sigh deeply, Eom Junseok had one idea.

"How about collecting donations?"
ChatGPT

"I haven't considered that idea. I also want to collect donations. But what if the devout followers we've managed to hold on to leave because of that?"

"If you honestly explain our situation to the followers, they will willingly come forward to help."

"Do you think so?"

Heo Taeseok viewed it negatively.

It's a human tendency to turn away when their own money is involved, even if it's easy to spend someone else's. No matter how honestly you lay out the situation and plead, there's no guarantee they won't leave.

If one has to spend both time and money on religious activities, who would willingly stay?

"Well, I can't guarantee how the followers will react."

"Sigh..."

At that moment, both of them sighed simultaneously.

Creak-

The sound of the door opening was followed by someone being caught by the presence detection.

"Who is it? The regular gathering is tomorrow..."

Since there was no one expected, Heo Taeseok went outside, curious if a passing resident had entered.

He was about to be surprised when he opened the door.

"Gasp, G-G-G-G... Black Scythe!?"

The treasure and spiritual leader of the Death God Religion had arrived.

"It's impressive that you recognize me as the Black Scythe at a glance. This is the first time we've met in reality according to my memory, right?"

"Still, I know! How could I not recognize you with that outfit?"

Although Ryu Min covered her face, deliberately revealing the attire she wore in the otherworld as the Black Scythe, it was unmistakable for Heo Taeseok, who had partied with the Black Scythe several times.

He didn't know the intent behind her appearance, but...

"To meet the Black Scythe in reality! I'm really glad! But why are you here in this humble place..."

"Is this altar made for me considered humble?"

"Oh, I apologize. I didn't mean it in any other sense, but as you can see, it's humble..."

"It seems the financial situation isn't great."

"...That's correct."

"How many followers does the Death God Religion have now?"

"Originally, excluding me and Eom Junseok, there were about 30, but now it's reduced to 10..."

"A lot must have died in Round 12."

"Yes."

Currently, there are 175 players remaining in South Korea. Just until Round 11, there were 690 players, but unexpectedly, many couldn't pass Round 12 and died.

"Are all those 10 people players?"
ChatGPT

"Yes."

As Heo Taeseok answered, he observed the Black Scythe's expression.

'Could it be that she came to inspect?'

Just like a military officer carrying out an inspection of the troops, had she come to inquire about how things were going?

That was the only thought that could come to mind.

She was looking around as if inspecting every nook and cranny.

'No, that can't be it. She probably just came to see since there's talk of the Death God Religion being established.'

However, all of Heo Taeseok's expectations went off course.

"I found you because I have one favor to ask."

"Yes? A f-favor?"

Even if it was an order, to ask for a favor seemed inadequate?

Heo Taeseok clapped his hands as if in amazement.

"There's no need to ask for a favor. Even if I don't know what it is, just tell me anything, and I'll do it."

"It can't be that simple. You've established this altar for me. Well, calling it an altar might be an exaggeration considering how humble it is."

"W-Well, yes."

"So, I want you to relocate elsewhere."

"What?"

Relocate.

Does it mean abandoning this place and moving elsewhere?

"But, as I mentioned, the conditions for that are not favorable..."

"I'll take care of the building. It would be better to build a new one, but there's no time for that, so it's better to purchase the church building that's available. I'm thinking of a location in Seoul. What does the High Priest think?"

"..."

Heo Taeseok was momentarily dumbfounded.

Giving away a church building in Seoul?

"I-Is there any chance that I misheard just now? You're saying you'll provide a building..."

"I'm not giving it away. I'll purchase it in my name. Anyway, Seoul should be fine, right?"

"Seoul would be good, but it might be expensive..."

"It'll probably be around 20 billion won, give or take."

Heo Taeseok's mouth fell open again.

Talking about 20 billion won as casually as small change in a wallet.

"How about it?"

"Yes? W-What, what..."

"If I find a building for you in Seoul, do you have any thoughts about relocating?"

"Uh, well..."

With various concerns, Heo Taeseok couldn't give a straight answer right away.

Of course, Ryu Min, who could read his thoughts, knew exactly what he was worried about.

"Don't worry. I'll provide all the funds needed for operations. Since we're talking about it, let me give you 100 million won as a year's worth of operating expenses right now."
ChatGPT

"Yes? 100 million won?"

"Stop being surprised and give me your account information."

As Ryu Min took out her phone, ready to proceed with the transfer, Heo Taeseok could only be taken aback.

The sudden stroke of luck seemed almost unreal.

"Give me your account details."

"Oh, yes. Nonhyup Bank, account number 291..."

Upon hearing the account number, Ryu Min instantly transferred 100 million won.

Of course, it was in the name of Lost Yak, so there was no risk of revealing her real identity.

Heo Taeseok, who confirmed the deposit of 100 million won, looked at Ryu Min with astonished eyes.

"I-Is it okay for you to give such a large sum willingly..."

"It's fine. Don't feel burdened; use it for the operation of the altar. It's a small amount for me."

With an annual interest of 100 billion being copied, 100 million won was practically pocket change.

"Th-Thank you. Thank you!"

"There's no need to thank me. I plan to be involved in managing the Death God Religion from now on."

"Involved?"

"I'll email you. Organize and send me the monthly expenditure details. I need to check if you're spending money unnecessarily. Can you handle that?"

"Oh, yes! We've got 100 million won, so we can certainly do that!"

In reality, it was money that could be spent freely, but to avoid thinking of it as free money, they decided to keep track of their expenses.

People tend to consider continued favors as rights.

"If it's not enough, let me know."

"Oh, no! 100 million is more than enough! Plus, you're even providing a building... Huk."

Heo Taeseok wiped away a tear that suddenly welled up.

It seemed like he had been through a lot.

"I apologize for showing such a miserable appearance as the leader. Our financial situation has been really, really bad lately. Now, it feels like a breath of fresh air."

"It's not just giving a favor. As I mentioned before, I have something to ask you."

"Anything, anything you say."

Even though he hadn't requested a duel, Heo Taeseok bowed like a servant.

The power of money is truly formidable.

"If you need more, just tell me."

"Oh, no! 100 million is more than enough! Plus, you're even providing a building... Huk."

Heo Taeseok wiped away a tear that suddenly welled up.

"This time, at level 60, your skill should have been enhanced. It probably transformed into a stronger demon. Right?"

"That's correct."

"After planting the seed in the designated location, I want you to use the skill to summon the demon when I give the signal. Can you do that?"

Heo Taeseok nodded without any hesitation.

It wasn't a difficult request. It was a simple task of using the skill in the designated location.

"But how do you know about my skill? I don't think I've used it in front of you, Black Scythe..."

"I saw another warlock using it."

Of course, it was a lie. Ryu Min learned about the skill because of the illusion she saw in the 7th round.

"At that time, Heo Taeseok threatened to plant a seed in Min Juri's body and detonate it."

Since it was an illusion created by the system, there were no lingering ill feelings. Heo Taeseok, who voluntarily created the religion, had no reason to betray himself.

"So, all I have to do is that?"

"Yes. That's the only thing I ask. If you do as I say, I'll provide a building in Seoul, support operating expenses, and even help gather followers."

"Even followers?"

"Isn't 10 a bit too few? You should have at least 100."

The number was unimaginable, and Heo Taeseok's mouth gaped open.

"I-Is that really possible?"

"It's possible. With the power of money. Strictly speaking, it's the power of points rather than money."

"Points? What's that?"

"Do you know about the cafe called 'Players Change the World'?"

Instead of answering, Black Scythe posed a counter-question, but Heo Taeseok quickly responded.

"Pleseba? Of course. I'm even a member."

"Post a promotional message there to attract people. Say that you've established a new religious group in Seoul."

"I've already tried that. But it didn't attract as many people as I thought."

"Of course, just asking them to come won't work."

"Then, what should I do?"

"Offer points. Say that each person who joins will receive 10,000 points."

"Yes?"

Points are more valuable than gold. Giving away such points as a joining gift would surely attract people, especially in the current desperate situation.
ChatGPT

"Everyone should know that I have 20 million points, as seen from the Round 11 results page. If Black Scythe personally offers to trade and distribute them, there's no reason for them not to come."

"If, if you really offer points, they will probably flock like crazy."

"Then, the problem of recruiting followers is also solved."

Even if she loses 1 million points for every 100 followers that come, Ryu Min doesn't mind at all. After all, she has plenty of points to spare.

"The more followers, the better. It's good to gather people who follow me; it makes them easier to control."

Moreover, she didn't gather followers for no reason. To obtain the Hero's Rune as planned, she needed a large number of people around her—more than 100.

"Could it be that even 100 won't gather? Considering that I'm giving away points."

However, Ryu Min didn't know that more people would gather than she thought.
