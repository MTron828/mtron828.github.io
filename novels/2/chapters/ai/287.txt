Title: Episode 287 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Death of Michael

[Successfully defeated the 'Archangel Michael' among the seven!] [Stat Points +9,161,948] [Additional Stat Points +4,580,974] [Gold +91,619,482,000] [As a reward for killing Archangel Michael, 'Refined Aether' has been obtained.] [As a reward for killing Archangel Michael, 'Refined Aether' has been obtained.] [As a reward for killing Archangel Michael, 'Rune of Battle' has been obtained.] [The acquired rune is automatically imprinted on the player's body!] [Confirmed as the player who first killed seven Archangels.] [Acquire the title 'Master of the Sky.'] [As a reward for killing the first seven Archangels, 'Akashic Record Entry Ticket' has been obtained.]

It was just a swing of the sword.

Yet, Michael couldn't block that blow.

He couldn't even see or perceive that speed.

During the few seconds when his head fell but consciousness remained, all he could do was recognize his own death.

'So, this is the top Archangel. I've faced him before, but he's really weak.'

Was it because he didn't expect much?

Even seeing the dead Michael without any counterattack, Ryumin wasn't disappointed.

There was no room for disappointment.

Contrary to expectations, tremendous rewards delighted Ryumin's eyes.

[Rune of Battle]

Effect: During a battle, one can unleash all their abilities and potential at 100%.

Always maintains the best condition during battles.

Additionally, all attack power doubles, and intelligence related to combat rises dramatically.

Upon reading the description, Ryumin's eyes widened.

'Well, there's a rune like this? It always maintains the best condition during battle?'

It means that one can maximize output in any combat situation.

Just doubling the attack power is amazing, not to mention such an option.

Honestly, it's surprising.

'Is it because I captured the self-proclaimed God of Battle, Michael, that I'm receiving such a rune.'

But that's not the only amazing thing.

[Akashic Record Entry Ticket]

Category: Consumable

Grade: Eternal
ChatGPT

Effect: Allows entry to the Akashic Records.

Usage Restriction: Black Scythe (Soulbound)

Description: Upon use, grants permission to enter the Akashic Records, a repository of dimensional information that only those with qualifications can access. It is of Eternal grade, allowing its use even in the state of the soul.

'An Eternal-grade consumable came out?'

Even if it were a God-grade, it would be surprising, but an Eternal grade is exceptional.

Of course, it wouldn't have been received if only one Michael had been killed.

It's a reward for killing all seven Archangels.

Because of this, a title has also been obtained.

[Title - Master of the Sky]

Acquisition Condition: Acquire by defeating all seven Archangels for the first time.

Effect: Attains a position equivalent to that of an Archangel.

'Whether this title is good or bad, I can't tell.'

It only mentions attaining a position equivalent to an Archangel.

Since there is nothing written about the advantages resulting from it, it wasn't a title worth celebrating.

'Refined Aether coming in is good, though.'

It was something expected since killing Gabriel and Raphael.

It was expected that Refined Aether would come in when Michael was killed.

'But who knew two would come in?'

It was an indication of a formidable opponent, but Ryumin didn't feel it much.

In terms of the fact that they would die with one swing, there was no difference between Michael and the 6th-grade angels.

'Did the rewards not come in yet?'

Ryumin examined the message window, searching for the rewards he had been anticipating.

It was none other than the rewards obtained from the Soul Bonding quest.

'Since I killed the last remaining Archangel, the quest should be complete...'

The moment Ryumin found the completion message, he looked at the rewards with wide eyes.

'Wh-what is this...'

Half-opened in astonishment, he abruptly turned his head.

There was nothing in that direction, but someone hiding there couldn't help but flinch.

Precisely because they were looking directly at him.

Ba'al, who had been hiding in a transparent state, broke out in a cold sweat.

'I knew they were strong, but to this extent...'

When the lord mentioned that there was a human who killed a divine form in one breath, he had thought it might be a stroke of luck and laughed it off at first.
ChatGPT

The thought was based on the belief of how strong a human could be when witnessed directly.

However, the actual skill of the Black Scythe was so difficult to believe even when seen with one's own eyes.

'You really slaughtered the angels. I thought you might break the promise and run away.'

He didn't count precisely, but the number he killed now is roughly over 800.

At this rate, it might surpass a thousand.

'A thousand? It's an overwhelming massacre.'

For the demons, the outcome of the 18 rounds is not crucial.

It's just a friendly match, and the real war begins after round 20.

Even so, winning is better than losing.

If they can reduce the number of Celestials even a little, the victory in the Demon-Angel War will become more certain.

Therefore, for the demons, it's beneficial for the Black Scythe to be active in this way.

Moreover, defeating Michael in one blow like that.

'Heh... Killed with a single strike.'

It wasn't that he killed the weakened Michael with 1/100th of his power.

The Michael he just saw had released the constraints and was charging with his own strength.

'A Michael who can't react to an attack at that speed.'

Ba'al swallowed saliva in tension.

If it were him, could he have reacted to that attack?

Perhaps he would have found himself in the same situation.

Michael was a skilled individual comparable to him.

'I have a slight advantage, but still.'

In any case, Ba'al couldn't help but feel tense.

It was because he remembered the mission he had to fulfill.

'Can I really stab that guy in the back?'

Perhaps the lord didn't know that the Black Scythe had such skill.

If he knew, he wouldn't have sent him alone.

'He probably intended to handle it himself even if he had to.'

The skill of the Black Scythe was beyond imagination.

'What should I do? Should I contact the lord now? Tell him that I'm not a match for the opponent?'

It sounds disgraceful.

As the top demon noble, he couldn't afford to show weakness.

'If the Black Scythe is killing the Celestials, I must find an opportunity to kill him. By any means...'

As he was preparing himself for such thoughts, a voice echoed in Ba'al's mind.

[Ba'al. Listen while you sleep. I'm currently observing the Black Scythe through your eyes.]

It was the lord's statement.

Although they couldn't converse, Ba'al felt relieved.
ChatGPT

If you've seen what I saw, you probably have thoughts of revoking the order.

[The opponent is incredibly strong. I didn't expect him to kill Michael in one shot. So, when the opportunity arises, execute it immediately. Don't wait until you've wiped out all the Celestials; you'll miss the chance.]

'What? What are you saying?'

For a moment, Ba'al doubted if he heard a hallucination.

'Are you telling me to kill that monster?'

[The creature that killed Michael in one shot is also a monster. It's difficult to guarantee victory in the Demon-Angel War if it survives until round 20 as a celestial mercenary. So, it must be killed when the opportunity arises. Execute the plan as planned.]

'No, no. How do you expect me to kill that thing? What?'

Although Ba'al shouted, there was no way the words would reach the ears of the god using the divine statement.

As the one-sided conversation ended, Ba'al felt tense.

'Now that it's come to this, I must kill him, even if it costs my life.'

The future of the demons is at stake.

Thinking that way, his heart felt much relieved.

What could be more admirable than sacrificing for justice?

But that too, only for a moment.

Jolt—

When he directly met the eyes of the predator, Ba'al trembled with fear.

'I-It seems like he's looking at me now... Maybe it's just my imagination due to the mood?'

He was clearly more than 30 meters away.

There was no way he could be detected with his senses.

But how exactly is he looking at this direction?

'U-It must be a coincidence. Just a coincidence.'

While holding his breath in tension, the Black Scythe flew towards him.

"You're there, so reveal yourself, Ba'al."

[…….]

"Before I get pissed off."

Whether it was a threat or not, Ba'al released his transparency as if absorbed by it.

[D-Did you find me?]

"Come closer to this side."

When he gestured with his finger like a swindler trying to extort money, Ba'al approached slowly with a wiggly face.

[Wh-What's going on, human.]

"You were planning to kill me after the job was done, right?"

At the piercing words, Ba'al's heart seemed to stop.

[Wh-What, th-that's absurd, un, unbelievable...]

"I'm not here for excuses. Let's have an honest conversation."

Ryumin said with a deadly serious expression, glaring at Ba'al.
ChatGPT

"He ordered the Demon Lord, right? To stab me in the back after the job is done."

[…….]

"Why can't you speak? Is it because the Demon Lord is sharing your vision, making it difficult for you to be honest?"

[H-How could that be...?]

"It seems like we can't have a conversation. In that case, I guess I need to send a message."

Ryumin raised the scythe as if to showcase.

"Demon Lord, pay attention. See what happens if you try to stab me in the back."

[Wait a moment...!]

Though Ba'al urgently raised his hand, it was already too late.

Ryumin's swung scythe cut through him entirely.

Ba'al, who died without resistance like Michael, had one difference.

'There's no reward at all.'

He hoped for some kind of message, but unlike the Celestials, the demons gave nothing.

'But it's not like there's no reason to kill him.'

Currently, there were only about 4,000 demons left, and about 2,000 Celestials.

With these numbers, it was evident that the demons would win the war.

Without thinking much about it, Ryumin had to take action.

He used a temporary skill.

[You have used the Temporary Skill Faction Change Permit.] [The faction of the player 'Black Scythe' will change from 'Demon' to 'Celestial.'] [From now on, the demons will recognize you as an enemy.] [As a result of the faction change, the quest victory conditions have changed.]

'M-Michael is dead?'

Agoros, ranked 2nd, stared at the sky with his mouth open.

The human, stained black, had beheaded Michael in one stroke.

'Hahaha! At this rate, the demons will win this round!'

Laughing with a smirk, Agoros, but that laughter lasted only a moment.

This time, isn't the black figure going to cut Ba'al in half?

'B-Ba'al too?'

He didn't know why Ba'al, who guarded the side of the Demon Lord, came to the battlefield.

He didn't expect him to die so anticlimactically.

'Well, considering Michael fell, there's no guarantee that Ba'al won't.'

Although it was an ally that fell, Agoros chuckled, twisting his lips.

It was hard to suppress the laughter that escaped.

'Kihahaha! Now, now I'm the 1st rank!'

Now that Ba'al is dead, he believed he could protect the side of the Demon Lord!
ChatGPT

Agoros, who had been expressing joy all over his face with such thoughts, suddenly found his mouth shutting like a zipper when he saw the black figure that appeared before him.

"Hey."

Upon seeing the black figure that suddenly appeared, Agoros couldn't help but close his mouth like a zipper.

"Are you the commander?"

[Uh, yes, but...]

Agoros observed the human's appearance with a tense expression.

As if the duration had ended, the black figure disappeared, revealing the face.

"You just saw it, right? Me killing Ba'al."

[Yes, yes.]

Agoros answered as politely as possible.

He wasn't foolish enough to provoke the human who killed Ba'al in one stroke.

"By any chance, if you want to die, tell me now. I'll send you to your friend's side."

[No, no. Why would I want that? And that bastard is not my friend. He's not my superior either, hahaha...]

"Anyway, you don't want to die, right? Can you do me a favor then?"

[Yes, of course. Please, feel free to tell me anything.]

"Gather your subordinates. As many as possible."

[Ah, understood.]

Agoros answered while smiling, trying to be as polite as possible.

But he didn't have time to think.

The fearsome human was glaring at him as if he could kill him.

[All forces! Assemble in front of me!]

Under the command of their legion leader, the demons hurriedly gathered.

The number gathered was only 2,000.

It was cramped to call more.

[I called as many as possible... Should I call more?]

"No, that's enough. You did well."

After answering like that, Ryumin stepped back with the scythe.

Kiiiiing-

A ominous sound echoed, and looking at it, the human's scythe was vibrating.

Flash-

The moment the light passed.

Agoros, who opened his eyes wide, was filled with confusion.

Because the 2,000 troops he had gathered disappeared in an instant.
