Title: Episode 173 of the 100th Reincarnation for the Max Level Player

Bribery

Ding-

Two foreigners entered the cafe and looked around.

It was a cafe with enough people sitting, suitable for conversation.

"Jeffrey, where is the Prophet?"

"Well, I haven't seen him yet, judging by the fact that he's not visible."

"Well, we still have 30 minutes until the appointed time."

Nathan and Jeffrey headed to the cafe the Prophet mentioned as soon as they arrived in Korea.

Nathan, who couldn't drink coffee, didn't mind taking a seat at the cafe.

He was willing to accommodate the Prophet's preferences today when he came to apologize.

"Sit here."

"Yes. Should I order some drinks?"

"I'm good. Go and order your coffee."

"No, thank you. I don't want it if the clergyman doesn't have it."

Nathan chuckled satisfactorily, but only for a moment.

'This straightforward guy got excited and made the situation like this.'

He couldn't raise the corners of his mouth when he thought about the threatening audio file to the Prophet.

"Why did you do that?"

"Huh? What do you mean..."

"I thought of you as an assassin with a cold heart. But unexpectedly, you got angry at the Prophet like a flame. Why did that happen?"

"I told you, didn't I? I wanted to help Kristen..."

"Is that why you used such a foolish method? Moreover, you not only lost your cool in your voice but raged like a beast that lost its reason."

"..."

"Were you admiring my daughter, by any chance?"

Jeffrey's heart pounded, but he tried to maintain composure.

"No, I wasn't."

"Then why did you lose your reason if not for that? Like a fool blinded by love."

"I have no excuse..."

Jeffrey just bowed his head, realizing that there was nothing to say to defend himself.

Ding-

As Jeffrey absentmindedly raised his head at the sound of the door opening, he opened his mouth.

"Oh, he's here."

Nathan turned his head, and a small-built Asian was walking towards them.

'First impressions are not great.'

Short stature, no visible muscles, an ordinary-looking weak Asian to anyone who sees him.
ChatGPT

Nathan evaluated it that way, but somehow it was fine.

What does the impression matter anyway?

He was the Nostradamus of this era, foreseeing the future.

"Hello, Prophet."

When Nathan greeted with a friendly face, Ryumin responded with a nod.

"You must be Nathan Craig, Kristen's father."

"Yes, that's right. Please have a seat."

"Nice to meet you, Prophet."

Ryumin glanced at Jeffrey, who was greeting, and replied curtly, "I'm not particularly pleased."

"I apologize for that time. I truly committed a grave offense against the Prophet."

To ease the Prophet's mood, Jeffrey started with an apology, bowing deeply with sincerity.

'It seems that bowing deeply like this is how you relieve the other person's anger in Korea.'

He had learned this from K-dramas.

Even though it might not work on Ryumin, who could read minds.

"Die, then."

"What?"

"You said you committed a grave offense. Go out and die."

"No, Prophet. Your words are too harsh..."

"Too harsh? That's strange. It's only been a few days, and you've already forgotten? Is threatening to stab and kill you less harsh than that? Don't you remember? If you don't, should I play the recording loudly here?"

"..."

Jeffrey's expression hardened more than expected at the rough response.

He thought that if he bowed his head this much, Ryumin would say something like, "It's okay, haha. It's all in the past," and forgive him. It was unexpected.

Nathan also seemed surprised, contrary to his appearance, by the Prophet's raised voice.

"Well, I apologize... I've been wrong a hundred or a thousand times."

"Why do you keep apologizing? I don't feel any remorse from you."

"..."

What just happened was a provocation and a kind of test.

To easily read Jeffrey's inner thoughts.

As expected,

-This little Prophet is quite annoying. I can't just kill him outright.

There was no sign of remorse from Jeffrey.

Of course, Nathan was pretending to be calm outwardly because he was there.

'Ugh, this is why you shouldn't easily trust a blond beast.'

It wasn't particularly surprising.
ChatGPT

It was expected that there would be lingering resentment.

'I can't leave such an unpredictable variable.'

The decision to eliminate the variable was already made.

There was no intention of offering an apology from the beginning.

Unaware of this, Nathan made an effort to smile and lighten the mood.

"Haha... It seems the Prophet is really angry. Understandable. I was quite upset listening to the recording as well. But at this point, wouldn't it be better for both of us to stop here and forgive each other generously? After all, I scolded harshly, even took an oath never to do it again. You may or may not know, but as a worshipper of the gods, the weight of an oath is different from an ordinary person's..."

The lengthy explanation fell on deaf ears.

Ryumin, knowing that bribery was being prepared, only hoped for a quick resolution.

Fortunately, Nathan seemed to catch the hint, and Nathan exclaimed 'Ah,' pulling something out of his bag.

"It's a 5-carat diamond. It's worth about 300 million won. Please accept it."

"Why is this?"

"As a gesture of apology."

"But Nathan, you didn't do anything wrong, did you?"

"No, it's my fault. Jeffrey has been like my own child since he was young. In a way, he's no different from my own child. Isn't the responsibility of raising a child on the parents? So, it's almost my fault."

Ryumin quietly examined the diamond.

For someone like him, who had more than enough money, it might not be considered a significant bribe, but to others, it could be seen as excessive, even overflowing.

'No reason not to accept it. Since it's useless to me, I should give it to Minjoo.'

If he gave it to Minjoo, she might consider it a gift and it would be more in his favor.

If he could buy the buffer's favor with just 300 million won, it was worth it.

"Alright. Let's accept the apology."

Ryumin smiled as he accepted the diamond.

It might seem materialistic, but it didn't matter.

For Nathan, it wasn't just an apology; it also carried the meaning of taking good care of his daughter.

'It's a trade, a deal.'

Even though he received a bribe, there was still one more thing to receive.

"I'll go to the restroom for a moment."
ChatGPT

When Ryumin left his seat, Jeffrey's expression quickly turned displeased.

"What the hell is that Prophet saying? So hard to pacify him."

"Don't say such things. It's because we have the Prophet that Kristen can survive."

"But he's withholding crucial information. What good is it to survive..."

"Jeffrey."

Nathan glared at him with a stern look.

"Whether you harbor dissatisfaction or not, it doesn't matter. Just be careful with your words in front of the Prophet. Don't ruin the barely restored relationship. Got it?"

"Yes. Don't worry."

Though he said not to worry, Jeffrey still harbored resentment deep inside.

Until Yang Ti appeared.

"Hello."

"What's going on?"

"Sorry to interrupt your conversation, but it's a bit noisy. Could you please keep it down? Please."

She appeared and disappeared quickly, but that was enough.

It wasn't easy to put Jeffrey under Yang Ti's control.

"What's this? Who is that woman? Do you know her?"

Nathan asked, and Jeffrey turned to Yang Ti.

When Yang Ti nodded slightly, Jeffrey turned his head away.

"Well, I don't know her either."

"You should be able to understand what she's saying, right?"

At that moment, Ryumin returned from the restroom.

Jeffrey met eyes with him, but there was no visible animosity as before.

'He's under Yang Ti's influence.'

With that, the variable was removed.

Detailed instructions could be given over the phone.

Ryumin, who looked pleased, said with a smile, "Well, then, as a sign of reconciliation, would you like to have some coffee together? I'll treat."

"Uh, sure."

Only Nathan, who couldn't drink coffee, showed a bitter expression.

After the 10th round, Heaven turned upside down.

It was all because of the disappearance of the seven Archangels of Heaven, particularly Ramiel.

"Tell the truth. Is that true?" "Yes. I witnessed it with my own eyes, as she entered and exited the Akashic Records." "Was that the last appearance of the Archangel you saw?" "Yes."

Upon hearing the testimony of the soldier, the gentle brow of Archangel Michael slightly furrowed.

"Understood. You may go."

With folded wings, Michael fell into deep thought.
ChatGPT

All the information that could be gathered from the soldiers' testimonies had been collected.

"I've heard that a player is summoning and killing angels at the Divine Trust Altar. However..."

Coincidentally, at that moment, Ramiel went missing.

The last sight the soldiers saw was her appearing from the Akashic Records and then disappearing somewhere.

"Could it be that she followed the player down to the Divine Trust Altar?"

If so, why hadn't she returned to Heaven after several days?

Why wasn't she responding to the absolute authority of the seven Archangels?

The only hypothesis that came to mind at the end of these questions was one.

"Is she dead? Ramiel?"

Did she die fighting against the player who claimed to have killed angels?

"It's hard to believe. Seven Archangels killed by a player who was only in the 10th round?"

But there was no other plausible hypothesis.

"In the end, is there no choice but to check the Akashic Records?"

Ramiel's frequent visits to the Akashic Records were already known.

She often mentioned going there to listen to stories from different dimensions when she was bored.

"As soon as she came out of there, she went down to the Divine Trust Altar, as if she had heard in advance that angels were being killed."

The only way to hear news from the outside while the Akashic Records were blocked was to go there.

"I must have heard something from Lubahi."

The sentient being loved to talk, so maybe it told Ramiel stories about the human world.

Flash—

Mikael, who had teleported to the front of the Akashic Records in an instant, opened the door.

Creak— Thud!

As they entered, the door closed, revealing Lubahi standing there as if waiting.

"Archangel above Archangels, Mikael, I welcome you."

"Did you know I was coming?"

"Yes. The Akashic Records, a unique extraterrestrial information repository, told me many things."

"Then you probably know why I came."

"It's because of Ramiel, right?"

"Yes. You already know, but she's missing. I'd like to know what happened."

"Have you heard of the Black Scythe?"
ChatGPT

[What's that?] [You haven't heard. It's the player currently holding the top rank.] [Is that guy the culprit slaughtering soldiers?] [That's correct.] [Impudent brat. How dare he decide to kill angels.] [Not only soldiers. Ramiel fell victim to him as well.] [...….]

Even though he had anticipated it, hearing it directly was somewhat shocking.

[Seven Archangels capable of facing 100 first-class angels, killed by a mere human. Is that even possible?] [Regardless of its possibility, it has already happened.] [...….]

Lubahi wouldn't lie.

'The Black Scythe... An extraordinary human.'

He had only just passed the 10th round, yet he had already grown enough to kill an Archangel.

'An impressive human. But that's only up until today.'

Not a soldier, and now that an Archangel had died, it was an issue that Mikael, the leader, couldn't ignore.

[We should kill him immediately before he grows any further.] [The Black Scythe is still on Earth. In a few days, the 11th round will begin.] [Then we should target him when the 11th round starts. Opening dimensional doors and manifesting forcibly would incur penalties.] [That's a good plan. But I recommend waiting a bit longer, not for the 11th round.] [What's the reason?]

After a brief pause, Lubahi spoke up.

[Because it would be much more beneficial for the realization of Mikael's justice.]
