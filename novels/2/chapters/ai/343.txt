Title: "Episode 343 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player"

343rd Regression, Episode 101 (7)

The God of Chaos, Chaos, has been feeling strange lately.

'Why can't I contact my subordinates?'

Goddess of Night, Nyx, God of Darkness, Erebus, God of Air, Aether, God of Doom, Moros, Goddess of Revenge, Nemesis, and others.

Suddenly, many gods are not responding.

'What is happening?'

If Chaos had a back, he would have felt a chill.

'Gaia might know something.'

Chaos opened a portal to find Gaia's hiding place.

Rippling sounds â€“

Utilizing space freely is Chaos's specialty.

Despite knowing this fact, Gaia seemed uncomfortable and frowned arrogantly.

[What are you doing? What's going on without a word?] [If a husband comes to see his wife, what more needs to be said?] [Just state your business briefly.]

Chaos wanted to kill Gaia, who was blatantly showing displeasure, but he couldn't.

Not because of a moral responsibility not to kill his wife, but because Gaia was an entity he couldn't actually kill.

The authority of creation applied not only to creations but also to oneself.

'Are you still holding a grudge over that incident? You're like a narrow-minded woman.'

Chaos was quietly satisfied that fighting only drained his own strength.

[Why aren't you answering? Why did you come?]

'Should I kill you?'

Chaos, who had been restless, showed patience for the first time in a while.

While other gods could be touched, Gaia was a god he couldn't interfere with.

Gaia couldn't touch Chaos either.

[I have something I'm curious about.]

Chaos candidly shared his questions with his wife.

The response he received was unexpectedly cold.

[How am I supposed to know that your subordinates are gone?] [As the creator and the god of the earth, shouldn't you be able to perceive the movements of all living beings?] [Even I can't see through everything.]

While saying this, Gaia turned her head silently, but Chaos knew.

The boundless power that Gaia possessed.

'To pretend to be humble in front of someone with the power of creation.'

Gaia would have likely become an absolute goddess if it weren't for the fact that she lacked the power of destruction.

'By the way, she seems to be hiding something.'

She didn't show it, but intuition was telling him.

The disappearance of the gods and Gaia's involvement.

"Alright. I'll withdraw now."

Chaos disappeared, no longer pressing for answers.

In the silence-filled space, Gaia's sigh quietly flowed.

"Phew, that was close."

When Chaos suddenly came to inquire, Gaia's heart secretly pounded.

"I thought he would find out eventually, but I didn't expect it to be so soon..."

Although she claimed not to know, she actually did.

What happened to Chaos's subordinates.

"We can't afford for the existence of the Black Scythe to be exposed..."

The humans she designed and cultivated have reached the second divine transformation.

They are slaughtering the deities and gathering power on Terra.

A weapon to resist Chaos is nearing completion.

"No, it's practically complete."

In the midst of this, Chaos noticed that his subordinates had disappeared.

Did he catch a scent of something?

"No, fortunately, he doesn't seem to have caught on. He just came for a visit."

Gaia, secretly relieved, was only momentarily at ease.

As the space opened, the unwelcome face appeared once again.

"What's going on again?"

He asked provocatively, but Chaos showed a different reaction than before.

It was as if he was mocking, like someone who had secured evidence of his wife's infidelity.

"So, what scheme is my wife up to? Is that it?" "Why did you suddenly come? Don't play innocent. Did you think I wouldn't know that you recently tampered with the boss room settings?"

Gaia didn't even feign embarrassment.

She had already thought of excuses in case of such a situation.

"What's the big deal? I can change boss room settings." "Why did you change it? Why set a restriction that the boss room should have more than 5 people to enter?" "Having at least 5 people makes it easier to defeat the boss, right? So, I changed it." "Even so, did you change it without telling me? And during a round in progress?"
ChatGPT

Until now, Gaia had never tampered with the design of an already created program.

It was natural for Chaos to look at her with suspicious eyes.

Gaia still maintained a displeased expression.

"I don't have a reason to report to you, do I? I just remembered and fixed it, why are you acting like this?" "There hasn't been such an occasion before, right?" "Well, there was nothing to fix until now. I fixed it now because I thought of something to fix." "Suspicious." "What are you talking about?" "This reaction itself is suspicious."

Chaos stared at Gaia with the eyes of a detective interrogating a suspect.

"You always dealt with me rationally without emotions. But now, you're strangely excited. Like when you broke up with your son." "Don't bring that up. It makes me feel dirty." "Look at this. You're excited." "Stop forcing it." "I'm not forcing it. It's not an overreaction. Do you think I don't know my wife's personality?"

Chaos's eyes gleamed sharply.

"Are you secretly planning something behind my back?" "Ha, I have nothing more to say. If you're going to talk nonsense, could you leave now?" "Blocking the conversation because you think you'll get caught? Well, fine. I can roughly guess what you're scheming anyway."

Chaos turned around with a sly smile.

"I'll say it clearly, things won't go as you think."

Gaia opened the space, but couldn't bring herself to stop Chaos from leaving.

Even attempting to stop him was an admission that there was some truth to his suspicions.

"What should I do? How can I..."

Chaos starting to show interest in the system of another dimension.

If left unchecked, it was only a matter of time before he discovered the existence of the Black Scythe.

"Sigh... The Black Scythe must endure well."

It was the worst situation, where a sigh escaped her.

Ryumin not only released the family of Kang Hansik but also other human souls in prison.

However, she didn't release them all.

Using the time skill of destruction that discerned evil hearts, she only released the good souls.

Being the one who killed Erebus and essentially became the ruler of Tartaros, it wasn't a difficult task for her.

"I can't believe so many people were suffering."

They were all innocent souls.
ChatGPT

They were pitiful souls imprisoned and tortured in jail simply because they irritated the gods or were humans.

Erebus. How many guardians are there in Tartaros?

...

If you don't speak, shall I erase you?

W-well, there are thirty.

Through a conversation with Erebus, now a soul, Ryumin was able to identify the deities who participated in the torture.

And as soon as she saw them, she killed them all.

With determination not to spare a single one.

Although some tried to escape, they couldn't escape from Ryumin's hands, who could control Tartaros as she pleased.

"I've killed all the deities in Tartaros."

After ending the deity hunt, an immense amount of Terra, 170 million, accumulated.

Having gained thirty temporary skills was an additional benefit.

"Now that it's come to this, let's aim for 200 million."

After releasing the souls of humans, Ryumin locked Tartaros' gate to prevent anyone from entering and returned.

Then, with the help of Citri, she visited the heavenly realm once again.

It was to obtain information about other gods from Lubahi.

"I want to know the whereabouts of Chaos's followers."

[Before that, there is some bad news.]

"What is it?"

[Chaos has noticed your existence.]

For a moment, Ryumin's eyebrows twitched.

Well, it was expected to happen this way.

"I thought I was moving quietly as much as possible. Did he eventually catch on?"

[Considering the situation where even his subordinates couldn't contact him, and other gods are disappearing, it's natural to find it suspicious.]

"But there's no evidence of what I've done, right?"

[There's no concrete evidence, but there might be suspicions. Wouldn't it be considered suspicious when looking at your level alone?]

Ryumin's current level was 635.

Compared to other players who haven't even reached level 99, her growth was unbelievable.

Surpassing the maximum level alone was enough to raise suspicions.

"So, he's keeping an eye on me?"

[Yes. All attention is directed towards you, so Gaia has warned you to be cautious. She also advised you to stop killing deities for a while...]
ChatGPT

"It's okay. We've already prepared a contingency plan for situations like this, haven't we? I intentionally managed our teammates to ensure they don't reach the max level."

Ryumin had been controlling her teammates' experience points, preventing them from reaching the max level. Due to this, even now, approaching Round 20, her teammates hadn't reached the max level. Strictly speaking, they were at level 98, with just one level remaining.

"In my previous life, I reached the max level before Round 20, but now, that wouldn't be a good idea."

The reason for not maxing out her teammates was the invincibility effect. It was a precaution for the worst-case scenario of Chaos appearing, and maxed out teammates could potentially become invincible.

"I've also distributed points to my teammates, so if necessary, they can reach the max level and become invincible."

At the end of Round 19, she had 96 remaining teammates, a increase of 24 from the previous round. Among them were Ma Kyung-rok, An Sang-cheol, and Heo Tae-seok, all still alive.

Now, with these 96 teammates, she had to survive beyond Round 20 and make it to the final round.

"This time, I must save everyone."

With determination, Ryumin looked at Lubahi.

"So, now that Chaos has noticed, are we proceeding with the contingency plan as scheduled?"

[Yes. Do I need to explicitly mention what you should wish for?]

"I know. But what if I kill Chaos before going to the Room of Wishes?"

[That would be difficult. With less than 2 billion Terra, you can't confront Chaos. It's an insufficient amount to trace Chaos's space jumps.]

"How much do I need?"

[At least 100 billion is required.]

Ryumin sighed at the absurd number.

"It sounds like you're telling me to kill all the deities."

[But you wouldn't want to do that, right?]

Ryumin nodded silently.

She didn't want to kill innocent gods just to obtain Terra.

"So, what should I do now?"

[The solution has already been provided.]

"Is it the contingency plan?"

Ryumin had asked Lubahi about it before. What if things went wrong, and Chaos tried to stop her? What if she lacked the power to face Chaos? The plan Lubahi had suggested at that time was the contingency plan.

"What else can we do?"

[There's no other choice.]
ChatGPT

"First, try to resist Chaos. If it seems impossible, then resort to the contingency plan."

[Agreed.]

Upon returning to reality, Ryumin issued the summons for the Death Cult.

To devise a strategy to resist Chaos.

"Is this the place?"

"Is this the Boss Room?"

In front of the much-awaited Round 20 Boss Room.

Except for Ryumin, the 96 comrades couldn't help but feel tense as they stood before the Boss Room.

They had heard in detail about what would come out of the Boss Room.

"In the previous round, I couldn't provide information since even I didn't know. But now."

Now, they knew what was happening.

They had mostly understood Chaos's abilities.

Thanks to that, they were able to make thorough preparations.

"Let's go."

Ryumin stepped forward, and the others followed suit.

[To open the Boss Room, a minimum of five players is required.] [Confirmed, 97 players have approached the Boss Room.] [The entry conditions have been met.] [The Boss Room will be opened.]

Boom!

As the Boss Room opened, a dimly lit interior was revealed.

As everyone entered, the previously private quest became public, and the Red Dragon Carmugus appeared.

It was just as Ryumin had foreseen.

"Kraaaaah, agh!"

The dragon's scream was brief.

The dragon fell lifeless to Ryumin's scythe.

No one rejoiced at the fallen dragon.

Because they already knew it wasn't the end.

There was a separate real boss.

Whaaah-

With a bright light, enormous wings fluttered.

"Meeting again."

Although it was their first encounter this round, it was a familiar opponent. Artaros, with indifferent eyes, looked down at the humans.
