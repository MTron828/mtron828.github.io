Title: Regression of a Level 100 Player - Episode 211

Witness

3 hours ago.

Kristin came to Korea just to hear the next round's prophecy from the prophet.

And also to ask about the Black Scythe.

'But....'

As soon as she arrived at the airport, she met someone she hadn't expected.

"How did you, Jeffrey, end up here...?"

Due to the unpleasant feeling, Kristin's expression changed sharply.

"Did you follow me? Under Father's orders?"

"No. I came here under the Black Scythe's orders."

"Black Scythe?"

Kristin's anger subsided at the mention of Black Scythe.

She didn't expect to hear that name from Jeffrey's mouth.

Was it because of that?

She quickly became suspicious.

"How does the butler know about the Black Scythe? What's the connection?"

"We partied together in the 12th round. When he found out that I knew Kristin, he asked for my phone number."

"What?"

Exchanging unknown numbers with each other?

Jealousy overcame suspicion for a moment, but she soon regained composure.

"Don't lie. As far as I know, the Black Scythe avoids meeting others in real life...."

At that moment, Jeffrey suddenly handed her his phone.

"I just had a video call with the Black Scythe. Check it out."

"What?"

Surprised, she received the phone, and a person wearing a white mask appeared on the screen.

Is it Kristin?

"Is that... the Black Scythe?"

In the screen, Black Scythe stood in familiar attire, just as Kristin had seen in another world.

The scythe looked exactly the same as before.

"Are you really the Black Scythe?"

Yes. Your face looks the same whether in another world or in reality.

'Even though I changed my face and skin a bit....'

She felt disappointed not being able to notice the difference, but it wasn't important now.

This was the conversation with the benefactor of life she had longed for.

"I never thought I would talk to the Black Scythe in reality."

I didn't think so either. I didn't expect you and Zephyr to be acquainted.

"You exchanged numbers after hearing about me? What business do you have with me...?"

Kristin asked with a subtly expectant look, but the response she received was different from her expectations.

"I have something I want to show you. I'll let you know the location, so come there. Zephyr will guide you."

"Oh, okay."

After ending the call, Kristin let out a satisfied smile.

"I'm sorry for doubting, butler. You really contacted the Black Scythe?"

"Yes. It's a strange connection, isn't it?"

"Yeah. How did you party with the Black Scythe?"

"I'll tell you about it gradually as we move. For now, let's go."

Kristin rode in the car Jeffrey had prepared and moved to somewhere.

'What does he want to show me? Is the Black Scythe coming too?'

Curiosity suppressed, the car, which had been running down the road, was now turning into a narrow mountain path.

"We're here."

"Is this the place?"

"Yes. Please get off."

Soon, Kristin climbed the mountain path with Jeffrey.

If she had come with a stranger, she would have been suspicious, but Kristin trusted him.

She had spoken with the Black Scythe and the person leading the way was none other than Jeffrey.

'Butler Jeffrey is not someone who would harm me.'

She was sure of that, having known him since childhood.

He was someone who would protect her more than anyone else.

That's why Kristin followed him without any worries.

"Huh? There are people over there?"

Two people, a man and a woman, were standing behind a tree.

Especially the woman was someone Kristin knew well.

"Seo Arin?"

"Krissy?"

The two people who met each other's eyes simultaneously called out their nicknames.

It was inevitable, as they had formed a party together in the 12th round just a few days ago.

"Hello. I didn't expect to meet Seo Arin here..."

"I didn't either, Krissy. They said another person would come, but I didn't know it was Krissy."

Kristin widened her eyes in surprise at Seo Arin's fluent English pronunciation.

"You're good at English?"

"I learned it during acting classes. There are English lines in the script, and if the pronunciation is awkward, it's a bit embarrassing, you know?"

Kristin already knew that Seo Arin was learning.

They had exchanged not only gaming information but also various stories when they formed a party together.

It was only then that Kristin learned that Seo Arin was an entertainer affiliated with the Makyeongrok Company.

"How is it that your face looks the same in reality?"

"Krissy, too."

"I've had a bit of work done...."

"Oh? Really? I didn't know. You're so beautiful both in reality and in the other world...."

Was it because they were former party members?

Or was it due to the common denominator of being associated with the Black Scythe?

Although they hadn't known each other for long, the atmosphere between them was not bad at all.

Instead, they were busy praising each other like friends who had reunited after a long time.

"And who is the person next to you?"

"Oh, he's someone introduced by the Black Scythe...."

"I'm Joo Sungtak. I partied with the Black Scythe in the 12th round."

Joo Sungtak introduced himself subtly, noticing Kristin's gaze.

Communication was not possible, but with Seo Arin present, there was no problem with conversation.

"Oh, and this is Jeffrey. Let's all say hello...."

Jeffrey and Joo Sungtak only exchanged glances without any conversation.

They didn't need to communicate verbally; they knew each other without exchanging greetings.

They knew each other as slaves of the Black Scythe.

"The reason why the two of you were called here is none other than this. The Black Scythe said there's something to show you."

"What is it that they want to show us?"

Joo Sungtak pointed with his finger beyond the trees.

Below the slope was an old warehouse, and in front of it stood a familiar man.

"That person is...."

None other than Ma Kyungrok.

"Why is Ma Kyungrok over there?"

In response to Kristin's question, Seo Arin answered.

"The Black Scythe said the person they want to show is President Ma. They want to show the real identity of President Ma...."

"The real identity?"

Kristin looked at Ma Kyungrok again.

He was waiting in front of the warehouse for someone.

"What is the Black Scythe trying to show...."

"They said you'll know if you watch. That's why I'm also waiting here."

Since Seo Arin was waiting too, Kristin had no choice but to silently observe.

She didn't know what aspect of Ma Kyungrok the Black Scythe wanted to show.

At that moment, Ma Kyungrok had a conversation with someone and then went inside.

Since they were more than 30 meters away to avoid being detected, Kristin couldn't hear the conversation.

"Oh? Who's coming over there?"
ChatGPT

A minivan arrived on the mountain path, and a person got out of it.

It was Ahn Sangcheol, the right-hand man of Ma Kyungrok, whom Kristin also knew.

With a creak, he opened the back seat and surrounded the two mysterious individuals.

Kristin and Seo Arin, who were watching, were surprised as he took the unconscious or lifeless figures into the warehouse.

"What, what is that? Kidnapping, perhaps?"

"N-no way. It can't be."

Shortly after, Ahn Sangcheol, now armed, emerged and guarded the entrance.

That's when it happened.

Some kind of sound seemed to come from inside the warehouse, followed by a scream.

It was a painful scream, so intense that it could be heard even from several meters away.

"Wh-what's going on with those people in there..."

"Even if we can hear the screams, Ahn Sangcheol outside just stays still like a guard dog."

It seemed like he knew what was happening inside, as he stood there motionless.

Kristin and Seo Arin, unable to peek into the warehouse, had to anxiously wait behind the trees.

"Seo Arin, can't you use that fairy to take a quick look inside?"

"It's useless. I can't communicate with the fairy...."

The screams eventually stopped, and soon after, Ma Kyungrok and one of the abducted men came out of the warehouse.

"Director Ahn."

"Yes, sir."

"Block that guy so he can't escape. I'll personally deal with the killing."

Ahn Sangcheol blocked the man with a shield so he couldn't run away.

Ma Kyungrok chased after him and cut off his knees.

"Aaaargh!"

"Now you can't escape, huh?"

"P-please spare me! Hyung!"

Seo Arin, who found out about the man's identity through his pleading, translated for Kristin with surprised eyes.

"That man... he's President Ma's younger brother."

"Younger brother? Family?"

"It seems there's trouble due to the successor issue."

"Even if that's the case, resorting to family..."

Watching Ma Kyungrok cutting off the remaining leg, Kristin shuddered.

Was he really a man with such cruel intentions?

The Ma Kyungrok she saw now was not the fiancé she had known so far.

He seemed more like a psychopath, enjoying the suffering of others.
ChatGPT

"No, no! Aaaargh!"

While someone was being torn apart, Kristin stepped forward.

"Stop it!"

"Kristin?"

Ma Kyungrok was startled by the sudden appearance of his fiancée.

His surprise increased when Seo Arin joined her.

"And Seo actor, too?"

Although surprised, he did not cease the command given by the Dark Order.

"Kuhuhuhu...."

"Ma Kyungrok! Stop! I don't know the circumstances, but please stop right here!"

Kristin tried to intervene, but it was already too late.

In the end, Ma Kyungsoo died, having all his flesh eaten by the Dark Order.

"What are you doing right now..."

"Director...."

As Kristin and Seo Arin looked at him with unbelieving eyes, Ma Kyungrok abandoned the thought of asking how they got there.

He didn't know why they were there, but for now, it was essential to persuade them.

"I understand what you're thinking, Kristin. But it's a misunderstanding."

"A misunderstanding?"

"As you can see, it's true that I killed someone. However, it wasn't an innocent person."

"The person you just killed said he was your brother."

"That's correct. He's my younger brother. But he's trash who tried to kill me. He even killed his own brother inside there."

There was evidence, so there was nothing to worry about.

However, the look of contempt did not leave Kristin's face.

"Do you realize what you're saying? Kristin. But it's a misunderstanding."

"A misunderstanding?"

"As you can see, it's true that I killed someone. However, it wasn't an innocent person."

"The person you just killed said he was your brother."

"That's correct. He's my younger brother. But he's trash who tried to kill me. He even killed his own brother inside there."

There was evidence, so there was nothing to worry about.

However, the look of contempt did not leave Kristin's face.

"Do you realize what you're saying? How can you kill your own family..."

"That guy tried to kill me first, you know?"

"Did you see him trying to assassinate you?"

"I brought him here to assassinate me. I wanted to ask why he was doing this. Then he tried to stab me with a knife, and as you can see, I accidentally killed him."

"Accident? Not intentional murder?"

"Yes. I had no choice but to kill him."

"No choice? Even though you were smiling like a psychopathic murderer when killing him?"

"That's not true. You must have seen it wrong."

Kristin was astonished by the calm face he put on, despite having witnessed it all.
ChatGPT

"What's certain is that he tried to kill me first over there. Please acknowledge that."

"Even so, that doesn't justify murder."

"I was almost killed myself, you know?"

"There could have been other ways."

"No, there weren't."

"Then can you openly say to the world, 'I killed my brother, and it was justifiable self-defense'?"

Ma Kyungrok's expression momentarily turned cold.

He couldn't say that to the world.

If he did, all his achievements so far, whether as a successor or anything else, would be ruined.

Having killed family members, there was no chance of public sympathy.

"If I make a mistake, all the past murders committed here could be exposed."

Although he had attempted to eliminate evidence, he couldn't predict what would happen in a police investigation.

"The cleanest way now is not leaving any witnesses..."

In Ma Kyungrok's decisive gaze, the thought of murder arose.

"Ugh. I didn't want it to come to this."

Ma Kyungrok's sword pointed towards Kristin.

"If I have to make myself look like a villain, there's no other choice."

An Sangcheol blocked the path behind the two, making Kristin and Seo Arin tense.

Unless they were fools, they couldn't be unaware that Ma Kyungrok might intend to kill them in this place.

"Before I kill you, I have one question. How did you find out about this place? Did you follow me?"

"...."

"Well, you don't have to answer right away. I'll make sure you answer soon."

Ma Kyungrok's sword was directed at Kristin.

"If I have to make myself look like a villain, there's no other choice."

An Sangcheol blocked the path behind the two, making Kristin and Seo Arin tense.

Unless they were fools, they couldn't be unaware that Ma Kyungrok might intend to kill them in this place.

"Before I kill you, I have one question. How did you find out about this place? Did you follow me?"

"...."

"Well, you don't have to answer right away. I'll make sure you answer soon."

Ma Kyungrok's eyes were filled with determination as he sincerely intended to kill them.

As long as there was no personal attachment to Kristin, it was unavoidable.

"Well, I didn't want it to come to this."

After Ma Kyungrok swung his sword, Seo Arin and Kristin were stunned.

Unless he was a fool, he couldn't be unaware that they might be thinking of killing them here.

"Before I kill you, I have one question. How did you find out about this place? Did you follow me?"

"...."

"Well, you don't have to answer right away. I'll make sure you answer soon."

Ma Kyungrok was truly determined to kill them.

Ma Kyungrok was truly determined to kill them.

As long as there was no personal attachment to Kristin, it was unavoidable.

However, Ma Kyungrok didn't know.

Chaeang-!

After unexpectedly deflecting the thrown dagger, he realized.

"There were more accomplices."

Jeffrey and Ju Sungtak were there.
