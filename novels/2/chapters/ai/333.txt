Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 333"

The Beginning of the Final Round

"I thought the 20th round was the last...."

Ryuwon looked at his brother lying on the bed with a worried expression.

Could it be that there was another final round, and once again he would have to lie down and wait, and this time alone?

"Why are you looking at me like that?"

"Because I'm worried...."

"If someone sees you, they might think you're going to die."

"Don't joke like that!"

Ryuwon momentarily imagined how empty it would be without his brother, and how lonely the world would be living alone.

Understanding his younger brother's feelings well, Ryumin smiled gently.

"Don't worry. I know enough about the final round."

"Really?"

"Yeah. I'm preparing in my own way before going in. So, don't make such expressions."

The worried face of his brother, who was on the verge of tears, relaxed a bit.

"You must come back alive. Got it?"

"Haven't you said that before?"

"I'm saying it seriously."

"I got it."

Although Ryu Min showed a relaxed smile with a smirk, in reality, it couldn't be guaranteed.

This round, which he had never experienced before, and with a high probability of chaos occurring.

'Maybe I could fail this time. Even though it's an unavoidable task.'

He vowed to conquer the final round and put an end to this damn game.

With that thought, Ryu Min said his final farewell to his younger brother.

It was time to go.

"I'll be back soon."

"Yeah. Hyung."

Despite telling him not to worry, Ryu Min closed his eyes, leaving behind the face of his worried brother.

The clock on the wall precisely indicated midnight.

There is no game played only for the leisure of the gods.

A fierce war where angels and demons fight for their lives.

In the midst of it, even betting on the outcome.

It's not just a game; it's more like a gambling den.

"Have you arrived, Lord Apollo?" "Oh, Hermes. It's been a while. Everything okay during the meantime?" "Yes. And what about Lady Daphne? Did she come along this time?" "No, this time our opinions differed. She left, thinking the angels are likely to win." "Oh no. That's unfortunate. It doesn't seem like the angels have a chance this time either." "That's true. I tried to convince her to stand on the side of the demons with me, but it was in vain. It seems she's turned her eyes to the dividends." "Haha, well, the odds for the angels were a bit high this time. Who knows? Maybe the angels will win miraculously." "Don't even joke about that. If they lose this time, it'll be a complete disaster." "Did you bet a lot?" "I wagered 500,000 Terra on this match." "What! That's a huge amount!"

'Terra' is the energy used by the gods and a means of betting.

While all gods possess Terra as a natural resource, accumulating it is challenging, and they value it like money.

Without Terra, a god cannot exert their special powers.

Therefore, risking their lives in the heavenly battle, which can be likened to gambling, is not uncommon.

"I bet 300,000 Terra this time." "Oh, that's quite a lot, isn't it?" "I heard Athena wagered 800,000." "What? On the side of the demons?" "No, on the angels' victory...." "Hahaha! That wise person seems to have lost everything this time." "I don't know about that."

Suddenly, a voice interjected, causing the gods to turn their heads.

Upon confirming the identity of the speaker, their displeased expressions turned to disappointment.

"Oh, Moros?" "Greetings, Lord Moros."

Moros, the god of doom.

His standing was unmatched compared to other gods.

Not only did he hold a high position, but his estimated Terra quantity was a staggering 5 million.

"Um, Lord Moros. What did you just say...?" "Are you suggesting that the angels might win this time?"

Despite the gods asking cautiously, Moros remained silent.

He only wore an expression of deep contemplation.

The reason for his concern was evident – the Black Scythe had made it to the final round.

"Damn it. The Black Scythe made it to the final round."

While other gods might be unaware, Moros was familiar with the Black Scythe.

He had contributed to eliminating the Black Scythe by providing information to Pluvinctos of Nopheinoge, but now it was standing boldly, surviving.

"But instead of eliminating, it survived so openly...."

On the screen he was watching, the Black Scythe stood alone in a monochromatic space, waiting.

Upon seeing this, the gods erupted into murmurs.
ChatGPT

"Is that not a human?" "Seems like a human who passed the program conducted by the Celestials up to the 20th round." "Perhaps this human could act as a variable?" "Just a mere mercenary causing a variable? Ridiculous." "That's right. The Celestials have only won once so far, during the 5th round. The demons are more dominant." "Isn't it the first time the Celestials have raised mercenaries up to the final round?" "The victory of the demons is almost certain. No need to worry, everyone!"

"Why worry? This is different from any player we've seen so far because of that Black Scythe."

Moros had witnessed it.

The power of the Black Scythe that swept through both Celestials and demons without discrimination during the simulated war in the 18th round.

Because of that, Moros had voluntarily provided information about Nopheinoge's Nokoino-gei to Pluvinctos.

If they couldn't stop the Black Scythe, he would lose the bet.

He had told Pluvinctos that he was helping just to be noticed by the upper echelons of Artharos.

"Don't you dare lose. I bet my entire fortune of 4 million Terra on this bet!"

Now he couldn't change the target.

Predicting the winner is decided well before the 1st round starts.

"Damn it! Why isn't Pluvinctos responding at such a crucial moment?"

It was problematic that he couldn't contact Pluvinctos to find out what had happened.

"It can't be anything serious, right? Ugh, hopefully not."

Even if something happened to the god-like Pluvinctos, how much of a problem could it be?

Even if something did happen, it wouldn't be his concern.

For him, only the victory of the demons mattered.

"Please, don't lose my precious Terra like blood...."

He fervently wished, but he didn't know.

That the human who survived killing both Celestials and Chaos's assault would be right in front of him.

Midnight on September 1st.

A familiar space unfolded before Ryu Min's eyes.

It was none other than a monochromatic space.

However, standing alone in this vast and indescribable space conveyed an inexplicable emptiness.

"I thought I would get used to being alone, but... it seems not."

While he had focused on surviving alone until now, he behaved differently this time.

He concentrated on saving as many people as possible, and for the first time, he succeeded in bringing 71 companions to the 20th round.

However, the time he spent together with them disappeared like an illusion due to the appearance of Chaos, the absolute being.

The efforts made during that time became in vain.

"No, it's not in vain. I survived."
ChatGPT

Just surpassing the 20th round can be considered progress compared to before.

However, it's meaningless if you can't produce results.

"I must conquer the rounds and claim the wish stone."

For the wish stone, he was willing to endure any risk.

In that moment of determination, a message appeared.

"To all players entering the Final Round, welcome." "Before starting the final game, we will reveal the mission."

The usual angel who guided them was not visible.

Only a translucent window flickered before their eyes.

◀ FINAL ROUND ▶

└Achieve victory in the war against demons
└Final participants: 1

As expected, the quest was the same as in the 18th round.

The difference this time was that while the previous one was a practice game, this one was a real battle involving the gods' energy.

"Did they say the energy they wagered is called Terra?"

To confirm the information he vaguely heard, Ryu Min called the soul that was resting.

Hey, Pluvinctos. What is Terra?

What?

Although he didn't like being called out of the blue to answer a question, Pluvinctos, whose soul was bound, had no choice but to respond in a dignified manner.

Uh, it's energy. The one used by the gods...

Is it different from divine power?

Yes, it's different.

How is it different?

Divine power is the superior aura that surrounds the body of a god, while Terra is the energy that allows a god to use their unique abilities.

In simple terms, divine power is the god's inherent energy, and Terra is a kind of mana used to perform abilities.

So, you also had Terra?

No. I was a half-blood god, so I had nothing to boast about other than divine power.

Nemesis is a god, so she had Terra?

Yes, she probably did. Perhaps she wagered a lot of Terra on the victory of the Celestials?

Without waiting for an acknowledgment, Ryu Min cut off communication.

Then, he immediately attempted to converse with the soul of Nemesis.

Nemesis.

...

If you don't answer, I'll erase you.

Wh-what's going on?

Your tone isn't polite. This won't work. I don't need disobedient souls, so I might have to erase...

S-sorry! I'm not used to this yet, and I unintentionally spoke nonsense...

Nemesis also understood well the agony of the soul's annihilation.
ChatGPT

Having had a conversation before the start of the round, Nemesis was aware of her situation.

I have a question. Do you also possess Terra?

Terra? Of course, I did. No... I used to have it.

How much?

Around 6 million...

And you wagered that on the victory of the Celestials?

Yes... But now it's all meaningless.

Are Terra so important to the gods? Enough to wager on bets?

Yes. A god without Terra is like an empty shell. The energy used to exert individual abilities is Terra. Without Terra, proving one's incapacity is inevitable, as you can't use your abilities.

It's like money for humans, then. Judging by the ability to trade, it seemed like property.

How can one obtain Terra?

There's no specific way. Terra naturally accumulates from birth. Well, you can either take it from other gods or obtain it through bets.

So, I must have it too?

If you're a god, wouldn't you have it like any other celestial?

How do I confirm?

You just naturally know... Don't you?

Ryu Min didn't bother to answer. Whether he knew or not, the message announcing the start appeared.
