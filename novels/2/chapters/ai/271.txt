Title: Episode 271 of the 100th Regression for Max Level Players

Faction Selection

◀ ROUND 17 ▶

└ Lead the Kingdom to Victory in the War as the Commander

[Integrated Zone CA-EA001]

└ Participants: 288

└ Achievers: Undecided

The first thought that crossed the minds of the players when they saw the quest window was this.

'Ah, there's no sub-quest for this round.'

It was evident from the fact that the section that usually always said "Always" now only had the word "Simply" written.

Of course, there were questions.

The part where the achievers were listed as 'Undecided' raised curiosity.

[Curious? Wondering why the achievers are listed as 'Undecided?]

The players remained silent.

It wasn't because they were dazzled by the angel who casually passed off being tongue-tied out of confusion; they genuinely weren't curious.

They already knew the reason from the Black Scythe.

[Fortunately, there is no limit to the number of survivors for this round. In other words, all 288 participants could survive if things go well.]

Everyone could survive?

Except for the 2nd round they voted on so far, there had been no rounds where everyone survived.

This was undoubtedly good news.

However, whether it was due to knowing the contents of the quest or for some other reason, there was no hint of joy on the faces of the players.

[Huh? No one's happy? Are you all quicker on the uptake than I thought? Hehe.]

The fact that everyone could survive also meant that everyone could die.

That was why the angel was laughing.

[Even if all 288 people could die, still be happy. Just the possibility of everyone surviving is something, isn't it? Don't you think so?]

'Yes, you're right, Angel.'

Ryumin quietly agreed with the angel's words.

Opportunities to save everyone were rare.

But it seemed the angel considered that possibility as close to impossible.

Judging by the constant chuckling since a while ago.

[In any case, keep in mind that everyone can survive, and now I'll explain the quest.]

Even though they already knew the quest, people listened attentively.

It was a good opportunity to confirm whether the Black Scythe's prophecy was true or not.

[Currently, the fantasy continent consists of five kingdoms and one empire: Albits, Brahm, Ver, Byso, Decan Kingdoms, and the Holy Empire. They are currently in a state of war, with all the kingdoms united. In simple terms, it's a war between the United Kingdoms and the Holy Empire.]

Whether it's really a war or just part of the setting, it's hard to tell. The situation was confusing, and it was impossible to distinguish whether they were NPCs or real beings from another world.

[Here, you must choose one of the two factions. Will you fight against the combined team of the five kingdoms or against the massive imperial team?]

In short, it's a suggestion to choose the team that seems likely to win.

[I won't tell you which side is dominant. However, I'll make one thing clear – one side is overwhelmingly strong, to the point where the outcome of the war will be evident.]

This was a kind of warning that choosing wrongly could lead to dire consequences.

[The choice of faction is crucial. Your fate, whether you perish or survive, depends on the faction you choose. Remember what I said earlier? In this round, everyone might survive. If you choose your faction wisely and lead the war to victory, everyone will survive regardless of the number of survivors. On the contrary, if you lose the war, you'll be wiped out without mercy.]

Sharing life and death with the chosen faction?

That was why the faction choice was so important.

[Once you decide on a faction, each of you can intervene in the war as a commander. Remember I mentioned earlier that this round is not about strength but about using your brains? That's because you need to lead the war to victory through tactics and strategy, not direct involvement.]

Direct involvement is impossible, and you can only command from behind.

This meant that even the Black Scythe alone couldn't change the course of the war.

In war, strategy and tactics took precedence over individual strength.

[So, if you've chosen the same faction, discuss with each other how to win the war through strategy and tactics.]

Upon closer inspection, this round was no different from a team battle.

However, unlike before, there wouldn't be a chance to use your body.

[That's the end of the explanation. The system will provide detailed instructions. Now, shall we start with the faction selection?]

In an instant, as the angel waved its wings, the surroundings darkened, and people disappeared.

No, more precisely, it would be accurate to say that they were individually transported to a separate dimension.
ChatGPT

At that moment, the angel's voice was heard.

[Surprised because you can't see each other suddenly? Don't worry. It's our consideration for an easier selection.]

'Consideration, my foot. Covering eyes and ears to make it less interesting if players discuss and agree to move to the same faction.'

Imagine all players coming to a consensus and moving to the same faction.

Either everyone survives, or everyone perishes.

There will be only one of these outcomes.

'No matter the outcome, it must be quite boring for the one who planned the survival game.'

He wouldn't wish for many players to survive, but he wouldn't want everyone to die in vain either.

'Looking at the missions so far, it's clear. This survival game was created by a perverted voyeur who enjoys watching humans struggle.'

The reason for preventing players from consulting with each other was here.

[Please touch the faction you want to share life and death with.]

└ 1. United Kingdoms
└ 2. Holy Empire
[If not chosen within the time limit, it will be randomly selected.] [Time remaining until the end of the selection: 00:00:59]

A simple choice between two options.

But the content was far from light.

It was an important decision determining whether it was heaven or hell.

Of course, Ryumin knew.

Which side was overwhelmingly dominant, as the angel mentioned.

'Well, it's the Holy Empire.'

Despite the alliance of the five kingdoms, they could never compare to the Holy Empire.

In terms of the number of troops, equipment quality, resources, and wealth, the Holy Empire was superior in every aspect.

Therefore, choosing to align with the Holy Empire for survival was an obvious choice.

'I knew it. Until we regress, at least.'

Choosing the Holy Empire guaranteed victory, but the problem was that the difficulty level became too easy.

'If the Holy Empire wins, the rewards are too minimal. Almost negligible.'

On the other hand, aligning with the United Kingdoms and winning brought in substantial rewards.

Not only a massive amount of experience points but also concentrated ether that could create a god-tier grade.

High risk, high return, as they say.
ChatGPT

'Only later did I realize. Without the experience points received as a reward for the United Kingdoms' victory, it's impossible to reach max level even by the 20th round.'

Ryumin had reached max level early on through experience runes and other rewards, but it would be impossible for other players without the United Kingdoms' victory reward.

'Considering the skills to be learned at max level, it's quite fatal.'

Therefore, choosing the Holy Empire would actually act as a poison.

It was equivalent to giving up all the massive rewards.

'That's why I choose option 1.'

[Player 'Black Scythe' has joined the faction 'United Kingdoms.'] [Obtained the qualifications of a commander in the United Kingdoms faction.] [Moving directly to the command headquarters.]

For a moment, as a bright light covered the vision, Ryumin found himself in the interior of the command headquarters.

With familiar faces.

"Lord Black Scythe, you've arrived?"

"Seo Arin."

But it wasn't just Seo Arin.

Minjuri, Christine, Jo Yongho, Victor, Huh Taeseok, Russell, and so on.

All the members of the Reaper Sect were present in the command headquarters.

'No, it's too early to conclude that everyone is here.'

Ryumin had chosen the United Kingdoms in advance, not the Holy Empire.

But it was too early to conclude that all members of the Reaper Sect had followed his words.

Could there be a traitor among them?

'Surely not.'

He had already explained the advantages of the United Kingdoms to the believers.

It would be challenging to face the Holy Empire, but if they won, they would receive substantial rewards.

But there might be fools who didn't believe Ryumin's words.

And sure enough.

[Faction selection has ended.] [Faction selection status]

└Holy Empire: 2 people

└United Kingdoms: 286 people

'Figures. Two fools chose the Holy Empire.'

It seemed they judged that if the outcome was determined more by tactics than strength, there was a high possibility of the Holy Empire winning instead of the United Kingdoms.

Ryumin never engaged in fights he couldn't win.

That was why other believers trusted and followed Ryumin.

"Two people in the Holy Empire?"

"Who the heck switched sides?"

"Didn't Black Scythe tell us to choose the United Kingdoms?"

"He must be a lunatic who wants to die."
ChatGPT

As players chattered and looked around, Ryumin also turned his gaze, half-expecting to see familiar faces.

'Luckily, Alex and Dorothy are here.'

Seeing all the main members, it seemed that a considerable number of foolish ones had chosen the Holy Empire.

'Can't help it. We can only fight against two of them.'

In reality, the battle was the job of soldiers from another realm. Players here only needed to command comfortably.

[Players can now operate military forces with the qualifications of a commander.] [You can control everything, including the resources, materials, troop movements, facility usage, battle commands, etc., of the five kingdoms.] [However, command is only possible for players who have entered the command headquarters in the garrison.] [You can leave the garrison, but you cannot participate in combat.] [Movement in some areas is restricted.] [For detailed instructions on command methods, please use the combat status board installed in front of you.] [Lead the war to victory for the United Kingdoms faction. Good luck.]

After reading the message, players examined the combat status board installed in the command headquarters.

Blue dots and red dots were confronting each other.

"Could this be...?"

"The red dots are enemies, and the blue dots are us?"

"Oh..."

Players, without exception, looked stunned, their mouths agape.

There were numerous red dots.

It was an overwhelmingly disadvantageous situation, obvious to anyone.

"Who would have thought that the five kingdoms would be at such a disadvantage?"

"When you said the Holy Empire was overwhelmingly advantageous, you weren't kidding."

"Lord Black Scythe, what should we do now?"

"There are too many enemies, what should we do?"

Players looked at Ryumin with worried eyes, but he just smiled.

Would he have chosen the United Kingdoms if there were no way?

"Don't worry and trust only me."

"But how can we handle such a large number with just strategy..."

"No need for strategy."

"What?"

Strategy? Tactics?

In fact, such things were unnecessary.

'If you have enough money, you can easily bridge the gap between the two factions.'

As a commander, Ryumin could use his gold to add troops or upgrade equipment.

In other words, with enough gold, he could close the considerable gap between the two factions.
ChatGPT

'And I have close to 10 billion gold.'

A smirk formed at the corner of Ryumin's mouth.

With this amount, he could easily crush the Holy Empire and still have gold left over.
