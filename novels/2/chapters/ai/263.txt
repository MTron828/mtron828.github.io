Title: "Episode 263 of the 100th Reincarnation of a Max Level Player"

Ten Top-Rank Angels

[6th Summoning] [576 Players vs 576 High Orcs] [Round will end in 30 minutes.] [Time remaining until the end of the round: 00:29:59]

With the summoning message, the High Orcs with tough, thick skins appeared, exhaling breath, but no one paid attention to them.

No one diverted their gaze to the orcs.

Because ten angels, overwhelming in their appearance, descended from the sky.

"Is this the human realm?"

Baruel, who came to the human realm for the first time, looked down at the humans swarming like ants and sneered.

"To think I have to take annoying steps because of these insect-like beings."

The irritation surged but only for a moment.

Seeing humans confronting High Orcs, the thought of it being interesting crossed his mind.

"Shall we watch for a bit?" "Sure, Baruel. There's no rush, right? Hehe."

The ten top-rank angels leisurely observed the battle from the sky.

As the saying goes, monsters like High Orcs were far behind compared to themselves.

"Fighting desperately against such trivial monsters." "Indeed, humans are utterly weak." "There aren't many in number, yet they drag it out like that." "If it were us, we would kill them in one shot."

They mocked while watching, but it was still entertaining.

Seeing similar entities clash was perfect entertainment.

At that moment, Demia asked Baruel.

"Aren't you going to join? Our original purpose is to support monsters and instigate humans." "Externally, yes. But do we really need to intervene in the battle? In a situation where I alone can easily handle all the humans here?"

Baruel had no intention of helping monsters or instigating battles.

"Let the humans enjoy a bit more."

He wanted to have his own time entirely.

The time to slaughter humans after the battle.

"Do as you please. All the humans are yours." "For the remaining 25 minutes, kill or save as you wish. Hehe."

There was no need to say it; that was indeed the case.
ChatGPT

"To kill them, one by one, painfully tearing their arms and legs apart."

Even 25 minutes were not enough to vent his anger.

Roar, boom!

"Squik!"

"Quieek!"

High Orcs were somewhat challenging opponents for players who hadn't even reached level 70. If they faced them one-on-one, there would undoubtedly be casualties.

However, they were a team.

Excluding the one with the black scythe, 575 players cooperated, watching each other's backs and coordinating their movements.

Thanks to this synergy, the number of High Orcs rapidly decreased.

"Phew. I think we got them all?"

"Anyone injured?"

They looked around each other, searching for casualties, but everyone seemed fine.

Only the bodies of monsters filled the island.

"Fortunately, it seems there are no casualties."

"Then what's left is..."

The gazes of the people turned skyward.

Was it because hundreds of eyes were focusing?

One of the angels descended slowly.

"I've witnessed the fight, humans. Truly like child's play..."

Before Baruel could finish speaking, he covered his body with wings.

Boom! Bang!

"Direct hit!"

"It hit perfectly, right?"

The wizards who cast fireballs exclaimed with excitement.

But the unscathed appearance of Baruel, untouched by even a singe, made their triumphant expressions fade.

Well, strictly speaking, his face was not unscathed.

It was so crumpled that there were almost no wrinkles left.

"These, these trash-like beings... dare to launch a preemptive attack when this noble being speaks..."

"Not the time for this!"

"Shoot quickly!"

Instant magic, ice magic, fire magic, as well as arrows, spears, and thrown daggers – every ranged attack possible was aimed squarely at Baruel.

The reason was simple.

Wait until he lands on the ground.
Don't give him a chance to speak and launch a preemptive attack.
Concentrate attacks on the one in the front.

It was the strategy for defeating the combat angel that the black scythe had mentioned.

Shooosh, sizzle!

Splat!

Zap!

If he were a 6th-rank angel, he would have been knocked down and attacked again, but he was a 1st-rank angel.

Ranked higher than the 7 archangels, he could be considered the elite of the elites among trained angels.
ChatGPT

That's Baruel.

"I've had enough of this game."

Baruel, who had been defending with his wings, disappeared in an instant.

People who lost their target were bewildered, but Baruel quickly reappeared.

"Here."

"Gasp!"

One player turned around in terror.

Swish!

His head fell to the ground.

The 'Feather Sword,' exclusive to the 1st-rank angels, emitted a sharp aura.

Witnessing the shocking scene, Baruel lifted one corner of his mouth.

"Dare you think you could be my match, you inferior human subjects?"

"Die...!"

The player who was about to say "Die" couldn't continue.

His body, encased in armor, was torn apart like paper by the Feather Sword.

Another player, swinging his arms in surprise, had his weapon split in half.

A player who raised an axe to kill, when the Feather Sword passed, lost his head along with both arms.

A player trying to escape in terror was pierced through the back and died instantly.

There was no time for screams.

Within less than 10 seconds, the 15 players who had been near Baruel turned into corpses.

Ambiguous power instills a sense of challenge, but overwhelming power induces fear.

Baruel's power clearly belonged to the latter category.

Approaching him meant being torn to shreds ruthlessly.

"S-stop!"

"Please, stop!"

Could it be that people realized they were like moths rushing into the flame?

As people hesitated and no longer approached, Baruel sent a mocking smile.

"Why? Why not come closer?"

"...."

"It was getting quite interesting. What's the point of abruptly stopping like this? Are you not going to challenge me further? Are you just going to stand there?"

"Please, stop."

One player stepped forward with courage.

"Why are you doing this to us? We are not ordinary people; we are players."

"I know."

"Wasn't it an implicit rule that angels don't interfere with players?"

"Who said that?"

Baruel sneered.

"You're nothing but vermin who deserve to die. Our angels can kill you anytime if we wish."

"If that's the case, why play the survival game..."

"You don't need to know that. What's important is that all of you will die here."
ChatGPT

That statement was as good as a death sentence.

A shadow fell upon the faces of the players.

"W-what have we done wrong..."

"You attacked first without knowing what you did wrong?"

Baruel, as if amused by their foolishness, closed the distance in the blink of an eye.

"Gasp!"

The man who inhaled sharply had his voice become his last words.

Thud—tumble.

"You humans attacked first when you were already angry. Of course, the lid won't stay closed. I wouldn't mind chewing up everything here."

After saying this, Baruel raised the Feather Sword.

Whooosh—

Infusing divine power, the feathers attached to the blade stiffened and transformed into sharp spikes like deadly needles.

"I won't spare a single one of you."

With that statement, feathers imbued with magic scattered in a fan shape.

Thud, thud, thud!

"Argh!"

"Aaargh!"

Players with feathers stuck all over their bodies fell helplessly.

Though riddled with holes, some players miraculously survived, thanks to Kristin's wide-area heal.

"Everyone! Let's fight back!"

"Let's do it! He has no intention of sparing us!"

Rather than dying pointlessly, the players rushed forward with a determination to inflict damage.

"You foolish humans. Haven't you come to your senses yet?"

Baruel, who scoffed, raised the Feather Sword again to use another skill.

However, abandoning that thought, he had to urgently block his face with the blade to deflect two arrows flying toward both eyes.

Ting! Ping!

He narrowly avoided becoming a one-eyed being.

"These vermin-like creatures..."

Though he didn't know who shot the arrows, they precisely targeted his eyes, scratching Baruel's pride.

Ping! Ping!

This time, arrows aimed at his throat were once again deflected, and Baruel turned his head.

There was a player standing there, precisely aiming a bow at him.

"You were there, trash."

Using his wings like a shield, he swiftly blocked attacks from various other assailants and rapidly approached.

"Ha."

Dorothy released the arrow upon seeing the angel appear so swiftly.

Thud!
ChatGPT

The arrows blocked by the wings fell powerlessly to the ground, seemingly intimidated.

"You vermin. Die."

Whoosh!

The Feather Sword pierced through Dorothy's heart.

"D-Dorothy!"

Although Kristin, who was standing nearby, shouted in surprise, Baruel paid her no attention.

He simply leaped into the sky, evading the concentrated attacks directed at him, preparing for another skill.

Shooosh-shoosh-shoosh-shoosh!

Thud-thud-thud-thud-thud!

"Cough!"

"Gargh!"

As time passed, the number of dying people increased.

It was despairing, but it didn't mean there was no hope.

Swoosh—!

Feathers scattered from Baruel's seemingly sturdy wings.

'What's this?'

Baruel, feeling a sense of crisis for the first time, quickly distanced himself and looked at his opponent.

"Huh?"

The opponent he saw belatedly had the appearance of another angel, one that seemed familiar.

"Sariel?" [What?]

As Baruel recognized him, even the fellow angels who had been watching from behind were astonished.

Why was the Death Archangel, the one who reaped souls, here?

"Wait, that's not Sariel."

Strictly speaking, it was different.

The face and skin were revealing the undead nature, with bones exposed, and the body was semi-transparent like a ghost.

"The damn human turned the Archangel into an undead."

Baruel felt not anger but rather a sense of pity.

How weak must he have been to become a puppet for such inferior humans?

"Becoming a plaything for humans, suffering... I shall grant you rest. O Archangel."

Despite Baruel's words, Sariel swung his scythe at him.

He, being nothing more than a summoned entity, followed the orders of John Delga.

"Really pitiful."

While Baruel looked at him with disdain, he wasn't as relaxed as his words suggested.

There was no room to block the scythe.

Ching-ching!

Sariel, ranked 6th among the Archangels, possessed strength equivalent to half of his past self, making him a formidable opponent for a 1st-rank angel.

"What are you just standing there for? Help me, you bastards!"

When he urgently requested help from his comrades, the 1st-rank angels, who had been watching, laughed and approached.

"We've been waiting for that." [Let us help.]
ChatGPT

When the ten angels teamed up, the situation quickly turned in their favor.

Even though Sariel was only half-powered, ten 1st-rank angels couldn't withstand the onslaught.

Swish-swish!

Feather swords cut through Sariel's limbs.

With weakened strength, Sariel disappeared like smoke.

Although he could be summoned again once the cooldown passed, it wasn't feasible at the moment.

"A mere Archangel, not a big deal." "He's just a half-baked ethereal undead." "Anyway, Baruel survived thanks to us. We'll settle the score later." "Enough! You guys can step back. From here on, I'll take care of..."

Baruel couldn't finish his sentence.

Another arrow flew towards him during the conversation.

Ting!

After deflecting it with his sword, he turned his head.

There, an Elven Archer was pulling the bowstring.

"What? That human should be dead. How did he survive?"

The confusion was dispelled by a report from a fellow angel.

"I saw that human in white resurrecting him earlier."

Someone had resurrection magic?

That information furrowed Baruel's brow.

"An annoying human. I guess I'll have to kill him first." "Do we need to help?" "Don't kill a single one. All the humans here are mine."

With those words, Baruel swiftly soared away like an arrow.

His target was the healer.

Kristin also realized she was the target and was startled.

"Die, white human."

Just as Baruel was about to swing his feather sword, an unexpected event occurred.

Kwaaang!

A freezing flame struck the back of Baruel's head.

It inflicted enough damage to halt the feather sword.

Baruel turned around with fiery eyes.

Ssyaak!

An ice spear created by Alex was aimed at his face.

Although he blocked it with his wings, Baruel felt a stinging pain.

It was a different kind of damage from the magic he had encountered so far.

"Damn humans!"

Just as he was about to resume his attack, an ice spear from Alex was already flying towards him.

He looked back with blazing eyes.

Ssuaak!

The ice spear targeted his head, causing a sharp pain.

So far, the damage was of a different level compared to the previous magical attacks.

"What are these humans...!"

Muttering in frustration, Baruel instinctively targeted Alex.

After all, it was because of this guy's magic that he missed the healer.
ChatGPT

Baruel, who closed the distance with high-speed movement, pierced Alex's heart without hesitation.

Swish!

"Argh!"

Although it was blocked by a barrier, it was easily pierced through.

"Alex!"

As Minjuri, who was next to him, shouted, Baruel's gaze naturally turned in that direction.

"Annoying insects."

Thunk!

"I'll kill each one of you."

As Baruel pulled out his feather sword, Minjuri's body collapsed to the ground.

It was truly a futile death.

At that moment, a loud noise echoed.

Kwaaang!

Along with a sonic boom, a human appeared.

"What's that?"

Baruel's gaze focused on a human walking on the night sky as if it were solid ground.

The mysterious figure wore a white mask.

"Ah...."

He was observing the tragedy unfolding on the ground.

Then he noticed.

"...Minjuri?"

The gaze of Ryu Min, who had descended to the ground, was fixed on Minjuri alone.

As he approached, seemingly to get a closer look, Baruel sneered.

"An annoying human, even if he appeared out of nowhere, there's no way his luck could be..."

At that moment, Baruel felt the world spinning.

Thunk-

Terrifyingly, Baruel's body fell to the ground as his head rolled off.

"What... Baruel?"

The expressions of the observing battle angels stiffened.

No one saw any weapons move.

The only thing that conveyed the current situation was the golden droplets of blood on the black scythe.
