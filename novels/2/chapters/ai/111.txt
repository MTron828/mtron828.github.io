Title: The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 111

Dwarven Summit

Among the three locations, the Dwarven Summit has the lowest difficulty.

"The monsters that appear are mainly orc groups. If you're a player at the current level above 20, it should be relatively easy to handle."

However, this fact is known only to regressors like Ryu Min.

Players who chose the Dwarven Summit wouldn't know the difficulty.

So, tension crept on their faces.

"Is this another realm?"

"Wow, it's fascinating."

"Fool. It's been another realm all along until now."

"Oh, right. Was it?"

The distant rocky mountains and stone towers rising here and there presented players with a different environment than what they had seen so far.

"Huh? But I can't see your nicknames?"

"Really? I can't see mine either."

"Yeah, can't see it."

The nicknames that should be floating above their heads are missing.

However, some players weren't surprised.

The group of traitors who received a blessing from an angel.

"Isn't it too calm? Won't it be obvious that we're traitors if we act so calmly?"

Ryu Min was calm on the surface, but he made a surprised expression just in case.

Once you're suspected of being a traitor, you're likely to be suspected continuously.

"I should be careful not to arouse suspicion. Of course, if the traitor group exposes my identity, I'll be caught immediately."

Others may not know, but there would be no one in the traitor group who doesn't recognize the face of the famous Black Scythe.

"I have to take care of them before they spread rumors that Black Scythe is a traitor."

It's not about killing them, though.

He wasn't a murderer obsessed with quests, and there was nothing to gain or lose by killing them.

"I just need to stop them from spreading rumors by reading their thoughts in advance."

Since he already knows the faces of the 28 members of the traitor group, there's no need to worry.

It's all about controlling the situation well.

Ryu Min looked around and roughly counted the number of people.

"About 200 people chose the Dwarven Summit."

Of course, this is the number excluding the traitors, so there would be around 230 people in total.

As expected.
ChatGPT

"Hey, look at this."

A message appeared in front of the players.

[Escort Dwarven Summit]

└ Safely escort the Dwarven Summit to the destination.

└ Upon successful escort, all members will receive experience point rewards.

└ The person who significantly contributes to eliminating betrayers will receive a sub-quest reward.

└ If all betrayers are eliminated, additional rewards will be given to everyone.

The current quest is not exclusive to the regular group.

'Betrayers can also receive experience point rewards if they succeed in escorting.'

However, there would be no betrayer willing to cooperate willingly.

If they fail this time, the success rate for the next summit will plummet drastically.

'Not to mention the Human Summit.'

If the betrayer group fails the mission, starting from the Dwarven to the Elven Summit?

They have to prevent the escort in the highest-difficulty Human Summit, enduring two stat reductions of 20%.

'Probably, they would think it's impossible.'

But Ryu Min was confident.

This is not the first time he has tackled this round, and, above all, his current condition is optimal.

'Experiencing two stat reductions won't pose a problem for hunting. It's a debuff that disappears when this round ends.'

While Ryu Min was contemplating the progress window with his head bowed, the players were surprised.

[Current Participant Status]

└ Participants: 230

└ Betrayers: 29

"What's this?"

"We can see the number of betrayers?"

Indeed, the participant status was clearly visible.

"Are there really 29 betrayers among us?"

Players looked around at each other.

Even though their nicknames were not visible, one thing was certain.

'There are betrayers among us. And it's 29 of them.'

With a total of 230 participants, roughly one out of every 10 would be a betrayer.

It was natural for them to exchange suspicious glances.

Well, to Ryu Min, who knows the faces, it was clear where each betrayer was hiding.

"Hey? Mr. Black Scythe?"

At that moment, Ryu Min turned his head at the voice claiming to know him.

The owner of the voice was none other than Min Ju-ri.
ChatGPT

"Wow! I didn't expect to see you here! You chose the Dwarven Summit? Are you following me?"

"Well, your buffs are quite useful."

He seemed so delighted that I couldn't help but respond positively.

However, it seemed that Min Ju-ri interpreted my answer differently.

Suddenly, her face turned red, and she seemed flustered.

Min Ju-ri quickly spoke, "Uh, um. But, Mr. Black Scythe, why can't we see the nicknames of the players?"

"Well, who knows."

Pretending not to know, Ryu Min turned his head and met eyes with one betrayer.

Slyly grinning, the betrayer turned away.

Reading his thoughts, it seemed he wanted to act like he didn't know Ryu Min due to the sense of camaraderie in the same group...

"Crazy. Is he trying to give away the fact that we're in the same group?"

He couldn't blatantly get angry about it.

Ryu Min could only burst into laughter at the absurdity of the situation.

"230 people at the Dwarven Summit. It's fewer than I thought."

"Yeah."

Considering there were 2,166 people, 230 was indeed a small number.

Choosing only 10% meant the remaining 90% gathered at the other two summits.

It was a sign that the Dwarven Summit wasn't as popular.

"Probably, the Human Summit has the most participants. It was like that before."

Was it because of the small number of people?

Someone recognized Black Scythe and cautiously approached.

"Uh, are you Mr. Black Scythe?"

"Huh? Seo Arin?"

Seo Arin, with surprised rabbit eyes, then broke into a joyful smile.

"I didn't know I'd meet Mr. Black Scythe here. Nice to meet you."

Seo Arin's gaze naturally shifted to Min Ju-ri next to her.

The smiling eyes disappeared as if lying.

"But Min Ju-ri is here too?"

"Seo Arin!? Hello. Nice to see you!"

"Yes."

Unlike Min Ju-ri, Seo Arin didn't seem too pleased.

Perhaps because Min Ju-ri, who always stuck around with Black Scythe, had caught her attention.

'I don't even know why I'm acting like this.'

It's natural to feel gratitude toward Black Scythe, who saved me, but it shouldn't go beyond that.

However, for some reason, Min Ju-ri felt a strange sense of jealousy towards Seo Arin.

"But where's the person who always used to be with you?"
ChatGPT

"Ah... Kyung-ho, no. Isn't it An Sang-chul? He went to the Human Summit."

"The Human Summit?"

When Ryu Min asked with a puzzled expression, Seo Arin also seemed unsure of the reason.

"For some reason, he insisted on going there."

"I see."

Though he spoke calmly, Ryu Min was secretly surprised.

'Even though I told him it's the most difficult level, he went to the Human Summit... Surprising.'

Did he want to defeat strong monsters and gain more experience points?

He would have to hear the reason, but for Ryu Min, who underestimated An Sang-chul, it was an unexpected choice.

Just then, a rumbling sound caught their attention as a caravan approached.

Thud-thud-thud-

There were only ten carriages, not many.

With 230 people, it was more than enough to take care of them and have some left.

Players felt relieved at the fewer number of carriages than expected.

Given the situation, they could easily identify the carriages they needed to escort.

Soon, the carriages stopped.

"Oh, oh, you're here! Warriors from another realm."

A dwarf with a typical beard and a jovial demeanor descended from the carriage.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Heimer, the blacksmith of the Dwarven Summit. It seems you are the warriors from another realm who will escort us... Am I right?"

As players nodded, Heimer tapped his knees briefly with his short hand.

"As expected, my expectations were correct! I knew you were the warriors from another realm just from your appearance! Kekhek!"

Laughing heartily, Heimer proudly gestured towards the carriages.

"The cargo here consists of various iron ores and metal materials that need to be transported beyond the Karagago Mountains to the Albiz Kingdom. However, the road ahead is infested with monsters, so we had no choice but to seek help from the temple."

Even though it was a language they had never heard before, players understood the dwarf's words.

How was that possible? The answer could be found in a message.

[Round Feature 'Translation' is activated.] [You can communicate with beings from other realms.]

Kingdom, temple.

Upon hearing Heimer's explanation, players realized the details were quite elaborate.

'What is this? He can't be a real person, right?'
ChatGPT

'Surely. They must be fake creatures created like monsters.'

In the current situation where angels already exist, whether beings from another realm are real or not was not important at this point.

For players, it was just a matter of completing the quest and moving on.

However, Ryu Min knew it wasn't such a simple matter.

'The 8th round, the first encounter with beings from another realm. I need to start building my reputation now to receive favor when meeting other races later.'

Most players might disregard their relationship with beings from another realm, thinking they are just passing by...

'Beings from another realm won't only appear in this round. They will occasionally appear in the future, and the reputation I build now will continue.'

That's why the first step was considered crucial.

If one was marked with dislike, it would be challenging to reverse the reputation.

In terms of that aspect, the betrayer group was not favorable.

Preventing the Dwarves from arriving by killing them?

In that case, the reputation of the betrayer group would plummet to the worst level.

'Then, when I meet the Dwarves later, unnecessary conflicts may arise, and I might lose various advantages.'

Dwarves provide legendary-level equipment or divine-level materials.

Players wouldn't want to miss out on those benefits, and facing the Dwarves with a bad reputation would put them at a disadvantage.

'They don't know that, so the betractors' eyes are at that level now.'

In Ryu Min's view, the betrayers were watching the Dwarves with a malicious intent, ready to attack at any opportunity.

But the betrayers also know.

Killing Dwarves in front of players would be akin to advertising that they are betrayers.

That's why they couldn't act hastily and had to watch from a distance.

Thinking about when to kill the Dwarves.

'If possible, it's better to assassinate them without others knowing.'

There were a total of 20 Dwarves in the Dwarven Summit.

Two of them occupied each seat on one carriage.

If they all were to be killed, it would be a victory for the betrayer group.

'However, if even one Dwarf survives, they can reach their destination.'

If that happened, the betrayer group would have to target the next summit.

The Elf Summit, specialized in elemental magic.
ChatGPT

'Rather than targeting Elves who set up protective barriers with spirits and have no combat abilities, it's easier to aim for Dwarves.'

While having such thoughts, a Dwarf shouted loudly.

"Warriors from another realm! We ask for your protection!"

[Time until arrival at the destination: 04:59:59]

As if signaling the start of the quest, the remaining time appeared.

Now, they had to guard the summit to the destination for the next 5 hours.

Against orc hordes.

'Orcs are a piece of cake.'

Players who didn't know this fact were nervous about where and which monsters would appear.

On the other hand, Seo Arin, Min Juri, and Ryu Min had faces full of composure.

Daegdak- Daegdak- Daegdak-

As the carriage moved, players standing on both sides took steps forward.

Players, each holding their weapons, who were guarding against spirits, could encounter orc hordes before long.

"Chwiiiik- Chwiiiik-!"

"What's this? Orcs?"

"These guys were the ones we saw in Round 5. Nice to meet them again?"

The tension on the players' faces disappeared.

In Round 5, orcs posed a significant threat, but not anymore.

Most players had gained the ability to easily deal with orcs after reaching the late 20s.

To prove this,

Seogeok- Seogeok-!

"Chwieeeek! Chwieeek!"

The orcs screamed and fell.

Their tough muscles were easily cut by the level 30 swords.

"But there are quite a lot of orcs."

"What the hell, why do they keep coming endlessly?"

Players were already fed up as orcs continued to appear relentlessly from all directions.

After about 5 minutes of combat, the situation concluded.

Numerous bodies piled up like mountains.

Ryu Min knew exactly how many there were.

'Probably around 4,600.'

The number of orcs is proportional to the number of players.

For each wave, 20 times the number of players appeared in sequence.

'In other words, each player has to face around 20 orcs.'

Such monster attacks continued 30 times.

In other words, monsters appeared every 10 minutes.

Despite the considerable number, shadows were cast on the players' faces.

"This experience points..."

"It's just a drop in the bucket, isn't it?"

The experience points were disappointingly lower than expected.
ChatGPT

It wasn't that the orcs' experience points were insufficient, but rather they were distributed fairly among the 230 people.

Because it was a party.

'Strictly speaking, excluding 29 of them, though.'

The betrayer group wasn't a party but individuals.

Therefore, the experience points and items gained from defeating monsters belonged entirely to each individual.

Ryu Min thought to himself.

[You have defeated an orc!] [3x experience point buff is applied.] [Experience points increase by 1.5 times due to title effect.] [Experience points +0.18%] [Gold +40] [Current kill count: 463/100] [Stats increase by 100% due to the Rune of Slaughter effect.]

Seeing the message that appeared on one side of the field of vision, Ryu Min smiled broadly.

'I've already killed 463.'

After single-handedly slaughtering 10% of the 4,600 with overwhelming prowess, he had already leveled up.
