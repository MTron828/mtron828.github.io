Title: "Episode 240 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player"

Aggregation of Results from Round 14

[Title – The One Who Confronts Evil]

Acquisition Condition: Obtain by defeating a high-supply demon for the first time (applies to Archfiends).

Effect: Doubles all stats when facing demon-type enemies.

"Ho, did such a thing exist?"

The title received for the first time was quite satisfying.

What used to increase stats only against the sacred angel type now applies to demons as well.

"I never got this even after killing ordinary demons, but it appears when I kill a high-supply one."

If he hadn't killed an Archfiend, he would have never known.

"Well, whether I knew it or not doesn't really matter. I don't often fight against demons anyway."

Whether it exists or not doesn't make much difference, but still, having it is better than not having it, isn't it?

"Hey, the Black Scythe killed a demon."

"Maybe trying to attack with a whip caused that."

"But what were those two talking about? Well, did you hear anything?"

"They were talking to each other?"

Due to the demon's quiet remark, the players couldn't hear the conversation.

Ryumin killed the Archangel without them knowing.

"He said they had a conversation?"

Although he might not know, Fluonictos must have felt betrayed by the trusted Black Scythe.

It was an unavoidable choice to save other players.

"What I saved wasn't just the player."

Ryumin's gaze turned to the angel floating in the sky.

If he hadn't intervened, the angel would have truly had its wings torn and fallen.

As the angel entered the 30m range, its thoughts were transmitted.

"I, I'm alive. I almost died at the hands of Fluonictos. All thanks to the Black Scythe...."

The angel, who had come down to express gratitude, had to avoid eye contact and ascend to the sky again.

Because Ryumin was staring at her with a terrifying gaze.

It was a natural reaction.

The one who sent a trivial mukbang to heaven was that woman.

"That damn angel. I now understand why she left before the start of the round."

(Note: "Mukbang" is a Korean term referring to live online broadcasts where hosts eat large amounts of food for the audience.)

Title: "Could Have Spread Wings and Soared Up, but Chose Not To"

He could have spread his wings and flown up, holding the head high, but he refrained from doing so, considering the surrounding gazes.

After all, he couldn't ruin the heroic image he had built up.

Moreover, there was a need for guidance to aggregate the results.

"Lucky me."

Without knowing that his life had been saved once again, the angel coughed and shouted.

[Ahem, there was a little disturbance, but it ended well.]

"Angel! What was that just now? It looked like a demon."

"Was it a new sub-quest?"

[It's not a quest. Just an unexpected outsider intruding. Don't worry about it... So, shall we see the results of the round?]

The angel, wearing an awkward expression, opened the message window.

★ Round 14 Results ★

[Unified Area CA-EA001]

└ 1st. Black Scythe (Lv92 Reaper) Contribution Points: 392,291

└ 2nd. Democracy (Lv62 Buffer) Contribution Points: 149,201

└ 3rd. Chrisi (Lv62 Priest) Contribution Points: 135,329

As expected, the Black Scythe was in the first place.

It seems he received a significant score for catching the last parasitic creature.

Apart from that, Democracy, who cast buffs on numerous people, and Christine, who performed area healing, had high contribution points.

"Surprisingly, many people survived. But rules are rules. Unfortunately, only up to rank 2,304 will be allowed to live, and everyone below that will be annihilated."

Now, going through the familiar and almost natural time of annihilation, only about two thousand players survived.

"Fortunately. All members of the Reaper Sect have survived."

As Ryumin, who checked each individual with his eyes, was satisfied, the rewards for the round arrived.

[Converting contribution points obtained as a clear reward to experience points and gold.] [Experience +370.3%] [Gold +1,961,455] [Level Up!] [Level Up!] [Level Up!]

"Oh no. I've gained three levels?"

At level 95, Ryumin let out a bitter laugh.

He didn't want to become max level just yet.
ChatGPT

[Congratulations! You have achieved the quest as the 1st in the designated area!] [Currently, 'Black Scythe' is ranked 1st in this area.] [As a reward for ranking 1st in this area, you will receive a 'Bundle of Potions Selection Box!'] [As a reward for ranking 1st in this area, you will receive a 'Special Reward Selection Box!']

Ryumin, having received the items, first used the Bundle of Potions Selection Box.

[Please touch the potion you desire.]

└ 1. Top-grade Healing Potion x5

└ 2. Top-grade Defense Potion x5

└ 3. Top-grade Speed Potion x5

└ 4. Top-grade Invisibility Potion x5

"Seems like these potions are given with Round 15 in mind."

Looking at the potions, there is a common theme - they all focus on defense.

There are no offensive potions.

Well, there wasn't anything to attack in Round 15.

In other words, Ryumin's strong damage output would be useless in Round 15.

"No super-regeneration in the list. In that case, I don't really need any specific potions..."

As Ryumin pondered what to choose, he selected the Top-grade Invisibility Potion.

It seemed like a good choice for her, who would play an important role in Round 15.

Afterward, he used the Special Reward Selection Box, and options appeared.

[You can choose one of the following special rewards.] [Please touch the reward you desire.]

└ 1. 50% Increased Stats Buff (Limited to Round 15)

└ 2. Temporary Skill – Heal (Limited to Round 15)

└ 3. Information on Round 15

There was an eye-catching option.

"Heal... This is like blatantly advertising a high level of difficulty."

In the previous selection, only defensive potions were available, and now they were offering Heal as a temporary skill.

It indicated that the upcoming Round 15 would be that much dangerous.

"Well, then I have to choose. Number 2, I'll go for the temporary skill Heal."

Although there was an emergency healing skill, he opted for a more powerful heal.

There was no real need for an increase in stats.

"Well, there might be a need if the Archangel appears, but..."

If it doesn't appear, this choice would be useless.

"Rather than risking an adventure, it's safer to go with a reliable heal."

The reason for needing stronger recovery than now is that there are people to protect.

If she, who will play a crucial role in Round 15, collapses, it would be troublesome.

◀ ROUND 14 Ends ▶

[Unified Area CA-EA001]

└ Survivors: 2,304
ChatGPT

[After a while, your soul will be transferred to your original dimension.] [Round 15 will begin on March 1, 2023, at midnight. Congratulations on surviving.]

In an abandoned warehouse in Florida, USA.

Normally deserted, people gather in the warehouse on the day the round ends.

All of them were players of the Despair Sect.

However.

"Is this all we have...?"

Today, not as many people gathered as usual.

"Count the heads!"

"Yes, Lord Berber."

Following Berber's command, a follower counted the numbers one by one.

"Excluding Lord Berber, there are 20 in total."

"Motherf...!"

Berber bit his lips with frustration.

When did the 200 followers decrease to this extent?

"Even in the 11th round when we attacked the saint, there were quite a few. But now..."

Irritated, but dead followers wouldn't come back just because of that.

Berber, now composed, gathered the high-ranking followers for an emergency meeting.

"We need to replenish our followers immediately. How many players are left in the United States?"

"I saw an article estimating 200 players in the last round. But considering that it's now half after this round, probably around 100 remain."

"Fortunately. At least there are 100. We need to recruit all of them into the Despair Sect."

"That won't be easy."

Berber's eyebrows twitched at the negative remark.

"Why?"

"Haven't you heard? The majority of players in the United States have joined the Reaper Sect."

"Reaper Sect? What's that?"

"A religious group that worships the Black Scythe. I saw them actively promoting in Texas, USA recently, and quite a few people gathered."

"Reaper Sect, damn it, sounds like a damn cult."

He never thought there would be a rival religion.

Of course, the Black Scythe probably doesn't know about the existence of the Despair Sect.

"Those guys are invading our territory and taking away potential followers, right?"

"That's right. I also heard that the Saint is leading them. It's natural to have the Black Scythe behind them."

"Ha. The saint we couldn't kill back then is now hindering us like this."

In the 11th round, they attacked the followers of the saint under Jon Delgado's command.
ChatGPT

I remember vividly the time when I earned quite a substantial amount of points by beheading all followers except the saint.

"Back then, when the Black Scythe appeared, didn't you, Lord Berber, retreat with your arms and legs severed? It was an unavoidable situation."

"What about now? Shouldn't we kill the saint and destroy the Reaper Sect even now?"

"But with the Black Scythe holding ground, is that even possible?"

The reactions of the officers were negative.

The Black Scythe was not an opponent to be taken lightly from the beginning. The problem wouldn't be solved just because they had numbers.

Would hitting a rock with 20 eggs leave a scratch?

"Don't worry. Lord Berber is a member of the international organization called the Messiah."

"The Messiah?"

"International organization?"

The officers widened their eyes in surprise at the news they heard for the first time.

"How do you know that, Lord Berber?"

"As a high priest, is there anything I don't know?"

In fact, Berber knew about it because Spaniard had come to him to inquire about the whereabouts of Jon Delgado.

He already knew that the organization called the Messiah had been destroyed by the Black Scythe.

"So, there's no need to worry at all."

That was the moment.

Clang! - The warehouse door opened, and Jon Delgado, the leader, entered.

"Have you all been waiting?"

The followers greeted him respectfully, but Berber remained silent.

There was a sore point.

"What were you doing here?"

"We were having a meeting."

"What kind of meeting?"

"We were discussing how to replenish the followers."

"Who gave you the authority to hold such a meeting?"

"It was Lord Berber..."

John's sharp gaze was fixed on Berber.

"What are you doing, Berber? Planning a meeting without me?"

"I would never. I was going to inform you when you arrived, Lord."

"Wasn't it an attempt to make decisions without me?"

"What are you talking about? Of course, you are the ultimate decision-maker, Lord. I just held the meeting to discuss the recruitment of new followers, a trivial matter."

John couldn't press Berber further, as his answer seemed natural.

"That's why, what conclusion did you reach?"

"Do you know about the Reaper Sect?"

At the sudden question, John nodded with a calm expression.
ChatGPT

"I've heard about it."

"Those damn guys came to our country and completely wiped out all the players. So, even if we want to recruit Reaper Sect followers now, it's impossible."

"So, what can we do?"

"Remember the saint that John Delgado missed last time? It seems she's entangled with the Black Scythe."

"The saint?"

It sounded like a misunderstanding, but John pretended not to know.

"Let's target the saint once again, just like last time. Then, we can manipulate the Black Scythe. If we're lucky, we can absorb all the followers he has into our religion. What do you think of my plan?"

In short, the plan was to kidnap the saint and use her as leverage against the Black Scythe.

John stroked his chin, lost in thought.

It wasn't a matter of whether to refuse or put it on hold but rather a dilemma of decision because it wasn't his decision to make.

"It requires some time for consideration."

"To gather followers, this seems to be the only option."

"Understood. Consider it positively."

After giving such an answer for now, John left the place.

'I need to inform the owner of this fact as soon as possible.'

Berber and the followers of the Reaper Sect had never thought that their leader might be colluding with the Black Scythe.

The news of Round 14 was a gloomy atmosphere for the archangels.

"Couldn't stop even though the demon invasion was real..."

Among them, Gabriel's face was particularly gloomy.

His initial confidence was nowhere to be found; instead, his face was filled with despair.

Despite being a strategy devised by him, the burden of failure naturally fell on him.

"What happened, Gabriel? It was a plan you accepted, utilizing the Demon Resurrection Scroll."

"I'm sorry. I never thought that the Black Scythe could see through it in advance."

"Didn't I ask you several times? Can this plan really succeed?"

"...I have no excuse. I'm sorry, Archangel Michael."

Gabriel bowed his head, and Michael scowled like a tiger.

Despite his expression, deep down, he considered it fortunate.
ChatGPT

"It's fortunate that the Black Scythe didn't die. Must be good luck. But what should we do now? Should we send the Archangels to make up for the failure?"

Currently, there are only three Archangels left, including himself.

If all three of them go out at once, the Black Scythe won't be able to escape death anymore.

"We need to drag out as much time as possible to let the Black Scythe grow. What excuse should I come up with? Should I just postpone this round and pretend it didn't happen? Or should I tell Gabriel to take responsibility alone?"

At the moment of his contemplation, Michael opened his mouth.

"Huh?" "Oh!"

Even the Archangels were surprised by the appearance of an unexpected entity, splitting the space.
