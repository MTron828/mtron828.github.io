Title: "Episode 296 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player"

Round 19 Begins

Confusion crossed Ryu Min's face.

It was clear that there was a misunderstanding between them just by looking at them.

"Wait a moment!"

Ryu Min hurriedly grabbed Min Ju-ri as she was about to leave the entrance.

Before he could say anything, she spoke first, avoiding eye contact.

"I'm sorry for coming suddenly without saying anything. I didn't know you two were in the middle of something. I'm sorry for interrupting a good time."

"What are you talking about? Interrupting a good time? I think there's a serious misunderstanding here."

"I was foolish. If a pretty celebrity lives next door, I should have been a bit cautious or suspicious, but I foolishly..."

"Pull yourself together and listen to me. It's not what you think between us, okay?"

In response to Ryu Min's explanation, Min Ju-ri looked up.

Then, as if telling her to speak only the truth, she met his gaze and said,

"We're not really dating, right?"

"No."

"Not even just flirting a little?"

"I said no."

"Then why are you in the same house? Why are you in the same room?"

"We were just talking. She came because she had something to ask."

"..."

As if trying to see through his true feelings, Min Ju-ri, who had been staring intently, suddenly lowered her head.

A sense of embarrassment washed over her belatedly.

Because Ryu Min's unwavering gaze made it seem like there was no falsehood in his words.

Moreover, Seo Arin appeared, supporting Ryu Min's claim.

"Mr. Ryu Min is right. We were just talking in the room, and nothing else happened."

The situation where the misunderstanding was clearly resolved.

With this, Min Ju-ri became so embarrassed that she couldn't even lift her head.

"Ah... I must have misunderstood even though they are not involved with each other. I'm really sorry..."

Ryu Min, who was about to say it's okay, was interrupted by Seo Arin's words.

"There's no misunderstanding."

"Huh?"

"I like Mr. Ryu Min."

At Seo Arin's bombshell statement, Min Ju-ri's head snapped up.

"What... did you just say?"

"I said I like Ryu Min."
ChatGPT

Ryu Min was no exception to this.

"What are you doing? Why would you say that?"

While Seo Arin might have known Ryu Min's feelings in advance, Ryu Min didn't expect her to reveal it in this manner.

Surprisingly, Seo Arin, who had just confessed, seemed unexpectedly calm.

"Both of you must be surprised, right? I'm sorry. But if I don't say it now, I feel like I'll regret it for the rest of my life."

"A-are you serious? This isn't a joke, right?"

Min Ju-ri asked with a hopeful heart, wishing it to be a lie.

However, Seo Arin was not the type to lie about such things.

"Do you think I'm crazy enough to joke in this situation? I'm serious. I really started liking Mr. Ryu Min."

"..."

"I'm sorry, Miss Min Ju-ri. I know about it too. Miss Min Ju-ri likes Mr. Ryu Min."

"You knew?"

"Unless you're a fool, you would have noticed to that extent."

"..."

"You were high school classmates, right? Did you have a crush on him since then?"

Min Ju-ri narrowed her eyes.

"I don't want to talk about that."

"You won't give information to a competitor, is that it?"

"Regardless of that, it's unpleasant. Trying to dig up information suddenly, openly talking about liking Min, it's all unpleasant."

Even with Min Ju-ri's cold attitude, Seo Arin didn't easily back down.

"I'm sorry. I didn't intend to make you feel bad. I just felt that if I didn't say it now, I might not get another chance. Min Ju-ri, you've experienced one-sided love too, right? Rather than having your eyes open and being taken away, isn't it better to try and not regret it?"

"..."

Min Ju-ri didn't say anything.

She just silently glared at Seo Arin.

Seo Arin was the same.

She lifted her head confidently as if to say she wouldn't just stand by and watch anymore.

Watching the two unexpectedly dive into a bidding war, Ryu Min sighed.

'Ah, I told them not to do this in the apartment hallway, please.'

July 1st, 30 minutes before midnight.

Ryu Min lay on his bed, preparing for Round 19.

Other players would likely be lying down in their own homes, preparing for the round.

However, unlike before, there would be unease in the air.
ChatGPT

Since there is no information about Round 19,

"But I shouldn't be as uneasy as I am."

Ryu Min, who knows the information, surprisingly has a reason to be uneasy.

It's none other than Seo Arin and Min Ju-ri.

He worried that they might cause trouble even in this otherworldly place.

"Since then, they seem to be avoiding each other... Why are they acting like that? Can't they get along a bit more nicely?"

He understands having a rivalry over a man they both like.

If he's a man that they truly don't want to lose, he thinks it's possible.

But do they not think about the man?

What about his own uneasy feelings due to their friction?

"I can't refuse both of them, and I don't want to push them away for no reason..."

Rejecting them might lead to unnecessary psychological shocks.

And the impact might manifest in the party play.

"In the situation where Round 20 is just around the corner, I can't afford to make mistakes."

At times like this, it's best to maintain neutrality and not choose either side.

He didn't have personal feelings for either of them.

"Fight like you want to kill me, but don't actually do it. Both of them are valuable allies and resources to me."

With such concerns, he spent time worrying, and before he knew it, it was already midnight.

Blinking his eyes once and opening them, a familiar scene unfolded.

A colorless space, no different from before.

"We've already reached Round 19."

"But is this all the participants?"

"It looks surprisingly small."

Players who had arrived early sighed as they looked around.

Under normal circumstances, it would have been bustling, but with only 143 participants, the headcount was visible to the naked eye.

"These are players from around the world..."

Still, it was a remarkable achievement that over a hundred people remained until the end.

In the previous round, there were only three participants, including Ryu Min.

"But even with this many participants, it will likely be reduced by half due to this round."

It was regrettable, but it couldn't be helped.

The power of the system is absolute.

Even Ryu Min, who possessed divine power, was no exception.

"Hello, everyone."

With a flash of light from the sky, an angel appeared.
ChatGPT

[Welcome to Round 19. Unfortunately, with only one round left until the final round, it's regrettable to inform you that not all 143 participants will survive this time. As in the past, only half of you will be able to survive.]

Angels rarely express such regret in their tone. However, it was different this time because of Ryu Min. Perhaps he worried that she might be upset enough to kill him.

Is she still glancing at him, being aware of his presence even now?

[Ahem, without further ado, let me reveal the quest.]

As the angel flapped its wings, a message window appeared in front of the players.

◀ ROUND 19 ▶

└ Survive in the fantasy world for 72 hours

[Integrated Zone CA-EA001]

└ Participants: 143

└ Achievers: 0/72

Players checking the mission for the first time widened their eyes.

"72 hours?"

"We have to survive for a full 3 days?"

"And there's no sub-quest."

In a way, it seemed like a straightforward quest.

[As you can see, the quest is simple. Just endure in the fantasy world for a limited time of 72 hours. However, not everyone can survive. Only 72 out of you can make it. The rest will perish.]

Players nodded in agreement so far. However, as soon as they heard the next statement, their expressions stiffened.

[However, if the number of survivors exceeds 72, everyone will perish. So, be careful not to exceed 72 when the time limit ends. If even one person exceeds the limit, it will result in mission failure and everyone will die.]

"Everyone dies...?"

"S-so if more than 73 survive, we all die together?"

[That's correct.]

"So, in other words... we're told to adjust the number of survivors to be 72 or fewer?"

"Is this a cooperation quest?"

"W-wait a minute, Angel. This doesn't make sense. How do we control the number of survivors?"

To someone's question, the angel responded with a playful smile.

[Well, that's up to you. You'll have to kill each other to control it.]

"..."

In other words, the quest was encouraging them to kill each other.

[You seem to be misunderstanding. You're not in a party. This round is highly individualistic. Each of you has to survive 72 hours on your own.]
ChatGPT

However, it would be troublesome to survive with more than 72 people after 72 hours have passed. The worst-case scenario of everyone's death would unfold in that case.

[The crucial factor is the number of participants when the round ends. Even if you have to kill each other, you must adjust the number to 72 or fewer to avoid the worst outcome.]

In a way, it resembled the Death Round, where you had to kill your comrades to stay alive. Of course, there were some differences in the details.

[You may think it's similar to Round 4, but in this round, there is no resurrection after death. Once you die, it's over.]

"It's over...?"

"Do skills not work?"

[Of course, you can resurrect with skills or potions. However, if you cannot revive even after 10 minutes of death, the system considers it impossible to resurrect, and it will immediately eliminate you from the competition. Unlike before, there is no delay in elimination.]

Usually, players were eliminated collectively during the final settlement time, but this time was different.

[Another point is that you can track each other at will.]

"You can track each other?"

[When the round starts, your nickname, face, and the real-time distance between players appear on the quest progress window. You can easily find and track each other based on this information. The system provides this convenience to facilitate mutual tracking.]

Though they called it tracking, in reality, it was a round that encouraged murder.

'They are practically setting the stage for us to kill each other.'

'With this, I won't be able to sleep from anxiety, will I?'

'Gotta be cautious and stay alert.'

'Sigh, sleeping is out of the question.'

Players who thought this way subtly distanced themselves after exchanging glances. Even though they were comrades in the same death cult, they were still rivals. There was a possibility that someone might suddenly draw a knife to reduce the number of participants.

Observing those who were already on guard against each other, Ryu Min sighed inwardly.

'This is inevitable. I can't remain comrades forever.'

When the system commands, players have to comply. It's the fate of players whose lives are on the line. Ryu Min looked at his acquaintances who had turned from yesterday's allies to today's enemies.
ChatGPT

Though outwardly maintaining composure, inwardly, a sense of confusion and complex thoughts were evident.

'Will it be okay? I hope I don't indulge in unnecessary thoughts.'

Especially concerning Min Ju-ri and Seo Arin.

It was a relief that they weren't fighting to kill each other.

Ryu Min, though inwardly uneasy, didn't have major concerns. As a precaution, he had given orders to the slaves.

He had no intention of just hunting.

[During the 72 hours, whether you flee or hunt is up to you. However, you won't be able to use the village, so you'll have to figure out food and water on your own. In the human world, there's a good saying: "Self-sufficiency." Kick...]

The angel, who was chuckling, quickly fixed his expression upon seeing Ryu Min's intimidating face.

[Uh, by the way, the ranking measurement method is a secret. That's all for the explanation. Now, I'll transport you all to the fantasy world. The starting location is randomly chosen, so you don't need to worry about getting stabbed. Well then, see you all alive in 72 hours. Goodbye!]
