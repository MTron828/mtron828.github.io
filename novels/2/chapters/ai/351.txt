Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 351"

Encounter with Chronos

Min Do-Jun, who had briefly gone upstairs, came down with someone.

A man with long hair and glasses.

Although it may be a manifested form, one cannot tell whether he is Chronos just by appearance.

But I could sense it.

The moment I saw him, an indiscernible energy was surging.

'Is this it? The residual power of Chronos that remains in my soul?'

It is definitely a different aura from divine power or terra.

[I've heard a lot about you, Black Scythe. I am Chronos, the God of Time. As you may know, this appearance is just a human manifestation.]

"...."

[There's a strange power boiling within you right now, isn't there? Don't worry. It's just a reaction when encountering a similar power to the one I've embedded. Rather than standing here and talking like this, how about we all sit down first?]

With a gentle smile, Chronos sat down on the sofa with Min Do-Jun.

As soon as they sat down, Min Do-Jun's wife, as if prepared, brought tea.

[Thank you.]

Chronos accepted and drank without hesitation.

No sign of suspicion towards Min Do-Jun, unlike himself.

But this appearance didn't bring relief.

What was needed was peace of mind.

Hoorup-

Min Do-Jun smiled and spoke as Ryu Min finally drank the chamomile tea.

[See? I told you to drink it.]

"Why is Chronos here?"

[I've been hiding him, helping him find a place to escape from Gaia's gaze. Being here allows him to avoid the records of the Akashic.]

"But according to Rubahi, Gaia already knows about Min Do-Jun through the Akashic records..."

[That's an old story. I've blocked it now, so she can't see this side. Watching from a different dimension is quite uncomfortable, you see.]

"Then Gaia must have some suspicions as well. If the location is not traceable through the Akashic records."

[Oh, you've got quite a sharp mind.]

Chronos, who had been quietly listening, exclaimed in admiration.

[As Black Scythe mentioned. Mother is indeed suspicious that I hid in this dimension. However, since the God of Slaughter would not permit a thorough search of dimensions and there is no clear evidence, she hasn't shown any particular movement yet.]

"So you were trying to locate Chronos's whereabouts using me. To secure evidence."

[That's right. But evidence shouldn't be necessary. Once the exact location is identified, my father can instantly pull me out with his help.]

"With the help of Chaos?"

"Yes. By extracting the power of time using Black Scythe, which has the same nature of power, we can precisely measure my coordinates. Then, with the long-range spatial leap, my father can extract me. That's why Mother would want to join forces with Father, to help locate me."

The two strongest primordial gods are trying to join forces.

Could there be a more desperate situation than this?

"But don't worry. If those two join forces, we just need to do the same."

"You mean join forces with me?"

"Yes. I hope Ryu Min can help. To annihilate Chaos and Gaia."

Ryu Min remained silent at Chronos's proposal.

To hear the words from her son's mouth about killing his parents.

Isn't this verging on insanity?

"Do you really wish for that? They are still your parents."

"Parents? It's disgusting to even call them that. How can you call beings who try to kill their own child parents? They're worse than animals."

Chronos's eyes trembled with a noticeable hatred.

"Even if it's Father, I didn't expect Mother to betray me as well. They only want to use and kill me, so... before becoming the victim, I must kill them first. Even if they are my parents."

"Um...."

It's not that I don't understand Chronos's perspective.

There are not only good parents in the world.

'But still, do I really want to kill them like that? They're still my parents.'

It was an emotion that she, as someone with desperate parents, couldn't comprehend.

"Just live here, why not? Of course, under the assumption that the God of Slaughter allows it."

"How could that be possible? Just hiding me like this is already something to be thankful for. I can't be in debt any longer. And..."

Chronos sighed.

"I'm tired of running around. I also want to live openly now."

"Is there any other way besides annihilating them? Can't you use your power to reverse time?"

"Even if I try, I can't change Father and Mother's minds. Rewinding the tape is the only option. I will become a hunted being once again."

In the end, there was no answer other than annihilation.

"I want that too, but..."

After Chaos, Gaia had been added to the list of those seeking revenge. But that was fine; if it meant annihilating them and reclaiming their original lives.

"But what can I do to help? Though the willingness to help is there, it's not without concerns."

How could one defeat the primordial gods?

Their own power was infinitesimal compared to those two. That was even more apparent now, with the majority of the player's power lost.

"Hmm."

As Ryu Min silently contemplated, Chronos glanced nervously with uncertain eyes.

Then, seeming to judge that he couldn't make the decision himself, he proposed:

"I suppose there must be a price for your active assistance, right? If you help us annihilate them, I will grant Black Scythe's wish."

"My wish?"

"What you want is to live an ordinary life, isn't it? If you assist me, I will turn back time to the era before angels appeared. It will be like the 102nd regression."

"Is that meaningful? Angels will reappear when the time comes again, won't they? Moreover, won't Chaos and Gaia come back to life after being annihilated?"

"No, they won't come back. They will become non-existent. Think of it as cutting and connecting the timelines of this world and that world."

"Timeline?"

"Hehe, first, I should explain the concept of timelines to you."

Chronos, who had been smiling with a superior smile, spoke like a teacher instructing a student, brushing aside his hair.

"The timeline you're currently walking is not just one. Have you heard of the concept of parallel universes?"

"I understand that much. It's the theory that there are infinitely many Earths progressing with different histories from modern Earth."
ChatGPT

[In that case, the story will be faster. Black Scythe is just part of one of the countless timelines created by parallel universes.]

"...."

[I'll explain it in an easy-to-understand way. Usually, when you regress, you think you're going back to the past, right?]

Ryu Min nodded.

[Half right, half wrong. It's correct that when Black Scythe regresses, he goes back to a past he knows, but it's not the real past. It's a copied past, so to speak.]

"Copied past?"

[In the first round, Black Scythe regressed after being killed by a goblin. However, he didn't go back to the actual past. He returned to a copied timeline that is exactly the same as the past.]

"...."

[In essence, the world where Black Scythe died in the first round exists somewhere. It's a world where Black Scythe died.]

"So, the first round where I died exists as a parallel world?"

[That's right. The second round, the third round, the 100th round, they all exist as different timelines. All existing without the existence of someone named Black Scythe.]

"So, the current me..."

[101st round. Black Scythe is merely existing in the timeline of the 101st round. It's not a regression to the past.]

Perhaps because she understood the concept of parallel universes, the idea of a copied past seemed vaguely understandable.

[You can't perfectly rewind time that has passed. No matter who I am, manipulating time is impossible. That's an immutable law. I just create countless timelines, like branches on a tree. The concept of the wish's path from the Final Round is similar.]

"....The wish's path?"

[Think about it. If it grants the wishes of everyone who passes, how tangled and complicated would the world become?]

Ryu Min hadn't thought about it, not even once.

It's not just one person; there are 97 people making wishes. How can they apply all those wishes?

Some may wish for regression, while others may wish for the death or resurrection of a specific person.

"So, does that mean...?"

[What Black Scythe is thinking is correct. The wish's path is nothing more than creating each person's timeline.]

"...."
ChatGPT

[In that timeline, some may live as wealthy individuals, some may have returned to the past, and others may be flaunting their abilities as players. In a way, each is dreaming their desired dream, isn't it?]

Chronos's theory was an area that became reality yet remained unreal, an impossible realm.

'In that case, does it mean Min Ju-ri, Seo Ah-rin, and Christine are also living with their wishes fulfilled? Like dreams created individually?'

In that place, Ryu Min might exist, or she might not. She was merely living in another parallel world.

[Do you understand now?]

"I understand now. Everyone is living within their own timelines. That the current me belongs to the 101st timeline, not the Ryu Min of the 1st round."

[That doesn't mean Black Scythe is a copied fake. Please don't misunderstand. The concept of parallel universes is not that simple...]

"I understand. So, what does it mean to connect the timelines you mentioned earlier?"

[In the current timeline of Black Scythe, 1.8 billion people have died. However, if we create a new timeline where Chaos and Gaia don't exist and connect it after making a future without them, we can live in a world without Chaos and Gaia while maintaining the population.]

"Is that possible?"

[If it weren't possible, I wouldn't have proposed such a suggestion.]

Connect timelines by cutting out the desired parts?

Then one can live in the desired world.

An ideal world.

'In other words, it means you can selectively edit the parts you want.'

Certainly, if it were that simple, there could be nothing better.

[How about it? Do you now have the willingness to help me?]

'Anyway, I've already made a contract to kill Chaos, and our goals align, so I was willing to help, but...'

Ryu Min felt there was no need to explicitly state this.

"All right. I'll help. But how can someone like me, without any significant power, be of assistance..."

[If you lack power, you can gain it.]

"How?"

[You know there's an enormous amount of terra buried in Drakania, right?]

"Oh."

Even though she didn't possess the same power as before, having terra could still be useful. She couldn't determine how much was buried, though.

[Moreover, the God of Slaughter here seems willing to help.]

"The God of Slaughter?"

Min Do-jun flashed a sly smile in Ryu Min's gaze.

[I'll restore all the power you had as a player.]

"All the power I had?"

[That's right.]

"But Gaia's data has already been deleted, so it's impossible..."

[Even if it may be impossible for Gaia, it's not for me.]

Ryu Min's expression shifted to surprise at Min Do-jun's confident smile.

'Recovering the original power and securing all the buried terra...'

It might not be an impossible task to confront Chaos and Gaia.

Above all, isn't the God of Time, Chronos, right by her side?

[But here's the thing. To recover the data, you need to undergo a particular ritual from me.]

"A ritual? What kind of ritual?"

[You have to become a transcendent like me to extract the latent data.]

"Transcendent?"

[It means you can become a more powerful being than you are now. Even more than a deity.]

For a moment, Ryu Min wore a puzzled expression at the sudden statement.

Then, determination gleamed in her eyes.

If it meant becoming stronger, why would she refuse?

"All right then. Please proceed, God of Slaughter."
