Title: Episode 120 of the 100th Reincarnation of a Max-Level Player

Aggregation of Results from Round 8

As soon as the title of "Time Reverser" appeared above his head, the Archbishop's gaze changed.

It wasn't because he saw the title since his gaze didn't shift upward.

It was an instinctual feeling.

'Indeed, there is a reaction.'

Is it because they are truly NPCs?

When changing titles, beings from other realms instinctively become aware of it.

Who the other person is and what reputation they have.

It's as if the settings about them are applied to the world.

"Who are you...?"

"The name doesn't matter. What matters is how I'm addressed."

"Did you really... reverse time?"

Ryumin nodded.

There was no need to say more.

'The Archbishop already sees me as a transcendent being who surpasses time.'

There's no need to read thoughts.

It's evident from the change in tone alone.

"Hehe, a Time Reverser truly exists. People live long enough to see everything. I understand now. How you possess such a powerful force."

The Archbishop, who was nodding his head, lit up his eyes.

"Then, are you the representative of Chronos?"

Ryumin nodded.

There was no reason to deny being considered the representative of a god.

The Archbishop believed Ryumin's words like they were made of steel.

Since the title of Time Reverser already proved Ryumin to be a transcendent being.

"Oh, Representative of Chronos. Meeting you is the luckiest moment of my life."

"Indeed."

Ryumin said so, displaying a somewhat blunt expression.

The Archbishop's mind quickly turned.

'Is there some dissatisfaction?'

As the Archbishop who worships a god, how should one treat the representative of that god?

Shouldn't one show respect?

Calculations reached that point, and the Archbishop smiled subtly.

"I have a genuine gift to present to the representative."

The Archbishop took something out from his bosom.

As Ryumin received it, a message appeared.
ChatGPT

[Received 'Rune Fragment of Future Vision' as a reward from Archbishop Laver of the Sacred Empire.] [Using 'Rune Fragment of Future Vision.'] [The acquired rune is automatically imprinted on the player's body!]

A smile formed on Ryumin's lips as he obtained what he desired.

"How is it? Isn't it an item fitting for the representative of the gods?"

"Indeed. It's satisfactory."

As Ryumin grinned, an information window appeared before him.

[Rune of Future Vision]

Effect: Sees the future of the target 7 seconds ahead. The future may change unpredictably depending on the circumstances.

Ryumin immediately looked into the future of the Archbishop.

Seven seconds later, the Archbishop was already a lifeless corpse.

It was something unavoidable for Ryumin to survive.

"How is it?"

"Satisfactory. In return, I wish to send you back to the gods as a reward."

"Really?"

Ryumin nodded to the reflective Archbishop and made a move.

He grabbed the Archbishop's head and twisted it.

Crack-

The neck bone snapped, and the Archbishop died.

'There's no ill feeling.'

Whether he is a real being from another realm or a created NPC, if he doesn't kill, he will cease to exist.

With a calm expression, Ryumin left the dead Archbishop sitting in the carriage and walked outside.

"Did the conversation go well?"

As the Commander of the Guard asked, Ryumin nodded, closing the carriage door.

"Yes. The Archbishop has something to think about, so he asked not to be disturbed."

"The Archbishop?"

Nodding, the Commander of the Guard understood and left without any suspicion.

After obtaining what he wanted, the 26th wave began.

While defeating monsters, Ryumin occasionally glanced at the Archbishop's carriage.

It was to monitor who was entering.

'I must not be caught for killing the Archbishop until the 30th wave.'

Ryumin's goal is to assassinate all the beings from other realms in the carriage.

Since one Mabu was riding per carriage, he had to kill a total of 50, including the Commander of the Guard and the Archbishop.

'With the Archbishop already dead, the rest must be killed.'

And that too, as quickly and efficiently as possible.

'I'll move when the last 30th wave hits.'

Waiting, the 30th wave began.

"It's a Minotaur! Defend!"

"These tough ones! They keep coming without getting tired."

"10 minutes left! Hang in there a little longer!"

Encouraging each other, players squeezed out their last strength.
ChatGPT

They, who were initially 1,202 in number, have now dwindled to the point of being in the 1,000s.

With the presence of difficulty, it was not surprising that casualties occurred.

Leaving behind those fighting with all their might, Ryumin assassinated the Mabus.

Crack-

'Five.'

Crack-

'Twenty.'

Crack-

'Forty-two.'

Moving consecutively between the carriages, Ryumin silently took the lives of the Mabus.

Although he moved covertly, the chaotic battles with monsters left other players unaware.

Crack-

'This makes fifty.'

And the last remaining Commander of the Guard.

Ryumin approached him discreetly and turned his neck.

Crack-!

All beings from other realms were now dead.

In that moment,

[The reputation of the Sacred Empire towards the Last Time Reverser has dropped from 'Neutral' to 'Hostile.']

The temple's reputation had turned hostile.

But on the other hand, there was a positive development.

[Successfully defeated all beings from other realms above humans.] [Completed the quest to hinder the upper echelons from reaching the destination.] [Quest success rewards will be given upon result calculation.] [Stat reduction debuffs will be lifted.] [Will return to the waiting area shortly.]

He had completed the betrayer quest as he desired.

Now, what about the remaining players in the regular group?

When he turned his gaze, they were still engaged in battle with the Minotaur.

'As expected.'

The quest for the regular group was to escort the upper echelons to the destination.

In other words, if the carriage was at the destination when all the allotted time was consumed, they would succeed.

On the contrary, the betrayer group's quest was to hinder the upper echelons from reaching the destination.

In other words, if there was no carriage at the destination when all the allotted time was consumed, they would succeed.

'But the betrayer group has another success condition.'

Namely, defeating all beings from other realms.

Just like now.

'If all the beings from other realms above are killed, the carriage is judged unable to move any further. The system deems the betrayer group successful in the quest.'

The success message that appeared a little while ago was evidence of that.

So, did the regular group fail?

'Not yet.'

With about 5 minutes of the time limit remaining, he did not consider it a failure.

That meant there was still a chance.
ChatGPT

'If I manipulate the numbers to make the carriage only reach the destination, the regular group can also succeed in the quest.'

In other words, even without NPCs, as long as the carriage is brought to the destination, it fulfills the success condition.

'In that case, the solution is simple.'

Ryumin created a clone and sat it at the front of the carriage.

Then, he made the carriage move towards the destination.

'If the leading carriage moves, even without Mabus, the other carriages will naturally follow.'

There is no doubt as he already experimented with this in the previous round.

The result is precisely taking advantage of the flaw in the system.

'This way, both I and the regular group will win.'

If his clone leads the carriage to the destination?

Even without Ryumin, the regular group should be able to complete the quest.

A moment later.

[Moving to the waiting area.]

With the message, Ryumin's figure disappeared.

Blinking once, he arrived at the gray space where the betrayers had gathered.

[Oh, the Black Scythe? Seeing you here, I assume you've succeeded in the quest?]

Angel Ariel's mouth twisted unpleasantly.

[Kikik, in the end, did you choose to sacrifice 1,201 lives just to live by yourself? Well, there's nothing as important as one's own life. It's a natural choice.]

It seemed the angel was unaware of the situation in the other realm.

[Don't feel guilty. It was a quest where one of the two had to die anyway.]

"..."

[And it's more interesting when the minority defeats the majority, isn't it? You provided plenty of entertainment…]

Suddenly, Ariel's expression twisted as she spoke.

[What's this? Is it an error?]

"What's going on?"

[I received information that the regular group above humans has succeeded in the quest. Something seems wrong. I need to check what happened.]

Ariel, saying that, stared into the void as if reading the system messages and remained silent for a while.

The angel broke the silence after a few minutes.

[It's absurd. Black Scythe, what have you done?]

"What do you mean?"

[According to the recorded footage, your clone moved the carriage. All beings from other realms were killed. Because of that, the carriage arrived at the destination, and the regular group succeeded in the quest.]
ChatGPT

"Oh? That's fortunate."

"Fortunate? Are you saying that you intentionally used a clone to make the carriage reach the destination? To save the regular group?"

"Yes. Isn't it better for all of us to survive together rather than me alone? It would be more interesting that way."

[....]

Ariel was at a loss for words.

'Both groups survived? Is that even possible?'

Even the guide himself did not know such a method.

Understanding and accurately grasping the system's success and failure conditions is essential; otherwise, it would be impossible.

"There shouldn't be any problem, right? The system declared it a success."

[...Right. There shouldn't be any problem.]

Though bewildered, Ariel had no choice but to acknowledge.

The Black Scythe had successfully completed the quests for both groups.

"The quests are a success. Shall I send you back to your original places?"

As those words finished, Ryumin returned frighteningly to the monochromatic space where it all began.

Looking around, many players blinked their eyes, waiting for the results.

Among them were Jo Yong-ho's group and An Sang-cheol.

Min Ju-ri, Seo Ah-rin, Heo Tae-seok, and Eom Jun-seok were also present.

'Everyone survived.'

Only a very few had died; the thousands of players seen at the beginning were still gathered in one place.

If they hadn't exploited the flaw in the system, half of them would likely have disappeared.

Anyway, shortly after the results were calculated, half of them would inevitably vanish.

'I can't stop the disappearance due to contributions.'

Eventually, Angel Ariel appeared in front of the audience.

"The escort quest has concluded. Surprisingly, there aren't many dead humans. Thanks to whom."

Ariel's gaze briefly but pointedly turned towards Ryumin.

"By the way, since there are betrayers left, there are no sub-quest completers. Now, shall we see the results?"

└3rd. Jo Yong-ho (Level 39 Mercenary King) Contribution 74,213 points

Results converted into numerical contributions.

Once again, Black Scythe overwhelmingly secured the top contribution.

Unlike other players, sweeping through three upper areas alone and collecting monsters naturally led to a high contribution.

When Ryumin took the first place again, players couldn't help but click their tongues.

But above all, the overwhelming level of 80 silenced the players' conversations.

"Crazy. How did they already reach level 80?"

"I haven't even reached level 40 yet."

"Wow, even after struggling for 5 hours, I can't keep up with Black Scythe."

"I really want to know the secret to leveling up."

Envy, jealousy, and admiration mixed in the gazes directed at Ryumin.

Regardless, Ryumin was focused only on the reward that appeared before him.

It was the hidden betrayer quest success reward marked with a question mark.
