Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 251"

Authority

10 seconds passed.

Ryum's eyes, which were blurry, suddenly opened.

"Is it over?"

Yongke also did not lose consciousness.

Thanks to the potion of instant regeneration, he was able to protect over a thousand people.

Ryum suddenly turned his head.

Hundreds of pairs of eyes looked at Ryum with respectful gazes.

These people would have all died if Ryum hadn't stepped forward.

"Lord Black Scythe..."

"Oh, Almighty..."

Some of the believers, including Huh Taeseok, looked at him as if truly seeing a god.

Some even clasped their hands and prayed.

There was awe in Kristen's gaze too.

As if witnessing the resurrection of a god who sacrificed himself for humanity.

[The time limit has expired.] [You have succeeded in the third mission.] [Survivors: 1,048, Deceased: 104.] [Congratulations! You have completed the main quest!] [The location will be moved shortly for the final settlement.]

It was a joyous announcement, but no one could smile.

There were bloodstains all around Ryum.

It seemed that everyone understood the cost of sacrifice.

Not liking the solemn atmosphere, Ryum casually spoke.

"Why is it so quiet? You can be happy without worrying about me."

"But Lord Black Scythe's condition..."

"Don't worry about me. I'm fine contrary to appearances. Even if I were hurt, it wouldn't matter. I'm satisfied just for saving many people."

"Oh..."

"Lord Black Scythe..."

People with grateful eyes, admiring his noble aspect, looked at him.

In just a few words, he became a savior figure.

'Having a good image isn't bad.'

While enjoying the joy with a kind smile, a welcome notification appeared before his eyes.

[Hidden Sub Quest Available!]

└ Receive the most damage in the third mission

└ Upon success ▶ Sacrificial Rune granted

[You have completed the sub quest!] [As a reward for the sub quest, you are granted the 'Sacrificial Rune'!] [The acquired rune will automatically be engraved on the player's body!]

'As expected, the sub quest reward has come.'

"To protect others, there was a need for action, but in reality, what Ryum anticipated was the reward for this sub-quest.

[Sacrificial Rune]

Effect: Designate one target within a radius of 100m to take damage on behalf of the caster. The damage taken is reduced based on the caster's defense.

It can be released at the caster's will. However, it will automatically be released if the target moves out of the range.

'The Sacrificial Rune, not a bad rune.'

No, it's actually good.

To the extent that it should be included in the list of 18 runes that one must acquire.

'There's no better rune to protect someone.'

A rune that takes the damage intended for the desired target.

Literally, a sacrificing rune.

'If placed on someone playing a crucial role in the party, like Kristen, it would be perfect.'

Instead, Ryum would have to take the damage intended for Kristen, but there is no need to worry.

Since the defense is adjusted to Ryum's level.

'If I can endure it, Kristen would practically become invincible.'

It's a good rune, but it wasn't just to obtain this one sub-quest.

'This time, sub-quests are more important than ever in this round.'

The reason will be revealed by an angel.

After a while, the background rippled, and players returned one by one to colorless spaces.

[Hoo hoo, how was the mission? Wasn't it more challenging than you thought...?]

The angel, who was smiling, quickly turned serious as she looked at over a thousand survivors.

[You survived more than expected? I thought at most around 100 would survive...]

'A hundred is overestimating it. If it were as usual, probably not even 50 would have survived.'

Ryum silently scoffed and looked around.

It was a sight he had never seen in 100 regressions.

So many people standing here after completing Round 15.

"Let's see... 1,048 people survived? How could so many survive? Is this exceeding expectations?"

The angel's surprise was similar to the emotions people had experienced just a few minutes ago.

They couldn't have imagined that Black Scythe would sacrifice his own body for us and shield us like a shield.

'Lord Black Scythe...'

'Lord Black Scythe is truly our savior.'

People looked at Ryum with such eyes.
ChatGPT

When 2,000 pairs of eyes were focused on Ryum, it couldn't help but be burdensome for him.

As he secretly sighed, thinking about what he needed to do next.

'Maybe those gazes will turn to resentment with just a slight change.'

At that moment, when people were subtly catching their breath, the angel made a statement that would shock everyone.

[You may or may not be aware, but there was a hidden sub-quest in this round. It was a quest where the person who received the most damage in the third mission would win. Not particularly surprising, right?]

Up to this point, it wasn't that surprising; after all, there had been a sub-quest in every round except for Rounds 1 and 6.

The real surprise came next.

[But this sub-quest is a bit different. Unlike in previous rounds, this time the person who claimed the sub-quest will be given authority. What kind of authority, you ask?]

The angel grinned with a devilish smile.

[It's the authority to determine the rankings of the players.]

"Rankings of the players...?"

"What does that mean?"

For those who didn't immediately understand, the angel explained with a smile.

[Until now, we've measured records, determined rankings, and filled achievers accordingly, right? But this round is different. The person who completed the sub-quest can directly designate achievers from 2nd to 576th place.]

"What, what are you saying?"

"Directly determine the rankings?"

[In other words, the human who sacrificed the most has the power to control the life and death of other humans. Quite ironic, isn't it? Hehe.]

It was a situation as paradoxical as the angel's words.

The person who had suffered the most sacrifices could control the lives of others.

People felt a dizzying shock.

"Shall we take a look? The human who received the most damage in the third mission is..."]

The angel's eyes widened dramatically.

It was an unusual reaction.

"It's Black Scythe? Huh, but the damage he took is over 2 trillion..."]

The angel, who couldn't help but be amazed, shook her head.

[Now I understand. How you were able to keep so many people alive. Did he really bear all those attacks alone?]

"..."

There was no obligation to answer.

The intention to mock was quite evident.
ChatGPT

[However, what should I do about this? Unfortunately, it looks like I have to discard half of them.]

Since only 576 could survive, it was an unavoidable situation.

"Now, Black Scythe. I will grant you the authority over the life and death of other players."

As the angel's words ended, a message appeared ominously.

[The player who achieved the sub-quest in Round 15 is 'Black Scythe.'] [Player 'Black Scythe' is given the authority to adjust the rankings in Round 15.] [You cannot change the 1st place to Black Scythe himself.] [Please specify the order from 2nd to 576th.] [Players ranked 2nd and 3rd will receive special rewards, while the rest will receive the same rewards regardless of rank.] [Please call out the nickname of the player you want to designate as 2nd.]

Ryum silently observed the message.

The fate of others rested in his hands.

Turning his head, he saw numerous eyes focused on him.

It felt burdensome, but Ryum designated without hesitation.

He knew it would come to this.

"Krishi."

[The 2nd place is 'Krishi.'] [Please designate the 3rd place.]

"Democratic."

Up to the 3rd place, they would receive special rewards as usual.

'The rewards for 2nd and 3rd place should go to Kristen and Minjoo, who had the most influence.'

On the other hand, the rest remained the same.

So, from 4th to 576th place, the order didn't matter.

The problem was whether to be within the top 576 or not.

That difference decided whether they would go to heaven or hell.

[The 4th place is 'Seo Arin.'] [Please designate the 5th place.]

...

[The 10th place is 'Nopaein Nogei.'] [Please designate the 11th place.]

...

[The 13th place is 'Ddung Meongcheong-i.'] [Please designate the 14th place.]

...

Ryum called out nicknames without hesitation.

Russell, Jo Yongho, Victor, Sofia, Yanti, and so on.

He put his key forces first on the list of survivors.

After that, he filled in the rest with the nicknames of the believers of the Death Cult.

'Of course, I have to keep the Death Cult believers who followed me alive.'

With that, he easily filled up to 400th place.

The problem was the remaining 176.

'Who should I keep alive?'

Ryum, who called out nicknames without hesitation, fell silent for the first time.

A contemplative figure amidst the dilemma.
ChatGPT

[Please designate the 401st place.]

Upon seeing the blinking message in front of everyone, players shouted as if this was their chance.

"Lord Black Scythe! Me! Please spare me!"

"Me too! Please include me in the list of survivors! I beg you!"

"Hey, who pushed me?"

"I can't see, so move aside a bit!"

People rushed towards Ryum like a cloud.

Those who ran to beg for their lives hesitated to approach Ryum closely due to his sharp and piercing gaze.

They appealed from a distance of 10 meters.

"Please spare me. I have a mother at home. She'll be really sad if I die."

"Is your family the only one you have? I have a baby who hasn't even been alive for 100 days!"

"I'm a father of twins! If I die, our family will starve to death!"

"I'm your twin!"

"This is ridiculous!"

Suddenly, grabbing each other by the collar, nearly 600 people struggled, swearing to survive.

There was no sign of the maturity one might expect from players who had overcome adversity.

'Well, isn't it natural when their lives are at stake?'

Amidst this, there were also people who remained motionless, either due to pride or their original personalities.

'Is that person... Grand Sorcerer Alex?'

Up until Round 19, there were only two survivors besides Ryum.

They were none other than the rivals who competed for the 2nd and 3rd places in the entire zone, Magyeongrok and Jusungtak.

'And up until Round 18, there were seven survivors, excluding me.'

Two of them were the aforementioned Magyeongrok and Jusungtak, and the other five were Minjoo, Yanti, Victor, and...

'There was [Alex] and the revered [Dorothy], who was worshipped as a divine archer.'

In other words, these two were the cream of the crop among those who survived until Round 18.

Looking back, I could see Dorothy's figure.

'I never had a chance to get close to them, probably because they were foreigners.'

Alex was of German nationality and was known for being the only sorcerer class.

Dorothy, on the other hand, was a divine archer from the Netherlands.

'I wish I had a chance to meet them.'

Ryum's voice cut through the noise of the marketplace.

"Alex."
ChatGPT

[The 400th place is 'Alex.'] [Please designate the 401st place.]

Perhaps not expecting to be called himself, Alex seemed taken aback.

"Dorothy."

Dorothy was similarly surprised.

Ryum continued to call out nicknames.

Now that he had selected everyone he needed, it didn't matter whom he chose anymore.

He simply read a bit into their inner thoughts and, as long as there were no personality issues, included them as survivors.

He filled up to 575th place like that, and when there was only one spot left.

The remaining nearly 500 players pleaded desperately, clinging to Black Scythe.

"Please, I beg you. Lord Black Scythe."

"Please spare me, I don't want to die. Please."

"I'll do anything you ask. I'll live like a slave for the rest of my life. So please...."

Kneeling was the norm, and there were even people shedding tears as they begged.

However, Ryum had already decided on the last survivor.

'The last one is...'

As Ryum hesitated, his gaze settled on one person.
