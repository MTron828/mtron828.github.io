Title: "Episode 129 of the 100th Reincarnation for the Max-Level Player"

Advice

Gulp-

In a tense situation, Guyeonseung swallowed dry saliva.

'What's going on?'

Up until now, the actors had been killing without any issues. Using Hong Sun-ah as bait was a piece of cake, and stealing items and killing were even easier. With the ability to erase traces, they could cleanly hide the evidence. If they coordinated their stories, escaping police investigations was not a difficult task.

Thus, they used fellow celebrity players, devoured items, and increased their value. Guyeonseung was proud of his criminal intelligence, boasting enough to handle setting traps and handling aftermaths like a pro. He rarely made mistakes.

However.

'Where did it go wrong, damn it!'

He had never experienced such a crisis while killing 32 people. There was no business in front of Duguri, so it was natural. But a black scythe?

The monster that had held the top rank in the entire zone throughout the 8 rounds and had just reached level 80 appeared now?

From the perspective of Guyeonseung, it was beyond comprehension.

It was like trying to catch fish, and instead, a shark latched onto the bait.

'No, was it really a black scythe from the beginning? Just because he's holding a scythe doesn't mean it's a black scythe, right?'

Doubts arose, but only for a moment.

Watching the cleanly severed necks of the two actors, Guyeonseung thought, 'The guy in front of me might really have a black scythe.'

'I didn't even see him swing it. I didn't even hear the sound of the neck being cut.'

That meant the opponent had high agility stats to the point where attacks were invisible, and their damage output was exceptional. Even though it was just one swing, it was enough to feel the gap with the opponent.

'It's like the difference between heaven and earth. It's at a level that I can't even fathom.'

Once he grasped the opponent's skill, Guyeonseung's brain quickly worked.

Thud-

He immediately knelt and cast the acting he was proud of.

"P-Please spare me. I haven't done anything wrong!"

Guyeonseung pointed at the other actors with his finger.

"Them! They're the ones who ordered and made me do it!"

Amidst the unexpected discord, four male actors, including Hong Sun-ah, wore bewildered expressions.

"W-What are you talking about? Senior Gu?"

"Why are you blaming us?"

"He's lying! Don't believe that bastard! We were ordered to do it! In fact, he was the mastermind!"

Upon hearing this, the furious Guyeonseung abruptly stood up.

"What? What did you say? Bastard? Is that how you talk to a senior, you son of a bitch?"

The juniors glared, seemingly unwilling to back down.

"What about you? Is selling out juniors to survive what a senior does? You bastard!"

"What did you say? I'll really kill you!"

Guyeonseung raised his staff as if he were about to cast a spell.

In response, the other juniors also brandished their weapons, eyeing each other as if ready to kill.

It was truly a chaotic situation, unlike any other.

But all of this was part of Guyeonseung's plan.

"Enough! This should make it look like a genuine internal conflict, right?"

A third-party observer would inevitably be at ease watching this unfold.

Slyly shifting his gaze, Guyeonseung noticed the Black Scythe, who seemed to dismissively shake his head at the actors growling at each other.

"Now's the time!"

As if about to attack his junior, Guyeonseung raised his staff.

"Bastard, do you really want to die?"

While doing so, he turned abruptly, aiming for the face of the Black Scythe, using a skill.

"Black Arrow!"

Normally, it was standard to restrict movement with black chains before shooting a black arrow. However, since it was a surprise attack, there was no time for such constraints.

"No matter how powerful the Black Scythe is, getting hit in the head should be fatal!"

The arrow imbued with magic hit directly on target.

Thud!

"Got it! It went in perfectly...!"

Guyeonseung's expression, which had been filled with joy, suddenly stiffened.

The arrow he thought had hit narrowly missed, hitting the wall.

"He dodged in the nick of a second?"

Truly insane reflexes.

The actors watching this unfold rolled their eyes, wondering what was happening.

Ryumin laughed sarcastically from the sidelines.

"Forget about this pathetic act. Did you think I would let my guard down if you pretended to fight with your colleagues?"

An awkward expression crossed Guyeonseung's face as he realized the situation.
ChatGPT

The juniors widened their eyes as if they had no idea.

They were the ones who had genuinely believed that Guyeonseung was betraying his colleagues.

"I told you, didn't I? Not to mess around."

"Y-You son of a bitch!"

Guyeonseung openly aimed his staff.

With things having come to this point, there was no room to step back.

Shrrrr-

If the black chains could entangle the Black Scythe, he thought he could escape.

But with Ryumin, who could read thoughts and see 7 seconds into the future, there was no chance he would just stand still.

Swoosh-

Swiftly moving out of the chain's range, Ryumin appeared behind Guyeonseung like a ghost.

"You dodged well."

As the scythe swung, Guyeonseung's staff fell to the ground.

"Aaargh!"

"You picked the wrong opponent."

To a magician, a staff was akin to the trigger of a gun. Even if he used Black Arrows now, he wouldn't be able to aim properly.

"S-Stay away, kill him!"

Feeling the danger, the male actors rushed towards the Black Scythe simultaneously.

However, Ryumin had no intention of being an opponent for them.

Thudududuk-

With a single blow, the heads of the four actors floated in the air, and their bodies crashed to the ground like cut-off dolls.

Thunk-

Submitting to that overwhelming force, Guyeonseung collapsed to the ground.

Already disabled in his arms, resistance was nothing but a dream.

"...."

Ryumin silently surveyed the surroundings.

Guyeonseung, whimpering on the ground with trembling arms, and a surprised Seoarin caught his eye.

Even though one person was missing, there was no issue.

He had already sensed the presence through his perception.

Puh-

"Aaah!"

As the scythe sliced through the air, a sharp scream erupted.

Automatically becoming visible, Hong Sun-ah appeared, her legs shaking like leaves.

Raising her thigh, Ryumin's scythe was embedded like a fork.

Swoosh-

With a forceful movement, blood splattered as both thighs were cleanly severed.

Thump-

"Kkihiiiee...."

Hong Sun-ah's eyes rolled back as she fell like a bug, twitching.

Unable to bear the agonizing sight, Guyeonseung couldn't bring himself to look.

"Seoarin."

"Yes?"

"I've never seen you in reality."

"Oh, uh..."

Seoarin widened her eyes in surprise.

"Hello. Nice to meet you, Black Scythe."

"...."
ChatGPT

Guyeonseung looked at them with an incredulous expression.

Hong Sun-ah, as if asking when this happened, stopped whimpering and glared at Seoarin.

'Seoarin and the Black Scythe know each other?'

'How could that girl have the Black Scythe? No way?'

A common assumption popped into both their heads.

'Did that girl really request support from the Black Scythe?'

'In that case, we might be the ones trapped in a trap...?'

Although Ryumin knew that the two of them misunderstood, he didn't mind.

After all, they were soon going to die.

'Of course, I won't kill them with my own hands.'

Ryumin intended to leave their judgment to Seoarin.

It would be more satisfying from Seoarin's perspective as well.

"Seoarin. I'll give you the chance to kill these two."

"...."

"If you want to spare them, I won't stop you. So decide. Their life or death."

At the unexpected turn of events, Seoarin's eyes widened.

Guyeonseung and Hong Sun-ah were the same.

Realizing that their lives were hanging by a thread on Seoarin's whim, the two quickly spoke up.

"Ah, Arin-ah. No, Miss Arin! Please spare us. I'm Guyeonseung. We worked on projects together. Remember the affection we had back then and spare us just once..."

"Senior Gu, shut up! In terms of projects, I've shot way more with Arin! Arin! It's me! Your lifelong friend, Sun-ah! Think about the memories we shared. Huh? Spare me a bit. I still don't want to die, heh heh."

"That crazy bastard is begging so pathetically. Miss Arin, don't be fooled. That guy is trash. Do you know how much he cursed you behind your back?"

"When did I do that! Don't believe Senior Gu's words! It's all lies!"

"Wow, what an shameless woman. Pretending to be friends with Arin and acting like this. I'm even better than her."

"Ha, it's unbelievable. The beast who used to shake its tail at the thought of doing that when Arin came, who was that?"

"When did I! Don't make up lies, you son of a bitch!"

The two raised their voices.

Seoarin, who now held the power of life and death, pondered.

But the contemplation didn't last long.

As they were nothing but trash, there was nothing to think about.

"Both of you are utterly despicable."

ChatGPT

"...What?"

"I've made a decision."

"T-That so? You're going to spare us, right?"

"Huh? Arin. We were friends, right? Yeah?"

Although the two looked at her desperately, Seoarin's gaze remained cold.

Fortunately, the cooldown had reset.

Seoarin summoned her fairies.

"Kill them both."

"W-Wait!"

"Arin!"

Following the owner's command, the fairies unleashed beams of light.

Zzziiiiing-!

"Aaargh!"

"Kyaaaargh!"

They, who had already lost their combat abilities, had no strength to resist.

The beams aimed at their heads burned so intensely that their faces were barely visible.

Witnessing this, Ryumin felt a sense of accomplishment.

'At first, they were worried about the lives of those bastards who had tried to rape them. How much they've changed.'

This was the second time Ryumin had saved Seoarin, the first being when she was about to be victimized by the Hwang Yong-min group.

Whether Seoarin knew this fact or not, she bowed her head towards Ryumin.

"Thank you, Black Scythe. You saved me once before, and now again. I received a grace that cannot be expressed in words. I'm truly grateful."

"Do you believe that I'm the Black Scythe?"

"Well, yes. Can I recognize the weapon you had as the Black Scythe's? Although your appearance and voice are different...."

Other than that, the atmosphere, physique, and the overwhelming strength were similar to the Black Scythe.

That was why Seoarin believed in Ryumin as the Black Scythe.

Seeing her reaction, Ryumin felt relieved.

'Changing into this form was a good idea. If it were my original physique, I might have been suspected.'

Ryumin, still transformed into a Lost Yak, donned a mask.

Unlike before, this form had a large stature and a muscular build.

It was a precautionary measure, as being smaller might raise suspicions of her being the Prophet.

"I want to repay you. Is there anything you desire? I've been thinking about it for a long time, but it seems like there's not much I can offer."

"Don't worry about repaying. I didn't ask for any compensation for my actions."

"However, to be honest, saying this may be impolite, but how did you know about this place? It's a question out of curiosity, and I hope you won't misunderstand."

Well, it was natural to be curious.

Appearing as if she had waited for a moment of crisis and revealing herself as none other than the Black Scythe.

Ryumin, who had already thought of an excuse, spoke without hesitation.

"It's a coincidence."

"What?"

"I happened to see you passing by and followed you because I felt glad. That's how I found out about the existence of this club."

"Ah...."

"It seems that there are trash who plunder fellow players."

"That's true. I didn't know about that before...."

Seoarin bowed her head, looking at the corpses.

As if to erase the gloomy thoughts, Ryumin used her ability to clean up the bodies, leaving the scene as tidy as before.

The nine corpses that were there initially disappeared, and the area looked neat.

"Forget about what happened before. Look ahead and move forward. Think only about yourself. Don't worry about others."

"...."

"While I'm at it, let me give you a few more pieces of advice. Be careful with people. The enemy is not far away; they are close by. Never let your guard down; always be cautious and suspicious of your surroundings."

Ryumin was not the type to give advice to gain Seoarin's trust, but she was confident that giving such advice would make Seoarin suspect someone else rather than herself.

Sure enough, Seoarin was thinking about the two people: An Sang-chul and Ma Kyung-rok.

"Thank you for the advice that can be the bones and flesh. I've always received help from Black Scythe. I wonder how I should repay this...."

"As I said earlier, there's no need to repay. If I wanted something from you, I would have asked for it from the moment I saved you."

"...."

Seoarin's eyebrows twitched.

She didn't want anything from you.

Those words inadvertently touched Seoarin's pride.

'This should be enough to achieve the goal.'

As if it were time, Ryumin turned away.

And she left a casual farewell.

"If we leave together, we might be suspected. Come out in 5 minutes. There's no need to report to the police without evidence."

"Uh, hey, Black Scythe...."

With those words, Ryumin left the room.

"....Nim."

Seoarin stood still, staring in the direction where Black Scythe had disappeared.

She was determined to wait for 5 minutes, as instructed.

During that time, Seoarin pondered over Black Scythe's advice.

"Black Scythe was right. I trusted the security guard and the CEO too much."

Ma Kyung-rok already harbored unfavorable feelings. This was inevitable, considering the previous attempts to use her as an entertainment hostess.

"Considering that loyal underling, the security guard, served such a questionable CEO...."

She might follow immoral orders without hesitation.

This meant she could be betrayed at any moment.

It was reasonable, given that An Sang-chul, who was originally assigned as a surveillance agent, could potentially betray her.

"I've been too trusting of people around me."

Was it because she had almost been betrayed by a trusted colleague actor?

Or was it due to Black Scythe's advice?

Suspicion and caution began to grow in Seoarin's heart.

At the same time, she was becoming certain.

Thump, thump, thump –

Her feelings toward Black Scythe.
