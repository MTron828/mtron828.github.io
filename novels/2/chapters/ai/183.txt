Title: "Episode 183 of the 100th Reincarnation of a Max Level Player"

Justification

John Delgado was a man who had a lot of dissatisfaction with the world.

In his late twenties with a healthy body, he had achieved nothing in terms of career or marriage.

"All because of this world. The world must perish."

His wish, uttered like a habit, came true as if it were a lie when 2022 arrived.

Survival Game of Angels.

Within it, John obtained a powerful profession called the Necromancer.

"I can control the souls of corpses?"

A profession that collects souls to resurrect them as undead entities.

Undead entities only suffer damage from magical attacks, making them difficult to kill.

In other words, it was an overpowered ability.

Originally, it was hard to find monsters that used magic.

"And not just monsters, I can control players as well."

Even though undead entities only exert half the strength of their original abilities, isn't that something?

"I can control dozens as my subordinates."

The number of undead that a Necromancer can control is equal to the Necromancer's level.

In other words, if the Necromancer is level 40, they can summon 40, and if they are level 99, they can summon 99.

"This is insane. Am I like a complete mob boss or something?"

Despite lacking confidence in physical combat, John, who was confident in commanding from behind, quickly claimed the top spot in the region rankings.

Even though he couldn't make it to the overall region ranking.

"Darn it, even though I'm the top player in this region, why have I never made a name in the overall region?"

John always hovered around 4th place in the overall region ranking.

It was incomprehensible.

Despite becoming a powerful player who could devastate the battlefield with dozens of summoned creatures, there were still three people stronger than him?

Especially puzzling was the existence of the Black Scythe, who consistently ranked 1st in the overall region ranking.

"What kind of guy is he to have such a high level? What's the Reaper's profession?"

His own profession was rare as well, but seeing a nickname and profession that matched so well was a first.

"I need to get stronger. I need stronger subordinates, not just filling the numbers with monsters."

As much as I wanted to assemble only boss monsters, it couldn't be helped since bosses couldn't be controlled.

"Let's create a religion. Create a religion called Despairism to attract players."

This way, I can create subordinates in a hurry when needed and discover talented individuals.

So, John founded Despairism and searched for members.

Although he was able to gather a few in the same region, it wasn't enough.

"We need to find followers not only in this realm but also in reality."

He propagated the idea that now the players should be the privileged class, overthrowing the existing world into despair and creating a new one.

As a result, he often faced opposition, being treated as a cult leader or a charlatan.

He even had to resort to committing murder during conflicts.

Nevertheless, John didn't give up.

Whenever he heard of a somewhat successful player, he made efforts to recruit them, regardless of the region.

One day, he heard a story from players in another region.

There was a being called the Holy Maiden.

"In our region, there's a Priest named Krisi. She's called the Holy Maiden, and her followers number over 50."

A Holy Maiden.

John was dumbfounded.

"Someone like me is creating a religion and calling themselves a leader, right?"

Later, he found out that it wasn't a religion, but it didn't matter.

The fact that a competitor had emerged remained unchanged.

"I need to undermine their influence. I also want to obtain the summon creature called Priest."

John granted the informant a position equivalent to Despairism's Vice High Priest.

And he gave him one specific mission.

To infiltrate as a follower of the Holy Maiden and act as a spy.

"I will accept the mission, High Priestess."

Berber was a capable spy.

Without getting caught, she gathered information about the Holy Maiden in each round.

Some days, she even brought back top-tier information.

"There's a Paladin named Douglas inside. He admires the Holy Maiden, but lately, he's been accumulating dissatisfaction. If manipulated well, we might be able to bring him to our side."

"It would be good to have a traitor. Convince him skillfully and pull him towards our side."
ChatGPT

John waited for the opportunity to kill Kristen, even managing to bring Douglas to his side.

They couldn't meet due to being in different regions, but the opportunity would come.

If they were both Americans, they would eventually meet through region integration.

After gathering 200 followers and waiting for the right moment, Round 11 arrived.

And the regions were unified.

The seven regions in the United States, which were divided, were now merged into one.

"The time has finally come."

John decided to kill the Holy Maiden to undermine her influence.

There was no need to keep the followers alive; each one was a valuable point and had to be killed.

Even though they were both Americans, they belonged to different regions.

As competitors, they were only obstacles to overcome in the regional team battles.

Therefore, there was no reason not to kill them.

"Of course, I must kill the Holy Maiden and make her my subordinate."

The plan was executed, and even the Paladin was betrayed.

"But damn, the Paladin betrayed our cult and is serving the Holy Maiden."

Fortunately, they were able to find and kill him before it was too late, but another interference appeared.

"Who is this guy?"

A man with a large scythe hanging on his shoulder.

"A scythe?"

Hearing the word scythe brought to mind a certain nickname.

"No way, it can't be. That person."

What were the chances of encountering the rank 1 player at such a crucial moment?

He didn't know, but there was a higher chance it wasn't the Black Scythe.

Even though scythes were commonly available in stores, and not all scythe users were Reapers.

"Still, he's not an ordinary guy. He killed my undead in one shot."

Even if he knew magic was his weakness, he wasn't an easy opponent.

"What are you doing?"

"Just a passerby."

He looked like an East Asian but spoke English.

Closing his eyes and listening, the pronunciation was so good that it wouldn't be strange if he were an American.

"Was the Black Scythe East Asian?"

He didn't know for sure, but he couldn't let this guy interfere.

"If you're just passing by, don't meddle in other people's business and keep going."

John gave the presumed East Asian with the Black Scythe an opportunity.

He didn't want unnecessary fights with a third party.

"To be honest, he looks strong. I'd rather not fight if possible."
ChatGPT

However, it seems he has no intention of just passing by.

"The woman looks in danger right now. Isn't she?"

"I told you not to meddle."

"How can you just stand by when someone is in trouble?"

"I won't ask about the sin of killing my subordinates. So, go. It's the final warning."

He prepared to summon his creatures at any moment, glaring as if ready to kill.

"He's not an ordinary guy. I can't afford to be overwhelmed by his momentum."

If they ended up fighting, he would go all out to kill him.

With that thought in mind, he waited for the guy's response.

The response was predictable, though.

"He can't just overlook injustice. He'll probably offer to save her like a prince on a white horse."

Just by unexpectedly intervening, it was clear that he was already planning to rescue her in his mind.

However, an unexpected situation occurred.

"Alright. Seems like I interfered unnecessarily. I'll just go my way."

The man presumed to be the Black Scythe casually stated that he would pass by.

Watching this unexpected remark, Kristen, who had been observing, couldn't help but be surprised.

"Wait, wasn't he supposed to save me?"

Whether it was a joke or not, the man turned his back indifferently.

At the same time, in her desperation, she shouted behind him.

"H-Help! This person is trying to kill me!"

"Shut up, you bitch!"

Before the man could change his mind, John commanded the remaining undead to kill the Holy Maiden.

But.

Crack!

The undead's attack fell short.

Ryumin discharged electricity once again, annihilating the undead.

"What are you doing! Didn't I clearly say I wouldn't interfere?"

"Even if you said so, I don't want to see someone die in front of me. If you want to do it, wait until I'm gone, okay?"

"...."

If you want to kill someone, do it after you leave?

"You arrogant bastard!"

It was a remark that hurt his pride, but John held back.

What he just witnessed confirmed it.

"He's a formidable guy. You can tell just by the fact that he killed my undead in one shot."

Whether he was the Black Scythe or not, one thing was certainâ€”he was a strong opponent.
ChatGPT

Moreover, the speed of the electrical current was so fast that it was difficult to react to it with the naked eye.

If the direction had been towards him, he wouldn't have survived.

"Now, let's go."

Ryumin, who turned his back as if indifferent, was actually observing the entire situation with his telescopic vision.

Because he had to protect Kristen.

"But I can't openly offer help."

Ryumin hesitated to step forward.

The justification.

He lacked the justification to save Kristen.

"The fact that I appeared when she was in danger could be considered a coincidence. But rescuing a woman I've never seen before, with no prior connection?"

He could say he had an intolerant personality towards injustice, having already established a strong image of dedication to justice by eradicating ISIS in Nigeria.

"But in this situation, can I really determine if it's unjust or not?"

As a third party, Ryumin couldn't know if Kristen deserved to die or not.

The words of the Necromancer about saving her were mere interference and overstepping boundaries.

"So, I need a justification. A reason to save her."

Without a justification, offering help could lead to suspicion.

Given that this was his first encounter with Kristen, helping her carelessly could ruin any potential relationship.

"Please save me! He's trying to kill me for no reason!"

Kristen pleaded desperately, but Ryumin didn't react.

"That's not it. To detain me, it's not enough."

To receive help, she would have to offer something in return, like giving items or presenting some form of compensation.

But Kristen seemed flustered and didn't seem to consider that.

"Just go your way. Don't pay attention to that crazy woman."

Despite the Necromancer urging him, Ryumin couldn't just stand there.

"Fine."

"Wait, just a moment. Please, just a moment..."

"I told you to shut up, you son of a bitch! I'll kill you..."

The Necromancer shouted but stopped when he saw Ryumin's expression.

"He wants me to leave quickly."

That way, he could kill Kristen as he wanted.

"Hmm, it's tricky without a justification to help...."
ChatGPT

Ryumin, who was contemplating, suddenly had a good idea.

He stopped in his tracks and looked at the Necromancer.

Ryumin furrowed his brows, as if asking what's going on.

"You, I mean."

"....?"

"Come to think of it, your tone is a bit disrespectful, isn't it?"

In English, there's no concept of honorifics; it's just a matter of respectful or disrespectful language. Judging by the conversation with the Necromancer, it was clearly the latter.

"Who do you think you are, telling me to go or stay, or giving orders like that? Are you my boss or something?"

"...."

Engaging in a confrontation with a street-smart attitude, Ryumin made a provocation. It was a somewhat crude approach, but it was effective; the Necromancer noticeably looked taken aback.

"Hey? Why aren't you saying anything? Do you want to die?"

"If my words sounded rude, I apologize."

Could the Necromancer understand Ryumin's intention? He seemed to be breaking his pride and lowering his tail.

"If it sounded impolite, I apologize."

Ryumin shamelessly extended his hand.

"What's this...?"

"If it bothers you, how about an apology? You should show some sincerity."

Although it was akin to extortion, it was clear that the Necromancer was flustered.

"Why are you silent? Do you want to die?"

"If my words were rude, I apologize."

Did Ryumin's intention come across? The Necromancer, feeling defeated, reluctantly took out an item.

"Is this enough?"

"Are you kidding me? You want to settle this with some unknown material item? Is that supposed to be an item to use or just trash? Why do I suddenly feel so disgusted?"

"Dammit!"

"What? What's wrong?"

The Necromancer, unable to tolerate Ryumin's taunting, made a fatal mistake.

Suddenly, thirty undead creatures appeared and attacked Ryumin simultaneously.

A perfectly coordinated surprise attack from all directions.

However, with the ability to read thoughts and the Rune of Foresight, Ryumin couldn't have missed the surprise attack.

"Wide-Area Discharge."

Zzzzzzap!

As the current spread in a hemispherical shape, everything within a 30m radius disappeared instantly.

"...."

In an instant, John Delgado, who lost thirty summoned creatures, stared at Ryumin with a vacant look.

"What are you?"

"...."

"Did you just attack me?"
ChatGPT

Ryumin approached and asked, but John Delgado was too overwhelmed to respond.

The intimidating aura was so intense that there was no room for him to gather his thoughts.

"I tried to let it go if possible, but it seems impossible. Are you trying to aggressively kill an innocent passerby?"

Ryumin, standing close, smirked, twisting his lips.

"Do you want to die?"

Now he had a good reason to kill him.
