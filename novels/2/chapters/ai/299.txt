Title: Episode 299 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player

Three Men

"Ah. Ah."

For players surpassing level 90, facing an ogre alone was more than enough.

Especially if they had high-grade items.

However, Christine was a non-combat class without even a common attack skill.

She was essentially an ordinary person among players, causing confusion among them.

'What, what should I do?'

She was so bewildered that she stood frozen, unable to think of fleeing.

Christine's feet hit the ground when the ogre roared.

Roarrr!

Without looking back, Christine sprinted through the forest.

The ogre's roar, meant to intimidate, ironically made its prey run away.

Thump, thump, thump!

Christine ran forward, keeping her eyes on the path ahead.

There was no time to look back, nor was there any need.

Thud, thud, thud!

The approaching sound of the ogre's footsteps sent shivers down her spine.

'What do I do? It seems to be getting close.'

Despite her efforts, outrunning the ogre with a height exceeding 3 meters was no easy task.

Thud, thud, thud!

The sound of the ogre's footsteps grew closer, and suddenly, the shadow loomed over her as if it would engulf her.

Roarrr!

The ogre reached out its arm to grab its prey's head.

But.

Thunk!

The ogre's arm, blocked by a shield, bounced back with resilience.

Even its large body was pushed more than 15 meters away by an invisible force.

It was all thanks to Christine's high-grade armor, [Wings of Eros].

"[Blocked the fatal blow.] [Uses remaining: 1/2] [Each use has a 12-hour cooldown.]"

Though the message appeared, Christine continued to run, avoiding and leaping over obstacles.

She didn't run without thinking, carefully using trees as cover or moving through narrow paths where the ogre had difficulty entering.

However, as if to dismiss such efforts, the ogre smashed through the trees and continued its pursuit.

Crash, crash!

Roarrr!

Terrified, Christine quickly opened the quest progress window.

"To, I have to ask nearby players for help."

To survive, she had no choice but to seek help from others.

Fortunately, at the top of her list, there was a player 150 meters away.

She checked the player's nickname and face, then immediately activated tracking.

[Facial and nickname match. Tracking the target's location.] [Player 'Scholar's' location identified.] [Currently 148m away.] [Follow the arrow in front to track the target.]

Knowing that someone nearby could provide assistance was a welcome relief, but Christine's expression remained consistently dark.

In the meantime, she closed the distance and allowed the ogre to strike once more.

"[Blocked the fatal blow.] [Uses remaining: 2/2] [All remaining uses have been used.] [Cooldown until recharge: 24 hours.]"

Now, if caught, she would die.

This realization fueled Christine's determination even more.

However, with her mediocre stats, it was challenging to create distance.

"Haah, haah, haah..."

Thud, thud, thud.

Despite using the strength of her armor to bounce the ogre back 15m, the gap closed.

Is this the end?

When the ogre's shadow loomed again in front of her, she felt that way.

She had heard that one's life flashes before their eyes when they die, but that didn't happen.

Just the thought of one person crossed her mind.

"Lord Black Scythe..."

Roarrr!

At the moment the ogre's hand reached for Christine's head.

Kweroooack?!

The ogre's voice sounded strangely. It seemed both perplexed and hoarse.

Continuing to run without stopping, the distance between them widened considerably.

"What's happening? Why isn't it chasing me?"

Unable to resist her curiosity, she turned her head and saw the ogre standing still.

"Why isn't it suddenly pursuing..."

Unable to comprehend, she stared, and then she noticed something glinting around the ogre's neck.

It was a knife.

A small knife pierced through the ogre's neck, protruding from the back.

Thud!

As the ogre crumpled forward, the person who had stabbed the knife from behind was revealed.

"Jeffrey?"

Jeffrey raised a forearm-sized dagger, looking at Christine.
ChatGPT

"Phew... That was close. Anyway, nice to meet you, Christine."

"How did my master...?"

Jeffrey wasn't the nearby player she had initially noticed.

But how did he suddenly close the distance?

"Your master wasn't on the tracking list. How...?"

"He probably used invisibility. If you activate invisibility, it shows 'untraceable' and allows you to escape tracking."

"Oh."

It was a fact she didn't know. Perhaps that's why Black Scythe wasn't tracked.

Christine, now out of danger, breathed a sigh of relief.

"Thank you for helping. I really could have died there."

"Fortunately, I arrived in time."

"Yeah. How did you appear so conveniently... Oh, did you chase me in invisible mode?"

Jeffrey didn't deny it.

"Yes, exactly. I started tracking you in invisible mode as soon as the round began. But I had no idea you'd be in such a crisis."

"Why were you tracking me?"

"Lord Black Scythe instructed me to protect you."

"Lord Black Scythe?"

Surprised by this revelation, Christine's expression brightened.

She didn't expect Black Scythe to care about her.

As Jeffrey casually dealt with the defeated ogre and got up, his expression suddenly changed.

"Christine."

"Yes, I felt it too."

Someone was approaching within the range of their perception.

Initially, she thought it might be another ogre, but judging by the organized approach, it seemed otherwise.

'It's a person.'

Not only that, but when she checked the tracking list, the distance was closing in.

Rustle-

Breaking through the dense forest, another player appeared.

"Oh, found you."

"You were here?"

"Hello, Krissy."

The three suddenly appearing individuals acted as if they knew each other, but Christine had never seen them before.

Well, she recognized the nickname and face of one of them.

It was the person she had intended to find.

"Scholar?"

"Huh? How did you know? In a fantasy world, my nickname shouldn't be visible."

"I recognized your face from the tracking list."

"Ah, I see. Well, then, no need for introductions, I suppose?"
ChatGPT

The player with a smiling face and the nickname "Scholar" spoke.

The player next to him, casually chatting, was named "Balondor."

Christine could sense that the player who stared at her with an inexplicably chilly gaze went by the name "TerrifyingWorld." Therefore, she didn't feel the need to ask for self-introductions.

She simply inquired about the direct purpose of their sudden visit.

"It seems you came looking for me. What brings you here?"

"Don't be too guarded. We didn't come with bad intentions."

Scholar, trying to reassure her with a friendly smile, slowly revealed their purpose.

"We are players who received your help in the last round."

"My help?"

"When things were critical, you provided healing support. Thanks to you, we were able to survive situations where we almost lost our lives multiple times."

Christine tilted her head in response to the mention of her assistance.

These were entirely unfamiliar faces.

"I'm not sure."

"Don't you remember?"

"It's a bit fuzzy. The war theme was chaotic, so..."

"That's a bit disappointing."

As the three of them chimed in, Christine felt embarrassed.

How could she be expected to remember each individual she helped during the wide-ranging healing support in the 18th round?

"So, why did you come?"

"Why did we come? We wanted to repay the favor we received back then."

"Repay the favor?"

"This 19th round is dangerous to navigate alone. There are a lot of monsters around. Thinking that you might be in danger, we ran here together with our comrades."

While their intentions were good, Christine had no immediate intention of accepting help from unfamiliar individuals.

"I appreciate the sentiment, but it's okay."

"You're being quite cold to the people who came to help."

"That's a bit much, seriously."

As the atmosphere suddenly turned accusatory, Christine was slightly taken aback.

"Well, as you can see, there are people helping."

"Who? The person next to you?"

"Looking at the tracking list, it seems to be someone named 'Jeffy.'"

"There you go, Mr. Jeffy."
ChatGPT

Sunbi approached Jeffrey.

"You also received help from Krisi?"

"..."

"What's the relationship between you and Krisi?"

Jeffrey coldly glanced, seemingly expressing a reluctance to engage in conversation with people like them.

"Why so silent?"

"Is he mute?"

Christine became irritated at their remarks.

"Hey, that's too much."

"Is he really mute? Look at her getting all worked up."

"Why is this person staying silent while Krisi is getting upset?"

"Could it be that they have some kind of relationship?"

"Having a bed partner as a saint. This is quite shocking, isn't it?"

As they started making baseless assumptions, Jeffrey could no longer remain silent.

Sshh-

"Wow, look at that. The mute guy pulled out a dagger."

"Darn it, do they want to try us?"

"Put that down, say it nicely."

The atmosphere quickly turned hostile.

Jeffrey might have contributed to the tension, but they were the ones who instigated it.

"Enough, back off."

"Huh? You knew how to speak?"

"We thought you were mute because you were just standing there."

"But why should we back off? You back off."

Even with the combined aggression of the three, Jeffrey remained undeterred.

"What a foul-mouthed guy. Is he a snake?"

"What?"

"This guy spoke so nicely at first, but it seems he can't keep it up."

"This guy's crazy. Pulling a knife on someone you just met."

It was an accurate observation. Pulling out a knife when approached could understandably seem absurd to them.

However, Jeffrey had a duty to protect Christine.

"We can see through why you approached Krisi. Stop bothering us. There won't be any more warnings."

"Alright, we're scared."

"The prince on a white horse surrendered."

"So what? Are you going to face the three of us alone?"

"Hey, it's not just me. Krisi is here too."

"Ah, right."

Even with Christine assisting, the three were not concerned. Having one healer didn't make a significant difference.

Moreover, they felt numerically superior.

"Give it a try."

"Attack first."

Sshh-

As all three drew their knives, Christine was taken aback.
ChatGPT

"Don't, don't fight. Mr. Jeffy, please stop too."

"Krisi, step back. These guys definitely didn't approach us with good intentions. They probably planned to use Krisi and then kill her."

"Us? On what grounds?"

"This is ridiculous. They're treating someone who came to help as a criminal."

"Keep your delusions at home, mister."

It was a perplexing reaction, but Jeffrey believed his thoughts were correct.

At that moment, another player appeared with a rustling sound.

Christine also recognized the face.

"Dorothy?"

As if trying to understand the situation, Dorothy, the Archery Master, rolled her eyes.

"What's going on here? Why is the atmosphere like this?"

"Why is Dorothy here for..."

"Last time, Krisi resurrected me. Grateful for that, I came to help."

The three players who were in a standoff with Jeffrey shouted, realizing that Dorothy was indeed here to assist.

"Look! She's here to help too."

"But why are you telling only us to put away our knives and leave?"

"Is it okay to do this to someone who came to help from a faraway place? Huh?"

Listening to them, there was no flaw in their argument.

It seemed that the whole incident had occurred simply because Jeffrey was in a bad mood and being overly cautious.

As Christine hesitated, trying to speak at that moment, someone unexpected appeared.

"What's going on here?"

With a rustling sound, the Black Scythe himself arrived.
