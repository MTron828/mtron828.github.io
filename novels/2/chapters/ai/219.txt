Title: "Episode 219 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player"

Iron Gray

While others were contemplating their region choices, Russell chose the Albitz Kingdom without hesitation.

"Mister Ryu said, 'Just wait for the Black Scythe in the Albitz Kingdom, no need to do anything else.'"

Although he heard the strategy for the 13th round, the prophet said there was no need to do the quest.

As a blacksmith class, he believed that he could easily raise his reputation by associating with dwarves.

"He said he told the Black Scythe the detailed method. It's a task that requires his help."

So, he is waiting endlessly here.

Even after an hour has passed.

"Well, he wouldn't not come, right?"

Just when he was anxious about not being able to wait any longer, a black object appeared in the sky.

"What is that? Oh!"

Fluttering its wings like a demon, it gracefully landed in front of Russell.

It was none other than the Black Scythe.

"Russell Daniel?"

"W-yes. Are you the Black Scythe?"

Due to the nature of the fantasy world, the nickname was not visible, but he could feel that the opponent was the Black Scythe.

"Yeah. I am the Black Scythe."

"Nice to meet you."

"What's with the formality? The prophet told me about you. Since you two are close, take special care of him."

"The prophet said that?"

As the Black Scythe nodded, Russell was inwardly moved.

"Mr. Ryu would think of me like that... Truly, there's no other saint."

Russell, who thought he should do better when they meet, suddenly remembered Ryu Min's words.

"He told me to prove my worth when meeting the Black Scythe, right?"

Thinking that establishing a closer relationship with the Black Scythe wouldn't hurt, Russell gathered his courage.

"Um, I heard that you can help me grow."

"So he said."

"Without shame, can you help me a bit? I want to grow faster."

"Hmm..."

"In return, I can offer buffs that will help you in hunting! Just give me a moment to get my weapon..."

As Russell approached, signaling that he wanted a weapon, Ryu Min furrowed his brows.

"You want me to hand over my weapon?"
ChatGPT

"Oh, no. There's no need to give it to me. Just let me touch it."

As Russell pushed the scythe forward, he lightly raised his hand, memorizing the skill.

Then, an astonishing message appeared in Ryu Min's view.

[The effect of the skill 'Weapon Sharpening' increases the weapon's attack power by 150%.] [The buff lasts until the end of the current round.]

"The attack power increased like this?"

"Yes, indeed. It surprised me more than I thought."

"Haha, you're still surprised. How about letting me touch the armor this time?"

When Ryu Min nodded in approval, Russell laid his hands on the armor.

Then, an even more surprising message appeared than before.

[The effect of the skill 'Equipment Polishing' increases the options of the armor by 10%.] [The buff lasts until the end of the current round.]

"What? The options increased?"

Ryu Min brought up the information window of the Thanatos's Black Demon Armor he was wearing.

'Defense 2,200, all stats +1.1 per level, 73.7% chance to evade when hit?'

The options had truly improved by 10%.

"The options increased, right? You can apply buffs like this to all parts. Oh, except for weapons and accessories."

"Really?"

"Since we're talking about it, let me do it. Come here."

When buffs were applied to the helmet, gloves, and shoes, the options improved by 10%.

Although not a significant figure, it had meaning in being able to enhance options.

'For options with probabilities like the ones in the Black Demon Armor, if done well, it could be close to 100%, right?'

Russell didn't know that a blacksmith had such a skill.

Seeing Russell's satisfied expression, Ryu Min smiled with a proud face.

"Surprised? I didn't think the equipment polishing skill I learned at level 60 would be this efficient."

"Repair, weapon sharpening, equipment polishing... What other skills do you have left?"

"Oh, there's a skill called material crafting, but it's not a buff skill, and it's not that great. It's literally a skill to gather junk items and make higher-tier materials."

Ryu Min nodded in agreement.
ChatGPT

Materials, I don't need them since I can buy them with money.

But Russell might need them.

'Well, just by sharpening weapons and polishing equipment, it's already a job that can be very helpful.'

"How is it? Was it helpful?"

"More than enough."

Seeing Ryu Min's satisfied expression, Russell silently celebrated his success.

With this, he had clearly demonstrated his worth.

"Good. I'll help you grow even more."

"Thank you. Um, by the way, where are you going..."

"According to the prophet, I need to go to a place called Karugago Mountains. I have to find the Dwarven city there."

"Do you know the way?"

"I do. I have some friendship with the Dwarves."

Smirking, Ryu Min changed his title to 'Leading One.'

When characters appeared above his head, Russell widened his eyes.

"What is that above your head?"

"You've never seen it before, huh? It's a title. It comes with various effects. The prophet said it will appear when you have a close relationship with the Dwarves."

"Oh, I see."

"We don't have time to waste, let's go."

"Um..."

When Russell tried to speak again, Ryu Min's response wasn't as polite.

"Why again?"

"Uh, are you going to fly like earlier? I-I have acrophobia..."

"Don't worry. I plan to walk. The Dwarven city is underground."

Near the Albitz Kingdom lies the Karugago Mountains.

And beneath that, there was the Dwarven city known to all knowledgeable people, Iron Gray.

Clang-clang!

The sound of metalworking echoed from various places.

"Wow... This is the Dwarven city..."

"Close your mouth. You're staring strangely."

Russell, fascinated, looked around, while the Dwarves glared at him with a stern expression.

Although the Dwarves were already having active interactions with humans, humans were still outsiders.

They didn't welcome the sight of humans gawking at their city like it's a zoo.

Whether Russell was aware of this or not, he nonchalantly observed the Dwarves' work with a curious gaze.

'Well, more than fascinating, it's like a gaze filled with passion?'

Was it the joy of meeting comrades who practiced the same alchemy?
ChatGPT

The enthusiasm is visibly radiating from Russell's entire body.

"Look at that. Hammering is an art. There's no slightest shake at a consistent angle. Wow, look at that person's hand skills. Dealing with iron is no joke. Making sheets to attach to armor. How can someone with such small and thick hands have such hand skills... Oh, are all the works displayed behind him his own creations? I want to touch them once..."

"Russell, snap out of it and come this way."

"Oh, sorry. Haha..."

Leading Russell, who was lost in thought like a cat in front of a fish store, they headed towards the largest forge in Iron Gray, the "Hammer Pole."

"Here. Go inside."

"Ah, well, wait a moment. What appeared before my eyes..."

Looking at Russell, his gaze was directed towards the empty space.

It seemed like a sub-quest had appeared.

"There's a quest to work as an assistant in Hammer Pole for three hours?"

"And the reward?"

"It says your relationship with the Dwarves will become very friendly, and your skills will improve overall by one level. However, it seems this quest is exclusive to the blacksmith profession."

Completing just one quest could pass the round and upgrade skills.

"There's no better sub-quest than this. Only Russell can do it, though."

Even though he had to work for three hours, it was relatively short compared to other players.

"Other players will take at least six hours for reputation work."

In that aspect, Russell securing the second place in the round ranking was almost certain.

"As long as the assumption is that you need to get a job."

Simply stating that you want to work as an assistant in the forge would be pointless.

Who would entrust work to a human who suddenly showed up with no connection?

It would be fortunate if he wasn't kicked out without a second thought.

"But there's nothing to worry about. I'm here."

Opening the forge door, Ryu Min gestured for Russell to come in.

"Wow..."

Russell, looking at the enormous forge that couldn't be seen at a glance, couldn't help but marvel continuously.

At that moment, a young-looking Dwarf approached and asked with a sharp gaze, "What brings humans here?"

But that was just for a moment.
ChatGPT

The Dwarf who was giving Ryu Min a glance soon wore a surprised expression.

"Oh? Ah, the Leading One, isn't it?"

Ryu Min nodded his head.

The Dwarf, who pretended not to know, was no longer surprising.

He just felt the greatness of the reputation system once again.

"I've come to meet the blacksmith Haimer of Hammer Pole."

"Haimer? Well, please wait a moment."

An energetic young Dwarf quickly ran off and soon returned with a bearded Dwarf.

It was the blacksmith Haimer, who Ryu Min had encountered in Round 8.

"Oh, the Leading One is visiting our Iron Gray! I've been wanting to see you!"

Whether it was due to the 'Very Friendly' reputation, Haimer warmly welcomed Ryu Min.

"This isn't the right way; let me guide you to a quieter place. It's too noisy here."

"Sure."

Following Haimer to a relatively quiet lounge, Ryu Min introduced Russell.

"Let me introduce you. This is my cherished acquaintance, Russell Daniel."

Russell, slightly embarrassed by being called "cherished," quickly responded.

"Uh, nice to meet you. Please call me Russell."

They nodded to each other since there was no point in shaking hands due to the height difference.

"Nice to meet you. By the way, Leading One. What brings you to our city?"

"I was just about to talk about that. Could you please hire this friend here?"

"Hire him?"

"Just for today. He wants to work as an assistant to learn the best Dwarven blacksmithing skills. Despite appearances, he has some experience in alchemy."

Upon hearing the term "alchemy," Haimer's gaze fixed on Russell.

"Have you tried blacksmithing?"

"Yes, I've only had about six years of experience, but I can handle basic tasks."

"What kind of items have you made?"

"Um, various things. Longswords, daggers, bracelets, armor, chairs, and more. Would it be accurate to say I've made almost everything?"

"Ho ho? That's enough to surpass an intermediate level, right?"

Haimer looked at Russell with astonishment.

Seeing that his thoughts were understood, Ryu Min seemed pleased.

"The interview seems to be successful."

With this, there seemed to be no need to worry about getting a job.
ChatGPT

Sure enough.

"All right. Since the Leading One introduced this person, we'll hire him temporarily for today."

"T-Thank you!"

"However, it's getting late, so we can only offer a 3-hour shift. Is that okay?"

"Yes, of course!"

Russell was excited like a studious student, and Haimer didn't mind that reaction. Rather, he seemed eager to take him away as soon as possible.

"Would you like to start working right away?"

"Yes, yes!"

"What about the Leading One?"

"I'm done with my business, so I'll leave now."

Upon hearing this, Russell quickly approached and bowed Korean-style.

"Thank you for your help. If it weren't for the Black Scythe, I wouldn't have had this opportunity."

Without Ryu Min's introduction, this quest would have been impossible.

"I'll definitely repay the favor. Really."

"I'll remember those words."

Since he owed a debt, Russell would now treat the Black Scythe with kindness.

"Oh, by the way, before you go, there's something to discuss with Haimer."

"Me? What do you need?"

"I heard that special materials are sold here in Iron Gray."

"What kind of materials are you talking about?"

Ryu Min listed the items needed for the recent grade combination, one by one, to Haimer.

As Haimer heard about the materials, his expression changed rapidly.

"Ahem, where on earth did you hear such rumors?"

"I have connections here and there. Do you have those materials?"

"Yes, we do have them, but..."

"Can you hand them over to me?"

Haimer, always friendly, looked puzzled for the first time.

"Well, those are quite valuable materials we obtained with difficulty, so we can't just give them away..."

"I didn't ask for them for free. Let's make a purchase."

"These are quite expensive materials..."

"Don't worry."

Ryu Min smiled subtly.

"As for gold, I have more than enough in my storage."
