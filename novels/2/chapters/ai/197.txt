Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 197"

Episode 197, Round 12 begins.

As the end of each month approaches, players become more sensitive.

The moment they cross over to the other world, their physical bodies become defenseless.

There is no place to protect oneself from the symptoms other than a well-secured home.

It was now December 1st, with 30 minutes left until midnight.

"Why not hire a regular bodyguard?" suggested the junior, Jang Chen, after listening to the explanation.

Upon hearing this, he immediately received a slap on the back of his head from his senior when he grimaced.

"Hey, you idiot. Do you think players who only trust themselves would hire someone else? What if they get betrayed like now, what would they do?"

"Come on, do you think a bodyguard would target a sleeping player? Killing doesn't bring in money, you know."

When the senior raised his hand again, Jang Chen flinched.

"This idiot thinks money is everything. Another player who hired a hitman will pay."

"Now, are bodyguards being used for contract killings too?"

"Yeah, man. In times like this, you can't trust anyone, you know? Anyway, this guy is too trusting of people, that's the problem."

"Hehe...."

Jang Chen chuckled foolishly, rubbing the back of his head.

"Now I understand. That guy Black Scythe doesn't have bodyguards for a reason."

"Yeah. No matter how strong you are, if someone slices your throat while you're asleep, you're on the road to the afterlife. Why would you want someone next to you in that case?"

"But isn't that villa too vulnerable? It looks old, making it easy to break into, right?"

"All players live in well-secured homes. They probably think such places are safer."

"Well, there's some logic to that. As expected, senior, your insight is remarkable."

"Don't flatter me. Will flattering make me like you?"

Although the senior responded harshly, the corners of his mouth were already forming a smile.

He was a rough senior, but his smirk made him seem endearing.

"By the way, how long do we have to wait? We've been waiting for an hour."

"Ah, damn it. Why do you complain so much? Quit your nonsense and wait, damn it."

Title: "Cuteness is Cancelled"

The word "cute" is canceled.

When behaving without thinking, the hands automatically reach for the back of the head.

After speaking, the senior turned to look at the black society juniors who were crouched down, including himself and a total of five people.

There were enough members to launch a surprise attack, and one could even consider it a large number.

Snatching a person by the collar would have been sufficient with just one.

"Just wait a bit. There are still 25 minutes left until midnight."

"My legs are numb, but I'll endure. They promised a hefty bonus after this is done..."

"Don't worry, kids. Our boss always takes care of things like that."

They chuckled and patiently waited for midnight.

And as time passed, the moment arrived.

"Oh? The lights went out."

The lights in the villa that had been on all this time went out.

Looking at the time, it was 5 minutes before midnight.

"The target seems to be getting ready to go to the other world."

Of course, they knew the exact location of the room with Black Scythe.

They had already received information from Yang Chwiwon and confirmed it with their own eyes.

The sight of Black Scythe opening and closing the window.

"Shall we move now?"

"Do you want to die? The boss said to move exactly at midnight."

"Exactly at midnight?"

"Yeah. The time when the symptoms of sleep paralysis kick in is like a blade. Even if we move then, it won't be too late. No need to move cautiously. Even if a bomb goes off right next to him, that guy won't wake up."

"I see."

Jang Chen, who was squinting, looked at the time.

Tick-tock-tick!

It was exactly midnight.

"Alright. Let's move..."

The senior, who was about to initiate the operation, lost his words in an instant.

Thunk-thunk-

Jang Chen was blocking the mouths of his colleagues while thrusting a knife into their throats.

Squelch-squelch-

"You, you piece of...!"

Seeing the falling juniors, the senior tried to respond immediately, but Jang Chen's swift actions were faster.

Thunk-!

"Cough!"

Thunk-thunk-thunk-thunk!

The senior, who had taken dozens of knife stabs to the abdomen, looked at Jang Chen with unbelieving eyes.

It seemed as if he was asking how he could betray them like this.

"No need to look like that. I have a separate owner, you know."

Title: "Staring Down the Death with Soulless Eyes"

Jang Chen, with soulless eyes, looked up at the senior's death.

Four bodies, excluding himself, were covered in blood.

"Now, shall we go back?"

The slaughter was not yet over. Another mission remained.

Jang Chen glanced at the villa and turned in the opposite direction.

Upon opening his eyes, Ryumin immediately recognized the colorless space.

The 12th round had begun.

And after a few minutes, he realized that his body was still intact.

Jang Chen had successfully killed his comrades as planned.

"The power of Yantti is truly versatile."

Thwarting Yang Chwiwon's plan was not difficult. Taking control of one of the Black Society members in Korea, making them betray the organization on the day of the operation, was enough.

"I had to reveal my presence in the villa to prove I was there."

Indeed, Ryumin actually stayed in the villa until the last moment to make it convincing.

He had even told his younger brother that he would be out for a week.

"Maybe that's why there was a misunderstanding about having a girlfriend, but it doesn't matter. As long as I can protect Wonii."

To prevent any harm to his younger brother, he left his real home untouched and pretended that the villa was his residence.

He might visit later for revenge against Black Scythe, but it wouldn't matter since it was the villa where the Lost Yak resided.

"But the instructions to Jang Chen were not just that."

By now, the guy who killed his comrades was probably on his way back to China.

To carry out Yantti's order to assassinate all Black Society members.

"Since they're on the same side, assassinating them shouldn't be difficult. Most of the organization members will probably end up dead."

After the round ends, Yang Chwiwon will realize it.

That he was backstabbed.

And it will be quite a shock, especially considering the severity of the betrayal.

"Why poke a sleeping lion?"

Ryumin's mouth curled up into a smirk.

Now that Yang Chwiwon's plan failed, he had no choice but to follow Ryumin's proposed Swingman's plan.
ChatGPT

Title: "Perhaps John Delgado Has Noticed by Now, that Yang Chwiwon's Operation Has Failed"

He might have searched for the name Black Scythe to track and realized that he is alive.

"Even if he doesn't know, by now, he must be sighing in relief. He'll have to apologize to the detested Black Scythe."

Following Swingman's plan, John must find Black Scythe.

"The question is, will John Delgado swallow his pride and come to find me?"

The probability of that happening was low, but Ryumin decided to wait and see.

After clenching his fists for a few minutes, someone else showed up.

"Lord Black Scythe!"

An irreplaceable ally, Minjuri.

"Long time no see, nice to see you!"

"Can you say it's a long time after only two months?"

"Isn't that the only thing I can say? I thought it had been a few years."

Minjuri had last seen Black Scythe during the 10th round.

Due to Ryumin's prophecy not to meet Black Scythe in the 11th round, they hadn't met.

"If we have a party this time, will you include me too? My buffs can be helpful, you know."

"A party? It seems like you're already aware of the mission for this round."

"Th-that's not it. If there happens to be a mission involving a party, then you should include me. Haha..."

Minjuri, trying to hide her embarrassment at her own joke, appeared quite cute.

"As Minjuri said, this round is a cooperative quest. We need to form parties of five."

Ryumin had already thought about who to include in his party.

"Of course, Minjuri will be included."

Although Minjuri had mentioned it due to Ryumin's prophecy, he pretended not to know.

"If we happen to form a team, I'll include you in the party. Buffers are useful."

"Really? Thank you! Anytime, just let me know. I'll boost those buffs for you!"

"Thank you."

At that moment, another group approached Black Scythe.

It wasn't John Delgado as expected.

It was Seo Arin, Ma Kyung-rok, and Ahn Sang-cheol.

"Hello, Lord Black Scythe."

"...."

"...."

While Seo Arin greeted brightly, Ma Kyung-rok and Ahn Sang-cheol couldn't manage the same enthusiasm.

They hadn't gained any points in the last round because of Black Scythe.

Strictly speaking, it wasn't Black Scythe's fault, but that's how it turned out.

"Hello, Lady of Democracy."
ChatGPT

Title: "Greetings and Hidden Intentions"

"Hello, Seo Arin, Ahn Sang-cheol, and Cheonma."

They exchanged greetings as colleagues, but Ma Kyung-rok's gaze towards Minjuri was different.

"That guy... he's coveting Minjuri."

It was inevitable. After receiving buffs several times, he must have realized how helpful a buffer can be.

"I've felt it for a while. The three of you are always together, right?"

Minjuri asked, and Seo Arin replied, "Oh, we're from the same agency."

"So, have you been together since Round 1?"

"Something like that."

However, Seo Arin and Ahn Sang-cheol didn't know that Seo Arin was subtly keeping her distance.

They were only focused on intercepting Minjuri from Black Scythe.

"Minjuju, where do you live?"

At Ma Kyung-rok's sudden question, Minjuri hesitated before answering, "Seoul."

"Oh, really? Where in Seoul?"

"Yeonhui-dong."

"Oh, if it's Yeonhui-dong, it's close. I live in Gangnam. How about we meet sometime? I'll introduce you to our company and agency."

"A company?"

"Perhaps you've heard of Pl-Pl Market. I'm the CEO there."

"What? Oh."

Minjuri's surprised expression made Ma Kyung-rok look puzzled.

"Why? Don't you know?"

"No, I know. I've heard of it and even visited a few times."

Although Minjuri calmly spoke, her surprised expression was for a different reason.

She knew that Ryu Min was one of the joint owners of Pl-Pl Market.

"Then why have you only been observing and haven't used it?"

"Well..."

"Why? You can easily secure cash through transactions. You can also find desired items, and lately, we're considering introducing a point trading system, not to mention gold transactions."

"Oh, I see. But I don't have anything I want to buy or sell, so..."

Minjuri truthfully spoke, but the real reason was because of Ryu Min's previous warning.

"Even if you've only observed, why not give it a try?"

"Well..."

"Why? You can trade and get some cash. Or you can get the items you want. Besides, we're even thinking about adding a point trading system recently."

"Oh, I see. But I don't have anything I want to buy or sell, so..."

Minjuri's calm response concealed the fact that she was aware of Ryu Min's advice not to join Pl-Pl Market.

'Does this person work with Min?'

Understanding Minjuri's identity as Cheonma, she remained silent.

She didn't want to give away any information about Ryu Min by engaging in unnecessary conversation.

Title: "Unfortunate Choices in Pl-Pl Market"

For reasons unknown, he had kept his promise so far.

Because of that, Ma Kyung-rok could only feel regretful.

"Darn it, if she had joined Pl-Pl Market, I could have easily looked up the members living in Yeonhui-dong."

That way, he could easily find Minjuri's real address.

While Ma Kyung-rok was looking at Minjuri with regret, an angel appeared.

"Hello, everyone! Welcome to Round 12. First, let's do a headcount."

The angel manipulated the air with fingers and made a sound.

"The survivors are now 39,402, a decrease of 619. But what do we do about this? This round is a quest where teams of 5 must be formed. Unfortunately, dividing by 5 leaves us with 2 remaining, so... Well, I've been contemplating, but I already know."

Ryumin knew it was all calculated actions.

How to handle the remaining 2 had already been decided.

"Well, there's nothing we can do. Let's quickly form teams of 5, and the remaining 2 will be automatically eliminated."

"What?"

"Th-that's not fair!"

"If forming teams quickly is also a skill, then it's a skill. It can't be helped."

Although the angel said so, it was probably truly unavoidable.

Players who couldn't form a team from the beginning were set to be eliminated by the system.

"To avoid being among the unfortunate 2, let's form teams quickly. Now, since you all must be curious, shall we take a look at the Round 12 quest?"

After a moment, a quest window appeared in front of everyone.
