Title: Episode 181 of the 100th Rebirth of a Max Level Player

Douglas

"What's going on?"

Ma Kyung-rok unintentionally exclaimed in surprise.

It was because something strange was happening.

'Dark Ora doesn't... eat?'

The Dark Ora that attacked Hwang Yong-min strangely didn't adhere to his skin. No, it seemed impossible to stick to him. It kept its distance as if blocked by an invisible barrier.

'What on earth is this? Does it have immunity against Dark Ora?'

No matter how much he commanded, the Ora couldn't envelop Hwang Yong-min. It couldn't drain his life force. Instead, it staggered back every time Hwang Yong-min took a step.

From Ma Kyung-rok's perspective, it was nothing short of bewildering. This was the first time he had seen a target that Dark Ora couldn't consume.

'Maybe because it's an undead without life?'

He thought that it could be possible if the target was already dead.

"Darn it, a target that Dark Ora can't consume."

Ma Kyung-rok's face was filled with embarrassment. With the reversal strategy blocked, the situation looked grim.

In an instant, the distance seemed to narrow, as if space itself had leaped.

"Whoa!"

Hwang Yong-min, who had approached without Ma Kyung-rok realizing, thrust out a straight punch.

Crack!

The moment Ma Kyung-rok was hit on the jaw, he tumbled about ten meters, unconscious.

"Mr. President!"

An Sang-cheol, whose protection was released, quickly drew his sword.

Ping!

Hwang Yong-min effortlessly deflected the attack with the palm of his hand and knocked An Sang-cheol unconscious with a blow to the jaw.

"Phew."

Ryu Min, who had amicably incapacitated both of them, casually brushed off his hands.

"It was tough adjusting my strength."

In one minute, he subdued both of them.

It was much more challenging than killing. 'I thought of absorbing life force with Dark Ora, but that's out of the question. After all, Reapers are a higher class than Dark Knights.'

Just like light being weak against darkness, there are also advantages and disadvantages between player professions. Certain skills can be entirely ineffective against specific professions.

Just like now.

'Dark Knights and Reapers seem to deal with the same darkness, but in reality, they are different types. Could we say that Reapers are a higher concept of darkness?'

"The saying that even the same darkness has different grades."

The reason why Dark Ora couldn't touch Ryu Min was here.

"You can come out now."

As Ryu Min signaled by tapping his head, Ju Sung-tak, who had been hiding in the forest, appeared.

"Is it over, master?"

"Yeah. These guys should be unconscious for at least half a day."

"Wouldn't it be better to just kill them?"

Ryu Min glared at Ju Sung-tak for a moment in response to his statement.

"If that were the case, I would have killed or knocked them out earlier, wouldn't I?"

"Forgive me. I spoke out of turn."

"They are the ones who were willing to kill innocent people just for points. They deserve to die. But they still have value to be kept alive, even if it's just to gain Kristin's cooperation."

Even if Kristin claims to have no feelings for Ma Kyung-rok, his sudden death would have a significant psychological impact.

'If her feelings for Ma Kyung-rok have completely faded, that's a different story.'

For now, killing Ma Kyung-rok is not part of the plan. He was a valuable card since he was closely related to the main force, the Priest, and An Sang-cheol had to be taken along with him as part of the set.

"For now, tie them to the trees. Use the tree branches that look pale and tough. It's a sturdy wood that even most players can't easily break free from."

"I understand."

Following the orders, Ju Sung-tak tied the two unconscious individuals to the trees.

'Even delaying them for this much time will take a while for them to escape from the labyrinth.'

If done well, the round could end without them earning any points for 24 hours.

'Even if it's a team battle, they won't be eliminated.'

Ryu Min was confident that he could keep the Korean team alive in this game.

There was still a last-minute reversal left, and he also had the Thousand Miles skill for that.

'As long as the plan goes as intended, there's no way I can lose. I've secured the first place in the entire area, after all.'

Now, everything in the forest of the labyrinth was done.

There would be no need for Ma Kyung-rok to kill 1,000 people as planned, nor would he receive the title of Massacre.

'I've prevented one tragedy. But there's another one to prevent.'

He looked at Kristin through Thousand Miles.

Most of the Despair Sect forces had gathered.

Like the calm before the storm, there were signs that something could happen soon.

'I need to hurry. If I leave Kristin alone, she might end up dead.'

Ryu Min urged Ju Sung-tak to walk faster, leaving Ma Kyung-rok and An Sang-cheol alone in the labyrinth's forest.

Douglas counted the heads of the bustling crowd.

'There are a total of 101 members... Everyone has gathered.'

They were all followers who had come seeking the only saint and priestess.

'In reality, they're just bastards trying to cozy up to the saint and take advantage.'

While blaming his comrades, Douglas maintained a smile outwardly.

Since the second round, Paladins, who had been favored by the saint, could not afford to leave an impression.

'I shouldn't reveal my true colors until the saint is dead. Hmm.'

Douglas doesn't know the reason for wanting to kill Chrisy in the Despair Sect.

However, Douglas abandoned the saint and switched to the Despair Sect for no other reason.

The reason for choosing betrayal is nothing more than the greater benefits of the Despair Sect.

'Because the Despair Sect offers more benefits.'

In fact, most of the people here are more attached to Chrisy for survival than free assistance.

'Naturally, the survival rate increases when you travel with a priest.'

Just looking at the priest's basic skill, Heal, proves that.

Heal is a miraculous skill that heals all but the most severe injuries.

Moreover, with the buff called 'Blessing of the Saint,' it increases resistance to status abnormalities and debuffs by 50%.

Priests, especially after reaching level 40, can use wide-area heal over time.

'It's truly a profession optimized for saving people.'

Of course, there must be some personal gain for himself in helping people, but no one disliked receiving free healing.

That's why around 100 beggars gathered around the saint.

'But I hate it. It's true that the survival rate increases when you're with Chrisy. But that's all. There's no internal growth.'

Priest skills are mainly focused on endurance.

Just enduring won't allow you to conquer up to Round 20.

As the saying goes, the best defense is a good offense; becoming stronger and growing more than now increases the chances of survival in the future.

Realizing this fact early on, Douglas decided to betray Chrisy.

Unlike Chrisy, the Despair Sect was an organization focused on growth.

'In the Despair Sect, they provide a lot of items, including potions, to aid in various aspects of growth. After this incident, we plan to divide and share the items we obtained through plunder.'

But what about the followers of the saint?

They simply look to the saint, healing only to survive, without making any effort for personal growth.

They just endure each day.

'So they will collapse sooner or later. They've held up well so far, but how long will luck be on their side?'

It's better to cut ties early if that's the case.

Switching to a religion with a higher chance of survival is much more hopeful and wise.

However, that alone couldn't move Douglas's heart.

The true reason he betrayed was not items or the promise from the Despair Sect.

It was a promise he made in the Despair Sect.

'To let me play with her before killing Chrisy.'

Douglas, with a sly smile, looked at Chrisy.

A beautiful flower shining elegantly alone.

He was curious about the pleasure of breaking that flower.

'I've wanted it many times. You, as a woman.'

He had harbored dark thoughts while being by her side, but the opportunity never arose.

She seemed to have no interest in men at all.

That made him more drawn to her.

People are more attracted to a new product than a used one, especially a luxury item that no one has had.

'Love? Loyalty? I don't need those. Pleasure is the most important.'

That's why, in this situation, whether Chrisy lives or dies doesn't matter.

As long as he can satisfy his lust.

At that moment, Berber appeared in Douglas's sight, gesturing for him to come over.

"Berber, sir. Did you call me?"

Berber, a spy infiltrated by the Despair Sect to monitor the saint.

He was also the one who led Douglas into the Despair Sect.

He was the only ally among the 101 people here.

"I received a message from the brothers a while ago. The preparations are complete."

"Have all the members gathered?"
ChatGPT

"Yes. About 200 brothers are waiting just 500 meters away. We can strike right now."

"Ah, finally..."

The preparations were complete.

Preparations to sweep away the beggar-like followers here and kidnap Chrisy.

"Will you give me a chance as promised?"

"A chance?"

"That... You know, hehe."

"Oh, that? No need to say more. Recognizing your guts for betraying from within, the Lord has granted a special 30 minutes."

"Oh, 30 minutes each... Hehe, thank you!"

That should be enough time to enjoy.

"Now, what should I do?"

"I will go get the brothers right away. Meanwhile, divert Chrisy's attention. Use any detection skills or keep talking to prevent her from noticing. If things go south, suppress her immediately."

"I will do that."

The Paladin, referred to as the knight of the saint, showed a sly smile.

Kristin admired the gathered people.

'So many people trust and rely on me.'

In just one hour of waiting, over a hundred followers had gathered.

This should provide a sense of security against any surprise attacks.

It was as if a thick human shield had been formed.

"Everyone?"

The murmurs subsided at Kristin's words.

Soon, a silence so profound that even swallowing could be heard filled the air.

"Thank you all so much for believing in me and coming without me asking. I feel there is only one thing I can do for all of you."

Taking a momentary pause, Kristin opened her mouth with a gaze filled with a sense of duty.

"I can protect you until the end and go with you. That's the only way I can repay you. Let's survive together until Round 20."

"Wow!!!"

"Chrisy! Chrisy!"

Players cheered, raising their fists towards the sky.

They seemed like loyal believers, yet also reminiscent of fanatics.

Clap, clap, clap—

Watching, Douglas approached, clapping his hands.

"Chrisy, you are truly amazing. Every word you say is elegant and trustworthy."
ChatGPT

"That's not true. I'm just an ordinary woman in her twenties. It's thanks to all of you being kind to me."

"How can protecting people be considered ordinary? The fact that many people believe and follow Chrisy is all thanks to Chrisy's virtue."

"Thank you for saying that. Having a good person like Paladin-nim by my side is also thanks to virtue."

Douglas smiled as he faced Chrisy, who was smiling brightly.

'She's truly a woman worth regretting. It's too wasteful to just kill her like this.'

He had reached the point where he wanted to keep her as a target for his desires after keeping her imprisoned for a lifetime.

Does Chrisy know about such feelings?

'Hehe, I really look forward to the expression when she's under me, wailing.'

Douglas, who had swallowed dry saliva, spoke to Chrisy as planned.

"Now that everyone is here, shall we go for the quest?"

"Yes. Since time has been delayed a bit, we should gather points as soon as possible, right?"

"Is there a quest that requires such a large number of participants?"

"I don't know, but it's better to move together for now. We've always done that, right?"

"That's right. But before we act, it might be good to plan the strategy first. I have a strategy in mind; would you like to hear it?"

Douglas, who had prepared words in advance to attract attention, spoke.

Although they were words to divert attention, Chrisy felt rather puzzled.

'Paladin-nim, who usually speaks less, why is he suddenly so talkative today?'

Despite mentioning a strategy, it didn't really register with her.

It was because he was unnecessarily verbose and forced.

'Something's strange. A person who suddenly does something they don't usually do...'

Douglas had been with Chrisy since Round 2.

She knew his personality well.

'Something's strange. Really strange.'

Perhaps due to receiving a prophecy, her vigilance against surprises was extremely heightened.

That's why Chrisy habitually checked her detection skill around her.

Even now.

"Huh?"

By chance, when she activated the skill, she saw numerous red dots.

For a moment, Douglas's expression stiffened, but Chrisy didn't see it.
ChatGPT

The attention was drawn to the red dots approaching precisely in this direction.

"Look at this! Why are people coming this way... Ugh!"

Chrisy couldn't even scream. It was because Douglas's sinister hand grabbed her and pulled her away.
