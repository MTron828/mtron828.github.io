Title: "Episode 331 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player"

I will tell you.

[Ka, about Chaos?]

"What are his weaknesses, and is there a force opposing him?"

[Well, Chaos has no weaknesses.]

"Lies."

[No, really. Does the primal god have weaknesses?]

"Any force harboring resentment against Chaos? If there's a target seeking revenge, with your abilities, you should know something about it, right?"

[Th-that's...]
Nemesis hesitated to speak. It wasn't due to a lack of loyalty to Chaos. He followed him out of fear that he might be eradicated rather than out of loyalty.

Even so, he hesitated to answer because he didn't know how to put it into words.

[There are many who dislike Chaos. So many that it's hard to figure out where to start...]

"Is that so?"

Ryumin, feeling incredulous, changed the question.

"Then who are the beings loyal to Chaos? Who stands by him?"

[I can tell you that. Nix, Moros, Erebus, Ether...]
Nemesis listed names like sausages, one after another, except for one.

"Why did you leave one person out?"

[Huh? Who are you talking about?]

"You."

Nemesis's body trembled.

Then, he awkwardly chuckled.

[You're talking nonsense. If I were loyal, I wouldn't spill everything like this... huh?]

At the sound that dropped, he lowered his head to see his arm rolling on the ground.

Dripping with crimson blood.

[Ah, aaah!]

He screamed in pain, realizing too late, but seeing the scythe around his neck, he had no choice but to close his mouth like a crushed bug.

"Don't move. Next time, it's your throat."

[Wh-why are you doing this to me? Am I not cooperating as much as possible?]

"Just because of that doesn't change the fact that you're Chaos's lackey."

[Ah, I see. You know the reason why you want revenge on me.]

Nemesis instantly understood Ryumin's feelings with his ability.esponse do you prefer?

"If he deems it a betrayal from a blow to the back of the head, he's the kind of person who will kill without hesitation.

'Even if Chaos saves me, it's a problem.'

If Chaos rescues him, it would be to interrogate and punish him. Bringing the black scythe was a good move, but revealing Chaos's location is problematic enough.

In that case, escaping punishment is impossible.

'Whether it's punishment or death, he'll kill me right away. Ruthless Chaos won't spare a traitor.'

Above all, Nemesis doesn't even know where Chaos is.

He could contact other gods to find out, but secretly taking him along with the black scythe is almost impossible.

'In the end, there's only one way. Open the door to the Akashic Records and slip in alone.'

Opening the door to the Akashic Records won't be possible for someone without the qualifications. If an unregistered being tries to enter, they'll bounce off the door.

"Hehe, then I can remove the black scythe and safely take refuge inside."

Nemesis smiled cunningly, but she didn't know.

She didn't know that Ryumin behind her was reading her thoughts one by one.

"Here, human."

In front of her eyes was an endlessly high door.

"This is the Akashic Records, also known as the library of information. I'll open the door, so hurry up and come in...."

"Wait."

Ryumin blocked Nemesis, who was about to go ahead, with his scythe.

"You think you can just remove me and go in alone?"

"Huh? W-what are you talking about?"

"You knew that I, without the qualifications, couldn't enter, so you were planning to go in alone, right? Isn't that so?"

Nemesis's pupils shook as she was struck at the core.

It felt like her heart suddenly dropped.

'Damn, how did he find out?'

The plan was exposed right in front of the door.

'Ah, darn! It's within reach if I just stretch my hand...'

Watching quietly, Nemesis, who seemed to have made up her mind, swung the scythe aside and reached towards the door.

Or rather, she tried to.

Shkak-

The scythe drawn in a diagonal line sliced through Nemesis's body.

Ryumin, calmly watching the falling chunks of flesh, raised his head.

Then, he couldn't help but be surprised.

[Experience Points +1,500,000,000] [Acquired experience points have exceeded 100,000.] [Experience points are exchanged for 15,000 stat points.]

'Experience points... 1.5 billion?'

Before he could calm his astonished mind, countless messages covered his field of vision.

[You have leveled up!] [You have leveled up!] [You have leveled up!]

............

............

[You have achieved level 120!] [From now on, the amount of stats gained per level up will increase by 5!]

............

............

[You have achieved level 130!] [From now on, the amount of stats gained per level up will increase by 6!]

............

............

The amount of stats gained per level up increased every 10 levels.

'How much did I level up?'

After the notifications ended, Ryumin, who opened his status window, couldn't help but be amazed.

He had actually risen to level 126.

'From level 111, it instantly became 237.'

The received stat points also amounted to 16,248.

'I got so much experience by defeating a god.'

Originally, experience points wouldn't increase when facing gods, but thanks to the transcendent rune, he could extract experience from all enemies.

The good news didn't end there.

[Soul Gauntlet absorbs the soul of the slain deity.] [Soul 'Nemesis' has been stored in the gauntlet.] [Extracting the abilities of the soul 'Nemesis.'] [Extraction successful!] [Learned new temporary skill 'Vengeance!'] [Temporary Skill - Vengeance!]

-Effect: Damage against the target for revenge is increased by 2 times.

Additionally, you can locate other targets with a vengeance.

Just as he obtained the qualification of a demon from Phlunictos, he could extract the skill of vengeance from Nemesis.

└Kill the God

└Current number of deities killed (2/4)

└Upon success ▶ ????

'Now I just need to kill two more?'

He erased all traces as Nemesis's corpse might be discovered by someone.

He tested if it worked on deities, and indeed, it did.

'Should I go in now?'

Ryumin, standing in front of the door, exerted strength and opened the door to the Akashic Records.

Kururung-

As the massive door opened, an expansive interior like the universe unfolded before him.

Without seeing anything in that place, Ryumin stepped inside.
ChatGPT

Then, contrary to Nemesis's expectation that he would be bounced back,

[Checking eligibility for entry into the Akashic Records.] [User holding an Akashic Records entry pass.] [Entry has been approved.]

Ryumin's body was sucked into the cosmic space.

The library of dimensional information, the Akashic Records.

Inside, it was more like a library than the universe.

Endless volumes rose sky-high in an infinite space where the end was not visible.

There, a ghost-like entity existed.

"Welcome, Lord of the Black Scythe."

"Do you know me?"

"Allow me to introduce myself first. I am Lubahi, the librarian of the Akashic Records."

Ryumin scrutinized him quietly.

Then, the eyes of insight revealed information.

[Lubahi]

└ Species: Deity

└ Alignment: Good

└ Position: Librarian

└ Notable: Sentient being guarding the Akashic Records. Absolute within the space of the Akashic Records.

└ Weakness: Cannot leave the Akashic Records.

'Alignment is good?'

Ryumin judged that the alignment mentioned by the eyes of insight was relative.

Because the alignment of opponents he faced so far always came out as evil.

'Does that mean this ghostly guy is favorable to me?'

Ryumin's animosity toward Lubahi somewhat softened.

However, he did not let down his guard.

Since he couldn't read the guy's thoughts.

"How did you know my name?"

"If the librarian of a library that can know all information in the universe doesn't know that much, should I throw it away?"

"How much do you know about me?"

"I know a lot. More than you think."

"...."

As if finding it hard to believe, Ryumin just stared at Lubahi, who raised a finger.

A thick book descended from the sky and settled into Ryumin's hands.

"Please read it once. It's a book that encapsulates your life."

Ryumin silently began to read the book.

Externally, he showed no reaction, but internally, he was in shock.

'Everything about me is written here?'

From birth to progressing through rounds and reaching this point.

Every move he had made so far was written in this one book.
ChatGPT

However, it did not include the content of conversations with other people.

Only what was done and what was obtained was written.

'But what's written here is the content of the 100th regression.'

The contents from the 1st to the 99th regression were nowhere to be found.

'Is it natural since I regressed?'

During that moment of contemplation, Lubahi made an unexpected statement.

[Oh, the record of your regression is not in that book. No one can read it and find out, so rest assured.]

"...."

Suppressing the deliberately surprised emotions, Ryumin glared at Lubahi as if piercing through him.

He smirked with a gaze that seemed to say he knows everything.

"You."

Ryumin, unable to do anything, revealed his determination.

"How much do you actually know?"

Once he knows about the regression, he can't let him live.

As Ryumin approached, Lubahi raised both hands and stepped back.

[Whoa, calm down first. I have no intention of fighting. I can't fight here either.]

"What?"

[The Akashic Records are a noble space protecting all information in the universe. All abilities of the flesh and soul are restricted here. Even Chaos cannot annihilate me here.]

When the name Chaos was mentioned, Ryumin regained his composure.

"Do you also know about Chaos?"

[Of course. Did you come to find out its weaknesses?]

Lubahi smiled as if he knew everything.

[I'll tell you. Since I'm on your side, no matter what others say.]
