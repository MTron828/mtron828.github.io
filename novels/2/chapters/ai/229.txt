Title: Episode 229 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Envoy Team

[CPF Battalion Commander Black Scythe warns players worldwide! Don't do bad things.] [Black Scythe, who hates criminals, warns that they will die if caught! Declaration of war!] [In which country do crimes by players run rampant, as Black Scythe claims?] [President Yoon says, "The country being persecuted by players should seek help from Korea."] [Netizen reactions after Black Scythe's speech: Arrogant vs Overflowing sense of justice. How do other countries react?]

After the Cheongwadae (Blue House) speech, various articles were posted.

As the content is what it is, netizens engaged in heated debates.

└ This is absurd. Who does he think he is, meddling instead of helping?

└ That's right. They should mind their own business. Laughable that they say they'll help other countries?

└Damn hypocrites. Even if they say they'll do something good, they're just bastards.

└No, regardless of whether it's a good thing or not, it's funny. Who are they to judge others? Judges? Is this some lawless land?

└Hey, you Xs! Do you know why you can sleep comfortably and stretch your legs? If it weren't for CPF, all the shops on the streets would have been looted!

└Damn right. Players will die naturally even if left alone. They are guys who die half by half every month.

└Then, if a group of day-to-day criminals enters your house, will you just leave them alone because they'll die after a day? Nonsense.

└Right. Thanks to Black Scythe, the damage is relatively low. If you look at overseas news, many countries are still suffering due to players committing crimes.

└Whether it's another country or ours, as long as we live well, why bother helping other countries? Why bother with others' countries? LOL.

└They hate day-to-day criminals.

└I think they're just doing that to fulfill their desire for murder.

└Hey guys. They say they'll do something good, so at least support them. Instead of praising, they're just bashing them like crazy.

└That's right. Many people who talk bad about others' business. From the perspective of the victims, Black Scythe's statement might be a glimmer of hope...

└No, are there countries asking for help? Where is a country where players seize power and harass citizens? Isn't that a complete conspiracy theory?

└You'll know if reports come in.

└There might be enough, right? Even I, if I gain superhuman powers, will assassinate the leadership and take control. Then, I'll rule as I please, like a king.

└The top comment is a potential criminal. Be careful of someone like that.

└I agree with Black Scythe's thoughts. We may live peacefully like this, but there might be countries suffering because of players. In the perspective of such countries, Black Scythe's proposal might be a ray of hope, no different from salvation.

└So, without evidence, it's all just speculation~ You X!

└Why are you ordinary people fighting here among yourselves? Go out there and fight.

└Hey, guys, I really don't know, but what is Black Scythe? Is it a new scythe that came out?

The comments section was nothing short of a battlefield.

Since it was a sensitive topic, opinions were divided.

"It doesn't matter. If we show the results in the end, that's enough."

Ironically, the more intense, the better.

When people's attention is focused, the ripple effect will be even greater, so it's better to stir things up.

"I should go check it out."

Ryumin put his phone away and boarded the plane.

"Black Scythe? Nice to meet you. I'm Captain Seo Taeseok. We met when I went to Nigeria last time..."

"Yes. I remember."

At that time, when he advised to be careful as Nigeria was dangerous when getting off the chartered plane.

"Now that I think about it, I apologize for making off-topic remarks back then. I didn't even know it was the famous Black Scythe..."

"No, thanks to that, I could be more vigilant."

"Are you going to do something good this time too?"

Ryumin smiled subtly, even though his face was hidden behind a mask.

"As a matter of fact. Please take care of me again this time."

"Oh, don't worry. I'll take you to your destination comfortably."

After shaking hands with the captain, he took a seat in the first-class cabin.

Thunk-

But not long after, someone sat down next to Ryumin.

It was Slave No. 1, Yamtti.

"Where are the others?"

"All six are sitting behind."

There were not only two people on the plane.
ChatGPT

Including Slave No. 2 Ju Sungtak, as well as Heo Taeseok, Eom Junseok, Min Juri, Seo Arin, and Jo Yongho.

The key members of the Sasin Church were gathered together.

In other words, it was a kind of envoy team called by Ryumin to promote the Sasin Church abroad.

"Now that we've absorbed all the players in the country, it's time to expand abroad."

To control players worldwide, it's effective to first enroll them in the organization.

"Although we framed it as a religion, the Sasin Church is ultimately an organization formed by players."

Wouldn't it create a sense of belonging more than joining a small café like the Pleseba?

"By the way, it was a sudden contact, but thanks for coming out willingly."

Heo Taeseok and Eom Junseok were the head priest and chief priest, so they had their reasons. However, there was no particular reason for others to step forward.

Still, they willingly boarded the plane to the United States at his request, so he was grateful.

"Shall I tell the flight attendant that we can depart now?"

"No, wait. Before we go, there's someone I need to call."

Ryumin immediately called Kristen.

-Hello, is this Black Scythe?

Kristen, who received the number through Jeffrey last time, greeted warmly.

"Yeah, it's me. It's night over there, right? Sorry for calling so late."

-No, it's fine. It's not even that late at 11 o'clock. Feel free to call anytime. But what's the matter?

"Well, it's not nothing. I'm planning to take a charter flight to the United States."

-What? Really?

"I'm promoting the Sasin Church, the religion I belong to. While going to the U.S., I thought it would be helpful if you joined me."

-That's a great idea. I'll guide you. I know well where players are more concentrated.

"Thanks for accepting willingly. Then, let's meet at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in 14 hours. Just come with Jeffrey."

-Jeffrey... Toy?

There was a hint of disappointment in her voice, as if she had intended to go alone.

"The more people, the better."

-Oh, I see. Okay, then I'll see you at the airport.

With this, Kristen was also pulled into the plan.

"Now, let's depart."

"Yes, Black Scythe."

The plane gradually took off.

A quiet church with no one around.

Kristen finished the call and put down her phone.

Getting a call from a savior of life while praying—was it the Lord answering her prayers?

She quietly smiled, but a voice came from behind.

"Who answers the phone with such a bright voice?"

She turned her head and saw her father.

"Well, what is it? Did you hear it?"

"If you speak so loudly, I can't help but hear it. Who was on the phone?"

"...It was Black Scythe."

Upon hearing those words, Nesun's indifferent face lit up.

She already knew who Black Scythe was.

The benefactor who saved her daughter in Round 11.

As a father, there was no reason for him to view Black Scythe negatively.

"You talked to that person in the middle of the night?"

"Yes."

"Haven't there been talks about you dating Black Scythe?"

"What? Da, dating who?"

Kristen's face turned as red as a beetroot.

"Weren't you dating? I wish you were."

"Ah, it's not like that. We, we're not dating."

"And you didn't get along well with that garbage named Makyungrok?"

"You know Father forced me into that, right?"

"Hmm, I apologize for that. I truly had no eye for people."

The murder case involving Oseong Group's heir was a worldwide issue, even in a country on the other side of the Earth.

Naturally, Nesun, who was handling the case, knew about it.

"I thought he was a decent human being, but turns out he was a psychopathic killer hiding his true intentions. If he had continued his relationship with that bastard, we would have regretted it for a long time."

"That's true."

"As expected, you can't judge people just by their appearance. Tsk, tsk."

Nesun, who had a bitter taste in his mouth, didn't want to utter the name Makyungrok.

The trash who killed his brothers for the succession competition, murdered witnesses, and even killed his own daughter to hide the secret.

Just thinking about it filled him with anger.

On the other hand, what about Black Scythe?

The benefactor who saved his daughter and, moreover, asked for nothing in return.

Furthermore, according to recent news, Black Scythe declared that he would rescue countries in need from players.

If there were saints, speaking well of Black Scythe would be an understatement.

"Haha, you went to Korea to find Black Scythe's location two months ago and came back without any significant findings. And now you're in contact with him? If you handle this well, there's a possibility..."

"What are you talking about right now?"

"Take advantage of this opportunity and approach Black Scythe. Opportunities don't come anytime. Actively step forward and make it yours!"

"Father!"

"Why? Don't like it? How about the prophet then? I don't think that person is bad either, but..."

"Dad!"

"Haha, just kidding. Just kidding. By the way, what did you talk about with Black Scythe?"

Calming down her anger, Kristen explained the conversation with Black Scythe to her father.

"He created a religion called the Sasin Church and came to the U.S. for promotion. He said it would be great if I helped, so..."

Kristen gauged Nesun's reaction.

It was a request to help a different religion, even though it wasn't an official one, so she was somewhat concerned.

However, Nesun turned out to be a clergyman who was unexpectedly open-minded.

"It's not a bad thing to help with promotion. Even if it's a different religion."

"Really?"

"Yeah. I allowed it because the other party is Black Scythe. If it were a different religion, I wouldn't have allowed it without hesitation!"

"Do you know how to use such expressions?"

"Well, I was looking up the words young people use these days..."

"Even young people don't use such words often..."

Kristen didn't know, but Nesun was making an effort to change in his own way.

To narrow the gap with his awkward daughter in their conversations.

'I can't waste precious time when I don't know how much time we'll have together.'

Was losing his only daughter as a fiancée the catalyst for this change?

In front of Kristen, Nesun showed a soft smile that she rarely saw.

"Why, why are you smiling like that?"

"It's nothing. Anyway, help Black Scythe well and come back safely. If you think it's dangerous, take Jeffrey with you."

"I was already planning to do that."

"All right then. It's late, so go to bed quickly."

"Yes. Father."

Kristen smiled softly as she observed the changed atmosphere of Nesun.

It seems that the change in mindset after overcoming the crisis of almost losing his daughter was not unique to herself.

[This is Captain Seo Taeseok. Our plane is scheduled to arrive at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Texas shortly.]

After a long 14-hour flight, the Sasin Church delegation, including Ryumin, set foot on American soil.

"You need to show your face to pass."

An immigration officer blocked Ryumin, who was wearing a mask.

Although his colleagues who had already passed the inspection turned around, there was no problem.

"Is it okay?"

As long as he showed his face only to the immigration officer, who couldn't see anyone else, it was fine.

Well, even if the face was visible, there was no need to worry. Ryumin maintained the appearance of Lost Yak, not revealing himself just in case.

"Like a kind of double security?"

After the immigration officer's confirmation, they could pass through the immigration desk.

"Done. Let's go now."

As Ryumin, wearing the mask again, was about to leave the airport door with his waiting colleagues, Kristen, who had come to greet him in advance, called out.

"Black Scythe!"

Kristen waved her hand happily from a distance.

Jeffrey, Yanti's subordinate standing beside her, nodded quietly.

"You came to meet me not too late."

"Yes. I said I would guide you."

Kristen intended to repay a bit of her emotional debt on this occasion. Of course, there were also personal feelings involved.

"I thought you came alone... but there are some familiar faces with you?"

"I didn't have the confidence to promote alone."

Kristen sighed with regret, not expecting so many people.

"You mentioned recruiting players for the Sasin Church, right? Let's go! I know a good place."

"Sorry, what should I do with this?"

"What?"

"To be honest, not only for promotion but also for personal reasons, I came to the U.S. I'm sorry, but would you mind going with these members here first? I'll join you as soon as I finish my business."

"Oh... okay."

Kristen was disappointed that they couldn't go together, but she wasn't the only one disappointed.

"Black Scythe, where are you going?"

Seo Arin, who understood English, asked, and the attention of Minjuri and other Sasin Church members focused.

"I have urgent matters to attend to."

'I need to quickly deal with those Messiah bastards.'

Ryumin smiled secretly behind his mask, hiding his true thoughts.

"Then, let's go. Yanti, let's go."

"Black Scythe, where is Yanti going...?"
ChatGPT

"He needs something important."

Leaving only these words, sparks flew from Kristen's eyes.

Seo Arin and Minjuri felt the same way.

'Why does it feel like a sudden betrayal...?'

Feeling the uncomfortable atmosphere, Yanti quickly followed Black Scythe.
