Title: "Episode 164 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player"

Overseas Topic

[Women kidnapped in Nigeria express their stance on the Black Scythe....]

It has been revealed that the Korean player known as Black Scythe (nickname), who is infamous for making the IS leader commit suicide and killing the members of the unit, has also eradicated a human trafficking organization.

In Nigeria, various organized crimes such as human trafficking, drug trafficking, prostitution, organ trafficking, baby factories, etc., are still rampant, but now even that seems to be a thing of the past.

According to the results announced by the Nigerian government, it has been confirmed that 22 organizations under investigation have disappeared without a trace in just a few days.

What happened?

It was the actions of the one claiming to be Black Scythe.

Su Binna (30), a woman who had been kidnapped by the actual human trafficking organization, testified.

She stated that she had to endure each day in pain, trapped behind small iron bars, waiting to be slaughtered like livestock.

Even in the midst of the demonic organization members who didn't even feed pigs but forced them to eat dead bodies, she persisted because she didn't have the courage to commit suicide.

The glimmer of light that came down into the seemingly hopeless prison was none other than Black Scythe.

He supposedly eradicated the organization members and rescued all the women who were held captive without any cost.

The women who actually reported the kidnapping confirmed this.

They said that if it weren't for Black Scythe and the Asian woman who seemed to be his partner, they would still be trapped in that horrific prison.

The author is not an activist or an advocate of pacifism, but hearing the stories of the countless women saved by Black Scythe, there was one thing that could be stated with certainty.

Black Scythe's actions should not be condemned; rather, they should be appropriately praised.

(This article is a direct translation of the original article from Nigeria.)

└Wow... there's nothing more to say about this.

└He rescued dozens of kidnapped people.

└After rescuing them without any cost, he disappeared without a word.

└Impressive...

└He's truly a righteous person.

└If it's true, it's a truly commendable act.

└It's true. When I searched on Google, the original article came up.

└But the comments here are clean. On other articles, there were many people having fits, saying Black Scythe should be punished as a murderer.

└Haha, murderer? Those idiots who were saying that, did they all disappear?

└These idiots. Even after seeing this, if they talk about the criminal's human rights, they're not human, really.

└Those who aren't human are the bastards involved in human trafficking. I'm getting angry.

└Black Scythe did well a hundred, a thousand times.

└(This comment has been deleted after being reported.)

└By the way, who is the woman mentioned as his partner?

└Isn't she Black Scythe's girlfriend?

└Haha, Black Scythe is crazy, would he bring his girlfriend to a murder spree?

└Literally his partner, I guess.

└Oh, Lord! I believed. Truly, you are the savior of this era. Sa! Vi! Or!

A satisfied smile appeared on Ryu Min's lips as he read the comments.

'The atmosphere has turned around.'

Thanks to the women rescued in Nigeria coming forward, Black Scythe has become a hero who saved people from a serial killer.

With articles representing the victims, many people immersed themselves in the victims' situations and took Black Scythe's side.

'Okay. It should be fine to go public externally at this point.'

Ryu Min picked up the Lost Yak's phone.

As expected, there were hundreds of missed calls.

'Interviews, public service ads, presidential commendations, accept them all.'

Ryu Min decided to promote himself like a celebrity this time.

He planned to use every means and method to elevate Black Scythe's reputation.

To turn Black Scythe into a national hero, he first needed to become famous.

Make sure everyone, even ordinary people, knows the name Black Scythe.

'Is this the right time to use this?'

Ryu Min took out an item from his inventory.

It was a package of runes received as a reward for completing 10 rounds.

Using it now, while feeling good, even if a bad rune comes out, it probably won't feel as bad.

'Use.'

With a bright light, the package of runes disappeared.

At the same time, a new rune appeared, and the message that it was imprinted on the body brightened the view.

Nine months have passed since the world changed.

The 15 to 29-year-olds who started at 1.8 billion are now down to a mere 130,000.

Among them, there are fewer than 700 Korean players.

The global population has decreased by more than 22%.

It was a population reduction despite economic turbulence.

"We failed. Our company is done for."

Ma Kyung-rok had seen many company CEOs lamenting in this manner.

He understood it.

As someone who also runs a business, he felt that it was enough to make a fuss.

But he couldn't empathize.

"I'm living well, so it's okay for me."

As long as he was doing well, it was enough.

"No, it's enough for our company to do well."

Because of this dominant mindset, even though he intellectually understood the complaints around him, he couldn't emotionally empathize.

His company hadn't failed like others.

"As the prophet said, right? After transitioning to a VVIP site, the revenue really didn't decrease."

At the point of returning from the round, Ppl Market had already revamped its site into a VVIP-exclusive one.

To capture existing customers more effectively, they threw in generous events and increased auction quantities.

"There were many good items among the ones the prophet handed over, so it helped maintain the market."

One week after returning from the round.

Although the customer base had decreased by a quarter, the revenue fluctuation wasn't significant, thanks to players actively engaging in trade, pouring their entire wealth to find better items due to a sense of survival.

In the midst of this, the setup resembling a site for VVIPs played its part.

"I did well to listen to the prophet. Hehe."

Ma Kyung-rok smiled smugly.

He took pride in his choice not to doubt the prophet.

Of course, the prophet's advice played a significant role.

But the prophet only pointed the way.

The choice was entirely his own, wasn't it?

"I discerned and accepted the prophet's advice well. Well, I admit the prophet can be a bit quirky."

Now he no longer worried about the company failing.

He had confidence in continuing to build it up even without the prophet's advice.

The issue now was whether he could capitalize on this momentum and achieve success worthy of listing on the KOSPI.

"I should start preparing for listing soon. To gain recognition from my father, nothing is as certain as a KOSPI listing."

Putting aside worries about the company, Ma Kyung-rok thought of another concern.

"Is the next round finally the deadly Round 11?"

Of course, Ma Kyung-rok wasn't worried about himself. It was the fiancée who might die in Round 11 that concerned him.

"I hope she stays safe."

There was no tender emotion, just sympathy due to pity.

Ma Kyung-rok had never been interested in romance in the first place. He was entangled in a business relationship forced by his father's influence.

Superficially, they were a couple, but they had never even had a common kiss.

Someone might misunderstand, thinking he liked women, but in reality, Ma Kyung-rok only knew himself and his company.

Nevertheless, at this moment, he couldn't help but be concerned.

"What if, by any chance, Kristin dies as the prophecy says? I will surely face blame as well, won't I?"

Knowing the danger, if he couldn't prevent it, he couldn't avoid blame either.

If his engaged partner died, it would undoubtedly damage his image.

"I should protect Kristin by my side. Especially since Round 11 is said to be integrated with another country."

For detailed information, he could ask Ryu Min, the prophet.

"It's about time for him to come anyway..."

Just then, there was a smart knock, and the door to the office opened.

To his surprise, it wasn't Ryu Min who entered.

It was a blonde Caucasian woman, Kristin.

"You're here, Kristin."

"Sorry for coming without notice."

"Haha, what's there to apologize for? We're not a normal couple, but lovers. It's nice to see you often, right?"

Ma Kyung-rok always put on a friendly smile in front of Kristin.

Kristin, unaware of his cautious demeanor, didn't realize.

"The reason I came, you already know from the call, right?"

"Of course. Since it's the day of the meeting, just wait a bit. Coffee?"

"Sure."

Ma Kyung-rok brewed coffee in the break room and engaged in various conversations with Kristin.

Ritualistic words about the weather, whether she was uncomfortable coming, and inquiries about his father were exchanged.
ChatGPT

Conversations among players occurred, asking questions like, "What level are you?" or "Was Round 10 difficult?" There were also discussions about the authenticity of the prophecy.

Their dialogue lacked the usual sweetness found in conversations between typical couples.

During this time, Ma Kyung-rok received a call from a subordinate.

"Oh, really? Okay."

"What was the call about?"

"He's here."

"Ah."

Ma Kyung-rok got up from his seat, went outside the office, and prepared to welcome the visitor.

After a while, a short man entered the office.

The prophet.

He was the reason Kristin had come to Korea.

"Hello, Mr. Ma."

"Major shareholder, have you come?"

Ryu Min greeted while noticing Kristin standing beside him.

"Is your fiancée also here?"

"Hello, Ryu Min."

"Nice to meet you, Kristin."

"You remember my name."

"Of course. You've come for a reason."

Kristin looked at Ma Kyung-rok with surprised rabbit eyes.

It was a gaze asking if he had revealed the reason for her visit, but Ma Kyung-rok just nodded.

"Mr. Ma hasn't said anything to me. I foresaw everything. Shall we have a quiet talk somewhere?"

"Sure."

Following Ryu Min outside, Kristin gestured for Ma Kyung-rok not to follow.

"Sorry, but I'll talk to him alone."

"Oh, sure. I'll wait here. Have a comfortable conversation and come back."

"Thank you."

Ryu Min and Kristin sat on a bench in front of the company.

"This seems like a good spot. By the way, why did Mr. Ma tell you not to come?"

"I think it would be easier to talk there. It's a significant matter involving my life, and if others hear, it might change the future."

"Well, that's not wrong."

Ryu Min chuckled and asked abruptly, "Are you worried about Round 11, so you came to Korea?"

"Yes. More precisely, I came to meet the prophet and seek advice."

"Advice... I think I said everything back then."

"It's not about what you said. You know but are hiding it. Who is the one saving me? Who is threatening me?"

"..."

"Forgive me for being blunt. Please tell me. You mentioned there is a group that doesn't acknowledge me. Who exactly?"
ChatGPT

"I don't know either. I mentioned it before."

"I know. But please, even if it's a small clue. You said you saw the scene back then. It would be better to prevent it in advance. It might be helpful in a crisis situation."

"I don't remember now. I've completely forgotten."

"..."

Kristin couldn't find words in response to that statement. With persistent ignorance, there seemed to be no way forward.

"Then, the person who saved you? You saw their face, right? Do you remember?"

"I know, but I can't tell you."

"Is it because telling might change the future?"

"You know it well."

"Still, can't you tell me? I'll be careful not to change the future."

"How can you guarantee that? What if Kristin dies, how should I face Mr. Ma then?"

"..."

"You're curious and anxious, so you rushed here in a month, but there's nothing I can do. There are limits to the information I can provide."

"Sigh..."

Even the strongest walls have their limits. Though frustrated, Kristin understood. If the future changes, the prophet's credibility would undoubtedly be shattered.

"I'm sorry. I got too carried away because I was excited."

"No problem."

"Since something is about to happen in the next round, I guess I was anxious and more sensitive. I apologize once again."

Kristin, who spoke plainly, asked for confirmation.

"So, is there anything I should do other than waiting for someone to save me?"

"Yes. For now, that would be the best."

"Sigh..."

"Don't worry too much, Kristin. Everything will be fine."

With a simple and warm comfort, Kristin felt a bit relieved.

"Thank you, Prophet. Since you say so, I trust you."

"Is that so? Then, since Mr. Ma is waiting, shall we go up? While you're here, why not listen to the prophecy for Round 11 together?"

"Okay."

The two got up from the bench and entered the company, unaware that someone was watching their backs with an intense gaze.
