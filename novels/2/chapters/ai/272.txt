Title: "Episode 272 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player"

Strategic Simulation Game

If you're a man from South Korea, you've probably played a strategic simulation game at least once.

"You know? That game where you mine minerals. It's somewhat similar to that," Ryo Min explained to the newcomers.

How easy it is to win in a war.

"Don't need to think too hard. See here? Military forces section. Press this, then press this again...."

"It says troop reinforcement?"

"You can reinforce soldiers using gold?"

"That's right."

Explaining by pointing directly at the screen made them understand quickly.

"Commander players can spend their gold to upgrade or add equipment to their troops. If you lack troops, you can also hire mercenaries. Of course, it will cost gold."

"So, the more commanders, the better?"

"Yes. Because you'll have more gold."

It was natural that having more commanders was advantageous.

Just as the performance of a server computer increases when you add multiple CPUs, it's also beneficial to have more heads when planning a strategy.

The difference in gold increased as well.

However, the faces of the players still showed shadows.

It wasn't because it wasn't enough. It was because they saw the prices.

"A thousand gold to upgrade the weapon of one soldier?"

"T-then, if there are ten thousand, it's ten million gold, right?"

"This, this price is outrageous!"

Hiring mercenaries was even more expensive.

"Ten thousand gold to add one veteran mercenary?"

"I-it's too expensive!"

No matter how many heads they had, the disciples had no way to afford it with the gold they had.

"L-let's each open up our gold. How much do you have?"

"I have 1.3 million gold."

"I have 1.1 million gold...."

No player had over 2 million gold.

That much was only possible because they all received 1 million gold each as a reward for the 16th round.

At that moment, a player who was good at calculations spoke in disbelief.

"When it's said to be 1 million gold per person, even if everyone here has that amount, it's only around 300 million gold...."
ChatGPT

"300 million? What can we do with that?"

"Because the kingdom's current military strength is 30,000...."

"If we hire 30,000 mercenaries, will that be enough?"

Kingdom's military strength: 30,000 vs. Holy Empire's military strength: 320,000.

A difference of over 10 times.

Can this gap be filled by just adding 30,000 mercenaries?

Can the balance of war shift in favor of the kingdom with just that?

People shook their heads in disbelief.

Overwhelmed by the numbers.

Some sighed and murmured about their impending doom.

Ryu Min, feeling a bit smug, clicked his tongue and said, "I told you. No need to worry."

"Lord of the Black Scythe, is there any good strategy...?"

"Do you know how much gold I have?"

As people shook their heads, Ryu Min spoke up.

"I have 6 billion."

"Gasp!"

"Is that, is that true?"

"Th-that much...."

In reality, it was close to 10 billion, but he deliberately understated it.

He set the budget for this round at 6 billion.

'Besides, it's better to appear like I've put everything in rather than leaving some money behind, giving off a better image.'

Even with half of the amount he mentioned, it was enough to surprise the people.

"You're not thinking of investing all 6 billion, are you...?"

"I will invest. Considering the rewards upon victory, it's worth it."

Hope emerged on the faces of the desperate people.

Some stared at Ryu Min as if he were a real god.

"There's no need to worry. If Lord of the Black Scythe spends all 6 billion alone...."

"No, I can't spend it all alone."

"What?"

People were puzzled, but soon they understood the reason.

"Each person has a limit on the amount they can spend."

"What? How much?"

"I can only spend up to 1 billion gold per person. I don't know why there's such a restriction."

"What?!"

"Well, how much is it per person?"

"I can only use up to 100 million gold per person. I don't know why there's this limit."

While he claimed not to know, he had some suspicions.

'The system probably didn't anticipate that there would be players with over 1 billion gold at this point.'

But there was a player here who had 10 billion.

He couldn't spend it all alone, though.
ChatGPT

"As long as there's a gold limit, I can't spend it all alone. So, from now on, I'm going to distribute 20 million gold to each of you. Everyone, accept my trade offer."

Ryu Min sent trade requests to each player, distributing 20 million gold to each.

However, he gave more to Minjuri and Christine.

"Um, did you make a mistake?"

"Why so much... contrary to our agreement."

It was surprising to receive double the promised amount.

But there was a reason.

"Spend all that money. That way, you can receive rank rewards."

"Ah...!"

This round's ranking would be determined by the order of who spent the most gold.

They were given an extra-large amount to secure 2nd and 3rd places this time.

"Of course, I can't hand over the 1st place to anyone."

By spending 100 million gold alone, he secured the 1st place.

After distributing to everyone except himself, a total of 5.75 billion gold was spent.

"You should know what to do with the money I just gave you, right?"

"Yes!"

"You can use it anywhere. Upgrade your weapons or armor, or use it to hire mercenaries. Whatever you do, as long as you spend all the gold I gave you, the tide of the war will turn in our favor. Got it?"

"Yes, understood!"

Ryu Min's words held a power that made people submissive.

It wasn't a metaphor; there was indeed such a power due to the temporary skill Ryu Min possessed.

[Temporary Skill â€“ Commander]

Effect: A passive skill applied at all times, making players obey Ryu Min's commands. Limited to the 17th round, the skill is released at the end of the round.

"With this, there shouldn't be any disobedience."

He knew that players wouldn't misuse or hoard the gold he provided.

The effect of the skill was absolute.

"Now, I'll leave the war to the 285 commanders here...."

Ryu Min looked outside the command post.

While the war was taking place, he had something else to do.

"I need to hunt a dragon at the Dragon Rare."

The opportunity to obtain a god-tier accessory after titles, runes, and god-tier accessories was rare.

"But before that, let's spend 100 million gold."
ChatGPT

Approaching the status board, Ryu Min used 100 million gold to add 10,000 troops.

After a satisfied smile, he flew out of the command post, aiming for the sky to claim the dragon reward.

[Player 'CobaltBlue' has joined the 'Holy Empire' faction.] [Obtained the qualification of a Holy Empire commander.] [Moving directly to the command post.]

Entering the Holy Empire command post, CobaltBlue smiled alone.

It wasn't a mistake.

He knew exactly what he had done.

"I betrayed the Black Scythe."

Not only the Black Scythe but also turned away from all the members of the Death Cult.

"Most likely, everyone except me chose the Kingdom Alliance."

He heard it from the Black Scythe.

The Holy Empire is overwhelmingly powerful.

However, people chose the Kingdom Alliance.

Because the Black Scythe instructed them to.

"But my prediction is different. The Black Scythe will definitely join the Holy Empire."

The Black Scythe forced people to choose the Kingdom Alliance.

Despite the disadvantage, only because the rewards were substantial.

"He told them to choose the Kingdom Alliance without explaining how to win the war? There's definitely some trickery going on."

Since then, CobaltBlue had been suspicious.

That the Black Scythe was lying.

"He pushed people into the unfavorable side and plans to go alone to the advantageous Holy Empire. I'm sure of it."

How could he be so sure?

Because if he were in his shoes, he would do the same.

If there's an opportunity to backstab, it's now.

"Of course, why would the Black Scythe betray? But..."

CobaltBlue was convinced.

There must be a reason.

"For example, if the side with fewer players wins, they receive a huge reward... something like that. There must be some benefit."

Honestly, he didn't know well.

It was just a suspicion born out of doubt.

The same was true for the 'faction' issue he reported to Master He Tae-suk.

"In fact, I didn't hear it properly. I only heard snippets of conversation, like whether it's a faction or what."

While claiming that, he detailed his request, asking to join his side.

Adding a personal opinion that they were creating a faction.

It was surprising that the cult leader accepted whether he was a flatterer or not, but well, it's a thing of the past now.
ChatGPT

He no longer wanted to think about the cult leader.

"If I reported, at least I should get something, even just a handful of rewards. It was a futile expectation."

Perhaps it was pointless to expect anything for just a handful of rewards.

"This is why you shouldn't beg favors from the Black-Headed Beast?"

Distrusting even the Black-Headed Beast, CobaltBlue expanded that suspicion to the Black Scythe.

As a result, expecting that the Black Scythe would backstab him, he chose the Holy Empire.

It was a betrayal to the Black Scythe, who called his name in the 16th round purely based on his narrow-minded thoughts and suspicions.

"Someone might think, 'Did he risk his life for such uncertainty?'"

However, CobaltBlue didn't regret it.

"Surviving alone is enough for me, right?"

If it was a strategy simulation game, he was more confident than anyone.

Then it happened.

Swoosh

A human figure appeared in front of him.

Another person entered the command post.

"Huh, the Black Scythe?"

As expected, his thoughts were correct. The Black Scythe deceived people and chose the Holy Empire.

He inwardly celebrated, but his laughter quickly subsided.

It wasn't the Black Scythe; it was someone else.

"Uh? Oh, there's one more?"

"Who are you?"

"I'm Chris. My nickname is [Christian]."

A nickname he hadn't heard before.

For now, he felt relieved that it wasn't someone with black hair.

"Why did you choose the Holy Empire?"

"And you?"

"I asked first."

"Well, I..."

Listening quietly, CobaltBlue smirked.

It turned out that this person had the same reason as him.

"Did you also doubt the Black Scythe?"

"Yes. Choosing the disadvantageous Kingdom faction... I thought about what would happen if we all died together."

"Instead of that, I thought it would be better to choose with conviction."

"Yes. Besides, the Black Scythe seemed suspicious this time. I thought he might stand on the opposite side."

In the end, this person also threw the dice, suspecting the Black Scythe just like him.

"But we seem to be the only ones? Where's the Black Scythe?"

"He'll probably come soon, won't he?"

However, contrary to their expectations, the message revealed a different result.
ChatGPT

[The faction selection has ended.] [Faction Selection Status]

â”” Holy Empire: 2 members

â”” Kingdom Alliance: 286 members

"Uh, everyone except the two of us chose the Kingdom Alliance?"

"Then the Black Scythe must be on that side too, right?"

Christian looked bewildered, but CobaltBlue quickly dismissed the worries.

"Since it turned out like this, there's nothing we can do. We'll just have to kill all of them ourselves."

"How do you plan to win against 286 people?"

"Why can't we win? It's a game where strategy, not strength, determines the outcome."

CobaltBlue was confident.

When it came to strategy simulation games, he was already at the level of a professional gamer.

"No matter how many low-quality CPUs you attach, they're still low quality. Nothing compares to a high-performance CPU. Hehe."

Smiling, CobaltBlue, who was observing the battle situation board, looked at the blue dots as confidently as his name.

With such a formidable force, kingdoms were nothing to worry about.

"Well, let's start the battle slowly... Huh?"

CobaltBlue blinked his eyes while speaking.

Suddenly, countless red dots appeared.

"This, this can't be happening? Is it malfunctioning?"

He even tried hitting the screen to check if it was broken, but the red dots were increasing in real-time every time he blinked.

As if cells were proliferating.

"W-What is this? Why are the enemies increasing?"

"I-I don't know."

"There are now nearly twice as many as us!"

The army, initially 30,000 strong, had suddenly swelled to 600,000.

Sweat dripped down the faces of the two.

"C-Can this be true? Is the Holy Empire really advantageous?"

CobaltBlue suddenly began to doubt even the angels.

Unaware that suspicion could bring about disaster.

At that moment, the Kingdom Alliance began a charge.

Christian, panicked, shouted, "Wow! You said you were good at the game! Come up with a strategy!"

"W-Well, th-that...!"

With the number doubling, what strategy could he come up with?

CobaltBlue was bewildered and didn't know what to do.

Just observing the two fighting.

"O-Our troops are quickly decreasing."

Even though their forces were overwhelming, the quality of weapons and armor was superior on the other side.
ChatGPT

Otherwise, would they collapse like a swaying reed?

"No, we'll be doomed. If we continue like this, it's total annihilation."

CobaltBlue immediately issued a retreat order.

There was no need to devise a strategy utilizing the terrain; they were simply busy running away.

And so, the first battle of the Holy Empire ended in a complete defeat.
