Title: Episode 218 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

The Treasure Warehouse of Elsorium

Did it take about three minutes?

A flash of light is visible from the warp gate in the distance.

Soon, someone comes running hastily.

It was the five elders, the actual rulers of Elsorium.

"Wow, wow. Is that really the Black Scythe?"

"The Black Scythe visiting our elf village."

Even though it's their first meeting, these NPCs recognize their faces.

It's not pretending; it's a reaction that implies they really know, reading thoughts.

"Sorry for making you wait so long. Please come this way quickly! We will escort you to the palace."

"Sure."

Ryumin followed them, leaving behind the understanding that he's being treated like a hero who saved his homeland.

Understanding the reputation system logically in a world where even people can be resurrected is a contradiction in terms.

"I apologize for keeping you waiting. Please come up this way."

As they climbed onto the warp gate, they were instantly transported inside the palace.

"This way."

Following the elders to the guest room, the maids who were resting there stood up in surprise.

"What are you all doing! A noble guest has arrived, and you're not even bringing tea!"

"Yes, yes! S-sorry, elder!"

Ignoring the hurried maids, the elder smiled briefly.

"Think of this place as your own home and rest comfortably. We'll bring warm tea and snacks soon."

"Sure."

Ryumin, who didn't refuse, comfortably leaned back in his chair.

There was no reason to refuse the hospitality as they treated him as an esteemed guest.

With the quest already completed, there was plenty of time to spare.

"I've been to Elsorium many times, but it's quite fascinating. The elves living like humans."

The elf society here was so similar to humans that it could be considered a typical kingdom if you changed the race.

'It probably means they have a lot of interactions with humans. These items must have been obtained through trade with human societies rather than being crafted by elves.'

However, on the surface, elves and humans don't seem to have a close relationship.

Elves, who love nature, wouldn't be fond of humans who destroy nature.

The reason humans were treated coldly at the entrance was also because of this.

'Yet, they live so comfortably in well-built buildings, enjoying the convenience of human-made goods.'

There might be people who chose Elsorium for reputation work.

But developing a relationship with elves is not easy.

'Overall, it's probably the most challenging among all races.'

Unless someone saves their life in a specific situation, they won't receive such treatment anywhere, just like Ryumin.

"Here is the tea and snacks."

Ryumin, who received the tea from the maid, first smelled it.

The strong scent of pine leaves made him feel calm.

'Sometimes, this kind of relaxation isn't bad.'

Sip-

Ryumin drank the tea with a comfortable feeling.

He didn't doubt that it might be poisoned.

There was no reason for them to target someone equivalent to a hero in his homeland, and he trusted the reputation system.

After about three sips, the elders who had left the guest room were returning with someone.

It was Princess Yufinelcia and the Knight Commander Yuglito.

'I wondered where they went, and it turns out they went to fetch the princess.'

They probably had various discussions among themselves.

What to give to the esteemed guest who suddenly appeared.

The result was the princess they were presenting now.

'They probably think that if they release the princess and maintain a close relationship with me, it won't be a loss for them.'

Sure enough.

Reading the thoughts of the approaching elder who was smiling, Ryumin confirmed that was the case.

"Black Scythe. How are you? Is the tea to your liking?"

"Well, the fragrance is nice."

"It's tea made from Tibery leaves, which we recently purchased at a high price from the Brahham Kingdom. Drinking it has the effect of refreshing your mind."

"It does seem like that. But elves who revere nature seem to have active interactions with humans?"

"We cannot continue to live isolated from the world forever, right? If there are better things, we should accept them. However, it doesn't mean we are getting close to humans. We still prefer to remain neutral..."

The elder glanced at Ryumin.

"Unlike with other humans, we would like to maintain a good relationship with the Black Scythe if possible. Just like now."

"I'd like that too."

Was Ryumin accepting that their relationship might lead to a conflict? The elder, slightly puzzled by Ryumin's words, chuckled and introduced the princess.

"Oh, I'm late with the introduction. You've met before, right? Princess Yufinelcia."

"It's been a while, Black Scythe. It's an honor to meet you again."

Yufinelcia curtsied, lifting her dress slightly.

The princess, who seemed young at the time, now gave off a more mature vibe.

"Hehe, even the Black Scythe is human? Can't take his eyes off the princess."

"While humans couldn't appreciate the beauty of our elves, it turns out to be true."

Meanwhile, the thoughts of the elders were transmitted.

They misunderstood, thinking there was some strange misconception because Ryumin glanced at the princess.

"Well, we have busy matters to attend to. We'll take our leave."

Though the elders discreetly stepped back, Ryumin couldn't let them go like that.

"Wait. Aren't you going to ask why I came here?"

"Uh? Why?"

"Wasn't it to meet the princess?"

They waited for the elders' answer with shocked expressions, and Yufinelcia also looked at them with a subtly expectant gaze.

'No need to disappoint the princess.'

Ryumin smiled slightly and said, "Of course, part of the reason was to ensure the princess's safety. After all, who wouldn't worry about a delicate lady who was attacked?"

"Ah."

Yufinelcia blushed.

The comment tailored for the princess, who liked spicy remarks, hit the mark.

"Well, that's one reason, and another reason is to confirm a piece of information."

"Information...?"

"Is it true that Elsorium has a hidden treasure warehouse passed down through generations of elves?"

The elders exchanged glances, as if having made an unintentional agreement, and rolled their eyes.

It was clear that they knew something.

"Where did you hear such information?"
ChatGPT

"The source of the information is not important. What's truly important is why, despite having a treasure warehouse, you concealed it from me."

"H-Hide it? We never intended such a thing. We never even thought about it!"

"Then you can guide me. To where the treasure is."

The elders exchanged glances and reluctantly nodded.

-Where on earth did he hear about the treasure?

-The princess alone isn't enough for him?

-Humans who only emphasize carnal desires are indeed different.

Reading their thoughts, it seemed they were reluctant to reveal the treasure.

"Well, it's understandable. It's the elves' treasure warehouse, preserving centuries of heritage."

Even a hero might find it difficult to willingly give up the treasures stored in the warehouse.

Regardless of alliances and relationships, he was still an outsider.

When Ryumin purposely gave them a disgruntled look, the elders shifted uncomfortably and began to walk.

"Ah, we'll guide you. This way..."

If the reputation wasn't good, they wouldn't have guided him just based on a mention. They would have dismissed it as baseless rumors.

"But I can't go there personally and break the door. That's how the system is set up."

The warehouse is protected by a barrier that cannot be broken by any means, as established by the system, whether in reality or another world.

He had tried it before in a previous episode and knew well that even the mighty Ryumin couldn't open it with sheer strength.

"Here it is."

The place they arrived at, following the elders, was a large stone chamber beneath the palace.

"Inside here lies the history of Elsorium, proving our existence for hundreds of years."

"I'd like to see it."

"Please wait a moment."

The five elders gathered in front of the door and recited an incantation.

Then, a ring of abnormal characters composed of light appeared on the stone door and spun around.

The barrier could only be lifted when the incantations of all five elders were combined.

Gugugugug-

The door opened on its own, and at the same time, a message appeared.

└ Condition ▶ Open the treasure warehouse door with the five elders.

[You have completed the sub-quest!] [You can choose 3 treasures as a reward.]

"Please come in."

Following the elders, Ryumin entered the warehouse.
ChatGPT

Bright and dazzling gems and treasures illuminated the dark chamber.

"Gems, magical swords, armor, spellbooks, artifacts, and more, all sorts of treasures."

As Ryumin eagerly examined the treasures with interest, an elder subtly nudged him.

"These are treasures collected in Elsorium over the past 500 years. Feel free to take any that you fancy."

"Any number?"

"W-Well, yes, but considering that these are items steeped in history, perhaps choosing around three would be suitable..."

The elders hesitated, fearing that Ryumin might demand more, but Ryumin had no such intention.

"I don't need more. Three is sufficient."

Even if he wanted more, it would be impossible according to the system.

"Just choose three."

"Thank you!"

Ryumin, browsing the items, decisively made his selections.

Like someone who had already planned his shopping.

[Selected Rune Fragment of One Hundred Achievements.] [Selected Rune Fragment of Resistance.] [Selected Rune Fragment of Endurance.] [All rewards have been selected.]

Once the three rewards were chosen, Ryumin smiled at the elders.

"I'll go with these."

"You chose the Rune of Magic Power?"

"Ah, an excellent choice."

A sigh of relief appeared on the faces of the elders who were worried he might choose more expensive items.

However, they did not know.

For a player, there was nothing as valuable as Rune Fragments.

Ryumin used all the Rune Fragments to engrave runes on his body.

[Rune of One Hundred Achievements]

Effect: Increases stats by a percentage based on the number of enemies within a radius of 100m. Applies to a maximum of 100 enemies, with an increase of up to 100%.

[Rune of Resistance]

Effect: Increases resistance to status effects by 50%.

[Rune of Endurance]

Effect: Increases resistance to elemental damage by 50%.

After obtaining the three runes, Ryumin grinned.

All three were essential runes on the list.

"I've become even stronger with these."

He was already powerful enough, but since he didn't know what kind of enemies might appear in the future, he couldn't afford to settle here.

"Just as having more money is better, right? Similarly, becoming stronger is never a bad thing."

His business with the elves was now finished.
ChatGPT

"I've seen everything I need to see, so I'll leave."

"Yes."

Exiting the chamber and returning to the surface, Ryumin thought of a certain person and activated his tracking skill.

[Facial and name match confirmed. Tracking the target's location.] [Location of the target 'Russell Daniel' identified.] [Currently 4,395m away.] [To track the target, please follow the arrow in front of you.]

"Now, should I go to the Dwarven village with Russell?"

There, he could both assist Russell's growth and secure high-grade materials in advance.

"I should be going now. I have things to attend to."

"Huh? Ah, are you leaving already?"

"Yeah. Thanks for the tea."

Leaving behind the slightly disappointed Yufenelsia, Ryumin walked out of the palace.

"Emergency."

Fluttering-

As the wings of darkness, extending more than 10m behind him, unfolded, the surprised princess and elders who had come to see him off were taken aback.

"Well, see you next time. Take care until then, Yufenelsia."

"...Y-You too, Black Scythe."

Although Yufenelsia shyly spoke, Ryumin had already flown far away.
