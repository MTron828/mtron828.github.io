Title: The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player - Episode 308

Qualifications of the Demon

"'Damn it, damn it, damn it!'"

Fluctuos muttered curses continuously.

It was because the opponent who couldn't be openly cursed was right in front of him.

'When did you appear? How did you find my location?'

As someone who had raised players from different dimensions, he already knew about tracking skills and how they worked.

'You may know my name, but have you ever seen this face?'

The face shown in the Demon Castle and the current face were different. Therefore, he was confident that finding him with the Black Scythe wouldn't be an easy task.

It was like finding a needle in a haystack.

'But in the end, you got caught...'

His bewildered feelings quickly settled into calmness.

It wasn't because he regained his composure after seeing the cold, lifeless body of Varsago. It was resignation.

He knew that escaping from the Black Scythe was almost impossible.

"Don't be afraid. I just want to have a conversation."

At the mention of conversation, Fluctuos snorted.

[Hmph, don't try to mock me. Who wouldn't know that I came to seek revenge for my comrades?]

"It won't work. As expected of a ruler of the demon realm, you have a sense of caution. You even willingly offer your neck."

Approaching with a smirk, Fluctuos became flustered.

[Hey, wait a moment! Didn't you say you wanted to talk with me just a while ago?]

"We are talking now, aren't we?"

[You act like you're going to kill me...]

'I've already heard everything.'

Not realizing that Fluctuos, with a bewildered expression, had just revealed his inner thoughts, he continued.

[You want information, right? I'll tell you!]

"In return, there must be conditions, right? Probably, you'll ask for my life in exchange for information about Artharos."

[Well, you know well! So...]

"I don't need it."

Fluctuos was momentarily at a loss for words at the unexpected response.

"If you need information, would you try to kill me like this?"

[Well, you'll regret it if you don't listen.]

"Regret is something you'll be doing."

Silent as he was, Fluctuos was still quick-witted.

Perhaps because it truly seemed like an attempt to kill, he drew the branches of the Yulhwa.

"There's no choice! I'll make you my companion on the path to the afterlife... Kuk!"

Before he could swing the whip, Ryu Min's scythe pierced through Fluctuos's heart and came back.

"There's no need for a long speech. You just need to die."

'I wonder what reward will come.'

He knew well that there was no reward for killing demons. Even after defeating all high-ranking demons in the other dimension with the Rune of Light, not a single experience point came in.

However, Ryu Min couldn't help but expect.

'He's a demon lord, so there should be something, right?'

But contrary to his expectations, there was no reward.

The demon lord shouldn't have been here in the first place.

Ryu Min's face quickly cooled.

'Disappointing. He was worse than a monster.'

Monsters at least gave gold and experience points, but the demon lord didn't offer anything like that.

'In a way, it's an expected result. Just like angels.'

Angels weren't originally beings that gave rewards when killed. It was thanks to the Demon's Blessing that enormous rewards came, and without it, not even a handful of experience points would come in.

"Phew. Worthless bastard."

It was disappointing, but Ryu Min overlooked one fact.

The demon lord was undeniably a being with divine-level influence.

As if saying it was too early to be disappointed, a message appeared.

[Confirmed as the player who killed a being with divinity for the first time.] [Acquired the title 'Godslayer.'] [Received 'Purified Aether' as a reward for killing a divine being.]

Ryu Min's eyes widened at the emerging message.

'A title and purified aether too?'

While Fluctuos's main form was a demon, he was undoubtedly a being inheriting the power of the divine.

It seemed that this was recognized by killing a divine being.

Ryu Min, suppressing his surprise, checked the title with a joyful expression.

[Title - Godslayer]

Acquisition Condition: Defeat a being with divinity for the first time.

Effect: All stats double when facing a being with divinity.

Now, when facing a god, his stats would double.

It would also double when facing beings of the divine attribute.
ChatGPT

"'Does that mean it quadruples when facing Artharos?'"

Now, he was confident that he wouldn't be at a disadvantage even when facing Artharos.

With overwhelming stats, he could now overpower him.

"I even obtained Purified Aether, an eternal material. If I make a weapon with this, I can complete my eternal gear."

However, he didn't expect to be able to create more than one.

As always, weapons required two units of Aether.

Satisfied with the fact that he only needed one more to create the weapon, the rewards didn't end there.

└ God Killing

└ Current number of divine beings killed (1/4)

└ Upon success ▶ ????

[The Soul Gauntlet absorbs the soul of the slain divine being.] [The soul 'Fluctuos' has been stored in the gauntlet.] [Extracting the abilities of the soul 'Fluctuos.'] [Extraction successful!] [Learned a new temporary skill 'Qualifications of the Demon!'] [Temporary Skill - Qualifications of the Demon]

Effect: After memorizing a spell for 10 seconds, you can warp to the Demon Castle in the Demon Realm from anywhere.

When warping, if you are holding onto another target, you can move together, and it is also possible to return in the same way.

Additionally, you can easily discern the desires and dark thoughts of others, and when you possess this skill, you receive the same treatment as a noble in the Demon Realm.

"Hooh, to have gained such a skill."

Thanks to the Eternal equipment, the Soul Gauntlet, he obtained a skill he hadn't expected.

'Isn't this the one I saw in the 18th round in the Demon Realm?'

Although he wanted to go there immediately, he paid more attention to the next message.

[Now you can communicate with the soul stored in the gauntlet.] [Communication with the soul can be blocked or changed according to your will, and if desired, the soul can be extinguished.]

'I can talk with the Demon Lord?'

While the body had decayed and crumbled, it seemed that the soul could be extracted.

-Is this how we communicate, Fluctuos?

-This voice...? The Black Scythe?

Ryu Min chuckled at the fact that he remembered his own voice.

-Is this really happening?

-Black Scythe! What happened? Where is this?

-Where do you think this is?
ChatGPT

"The surroundings are filled with damn bright light. It seems like a place resembling a prison of light."

"Oh, really? I can't see, so I don't really know."

"You're the one who trapped me here! How the hell did you do this to me!"

Ryu Min shrugged his shoulders.

"I don't know. I just stabbed and killed you, and it turned out like this?"

"Release me quickly! Let me out of here! Hurry!"

"Oh, you're whining so much."

Annoyed, Ryu Min didn't want to continue the conversation. A chilling silence, as if headphones were removed, settled in, indicating the fearful realization of harboring such feelings.

"I can't hear your voice now that I've decided to block it, huh?"

Ryu Min chuckled and opened the conversation again.

"Fluctuos?"

"...Let me out! Quickly!"

"What did you say?"

"I told you to send me! I've been saying it since earlier!"

"I blocked the conversation, so I didn't hear."

"What? When?"

"Since the first whining."

Fluctuos gave a bitter laugh at the fact that he essentially shouted at a wall.

"Phew, if I leave here, I'll kill you."

"Can you leave?"

"...I will find a way."

"Do you really want to leave that badly?"

"It's a matter of course! I hate this dazzling space the most!"

Well, being a demon, he probably wasn't used to the light.

"I have one way, but I don't know if you'll like it."

"What way?"

"It's called soul annihilation. I can eliminate you if I want... should I do that?"

"What?"

Ryu Min didn't miss the momentary tremor in Fluctuos's voice.

"Couldn't you hear me? I can annihilate your soul."

Fluctuos suddenly fell silent.

Having sensed something, Ryu Min raised the corner of his mouth.

If his face were visible, he would undoubtedly be making an awkward expression.

"Why so quiet? Is the demon lord afraid of annihilation?"

"W-Well, it's only natural to be afraid. Soul annihilation is a process that disassembles the soul's structure at the molecular level. It feels like being skinned from head to toe with a well-sharpened knife."

"How do you know that so well?"

"Well... because I've annihilated other souls before."

"You jerk, seriously."

Ryu Min threw a curse, but Fluctuos didn't respond at all.
ChatGPT

"Perhaps upon hearing the possibility of annihilation, he's holding his tongue."

"Seems like even the demon lord of the world dislikes dying painfully."

Amused by his own laughter, Ryu Min's mischievousness kicked in.

"A bad guy like you should be annihilated without a doubt."

"Hey, wait! Don't annihilate me!"

"Why keep around a noisy guy who whines and talks informally to someone trapped? Erasing you would be better."

"Oh, no. No, no."

His tone quickly changed.

"I'll fix my way of speaking. I won't act noisily. So please don't annihilate me, Black Scythe..."

"Why keep someone unnecessary? You should be annihilated immediately..."

"Uh, if it's information, I'll provide anything. Please ask anything!"

"If I need information, I already know."

"Do you know why Artharos didn't come to this realm?"

"Oh. He sent you just to stock up on power."

"..."

Seeing him fall silent, it seemed that the guess was correct.

It was information Ryu Min read from his inner thoughts before killing him, so it couldn't be unknown.

"Do you know that you brought only the top 10 demons, and you were aiming for the rubbish called Nopheinoge with the horoscope of the god Moros?"

"H-How did you...?"

I can't tell you because it's a trade secret, but the certainty is that there's nothing to gain by keeping you. That's why you need to be annihilated. Understand?"

The word "annihilation" prompted an immediate reaction.

"I-I'll stay quiet! If you want me to be like I'm dead, I will! Please spare me. Th-There's nothing to lose, right?"

"There's nothing to gain."

"No, no. Surely, I'll have something I need in the future. Who knows what the future holds?"

Though it was amusing to see him desperately wagging his tongue to survive, Ryu Min couldn't deny it.

He needed Fluctuos.

"He's necessary for me to use the temporary skill called 'Qualifications of the Demon.'"

If Fluctuos were annihilated, the skill would disappear too.

The existence of the skill was generated because Fluctuos was being held.

"That's why it's written as a temporary skill."

Moreover, since the soul wouldn't escape on its own, there was no harm in keeping it.
ChatGPT

"If I ever deem it unnecessary, I'll just annihilate you."

Ryu Min said with indifference.

"Well, if you plead like that, I'll postpone it a bit."

"Thank you, thank you."

"But if you annoy me even a little, I'll make you feel the pain of immediate torture, so keep that in mind."

"Will there be an opportunity for that? Hehe."

Ryu Min chuckled at the voice that changed its stance like a sycophantic servant.

"If you find it difficult to endure this space of light at any time, just let me know. I'll annihilate you right away."

"Oh, no. Actually, it feels warm and pleasant here, you know. Hahaha..."

Ignoring Fluctuos's awkward laughter, Ryu Min cut off the conversation.

"Let's try using the skill for now. Since the crisis is resolved."

With the thought of checking things out for a moment, Ryu Min activated the skill.

"Demon's Qualification."

[The skill is being cast.] [Canceling the spell if any other action is taken.]

After waiting for 10 seconds.

Swoosh—

Ryu Min's body disappeared like a gust of wind.
