Title: Episode 179 of the 100th Regression for a Max-Level Player

Reward of the Doppelganger

'Black... scythe?'

Siez Kang closely examined the opponent who identified themselves as the Black Scythe.

'Carrying a scythe like a nickname and a Korean player.'

However, since it was the first time he had directly seen the person, he couldn't help but be suspicious.

"You're the Black Scythe?"

"Yeah, you followed me all the way here to find me. Didn't you?"

"How did you...?"

Before Siez Kang could ask, he suddenly turned his head.

"Siez Kang! Watch out!"

It was a desperate situation with subordinates dying right behind him.

"Hey, you punk! Can't you move out of the way?"

"Stop talking and come at me. Why are you just standing there? Scared?"

Despite the opponent's taunts, Siez Kang couldn't recklessly charge in.

'If that guy really is the Black Scythe...'

Could he confront the level 90 Black Scythe one-on-one?

It was because of such assumptions that he couldn't rashly engage in a fight.

Squelch—

With the sound of a neck twisting, the surroundings fell silent.

When Siez Kang turned around, all his subordinates were dead, and the black figure was smiling like a person.

"Damn it. Just dragged out the time for nothing!"

It was because of that guy.

Siez Kang's gaze turned towards the man who blocked his path.

Now there was no choice.

There was no way to retreat.

If there were enemies in front and behind, he had no choice but to break through one side.

He had no choice but to bet on a victory.

'If I have to choose one side to walk, I'll aim for that guy claiming to be the Black Scythe.'

Because he might not be the real Black Scythe.

He might unexpectedly be weak.

Siez Kang's eyes focused on the chosen target.

'Bloody Grip!'

As he reached out, the blood-stained giant's hand grabbed the Black Scythe.

"It's over! Finished!"

He thought he could dodge, but he was caught.

'Now that I've been dragged in, my head will be...'

Siez Kang, who had prepared himself to be beheaded, couldn't continue his train of thought.

The bloody grip held the enemy in place, and he was motionless.

'What's going on? Why is he just standing there...?'
ChatGPT

Upon closer inspection, it wasn't just standing still.

The grip was trembling, exerting all its strength to pull the opponent closer.

The description of the skill to pull the opponent seemed irrelevant.

'What's happening? Why isn't the skill working... Oh!'

Come to think of it, there were cases before where the skill couldn't pull the enemy.

Opponents with high strength stats resisted being pulled and broke free with their strength.

'Does that guy resist my skill with strength?'

Surprised, Siez Kang looked at the Black Scythe, caught in the giant's hand without moving a step.

"How high is his strength..."

As the grip naturally disappeared due to time over, the Black Scythe smirked.

"Why are you surprised? I haven't even received a Blessing."

"Blessing? What nonsense is that?"

"You wouldn't know."

The Black Scythe, who had been mocking, put the scythe into the inventory.

"What are you doing?"

"Just giving you a little hope."

"What?"

"I won't use any weapons or skills. Feel free to attack however you want."

'This guy...'

Not only did he prevent escape, but he also mocked him. If his pride didn't get hurt in this situation, he wouldn't be a man.

"Come on, kill me as you wish."

The scythe turned crimson.

Level 40 skill of the Berserker, Blood Aura.

This aura, which became darker and stronger as more blood was scattered around, had a cutting force that could sever steel like cutting through tofu.

It was a powerful buff skill of the Berserker that ignored the enemy's defense.

However.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

It was only useful when you could hit the enemy.

'Damn it, why isn't it hitting. Why the hell!'

He swung the sword like a madman, but the Black Scythe evaded all the attacks.

It was as if he could read the flow of the sword like water, with flexible movements.

"Blood Aura is nice. It's a lower-grade version of the Aura that Dark Knights have, but well, it's usable in its own way. But what's the use if you can't even hit?"

"Stop babbling and face me, you bastard!"

"You should be the one to face me."

Saying so, the Black Scythe attacked only once.

Thunk!

It was a simple jab.
ChatGPT

However, it was a strike beyond the level of a human, faster than a bullet, something that couldn't be avoided.

"Kuhuhk!"

Siez Kang, who had corn in his mouth, scattered it along with blood and rolled on the ground fiercely.

His consciousness became dizzy, as if he had lost his jaw and been hit by dozens of blows.

"W-What kind of jab..."

To reach such a state with just one jab was an unbelievable power.

"Khehe, you, you bastard..."

"Even if all your teeth fall out, do you still have the strength to curse?"

"I'll kill you..."

He realized the difference in strength, but his pride didn't bend.

He was a high-ranking member and a face of the Black Society.

Bending his pride would be the same as disgracing the Black Society.

"It's not the time to be so proud."

"Huh?"

["Bon appétit. Kikikiki."]

The moment Siez Kang turned around, the Doppelganger infiltrated his body.

Although he felt a sense of regret, it was already too late.

"Cough, cough!"

Strangling his own neck against his will, Siez Kang, with the sound of choking, died within seconds.

└ Condition ▶ Watch Doppelganger kill another prey

└ Current prey killed by Doppelganger (10/10)

[You have completed the sub-quest!] [Points +10,000]

Ryumin, confirming the completion of the reward, raised the corners of her mouth.

A considerable amount of points had been obtained.

It was much more than when she directly killed Chinese people.

'Perhaps Joo Sung-tak also received a reward.'

Now, all that remained was defeating the Doppelganger.

["Kikikikik! It's so delicious; human memories are so tasty!"]

At that moment, the Doppelganger, appearing as a black figure, looked at Ryumin.

["You. Did you deliberately feed me?"]

"...."

["Why the hell did you do that? Did you think I would spare you because I was in a good mood?"]

"It seems like you're having some misunderstanding."

Crackling—

Smirking, Ryumin gathered electricity at her fingertips.

"The one who should beg for mercy isn't me but you."

["Humph, still boasting like that..."]

"Prepare yourself."

Zap!

The released current struck the Doppelganger's body.

["Kyaaaaah!"]

Thrown back several meters with horrific pain, the Doppelganger writhed on the ground like shattered debris.
ChatGPT

"I thought I wouldn't know? Did you think magic damage is nothing to an ethereal monster like you?"

["Kiiieeeeek......"]

"Or maybe you underestimated me, thinking I don't have magic? Well, it doesn't matter. You're about to die soon."

["Kiiieeeeek......"]

'This guy looks like he's about to die right away, judging by his condition.'

Even though he intentionally avoided a fatal blow, the damage was still severe.

'I thought the damage would be lower since he's not in the buffed state of Minjuri, but it's unexpected.'

Regardless, he couldn't just leave him to die in his hands.

Especially with Joo Sung-tak's hands.

"Start."

"Yes, master."

At Ryumin's command, Joo Sung-tak used Corpse Explosion.

Although the skill required a corpse to be present, there was no problem.

There were numerous bodies scattered around from the pushback of the Doppelganger.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Thud!

At the sudden explosive sound, Makyeongrok and An Sang-cheol were startled.

"What's that sound?"

"It sounds like something exploding..."

Judging by the size of the explosion, it had the firepower to burn down the entire forest.

"At this rate, shouldn't we be able to see the flames?"

"That's right. It's just dark, and nothing is visible."

Thinking back, it was indeed a strange forest.

Unable to trace or explore, and the more they walked, the more it felt like they were going in circles.

Like a Möbius strip.

"Agent Ahn, did you hear where that sound came from?"

"It sounded like it was right next to us, as if it happened right beside."

"Is that so? I heard it that way too."

But why could they see nothing except for the trees?

"Well, there's nothing we can do. We have to keep walking. Please follow me so you don't get lost."

"Yes, sir."

The two sighed and had no choice but to continue wandering through the maze.

The effect of the corpse explosion was tremendous.

Thanks to simultaneously exploding ten corpses, the Doppelganger disappeared without a trace.

Usually, at this point, a reward message should appear one after another...

'Unfortunately, I wasn't the one who caught it.'

Since Joo Sung-tak delivered the finishing blow, Ryumin received no messages.
ChatGPT

Only received 12,000 points as a reward for revealing the identity and feeding the quest.

'Joo Sung-tak probably got 20,000 points as a reward for catching the Doppelganger.'

The situation where the slave had more points than the master was okay, but it didn't matter much.

'What's important now is not the points, but the items from the Doppelganger.'

Moreover, she knew more ways to earn points and had confidence in coming in first.

Joo Sung-tak being ahead was only a temporary advantage.

'Anyway, there are 23 hours left. There's plenty of time.'

The 11th round was more like a marathon than a 100m sprint, so there was nothing to worry about.

'Although there is a last-minute reversal at the end.'

Looking at Joo Sung-tak, it seemed he was lost in thought.

It seemed like he was checking messages.

After reading his thoughts for a moment, it was clear that the item Ryumin desired had appeared.

'Fortunately. The ring came out as planned.'

Although Joo Sung-tak took the boss's experience points and points, it was okay.

Since he became her subordinate, his growth was as important as her own.

'In a way, it feels like raising an alt character.'

As she had to bring as many allies as possible in the 20th round, growing together wasn't a bad thing.

'I got rid of the Chinese players who were following me... Now, shall I look into the rest?'

Using Cheonlian, Ryumin turned her gaze towards Makyeongrok and his group.

They seemed surprised by the sudden explosive sound.

'It seems like the sound of corpse explosion reached that far.'

Even though their locations were different, the maze-like forest was interconnected.

As if there was a wall in between.

With this level of explosion, it wouldn't be strange if the sound reached beyond the wall.

'After checking the items a bit, I should go meet them.'

Although the plan was to keep them trapped in the maze, leaving them like this might lead to an escape in a few hours.

'And he'll probably try to kill people as planned to accumulate points.'

Having wasted time in the maze, he must be feeling desperate.

It was obvious that he would roam around to kill players from other countries.

That's how Makyeongrok in the 11th round always operated.

So, it needed to be stopped.

Only she, who knew the future, could prevent it.

'I don't have to kill him, but I need to immobilize him for a while.'
ChatGPT

In the midst of a devilish smile, Joo Sung-tak approached.

"Master, here are the items obtained from the Doppelganger."

Without saying a word, Joo Sung-tak willingly took out the items and presented them.

[Doppelganger's Ring]

Classification: Ring
Grade: Legendary
Effect: Nickname Change (Only usable in the Otherworld)
Durability: 6,000/6,000
Usage Restriction: Expert grade or higher
Description: An item that allows you to freely change your nickname in the Otherworld. Releasing the ring will revert to the original nickname.

'What I wanted has arrived.'

As the description stated, it was an item to change nicknames. With this, there was no need to worry about being tracked by others.

'Now I can impersonate someone else, not just the Black Scythe.'

It was a situation where the authority to change nicknames at will had been obtained.

'Now, not only faces but also nicknames can be changed.'

It became possible to perform perfect disguises.

'And that's not all. Additionally, materials of god-grade have also arrived.'

Ryumin, satisfied with the materials, let out a contented laugh.

Indeed, it was a wise decision to keep Joo Sung-tak alive. Thanks to the [Rune of Drop] he possessed, she obtained the item she desired.

But that was not all.

Ryumin quickly erased her smile and adopted a puzzled expression.

Was Joo Sung-tak taking out another item from the inventory?

"What's this one?"

"This is also an item from the Doppelganger."

Aside from the ring and god-grade materials, there was one more?

As Ryumin took the item, her eyes, initially filled with satisfaction, quickly turned into a surprised gaze.
