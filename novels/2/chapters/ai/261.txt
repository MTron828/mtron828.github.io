Title: The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 261

VS Gabriel

When something unbelievable happens, people tend to doubt themselves first. Ryu Won felt the same way now.

"Am I dreaming? Why does the Black Scythe Lord look like my brother?"

Even though he called it a dream, it was astonishing. More than the fact that a person had changed, it was the resemblance to his own family that shocked him.

"Snap out of it. It's not a dream."

"Brother...?"

"I am the Black Scythe."

Whether his younger brother believed him or not, Ryu Min calmly uttered his words.

"You may know me as a prophet, but my profession is a reaper. My nickname is Black Scythe. I'm sorry for deceiving you all this time."

"..."

"Due to the current situation, I have no choice but to reveal it. To kill those angels over there, I have to unveil my disguise and use my skills."

Ryu Min said so, shifting his gaze to the sky.

Gabriel and Raphael had followed them this far.

"Is it true that you are really the Black Scythe? I can't believe it..."

"Let's discuss the details later. For now, let's deal with them."

Ryu Min, now wearing the helmet of Thanatos, cast the reaper transformation.

[Reaper Transformation has been activated.] [All stats, damage, attack speed, and movement speed increase by 44%.] [All damage received from enemies decreases by 44%.] [The probability of enemies recognizing you decreases by 44%.]

-Strength: 848,108, Intelligence: 850,179

-Agility: 848,108, Luck: 852,379

The stats, which were 580,000, shot up to 850,000.

'Finally, with the Devil's Blessing...'

Preparation to hunt angels was complete.

[Devil's Blessing has been applied.] [Based on the current total stats (3,398,774), the following effects are applied.] [Upon killing an angel, you gain gold equal to 1x the base amount (3,398,774). The maximum increases by up to 1,000x (3,398,774,000) depending on the angel's level.] [Upon killing an angel, you gain stat points equal to 0.01% of the base amount (339).]

According to the angel's level, it can increase up to a maximum of 10% (339,877). When an angel is defeated, the reputation of the demon faction slightly increases. The buff persists until the end of the current round.

Confirming the applied buff, Ryu Min raised his gaze, revealing the descending Archangels.

"I'll be right back. Just wait here."

"..."

With only those words thrown to his younger brother, he walked away briskly.

The approaching Archangels, who had been smiling while looking at the approaching dark figure, soon recognized his identity as they saw the shape of the scythe.

"Black Scythe? I almost didn't recognize you for a moment with the change." "Judging by the aura, it seems like you used some skill. But that won't make a difference."

Gabriel, grinning, seemed self-assured. This time, it seemed they were planning to join forces properly to exploit weaknesses.

"You've been through a lot trying to escape until here. Now, I'll easily take care of you."

"If you think targeting my brother gives you an advantage..."

A devilish smile appeared on Ryu Min's lips.

"When I decide, it won't take more than 10 seconds to kill you."

"Boasting in moderation..."

Gabriel's eyes widened in an instant.

The foresight showed him his own death.

"Gah!"

Gasping for breath, he dodged with a desperate face.

Avoiding the future of death, he flew up into the sky.

"G-Gabriel, sir?"

As he moved away like someone frightened by his superior, Raphael was bewildered.

He confidently declared that he could kill the Black Scythe this time, but now he retreats?

Again, in Gabriel's eyes, the future 3 seconds later was revealed.

A grim future of falling with wings severed.

Just 3 seconds away from the future.

Now, only 2 seconds remained.

Without time to think, he changed direction.

But even this time, the repeated result continued to show in front of him.

Death, death, death.

He struggled to escape the future but couldn't break free.

The predetermined death could not be changed.

Flash!

He frowned at the dazzling light.

"Ugh!"

Upon opening his eyes, the Black Scythe was right in front of him.

He had no chance to realize that he was drawn to the Black Scythe.

Swish!

Dozens of wings were swiftly severed as they crashed to the ground.

Thud!

A dull thud and pain were felt, but compared to what would happen later, it was nothing.

Whooosh!
ChatGPT

[Grgh!]

The Dagger of Darkness pierced his limbs like chains, frighteningly so.

Whoosh!

[Ughhh!]

Following, Ryu Min's scythe pierced through Gabriel's abdomen as he landed.

Thud thud thud thud...

[Ugh, Ugh!]

Once, twice, thrice... ten times.

Every part except the head and heart had holes pierced through.

[Cough, hahaha...]

Gabriel had no strength left to resist, let alone move.

Raphael, too, shared the same fate. With magical power loss beyond what they could endure, Raphael wiped the blood flowing down his mouth with a frown.

"The claim of being able to kill in 10 seconds wasn't a bluff. The impact was no joke."

Although he squeezed out the remaining magical power to protect Gabriel, it was used up too quickly.

Now, there wasn't even enough magical power left to chant a resurrection spell.

Helplessly lying down, Raphael felt despair as he looked at Gabriel.

If the dealer is the first to fall, what hope is there for the support?

"I need to call for reinforcements."

Even if it seems ridiculous, they must escape.

At this point, anticipating the future is the only option.

Humming to himself, Ryu Min silently cast a teleportation spell to return without being noticed.

10 seconds.

Concentrate for just 10 seconds, and he can escape to heaven.

Whoosh!

[Kyaaah!]

"Where do you think you're going?"

Extending his scythe, Ryu Min stabbed Raphael's thigh, who was still trying to chant a spell.

Looking at the struggling one still trying to chant the spell, Ryu Min sighed.

"Gabriel, say your farewells."

Thud!

"Off you go to heaven first."

As he pierced the heart, Raphael's mouth finally stopped moving.

Plump!

As Raphael collapsed powerlessly, Gabriel's eyes widened.

[Ah, you damn demon. A bastard worse than a demon!]

"Do you still have the strength to curse?"

Ignoring the reward message that appeared in his retina, Ryu Min shifted his gaze to Gabriel, who now only had his upper body remaining.

"Do you know something? We call your angels demons."

[A cursed bastard like a worm! What have we done so wrong to deserve this!]

"What did you do wrong?"

Ryu Min felt a bit disheartened.

He cleaned up the trash, and now he's being scolded for cleaning it up?
ChatGPT

"Do you not know that? You forced 1.8 billion people to participate in a death game, and you're asking what you did wrong?"

"Instead, didn't you put a reward on it? If you conquer 20 rounds, we'll grant you one wish! Moreover, you pitiful humans are enjoying the power of a system that you couldn't even dream of!"

"...."

Ryu Min remained silent for a while. It felt like a situation where you commit a crime and then scold the police for giving you work.

"Even if you consider it an honor, why point your swords at the angels who gave you a chance? You insolent bastards who wouldn't even flinch if thrown into sulfur flames!"

"Can't you see the situation since you've lost your mind?"

Whoosh!

[Aaargh!]

"There's still plenty left to stab, you know?"

Gabriel, writhing in pain, had clear and lively eyes, despite the suffering.

"Hah, you'll regret this. If you kill me, Archangel Michael won't let you go."

"Isn't it the same even if I don't kill you?"

[....]

"If I spare you, do you think Michael will just sit still?"

As if struck to the core, Gabriel groaned and muttered.

"In that case, kill me. Archangel Michael will avenge me for you."

"If I kill that guy called Michael, it'll be over, won't it?"

[....]

"I'll regret it. If you kill Michael, he'll come after you for my revenge."

"Who? God?"

Gabriel's eyes widened in surprise. It seemed he was unaware of the ability to read thoughts.

"Come anytime you want. I'll kill anyone who comes."

[You're quite arrogant, human. Well then, you and your comrades won't survive. It'll be challenging for you to pass even this round.]

"We'll see about that."

A mocking smile appeared on Gabriel's lips.

[Hehe, you placed a 1st-grade combat angel on the island, but the humans think they can stop it? Ridiculous.]

"Wait, 1st-grade? Isn't it 6th-grade?"

Ryu Min was surprised as he read Gabriel's thoughts. It was true. During the last 6th-level summoning, he arranged for 1st-grade combat angels to appear.

Gabriel, however, was surprised for a different reason.

[You knew that combat angels would intervene during the 6th-level summoning? Because of the special reward choice box... ugh!]

Ryu Min's scythe pierced Gabriel's heart.

This wasn't the time for chit-chat.
ChatGPT

[You have defeated the Archangel 'Gabriel'!] [Stat Points +237,913] [Gold +2,379,141,800] [As a reward for defeating Archangel Gabriel, 'Purified Ether' has been obtained.] [As a reward for defeating Archangel Gabriel, 'Rune of Chains' has been obtained.] [The acquired rune is automatically imprinted on the player's body!] [The reputation of the demon faction has significantly increased.] [The demon's reputation for the Black Scythe has risen from 'Very Friendly' to 'Eternal Alliance.']

Thanks to the Devil's Blessing, both stats and gold increased significantly.

"Stats totaling 230,000 and 23 billion gold... Truly, there's nothing like the Devil's Blessing."

The reputation that had dropped after defeating the Avatar of Pluvictos in the 14th round also rose again.

Satisfied in many ways, there was still a lingering question due to a new item.

"What's this? Purified Ether? Not Condensed Ether?"

Since it was the first time defeating the top Archangels, this item was unfamiliar.

Ryu Min decided to check the previous message for confirmation.

[You have defeated the Archangel 'Raphael'!] [Stat Points +203,926] [Gold +2,039,264,400] [As a reward for defeating Archangel Raphael, 'Purified Ether' has been obtained.] [As a reward for defeating Archangel Raphael, 'Rune of Knight's Revival' has been obtained.] [The acquired rune is automatically imprinted on the player's body!]

"Purified Ether also came out as a reward for defeating Raphael, right?"

Regardless, he would confirm it later. He had received information that 1st-grade combat angels would appear on the island where players were gathering.

"Clairvoyance."

Closing his eyes, Ryu Min used the temporary skill, Clairvoyance.

He saw players engaged in battle with monsters on the remote island.

"The 4th summoning has just started now."

It meant there was still one hour until the 6th summoning when the combat angels would appear.

In other words, players had to fly over 4,000 km to the remote island within an hour.

"Otherwise... the followers of the Sasin Religion will die."

Currently, even if all the followers of the Sasin Religion gathered, they wouldn't be able to handle the 1st-grade combat angels.
