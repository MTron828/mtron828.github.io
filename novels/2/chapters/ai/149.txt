Title: Episode 149 of the 100th Rebirth of a Max-Level Player

Alba Gudaddy

Thump!

Victor doubted his own eyes.

Abubakar, the boss of Boko Haram who had tormented him for a year, was trembling under his feet, having turned into a pile of ashes.

Looking at him, teeth scattered and blood flowing, Victor felt no sympathy. Instead, he felt an urge to commit murder, as if this was his chance.

"This is not the time to kill him yet."

A savior wearing a white mask spoke in English. Judging by the voice, it sounded like a man, but Victor couldn't determine the nationality.

Victor expressed his gratitude first, "Thank you very much. Thanks to you, Ricky and the kids are safe. Ricky, you should thank him too."

"Thank you, thank you."

Watching Ricky shyly express gratitude, Ryu Min thought, 'Seeing this child for the first time, it seems like he was originally destined to die.' Without Victor's intervention, he would have died without a doubt.

Did the tension dissipate when Victor and the kids greeted them? People who had kept their distance until a while ago approached Ryu Min and expressed gratitude.

"Thank you, Masked Sir."

"Thank you for saving our lives."

"Thank you for taking care of those trash."

Reading their thoughts, Ryu Min realized that they saw him as a complete ally. Not only did he kill all the Boko Haram members, but he also captured their boss. Who wouldn't consider him an ally after that?

The eyes of those looking at Ryu Min were filled with deep admiration and liking.

At that moment, Victor, representing everyone, asked a curious question.

"Masked Sir, may I ask your name?"

"...."

"Ah, I understand that it's difficult to reveal. That's why you're wearing a mask. However, please consider our position. If you don't know the name of the one who saved your life, wouldn't you hold a grudge for a lifetime? If it's too difficult, at least tell us your nickname."

"Black Scythe. That's my nickname."

"Ah...!"

Other people didn't recognize him as an ordinary person, but when Victor heard that name, he couldn't hide his astonishment.

"Um, are you really Black Scythe?"

"Do I look like someone who would lie?"

"Oh, it's not that. It's just so hard to believe..."

To have a famous figure known only to players right in front of him, and as the savior who saved his life? It was natural that Victor found it hard to believe.

"To meet the rank 1 Black Scythe... It's an honor. I am Victor Japaille, a player, and a level 40 alchemist."

"Is that so?"

Even though Ryu Min already knew his identity, he responded nonchalantly.

"But what was that about not killing him yet?"

"It means he still has some utility. We need to use him to draw out the leader of IS through him."

"The leader?"

Despite being held captive by Boko Haram for a year, Victor didn't know who the leader of IS was. The leader of a terrorist organization hides their identity, making it difficult to find their headquarters, and Victor wasn't aware of who the leader was.

"What do you plan to do..."

"I plan to send a message. Along with this guy's picture. Let's throw a bait while we're at it."

After taking a picture of the now lifeless Abu Bakr, Ryu Min searched for the contact information of the IS leader through a message. He already knew who the leader was from a previous episode.

'I did send a message saying that this guy was being attacked.'

Thinking it was a good opportunity, he sent the picture along with the message.

[Abu Bakr: He lost. If you want to save him, come here immediately.]

Seeing the message, Victor smirked.

"Is this person the leader of IS?"

"Yes."

"How did you...?"

"I just know."

"No, but rather than that, do you think he'll come just because we sent this? Wouldn't he refuse to come, if anything?"

The calm IS leader wouldn't be swayed by such threats. Especially when it came to replacing the boss of Boko Haram.

That was the reasoning behind Victor's question, and Ryu Min agreed with him.

However, Ryu Min had confidence.

"He will respond. Definitely. In fact, he might even find it interesting."
ChatGPT

In the previous episode, he had exposed the leader, Alba Gudaddy, in a similar manner.

Sure enough, a message popped up.

[Alba Gudaddy: Wait there.]

Perhaps hearing the name Black Scythe sparked interest, but knowing that he alone had dismantled the organization increased the curiosity.

"Um, there's really a response."

Victor opened his eyes in surprise after reading the message.

However, he quickly turned worried.

"Do you mean to wage war against IS?"

"Once it has started, we have to uproot all IS members."

"Isn't it too dangerous?"

"Me? Or those guys?"

Victor chuckled at Ryu Min's confident words.

It didn't come across as boasting or arrogance. He was undoubtedly a man with enough power and qualifications.

"I worried for nothing."

"Victor, what will you do now?"

In response to Ryu Min's question, Victor said firmly, "I have to go back to my hometown, Lagos. If I go now, I'll see my family after a year."

Ryu Min nodded and gestured towards the outside.

"Hurry, go. Leave it to me."

As if saying he would send him away without hesitation.

Of course, Ryu Min, having read his inner thoughts, knew Victor wouldn't leave.

"Why aren't you going?"

"I will watch. I need to see what fate the demons who tormented you will face until the end."

"What about the others? Do you all share Victor's thoughts?"

People hesitated at Ryu Min's question but soon nodded.

"Honestly, we don't want to stay here for a moment, but if Victor stays, we will stay too."

"We'll stay and see what happens to IS."

Their resolute determination and courage were admirable, but Ryu Min quietly shook his head.

Considering the upcoming battles, they would only become a burden.

"Victor is a player, so it might be okay, but you all are civilians. Staying at IS's stronghold, where a stray bullet could lead to wandering in the crossfire. It's dangerous, so please return immediately. You can hear the results on the news."

"Umm..."

Since there was no wrong in his words, there was no one to argue against them.
ChatGPT

Honestly, they didn't want to stay in such a dangerous place. Especially with the IS leader expected to arrive? They felt the urge to run downhill as quickly as possible. However, they hesitated to answer due to the loyalty to Victor.

Victor, realizing this fact, smiled and said, "Black Scythe is right. You shouldn't stay here. It's too dangerous. Before IS arrives, please return to your hometown as soon as possible. Shouldn't you also take care of the kids here?"

"Well, saying it like that, we understand."

"Victor, thank you so much for treating and protecting us."

"No, I haven't done anything."

"No, thanks to you, we were able to endure."

"Thank you for saying that. Oh, Mr. Marcus! You mentioned living in Lagos, right? Could you please take care of the kids until I return? Many of them have lost their parents and have nowhere to go."

"If that's the case, don't worry. I'll take responsibility and send the kids back to their parents. I have been taking care of the parentless kids."

"Thank you, Mr. Marcus. There are many cars underneath, so you can take any of them when you leave."

"Got it. Let's meet again alive."

"Haha, yes."

"Well then, we'll be going."

"We'll learn about what happens to IS through the news. Hopefully, there will be good results..."

"Please take care. All of you."

"Let's go, kids."

14 adults and 10 children began to leave the stronghold.

Ricky, who had been glancing back, couldn't hold back and ran into Victor's arms.

"Sob, Mister. Can we meet again?"

"Kid, of course. I'll be waiting at Mr. Marcus's house. I'll come right away after the job is done."

"Yes. You must come."

Having patted Ricky's head, Victor sent him off.

Ricky, who had looked back several times, became so distant that he couldn't be seen.

'Ricky, go down safely.'

There were many organization cars below the hill, so there shouldn't be any problem with them escaping.

Victor turned to Ryu Min and Yanti.

"We have a chance of winning, right?"

"Well, of course."
ChatGPT

Ryu Min confidently spoke, but Victor couldn't shake off his unease. After all, there was no way the leader of IS would appear empty-handed.

"My profession is an alchemist."

Victor took various vials from his inventory and offered them to Ryu Min.

"Take them. They will help in the battle."

"Thank you, but I'll pass. It's not necessary to go this far."

"Still, it's good to strengthen yourself a bit..."

"Trust me. If I thought I would fall behind someone like IS, I wouldn't have started."

Even after saying so, Victor had no choice but to put the vials back with an anxious expression on his face.

With faces full of uncertainty, Ryu Min, Yanti, Victor, and the turned-to-ashes Abu Bakr entered the building, waiting for the enemy to reveal themselves.

They waited until the sun set, the night arrived, and dawn with twinkling stars came, but somehow, the leader of IS did not appear.

'Perhaps everything went well?'

Victor, who was waiting and reminiscing about those who had left exhausted from waiting, turned his head at a tapping sensation.

"Here they come."

"They're here?"

Upon regaining consciousness, he heard the sound of several vehicle engines.

He went outside the building and looked down the hill.

People were getting off dozens of trucks one after another.

Ryu Min activated his exploration skill, looking at the increasing red dots.

'They've gathered quite a lot.'

Urrrr- Victor was shocked as numerous organization members gathered at the stronghold.

'This, how many people are these?'

With just a glance, there were over three hundred people entering the stronghold.

Ryu Min signaled Yanti with a gesture.

"Stay with Victor inside the building. Release Abu Bakr outside."

"Yes, Black Scythe."

Following Ryu Min's instructions, Yanti brought out the hostage she had tied up, while Victor and Yanti closed the door.

Meanwhile, Victor observed the situation through the window.

He saw organization members surrounding Ryu Min.

'This is bad. The numbers are too many.'

Victor, who hadn't expected this many to show up, looked at Ryu Min's contemplative face.

"Black Scythe, are you okay? There are too many of them..."

To be continued...

"I don't know what you're saying. It's frustrating. You should either learn English or something."

Looking at Yanti grumbling, Ryu Min turned his gaze back outside.

Almost the entire force had gathered, and an uncountable number of people surrounded Ryu Min.

Shuffling through the crowd, a bearded man stepped forward.

"Who is Black Scythe?"

"It's me."

Ryu Min, wearing a white mask, confidently replied.

"So, you're Black Scythe?"

"Yeah."

"Nice to meet you. I am Abu Ibrahim Ash-Shami Al-Baghdadi, the leader of IS."

"Is that so?"

"Well, I came as you asked. Release Abu Bakr."

"But you didn't come alone, did you?"

"When did I say I came alone?"

"I thought you would come alone since you're holding one of my subordinates captive."

"Your head is filled with flower gardens. Did you think I would sacrifice myself to save one of your subordinates?"

"..."

"If you mess with IS, you should have been prepared for this. Surely, seeing this force didn't scare you?"

"Scared by these guys? No way."

Ryu Min smirked.

Of course, he had expected them to come like this.

"It's probably you who got scared, Mr. Fake Al-Baghdadi."

"..."

At that moment, the opponent's shoulders twitched momentarily.

He didn't show it, but it was visible.

He was internally confused and disoriented.

Naturally, that guy was just an actor pretending to be Al-Baghdadi.

He wasn't the real one.

"To deceive, you have to observe people. Did you think I would recognize your face and call you? Did you expect me to be fooled by lining up subordinates and setting up a decoy?"

"What nonsense..."

"I know everything that's hidden. Stop hiding and come out quickly. I'll listen to what you're babbling about."

"What ridiculous talk is this? I am the leader of IS..."

That's when it happened.

"Enough. Stop the act!"

A middle-aged man walked forward from the crowd.

Ryu Min's eyes changed upon seeing him.

He was the real Al-Baghdadi, the leader of IS, as Ryu Min remembered.
