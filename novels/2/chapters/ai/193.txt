Title: The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player, Episode 193

Grasp of Death

"You did very well."

First Warrior, who patted the traitor on the head as if dealing with an obedient dog, asked, "What's your name?"

"I-it's Kang Sihyuk..."

"Good. Since you did as ordered, I'll spare your life."

"Th-thank you! Th-thank y..."

"However, stay here until the Black Scythe arrives."

"What?"

"We have no way to confirm whether you lied or not. At least stay until the Black Scythe arrives."

He couldn't withstand their threats and betrayed the captain, but now he had to face them directly.

With a pale face, Kang Sihyuk stuttered in continuation, "Y-you said you'd let me go if I did as you ordered."

"So, I'm still giving orders now."

"Y-you must have overheard it from the side. It's definitely about the Black Scythe."

"I don't speak Korean. How would I know what you said and who you talked to?"

"This is different from our agreement... Ahh!"

First Warrior's finger pressed firmly on his knee, rendering him unable to move as if trapped in a massive press.

It was an enormous force.

"If the yellow monkey says to do something, you do it. Why is your tongue so long? Should I make sure you never walk again?"

"K-kuhuhuhuk..."

"If you don't want to face a miserable death from us, survive even if you have to sell out your boss. That's the instinct for survival, isn't it, the true mentality of a monkey?"

"A-alright, I understand. Just let me go... Ugh!"

Instead of releasing his knee, First Warrior's large hand struck Kang Sihyuk on the back of the head.

"You scum. Tsk."

With a sword as large as his stature hanging on his shoulder, First Warrior turned to look at his 12 apostle comrades.

"Did you make contact?"

"We called both teams, so they should be coming this way."

"We need to arrive before the Black Scythe does..."

To the concern of the top swingman in India, First Warrior chuckled with a sarcastic smile.

"Why worry about that? Once the Black Scythe arrives, we just need to smash that bastard's head first."

"For a country of gentlemen, your choice of words is quite vulgar."
ChatGPT

"Who says that? England is known as the country of gentlemen."

"Are you confident? Being level 90 wouldn't be easy to deal with, right?"

"I'm a Sword Master. There's no one I can't kill with a single stroke of my sword. I even killed the Minotaur in one blow."

"Why hasn't such a person made it into the top 3 of the entire region so far?"

"Well, that's because I've been too careless in my strategies so far. Just wait and see who climbs to the top of the rankings from now on."

The self-assured appearance of the First Warrior made the Swingman excitedly nod his head.

"Instead of that, when the Black Scythe arrives, stall for time through conversation. Until the other apostles arrive. Since we have hostages, that might be better, right?"

"What are you talking about? Splitting the pie that has rolled in with others?"

"Is it a pie that can be eaten? It's not a poisoned pie, is it?"

"We can easily kill the Black Scythe even with just the four of us, right? And we have hostages, too."

"It's not allowed."

"Is it allowed?"

Watching the two arguing, Kang Sihyuk was momentarily surprised when First Warrior looked at him.

"Should I ask this guy? Hey, yellow monkey. If the Black Scythe and I were to face off, who do you think would win?"

"Yes?"

"Why are you asking dumb questions? Can't you understand English? If we were to face off one-on-one, who do you think would win? You, being a squad member, should know. The skills of the squad leader."

Of course, he knows.

Everyone in the squad knows from the first day they dueled.

How monstrous the squad leader is.

But in Kang Sihyuk's eyes, the man in front of him was the true monster.

Perhaps that's why he couldn't honestly answer.

"Be honest, tell the truth."

"W-well, the Black Scythe..."

"..."

"...is weaker than you think. With your skills, you could probably win."

"See! Did you see that? Surprisingly weak, right? That's what I thought too."

"Why are you asking this kind of guy? Can't you see he's scared of you right now?"

"No, no. He spoke honestly. Right?"

"Y-yes..."

First Warrior's hand went up to Kang Sihyuk's chin on his shoulder.

"The Black Scythe will be here soon. We'll be preparing for a surprise attack, so you just attract attention for a while."
ChatGPT

"Yes? M-me?"

"Why? Don't want to?"

The grip on his shoulder slowly tightened.

Kang Sihyuk quickly nodded.

"Oh, no. I'll, I'll do it."

"That's right. That's what you should do. Just in case you think of seeking help from the Black Scythe or attempting to escape, do you know what will happen?"

First Warrior threatened, showing off his large sword in an ignorant manner.

"You'll be dead on the spot along with the Black Scythe. Escape? If you think that's possible against the four of us, you're mistaken. You might not know, but we're the top-tier players who casually take the first place in our country."

"Ah..."

"So, behave yourself. If you handle the situation well, we'll spare you."

"R-really... Are you really sparing me?"

"Of course. Releasing a small fry like you is not a difficult task for us. If things go well, we promise to spare you."

"T-then I understand."

"Good, good. We'll be expecting it."

First Warrior patted his shoulder and hid with his comrades.

They scattered, taking positions and waited for the Black Scythe to appear.

After waiting for about five minutes, unfamiliar footsteps echoed in the quiet alley.

It was the entrance of the Black Scythe.

"C-captain..."

"Kang Sihyuk?"

The Black Scythe, seen after a long time, appeared wearing the usual white mask.

Due to that, Kang Sihyuk couldn't know that he was smiling behind the mask.

"Yeah, what's the reason for asking to meet here?"

"I, I want to discuss... something."

"What is it?"

"W-well, that's..."

Even though his tense face and sweating made it suspicious to anyone who looked, the Black Scythe listened silently.

Was that appearance even more suspicious?

"That guy noticed us."

First Warrior, who had been lurking, revealed himself first.

"Hey, are you the Black Scythe? It seems so, considering you're holding a scythe."

Approaching with his large sword, the other apostles couldn't help but reveal themselves with a sigh.

Stopping ten paces away, First Warrior asked with a smirk.

"Do you know how to speak English?"
ChatGPT

"..."

"Well, even if you don't know, it doesn't matter. You'll get the gist even if we can't communicate. You're in deep trouble now."

"..."

"If you want to go without pain, drop the weapon. If not, I'll kill you as painfully as possible. I promise to torture you until you scream like a woman before killing you."

Although he openly provoked, the Black Scythe remained unresponsive.

'Look at this guy. He should have understood by now, right? Is he really unable to understand English?'

A disappointed sigh escaped from First Warrior's mouth.

The strategy to excite the opponent and cloud their judgment seemed to have failed.

"Hey, guys. Talking doesn't seem to work."

Despite the four men approaching with weapons, Ryu Min casually looked at Kang Sihyuk and asked, "Who are these guys? Your friends?"

"W-well..."

At this moment, Kang Sihyuk was faced with the dilemma of a lifetime. Whether to beg directly to the Black Scythe for mercy or hide behind those monsters who had threatened him.

'Will the squad leader forgive me? No, he won't. He won't spare me, that cold-hearted person. Maybe it's better to side with those guys... But what if they can't handle the squad leader?'

Trying to weigh which side to align with for his survival, Kang Sihyuk couldn't easily find an answer.

"Can you explain what's going on here?"

"W-well, sir... it's, it's like this. I had no choice but to lure you into a trap."

Kang Sihyuk's head drooped deeply.

"Are you trying to lure me into a trap?"

Tears of repentance rolled down Kang Sihyuk's face as he sobbed, "I'm sorry. I had no other choice to survive. I'm truly sorry, sir... Huhuhuk."

Kang Sihyuk shed tears of repentance, but there was no change in Ryu Min's voice.

"Sorry won't cut it. I'm even more sorry."

"Huk... Yes?"

The gleam of Ryu Min's scythe flashed.

Kang Sihyuk's head tilted, falling to the ground.

Along with that, the body of one of the twelve apostles behind him slid down as if cut smoothly.

Thud-

"There won't be any pain."

The rest of the apostles stared in horror at the scene.

Fear.

The emotion they just felt was fear.
ChatGPT

It was because the title of "Massacre Expert" that Ryu Min held had struck an abnormal state in the witnesses.

Of course, they regained their senses after three seconds.

"T-that crazy guy killed a fellow squad member..."

"I didn't kill a squad member; I killed a traitor."

From the moment Kang Sihyuk received the lure phone call, he became a traitor. Even if he was threatened, traitors couldn't be spared. Following that principle, Ryu Min executed him on the spot, along with the 12 apostles who were behind him.

"Hey, you. Can you speak English?"

"I haven't said that I can't."

"..."

First Warrior, in response to Ryu Min's answer, fell into a silent disbelief. But in reality, he was trying to calm his shocked heart.

"This guy kills people without a word... "

Not only his fluent English but also his sudden actions had surprised him.

The other apostles felt the same, their hearts pounding.

"He killed a squad member without mercy just because he betrayed..."

"The operation to use him as a hostage has failed."

His ruthless judgment and coldness were terrifying, but what was even scarier was something else. It was the fact that no one could see when he attacked.

"If I were behind that monkey, I might have been helpless..."

Ignoring the thoughts of his startled colleagues, First Warrior approached.

He had already prepared his sword to attack at any moment.

"Hey, killing someone just because you played a threat as a joke? The top-ranked player turns out to be a psycho?"

"A threat as a joke?"

Ryu Min behind the mask let out a scoff.

"Did you think you could brush it off like that? The 12 apostles?"

"..."

The expressions of the 12 apostles stiffened like stone.

It was only natural since he had figured out their identities without telling anyone.

"Did you think I joined a ridiculous organization called the Messiah, where rankers from various countries gathered just to restrain me? Passing dogs would laugh at that."

"How did you find out?"

"What's important now is not that."

As his words ended, Ryu Min's scythe extended like a whip and returned.

Swish- Thud!

A member of the 12 apostles, who hadn't even seen the weapon move, fell with a hole in his leather armor.
ChatGPT

Thunk-

The moment a corpse appeared, Ryu Min's comrades were taken aback.

First Warrior and Swingman, who had no time to react, swallowed nervously.

"That... That's the top-ranked player?"

"He's a monster. Absolutely a monster."

There was no chance of dealing with the speed they had just witnessed. In their minds, there was only one thought—to somehow escape this situation.

"The Sword Master from England, First Warrior. The Martial Artist from India, Swingman. Now, only you two are left?"

"..."

"Why stay silent? Whether you fight or run away, you'll have to struggle, right?"

"What the fuck!"

The first to leave the scene was First Warrior. With agile movements that defied his massive build, he leaped and aimed to escape to the rooftop of the building.

But thoughts alone couldn't change the situation.

"The Grasp of Death."

As Ryu Min aimed the skill at First Warrior's backside, the elongated black hand of death wrapped around First Warrior's waist.

"Let go! Let go!"

"Come here. Let's play together."

The self-assured expression on First Warrior's face disappeared as the elongated black hand of death pulled him closer.

There was no trace of the confident warrior; only a creature dragged into the slaughterhouse in terror.

Squelch-

Caught by the Grasp of Death, First Warrior's head was cleanly severed.

In the meantime, the remaining apostle, Swingman, managed to escape a fair distance. However, Ryu Min remained composed.

There was no cooldown for the Grasp of Death.
