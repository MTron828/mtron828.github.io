Title: Episode 255 - Their Secret

On the way to Incheon Airport to meet Kristin,

Ryumin received an important phone call.

"Kristin suspects me?"

-Yes. I heard it directly from Jeffrey.

The content suggested that the Prophet and the Black Scythe might be the same person.

"Understood. I'll handle the rest."

-Okay. Take care, Master.

"Such nonsense."

Ryumin chuckled after hanging up the phone.

But then, he pondered as if realizing something.

'Kristin suspected me.'

This was definitely not a trivial matter.

'How did it get exposed? I haven't done anything suspicious lately... Ah!'

Suddenly, a scene flashed in his mind.

The moment he killed the three thugs targeting Kristin with a dagger of darkness.

Other than that incident, he hadn't done anything suspicious.

'Did I not sleep well? I thought she couldn't read my thoughts...'

He had been cautious, but it seemed she found out somehow.

The murder he committed himself.

'It's awkward. It's not good for anyone to find out about my identity...'

After maintaining a double life for so long, admitting to being the same person was not ideal.

Wouldn't there be a sense of betrayal?

Maybe Kristin would turn her back on him.

Not being able to rely on Kristin meant missing an opportunity for resurrection.

Considering it's the final regression, Kristin's abilities are crucial.

Admitting his identity would undoubtedly create distance between them.

He had to deny it somehow.

'The problem is what excuse to use...'

Ryumin was lost in thought until he arrived at the airport.

He couldn't come up with a suitable excuse.

'Just denying it is the only option. If necessary, I can use the memory erasure potion...'

Though it's regrettable to use it for such a thing, he has two of them.

Wouldn't it be okay to use one?

"Sigh... I don't know. Let's get some sleep."

However, Ryumin couldn't catch a wink until he arrived in the United States.

"Kristin."

"Black Scythe, sir!"

Even though Kristin welcomed him with a friendly face wearing a mask, Ryumin knew.

'True. When I read her thoughts, it became clear that her mind is filled with suspicion.'

Contrary to appearances, her heart was full of doubt.

'She's suspecting that I might be the Prophet.'

Not only that, but she seemed uneasy, perhaps having witnessed the murder.

She might be worried that he's a psychopath who kills innocent people like Makyeongrok.

'It might seem that way, considering I casually killed three ordinary people while pretending to be weak.'

Reading her thoughts, he felt that she somewhat understood the reason for the killings.

Since he pointed a gun at her, he killed in self-defense.

However, it seemed she didn't know the details beyond a superficial glance.

"Was your journey comfortable?"

"It was."

In truth, he couldn't sleep a wink due to worry.

"I could have come to pick you up..."

"It's fine. I had some free time."

"We shouldn't stay here. It's not the time for worship, and it's good for a conversation."

Although Kristin led the way, guiding him toward the chapel, Ryumin stopped her.

"No, a spacious place like the chapel won't do. The conversation might leak out. I prefer a quieter place."

"Oh, if that's the case..."

After hesitating for a moment, Kristin answered.

"I have a room... Would you like to go there?"

"Sure."

Soon, they arrived at a cozy room with an attached bathroom, following Kristin.

"Here, this is my room."

"Neat."

Was she feeling awkward for bringing a man into her personal space?

As if instructing Kristin to listen, Ryumin spoke.

"But there's only one chair."

"Huh? Oh, right. Well, please wait here. I'll bring another chair."

Kristin quickly disappeared and soon returned with a chair.

"Please, have a seat."

Before Ryumin sat down, he closed the door.

As the door locked, Kristin's ears turned red.

In the confined space, the presence of a man and a woman together created a peculiar atmosphere.

However, it was merely Kristin's own misconception.

"Do you know why I came?"

"Um... you came to share strategies for the 16th round..."

"Besides that, there's another reason."

"What is it?"

"To explain myself."

The moment Kristin heard those words, her heart raced.

'He knows? He suspects me?'

Kristin, shocked and taken aback, misunderstood.

Ryumin's explanation was not what she thought.

"I'm explaining about invoking John Delgado, not that."

"Oh..."

Realizing it was a different explanation, Kristin couldn't help but look curious.

"I was already surprised. You saved John Delgado in the 15th round... I even thought you might have forgotten about our relationship."

"As if. I'm the one who saved you from that guy."

"Then why did you save someone you were planning to kill?"

Ryumin honestly revealed.

"John Delgado is my subordinate."

"What?"

"I recently dominated him using domination magic."

Although it was a challenge request, it seemed like enslavement.

"Why...?"

"I heard from the Prophet that the abilities of a sorcerer would be helpful in the future. So, I kept him alive. There's no other reason."

While the prophecy was false, the idea that the sorcerer's abilities could be useful was true.

Kristin seemed to somewhat understand.

"Did the undead attack us in the second mission of the 15th round as part of the Black Scythe's plan?"

"Yes. I instructed that using the sorcerer. I knew that even if the undead were killed, it would still be considered murder."

"Oh, so that's why you told us not to intervene and wait..."

Now understanding, Kristin nodded.

The explanation concluded here.

But there were still lingering questions in Kristin's mind.

'What should I do? It might be a dream, but should I ask? This might be the only chance...'

She was contemplating whether to open the box of doubts.

Ryumin, casually ready for her thoughts, was prepared to deflect them.
ChatGPT

"I won't know anything even if I pry. Without evidence, Kristin has no way of knowing."

If he denies it, Kristin might think of it as just a dream, remaining uncertain like now.

Unsubstantiated suspicions would likely be treated as delusions.

After making up her mind, Kristin broke the silence.

"Black Scythe, sir. Could you grant me a favor?"

"A favor? What is it?"

"It seems like you used something like shadows in your abilities... Could you show me once?"

"Why?"

"I can't explain in detail, but... there's something I need to confirm. Please."

With a serious gaze, when Kristin asked, Ryumin couldn't refuse.

"Well, that much is fine."

He immediately used the runes of darkness to create a barrier.

"Is this what you used to block the bullets back then?"

"That's right."

"Can it transform freely? For example, can you make it pointed for an attack?"

"That."

Ryumin, who was about to say it was impossible, changed his mind midway.

'If I say no, I might avoid the situation for now, but it could become troublesome later.'

What if a situation arises where he has to use the dagger of darkness?

His lie would be exposed.

It could lead to a worse situation than now.

"It's possible."

"Can you show it to me?"

Instead of answering, Ryumin demonstrated creating the dagger of darkness.

At that moment, he also read Kristin's thoughts.

-It's just like the Prophet's ability, isn't it? Maybe it wasn't a dream...

She felt a similarity, but it was just speculation.

Evidence that the Prophet and the Black Scythe were the same person was still weak.

Was it because she realized this fact?

As if Kristin had firmly made up her mind, she spoke.

"Black Scythe, sir."

"Why?"

"I have something I want to ask. Can you tell me honestly?"

Nodding, Kristin straightforwardly asked.

"Are you the Prophet?"

Throwing a direct question with a serious expression, the method of exposure is simple.

If he denies it, it's the end.

Ryumin's lips, which were about to say no, momentarily stopped.

The rune of foresight showed him the future 7 seconds later.

-It wasn't the same person... I'm sorry. I said something strange. I've been bothered by it for a while.
ChatGPT

The expression of future Kristin as she spoke revealed disappointment.

'Disappointment? Did she hope that we were the same person?'

Ryumin had been thinking that if he told the truth, Kristin would feel betrayed.

So, he had been about to deny it.

But what if the opposite result occurred?

If not admitting now and lying would lead to a worse situation?

'Then the situation might uncontrollably escalate.'

After seeing the future, Ryumin changed his response, thinking that reversing his words here might affect his relationship with Kristin.

'In that case, it might be better... to be honest.'

With that thought in mind, Ryumin changed his answer.

"That's right."

"I see... What?"

Kristin, momentarily confused, widened her eyes and asked again.

"W-what did you just say..."

"I confirmed your guess was right."

"A-are you admitting it now? That the Black Scythe is the Prophet?"

"Yes. I am the Prophet."

Ryumin took off his mask.

The person behind the mask was someone else.

However, when the assassin's mask was removed, the body transformed.

The height decreased, the body became more petite, returning to his real appearance.

"Wow!"

Kristin, witnessing the rare spectacle of a person changing before her eyes, sprang up from her seat.

"Prophet?!"

"Hush. Who might hear."

Having returned to his original appearance, Ryumin gave a wry smile.

"You must have been very surprised."

"W-well, of course. To be able to change appearance..."

"It's not that surprising. If I can resurrect people, changing appearances is nothing."

"W-well, that's true."

Kristin, now somewhat calmer, observed Ryumin's appearance.

"Is that your real form?"

"This is my real form. The appearance you knew of as the Prophet. The alias in the other world is the Black Scythe."

"Ah..."

"Though your eyes say you can't believe it, let me show you some proof."

Ryumin took out his scythe from the inventory.

And while he was at it, he equipped all his gear.

It was the appearance of the Black Scythe that Kristin had been watching all along.

"I had a feeling but to think that the Prophet and the Black Scythe were the same person..."

"I've been hiding it all this time, but I got caught. How did you figure it out?"
ChatGPT

In response to Ryumin's question, Kristin answered honestly.

"When we met before, I saw you kill the bandits with that shadow-like ability you just showed..."

"So, you suspected that we might be the same person."

"Yes..."

Kristin was looking at him with slightly fearful eyes, understanding the significance of revealing her identity so easily.

"H-hold on. Are you going to kill me?"

"No way. It's quite the opposite, actually."

"What?"

"I revealed my identity so willingly because I didn't want to lose sight of you."

"What do you mean by that?"

"Just as it sounds. Kristin, you are an essential companion to me."

"...."

"That's why I didn't want to ruin our relationship. I didn't want to lie anymore. So, I spoke honestly. That's all."

Kristin felt somewhat bewildered, like someone who confessed first to an unrequited love.

"Does that mean you won't kill me then?"

"You seem to see me as some cold-blooded killer. If I were planning to kill you, I wouldn't have revealed my identity. I wouldn't have protected you from the bandits either."

"Protect... me?"

"They demanded you when they pointed their guns. They said they would kill you if I didn't comply. So, I took the initiative. There's a chance they might be looking for you."

"Ah..."

Understanding that it was to protect herself, Kristin's thoughts shifted from suspicion to trust. The remaining doubts disappeared, replaced by a sense of security.

"Now, do you believe that I won't harm you?"

"Yes... Black Scythe. No, Prophet."

"Call me the Black Scythe. That's the identity I came with for now."

As Ryumin put on his mask, he transformed back into the appearance of Lost Yak, a form he had previously taken.

"We should keep my true identity as our secret. It's not the right time to reveal it yet. Can you do that?"

"Yes. Of course. My lips are sealed."

"Good. Trust me then."

Knowing that he wasn't someone who would make a scene in public, Ryumin reassured Kristin and proceeded to explain the strategy for the next round.
ChatGPT

"Now that I've shared the strategy, I'll be on my way."

"Um... Black Scythe."

Turning his head, Ryumin looked as Kristin hesitated before speaking.

"It's a bit late, but thank you for saving me from the bandits. And... thank you for being honest with me."

"If you're thankful, you'll keep the secret, right?"

"Silence is golden."

"Then, I'll see you at the agreed-upon location."

With a wry smile, Ryumin spread his wings and soared into the sky.

Watching him fly away, Kristin murmured to herself, "I'm glad. Being someone Black Scythe needs..."

With a shy smile, she entered the church.

And a few days later, Round 16 began.
