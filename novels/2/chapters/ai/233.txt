Title: Episode 233 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Restoration of National Prestige

[As of this moment, I, 'Gustavo,' will put an end to dictatorial politics and pledge allegiance to the 'Black Scythe.' I will abolish the slave system and lift all oppression, including communication, routes, trade, etc. I swear not to appear before the public again, repenting for my past actions.]

An unbelievable video appeared on the TV screen, which hadn't been shown for a while.

The dictator Gustavo, who had ruled over Mexico, declared that he would step down from his position, accompanied by apologies.

"Is, is this for real?"

"The face is real, but..."

"Are they not lying again to deceive us?"

People found it hard to believe in the face of fear.

Could the monster among monsters, who conducted a politics of terror, step down so easily?

However, it didn't take long for doubt to turn into belief.

Television started working normally, communication and the internet were activated, and families who had been dragged away like slaves returned home.

Above all, there were no players, the oppressive presence of fear, lurking in the streets.

As if they had collectively emigrated somewhere.

"Heh, did it really go back to the way it was?"

"Gustavo and the players disappeared like this?"

It was unknown where they had gone, but one thing was certain.

The citizens gained freedom, thanks to the Black Scythe mentioned in the video.

[Black Scythe, relief efforts in six countries, including Mexico, Brazil, India, and China, in just a week.] [Black Scythe really did it! Gratitude from citizens of each country...] [The hero who saved countries in crisis, his name is the Black Scythe.] [President Yoon says, if there is a country ruled by force, he will continue to report it.] [The Black Scythe who saved hundreds of millions of citizens, asking for no reward...]

Articles were popping up one after another.

The heroic deeds of the Black Scythe were reported eagerly around the world.

The reactions of netizens, who had previously scoffed, changed dramatically.

└Wow... He did it. He's a real hero, a hero.

└This time, he really restored national prestige.
ChatGPT

└Don't they need to give him a medal for this?

└No need for a medal. Make the Black Scythe the president!

└I'm a resident in Germany, and thanks to the Black Scythe, the image of our country has greatly improved. Thank you very much.

└But seriously, there was a country where players were oppressed?

└Just a few days ago, they were asking where such a country even existed. Now, you can't even see their faces.

└Did those trolls who criticized the Black Scythe hide like cockroaches?

└I'm proud that the Black Scythe is Korean.

└The Black Scythe is a god! The Black Scythe is a god! The Black Scythe is a god! The Black Scythe is a god! The Black Scythe is a god! The Black Scythe is a god!

└Really, the Black Scythe is a legend. All I can say is that it's amazing to be able to dedicate oneself to others to this extent...

└Why are people praising him so much? If I had strength, I'd help others too.

└The commenter above is probably just sitting at home typing on the keyboard. He won't do anything.

└Haha, what a loser. Haha.

└It might seem easy to say that, but it's not really easy. Waging a war against evil, putting one's life on the line... just respect.

└I believed in it. The Black Scythe would use his power in the right place.

└The commenter above, if you check his comments, he used to be a troll. Don't believe him.

└Haha, really? Now that he's actually helping countries, they're changing their stance?

└Disgusting. Those trolls.

└But how did they make that video? Did they threaten with guns, saying they would kill if people didn't listen?

└To those who can avoid bullets, what are guns? They probably threatened with the scythe.

└Why threaten at all, just kill them...

└They probably filmed the video and killed them. You think they spared anyone?

└They're cheap bastards. The mastermind and the players who followed them.

└Filming the video was a really smart move. It not only shows that they've been subdued but can also serve as evidence. Moreover, this incident has greatly elevated our country's status. It's an achievement that no one else could have accomplished.

└True. He's become a figure almost on the level of saving the world.

'Figure saving the world, huh.'

Ryumin let out a hollow laugh and tucked his phone into his waistband.

'Well, the feeling isn't bad.'

Not too long ago, he was arrogantly criticized and cursed, but within a week, he transformed into a praised hero.

Becoming a self-defense group against crime and saving many people, it was only natural.

'In the comments, they said it's difficult, but it was easier than I thought.'

How to reclaim a country from those who seized power through force?

The answer is simple.

'Just take it back with the same strength.'

By eliminating all the trash involved in the coup and the masterminds with even greater power, it is simple.

However, after killing them, there's no point in showing their bodies as evidence; surrender must be obtained from them.

How?

'Just like now, kill and transform into one of them to make a video.'

Ryumin, who can transform into the player he killed thanks to an assassin's mask, thought it was easy manipulation.

'The information is easy to obtain by reading their inner thoughts.'

Already, he had read Gustavo's inner thoughts and uncovered the nickname of the mastermind who wanted to create independent nations in China and India.

Like others, they left videos after a righteous death.

'After that, I saved two more countries. Similarly, I left videos for the whole world to see.'

As a result, within a week, Ryumin killed nearly 400 players.

These were criminals he had to kill while saving a total of six countries.

'I've saved all the countries that needed saving now.'

It's certain since no more reports are coming in.

'But that doesn't mean I'll stop.'

He had requested to be informed immediately of any additional reports to the president.

Because he didn't know if there might be another country that needed help.

'What if another country requests assistance?'

Each time that happened, Ryumin intended to step forward like a apostle of justice.

It wasn't just to raise his own value and become a hero.

It was to prevent the dystopia of the world and reduce the players sacrificed to criminal players.

'Only by taking up the gun officially can I prevent future crimes.'

Ryumin declared and acted on his promise to officially prevent crimes committed by players.

Those other criminals who heard the rumors would have no choice but to cower like turtles.

'When dealing with unruly criminals, sometimes you have to use force.'

For players who exist beyond the realm of human law, there is no other way to control them except by crushing them with even greater strength.

In the world of players, those with power are essentially the law.

Just like what Ryumin is doing now.

'Player crimes have been somewhat resolved. Now the key is to endure with the remaining players as much as possible.'

Of course, not all players can be saved.

Half must be discarded in each round.

'So, I need to fill the surroundings with necessary people. People like those here.'

Currently, there were many people standing in line before Ryumin.

Nationalities varied, including the United States, Canada, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, and more.

All players who came seeking to join the Shinsin Church after the week of relief activities.

Perhaps due to the relief efforts, the place was even more bustling.

'Among them, only trustworthy people should be admitted to the Shinsin Church.'

Skill is important, but more than anything, it's crucial whether you can trust and entrust your back to someone.

Since the last round required a boss room with a party of more than 5, it was only natural.

"Black Scythe."

As Kristin approached, Ryumin stood up.

Next to her was a familiar face, Nathan.

"He's our father. He's a clergyman of this congregation."

"Hello. I'm known as the Black Scythe."

Bowing his head and giving a precise Korean-style greeting, a smile appeared on Nathan's lips.

"I'm Nathan Craig. I've been wanting to meet you once, perhaps because my daughter talked so much about you."

The two shook hands.

Although it seemed like their first meeting, in reality, the two had met in Korea before.

'Back then, he was in the role of a prophet.'

Smiling under the mask, Ryumin spoke in a softer tone than usual.

"We needed a place for the interview, and I appreciate you lending us this place."

"Haha, not at all. You saved my daughter; I should naturally help with this."

"Still, it's a ceremony for joining another religion, and you're willingly letting us use it. Won't God be angry?"
ChatGPT

“That's not possible. In the Bible, it says to obey and submit to those who guide you. Black Scythe-nim is someone who saves and guides many people, isn't he? It might be burdensome, but I even consider him a reincarnation of God.”

"A reincarnation of God, that's too much."

“But you've saved and guided so many people, haven't you?”

“I simply did what was right as someone with power.”

“With skills, character, and even humility… It seems like you have it all. Isn't it tempting to draw you into our congregation instead of the Shinsin Church? Hahaha!”

Watching the conversation between the two, Kristin breathed a sigh of relief.

She didn't show it, but she was worried about whether they would be compatible in terms of personality.

Black Scythe spoke with a rough and authoritative tone, while Nathan had a naive side.

‘But it seems like unnecessary worry. Black Scythe is using a softer voice than usual, and Father is receiving him warmly.’

Surprisingly, the conversation was going well, and she was relieved. Then, a surprising remark was made.

“By any chance, are you married? Do you have a significant other?”

“No. I don't, but...”

“Haha, that's good. My daughter is currently without a significant other. How about, if you're willing, meeting her...”

“Father! What are you saying now? You're embarrassing people!”

Due to his daughter shouting loudly, Nathan had no choice but to stop here.

“Ahem, anyway, please take good care of my daughter. Well then…”

As Nathan exited, Kristin had to hurriedly manage the situation.

“Oh, please don't mind my father's words. Sometimes, he jokes like that. You know American-style humor, right? American style, hahaha…”

“I don't mind.”

“...”

Why did he say he didn't mind, yet she felt a somewhat hurtful emotion?

“Well, you probably don't mind. You probably won't mind. Black Scythe, you with others... Oh, no.”

Kristin, trying to smooth things over, pouted her lower lip.

‘He must be having some strange misunderstanding.’

Ryumin, thinking that the misunderstanding needed to be cleared up, spoke.

“It seems like you think I have a close relationship with Yamtti, but that's not true at all.”

“Really?”

“Of course. I only bring him along because his abilities are needed. There are no personal feelings.”

“Oh...”

It was a misunderstanding.

Kristin felt much lighter in her heart.

“Well, I'm sure you don't mind. You probably don't mind. Black Scythe-nim, with others... Oh, no.”

Once Nathan left, Kristin had to hastily rectify the situation.

“Oh, please don't mind my father's words. Sometimes, he jokes like that. You know American-style humor, right? American style, hahaha…”

“I don't mind.”

“...”

Having neatly organized the accumulated emotions, it felt like the pent-up frustrations had finally eased.

"It's time for interviews."

Ryumin conducted one-on-one interviews, facing people lined up in the worship hall.

The questions were simple, consisting of three:

"Why do you want to join the Shinsin Church?"

"Because I respect Black Scythe-nim."

"Do you have a criminal record?"

"No, I don't. I've lived a clean life."

"Lastly, are you confident that you won't leak information provided by the Shinsin Church to the outside?"

"Of course. My lips are sealed more than you might think."

As the interviewer, Ryumin listened to the responses and probed into the interviewee's true thoughts.

"Seems sincere. No issues with character either."

After considering various factors, he announced the results on the spot.

"Pass. Congratulations on joining the Shinsin Church."

"Thank you! Thank you, Black Scythe-nim!"

In this manner, anyone with no character issues, regardless of their abilities, was admitted.

As a result, the number of Shinsin Church followers continued to grow.

Up to 400 people.

"Not a bad outcome."

While it might not be possible to bring all 400 to the final round, they would all benefit from being Shinsin Church members.

Benefits for the next round were known in advance, thanks to recruiting these followers.

With a satisfied smile, Ryumin concluded the recruitment of believers and returned with the envoy.

The week-long trip to the United States ended successfully.

Then, three peaceful weeks passed, and the 14th round began.
