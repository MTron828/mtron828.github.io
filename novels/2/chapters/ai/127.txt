Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 127"

Actors

There are moments in life when people gain realization.

"Oh, this isn't it, is it?"

"It feels like I've ended up in some strange place."

That was exactly how Seo Arin felt at the moment.

Thump, thump...

Led by the touch of a fellow actor, she arrived at a place that was dimly lit, unlike the daytime, resembling a club.

Thump-thump-thump - the beats resonated through the building, but there was not a single person dancing in sight.

"Where on earth are we going? Why did we come to a club?"

"Stop complaining and follow me. I'll introduce you to some good people."

Although it felt suspicious, Seo Arin had no choice but to follow Hong Suna.

It could be just a feeling, and she had the thought that if things went south, she could always escape.

'I have enough power for that.'

That was the confidence she possessed as a level 37 summoner.

"Here we are."

The place led by Hong Suna was a VVIP-exclusive private room.

As the door opened, thick smoke wrinkled her brows.

"Hey guys, brought someone."

"Huh? Who is this? Isn't this the famous Seo Arin?"

"Wow, you really brought her?"

"Hey, she's even prettier in person than on screen!"

Scattered bottles, messy tables, people lying down smoking cigarettes, and others sleeping on the floor like drunkards.

There's a saying that people can't find words when they're flustered, right?

That's how Seo Arin felt at the moment.

'Although I came here following Suna without realizing...'

She didn't expect such a chaotic scene.

But above all, what surprised her the most was...

'I know all these faces, don't I?'

Every one of the six people in the room was a somewhat famous celebrity.

Shoo-ahhh...

"Who came?"

At that moment, the eyes of the male actor who came out of the bathroom met Seo Arin's.

"K-Koo Yeonseung senior?"

With him, it became seven.

"Arin, right? I heard you were coming, but you really came?"

"I told you I'd bring her, senior Koo."

Behind them, Hong Suna let out a meaningful laugh.

"Wouldn't Bokchuri love this if he were here?"

"Where's Bokchuri?"

"He went to the bathroom, saying he needed to poop."
ChatGPT

Seo Arin, who stood still like a scarecrow, wondered what was happening now.

"Sit down. Since you're here, let's have a drink."

"No, I'm good."

Even though it was dark inside, it was broad daylight outside. Drinking in such a situation felt odd to Seo Arin. Above all, she sensed something strange and drew a line.

"Suna, have fun. Sorry, but I'll leave first."

"Hey, where are you going?"

"Yeah, Arin. You came all the way here, at least have a drink. Or maybe a puff of marijuana?"

"What?"

Perplexed, Seo Arin quickly regained her composure.

"No, I don't smoke."

"This isn't cigarettes. Well, then how about a drink..."

"I can't drink either."

"What the hell, you crazy girl. If Senior Koo recommends it like this, pretend to drink at least."

For a moment, Seo Arin doubted her own ears.

'What the heck?'

Hong Suna's language might be rough, but she had never heard her curse before. However, the current Hong Suna was different.

While her face seemed to say, "I'm just smiling," it didn't suit the term "smile." It was an unmistakable sneer.

"You think I look great with an X on my face while I'm laughing, right?"

Instead of answering, Seo Arin instinctively turned around.

The players who were crawling on the floor had now regained their senses and were blocking the exit.

"What's going on here?"

"What are you doing now?"

"Can't you see? We're blocking you from leaving."

"Why are you doing this?"

"Why? Haha, aren't all the newcomers the same? They don't know why they fell into a trap. Ah, maybe it's because my acting killed them off?"

Until a moment ago, Seo Arin had been uncertain, but Hong Suna's attitude made it clear.

She had fallen into a trap.

Seo Arin glanced around at the actors nearby.

There was a sense of malice in their expressions and glances.

'It's all a set-up.'

Seo Arin's gaze naturally shifted to Koo Yeonseung.

As the eldest and the most senior among them, if there was a trap, it was likely orchestrated under his leadership.

And as expected,

"Hehe, Arin. Even if you look at me like that, it's useless. You might have noticed, but it's all a set-up." He voluntarily confessed, mistaking her gaze as a signal for help.
ChatGPT

In an instant, a thought flashed through Seo Arin's mind about a way to escape this crisis.

'Ah, maybe...'

She wasn't sure if it would work, but she had to try.

Seo Arin's expression quickly changed, resembling a frightened puppy.

"Why are you doing this to me?"

As if finding her cute, Koo Yeonseung laughed.

"I don't have personal feelings. Think of it as a survival strategy naturally acquired for the sake of living."

"What does that mean?"

"Players die off by half each round, sometimes even more. Have you ever thought about the items wasted by those who perish?"

Yeonseung grinned.

"Feeling regret over the items of the eliminated players."

"..."

"Isn't that true? I found it too wasteful to think about. All the gold and items obtained so far, they all disappear into nothingness. Instead of evaporating like that, why not use them like fertilizer for other players, just like manure for crops?"

Seo Arin belatedly realized their purpose.

"So... if the player is destined to be eliminated, let's plunder their items? Is that it?"

"Oh, did you invest some points in intelligence stats? You already understand everything. Other actors don't get it even if I explain like this."

"Other actors? You mean, you did this to other actors, not just me?"

"Of course. Unfortunately, Seo Arin, you're just the 33rd sacrificial lamb. Already, 32 seniors, juniors, and fellow entertainers have given us their items before you."

She didn't know.

Seo Arin sat hesitantly on the sofa, portraying a shocked expression.

"T-That means you killed fellow entertainers...?"

"That's right. We killed them all. Don't worry; you'll follow suit soon, Seo Arin."

"Oh..."

Shocked, Seo Arin covered her face with her hands and huddled on the couch.

Meanwhile, actors who seemed unaware of the situation laughed heartily.

"If you willingly hand over the items you have, we'll send you off without any pain. However, if you act uncooperative, we have no choice but to resort to force."
ChatGPT

"Why, why are you doing this? Why kill fellow actors..."

"The reasons? There are many. First, it's advantageous to take down entertainers in the same profession. Second, having good items increases the chances of survival in the next round. Third, as I mentioned earlier, it's a waste to let items disappear with the eliminated players. Fourth, I've realized that to survive, you shouldn't be picky about means and methods. Fifth, surprisingly, it's fun."

"..."

"When have we ever frightened or killed someone? We've always lived conscious of our fans' gaze. Could we have engaged in such provocative acts?"

"But they're colleagues... not just anyone, but peers and seniors, working together in the same field..."

"Oh, Seo Arin, you're clueless from the start, aren't you? Do you know what it feels like to climb up from the bottom?"

The smile disappeared from Yeonseung's face.

"Do you know the life of a theater actor who has struggled through life with next to nothing? Do you know the life of an aspiring actor living in the harsh reality, looking at an uncertain future, hoping for something to happen someday? I know. I've experienced it all, and I'm a case that worked hard and finally succeeded."

"..."

"But what if that hard-earned dream is shattered in an instant? What if you have to live the life of an actor who, after reaching a certain point, can only survive by doing variety shows like a clown or making a living through commercials, without the opportunity to dream or engage in long-term projects like dramas or movies? What if you become a ticking time bomb, worrying if you'll be able to survive the next round? It would be truly desperate and miserable, wouldn't it?"

"..."

"All the people here are those who have faced such situations. People who lost their hard-earned jobs. People who were sincere in their acting but were betrayed by their efforts. What can people like us do? It's nothing but struggling for survival. It's the only strategy left for players who can survive, even if it means trampling on others."

"..."
ChatGPT

"But now, a perfect stage for trampling on others has been prepared, right? You can learn skills like erasing traces of deception. That's why killing is inevitable. Decreasing the number of fellow actors raises the scarcity of entertainers, and naturally, our market value goes up. Real-world market value increases, we secure items for use in this realm, what could be a better two birds with one stone? Keke."

"..."

Although there were many arguments to make, Seo Arin remained silent, focusing on her acting.

As if afraid and terrified, she shivered involuntarily.

Using the acting she had learned until now for this moment, she put all her effort into the performance.

"So... you're going to take items from me and kill me?"

"Of course."

Seo Arin let out a laughter that now seemed detached.

"I-Is this a hidden camera? Is it a new variety show, or is it for YouTube? Can someone please say it's just a joke?"

"Kek, this girl still hasn't snapped out of it?"

Hong Suna approached Seo Arin with a mocking smile.

Slap!

A resounding slap echoed, blood splattering as her head turned.

Judging by the force applied to the palm, it was definitely no joke.

"Hey, you crazy girl. Do you think we're just fooling around? Should I cut off a finger to help you understand the situation?"

"Ah, what's with the finger? There's a better way than that."

As the surrounding men smiled sinisterly, Hong Suna looked disgusted.

"Anyway, men only think about dirty thoughts when they see a face that's somewhat attractive, right? This is all about plastic surgery."

"Is it okay for anyone to have plastic surgery? The original has to be pretty."

"And what's wrong with getting plastic surgery? Kek, as long as it tastes good, that's enough."

Even amid the mocking laughter, Seo Arin crouched down and endured.

Feeling ashamed, humiliated, and fearful, she portrayed a face filled with emotion, waiting for an opportunity.

Yeonseung sighed and quietly signaled the audience.

"You guys. Why are you scaring her so early? Arin, don't worry. If you hand over all your items, we'll let you die gracefully. I'll take responsibility and make sure they don't touch you."

"..."

"Why? Judging by your expression, it seems unpleasant, right? Isn't it better to hand over the items and die gracefully than to die in a harsh situation like a rag?"

"Are you... really going to let me go gracefully if I give up my items?"

"Yes. Oh, by the way, I forgot to mention something."

"What..."

"Jang Bokchul, you know him, right? He really likes Arin. He even talked about her as his ideal type in the media. So, when Seo Arin was coming, he was looking forward to it a lot."

"..."
ChatGPT

"So, just do what he says once. Can't you do that much before dying?"

"What is this..."

"It's pitiful, you know? A no-name actor who survived as a player instead of an actor. Such a person designated Seo Arin as their ideal type, and you can't even do that much? Anyway, since you're going to die, granting each other's wishes before going is a nice gesture. Don't you think?"

"..."

"If you don't answer, we'll take it as an agreement. Anyway, you don't have any choices on that side."

"..."

"Don't resist like that. Can't you see how many of us there are? When Bokchul arrives, there will be nine of us. All with levels over 35. Seo Arin is supposed to be level 37 according to Suna, right? It won't be a problem for us."

"P-please, spare me. I-I was wrong."

Seo Arin showed tears, clasping her hands together.

A belated realization of reality.

Laughter with a bitter taste escaped from the actors' mouths.

"At the end, everyone becomes like this? Spare me, I won't do it again, I was wrong. No, if you're begging for your life, isn't it more appropriate to start by handing over items?"

"I'll give them. I'll give them."

Seo Arin pretended to take items from her inventory, glancing around cautiously.

It was time.

Now, while they were off guard, was the chance.

'Equip!'

With the activation command, Seo Arin's body was enveloped in equipment.

Shwooosh-

Before people could react to the sudden armament, fairies waiting in the wings came out from under the table.

Then, those cute creatures shot beams of light directly at Yeonseung.

Zzeeek-!

"Kuaaah!"

With the sound of burning flesh, Yeonseung screamed.

He raised his arm to block, and fortunately, he managed to avoid his eyes being burnt.

"That b****! Catch her!"

Before Yeonseung could shout, the actors were already wearing their equipment.

Seeing that, Seo Arin was secretly surprised.

'They're quick to respond.'

It seemed like they were anticipating her resistance.

Summoning a golem in a hurry, Seo Arin pushed the male actor in front of the door.

Thud-!

"Ugh!"

Suddenly, a 1.5m golem appeared and struck the man against the wall with its entire body.
ChatGPT

Without hesitation, Seo Arin grabbed the doorknob and swung the door open.

She never intended to confront them directly from the start.

She only thought of finding an opportunity to escape.

'Okay, if I hurry, I can get out now...!'

However, before stepping over the threshold.

Shhluck-

Black chains wrapped around Seo Arin's body.

"Where the hell do you think you're running off to?"

The owner of the chains was Yeonseung.

No entertainer had escaped his touch as a dark magician until now.

"You b****, do you think I haven't faced women like you a couple of times? Even those who resist the appearance of players. I thought you were a bit different, but damn, did you get swayed by a woman's tears?"

"Illicit!"

Seo Arin tried to command her fairies, but she received a message indicating that it was impossible.

She belatedly realized she had already been obliterated by Yeonseung's black arrow.

Whirrr-

The golem, too, had turned into a pile of rubble while confronting the players.

'Oh no, what should I do? All my summoned creatures are gone.'

To summon them again, she had to wait for a cooldown of 10 minutes.

There was no way to afford such a luxury in a life-or-death situation.

"Why? Try summoning them again, can't you? Oh, it must be because of the cooldown?"

"..."

"Then, can I play with you as much as I want now?"

"Hyungnim, we agreed to yield to Bokchul, didn't we?"

"I've changed my mind. We can't wait for Bokchul to arrive, not knowing when he'll summon again."

Yeonseung commanded his comrades with eyes full of life.

"Men, get ready. Let's show this b**** what disgrace really means."

"Hehe, alright."

"We've been waiting for this."

The male actors stepped forward with sinister smiles, and Hong Suna giggled, retreating to the back.

Watching the men grabbing her arms and legs, Seo Arin was engulfed in a sense of despair.

'Ah, like this...'

Regrettably, the escape plan had failed.

With no way out, darkness descended before her eyes.

That was when.

Creak-

Someone entered through the open door.

All eyes of the actors focused in one direction.

A familiar face, Jang Bokchul, had arrived.

"Oh? Bokchul! Here's your favorite, Seo Arin...."

The actors hesitated for a moment before fixing their expressions again.
ChatGPT

Behind him stood a villain wearing a white mask.

"Who..."

Before he could ask, Jang Bokchul's head snapped violently, unable to support itself.

It was a corpse.

The masked villain had appeared, holding none other than Jang Bokchul's lifeless body.

"This punk Jang Bokchul, he's your friend, right?"

Thunk-

As the hand released him, Jang Bokchul collapsed weakly.

"Who, who are you?!"

"Looks like it."

As the masked villain waved his hand, the corpse disappeared as if it were never there.

Erasing all traces.

"You guys gathered here, saying there's a stench of garbage."

"We asked you who..."

For a moment, Yeonseung swallowed his words.

Other actors were in the same situation.

Silence flowed as if time had come to a standstill.

There was no need to ask who it was.

In the masked villain's hand, a giant scythe had appeared unnoticed.
