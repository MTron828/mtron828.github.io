Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 184"

Episode 184: Savior

The necromancer couldn't respond to the question of whether he wanted to die.

Completely frozen, crushed by the weight of living.

'No, did the surprise turn into a failure, causing shock?'

Indeed, wiping out thirty undead entities in one go would be surprising.

Although there was now a justification for killing him, Ryu Min had no immediate intention of doing so.

'The necromancer still has utility. It would be a waste to kill him like this.'

After the 11th round, someone would propose an offer to the necromancer.

To form a united organization called 'Messiah.'

'To create a connection with them, it's necessary to keep the necromancer alive.'

Furthermore, in the 12th round, the time would come when the necromancer's summoning skills were needed.

Using him at that time would make clearing the stage more convenient.

Without knowing that there was not even a speck of intention to kill him, the necromancer's face was extremely tense.

"I have to kill you. If I stay still, I'll die."

Reading his thoughts but pretending not to, Ryu Min threatened.

"Why no response? Do you really want to die...?"

At that moment, the necromancer pointed his staff behind Ryu Min.

Instead of a response, he used the 'Corpse Resurrection' skill.

"Grrrrr...."

When he turned his head, Douglas, who had been lying like a corpse, was standing as if asking when he had died.

Thud thud thud -

When the zombie-like figure reverted the broken neck back to its original state, Kristin was surprised.

It wasn't an entity like an undead.

It was a real undead with a physical form.

Real undead are immune to magical damage, unlike ethereal undead.

'I summoned that because I thought I was a magician?'

Ryu Min laughed as if pitying himself.

It seemed futile to deal with just one.

"At dawn's command..."

Pffft -!

Douglas, who was about to use a skill, had his head burst before he could do anything.

Swoosh - Thud!

Ryu Min's scythe, which had been extended, returned to its original position.

"...."

The necromancer's face was full of surprise, as he hadn't even thought the scythe would extend.

"I thought you could handle me with just that? Even if you summon dozens, the outcome will be the same."

"What in the world are you... Argh!"

The necromancer screamed instead of finishing his sentence.

Ryu Min mercilessly severed one of his arms.

"The balance is off. Let me cut the other side too."

Before he could say anything, with a swift motion, the other arm fell off.

"Kuh, aaargh!"

Next was the left leg.

Thud!

"Lost your balance? Might as well..."

He cleanly cut off the right leg as well.

"Kuhhhaaaargh!"

As Ryu Min severed the limbs, he pondered while stroking his chin.

"Now, what should I cut next? Nothing left but the head?"

Looking at the writhing necromancer, it seemed he might die any moment.

At the moment when Ryu Min moved his scythe again threateningly.

"Wait! Please, don't kill him!"

Ryu Min halted his scythe at Kristen's plea.

Although he hadn't intended to kill him in the first place.

"Why are you stopping?"

"His subordinates are fighting with our colleagues nearby. If we take him alive, the fight will surely stop."

"So, capture this guy as a hostage to stop the fight?"

"I know it's shameless, but please. Our colleagues are worried."

Seeing her plea, Ryu Min had no choice but to lower his scythe.

"The fight is already over, but whatever."

Through clairvoyance, Ryu Min was already aware of the situation over there.

The followers of the saint had been defeated.

They were all killed, and only around 170 loyalists of the necromancer remained.

Unaware of this fact, Kristen still believed she could save him before it was too late.

"At least I shouldn't kill him."

Although he had never intended to kill in the first place, Ryu Min nodded his head nonchalantly.

"If you insist that much."

A warm light emanated from his hand, enveloping the severed part of the necromancer.

The blood that gushed out like a faucet ceased, and the complexion of the near-death necromancer eased.

Emergency treatment had saved the necromancer.

"I won't personally grant mercy by killing you."

"..."

"Next time, be careful with your words when meeting people. It's better to be cautious, as you might encounter a psycho like me."

Even though he regained consciousness, the necromancer had no intention of responding.

He only contemplated attaching his limbs when the opportunity arose.

"Guess these are no longer needed, right?"

Fzzzz -!

To prevent any unnecessary thoughts, he incinerated the remaining limbs.

As the opportunity slipped away, the necromancer's expression became desperate.

Now, being a creature unable to earn points, all he could do was hope for his team's victory.

Well, if he could survive this round, his body would probably be fine.

"Done? I didn't kill you, right?"

Ryu Min turned around and asked, and Kristen bowed her head slightly.

"Thank you."

Then she shot a hostile look at the necromancer.

"Right now, we will take you to where your colleagues are. When you get there, tell your followers to stop fighting immediately."

"Me? Why?"

"Because if you don't, I'll kill you."

"Hmph..."

Although he snorted at first, the necromancer couldn't take Kristen's words lightly.

With no limbs, he had no means to defend against even a child's attack at the moment.

Moreover, judging by Kristen's gaze, it didn't seem like a joke.

She seemed resolute.

"What will you do? Will you die in my hands right now, or will you go to stop the fight?"

"I... I'll go to stop it."

As Kristen agreed, she was about to lift the necromancer.

"Wait a moment."

Ryu Min grabbed Kristen and pulled her towards him.

He felt an increased sense of presence with his doubled perception, and signs of people approaching were felt.

Checking through clairvoyance, he saw a group of 30 approaching from a distance.

They were followers of the Despair Cult.

"Come behind me."

"What? Why all of a sudden...?"

Kristen quickly hid behind Ryu Min as she saw the approaching group.

"Priest! Priest... Ah!"

The approaching individuals panicked as they saw the limbless necromancer.

And one by one, they glared at Ryu Min and Kristen.

"Did you guys do this to our priest?"

"These bastards!"

Two of them immediately drew their swords and charged.

Without sparing a glance for the approaching opponents, Ryu Min did not hold back.

Swoosh -

With a single swing of the scythe, he severed the heads of the two attackers.

Then, the footsteps of the 28 who had been following hesitated and came to a stop.

"Why did you come and back off? Come here. If death is your wish."

"..."

Only now did they realize the overwhelming opponent, causing them to falter and step back.

"You fools! Stop it. Do you even know who you're rushing towards? That person is the Black Scythe."

"B-Black Scythe?"

At the leader's words, the followers looked at Ryu Min once again with widened eyes.

Indeed, he was holding a scythe, as indicated by his nickname.

The atmosphere was fitting for a level 90 character, grim and fierce.

The followers, realizing too late that they had stirred up a hornet's nest, broke into a cold sweat.

"You, come here and embrace me."

"Yes."

One follower embraced the necromancer, whose torso remained.

"What brings all of you here?"

"We came to convey that the situation has ended."

"The situation has ended? What does that mean?"

When Kristen interjected, the necromancer answered instead.

"It means your colleagues are all dead."

"Ah..."

Kristen's mouth gaped open in shock.

Over a hundred followers murdered by the Despair Cult?

"What about our casualties?"

"We have about 45 injuries and 30 deaths."

Considering they faced over a hundred opponents, the damage was surprisingly low.

Although it was not a moment for praise, the necromancer kept silent.

If the Black Scythe suddenly felt displeased, who knows when he might change his mind again.

'One wrong move of the tongue, and I might end up caught in his grasp and killed.'

Swallowing his saliva, the necromancer cautiously spoke, observing Ryu Min's reaction.

"As you can see, the situation is over. There is nothing more I can do. So, now you should..."

"Alright, just leave quickly."

When Ryu Min turned his gaze away, he saw the saint mourning the loss of her comrades.

'Although I couldn't kill the saint, I succeeded in destabilizing her influence.'

With the goal achieved, it was a satisfying outcome.

"Let's go."

Following the necromancer's command, the followers turned away without hesitation.

There was no fool demanding revenge without realizing the situation.

With a leader commanding dozens of summoned creatures brought to this state, revenge was an unreasonable demand.
ChatGPT

Everyone here knew that even if all of them charged at the Black Scythe, they wouldn't be able to defeat him.

"..."

"..."

As the leader and the followers left, silence lingered between Ryu Min and Kristen.

Kristen, who couldn't have known that all her comrades would die, still couldn't overcome the shock.

"Because of me... Everyone died because of me."

Although they were followers who followed her, she had never treated them as inferiors.

They were all treated equally as comrades.

Despite the relationships being based on mutual gain, as Douglas had mentioned, the fact remained that they had faced challenges together as comrades.

"But... just because of me..."

She wanted to shed tears, but none came.

"Hey. What's your nickname?"

"Crissy... Yes."

"Alright, Crissy. I can roughly understand the situation. Losing comrades who followed you must be a great sorrow. It might seem like it's all my fault too."

"It's not just your fault. It's mine. If it weren't for me, this wouldn't have happened."

"If you look at it that way, it's endless. What if that leader guy didn't exist in the first place? What if this survival game didn't exist in the first place?"

Listening to Ryu Min's nonchalant voice, Kristen paid attention.

"Is it not my fault...?"

"Yeah. Did you intentionally gather those followers, telling them to follow you?"

Kristen shook her head.

"No. The followers approached me first. If you think about it, it's not your fault."

"But..."

"The path chosen by the followers who followed you. So, don't be too immersed in emotions. Don't blame yourself as if it's your fault."

"..."

"Fretting about the future is as foolish as trapping yourself in a corner. So..."

After a brief pause, Ryu Min continued.

"Don't blame yourself and now, get rid of the burden on your shoulders. You don't have the obligation to shoulder the burdens of others alone."

"..."

Kristen wasn't naturally an emotional person.

Even when watching romance movies or touching films, she never felt any emotion.

Except when yawning, not a single tear came out.

But now...

"Huh...?"

Drop by drop -

Unbeknownst to herself, large teardrops fell from her eyes.
ChatGPT

Surprised by the fact, Kristen was looking elsewhere while Ryu Min pretended not to notice.

"Did he... comfort me?"

Kristen had been leading many people alone, without anyone to rely on.

There was no place to vent her burden, but now there was a man in front of her who somehow understood and consoled her.

It was surprising, yet somehow relieving.

"Did I interfere unnecessarily?"

"Oh, no. I'm the one who's sorry. For showing such a pathetic side..."

Kristen, wiping away her tears, forced a smile.

"I'm sorry for the late introduction. I'm Crissy. You are the Black Scythe, right?"

Ryu Min didn't deny it.

"Yeah. Do you believe that I'm the Black Scythe?"

"Yes, of course. How can I not believe it after seeing this skill of yours?"

He had effortlessly dealt with thirty undead creatures equivalent to players with a single spell.

Who else could it be but the level 90 Black Scythe?

"But... you said your job is a Reaper, yet you use magic?"

"I see it that way. Is it hard to believe?"

"One, please. My name is Crissy. Thank you for saving me. How should I repay you for saving my life..."

"When did I save your life?"

"Excuse me?"

"I just fixed the rude nonsense of a human who was talking. That's all."

"Oh. Haha."

Pretending not to know, Kristen could feel it.

The Black Scythe deliberately made excuses while saving her.

Regardless, he was a warm person.

And he might be the one she should follow.

"I'm really thankful for saving me, Black Scythe. I don't know how to repay you for saving my life..."

"I never saved your life."

"What?"

"I just corrected the impudence of a talkative human. That's all."

"Oh. Haha."

Though pretending otherwise, Kristen could feel it.

The Black Scythe intentionally made excuses while saving her.

Regardless, he was a warm person.

And he might be the one she should follow.

"Hey, Black Scythe."

"What's the matter?"

With an embarrassed look, Kristen lowered her head and mustered the courage to speak.

"Can I accompany you for the remaining time?"

"Why?"

"You saved my life. I want to repay you somehow."

"I refuse."

"What? Um... why?"

With a rejection as sharp as a knife, Kristen was momentarily dumbfounded.

"This, this shouldn't be happening?"

I never expected it to escalate at the speed of light.
