Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 189"

"The Angry Magyeongrok"

Players wake up simultaneously from their sleep when they return.

As a result, their families can only wait anxiously.

Not knowing why their children are not opening their eyes, why they are sleeping for 24 hours straight, without any information.

"Ugh."

"Oh, you're awake!"

Kristine, who opened her eyes quietly, turned her head and was surprised.

Her father, with a worried expression, was sitting by her bedside as if caring for a patient.

"Father?"

"I'm relieved that you're safe."

"What happened? Have you been waiting without sleeping until now?"

"Do you think you can sleep well? My daughter hasn't woken up for 24 hours."

Father Nathan's worry was natural.

Especially after hearing about the turmoil in Round 11, he couldn't help but be particularly anxious.

When Kristine stole a glance at Nathan's eyes filled with tears, she was surprised.

It was the first time she had ever seen her father cry.

"Are you really crying?"

"Don't misunderstand. These tears are coming out because I'm sleepy. Anyway, why did it take so long?"

"The time limit for this round was unusually long, 24 hours."

Just as the door opened, Jeffrey entered.

"Ah! You're alive! Kristine."

"It just happened."

Kristine's reaction was cold.

She seemed to be firmly angry from the previous incident, not even looking at him.

The resentment towards the prophet had disappeared since being dominated by Yantti.

"Daughter. By the way, what happened? Did you really get attacked as the prophecy said?"

"...Yes."

Kristine explained what she had experienced with a bewildered feeling.

The surprise attack by the Despair Sect, the betrayal of the trusted paladin, and the appearance of the cult leader and sorcerer.

Especially when Kristine mentioned that the paladin had tried to force himself upon her, Jeffrey couldn't contain his anger.

"To think there's such a beast! Kristine! That guy must be dead for sure, right?"

"He's dead. I saw it with my own eyes."

"To think you had such a devilish person by your side. You shouldn't trust the followers who followed you."

"There's nothing to believe or not. About a hundred of my comrades who were with me have already been killed in the surprise attack by the Despair Sect."

"...."

"...."

Upon hearing these words, the two remained silent, understanding the gravity of the situation. Kristine's expression looked exceedingly melancholic.

"You don't have to worry about me. I've decided to shake off the sadness and move on."

"Is that so?"

"Regardless of what happens, we have to make it to Round 20. There's no other way to ensure that the deaths of our comrades won't be in vain, right?"

"A wish, you say."

Kristine never really had any wishes before. Whether it was a wish or a whim, she survived up to this point just to stay alive. But now, her mindset had changed.

"The Black Scythe said it wasn't my fault, but I can't entirely deny my responsibility. So... I will survive. Even if it's for the sake of my deceased comrades."

She gained strong motivation from this incident and found a reason to make it to Round 20. Did Nathan read the change in his daughter's eyes?

Nathan smiled more happily than ever before.

"As expected, our daughter is strong."

"I took some advice."

"Huh? Advice?"

"Don't worry about it. Have you ever heard of the Despair Sect?"

Nathan and Jeffrey both raised their heads simultaneously.

"What kind of cult is that?"

"It seems to be a religion composed only of players. It seems to have a base in the United States, but there's no way to find it."

"Leave finding those guys to us. Don't unnecessarily get involved in danger again."

"More importantly, Kristine, who saved you?"

Nathan, supporting Jeffrey's question, curiously asked.

"Yeah, tell us. Who helped you escape from that situation? Was it your fiancé after all?"

Kristine rolled her eyes.

"No. I haven't even met that person."

"Then who was it?"

"The nickname of the person who saved me is Black Scythe."

"Black Scythe?"

Nathan seemed to raise his head with surprise, but Jeffrey's reaction was different.

"Huh, Black... Scythe?"

"Why are you like that, Jeffrey? Have you heard of this person too?"
ChatGPT

"Heard of him, haven't you? He's already a well-known figure in this industry. The undefeated rank 1 player, the strongest among the current players."

"Oh? Is he American?"

"No, he's Korean. Among ordinary people, he's known as the deputy commander of CPF, credited with rooting out IS remnants in Nigeria."

"Wow? That player seems to be doing a good deed."

Nathan's eyes gleamed.

Although he had never met him, the first impression of the Black Scythe was a pass, given that he had already saved Kristine.

"I should go to Korea soon and repay the favor of saving my daughter."

"But it won't be easy to meet him. He doesn't contact anyone, wears a mask to conceal his identity thoroughly."

"Still, there must be a way to meet, right? Finding one person in such a small country like Korea shouldn't be that difficult."

Confidently spoken, but Jeffrey had a negative expression.

If it were possible, the face of the Black Scythe would have been known through the media by now.

At that moment, Kristine interjected.

"I'll go to Korea."

"To Korea?"

"I'll go and meet the prophet. If anyone knows the location of the Black Scythe, it might be him."

"Why not ask over the phone since you exchanged numbers this time?"

"It would be rude to discuss such matters over the phone. I need to show the courtesy of visiting in person."

"Do you know his home address?"

"Forgetful, aren't you? My fiancé is the person closest to the prophet. If I ask him, I can find out."

As Magyeongrok woke up, he immediately threw the stand next to him.

"Aaaah! Shiiiiiit!!!"

He wanted to throw anything within reach, but unfortunately, due to his tidy nature, there weren't many things he could grab.

"Phew, huff."

Magyeongrok snorted like an angry bull.

He was angry.

To be precise, his points in Round 11 were 0.

It was because he couldn't escape the maze forest for the entire 24 hours.

"Probably the Assistant Director is shouting like a whale by now. His determination to become stronger was higher than mine."

Fortunately, thanks to the Black Scythe, the Korean team managed to rank first and avoid annihilation, but that was it.
ChatGPT

Unable to use the Special Shop due to the lack of points, he found himself in a pitiful situation.

It was truly a case of "the bait in the picture."

"I've been a golden spoon since I was born, and now I find myself in a situation where I can only watch because of a single point."

For a moment, he felt like a penniless beggar.

Even if there were hundreds of billions in his bank account, he felt only emptiness.

As much as the anticipation for the Special Shop was high, the sense of loss was equally profound.

"It's truly ironic. Chasing the Black Scythe led to this point, and yet, ironically, I was able to survive thanks to the Black Scythe."

Thinking about it now, it was impressive.

How did that guy manage to accumulate 20 million points all by himself?

"No, more importantly, how the hell did he escape from that damn forest?"

Magyeongrok, who had been hit by Hwang Yong-min and passed out, woke up belatedly.

There were 3 hours left.

For an hour, he struggled, cutting the stems of trees and trying to escape the maze with Ahn Sang-cheol.

However, just 2 hours were not enough to escape.

Having spent the whole day in a maze-like forest, his points could only be 0.

"Absurd, it's absurd. 0 points. Me, who always ranked, has 0 points..."

Beyond anger, he felt frustration. Just then, with a squeak, the door opened, and Ahn Sang-cheol entered.

Seeing the messy room, he was momentarily surprised, but soon his expression turned calm, as if understanding.

"Boss. I'm here."

"Yeah."

"Have you vented enough?"

"To some extent. And Director Ahn?"

"Well, I couldn't hold back and threw a few things myself."

"Is this even reasonable? We have 0 points."

"That's right."

"Do you think Director Ahn is responsible for this?"

"Well... um."

The reason Ahn Sang-cheol hesitated to answer was that it was Magyeongrok who had suggested following the Black Scythe.

But as long as he was in his right mind, he couldn't accuse his boss in front of him.

"The primary cause is the Black Scythe who entered the strange forest, and secondarily, it's Hwang Yong-min who made us like this."

"But isn't it Hwang Yong-min? That guy."
ChatGPT

"Ah, that's right. In reality, he's an undead. If we think about it, the one manipulating Hwang Yong-min should be considered the cause."

"No matter how you think about it, it's strange. How could an ordinary undead have such skills?"

Hwang Yong-min completely played with the two of them.

It was an unbelievable skill for someone considered just a summon.

Even at a glance, he looked too intact to be called undead, resembling a perfectly healthy human.

If the Prophet hadn't stated that he died, one might have easily believed he was a player.

"The Prophet was clear at that time, right? Hwang Yong-min died."

"Yes, I definitely heard that. He also mentioned a sorcerer controlling him."

"Then the Prophet must know who the mastermind is."

They hadn't been targeted by Hwang Yong-min; rather, they had been targeted by someone manipulating Hwang Yong-min.

"Are you going to seek revenge?"

"Yes, of course. We need to find that bastard, tear him apart, and feed him to the dogs."

"Shall we call the Prophet then?"

"Yes. Let me do it myself to confirm if she survived or not..."

At that moment, Magyeongrok's phone rang.

Checking the caller ID, it was Kristine.

"Kristine?"

-Hello, Mr. Magyeongrok.

"I'm glad you're safe! Do you know how worried I was?"

The voice on the other end of the line unexpectedly hesitated, causing a brief silence.

-Thank you for worrying.

"How could I not worry? We made a promise for the future. Besides, this round had a bad prophecy."

-That's right.

"How was it? Did something really happen as the prophecy foretold?"

For Magyeongrok, who was curious, Kristine calmly explained the situation at that time.

The problem was that the listener couldn't remain calm.

"You were almost killed by the Despair Sect's leader?"

-Yes. He was an American with the ability to control the dead. I heard he was a sorcerer."

'A sorcerer?'

The mention of controlling the dead immediately caught his attention.

This guy was undoubtedly the mastermind behind everything he needed to avenge.

"What was his name?"

-It's Jon Delgado of the Despair Sect. Do you happen to know him?

"No. I don't know much, but I'll look into it. Since he dared to touch my fiancée, I must settle the score, right?"
ChatGPT

"You really didn't have to go this far..."

"No, it's necessary since I couldn't provide any help in the other world."

Magyeongrok said it as if he were doing a favor, but in reality, it was driven by personal revenge.

"Sure. In this situation, helping each other is essential."

Magyeongrok's words were tinted with reluctance, but it was fueled by his personal desire for revenge.

"Surely. That bastard manipulated Hwang Yong-min, who entered that strange forest. Secondly, it was Hwang Yong-min who made us like this."

"Isn't it Hwang Yong-min? That guy."

"Ah, right. In reality, he's undead. When you think about it, the one who controlled Hwang Yong-min should be considered the cause."

"No matter how much I think about it, it's strange. How could an ordinary undead have such skills?"
