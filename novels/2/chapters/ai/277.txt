Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 277"

Episode 277: Cooperation

The vengeful goddess Nemesis had her hands politely clasped together, bowing her head.

A rare expression, biting her lower lip anxiously, adorned her face.

[Nemesis.] [Y-yes!]

Nemesis raised her head in surprise at the deep, moderate voice.

[How did the task go?] [W-well, it's still...]
[Still haven't retrieved the Black Scythe?] [I apologize. However, please do not worry. Since Micael has descended, you will soon hear good news...]
[I heard similar words last time, didn't I? Gabriel and Raphael took action, promising good news soon.] [B-but this time is different. The top-ranking Archangel has personally taken the field...]
[Nemesis.]

The tone of the voice was as heavy as an abyss.

[Can you guarantee that even Michael won't fall?] [Y-yes, of course. Of course...]
[Can you take responsibility?] [...….]

Nemesis remained silent.

If she were to answer that question, she had to be prepared for annihilation.

[I knew you couldn't answer.] [...….] [Seems like we'll fail again this time. Should I send Artaros without any other choice?] [T-that won't be necessary. I will definitely bring it to a conclusion in my own way...]
[Just endlessly spouting promises you can't keep.] [...….] [Do you not know better than anyone what happened to the gods who merely spoke in front of me, Nemesis?] [Y-yes, I understand. I know...]
Nemesis trembled in fear.

Having closely observed what happened to those who defied the will of the god of destruction.

[Stop useless excuses if you know. What's important to me is only the outcome. You understand how much energy is at stake in the outcome of this war, right?] [Yes, yes.] [Go and bring the results. To prevent Plutonitos from joining the war, we have no choice but to throw the Black Scythe.] [I will certainly bring you good news.] [I hope it's not just words this time.]

As the communication ended with those words, Nemesis took a deep breath.

Now, it feels like I can finally breathe.

"If the Celestials don't win in the 7th Heavenly-Demonic War, we stand to lose a lot."

Living under the wrath of countless gods who have bet on the Celestials is one thing, and there's also the possibility that their very existence might be annihilated.

After all, it was their own doing to bring in other gods by believing in the potential of the Celestials.

"That foolish Michael! Why does he freely use the Devil's Resurrection Scroll!"

In truth, it happened with his approval, but Nemesis couldn't afford to blame herself.

If she doesn't immediately hand over the Black Scythe to Plutonitos, they will lose this war, and she herself will face annihilation.

"The fate of the gods is at stake for Michael."

Nemesis remembers.

The exploits of Michael, who slaughtered demons and achieved the only victory in the 5th Heavenly-Demonic War.

Didn't he even gain the title of the god of battle at that time?

"All the other wars ended in defeat."

Out of a total of six wars, the Celestials won only once in the 5th war.

However, it was a significant victory as it was achieved without human mercenaries.

"Although we suffered defeat again in the 6th war, this 7th one will be different."

With such hope, she has been making deals and persuading other gods to bet on the Celestials.

She even managed to get the giant known as the god of destruction, with whom she had a conversation a while ago, to stand on their side.

Therefore, everything is at stake in this 7th Heavenly-Demonic War.

"Surely, we won't lose to the Black Scythe again this time, right?"

In a situation where many Archangels, including Gabriel, have already been lost.

If they lose Michael as well, there is no chance of winning the upcoming 7th Heavenly-Demonic War, even if they hand over the Black Scythe.

"It's been a while since Michael descended, why is there no news? Wait, could it be?"

With a sudden ominous thought, Nemesis's face became contemplative.

"No, no, it can't be."

Hoping that the ominous premonition doesn't become a reality, she hastily used the power of the gods.

The power to look down upon everything.

"Huh? Huh?"

Soon, Nemesis became flustered.

In this realm, she cannot find the presence of Michael.

"No, he's not here. He's not...!"
ChatGPT

Eventually, did the ominous premonition become a reality?

A signal came to Nemesis, who was wearing a disappointed expression and in deep contemplation.

And she realized.

That her worries were groundless.

"Nemesis. It's Michael. As you ordered, I have brought the Black Scythe."

Upon reading the message, Nemesis couldn't help but snap to attention.

"Where are you? Where!"

Hastily tracking Michael's location, Nemesis soon became agitated.

"So, you were in the heavens! And with the Black Scythe, no less!"

To capture this pleasant reality with her own eyes, Nemesis tore through space.

Rippling sounds—

With just one step, she could stand in front of Michael.

"Oh, Nemesis."

Beside Michael, bowing his head, was the sinner bound by chains of light— the Black Scythe.

"So, this is the Black Scythe." "Yes." "You wretched creature! To disrupt the order of the heavens to this extent! You trash!"

How much has she suffered emotionally because of this insignificant offspring?

While spewing curses in frustration, there was no change in the expression of the Black Scythe.

"As much as I want to throw this wretched creature into the dung pit and let it be devoured by insects forever, I can't do that."

As if not wanting to see the sight any longer, Nemesis averted her gaze.

"Michael!" "Yes." "Contact Plutonitos immediately. Tell them we are handing over this less-than-worthless human." "Understood, I will execute your orders."

After glaring at the Black Scythe as if she could kill it, Nemesis tore through space and disappeared.

Clanking sounds echoed with each step.

"How much farther do I have to walk?"

"Don't complain. Just a bit more."

"We don't have much time."

"I know, I know."

Muttering complaints, Michael recalled his conversation with Ryumin from 30 minutes ago.

"I'll spare you. How about doing it like this?"

"What do you mean?"

"Request support, summon the battle angels. Approximately 75 of them?"

"Why call subordinates?"

"To kill them all."

"What gain is there in killing them?"

"You should know that yourself."

"Only sacrifice the subordinates, and you'll spare me? That's incredible."

-Why? Don't want to? Then die right here.

-Do you think I'm a fool? If I were going to kill you, I would have done it sooner.

-Earlier, I spared you to gather information, but now it's different. I've gathered all the information worth obtaining.

-...You vile human.

-Better than being called an insect. So, what are you going to do? Die? Shall I call my subordinates?

-Instead of sacrificing subordinates, I'd rather just die. Since I can't bring you to the heavens, my life is already forfeit.

-Hmm... you're not cooperating. To build stacks, there's no other way...

-What are you mumbling about? Hurry up and kill me.

-How about this? If you can offer a way for me to survive, will you cooperate?

-The only way for me to survive is to take you to the heavens.

-Take me then.

-What?

-Take me to the heavens. To Plutonitos, the demon lord. That way, we can prevent the war from breaking out early, calm the anger of the gods, right?

-What? Um...

-Then take me. To the heavens. Well, I don't really intend to be caught, just pretending to be caught.

-Pretending?

-If you bring the Black Scythe to the heavens and show it, your task is done, right? Isn't that so?

-Well, yes.

-Then take me in front of the gods. After that, whatever I do, the gods won't be able to hold you responsible anymore.

-W-what are you planning to do?

-Escape. Kill some battle angels.

-Escape? How?

-The method is simple. Pretend to take me to Plutonitos while passing through where the battle angels are. At that moment, I'll release the restraints, kill the battle angels, and escape to the other realm. As long as I return within an hour, your player status won't be revoked, right?

-That's true, but...

-Why? Worried that you might be reprimanded for losing the Black Scythe during the escape?

-I won't deny that.

-Even if I'm the only Archangel, would you really kill me? If you scold me for carelessly losing it, there's nothing more I can do. At least the order to bring me to the heavens has been fulfilled, hasn't it?

-...

-This way, I can kill the battle angels as I please, and you can save your life. Isn't it a win-win for both of us?
ChatGPT

-Surely, it's a plausible plan. However...

-However?

-What if I break the promise and betray you to the gods? What will you do then? No matter how strong you are, in front of the gods, you'll be nothing more than a puppy.

-You're saying you'll kneel when facing the gods. Well, it's fine. The moment you betray me, I'll strike you down right there. And why not take this chance to fight with the gods too.

-Challenge the gods... Are you in your right mind?

-So don't betray me. If you don't want to die.

-...

-Besides, you have to fulfill your wish to survive until round 20, right?

-How can I...?

-There's a way to know all. So, don't think about betraying. We're comrades from now on.

'Comrades? Me with that human?'

After finishing his recollection, Michael looked at the Black Scythe with a sidelong glance. Even though he had just faced the gods a little while ago, his expression remained relaxed. No sign of tension on his face.

'Does he know that I won't betray him?'

He didn't know how the guy knew about his wish, but he was definitely a tricky character. Not someone to be dismissed as an insect.

"Where will we reach where my subordinates are? We need to get back within 20 minutes."

[Over there. Just pass by the training ground.]

Michael decided to trust him. The only way to save his life right now was to cooperate with him.

[Oh? Michael!] [It's Michael!] [Really? Where, where?]

The battle angels who were training showed excited reactions as if they had seen a celebrity. Some were so awestruck they couldn't move, while others sent looks of admiration.

Unaware that their lifelong idol had just sold them out to the Black Scythe.

[They are 5th-grade battle angels. There should be around 100 of them.]

"Thank you."

Ryumin, who had stopped walking, untied and removed the chain around Michael's abdomen.

Originally, it wasn't something prepared by Michael; it was a chain created by Ryumin using rune magic.

"Now, you're going to keep your promise and let me live, right?"

"Of course."

As soon as Ryumin finished answering, he struck Michael's abdomen frighteningly.

Thud!
ChatGPT

Unable to scream or resist, the unconscious Michael was thrown somewhere.

"For the time being."

Ryumin chuckled and looked at the bewildered battle angels.

It was a gaze similar to that of a beast looking at its prey.
