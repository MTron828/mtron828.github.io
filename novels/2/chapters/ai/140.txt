Title: Episode 140 of the 100th Rebirth of a Max Level Player

True Colors

"Uh? Who is that person?"

"Isn't that the actor Seo Arin?"

"Wow, amazing! She's incredibly beautiful!"

The crowd buzzed with excitement at Seo Arin's appearance.

Even the man who was causing a commotion momentarily paused when a sudden celebrity appeared.

"Are you okay, Mr. Ryu Min?"

"Oh, yes... thank you."

"From here on, leave it to me and step back."

Seo Arin, protected by the fairy's barrier, turned her gaze towards the man, blocking his attacks.

Ryu Min was quietly surprised by her actions.

Clearly an enemy.

Even though she was seeing him for the first time, Seo Arin was scrutinizing her opponent with sharp eyes.

'She's showing hostility towards the fact that I'm a nasty player.'

Was it because of the betrayal by actors she had trusted last time?

Just by looking into her eyes, it wasn't the Seo Arin she used to know.

Not only the fairy but now even a golem was summoned by Seo Arin, warning the man.

"Do you want to continue? Or will you go peacefully to the police station?"

"Why should I go to the police station? I haven't committed any crimes!"

"There's at least one crime you committed. Destruction of property."

"This table? I didn't do that!"

"It was you!"

"Yes, how many witnesses are there to this nonsense?"

As voices around them grew louder, the man's face trembled.

"Are these people insane? Daring to involve themselves in matters of ordinary citizens..."

"It's not just property damage. Weren't you trying to kill someone just now?"

"Kill? Who did I kill? I just threatened, that's all!"

"Threatening with an axe in hand is just a threat? If I hadn't stepped in, what would have happened? Even if he didn't die, he would have been injured."

He probably wouldn't have been injured.

'If anything, that guy would have been the one getting hurt.'

Ryu Min had no intention of taking on the attacks of such a low-level player.

He probably skillfully avoided them on his own.

But revealing his strength wouldn't be good, so Ryu Min stood aside and observed.

For now, he entrusted the situation to Seo Arin.

"How about it? Isn't this reason enough to go to the police station?"

"Damn it..."

The man, unable to find a counterargument, spat out a curse.

How did it come to this?
ChatGPT

'I was just trying to legally earn some money instead of resorting to robbery...'

Though it was a threat based on the pretext of illegal activity, it didn't matter much to the man.

After all, wasn't it better than outright robbery?

Compared to other players who openly plunder, he considered himself no different from a noble.

However, things didn't unfold as annoyingly as he had hoped.

'How did it get so twisted, damn it.'

The man's hostile gaze shifted towards Seo Arin.

It seemed unlikely that words would resolve the situation.

'Now that it's come to this, I have to distract her and escape.'

With an axe in each hand, he prepared for battle.

With three fairy-like sprites and two golems, he thought he could somehow deal with Seo Arin.

However.

Squelch-

The man belatedly noticed.

That Seo Arin had one more summoned creature.

'What's this now?'

A knight in armor appeared, wielding a bastard sword, blocking the man's way.

Initially, he thought it was a person, but seeing blue flames flickering where eyes should be, he realized it was a summon.

Seo Arin's new summon at level 40, the Soul Knight.

'Damn it, she summoned all of this?'

Three fairies, two golems, and now a Soul Knight.

In terms of numbers alone, he was at a disadvantage.

His trusty axe, which had overcome numerous obstacles, seemed pitiful for the first time.

'I knew Seo Arin, the celebrity, was a summoner from seeing the knight, but I never expected her arsenal to be this powerful...'

Three creatures might be manageable, but honestly, dealing with six summoned beings was overwhelming.

'No need to be scared. Even if she has many summons, if I kill the summoner, it should be over, right? She's also level 40 like me and an expert rank, not as strong as I thought.'

Perhaps he could take advantage of a moment of distraction during a conversation?

With that thought, the man asked, "Do you want attention as a celebrity? Just leave without meddling, alright?"

"I'm a regular customer here. How do you think the owner feels about losing business because of you? I absolutely can't stand it."

Having said that, Seo Arin extended three fingers.
ChatGPT

"You have three choices. One, quietly get caught by the police. Two, quietly get caught by me. Three, resist and get caught."

"Why are all the options about getting caught?"

"You did something wrong, so getting caught is only natural."

"This bastard thinks he can challenge me!"

Unable to control his anger any longer, the man lunged forward.

"I attacked first, so it's self-defense."

The golems blocked Seo Arin's path.

Clang! Thud!

He attempted to swing the axe towards Seo Arin, but it kept veering towards the golems, as if there was a magnet on his arm.

"Why is the attack going towards the golems, damn it?"

Unbeknownst to the man, golems had a skill that drew the opponent's aggression.

"Damn it, move, you golem bastards!"

While the golems drew the aggression, three fairies flew behind and sent beams towards the man.

Ziiiiing!

"Ah, damn it!"

The man, burning from the beams, screamed and swung his axe.

Swish! Swish!

However, the agile fairies easily avoided the swings, leaving the man swinging at thin air.

"These crazy fairy bastards!"

The man, now with burns, glared at Seo Arin as if he intended to kill her.

"What self-defense! You're the one who attacked first, you damn bastard!"

"Maybe the laws have changed these days? Haven't you heard of the Grand Player Legislation?"

"Do I look like I know about that? The one who attacks me, regardless of age or gender, gets screwed. Got it? Just because you're a celebrity doesn't mean I'll go easy on you, damn it!"

"Oh? Have I been going easy on you all this time? I didn't know."

Ryu Min thought while observing Seo Arin, who was speaking casually.

'Perhaps it's because she's an actress, but her acting is top-notch.'

On the other hand, the man listening was reaching the brink of frustration.

"You crazy brat! Fine. I'm getting serious now!"

Activating the gladiator skill [Rage], a red smoke enveloped the man's body.

Ziiiiing!

Once again, the fairy's beam burned him, but the man charged towards Seo Arin as if he felt no pain.

Despite instructing the golem to block, for some reason, the provocation didn't work.

"Huh?"

While Seo Arin wore a perplexed expression, the distance between them closed in.

"Die, you damn brat!!!"

In the moment the man's axe was about to reach Seo Arin.

Crash!

The Soul Knight stepped forward, blocking the man and engaging in a one-on-one battle.
ChatGPT

Crash! Crash! Pandemonium erupted in the narrow restaurant as tables were pushed and overturned, dishes shattered everywhere. Seo Arin, unable to see the owner's face, prioritized subduing the man in front of her.

Fortunately, it seemed relatively easy to subdue him. The man, who had been blocking attacks with his axe against the Soul Knight, was being pushed back visibly.

"Damn it, is this really a summon? Why are there so many like this?"

The Soul Knight's movements and swordsmanship were of a quality that could be trusted, even comparable to a player.

Swish!

Eventually, when the knight's sword touched the man's neck, he raised both hands.

"I surrender. I've lost. Don't stab me. Please."

"You did something wrong, right?"

"Yeah, I messed up. I'll compensate for everything. Just don't stab me."

"Compensation is obvious, and you'll also have to pay for your crimes."

Seo Arin gestured towards the front door with her chin. The police, alerted by the owner, were waiting at a distance for the situation to resolve.

"Officers, I caught a criminal player here."

"Oh, yes. Please hold him like that for a moment."

While the Soul Knight held the man's neck with a sword, the police approached, jingling handcuffs.

Clank!

They put special handcuffs on the man's wrists, nearly unbreakable even for a tiger.

"Thank you for your cooperation, Miss Seo Arin."

"It was nothing. Should I accompany you to the station, just in case?"

"Yes, that would be appreciated. Even though you have to accompany us to the station for the paperwork."

"Oh, then please give me just three minutes. I have some things to tidy up."

"Yes, we'll wait."

After getting permission, Seo Arin approached Ryu Min.

"Mr. Ryu Min, I'm sorry. As you can see, it looks like we won't be able to have our meal."

"No, I should be the one apologizing. I'm sorry for getting involved in such a trivial matter."

"Don't apologize. These senseless players sometimes need a lesson. It's a shame they tarnish the image of all players for no reason."

"That's true."

At that moment, Seo Arin's younger brother unexpectedly joined the conversation.

"Uh, you're Actress Seo Arin, right?"

"Hello, younger one. Your name is Ryu Won, isn't it?"
ChatGPT

Ryu Won expressed a touched expression upon remembering his name.

"Yes, uh, hello. I received the autograph you gave me last time. I liked it so much that I framed it and keep it safe!"

"Oh, really? I'm glad you liked it."

"But how did Actress Seo Arin end up here?"

"My brother called her to join us for a meal."

"My brother?"

Ryu Min shrugged his shoulders in response to Ryu Won's questioning gaze.

"I called her before I arrived. I suggested we have a meal together if she had time. But I didn't expect it to turn out like this."

He truly didn't know. Even if he could foresee the future, it would only be seven seconds ahead.

"Anyway, we'll have to postpone the meal."

"That's right."

"I'll go ahead, Mr. Ryu Min. See you next time."

"Yes, sorry for involving you in this troublesome situation."

"No problem."

With a bright smile, Seo Arin got into the car with the police.

As they headed towards the station, Seo Arin recalled Ryu Min confronting the criminal with the prophesied body of an ordinary person.

'He's braver than I thought.'

Seo Arin looked at Ryu Min in a different light due to his unexpected courage, although Ryu Min was unaware of this fact.

While the owner of the barbecue restaurant accompanied the police for testimony, Ryu Won spoke.

"Hyung! Why did you call Actress Seo Arin?"

"Because you like Actress Seo Arin. I thought having her around might lighten your mood. I really didn't expect her to show up like this."

"Oh..."

Could Ryu Won feel his brother's consideration for him?

With a moved expression, Ryu Won looked at his brother.

"I didn't know you'd care so much. Thank you."

"Of course I care. You're my only brother."

The brothers smiled at each other.

Although the meal was ruined due to the unexpected incident, the mood was as relieving as Ryu Min's feelings.

"By the way, if it weren't for Actress Seo Arin, it could have been dangerous, right?"

"That's right. I was a bit scared too. Fortunately, she showed up at the right time."

Ryu Min sighed in relief, pretending to be weak, considering the concept of a less powerful prophet. He deliberately let Seo Arin handle the situation.
ChatGPT

'Rather than revealing my strength, it's better to leave it to Seo Arin.'

After reaching level 40, Seo Arin became stronger than expected, both mentally and physically.

'The Soul Knight skill learned at level 40 is indeed powerful.'

Seo Arin could now navigate through challenges on her own without relying on anyone else.

At that moment, the sound of people buzzing could be heard.

"Did you record that video earlier?"

"Yeah, I recorded the whole thing from start to finish."

"Isn't it amazing?"

"Seo Arin is really cool."

"Call it the Real Player Education video and upload it."

"I was planning to upload it on YouTube and Instagram anyway."

As I listened, all the conversations were about Seo Arin.

Overall, there were positive reviews.

'If the video spreads, Seo Arin's popularity and market value will definitely rise.'

Despite getting involved in a troublesome situation, it seemed to be advantageous for Seo Arin judging by the reactions.

'Anyway, I'm glad my brother's mood improved.'

Thinking that he should send a thank-you message to Seo Arin, who willingly came out to help, Ryu Min left with his brother.

He felt sorry for the owner, but they would have to eat at a different restaurant for dinner.

Ryu Min nodded as he watched Seo Arin's news.

'As expected. The video has gone viral, and her popularity has skyrocketed.'

Seo Arin, who was already popular among men due to her pretty appearance, had gained more female fans under the label of a girl crush.

In fact, she had become a popular star loved by people of all genders.

'It wasn't intentional, but it's all thanks to me, isn't it?'

If Ryu Min hadn't called her, Seo Arin wouldn't have gained this much popularity.

'During times of crisis, one must turn adversity into opportunity. How about using Seo Arin as a promotional model for the Real Player Corps?'

Leveraging the current popularity, promoting the Real Player Corps could create a positive effect and synergy around players.
ChatGPT

The fame of Black Scythe, the commander of the corps, was just a bonus.

"I should suggest it to Seo Arin later."

Of course, the proposal had to come from Black Scythe, not Ryu Min.

"But before that, I should receive a call from Yamtti."

Ryu Min, eager to go to Nigeria as soon as possible and persuade the alchemist, knew he had to wait for the call from Yamtti.

But before that, he needed to obtain the position of the commander of the Real Player Corps.

To elevate the reputation of Black Scythe, it was better to move after being appointed as the commander.

"When will the call come?"

At that very moment when he was anxiously waiting, Ryu Min's phone vibrated.

It was the call he had been waiting for from Yamtti.

"Ah, yeah. What happened?"

Everything you instructed has been taken care of. Master.

"Does that mean the establishment of the Real Player Corps is complete?"

Yes, that's correct. The commander of the corps is Master, Black Scythe, and we have coordinated with the police chief to wear a mask. Recruitment of corps members is also complete. I will send you the detailed schedule and location through a text message.

"Good. Well done."

Ending the call, Ryu Min smirked.

Finally, the time had come to announce the existence of the Real Player Corps to the world.
