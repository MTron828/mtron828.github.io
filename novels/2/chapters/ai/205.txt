Title: Episode 205 of the 100th Rebirth of a Max Level Player

Commendation

[Congratulations! You have achieved the quest as the 1st in this area!] [Currently, 'Black Scythe' is ranked 1st in this area.] [As the 1st in the area ranking, you will be rewarded with a 'Rune Package'!] [As the 1st in the area ranking, you will also be rewarded with a 'Special Reward Selection Box'!]

Now, getting 1st place every time is getting boring.

"But it's disappointing if I don't get it."

Thinking that it's just getting what he deserves, he used the Rune Package.

[You have used the Rune Package.] [Congratulations! The 'Rune of Gale' has appeared!] [The acquired rune is automatically engraved on the player's body!] [Rune of Gale]

-Effect: Attack speed and movement speed increase by 100%.

"Oh, it's quite good, isn't it?"

Attack speed and movement speed are already fast enough, but it's better to have them than not.

"When you look at just the runes, they have performance above average."

Becoming stronger is not a bad thing, and it may be necessary for future preparations.

"I don't know how strong Micael, the 1st place Archangel, is."

When he saw him before, he felt a strength akin to the abyss, but he doesn't know how it is now.

"I need to get stronger just in case I have to face Micael."

Since he already eliminated 6th and 7th place, he didn't have high expectations for the 5th place.

"I still need to be careful. It might be something that will appear in the real world."

The otherworld isn't much of a problem, but if the Archangel appears in reality, even someone like Ryumin should be cautious.

"He might even be targeting my younger brother."

Thinking about it as a precaution, he pressed the Special Reward Selection Box.

[You can choose one of the following special rewards.] [Please touch the desired reward.]

└ 1. Experience points double buff (Limited to round 13)

└ 2. Mercenary unit rank increased by one level

└ 3. Information about round 13

"There's no need to think about it. It's definitely number 2."

He intentionally isn't leveling up, so experience points are not needed.
ChatGPT

Round 13 information goes without saying.

"If the mercenary unit rank goes up, there's a chance to catch a dragon."

As soon as he touched number 2, a message appeared.

[Your mercenary unit rank has risen from 'Professional' to 'Veteran.']

To catch a dragon, he just needs to raise it one more step.

◀ ROUND 12 End ▶

[Unified Area CA-EA001]

└ Survivors: 9,994

[After a while, your soul will be transferred to the original dimension's body.] [Round 13 will start at midnight on January 1, 2023. See you in the next round. Congratulations on surviving.]

"Fortunately, I can get ranking rewards this round."

Ma Kyung-rok, who ranked 2nd in Round 12, got up from bed with a satisfied face.

It was not even 5 a.m., but sleep didn't come.

Ting-

Holding a whiskey glass with ice, he looked at the night view from the hotel.

When he looked at the clear Han River during Round 11, he felt frustrated, but now he can breathe a bit.

"I thought I would lag behind others because of 0 points, but I'm relieved that I held my ground."

What was crucial was hearing the prophecy about the strategy from the prophet.

"He said individual rankings are based on the number of monsters killed, so I had to try to defeat the golems alone."

Thanks to that, he could defeat all 100 monsters in the second trial and achieve 2nd place.

But still, he couldn't surpass the threshold of the Black Scythe.

"Darn it, that guy. How did that melee dealer manage to kill 200 monsters alone and get 1st place?"

It seems he tackled the second and third trials alone, which means he must have mastered magic as well.

"Or did he have a ranged weapon like a bow?"

Reluctantly admitting, with the strength of the Black Scythe, even holding a weak weapon wouldn't be a problem.

"Ugh, annoying guy."

The anger from Round 11 still lingered, making the Black Scythe seem less pleasant.

"We could have formed a party of five, but he refused that too."

Initially, even though he could have formed a party with himself, An Sang-cheol, and Seo Ah-rin, he refused and took away only democracy.

He didn't say it, but it felt like a blatant move.

"Come to think of it, he's been hanging out with that buffer for a while. Are they in a relationship or something?"

No way.

Who would like someone with a strong personality disorder, using banmal (informal speech) from the first meeting, and being only self-centered?

"Oh, there is someone."

The person that Ma Kyung-rok remembered was Christine.

Although she tried not to show it, Ma Kyung-rok was perceptive.

He knew that Christine secretly liked the Black Scythe.

"That makes sense. After all, he saved her life. It's natural to develop personal feelings. But..."

Ma Kyung-rok chewed on his lower lip thoughtfully.

"Why keep an engagement partner by your side and still flirt with someone else?"

Their relationship couldn't be considered bad, but it certainly couldn't be considered good either.

It felt like a formal relationship just for show, which was only natural given that they were trying to impress others.

"But they are engaged. They made promises for the future. You shouldn't be flirting in that situation."

Honestly, Ma Kyung-rok had no interest in who Christine liked.

It was just a month ago that he thought he didn't need her to like him.

However, he clearly realized it now.

No matter what, he couldn't stand seeing her with the Black Scythe.

"The guy who monopolizes the only representative area and is also ranked 1st thinks he can snatch someone else's woman?"

Despite being the one who saved Christine's life, negative emotions outweighed any feelings of gratitude.

"If I knew I would be stressed like this, I would have saved her, damn it."

Perhaps the prophet knew about all this?

That the Black Scythe would save Christine.

"Damn prophet."

Now, even the innocent prophet started to look precious to him.

"There's one way. I just need to prove to Christine that democracy is my girlfriend. Then, she'll give up her one-sided crush."

It wasn't a one-sided crush, but Ma Kyung-rok had no way of knowing that.

In his negative eyes, looking at her with admiration seemed like praising her.

"But how do I prove that democracy is my girlfriend?"

He knew nothing about her real name, her face, or anything.

The Black Scythe was the same.

Moreover, perhaps she might not even be a girlfriend.

"Well, with that level of ability, I can't help but stick around."

A buffer that boosts all stats, attack speed, and movement speed to nearly double.

Such a tempting talent couldn't be ignored.

"I want to keep her by my side and keep getting buffs. That's how I feel."

That's why Ma Kyung-rok was digging and digging to find out the true identity and home address of Democracy.

"If only that buffer could be by my side, it would be helpful in many ways..."

Unfortunately, it seems I have to give up searching.

Ma Kyung-rok, who downed the whiskey in one gulp, furrowed his brow.

Perhaps it was because of this damn mood, but today, the alcohol tasted bitter.

"It's a perfect night to work."

When stressed, choosing and killing a criminal always improved his mood.

"This is why I can't quit murder."

Since sleep wasn't coming, he decided to pick a target.

Sitting in front of his laptop, he spent time selecting which criminal to kill.

Maybe he was too focused?

He knew it was already morning, but he had missed mealtime.

"Has the time passed like this already?"

Breakfast time had passed, but he wasn't worried.

If he went downstairs and asked the hotel chef to prepare something, it would be done quickly.

Ddeueun- Ddeueun-

At that moment, his phone rang unexpectedly.

"I'll answer it. Ma Kyung-rok. What? Really? Haha, thank you. I understand. Yes, please come in."

After finishing the call, Ma Kyung-rok's face brightened considerably.

It was a call informing him that his application for KOSPI listing had been approved.

"Haha, just as the prophet said. I really made it to KOSPI in just six months."

How surprised would his father be when he heard the news he hadn't expected?

Excited, Ma Kyung-rok quickly made a call to deliver the news.

In his joy, thoughts of food faded away.

For a company to be listed on KOSPI, several conditions must be met.

It must be established for over three years, have a revenue of over 100 billion won, and capital of over 300 billion won.

"And net profit must exceed 60 billion for three consecutive years."

Despite these stringent conditions, Ma Kyung-rok's Player's Place company successfully passed the KOSPI listing evaluation.
ChatGPT

Now, having the opportunity to move away from being a small business signboard and advance into a reputable large corporation.

"What's even better is that I've gained my father's approval."

Despite being the eldest son, Ma Kyung-rok had grown up without his father's recognition.

Even when compared to his younger brothers, he was treated differently despite having no lack of abilities.

"Because my father's expectations for the eldest son were too high."

His father always said this when scolding him.

"Do you know what I did to earn recognition from your grandfather at your age? I inflated a mere capital, created and developed a venture company. That company is now Osung Electronics, which occupies 65% of the market capitalization!"

After a few more words of nagging, the conclusion was that if he was born as the eldest son, he should be able to build a large company like himself.

"That's what he meant by starting a company."

Provide the capital, build a company, and try to enter the top 30 on KOSDAQ within five years. If he could do that, his abilities would be acknowledged, and he would be officially designated as the successor, inheriting all the assets, as promised in front of everyone.

However, despite four years passing, Cheonma Consulting remained around the level of KOSDAQ 85. At the point with only one year left, Ma Kyung-rok had almost given up.

"Moreover, it's as if the world wanted to collapse... until the great upheaval happened."

But didn't they say that if you don't give up, opportunities will come?

Meeting a nobleman named Ryumin, he changed the business sector to PlaPla Market, and within six months, he achieved listing on KOSPI.

"All thanks to the prophet."

Feeling a renewed sense of gratitude, Ma Kyung-rok suddenly recalled the curses he had uttered in the morning.

He felt somewhat sorry for it.

"He'll be coming soon. I should welcome him warmly."

Having called Ryumin to the company with good news, he would be arriving shortly.

"Congratulations in advance, Mr. CEO."

As An Sang-cheol bowed beside him, Ma Kyung-rok grinned.

"Haha, Director An, you've been a great help all this time."

"What have I done?"

"No, if it weren't for Director An, could I have come this far? Every time I needed to relieve stress, wasn't it Director An who helped?"

Here, stress referred to murder.
ChatGPT

It was a statement expressing gratitude for Director An, who served as a reliable support in charge of the aftermath of murders.

"Did you also call Chairman to the company?"

"I did."

"Do you know that we passed the evaluation?"

"I know. I told everything over the phone. He couldn't believe it and kept saying, 'Is it really true?'"

How surprised must he have been to achieve listing on KOSPI, surpassing even KOSDAQ's top 30?

"Why didn't you tell this good news to the prophet?"

"Even without saying, he understood. Just by saying he's coming to congratulate us willingly, you can tell, right?"

"That's fortunate. Everything is falling into place as the prophecy said."

"That's right. Hoho."

A continuous smile lingered on Ma Kyung-rok's lips.

To show how delighted he was, he personally prepared a celebration with the employees at the company.

"Haven't you eaten yet?"

"Not yet."

"Did you skip breakfast too?"

"After five years, achieving what I desired, I didn't even feel hungry."

While Ma Kyung-rok was smiling broadly, the awaited guest arrived.

"CEO, Chairman is here."

Before An Sang-cheol could speak, Ma Kyung-rok saw him entering.

Chairman Ma Dae-cheol was coming in.

"Have you arrived, Fathe—"

Ma Kyung-rok's expression, which had been smiling as he spoke, instantly stiffened.

Behind him were his less accomplished younger brothers, the second and third sons.

"CEO, Chairman has arrived."
