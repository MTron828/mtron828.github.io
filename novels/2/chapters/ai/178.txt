If that were possible, I would have sat in one place, killing slimes and collecting rewards as they split.

"Let's go. We should be there soon."

"Yes, Master."

While Ryu Min was killing slimes, he occasionally kept an eye on the group chasing behind him using his Thousand-Mile Vision.

The first group he checked was the Chinese players.

"They seem confused because tracking and exploring the surroundings don't work inside the labyrinth."

Once inside the maze, the connection to the outside world is blocked. If the path deviates, it becomes untraceable and signals can't be picked up.

"It looks like they lost the Korean guide who was leading them. They won't be able to find their way without him."

Unless they stay within 5 meters of each other, they become separated like long-lost family members in the blink of an eye.

"All paths are connected like cubes, so we might meet someday, but it will take quite some time."

"I need to memorize their locations. I might need the help of the Chinese players to defeat the Doppleganger."

Smirking, Ryu Min shifted his focus.

Not only the Chinese players but also Ma Kyung-rok and his group were lost.

Seeing An Sang-chul, who came to track the Black Scythe but got confused when the signal was lost, Ryu Min thought, "You shouldn't follow unknown places recklessly."

Despite the jab, Ryu Min was satisfied as things proceeded according to plan.

"By the way, is Kristin okay?"

Checking, he found that she was still waiting at the original location without moving, and the number of followers had increased from 2 to 10.

"She must think having more companions is safer... but it's a useless effort. The Despair Sect will gather that much influence even in despair."

Switching to the viewpoint of the sorcerer John Delga, it was clear that he had decided to kill Kristin.

"While Kristin waits for her followers, he plans to gather his cultists and launch a surprise attack all at once."

That was the perfect timing for Ryu Min to intervene.

It's best to step forward in a moment that's not too dangerous, where there's no justification to be treated like a lunatic.

"Of course, I have to defeat the Doppleganger first and escape from this place."

The frequency of slime appearances was decreasing, indicating they were almost there.

That was the moment.

"Is anyone there? Can someone please help!"

A thin, desperate voice echoed from beyond the forest.

Walking toward the sound, there was a woman leaning against a tree, gasping for breath.

"Whew, whew... Someone, please help... Ah!"

The woman noticed Ryu Min and Ju Seong-tak and exclaimed, "You're alive! There were others besides me!"

A woman dressed like a player tried to get up with joy but winced in pain and sank back down.

"Ugh... Hey, could you please help me? I can't get up. My ankle is injured..."

"What happened?"

"I was attacked by a slime. My foot hurts so much I can't move."

Glancing at the woman's ankle, it was swollen and blue as if poisoned.

"Hmm. Looks like you can't move."

"It hurts so much, sniff."

"So, what do you want us to do?"

Perhaps sensing Ryu Min's indifferent response, desperation appeared on the woman's face.

"Could you please take me out of here? I beg you. I'll do anything you ask. Yes?"

"Anything?"

"Yes! Anything. Well, it's embarrassing to say, but if you want to relieve your desires, I can..."

"Enough. Can you give us any items you have?"

"Items? Of course!"

The woman opened her inventory and took out a few unique materials and high-level magic stones.

"I'll give you these for now. I'll give the rest after you rescue me. How about that?"

"Fine."

Although he agreed, Ryu Min didn't even glance at the items. He simply approached the woman with the scythe.

"What are you doing..."

Before the woman could react, he struck her neck.

Thunk!

The surprised face rolled on the ground.

While the sudden murder might have startled others, Ju Seong-tak remained calm.

He had already heard the explanation from Ryu Min.

-Dopplegangers steal the appearance and memories of the person they kill, deceiving other humans who enter the maze. They often pretend to be victims of slimes, ask for help, and then possess and kill their helpers.

Having heard the story in advance, Ju Seong-tak could quickly realize the truth upon seeing the woman.
ChatGPT

That guy was none other than the boss of this place, the Doppleganger.

Pssss-

The woman's body scattered like powder, disappearing.

The items that were on the ground also vanished.

Everything was fake.

As real as the player's appearance and memories were, they were all fabricated.

Smeul-smeul-

From the spot where the corpse disappeared, black smoke rose, taking on the shape of a person.

[How did you figure it out? My smoke was perfect, wasn't it?]

Ryu Min openly mocked the guy who spoke fluent Korean.

"Trying to talk to a monster about the subject of monsters. How ridiculous."

[Monster? You humans who intruded into someone else's territory are the real monsters, aren't you?]

"Enough nonsense. Bring it on, monster brat."

[A human with a sharp tongue.]

At that moment, a quest window appeared before Ryu Min.

└ Condition ▶ Uncover Doppleganger's trap and confront its true form

[You have completed the sub-quest!] [Points+2,000]

└ Condition ▶ Witness Doppleganger killing other prey

└ Current Doppleganger's kills (0/10)

└ Condition ▶ Kill Doppleganger yourself

The sub-quest also appeared in Ju Seong-tak's view as he gazed into the empty space.

"Ju Seong-tak."

"Yes?"

"Run."

Leaving only those words behind, Ryu Min sprinted forward.

Having thought of the plan, Ju Seong-tak swiftly followed his master.

[Where are you going, human!]

Doppleganger's apparition flew through the air, slicing through space.

Despite being chased by Doppleganger for no apparent reason, Ryu Min taunted him.

[You boldly charged in earlier; did you suddenly change your mind? Where did your previous boldness go? Human!]

Ryu Min ran through the labyrinth without responding, paying no attention to the provocations.

[Stop there! Do you think you can escape from my territory!]

'Yeah.'

Although he wanted to answer like that, Ryu Min held back.

He had provoked enough; now he needed to lure Doppleganger.

'Honestly, Doppleganger is slow. Slow to react.'

Floating around aimlessly, Doppleganger couldn't catch up with the player's running.

If he set his mind to it, defeating Doppleganger was not a difficult task.

But he deliberately controlled his speed, making it seem like he was just barely avoiding capture.

After all, he needed to complete the quest of feeding Doppleganger.
ChatGPT

"In a little while, the maze's location will change. We need to lure it to that area."

Ryu Min checked the location and stopped in front of a tree with Ju Seong-tak.

[What's this? Running around like a mouse, and now you're giving up?]

As Doppleganger, who had been chuckling, approached within 5 meters.

"Huh?"

"What, what is it?"

The maze's location changed.

At the same time.

"Where did they suddenly appear from?"

In the blink of an eye, they found themselves facing new individuals.

It was none other than the Black Society group.

Amidst the confusion, only Doppleganger's form was stretching its mouth in a long, distorted manner.

[Oh? What's this surprise? Suddenly, the prey is increasing. Kil-kil.]

As Ryu Min lured Doppleganger to the location of the Chinese players, as expected, Doppleganger was pleased.

[Then, I'll enjoy this meal!]

Shi Zekang was bewildered.

It was one thing for two Asians to suddenly appear before him.

The problem was.

"Help, save me!"

Squish, squish, thud!

His subordinates were dying.

To an unknown monster in a black form.

"Shi, Shi Zekang!"

As the black figure absorbed into one subordinate as if being absorbed, a cracking sound of bones breaking echoed.

Thud, thud-

"Scream! Aaah! Aaah!"

The screams didn't last long.

In just 5 seconds, the limbs of the dead subordinate twisted grotesquely, and the black figure emerged like a soul.

Then, it immediately clung to another subordinate, twisting their limbs in the same 360-degree manner.

Thud-

"Cough! Cough!"

'What the hell.'

In an instant, three subordinates were dead.

Clearly, that black figure seemed to be the cause.

'What in the world is that.'

Exactly, it seemed like a ghostly presence that kills people.

They needed to resolve the urgent situation at hand.

"What are you all doing idly! That black figure is the cause! Quickly, kill it!"

Following Shi Zekang's command, the subordinates snapped out of it and aimed their swords at the subordinate attached to the black figure.

However.

"Hey, hey, guys! What's going on! It's me, me! Chenfu!"

Seeing the familiar sight of a colleague waving his hands and speaking in Mandarin, the subordinates couldn't bring themselves to swing their swords.
ChatGPT

However, they didn't know that the momentary hesitation would determine life and death.

Thunk! Thunk!

"Cough... cough..."

"Cough...!"

Chenfu, who ruthlessly pierced his comrade's throat with a sword, was now emitting a bitter laugh.

"Hehe, idiots. Falling for such a simple act. Anyway, you humans are all so weak."

"What, what is he?"

"Mo-monster?"

"Die, monster!"

Towards the revealed true nature of Chenfu, comrades stabbed their swords at him.

In an instant, Chenfu, now turned into a puppet, twisted his head, but Doppleganger did not die and instead moved to another body.

"Hehe, you'll kill me? Give it a try."

Facing the unidentified monster that continued to switch bodies, killing subordinates, Shi Zekang's face turned pale.

'How can I kill that thing? It's not taking any damage at all!'

Just as Shi Zekang judged the situation as hopeless and attempted to escape.

"Where do you think you're going?"

Ryu Min, holding a scythe, blocked his way.

"Who are you? Get out of the way!"

"Weren't you the one who came looking for me?"

"Who the hell are you, punk!"

"Don't you recognize me?"

Ryu Min, swinging the black scythe over his shoulder, smiled and said, "It's me. Black Scythe."
